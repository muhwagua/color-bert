      Okay back.  Rita and I just went to have a cigarette.  It is fucking freezing outside.  My nuts and her tits were the size of peas due to the extreme lack of warmth in our bodies.  And Rita's eye blister looks like it might be going down.  Phew.  No one likes eye blisters.  And no one likes bleeding gums either, but it looks like that is how the rest of my life is supposed to be lived.  I definitely should get a good acting/modeling gig with a bloody smile.  Hey...if a fat, mostly balding, speech-impetiment simple Simon can get one...so should I be able to. Kelly is meeting Rita and I for lunch today.  It will be fun for the three of us to meet up and have a quick bite.  Catch up on the last couple of days.  Her aunt just gave her 50 bones, so we might get to eat somewhere nicer than Burger King.  Although I am totally partial to Burger King.  Yem.   Cleo, this woman I work with, is just a nightmare.  She has a cat for a husband, attention-deficit disorder, and a body that breaks all legal limits.  I don't really understand it.  Yesterday, she came up to me and we had the following conversation: Cleo: "So Joe, I am taking this new medication and it is making me have a fever and cotton mouth." Joe:  "Oh.  What kind of medication is it?" Cleo:  "(Says something totally unitelligible)" Joe:  "Oh.  What does that medicine do for you exactly." Cleo:  "Well you see Joe, it dries out my face.  It makes all of the oil that my face produces go away forever.  It is a process that goes on for 6 months.  Then at the end of the process, my face will be free of acne and totally dry." Joe:  (holding back the laughter that is rising to my mouth) "But Cleo, your face is beat red and looks like it has scales of dry flakes on it." Cleo:  "That's a GOOD thing." Joe:  (PISSING MYSELF WITH LAUGHTER AT THIS POINT) "But Cleo, what if in ten years you want to have some natural oils on your face.  Then it will be impossible." Cleo:  "Oh stop it Joe.  No one wants natural oils on their face."  (walks away with purpose) I immediately died laughing.  DIED LAUGHING.  Is she kidding?  Is she crazy?  Why would you take any medicine that a) gave you a fever  b) gave you a fever and scaly skin and c) gave you a fever and scaly skin and ALSO depleted all natural oils from your face for the rest of your life!  REST OF YOUR LIFE!  Lordy.   Funniest part about this entry...Cleo stood here, talking to me over my desk while I typed it.  What a fuck.

      Well helloooooooooooo.....so Paul has come and gone.  I am still a virgin.  It wasn't the right time.  I thought it was the right time, but it just turned out that you can't really plan for something like this.  I wanted us to have a wonderful day seeing RENT, going out to dinner, going to a club and just being together.  Ideally, we would have come home and made sweet, sweet love.  However, instead of making sweet love, he shoved his fingers repeatedly in my ass and it hurt.  Usually I like having his fingers in me.  But this time it hurt a lot.  He was so aggressive and none of it felt good.  I am glad that we didn't go through with it just cuz we thought we had to.  It is better that we wait.  But I bought condoms for nothing.  I guess they won't go bad.   While Paul was here, he and I also went and got an HIV test.  It was kind of nerve-wrecking.  Just the idea of getting a test that could determine life or death is really scary.  The guy that drew blood from me asked me:  "How many life partners have you had?"  I said:  "Life partners?  Do you mean people I have had intercourse with?"  He rolled his eyes and said:  "YES!"  (Please asshole...as though every dick I suck is considered a fucking life partner) So I say:  "If you mean intercourse, then the answer is zero."  He literally looked at me as though I was a fucking liar.  SERIOUSLY!  His look said to me:  "YOU ARE A SLUT AND A WHORE AND I CAN SEE IT ON YOUR FACE."   Whatever douche...take my blood and move on. I go on Feb. 6th to get the results.  Wish me luck!   Today Rita woke up with some weird blister thing on her eye.  I mean, it is so little you can't even see it, but it is there nonetheless.  It is like me with my gums.  They are sensitive and sometimes swell and bleed.  For no reason!  We both hate body things.  Cuz sick!  I am a normal guy living in this vessel of doom. Okay...gotta close this entry out, cuz I have this feeling that I am going to lose it.  Blogger hurts my feelings sometimes when it makes what I want to post disappear into thin air.  Where do those entries go?  Prolly to Korea.

      Guess what world?  Rita Lovely started working at my job today!  It is so wonderful to have another friend working here.  She is doing an amazing job already and I think that everyone loves her.  We will have to see though.  Imagine my boss is like:  "Well SURE Rita is great at what she does, and works hard, and could save the company...but we are going to go with someone else."  I would have a heart attack and die on the spot.  (but then she could get my job)  Rita is the new "temporary" Admin. Asst. for the Development portion of our organization.  As stated in previous entries, the development department is full of fucking lunatics.  And now Rita literally sees first hand what I go home and talk about every day.  It is so great!  I love it! Penelope has just started her own blogger too.  I will put a link to her on here one of these days. In fact, she is blogging as we speak.   Paul comes in to town tonight!  OHMYGOODNESSOHMYGOODNESS!  I am so excited.  I called him at 12:30pm to see if he had many any arrangements to get on the bus.  He didn't answer the phone.  So I got all nervous and called his roommate (one of my best friends --- Mariah) and asked her to get ahold of him.  She must have, cuz he called me within minutes.  He was like: (in the groggiest voice ever) "Oh hi Joe.  Yeah...I am getting up now."  I am like: "GET THE FUCK OUT OF BED!  YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE HERE IN 4 HOURS!  (the bus/train ride takes 4 hours alone).  So Paul says:  "Oh, right.  Okay...I am on my way."  UGH!  Can the kid EVER just do what he is supposed to do???  He has known about these couple of days for over a month.  He keeps this up and he ain't sticking his dick in my tomorrow.  TOMORROW!  AY YI YI! Either way...he is on the train as I write this.  And I really can't wait to jump into his arms the minute he walks through the door.  I can't wait to kiss his mouth, take off his shirt, and have him carry me into the bedroom.  I love him so much.  He is so BOY!  And as much as it pisses me off, cuz he doesn't always remember the little things, he is still a strong, straight-acting, sincere motha-fucker.  He has a huge heart and takes care of me.  Always has.  Gives me a boner just thinking about him.   And we have been together for 2 years!  And I still get hard.  Now that's an accomplishment.   I have the next day and a half off from work.  This way I can totally maximize my visit with Paul.  I have also planned something amazing for us to do tomorrow.  I would write it in here, but I feel as though he might read this tonight.  I want to tell him about this so that he can catch up with me even if we don't have a chance to talk.  :)  Also, maybe he will learn a thing or two about how to be a better boyfriend.   So tonight, Kelly, Rita and I play cards and hang out with Paul.  Then I suck his dick and then he and I go to bed holding eachother until the morning.  Or maybe tonight is the night that he will slip it in me.   Well, only if I don't puke from nerves first.

      I have this problem called my gums are rotting. You can't tell by looking, but they tingle a lot and sometimes they bleed.  But today, mostly just tingling.  I went to the dentist on Monday and he cleaned them and told me that everything looked fine.  However, they don't feel fine.  Can't I just have normal gums like all the rest of the boys and girls?

      Another day spent shoveling shit.  In actuality, my shit is in the form of data entry and answering the phones.  People are just fucking rude sometimes.  Most of the time...in NYC.  At first it really scared the piss out of me.  But now, I almost welcome the unwarranted aggression of other people.  Those are becoming my favorite calls to field.  It's kind of a game.  Like, how can I handle what this other person is throwing at me while still making them feel like an asshole for trying to talk above me?   In other words:  You're FUCT! Today I had egg, cheese and bacon on a roll for breakfast.  BACON IN A JEWISH PLACE.  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  Then I strung the Rabbi up from the ceiling.  Ahhh...the satisfaction of being a Goyim. This girl I work with, we shall call her Penelope...she and I have become good friends and brother and sister in turmoil.  She is working on this project for the Development Portion of our office...it is fucking hysterical.  These ladies that are supposed to be the PR group that raises all the money for our non-profit organization...they are, for a lack of better words, mentally retarded.  They can't form sentences, dress well, or possess any sort of sense of humor.  Whatever...it is so hard to explain how absolutely ABSURD these women are.  And I sit back and laugh.  Laugh cuz these are the people telling ME how to conduct myself at work.  Penelope gets on the verge of smashing the fax machine sometimes.  One time she slammed it on the counter and I ran for my life.  My job is a cross between WWF Smackdown and a fucked-up Jewish version of the slow class in highschool.   Hee?  Hee. BUT IT'S MOTHA FUCKIN FRIDAY!  I love the weekend.  Especially Friday nights. Staying up until the crack of dawn and then sleeping through the shitty part of Saturday.  Alright, must go shave my pubes in the bathroom before I go home.  Later...

      It is later in the day.  I have finally calmed down a bit and realized that bad moods come and go.  It is funny how you can forget that every time you fall into that mode.  I was frustrated today.  I felt so useless at work and incapable of earning my measly income.  I went to college for God's sake.  I should be able to get into gear enough to find a new place of employment.  Just can't motivate myself enough.  And then I get so pissed when I am treated as though I went to fucking BOCES.  No offense to those that went to BOCES.  Hey, that's your station in life.  But I wasn't BOCES and now I am basically making the wage of a certified cosmetologist.  Or a mechanic.  Or whatever other career BOCES trains you in when you don't want to go to class.   Today is my bitter day.  As much as I can release and feel better...I will go to bed furious.  Cuz thats how I woke up.  My day was pre-determined.  Hmmm....normal.   Tonight, Kelly, Rita and I had a house meeting.  Just to get shit in order before they got out of hand.  It was the most N'SYNC* moment I have had with 2 other people in a long time.  3's don't work.  I have been a part of dozens, and they always fail.  But this 3 isn't a 3.  It's a 2, 2, and 2.  A different attempt at the same concept?  Possibly.  But it works beautifully so far.  Great house meeting.  Decided a few basic understandings...bills, cleaning, groceries.  Then we watched "When Harry Met Sally " and just loved eachother.  Pretty bomb.  Felt like the beginning of something good.    I spoke with Paul today.  It was amazing.  I was very candid with him and kept in check.  No freaking out over the long distance, no getting over jealous for no reason, no making him prove his love to me.  I hate these things that I do.  DESPISE.  But it is so hard not to when you try to live a full relationship in 10 minute conversations.  So today was good.  He even sent me a text from his phone to my email at work.  I smiled and felt warm inside.  The comfort of having him there even when I felt like poo.  (POO!---makes me piss myself.)   I really think that I am going to sleep with Paul.  Listen...I am not some big loser that never had sex or couldn't get sex or was too afraid to do sex.  I guess part of me is insecure that these LAME reasons would be my reason and that's why I spout about it now...but I spout nonetheless.  I have held out for that perfect moment.  I was gay in highschool (even though i didn't truly understand it or know it), gay in college and I never slept with a girl.  I didn't even hook up with a guy until I was a sophomore in college.  Late bloomer.  So I have waited for that moment that I will never forget.  The one thing that is in my control.  I decide how beautiful and wonderful it will be.  And I know that is exactly how it will happen.  Next week!  The most exciting part of it is that I have butterflies and nervous tension.  As though I was doing him after the Junior Prom.  It's just going to be a moment that in some way will change my life dramatically.  And move me into that next phase of my life.  Whoa.  I'm gonna puke. These are my thoughts tonight.   Also...in my last entry...I say that I am at work and that it "is a lot of shit for 12:00pm".  IT'S TRUE!  I wrote everything this morning and I am HTML stupid so I don't know how to fix the time.  Blogger has already fucked me and we had only been on one date.   dick. Sleep well.

      "Come on be my baby tonight" Why is the first entry always the hardest?  I have written this 3 times and I am never happy with the words that spill out of my face.  I find myself struggling to be cool or to be funny or come up with a theme, but instead I always end up sounding like a complete jackass.  So now I just be me.  And if you don't like it you can just leave. NO!  DON'T!   I really want you to stay.   Here is my brief introduction:   I am a born-again gay Christian who is an actor living in NYC.  I have a boyfriend of 2 years named Paul and he lives in Boston.  Currently I live with one beautiful and talented Rita Lovely and another girl who is also beautiful and talented, but her name is Kelly.  I should also mention that I am one hot man-beast.  I am also not your typical gay guy.  I refuse to ever be the Will to your Grace.  And I will never take you shopping for shoes or for that new shade of lipstick, just cuz I think that shit is lame.  (Although I totally wish I had the money to buy myself a new pair of shoes and lipstick) I work for a Jewish organization as an Administrative Assistant.  As I said, I am not Jewish at all.  I just like having a job.  Unfortunately for me, I take pride in my work.  And as anyone who has ever worked in an office setting (especially as an AA) knows, no one else takes as much pride in your work as you do.  To be quick...I fucking hate my job and if one more person acts like the task I haven't gotten to yet is of the UTMOST importance, I will probably freak the fuck out and and shove white-out down their throat.   I have a brother who is moving to Germany for 3 years.  He leaves in 2 weeks.  I die inside when I think about it.  I have a mother and father who have been smoking for 25 years (me for 4), and I die inside when I think about them dying inside.  I also have an estranged sister and a dog that was stung to death by bees in front of my face when I was 7.  Oh the stories of life's trials are endless.  And we all got em.   And lastly, but definitely most importantly, I am still a virgin.  Long fucking story that I won't get into because I am hoping to be a non-virgin/slut by next week.  Paul is coming and I think it is time.  Poor kid has waited for 2 years on this...but there are valid reasons.  Such as---put on a condem or no dick-in-the-ass for you.   That should be a good enough introduction for now.   Well I shouldn't forget the fact that I have a MAJOR bodybuilder fetish.  HUGE, PUMPED, STRONG, MUSCLE turns me on in ways that nothing else could.  And no, my boyfriend is not a bodybuilder.  Life is just full of contridictions.   Right now I am at work.  I am also annoyed as I possibly could be.  Counting the minutes until I either go home or set the place ablaze.  Yet, even if the place WAS burning down...it would be:  "Joe, just get this last fax out before the building collapses".  I am just relieved to know that when I go home at the end of the day...I have a life and these fuckers have cats for husbands, social graces of cows, and a fetish for chocolate like I never knew was humanly possible.   Here is my slightly offensive, yet totally honest thought for the day, as though I haven't offended you already: Rita and I were having a conversation recently that I think was very important to understanding the human condition.   We both divulged that we have a secret desire to be hit by some out of control car and laid up in a hospital for a couple of months.  Cuz when this happens, everyone that loves you comes to visit you and babies you as though you are the only person on the earth.  And that shit feels good.  Balloons and presents and cards from people that just CAN'T believe that you are hurt.   Unfortunately, Rita and I also realized that these type of horrible fantasies never turn out the way you want them too.  Instead of being hit by a car (that OF COURSE wouldn't damage my model-type face or give me any permanent physical damage) and being stuck in a hospital with TV and visitors, I would end up either losing both of my legs or with one eye that is perfect while the other eye that is sleeping permanently.  Imagine a face with one eye sleeping and the other eye awake...that shit is scary!  Hence, nothing ever works out well when you wish an ill-fate on yourself. In conclusion...do not pray that you will be walking across the street and lucky enough to witness a suicide.  Cuz as great as it would be to get out of work for a couple of days....odds are that you will re-live that image over and over until you accomplish the same fate.  WOW~!  Some heavy shit for 12:00pm.

      I have to tell one really quick story called:  " How Joe saved himself from the destruction of all things blog-like ".   Earlier this afternoon...let's say around 12:30pm, I decided to add some really cool things to my blogger.  I copied and pasted java script into my template and was getting increasingly more impressed with myself at how fast I was learning how to read the lingo.  I was adding things left and right and my smile was growing bigger and bigger. Then, out of no where, my page FUCKS itself up.  Actually I fucked it up cuz I thought I was more talented than I really am.  The part  of my page that has the ARCHIVE listing stretched itself so wide that it covered my entire page.  All text was lost and I flipped the fuck out.  I started screaming for Rita to come and save my ass.  She was busy and not in the mood for my ridiculousness.  Especially since she was working real hard today and I was playing for hours.  She came out to help me fix my template and said the words of doom: "Joe, I really don't think I know how to fix it."  My heart sank and I was convinced that I ruined my blogger.  I was crushed.   I say to Rita, in my emotional outburst, that "if I don't fix this, I am never writing in a journal like this again!"   Rita and I leave for lunch.  She buys me a nice meal at the West End and tells me not to panic, that she will fix it later on in the evening.  I try to put it out of my mind for the duration of the lunch, but I was still so miserable.  How could I fuck up my entire BLOGGLE?  (Bloggle is my pet name for Blogger) We get back for lunch and I immediately go to town on trying to solve the problem.  I open a whole new blogger and try to compare the two templates.  It took me about an hour and a half to sort through the chaos that I caused.   Suddenly, out of the abyss of all things amazing, my blogger is fixed!  A yelp of joy escapes my throat and I run to Rita to explain that, with God's help, I have become the Java Script genius.  Little does anyone know, but I sold my first born baby to the devil for the site to fix itself.  Goodbye my child.  Goodbye.   Hell, it was worth it. So, my page was fixed and I thought: "Do I DARE go back in and try to add the links back into my site?"  "What if I totally fuck it up again?"  I decided to give it a go.   AND MY SITE LOOKS BEAUTIFUL.  I am so happy.  It made the whole day worth it and gave me a feeling of accomplishment like I have never known.   I am really starting to get this whole java script/html thing.  Slowly...very slowly...but surely...very surely. So please, feel free to sign my guest book.  Also feel free to answer the mini-poll.  I will change the question as often as I can.  Thank you Lord for saving my ghoulie.  I would have been so sad if I lost all my hard work.

      Good morning VIETNAM!  I am so glad that Vietnam is over.  Finally, after all these years, I can get on with my life. Last night was the Grammy's.  I only watched for maybe an hour, but in that hour, I was lucky enough to see this group called "NSYNC" perform.  Hee.  This "group".  They are only my LOVE!  My dream.  My desire.  My inspiration. Their performance was outstanding.  It was tight, it was live, and it totally showed everyone that they are still cutting edge and perfectly in sync with each other.  I think that these boys are the best pop group out there.  They sing live WHILE dancing.  They ain't no J-LO that lip syncs, even though she can dance.  Justin and JC are obviously the king and queen of the group.  I am just more impressed by these guys every time I see them perform.  They meet all of my expectations and then some.  (Big sigh) I finished this book last night called "Me Talk Pretty One Day" by David Sedaris.  This piece of literature is the most hysterical thing I have ever laid my eyes on.  I laughed out loud more at this book than any other book I have ever read.  I wish I could give some specific examples, but I know that some of you want to be reading it.  And you should be reading it.  Pure genius. My breath is STANK today.  I can taste it.  Feels like, while I was sleeping, our cat, Trey, came in, pooped in my mouth, dropped some litter in for good measure...and then took off.  All without me realizing.  Luckily, the poop tasted good and I digested it by morning.   But now my breath....oof. Penelope is getting a tooth fixed this morning.  It broke yesterday while she was eating pudding or something.  I don't think she even remembers exactly when the incident happened.  But suddenly she had half of a molar missing!  YIKES. My worst nightmare.  Really.  I would melt into jelly and slosh away down the sewers if my tooth ever just cracked open.  UGH.  No more talking about it, cuz I feel like I may vomit.  I hope she is okay.  Her appointment was for 9am.   Paul sent me the most adorable message this morning.  I open my inbox to my email and there is this message that says: "Thank you for being mine."  OH!  I melted all over the floor.  Gosh.  All I am doing today is melting for different reasons.  He can be so adorable when he wants.  And if he really tries...he makes me feel so good about myself.  And makes me think that maybe long distance is okay.   But maybe it's not.   I do love him though.  So much. Alright, time to do some work....

      Hello to all of my faithful readers.  Or maybe just to my faithful friends.  According to my site meter...I have had over 150 hits so far.  That is great!  Keep it up readers...makes me feel so gooooooooooood. Today has been an average day.  Been pretty busy at work and my spirits have been mediocre.   Yesterday was just an amazing day.  After work, Penelope, Rita and I went for drinks at the West End.  I just love that West End.  Their drinks are affordable, the ambiance is great, and we have literally made it our second home.  We were just going to have 1 or 2 drinks and as usual, this turned into 3 or 4 or 5.  Buzzing in the most audacious manner, the 3 of us left the joint to drive to Penelope's apartment.  There we commenced with the drinking, smoked a few bongs, and had some laughs.  It was really the perfect way to spend a half day off.  After this fun, Rita and I risked a DWI and drove back to our apartment in Queens.  We got a little sidetracked and ended up somewhere near Flushing.  Ok...we didn't end up THAT far away, but we were definitely lost for like 20 minutes.  Then next thing we know, we take this random left and are suddenly on the path to our house.  Last night the Real World was a repeat.  FUCK!  I hate repeats.  But I shouldn't complain since it is the first repeat that they have shown.  But Ugh!  How do I wait a whole week to find out what happens to Kerry and Kyle?!?! Okay Joe.  Get a grip.   Mmmm...I just gripped myself alright.  And it felt goooooooooood. That is the second time that I typed: "gooooood" in this entry.  And I don't think "goooood" is even a word.   maybe it is. What else, what else.... Kelly seems to think that she has more entries in her diary than I have in my blogger.  PSHAW Kelly.  I counted your entries.  You have a total of: 17.  I have a total of: a million.  Hee. I win.  The trophy goes to me.   Oh great.  Does that mean I have to go out and BUY a trophy now?  Like I can even afford that shit.   This weekend, Rita has a friend coming.  This friend will now be known as Jill.  (Great play on names, huh folks?)  We are supposed to go to Karaoke.  I have decided to quit smoking for a couple days to get my beautiful, tenor falsesetto prepared for my performance.  Bullshit.  I will smoke a bowl right before we go.  And then I will sing "The Joker" by the Steve Miller Band. I have never met Jill before, but from what I hear, she is damn amazing.  I am pretty excited to see who this chick is.  Maybe I will "do" her when Rita ain't looking.  whatever.  As long as I get my dick sucked. Last night I called Doug again.  I just had to.  Rita says that I "have no game" cuz I stalk those that show any interest.  HAHA.  I don't stalk for real, but if I want something...hells if I am not going to go for it.  So I call Doug and leave a message that is like: "Hello Doug.  I have called twice now and I am not calling again.  Please call immediately or I will fuck you up."   Doug ends up calling me back an hour later.  I screen the call and Doug says on the message: "Joe, pick up..." Does he KNOW that I am screening?  Have I known him longer than 10 minutes in my whole life?  Or does he just have this 6th sense that tells him that I am a screening freak?  I don't know.   Needless to say, I didn't pick up the phone and when I went to call him back an hour later, I got the voice mail.  Whatever Doug.  Call me again or don't.  At this point I don't care.   (yeah I do) so much so. This is one of the weirdest entries I have ever written.  I am just kind of going off the top of my head.   Hope I don't sound like too much of a fuck. fuck. me. immediately. in my virgin ass. WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH ME TODAY?!?!?!?  Maybe I am in a better mood than even I realize.

      So I have this problem.  My farts over the last week have been potent enough to kill a person.  In fact, to be honest, I have killed 2 of my friends already.  Penelope says that she is charging me with "Attempted Manslaughter".  And she should.  Citizen's arrest all the way.   I haven't really been able to take a shit in days.  So the steak I had for dinner on Sunday is just building on top of the chicken I had the day before.  And last nights egg salad...just forget it.  I am full of food and about ready to explode out of my bloated, rotting stomach.

      Good morning...GOOD MORNING!  I only have to be at work today until 1pm.  AAAAAAAAAAAAMAZING!  It is this holiday I like to call Purim.  Some celebration of sorts.  I am celebrating by getting drunk at 2pm in the afternoon.  What a day. I came up with a great idea last night while I was laying in bed playing with myself.   One night, I am going to smoke a bowl and sit at my blogger and type for 15 or 20 minutes straight.  I realized that so much goes through my head at night when I am sitting around stoned, blankly staring at the tv.  I love the solitude and peace that comes along with a late night smoke.  But quite often, my mind races and there are so many things that I want to quickly type into my blogger.  So, coming to a blogger near you:  Joe CuttheShit waxes philosophic while under the influence of marijuana's evil control.   Rita and I drove to work today.  THOROUGHLY enjoyable.  And we got a parking spot basically in front of the building.  The only down side---I have to leave every hour to put quarters in the parking meter.  hee. Lately, I have had so many damn boogers in my nose.  Like dry, crusty boogers.  Weird.  But fun to pick and eat.   YAH!  NEVER EAT!  NEVERNEVERNEVERsometimesNEVERNEVER.  (barf) Time to go home yet?

      Well, well, well.... I sent out over 20 resumes this morning.  AND on top of that...I got a bite!  I don't know which job it is, cuz all but two of the faxes had no contact name.  But this lady, Helen Salinger called our house just now.  Kelly happened to be home and online.  She sent me the number and I called.  OKAY.  Now she just called back.  UGH.  The job sounded ok.  She briefly talked about the assistant position, but...there were 2 HUGE problems.   1)  The job paid a little less than what I am going for.  Just a little, but I am not starting over for less than my goal.  Especially with the amount of vacation time and flexibility that I have at my current job.  2)  She said that the hours of work were from 12-9pm.  Not good.  I would have ZERO time for anything else.   So whatever.  The first opportunity sucked.  But I will pray and wait for the second one.  CAN someone just offer me what I need so I can be done with this????

      Monday morning.  Yuck.  Hate Mondays, almost as much as I love Fridays.  Cept this Monday ain't so bad cuz I have a half day tomorrow at work.  And this weekend was just about damn amazing.  I am exhausted now from it, but it was well worth it.  I also spent much more money than I should have, but I didn't go out Saturday so that saved me some bones.   Friday night, Kelly, Rita and I went to Henrietta's on the Hudson.  It is this lesbian bar that we have never been to.  The place was JAMMIN.  The people were so friendly and there were some hot chicks dancing around.  Kelly gave her number to a girl, after much coaxing.  (She tends to be a little shy when it comes to these type things)  The girl she picked out was beautiful.  The most clear-blue, piercing eyes.  Her name was Shana and she was super cool.  Hopefully she will call.  I know Kelly would love that. At about 1am, the three of us loaded into a cab and went to Splash.  I love me some Splash.  I was also in rare form.  (Maybe because I had about 15 drinks that night)  Oof.  During our 2 and a half hour stint there, I met 4 guys, got 3 numbers and kissed 3 of them smack on the mouth.   The first guy I met was named Mark.  He was about 6"2 and 220#.  All muscle.  His face wasn't that great and his jeans were even worse.  But he did kiss well and he gave me a lot to hold on to.  He was a big boy and I love that.  We danced for awhile, we hugged, and about 15 minutes after I met him, I accepted his number and said "Latas".   I walk away from Mark, only to bump into this guy named "Craig".  Actually Kelly spotted Craig and when I got a glimpse of him, I went "DAMNNN!".  The boy was perfect.  He was built beyond belief and had a model face.  I mean, the guy was just about sent from heaven.  I told Kelly to track this boy down and let me dance with him.  She did just that.  When we bumped into Craig, he was like: "What's up, come dance!".  So I did.  Kelly casually bowed out of the situation and I stayed with him for a good 15 minutes.  After a couple fast dances and one slow dance, I was annoyed that Craig wasn't paying all of his attention to me.  Was he trying to win me over or just get down my pants?  I didn't know.  And then I just didn't care.  I said: "Craig, it was nice to meet you.  I am going to find my friends."  He was like: "Nooo!  Stay and dance a bit longer."  I smiled, patted him on the side of the face and went to find Kelly and Reets.   I forgot to mention that I did kiss Craig during the slow song, but it wasn't that great.  He was beautiful, but he didn't have the basics down.   Here are the basics: 1)  Pay attention to me more than everyone else.  At least for the moment that I am there.   2)  You have to be a good kisser.  If not...adios. 3)  Be a man.  Don't be flaming and never never NEVER act more gay than me. Craig fucked up the first two rules and then I met Shadrick.  Now Shadrick...he was fucking amazing.  Wanna know why?  Because Shadrick was me.  (wink, wink) Shadrick was Irish.  He didn't seem to have an accent, but the music was real loud, so maybe he did.  He was beautiful.  Nice, lean body (not my type) and an amazing face.  Shadrick walked by me, kissed me smack on the mouth and was like: "Come dance."  I didn't feel like dancing with Shadrick as I had already spied someone more my type.  Shadrick and I seem to be similar people.  We are both shmoozers, we are both adorable, and we were both seeming to spread ourselves thin at this bar.  I don't like people like me, usually.  They are competition and I would rather avoid that type and stick with the quieter, more muscular, men of the bar.  Which was who Doug is.  Now Doug.  Oh man...Doug.  Doug is maybe an inch shorter than me, maybe my height.  Doug is fucking HOT!  He had an amazing body, cool stylin/black hair, and was wearing Abercrombie.  My type of man.  Doug was also not drinking when I saw him.  We immediately made eye contact and I just stared at him for like a solid minute.  He stared back equally as long.  Finally I got so nervous that he wouldn't break my eye contact, that I had to break it.  I looked at the ground and then danced away for a second.  He was intimidating, cuz he was so beautiful.  When I looked back in Doug's direction, he had switched spots with his friend, Matt.  Doug and I stood next to eachother and danced for a minute or so.  I introduced myself and shook his hand.  He said something I couldn't hear and I asked him to repeat himself.  Then, like the PERFECT gentleman, Doug grabbed my hand and asked me to come with him to a quieter part of the bar.  Doug stood by all my rules. 1)  He was more muscular...much more than me. 2)  He took me to a quieter part of the bar so that he could hear everything I was saying.  Way to pay attention to me.  :) 3)  He could be a good kisser...but I wouldn't know that yet, cuz........ I hung with Doug longer than anyone else I met during the night.  He was friendly, adorable, and a fucking MAN!  Doug is 33 years old and lives in Yonkers. He told me what he did as an occupation and I forgot.  I was fucking trashed by this point. Doug gave me his phone number and I vowed to call him.  I never kissed him because he didn't try.  (I never try first)  As I was leaving the bar, I ran back over to Doug and told him that I would be calling him on Saturday to see if he wanted to go out with me.  He was like:  "Sure.  Please do call."  BUT...I got home, realized I had a boyfriend and didn't call.  In fact, I haven't called yet.   I spoke with Paul on Saturday and told him everything that happened.  Maybe I left out how absolutely attractive all of these guys were, but I did tell him that I kissed some boys.  And even that I was planning on calling Doug again.   He handled it with style and grace; the way he handles every fucked up thing that I do. I had an incredible time that night.  I am always suprised that I get some hot guys.  Inside my head, I feel like I am an exceptionally heavy, acne covered, no personality idiot, that wants guys that he can't have.  Yet, I can have...and I will have.  It makes me feel so good inside.    More updates on Doug to come.  I really am considering calling him today.   Oof.  Gimme some Doug.

      Okay Joe.  Cut the shit.  I gotta stop adding these stupid little tests.  But they change up my page a bit and sometimes the information I discover is VERY important.  For example this is my day of the week and also a picture of me sewing:  urlLink    What day are you?   Now, I mean...who didn't NEED to know that?

      IT'S MOTHA FUCKING FRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIDAY!  Rock.  I just love the weekend.  I don't think I have ever loved the weekend so much in my whole life.  I look forward to it like a druggie looks forward to his fresh new bag.  It's a good feeling.  And like the druggie, I know that the good feeling will have to go away eventually.  Like on Sunday around 6pm.  Oooh...makes me shudder to even think about it. Last night, Rita and I went over to play with Penelope for awhile.  Good time it was.  I am so happy that Rita and Penelope are getting along so well already.  They have a good deal of similarities and are both willing to let go.  We laugh, we wax philosophic, and we cry.  Well, not so much cry.  Actually never cry.  But it is always amazing nonetheless.   I laughed so hard last night I thought my face was going to fall off.  There was some shit that was just so damn funny.  One of them being: One of the bitches I work with, I think her name was given as "Doris" left this notebook on my desk a couple of days ago.  Doris is constantly leaving things on our desks.  And we are constantly asking her to remove her smelly shit as quick as possible.  Sometimes, quite a few times, Doris' SHIT has ended up in some garbage can on Broadway.  So Doris leaves this notebook and on Thursday I decide to take it and throw it away.  However, on the ride home in the cab, Rita and I look through the notebook and find scribblings of some HUMILIATING shit.  Doris seems to have "Professional Jealousy" with our boss.  Doris scribbles that she deals with: "anger, lies, perception" and a "need to be alone".  Doris then draws scary pictures of some sort of wolf-like serial killer.  I don't know how to describe it to you.  Well, in fact, I think I did just describe it to you.  Some scary shit. So now that the notebook has gone "missing", Miss Doris is frantically trying to find it.  She has lost numerous notebooks and has never said a word about it.  But this one...oh she knows that it has to intense writings in it.  And what IF...what IF someone like my boss happened to discover it?  Ooooh...the pleasure.  For once, we have power in our hands and I love it.  If Doris just wasn't such an animal, maybe we would just return it.  But since she is a wildebeast that knows not right from wrong, I think I will have to rip out one page at a time and sporadically slide them under her door before she gets to work.   (snicker motha-fuckin snicker) Tonight, Rita and I have some friends coming into town.  They are 2 of the 6 people that make up our intense group from college.  I haven't seen one of these girls since I graduated.  Distance has ripped us all apart.  It should be nice to have a few drinks with them.  I sure hope it is a good time.  There is always that possibility that Stacil will walk up to me and be like: "You are an asshole.  Why haven't you called?  Get the fuck out of my face."  I will then proceed to rip up the belated birthday card that I will be holding in my hand.  No.  I wouldn't.  But slap her in the face with the card...now that I would do. Alright...time to have yet another cigarette today.  Yuuuuuuuuuuuuuum.

      Why is it that straight guys (usually hot ones) have this way of flirting with me?  It's like my own personal  Temptation Island .  The ones I meet will usually not talk to me at all at first.  Then one day the relationship changes.  It's "Jeff..what's up man!?", "Jeff, you're cool man!", "Jeff, come over here and suck my dick man!".  (okay never the last comment cuz I would LOVE IT!)  It's just weird.  Maybe I read into things too much.  But deep inside I feel like I don't.  People like to flirt.  Just a fact of life.  And if a straight guy knows that I am gay and is cool with it, then I find that, more often than not, they will casually make comments to me.  It's like they WANT me to WANT them.  And sometimes I do.  I love a challenge.  And I especially like scaring the piss out of straight guys that THOUGHT they were straight, until suddenly they are sleeping in my bed and kissing me.   But these aren't the guys that will become boyfriends.  Just guys that will either:  a) break my heart b)  be a fun, "experimental" hook-up c)  kick the living shit out of me.  It's an enjoyable and dangerous game.   I am going to miss it when I finally grow up and leave straight people alone.

      "Stop and smell the roses."   This is a saying that I wish I could apply to my life.  But I just don't know how to re-train my personality to do so.   Kelly, Rita and I were having a convo. the other night about how I am always "rush around" and they are always "can we please just take our time".  I wish I could just slow everything down so that I didn't always feel like there is more fun to be had.  Know what it is?  I have to work on MY schedule.  I am one of those people that never just ups and does something.  Everything I do has to be thought out and planned.  For example, if a friend invites me to lunch at 10am that day...I will always say no.  Even if I don't have plans, I would still rather not do anything, cuz mentally I didn't have time to prepare myself.  It is becoming kind of an obsession. I love going out and getting drinks.  But if you don't ask me to do it at least 2 days in advance, the odds of me going with you are slim, but mostly slim to none.  With a focus on the none.   "Stop and smell the roses." Spontanaiety and I are good friends.  But only when I am ready for it a week in advance.  Hmph.  I need to lighten up a bit.

      Okay...one more test that I took.  This one was better than my "last past life".  I aint no fucking garbage man!  But when I took the "what donut am I?" test, it came out totally truthful.  I turned out to be jelly.  And jelly is my favorite.  And my stomach is full of blood, like a jelly donut.  And I wear powder on my face when I do stage shows.  And when you squeeze my middle, my best parts come out.  I am so a jelly donut.    urlLink    *Take This Test!*   See what you are my friend.

      I just took this test on-line to figure out what my past life is.  First off, I thought the test would be a little more enjoyable, but maybe it is only for recreation purposes.  I was hoping to discover myself and figure out why I am truly on the planet.   Yeah whatever. Here is who I was in my past life: Your Results:  You were male in your last earthly incarnation. You were born somewhere around the territory of what is now know as modern Quebeck, approximately in the year 1075. Your profession was: digger, undertaker. A brief psychological profile of you in that past life: Person with huge energy, good in planning and supervising. If you were just garbage-man, you were chief garbage-man. A lesson that your last past life wishes you to learn in your present life is: You are bound to solve problems of pollution of environment, recycling, misuse of raw materials, elimination of radioactivity by all means including psychological methods. do you remember?  -----------------------------------------------------> whatever dawg.  I was so Cleopatra in my past life.   If you would like to see what your past life is, go here:   urlLink

      I woke up from the deepest sleep this morning.  It was like flying out of a long tunnel, only to realize that at the end of it was my reality of having to get up and go to work.  I celebrated by jerking off. Last night, Rita and I went grocery shopping for Kelly.  It was fun. Like a scavenger hunt.  In fact, one of the best parts was that I brought a glass of wine with me and drank it like some old, alcoholic lady getting her menial tasks done.  It was enjoyable.  I was in bed last night by like 7:30pm.  What is my deal?  I watched some tv and laid in my comforter, sweating my nuts off.  Cuz what is the fucking deal with this weather?  Don't get me wrong...like everyone else, I enjoy it.  But unlike most people, I believe that bad things are happening because of it.  Polar ice caps melting, water draughts, the Lord Jesus Christ coming back to rapture his children.  Not that that's a bad thing.  Well, not for me.   ;) My boss isn't going to be in today.  ROCK.   Tonight Penelope and I are doing our (just about) bi-weekly ritual of having some wine together and getting a bag.  We always have a good time when we chill at her house.  I try to shove the wine down her throat, but she isn't a huge drinker.  I do consistently refill her glass though, cuz you know...once I get her liquored up, I can do whatever I want to her.  (hahahahahahahahaha) never. If you ain't watching the Real World this season, you are missing out!  I know I have written about this before, but I must write about it again.  The show, this time around, is definitely my favorite one of all time.  ALREADY!  There have been about 5 episodes so far and each one has me gripping the side of the couch, or crying one stoic tear, or yelling in anger.  The members of the cast are wonderful.  They were perfectly picked.  There is some controversy and differing of opinions (as there should be), but for the most part, they all get along so well.  It is nice to see that.  Of course, there is one guy (Theo) spouting off about how homosexuality is "discusting" and "a sin".  And there is this girl Tonya, from Wallah Wallah, Washington who is a moron, but she means well.  This week's episode was about Chris and his boyfriend.  They have a long distance relationship and to be honest, I am not sure if they are really together.  It seems to be a newbie relationship.  I don't really enjoy Chris or the guy he is dating, but I love the way that the other people react to them.  It is intriguing, thought provoking, and for the first time in a LOOONG while, I can actually understand what straight people go through when they see two homosexual men in an intimate setting.  It was almost too hard for me to watch...and Paul and I are much more intense then they are.  It was interesting. I got to thinking...is this how Paul and I come across?  I feel like we are totally normal, average guys.  But I guess one could argue that Chris and his boy are the same way.  This week's episode really made me think. Please, catch up with this show if you haven't seen in already.  It is really quite amazing. I am so glad that the weekend is almost here.  Gonna have some fun.  Gonna sleep.  Gonna do whatever the fuck I feel like doin.  FREEEEEEEEEEEEDOM!  And no work for a couple of days.   Thank the lord that he invented weekends.

      Tonight I am going grocery shopping for Kelly.  She left me money and an itemized list behind.  It is going to be kind of fun.  Like a Scavenger Hunt.  Cept I don't get any great prize after winning this "hunt".  Well, Kelly did promise to buy me a pack of smokes.  I guess that counts as a prize.  I just got this INSTANT MESSAGE from Rita.  It was all of these HUGE size grins.  It scared me and made me cry with laughter.  This is what it looked like:  :-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D

      Wow.  I have been pretty busy today.  Lots of work to do and so much more to go.  Last night, Kelly, Rita and I had a wonderful time together.  We originally planned on going to this local bar in Queens, but we never found it.  Then I had to piss real bad and forced us to go home as quickly as possible so I could relieve myself.  Ahhhh....it felt so good.  Kind of like an orgasm.  Funny how that is.   After the pseudo-orgasm, Kelly, Rita and I sat around and debated the career of Britney Spears, over a glass of wine.  We spoke on this topic for close to an hour, when finally we decided that Brit could really go either way at this point.  She will either end up as the next Madonna, or she will stay on the path that she is going and end up as the joke of modern society.  I was very impressed at Kelly's opinions on the subject.  She, being someone who adores the fuck out of Britney, was able to take a very neutral and open-minded stance on the future success of this popstar.  Kelly didn't feel the need to convince us of Britney's worth and thus opened up the conversation to new levels.  It was fun and I definitely enjoyed having a semi-political debate on Brit. Yesterday I felt as though Paul and I were doomed.  I was convinced that he and I were traveling down different paths and that the only possible end result was a nasty break-up.  I was so confused and scared.  I believed so much in the demise of our relationship that I was already planning what to say to him.  Then he called me at 1:30am and woke me up out of a deep sleep and was so damn adorable that I was able to find that spot for him that I thought was lost forever.  Damn, I am so not good at commitment of any form.  It scares the piss out of me.  And the other problem is that I follow my heart soley.  I never listen to what my head tells me.  I should try to combine the two, but I predominately go with what I feel.   I do love him.  Or at least I think I do.  But what do I do if I can't figure out how to move forward from the point we are at now?  Is he going to move here?  If so, what if we break up?  Are we ever going to get close enough that we actually make love?  If we don't, when will I ever lose my virginity?  I am almost 25!  :( So many things to riddle my brain.  I just wish that I had the capability of sitting back and letting go.  Cuz if I could do just that...who knows the levels that this relationship could break?

      I read this blogger earlier that was fucking disturbing.  It was this girl that wrote something to this effect: "So I haven't written in awhile (mind you this was the first entry she has ever made...I checked her archives) and a lot has happened to me.  First off, my mom, sister and cat died in a fire from toxic smoke.  Then I started getting these anxiety attacks and my dad says I should go to the hospital."  She continues on for a good while about nonsense and then ends it by saying: "Happy lollipops and oranges to everyone!"  WHAT THE FUCK?!?!?! Cuz I mean if your moms died (along with your cat and sister), you probably wouldn't sit down at your blogger right away.  Second, if you are the kind of person who would do sit down and write about it right away anyway...are you also the same type of person that writes at the end: "Happy oranges and lollipops to everyone"?  This girl is fucking whack.   I wish I could remember the web address, cuz you guys gotta read this shit.   People are crazy.  And what the hell is a "happy orange"?  lordy. I read another blog that was all in Chinese symbols.  Chinese people are weird. And I also don't understand the bloggers that are all links.  Such as: "Today was good...check this out: insert link." Or "I love pizza and here is something to think about: insert link".  Unoriginal, boring, and a waste of valuable web space.   But happy oranges to you! Almost time for lunch.  Cannot wait.  The day is actually almost over too.  That is wonderful news.   Tonight I am supposed to go get drinks with Kelly and Rita after work.  I haven't spoken to Kelly about it yet, so I don't know if we are going for sure.  I hope so.  Cuz after this long and excruciating day of hard labor, I should definitely celebrate with some booze.  I got this best friend necklace over the weekend.  It is one of those that have the heart split in half.  One side says "Joe Cuttheshit" and the other says "booze". Kelly is off seeing the smash hit movie "Crossroads" by the triple threat talent Ms. Britney Spears.  HAHAHAHA~!  I am happy that she gets to see it, cuz it is like all she wants out of life right now.  Good for her for sticking by her guns and seeing that thing despite all the flack everyone gives her.  But to be honest, if Justin Timberlake was in his own movie, I would be at the Sneak Preview.  Yum.  Timberlakes.  I think she is seeing the movie with Randall, the EX.  Dum duh dum dum. DUM!   Here is a song about Nouns:  (Sung to the tune of "Freir a Jacques" or the English version "Are you sleeping brother John?") "Nouns are people.  Nouns are places.  Nouns are things. Ruth. Rome. And Rings. Helen is a proper noun. Melon is a common noun. Use a capital - for the name Bill." What a great song.  I wonder if Britney will cover it in her new movie.   Latas.

      SO DAMN BORED TODAY.  I just can't get myself motivated enough to do anything.  It's not like my job is hard or even really time consuming...in fact, it is just plain dull.  I sit here and dream and hope that a hot guy will walk in and say: "Hey you.  Wanna go have some lunch together." But instead...Rita just sent me some real cool online sites to check out.

      "Ohh....back to work....back to work...to prove to dad that I'm not a jerk.  Back to work...back to work...can't believe that I am stuck in this shithole."  A little take off on the Billy Madison hit: "Back to School".  Wow I am tired this morning.  I think I am more tired now than when I woke up.  How does that happen?  Probably cuz I spent the subway ride with my head bowed and eyes sealed shut with sleep.  Sweated my balls off again in bed last night.  What is the deal?  I am constantly sweating.  No wonder I am always dehydrated.  I just can't keep up. Friday night, Paul and I went to SPLASH.  (My favorite gay NYC club)  I love this place.  I love it even more when I am not with Paul.  It is weird to go to a cruisy pick-up place with your boyfriend.  Especially when he makes me feel as though he is ONLY there to show me off.  I never feel like he really wants to be there to have a good time with just me.  Our conversations tend to suck when we are at a club just the two of us.  In fact, our conversations tended to suck all weekend.  We were very distant from each other.  Lots on my mind in that area...but I don't feel like going into that right now. Saturday night, my housemates and I went to see Urinetown: The Musical.  It was pretty good.  I definitely laughed quite a bit and the performances were excellent.  The writing was outstanding as well.  In fact, it was an overall good performance.  Kelly, Rita, and I thouroughly enjoyed ourselves.  Afterwords, we went out with Rita's boyfriend, Scott, and some of his friends.  I got fucked up!  It was fun and I spent a lot of time laughing and chortling.  Chortle.  ing.  Kelly and I acted as though we were 12 years old, ashing our cigarettes on these ugly bitches and stealing things left and right.  It was probably the funniest thing to happen all weekend.  Even funnier than Urinetown.   This guy Simon is in this play.  It is called Danton's Death or some shit.  It is funny to hear people standing around, in my office, and talking about it right now.  Considering that I think Simon is a piece of shit...I will not be attending the play.  Besides the fact that his pretentious attitude about theater will always keep me away from any performance he ever does (I mean...he went to a Conservatory, please!), until I start acting, I will not support those with speech impetiments and partial balding who are acting.  Or I can just be a huge bitch about it all...like I am doing right now.  So tired.   Found numerous jobs in the paper yesterday.  Gotta get my resumes and cover letter together tonight so that I can fax them out.  Must find new job immediately.  Or must figure out a way to sell things I own for money. Must.  M    U    S     T!

      Yesterday was Valentine's Day.  I was pretty excited cuz Paul and I have yet to actually spend a V-Day together.  It is also his birthday so it was even more special for him to come.  We had a wonderful time together.  Talking, hugging, etc.  However, we went to this restaurant call "Bill's Gay Nineties".  Now, according to the title, we thought we were in for a night of quiet, piano-bar style, dinner.  I pictured a bunch of old gay men dining.  Nope.  It was a bunch of old men alright, but they were homophobic and just plain mean to us.  Beginning with the coat check lady that stared at me the entire time like I had 3 heads (2 of which had massive deformities).  She literally STARED the entire time.  Even to the point in which I kept catching her and she would just continue to look in my eyes.  She was creepy.   Then they shove us in this corner next to the piano player and serve us watered down drinks at $9 a pop.  The steaks were majorly overcooked and the owners of the bar (2 old men and this old, fucking pretentious bitch) stared and laughed at us the whole time.  At one point I got up to have a cigarette at the bar, and this old fucker (like 75 old) grabs Paul by the arm and says: "What are you doing?  Trying to escape on the bill?" or some shit...Paul gets pissed!  And rightly so... I finish my cigarette and the bartender makes Paul a drink without even looking in his eyes.  He then slams the drink on the counter and walks away.  We were appalled.  Finally, we were half-way through our meals and we decided that we just had to leave.  Paul goes up to the woman owner and says: "You are rude and our steaks are overcooked and we want the check now."  The lady glowers at him and is like: "Fine." We get our bill, shoot nasty looks back at the owners, who are still staring at us and making comments to one another.  We did tip our waitress well, cuz she was the only one who had any sort of decency.  Then we got our jackets and tipped the coat lady one buck, cuz she was a fucking nightmare.   On the way out, they have this huge mirror on this display.  I gathered every amount of loogie in my throat and spit it all over the mirror.  FUCK YOU BILL GAY NINETIES.  Clean up a fag's spit. Paul and I did have a wonderful time together.  Thank God for that.  I fell asleep in his arms at like 11:30pm.  He said I sweat my balls off all night.  oops. He came on me without me even touching him.  Sometimes I can be sexy as fuck. hee. Today is "Pizza Friday".  This weekly ritual is something that I created for myself and allows me to start out my weekend on a tasty note.  I have to get at least one slice every Friday.  Kelly used to eat pizza with me on Fridays, before work.  Rita now has some with me usually.  But today, the devils (or her bosses - whatever term suits you more) are keeping her late.  So no pizza for Rizza.   Tomorrow night, Kelly, Rita and I commence to "Urinetown" the musical.  We will probably get drinks first and then off to a musical about public toilets.  NYC doesn't get any better than this.  Afterwords, we will probably go for more drinks.  Why does everything in my life revolve around getting drinks? It will be fun to hang with Kelly for once.  We haven't seen her all week.  It is like she has been away on vacation.  Cept that the vacation has been filled with massive amounts of homework, endless shifts at work, and rehearsals for a show she just started.  Goodness.  She sure is a trooper.  And a good girl. Last night, Kelly and her ex-girlfriend Randall spent some time with each other.  From what Kelly says they had an amazing time together.  I am so happy for her and for the fact that they can be around each other and not kill.  That is very difficult to do when you come out of a relationship of 2 years.  I know I couldn't do it.  They are both being very strong and patient.  I am proud of my babies.   So...Paul will be here soon.  Then Pizza and fun!  And maybe it will be a better lunch than last nights' dinner.  Only thing that could make lunch worse is if I got punched right in my fag face.  HA!

      Almost the end of the day and almost time for me to escape.   I had lunch today with my new boss, Jim.  It went wonderfully.  We had some great talks and I realized today how interesting of a person he really is.  I voiced my concerns about certain areas of my job and he totally listened.  He responded in such an assertive manner that it made me feel relieved that he took over the position.  He also paid for my lunch AND we each had two glasses of wine.  What is he?  The coolest ever?  Today, again, has been an overall good day.  No one getting in my face or bothering me. In other news...I have to go buy Valentine/Birthday gifts after work.  Paul is coming into town tomorrow and his birthday just HAPPENS to be on V-day.  Lucky bitch.  I am SURE that I will get nothing again for this holiday, just like I got for Christmas and our anniversary.  He always pays for me when we go out, etc.  But it would be nice if he could write a fucking card once in awhile.  Sorry....obviously this strikes a cord deep within my soul.  I mean, write a simple card sometime.  But I guess that is too much to ask.  Dick. I have made reservations at three different restaurants for tomorrow night.  I am not sure where he will want to go.  So I call him today at like 11am and say: "Please call me back today as soon as you can...I have a few questions to ask you".  (ie: which restaurant to go to...) And of course...the fucking asshole hasn't called back.   Good.  I will make the decision about where we go to eat and it will be Burger King. Case closed. I work with this guy that I will call Brian.  He is a really sweet guy.  And in fact, I hooked up with him for a solid two weeks when Paul and I were having problems.  He treated me really well at the time and made me feel like a god.  But then I realized that I don't like it when people kiss my ass.  I need them to provide some sort of a challenge.  And Brian was falling for me way too fast.  Now, we have this strange relationship in which some days we are best friends and some days we don't speak.  Gay relationships are weird.   Plus he has a HUGE donkey dick. OMIGOD...I think I might have gotten Mariah a possibility at a job when she gets here. I gotta go! Will explain later....

      I woke up in the middle of the night last night to find myself doubled over with the worst cramps?  Was it the first case of male period?  Male pregnancy?  Intestinal cancer?  No.  In fact, it was a mad case of the diarrehea explosion.  I ran to the bathroom and had the worst time.  Then this morning, I still feel like I gots to go, but there is nothing left.  And I feel that if I push hard enough, my liver and kidneys are bound to plop into the toilet.  ugh. Today I have to have lunch with my new boss.  He has been hounding me to do so for weeks now and I always cancel.  So I bite the bullet and do it today.  I am sure it will be better than expected.  It just sucks that I have to give up a lunch break to be with people I work with.  I hate that.  My lunch break is my free time away from this place I call BS. The Real World (Chicago) is fucking amazing.  It is quickly becoming my favorite Real World of all time.  And no, not cuz of the gay guy in it.  He is actually the weirdest shit I have ever seen on tv.  I, for the first time in a while, am obsessed with the straight characters, Kyle and Kerry.  They are struggling to not fall for each other, but it is only inevitable.  Kyle has a long time girlfriend, and refuses to cheat.  But whatever, Kerry is throwing everything at him that she can think of...and it is working.  He follows her around like a dog in heat.  Or maybe more like a gorilla in heat, cuz this boy has got a great body.  I love this season. OOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!  The cramps are killing me.  If I do turn out to be pregnant, I am giving the baby away.  I just can't fuck up my future like that.

      Quickly writing, quickly writing.  I have had a great day today.  I feel happy and alive.  I didn't have any sort of stupid-ass panic attacks today.  I didn't get annoyed at anyone today.  Work was very quiet and actually a pleasure to be at for like the first time in months.  Penelope is out sick today.  Good for her.  But how do I tell her that people are chomping at the bits for her to come back.  Everyone is like:  "Is Penelope coming tomorrow", and "Have you heard from Penelope."  NO EVERYONE!  Leave the girl alone!   Only about 45 minutes left of work.  Tonight is "alone" night.  Rita and I go our separate ways the minute we get home.  It is kind of fun.  I will probably sit on my ass and watch some tv.  Maybe do some light reading, singing, etc.  You know. Oh shit...the office supplies just arrived. OH SHIT.  I just cut my finger with the scissors.  I am now bleeding everywhere. YOWZAH!

      "I'm just sipping on Chamomile"...if I hear that damn song one more time...I kill.  I just spent an hour posting this blogger on numerous search engines.  Now, maybe, I will get some readers other than my loyal friends.  We shall see.  For those of you who don't know how to do this, but want to...I would check out the "How to publicize" tutorial that blogger gives.  Highly informative and pretty easy to figure out.   Now all I gotta do is figure out this "3-way action" situation.  I sure hope it don't have to do with lesbos and/or a menage a trois.  Sick.   ;)

      I just got done reading Kelly's diary.  There were some great entries in there.  She is dealing with quite a lot right now.  Overworked with school, work, life in general.  She is lonely and stressed and I am sure...very tired.  I feel bad for her that she has to go through all of this...and mostly alone.  Rita and I work the same job, have the same commute, and basically live the same lives.  I know that this fact is an extra stress on Kelly who feels left out, and like she is missing out on all the talks, the fun, and the changes that happen every day.  But how can I explain to her that she is making it worse for herself than it really is???  Rita and I do not spend the whole day laughing and giggling.  I am not sobbing every day and opening up my deepest secrets to Reets.  It just hasn't been like that.  We do spend a lot of time together, but that is OK.  I feel like I am doing something wrong.  And Kelly is just so upset about it that I don't know what to say to make her feel better.  It is never fun to be the one that has the opposite schedule, or a boyfriend that is long distance, or to be a second semester senior.  But we have all dealt with it at one point or another.  Or we are dealing with it right now.   Kelly is someone that needs to have people around to keep her sane.  Not people, but those that she loves.  She needs to expoud on her day, open her heart, and lots of times, she just needs hugs.  Kelly and I are very different.  I don't want to open my heart, or accept hugs.  I want to be left alone to my own devices, locked in my room forever.  But I love Kelly and I want to do what I can to make her feel better.   Right now I am also dealing with quite a bit myself.  I am depressed that my brother is gone, panicking over finding a new job, worried about my relationship with Paul, and somehow trying to find a way to escape the drama of every day life.  And at some point I should be an actor.   What I really need is no pressure right now.  I really need to not HAVE to do anything for anyone else.  Paul and Mariah want me to come visit.  My parents want me to come home.  I should be calling my friends from school, memorizing monologues, hanging out with my friends in NYC...and blah blah blah.  There is just so much.  So I have decided...actually made this decison awhile ago, that I am letting everyone else figure out their own problems for awhile.  I am not the problem solver.  I am not the one who HAS to make everyone else feel better in their life.  I refuse to do it.  I just plain don't want too.  If I have to deal with all my shit, than why can't you deal with yours?   This entry is in NO WAY reflective upon anyone in specific in my life.  It is just to let everyone else and mainly MYSELF know that I am living for me now.  If I don't want to visit you, I'm not going to.  If I don't want to go out with you, I am not going to.  If I don't want to stay up past 6pm, I am not going to.  I am living for Joe now.  And only Joe.  It's about time.  I need to get my life together, and I am having a very difficult time doing it when everyone needs something from me.  SO ahhhh...take a deep breath cuz it will all be ok.  And you Miss Cleo...can fuck right off!

      At work and praying that it will be 5pm before I even realize it.  Rita is filled with anxiety this morning.  I hate those days. When you wake up and even though there is nothing huge to be worried about you still feel as though you are going to crawl right out of your skin.  Tough mornings.  But we laughed and joked on the subway and I think that helped a bit.  We have a staff meeting today and that is cool.  It breaks up the day a bit.  Penelope doesn't feel well and will probably only be here for the meeting.  I don't think she should come at all...but I am sure that Rabbi dickhead is forcing her to be here.  Ugh. I feel like I have a permanent loog in my throat today.  Not a great feeling.  I want to cough it up so that I can stick it on Rita, but I can't seem to get it going.  I will suprise her with it later. So this week is Valentine's Day.  Kind of exciting.  What to do, what to do.  I should make reservations at a nice "gay"restaurant for Paul and I.  I don't gots much money, so I better get hacking on this problem quick.  Rita's boyfriend is coming to visit too.  He should be here by Thursday.  I know she is excited to see him.  Long distance blows a fat dick.  No.  Not true.  A fat dick is a good thing.   Long distance blows a spindly, veiny, pasty white penis.  Yeah, that's better. This weekend, Rita, Kelly and I commence to a viewing of Urinetown.  Saturday night.  We are looking forward to it.  We don't know much about the show and that's the best part.  Probably go for a few drinks first.  Then we will go to the show and piss on eachother.  Cuz of Urinetown.  I tell you, I will be damned disappointed if one of us don't end up covered in pee.  It's the whole point, right? So the monster that I work with named Doris tried to pull a fast one.  A rabbi from another organization came in and wanted a tour of the facility.  So I go get Doris, cuz that is part of her job, and she is like: "You know, this is just not a good moment."  I stand there staring at her, not leaving her office, waiting for her to get off her ugly ass and do it.  Eventually, she slams her shit down and gets up.  What a fuck.  Don't give me attitude cuz your life is speeding down the toilet of incompetence.  She's a fuck.  And worse than her being a fuck, she is ugly.  And she has bad clothes.  And she eats like a horse.  And if she EVER EVER gives me attitude over something again (something that is clearly her job), I will prolly spit or shit or jizz in her coffee.   No.  I really will.  This cunt's gotta go. Ahhhh....now I feel better.  So off to another day.  Fuck.  Can I get out of here soon please?????????

      Winfield's plane leaves in an hour.  I am pretty excited for him.  We had an amazing, low-key day yesterday with few tears.  There were tears, but they were reserved for the final goodbye.  Rita and I drove him into the city and met my parents and their friends.  Winfield and I hugged for a good 3 minutes straight.  I just didn't want to let go.  I felt like I was really letting go of him as a boy and when he comes back, he will be a man.  And maybe  by then I will be one too.   We spent the day playing cards and having a couple beers.  We got to talk and laugh and just be with eachother for the afternoon.  It was perfect.  There were a few moments yesterday, (after he left) that I felt like I was going to break down into hysterical sobs.  But I was able to breathe through it and find that bright side.  It's quite possible that I will see him again by the end of the year.  Maybe by Christmas?  Hopefully by Christmas.   Ironically, I woke up in an amazing mood today.  I feel ready to get out of the house and do something.  I feel as though I should act on this feeling and not wait for it to dissipate into the depression of a usual Sunday.  So I am driving Kelly to work in Lower Manhattan.  Then Reets and I will prolly have a few glasses of wine, watch a movie, and just relax.  Why can't every day be so simple and nice? Haven't heard from Paul since Friday night.  We got in a little tiff.   This was how the conversation went: Paul:  "Hi.  How are you?" Joe:  "Good.  We are in a cab going home." (We had just been to a cool party and bar with our friend Penelope) Paul:  "Cool.  So what are you doing tomorrow?" Joe:  "Well tomorrow is going to be a difficult day." Paul:  "Oh.  You have an audition right?" Joe:  (Anger at his ignorance rising to my throat)  "No, Paul.  My brother is leaving for Germany tomorrow.  And I haven't audtioned once since I left school (which he knows), so why would you say something like that?" Paul:  "Oh.  I forgot.  Sorry.  I thought you said that you wanted to start auditioning." Joe:  "Alright.  I gotta go.  Thanks a lot man." Paul:  (knowing he fucked up)  "Joe, I am sorry.  I didn't mean that.  I don't know why I said it." Joe:  "Well, whatever.  Thanks for the support." I hung up and was enraged.  Why the fuck can't he ever think of anyone, but himself.  I OBVIOUSLY don't need him to be there for me all the time.  But can he at least remember the big things that are changing my life?  I don't get it.  He is so self-centered.  (As we all are)  But if he can't give me the right words of encouragement or advice, can he at least remember that my brother is moving to fucking Germany?  Great boyfriend moment by Paul. And we have only been together for 2 years and a month.  Not that I am counting the time toward the demise of our relationship.   So he called once more that night and I just couldn't bear to hear anymore of his bullshit.  So we barely spoke.  He hasn't called since.  And I am surely not calling his sorry ass.  Why does he have to always put me on the defensive.  Fucking toolbox that he is.   Not even toolbox.  Insensitive to the point of no return would be a better saying for him.   In any case, I do feel good today.  And thank the lord that I don't have to rely on him for such emotions.   So that it.  Felt good to get that off my chest.  And what a nice chest it is turning out to be.  (I have been doing push-ups for 2 days in a row now)  I might have a man chest by summer.

      Well, I am home now.  Just spent the last hour trying to get a game of spades going on this damn computer and couldn't accomplish it.  So instead I write.  My parents and brother are on right now and we are having some interesting talks.  My mom is on the verge of a breakdown with my brother leaving and my dad is "barely holding it together".  This is tough.  Real tough.  According to Winfield, he is very excited for the move and isn't worried at all.  Now while this puts us all at ease for him, it doesn't take away the sadness.  I am so high strung these days and I just need Sunday to come.  What I need is for this anticipation period to be over.   I hate anticipation of any kind.  Even when it is good.  I am very spontaneous as a personality and I hate having to look forward to things or to wait things out.  I believe in solutions and making things immediately better.  Some days I just wish that I could go to sleep and wake up when the bad period is over.  I remember when I was little, praying to God that I would blink and time would just fly by.  I remember being willing to give up all the good memories that I would make in that time period, if I could just get through the bad thing that I was dreading.  For example, when I was in 5th grade...I participated in some sort of cafeteria shenanigans.  Somehow I was pinned and blamed for the entire thing.  (this is definitely a "somehow" cuz I was ALWAYS the good kid in school.  Never got detention, never got yelled at, always accelled)  So I got busted for the cafeteria bullshit and was told that I would have to sit in from recess for 3 days.  Those three days were the worst three days of my life.  But even worse...was the weekend that I had to wait out before my sentence would begin.  I remember that one night of that weekend, I had a dream that it was all over.  That I didn't really have to stay in from recess or that there was some big mix-up and my name was cleared.  In the dream I felt so relieved, so free.  However, I woke up and the punishment stood loud and clear.  I think it was the day I woke up when I created the theory of passing time with no recollection of what was really happening.  If I could just close my eyes and give up 3 days or 3 weeks or 3 years of my life to just get past that awful moment... That's how I feel right now.  I would give up today until Monday if it meant fast forwarding until after my brother left.  But alas...it is a stupid theory and totally impossible.  Impossibility being the reason for its stupidity.   In other news...I want to be a blog of note.  I think I am worthy of a blog of note.  (who DOESN'T think that?)  Not that being a blog of note is any great accomplishment or anything.  But why do we, as a society, have to always be recognized for the things we do. Why can't we just do them and appreciate it because it is for us and only us.  Rita does things for her and only her.  Why can't I?  Why can't you?  (p.s. Rita helped someone with their baby carriage up a flight of stairs the other day and told me that she did it cuz it made HER feel good.  So even REETS has this problem.)  So what is it with us people?   Just a thought...(but hopefully a thought that will make me a blog of note)

      Today has been a very difficult day.  Aside from the usual work bullshit...and there was about 10 tons of bullshit today, my brother's leaving finally hit me.  I lost it at work for a bit and had to step outside.  Rita was phenomenal about the whole thing.  She stopped everything she was doing to take me outside and to hug me.  She kept my shit together.  I love her and am so glad that she is here.  Life saver. I am about to go home and not a minute too soon.  Gonna go home and relax.  Answer no phone calls, write no emails, and be kind to not a soul.  Gonna have me some Joe time.  Will probably sing a bit.  Drink a bit.  Smoke a bit.  Maybe I will just go right to bed.  Got to kick this cold right in the ass if I can.  Have a big weekend coming up.

      At work today when I definitely shouldn't be.  Still feeling like dog shit.  And then when I came in, my new boss, Jimmy (also known as Otis Teef) says to me: "You should not have come in today."  FUCKING GREAT.  Cuz I DID come in today.  But whatever, must make the best of it while I am here.   I had this dream last night about Winfield's move to Germany.  Except in the dream, I was the one who had to get on to a plane and leave.  And I was terrified and didn't want to go.  It was really bizarre.  Especially since I ain't goin anywhere.  And he is leaving for so long.  I get these slight panic attacks at times when I really comprehend him leaving.  Makes me want to puke, kill someone, or kill myself.  I know it has to happen and no matter how I feel about it, I just have to suck it up and get ready.  Two days left.  ugh. This weekend, Penelope has invited Kelly, Rita and I to a party.  It is a Friday night "I hate Valentine's Day" party.  I don't really hate V-Day.  Cuz I have a boyfriend.  However, I remember absolutely despising it when I didn't have one, so I don't mind supporting my friends that are alone.  And I am definitely NOT one of those people that blame Hallmark for creating the holiday as a marketing strategy.  In my opinion, the only people that believe in this theory are people that have no one.   Paul is supposed to come visit again next week.  His birthday is actually ON Valentine's Day.  Weird.  It will be so great if he decides to come.  We haven't spoken for more than 10 cumulative minutes since he left last week.  That is fine.  I am actually doing really well with it.  I wish he could be a lot more supportive about my bro leaving, but I know for a fact now that Paul isn't going to ever become my support system.  There was a time when I wanted him to be my everything.  I wanted to cry to him, laugh with him, yell at him, and just plain open up to him.  But now I understand that there are certain things that he will never be able to give to me.  I don't know if I am okay with this now, cuz deep down I may be slowly getting over him, or I have just given up on him.  Either way it ain't so pretty.  Or maybe I am just in a good place with him.  I am confused.  Do I want him to move to NYC to be with me?  Do I want to be committed as much as I say I do?   He just sent me a text message that said how lonely he is without me...and that makes me stop for a second and wonder what I am doing here.  WHAT AM I DOING WITH THIS RELATIONSHIP???

      HOME SWEET HOME.  It feels so good to be home today.  I have done nothing but putter around with my dick in my hands.  I actually spend the first half of the day completely naked.  Talking on the computer naked, making phone calls naked, eating fried eggs naked.  What a day.  Why can't this blogger take off and support my nakedness?   Back to work tomorrow and that sucks.  But at least the week is almost over.  Gotta take more sick days in the future.   Cept next time, don't want to get sick for real. Tonight Kelly, Rita, and I are having dinner together.  We still haven't decided if we are going out for dinner or if we are staying in.  I must admit that I am partial to going out.  Cuz if not, it will be my sorry ass that does the cooking.   Gums bothering me again today.  Why the fuck won't this disease just go away forever???   I dread the day when one of my teeth feels just a little loose.  And then I play with it until it pops out all bloody.   And then I eat it. The cat has been bathing himself for like an hour.  What a priss.   I spoke with Mariah for awhile today.  I miss her like crazy.  She wants me to come visit soon, but there just isn't any time.  She is going through a rough patch right now.  I hate that we don't get to talk as much as we used to.  I hate not knowing every detail in her life.  She is a good girl and an even better singer.  She is the next, well...Mariah.  She has had a wicked case of tonsilitis the past couple of weeks.  She may have to have them removed.  That would be horrible. Mariah tells me that Paul is going crazy without me.  Bout time.  I have been waiting for him to be up my ass for 2 years now.  But once he is...will I still want him to be?  I hate being without him, but I hate not knowing if I can truly commit even more.  Nothing is ever perfect in the life of Joe CuttheShit.  Or for anyone for that matter.

      It is now so late at night.  Well at least for a Tuesday, it is.  But I am not going to work tomorrow, so it is all good.   I had the most amazing evening.  I spent the first half with Penelope.  Hanging out with her always makes me think.  I met this girl about a year ago and couldn't stand her for like 6 months.  We just didn't jive the way that I thought we would.  To be honest, I wanted to bullshit her the way I do with most people.  Just get through it and never make a personal connection.  Don't we all do that?   But I got to know her.  I got to understand her.  I got to see how real and vulnerable she is.  When you see someone's vulnerability, you love them.  It is impossible not to.  This girl is cool.  She is smart, quick, and she gets it.  Very few do, so when you find someone that does, you latch on for dear life.  When she speaks, I listen.  Her stories do take hours to finish, but she always has a point.  She is someone unlike a lot of people I have met.  But we have found a balance and I love that.  Finding a balance is the most important part of a true relationship. So I spent the first half of the night with Penelope.  It was great.  Her brothers are wonderful.  Great heads on their shoulders and totally loose.  I had an incredible time.   Enough of a good time to sit and "blog" about it.   The second half of the night was spent with REETS (Rita).  This girl blows my fucking mind.  I have known her for YEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRSSSSSSSS, yet every day is something new.  I can sit in a room with her and kill an entire evening with conversation.  I don't get it.  We have talks that break all natural limits.  I change as a person just from one talk with her.  She is someone I trust, love, and would sacrifce everything for.  I am just overwhelmed by it all the time.   Even with your best friends, you find that need to hold back.  To protect yourself.  But with her and Kelly, I really just let go.  These two are the perfect housemates.  The ones that I can cry to, scream at, collapse in front of...these two are my life.  With the exception of Paul.  But isn't it always "with the exception of Paul"?  These two are my dream.  Oh please.  We do have problems.  Someone is always being offended or left out or stuck with cleaning the dishes, but shit always works out.  We are a house based on honesty.  I must say that I vote for us for cabinet.  Senate.  Something important.   It was a great night that made me realize how important reaching out to others really is.  Once you risk...you are always rewarded.  I never believe in that theory, but whenever I do it, I am most pleasantly suprised.   The moral of this story is:  Love your friends the way you would love yourself.  Because they make you.  And you make them.  And together you are a bunch.  "The Brady Bunch."   I love you girls.

      I JUST FOUND A HUGE LUMP ON MY NECK!  I panicked for a good 10 minutes, feeling my face flush and my armpits fill with fear sweat.  Then I ran to Rita and said: "Please tell me I am not going to die."  Rita says: "I am not sure Joe, but it is probably a gland."  I walk away.  Then I run to Cleo and I say:  "Feel this huge lump on my neck."  Cleo says:  "Joe...stop it.  It is definitely a gland.  I get lumps like that all the time."  With the exception of the fact that this advice is coming from someone who is depleting all natural oils from her face, I trust her.  I have to trust her.  What else am I gonna do? I ain't cutting off half my neck.  Please God no.  I am becoming the most annoying hypochondriac.

      Another day, Another dollar.  No really...another dollar, cuz that's about all I make at my shit job.  At least I feel proud of my work, though.  PSHAW!  I am thinking of taking tomorrow as a sick day.  I don't feel so hot.  I mean, I feel good enough to come to work prolly, but I think I prefer to spend the day home recuperating from this hell-hole we call life.  I have the time, why not use it?  Last night I saw MTV'S Flipped.  It was the season premiere and it was fucking amazing.  Now, I am a little biased cuz I fully believe in MTV as a network that has phenomenal broadcasting.  The shows are great, the music is good, and the marketing strategies are just about damn near perfect.  So anyway, last night I saw FLIPPED.  The show was focused on a teen-girl smoker and teen-boy dipper.  You know, dip that goes into your mouth and rots away your face.  In the episode, they take these two teens and flip their worlds upside down.  They try to show them the negative affects of using tobacco.  And let me tell you, quite the powerful episode.  The premise of the show (on the girls' end) was that she was picked to be in a new USHER video.  She had no idea that her world was about to be FLIPPED.  In the "video" (and USHER did look damn good, of course) she was to portray a woman with emphysema.  To prepare for her role in the video, the girl had to meet with a woman who is 41 and dying of emphysema.  She was really upset by this experience.  Then to prepare for the last portion of the video, this girl was made to listen in on a woman being told that she had emphysema.  She stood, hidden in a closet, and listened to the entire conversation, horrified at what was being said to this stranger.  Then the doctor says to the girl: "Okay, come in and meet this woman so that you can see the face of emphysema."  The girl walks in and realizes it is her mother that was being told that she was sick.  YIKES!  I mean, it turned out that it was just a plot to convince her that tobacco kills.  And the most real part about it is that this girl's mother has been smoking for decades.  The two of them held and cried with eachother for awhile.  And so did I.  (Held and cried with myself)  The show was so effective.  Imagine the horror on this girl's face when she realized that her mother was the one being told she would die.  My friend Rita thinks that it is a horrible trick to pull on someone.  But I think that when it comes to something like tobacco, you need to scare people.  I have been smoking myself for just about 5 years.  And it is time to quit.  I am not going to have half of my face cut out due to cancer.  I am not going to lose my singing voice completely due to a smoke.  I am stronger than that.  We all need to quit.  OK?

      So Cleo just comes up to me and says:  "Did you go out last night?"  With my cutest smile and shit eating grin tendencies, I say: "Well it WAS the Super Bowl and I had to celebrate."  Little does this asshole know...I just drank for a full hour on my lunch break.  So you are WRONG Miss Cleo.  You predicted no ones future.  I drank an hour ago and you think it was last night.  Stupid fuck.  Oh.  And let me do the rest of your work for the afternoon.

      Rita and I just had lunch together.  We went to this little restaurant called "The West End".  Rita had a diet coke with lemon and I had 3 glasses of chardonnay.  We split the nachos.  Then we both came back to work.  Totally enjoyable.  It was nice to sit and just talk the two of us.  Doesn't happen all that often these days, even though we totally live together.  You know how it is. Penelope and I are trying as hard as we can to get through today.  Both of us want to up and quit as soon as feasibly possible.  I say feasibly, cuz hell...we don't get unemployment unless we get canned.  So here we sit, plugging away at our nonsense.   I feel a little bit better today than yesterday.  I am a wee bit more controlled.  But only a WEE.   Paul hasn't contacted me in days.  I fucking hate long distance relationships.  He sent me a text message from his cell phone this morning, which was sweet...but get on the fucking horn.  He had all weekend to call me and didn't.  It just bothers me.  My brother is leaving for 3 years and he hasn't even called to check up on me - to see how I am doing.  I need him to see how I am doing.  And I guarantee that he won't ask me a single thing about the situation, unless I prompt him to do so.  Which I definitely won't.  I hate having to teach him a lesson.  In fact, I am not really teaching him anything.  I have tried that in the past and it never works.  He...OH...fuck it.  I have had enough.   A fucking student...who is rather cute...needs some help with something.  He just pulled out a laptop and now I jizz.  He has a personal laptop?  That is kinda hot.  Especially when he is not hideous.   "I gotta go".

      I just got home from my weekend away.  Walked in the door about a half hour ago.  Put away my clean laundry, straightened up my room a bit.  Then took a shit.  I now sit down here to rid myself of some thoughts.  I spent the entire weekend in my house in Albany.  I actually never stepped foot outside the house the whole weekend.  It was really nice to just hang out and have no pressure to do anything.  Played a lot of cards with my family.  Drank a little bit.  Watched a couple movies and caught up on my Sex and the City.   It was sad to leave today.  Knowing that it is so close to the last time I will see my brother before his move to Germany.  We didn't really talk about much this weekend.  We actually just hung out and watched tv together.  Stayed up real late both nights just being in eachother's presence.  Sounds good, but I felt as though he wanted to talk about a lot of shit.  I just couldn't do it.  I couldn't ask him much about his fears of moving.  Or the fact that we aren't going to be in the same country.  I really don't know how to deal with this, so I just shove it all down and pretend like it isn't happening.  I am the king of that.  Yet  it eats me alive inside when I know that I should just deal with it and confront it head on.  But I am also afraid that if I do face it, I might fall into a sadness that I might not get out of for awhile.   Being someone who deals with erratic emotions and feelings of massive anxiety, I sometimes go into pure robot mode and deal with nothing.  Seems to be the only way that I can survive any emotional curve ball.  Deep down I am sad.  Real sad.  I possess major self-frustration.  I expect too much from myself.  I want to be the most perfect, healthy person ever born...but I find myself being completely the opposite almost every day.  How do I say to my brother...you can't leave me.  Just when we were starting to truly lean on eachother and be eachother's best friends...you have to up and leave.  How do I cry on his shoulder when I know that he needs mine to cry on?  Is it too selfish of me to run away when I feel like that is my best chance at surviving the shit that is threatening to tear me apart?  I hate crying.  I hate feeling low.  More than this...I hate the feeling of numbness that I experience in the midst of shutting myself down.  Does everyone go through this or is it just me?   I love you so much Winfield.  I wish there was a way for me to be just a little bit stronger.  So that I could call more, write more, hold you more.  But I can't.    Especially when I know you are leaving me.  Winfield leaves a  week from today.  I am counting on the old "Out of sight, out of mind" theory to get me through the next month.  I don't know how else to do it. I feel so empty inside.  What is wrong with me?  Why am I sitting here in this great big city and spending all of my days cooped up in my house?  Why have I not auditioned for anything since graduating college?  I, by far, am someone who takes on too much.  Who used to be so overly motivated that my biggest problem was finding a way to relax.  Now, I do nothing but sit and stew.  (And not the good stew with beef, carrots, and potatos)  God, throw me a bone.  Help me to feel confident and ready to start my career in the city.  Give me the strength and the ENERGY to find a way to break into this entertainment world.  Don't let me become that guy who let lack of motivation and fear keep him from ever going for his shot at fame and success.  I want it.  I taste it.  I dream it.  I believe in it.  What is the last piece of the puzzle?  Where do I find it?   Help me Jesus.  Make me a better man and a more focused individual.  I give you the glory, please give me the power.  Hold my hand and get me on the right track.  The days are going by and I need your help.

      So today I feel like shit.  I was super busy at work and I have aches and pains as though I do other things beside booze and smoke pot.  I leave at 3pm today to go home to see my brother, Winfield.  It is one of the last visits we will have before his big move to Germany.  I love my brother.  I have grown to absolutely adore him over the last couple of years.  We have always gotten along...well for the most part.  There was a 2 -year stint in highschool when he wouldn't even make eye contact with me in the halls.  I guess it was tough for a jock to have a fag brother.  But at least I was a popular fag brother. Oh.  And I was fat then.  I wasn't as svelt as I am now.  Svelt?  whatever to svelt.  Now, he and I get along so well.  He looks up to me and I do to him as well.  We are so completely different, but so much alike at the same time.  Plus, we are both studs that never have to share women.  So I guess that is a plus.  Having the whole family together (my mom, dad, and brother---small fam!) is always a bittersweet experience.  We all laugh and cry together.  We share our thoughts, our problems and our love.  It gets hard only because once I make it home, I never want to leave.  The chemistry between the members of my family is dynamic and powerful.  I love them all so much it hurts.  And now my brother is leaving for 3 years.   At least I am driving home for this adventure.  Greyhound has become my personal chauffeur on just about every trip I have taken over the past 2 years.  I fucking hate the bus and even more so...the fat asses that ride the bus.  Why is it that most people I end up sitting next to smell like tomato soup?  But today I travel alone.  Just me, the radio, and my thoughts.  It will be a nice time of peace.   The super bowl is on sunday.  Don't give a fuck about that. Update on the gums...still bothering me. Update on Paul...still wonderful.  Called me today and was as sweet as he could possibly be.  Makes me a lucky boy to have him.  As long as his fingers aren't up my ass to the point of anal bleeding.  Alright, I should cut out.  Cleo wants to spend the last 10 minutes of work talking my ear off about something foolish.  Prolly the fact that her face is about to fall right off due to the lack of moisture.   Hey, she didn't have that memorable of a face to begin with.

      So, two hours until I am on vacation.  Since it is Passover, we have half of Wed and all of Thursday and Friday off.  AWESOME.  Pays to work for a Jewish Organization when I am not Jewish.  While all of my co-workers will be attending Seders and doing the "holiday" thing, I will be doing the "Joe" thing and going to Boston to party like a rockstar.   At the last minute I invited Rita and Kelly to come with me.  Rita had plans to go to Syracuse, but they fell through.  So she will be coming.  Kelly, on the other hand, has to find a job.  She has got two full days to go out and see what she can do.  My hopes and prayers are with her cuz I know how badly she wants something good.  And she will be sorely missed. I think tonight we are going to a club called VAPOR.  It will be of the gay/lesbian nature and I am positive that Rita's straight ass will find a hot lesbian to spend the trip with.  IMAGINE?  That would blow everyone's world to bits. Paul has to work tomorrow night and I think I am going to show Rita around Boston a bit.  I want to take her up to where Kelly and I use to live.  Then I will probably swing by good ole' TGIFriday's to show Reets where Kelly and I worked.  I don't think we have any other big plans, but it will be nice to get away.  And Rita has never even been to Boston before.  She is afraid that she is going to like it too much and not come back to the city.  I'll let her stay and live there if she really likes it.   (NEVER) I really wish Kel could go.  She loves Boston and hasn't been back in awhile.  She has a friend in town; one of her old roommates from Binghamton.  Binghamton, remember those days?  Damn, that place was cool.  And their dining halls were just faboolous. (orbit gum) So this is just a quick entry to say "Sayonara" to everyone in NYC.  I should be back on Friday, with Paul in tote.  We are spending Easter here as opposed to me staying the weekend in Boston.  Cuz if I stayed in Boston, we all know that I wouldn't be back on Sunday.  I would be back Monday or Tuesday and then my ass would be in some trouble.  Happy Passover!!! Chag Sameach! or sumptin. Thanks P for my lil' present this morning.  It will make the trip even that much cooler.

      When I walked in the door tonight, I found a note on the table from Kelly.  The note said to open up the I-Movie program on the computer and to see what she made for Rita and me.  I did.  I was not expecting to see what I saw. Kelly put together a 5 minute movie based on film she had taken over the last couple of months.  She put a song called "Beautiful" with it.  I sat and stared at the movie and during the last 30 seconds of it, I burst into some heavy tears.  This "piece" that she put together touched me so deeply that I still don't really know how to take it all  in.  The movie is supposed to represent what she is feeling right now based on what she is going through.  Rita and I haven't seen much of Kelly lately and it has bothered us all.  Mostly Kelly.  She is alone.  She goes to school, work, rehearsal, out with friends; she does homework, goes grocery shopping, baby-sits dogs, and finds a way to make it through her day.  The lonliness that she is feeling is consuming her and in a lot of ways I feel like it is somewhat my fault.  I haven't been the best friend that I should be lately.  I have been living for me and just assuming that she will be alright.  I don't check up on her often and I let her go through her day alone.  We do have different schedules, but I feel like it is no excuse.  She is developing into this person, this adult that I don't even recognize anymore.   It seems that when she has a night off all I want to do is go to bed.  When she has a weekend off, I find myself in bed until late in the day.  I have been absent and it is definitely hurting her.  I have been hurting her.  And I know it now.  I love her in a way that is impossible to explain.  She and I have been through lovers, cities, friends, jobs, tears, anger, just about everything together.  We laugh at the same jokes, say the same things, give advice in the same way.  We even "came out" at the same time.   Sometimes I feel like I need to take care of her.  It scares me a bit.  I am not even good at taking care of myself.  I try to tell her to be "independent".  I tell her to "just do it and it will all work out in the end".  Do I tell her these things because I truly believe it or because I too scared to take responsibility of being her best friend?  Kelly definitely needs more to survive than I do.  I shut down and move forward.  Kelly shuts down and loses everything.  She is better than that.  She has a heart that won't allow her to ignore the way she feels.  She is driven by it, thrives on it, and knows nothing but to go by the advice it gives her; which is to be honest and real.   I have a very hard time doing that.  I have done some bad things.  I have made some mistakes.  I haven't been there for her during her time of need and I know that.  I ignore it and hope it will just fix itself.  But that is so wrong.  It is immature.  And mostly, it is selfish.  The worst part about it is that my actions have caused distance between her and myself.  It has made her believe that she is alone in the world and that she must learn this lesson to live in the world.  This is what I believe.  But this isn't who she is.  I know better than that.  I have known her forever and I know what she needs as a friend. I feel awful.  It shouldn't take something like an I-Movie to wake me up  and realize what I have done.   I know that I am not the answer to Kelly's problems.  I am not the one that can make it all better.  Only Kelly can do that.  But I can listen.  I can be there physically for her.  I can be the friend that she thought I was.  I still am that friend.  But I have focused on me.  Too much so.  Kelly will get through all this.  But how frustrated and upset will I be when I realize that she can do it without me?  I don't want that.  I don't want her to succeed without me holding her hand.  I want to be there to support her in everything.  I want to know everything that is going on with her and I want to be able to look at her again and know what is going wrong without even having her open her mouth. I apologize Kelly.  For not being the friend that I can be.  I am sorry for distancing myself, cuz we both know that you didn't do it.  I did.   When I get back this weekend from my "mini-break", things are going to change.  I promise you that.  We will make time for us.  Even if it just means sitting in a room and being with eachother.  I will still be sitting there.   You are my sunshine.  You are my heart.  You are my light.  I see what part of the problem I can fix, and I will do it. Be strong and go forward.  Deep down you have all of this together.  You have been made to feel alone and that will change.   I love you so much and I see what I can do to make this better.  Believe in me because I have always believed in you.

      Gosh.  It is so busy at work today.  It is Passover time and my job is run by the Jewish.  ;) With it being Passover, there are students here selling their Chametz.  I don't even know if that is the word.  Plus, we are planning Seders and also taking care of the normal business.  Penelope and I are out of our minds today.  But it makes the day go faster and I like that. Mariah just called and firmed up the plans for my trip to Boston tomorrow.  I am very excited.  She is actually leaving for Colorado on Thursday.  I am bringing her to the airport and waiting there with her until she gets her scared little ghouls on that plane.  Poor thing.  I would be terrified, but I know she will be ok.  How exciting!  She never gets to go anywhere.   Has anyone heard the new song by Vanessa Carlton?  I love her!  I believe that she is supposed to be my new girlfriend, but I had to break her heart last night.  You see, it is about 11pm last evening and the phone rings.  This is what happened: Me:  Hello? Vanessa:  Hi.  Is Joe there? M:  This is Joe.  V:  Joe, it's Vanessa.  How are you? M:  Vanessa!  Wow.  I was just listening to your new song.  What's up with you?  It's been too long. V:  I know.  I have been so busy, what with the new music career and all. J:  Yeah, I know how it is.  I had to do this duet last week with Mariah Carey.  Oh, she can be such a pain in the ass. V:  Right?  I try to avoid her as much as possible.  Look, I need to talk to you about something. J:  Sure, go ahead.  I have a few minutes. V:  Well, you see...I was kind of thinking that we could be boyfriend and girlfriend. J:  Oh Vanessa...I...um...gee...well...the thing about it... V:  What Joe?  What are you trying to say?  Don't you love my new song????? J:  Well, uh...I actually do.  But Vanessa, I am-  V:  Not interested?  What?  Am I too young?  Am I too pretty?  Am I not worth your time? What is it Joe?  WHAT IS IT? J:  WOW!  Vanessa, can you just hold on a sec? V:  Fuck you Joe.  Fuck you. CLICK! Then she just hung up.  Damn.  Girl's got a temper.  I was just trying to tell her that I am gay.  But she just wasn't having it. Please, still go out and buy her cd.  She didn't mean to act the way she did.  Bitch just fell in love with me.

      So who knew that Wil Wheaton has his own Blogger?  Well Rita did!  I immediately went and read some of it.  He is a fucking moron.  He really does think that he is so cool and accomplished.  FYI Wil...you is ugly.  Stupid and ugly.  And oh...FYI...don't forget...you are a dork too! He was so cool back in the day.  Remember  Stand By Me ?  Remember...hey...what else cool did he do?  I don't think anything.  But I could be wrong.

      When Halle Barre won the Oscar for  Monster's Ball , she made history.  When she gave her speech, she truly became a legend.  I am not a huge Halle fan, but after re-reading her speech today, she has warmed my heart.   Here is an exerpt: " This moment is so much bigger than me. It's for every nameless, faceless woman of color that now has a chance because this door tonight has been opened. I am so honored, I'm so honored, and I thank the Academy for choosing me to be the vessel from which this blessing might flow ." Now you see what I mean.

      So I came in to work today and got the most amazing suprise ever.  Paul called me at like 9:15am.  Which he never does!  If he calls me at work at all, it will be around 4pm.  But this morning, the phone rings and its him.  I was very shocked.  He was actually on his way to work a double.  Ugh.  I remember those days.  For the am shift he will be shift leading the floor.  Which means he will be a waiter.  And on top of that, he will be in charge of the entire morning staff.  He hates working on the floor and I don't blame him.  Once you go bar you never go back.  Or something like that.  Tonight he will be shift leading the bar.  GOSH!  What a good boy.  He like runs the store.  But anyway...he calls and I say to him, "So when are you working this week?"  He says: "Actually I took the week off so that I could be with you."  WWWWWHHHHHAAAAATTTTT?  I don't think that has happened ever since he and I have been together.  The kid works ALL the time; even when I come for a visit.  I usually get one night with him and one night with Mariah.  Or one night with him and one night alone.  But this week...something happened and he is going to spend the majority of the time with me.  It made me feel so loved.  I couldn't stop saying "thank you".  YAY!

      I am actually very nervous to see Paul this Wednesday.  I don't know why.  Every time I think of seeing him, I get butterflies.  I was at lunch a little while ago and every time he crossed my thoughts, I found myself feeling like I was going to yack.  What is the deal?  I actually tested this theory.  I would sit with a french fry in my hand.  I would then look at it longingly and with hunger.  Then to test my theory, I would think of seeing Paul in Boston on Wed., and my stomach would knot up lickety split.  Lickety?  I'm gay. It's weird.  Why is my subconcious freaking out?  Maybe I just love him. Alot.

      What a fucking day.  It's funny, cuz on the way in this morning, I say to Rita, "Today is going to suck."  She's like: "Yeah, I have that pit in my stomach."  Boy were we right.  On top of Penelope not being at work today, EVERYONE has shit they need either Rita or I to do.  People are being assholes, and the work load seems to just increase and increase with each hour.  Thank our stars that we only work a half week.  Cuz ugh!  What a way to start.     I must say that this weekend was just about the best.  On Friday, Rita went out for drinks with our friend Stacil and ended up coming home at like 8:30pm.  I got up from my hungover nap around that time, and we decided to have a glass of wine and just catch up.  Next thing I know, it is 3am and I have to go to bed to get up for my parents.  Ugh.   Saturday was such an incredible day.  My parents showed up around noon and they were in great moods.  We took the subway to Ground Zero.  I hadn't been there yet and I really wanted to go down there at least once, to just see what happened in real life.  Watching the devastation on tv just doesn't give one the reality of it all.  It was extremely upsetting and I found it hard to be there.  For the most part, the site consists of a giant crater.  There is very little rubbish left.  The damage is unbelievable, but they have made some major headway in the cleanup.  There is a iron cross standing inside the whole.  It was part of the building that the construction workers sodered off and made into a cross.  Kind of like a memorial.  It was beautiful.  Of course, there were people all around gawking at the hole and taking pictures.  But everyone was silent.  Not a sound in the group.  It was just so much.  Then my parents and I walked to the West side of the site and stood between the hole and the Statue of Liberty.  We were standing right next to the water and it was so serene.  We were the only people there.  Kind of like a ghost town.  My dad pulls out this poem and gives it to me.  It was one of the most beautiful things I have ever read in my life.  It was a feeling like I could never explain - standing next to this devastation on one side, and on the other, the freedom and comfort represented by the Statue of Liberty.  My parents took full advantage of this moment by giving me the poem.  Then my dad pulls out a check for my headshots.  He paid for the entire thing.  He told me that this money isn't a loan or an early birthday present.  It was a gift because they believe in me and believe that I can do this acting thing.  I was so overwhelmed.  I think I hugged them both for 10 minutes before letting go.  Gosh.  It was a moment that I will never forget for as long as I live.   After that, we went to Park Avalon and had glass of wine.  They loved doing it.  We have never just gone out for a drink before.  And there we were, 3 adults laughing and joking and just loving eachother's presence.  I love them more than my heart can handle.  Later that evening, Kelly, Rita, my parents, and I played some cards, discussed about a thousand different political and religious topics.  It was amazing.  Kelly, my dad, and I stayed up until almost 3am discussing salvation other religious things.  It was mind blowing and powerful!  I think I finally got in bed around 4:45am.  On Sunday, I woke up with some form of the flu or hangover or some shit.  Probably because I spent 3 full days getting fucked up.  I think I need a couple days to recuperate and to get my energy back.  Especially since I am supposed to go to Boston on Wed.  If I were to leave today, it would take all of my energy to even get to the bus station. Long long long wonderful couple of days.  But now I feel sick.   Ok...I guess that is it.  Really don't feel like writing today, but I wanted to get some of this in here while it was still on my mind.

      Oh my goodness.  Last night was fucking amazing.  I slept for literally 3 hours and now I am surely paying for it.  I think I finally closed my eyes at like 5:15am and woke up BEFORE my alarm at 8:10am.  Then I immediatley got up and got in the shower.  Damn.  Felt like I was on another planet.  My head was buzzing, my stomach cramping, all of the usual things that a normal sober kid like me feels in the morning.  SIKE! I hung out with Penelope last night from like 6pm-2:30am.  I just went over for a little bit and then there I was drinking my face off and talking a mile a minute for like hours!  Poor thing was such a good sport about it all.  She was willing to stay up as long as I wanted to stay.  And I just wanted to keep hanging with her.  We talked about everything from work to love to goals to funny family stories.  Oh man.  It was just such an incredible time.  We were so in sync with eachother.  I drank like a monster and smoked way too many cigs.  But I laughed and laughed and really enjoyed every possible second.  The most incredible thing was that Penelope has been dying to show me who this next door neighboor of hers is that she had sex with.  We talk about him all the time.   At least for like 8 months or something.  She writes about him in her blogger quite frequently.  She uses the name "Dick" for him.  How appropriate.  So, she and I are walking to get some wine and some cigarettes when lo and behold...there is Dick walking down the street with these grocery bags.  We both about have heart attacks, cuz there he is!!!!  He stopped and said hello and was very uncomfortable.  I think he thought that Penelope and I were hooking up or something.  He was very nervous.  She and I loved it.  He is very attractive.  I hated his hair so much I could have shaved it off on the spot.  He was balding in the front, but had a beautiful long mane of blondish locks in the back.  Pukerific!  But he had a HOT face and a nice little body on him.  Penelope said he usually dresses better than the tapered jeans I saw him in, but I just gotta see it to believe it.  He does work on Wall Street so I am sure he doesn't look 80's all the time.  Either way, I was SO elated to finally put a face with the name.  We have waited FOREVER for this moment.  It was so great!  So, we have decided that if we do bump into him again, Penelope and I are fully having sex and he is made to feel like he is missing out and must jump on the "I cheat on my girlfried" bandwagon again.  Here's to us... Thanks again P for the great night.  It was so awesome!!!! Tonight I will probably spend in bed.  My parents are coming tomorrow and I want to be at least a little rested up for them.  Rita and I have a friend coming into town named Stacil.  She is great and I haven't seen her in forever, but her visit is so last minute and I treated last night as though it was my Friday night.  As the day goes on, the hangover increases.  ROCK! Work today is fucking dragging on.  At least I am finally out of here in like 15 minutes.  I have been watching the clock on my computer screen casually tick on by for what seems to be a duration.  "Please release me....let me go." - sung to the tune of, um...er..."Please release me, let me go".   When I got home last night...I called Paul and we talked until the fucking crack of dawn.  I was speaking a mile a minute on so many different things.  He was INCREDIBLE with me.  Hearing me out on everything, being objective, and being my totally adorable little ghouls!  LOVE HIM!  I know that in the beginning of the conversation he was tired and probably wanted to go to bed, but he knew I couldn't sleep and volunteered to stay on the phone with me until I did.  I love him for that.  Also, he owed it to me after not talking to me cuz of "Queer as Folk" the other night.  ;) It was a special conversation and I will never forget it.  For a lot of reasons. So all in all last night was just the tops!  I loved my friends, I loved my boyfriend, and I loved this city.  I felt so New Yorkish going home in a cab at 2:30am.  On a THURSDAY!!!  ;)    I am a whore and I eat it up. Today is Pizza Fridays!  Yum.  And today of all days, I really need pizza.  This belly is empty and worn out.  Time to get some good New York nourishing inside of it.  Cannot wait.  Half hour until I am shoving my face.   SLURP! Here comes the weekend.  Open up and say: "YUM!"

      Hello world.  Today is a beautiful sun shinin day!  I like that.  Always better than the freezing drizzle that has been our lives this week.  Rita and I had lunch at the West End today and ate outside!  Wow.  We never get to do that.  It's great.  You can smoke and smoke till your lungs content and then throw the butts at the homeless guy that is obnoxiously asking for money while we are eating.  It's kind of a game.  If you hit them in the back, you don't get as many points as if you hit them square in the forehead.  But that takes skillz.  Juxt kidding.  But hells if I gave that guy money.  Hells. I spoke with my brother a couple minutes ago.  It was good to talk to him.  I told him of my plans to consolidate my bills and my method for doing so.  He was like: "No Joe.  Bad idea.  Why can't you just keep doing what you are doing now?  This is not going to work."  Ok...shut the fuck up, because you really have no idea what this is like for me, on top of the fact that he has no idea what it is like to be in debt.  Bitch has no bills and just got a new car.  Year: 2002.  So, I don't want to hear your shit.  It just kind of pissed me off.  I like his objective opinion...always.  But he really shouldn't have an opinion on this subject, cuz he doesn't know how to identify with it on any level.  Ugh.  He just made me doubt myself and now I am frustrated again.  I felt so good for a couple days, cuz I felt like I had a plan.  Now, I still have a plan, but he made me worry.  Stupid, rich, army boy brother.  Thanks a lot. What else....I am going to Penelope's today to have a glass of wine with her and to get my mom her stinkin pot.  (Like I won't be smoking the pot right along with her)  My parents will be here Saturday, so I gots to take care of business today.   Right now, I am chowing on a plate of freezing cold french fries.  Oh Joe.  Cut the Shit!  Pretty soon, I am going to be the size of a house, and I am going to have grease shooting out of my pours.  Ooh.  That sounds tasty! My intestines are raging today.  Raging against the machine I call my body.  Feel like I gotta shit, but I don't.  So what the fuck is up with that.   Penelope had a short, but great entry in her blogger today.  She is pondering the idea that she is now 30, but doesn't quite understand how that happened.  Please go visit and read today's entry:   urlLink Penelope's 30th bday entry  So lately, my gums have been doing a little bit better.  It's funny, cuz I haven't been using the baking soda for a couple days, so I have to make sure to rinse with it tonight.  Just to keep it all going smoothly.  I haven't mentioned my stronger gums to anyone in a couple of days, cuz every time I bring it up, they tend to crumble in my mouth again.  So shhh.....some day they will be perfect again.  I just know it! Next week will be Passover.  I just love Passover.  At my job, I get 4 full days off for this holiday.  And since I am not of the Jewish persuasion, I don't have to go to Shul (Synagogue) or clean out my house, or fast or anything.  Actually, I don't know if you have to fast, but I won't anyway, just to prove a point.  And days off!!!!!!!!!  Rock.  I am going to Boston, yet again, to visit my boy.  I miss him so much these days.  Just need to get there and hold him for a bit.   Last Friday night, Paul and Mariah were at this club and this fucking asshole (which I hope dies very soon) started to harass Mariah about why she wasn't interested.  Well, first clue to him could be that he is fucking ugly, but second clue definitely is that she was at a fucking lesbian bar!!!!  Anyway...the guy is harassing Mariah and Paul asks him (I am SURE politely) to leave her alone cuz she is not interested.  This DICK continues to harass Paul and Mariah for the rest of the time at the club.  So they decide to leave.  As they were walking back to the car, the asshole follows them saying: "I just want to talk and settle this."  Paul says:  "We have settled this, please just leave us alone."  Asshole follows them right to the car and the girls jump in and Paul tries to get into the back seat.  The guy grabs the door to the car and is like: "Get out of the fucking car."  Paul, of course, didn't and when he turned to try to reason with the guy, this fucking ugly stupid mother fucker prick kicks him on the side of his face!!!!!!!   He split Paul's lip and gave him a huge egg near his temple.  :( Then of course, like the real pussy he is, he runs away down the street.  MAN! Had I had been there, or if I EVER see this asshole (I know who he is from past visits to Boston) there is going to be a major...MAJOR problem.  Mariah told me on the phone that she and Paul were so happy that I wasn't there.  Cuz I would have gone fucking ballistic!  I may be small, but I can go crazy like the best of them.  So I am on the hunt for this fuck.  If I ever, EVER see him on a visit, he is fucking dead.  The anger and sadness within me about this situation makes me so fucking insane.  This shit should not happen.  And especially not to such passive and loving people as Mariah and Paul.  So, I need to go to Boston and be with my baby.  Poor thing.  He is so mature and responsible to just walk away.   I am not.  :) ever.   You don't fuck with me and you DEFINITELY don't fuck with the people I love.  Well, you can, but then I find any way that I can to deform you for the rest of your life.  ROAR! So, Paul will be coming back to NYC on the Saturday before Easter.  He and I are going to go to church together and then have a nice Easter dinner.  It is the only holiday that we get to spend with eachother, what with us both having to go home for Christmas and Thankgiving.  I am really excited.  We are going to go to CHURCH together.  I haven't been to church in such a long time.  TOO LONG.  And it will be so wonderful to go with my boyfriend.  (big sigh) Can't wait to see his little ghoulie face!

      Wow.  What a day.  It started out so horribly and is actually turning out to not be so bad.  I think the day turned itself around when I shoved my face with pizza at Penelope's work party.  Everyone was in a really great mood, despite the weather.  And I am a royal fat ass today.  I ate Lo Mein at 10:30am and then two slices of pizza.  And then I went to a local deli and got a cup of corn chowder.  My appetite is voracious and insatiable today.  I almost ate Penelope, but she ran away too quickly.   Now I am full of food and my stomach has exploded into this mass of flesh.  Will someone please help me help myself? The day is almost over and I am so ready to go home.  Imagine if I was like, "Oh please, I would love to spend another hour here today."  Yeah...you can also imagine a million dollars falling out of my asshole.  Ooh.  I like that fantasy.   So I spoke with my father last night for about two hours on the phone.  It was such a beautiful conversation.  He spent more than half of it in tears over one thing or another.  He is such an emotional guy.  I love it.  He confides in me, he trusts me, and even more importantly, he loves me so incredibly much.  I appreciate him in a way that I will never be able to convey to him.  He's my hero, my father, and my joy.  He is going to get involved with my uncles and in a lot of ways, I feel like he should.  Long story, but he may really be able to help fix this misunderstanding that I am having with them.  I guess I will just wait and see what happens.   I just spoke with Paul.  He was pretty damn cute.  Sometimes he gets this laughter that just makes me want to smush him with love.  It's like: HAR HAR HAR!  I love it so much.   Last night he fucked up.  I called him at like 10:30pm (returning his call) and he didn't answer.  I called and called until 11pm, cuz I really wanted to talk to him.  So I finally get ahold of him at like 11pm.   Here is how the conversation went: J: Hi.  How are you? P: Hi.  You going to bed? J:  No.  What's going on? P:  Nothing.  Just eating dinner.  You going to bed? J:  Um...no.  I have a little bit to talk. P:  Well, maybe you should get some rest. J:  EWE.  What is the deal?  Why are you making me go to bed? P:  Well, you see, Queer as Folk is on and I really want to watch it.  I will call you at 12am if you are still going to be awake. J:  (Deleted expletives) ARE YOU SERIOUS?  I MEAN, WE HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO EACHOTHER SINCE LAST FRIDAY AND NOW A TV SHOW IS MORE IMPORTANT....BLAH BLAH BLAH....(more screaming)....and BLAH! P:  I am sorry Joe.  I just want to watch the show. J:  Fine.  I am being a dickhead and I am sorry.  I just really wanted to talk to you and I see now that our conversation isn't that important to you.  You don't have to call me when the show is over.  I am going to bed. P:  I will try you after the show.  Promise.  Hope you are ok. J:  Fine.  Goodnight.  P:  Bye So, I call back about 10 minutes later and leave a message on the answering machine that went something like this: "Don't pick up the phone (not that he would have anyway).  I am going to bed.  I apologize for getting angry with you.  I just really wanted to talk about what happened to you this weekend and what happened to me yesterday, but we will catch up on it later.  If you want, please give me a call after the show and maybe I will still be awake to talk.  If not, you can call me tomorrow.  I love you and hopefully I will still be awake when you call." Being the amazing boyfriend that he is...he didn't call back.  Of fucking course.  ;) But he did call just now and I am not angry at all.  I wasn't even really angry last night.  I just flipped out cuz I felt like that is what I was supposed to do.  Have you ever done that?  I am so used to being the crazy one and last night, even though I wasn't in the mood to be crazy, I forced myself to curse him out.  (big sigh)  The trials and tribs of being a psycho.  You never know how to be.  So that is it.  Those are my stories for the day.   It is now 4:55pm and I am so out of here, it's ridiculous. not so ridiculous.

Makes me wanna...shoop, shoop day doop, shoop day doop, shoop day doop day doop day shoop. Just don't really feel like blogging today.  So, FUCK! I just remembered that I was supposed to call my mother this morning before 11am.  DAMN!  I totally forgot.  I don't know why singing Salt N Peppa made me remember, but still....damn.  I really meant to call her. She was so good to me last night when I talked to her about the letter of doom from my uncles.  She handled it all so well and really made me feel loved.   I would do anything for my mom.  She is the greatest woman alive.   :(   Wish I had called.

      One more hour until I can go home and get right back in bed.  So excited.  I am going to sleep my face off tonight and lay naked and roll around in my sheets until I am good and satisfied. I miss Paul tremendously today.  Especially after everything that happened with my uncles this morning. He is a gift to me and I wish I could have him here all the time. :(

      The world is full of selfish bullshit today and I want no part of it.   Sometimes it is just easier to lock yourself in your bedroom. Sometimes it doesn't pay to be a friend to someone cuz it is always about them. Most times I don't want to be the listener, but I take on the role almost automatically. Usually I repress everything that upsets me until I hurt someone as much as they have hurt me. Often, I want to tell people to SHUT THE FUCK UP for once. I am really trying to work on my patience level.  But it can be very difficult.  Almost impossible.

      What a weekend!  I am so exhausted from it, right now I could collapse on my keyboard and sleep comfortably for at least 6 hours.  It is one of those days where I just can't wait to get home and climb right back into bed.  It is so warm and cozy in my bed and this world is so dreary and freezing today.  Why not spend a day in bed?  WHY?  Because I have to do this damn thing called "work".  Damn that thing. I was lucky enough to start my day off in a horrible way.  About a month ago, I sent my uncles (the gay ones), in California an email explaining my fears of visiting them this summer.  (They had previously invited me out there for a mini-vacation)  In the email, I was very aggressive and maybe a little too forward in what I had to say to them.   They took what I was saying and turned it completely around so that it made it seem like I was viciously attacking them.  I was startled to log into my email this morning to find a rude, hurtful, and rather bitchy email from them.  These guys are 50 years old right?  I didn't know that bitchiness could come out of people when they were this age.  But I guess with gays, bitchiness can always come out. Here is the email exchange: (edited for time and boringness quality)  The reason I called you a couple weeks ago is because I wanted to talk about the trip to SF.  First, let me just THANK YOU for the amazing invitation.  I was shocked and thrilled to find out.  You are both so generous and kind to me always and I truly appreciate it.  I know I don't get to see you that much and that is difficult.  For a number of reasons.  But mostly, just because I want to get to know you better and I want your advice at least 12 times a day about whatever it could be that is on my mind.I have been thinking a great deal about the trip.  I am having some major hesitations about coming.1)  You know I don't want to fly.  I am terrified.  More than terrified actually.  I am so scared that it is very likely I won't come at all due to this intense anxiety that I am feeling.  I know that the chances of a crash or a terrorist take-over are very unlikely, but I still can't fathom having to get on to a plane by myself.  Especially since I have only flown twice in my life.  Once to visit you guys and once for Winfield's graduation.2)  You told me that you want me to come alone.  I don't know if I can come alone.  I don't want to fly alone.  I really don't.  And more importantly, I would really want Paul to come with me.  He and I have discussed a visit to you long before you invited me.  LONG before.  And it is an experience that I want to share with him.  I understand you guys wanting to spend time with me.  Alone with me.  I want the same from both of you.  But with my fear of flying (alone especially) and the fact that Paul would give anything to come...I don't really know how to go forward with this.3)  When I had the conversation with you guys over Christmas about the visit, you said something that really upset me.  You told me that we would "go out" while I was there, but that I was "not allowed to bring anyone home".  You also made it very clear that I was to "come visit alone".Now, this hurt me because I feel like you don't really know me at all.  And on top of that...I feel like no one really knows me in the family.  I have been with Paul for over 2 years now.  It is a strong, beautiful, difficult relationship that no one in the family has taken five minutes to consider.  Mom and dad do the best they can, but they talk more positively about Winfield's sexual flings than they do about the boy I am in love with.  The boy that I have never even had intercourse with.  It hurts.  And it pisses me off.  Just to be honest.When you guys told me that I had to come alone....something about the way you said it rang so familiar in my head.  It was like having a conversation with my parents.  "Joe, come visit us at home, but make sure you come by yourself."  "Winfield, come visit us at home, but make sure you bring Amy".  It is not fair and I promised myself that I wouldn't put myself into a situation like this anymore.  Paul is more important to me than Amy was or will ever be to Winfield.  And no one takes it seriously.I have spent the last 4 years coming out of the closet with no familial support.  In fact, instead of support, I hear doubts about my promiscuity, my "experimental phase", the fact that "life is so much harder when you are gay".  And to be honest, none of it rings true to me at all.I am sexually responsible in every way, shape, form.  I KNOW this is not a phase.  And I am happy and proud to be a homosexual.  Nothing about the lifestyle scares me or turns me off.  Because I am me and I have a good head on my shoulders.  I know what is best for me.  I have to.  I have been the only one looking out for me in this area. So it hurt.  It hurt to have you two put guidelines on my visit. It hurt to think that you look at me the same way my parents do.  Even though you are gay.I have an amazing time with you during each visit.  But I don't know either of you very well.  And you don't know me.  We have yet to really spend some time together discovering what makes up the real US!  At least, I don't know what makes the real you.I hope that this email wasn't in any way offensive or hurtful to either of you.  I am just at the point where I have to be honest about my feelings regarding this situation.  I am almost 25 and I am finally starting to be happy.  I want to share this happiness with you two (especially) and hopefully one day with my parents as well.Please write me back or call me whenever you get the chance.  Or just let me know when will be a good day/time to call you.I hope we can work this out.  I love you both so much and I am always more than grateful for the money, the thought, and the love that you send my way.Have a wonderful day and I look forward to talking to you soon.   They wrote back this beautiful email:   First of all we think you know that it was not our intention to hurt your feelings.  The last we heard was that you and Paul had broken up.  So we assumed that you might be dating and that was the nature of our "guideline" about bringing people home.  We know you well enough to know that you are not promiscuous.   We also realize that we talked about both you and Paul coming out here together. But after the great time we had with Winfield last year we changed our minds.  We also came to the conclusion that if both of you came we would not get the "two-on-one" time we need to get to know each other.  Please understand this does not mean that we don't like Paul.   We  understand how you feel about flying since neither of us likes to fly either.  But sometimes you have to give a little to get a lot.  Or sometimes you make sacrifices for people you love.   You say that no one in the family knows you or understands your relationship with Paul.  Whose fault is that?  And you should know that it is very offensive to both of us for you to accuse us of homophobia.  If you have issues with your parents' acceptance please deliver them to their doorstep, not ours.   So a visit is not in the cards for this year.  Maybe at some point in the future.  Drop us a line and let us know how things are going with Paul.  That way we won't accidentally say things that hurt your feelings.    I was shocked and really hurt by this.  It will stay with me for awhile.  I just can't believe that my own flesh and blood would go off on me like that.  Especially since they are the only gay role model type people I know.  Ugh.   Way to start a Monday morning.

      25 minutes until PIZZA FRIDAYS!  YAY!  I have been so good this week.  Only eating salads during lunch, when what I really wanted was a huge fucking cheeseburger with an even larger portion of french fries.  So the pizza that I will eat after work today will be gone in 30 seconds and I will sit and play with my gut all afternoon with a huge, fat smile on my face.   I have Craig David stuck in my head today.  He's walking around my brain singing in his british accent.  That boy done got a good voice.  Too bad he is fucking ugly.  I guess you can't have everything.   Unless you are Justin Timberlake.  Then you gots it all.  Or maybe you are Jeff Buckley and you got it all, but you are dead.    HALLELUJAH.  (That joke was a play on words) (Did you figure it out?) Speaking of Jeff Buckley, I gotta introduce someone into this bloggle.  His name is Edward and he is just about one of my favorite people on the planet.  I met Edward during my super senior year at college.  We were in the theater department together and were in most classes and productions together.  He first caught my attention when I heard him sing.  The kid has got a voice that could melt the hearts of women and men across the country.  It's powerful, controlled and so rich in volume and tone.  I just love to hear him sing.  Edward also expresses himself in verse.  He is an exceptional poet and I have about 3 poems he wrote me hanging on my wall.  Every time I read them, I get this overwhelming feeling of inspiration.  He is so in tune with his emotions and it comes across fully in his writing.  Edward and I got real close real fast.  We were really only "friends" for 6 months before I left school.  At the time, we both had this fear that once I graduated, he and I would never really see each other or speak again.  This was totally proven untrue as I talk to him about once a week now over the computer.  We don't use the phone much and I have only seen his face once in the last 2 years.  But he is always on my mind.   I love talking to him and I know he feels the same.  I am almost like a big brother figure to him.  I know he looks up to me in a lot of ways.  In turn, I feel as though he is my concious.  He really wants me to quit smoking and he is always saying the right words of encouragement.   Gosh.  I miss him terribly.  It's weird because there are some days when I miss him much more than I should.  I guess, to be honest, I fell for him pretty hard when I was at school.  In fact, if he wasn't straight, I probably would have fallen completely in love with him.  Or at least in lust.  The kid has a body and a look that just gets under my skin.  He's fucking BIG.  And I don't mean the size of his cock.  That is just too much.  I mean, the size of his body.  I like 'em big and Edward is a fucking big boy.  (Fat ass, actually--------------never!)   On his last day in Oswego (Where I went to college), Edward and I said goodbye in his truck.  He cried, I cried, and then we kissed goodbye.  He toys with the idea of homosexuality, but I don't think he will ever let go into it.  And I don't think he is truly gay.  I think that Edward loves people for people and that is one of the qualities that I admire about him most.  I often wonder if we will ever get the chance to see if it would work for us, but I promised myself a long time ago, that I wouldn't get involved with "straight" or "bi-curious" guys ever again.  It is too hard.  I don't mind fucking around with these type of guys.  But Edward is not the fuck around type.  He is someone that could make me lose myself completely - body and soul. He is planning a visit to the city in May.  I am very excited to see him.  To just sit around and have some beers and talk about the old days.  Laugh a bit, hug a bit, and just know that he still does care about me.  And for me to be able to let him know the same thing.  Also, he will surely be bringing his guitar to play and sing a song for me.  Or maybe 3. I adore him and I am proud to call him my friend.  There are few people in this world that have made such a lasting impression on me, and Edward is definitely one of them.  I look forward to what the future will bring the two of us.  I just hope that we are able to share it with eachother.  :)

      Right now I am talking to Mariah online.  From what she says, her and Paul got into a massive fight last night.  Paul broke a cactus of hers and I guess she flipped.  Not necessarily because of the cactus, but because of all the stress that is being placed on her right now.  She moves to NYC in 2 1/2 months.  She is so scared.  Just to uproot and do it.  But hey, she needs to and she will accomplish it with flying colors.  I believe in her fully.  So Paul said some stupid shit, as Paul tends to do, and Mariah just broke down and cried.  Poor thing.  I know it is tough on Paul.  But honestly, too bad.  Mariah is the one moving.  Paul has neither the courage nor the motivation to change his station in life.  He is stuck and so shall it be.  But as a true friend, he needs to put his feelings aside and get his girl ready to go.  He needs to stop being a control-freak prick is what he needs.   I get so defensive over Mariah.  Even against my own boyfriend.  It's just that I know how Paul can be and sometimes it is too much.  They will work it out and they will cling to eachother and never be able to let go when Mariah's "move date" comes around.  I love them both dearly and I can't even stand the anticipation of Mariah's arrival in NYC.  Can't stand it. As for me...I am plugging away at work today.  My gums were gushing blood about an hour ago.  Not so much gushing as leaking, I guess.  I used floss and it just tore shit up.  It actually doesn't hurt very much.  Just irritating and horribly discusting.  Back to the dentist I go. Tonight is our "White Trash Adventure".  It should be fun.  Tomorrow is my night alone!  Rock.  Most excited about that.  Sunday is St. Paddy's day drinkfest.  LOL I think every day is St. Paddy's day drinkfest. I started another David Sedaris book today.  As I said previously, I recently finished reading "Me Talk Pretty One Day".  It was absolutely fucking fantastic.  The one I started today is called "Naked".  OMIGOD.  I have only read two chapters, but it is so damn funny, I really don't know what to do with myself.  At one point, I found myself clutching my penis and trying to make the laughter stop.  Ok, that never happened, but maybe it did. Last week, I read MUSE by Michael Cecilione.  There were parts of it that were brilliant.  There were also parts of it that were so fucking dumb that I wanted to take an ax and kill my pyschotic boyfriend.  No, not Paul.  I just gave away the ending to the book.  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Oh...and the lead character is fucking crazy with some sort of mental disorder.   That was the other "hidden suprise".  BWA HA HA HA HA HA Book ruined. Penelope comes back to work on Monday.  Finally.  Gosh, it feels like she has been gone for months and months.  Well, kinda she has.  Life has dealt her a pile of shit lately, but she has somehow managed to make brownies out of it.  Meaning, she has taken a half empty glass and poured some milk in it to make it a full glass.  Or that took a stroll around the park and somehow managed to go full circle. Ok, none of this makes sense, but it feels good to just write nonsense once in awhile.  What I am trying to get at is that she is in such good spirits and doing well. Rita and I had a fantastic time with her last night.  Thanks P! Alright friends...have a great weekend. Love you all. but love me more.

      CITY HIGH...shumma shum shum...shumma shuuummmm.  I can't get this fucking song out of my head.  And the worst part about it is that I know only two words.  "City High".   Paul called me at work today.  He was adorable on the phone  We shared a few shits and giggles before we got off.  It was a nice and quick talk.  Made me miss him.  :( I am busting ass to get my shit done before I go.  I also have to figure out how to take the cross-town bus to Penelope's house.  YIKES.  I never take the bus.  So it is Creeps McCreeps that I have to get on one today.  I just think it will go so much faster than taking the subway.   Okay....Cleo just explained to me how to take the bus.  She has been so cool lately.  Close to being one of my favorites at work.  Well, there isn't much competition, but she has been excellent.   Last night, Rita and I did Tarot card readings.  It was fun and TOTALLY insightful.  She has a lesbian deck of Tarot cards.  It's funny.  Even the man characters are these big dykes.  I guess it makes sense.  Every dyke I have ever known has been able to predict the future.  (wink wink) Alright, I gots to go and get ready to leave.   Hope all is well with everyone!  Peace be with you and  oh yeah... fuck off.

      I am currently in the middle of a coughing fit.  One that is racking my face!  I also have the tickle from hell that is making my eyes water.  Not just water, but FLOW.  Ugh.  Cigarettes, the gift that keeps on givin. It is so beautiful outside.  It's funny, well not really funny, but....funny how I think that my moods are soley based on the sun.  If it is rainy and discusting, I am miserable.  Am I bi-polar?  Is that the disease where your moods are governed by the weather?  No.  That disease is called bullshit.  But nonetheless I have a horrible case of the bullshits.   Finally.  Coughing fit over.  Phew - that was a close one.   I feel good today.  Probably cuz the weekend is rearing its' beautiful head.  Come to me weekend.  CUM TO ME.   Tomorrow night, Rita and Kelly and I will be going out for what we are calling: "The White Trash Adventure."  We are going on a budget of $50, not a dollar more.  Cheap dinner, cheap drinks, and cheap attitudes.  Attitudes = me sucking a dick in the bathroom of the restaurant we go to.  Hey!  If the dick fits, suck it.   Saturday night, Rita is going to visit her sister Jeannie.  If you want to know who Jeannie really is, you should go to my links page and check her out.  She is a fantastic girl that is getting married on November 9th.  God.  What am I going to wear?  I have ACTUALLY never been to a wedding for a friend of mine.  I have been to two weddings in my life and both times I barely knew the people.  Kind of excited!!!! I spoke with my dad and mom last night.  It was a great conversation.  I was only dreading calling them because I miss them so much.  They live all the way in Albany and I live all the way in NYC.  Ok...it could be totally worse.  Reets' parents live in Germany.  Damn Germans.  Taking away everyone we love.   Since I was in highschool...I have developed this overwhelming paranoia that my parents are gonig to die suddenly and leave me alone on the cold, hurtful earth.  I picture them being diagnosed with lung cancer and making it 3 months before they are ripped out of my life.  Rita and Kelly tell me over and over that this isn't going to happen and that I really just need to let it go.  "They've got years to live", they say.  I just nod and try to do my best to block it from my mind.  All I can think of is that I had the same massive anxiety about my grandmother dying suddenly and leaving me alone.  Then she did die about 6 months after I developed this fear.  I still haven't found a way to be positive about her death.  So I am just worried.  Do I spend my life with them, making memories?  Or do I move here to NYC and selfishly pursue the movie star dream?  Gosh.  Tough decision.  But I have obvioulsy already made up my mind.  I live in NYC and not Albany.  So sometimes, when I miss them a whole lot, I avoid the phone cuz I know it will bring me down. They are planning a visit next weekend.  They love to come down to my apartment, hang with my friends, drink tons of beer/wine and smoke some bowls.  My mom actually sits in a room with my friends and gets stoned.  She loves it.  And I love her for loving it.  She's adorable.  And I hope she brings pot when she comes, cuz I am out! So, as I was saying, before I was rudely interrupted by my need to explain other things, Rita is going to visit Jeannie this Saturday to look at wedding dresses for the big day.  Kelly has to work Saturday night and I will be home all alone.  I LOVE THAT!  It never happens.  Never.  And I will get to walk around naked, play with myself on the couch, and eat whatever the fuck I want.  Ok...like I couldn't eat what I wanted on days when they are home.  But it will fun to eat naked while playing myself.  And that's the whole point, isn't it? So, tonight, Rita and I go to Penelope's to have a couple drinks with her.  I hope she is holding herself together.  I read her blogger this morning, and my tears flowed directly onto my keyboard.  It was so heartfelt, touching, and awful.  I am sorry Penelope that you have to deal with this shit.  It isn't fair and it isn't cool.  My heart is with you. Kelly wrote a pretty incredible entry in her diary last night.  I told her that she should try writing more about how she feels and less about a recap of her day.  Not that recaps aren't so fun!  Really, it's the only way we (Rita and I) can keep in touch with her.  But I want her to be able to use her diary as a sort of release as well.  She is in this phase (most likely the Robot mode that Rita is always talking about) that causes her to not feel anything at all.  Kelly is someone that is just naturally so sensitive and now, she is like a rock!  She has had to pick up her pieces all by herself lately and she is doing a fine job.  She seems in excellent spirits, and I am proud of her.  It will all balance out for her eventually, but to be honest...I don't think she could get through this semster if it weren't for this robot mode that she is in.  It is keeping her going to work, going to school, and going to class.  And she will collapse on the last day of school, only to realize that she accomplished EVERYTHING and is actually GRADUATING!  What an amazing time that is going to be.  OH! GOSH!  I just can't wait.  I will finally have all of my friends out of college.  I feel like she and I went through this same thing, only four years ago, when she graduated highschool.   Alright, I have been at work for an hour and a half already and I have done NOTHING in the form of work.   Well, not true.  If you count 45 minutes of endless writing in my bloggle work, then I will be promoted by the end of the day.  Hey Edward.  You still there and reading?  I will do a full entry about you soon.  Stay with me bud.  I miss you and love you.

      Damn.  I have taken so many tests today.  I feel like I am back in highschool!  Except a fun highschool where your tests told you what Tarot Card and Daria character you are.   Sorry for those of you that don't like tests.  I have included them all because I feel like everyone will be able to find at least one test that appeals to them.  But even more importantly, they all describe me in some little way.  So fucking deal with it. (Daria shining through here)

      I have to piss so badly right now.  I have been holding it for like 45 minutes.  Have you ever been so not in the mood to piss that you are willing to hold it in until the kidneys just collapse and shrivel?  Well, if not, you don't know what you are missing. I am so hungry today, but I know I must wait until lunch before I eat.  Really trying to cut down on this "Eat all the time" craze I got goin.   Work is so slow today.  Nice and quiet.  But uneventful and boring nonetheless. So last night I am watching the Real World.  Of course.  What else would I be doing on a Tuesday evening at 10pm?  Surely not doing anything but!  Let me just say again how much I love this show.  So damn good.  I sat there thinking how badly I would have wanted to be a part of this cast.  I auditioned (or sent in audition tapes rather) twice to Mary Ellen Bunim and Mr. Jonathan Murray, but they were like: "He is a boring, generic gay man.  We obviously can't cast him."  And I think that it worked out for the best.  I am definitely someone that wanted to be on the Real World because I thought it was such a cool concept.  Not at all because I wanted people to see my habits and weaknesses broadcast over their television.  But the cast that is on now is my favorite.  I would love to chill with them for awhile.  Aneesa especially.  She reminds me a lot of my lesbian friends.  (Which aren't many)  She is not exactly like them persay, as much as she goes through similar things that they go through.  Right Mariah?  And Aneesa talks to her mother on the phone the exact same way that Mariah talks to hers.  It's pretty damn hilarious.  I have to call my dad tonight.  He is all pissed at me because it has been two weeks and I have yet to pick up the phone.  I just don't want to talk!  I love him dearly, it's just that I don't feel like re-hashing some of the things we are going to need to talk about.   Ugh. I am so glad that it is Wednesday.  Two more days to go until the weekend.  So not in the mood to be here right now.

      WELCOME BACK TO ME! Wow.  I feel like I have been gone for years and years.  Or maybe just days and days, but either way...it's been way too long.  My trip to visit Paul and Mariah in Boston was fucking amazing.  Really, I don't think there was one moment that I wished I could be anywhere else.  We ate like fucking hoss's, smoked our brains out, and drank like Prohibition was on its way back in.  I spent most of the weekend fucked up, but it was good and totally needed.  I mean, I did spend a whole 4 and a half hour bus ride to Boston without a drink, so it was much deserved to start boozing the minute I walked in the door. Paul and Mariah paid for everything.  Without question.  They took me out, bought me dinner, and even gave me little suprises the whole time I was there.  Gosh.  I just had the best time.  So good in fact, that when Mariah looked at me with those sad eyes on Sunday afternoon, I just knew that I had to stay for another night.  How could I possibly leave her on her birthday?   It is so weird.  Every time I go to Boston, I immediatly want to shuck it all and move back there.  The place is just damn fun and I know the city well enough to get myself around.  It's like I sort of live there too.  BUT...and this is a big BUT, if I lived there again, I know that I would fall into the abyss of party all the time and never get anything done.  Much like the year that I spent there.  Mariah is readying for her move to NYC.  She is terrified and scared.  And she should be.  It is a huge change.  But it is a much needed change and at some point we all gotta settle down and get started on our careers.  That is what NYC is for.  So I encourage her to move and I eagerly anticipate her arrival.  Just think Mariah...we won't have to say goodbye anymore.  And on top of that...we can visit Boston any time you want.  We will be bus buddies.  But we MUST take busses that show movies.  Otherwise, you would be forced to sing and I would be forced to harmonize for the whole trip. Paul and I got along so well.  He took amazing care of me.  When it finally came time for me to leave, I felt this emptiness that scared me.  I haven't felt that emptiness in so long.  I felt like I couldn't possibly go on without him.  I find myself whining and complaining, laying all over the apartment, just trying to put off the inevitable.  When he and I are together, we are like a force.  Soulmates, Mariah calls us.  When I am with Paul, I am in love.  After 2 years and a couple of months, I am still in love with this boy.  Sex comes forth.  Right after hugs, laughs, and food.  I want to be with him every minute that I am there.  And most of the time, I find myself clinging on to him for dear life.  I sit in his lap, hold him whenever he sits still for 5 minutes, and am constantly telling him that it is time for love.  Love equals kissing me and making me feel special.  And he complies with it, cuz he loves me.   It feels so good to be loved by that.  But this kind of love is dangerous.  It makes you want to chuck it all and just spend every waking moment creating and enjoying each other's company.  I still find myself looking at other guys and wondering what they would be like without their clothes on, but I don't get that compulsive need to meet someone new.  (Like I always do when I am in the city)  UGH.  If we could just live in the same area for once.  Just to see if this shit would really work.   I love you Paul.  So much that I wish I could figure out a way for us to be together and to still accomplish all that we want out of life.  I'm working on it. Besides drinking and smoking non-stop this weekend, we also had a picnic outside, played basketball with the local black kids, and sang and danced like it was our birthday.  OH!  That's right.  It WAS our birthday.  Mariah's 24th!  And I hope she enjoyed every minute of it. On Saturday night, we went to this gay country club.  Gay Country Club.  (Those words should never even be in the same sentence)  It took us about a half hour to get there, and we were lucky enough to have this girl drive us.  However, the minute we stepped out of the car...I proclaimed: "Hey everyone!  I left my wallet all the way back in Boston!"   oops. Paul was fucking incredible and immediately offered to drive me back to get it.  It was so fun to be in the car with him.  We blared music, smoked a joint, and made the best of a shitty situation.  That is why I love Paul.  I can do something totally ridiculous and he just goes with the flow.  He keeps me calm and he just takes care of it.  Man....he was so cool about it.  Especially since I would have been PISSED if he had done the same thing.  Good old Joe.  Always going off the handle at stupid things. So the country club turned out to be a blast.  Unfortunately, the night life shuts down at 2am in Boston....which has proven to be TOO EARLY on every occassion.  But we made the best of it.  We smoked another joint on the way home, made a huge feast at the apartment and had chocolate Martinis to celebrate Mariah's bday!  Such a good time. I think I gained like 12 pounds from the visit.  Paul calls it my Christmas pudge.  (I call it the usual pudge, but whatever) Now I am back in NY and back at work.  Everyone was really cool to me today, which was a relief.  I always get worried that I am going to get in "trouble" or something when I skip out on a day of work.  But instead, I walked in and everyone was like: "Happy 1 Year Anniversary" and blah blah blah.  I totally forgot that it was my work anniversary.  But it is.  So I guess I should be proud.   Okay...moment of pride over.  Time to find a new job. Penelope is having her 30th bday this week.  She is kind of dreading it, but she took the whole week off to soften the blow.  Good for her.  A whole WEEK of doing nothing, but living and being happy.  Unfortunately, her dog, Bailey, had to be put to sleep on Sunday.  My heart snapped in two when I spoke with her on the phone last night.  She doesn't deserve so much heartache all at once.  My heart (what's left of it) and prayers are with her, but I just wish that there was more that I could do.  Losing a pet, especially a BAILEY pet, is so difficult.  It is almost impossible.  She is off to a Knicks game tonight and hopefully seeing some hot, buff, black men will cheer her up.  If not, I plan to get her FUCKED UP on Thursday.  Drinks, pot, and laughs.  Can't wait. I guess that is it for today.  Got a pretty easy week ahead of me.  So long as I don't get thrown any fast balls.  You know how that is....one minute things are boring, monotonous, and annoying....the next minute...I have 8 fingers, a brain tumor, and am struggling to choke down solid food.  I just don't get this thing we call "life".

      Well, I am leaving in exactly 45 minutes to go to Boston to visit Mariah and Paul.  Mariah's birthday is Sunday and we are gonna do it up!  I am so excited.  I feel like it is Christmas or something.  I just hope the visit goes well.  That Paul behaves himself and that I will be on my game. This week has been hellish.  Work has been crazy, personal life has been for shit, and I haven't jerked off in days to get ready for Paul.  :) My bus leaves at 2pm and should get in around 6:30pm.  I plan to get some rest, finish my book, and get myself prepared for what is to be a grand weekend. Everyone have a great weekend and please come back for some more fun and laughs on Monday! Be well!

      Good afternoon Bloggle.   Today has FLOWN by.  I mean, it is now 4:52pm and the last time I saw the clock was at 3:10pm.  TIME TO GO! I got my hair cut today.  I think it looks pretty good.  I went a whole blade down on the clippers.  I am now a 1" boy.  And I look rather studly.  mmmmmmmmmmm.....studly.  Time to go home and masturbate to myself.

      WOW.  I feel great today.  Woke up feeling refreshed and happy.  Very rare that the good mood hits me so early in the morning.  But when it happens, I say: "ROCK!" And I get up and get going.   No.  That is really what happened this morning.  My eyes opened to my alarm.  I screamed out loud: "ROCK!" and then I got my naked ass out of bed.  Weird.  But totally enjoyable. Penelope is out again today.  She is having the WORST time with her teef.  Not her Otis Teef.  Her teef teef.  From what my boss (Speck) says, she is having a wisdom tooth pulled today cuz it is infected.  YIKES!  She must be in so much pain.  It is really not good.  I hope she is holding in there.   So, my little friend Kel-Kel has some anonymous readers.  It feels so good when that happens.  I checked out the sites of her new readers.  They actually are nice looking girls.  Better than my hideous readers.  And I don't mean you Rita or Penelope.  I shall leave the names of my horrifying readers out of this, cuz I want them to come back.  But still...you know who you are. Leaving for Boston in 2 days!  Fucking excited.  I haven't been there in SO long.  I think it has been just about 2 months.  Good for me.   I used to run there every time I had the chance.  But now that I love NYC, it is getting easier to be here every weekend.  In fact, part of me is actually a little depressed to not be going out in the city this weekend.  It is just about my favorite thing to do here.  The gay scene is just BOOMING!  And the guys are not ugly.  Well some are.  But they are my readers. I have to get my haircut today.  Much overdue.  I want to look as good as possible when I go to see Paul.  I want him to ravage me. Just as long as he doesn't stick his fingers in my asshole as hard as last time.  When he gets drunk, he loses all sense of sensuality and becomes this finger sticking maniac.  And then I hurt.   Rita is going to see her boyfriend this weekend too.  I know she is excited.  It will be the first time she has visited Syracuse since she moved.  If I were her, I would be itching to get back to the old stomping grounds for a couple of days.  She will come back to NYC alive and rejuvenated.  She and I both need to get away.  Just so we can take that sigh of relief.  oh and get some dick! I have this account on Yahoo Personals that is sort of like, well...um....a personal.  I have gotten 5 replies so far.  The first one...HOT MOTHA FUCKING HOT.  But I felt like he was lying about his pic.  It was like this really perfect, straight out of   urlLink Musclemag  pic.  Fuck that shit.  The next couple were fucking discusting pictures of these guys with their dicks in their hands.   Then today, I get this email from this guy named Dean.   Dean seemed so cool in his message.  Really sweet.  But "bi-curious".  You know what we gays think about bi-curious... BLECH! But he has this link to his webpage in the email, and I figure, why not just check it out and see if he is my type.   As I sat here and looked at the picture, I thought to myself, well he IS really cute.  A little too thin for me, but great tatoo and nice cuts.  (meaning abs and the such)  (I don't usually go for cuts as much as I go for mass, but he peaked my curiousity) There was a link to more pictures of Dean on his webpage.  I am thinking "Nice...let's see if I really find this kid attractive afterall."  So I click on the link and to my HORROR, he is standing naked in a pool with his dick peeking out of the water.  It was so little and I GASPED!  Next thing I know, my boss comes booming out of his office and I QUICKLY minimize the pic with my heart pounding out of my chest.  OMIGOD!  What is wrong with this Dean kid?  He almost got my ass in trouble.  Or maybe I almost got my ass in trouble.  Or maybe my ass likes being in trouble. And lastly...why would you choose a picture that involves your dick literally peeking out of a pool?   Ok anyway...Dean, Dean, little penis Dean.  GO AWAY! So that was the excitement of my morning.  Now I guess I should go fill the fax machine with paper since it has been beeping incessantly since I started this entry.  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

      QUICK PIECE OF INFORMATION FROM OUR FRIENDS AT BRAVENET: Unfortunately there was some major breach of security over at the headquarters of Bravenet.  They have had to shut down their systems for awhile in order to see what damage has been done.  Unfortunately there will be no guest book or online polls to be viewed until this problem is fixed.   And I was wondering why my page was all fucked up.  Please come back and sign the book soon!

      Welcome to another week.  Shit.  Fucking hate Mondays.  I think I make a comment about that every Monday.  But each Monday the pain is still there and I just don't know how to go on with my daily ramblings until I call it out.   This weekend, Rita's friend Jill came down for a one night visit.  She is an absolute darling and has such an upbeat, crazy sense of humor.  It was nice to spend time with her and to get a glimpse of the kind of people Rita makes friends with.  We sat around and played cards all night with Kelly.  It was a great evening.  Nice and low key.  Somehow I still managed to find a way to get trashed.  Ah.  The joy of living in NYC.  Everything we do involves getting trashed.   This week makes me happy.  I get off at 1pm on Thursday and I took all of Friday off.  I will be going to Boston for Mariah's birthday.  I am so excited to spend some time with her.  She is by far, my favorite friend that doesn't live in NYC.  She is constant jokes and laughter.  We sing together, we cry together, she is my other half.  During my last few visits to Boston, Mariah and I haven't had the luxury of being together just the two of us.  I have spent most of the time with Paul for one reason or another.  This time, however, I am in it to win it.  (okay, that didn't make sense, but I wanted to use that saying so badly) I am sure we will go out each night that I am there.  The afternoons will be filled with pot smoking, food eating, and movie watching.  It's like my own little mini-break and I am damn excited.  I am sure on Friday I will go over to where Mariah is a nanny and play with the baby.  I just love that little bitch.  (Mariah and I used to call her the "bitch of a baby".) And on top of all this, I will be with Paul as well.  He left an absolutely adorable message on my answering machine yesterday.  I couldn't even erase it, cuz it was just so cute.  And he text me today at work.  He is making the effort and I love him for that.  He really is trying.  Oh.  It will feel so good to lay in bed with him this weekend.  To be held.  Kissed.  Sucked.  Ahhhh..... I love him today.

      Fucking great.  My gums are killing me today.  I thought that I might be in the clear with all this bullshit.  Maybe it is bad karma cuz Penelope had a horrible visit to the dentist yesterday.  Ooh.  Poor thing.  Sounds like my biggest nightmare.  In fact, I can't talk about it anymore right now . If you want to know the full gruesome story...go to her blogger.    urlLink Penelope's blogger   What else?  Rita's friend Jill will be here at 7am tomorrow morning.  Damn!  Rita is driving to pick her up.  Brave soul that she is.  I will be fast asleep having dreams of curing my teeth problems.   This will have to be a short entry, since I am in a rush to have some pizza for pizza Friday's!

      One more thing...I believe in full artistic and creative expression.   I have no problem with Marilyn Manson or any of the other blood/death metal groups out there.    I have a problem with little white shit heads who think that by appealing to 13 year old children they are making some sort of a statement.  And what statement is Eminem trying to convey anyway?  Hatred?  Murder?  Rape?  Yeah...those are REAL funny topics and should be conveyed in a glorified manner to the youth of our country.   Please Eminem...continue with your hate music.  I am sure some huge homo will one day find you, beat you and rape you the way you talk about in your songs.   God...why do I hate him so much? I just really do.   He is useless.   No not true.  He is harmful and making money off of hurting others.   That's a great goal for everyone to have!   Live it up psycho shitheads of the world...there is a future for you yet!

      Did you know that Dido's "Thank you" came out in 1999?  Damn...that shit is old!  No wonder it gets on every last nerve I have.  Speaking of Dido...have you heard that Eminem has a new cd out?  And that he is also planning on dressing up as Osama Bin Laden for his next video release?  The new song he has out now talks about how "controversial" his songs always are and how the media just "won't leave him alone".   You know what Eminem?  You are a piece of fucking garbage.  Your lyrics are for shit and you are a fake mother fucker.   It's really too bad.  I think he is so incredibly talented.  But gifted or not, his way of communicating himself just makes him come across like a close minded, homophobic degenerate.   In my most obnoxious and uncaring opinion, I wonder why Lisa Lopes had to die, yet Eminem still plagues the face of this earth?

      In the background, I can hear Doris (Debeast) speaking with my boss Jim.  She is saying something to the effect of creating more work for my friend/co-worker Penelope.  Everything is: "Penelope can do this one first, maybe that can wait...what about at the end of the week?"   I think that Doris is wishing and hoping that Penelope comes back and knocks her ugly face in.

      Counting the damn minutes until I go home! As molasses do,  they tick on my computerized time clock.   Each number traveling slower than the rest. Creating poetry to kill the clock. Realizing that all it does is put my stomach into further knots. Waiting, praying, hoping that Paul is fine.

      So I have taken Rita's advice and have now installed Launch Music Experience on my computer.  And what an experience it is!  I can hear all my favorite songs all day at work.  I have had the system running for almost 5 hours now and I haven't heard any repeats!  Not that I would mind...these are all my favorite songs.  What a great idea Rita.  Thanks! Paul is in surgery right now.  I have been really stressed and upset about it all day.  I really don't like being here while he is there doing this.  I am sure everything will go smoothly.  I have been praying all day.  It's just that I have yet to find the peace in my prayer and I don't know why.  Maybe it's not my peace to have.   Stomach clenched in knots. I will feel better once I get home and make preparations for my visit tomorrow.  I just have to get there and make sure he is ok for myself.  Nightswimming  is playing!   Penelope is out of work today at an interview.  She used the old "My aunt died" lie and got to miss out today, free of charge.  Nice move P!  I have been wondering how it went for her.  Imagine if she quit???  I don't know what I would do.  Would I get a new partner in crime up front?  Do I have a say in who they hire?  I am sure not.  What if they are some old, raging asshole.  I want nothing to do with raging assholes.  Well, actually, if they are...I will make them answer the phones, fix the copier, and do all my other bitch work.  And they will always get the 1pm lunch!    Standing Still  by Jewel is on now.   What else?  What else?   I guess nothing. Work has been crazy for me today.  Real busy.  Trying to get everything done so that I can go to Boston tomorrow night with no worries.  Been busting my ass today.  These announcements are fucking irritating when you can't wait until the day before to do them.  And I am sure that my boss will change it all.   Very excited about that. Alright...it is starting to rain and I am really hoping that it turns into a full fledge storm by the time I go home.  I have no umbrella and I am not wearing a heavy jacket, so I hope to go home freezing cold and wet.  One can only hope!!!

      So the coolest thing happened at lunch today.  I was sitting at the West End   (The West End, 2911 Broadway (@ 113th St.), 662-8830  M-Su 11:30am-2am  Columbia University hangout (it's 1 block southwest of campus) once frequented by Kerouac. Huge sitting areas inside, with o.k. food served till 10pm. Back room hosts bands every Friday and Saturday for $0-10. Cheap pitchers.)  .   I ordered cheese fries and a diet coke.  The cheese fries came and I ate them, but no diet coke.  The waitress comes back to the table and asks how things are...by now I am 30 minutes into my lunch break...I say "good, but I am really thirsty".  She looks at the table and sees that not even a water has graced my path since I have sat down.  She says: "Chardonnay?"  I say: "No, not today.  I will just have a diet coke".  She's like: "Have a Chardonnay, it's on me."  I say: "Well, ok!" She brings me my Chardonnay and I drink it in two seconds.  She comes back about 10 minutes later and says: "Another one?"  I say: "No, just the bill please."  She is like: "Have another one.  It's on me".   DOH?!?!?! "Well, alright", I say.  I then drink the next glass of wine and she brings me the bill.  $4 and change for cheese fries and two glasses of wine.  YAYAYAY!  What a nice suprise.  She is the cutest little blonde girl and she treated me so well.  What a suprisingly good lunch. And cheap!  Almost cheaper than Burger King.   Almost.

      So there is news about our favorite show  urlLink Sex and the City . Supposedly, Kim Cattrall is leaving this season.  She wants to pursue movies now.  Do they get a new girl?  I don't know if that would work.  I could play her part.  Maybe they will give me a shot. Also, one other bit of bad news.  Instead of the usual 13 episodes this season, there will be 8.  Cuz Sarah the slut had to go and get pregnant.

       Lisa Lopes (1971-2002)  I was shocked and really upset to find out that Lisa Lopes, of TLC fame, was killed last Thursday night.  It seems to me that there have been quite a few shocking deaths in the celebrity world these days.  Of all of the celebrity deaths that I have experienced in my life, this one has hit me the hardest.  Aaliyah's death was quite shocking as well, but I didn't listen to her music that much so I wasn't as personally affected.  urlLink Lisa Lopes  and I go back for years.  I was a HUGE fan of  CrazySexyCool   and an even bigger fan of  FanMail  .  Both CD's were in massive rotation in my stereo for quite some time.  Their beats, their voices, and their overall package was something that I not only appreciated, but admired as well.  TLC is a group that was fun, cutting edge, and strong as fuck.  They went through bankruptcy, media chaos, and personal tragedy and somehow STILL managed to remain as a group.  My personal favorite member is T-Boz.  AKA Tionne Watkins.  But without Lisa's rap portion of their songs, the group loses that overall package that took years to fine tune.   I am sad.  I don't know why I care so much.  But I definitely do.  I was eagerly awaiting their next album and was also upset to find out that they were in the middle of recording it, to be released at the end of the year.  Hopefully they will still finish it up.  I will be one of the first to own it. Life is so unpredictable.  Why did Lisa die?  Yes, she was a very reckless, crazy individual.  But so is half of the industry.  TLC debuted in 1992 with their first album.  You remember the songs: "What about our friends" and "Baby baby baby".  It has only been a decade since they have been around.  A decade?  I was sure they were around for much longer than that.   Last night I watched a memoriam special on TLC.  I saw some old videos, old interviews.  TLC has won 4 Grammy's.  Including Best R & B Album for both CrazySexy and Fanmail.  Good for them, right? I am still just so confused by this whole thing.  I am disappointed because I was still looking forward to seeing them in concert at some point.  This will never happen now.  And what if Tionne and Chilly try to replace Left Eye?  It couldn't happen.  It shouldn't happen.  And I don't think it will happen. TLC is done now.  Another representation as to how unfortunate and scary life is.  And just another milestone as to how much older I am getting.   I hope no one ever dies again.

      Well, I have arrived.  The weekend was officially over as of 6am this morning.  Mariah and her friend Anne came into town last night for an audition in the city.  They crashed at our place last night.  It was, as always, great to see Mariah.  She was so cute.  The one ridiculous part is that Anne had to put her cat to sleep yesterday morning, cuz it was all crazy and tempermental.  Then she got to our house and saw Kelly's cat Trey and nearly burst into hysterical tears.  She was like: "Oh...he looks just like ______" (insert random dead cat's name here).  It was sad, but she talked about it incessantly and it left me wondering...if you put your cat to sleep this morning, why are you in NYC auditioning to be the next  urlLink American Pop Idol  when you seem like all you want to do is be at home crying?  Guess you gotta do whatever it takes to be a star. So, I hung out with them for a bit and then tried to get some sleep. Not nearly enough.  I am beat.  So tired that my body hurts and my head feels fuzzy.  I don't think that I have had a moments silence since last Tuesday when Paul came in to the city.   Must sleep.    On Wednesday night, I am heading to Boston to take care of Paul.  He is having major surgery tomorrow night and he is going to be lying on his back for about a week.  I am going so that I can cook him meals, watch movies with him, and change the dressing on his wound.  Nast.  But someone's got to do it.   Barf-a-ria. Time to go stare blankly at my computer screen for an hour.

      Thank God it is Friday.  I just wish that I had a moment to breathe this weekend, but that ain't gonna happen.  I think that when Monday night comes, I will collapse and die for a day or two.  It has been a fucking mad house lately.  I don't remember the last time I had a clear head or a full night's rest.  Seems like days ago. Paul being here is a wonderful thing, but for some reason I am having a bit of a hard time relaxing around him.  I have clenched stomach and anxiety like you wouldn't believe.  It will come and go, but it isn't relaxing whatsoever.  I don't want him to leave, but I want to just find a way to calm down.  I don't know.  It's weird. Yesterday after work, Paul met me and we went down to Chelsea to go to Happy Hour at the  XL Lounge .  It was one of the most beautiful bars I have ever been in.  It was amazing.  From the architecture and video screens to the gigantic aquarium by the most private and comfortable bathrooms, I felt like I was in gay heaven.  It was wonderful and I definitley can't wait to go back.  Plus...during happy hour, it was two for one drinks. On everything!  Andrew drank dirty martinis and I drank stoli vanilla.  And each round was 7 bucks.  Great times.  Great times. After that, we took a walk to Chelsea piers and looked at the boats, the Jersey skyline, and smoked a quick J.  We were laughing our fucking asses off.  It was great.  After this adventure, we ended up at this bar/lounge called  Open .  It was this really cute little bar on 16th street and 12th, or something very close to that.  I think the place was new because the empolyees didn't seem to know the business very well.  But they were sweethearts and ended up giving us half our drinks for free.  What a night!   Paul got a salmon plate and I almost puked.  It was raw salmon, served like pate'.  It came with little pieces of toast and a rammy-kin of sour cream.  He loved it.  I couldn't even watch him put it in his mouth.  Good times.  Good times. By the time he finished his Sangria and Toasted Almond, we got in a cab and headed home.  I didn't have much to drink at all last night.  That's strange.  I just wasn't in the mood.   When Paul and I got home, we had hot sex again!  We were going to just try to go to sleep, but I couldn't keep my hands off of him.  So...I got my way and he loved it.  I suck a mean dick.  We talked and laughed all night.  Because of this, I really don't understand why I would feel so anxious around him these days.  We are having a blast!  I am sure it has something to do with us not talking at all for the month before the visit...but hmph.  Optimistically, I am looking at this strange turn of events as no big deal.  I will be with him from Wednesday night to Sunday night.  I am sure we will settle in again by then.  We better...cuz I will be taking care of him as though he were my little baby. Tonight Jessica rolls into town.  Gonna be some fun and exhaustion headed our way.  Mariah will be here on Sunday.   Just got to get to Monday.   Just gotta. Just.... {{ack}}

      Alright Joe.  Quit playing with it now.  You are going to fuck it up again! I CANT BELIEVE SHE FIXED IT.  You would have died laughing if you saw what had happened.  Then you would have seen my tears strolling down my face and the laughter would have stopped. Now if I can just figure out a way to make my body of text stop eating my guestbook, I should be all set.

      You have no idea the chaos that just ensued. I figured out how to make things scroll.  But...as I did it, I published and found that my  ENTIRE  webpage started to scroll.  THE ENTIRE THING!  I tried everything that I could think of to fix it.  Once I realized that the page was fucked up forever...Penelope notices an extra "a" in the html code.  She removes it and the whole page went back to normal.  WHAT IS SHE?  A GENIUS??? I can't believe it.  I should never be allowed to play around with code.  But Penelope, now that girl...she's a prodigy! Thank you P!  Thank you from the bottom of my incompetent soul!

I try to add one cool thing and end up fucking up the entire page.  Of course! Please stay tuned.

      Well, hello!   Paul came in a day early yesterday.  He calls me on the phone at like 4:30pm and says: "I don't think that I will be coming to visit anymore.  My manager got fired and I need to stay to help make the transition go more smoothly."  Feeling my life crumble before me, I packed up and got ready to leave work.  I was pretty disappointed.  When I walked out the front door, there was my studly liar of a boyfriend waiting for me.  Man!  He is just so adorable.  I mean, does he always have to upset me just to make me happy again?  This pattern of him calling and saying that he isn't coming, but then coming has to stop at some point.  But if it means that I will get him for an extra day each time, then please Paul...hurt my feelings everyday! We went grocery shopping when I got home.  Then we made a GIGANTOR taco salad.  We ate, laughed, watched  Single White Female  and went to bed at a decent hour for once.  Well, 1am is not a decent hour for someone who was hungover all day yesterday.  But I do feel much better today. He is meeting me after work today to go to a nice dinner and then on to some drinks.  I have already given him the warning that we will need to be home at a NORMAL time tonight.  No 2-3am evening.  I think he understood, but we will see... He looks good, by the way.  He is getting some nice pecs on him.  I was very turned on by him yesterday.  So turned on in fact, that I started to get the butterflies pretty intensely and couldn't even lay next to him at first.  But then we had some amazing hook-up sex.  No penetration still folks.  But it was great.  It was hot. Some bad news...Paul informed me that, next Tuesday, he will be going to the hospital for emergency spine surgery.  He has a polynoital cyst at the base of his spine, tailbone region.  About 6 years ago, he had the first cyst removed, but since then, the hole at his lower back has opened up drastically and the new abcess that has formed is about double the size.  It bleeds, it is very painful, and it needs to be taken care of right away.  There are a few complications with the surgery and I am pretty nervous about the whole thing.  He tries to be tough about it, but we spoke last night pretty in-depthly about it and I can tell how scared he really is.  Unfortunately, once the surgery is over, it will be about a week before he can do the simple things again.  Simple things means refraining from standing, walking, sitting on the toilet, taking a shower, any sort of physical exercise.  I am leaving work next Wednesday at 5pm to go to Boston.  He needs me there to take care of him and I wouldn't have it any other way.  He is mine and he deserves my love and attention.  Poor kid.   It couldn't have happened at a better time though.  I have already cleared the time off with my boss.  He has been so incredible lately.  He agreed to take the time I use from my "sick" days and not from my vacation time.  That's pretty great.  I have about 15 days of sick time built up and only about a week and a half of vacation time left.  Not only has he cleared the time for me, but he has done it in the way that benefits me most.  Phew. I guess that's the biggest shit I got going right now.  It is already 10:35am.  The day is flying so far.  Please let that keep up!

      So...what is my problem?  I spend the entire day hung over and then I go to lunch with my boss and end up having 3 glasses of wine.  Am I serious?  Now I am drunk again!  How does this happen?  Ironically, having some of "the hair of the dog that bit me" has turned out to make me feel 100 times better.  I guess the old adage is true.  From now on folks...if you are really hung over and can find some way to down a couple more glasses of booze...you will feel worlds better!   It was a great lunch.  We just talked about some work shit, waxed philosophic, and ate and drank.  I love my boss.  He is really great.  He is easy to talk to and I just feel comfortable opening up to him.  It is weird...I dread these lunches so much and then once I am there...it always turns out so great!  I just don't know.  Am I a pessimistic bitch deep down?  I try to act as though I am a full optimist, but I guess not. Today has turned out to be pretty cool. Almost time to go home and go to bed.

      OMIGOD.  I am dying.  After a night of craziness and booze, I sit here barely able to keep my eyes open.  What happened? I meant to go out and have a simple, inexpensive dinner.  Next thing I know, and $120 later, I am home in bed at 1am.  Or something like that.  I don't even fully remember.  I was very drunk.  Usually I don't get hungover.  And actually I don't have your typical hangover symptoms.  No headache, just a little nausea at this point.  But the "over" part of the word hangover is definitely how I feel.  I am just done.  I am not pulling out of the fog any time soon.  Most times, I am usually fine by like 11am or 12pm.  But today...oh man...I just can't wait to get home and go to bed.  And I mean real bed.  No staying up to watch movies or to putt around.  Just time to get naked and get in bed.  And the best part about going to bed early is that when I wake up...PAUL WILL BE COMING!  I feel like I have waited for this moment for a lifetime.  And it is almost here!  I just had a moment of complete and utter love for him.   Udder. That shit is sick. Last night at the bar, I was chilling with Angie, Kelly, Rita, and Angie's roommate fuck face.  Remember how I was dreading seeing fuck face?  Well, because he was so cool and relaxed last night, he will now be given a real name.  His name from this point on will be Jennifer.  Hey.  It's a step.  If I hang with him again and it is just as cool, he will be given a more respectable name.  But for now, Jennifer seems like the appropriate way to go.  He was great last night.  He was cool, comfortable, and he even looked good for once.  I enjoyed being in his presence and that was kind of a shock. Angie was adorable last night.  I think she had a really nice time.  It felt so good to be her friend and to be there supporting her.  She loved the present that Paul and I got her.  Her smile glowed last night and it warmed my heart.  I just love her. Kelly was in a great mood last night too.  It is so rare that she gets to let go and not be in rehearsal or memorizing lines or going to class or going to work or etc etc etc.  I can't remember the last time that the 5 of us all hang out.  I don't think it has happened since like January.  Gosh.  I really enjoyed myself. BUT...at the end of the night...Rita and I had a major argument explosion.  I sit here and literally LOL right now thinking back on it.  We were like screaming at eachother with no regard to anyone else in the bar.  It's funny how anger can totally eliminate any sort of self-conciousness.  At the peak of our screaming match, Rita gets up, grabs her shit, and bolts from the bar.  I immediately grab my shit, say goodbye, and then run out of the bar after her.  There was no way I was going to let her go home alone, in the state of mind that she was in.  So picture this...Rita doing her DAMNDEST to run away from me....me changing directions every time she did and trying MY damndest to catch up with her.  Then the funniest part is that she is yelling at me, I am calling her names like: "Stupid fucking bitch", "dumb idiot", we are screaming at eachother so loud that the people on the street think that I am kicking the shit out of her.  Rita told me that at one point some guy gave her a sly look that said: "should I help you in this situation?"   OH MAN!  Were we really those people last night??? When we finally got in the cab, we had some time to cool down.  I held onto her like she was my little baby.  A cry baby! SIKE!   After we got home, we immediately went into my room to discuss what happened.  Of course I am not going to get into the details of the argument, that is unimportant.  What I will say is that all of this drama was based on a simple comment that was misinterpreted on Sunday.  For two days, we stewed over a low flame.  I think we both thought that it was squashed.  Then the next thing we realize, shit just came POURING out!  How random.  I felt like she and I were in a relationship.  What with me running down the street after her and all of the extreme emotions that came out.  It was all very romantic.   I just hope Angie didn't feel put out at all.  I don't see why she would, but I just hope she didn't. So now...here I sit, quietly suffering. Thanks to Kelly for remembering the name "Selma Blair".  She is so good! I think I may be starting to feel better now.  For real??? I just love my immune system.  Saves my alcoholic ass every time.

      So...random disgusting moment of the day... I typed in www.blogger.com in the address box of Internet Explorer.  Unfortunately for me, I forgot the period and typed wwwblogger.com instead.  What popped up was the most horrifying thing I have ever seen.  It was an abortion site.  I couldn't believe the main page and quickly tried to cancel out of it.  When I typed in www.blogger.com in the address box of the abortion webpage, another abortion page popped up and there was a picture of a black baby that was aborted and tossed in the dumpster.  It's arms, legs, and body were chopped off and the top of the skull was fully disconnected and smashed.  I about threw up and burst into tears.  OMIGOD.   I suggest you do NOT forget the period in your web addresses folks.  What may pop up will scare you for the rest of your life.   SO! In other news...well, i guess there isn't any real other news.  I was going to just wax-philosophic in here, but instead, i sit here trying desperately to get the image of little black babies murdered out of my head.  DAMN that shit was sick. I got a couple slices of pizza for dinner.  Imagining tonight to be a very low key, lay in bed kind of evening.  I got some shit to do and luckily feel so much better.  Otherwise, no shit would get done.  Honestly, I can't guarantee that shit will get done anyway.   Rita was just washing her face and accidently sucked a drop of soap into her nose.  Then she went to blow out the soap drop and a huge bubble emerged from her nose.  HAHAHAHAHA.  I just wish I was in the bathroom to see it.  Alright dawgs....that is going to be it for today.  HOW EXCITING was my blogger today?  On a scale of 1-10, I would probably give it a 2.5 and  the only reason it gets that good of a rating, is cuz of aborted black babies and random soap bubbles. The end.

      Shit day.  The weather is not fun.  Everyone I know is either stuffed up or walking around with an excruciating sinus headache.  I woke up today and felt like my head was in a vice.  I came in about 2 hours late.  I just needed that extra sleep.  And it truly helped.  The idea of staying home all day was blasting in my head, but since I will probably take off Friday, I had to try to drag my ass into the building today.  I am glad I came.  Makes it easier to bail later in the week. What else what else?  I had such an incredible weekend.  My parents came in to town on Saturday.  My granny came with them to see my apartment and to catch a mid-afternoon viewing of  The Producers  on Broadway.  I was dreading seeing the show and then was unexpectedly suprised to find out that the show is just about the best.  There actually IS a reason why this show won almost all the Tony's this year.  It is done in traditional musical style, but the humor is never ending, cutting edge, and totally hysterical.  The play focuses on gay/Jewish themes.  Not Gay-Jewish.  But Gay and Jewish.  Man.  It was just so impressive.  It is so hard to explain.  But if you miss this show...you are missing a great one! Saturday night I hung out with Penelope until like 1am.  Then I went home and hung out with Kelly until about 3am.  Then Angie came over and I hung out with her until about 6am.  It was a great night, but damn...who was I kidding?  I was up for almost 24 hours on Saturday.  It's great to have those nights once in awhile. There is a really hot student in the office today.  He isn't really my type, but I can't stop sweating him. Tomorrow is Angie's birthday.  We will be taking her out to dinner and unfortunately, her roommate fuck face will have to be present.  I just have to suck it up and be as nice as I can.  I just hope he acts normal and not like a little prissy bitch.  Eh.  He will be a bitch.  But it will be tolerable.   Paul will be coming into town on Thursday and staying until Saturday morning.  FINALLY!  It seems like it has been such a long stretch since the last visit.  Just about 4 weeks.  We have gone longer, but this time...we have barely talked.  I hate when that happens.  Whenever we go through these stints, seeing eachther again, after such a long time, is fucking weird.  It's like we don't even know eachother anymore.  So, I am excited, but also anxious as well. My mom was amazing this weekend.  Just want to say again how much she and my dad mean to me.  I couldn't ask for a better family.  I really wished they lived just a bit closer so that I could see them more.  :( Penelope is home with a horrible neck ache.  She came in this morning, but she pulled something.  Poor thing.  I don't think there is much worse than having a neck problem.  One time, when I was in 7th grade, I got a stiff neck from sleeping wrong.  The entire left side of my neck was rock solid and crooked for about 2 weeks.  It was the worst pain.  And I looked like I needed a V-8!  Remember those commercials?  Well, it was exactly what I looked like.  So poor P.  She is home and in pain.  :( Fucking can't wait to leave work today.  Every time the phone rings, I consider answering it fuck off.  That prolly wouldn't go over too well.   I saw the movie K-PAX last night.  If you are looking for a shit movie, with a shit concept, and shit shock value...go rent this right away.  Kevin Spacey was fine in it.  Nothing special.  But even he couldn't have pulled off such a weak film.  Why did he do it anyway? Alright...Talk soon folks!

      So I just took the test.  (insert humiliated face here) I am losing my skills.  I thought the test was pretty easy...HOWEVER...it had the exact words on it that I have the hardest time spelling.  I am good with most words.  Even if I have never heard it...but you give me some of the age old common words and I will fuck it up consistently.  The other day Rita says to me: "Joe, spell the word discusting".  I immediately burst out laughing, cuz discusting is one of those words that I believe I know how to spell, but also believe that I get it wrong every time.  I have been spelling it wrong for years.  Discusting is actually spelled DisGusting.  Hmmm. I am not good with the "definitely's", the "absolutely's", the "ly's" that may or may not have that "e" before it.   But either way...I won my 5th grade spelling bee.  And I moved to the next round.  It is one of my best personal stories.  Remind me to tell you sometime.  One funny part of the story is...when I won the 5th grade bee...my parents got me a present.  Anything that I wanted.  Of course I got the dinner of my life and a movie or something.  But the one thing I WANTED was "The Babysitter's Club issue 9, I think.  It was called  Dawn and the Haunted House .   And my parents didn't know that I was from homo-city.   So imagine my suprise when I took the spelling test and this is what I saw:  Not bad. But you probably won't win the big spelling bee.You got 10/15 correct.  I got some brushing up to do before our big home spelling bee!

      As you may know...or some of you may not know...I am obsessed with grammar.  But I get a boner over spelling and learning the meaning of new words.  So to my delight...on MSN today there was this link: http://encarta.msn.com/quiz/quiz.asp?quizid=36 If you don't feel like copy/pasting, go to my links section and click it there.  I am about to go test myself, but I wanted to come here first to share it with my little spelling students.  Let's have a spelling bee one day!  That would be just about the most fun!

      So here I sit.  I am blaring Vanessa Carlton and Stevie Wonder at the highest level of volume and screaming along with the lyrics.   Rita and Kelly are having drinks at Jake's Dilemma.  What an interesting name for a bar.  Cuz what IS Jake's Dilemma?  I suppose alcoholism.   At this moment Mary J. is singing about that drama in her life.  But she says "No more!"  Hope she was able to really leave it behind. like I give a fuck. Mary J. seems like a really troubled person.  Like she has had her fill of garbage.  I have this respect for her and I don't even know that much about her.  She seems tough, but she seems scarred to me.  Maybe she carries her hurt with her as a reminder.  She does say "another lesson learned".  What a classy lady. I was so exhausted today at work.  I went into some weird blur at one point...I wasn't tired necessarily (even though I only got about 4 hours of sleep), my body was just done.  I have been exercising (am I serious about that spelling)(wait...is it right?)(I am going fucking crazy) heavily lately and my legs are so sore.  Each step is excruciating.  But I know it is worth it and I have to keep it up.   So Jessica will NOT be visiting this weekend.  What a trial this was!  It is such a long story and I really don't have the energy in me to get into it.  She will most likely be coming next weekend.  Much better idea.  MUCH. What this means though is definitely no trip to Boston next weekend.  I guess that is for the best.  Makes my stomach hurt when I even think about Paul at this point.   Alright...must sign off.  Too mellow for this bloggle  tonight.

      WHAT UP???   Ironically, it is 10:50pm and I just walked in the door from Penelope's house.  Um? I used to go over there and spend like 2 hours and bolt and now I just can't leave.  We had an awesome time.  We played the ever so popular "question game" and we laughed, smoked, drank, whatever.  It is very rare that I think I overstay my welcome.  If I run into a situation where I want to stay, but feel I should leave, I will ask over and over "I should go.  Right?".  But Penelope seemed to enjoy me staying so I did.  In fact, when her brother Ethan started dying of hunger, I felt like she still wanted me to stay.  We just had so much fun.  It was chill.  It was cool.  It was exactly what I needed today.  I had a good time.  Scratch that.  I had a wonderful time.  Bitch need to get an air conditioner though.  SO KIDDING!  Kelly and I lived in a no air conditioner house during the worst weeks of the summer and we felt awful when visitors came.  But to be honest...fuck the visitors...who cares what they think!  You got to LIVE in that sauna.  Who gives a shit what visitors feel when they come down...they get to go home later!   So yeah... I had such an amazing time.  We talked about movies, actors/actresses, Dawson's Creek, V, damn...I went over there feeling like shit.  Cuz I HADN'T shit all day...and then I dumped the minute I got there and life just got better.   Did I really just say that? Did I really just say "And then I dumped the minute I got there"?  Someone remind me that I am gay and that I have more class than that. I thought that I might run into Kelly tonight.  She was supposed to be home around 11pm and it is about that time now.  I figured she would shit herself if she saw me up and milling about at the wee hours of the morning.  (10:30pm) So...big weekend coming up.  Jessica will be here on Friday.  I am excited and curious at the same time.  We have never had Ryan AND Jessica for a visit since we moved to NYC.  Never has happened.  It is going to be interesting.  Kelly doesn't know Ryan very well...and Penelope don't know either of them at all...but they will both see how Creepsville this whole situation is.  Ryan is hard to explain.  He gives you the creeps, but you can't EXACTLY pin point why.  He will hit on you, cuz that is just his way.  Don't matter if you are gay or straight, black or blue, Jewish or Hindu, the kid will make you feel as though when he says: "How are you?", you hear: "May I eat your cunt?".  It's all very bizarre, but it will ring true if you meet him. Side note... The cab I took home smelled like curry diarehea.  I don't remember how to spell diarehhea.  It really smelled like that.  BADLY.  Then at some points, I smelled an exceptional amount of fart mixed in with the curry. My Deduction----- This cab driver ate a curry dinner at the beginning of his shift.  When I jumped in, he was at the brink of bursting into horrible bouts of cramps and intestinal chaos.  I smelled his dinner and his aftermath in the air...and I was horrified. The worst part about it.... I sit here typing and smell it on my clothes. DO I HAVE TO TAKE A FUCKING SHOWER NOW?  Bullshit! man i stink. So, Jessica coming is a big event.  She is a great visitor.  We will laugh, we will talk, and it will remind Rita and I of the old days.  And I think we are due.  The exceptionally strange part of it is that Jessica never mentioned calling Stacey while she was here.  I guess that friendship is done. I just heard  the door slam.  Is Kelly home???? I think so... I wait in anticipation to shock the shit out of her that I am awake still..... Waiting..... waiting.................. still think I might hear her........ Nope, I don't think it is her. Anyhoodle...I wonder if anyone will go this far down in today's entry and read all this.  Once you get past the first scrolldown, I find that people give up on you.  That's ok.  Cuz deepdown, writing in this journal gives me this crazy sense of purpose.  It's like a project and even when I don't want to do it, I do.  I feel like I should commit to it or nothing.  I am sure, someday soon, I will lose it.  And once I lose it, it's done.  Somewhat like what Rita did.  Except that I will leave my page up to represent the legacy that was Joe CuttheShit.  HAHAHAHAHAHAHA yeah. So Edward is coming to visit in May.  UM?!?!?!?  Motha fuckers....please sit me down before his visit and ask me how important it is that his and my time go well. Edward is my unrequited love.  I loved.  He was straight.  But we made out.  We slept in the same bed together, me holding him in my arms.  He  is first and foremost a friend.  But...he is the only guy that I have ever  questioned Paul for.  There was Ian...but that was flingish.  Stupid sex.  And not worth it by any means.  Edward...he is someone I fell for.  Someone, that in SOME ways, I obsessed over.  Why?  He is not my type.  He is straight and he is exactly what I am NOT looking for in a future "husband".   There are two people in my life that I will always wonder about....or at least at this point in my life always wonder about... Edward is one...and there is another.  The other is even more dangerous.  It is somebody that, if it worked, would change the entire person I call Joe CuttheShit.   But Edward is someone that I always wonder about a lot more frequently.  One time, Rita and I went to this psychic.  It could have been better, but we all found ourselves finding out something that has stuck with us forever.  Or at least I did.  The psychic said that, since I was a Cancer and I love hard, I will have three major loves in my life.  Oh...and that I will be successful in my chosen career.  But don't those bitches always say that?   So three loves.... The first love,  I question,....in my mind, it was always BJ.  I thought he was the guy that I would spend the rest of my life with.  There was nothing that could ever change the bond that he and I had.  It was the first all consuming love experience that  I have ever had.  And now...we don't speak at all. And it wasn't a relationship by any justifiable terms.  So was he my first?  I think probably.  I fell for him hard.  So it counts, right? Paul is the second.  Paul, like  BJ, is NOTHING that I EVER thought I would fall for.  But I did.  And once again, hard.  But different hard.  So different.  I remember Kelly and I sitting in the parking lot of the Guilderland Library and me sobbing to her that I needed him.  That something inside of me needed to be with HIM.  Kelly, having experienced me not like any guy I dated, and always breaking up with EVERYONE, was the person who gave me my geared me towards a relationship with Paul.  We changed our weekend plans of going to NYC that weekend and ended up going back to Boston so that I could figure things out with Paul.  Man.  She has done some incredible things for me.  Things that no one has ever done.  She has EARNED a place in my heart that could never and WILL never be forgotten or filled.  Kelly believes in me and always has.  She brought me to Paul, thus bringing in my second love.   SO!  LONG TANGENT short....or still kind of long...do I have a third left?  Is Paul my life partner?  Is he my final man?  I feel like it could work itself out so that the answer is yes, but....I still feel something missing.   Will my third combine body AND soul?  Not so much body, but a physical something that I would die for?  I feel like that is one of the biggest things holding Paul and I back.  I just don't get as excited over him as I want to be.  SUPRISE FOLKS!  I am not a virgin just because I am trying to make it special....he won't let go completely with me.  THAT holds up back from crossing over into the anal.   WOW. So...there is all this shit.  I find myself dwelling and dwelling unecessarily about it 300 times a day.  I try not to overdue it with my close peeps, cuz who wants to hear that shit all the time?  But some days are definitely harder than others.  Last week, life was fucking grand and all things seemed hunky dory.  (I fucking hate hunky dory as a saying)  But this week...all REALLY GREAT...but the Paul problems are becoming increasingly harder to bear.  I said last week that he and I haved moved to another level.  We have.  But now there are different problems to face.  And above it all...I just keep loving him more.  It is so scary not to be able to just stop it.  I am so used to playing the game and getting what I want.  I always get what I want.  :( But when it counts, when it is Paul and my whole relationship, I don't get anything that I want.  It is a lesson I have to learn and live with every day.  I HATE LONG DISTANCE to begin with.  I always told myself  "NO!.  That could never work."  And her I am.  Having it work, but having it be the hardest thing that I have ever done in my entire life.  Paul and I spent 6 months living in the same area.  6 FUCKING MONTHS!  That's it!  We have been together 2 years and 3 months.  And we are still kicking.  I try to be proud.  But I have never known a whole week, a full 7 days, of the feeling "I have a boyfriend that I love."  I have had long weekends.  I have had 6 days in a row.  Once or twice before.  But I don't know what it is like to get sick of my boyfriend.  I don't know what it is like to want him "to go out with his friends and me go out with my friends".   It chokes me  up.  I had much higher expectations for this.  And after 2 years, the arguement is still:"When are you going to move near me?"   Deep down I truly want him to do what he wants.  I respect every decision he makes because I truly respect him.  Paul is someone that I look up to and want to be.  He is my perfect balance.  He is good at things that I am bad at and vice versa.  We fit like a puzzle.   Because I believe this so truly that I have stayed with him this long, I really wonder what it would be like for us to be together full time.  Would it  work?  Could it work?  Are we a REAL couple?  Or are we just a fantasy that we have been trying so desparately to live?  If he actually moved here, would I still love him just the same?  Gosh.  The question that breaks my head open.  I just don't know.  I don't push him into moving.  I whine, like a bitch sometimes, but I don't put any pressure on him.  Maybe I have a couple times...but it hasn't been an issue anyway.  But deep down...I am dying.  If Mariah moves and he has a bad roommate, I can't go visit.  Especially if he has to work one of the nights.  And if he visits me and Mariah in NYC at the same time...I can't handle that.  It will really hurt.  I will never make it a problem, but it will crush me.   So all of this...and you know what??? fucking enough. This has been a wonderfully introspective evening.  The weather makes me so happy I want to cry.  Thank G-d for Penelope.  (Look...I left out the "O" for you so that you wouldn't have to bury this entry.) I hope everyone feels good. Peayce.

      Hello folks!  Today is so warm and beautiful!  I LVOE it so much!  Unfortunately, the sun has gone behind the clouds and now I don't think I am going to get much color today.  Fuck!  I was really looking forward to baking my skin to death.   I spoke with Mariah today.  YAY!  It was a great talk.  She is hastily making preparations to move here June 1!  Oh man...I can't WAIT to see her on a regular basis.  She said some interesting things, but the most important thing she said was: "Paul is looking for a new roommate".  He has posted his ad on the internet and has really only heard back from these two scary Asian boys.  And as we all know...Asians eat their own puke.  He doesn't want to live with either of these guys, so he is still on the hunt.  Also, Mariah told me that if Paul doesn't find a roommate in time, he is going to have to move.  Maybe even to Alston, Massachussettes.  Now, for those of you who don't know Boston very well, Alston is about 20 minutes from the HEART of the city.  It is where Kelly and I lived when we first moved there.  It's a fine area, but right now he lives in one of the best and most expensive parts of the whole city.  Moving to Alston from Downtown Boston is like living in Manhattan and then moving to Queens.  It sucks!   I said to her: "If Paul is going to move to Alston, why wouldn't he just move to NYC?"  I know he loves Boston, but the thing he loves the most is his apartment.  I can't make an arguement good enough for him to move out of his current apartment, but I could DEFINITELY make quite an arguement for him to move out of Alston.   I hate this shit.  Why won't the kid just fucking move already???  What does he have there???  NOTHING! It is the most frustrating and annoying thing that he and I deal with.   He called me at work, shortly after I got off the phone with Mariah.  I was very brisk with him, as I have been for the past two weeks.  NOTE TO BOYFRIEND----I won't be brisk with you if you ever picked up the fucking phone and called me!  Douchebag. We spoke for 35 seconds and then I said "Gotta go back to work".  He was noticably upset, but whatever.  As soon as I got off the phone with him, I sent him the following text message over his phone: "Sorry if I was quick on the phone.  You need to call me soon.  We have a few things we need to discuss." Of course it is now over an hour later and regardless of the curiousity he must have, it hasn't pushed him into calling me back. Fine.   Next weekend, Mariah is coming to NYC!  ROCK!  I will have to talk to her again to understand who she is coming to visit, the details, etc.  I think she may be spending the whole weekend with her friend Rachel.  They have MASSIVE amounts of work to do to prepare for Mariah's big move.  So I don't know if we will even get a chance to spend much time with her.  :( I am fighting the urge I have to go to Boston next weekend.  It's just that no matter how frustrated and upset I get with Paul, I still want to be with him and to hold him.  ARGH!  So I don't know what to do.  I don't want to go to Boston if Mariah is here in NYC...cuz that would be just ridiculous!  Man...who knows what the hell is going on these days. Rita and I just ran upstairs to sample some food that was leftover from this meeting.  The food was DIS-FUCKING-GUSTING! I did steal a soda to bring home though.  And it is a STEWARTS BRAND SODA!  Memble STEWARTS KELLY?  I just love those folks over there.  They make some damn good soda and ice cream too.  Back in Albany, there is a Stewarts on every corner.  They are always brown and in the shape of a little house.  However, the one right by my house in Albany is white and shaped like a peanut.   Ok...not a peanut...but not a little house either. On lunch today, I am going to fight for a woman's right to fight in combat and also for her right to kill her babies.  That way I can be the best feminist around.  Really...whatever I can do to improve my score.  Die babies.  Die. Ever had to shit so bad you could taste it?   Ever had to shit so bad you could taste it, but then nothing will come out?  I hate it.  That is how I feel right now. Maybe I should go try to "Push" for awhile. Peayce.

      I have two major goals for this summer.   The first is to obtain, through whatever means necessary, a flat stomach.  It is imperative that this happens.  I can't believe that it is already April 16th.  What have I been doing???  Shoving my face with everything I can get my hands on??? Oh yeah.  That is exactly what I have been doing. The second goal is to get a WICKED tan this summer.  Darker the better.  I have started tanning and now with the beautiful weather, I will be at the park soaking in the rays every single day.  I want to be African American.  Black, if you will.  Last summer, I kind of gave up on the whole "looking good" thing.  This summer...I MUST make up for lost time.   I guess I have a third goal...but this goal only happens if I accomplish goals one and two.  I would LOVE to go to a beach this summer.  I haven't been to a beach since like high school.  I don't go to pools, the ocean, the lake, or even a pond.  I will NOT be going to any sort of beach-esque place unless I have a flat stomach.  Not necessarily a 6-pack stomach, although that is ideal.  It simply has to be flat.  All I want to do is go to a beach, so can I keep up with the damn sit-ups???  I just have to keep reminding myself how wonderful it will be to be a part of the beach community.  CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH.  (This is me doing crunches at my desk.  And if I really do get this flat stomach...I get to buy an actual bathing suit!!!!  That is the best part.  I know the exact kind of trunks that I want...I just need to look decent in them.  I am hoping to have this all together by the beginning of July.   I should probably stop eating garbage one of these days too.  That would help.

      Blogger...this is your mother....blogger honey, I don't get your entries... A little  Rent  to start the day...imagine if Rent had a song about Blogger?  That would be the lamest thing on the planet. WHAT UP????????????? The weather outside is two things:  Frightful and Delightful all at the same time.  It feels good to have the sun shining down on my face.  The only real downfall to this whole thing is that I stink.  Actually the other downfall is that this weather is just the beginning.  Soon it will be much hotter, much muggier, and much more stink will exude from my pits.   And tits. But I LVOE it and the sun beaming this heavily on me makes me feel good inside.  Good and toasty.   Roti Boti. The "Roti Boti" is this little hole in the wall Indian (or some shit) restaurant near our house.  They have skewers of meat and chicken by the dozens.  It usually smells good there, but I don't know if we are fully allowed inside to eat.  It is all cultural and shit.  Rita promised me that she and I will go there at some point this summer to chow down on this ethnic, greasy, fried food.  We want Kelly to come too, but she has to PROMISE to eat a skewer of beef.  Hey, give the girl a nice full bodied glass of red wine, and she will eat the skewers by the pound.  ROTI BOTI here we come! Another night of not talking to Paul.  Yeah, that makes me happy, especially since he had all last night off from work.  I called him yesterday during the day and left a message, assuming that he would call me at some point last night....um......nope! So anyway... I just love elipses.  I use them always. I guess I don't really have much to say today.  Maybe a little bit later.

      HERE IS THE DEAL WITH PAUL--- We got some new problems forming.....oh great~! Things have been going SO well and I hate to say that we are facing some new dilemmas, but it is time to stop pretending like they aren't there.... Here is my story.... Mariah is moving to NYC by June 1st.   1)  Because of this, Paul and Mariah have been spending a GREAT deal of time together.  So much time in fact, that visits and phone calls to me have been kind of cast aside.   2)  When Mariah moves here, Paul has told me that he will be visiting me and Mariah at the same time.  Which means...he will spend one night with Me and one night with Mariah. 3)  When I call to talk to Paul, it is Mariah this and Mariah that.....he is concerned about his time with her and wants to spend every last waking moment with her before she moves.  :( SO...here I sit.  Dealing with these specific issues. Now look...I love Paul.  I love him so much it makes my heart explode with feelings of insecurity, he makes me sad, angry, and happy all at the same time.  And usually all for the same reason. (BTW...one of my boss's who doesn't drink, just walked in and was like: "Who had a drink at work today...I smell it."   UM!  It was so me.  But I lied...and now I chew gum for the rest of the shift) So Paul...uggles.  Here is my deal!  Paul and I have been living long distance for about a year and a half now.  I have been literally begging him to move since I moved and every time he just says simply: "No."   Now...see my point...I see Paul about once a month; if that...sometimes its more, but usually its less.  I have been lucky over the last couple of months with frequent visits, both on his part and on mine.  But it has never been enough...and by far...it has never been too much.  If Mariah moves here...and Paul plans to visit both she and I during the same visit, that means one night for her and one night for me.  NO FUCKING WAY! I am not about to let my visits with Paul go to one day a month.  It actually makes me really angry to think that I would have to sacrifice one of my two days in order for him to see her too.  It's not fair.  And by any means...it is NOT a relationship.  The biggest problem I have had with Paul, since I moved to NYC, is that we don't get enough time together.  He has never been one for the phone, so that kills any sort of phone relationship.  He refuses to talk over the phone and really...the only honest words he says are when he and I are face to face. He is breaking my heart.  I am trying so hard to have a relationship with him, but now he is limiting it once again! I want him to be best friends with Mariah.  I want so badly for him to have a person that he can go to to discuss his frustrations, anger, everything.  Mariah being this person is PERFECT because she is a good friend of mine as well and has the best, NEUTRAL perspective, on his and my relationship.  She understands BOTH sides and can honestly give real advice. HOWEVER...I can not and will not tolerate seeing him half the time I see him now.   Ok...stop! I am not going to sit here and act like I am a hard ass; that I will break up with him if I don't have it my way.  But it hurts.  A lot.  To think that he would even think this is normal to come and visit me and to spend half the time with her and not all the time with me.  I get so few hours with him as it is.  I never wanted a boyfriend that was long distance.  NEVER.  But unfortunately we don't get to plan these things.  If you fall in love...you fall in love.  :( I am not going to break up with him.  It is the farthest thing from my mind. But I will be honest when I say that it hurts.  A lot.  To know that I am going to suffer more in this relationship when Mariah moves.  If anything, I thought I would benefit from her moving, cuz then maybe he would too! I thought wrong. Paul is obsessed with Mariah.   I can accept that.  I am obsessed with my girls too.  I do not sit on the phone and discuss them to the point of nausea like he does, but I do understand what it is like to feel an attachment to one of your girls.  I live this every day...and not to one girl...to like 7. I am sad about this.  Is Paul really going to visit me once a month...spend one night with me and one night with Mariah? IF this is the case, he will spend both nights with Mariah.  I am sorry sweetheart...but this is killing me.  I am not going to compete with my friend for my boyfriend.  Not going to do it.  NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER going to do it.  One of the hardest things about this whole situation is that I want to make SURE that I don't give Mariah any shit for this.  It is SO not her fault.  It is no one's FAULT.  It is horrible circumstances.   The only solution I can think of to this problem is for him to move here.  How else can we fix this?  I can't justifiably say to him: "Visit me and only me", but I can't stand the thought that my visits get cut in half because she is moving here. (HUGE SIGH) I know this entry is jumbled.  I am a little drunk at work and not making full sense.  I also know that I am not being fully honest, cuz I know that there are other eyes reading this.  Mariah is one of my best friends...I love you baby.   But I don't know what to do about this.... Quite a dilemma.

      OMIGOD!  Penelope is fucking amazing!   If you are any sort of a person, you definitely know about a little show called  Small Wonder .  The premise: A little robot girl that lives with a suburban family.  Major hijinks ensue.  :) Here is a link to all of the Small Wonder your little heart can handle!    urlLink Small Wonder

      Don't you hate those weekends that go by so quickly, it is like it never happened in the first place?  I mean, don't get me wrong, I love having busy weekends...but the trade off...is really no time to just sit on your ass and do nothing.  I truly value my "do nothing" time.  Too much so.  That is why I am turning into an unmotivated asshole that doesn't even like getting up to go to the bathroom, cuz it's just "too hard".  Goodness. My visit with my mom was wonderful.  I knew it would be.   I showed up at her hotel, in Hicksville, Long Island at 5:50pm on Saturday.  I proceeded to sit on a bench and wait for her until 7pm.  Then I went to the car and sat and played this little hand held Yahtzee game until 8pm.  (The reason I was waiting is because she was shopping and told me that she may be running a few minutes late, but that she would meet me at the front of the hotel.  Well, at 8:15pm I go to the front desk of the hotel and ask them if they would just buzz her room so I could leave a message.  They say fine.  I call and lo and behold my mom answers and is like: "Where are you?"  I'm like: "Where are you????" She comes to the lobby and we both hysterically laugh over the fact that I have been waiting for 2 hours worrying my ass off.  I asked her: "Why didn't you just come to the lobby and check to see if I was here and lost or something."  She goes: "I was watching a movie."   LORD! So, we went and got gyros...then we had some wine together and smoked a bowl.  She didn't want to smoke in the room at first, but me and my whily ways talked her into it in 10 minutes flat.  We talked for hours and finally settled in to watch "Joyride" at 12:30am.  This is now like the 3rd time I have seen this movie.  It just gets better every time.  WINKLES~~ Talking to my mom was wonderful.  My parents are being so supportive about the whole Paul thing.  My mom asked me a million questions about him this weekend.  She told me a lot of personal stuff.  We shared, we laughed, and I just fell in love with her all over again. On Sunday, we went tanning, shopping, had lunch and just talked a whole lot more.  She bought me a new outfit for the big dinner coming up at work.  She spent an astronomical amount of money on me this weekend.  I can't believe her generosity.  She is so good to me.  GOD>>>>>>>>>>>I just LOVE this woman.  She is everything to me.  EVERYTHING. The ride home from the Island took me 35 minutes.  That included filling the car with gas.  UM!  The quickest trip ever!  It was so easy. Next Saturday, my parents are coming down with my Granny and we are all going to lunch and then on to a performance of   urlLink The Producers .  I wasn't looking forward to seeing this show at all, but now I kind of am.  Being with my family is the best part, but seeing a show, which I can be proud to say I have seen, is a close second.  It will probably not be as good with out Matthew or Nathan, but to be honest...they weren't that much of an attraction for me anyway.  To be brutally honest...the show seems kind of dumb.  But I will report on it next Monday. Rita and I have this friend named Jessica.  She is coming to visit this weekend.  She kind of invited herself down for the weekend, in usual Jessica fashion.  She actually tricked Rita into inviting her.   Jessica wrote me about a week ago saying that she desperately needed to come to NYC.  She needed to escape from Utica for a weekend and just get away from a lot of things that were going on in her life.  She wanted to come down either last weekend or this up-coming one.  I said no to both weekends, cuz I knew that I wouldn't be around.  "How about May?" I asked her.   Next thing I know, she goes to Rita and says: "I DESPERATELY need to get out of Utica.  Can I come down for the weekend?"  Rita was like: "Sure what is going on????"  Rita was rather worried.   Jessica goes: "Oh, nothing.  Just sick of grading papers and dealing with the kids (in her class)." TRICKY BITCH that one is!  Whatever.  And she is bringing her boyfriend Ryan, who is a nice guy, but straight out of Creepsville. Rita and I swear that he wants to suck both of our dicks, but who knows... So Jessica will be coming for the weekend.  I told Reets that I am kind of excited to see her.  Haven't seen the girl since Rockin New Year's Eve.  She is fun.  We laugh alot and deep down, she is a wonderful girl.  Whatever problems Rita and I have with her don't stand up to the fact that Jessica is one of our best peeps from way back.  WAY back.  Sometimes Rita wants to smack Jessica.  Most of the times, I just want to take back the pot that she steals from me.  Speaking of which...lordy.  I gotta get a bag for when she comes down this weekend.  UGH!  Can she ever just bring some???  She will bring some, but it will be a nugget the size of a pea and I am sure she will smoke it before she even gets to NYC.  But oh yeah...I am really excited to see her. Kelly will be around this weekend, so she will be able to hang too.  Kelly and Jessica are friends from way back as well.  Jessica is the first person that Kelly got to know in 56B.  I remember Kelly and Jessica being something called: "Sugar Twins" or some shit.  They were busom buddies for a while.  It will be nice for them to see eachother again. I saw Angie yesterday for a bit.  She looks great.  Her hair looks good, she had some color in her cheeks.  It was funny, Rita and I were just about to go rent a movie and we ran into Angie on the porch.  In the middle of Rita and Angie's talk, I interupt and say: "Sorry to cut this short, but we gotta go."  Angie is like "Doh?...Okay".  Rita, being the perfect partner in crime, doesn't question me...she just turns and goes.  Once we get down the steps to our house, she turns and realizes why we had to bolt.  Coming down the street, with two of his FUGLY friends is Angie's roommate FUCK FACE.  It was the first run in that I have really had with him.  We didn't say hi or nuttin.  We just walked right away and drove to Blockbuster.  Well, actually we brought the wrong keys to the car, so we had to wait for FUCK FACE to go back inside and then we had to get the other key.  Whoops. It was funny.   We have this ACCREDITATION TEAM at work today analyzing our validity as a Jewish Organization.  It's more complicated than that...but I can't get into it without fully revealing where I work.  In any case, this ACCREDITATION TEAM has to meet with each of us for 15 minutes to discuss our job descriptions.  I am DREADING it.  Why?  It will be totally painless and I know it, but every time I think of it, I get a pang of annoyance in my gut.   Gut.  Can I not have one anymore?  Back to salads and yogurt.  :( Just about time for a smoke.  PHEW!  Not going crazy cuz I need one, but sometimes it just feels real good to burn your throat out some more.   And it tastes like corn.  Jessica Corn.   Last night before going to sleep, I watched  Hannibal .  Memble Hannible?  The sequel to  Silence of the Lambs .  There were two scenes in it that made me squirm so badly I almost ripped my face off with a piece of glass.  Oh no.  That is a scene from the movie.  BARF.  I really sat clutching my face during two parts.  The movie, as a whole, aint all that great, but gory as fuck?  Yes sir!  Julianne Moore, whom I usually love, plays the same character, Clarise Starling, that Jodi Foster played in the original.  Umm....memo to Julianne....don't do that again.   So see it if you want.   Rita and I watched  The Amityville Horror  before retiring to out respective rooms.  We thought Kelly was going to be home and thought it to be a nice family movie...but she had rehearsal late.  The movie was so ridiculous at times, but so scary at times too.  Watch it to laugh.  Oh.  And also to cry.  I will tell you one thing..."Get OUT!"  (You will know if you see it) Alright...peayce!  Be back later.

      Well, I just woke up and had phone sex.  That is always a good start to any Saturday.   It's funny, cuz I do the phone sex thing once in awhile...NEVER paying for it...just talking to guys I meet in the appropriate chat rooms....and sometimes it turns out great and sometimes I want to die laughing. Today for example...I met this huge beast of a man.  We have some hot cyber chat and then I ask him if he "does phone".  He says "Sure".  I call him up and the most flaming gay man answers.  Not THAT flaming, but too flaming for him to be some world reknowned bodybuilder.  In any case, I choke back the laughter and still finish with him.  LOLOL.  After I was done, I go: "Thanks Mike.  See you round".  And click off.  He was like: "Uh?"   Now on with my day... I'm leaving in a couple of hours to go see my mom on Long Island.  I have to shower and eat something.  I am looking forward to seeing the mother.  It should be fun.  We will get a chance to talk and tomorrow, she is supposed to take me to the mall to get something to wear for the big dinner coming up at work.  I have nothing in my closet tha is even close to acceptable.  Well, I could wear a wife beater.  I surely have enough of those. The cat has been licking his vagina for like an hour now.   ewe. Short entries for the last two days, but I really have nothing to say.  I like to check i (do you see how that "n" has a little thing on it?  Sometimes when I type on Rita's computer, my fingers must hit some shift button, cuz all these crazy letters come up.  Sort of like wingdings, but maybe even hieroglyphics of some sort). It's a beautiful day.  This morning I happened to catch a bit of the weather channel and it said that on Wednesday, it is going to be 82 degrees in NYC.  80 fucking 2 degrees in April?  Um?  That shit is fucked up. Phone's ringing... The African's upstairs are once again destroying their own apartment.  What the fuck do they DO up there? I swear, one of these days, one of their little black bodies is going to come crashing through the roof and end up on our kitchen table.   Alright...peayce.

      One more hour until Rita and I get to go home and play on the roof.  YAYAYAYAYAY!  Having the roof makes the world such a better place.   So about an hour ago...I answer the phone and this is the conversation that happens: Me:  Shalom Hillel. Mysterious Voice:  Yeah...um...I need to speak to As*a Vai**m*n. (I hide her identity to protect her from harm) Me:  I can't give you her phone number, but I can transfer you to her extension. MV:  Thanks. I transfer him and about 4 minutes later the phone rings again... Me:  Shalom Hillel Mysterious Voice:  Hi.  You just transferred me to an extension that is not for As*a Vasi**m*n. Me:  Oh.  I transferred you to the number on my contact sheet.  I don't know why it didn't work. MV:  Why don't you give me the number and I will call her myself. Me:  Maybe I should ask who is calling. MV:  This is Brian Dennehey. Me:  (BRIAN FUCKING DENNEHEY????  UM!!!) Brian:  (waiting patiently) Me:  Ok...I will give you the number and hold for a minute and I will see if I have a second number. B:  Sure. (I rifle through the Columbia Database trying to find this girl's number)(It takes me forever, but I locate it) Me:  Hi Brian.  The number is: shumma shum shum, shumma shum shum. B:  Thanks.  Have a great day. Me:  You too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  (my heart is all a flutter at this point) -----end scene----- I mean...I have lived in NYC for over a year now and the only famous thing I have seen is the back of Natalie Portman's head.  But today I spoke with THE Brian Dennehey.  Oh man.  Ask Penelope...I was so nervous and really tried to rush off the phone as quick as possible.  I don't know what to do in the presence of royalty.  He's fucking Willy Lowman from  Death of a Salesman  for God's sakes.   Today has flown by.  I am ready to bust out of here.  I got a lot of work done today, a lot of play done today, and I had a fucking awesome lunch.  Grilled Cz and fries at Tom's Restaurant.  You know Tom's right?  The outside is the home of the Seinfeld diner.   Rita had split pea soup and a bagel.  I tried her soup, convinced that I would hate it and I loved it!  (The bagel looked pretty exceptional as well) I figure...if I like lentil soup, I must like split pea, huh? Okay...I am so going now.  If I reduce these entries to the food consumed by me every day, someone smack me in the mouth and call me a fag.

      Good morning!  Well! What a beautiful day, again!  Is this for real?  Is it going to be summer again before we even know it?  Man.  At this rate, I am going to be 73 before I even know it.  Uggles.  I really just want to stop and smell the roses, but the days just meld into one and uggles again. It seems like 12 minutes ago I was dreading starting my first full week of work after the holidays...but now it is THURSDAY!  Can you believe it?  Time flies when things are going smoothly.  Time does NOT fly however, when you are angry, miserable, and alone.  Somewhat like a certain boy, I know.   Paul is sad.  Real sad.  I can tell.  He hasn't said much to me about it, but I can just tell.  I am pretty good with the intuition thing and it's working overtime right now.  He doesn't call me really...he doesn't talk about what is bothering him.  It's like pulling teeth.  However, considering that I am exactly the same way, I have an understanding and a respect for the way he handles it.  A respect that most people don't have with me.  So it would be totally inappropriate for me to get frustrated or upset with him.  I will just try to be as patient as I can be. Penelope has this little candy turtle that she keeps on her desk.  She has had it for weeks and we keep thinking that it is going to get stolen or eaten.  Penelope has named this turtle "Gums".  His name makes me die laughing!!!  After every weekend, she and I come in to work and quickly look to see if Gums has been fatally injured or even kidnapped.  Yet, he has survived so far.  You go Gums!  You go. I spoke with my mom last night for a while.  She is damn adorable.  It's funny how different my relationship is with both of my parents.  My dad is a very neutral party in whatever case I present to him.  My mom viciously takes my side in everything.  I need them both as a balance and I find that it works out quite nicely.  For example, when the whole shit went down with my uncles, my dad was pretty level-headed about the whole thing.  He said that we were all being oversensitive and shumma shum.  But as for my mom (and it's her brother), she said: "Well, your uncles can be little bitches and don't worry about it.  They are this and this and this and this."  She is easily convinced by me on any topic.  Not that she is convinced per se, but always willing and able to take my side in anything.  I love that.  So we talked last night and I gave her the low down on work, friends, family life, and Paul.  She was so funny about everything and by the time I got off the phone with her I felt worlds better about a lot of the little things going on.  For the most part, I am in this place of balance and traquility.  I explained to her how relaxed and happy I have been lately and she was more excited about that than just about anything I have ever accomplished.  Both of my parents, as with most of my friends parents, only want for their children to be happy.  My parents went through my "depression" with me.  They stood and held my hand during the entire battle.  They took me to doctor after doctor, helped set me up with therapists and even assisted me in finding the right medication for myself.  So when I tell my parents that I feel "good" these days, they are overjoyed, excited, and I am sure, in some way, relieved.   But at what price does happiness come?  Is it at the sacrifice of other things?   The only worry that I have in my head these days is that things will shift and I will find myself in the same position that I was last week at this time.  Not that it was just last week...the last battle was about a year long leading up to last week.   There were good days.  There were GREAT days.  But I just feel different now, better.  And I know it's not permanent or forever...but I will take this experience and appreciate it for as long as I can.  And hopefully, above everything else, I will learn from it, so that next time I might be better equipped at digging myself out of the hole that I often fall into. Guess time will tell.... So...another day!  Sun shining, people smiling, good feeling day! Take a deep breath and jump in.

      So tonight...Rita and I came home.  Well, usually we DO come home, but tonight was just a little bit different.  We took a cab home cuz we were feeling care-free and fancy-free.  We arrived at the house at 5:45pm, after having the most interesting cab ride of our lives.  It was just so thought provoking and intriguing that even Rita and I couldn't find a way to fully discuss it.   When we got home, we decided to have a glass of wine on our porch.  She was waiting for her parents to call and I was waiting for her....well...er...parents to call!  So, we get our glasses of wine, play with the baby for a minute and walk calmly, but steadily to the porch.  (calmly, but steadily...adjectives that are totally unnecessary at this point of the story).  We walk to the front of the house, laughing and talking VERY LOUDLY when I open the first door.  I then go to open the second, and last door, when I look out the window and see Angie's roommate FUCK FACE sitting on the front steps.  I froze in my tracks.  I mean...WHAT?  We had just gotten home like 8 minutes earlier.  Where the fuck did fuck face come from?  Fuck, fuck and fuck!   So I spin on my axle and look at her with the fear.  Fear of DEATH that is.  I say "go".   I say "go".  If you were here right now, you would understand how "I say 'go'" is funny.  You would.  I say it to myself and I laugh.  I'm actually still laughing.  Still...even now still. Okay I have stopped. Rita and I immediately high-tail it back to the apartment and once inside I say: "It's FUCK FACE!  He is on the stairs!"  We pass a look of horror and then invent "the point" of my whole story.....(elipses) Having to decide where to drink our glass of wine, I say: "Come with me."  Rita follows me into my room, onto my bed, and out of my window.   Outside the window is a miniature roof, 2 feet off the ground.  No bigger than me laying down.  And a little wider, but that is only cuz I am halfway to fat ass at this point. We sit on the "roof".  As we begin to smoke our cigarettes and drink our wine, Rita and I both stop to realize that we have just discovered our new hang-out.   Now this is a big deal... Rita and I became BFF when I moved into 56B Liberty Street.  The place that changed both Rita and my life forever.  Ask Kelly about it...she is the only person I have left in my life that understands 56B. Within 56B were 6 people.  (And you know what folks...at this point, I am using real names for minor characters.  I can't keep this shit straight in my head anymore).  Stacey, Jessica, Nina, Erica, Amy, and Joe.  In no particular order.  The 5 of them lived in the house a whole year before, but in my place was a girl names Terri.  (A girl who lives in NYC presently, but none of us talk to on a regular basis...maybe Erica and Stacey, but thats bullshit)   I REPLACED Terri.  End of story.  Debate it all you want...and boy some of these girls will...I replaced Terri.  Okay...that was an unnecessary tangent and now I laugh at myself.  Okay laughing................................................... done. Us 6 were unique and compatible.  There was always a fight going on between someone, but with 6 people it always worked out.  There was always "somewhere to go".   But the ONE PLACE.  The ONLY place where we could all go and be serene was our roof.   The 56B roof was a good 8-9 feet off the ground; 13 at its' hightest point.  Cuz it sloped, you see.  Sloped upwards.  So you always felt like you were falling off.  (I am laughing again.  But this time...nostalgically.) On the roof, the 6 of us (and it was dangerous for 6, usually 12 people on the roof, but we did it) just sat and drank our beers, smoked our butts and just fucking bullshitted.  It was perfect.  It was the reason you moved into 56B.   At some point, I will get into each of these 5 girls and explain why they are perfect; why each of them has flaws and perfection wrapped into themselves. Good people. Very good. So when Rita and I realized that we were sitting on the roof and that it just felt "good", I, for one remembered all the aforementioned.  Wow.   As much as the memories are important and, at this time of my life, so wonderful, I see, for this moment, a new place for the future to take hold.  I see Kelly, Rita and I sitting on the roof this summer and just being.  I see us talking...laughing...sharing...letting go with eachother.  It is our  . How much fun???  And when certain people come over, we can invite them to the roof.   "Hey", we'll say, "You seem like a cool person.  Have ya been to the roof?" I just can't wait.  So tonight ends well.   I feel so relaxed, so calm, so...real.  Is it the calm before the storm?  They say that and it's creepy to think that.   But...great!  Now that I have thought it.....the sounds of crickets outside and the warm spring breeze blowing through the window onto my face is bugging me out!!!! or maybe it's the pot.   whatever....it's always the pot. So I guess that is it.  Wanted to share something that made a difference in my day today. Right now Rita is seeing her parents.  (Big sigh) I am just really excited for her.  The bullshit that she went through to get to this point just adds up to an even more incredible experience. ****Realized tonight that this is no longer a journal.  This has become a way of communicating with each and every one of the people in my life without ever telling them face forward. ******Not what I wanted this to be. *********Not what I intended it to be. ************Hungry now. ****************MMMM.....hot dogs..... So you see... I just look back and read what I have written in the past, because in some way...it's my mini-portfolio.  Not marketable in any way, but my personal portfolio. (And if you really believe that I don't think this shit is marketable, you are lost) (WINKLES!!!) I saw the actual progression from me writing a "journal" type entry to me just writing about and for people I know.  I am suprised anyone not connected to the 4 people in my life even read me.  They just see that I am gay and then they think: "Oh....well gay...he must be a slut...I will write him a discusting and crude email!"   Great idea. But overall, it's my way of communicating with my 4 closest.  5 if you count Edward...but are we counting Edward at this point? I guess that is it.   I still have to do my "Real World" recap from last night's episode, but that will have to wait until I am at work and getting paid to write it.   Member when people said "Peace in the middle East" as like a saying?  I remember it from college or highschool, but I never said it, so I don't know it's true origin.  It was synonymous with "Catch ya Later" and "See ya around".  Well now awadays....Peace in the Middle East, huh?  Weird.   Alright guys.  Girls.  Whoever happens to read this entry.  I wrote a lot today so who knows if anyone will get this far.  Rita is with her parents.  Kelly is at class.  Penelope is at an interview.  wow.  What a day.  What a week.  Man.  What an experience.  I wouldn't trade any of it for a second. Peace in the middle east y'all.

      I was just talking to Paul and he asked me how my week is going.  I told him "fine" and then I stopped for a moment.  It's more than "fine".  It is calm and wonderful.  Monday started out like shit for a number of reasons, but yesterday was better and today is just MAHvelous.  It has been a beautiful week weather wise, work hasn't been too bad, and as Mary J. Blige would sing: "No more drama in my life."  I have been in contact with quite a few friends, my family, and even those that I had separated from for one reason or another.  I feel happy.  I feel alive.  I feel good.   Unfortunately, Paul is not doing so good.  He is lonely without his Mariah already and she doesn't even move for another month.  He also went on and on about how without Mariah, he feels like he really has nothing.  I left him, she is leaving him, it's a tough situation.  How do I say "Come here and be with me" any other way than I have already?  I hate feeling so good when he feels so bad.  He deserves better than that.  I can give him better than that. Uggles. In any case, Rita and I are going to lunch soon.  Probably at The West End.  She has got to be chomping at the bits to see her parents tonight!  So exciting!!!  She and I had a wonderful talk last night (not that all talks aren't wonderful) and I think that is contributing to how calm I feel right now.   Even when she has other shit going on, she has time for me and that is so important.

      When I was first thinking about moving to NYC, I was under one definite misconception. In Manhattan, not necessarily Queens, I was sure that there were going to be beautiful people on every corner.  Everyone would be wearing the best clothes, have the best style, and they would all be HOTT!  However, this is completely false.  Not only are most people nasty, but the city stinks of poo alot.  And on top of that, I see more homeless men/women then I see Wall Street Bankers.  True, I work nowhere near the Stock Market, so that could account for the minimal number of bankers I see, but still!  Where are my Abercrombie and Fitch models?  Where are my celebrities?  Where are my high profile lawyers?  Do they even exist?  I know they are here somewhere, but hells if I can meet one.   The one thing I didn't count on was how much I was going to love living here.  I have lived in very few, but more than 5 places in my life.  I have never felt the pride that I feel when I say I live in NEW YORK CITY.  There is a definite community here.  There is a reason why tourists swarm the city.  I have lived in New York State my whole life.  Never anywhere else.  But until the last year and a half, I have never felt like a true New Yorker.  I do now.  I am one.  I guess I have always been one, but now I feel like I understand what it means.  It's one thing to say it.  It's another thing to boast it.  But to really feel it...now that is something special.   I feel it very strongly.   I don't think that I am one of these people that will spend my life in the big city.  I definitely have the need to be in California.  But for the time being, I am so happy where I am.  I wouldn't trade this up for anything in the world. It is harder to live here and that sucks sometimes.  Overall, the city is very expensive.  My commute to work is no less than an hour.  I deal with obnoxious people every single day.  And doing little things like my laundry or grocery shopping is more of a hassle than it is worth it.  But deep down I love it.  I have already adapted to it and now I am starting to really enjoy it.  It only took me a year to get to this point.  Not so bad. There is a real community here.  I feel safe on the subways, safe on the streets, safe in most bars, just really quite safe in whatever I do.  I feel protected.  I feel independent.  And I feel more confident than I have ever felt before in my life. I do believe that the city is not for everyone.  Honestly, I don't think the city is right for some of my closest friends.  People have different needs and personalities.  Not everyone is going to adapt in the same way.  But in either case, there is FUN to be had.  There is always something to do.  The city never sleeps.  True, I would prefer having enough money to be comfortable AND to still have a blast...but you can't have it all. So I prefer having a blast. In my opinion, September 11th didn't create New Yorkers.  New Yorkers were always New Yorkers.  But after the disaster, the world woke up to the true definition of what a New Yorker is.  Most people (me included) believed that NY'ers were rude, angry, and only in it for personal achievement and satisfaction.  I was so very wrong.  The people here are definitely aggressive.  They are absolutely here for personal happiness.  They are real.  They are blunt.  And they are allowing me to become exactly like them.  To become exactly what I have always wanted to be. I am by nature the kind of person that doesn't want to step on people's toes.  Ever.  I try to be as nice as I can.  Hurting someone's feelings hurts mine in turn.  In fact, up until a couple of months ago, I had a real problem being honest with the people close in my life.  I was just too afraid to stand up for ME.  I don't like to fight.  I have never been someone who enjoys arguing and I am still not the type of person that will get into a heated debate with someone over anything based on opinion.  As far as I am concerned, you can believe you are right as long as I don't have to agree with you.   NYC is making me stronger.  It is making it so that I have a voice.  I am no longer afraid to tell the people in the subway to "fuck off".  I can call my family and friends now and not beg for forgiveness for things I really didn't do.  I am not scared to get into an arguement with my friends because I know that we will be friends forever.  If Penelope and I have a fight at work, she and I can simply walk away and I know it will be fine.  Having a friend means never having to kiss their ass.  And I know this now.  NYC has opened up my eyes and mind.  Being a guy that is always ruled by my heart, it was very difficult to tell anyone in my life that they were screwing up.   Most importantly, I have realized that I am here in this city for me and me alone.  I am here to be an actor.  I am here to grow and to learn.  It is like the education that you never get in college.  The education of how to be a strong, capable adult.  It feels wonderful to know that I am only responsible for me.  It feels so good that I can see the growth.  At 25, I am in a different place than I was at 24, and at 26...25 will seem like childhood.  The one good thing about getting older is the wisdom that goes along with it. NYC is growing me up in a way that no other city has.  I am becoming strong and self-sufficient.  And above all this, I am happier than I have ever been in my life. Last night I spoke on the phone with my dad for almost 2 1/2 hours.  I meant to only call him and catch up with him and the next thing I know we are talking about everything from work to every personal relationship that I have.  Gosh.  The wisdom this man has just blows my mind.  He believes in me and takes my side without being petty.  He supports me unconditionally and he gives me confidence in my decisions.  He is my father and my friend and somehow has managed to find a balance at that.  I asked him the following question: "How did you know...I mean really KNOW that you were in love with mom?  How did you know that marriage was the next step?" We spoke on this topic for a good hour.  I went into the conversation thinking one thing and was relieved when I walked out of it thinking another.  He and my mom have been married 26 years, so they must be doing something right.  I hope to follow in his same path.  And maybe with Paul.... My dad and I talked about marriage, about children, and about Paul fitting into all of this.  WOW.  It was pretty intense.  But it was perfect.  I wouldn't have changed any part of the conversation.  He invited Paul and I to spend a weekend with them at my house in Albany.  He also invited us to Cape Cod in August and to Provincetown in November.  He invited US.  Just US.  I can't believe it.  The effort he is making is astronomical.  Paul and I will definitely be doing one of these visits, if not all of them.  I want and need them to get to know he and I, as a couple, away from my friends and my brother.  I want them to see why he and I work; why after all the heartache that Paul and I have been through, things are better now than they ever have been.  Being in love isn't just springtime and hearts.  There's definitely a little shit thrown in there too.  But you know you are meant to be if you can deal with the shit and still find that love.  Not just deal with it.  If you can accept it and move forward because of it.  Even more than that.  If you can accept it as partly your fault and know that their are things that you need to do to make it all better.   After the last time that Paul and I broke up, I cried for days.  I missed him.  I was angry at him and said that I needed to be treated better.  I believed that I deserved more and that he was destroying me as a person.   I am so glad that my maturity stepped in and that I realized that a relationship is a two-way street.  Nothing more, nothing less.  I could have never took my step down and Paul and I never would be where we are today.  The last 4 months with him have been better than the 2 years before it.  I would have missed out on him growing as well.  I am so glad that I didn't make this mistake.  And now, my parents fully want a part of him and above everything else, that makes me feel the best.  I AM IN LOVE and I am happy.  God. I never thought those words would ever be in the same sentence.  And they are.  And it is honest.  And what a relief.   This entry has gone in a million directions today.  I have been typing it for hours it seems.  I do think they are all correlated and together they make the full picture.   Here is my thesis statement:  Family, friends, and boyfriend, do not make you the person you want to be.  They can assist in guiding you down the right path, but the responsibility of growing up and accepting the consequences of your actions is all your own.

      So the FUNNIEST and COOLEST thing happened this afternoon.   I went out to have a quick cigarette.  Well, actually I had two.  Sick bitch that I am. I come back up to my office and Penelope is on the phone and Rita is going ballistic.  Okay, not so ballistic.  More like FUCKING INSANE!  SIKE! Anyway...there is this big hullabaloo about Penelope and the phone call she is fielding.  Rita goes: "Penelope is talking to Brian Dennehey".  I am like, "SHUT THE FUCK UP RITA!"  Ok, never.  But of course I never believed that Brian was really on the phone.  Eventually Penelope gets off the phone and sure enough...it was THE Brian Dennehey.  You see, he was calling us to try to book our Klezmer Band.  There is a whole big story behind it, but really the only important part is that because Mr. Dennehey called here, I am now famous.  By association.  I knew it was just around the corner.  I just didn't realize how quickly I was going to turn that corner.   So, if you be looking for me, check with Brian Dennehey's secretary.  She will tell you where we are.

      Well that was quick.  I caught up with my work real fast today.  I mean, let's not get our hopes up.  I am sure that 37 projects will find their way to my desk by noon, but at least for now I am free. Sorta hungry.  But must wait until lunch.  I find that my stomach can hold about 17 pounds of food these days.  I can sit and eat a 3 course meal and still walk away with hunger pangs.  What is the deal?  I must have stretched my stums so big that now I can have a baby.  And really that is all I ever wanted.  A baby that I can use to clean my room, wash my clothes, and give me massages.  Oh the life of having a baby.   Oh yes folks...tonight is The Real World.  Oh yes. Tonight, Chris the fag pinches Kara on her love handles and she bugs.  He is a stupid fuck.  I will kill his alcoholic ass if he tells anyone that they are "shameful" tonight. Hmmmm...........still hungry.  Cept now I gotta piss too. This weekend, I am going to spend the night in Long Island with my motha.  No my real motha.  Not my motha fucka.  He will be in Boston this weekend.  Alone.  My mom is on business for all of this week.  This will be the third time I have visited her during her stay on the Island.  We always do the same thing.  Saturday night, we will drink some wine together and talk.  Then we usually watch a movie and eat some food.  This time the movie will be "Joyride", I think.  I know she will love it.  Last year we watched "Requiem for a Dream" and she LVOED it.  I hope she lvoes "Joyride" as well.   On Sunday, she makes me trek my ass to TJ MAXX and buys me some clothes.  She just loves TJ MAXX.  I kind of hate it and I usually end up only getting clothes for work.  Sometimes you can find something cool, but most of the time it is tapered pants with pleats.  Secretly I think she only invites me so that she has someone to make the 3 mile walk with.  Last year we got so lost on the walk that it took about 2 hours to get back to the hotel.  It was excruciating.  But being with my mom is one of my absolute favorite things to do in the world, so it was totally worth it.  I am actually really excited to spend some time with just her.  She and I haven't chilled together in a while and I miss it.   Tonight I have to call my dad and Mariah.  With my mom being away on business, my dad gets real lonely and that is when I try to give him a ring.  I really need to talk to Mariah as well.  She has some major shit going down and I couldn't reach her last night. Only a month and a half until she lives here!!!!!!!!!!!  I FUCKING CAN'T WAIT!  I plan to be at her and Rachel's apartment all the time.  It is going to seriously rock.  And besides having her in the city, I am going to have some new friends!!!  At this point I have about 4.  I mean, of course I know people, but not like I know Mariah.  And with Mariah comes a slew of really wonderful people that I have had the pleasure of spending some time with.  They are all great and I just adore them.  So yeah...very excited. When I went to the bathroom mirror this morning, I noticed a new present that God gave me.  A huge red lump on the side of my face.  What??  How did this happen?  I mean, sometimes you go to bed and wake up beautiful.  But more often than not, you wake up to discover new craters and volcano's on your face.  I am almost 25.  I need the acne to go away now please.   Well, I also need my man body to come soon too.  So maybe I am essentially just waiting for puberty to end.  That's normal.  Most people are still going through puberty at 25.  Definitely. SOOOOOOOOOO....Rita's parents are coming in from Germany tomorrow for a visit!  Yikes!  She is so overwhelmed and thrilled to see them.  All of these emotions at once.  And to be honest, Rita likes it smooth.  Not really with curve balls thrown in.  And this week, she has been presented with quite a few sliders.  Or curve balls.  Or dummies.  Is there a dummy pitch?  I think there is. Unfortunately, because Rita's parents think that she lives in the slums (WINKLES!), they will not be staying in our house.  I was really counting on seeing them, at least for dinner, but hey...do I complain?  They are here from Germany.  If they wanted me dressed in drag, I would probably do it.  Just so their trip could be that much more special.  But something tells me her ARMY COLONEL father wouldn't be having me in a dress.  Unless it was cut real low.  Rita...good luck and I really am brimming with excitement for you.  Make the best of it.  And bring a LouisVille Slugger with you.  You know what for.  And if you don't, I will tell you later. Kelly is having this party for her theater troupe on Friday.  It is supposed to be $8 all you can drink.  I am very heavely debating going.  It should be a good time and it will be nice to hang with her and Angie for a bit.  It's really the only exciting plans I have all weekend, so I kind of am excited.  I prolly won't know anyone and end up letting someone do me in the bathroom just so I can make friends.  It happens. I don't know if I have mentioned this already or not, but I am currently juggling between two books Miss Penelope gave me.  One is Naked by David Sedaris.  The other is GlamourPuss by mmmmmmmmm.......glamourpuss. I love them both.  Obviously I love the David Sedaris book more cuz he is my homegirl.  But Glamourpuss has sex and acting and drama and I just love it.  It is a trashy novel, but so enjoyable for that reason.  I never juggle two books at once.  It drives me crazy.  However, the Sedaris book consists of short stories that go chapter by chapter.  And the Glamspuss isn't all that "heavy" of a book, so I can really pick it up right where I left off.  It's just great. If I were you, I would buy a David Sedaris book ASAP.  If you are trashy gay male, which I know some of you are...I would check out Glamourpuss.  The end. I am definitely rambling today.  Sometimes it feels good to just free flow, you know?  Sometimes it also feels good to make dough, hey Joe.  Other times it is nice to go slow, cuz rut row!  That was a rhyme written by Scooby Doo. So hungry at this ponit. And almost time for a smoke. When am I going to quit?  Hopefully never. I just sat here staring at my computer screen for a full two minutes.  Just sitting and staring.  It was weird.   I think I am going to go have my cigarrette and ponder why I am so weird.   YOU'RE WEIRD!

      I am so glad that today is today and that today is not yesterday.  I am going to do everything in my power to make this new day go smoothly.  It is beautiful outside.  So warm and inviting.  I got a great nights sleep and now I feel ready to tackle yet another long ass work day.   My goal: to remain as carefree as possible over the next few weeks.  Just take some deep breaths, relax, think and act only on positive thoughts.  Shit was starting to really crumble around me recently and I hated it.  No more.   AHHHHHHHHH.......let it go, let it go. Alright, got some shits to do, but I will surely be back!

      What a fucking rollercoaster today has been.  MAN ALIVE!  It's kind of like a 360 (insert degree sign here) circle.  Like I said earlier today...I woke up in this great mood!  Then I go to work and my life falls apart.  Then I come home...(dramatic pause)...and life gets better again!  Shit.  Days like today confuse the fuck out of me, but at the same time remind me that nothing is impossible.   Angie and I met up tonight in order to exchange the car key.  THE INFAMOUS CAR KEY!  (sorry, i am feeling exceptionally ridiculous right now) When she came, she brought a bowl,  Not your ordinary ball you prudes...a bowl of gangia.  I called it a "peace offering".  And I guess...to be honest...we smoked the "Peace Pipe" and it actually worked.  ROFLROFLROFLROFLROFL. enough. She was very honest and suddenly I was in this "I am patient and understand all my wrong doings" phase.  I listened and then she listened.  We discussed and we squashed it.  That is how we do it in these parts folks...we discuss and we squash it.   We did, however, discuss one Miss "Fuck Face" roommate.  I explained to Angie the following: Me:  Listen Angie...this is tough.  I don't know how to work around avoiding fuck face while still trying to visit you in your apartment. Angie:  Joe, understand that I want you to be honest and just tell me why you feel this way and what you want. J:  (relieved that I can finally let go about this issue with her) Ange baby....(okay I did NOT say "Ange baby")...Fuck face and I have given it a shot.  I have never felt comfortable around him and I do believe that he provides a very negative energy to any group that I am in.  I think that he and I are like 'oil and water' and that we are just not meant to be friends.  (I then proceed to apologize to HER for what happened a couple of weeks ago at the doorbell)(I explain that I was a) being obnoxious by causing the whole problem and b) trying to protect one of my girls from fuck face's wrath.)(Okay, no more parentheses)(how does one spell parantheses?)(anyway)(lol)(snicker snicker) enough. A: I fully agree.  Fuck face feels the same way and he understands that he isn't welcome down in your apartment.  He would rather just be cool if you see him and leave it at that. J:  Amazing.  That is exactly what I want.  No little talk.  No shumma shum.  Nothing.  You stay in your hole I stay in mind.  (obviously I said much more than that....but either way I was relieved)  I think if Fuck face understands that you and I are trying to buildup our separate friendship that everything will be fine.   A:  Me too.   ----end scene---- Everything else was water under the bridge.  I do need to make a much more conserted effort to spend time with Angie.  She has, and always will be, one of the most special people in my life.  In some ways, my relationship with her suffered due to a lot of other things that I got goin.  I let it slip and that wasn't right.  I accept it.  I think that once she and I get our act together with this whole thing, Angie and I can really go the distance on this friendship thing.  It is hard for me to say that considering the fact that I am one of the first people to close the door in your face.  God...Cancers...can you live with em?  Cuz I KNOW you ain't livin without em!!!! So Kelly...two things: 1)  Thank you for being neutral on this whole issue.  You played it like a genius and I whole-heartedly trust going into this thing with Angie with your full support.  I know the support was always there...but the issue in my head wasn't so clear.  Now it is and I thank you for being so chill.  And understanding.   2)  You got the brunt of my shit today didn't you?  I know I really let go on you.  It wasn't completely appropriate and for that I am sorry.  Being a best friend isn't always peaches and roses, huh?  I still meant a lot of what I said, but I think that a talk is definitely in need; just to keep everything up to date and whole.  Whether you realize it or not, you and I (us, if you will) are in a great place right now.  We are evolving and we are changing.  Something we never expected, but have been long over due for.  Maybe we aren't changing so much individually...maybe the drastic change is within us.  Just something I have been thinking about... NOW FOR ALL OF YOU....sorry that none of this entry is something you want to read.  I wrote it for my main bloggers: Penelope, Rita,Kelly, Mariah.  Everyone else is either going to have to just understand or not read.  I am thinking that the entry is so far down that no one will be interested enough to see this. Listen girls, I love you all.  On different levels.  But so deep on each of these levels.  Thank you all for handling me today the way you did.  Each one of you: (my blog flavorites) had an encounter or a few encounters with me where I just plain sucked.  However deep it was for you...I am thorry.  (said with the "th")  You know I am not this asshole for real...sometimes I just get crazy.  That you know.  All of you. So that's it.  I feel better right now.  It's the first time all day that I feel like shit isn't completely falling apart.  I will go to bed better. Rita is home and we are going on the stoop to have a smoke.  Maybe chill out for a lil' bit.   Thanks all.  You are the reason why I am here.

      Gosh.  The headache that I have right now can be easily summed up with one word...TENSION!  I don't know what happened today.  When I woke up I was in the best mood and in some ways felt as though I could conquer the world.   Then the day took over.  I spent a good hour intensely discussing some issues with Kelly.  Needless to say the conversation really didn't go all that well.  I do think we were both able to get some shit off our chest and I do think that we came to some sort of conclusion.  Things aren't finished yet, but for the time being they are.  (sigh of relief) As for Angie...uggles.  I am closing my eyes right now and making this all go away.  That is the end of that. As for the money problems, I close my eyes to you too! Just took some Excedrin.  Thank the Lord for Excedrin.   After getting off the phone with Kelly, Paul and Mariah called me and somehow knew that I just needed to hear their voices.  It was refreshing and actually, at one point, almost made me cry.  Just too much all at once, I guess.  Paul is so incredibly wonderful to me.  I have opened up to him so much more in the past couple of months....(since our re-gettogether).  He has listened to me scream, yell, cry, bitch, die inside and he has taken most of it with grace and style.  Of course he drives me up the wall, cuz who don't these days?  But on the majority of issues, he has been damn near perfect.  Sometimes I wish I could just really explain how much he means to me.  It is so hard.  I say "I love you" and "Thank you" and all the polite things that go along with being a boyfriend.  But a lot of times I feel like it doesn't express how deeply he has affected me.   I think that he and I have moved to the next level in our relationship.  I am having little desire to go out and meet someone new.  I very rarely am worried about the definition of our relationship and I find myself with that "missing him" pit in my stomach just about every day.  It's not the pit that keeps one in bed, but a pit that is a constant nagging irritation that makes me want to always have him by my side.  Is it possible that Paul is my ONE?  Anything is possible.  For right now, he is definitely my one.  He allows me freedom, choice, independence, and in a lot of ways provides me with a happiness that I can't get anywhere else.  Thank you Paul.  You are a good boy and if I ever figure out a way to show you how truly special you are to me, I will. Mariah, you ain't bad either! In about 10 minutes I get to go home and decompress.  Maybe drink a glass of wine and settle in for a good movie.  Just something quiet/something peaceful.   In my most irresponsible way, I am going to let all of today go.  I am done.   No more frustration.  Only patience.   No more anger.  Just kindness.   And if anything goes in a direction that I don't want to go in...I will just calmly and respectfully turn my back and walk away.  It is the way it has to be for me right now.  It is selfish and it is probably not the "right" thing to do.  But it is my life and this is the only way I see fit.  If anyone feels hurt or disappointed in me for this...please understand that it is not you.  It's not personal and it's not your fault.   "Everybody needs a little time away..." as Chicago so beautifully sang.

      So, it's been awhile huh?  That is an understatement when I stop to respond to all of the nasty emails I got from you people's.  Look, I was just taking some time off!  (WINKLES!)  If I haven't written back to you yet, hold up, I will.   Gosh, there is so much to cover, I don't know where to start.  I guess I should begin with venting...since right now I feel like I am going to rip someone's face off.  You know?  I just hate having my feathers ruffled so early in the morning.  But it does happen and then I get all crazy inside like I wanna kill someone.   There were a total of 3 things that drove me up the fucking wall this morning... I will explain one of them. Kelly has this ex-girlfriend named Angie.  Now, Angie and I have been friends for a VERY long time.  Years...but after she and Kelly broke up, things got a little more complicated.  It was and still is very hard to find the balance to our friendship.  Now, to make things even that much more complicated...she lives with this horrible shit of a guy that I just don't get along with.  So, to make a very long story very short...she and I are trying to figure out how to see eachother and hang out while avoiding any of the drama that goes on in our house.  She lives upstairs, I live downstairs.  Now, the point at which I got driven up the wall was when I came in this morning and AGAIN I got a somewhat nasty email from Angie explaining that it is basically my duty to visit her in her apartment regardless of my feelings about her roommate.  I tried to be polite in my last reply to her, saying that I didn't feel comfortable in her place and that she really should just try to make an effort to come down to our apartment.  She didn't like this idea so much.  So, I had to write her AGAIN today and somehow try to squash the pure annoyance that is coursing through my veins.  I just don't think she understands...I just plain refuse to be in the same place as him.  He is not allowed in my apartment and I don't think that it is appropriate for me to be in his.  End of story.  If Kelly or Rita wanted this fuck to come down to our place for any reason, then they would be more than fair in making this request.  But I just can't do it and I won't be around if he is.  So my dilemma is...how do I get this point across to her without her being made to feel responsible.  I don't know.   That was the first thing.... After that, the day just seemed to tumble downward into a nasty spiral...work blows, I have no money this week, I have a lot of shit to do, and I miss Paul terribly.   The last few weeks were really pretty great.  Lots of days off.  Lots of time for sleep and movies and food.  I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  The highlight of it all had to be the trip to Boston and the visit with Paul over Easter.  He was so generous and sweet.  As he has been for a good long while.  The only problem with it is that I miss him more now than I have in the last couple of months.  I also know that I am not going to have a weekend to go to Boston until the end of April and that kind of gets me down.  Just got to push forward until that....maybe he can come soon? Overall, I have been in great spirits these days.  I feel very independent and strong.  I have been taking good care of myself, getting a little exercise, not masturbating too much, etc.  I have been doing some writing of my own and it feels good just to get it out on paper.  I am trying to work through a couple minor issues I got goin and doing some private journaling is helping me figure it all out.  Hey, it's what it is there for, right? GOD!  IF DORIS THE FUCK DON'T SHUT UP TODAY, I am going to KILL HER! What else? Kelly is almost done with her cigarette smoking habit.  Wednesday is her first day of fresh lungs and good smelling clothes.  Rita and I, being the lovely housemates we are, are assisting in converting our apartment to inhabit only non-smokers.  Well, at least the common living space.  Fuck if I don't get to smoke in my own room.  It will be kind of funny, actually.  I picture two things: 1)  Every time I open my bedroom door, a cloud of smoke will follow me out of my room, somewhat in the style of pigpen from Charlie Brown.  I will reek of smoke while everyone else smells pwetty.  My breath will be stank and my fingers will be yellow.  I suppose I have always had these attributes, but now that our house will be spring fresh, it will be just a little more obvious that I am a smoker. 2)  It will be funny that if we do decide to drink in the house or to eat dinner or watch a movie (pretty much every activity that involves remaining in the room other than my bedroom), I am going to have to get up every half hour or so to go to my dinge hole and smoke a butt.  LOL.  I mean really.  I am going to get more exercise smoking now then I ever have before.  I guess that's the ropes.  Plus, Rita doesn't smoke in her room.  So will she be going outside to smoke every cigarette?  She can come in my room and have a butt once in awhile.  But surely not every smoke.  That would make my room just filthy!   So this is going to be a trip.  I am real excited for Kelly.  I have nothing but love and support for her endeavor.  It is true that quitting smoking really starts to get hard once you have done it for awhile.  But I do have faith in her to keep it up.  And if she just so happens to pick up the habit again, I will be ready to start puffing in that living room like nothing ever changed.   If you haven't, see the movie "Joyride".  Rita and I watched it last week and it was excellent.  There are so many suspense movies out there and are just not worth it.  This one is.  Find the time. Also, if you are bored, please feel free to perform this little experiment:  This is a toll-free call to Cigna... Dial 1-800-564-8982 Press 2 Press 5228 I laughed.  You will laugh.  Your mom will laugh.  If not, she don't know what funny is. I just found a pimple forming on my forehead.  Great.  Perfect way for the day to continue. So, I have this admirer...if you check my guestbook, you will see the entry.  I think I know who it is, but I definitely could be wrong.  I have been emailing some of my readers and a couple of you have said that you didn't write it.  I still have one possible shot at figuring out who this sketch ball is....if it ain't you...I am going to be real excited.  Cuz maybe it's an agent asking to promote me.  But just in a very creative way.   Tomorrow is a new episode of "The Real World".  Like I have been saying, if you haven't tuned in yet, be sure to catch an all Real World marathon.  MTV plays it just about every weekend and you will love.  The people are great.  There is only one I hate on the whole show.  His name would be Chris the fag.  He is a piece of shit.  Don't listen to a word he says and if he tries to tell you that you are "shameful" or "wrong in the way you want to live your life".  Tell him to fuck off and offer him a drink.  He thinks he's a recovering alcoholic.  But really, he's just gay. I split my lip the other day and every time I smile it re-splits.  Picture me with blood running down my chin at this very moment.  It looks kind of goth and hot.   Yesterday was a good day.  I got sufficient sleep, watched a movie in bed, relaxed for a bit and then crawled out of my room at like 4pm.  I haven't had one of those days in awhile.  Even on days off I am usually awake by noon the latest.  No matter what time I went to bed the night before.  After getting up, I cleaned the bathroom, cleaned my body, sang for a bit, and ate a wonderful meal prepared by one Miss Rita.  The biscuits were just about the best thing that has past through my mouth since the holidays.  I ate 5, I think.  Then after that, off to my room to do some more writing and tv watching.  It was so good.  I felt so rejuvenated this morning and then of course!  Shit hole job makes everything fall apart in a matter of minutes.  Fucking shit hole job. curse you. Tonight, I am planning on making a nice dinner, doing a little more writing, working on a monologue, and hopefully being in bed before it's too late.  I went to sleep much after 2:30am.  So maybe this evening I will try to get a sensible night's rest.   Okay, I have so much more to say, but it is going to have to wait a bit.  I have so much shit to catch up on. Jigga...what's my motha fuckin name? Jigga.

      HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO IAN! But I haven't given him access to this page, so he will never know I said that. Only 27 minutes until another mini-break.  I fucking LOVE this place.  I will make sure to write over the next couple of days.  I am just too busy to get anything out right now. Tonight is BEIGE!  Rock out.  Good looking boys, fun atmosphere, and I will be there with some friends.  As Gilbert and Sullivan wrote: "Who could ask for anything more?"

      Did you know that my dick is actually only 2 inches big?  I have never wanted to tell anyone about it, cuz I am pretty embarassed.  Paul has always kept my secret.  So has my ex-something or other Brandon Jay.  But here is the truth....it is tiny!

      Just want to say one more thing: Paul told me over and over this week how much he "truly loves me".  He very rarely said it first in the past.  And now he is saying it all the time.  I can see it in his eyes, feel it in his touch.  He gives me everything I could ever ask for and more.   You know, I hate those people that gush and gush about their boyfriend.  Especially when I went through my period of not having one.  But it is so hard not to gush when after 2 years and some odd months, we can just fall deeper and deeper in love.  He is the one person that I really never get sick of.  He makes me laugh.  He makes me feel special.  He makes me feel smart, important, and safe.  I could never have asked for someone better than him.   It's such a pure and innocent love.  And because of all this, it is so difficult NOT to gush.   Rita said to me something that stuck in my head.  It was this: "I think you are 'it' for Paul.  I think that, given the right circumstances, he could commit to you forever."   At first, I was shocked by this.  But the more I thought about it, the truth I see in it.  Could he really want to settle down with me?  I could NEVER do such a thing.  Not that it wouldn't work, but because I am way too selfish still to even ponder the idea.  It just got me thinking...I am 25.  My parents had me when they were 26.  So...is this the time when I should be starting to think of these things?  When all of my friends are thinking of marriage and babies...is it crazy for me NOT to be thinking of these things?  Gosh.  I want to be 21 forever.  Or even 22 or 23.  At 24, things start to get too serious and real for my liking.   Oof dah!

      What an amazing five days it has been!  I can't believe that it is over already and that I am sitting here at my desk again.  I think the only thing getting me through at this point is the fact that I am off from work tomorrow at 1pm - not to come back until 10am on Friday.  I just love being Jewish. The visit to Boston was incredible.  Rita and I got in around 5:30pm on Wed. and we picked up Paul at the grocery store.  That evening, we had a HUGE dinner of filet mignon and Salmon (that Paul prepared so amazingly!) and then boozed and boozed until we finally made it out at around 12am.  We danced and drank for about 37 minutes.  Paul was showing signs of massive wastedness and I ripped us out of the bar at around 1:15am.  He was out of his mind.  When we got home, we hung out for a bit and then Paul proved how out of control he was by pulling down his pants and baring cock and balls for the entire apartment.  Looking back on it, I have to laugh.  But at the time, I was mortified.  Is this MY boyfriend acting like this?  Goodness.  Everyone was cool with it, so I became cool with it.  Yikers. Thursday, Mariah left for Colorado and Paul made Rita and I a HUGE feast that we took outside and ate in this little park.  I mean HUGE feast.  We had steamed broccoli and shrimp and steak sandwiches and brie melts and oh my god I almost exploded.  It was adorable; us sitting on this patch of lawn with about 300 pounds of food in front of us.  While everyone else was playing soccer, I was asking Rita to pass the steamer full of vegetables.  Unbelievable. Rita and I walked around Newbury for a bit and then went home for a brief nap.  We were supposed to be at TGIFriday's by 10pm or so to see Paul.  BUT...little nap became long nap and we decided to just crash on the couch for shits and giggles.  Paul got home around 2:30am and we just went to bed. On friday, the three of us loaded into the car and high tailed it back to NYC.  It was a quick drive and I think Paul and I only argued for about half of it.  (winkles!)  At one point, he was criticizing my driving so bad that all I remember saying over and over was: "Why don't you shut the fuck up?" and "Maybe at this point you will want to shut the fuck up."  It was great!  (snicker snicker) Paul and I made some dinner when we got in and then took a nap.  Damn...the whole week was like naps and food, naps and food.  The way I like it!  That night, he and I went out to three different places.  We started at Barrage, then moved on to Heaven, and ended up at Urge.  I had never been to Heaven or Urge before, so that was cool.  We drank and laughed and had so much fun.  It was good being out with just him.  Usually we don't do well in these type of situations, and there were moments when I wanted to punch his face, but all in all, it worked out just great.  We came home and stayed up until 6am smokin joints and laughing our asses off.  Paul and I did a GREAT DEAL of laughing this week.  It was the best part.  He has just recently started this new laugh.  It is quite infectious and possibly the loudest thing I have ever heard.  But I love it.  And it makes me feel so good when I am the one to cause the laugh.   Saturday, Paul and I went to a steak house for dinner and then got ice cream cones and went down to the water to eat them.  It was a beautiful night and we just sat and talked for a bit.  It was pretty romantic and nice until Paul told me that he felt like a "gay pervert" for sitting around these kids.  So, that pretty much ended that experience.  He was asleep by 9:30pm.  I fell asleep shortly after midnight and we stayed that way until noon the next day. Totally missing church.  I hated myself for that.  It was the one thing I wanted to do.  But we didn't. Sunday afternoon, Rita, Paul and I went out for drinks and played some cards at the Duplex.  We went to this place called "Cajun" in Chelsea first.  Never been there before, but it was cute.  Duplex actually rocked.  How did that happen?  We were home by 8:30pm and wasted.  It's a good feeling when you don't go to church on Easter Sunday, but you get as drunk as you possibly can.  Jesus was very proud of me.   This morning Paul left to go back to Boston.    It was like having my heart ripped out of my chest and handed to me.  I could barely sleep all night and I was wound so tight this morning.  Why can't he just move here already?  I know it could work and I am doing everything in my power to get his ass here.  I just really need him for more than like 48 hours at a time.  I am so tired of this hello and goodbye bullshit.  Is it ever going to change? He and I are so good for eachother.  I was thrilled that Rita was able to see Paul and I in a different setting.  She said some pretty great things about him and I felt as though she got to know him and Mariah so much better.  He and I are like the perfect balance.  And separating from eachother is incredibly difficult.  If I can get him here, I will.  I just got to. So that is the update of everything I did over the last five days.  Obviously there is so much more, but I can't get it all straightened out in my head yet.   In other news...Kelly has found not only one, but TWO jobs!  UM!  I am so happy and impressed.  She buckled down and took care of it.  Good girl.  And the place seems really great.  If you would like to see the restaurant that she will be bartending at, go here:  urlLink Kelly's new job  She starts training tonight, so fingers crossed my friends!  I hope she likes it and that she can start making some bones real soon.   I guess that is it for now.  Can't wait to get back into the swing of things.  It will feel right to be here without Paul once I am reminded of the life I have here.  It is so easy to forget sometimes.

      HEADSHOTS TODAY AT 3:30pm. YIKES! and YAY! So busy lately...have had ZERO time to write.  I will put an entry in here over the weekend.  I know you all must be chomping at the bits to hear about my bullshit life. Quick samples: Paul is amazing Mariah is AMAZING I had an incredible time last night moving her in.  Long story and will explain later.  Paul and I had the most beautiful, most intimate 15 minute hook up in our whole relationship.  I came so quick and it was so wonderful.   I am very excited to go out partying with them tonight and to be with Paul before he goes back tomorrow morning.   I left my house yesterday at 7pm and probably won't be back until Saturday or Sunday.  That's nice for a change.  Usually I am cooped up inside my jail cell of a bedroom.  By my own volition of course. HEADSHOTS TODAY!  FUCKING HEADSHOTS! My face will look like this:   >:-D Have a great weekend y'all!

       urlLink      urlLink What's Your Sexual MO?  Find out @  urlLink She's Crafty    You love to be pampered and romanced by your men and things like cuddling by a fire, having an intimate meal, or having a long, deep conversation can always put you in the mood. Sex to you is usually more about the man your with than the act itself. Not a one-night stand kind of girl, newness and disconnectedness just don't do it for you. The mature, stable men you prefer to date appreciate your loyalty and big heart, but they especially love the way you inspire their more aggressive, protective masculine side.

       TODAY IS THE DAY WHEN MARIAH MOVES TO NYC!    Holy shit!  I can't believe it.  The time flies when you are sitting on your ass doing nothing.  She is very nervous, a little excited, and I think, in alot of ways, dreading today.  It is so hard to move, especially out of a place as beautiful and fun as Boston.  But she will do it with flying colors.  I know it. Paul is driving the U-Haul down today.  They should be in Brooklyn by 7pm.  Amazing!  I have been saying that I am not going to go down and see her tonight, but I have to.  When I woke up this morning, all I thought was...YAYAY...she is coming today!   With Mariah moving into town, I get some more friends!  Finally.  It won't just be my housemates, Penelope, and Ian anymore.  It will be my housemates, Penelope, Ian, Mariah, and RACHEL!  Whom I absolutely adore with my whole soul.  I just never get to see her.   Can you tell I am excited? for friends and for a change of pace. Haven't really talked to Paul in the last couple of days.  He has been pretty busy with work, packing up the house, looking for a roommate, etc.  He thinks he may have found a roommate actually.  From what Paul tells me, his new roommate is a tall, attractive, medical student, gay man.  Hmmm..... Right. Anyway...that's exactly what I DIDN'T want him to do, but you can never count on Paul to be sympathetic to anyone's needs, but his own. SO! I am looking forward to seeing his annoying ass though.  He has been the most fucking irritating boyfriend lately, but whatever... I can't wait to look at the hole in his back again. (picture me holding the vomit in my mouth at this point) What else... Work has been annoying this week too.  It's weird.  When we have short weeks, each day is like a psycho fest.  I don't understand it.  Oh well.  At least Friday is tomorrow. AND...we are going to a staff lunch today at 1:30pm and we don't gots to come back to this shit hole!  So...YES! I got a lot of sleep last night.  Never happens.  I slept hard too.  When my alarm went off this morning, I felt like I was pulling out of the coma of a lifetime.  I did feel refreshed though and maybe the dark circles under my eyes will be slightly less dark for my headshot appointment tomorrow. I am nervous about getting my pictures taken.  I am not good with smiling on command.  And I get all nervous about making hot sexy faces.  Usually when I make any sort of hot/sexy face, the picture comes out with me looking like I have rubber face.  RUBBER FACE . Did you ever see that movie? I am sure you didn't.  BUT!  IF you have...tell me who the lead character is and you will win a surprise. Edward comes next week.  Is it wrong for me to be as excited as I am? I hope he looks hot. ;) Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo....this week Kelly has graduated, Rita has had medical problems starting with her back and ending with her jaundiced eyes and I have had the sinus plugger from hell.  What is the deal with our house?  SO much going on.   I gotta piss....

      My gosh the weekend is almost over!  Never does it seem like too long! In fact, if I didn't have the day off tomorrow, I would sit here and seriously consider the time warp I had gone through and wonder why it was fucking Sunday at 7:23pm. Pretty bored here.  My girls are both gone...............but still!  Who would have thought that all this alone time would be a bad thing??  It hasn't been entirely bad.  In fact, it has been quite good.  I am just ready for it to come to a close.   I spent the day yesterday, laying on my ass.  I didn't even smoke pot really.  A bowl here and there, but mostly I just puttered.  I made a new recipe for dinner.  It is called "Sour Cream Chicken".   My dad brought me this list of recipes during his last visit.  I decided to break it out yesterday and give it a try.  I made the chicken and this homemade recipe of  rice that my mom used to make.  The chicken was EXCELLENT.  The rice...well...you see, about the rice.... It resides in the garbage can.  I am not sure what I did wrong, but whatever it was...OOF!  Honestly, I think I just used bad rice.  The taste wasn't bad, but no matter what I did...the rice was hard and chalky.  And if you have ever had chalky rice...you understand what a HORRIBLE texture of filth you get when you crunch down on each bite.  YOWZAHS!   Tossed that shit immediately. The chicken was a little dry, but that was only because I let it cook too long.   (I was trying desperately to save my rice at that point) But it was good.   Here is the recipe if you feel like giving it a try: SOUR CREAM CHICKEN (exactly what is sounds like) 1)  Any amount of chicken will do...no matter...I prefer boneless...you should too 2)  Coat skinless chicken breast with a thick layer of sour cream (I use fat free...so should you) 3)  Coat thoroughly in bread crumbs 4)  Place on a baking sheet and cover with aluminum foil 5)  Cook in the oven on bake or whatever on 350-400 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes 6)  After 30 minutes, remove the foil so that the chicken can fully brown.  Keep an eye on it from this point. 7)  OH MAN YUM! ***If your chicken turns out a little dry, add another layer of sour cream after it is finished and ROCK!  Tasty! So easy and it brightens up an otherwise boring slab of chicken.  And that is what I did for all of yesterday.  Well, I did have to go to the store to get the ingredients, so I DID in fact get OUT of the house.  I also made cookies.  Chocolate chip and they turned out so bomb that I have already eaten 8. Good thing I bought the FAMILY PACK, otherwise there would be nothing left.  :-D Today I cleaned the house, memorized a song for Rita, and masturbated twice.  Now I sit and wait for someone to come home.   Tomorrow I just HAVE to work on my room.  How could I sit home for 2 full days and not touch it? Easily...it's called LA-motha fucking-ZY! If I didn't have Rita and Kelly coming home to look forward to, my boredness would make me clean my room. So thanks alot Rita and Kelly...you are the reason my room sucks.  You're really great friends. I read Penelope's blogger today.  It was so wonderful!   This is just for Penelope: Saying that I possess "grace" was just about the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me.  I beamed from ear to ear after having read your blogger.  I had so much fun with you on Friday, always do.  I didn't even want to leave!  Remember when I kept being like "should I leave...", well thank G-D you said "no".  Cuz I wanted to stay!  Thank you for the pot, the jokes, the talks...I loved being there and I WILL be back.  :-D Penelope's bother Ethan was there when I was there too...and he is just great!  I always have interesting talks with the two of them.  And he showed me how to do a few more things with this blogger.  You the best brotha man.   Tonight is HBO'S documentary of 9/11, hosted or something, by Mayor Giulianni.  I will not be watching it.  I feel good today and want to not feel bad.  It will be on again on Tuesday night...I will see if I can tape it then.  Supposedly you can actually see people jumping out of buildings.  Not my kind of fun on a Sunday night before a day off from work...I would watch it if i didn't want to play so badly when the girls come home.  (I am not even going to tell them it is on until after it is over....snicker snicker) I guess that is it.  Edward was supposed to call me this weekend and of course he didn't.  But I didn't call him either...hahahaha.  The story of our lives.  I gotta call this kid.  He is going to be here in less than 2 weeks.  ROCK.  In other news...Paul has called 3 times this weekend and I haven't returned any of his calls.   NOW who is the asshole?  oh yeah....me.  :( Hope everyone is having an incredible MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND!

      Here I sit.  It is 10:57pm and I just recently got home from Penelope's.  Man.  I drank a GOOD amount.  I am fucked up right now.  I said earlier today that I was going to get FUCKED UP and I did.  I am seriously drunk.  The only reason why any of this is coming across in a coherent manner is because I back track every two seconds and fix the spelling.  (No matter how drunk i get I will be the queen of spelling) I had such an awesome time today.  I went over to Penelope's on the cross town bus after saying goodbye to Rita at 96th street.  She is off for a weekend of intensity.  And I miss her.  Already. Kelly is working all night so I got home to an empty house.  Sometimes that is great.  tonight it is shit.  I am fucked up and need someone to play with.   Paul had called so I returned his call, but of course he doesn't answer.   Now I sit here...on the verge of wanting to drink more to keep the momentum going, or to vomit and call it a night.  Tough call.  it's still pretty early. In other news.... I had a great time tonight.  Penelope and I did the TAROT.  My first readings with her.  In fact, we didn't focus much on the cards themselves at all, but had introspecitve and beautiful conversations ourselves.  That is what the TAROT is all about afterall.  I do the TAROT.  Am I serious?  consider me the devil.   But we had an amazing time.  I was so relaxed.  her brother was there as well as her roommate.  (stinky roommate).  Some laughs, some personal moments, some wine, and a great time for the two of us.  I love hanging with her.  She is wise.  I listened to her alot tonight  and I honestly learned alot.  there is a wisdom that comes with age and life experience.  penelope has definitely earned this.  Right now the Indigo Girls is on.  I am a lesbo. (moment when I thought I was going to puke) oddly enough it correlates with the indigos.... Okay...for the next couple of minutes, everything I write will be free verse and not corrected for spelling, logic, or grammar.... HERE GOES----------- (stop to take a sip of my wine)  (who am i kidding>?) right now the barenaked ladies are playing.  it is the song calle dintermint=ently.  i am sorot of bored by the whole thing...but I want to type to see how foten i fouck up.  wow.  sdo you see the problem?  do imagien how long it took me type the above and having to correct thw ehoel time.  wow.  iam a fucking mess.

      30 minutes until MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND! I remember when I was younger, this weekend used to be a huge family weekend for picnics, outings, etc.   Now that I am older, it is really only a weekend for getting fucked up and sleeping.  My how priorities seem to change. Paul just called me at work.  It was a very base conversation.  I couldn't open up to him at all.  I couldn't get past this week.   He was fine on the phone.  He was joking around with me and being kind of sarcastic.  But to be honest, I definitely wasn't in the mood for HIS sarcasm or humor.  Everyone else is fine.  But his just grates on me today.  I miss him and I still feel weird about this week with him.  I got off the phone as quickly as I could. He did seem upset that I wanted to get off the phone.   At least he feels something. Today after work I am going to get pizza with Rizza and then off to Penelope's where I plan to get as fucked up as possible.   It is Friday night afterall.  Time to do it up.  I haven't been over to her house in a couple of weeks.  It has just been so hectic.   Rita is leaving for Corning.  Kelly has to work most of the weekend.   It will be a blissful time of sleeping, eating, cleaning my room, watching movies, sleeping, eating, masturbating, playing on the computer, eating again. Edward is supposed to call too.  Fun. Maybe going out for drinks tomorrow and Sunday too.  Yikes.   My body screams stop...but my need for illusion screams GO.

      I just wanted to say one more thing.  Although I didn't talk to Paul again today, this is the conversation we had over his cell phone and my email account: Paul:  "I love you and am terrified to call.  You sounded so upset and sad last night." Joe:  "Big breakdown last night.  Sorry for scaring you.  It wasnt ur fault.  Just wanted to hear ur voice." {{Major delay in text exchange}} Paul:  "Do you want to hear my voice?" (I melt in my seat) Joe:  "You are the love of my life" Paul:  "Ohhhh" And that's it.  When I told Rita the story earlier, I left out the part where I say "You are the love of my life", cuz I am so embarrassed that I said that.  And this is (quickly) why... After this wonderful little text exchange, Paul still didn't call me.  My hysterical tears didn't make him call me last night and it didn't make him call me today.  Even though I was really cool with him during the messages.  REALLY COOL. When he said to me..."Do you want to hear my voice?", I almost started to cry.  (Now YES I am emotional today, but it was just...just...so perfect) He is so damn ignorant, but when he pulls out the big guns and goes for my heart, I surrender every time.  He is the only person in my life that makes it impossible for me to hold a grudge.  He definitely has the key to my heart.   He doesn't even recognize that it is in his hand.  But it is.  I want him.  I want only him.   Today. I am so confused by love.  And even more so... I am so confused by my love for Paul.   But as long as he holds this key...I am his.   I can't imagine asking for the key back.

      I am sitting here listening to Blu Cantrell sing about "Hittin em up style".  What a fly bitch.  Wish she was more than that "one hit wonder".   Rita is packing up to leave town tomorrow.  Kelly is at the last class of her life.  Oh man.  What a week.   My mom just called me and told me something that totally slipped my mind.  I am a self-absorbed asshole.   She runs this 3 mile (i think 3 mile...yikes) marathon every year through work.  It is called "The Corporate Challenge".  There are thousands of runners and it consists of members from the "corporate" world.  Kelly knows ALL about this.  Her father runs it too.  She accompanied me one year.   So my mom called and told me that she ran this marathon in 43 minutes.  I mean...thats amazing.  Her first year doing it she ran the same distance in 48 minutes.  This is like her 5th or 6th year doing this.  And she has improved!  Uh...WHAT?  I am so unbelievably proud of her.  Oh man...so proud!  She even passed and left in the dust two 24 year olds from her office.  ROCK!  That's MY mother. And the fact that she picked up the phone the minute she walked into the house and called me!  She loves me!!!  I know this, but it just feels so good.  Especially with my mother.   I walk around every day with a pit in my stomach thinking that she is just going to randomly die.  Don't ask me why...it is crazy.  But after my grandmother died...I kind of never got over it and now I fear so desperately that my mother will die of lung cancer the way my gramma did.  It's on my mind all the time.  It's  a problem, I know.   So knowing that my mother did so well on this run and that she called me while smoking a cigarette (ugh) just made me feel good.  Cuz she feels healthy.  And she is happy.  And she breaks my heart cuz I just love her so much.  That's why I am quitting smoking.  For my mother.  She will quit if I quit.  And if not...then I definitely have the right to be like "Mom, enoughs enough."   I wish life were forever and I wish that I could spend every moment near my family.  They are everything to me.   Always will be. It always takes me like 30 minutes to get over a phone call from my mother.  It just breaks me right out of my fantasy world and forces me to face reality.  I think I spend most of my days running away from reality.  That's why I don't call people, keep up friendships, get a second job, etc.  It's just so hard for me.  I want everything to be on a whatever basis.  That is selfish and shit.  But I don't know how to stay "happy" otherwise.  Quite the dilemma.   Ugh.  I feel so wrapped up in my head today.  After last night, I still feel so fucking weird inside.  I felt it all day.  Just weird. I feel like the "depression" that I deal with is quite physical.  It's not just a sad thing.  It's an anxious thing for me.  I get so uptight in my body.  It feels horrible.  And that is how I feel right now.  That is how I felt all day.  I can still go on with my day, and I can still laugh and have fun.  But it is such an intense feeling in the way that I could start crying at any point.  And if I start I don't think I will stop.   Last night stripped me of the wall that I had built up.  Now I feel vulnerable.  I feel vulnerable and made of glass.   I NEED this weekend to rebuild.   Build up that tougher skin and convince myself that I am strong enough to move forward.

      The day is almost over!   Not a horrible day today.  It went by a little faster than yesterday, but that is only because I had more work to do.  I think the highlight of the whole day was when I had grilled cheese and fries for lunch.  I just love it.  I think it could be my favorite meal on the planet.  The only thing that would have made it better would have been less grease and more pizza. :-() SNARF I am exhausted.  I definitely need to get some rest tonight.  But I also have to get a bag.  No, not a bag.  A FUCKING BAG! You get it now. My eyelids are what I like to call...heavy.  But my attitude is pretty good.  Rita said, last night after my breakdown, that today would be a "light day" for me.  And she was absolutely right.  I have no need for the super-absorbance pads.  I will stick with the lighter days.   Nothing could be as bad as last night was, so really I didn't have much worry.  The only thing that could have been harder to deal with would have been getting hit by a bus...and even that has its advantages.  (getting out of work you goons!) The guy that cut my hair today was the nicest man alive, but I think he gave me a shitty haircut.  What is with me and shitty haircuts lately?  After he finished...he spikes my hair to the ceiling and is like: "How is the length?"  I say: "The LENGTH is perfect."  He's like: "Great!", removes the plastic cover from my clothes and lowers my chair. "Um, aren't you going to style it at all...or are you just going to leave it sticking straight up?" Leave it sticking straight up obviously cuz my hair looks like it did in 8th grade.  So does my body.  I ate grilled cheese and fries today.  :( So glad the weekend is coming.  So motha fuckin glad. Alright...I gotta go pack up my shit and get ready to leave.  It is 4:42pm afterall!

      If someone picks you up at a bar and asks you for your phone number, what do you do? Well first, it ain't classy or safe to give out your number to a boy, so casually smile and accept his number, if you like him.   But more importantly, if you don't like him or he skeeves you in any way, give him the following number:  212-479-7990 It's the  urlLink REJECTION LINE  and it is the funniest thing I have ever heard.   After calling the line, press #2.  It's my favorite.

      Well helloooooooooo... Only been at work for 2 hours, but it definitely feels like the day should be over.  Boring job.  Boring boring boring boring boring boring boring boring boring boring...it actually is more fun to write the word "boring" than it is to actually do anything else.   Yesterday was the day of horrible things.  Besides the fact that I got into a fight with Paul, I went home and got into a huge fight with my father.  We were having a very simple catch-up type conversation, when he brought up my brother being in the ARMY.  He was like "You need to be the one to call him.  You need to be strong for him.  You need to have your interactions with him be on his terms, etc etc."  I don't know what possessed me, but I was like: "I know that I need to be better to Winfield, but it is hard.  I didn't ask for him to go into the ARMY.  HE made that decision.  HE put his life at risk.  HE HE HE HE HE..."   My dad goes, "If Winfield dies over there, you will beat yourself up for it.  And you will have a problem with yours and my relationship at that point".  I was like: "That is not right.  Winfield wanted to go to Wake Forest.  Winfield wanted to serve his country.  Winfield did this to himself!"  My dad goes:  "This conversation is over.  Love you." CLICK! And he hung up on me. I sat there shocked for about 10 minutes not even moving.  Just staring at the wall.  Then I called back my parents house only to find out that my dad had taken the phone off the hook.  I called and called and called, but to no avail.  Then I went out to talk to Rita and just LOST IT.  I mean, really lost it.  I was screaming and sobbing and fell into complete hysterics.  Even writing the words can't explain how intensely I lost it.  For ten minutes, I just SCREAMED and CRIED.  I was so angry at everything and was so sad and frustrated that I thought that I had gone off the deep end for good.  It was awful.  Rita was exactly what I needed.  She sat there next to me, hugging me, rubbing my back, not saying anything except "I'm sorry...I'm sorry".  She lit my cigarette for me and just kept rubbing my back, letting me go off for as long as I needed to.  She was an angel from God. Then I jumped up and decided to call my parents house again.  The phone was back on the hook and my mom answered it.  I continued to SOB and SOB.  I told her to tell my dad to go "Fuck himself" that he is "an asshole" that just pushed me over the emotional edge.  I screamed and sobbed to her for about an hour.  She totally calmed me down.  She said all the right things.  Nothing I said or did even seemed to phase her.  She was so patient and helpful.  And she took my side, which I needed.  She told me that my dad is in a really raw, emotional state right now.  That he is acting extremely irrational and jumping down everyone's throats whenever the topic of my brother is brought up.  He is scared to death and this fear is causing him to lose his mind.   That's a long story that I don't even want to get into.   My mom saved my life last night.  And so did Rita.  I felt so ALONE when my dad hung up on me.  Paul had just hung up on me 2 hours earlier and I started to think that I was losing everything.  That all of the headway that I have made was for nought.  :( By the end of the conversation, she actually had me laughing.  SHE IS EVERYTHING TO ME!  I got off the phone and went to talk to Rita who was curled up in her bed watching  Mermaids .  We talked for a couple minutes and she just hugged me and loved me.  And then I didn't feel quite as alone anymore.   Thank God. At one point during my numerous phone calls to my parents house (when the phone was off the hook), I called Paul just so that he could tell me everything was ok.  I didn't care about what happened earlier in the day anymore...I just wanted him to tell me that he loved me.  He had mentioned previously that he was going to be having dinner with Mariah and her bosses at 7pm.  I called at 8:30pm.  His phone rang, but he didn't pick it up.  I left him a long message telling him that I really needed to hear his voice, that something awful happened, and that I really just needed him.  I cried so hard on the phone message. It is now 11:30am the next day and he didn't even call me back. Enough said. Gosh.   Now I sit here with swollen eyes and a very slight headache.  Sobbing like that really takes a lot out of you.  And I feel a little weird today.  After an experience like that, it just kind of shakes one up.  I am very excited to go home and to just climb in bed for the weekend.  I need some rest.  I need some low-key fun.  Maybe watch a movie or two.  Maybe smoke a bowl, drink some wine, maybe go out for a bit.   Life is so chaotic and sometimes I just feel as though I am going to get lost in the cycle.

      Okay, back from my little tantrum.  Why does this kid provoke me in such a way?  He makes me so fucking angry sometimes.  It's like he doesn't know me at all.  If you see that I am quick on the phone with you, or that I am being kind of a dick, then maybe you stop for a minute, consider my actions over the last two and a half years, and understand that I am hurt by you.  Not angry.  Not out for revenge.  Just plain hurt. Paul hasn't called for just about a week.  (we are one day away from that)  I have called him.  I even sent him a fucking letter in the mail, which we NEVER do.  He never called to say thank you, he never called to see if I was alright, he never even called to talk about the vacation.  Last we spoke, I told him that we could talk about the trip during our next big conversation.  WELL...I guess now is that next big convo.  GOD!  He can be so vile sometimes.  The feelings that he causes in my heart are so unacceptable.  He makes me want to drop him on his ass.  And hard.  I am not saying that this is the mature way to deal with it or that I even want to do that at this point, but conversations like we just had prove to me that: a)  You ain't moving here, cuz even long distance you don't miss me enough to care. b)  You are a fucking moron that has just about NO social interaction comprehension. c)  You are a lot of fucking work and in a lot of ways, don't give me nearly enough good to compensate for it. Damn.  Damn damn damn.  Why do I ALWAYS give him the benefit of the doubt?  Why do I always develop that pit in my stomach that misses him so deeply??  Why?  WHY?  why?  :( God...I just love him so much and he just puts me through the ringer over and over and over and over... and I always come back for more and more and more and more... MAN. Love aint easy...and what's even harder is being in love with an idiot. I actually called him back after our fight, cuz I hate leaving things bad.  (even though I was the one that hung up on him---hee) So I call him back and I am like: "Do you want to talk for a couple of minutes?" He says: "Yes, but I am in the store.  I will call you when I get out." It has been about 45 minutes since that call and no sign of him.  DICK!  I don't take 4 hour lunches! Fine.  If he doesn't call me than sobeit. He can deal with Mariah moving out on his own.  He can deal with his surgery pain on his own.  He can deal with his sadsap lonliness on his own.  And you know what....keep this up Paul...and you can drive all the way here in your fucking UHAUL next week and you can call me and call me....but I won't show up at Mariah's until you are gone.   Hurt me again fucker.  Hurt me and then deal with the fact that you just keep pushing me away. :(

      So when I just spoke with Paul (first time in a week), I explained to him that my feelings are hurt.  That I understand that he is suffering with having Mariah move, and blah fucking blah.  He was so irate and such a fucking asshole that eventually I screamed in his face, told him to send the fucking money to my mother for our fucking vacation and to not fucking call me until he takes some fucking time to analyze his horrible way of showing love to me.   FUCKING FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK! He makes me so angry and upset!   You know what???  Rita just told me that there are skeletal remains found in Washington Park and we keep hearing military planes overhead.   Even if it is all media hype, it is STILL more important than sitting here bitching about my piece of shit boyfriend. GO FUCK YOURSELF PAUL.  You ungrateful shit. fucking so ungrateful.

      Want to know something interesting, shocking, and potentially horrifying? Eminem and Britney Murphy are in a new movie together.  No, that's not the horrifying part.   The horrifying part is: October 13, 2001 - The Sun reports Eminem and his onscreen lover Brittany Murphy have been flirting outrageously on the set of his new movie. Britney plays the role of Kim and an insider is saying of the two, "They have been having very intimate conversations. It looked like they were working on more than just their lines."  Oh Lord.  Another one bites the dust.

      Good morning.   Here is my Real World opinionated re-cap of last night's episode. As we see, Kyle is a fake shithead.  You know, it really just chaps my ass.  I started this season with such an open mind to Kyle and Kerri's plight.  I thought that their issues were real, genuine, and difficult to navigate.  However, after viewing each episode as least 7 times, I have come to the conclusion that Kyle is the worst "character" on the show.  And I say "character" because he is in no way, shape, or form, a real little boy.  If anything, he is Pinocchio BEFORE the fairy granted his wish. He has led Kerri on and on and on.... As we found out in last night's episode, Kyle has been sneaking into Kerri's bed at night for some kissing and humping (we did see clips of this in past episodes), and he has also written her "over 30 love letters telling her how much he truly loves (me)" her.  What a snake he is.  I mean really.  Is it just me, or is Kerri totally deserving of a REAL man?  The girl is so much fun, so beautiful, and most importantly, so damn cool. She tries desperately to convince herself that she doesn't have feelings for this asshole, but we all know how that goes.  It takes time.   Last night Kyle did three things that made me gasp with horror. 1)  Invites Kerri along to a party only to backstab her all night to his friends and other housemates. 2)  Convinces everyone and himself that Kerri annoys him, follows him everywhere, and never gives him room to breathe, only to then be all over her the minute that she meets a guy other than him. 3)  Receives a phone call message from his ex-"girlfriend" Nicole during a candlelight vigil in NYC (right after 9/11) and doesn't shed one tear.  Now, the reason #3 bothers me is because when I saw the clip of Nicole's answering message, it took about 4 seconds for me to collapse into tears.  That 2 minute clip produced more tears on my face than the whole September 11th episode did in its' entirety.  Kyle, who goes ON and ON about how worried he is for Nicole and how much his love for her knows no bounds - in fact, at one point I specifically remember him saying that he and Nicole have "Storybook Love" - doesn't do anything more than put on a sad face and wistfully look at the wall.  For real?  Damn.  Wish I could love someone with such ease. I don't believe him for a minute.  And I am disappointed.  He seemed so cool and now I have no respect.  And suddenly, because personality does win out over looks afterall, he has become the most hideous monster on the show.  I think his face is made of plastic, and as Rita has previously said, his legs are definitely tree trunks. He is skeeve. Watching him make out with Kerri, shirtless with his mesh shorts riding up his ass, then getting up and walking away as if he just committed the same act with a goat, makes me furious inside. I truly hope that she watches these episodes and just laughs and laughs.  She is better off without him.   He is a sad little man.

       CONGRATULATIONS to KELLY on her LAST DAY OF EXAMS!    YOWZAH!  That's a girl!  Way to go!  YOU DA BEST!  (and every other annoying cliche in the bunch) Almost time to go home.  PHEW!  This day is what I like to call Dragging McDragersons.  Really.  The whole day has creeped by in the most snail like manner.   But today was also a bit interesting.  It started with Pedro the security guard telling Angela the housekeeper to "Fuck off".  Then Angela came upstairs SOBBING and screaming about it.  It was absolute chaos for about 15 minutes.  And this all happened at about 10am.  Ugh.  Pedro fucking sucked for what he said to Angela today.  I have never met such a beautiful woman in my whole life.  She don't hurt anything.  She is the kind of lady that cares so much about life that she would find a nest of flies festering on the 6th floor of my building and would immediately pick it up in her hands and find it a home in the local park.  She just cares that much! Thnor. She was so upset and it made me love her even more.  She deserves the world.   (as long as this bitch gets a slice) When I went to the bathroom earlier, my ass had a virgin suicide.   Just thought I would let everyone know that.  I know how worried you all get.  You need to know my ass action every day or else you worry that I have become a healthy little boy like all the others.   ***nother side note*** Paul hasn't called ONCE since last Thursday night.  (big sigh) It's funny.  Every time I happen to mention this fact to anyone, they always look at me oddly and go "But why?".   Then I look back at them and go "I know". It just sucks, you know?  How else can I explain it? Last Thursday night we had a 2 hour talk on the phone that was amazing!  He was like in love and obsessed with me.  It felt strange to have him telling me how much he loved me and having him obsess over everything that I am doing.  He was crazy.  But crazy with love.   Then, as usual, he doesn't call for like a week because he has showed too much emotion to me and must pull back. You know what I think about that?  I think that it is a fucking childish and tired excuse.  Grow up asshole. Sorry...just gotta vent sometimes. He's fine.  Just so typical and boring. In other news...Kelly and I had a wonderful talk last night.  We had some drinks, some laughs, some cries, and an overall good time.  I think we cleared the air on alot of things.  Not that things were bad, per se.  Just some things that needed to be clarified. And I think it went very well.   Well, I guess that is it.  Pretty much a nothing of a day today.   Lucky me gets to go home and work on remodeling my annoying bedroom.  Can't it just be done already?? No Joe, it can't.  You are the laziest mother fucker in America.  Just go home, shut up, and do it. I know.   I know. One last thing...Edward sent me this poem this morning.  I actually laughed out loud.  (LOL)(I am a 16 year old girl)(LOL) Here it is:   This is Just to Say  I have eaten  the plums that were in the icebox  and which  you were probably saving for breakfast  Forgive me they were delicious so sweet and so cold   HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! um.

      I have some sort of a head cold today.  I don't know if it is allergies or change in weather or if I am really getting sick.  But in any case it sucks.  My nose is plugged, my throat is scratchy, and I feel tired.  Maybe it's mono. Maybe not.   Who could be so lucky?

      So folks...in an unbelievable upset, the REAL WORLD beat the ROAD RULES in the final challenge.  YAYAYAY!  Real World better always kick Road Rules' ass!  It was quite a riveting episode.  If you get a chance to catch it, you definitely should.   I didn't think that the final challenge was as difficult as it could have been.  It wasn't nearly as hard as what those  Tough Enough  kids go through.   The best part of the episode...Road Rules was kicking Real World's ass in the physical portions of the competition and they reached the final station of the challenge much faster than them as well.  BUT...because their team has ALWAYS lacked unity, they sat at that final challenge forEVER!  Real World finally caught up to them, solved the puzzle, and moved on to be the grand prize winners.  It is true afterall...working as a team proves to be the key to conquering it all!   So congrats to the Real Worlders.  They deserved it.

      So Smelly and I just finished IMing and we made plans to go out for a few drinks this evening to catch up.  Like how her new name is Smelly?  Cuz really...my new name should be "Joe CuttheSmelly".  I reak today.  My pits are fully loaded and I am ready to take a motha out.   We are going to have drinks at Cosmos, our new hometown hangout.  $5 Stoli/Vanillas, not a bad bargain.  Although, last week, when I went with Reets, I spilled my complete first drink down my leg and into my bookbag.  It was nice.  And now I smell like a walking drunkard. I guess I have to put off cleaning more of my room until tomorrow.  I am really a crazy mother fucker.  The minute I knew that I would be having drinks instead, I immediately formulated a new plan as to how to still not miss out on the evening I was planning on having.  I am still going to empty out some of my drawers and organize some papers.  I will just wait to do my trunk tomorrow.  Its ok.  Not the end of the world.   I always have to have everything timed by like the minute.  It's a sick habit that I need to quit asap.   It's making me go quazy in my head. I am so hungry for lunch today.  I know I should have a salad and/or a cucumber.  But what I really want is a pineapple.   COVERED IN CHEESEBURGERS. It's just that my body accepts fat so much more easily than it accepts exercise or health food.   I gotta lose my gut someday, k?

      I actually started this entry last week, never got through it and am now going back to it and finishing.  Hee. I was saying what a good day I had last week, cuz it turns out that Paul and I will be taking a fatty vacation this summer.  We are going to spend a week in Orlando.  Kind of my idea.  I decided that I REALLY wanted to go to Universal Studios Florida.  Yes, I have been there before and yes it is fucking amazing...but it has been about 7 years since I did that and I am anticipating quite a few huge changes in their theme parks.  For example, the Jurassic Park 3 ride just opened.  YOWZERS!  It's just fun. We are staying in the most beautiful condo I have ever seen in my life.  I mean, it is HUGE and our suite has a master bedroom, another guest bedroom, a pull out couch, a full kitchen, two showers, a tub, a whirlpool, a living room, dining area, indoor/outdoor pool, golf, babysitting service (YAY), and so much else.  It is going to be fantastic.  And the best part....to stay in this condo for a week is going to cost us (drum role please) $122 total.  UM!  My parents have this time share thing that they NEVER use.  So they got first pick this time and gave it to me.  It is so cheap and amazing. My mom also secured us flights for $188 round trip.  OH MAN that is cool.  SO essentially we are paying piddles for an amazing time.  And it is something that Paul and I will get to do together.  I have never been on a real vacation before, unless it was with family.  And this is the exact way that I want to go!  Just he and I smooching and smooching.  And maybe even getting a tan.   Also, I can't wait to spend a couple of days at  urlLink Disney World  and   urlLink Universal Studios  CAN'T WAIT! This is really just about the best. We will probably spend a few days on the beach.  Go out to eat alot, ride bikes, maybe go fishing, watch the sunsets on the beach.  Really...it is everything I have ever wanted to do with Paul.  And to be able to do it just the two of us.  Man...I am a lucky boy.   As long as Paul gets a little bit of a better attitude about this whole thing... He has been kind of a shit, but I know that will change.  He is always a bitch until he realizes that there is no reason for it and then things usually settle down.   Plus...we are taking a plane!  Um!  I don't do planes.  I mean, I WILL do planes, as long as Paul is there with me, but without him, prolly not at this point.  I feel safe with him.  Even though he is a bitch...I do feel safe holding on to his arm and being held by him.   Sweet, sweet, strong boy of mine.   Maybe he will even call today.  Wouldn't that be a nice change of pace.  Weird to think that I just got home from taking care of him a week ago.  So much has changed since then.  So much.   This weekend, Rita's sister Jeannie came into town to play.  They went and saw Chicago on Saturday afternoon and then went out to a wonderful dinner together.  They are very close sistas and I know that they truly enjoy being in eachother's company.  Jeannie is getting married on November 9th.  WOW.  Still scares me a bit, and I ain't even IN the wedding.  Well, sort of I am.  I will be the wasted uncle standing in the corner talking about the old days when Jeannie was a little whippersnap.   Nah. But I definitly won't be handing out any programs either.  :-D Friday night, Rita, Kelly, Jeannie and I spent the night blasting music and having a, well, um, blast!  We sang along to Rent, ate pizza, drank some libations, and all in all had a wonderful time together.  Rita, Jeannie, and I had some intense, and introspective conversations as well.  I walked away from it all feeling like I know Jeannie just that much better.  And also that I love Rita just that much more.  She is a strong girl, that one. What else? I also started the overwhelming, nightmare of a project, of cleaning my room.  I have decided to rid myself of any excess baggage.  Which means, letters and cards from the past, old pictures I don't want anymore, knick-knacks from hell, and even my Nintendo 64.  Shit's just got to go.  If you want it, let me know...cuz you can definitely have it.   I still gots PlayStation to deal with.   So, I did the first major phase of cleaning last night.   I am planning on doing another phase tonight, another tomorrow, and so on, until the week is over and I have a brand new place to hang my hat.  This cleaning and organizing has been a REAL long time coming, actually since I moved out of Oswego, and I absolutely have to get it done this week.  Nothing will stand in my way. Not even pizza.  Tonight is the finale episode of the Road Rules/Real World Challenge.  Who will take the gold?   I am predicting that it will be Road Rules.  They are just a stronger team physically.  As a group, they kind of suck, but as competitors, they usually outshine those Real Worlders.  And that is too bad...cuz who don't like the Real World BETTER than Road Rules?   Also, at 8pm, NBC's Fear Factor is doing their Tournament of Champions.  All of the winners from the past year will be coming together to see who the king is.  Imagine what they are going to have to eat tonight!  I am predicting diarehhea.  Or someother spelling of the same word. This is going to be a tough week, but I think I am up for the challenge.  Last week was a GREAT week, but I knew the whole time that this week was coming.  I really have to take it slow, be as patient as possible with my friends, and try my best to start anew.   One day at a time.

      Shit.  When you miss a day of writing in here, I feel like so much happens.   Yesterday turned out to be such an incredibly amazing day.  It was a fine day at first.  Normal.   But then a serious of good things started to happen.  I had some great email exchanges with Edward.  Some great letters/exhanges/conversations.  Definitely made my day fun.   I ate Burger King for lunch, which I am REALLY not trying to do,

      So the best thing just happened.  Rita and I just went upstairs to decorate Angie's door.  We put posters of graduation, quotes, pictures, cards, etc.  As we finished, the buzzer rang and she and I snuck down to our apartments; covertly hiding from FUCKFACES' friend Jen who was waiting outside.  When we got back into Kelly's room, Rita and I waited for them to clear the stairs and then opened the door and listened to CUNT MOTHER FUCKER STUPID FAGGOT ASS FUCKFACE say: "Look at this, it kinda makes me want to puke". Now...are we fucking kidding?????? How DARE he?  I mean...HOW DARE HE?   Being fair, I realize that I say shit about fuckface all the time behind his back.  But he has never heard it.  Actually, even if he did hear it I didn't care...but it just wasn't the same.  He said that comment, insinuating that we are no where near the friends with Angie that he is.   Sorry...but are you a fucking retard?  Fuckface...you have been around 3 days.  I have known Angie for 5 years.   Faggot...you ain't NEVER gonna be to Angie what I am.  I don't care if you are the last two lesbos on earth.  You will NEVA BE!   So I go to my journal and I say hurtful things cuz that is the only way that I know how to vent.   If he has the balls to say the same comment to Angie...then so be it.  But I am sure he doesn't.  And I DREAD the idea that Angie would entertain any such remark.   She wouldn't right? Whatever...Rita and I did what we could for this occassion...and hopefully Angie understands that.   As for Fuckface...well this whole thing will go no further...but just so we all know...I hope this kid comes into some major trouble in his life.   And if not...I will cause the trouble.   ;) I feel better now.   It's just that I spent a good portion of my day putting this shit together...and then having this ass say something flippantly about it actually hurt.   I guess the main question is...why does it hurt? I really need to get some tougher skin.

      This is going to be really quick today.  I have spent my ENTIRE day doing nothing, but playing and I still haven't found time to write in this journal. The two topics I would like to discuss are Paul and my vacation plans and my conversation with Edward. First, Paul wants to take me on vacation this summer.  We had discussed going to California for a week, but those plans fell through.  (refer to February's entries to find out why they fell through)  Then we thought about spending a week in Albany or spending a week in Vermont or something.  So then, I am sitting in the movie theater this weekend, with my parents, and all of a sudden it HIT me!  I KNEW where I wanted to go on vacation.  WELL UNIVERSAL STUDIOS FLORIDA OBVIOUSLY! YAYAYAYAY!  I have been there before; when I was 17 or so, and it was fucking the coolest thing I have been to in my life.  Being an actor, you can see why.  As soon as I got home, I called Paul to explain my idea.  He immediatly shot it down.  Of fucking course.  Like he has any better ideas.  Or maybe he was just in pain or something.  Whatever.  ;) He was like: "Joe, we I don't have the money for both of our tickets, the visit, the hotel, the transport, etc."  Then I explained my plan.  My parents are letting me use their Condo Time Share whenever I want.  The condos are BEAUTIFUL and have a kitchen, living room, bathroom, sometimes two bedrooms, closets, pools, fitness centers, saunas, etc.  But they are only located in certain areas.  ONE OF THESE AREAS BEING DISNEY WORLD!  UM!!!!  Cuz Universal is right by Disney.  Right by.  So we could go to Disney and to Universal all in the same trip AND stay right in the area for free!  Amazing right?  Right. So then he is like, "I still don't think I will have the money to pay for both of our airfare, etc."  So I talked to my parents about it and they said that they could prolly get me roundtrip airfare at like $200 or so, depending on when we make our decision and what airline we use.  (My mom can get some phat deals through work)  I could pay that.  Easily.  Well, not so easily, but easily enough!   Paul is still wishy washy about the whole thing, but I know that is because he didn't come up with the idea.  I don't know.  That is where I want to go. That is the only place that I want to go now.   I have never been on vacation with a boyfriend before.  How fucking exciting!  I just hope we can get our shit together and really do this.  I never care about going away anywhere and honestly that is why I never go ANYWHERE.  But this is the first time that I WANT WANT WANT to go somewhere.  And I think this trip is totally up my ally.   Keep your fingers crossed for me folks! Ok...the conversation with Edward.   WAS AMAZING! He and I have such a good rhythm when we talk.  He is so fucking adorable that sometimes I want to climb through the computer and eat him alive.  He is funny, sensitive, and endearing.  He cares about me so much and I know he knows that I feel the same way about him.  If he were gay, he and I would be together in 30 seconds.  Well, that is if there was no such thing as a Paul.  But all of this is based on that idea.   Edward and I have gotten to know eachother so much more since I graduated college.  And ironically enough, I have only seen him once since I left.  And I graduated exactly 2 years ago tomorrow.  (OMIGOD!  DID I REALLY GRADUATE TWO YEARS AGO TOMORROW!  HOLY FUCK!  (May 15th, 2000).   In the last two years, he and I have spent only like 6 hours in the same room.  But we IM at least once or twice a week, I will start calling him, and he is moving down here within months.  Having him around as a permanant addition is not only going to be fun, it is going to be something that both he and I have waited for for a long time.   If he wasn't so damn attractive, I would never question our friendship.   I am very happy with Paul.  He is the one that I want.  He is the only one that I would even consider.  I mean Edward is straight afterall.  (Maybe not completely...but too straight for my taste).  But sometimes it is a little difficult to be friends with someone that is exactly what you are physically looking for in a man.  He is big, strong, and the exact type of man that I am drawn too.   It is strange for me to have any sort of opinion on this because I don't look at Edward as though he were an object of lust.  I look at him as a friend that drives me crazy sometimes.  You know?  I am older than him by almost 3 years and that puts a rift between us.  We have only really been friends, in the same location, for 6 months.  He is obsessed with finding a girlfriend and I am obsessed with the boyfriend I already have.  Circumstances should prevent us from even becoming a friendship match, but circumstances can be misleading. I cherish him.  I do.  I am very excited for his upcoming visit and even more excited to have him in the city.  I hope that he and I can find some sort of common playing field and that we can strengthen the bond that we already have.  He takes care of me in some ways and I do the same to him.   If only he would gain like 100 pounds, or even worse, lose like 100 pounds...then I would never look at him as having any sort of physical prowess.  And then I would never wonder what it would be like to go to that next, unfortunate, impossible to change, level.   Life is confusing as fuck.   How could I possibly write about these two topics in the same entry?  How could I possibly?

      So Kelly's sister just Imed me asking where she was.  I thought that something was wrong so I asked her what was up.  She ended up needing help with an English assignment.  Rita and I both tried to help her the best that we could.  But we told her to call Kelly and leave a message too, and guess what kel?  Your sister needs to write about a quote in comparison to two books she read this year.  (or pretended to read)  One of the books is  I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings .  Didn't you just read that??? The Russo girls reading the same book at the same time.  Now that is a strange coincidence.

      Okay...back from lunch.  I had pizza and so did Rizza.  Yum.  I haven't had pizza in weeks.  Of course, it wasn't true NYC pizza.  It was "silly West End" pizza.  Good enough. So...here I sit.  Been pretty quiet at work today.  Everyone seems to be really burned out from the big dinner we had last week.  Fine with me.  I love the peace.  Penelope is out today with a headache.  Probably induced by dealing with crazies all week.  Poor thing had to fend for herself for like 7 work days.  Now that shit is tough. I am sitting here with nothing on my mind.  I have no idea what to write about.  That seems strange considering that I have been away from this journal for weeks.  But shit has pretty much stayed the same. Paul is still in some horrible pain and trying his best to recoup. Kelly is finishing up with college and then will try to recoup. Rita has finished with the dinner aka the demise of her existence, and is slowly recouping. Penelope is home...recouping. RECOUPS! Mariah is preparing (sort of) for her big move to NYC.  Girl better get on the ball and find her ass a job.  Cuz hells knows she is going to blow what little money she has on fun when she gets here.  Who wouldn't? Edward was tentatively scheduled to come down for a visit this weekend, but I have a feeling that that is off. S'ok.  I do want to see him, but suddenly I am not so ready.  Long story. Oh ok...I know what to write about. When I got home last night, Rita and Kelly introduced me to "Friend".  He is a new member of our household, but lucky bastard don't have to pay no rent.  Friend wears a red hoody, Gorilla slippers and a t-shirt.  He sits on the couch and holds onto the remote.  Just in case he don't like what is on the tube.   Did I mention that Friend is in actuality a pillow?   But the scariest fucking pillow ever.  As Rita, Kelly, and I were discussing Friend last night, Kelly vocalized how scared she was of having him sitting around in the living room.  I didn't really understand how a dressed up pillow could be scary, until I walked out of my room at 3am,  butt naked, and fully believed he was a real human sitting on the couch.  My heart lept into my throat and then my skin crawled.  That little fucker is dangerous, I think.  Rita had a nasty run in with Friend this morning too.  I feel Friend may be brutally murdered if he don't clean up his act. Paul just called.  He said that he feels much better today.  He met with the surgeon this morning and he said that the wound looks better.  He taught him how to change the bandages in a different, more preventative way.  So hopefully no more infection.  What a relief.  Of course Paul is talking about working as soon as tomorrow night.  Stupid ass.  He best take care of himself, cuz if he lands in the hospital again because of his own foolishness, I will NOT be so pleasant when I change the bandages next time.  And that's fo sho! Uh oh.  I think I just smelled eggs again.  Damn that Rita...she best go relieve herself before she stinks up the joint.  WAWAWAWINKLES! Days until Kelly's graduation from COLLEGE: 15.  Days until Kelly realizes what a cruel cruel world it is after school: 18. Days until the eggs leave my bowels: 10 minutes. Gosh...so much is coming up.  Angie and Kelly are both leaving college and moving on to that next phase of their life.  Mariah is moving here in the next two weeks.   Does it ever end? Nevle.   Aaron Neville. Last night I jerked off 3 times between 10:30pm and 3am.  Is that a lot?  Well, if you take a look at the scars on my dick...maybe.  I was just so horny.  And the more I jerked off, the more I needed to do it again.  I was up all night playing with myself.   Maybe tonight I will only do it twice.   Considering that I woke up and jerked off again this morning...maybe I don't need to do it at all.   Do you realize that in 9 hours, I beat my pud 4 times.  DAMN!  They don't call this my sexual peak for nothin.   I am just so lucky that I have someone to share all these sexual experiences with during my sexual peak.   Yeah fucking right.  I share these experiences with my hand and erotic stories only. mmmmm....erotic stories.  I am about ready for some new ones.  The ones I have now are so old and boring.  I can basically recite them and that's no fun.   Maybe I will have Kelly or Rita write me a new erotic story!  Wouldn't that be fun!  Kind of sick and twisted, but I would be willing to give it a try.  Actually...what a GREAT experiment!  Then I could see if they REALLY knew what turned me on.   Sick....why would they need to know that?   yum....why wouldn't they?

      Wow.  Back at work.  Pretty surreal morning.  Everyone was really nice and totally supportive of me when I came in today and that felt good.  I don't know why I get so uptight about being gone for so long.  I knew that everyone would be cool, but I just get so crazy in my head sometimes.   So hungry and I just farted and it smells like eggs.  Eggles.  Egg bagels.  SICK! Alright...Rita and I are going to take quizzes and play until lunch. Be back.

      So here I am, in Albany.  I have had the worst migraine since I walked in the door last night.  I spent about 2 hours vomiting all the food I DIDN'T eat today and then held my head and rocked back and forth until about 4am.  I finally got some sleep and was up at 10am this morning with the same damn headache.  I did everything I could to make it go away.  I masturbated, took a hot shower, smoked a  bowl, and then finally bit the bullet and bought some Excedrin Migraine pills at CVS.  After this, my parents and I went to the theater to see  Changing Lanes .  Not awful, but not recommendable.  Ben Affleck was suprisingly adorable and I did have a good time.  About half way through the movie, the headache ceased and I have been getting increasingly better.  I now just have the dull ache and hopefully can move forward and have a good rest of the time with my parents. I came to Albany for two reasons.  One was to see my mother on Mother's Day.  The other was to go to a neutral place and try to clear my head.  Leaving Boston yesterday was one of the hardest goodbyes that I have had in a long while.   To say the absolute least, my last 9 days have been full of stress, heartache, frustration, fear, and ironically some beautiful moments.  I will never forget all of what happened.  I have images that will stay with me forever.   When I first got to Boston, Paul was wonderful.  He was in good spirits, was incredibly excited to have me there helping him out.  On Thursday we walked around Boston and spent the majority of the day doing some food shopping, Mother's Day shopping, and visiting friends.  Friday was just as good; hanging out with Mariah and the baby, doing some more shopping, and just feeling great.  Around 11pm, as I was doing the dressing change on Paul, I noticed that the hole (this unbelievably LARGE hole) was turning black in some areas.  His pain was starting to get much worse and his spririts crashed.  During the day Saturday, his pain and temperature started to rise.  I started to panic.  When I took his last temperature reading, it was at 104 and I knew that I had to get him to the emergency room as quickly as I could.   We were in the emergency room for about 6 or 7 hours that night and they cleaned him up, brought the fever down, and foolishly sent us home.  On Sunday, the hole was COMPLETELY covered in black and I immediately rushed him to the emergency room again with a fever hovering around 103. We spent the night in the hospital that night.  Me sleeping horribly in the waiting room, Paul cooped up in some hospital bed all alone.  I wasn't even allowed to stay with him.  AND they kept us in the damn emergency waiting room for about 2 hours before they even took him in.   He was so brave.  Such a good patient and said "thank you" and "I love you" at every possible moment.  I called work, explained the situation, and ended up staying even longer.  Tuesday afternoon, it was back to the emergency room.  At  this point, Paul's pain was so intense that he was screaming, crying, and scaring the shit out of me.  Upon this visit to the emergency room, Paul spent two nights in the hospital, racking up more bills and keeping me sleeping in 2 hour increments.  It was hard.   They cleaned his hole out, gave him some sort of preventative infection prescription, and debated whether or not to seal up his gaping hole.  They ended up not doing anything about it. I missed my dinner, I missed a full week of work, and on top of all of this, I feel like I missed a whole week of my life.  As good of a feeling as it was to take care of my baby and to make sure that he was ok at every moment, I never felt so lonely in all my life.  Maybe it's Karma.  I don't know. I cleaned the house, did laundry about every day, did all of the food shopping, all prescription filling, most bandage changes, helped him shit, bathe, eat, get through the pain, etc.  It was exhausting.   I must admit that I kept my attitude positive.  I grew closer to him than ever before and I finally took care of him the way he has always taken care of me.   So many thing went running through my mind last week.  I thought about what it must be like for couples with AIDS and how hard it is to face that disease as one's future.  At least with this scenario, I was always pretty confident that he would eventually get better.  After a week of taking care of someone as though they were as incompetent as an infant, I realized that I don't have what it takes to take care of anyone but myself. I realized how selfish I really am.  How unfortunate and unacceptable this is.  I feel like in a lot of ways, I have become a cynical, mean person.  I used to be so kind.  So approachable, so proud to be sensitive and available.  I am more closed off to my personal life now than I have ever been before and it doesn't feel good at all. Taking care of Paul.... Knowing that it was one year ago this week that Kelly's mom was fighting for her life in the hospital... Seeing and feeling how precious life is and how little time we all have... Having to sacrifice everything I wanted for a week for someone I loved... Realizing in some ways that I have strength in me to do things I never thought I could do... The whole experience was very surreal.   I am scared to go back home.   It has been 9 days since I have been in NYC.  Once out of the place for an extended period, it is hard to get excited about jumping back in.   I feel like the challenges that lay before me are so great that I will never climb out of it.  I feel tired and I feel beaten down.  In no way was the last week and a half rejuvenating, nor did it help me to get a more idealistic perspective on my current situation.  I feel uneasy about going home.   When things get tough I shut people out.  I find it hard to ask for help.  And after the way I have been over the last couple of months, it was even more difficult for me to reach out to the people I love, because I wasn't there when they reached out.   Man, I don't know.  I have two girls waiting for me at home that I love so dearly.  That are always there for me and were there for me last week, in prayers and thoughts if not in the physical sense.  I have a friend at work that I love dearly as well, that looked after me while I was gone and missed having me in the chair next to her, I hope.  I don't have much in NYC.  But what I do have I cherish.  It is hard for me to show this because I feel very stressed and frustrated with my current standing as a wannabe actor in NYC.  What I have to remind myself of is that all of my friends are in the same position.  We are all struggling with who we are and what we want out of life, yet forced to race against time to complete it all.   If I realize that we are all in the same place, why I am trying to control it all?  Why do I feel the need to be the leader?  Why do I force people to fit in with my view of life and it's complications?   And most of all...how do I change this realization so that I can emerge with my old self confidence while still having the love, support, and respect of those I need most?   I am scared to leave Paul alone.  I talked to him this morning and his parents never came to see him.  That hurt.  That hurt alot.  But he is strong with it and I am sure in a lot of ways is the reason for them not coming to be with him.  Yet, I come from a family that I would give my life for and that would do the same for me...so why didn't they come anyway?  Did they at any point realize how serious this whole situation was?   Why was I the only one at the hospital?  Why was I the only one taking him to the clinic, the hospital, the fucking bathroom?   Paul felt so insecure about losing his position at work, that he didn't even tell them that he was in and out of the hospital all week.  Trying to hide this fact from those that did call was difficult, if not upsetting.  You would think that these people would try to get him back on his feet, not steal his shifts right from under him.  And then not even ask how he was really doing. Wow...so much in my head.  Some bitterness, some fear, alot of sadness, and absolutely no self-confidence.  But I feel like, with rock bottom comes a new beginning.  I have to change my life.  Immediately.   I am ready to grow again.  I am ready to expand, love my friends, work on my patience level, and begin anew.   That is if I don't get fired from my job.  Then I will be spending all of my time looking through the want ads. I am grateful for my housemates, my co-workers, and my family.  Without which I think I would collapse and spend a long time trying to bounce back.   I am going home tomorrow.  I will be ready by the time it happens. That was the whole reason of coming home now wasn't it?   I want more and to get that...I am going to have to give it. If nothing else, the main thing I learned this week is about how to be generous.  How to be patient.  How to love unconditionally and how to sacrifice.  This is a lesson I need to re-learn.   I need to be this way every day.  Not just when my loved ones lose everything.

      Well hello!  I am now in Boston and the fucking funniest thing just happened.  (I am at the place where Mariah baby-sits/nannies whatever) The baby, without us even noticing, just opened a box of CapnCrunch and dumped it all in her lap.  She is covered in little yellow cereal pieces and I am pissing myself with laughter.  Oh shit thats funny. So yeah...I am in Boston on the computer.  It has been an absolutely incredible trip so far.  Paul and I are like peas and carrots.  The poor kid has a hole in his back the size of a grapefruit.  No.  I am not exaggerating.  Mariah can fit her whole fist in the hole.  You see...when you have a polinoital cyst operation, the way it heals is from the inside out.  So this huge crator in his back will have to re-layer itself and eventually, over months, fill back in.  I have seen serated muscle, actual lipids, and I think the outer lying  of his spinal cord.  It is the most horrifying thing I have ever seen with my eyes...and definitely the most horrifying thing I have ever touched.  I have to change the dressings twice a day.  This means, pulling out these blood stained gauze pads from the inside of his body.  Then I soke new gauzes in saline and shove them back in the hole.   When Paul first showed me the wound, I just started to cry.  It is so real and raw.  And to think that this monstrosity of a wound is on my boyfriends back... It's sad and it's gross.   In other news...Mariah is wonderful.  Seeing her makes me laugh, smile, and excited.  Unfortunately the days have flown by so far.  I am trying my hardest to slow the time down, but that seems fruitless. Boston is beautiful.  The leaves on the trees, the smells in the air, the people that we've seen.  I just love it.  And of course I never want to leave.  But that's cool...I will toughen up by Sunday and get my lame ass back on the bus.   It is really weird to be writing in my bloggle from fucking Newbury Street. Baby is going crazy.   Paul and I watched Hedwig and the Angry Inch last night.  Fucking awesome movie.  Ask Rita about it.  She and I saw it together when she first moved in and we LVOED it.   Hey Reets...you finish Wally Lamb yet?   Have a safe drive to Syracuse!  I hope you have a wonderful wonderful time.  You have earned it.   See you on Sunday when we both have to return to hell.   Hello operator that is. K...thaz it!  Unfortunately, see you all soon!

      So I was just walking down the street, very excited about the slice of pizza I was about to eat, when this man walks up to me and says: "Can I ask you a question?" Here was our conversation: Julio:  "Can I ask you a question?" Me:  "What?" (I was a little rude cuz I thought that he was going to yell at me about throwing my cigarette on the street) J:  I was wondering if you have ever given any thought to modeling. Me:  Uh...yeah.  Well, you see...a friend of mine was just asked the same question on the street.  She then ended up giving this "Modeling Agency" her credit card number and they stole like $600 from her. J:  No no no.  It's not like that. Me:  Ok...what is the deal then? J:  Well I was wondering if you had ever given thought to print modeling.  You know, modeling for fashion magazines, billboards, advertisements, etc.  You have the perfect face for it. Me:  Yes I have considered it, but don't really know how to look into something like that. J:  Well I work for Options, an off-shoot of Ford modeling agency.  We handle (insert random model's names here).  (I think he said something like Wilomena or Filomena...some high profile model)  I would love it if you would consider coming in and letting us take your picture.  We would want to see how photogenic you are and if you would be interested in letting us represent you. Me: What what WHAT?  (Ok...I didn't really say that)  Sure...I would love to come in and at least see what you are all about. J: (Hands me his card----his name is Julio) Great.   --------------edited bullshit------------------------ Me:  I am not available until Monday earliest. J:  Ok...why don't we schedule an appointment for Monday night at 7. Me:  Sure.  I would love to come.   J:  (Shakes my hand) This is a very exciting opportunity.  Be on time and bring some pictures of yourself. Me:  Okay...see you then. END CONVO. UM!!!!  How exciting.  How random that this same thing just happened to Mariah and now it is happening to me.  I will make SURE that they do not get a credit card number or any sort of deposit.  I know better than that.  I also informed the guy that I was an actor, not a model and he told me that they represent quite a few actors as well.   Could this be my shot at an agency?  Who knows.  But it is fun and it definitely made me smile real big.   Today is turning out to be fucking bomb!   urlLink Check out their website here

      There are two women having a huge squabble right now behind my back.  They are attacking eachother.  Rita was just in the office, but luckily her boss, JABA, saved her and pulled her out.  Probably to fax something.  ;) They are now basically ripping the skin off eachother's faces.   Penelope just walked in having stood in back of Julia Stiles in line at a local restaurant.  Damn.  Why do I never get to see anyone cool?   OMIGOD...they are STILL yelling at eachother.  It is pretty funny actually.  Seeing these two have an argument is like the highlight of my day. They were just saying how wonderful Rita is, which is good.  She ain't a part of this shit at all.  And justly so.  She ain't crazy like the rest of them.   I love how they have been screaming about the same nonsensical item for like 20 minutes now.   oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooohahahahahahahahahahaha!  Man...they are brutal! I am loving this.   Time to go make some popcorn.

      I was just talking to Penelope about last night's  Real World .  We have both decided (and I will be vague, just in case you haven't seen it) that Tonya really didn't need to walk around the house showing the little present she had in her cup.  I mean DISGUSTING!  She made herself look like an ass while totally grossing the rest of the world out.   Can someone PLEASE tell me one reason why it was ok for her to show her insides to everyone?

      Last night when I got home, I played some TLC and just about sobbed my eyes out.  It has been almost a week since I found out about Lisa Lopes going away and I still feel sad about it.  Is that normal?  Any time I have heard someone be like "Oh man...when 'this' celebrity died, I was so upset; I just couldn't go on", I have wanted to punch them in the face.  But this time, I do feel sad.  I wish it didn't happen.  I wish that things could be different.   Second...did you happen to catch  urlLink THE REAL WORLD CHICAGO  last night?  UM?!?!?!  Besides the fact that the whole group is about ready to kill eachother, next week's episode made me almost have a heart attack.  The episode is taped during September 11th.  I forgot all about them being in the house when it happened!  The previews brought back so many memories and instantly triggered another cry fest.  It is so easy to move on and pretend like nothing ever happened, but when you are reminded with vivid images, it all comes rushing back.  Seeing these kids sit around the television and on the phones with their loved ones totally brings me back to that fateful Tuesday.  What an incredible and awful life experience.  I can't wait to see the episode next week, but I also know that I will have to watch it in my room alone.  Rocking myself to sleep.  We are half way to the end!  It isn't too late to start watching! I have decided that I am starting to hate these cast members.  Kyle can go fuck himself, cuz he is turning out to be a real piece of shit.  Aneesa needs to wake the fuck up and stop being such a self-absorbed bitch.  If Chris opens his lame ass, cheesy, self-help book mouth again, I may just stop in Cambridge, on my way to Boston, and fucking kick his teeth in.  Tonya, the girl has to just cut it.  Kera...you really are a slut, aren't you?  Theo, you my man.  You keep it up...you are one of two that don't piss me off now.  Kerri, you are my dream weaver!  I love you with my whole entire heart. So really...if the whole cast, cept for Theo and Kerri, for some reason die during the 9/11 episode, I will smile.   Ok, no I wouldn't, but can they all just stop acting like little babies!?  They were SO cool before and now...babies Mcbaby. Just to let everyone know...Paul's surgery went extremely well.  Or so we think.  It will take a couple of days before we know for certain.  He was able to go home last night and will be sleeping on his stomach for awhile.  He was really groggy when I spoke to him the first time.  The second time, he was much better, but in some pain.  Don't worry Paul...I will be there soon to take care of you!  I am very excited to get out of here today.  I have been really edge lately and I am about ready to collapse.  I feel much better today, but that is because I get to escape NYC for a weekend.  A LONG weekend that is!  Sometimes you just need to do that.  The city can wear you down incredibly fast.  Long commutes, shit job, no money, visiting friends...just all so much when combined together.  And then it is time to run away and rejuvenate.   I crashed hard after Jessica left this weekend.  I went into this hole and couldn't find my way out right away.  I felt much better when I woke up today.  Boston being the reason or not, I am relieved that I feel good again today.  Sometimes I get nervous that I won't EVER pull out of the low.  But I always do and must come back to this entry to remind myself of that again in the future.  The big dinner for work is May 9th!  Yay!  I really am excited.  I get to dress up, drink free champagne or wine all night.  I get to eat some good, free food.  It will be a blast.  I had a very good time last year.  Rita is very excited too, I think.  All of the work she has done for the last two months will be coming to a head.  It is really quite a thrill!  Unfortunately, we won't have anyone real famous at this dinner.  Well, I hear that Herman Wouk will be coming back.  That's always a special treat.  I mean, the man has to gum all of his food, but at least he is SOMEONE recognizable.  YAY.  Can't wait. My throat is hurting today.   6 more hours until I can get on that fucking bus and hightail it outta here.  I probably won't get into Boston until 10:30pm, which blows, but it's better than not going at all.  I really could wait until the morning and then go.   YEAH MOTHA FUCKING RIGHT! Gotta piss. Be back soon.

      Back.  Didn't you always hate those people that when writing in your yearbook or a letter or whatever, they are like: "Gotta go shower, be back in a minute."  And then it would be "Hi...so I am back". I think you understand the point I am trying to make. So I gotta drive home today.  I am very excited to go to my place in Albany.  My parents have planned some very fun things for my birthday.  Holy fuck I am going to be 25!  Um.  Yeah...at 25 I thought that I would DEFINITELY be piss ass broke working for a Jewish organization.  Hmmm.  yeah. Tonight, my parents and I are going to drink some wine, smoke some bowls, eat tacos, and just enjoy being in eachother's presence.  I don't get to see them nearly enough.  Tomorrow, we celebrate my birthday and I have no clue what could be in store for me.  Kind of fun.   Lies. REAL fun.  I just wish I could take a quick nap before I drive home.  That would be ideal. I feel like as I type, my brain just goes soft and here I sit dumb and brain softed.  No headache, but no intelligence either.  Kind of a horrible trade off if you ask me.   Also, my eyes go lazy after two seconds of not blinking.   I might be tired. Yeah, that's it.   OK, so I gotta go.  I feel like I am in outer space right now. Ian is in Rita's office talking and talking and talking and talking... Should it annoy me? cuz it does.  He is just so....so...so...oh I don't know.  Nice? Yeah...he is just so nice.   Balright...goodnight and goodmorning.  HAPPY GAY PRIDE ALL!

      Well, I have been at work for about 2 hours and haven't even pretended to do any real work.  Man this job is cake during the summer.   So LAST night turned into an event that was totally unexpected and wonderful.  It started with simple margaritas at The Heights, this absolutely adorable little bar/restaurant down the street from work.  We (Penelope, Kelly, Rita, and myself) sat on the roof top patio and chugged down some frozen margaritas, margaritas on the rocks, and some free shots.  I mean wow!  They was good and so were the talks and laughs that we had. After two hours of drinking, and having experienced a torrential downpour, we finally peeled our asses off of the seats and got cabs home.  Rita and Kelly were being loud in the cab and I actually asked them to quiet down.  That was horrible of me.  A lot of bullshit has been going through my head these days and I thank God that I have such good friends to be able to vent to.  They were so respectful and polite and allowed me to be the killjoy.  I appreciate the support.  All of it. Once home, Rita goes "I'll be back in a couple minutes" and up and bolted from the apartment.  After five minutes of wondering where the heck she could have gone, Rita returns with 3 slices of steaming hot pizza.  Now...what gift could be better than that!?!?  After eating her slice, Rita went to put her bag down in her room and ended up passing out completely on her bed, leaving us to wonder...is she dead or alive?   No one checked on her. She was dead.  And it's all our fault!  Stupid Joe.  Stupid Kelly.  We let our friend die. Kelly and I stayed up and drank a DOUBLE bottle of red wine.  Needless to say, I was pretty trashed by the time I went to bed.  Kelly and I had some intensely wonderful talks and listened to some great music.  It was all very nice.  Around 1:30am I shoved the pizza in my face and collapsed on my bed, passing out almost instantly.  This morning at 8am I rolled out of bed to pack my shit for home and to shower the grime off my sweaty, nasty body.  Rough morning.  Finding a parking spot in the city is a nightmare, but I actually scored a sweet spot right in front of the building. God works in mysterious ways. Oh man.  I gotta go put more change in the meter.  shit mother fucker don't want to get off my lazy ass and go do that, but  BE RIGHT BACK!

      So once again my mom is the most amazing woman on the planet. I have been researching car rental places for Paul and I for the big vakay.  The best deal I could find was $300 for the week (insurance included) for a shitty cavalier.  That is an impossibility.  Paul and I are not spending all of our money on a car rental.  Cuz then the only fun we would have would be driving around town.  And then driving some more.  We'd probably take a break for a bite to eat and then jump in the car again to do some more driving. I call my mom and explain to her that I don't want to spend my vacation driving around town and doing nothing else. She's like: "Give me 5 minutes". I sit patiently and wait for her to call back. When she does, she informs me that she has reserved us a car for $167 total.  (insurance included) UM!  Is this woman an angel sent from God?  Cuz I think maybe.  Now, not only do we have a phat place to stay in, we have a car to drive around wherever we want.  The beach is about an hour away from where we are.  We would have taken a bus, or ridden bikes.  HAHAHAHA But now...eh, we jump in our ride and cruise on down to the sand.  I might even park it right on the beach.  :-D And the best part of the whole thing is....WE PICK IT UP AT THE AIRPORT!  AWESOME!  No cabs ever! I love you mom.  You are constantly saving my ass.

      Well today is off to a rough start already.   At least it is 11am.  Time sure flies when you are bullshitting on AIM all morning.   Last night Rita and I went to dinner at the NEPTUNE.   The Neptune is Kelly, Rita and my favorite restaurant.  I have always gotten chicken souvlaki.  Always.  I think we have been there about 18 times since we have moved to Astoria and I get it on every visit.  Well once I got a cheeseburger.  But that one time sucked, so that doesn't count.  Their food is excellent and the service is so quick.  I literally SHOVED my face and actually at one point Rita goes: "You're pretty stoned, huh?".  It was that obvious.  I only smoked a bowl, but it went right to my head.  Somewhat like bubbly.  It was a good night.  It's nice to do things like that once in awhile. Tonight, Kelly, Rita and I are going out for Ritas.  Margaritas.  We are going to this place called the "Heights".  Supposedly it is this roof top bar and it is pretty cool.  Can't wait to see what they got to offer.  I don't think I have ever gone out just for ritas before.  Gonna be interesting.  I don't even know if I like margaritas.  The only time I have really had them have been at TGI Fridays or a mexican restaurant.   What else...Penelope is patiently, sort of, waiting for a return email from a boy that she potentially has a minor crush on.  No email as of this entry, but we all have our fingers crossed that he will contact her asap.  I think he will.   I know he will. I saw part of  The West Wing  last night. I think I may have to watch this show next season.  It's pretty good.  Even if I don't understand a word they are saying. Also,  South Park  did an amazing homage to the Simpsons last night.  That was great.   And lastly, I saw part of  CrankYankers  or whatever that new show on Comedy Central is.  It was amusing and then I jerked off and went to bed. I printed out the EMINEM lyrics to "Without Me" this morning.  I was unpleasantly surprised to find that not only does he rip apart Moby in the second verse, he also calls him a "fag".  What is wrong with these people?  I think EMINEM is an amazing artist, but shit like that is just so uncalled for.  If anything, he's the fag.  If anything...let's just stop using that term fag. Last friday night, when I called Paul to tell him about the guy that ripped me apart on the bus, one of the idiot things he said was: "Well, Joe.  You call people fag too.  What goes around comes around." It hurt that he said that, cuz when I use it, I think it's ok.  Now the more I think about it...I realize that it's not ok.  I used to be afraid to even utter a word that rhymed with fag.  But now, I use it pretty frequently.  I am going to try to curb it again.  Although Paul was ignorant in what he said, he does have a point.  And he doesn't use the word.  So I will see what I can do about this. As for words like "Dyke and lesbo", I can DEFINITELY still use those cuz I'm not one and it won't hurt to be called that.   Makes sense. ;) What else...today for lunch Rita and I are getting California Rolls.  "Pizza Friday" now has a sister called "California Roll Thursday".  And I love them.  Pretty hungry and pretty excited to shove my face with 8 rolls at lunch.  hee hee hee hee (puke) Alright...enoughs enough.

      SO my mom just calls me and tells me that my granny's house was hit by a tornado.  UM! It took her porch right off the house.  It flew into the sky or the lake or whatever.  (She lives in Utica on a lake.) OMIGOD!  Does this really happen to little old ladies? How awful.  I have been trying to reach her but the line is consistently busy.

      WOW. COULD I BE MORE FUCKING BORED AT MY JOB??? At least I have some friends to play with and pizza down the block.  If it weren't for those two things, I just don't know what I would do.  However, I have the most intense garlic breath now.  It's pretty bad.  Every time I burp...I go "Now what is THAT flavor?"  And then I realize, it's piggy-ness.  I ate two slices AND had a cigarette in about 12 minutes.  Um.  Help me someone. So I wrote Paul this full page email.  He has this new job, as I have mentioned. So I write him this huge email to which he responds with the following: "Here I am." HAHAHAHAHA No really.  That's all he wrote back. "Here I am." Here I am. What a crazy monster. Also..one other thing.... TWO RITAS AND I AINT KIDDING THIS TIME~~~~~~~~~~~~~ TWO. RITAS.  OR. NO. RITAS.  And I don't mean Rita Lovely. The end.

      Ever wonder why those frogs come flying out of the sky in the movie Magnolia? Well, it has been plaguing me ever since I saw it.  Luckily, Penelope is a fucking genius and strange coincidences happen to her all the time.  Visit  urlLink her blogger  and read today's entry to learn more.

      Something else pretty great happened today. I was outside reading my new book  urlLink How to be a Working Actor  when I came across a section on headshots.  It seemed as though I did everything right: Wear only solid colors, no jewelry for men, two different shots (open mouth/closed mouth), pictures with warmth in the eyes, pictures that look like myself, pics that make you want to stare at them for awhile and then: "Choose a photographer in NYC or Los Angeles.  It's not that local photographers are untalented, they simply do not have a frame of reference to do the photo work that you will need."  I breathe a sigh of relief (not that it REALLY matters anyway) and kept reading.  "We've included some names of photographers that consistently get attention in both NYC and Los Angeles."   UM...NICK GRANITO is on the list folks!  My jaw about hit the ground!  I guess I did something right!  YAY!   Now let's see if it will net me any gigs.   yipes.

      KELLY IS CORRECT!  I forgot LIFEBOAT as one of the movies I saw in that 36 hour span this weekend.  DAMN!   BTW...LIFEBOAT is amazing!  It is a classic with Tallulah Bankhead and it is wonderful.   And...LOL...Kelly...I love that little motorcycling emoticon in the guestbook.  I died laughing when I saw it.    X-(  That is me dead.

      Hi all.  So far today has been a bit better than yesterday.  I didn't get much more sleep than I did the night before, but I feel a little less zombie-ish that I did yesterday at this time.   So BIG news.  I got home yesterday to find my headshots waiting in the mailbox for me!  I ran into the house, sat at the table, had a minor panic attack and opened the envelope.  Inside were two of the best pictures I have ever seen of myself!  I was ELATED.  They both came out exactly like I wanted and I was actually a little suprised at how well the touch ups look.  The pictures are a lot brighter, more clear, and I just about love them to death.  I am very proud.  I prayed so desperately for these to be good and whether or not anyone else likes them in the world...I do.  They give me confidence and they are surely a perfect start to my "career".  Gosh...I can't wait until the day when I can say my "career" and mean it seriously.  Thank you to everyone for getting me through this whole process.  Without you I would have had about 17 mental breakdowns and surely one of them would have destroyed me.  Especially you Rita.  You have convinced me that I am in fact NOT bald.  :-D I am hungry.  And I haven't taken a shit since dinner last night.  Where the hell did all that bullshit go?  Hopefully right to my ass.  I definitely need that. So we had a GREAT TIME last Friday at Ian's party.  The night started off on a rough note (see Saturdays entry for explanation), but ended so well.  Rita and I made some new friends and SHMOOZED like it was nobody's business.  I drank red wine all night and it was goooood.  So good in fact that I spilled a glass of it all over my new pants.  Kelly and Rita spent the entire weekend trying every trick in the book to get the stain out and nothing worked.  White wine does not always get out red wine.  Salt water does not always get out red wine.  Shout wipes can fuck off forever.   I met (well...actually second time I met) this guy Rick that night.  He is sorta cute.  Older, which I like, nice body, but way too small for my tastes, and so fucking pushy that I think he wanted me to knock him out.  He was all over my shit.  I explained to him over and over about Paul and he wouldn't let up.  Everyone was smoking my cigarettes and Rick left to walk his friend to the subway, only to return with a pack of cigarettes for me.  Mind you, he smoked none of them earlier.  He kissed me over and over and I just sat there trying to escape.  He tried to be sweet, telling me all this bullshit, but the moment was over when he grabbed my dick through my pants.  FUCKING ASSHOLES.  Someone please tell me WHY gay men do this to other gay men???  This is the second time this has happened to me with douchebags.  I lose EVERY OUNCE of respect for a guy when he does that.  It's not funny and by the way...get your fucking hand off my dick...which you would never get to touch in any case.  UGH.  So Rick...33 year old idiot. Needless to say, I will not be asking Rick to hang out ever in my lifetime.  And if he calls me at work (unfortunately he has my work number through Ian), I will be explaining to him how men with no class can go shopping for boys on the corner.   This bitch got class.  One really good thing that happened at the party... I met this girl named India.  (yes all of the gay men at the party sang "Thank you India" to her over and over---and yes,it was superbly annoying)  India proceeds to tell me that I am "gorgeous" and makes my night with her sweetness.  She was really great.  Turns out that she works as an assistant casting director.  She told me that a good friend of her "Lamont" is a casting director for  As the World Turns .   As soon as I get my reprints done, I will be sending her my resume/pic/cover letter.  HOW AMAZING!   It's one direction to pursue.  That's for sure.  She said that Lamont will "love me".  Meaning he will want me to suck his dick. Baright. No problem there. Just as long as he doesn't grab my dick through my pants.  THAT is just unclassy. After the party, Kelly, Rita and I went home to hang at the house and to talk. It was an amazing night.  I had so much fun.  It's nice not to have expectations for things, cuz then when it turns out good...the whole night is a BLAST!   K...think that is it for now.  Latas.

      Well, it is one of those days.  You know those days, when there is nothing to look forward to and you hate everything for no reason.  I must admit...it could be a Monday thing.  I hated last Monday too so maybe I am catching on to something.  That's it.  No more Mondays at work.  Mondays are meant to be spent in bed and staring at the wall. Oddly enough, I feel as though I hate Mondays more than I hate Sundays.  At least with Sundays you don't have to pretend that it is a shitty day.  And you get to sleep late.  Sundays ain't so bad in comparison. I miss Paul tremendously today.  I just wrote him a letter explaining how much I love him and miss him.  I feel like he doesn't hear either of those two things enough from me.  He needs to. I leave for vacation in a month and two days.  ROCK.  I really can't wait.  Plus...my birfday is next week and that is pretty cool.  Pretty cool cuz it will be a very long weekend taken by me.  We have off both July 4th and the 5th.  Our boss was incredibly cool for letting that happen.  Don't say he never gave us anything.  ;) I am so tired today.  Slept for about 4 and a half hours.  It was so sweaty and muggy in my room last night.  I basically laid on top of the fan and even that was of no use. Rita tells me to put the fan in my window.  It's worth a try.  Doing that the minute I go into my room tonight. I was just thinking about Kyle from the Real World.  Just sitting here and thinking about him.  Who does that?   He is the only straight guy that I have come across that acts like such a catty bitch.  He really is a piece of shit.  What was I ever thinking when I fell in love with him a couple months ago.  Not only has he become the ugliest face on tv...his personality makes it almost impossible for him to be human.  If you missed last weeks Real World episode, it will be on again at 9:30pm tomorrow night.  Watch it.  The way he and Kera act will allow you to get out any sort of misplaced anger.  Direct it right at these two monsters.  They are beasts.  No...worse then beasts.  They are ugly inside and out.  And pussies.  They are DEFINITELY pussies. In 36 hours this weekend, I watched the following movies: Monster's Ball Legally Blonde Black Hawk Down The Truth About Cats and Dogs Scream 3 Damn.  That's quite a lot of movies huh?  If you think about it...that is 10 hours of movies in 36 hours.  And I must have slept and ate at some point too, right? I definitely recommend each and every one of the movies I saw.  They were all entertaining, some intense, others ridiculous, but most of all...relaxing. Alright.  I think that be it for today.   Basically didn't want a day to go by without writing.  But it might have been better off if I did.  This entry even put me to sleep.

      So probably for the first time in my blogger history I am writing about something that happened to me tonight that affected me in a really emotional way.  I am actually using this blogger as a way to get out some of the feelings that I have since Paul was really of no use.  (wasted...and saying the total wrong things.  I politely got off the phone) Rita and I were riding the bus to Ian's party from Queens.  The bus picks us up at the subway stop and proceeds over the Triborough and into Harlem...125th Street.  The bus fills up and Rita and I are bullshitting.  This black guy with a gigantic laundry bag walks by Rita and I, hitting me in the leg with the laundry bag to which we both make eye contact and nod...no problems, and puts it on the seat next to Reets.   Rita and I continue to laugh and talk when suddenly...and I mean SUDDENLY, this guy starts yelling in a very loud voice"You are a FAG dude.  You are flirting with her and you're a fag.  FAG FAG FAG FAG FAG..."  I have no idea what was coming out of his mouth at that point.  Without ever once making eye contact with me, this guy yelled to everyone on the bus any and every possible derogatory comment imaginable.  The entire time I sat there quietly looking at him in shock.  Luckily...the other people on the bus (nationalities mixed) were looking at me in the eye and giving me the "He's crazy/I'm sorry you are dealing with this look".  That helped a bit.  For about 5 solid minutes, this guy took ZERO breaths and yelled to the bus that I was a fag mother fucker gay boy liar fag something whatever.  It was the scariest 10 minutes of my life.   I go through every day feeling safe.  In a city this size, I walk down the streets with my head held high and my self esteem booming.  In the blink of an eye someone can change that entire outlook.  I've been lucky.  I have never had a problem here.  But now... This has shaken me up a bit.  I sit here, after the night is all over and it is 4:30am, and I am scared.  I am choked up and I am embarrassed.  If I ever thought that I could escape my past, tonight was proof that it will always remain in my concious.   Tonight was a challenge that without Rita I would not have overcome.  I wanted to be strong and I was.  I am pretty impressed with how gracefully I handled it.  I was in shock.  And thank God it was Rita.  I didn't feel embarrassed in front of her.  I felt safe next to her.  I felt loved and understood.  I said to both Kelly and Rita tonight that I couldn't imagine dealing with that with someone other than them.  Even Penelope...I couldn't do it.  It is such a humbling and humiliating moment and I always worry that the other person is going to be embarrassed of me.   I went through 3 years of highschool fearing everything.  Based on these experiences I couldn't even walk to refill my glass in the dining hall without fear of someone laughing, pointing, or saying something that would crush me.  Up until I came out at the age of 21 did the shit stop.  I lived and survived 8 years of pure torment.  It started in 8th grade and didn't finish until Senior year.  (the first senior year)  :) I have risen above this.  I have to understand that this happens.  I was too comfortable and I needed my world shaken up.  We all have to be careful here.  You girls especially.  Shit goes wrong way too easily.   I will move past this and eventually it will be as though it never happened.  But for now...I am a little wiser, a little more aware, and stronger in my faith in God than I have ever been. It is through him that we get tested, but not destroyed.   What a night.

      IT'S FRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIDAY!   ROCK. Siffle and Olly Rock! This week, although not a bad week was a SLOW week.  It crawled like molasses.  And I hate molasses.  I can't believe I get to sleep in for two whole days in a row.  I can't wait to stay up super late tonight to watch movies, be wasted, and masturbate masturbate masturbate.  I just love tugging on my dick sometimes.  Feels kinda good. So last night I had a wonderful time with Penelope.  We laughed, drank, played games, acted liked lunatics...ok...I acted like a lunatic and smoked about 1000 bongs. Thank you for that P.  (I have been out of pot for a couple days now and I was JUH JONSING last night)  I kept being like "wanna pack it again?...no really...pack it again."  Who the hell do I think I am? She was so generous as always.  We also spoke about some Paul related issues to which she gave some incredible insight as to the fight I had with him the other day.  This girl has got wisdom.  I have said it before and I will say it again. She teaches me new things every time I sit and talk with her.   I only smoked 4 cigarettes yesterday.  YAYAYAYAYAY. lie.  I smoked about 4 every 15 minutes.  But they tasted so good!  YAYAYAYAYAAYAYAY Want to hear something really strange?  Yesterday when I was in the park I saw a squirrel with a bright green tail.  It was bushy and green.  Um.  I thought maybe he dipped it into paint by accident. eh...lying about this too. never happened. Truthfully though...and this IS true...I was in Urban Outfitters last week and Mariah goes:  "JOE...do not make a scene, but turn around and look who is standing behind you."  I do and see no one.  Then Mariah goes: "Joe...it's Kelly from the Real World/Road Rules Challenge!  You know...with Danny!"  I BUGGED!  It was the first pseudo-famous person I have seen in the city.  I once saw the back of Natalie Portman's head, but she had lice and I don't like lice.  I stared at Kelly for about a thousand seconds and noticed that she was with a TALL, beautiful man.  It was quite the experience and THANKS to Mariah for pointing that one out.  Bitch didn't even really watch the show...and I watched it every week.  But I would never have recognized her.   Kelly...I read your sister's away message and it says: " Out to lunch w/gen & sons!... then 50 FOOT slip n' slidin!:-D!...lol....& then possibly to the Y...i*ll be home sumtime later. Love You~*  *" UM!  50 Foot Slip n slide!?!?!?!?!  LUCKY!  Why can't I go on a 50 ft. slip n slide???  I've been a good boy this week.  A really good boy.  Stupid slip n slide'n assholes. TONIGHT PARTY AT IAN'S!  It will prolly suck, but I am really excited about it.  Never get to go to parties.  And if it does in fact suck...I am grabbing Rita and Mariah's hands and bolting from the pad.  We will be up by work so we should be able to take the bus.  Wouldn't that be different and enjoyable?  I plan on having bottled water and coffee all night. Gotta lay off the booze. LOLOLOLOLOLOL in other news...my brother called me two days in a row.  It was AMAZING to talk to him.  Always is.  But today we talked for 3 minutes and I go "Ok winfield.  I don't know what else to say.  I'm just gonna go now."  He burst out laughing and was like "Fine. I will call you Sunday."  Good boy he is. Oh!  Here's a tidbit of information from our friend Penelope.   To place a 411 call free of charge.  Dial 555-5555.  No matter what area code you are in.   FUCKING AMAZING RIGHT!?  So no more bullshit charges for simple addresses.  Awesome. I have tested it out and it works.  Thank her yourself. Time to go have a smoke with P before she goes home.  Then it might be up to the 5th floor bathroom.  I got something brewing and it ain't a fucking potroast.  (unless potroast comes in liquid form)

      So I have to tell my blogging world something that happened as soon as I got into the office this morning. I opened my email account to find the most wonderful message from Paul. You see...yesterday...at the height of our huge arguement, we began sending mini emails back and forth. This is how the dialogue went: Paul:  "You hurt me so much.  You don't even realize it." Joe:  "Stop throwing things in my face.  I wouldn't hurt you if you consistently didn't hurt me." P:  "I don't want to talk about this anymore." J:  "Fine.  I get it." P:  "OH. I GET IT!" J:  "Go fuck yourself." (At this point I begin sending him message upon message (53 to be exact) to his cell phone with only the number "1" written in the body of the email) P:  "Stop with the baby 1's." J:  "Fuck you.  Leave me alone please." (He does leave me alone for a bit and then I write:) J:  " :(" P:  " :(  X  10000" J: " :(  X  100000000000000000infinity" J:  "Call me please" He then called and we had a short, but sweet conversation in which I got off very weird.  (I was still very upset and hurt) Last night I called him and left a message telling him that I loved him and that I missed him and hated fighting with him.  I also said how much I fucking hate this long distance bullshit because we can never make up properly. He never called back.  But this morning I came in to find this message in my inbox: Paul:  "Here i am home again. Without tu. Again. I love you. I love you X 9999 infinity."  Are we serious?  This is the reason I love this boy.  He is so thoughtful and sweet.  He took our conversation and turned it around into a beautiful thing.  He may not be able to offer me everything that I need in this relationship, but what he can give, he does.  BTW... "tu" means "you" in spanish.  The message warmed my heart and definitely has started my day out on a very postive note.  Any reminance of hurt that I had left over from yesterday has now been squashed.  I still feel bad about the anger and frustration that we slung at eachother, but it happens.  Thank God for Paul.   I love him so very much.

      It's so funny.  You spend all day acting like a lunatic and then suddenly it is 4pm and you are exhausted and bored out of your mind.  I don't understand it.  Now that I am not angry anymore...I have nothing left to contribute to this day.  I am so fucking BORED!  UGH!   I wanna go home now please.  Home forever!   Eh...maybe just until tomorrow.

      Just talked to Paul and he was amazing.  It doesn't take away the hurt and anger I am still feeling.  That will take some time.  However, I am a little comforted by the fact that he does love me so much.  I know I say it every five minutes, but let me say it again.  Being in a long distance relationship absolutely blows.  Conversations are always misinterpreted, fights get so out of hand, and there is never a chance for that beautiful make up sex.  Instead, both people walk away feeling empty and alone.  I know he is really lonely and hurt right now.  That hurts the most.  I don't want him to hurt.   NEVER EVER EVER EVER get into a long distance relationship folks.  They are impossible to make work.  No matter how much you try.  It will never be a full-fledge give and take until the two of you are in the same place.   It is an every day ache that can be dealt with, but never cured.  It is sad and it is difficult. This whole thing is so tough.

      Feel a little bit better having layed out in the park for an hour.  Getting some sun makes things just a little more tolerable. I love this kid so much that he makes me fucking crazy.  It is so hard to explain.  Ugh. I don't know.  So tired emotionally right now.  He takes a lot out of me.   I just want my vacation/bday/4th of July to go well.  It's just that everything is like pulling teeth with him.  And I hate the dentist.  What a long day.  I pray for it to be over.  Time to go back to bed and start over again tomorrow.

      UGH.  Dilemmas dilemmas.  I just spoke with Paul about the upcoming events in the next couple of months.  We spoke about my birthday/4th of July and a weekend trip with the girls of 56B.  (we are hoping and desperately trying to plan a weekend in the poconos or something)  The weekend with the girls is supposed to be with boyfriends.  I asked Paul if he would accompany me there and he immediately said "no, I don't want to".  He is like "I don't know any of those people and I am not going".  Fucking figures.  Why should he ever make a sacrifice like this for me?  Whatever.  I will still go without him.  It embarrasses me, but there is still time for him to change his mind.  And if he doesn't....eh...I'll cheat on him.  That will make me feel better.  :-D I don't know what to do for my birthday and 4th of July.  No one has really mentioned anything to me yet and Paul is of no help.  He would LOVE for me to come to Boston on the 4th and wants me to stay through the weekend so that he can work the whole time and leave me stranded in the apartment.  Sounds like a plan.  YEAH FUCKING RIGHT.  I am NOT spending my long 4th of July weekend sitting on an ugly orange sectional couch cooped up in the fucking living room alone.  Never gonna happen. So as of this moment...I will not be going to Boston.  OH!  And want to know the real kicker? Paul is like..."I am coming to NYC on June 28th and staying through July 3rd."   At first I am like "Great!  You will be here for my birthday!" Then I realize what he is saying. Paul is going to come down for a 3 day visit in NYC during which I won't even be here.  I am thinking he is coming down for gay pride with Mariah.  So I realize that he can't take off the long 4th of July weekend to be with me because he will be taking those other days off to hang with Mariah in NYC - when i am not even here!  Real fucking nice. It's my fucking birthday.   So fine.  If this is the "game" we are going to play, I will probably just go home for the 4th.  Or maybe to Syracuse with Ritza.  I mean really.  I am not going to bend over backwards for shit with him anymore.  He can do what he wants and I surely will be doing what I want. Annoying.  Frustrating and annoying. This long distance thing fucking blows. In other news...I am having beans and rice for dinner.  It is my new obsession and I cant wait.  Kind of sad, huh? When Rita and I got home yesterday, I walked in to find my free cd's sitting in my foyer.  ROCK!  I can't believe it!  I was so excited.  I screamed like a woman and immediately ran and put them in my stereo.  I blared music for hours.  Then when Scott and Rita got home, we played The Simpsons Clue game and then a quick round of Pictionary.  It was pretty damn fun.  Rita won The Simpson's Game, but that might only be because Kelly wasn't there.  I think there may be a tournament of champions coming.   Sooooooooooooo hungry.  So hungry and yeah...real hungry.   All I want is Burger King and all I can't have is Burger King.  I am really trying to cut this shit out before my vacation...but who knows.  As Paul said so kindly last weekend, while looking at me with my shirt off,  "Are you going to be comfortable with your shirt off at the beach?" Oh God.  Go fuck yourself asshole. (It was mildly humerous at the time, but now...it's just plain hurtful and obnoxious.  I mean...do I sit there and tell him he should be uncomfortable to show his nasty mug in public?  And by mug...I mean fucking idiot face.) I hate him right now.   It'll pass...probably even by lunch...but for right now...I hate. I want so badly to give a Real World recap from last night, but it might have to wait a few days.  It was an exceptionally frustrating and wonderful episode.  I gotta give you peeps a chance to catch it.  You won't be disappointed! The more I looked at the blown up headshots last night...the more I loved them.  They really grew on me.  I think that maybe I'm not bald afterall.  Maybe I can still play fun, young characters.  Maybe I won't have to play Telly Savalas's twin in my first breakout role.  Well...it IS just a maybe. Yesterday, on the way down the steps from the subway...I saw this kid that I knew from growing up.  His name is Jerry and my brother and I used to spend 2 weeks every summer with them while we were growing up.  They have a summer house, next door to my granny, and it is on Oneida Lake.  It is a beautiful lake and we would go tubing, fishing, swimming, boat racing, etc every summer.  We were very fond of Kick the Can.  It was the best summers ever!  I loved it.  But then I grew up and didn't want to go anymore.  My granny used to make us drink the milk from our cereal bowls and that made me gag everytime.  We would walk downstairs to see our breakfast of cornflakes with sliced banana sitting on the table.  I would choke on my disgust and cover the bowl with tons of sugar when she wasn't looking.  Nowadays...I WISH I could have cornflakes with bananas.  But FUCK if I would ever drink the milk.  That shit will never be cool.  It will always be slimy and sick.   If you do in fact drink the milk from your cereal bowls...never tell me.  I will have to vomit right in your lap.   still hungry.   Hungarian that is. Don't know what else to write, but don't feel like not writing.  Just want to type and type until the frustration with Paul dissipates.  I am not the innocent one in the scenario.  I am a prick and very difficult to deal with.  It's just that I HATE this long distance nonsense.  It would be fine if he had to work on July 5th if we were both in NYC.  I would just hang with someone else.  But when in Boston...I am forced to either see people I don't feel like seeing or sitting in his creepy apartment with his new boring roommate.  It's not entirely his fault.  The part about coming to NYC to spend gay pride with Mariah and using up his free time with her and not me will always chap my ass, OK He just called and tried to make it better, but I wasn't having it.  I hate him right now. I don't want anything to do with him and now I definitely don't want to write anymore. Time to go stew.

      Well...I just walked in from lunch.  During my break I went to the studio to pick the two shots I liked the best.  I was a little suprised at how they turned out.  They are good...but I just get nervous.  They hadn't been retouched yet, so I hope that that helps.  The pictures are definitely not bad.  But I am balding!  Can someone have a talk with my scalp and tell it to stop it immediately.  I mean this is ridiculous.  There aren't many roles out there for 18 year old bald kids!  Well some...but that is just cancer patients and AIDS babies.  I don't want to be a cancer ridden AIDS baby.  :( Whatever....when I got back with the pics...everyone was like..."ooh" and "ahh" and "I don't like them".  My boss, Teef, didn't like the way the pictures were taken, and that shook me up a bit.  And they saw the ones I DIDN'T pick.  If I show anyone the ones I DID pick and they say the same thing...I will probably crawl into a hole and evaporate.   I should have gotten my haircut again before the pics.  The spikes on the top of my head make me look bald.  But whatever.  It's over and I can't worry about it anymore.   I am just going to be confident in the fact that it is over.  I have waited to years to get these bald headed pics...now I just have to go out there and audition audition audition. I want this so badly! Almost time to go home. And buy Rogaine!

      That pizza sure hit the spot.  The spot in my lower intestines.  OH UGH GOTTA GO! Instead of going to the park, I am quickly running to Nick's studio to decide on two of the four headshots he blew up.  I hope I can make it back to work in an hour.  It will be a close one.   I am so fucking nervous about these pics.  I have spent a GREAT deal of money and I really need them to turn out well.  They are supposed to save my life.  And what if they don't?   I prayed on them last week.  I asked God to please bless them and make them what I need.  I hope my prayer goes through. Pray that my prayer goes through, k?  K. K (now I wear white hoods and believe in white supremacy) never. always. adios.

      Pretty great day so far.  The weather is beautiful, the co-workers have been pre-occupied, and it is already 1:15pm!  ROCK. Penelope is out sick today.  Out sick getting a new love seat!!  Amazing.  I can't wait to see it.  She has been so excited to get it and the day has finally arrived.  Oooh...!  I know she is having a good day.  :-D So folks...did we catch the new  urlLink Road Rules ?  It is season 11 and of course it is wonderful!  The cast is really great.  They seem like really nice, very young, totally watchable people.  There is a gay guy and a lesbian.  The gay guy is pretty cool so far and the lesbian is not only beautiful...she is cool as fuck.  Kelly...you will LOVE her...I call it now.   And of course...I have a new boyfriend.  His name is   urlLink Eric  and he is so fucking adorable, I don't know what to do with myself.  Besides being beautiful, he has an incredible sense of humor and is so open minded and cool.  Within the first 15 minutes of the premiere, he is fully making out with Kendall (the girl hottie on the show).  He totally likes her and the bitch has "too many emotional scars" to deal with him.  SNORE.  Cuz this kid is a FIND!  The gay guy, Shane, jokes about hearing Kendall and Eric making out and Eric is like "Shane, why don't you come up here and cuddle with us?".  Shane does and it is so fucking amazing, I almost jizzed right on myself.  I want to cuddle with Eric.  Why didn't he ask me?!?!?! Please start watching.  I am going to need people to discuss this season with.  It's gonna be a good one! Last night, I got home and hung with Rita and her boyfriend Scott for awhile.  I had a glass or two of wine with them and watched some Fear Factor.  Scott is a great guy and makes me laugh every time we have a conversation.  Also, he is so sweet and polite in the morning and it is a pleasure to bump into him when coming back from the shower.  He has a heart of gold.  Rita has been overjoyed to have him in the house.  As of July 1st, he will be living with us for at least a month.  I am happy about it.  Be nice to have another guy in the house.  As long as he remembers who is queen.   So, supposedly there is a picture of Mike Piazza almost naked in the post today.  I guess he did a photo shoot for  Women's Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue .  A bunch of athletes did.  I have looked all over the paper and have yet to find the pic.  If you or someone you know has any idea where this pic could be...email it to Joe ASAP.  I am dying to see him with his shirt off.  Is it fat?  Is it muscle?  Is it just plain the best thing ever?  Probably. Last night for dinner, I made Rice and Beans.  Now rice and beans has no need for capitals, but last night it did.  It was so fucking good.  Rita told me what spices to use and boy was she right.  I scarfed.  Rita and Scott went to KFC to get dinner and brought me back biscuits.  I scarfed those too.  YUM.  Motha fuckin yum.  I might have rice and beans again tonight.  It was THAT good. I was supposed to hang with Mariah tonight, but those plans fell through.  I invited her to go to this housewarming party with me on Friday.  This guy I work with, Ian, is throwing a bash and I feel as though we should all go.  If anyone reading this wants to go too, let me know.  The more the merrier.  Or at least the less uncomfortable. Going to the park on lunch today.  Time for baby to get a tan.  Well, time for baby to continue working on getting a tan.  Florida is almost here and I am palest.  Well not palest by any means...but nowhere near what I need to be.  It's pretty cold in here.  My nipples just packed their bags and took the elevator out of here.   Thanks a lot nipples.  Fucking bastards leaving me at the worst time.  My baby is hungry for some milk! I just ordered a slice of pizza.  Am I fucking serious?  I had a slice yesterday.  And I had it for dinner on Sunday.  And I had it last Friday.  This is turning into a full blown obsession.  I am embarrassed, down on myself, and TOTALLY EXCITED FOR IT TO GET HERE.  This bitch is starving! This is me eating my pizza:    :-O :-X :-O :-X :-D - yum  now to eat it for real......................

      So although my mood has ranged from elated to annoyed today, the time has flown by and it is almost time to go home. Rock.  This weekend was pretty great.  There were a few problems with Paul on Friday, but nothing that wasn't easily worked out.  He will just never be allowed to drink alcohol in my presence again.  Pretty easy thing to do. Saturday with Rita and Kelly was great.  Sunday's pizza for dinner idea was amazing!  Thanks to Rita for that!  I can still feel it sitting in the depths of my bowels...but it was oh so good.  As though pizza could ever not be good. If I was Mike Piazza, I would change my name to Mike Pizza.  But that is just me. There was a board meeting today that everyone I worked with had to go to. Snore. Hoobastank plays on my Launch Player alot.  I like when they play. Today my glands hurt on my neck.  I assume they are glands.  If they are tumors...then they can just deal with that...cuz I do not have the time. fucking phone is ringing. So Paul got a second job.  He will be assisting in an office for 20 hours a week at $15 an hour.  I am very proud of him for securing this job.  He got it through Mariah's ex-boss.  He does need office experience and this will help him with that a bit.  He has no idea how to use a computer and maybe this job will assist him with that too. But...and of course there is always a but.... :( I don't want him to get another job.  He barely has enough time to come visit now and with this new job....(big sigh) I want him to move here.  Well, today I do.  We have been talking a lot about it over the last couple of months and we are just about there.  He will do it, I think.  There is an opening in Mariah's apartment that he could fill.  Unfortunately he would have to fill it by the end of July.  That may be too quick.  There is another girl named Jen, who is pretty cool, that is moving from Boston to NYC at the end of the summer.  This idea seems a lot more probable, cept Paul would rather live with Mariah then with Jen.  Who wouldn't? So I don't know.  I miss him alot today.  I want him to be here so that after work, I can just go to his apartment and climb into bed with him.  We can go to movies, plays, dinner, and the such, with no pressure of making sure to get enough "alone" time in. So fucking frustrating.  Trying to be patient about it all, cuz I have to be.  Yet, the decision is his and I must let him make the decision on his own.   In other news... No other news...not in the mood to write anymore. Gonna go research more information about my vacation!  YAYAYAYAY!

      HI WINFIELD, if you are reading this.  I am so glad that you will be able to see this now!   I love you and call me soon! Going to turn in my headshots right now and absolutely terrified.  Which fucking picture do I fucking pick?  I am so confused. After having all of my friends look at them and even me staring at 8 sheets of proofs for hours...I not only think that I am the ugliest guy on the planet...I think that I am halfway balding and have skin made of rubber. No matter. There are tons of parts out there for gay men with rubber face and no hair. P.s.  Kudos for Kelly for being the only one who knew what "Rubber Face" was when I asked the question a couple of weeks ago. Wish me luck today!

      5 minutes until work is over and 5 minutes until I get to see my boyfriend.  I love him and I am very excited.  I think we might go to a movie or out to dinner.  He was in a bad mood on the phone when he called and hopefully that is how he will be all night.  :( Whatever...he is allowed...I just want us to have a nice visit. YAY!  Weekend is almost here!   Right around the corner. Much...MUCH better day at work today.  Thank the Lord for small pleasures. I had California Rolls today.  8 of them.  Rita and I got them for lunch.  Um.  By the way...I LOVE THEM!   And I got so full while I was eating them.  Rita housed them like the house she is.  :-D She was like..."Just push through Joe...keep eating them.  You will be hungry in 10 minutes." And guess what?  The girl knows her stuff.  I am starving again right now and I just ate 3 hours ago. Time to go eat something healthier...as in Pizza laden with French Fries and gravy.  I may add a little melted chocolate to the top to make it go down a little more smoothly. Have a great night folks!

      Wow what a day.  If you ask Penelope, I think that we could justifiably say that this was the worst day we have ever had at work.  However it all turned out okay.  And you know why?  Because she and I have a friendship that knows no bounds.  Let me just take a moment and say that I love this girl.  No matter what happens at work, she and I have always found a way for our friendship to survive.  And we will continue to do so.   She is a good girl.  I cherish every moment, conversation, and obstacle we face.   I love you P.  I love you dearly.

      Okay...one more thing.  (I can't stay off this thing today) I just messed around with my AIM setups.  I gave most of my friends "buddy icons" that match their personality.  For example...Jessica is a flower (based on Lotus), Mariah is "Tweet" (the singer), and so on and so forth. However, the best one I assigned was for Angie, Kelly's ex-girlfriend.  I made her "Slytherin" from Harry Potter.  I am dying laughing at my own little joke.  If you have seen the movie, you will understand why Slytherin is so damn funny.  Even if you haven't seen the movie, you can understand why SLYTHERIN could be funny.  Slither like snakes, memble? Eh...it was funny to me.

       urlLink Fun and could be true   So I just took another test to find out who I was in my past life and this is what it said:  Diagnosis: --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  You were a guy in your last earthly incarnation. You were born in the middle of Montreal, Quebec around 1075. You were a undertaker. You dealt with dead things.. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A bit about your past-life persona: You had a huge personality and were well-liked by everyone. People often sought your advice. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The lesson that your past life has brought to the present: You are bound to solve problems with pollution of environment, recycling, misuse of raw materials, elimination of radioactivity by all means including psychological methods. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Now this is the second time that I have found out that I was an Undertaker in my past life.  Is there anyway this could be true?   It would explain why I have such a fear of people dying around me.  Losing someone I love is something that plagues me every five minutes of every day.  I obsess over it without control.  If you know me, you know I deal with this.  So is it possible that this is because of what I saw and did in the past?  Huh.  Interesting to think about.

      So I gotta real problem.  I am in love with every new teenage female artist.  You remember the Michelle Branch phase and then the Vanessa Carlton phase and now....(drumroll please), my new favorite is  urlLink Avril Lavigne .  Please feel free to check her out.  (And remember...you heard about her here first!)  Her debut song is called  Complicated  and it is pretty great.  It is fun, light, and catchy.  Plus...this girl seems to be more of a rocker than the other two.  And to top it off, she is actually hot.  Member when I thought Vanessa was hot and then she turned out to be beast?  Michelle is not ugly...just a little off somehow.  But Avril...welcome to my life.  The song is good and she seems cool, even if she is only 17.    In my next life I want to be a teenage female rockstar.  They have the most fun.

      I just love my mother.  Is it weird or unacceptable to love her this much?  Probably, but I don't care.  It is like every time we hang out we get closer and closer.  When I hugged her goodbye last night I felt like we were both going to start crying.  It is just so intense.  I wish that she and my dad could live closer to me.  I told her this last night.  I would love to get together for dinner with them or meet up for a movie or just sit around and have some wine and talk.  I can't get enough of them and each time we DO get together it goes by so quick and then it's goodbyes.  I hate goodbyes. Last night I ran to pick up my headshots and then I jetted over to the Crowne Plaza where my mom was staying.  We poured over the headshots together and she picked her favorite ones.  (I have to admit that with over 100 different shots, 75% of them were so damn ridiculous that I couldn't stop laughing.  Laughing with an embarrassed face.)  After this, we went to the upper east side and did some shopping.  She threw out her lower back earlier in the week so she has been experiencing some pain whenever she walks.   :(   But she wanted to shop and that we did. After this we went back to 42nd and walked around for a bit.  Ultimately we ended up at this diner called Stardust's.  It is a 50's style diner where the waitresses sing while they wait on you.  No.  Seriously.  It was: "Hi, my name is Kerry and I will be your waitress." (Pause to sing a line from Phantom of the Opera) "What would you like to drink?" (Pause to sing another line) In the beginning I had a very hard time keeping a straight face.  I mean...they were waiting on tables and singing into microphones.  I loved it!  And I decided that this will be the restaurant that Mariah will work in.  She says that she wants to wait tables.  I feel that with her experience and knowledge of the food industry, a diner really works best for her.  AND YOU GET TO SING DURING THE WHOLE SHIFT!  Perfect for her. The food was great.  (what diner food isn't?) After dinner we walked around a bit more and then went back to her hotel room.  We talked for a bit and then I said goodbye.  :( The last two days with her have been very special and I thank God for my relationship with her.  She is the person I love the most in my life.  She is everything. I paid off the rest of the vacation with her.  I also gave her money for the father's day gift I got my dad.  In total: $236.  Yikes.  Really yikes.  Like I even come close to having that money.  Oh well.  At least the vacation is paid for now.  All I gotta do is save up some spending cash.  Thank GOD I opened that savings account.  Otherwise...I would really be in the whole. After getting home I watched the Real World and then Kelly Osbournes' "Making the Video".  Love the girl, but she is a little cheesy.  Ok..a lot cheesy and I am thinking that this girl will be a one hit wonder.  Well that is if Madonna won't let her use any more songs.   But the REAL WORLD!  Oh man this show just keeps getting better and better.  A full flege war has been waged between Tonya and Kera.  Please catch the repeat to see what I mean.  And next week!?!?!?!  DAMN GOIL!  This shit be goin down! Tomorrow Paul comes into town to stay for a couple of days.  I can't believe how much I miss him already.  I have seen him so much lately, but it never seems to be enough.  I can go a good 3 days without feeling sad, but after that...it gets kind of hairy.   Ugh.  The life and times of a long distance relationship.  Does this upset ever go away?  Nope.  Definitely not. Remind me to never do this long distance thing again, ok?  It doesn't feel so good. So I woke up this morning to find 3 half naked boys in my living room.  Well isn't THAT a beautiful early morning present!  Loved it! I sat with Kelly for a bit and talked about her night.  Sounds like her and Rita had quite the evening.  Drinks and a show and fun!  Good for them.  Well good for Rita.  Kelly gets wasted every night now.  lol.  Check out her diary to see.   Also, on the subway this morning I saw an old woman's panty covered vagina.  Enough said. And on my out of the house this morning I heard fuckface, Angie's roommate, coming down the stairs.  I quickly went back in to the house to wait for him to leave.  I even took a different route to the subway, but of course I ran into him on the platform.  We said not a word to eachother.  Just looked and moved on.  Phew.  I didn't want to have slap his fag face so early in the morning.  :-D Alright...on to work.  I have already killed a good 20 minutes by sitting her and typing away.   ROCK.

      Wow.  Well good for me.  I actually got this huge project finished today.  I was convinced that it would ride over until tomorrow.   But nope! (insert golf claps here) I failed to mention in my last, ridiculous entry that I received my plane tickets for Florida yesterday!   YAYYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYSNARF!  I am so excited.  Want to hear something embarrassing?  (Sure Joe) I sat and read every detail on the tickets and brochures.  Then a tear slipped out of my eye and fell on my leg.  No joke. The reason for this is simple: I have never been on a real vacation without my family.  This is such a huge step in me becoming an adult.  I can't believe that I am almost 25 and have never done anything like this before.  In the past it meant nothing to me to do this.  Now...it's all I think about.  For a whole week Paul and I are going to be attached at the hip.  Loving eachother, fighting with eachother, kissing and hugging eachother, (maybe even fucking eachother by that point).  It's pretty unbelievable.  I don't have to share him with anyone for a week and he won't have to share me.   I spent almost my whole day at work yesterday printing out information about things to do while we are in Orlando.  I found some gay clubs for us to go to.  I ordered this $10 coupon/brochure kit that is based out of Kissimmee.  (Kissimmee is 5 minutes from where we are)  The kit has over $3500 worth of coupons/free passes to places, etc.  It will give us some idea as to what else to do while we are there.  Also it will hopefully save us some money.  (And the kit comes with a free t-shirt, so how could I NOT order it?) I also ordered a free Disney Vacation planning video.  The tickets to the theme parks are very expensive and I figure the video will give us an idea as to what parks we want to go to.  We ain't doin em all...cuz that would cost just under $500.  Uh what?   Disney...you be robbin me blind.   I am more excited for Universal though.  I definitely want to do both of the parks they have there. Also, I talked to my mom last night about renting a car for when we are down there.  She can score me a phatty deal and then we will have it for the whole week!  Aren't moms the best?  I just love her.  She is making this vacation turn into the most amazing experience of my life. She is so good to me. So that's the vacation update. Now lets discuss RENT for a minute.  First off...I think it was Roger and Angel's first performance.  Not only did Roger absolutely suck to the point of embarrassment (no...I am fucking serious...he was ugly/had horrible pitch/and no stage presence whatsoever...yikes), Angel was also not good at points and OK at other points.  At the end of the show when they show the video on the wall...both the old Roger and Angel (from when Paul and I saw it a couple months ago) were in it.  They should beg those two to come back and boot these amateurs.   Manley Pope was the old Roger...and YUM!  Also, I don't know if you memble or not, but the old Angel hit on me outside of the show last time.  As soon as I saw his face in the video, I about melted all over again.  Damn he was cute.   And not too feminine...in real life that is.  The first act of the show was really off.  My mom actually said to me, at intermission, "Doesn't this seem like a college performance?"  I burst out laughing and said "Yes mom...yes."  Thank God she has seen it before.   The second act was SLAMMING!  I burst into tears during Tom Collins song...as always...but this guy did it (as Rita said earlier) Mary J. Blige style.  He screamed the ending and I sat there with my breath having been taken away.  It was so wonderful. They really got their act together during the second half and I was so relieved for that. I would LOVE to see the show again tonight if I had a billion dollars.   Or maybe if I have $50 that would work too. I didn't get home until really late.  My room looks like shit and I was exhausted.  Gotta catch up on rest and clean my shit up.  Paul will be here and my room stinks of STANK!  Plus I gotta do laundry and damn I got a lot to do.  Does it ever end??? Alright...I think that is it for today.  I hope everyone is enjoying the weather.  It is fucking so beautiful and toasty.  Stop complaining you babies.  Summer is a time for smiles and tans.  Well at least tans, ok? Hi Jeannie!  Are you still reading?  I miss you and love you!  Come see us again soon, k?   I will rest my voice before you get here so that my RENT performance will be up to par. PEAYCE!

      Easy day today.  Very quiet and nobody has bothered me.  A little busy this morning, but then people just kind of disappeared.  Thank the goodness of the Lord.   I went to the park on my lunch break and got some more color on these bones of mine.   My mission: To become black/African American/maybe Red Cherokee Indian this summer by exposing myself to as much sunlight as possible.  I want dark and I want it now.  Wish me luck folks!   Like anyone is wishing me luck on looking beautiful.  :-D

      Welcome back to Joe!   Man...it feels like I have been gone for years.  I left work last Thursday, miserable with my sinus nonsense and then ended up having the most random, yet exciting weekend ever.   I took last Friday off from work to recuperate and cure the massive sinus infection that seemed to be brewing in my face.  In my mind, I was going to stay home all weekend and sleep.  Pretty boring, but pretty fun at the same time.  Instead, however, I made the spontaneous decision to up and go to Boston on Friday.  Mariah and I took the Chinatown bus together and it only cost $40 roundtrip.  Needless to say, the bus was rather sketchy and in fact, wasn't a bus at all.  It was like one of those handicapped busses that pick people up for highschool or something.  But for $40...it was worth it.  Upon arrival in Boston, Mariah, Paul and I went shopping, got my haircut, went tanning and out to dinner.  We then proceeded to get ourselves all dolled up to go out to the bars for Gay Pride!  (Gay Pride in Boston was this weekend - NYC's is at the end of the month) We hung out with Mariah's girlfriend Marissa and met up with some other people once we got out.  I had a blast and met the man of my dreams.  Not Paul.  (ha. Ha. oops)  I was very behaved, but totally wouldn't have been had Mariah not been there to keep me in check.  We hopped around a couple bars when Paul pulled me aside and told me that he just wanted to go home and hang out with me.  (jnsert "awww...." here)   He and I went back to the apartment and had a seriously GOOD time.  We talked about so much shit, we made meatballs, and we made mad passionate love.  In fact, we made mad passionate love 4 times in 36 hours.  Damn.  May be a new record for us.   I met Paul's new roommate "Steve".  He was pretty great...not threatening at all.  In fact, I rather liked him.  His clothes...yikes.  But other than that...real nice guy.   Oh!  On Friday night, when Paul and I were hanging out...this guy "Geoff" called.  Geoff is one of Paul's hookups from when he and I were broken up.  In fact, it is the only guy that Paul has hooked up with since he and I have been together.  And the kid is a fucking scumbag.  So he calls Paul's phone and I think it is Mariah (she and Marissa spent the night at a hotel and were supposed to be calling us from the hotel phone).  I pick it up and proceed to play the "Who is this?" game with Geoff for like 3 minutes until he finally tells me who it is.  I was very calm and collected when I told him that if he really shouldn't be calling MY boyfriend and that he should be embarassed for calling.  (The kid won't leave my boyfriend alone)  I was vicious, yet mature, and I totally came out looking like a king.  Paul stood by me, holding my hand, saying thank you the whole time.  Geoff, apologized over and over for being a shitface and I gave him the final warning to never call again.  It was pretty invigorating and great.   Saturday, Paul, Mariah, and some friends of ours from TGIFriday's went to the Gay Pride Parade.  It was so wonderful to be there.  I went last year to Boston's parade and almost forgot how incredible it really is to be a part of such a huge event.  It is like the one day of the year that all gays get along with eachother.  Even on Friday night, we ran into some obnoxious gay people, but on Saturday morning...everyone was cheery and happy and helpful.  Weird how a parade will do that.  We hung out and ate some carnival style food and looked at random exhibits...then Paul had to go to work and I eventually made it back to his apartment to watch "The Mothman Prophecies" and "Harry Potter".  Both movies were fucking incredible.  Please see them ASAP. It was hard to say goodbye to Paul yesterday, but he is seriously considering coming down to visit again this Thursday.  I really hope so.  I still, after all this time, hate this long distance shit.  :( Tonight I am going to see Rent with my mom.  Tomorrow I am going out to dinner, drinks, and getting my headshots back with my mom.  Wednesday I sleep.  Thursday I hang out with Paul.  Friday, I go out to party.  Saturday I die.  I love the fact that I finally have a life and people to see.  It's been a LONG time coming and I feel like I have definitely earned the right to have things to do.  DEFINITELY.  lol.  Can't just sit in the apartment and complain anymore.  ;) But so tired I am all the time.   :-D - zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz I got some real color this weekend and a short haircut.  I am a brand new boy.   Loving life and happy.  Let's keep it that way.

      Another day another dollar, or some other bullshit. Today I have sinus problems like you wouldn't believe.  I feel like a monster truck ran over my face and left me in the wake of its destruction.  Also, I am feeling rather poetic.  Stuffed up and poetic.  A bard with a cold.   This should be a quick entry due to the fact that I don't have too much to say.  Also, I am tired and not in the mood to type for hours.  Last night Rita and I went to Mariah's apartment to hang out with her and Rachel.  During the day Rita and I were exhausted from the night before, but we knew we had to push through and do it up.  And that we did.  It was such a good time.  We just relaxed, had a little wine, ate pizza, and talked.  Rita couldn't stay over, so she left shortly after the Real World (10:30pm).  Mariah and Rachel were really worried about Rita going home by herself, but I knew she was tough and that if anyone fucked with her, she would have kicked their lilly ass.  She had a few minor subway annoyances on the way home, but made it there in one piece.   And then.... When she GOT home...lo and behold there was an adorable boy sitting on the couch waiting for her!  (OHHHHHHHHH!!!!) How fucking cute that he surprised her.  An extra night to be with her boy.  She is walking on sunshine today and I am so happy for her.  I screamed like a fucking girl when she called us and told us that he was there.  How wonderful. After Rita left, Mariah, Rachel and I sat around hysterically laughing at yearbooks and old photo albums.  Ironically enough, they know so many people from my home town.  We gossiped and shit ourselves over some of the stuff we found out about our mutual acquaintances.   The pizza was good too.  And actually, the pizza being good was the most important part of the evening.  Bad pizza leads to bad attitudes. LOL. Never. Mariah was so grateful and sweet to me for staying over.  Love her. And can you believe it???  I was on time this morning.  From Brooklyn!  Takes about an hour and 15 minutes to get to work from Mariah's place.  When I woke up at 6am this morning and couldn't fall back to sleep...I knew that I was going to be a zombie all day.  And lo and behold...I am Joe Zombie.  (Cousin of Joe Dirt)  Tonight is what God calls a "Day of Rest".  I am going home, climbing in bed, making some soup, and putting in a movie.  YAYAYAYAYAYAY! Makes me happy inside to think about it.  Makes me horny too.   And actually, makes me SICK TO MY FUCKING STOMACH!!! juxt kiddin zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz time to have a smoke

      What the fuck happened last night? Rita and I went out for a few simple drinks for Happy Hour with Mariah and Rachel at a beautiful bar called McAnn's.  Next thing we know, it is 4 hours and another bar later and we is wasted and wondering when it was that she and I became rockstars.  Usually it is bed at 7pm.  Last night it was bed at 1:30am.  Whoa.  (Said who-ah) What a great time we had.  Rita got to know Rachel and Mariah a little better.  We laughed, danced, drank thousands of drinks and even received a free round at McAnn's.  For no reason!  The waitress was the weirdest bitch to wait a table, however, she was super cool when she gave us free booze.  She also kept trying to shove Boof popcorn down our throats.  But we weren't having it.  After McAnn's, we walked up to Zanzibar and continued to get wasted and party out like it was a Friday night.   My favorite parts of the evening were as follows: 1)  Running into Penelope's roommate David.  How often do I see people I actually know in the city?  NEVER. 2)  Rita spilling her drink all over the table while it was completely full.  Then the waitress brings her a new one and doesn't charge her for it.  (Awwww.....) 3)  Doing the "stick-shift" driving dance move to the point of hysteria. 4)  Having moments with Mariah that make me love her even that much more. 5)  Chilling out with Rachel and making her my new best friend.  As I said last night "She is my new project". 6)  Buying new sunglasses!  I have never really owned sunglasses before.  I am SO NY now.   7)  The talks, both serious and not serious, that I had with each person I went out with. 8)  Coming home to see Kelly sitting on the steps wasted from drinking a bottle of red wine!   9)  Being social, happy, and comfortable with who I am and what I had to contribute to this brand new situation I was in.   What a great night.  Upon arriving at home, Kelly, Rita and I played in the backyard for a while.  Rita was wasted and spilled a glass of wine, broke a glass of wine, and ran around the backyard flying on her broomstick.  She was  Thoroughly Modern Millie .  After slamming myself in the face with a broomstick and Rita showing us fencing moves, it was time to go inside.  Unfortunately, Rita hid in the backyard, which if you have seen my backyard...there ain't many places to hide.  But she did a good job and it took about 20 minutes to get her lil' ass inside.   Once in the house, the three of us choreographed dance moves until about 12am and then crashed into our beds.  It was a fun and wonderful evening.   Today was a day of exhaustion, pizza, and nonsense.  I have done about 17 seconds of work all day.  I did play on IWON.com all day though.  I was convinced that I was about to win $10,000 and be able to pay off my massive debts.   Nope. But it was fun playing the different games. Fuck no it wasn't. I spoke with Paul last night and it was kind of a bad conversation.  He is miserable in Boston without Mariah.  I can tell.  He won't talk to me about it.  All he does is yell at me and tell me that I am fucking up or something.  I have been very patient with him and am trying to just take him venting cuz I know he needs that from me.  It is hard though.  Very difficult in fact.  He is merciless when it comes to ripping me a new asshole sometimes.  And usually for no reason too.  But whatever...the reason is his sadness and I am going to try to be the best boyfriend I can be. Things are going so well these days!  I feel really great.  I have some new friends in the city, my social life has perked way up, I have my Mariah here finally!, my headshots are done, the weather is beautiful, and WOW.  I am happy.  The usual bullshit that upsets me on a daily basis, although not gone for good, is being easily replaced by the fact that my life is changing and fast.  I feel like I am moving on to that next level and I am very excited about it.  As I have said over and over in this blogger, the rut that I have been in has been horribly painful and frustrating, but it is beginning to end.  I have high hopes for the future and for the direction in which my life is seeming to go.  This is what I have moved to the city for.  It only took a year and a half for me to finally make a group of friends.  I have variety now.  And how great is variety?!?!  So great. Kelly has friends here, Penelope has grown up here, Rita just got here...it is about time I started getting out of the house and making my life.   YAY!  Tonight I am going over to Mariah's with Rita for drinks, a movie, and prolly some pizza.  And prolly some cigarettes too.  As I said yesterday, I will be spending a great deal of time with her over the next couple of weeks.  She needs it and so do I.  It's kind of like establishing our new working relationship.  So far it has been even better than I imagined.  I am thrilled to be able to be one of the most important people she has in NYC.  I am thrilled to be introducing her to new people.  WOW.   Sensation overload. My birthday is less than a month away at this point.  Ooh...what to do, what to do.   Best not to think about it. The big 25!   ok...stop Joe...you said you weren't going to think about it. Tomorrow, Rita's boyfriend will be pulling into town for a quick visit.  He is going to be an NYPD stud and has to take his physical and do other sorts of bullshit.  I think that Rita is extremely excited.  She tries not to show it, but if you look closely, you can see her vagina pulsing with passion beneath her jeans.   omigod...did I just really say that? yes I did Rita. yes I did.  HA! Kelly is busy playing the "I love you....as a friend" game with a straight girl named Sasha.  This girl is BIZOMB!  She is so cool and so hot.  Kelly is doing a wonderful job of playing it safe.  She controls herself (most of the time), is a great friend to this girl, and is truly developing a very personal relationship with her.  It seems obvious to me that Sasha is interested.  Obvious.  However, Kelly has done this before with Angie.  And she dealt with so much bullshit with it that I thought she would never play in these type of waters again.  Guess you can't decide who to fall in like with.   We shall wait and see what comes next. Well, I guess that is it!  About 45 minutes left of work.  Thank the goodness of the lord. I am about ready to jump off the terrace.......into a vat of boxed wine.

      Had a wonderful talk with my brother and mother today.  Both conversations went REALLY well.  That always puts a positive spin on my day. Also opened a savings account and fixed the bullshit with my checking account. Man I have been productive.  Now it is time to get fucking blasted.   Nice Joe.  You are 25 years old (almost).  Do you get excited about getting blasted still?    Yeth.  Yeth I do.

      The weekend is over and now I must face the fact that I don't have a day off until July.  Ugh.  I have to work a REAL job now?  Unfair.  It will be ok.  Cuz in July is my birthday and vacation!!!   Ok...I am going to be 25 years old.  Can I NOT be 25 years old?  Actually 25 is kinda cool.  It's so old and mature.  And maybe I will get my man body then.   Last night for dinner, I made gorditas and tacos.  Rita brought home canolis for dessert and we all just ate and ate until the upset stomachs forced us into our rooms to writhe in pain.  I woke up this morning with some serious indigestion.  But I don't think that was from the tacos.  I think that was from the pack of crackers that I ate in bed.   (Do you remember that commercial about crackers in bed?  "But motha, they ahn't crackahs, they ah fig newtons") Stupid british and their great commercials. Now I drink orange juice and get acid stomach.  Yum. Tomorrow I get to go see how my headshots turned out.  I am pretty excited.  The whole experience was wonderful.  The photographer,  urlLink Nick Granito , was so good with me.  We spoke for just about an hour before he took any pictures.  He wanted to know all about me so that during the shoot he could say things to me to get me where he wanted me to go with each roll.  We talked alot about Paul, a lot about my acting, my experiences in NYC thus far...it was great.  He gave me tons of compliments, told me I had a "great look", informed me of certain things that I need to know as far as becoming an actor goes, and overall just gave me back some of the confidence that I have lost since college.   I walked out of the studio on cloud 10.  (Cloud 9 was booked due to a prior engagement)  I was so thrilled.  It made me want to do photo shoots every day.  I LOVE IT I LOVE IT!   After that, I went to stay at Mariah's apartment with Paul.  Rachel was there and we smoked and laughed and blared music and just rocked out.  That night we went to a bunch of different places for drinks; including the XL Lounge and Henrietta Hudsons.  Mariah seemed upset at the first couple of places and I picked up the fact that we needed a shot of lesbianism stat.  We rushed over to the ever popular lesbo bar and had a blast!  Mariah's mood quickly picked up and she was like the queen of the bar.  She was up dancing on the "stage" for about the entire night.  Girls, guys, dogs, and bunnies were all over her.  I think that Henrietta's made her feel more at home.  It is comfortable, crazy, and she was the star.  I was so proud of her.   She scored us ecstacy, free drinks, passes to an after hours party, and a special invite to a party later on in the week.  (Side note, we did not take the X)  I gotta use this girl more often. She can get me some good shit. After we got back to her apartment, she crashed.  In my 2 years of being close to Mariah, I have only seen her cry a handful of times.  In the 2 days that I hung out with her over the weekend, she cried about 8 times.  :( She is pretty homesick for Boston and very overwhelmed.  It will be ok.  It takes time and as long as everyone in her life just gives her a little breathing room, she should be able to rise above it all with flying colors.  I have faith in her and I will be here for her all the way.  It's my turn afterall. Having her here in the city is just about the best thing that has happened in a while.  She and I have so much fun, an incredible support system within eachother, and an understanding that only happens between best friends.  I think you get what I am saying.  Also, by having her here, I have just about doubled the amount of friends I have in the city.  Scary, huh?  I can still count them all on one hand, but hey...at least it's something! Paul was incredible this weekend.  He was so good with Mariah, so good with me, and an absolute pleasure the entire visit.  If it weren't for me and my smart ass mouth, we wouldn't have fought about anything all weekend.  When he and Mariah said goodbye to eachother on Saturday morning, Rachel and I sat there and cried along with them.  The whole situation broke hearts.  Seeing Paul cry over having Mariah move made me want to pick him up in my arms and cradle him like the adorable little child he really is.  He is so tough sometimes that it really seems as though he doesn't have a heart at all.  But then when confronted with a situation in which he can't control his emotions, he just lets go and I just fall in love all over again.  He was such a good boy! He is coming to visit again next week.  And I can't wait.   What else?  Going for drinks with Mariah tonight.  It will be her first "drinks" outing.  I mean, it won't be the first time that she has ever HAD drinks...but it will be her first "I live in NYC and go for drinks around 5pm" outing.  She is excited and I know it will get her mind off of being lonely.   She just called.  She sounded GREAT!  I am so proud of her.  She was like: "I am on 34th and 5th!"  YAYAYAY.  It is so cute to hear her say that.   I am just thrilled by this whole thing. Alright...almost time for a smoke.  And I need it today.  (WINKLES!)

      Ugh.  Usually by 2pm or so, the hangover that I am coping with kind of lets up and goes back to hell where it belongs.   However, it is now 4:02pm and I still feel like a mack truck drove into my life and left behind a trail of tears that otherwise resembles the old Joe.  I am definitely in for a good night's sleep tonight.  Rushing home to bring my laundry to the Asians, maybe doing a little packing, and then immediatly jumping into my bed for what I hope is a long, restful, rejuvenating sleep.  God willing. Also...could the fucking huge zit on my mouth get the hint and fuck off?!?!?! Seriously...it hurts and it is so gigantically hideous that I am embarrassed to show my nasty face.   Plus my stomach is raging, my diarehhea is spastic and I am so exhausted. Okay...enough complaining.  In reality I did do this to myself. Time to go curl up and die.

      So what began as a simple dinner trip for the housemates turned into the biggest night of drinking any of us will probably have this week.  Around 7pm, Kelly, Rita and I went to our favorite little local restaurant in Queens to eat.  I got the Ceasar Salad, Rita got the Margherita Pizza, and Kelly got the mussels.  mmmm....muscles.   We had tons of red wine and laughed and shared and talked our faces off for about 2 full hours.  We were able to sit outside and smoke butts.  The sky was seriously overcast, but it was nice and cool out and only started to rain at the end of the meal.  While we were there, we ran into a girl that went to college with Rita and me.  Her name is Katie and I know that me, for one, has missed her incredibly in the last couple of years.  I haven't heard from her, nor her me, in what has to be 3 years.  She was SO excited to see me and I was absolutely out of my mind thrilled to see her.  We hugged, kissed, and immediatly exchanged numbers.  This is one girl that I WILL be hanging out with very soon.  Probably right after the vacation.  God...how cool! After dinner, the three of us went back to our house.  I thought we would be going right to bed, but suddenly my bedroom door bursts open and dancing away was Kelly and Rita with glasses of wine and party hats on.  We blared my stereo and each put on performances of Rent until our voices were shot.  It was a wonderful good time.  I think we were all in bed sometime around midnight.  God...it was so good.  I thoroughly enjoyed myself last night and I think that my girls did too.   After the hangout, I called Katie, but only got her answering machine.  Then I called Penelope and we talked for about 45 minutes about her new and very exciting sex life!  :-D It was a great conversation and after I got off the phone, I literally passed right out in my bed.  Not to awaken until my alarm shot me in the face with loud and obnoxious music.  Felt pretty much like shit this morning.  As though I smoked a hundred cigarettes in a row.  Oh yeah...I did.   Now that it is 1pm, I feel somewhat better, but still like I got the shit kicked out of me.  Maybe I should consider not getting so blasted so often at the age of 25.  :-/ nah.  I'm fine. THREE DAYS UNTIL FLORIDA!  YAYAYAYAYAYAY! Fucking can't wait.  Can it be now?   Pretty soon it will be!  I haven't masturbated since Saturday afternoon.  Totally saving up for Paul.  I am going to explode all over him.  :-D Tonight...I am going immediatly home and doing the shit I need to do.  I have so much and I have been hanging out the last two nights as though I am not going on vacation at all.  I am sure it will all be fine.  Just gotta buckle down this evening and do it.   I am supposed to see Mariah tomorrow night so that really leaves very little time for me to get all my stuff together.   Big breath...I can do it. Ok...that's it for today, I think. Maybe will check in a bit later.

      YES!  The day is almost over.  It is officially 1:45pm and that only leaves 3 more hours of work.  Well, actually 2 more hours of work minus the hour long lunch break I am about to go on.  Today has flown!  Thank God.  I need it to be Friday and creeping days don't help at all. Spoke with Mariah today for the first time in a week or so.  She has been in Boston since July 3rd.  Yeah...July 3rd is when I went there for my birthday.  That was YEARS ago, it seems.  She finally got home last night.  She isn't so excited to be in NYC, but she has to just stay here and stick it out for awhile.  I know it is hard.  I KNOW it is, but still...gotta put in some sort of effort to adjust to this big and scary city.  :-D She will be fine eventually.  I will make sure of it.   Or I will slap her face.  That might wake her up a bit. My teeth tingle today.  Does that mean they are going to start bleeding again?  Man...that was awful.  Remember that?? How could you forget? They finally stopped bleeding some time in May.  Or late April.  That's a good 4 months of bleeding gums.  Damn.  That was shit. So I joined this thing called Classmates.com.  I only joined it so that I could retrieve Kim Moore's phone number last week, but lo and behold, within 24 hours of being a member of the site...I got an email from an old friend from highschool.  Her name is Becky Margison and she was my girlfriend when I was a freshman in highschool.  She looked EXACTLY like Kelly Taylor from 90210.  No...EXACTLY!  It was a strange and weird thing.  And she dated me!!! She was always a really sweet girl and really liked me.  I, however, wasn't totally interested and broke up with her at the end of the summer between my freshman and sophomore year.  (Of course I had to stay together with her through the summer...my friend Hannah and I had her drive our freshman asses everywhere!  Oh...she was 16 at the time...I was 14.)   So she wrote me this email and I wrote her back and then she wrote me back and then today when I wrote her...I dropped the G bomb on her.  You know the G bomb...don't you? It's weird...I don't think I have told anyone from highschool that I am gay yet.  I may have told Hannah a couple of months ago when I was talking to her...but I don't really remember.  So...now I just wait to find out what Becky says.  It may be a little weird, considering that she and I dated for about 6 months.  The last time I told someone I dated in the past that I was gay...it didn't go over so well.  It didn't go badly, but lets just say that she and I don't talk anymore.   And rightly so.... Everything is weird then.  How would you like to be told, after falling hard for someone -  and of course they fell hard...look at me (haha),  that the guy you like, or maybe even are in love with, has been gay the whole time? Whoops.   That stings. Not that I truly care.  If Becky Margison decides to freak out about me being gay, I will probably laugh. Cuz WHO ARE YOU Becky Margison. I am going to tell her that if she doesn't look like Kelly Taylor anymore, I don't want to be friends.  It's just the way it goes. Off to dinner and drinks tonight after work.  Nice, fun thing to do.   Just hope it goes smoothly. Right now...Pinks'  Just Like a Pill  is playing on my Launch Player.  You know?  The verses are GENIUS and her voice sounds great...but then we get into the 3 hour replay of the boring chorus.  Why does she DO that??? Well, the mail just came in and thanks to PENELOPE OF MY LOVE...a little package from Corporate Express came with a gift for me in it.  Thanks P!  I finally got my little rear view mirror from Jane!  You are the best for doing that! Now I can see when Deb the Beast is skulking in her room. And I just saw RCS come out of his office and he didn't even look at my computer as I was writing this.  See...if I didn't have my rear view mirror, my paranoid brain would have THOUGHT he was looking at me...but now I can see that he wasn't. YOU ROCK! and so does Jane. A little. So hungry.   I am not going to make it until dinner.  I have REALLY been debating getting Burger King today.  It has been months since I have been there.  No seriously.  Months!  I really deserve it.  But I won't get it.  I must wait until after the vacation. :( So hungry.  What can I eat that is light, tastes good, and makes me smile? A slice of pizza? Yum. But also...snores. ooh...how bout smores? nah...snores. Either way...this bitch gotta go eat! PEACE OUT JIGGAS.

      I've decided I hate PINK.  I decided it yesterday while taking a shit. A PINK shit.  It's not that she is the worst...it's that all of her songs play the chorus about a thousand times repeatedly and by the end of each listen...I want to kill her.   Can she become a little bit more original now?

      So Penelope reads this guys blog that's called "646 Guy/NYC Tales" or some shit.  She thinks he is awesome and she must be right, cuz yesterday and this morning, I have been checking out some other blogs and he is linked everywhere!  He is like blogger queen, I think.  I say queen...cuz well, he's a queen! Maybe I should link to him to?  Since I am a queen.   maybe not.

      YAY!  One more day closer to my vacation with Paul!  Only 4 days of anticipitory waiting left.  It's killing me!  Every morning I wake up and I go...one more day down.  My stomach jumps with excitement at the very thought of it all. After much debating in my head, I decided that we will in fact NOT be bringing any pot with us to Florida.  The risk is too high and after asking everyone I know, about a thousand times, I just figured, it really isn't worth it.  Besides, a drug free week could do Paul and I some good.  (And maybe I won't eat my face off) Last night I began getting my shit together.  Wow.  What a process.  It's fun though, and I am excited to get home tonight to continue working on my bihness.  Yeah...that's what I said...bihness. K...bored now...on to something more enjoyable...

      just realized that Rita may think she is the whore, cuz I am going home to see her. but understand rita that you are not a whore.  You are a lady. I just needed a word to rhyme with "bore" and "snore".   And "door" and "ROAR" wouldn't work. :-D

      Fucking ugh.  Back at work and it's that most dreaded day of the week.  I HATE it.   Even with vacation looming around the corner, work just totally blows.  Fortunately, my boss will not be here today and that makes me VERY happy.  I can play all day and hopefully not be bothered.  Hopefully, but that is a lot to ask when I know that ugly debbles will be back today. Rita and Kelly have officially returned from their vacations.  Kelly pulled in around 6pm on Saturday and Rita's flight landed around 11am Sunday.  It was so great to have them home.  Kelly is fully tan and Rita is fully pale, but such is life.  ;) Kelly's vacation was pretty introspective and I feel that she returned with alot more baggage than from when she left.  And she only brought one suitcase!  I know it wasn't a bad vacation for her...but I'm not so sure if it helped her to understand any of what she is going through any better.  It's tough being right out of college and realizing that you are a grown lady doing it on your own.  It took us all a long time to adjust.  But it will happen.  :-D Rita seemed fully rejuvinated and alive.  I think the Germany trip did her some good.  I know that she had a wonderful time with her family and a serene and beautiful time in Scotland.  She seems refreshed and ready to re-tackle those obstacles she's got goin in this big city.  Her pictures were beautiful, she brought home some great tasting candy and honey, and she just seems happy.  In turn, this makes me very happy.  Now she sleeps for days trying to get herself back on East Coast time. We all went to lunch yesterday, then Kelly went off to Yoga while Rita and I watched Moulin Rouge.  After that, Kelly came home and Rita and I settled in for about a 3 hour nap, waking up just in time to see Sex and the City, and then back to bed.  We were so tired.  I don't know why I was!!  It's not like I was in Germany playing around all week.  :) Now it is my turn.  Paul and I leave Saturday morning for Florida.  It can't come fast enough.  I am about at the point of explosion!   I am nervous, excited, stressed, and ready to tackle this vacation, but unfortunately, I have got a SHIT load of things to do and only 4 days to do it.  It may seem like there couldn't be that much, but I started making my "To-Do" list today and I am already to number 13.  (big sigh)  Also, Kelly wants to go to dinner tonight or tomorrow and I would love to go to, but I just have so much to do.  If I could work on getting this shit accomplished and go to dinner at the end of the week, then I wouldn't feel so stressed.  You know me...I get crazy about things for no reason.  I just need to sit back, take some deep breaths, and understand that this is all going to work out fine. As long as I don't die is a plane crash.   Cuz that scares the living wits out of me. All right...guess I should get started on some annoying, bullshit work now.   Wish this day was over already.   Or that it was at least 5pm. :)

      Wow.  It is VERY late on Friday night.  As I look at the clock, it is about to turn to 2am.  What a night. Well, not really WHAT a night.  I spent it alone in my apartment.  Quite the popular shit I am strutting my stuff on a Friday night.   :( But on the lighter side of things... I have done big things. The house is totally different.  I have done big things. I can't give anything away, just in case peeking eyes read this...but I had to at least write for my own sanity.  I may have crossed the line with some of my little "projects" I was working on.  But lets be honest...if you can't take a risk while redecorating...why redecorate at all? Right now I am listening to NYSYNC CELEBRITY.  It is pretty good. :-D BTW...when I said earlier how beautiful and wonderful the weather was today...I was full of fucking SHIT! Cuz really...by the time I got home from 15 mile walk from the subway...my clothes were drenched with smelly, booze from last night, sweat.  Now that was some sick shit. It was a mugfest, I tell ya. Then...around 6:30 or 7pm, the biggest thunder storm of my existence blew through our area.  It was fucking phenomenal.  So phenomenal, in fact, that my stoned ass started getting super paranoid.    WERE THOSE BOMBS IN THE AIR???  NOW THAT WAS TOO LOUD FOR JUST A CLAP OF THUNDER.  WHY DO I HAVE TO DIE ALONE!?!?!?!  But it was all good.  I, and you are never going to believe this, thought about calling Cleo, aka Leora.  I know she is afraid of this shit and if I was getting nervous, hells if she wasn't hiding under her bed.  Of course, Manny close by. I just felt bad.   But I didn't call. Pretty tired on this end...and I feel like shit. Long night, but extremely productive.   Paul is at his cousin's wedding.  Ashley.   I am not allowed to go because I am gay.   (BTW...Paul got his job back.  Will tell you why later...) Paul brought Mariah as his date.  He is acting as the "Maid of Honor", but really..."Best Man of Honor".  This cousin has grown up with him and is like his old best friend.  She knows all about my relationship with Paul and has met me on multiple occassions.  I have known about this wedding since the day after she was proposed to.  I met her before she was even engaged.  Not being at this wedding sucks.  Not that she is that close to me or anything...but that it is something that Paul and I should be sharing.   However, that is impossible. Today, I came into work to find an email from my dad.  It, actually, was an email to Paul that he wanted me to forward on.   It was all about Paul losing his job and how my parents love and respect him, regardless of the bullshit.  How they prayed for him and are so glad to find out that he has his job back.  The email goes on to say how excited they are for he and I and our vacation.  That we are always welcome at my house in Albany. It was pure love. I did forward the email, but am unsure as of this point as to whether or not Paul has received it.  (He had the wedding rehearsal today) My family (whom I respect beyond belief for all of this) fully accepts me, as well as Paul, and wants nothing, but a happy life for both of us.  They are there.  They get it now.  They really do. They have come to the point where their love has fully exceeded their inner desires for my life.  I have arrived.  My family is in on the whole thing and WOW. I never thought I would be in the position to say that.  NEVER. But I am saying it. My parents are cool with me being gay. Not just cool.   Supportive. Shit...now that is why I love these people. But Paul's family....no such luck.   It sucks that I can't be there with him for this.  I know he wants me there.  He has been calling over and over.  But there are lines you don't cross with his family.   I feel horrible for him.  The only reason why I am really no pressure on him to "come out" to his inner circle is because I was there, and I know how scary it is.  I was lucky.  Paul won't be so lucky. Right Wing.  Republican.  Central Massachusettes.  His parents' background and current attitude don't allow for any luck involved. It's purely God.  Paul has to take the plunge at some point.  But when he's ready.   And maybe...hopefully someday...when his faith in God is much stronger. Two gay guys, who are both born again...raised baptist, Christians, surviving a two and a half year relationship with eachother means something.   It is all God driven for me.   I remember the night I was laying in my bed.  It was Mid-December of 1999.  I was begging, pleading with God for someone for me to fall in love with, someone to have a real relationship with.   I began dating Paul on January 9th, 2000. And look where we are. Tell me that doesn't mean something.  It was something that changed my life and I know that God sent that for me.  I was at the breaking point. And now Paul is my yesterday, today, and tomorrow.   At least...for a little tomorrow.  ;) Why did I just ramble all of this bullshit, I don't know.   I am overtired. I guess my subconcious took over and got rid of some shit.   It felt good. Tonight, I want to give a special shout out to Jeannie Dreama, who NEVER writes in her blog....at least not since like February somethin somethin) HI JEANNIE!  Did you get my postcards?? I know that you read my blogger, cuz on the quiz, there is only one answer that is logical and safe. That being "Don't do it.  There are dogs everywhere..." One day I checked the stats and I saw that that answer was answered and I thought to myself...who would put that answer??? Hmmmm...... JEANNIE DREAMA! :-D But I also agree with you.  I talked to my mom on the phone today and asked her if I should bring anything. (I actually did ask her) She was like "Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...." So I expect that you and my mom would say the same thing... LOL JUXT KIDDIN! But you are right.  It's risky.   I will let you know what I end up doing.  Understand that if the poll says that "french fries" are what to do...that is what I will do. Okay everyone. (everyone...like I have an everyone) I just want to say one more time how MUCH I miss my ladies! They have been gone so long.  I have spent two weekends and a whole week in this house alone.   Come home soon.  If not..."little projects" will consume the place. You are both so wonderful.  No matter what we deal with or how crazy we all get.... This house is so much more warm and full with all of us in it. I love our love. come home now, k?

      Well the week is officially over.  By the time I come back to work on Monday, both of my girls will have returned from their adventures.  That is kind of exciting.  :-D Gotta clean the house today.  Oh BOY do I gotta clean the house today.  I happened to walk by the garbage can this morning and I almost RALPHED right on the floor.  It stinks dude!  hee hee hee. I have been living in my own filth for a week and it has felt gooooood. In fact, we have had like no hot water this week either, which is fucking irritating, and it has caused me to have to skip showering in the morning TWICE this week.  Each time it happens, I slam on the bathroom wall repeatedly and in a brutish manner.  I want everyone in the house to know that I am PIST! Trey is ready for his mother to come home.  I do adore the living wits out of him and we have definitely had some incredible moments together this week...but I am ready to go back to ignoring him again.  That bitch is alot of work.  And I feel so badly if I don't take the time to play with him and love him whenever he so decides. My dad sent me a beautiful email today that was actually to Paul.  He wanted me to forward it to him.  It was all about how he lost his job and how he and my mom are praying for his success and blah blah beautiful blah. It was incredibly sweet and I passed it along to him this morning. :) Gotta leave work early today to drop off two envelopes on campus.  Ugh.  I would actually rather sit right here until 2pm and play around.  But instead...outside into the summer weather. Today is actually a perfect day.  Bright sunshine, no humidity, and just clear and crisp weather.  It feels real nice. Get out and enjoy it. K all.  Will prolly write some more this weekend. PEAYCE.

      So of course I am ripping apart the resource room with Cleo when Kelly IM's me, I am assuming from North Carolina.  When I got back to my desk, I was PIST!  This is officially two conversations that the cursed resource room has ruined for me today.   Earlier, Rita called from Germany and I wasn't even allowed to say more than five words because I had resource room guru, Cleo, breathing down my neck.  UGH! Furious at that. I miss my ladies and it sucks that the time they call...I am impossible to reach. :( Ah well.  Nothing that can't be cured by going home and getting drunk all by myself.   Man...they best come home now, cuz I am going down the tubes real fast. heh heh. Not really.   As of Tuesday night, I started to get more used to being alone in the apartment.  I go home, do little projects for the first couple of hours, then I excercise for about 7 minutes, then I make a nice dinner at around 9:00pm and then I am in bed by 10:30pm.  I leave the door open when I sleep and I walk around completely nude.  I jerk off with my door open and I REFUSE...absolutely REFUSE to pick anything up off of the floor.  If Kelly and Rita could see the house the way it is right this minute...they would be horrified.  The kitchen and living room are fine.  But the bathroom and my bedroom have been completely destroyed.  And let me also say...the kitchen and the living room are in no way fine.  I lie. But it will all be clean and beautiful by the time they come home on Sunday. Tonight and tomorrow are my days to redo the place.  Is it pathetically wrong that I am excited to clean up the joint?   Cuz that's what I want to do.  I want to get high and ransack the piece. mmmmm....piece. Ah well. I guess that's it today.  Not too much to say. OH!  One more thing. Rita, we got this inter-office memo from Jim.  It is a record of all the long distance calls that we have made from our extension.  We are to pay for each one of these calls. I kind of panicked, cuz even though I don't really call long distance...I have.  I was sure my bill was going to be like $25.  In actuality it was like $1.65.  PHEW.  Penelope's was $.24.  hahahaha. I am sure yours is like: "$.008. Jim told me that anything under $5 was free.  Which I think is pretty generous.  I mean...are we really ALLOWED to make long distance calls at work?  I dinna think so. But now that I know we get 5 bucks free...hells if I am not going to be using that money each month.  ;) WINKLES! YIPES! Latas!

      Okay.  Enough is enough. The weather in NYC at 8am this morning was 84 degrees.  It is supposed to get up to 94 or so by noon with the heat index making it feel like 105!  Are we fucking serious???  The subway was a BEAST this morning and I am still moving as though I am wading through tar.  It's so hot outside that there is no way I can go to the park to lay out this afternoon.  It's that bad.  Ugh.  Supposedly, it is going to storm this afternoon and then it will THEORETICALLY cool down for this weekend.  Can it?  Can it please? I don't know if I can do this again tomorrow.   Rita...you picked a PERFECT week to get out of the city.  This heat would have killed you by Tuesday.   SO hungry right now.  Yesterday at this time, I had the most delightful bagel from UFM.  May have to skip on over there in a little bit and pick me up another one.  I thought UFM bagels sucked, but I was happily mistaken.   SNARF. Oh and by the way...MTV is the BEST television station ever.  :-D (that was for Penelope)

      Well here it is folks!  The much anticipated REAL WORLD REUNION recap entry.  I know you have all been chomping at the bits for it and I feel compelled to immediately sit down and give it.   ;) What am I?  Writer extrodinairre?   yes. I want to first begin with a more descriptive explanation of the preview to last nights episode.  I didnt explain it well yesterday and when I saw it again last night, I immediately wrote it down so that I could tell those who havent seen it what it REALLY was all about.  It was that fucking funny. So whatever...its just a normal preview for any real world episode.  But as it goes along, the following dialogue is heard: Kera in the preview:  Did I REALLY say land the deal? Computerized ladies voice (you know the voice---the COMPUTER lady):  Yes you DID Kera!  (said VERY angrily - swear to God.) Immediately FLASH to a past episode in which Kera says:  Get my *bleep*n name right Tonya. Computerized ladies voice:  OOPS!  My bad. ---end scene--- Now, of course it is so much funnier when you see it live, but let me tell you...even while writing it, I am dying laughing.  I know a couple of you have seen it and am I right or not?  Computerized ladies dont say such things as Oops, my bad or make accusatory tones such as Yes you DID Kera!. Fucking hysterical. Now on to the goods: ********Do understand that once you read this I will have ruined the episode for you if you havent seen it.  But also understand that last night, because I am a lonely, pathetic loser, I took notes on the episode to catch yall up.  Well really only for Kelly and Rita.  Penelope saw it thank God.  Cuz really??!!!  (I will tape the episode this weekend to show you the goods) Here we go...  WHERE ARE THEY NOW?  Chris - I am living in NYC and modeling still.  I have learned alot and... zzzzzzzz, I fall asleep at this point.  Theo - I have started a production company called (cant read the notes I took, cuz I was writing so fast) with my brothers.  We have a couple things lined up and its going well.  Aneesa - I am a cocktail waitress and just so every knows...my mom and I are doing GREAT!  We love eachother and..." blah blah blah... --- was trying too hard to convince us that her mom is not a psycho anymore.  Kyle - Well, after the show I decided to go into acting.  I had done theater in college along with weightlifting, football, and other super masculine stuff. (Fucking he said that!  FUCKING HE SAID THAT!)  I was offered a role on Passions, but I turned it down, cuz its not exactly Macbeth.  I mean really...PASSIONS??? (looks for audience laughter)   ARGH!  I HATE THIS LOSER!  Kera - Well, I as well went into acting, but I havent had as much luck as Kyle.  (Kyle jumps in with Kera...PASSIONS????  (looks for audiences laughter)   I am now living at home and getting my life together.  SNORE and HAHAHA.  Youll never be an actress Kera.  You did the REAL WORLD!  Keri - (as adorable as ever)(actually...she looked fucking HOT) Well, I moved back to New Orleans and I am currently engaged to the love of my life.  He is someone from my past and when I got back home it just clicked.  It happened and I am so happy and ready for the future.  (Kyle scowls during this)  YOU DIDNT KERI!  YOU DIDNT!   you did.  and I love you for it.  Tonya - Well, and you are never going to believe this,  but I am no longer with Justin.  I saw the show and realized that there was a lot I wanted to change about myself and Justin wasnt allowing me to change.  He was keeping me where I was.  I am doing well and figuring it all out.  You STUPID STUPID bitch.  All you had going for you was the fact that you had found the love of your life.  Now you are orphenage alone again, but this time with no one.  Stupid I tell ya.   Eh...she always has that infamous Darren.  So there it is... Thats where they are now.  But let me tell you...if even for a second you thought that this was going to be the most shocking part of the show...you would be wrong.  I am only going to tell you about a few of the big points, but understand that these seven people sat on a stage with a live audience and discussed problems that were still so fresh in everyones minds.  They saw the show when WE, the people, saw the show.  They found out shit as we found out.  And everyones pissed!  Everyone gets a chance to say their piece:  What do you want the audience to know that is different about you then what the world saw on the show?  Annesa - I didnt like the way I handled Veronica and..."  boring McBorings  Chris - fucking snoresville.  Are we serious?  The kid opens his mouth and I feel like I am on some intense sleeping pills.  He goes on for some time about how he is so proud be sober.  Damn.   Fuck you for being so boring.  Actually...at one point...out of NOWHERE...Kyle says to Chris...and the world...that Chris...what do you know?  Half the time I watched you I thought that you were so spacey and out there.  Hello Chris!  HELLOOOO...(waits for audience laughter)   Important tidbit to know.  Yet another example of Kyle, the show off, generic, instigating, immature, gossipy, gayest straight man I ever saw, backstabbing, idiot, spouting off about things that dont REALLY need to be said.    These people are so fucking rude to eachother and I die with laughter.   Man they suck.  Theo - I stayed out of all personal problems until I was invited in.  I dont go around sticking my nose into things that dont belong me.  There were a couple issues that I partook in, but I was included and was supposed to be there.  If I am asked about a problem, I give my opinion.  Other than that...nope.  Good boy.  And yes...that is the truth.    Tonya - I was honest about everything and everyone got to see what I was going through.  People saw me cry and that was hard for me.  And it wasnt all bad.  I wasnt sick the whole time.  Especially during the Halloween show.   Kera jumps in with Well Tonya, just so you know...you were DEFINITELY a reason as to why we couldnt do Bloody Mary.   (Back to this Bloody Mary bullshit)   Tonya - No I wasnt Kera.  You know this.   (Kera did in fact say, during that episode, that Tonya being at the hospital (the morning of the performance) was in no way a factor in the decision to cancel Bloody Mary.    She goes on to say very vehemently that There were 9 reasons why I said we should cancel and you being sick was not one of them!) Now she comes forward with this bullshit.  What a liar/pretender.  yeah. thats what she is.   A LIARPRETENDER. Tonya huffs and puffs and they argue for a bit with it ending on Keras statement of:   Well Tonya...I think it (this show) was a very CLEAR representation of you.  It was completely true. Tonya - I know Kera, it was. Kera - No Tonya.  It is. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA I definitely pieced together a few conversations between the two during that episode, but it all boils down to the same thing.  Plus...these two psychos act like best friends one minute...because they shared a room...fuck you both...that was never made a real point.  You never did shit together...and or course the next minute they are down eachothers throats. whoa. yeah.  Now I interject because in order to discuss the one thing they would change about themselves, I have to divulge what happened during the episode with Keri and Kyle. Here you go folks.  Breathe deep.  Scenes are shown, over and over to the point of sickness, of Keri and Kyles relationship. From hook-ups to conversations to hanging out to going to bars...its all there. While the clips are being shown...Kyle sits there smug and Keri is mouthing the words: Bullshit.  BULLSHIT.  Bullshit.  All of its fucking bullshit. Keri is ready to explode and here she goes:  Keri -  I was SHOCKED (as we all were) to see what Kyle and Kera did and said behind my back. Kera...you trashed me.  You said horrible things about me and Kyle...that whole confessional thing...what the hell was that???  You treated me horribly and the show proved that to me.  When I saw the episodes, I couldnt believe what you were saying behind my back.  (I dont remember exactly what she said, but I do know that she goes on and on, in a very classy way, about how ridiculous and asinine she thinks that Kyle and Kera are) When asked to sum up herself, Kyle, and Kera, ----didja get all that?  The names are similar.  Here you go...concentrate now...When asked to sum up....herself...Kyle...and Kera...(after rereading that...I found that line to be a little difficult to understand.  But at this point I am drunk) Keri gives the quote of the evening: What I think about the three of us....hmmm......(pause)......two have very similar personalities, the other is VERY different. Meaning---Kyle and Kera are BOTH manipulative bitches and Keri is our beautiful, sweet little angel.   And that is correct.   As we all know...Keri was had.  She was fooled into believing that both of these people were her friends.  But at the end...they attempted to ruin her on camera.  And boy werent they surprised when quiet, little Keri opened her mouth and this brutal honesty was spewed forth. Please also understand that Kyle basically shut his mouth the whole time, looking totally embarrassed and sometimes smug.  Cause ALWAYS smug.  Smug bitch. While the clips of her and Kyles romance were being shown, Keri either: a) burst out laughing b)  called it bullshit...accusatory bullshit at Kyle c)  rolled her eyes  When asked this one question...which I cant for the life of me remember, Kyle says: Well I really liked her and shum shum...we had such a personal connection in the beginning.  Especially when we both worked at the life guard station.  Right Keri...didnt you think that? Keri - What?  Oh... whatever Kyle.  I dont care anymore. Kyle sits stunned.    And fucking good!  That is basically it, but OF COURSE you must see the actual episode to see how severe it all really was.  Now one last thing...two specific items shocked me during the episodes and both fall under the category of Things We Didnt See.  1)  September 11th.  The actual episode doesnt do it the justice that the Reunion show does.   Brian McFayden, the host, actually chokes up while discussing it.  The only reason that this part didnt FULLY make choke me up is because he was the RUDEST MTV host ever.  He definitely called Kera a slut about 3 times.  Which...I know...she is...but there was a HUGE portion of the show dedicated to that topic.  And by the end of it...really...shut up Kera and shut up Brian McFayden. While recaping the Sept. 11th episode, we are all taken back to that horrible day.  I get teary still as I am sure you do too.  I notice the following things during the recap of the episode: Everyone is gathered in a prayer circle saying that age old adage:  God...Grant me the Serenity to accept that which I cannot change and to shumma shum. In the whole group...Kera is the ONLY one who doesnt know it.  She just sits and stares at everyone with that LOOK.  You know that look.  That look of I am so understanding and supportive of you, but also with a hint of I am the best and smartest.  She doesnt know the prayer.  Is she Jewish?  Cuz she might be and then she WOULDNT know it.  I dont even know it.  But how did the entire group know the whole thing verbatim?  Did they hand out copies of it?  They must have.  And Kera didnt do it.  I dont know.  The whole thing was strange and hysterical in my head at the time...but as I write it...its just strange.  Why did she not know it???   Each member of the group was asked if they wanted to go home right after the attacks.  They all gave a resounding Yes, but of course I wanted to...and I immediately checked plane flights and... However...none of them went home.  Not even Kyle who basically lives down the street.  And remember folks...he was the MOST touched by the whole tragedy.  Nicole does live in NYC afterall.   I think...they werent allowed to go home.  I think the show made them stay.   You think...They cant do that...never! I think...they did.  They wanted the footage of this happening to real people.  Unfortunately, they must have all gone to bed that day, cuz the episode was basically snoresville.  Well...Kyle looking at the artwork on the wall (model planes half missing in the plaster---it gives the effect of planes crashing into the wall...but not blowing up...just kind of going through the wall.) makes the comment of How WEIRD is that?  Look at that and tell me that that isnt WEIRD. Someone in the room: Yes Kyle.  That is weird. Kyle:  NO.  But its WEIRD. lol oh snores.  And the last thing to know about this Sept. 11th thing is that they were brought in a TV from the outside.  These 7 had no connection to the outside world...but on this day... they brought in a tv. Now...I am a moron.  I MUST be a moron.   There is NO television in the real world house?   Am I serious???   I have been watching the Real World since its debut and have even read a few books on the different casts and I NEVER knew that there was no television in the houses!!! I never thought about that! Of COURSE there is no television.  With a television, no one has to talk to eachother!  It makes PERFECT sense.    But I was shocked by that.  No tv for a good 4-5 months.  Now that is some heavy shit.  These people truly do make a sacrifice when they sign on to do this show.  AND LASTLY...and the MOST IMPORTANT part of the entire show! There is kind of a montage of scenes of things we didnt see.  I dont remember much of it, because it prolly was really boring.   BUT... the thing I do remember is this: Tonya is fooling around on the computer with a couple of people in the room. Her picture is posted on the internet, as we see by the camera zooming in. And what website is it, you ask???? FUCKING, HOT OR NOT!   Tonya, the orphen, has her picture on HOT OR NOT!  NO FUCKING WAY!  LOLOlololoLOLolOlOLolOlOlololoOlllOl! Holy shit.  I SCREAMED when I saw it.  She says Justin did it as a joke.   Joe says:  You did that for real. It about made my night.  Seeing that made watching the ENTIRE season, over and over in reruns and rarely missing a new episodes debut, totally worth it.   When you know who Tonya is and you know what she is really about...of COURSE she is on Hot or Not.  Of course. Its almost as obvious as the house not having a television.  So this is it!   This is your recap.    And here is your bottom line:  Never in my life have I seen a reunion show of The Real World in which the people werent fully best friends again.   This reunion was so fresh after the show...and they had all only been together once before the taping of this special. They are all still so angry.  Feelings are still hurt and tempers are flared. I have to admit.  Its my favorite Real World of all time. For me.  Everyone has their own favorite and I love them all...so I understand any case based on another season.   But for me... I watched it each Tuesday and shared it with my friends, around the water cooler, each Wednesday.  :) These people became people I know.  They let go and talked about eachother, competed with eachother, and allowed themselves to hate one another. With the exception of Kyle (as we will never know who he TRULY is---but better off that way), all of these people were REAL.  At least real in the situation they were placed in.  They acted as though they had no idea that when the episodes were pieced together, all of this shit was going to come out. Doing this reunion show immediately after the airing of the season finale was not only smart...it was the icing on the cake for the audience.   There were definitely moments when I saw them all sitting on stage and I felt bad.  These are real people who, for some reason or another, really believed that this backstabbing wouldnt come to the foreground.  They were caught red handed hurting eachother and it read on their faces.  The wounds are still fresh and here we are, the American public, watching and laughing and writing up ridiculous reviews.   We are a sick society. But on the flip side...the side I prefer...they KNEW going into this that this is what it was going to be.  At least in the THIS IS GOING TO BE ON TELEVISION respect)  You are allowed to be shocked by how much of an ass you really are...but understand that this is the point.   We, the viewers, wouldnt watch a 7 person group of boring ass people.   And which do you want more? Viewers or integrity? The answer is simple.  All in all...in my opinion...and many people would disagree...MTV is the best station on television.  They are fresh, fun, mindless, and FIRST in so many new and creative areas.  Reality TV comes from MTV.  Dont let Who Wants to be a Millionaire or Big Brother or even that little show Survivor fool you.  It all started with MTV.  And after all the competition...it all ends with MTV.   They are consistent and they are the best in the business. Every reality based show they do: Diary Making the Video Cribs True Life (one of my FAVORITES!) The Real World Road Rules Tough Enough Wannabe Wanna be a VJ? The Osbournes and so many more....these shows may be cheesy at times...but that is the point.   MTV knows what it is good at and it consistently breaks new ground.   I am proud to say I love MTV.  I am 25 years old and I would even be on Undressed.   Anything to support my favorite station.  And to get me a paycheck. :-D Rock out and I hope you enjoyed this RIDICULOUSLY long recap entry. Can Rita and Kelly come home now? This is getting out of hand.

      So in ridiculous news...you know Stella from Fridays in Boston? Well she is getting $5,000 braces to fix her fangs!  UM!   I burst out laughing when Paul tells me and then I go "why?" Paul very seriously says: "Cuz she is going to be an actress, Joe". Is it wrong that I laughed even harder and longer at that part?

      Why is it that black people don't get the luxury of tanning in the summer? Similarly, why is it that to be beautiful in the summer, white people make themselves darker? Shouldn't it work out that white people can get darker in the summer if they work at it and black people should get whiter if they work at that?   That way everyone is happy.

      So hahaha whoops!   I went to the park on my lunch break and accidently fell asleep for about 20 minutes.  When I woke up I felt disoriented and like I had fallen into a 12ft. pool.  I sat up and a pool of sweat was sitting on my bookbag.  On my chest sat another puddle of sweat.  And when I stood up...my entire ass was soaked through the shorts.  (hee hee oops) I came back and everyone has gotten quite the laugh out of seeing me dry in the front, soaking wet in the ass.  I better get some damn color from this experience.  It's not much fun sitting in your own wetness.   BLECH.

      I ABSOLUTELY HAD TO POST THIS.  I never post shit like this, but I did shit myself and laugh obnoxiously out loud at almost every paragraph.  Now THIS is funny.  Nothing is ever funny.  But THIS...now THIS is funny. And the reason I post this is because it is me.  This is how I would write if I ever wrote anything.  In my opinion, this is funny.  I am taking a risk here folks.  Please understand that.     BEES DON'T KILL SMOKERS  Apis Mellifera Countered By Marlboro    I was sitting around the other day. Just standing smoking a cigarette. Not doing anything at all. When out of the blue, BAM! A large man-lady of hippopotamus proportions ambled right in the line of fire of my smoke exhalation. Then the dumb bitch has the audacity to make that phony coughing sound - as if she couldn't be more discreet.   So I grabbed Ms. Load by the arm and insisted, "If killer bees come to attack us, you're gonna' die bitch! But I'll still be puffin the grit you ambiguous colossus!" Okay, no I didn't. But I really wanted to.   Damn, at least let me explain. I was watching the Discovery channel a long time ago. There was this special on beekeepers and how they keep themselves from being stung by two thousand and three pissed-off bees. In the program they enlightened a commonly used tactic to keep the bees serene: smoke. You see, most insects can't breathe in smoke, so naturally, smoke sends them flying away like Anne Heche with a sock full of heterosexuality. But get this: HUMANS CAN BREATHE IN SMOKE! EVEN CIGARETTE SMOKE! AND WE DON'T HAVE TO FLY AWAY!  It's as true as the Marlboro man is. You know who he is, right? That badass cowboy who has nothing better to do than chill out on the ranch and smoke Reds. What a cool cat! He makes me want to put on some rawhide chaps, a nice Stetson hat and some Old Spice deodorant so that I can sit on a wooden fence and watch the cattle graze. And maybe, if I'm a patient enough cowboy, I'll get so see a couple gay steers do the horizontal hobble.   Where seldom is heard a discouraging word...  So word around the campfire is that bees can't breathe in smoke. But it's more than just idle talk - it's true. That's why beekeepers use smoke. Have you learned nothing? The beekeepers also wear protective clothing. Giant welding masks, Kevlar body suits, shell-toed Adidas and Victoria Secret panties for the comfort. They're dealing with deadly insects you know!  Nutso #1: Egad Dwayne! I'm all out of smoke! Nutso #2: Thank God I have these cigarettes! Nutso #1: Yay! Cigarettes saved the day!            Thank you Ziff Davis! Nutso #2: I think you mean Philip Morris.  I could talk about bees and cigarettes all day! Like this one time I went out on my porch to get some fresh air and I ended up sitting on a big fat hairy bumblebee. It stung me right in the ass flesh and it really hurt. My butt was numb and soon after sported a large welt the size of Princess Di's tombstone.   And another time I was catching lightning bugs at night when I accidentally, coincidentally and inadvertently (not to mention unintentionally) snatched a bee. It was a catastrophe. After it ate all the lightning bugs in the jar, it turned on me and stabbed my eyebrow with its ass-skewer (scientific name is 'STINGER'). I looked as though someone had whacked me in the face with a giant bee.  Luckily, I don't have any reactions to bee stings. But my neighbor did. His mom wouldn't let him out of the house in the summer for fear that a disgruntled bee might sting him.   "Fuck that Queen whore! Roll up another ball of wax? Screw that! I'm going to go out hara-kiri style," said the disgruntled bee. And then I imagine that my neighbor would have peered his pale visage between the screen door for the first time and then BAM! Smarted in the neck by a peeved insectazoid aggressor! That was cool. Well, it never actually happened, but it would have been cool.   When a honeybee stings, it pumps poison into its victim from its bulging sac. That sounds really gross, or really sexy. I can't decide. But it hurts. And not in the good way like the sexy way implies.   But anyway, bees don't like smoke. So most beekeepers use smoke to keep the bees away. Some people even use liquid smoke. But many professional beekeepers steer away from this tactic because the substance is somewhat like hair spray and it clogs the nozzle. Turns out a few beekeepers came up missing. That's funny, too.   So I figured that smoking cigarettes would lessen my chances of being killed by bees. So don't rap to me that I will die from smoking because I will reply by saying, "No. You will die when the bees come." Then you'll look at me all retarded.  I promise that if I'm smoking and you come up and feign a cough or insinuate that second-hand smoke is depleting your health, I WILL PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE! Or, for your own health, stay the fuck away from smokers when they are smoking. It's common sense. It's not like we can smoke inside restaurants anymore. And if we can we're forced to sit in a room with a box fan and bars on the windows.   Most smokers are considerate. We don't blow it in your face any more than you flaunt that greasy cheeseburger in front of vegans.   Come to think of it, I just might keep a jar full of bees in my pocket. When someone says something to me or waves their hand in front of their face whilst panting their tongue, I will violently shake the jar of bees. The aggravation will build and then I'll open the top and continue smoking as they sting you to death - just like that little boy in "My Girl," except you probably look nothing like Macaulay Culkin.  So you just sit there all happy and free while we serve our master behind an immure of stockade-like surroundings.  I am a smoker and I know that when I'm deserted by a beehive in Africa that I will have fortification in the form of cancer sticks. So when you've got a population of rascally creepy crawlers on your ass don't come begging me for a cigarette! I'll be too busy laughing maniacally while you're suffering mastication from a cloud of KILLER BEES!

      I fucking can't believe it.  Really...when you least expect it, your life changes over night.  Well...this isn't really a case of that...but still...what the fuck just happned? So I am standing in the corner of one of the trains on the subway minding my own business.  When I get to 30th street, I decide to leave my cramped hole and get close to the door.  As I swing around to face the doorway, the girl in front of me turns around and like out of a movie we both say at the exact same time: "Oh my God." Standing in front of me is a girl named Desiree.  I am in SHOCK.  I look next to her and who the fuck do I see sitting there???  KIM MOORE!  UM!  KIM MOTHA FUCKING MOORE!  Kelly...do you remember Kim?  She lived with Andrea.   Ok..let me explain before this gets super annoying. Kim and Desiree are two of the 34 residents that lived in my hall when I was an RA, my junior year of college.  I was THAT RA.  The one that drank with his residents, covered for them on every occassion, bought pot for and from them, etc.  In turn, they went to every program I put up, showed up at every hall council meeting, and became, for the year...my best friends.  It was a crazy year for me for so many reasons...but the best and worst of it came from these 34 people.  I have to admit it.  I was an AMAZING RA.  In my 3 years in the dorm, I never saw a floor bond as well as mine did.  Most of them stayed in touch all through college and even moved in with eachother once that time came to move off campus.  To prove my point more...Desiree and Kim were from TWO sides of the track when they met at my first hall meeting...and now they live together in Astoria!  We all did a lot together and we all got close real fast.  Damn.  That was a GOOD year for me in a lot of aspects. Kim, Andrea, and I became the closest first.  They were both drop dead gorgeous and the kind of girls that I usually am friends with.  Not because they are gorgeous, but because they were fun and just like me.  We had an intense friendship for about 4 months.  I was straight at the time and fell for Andrea.  My brother came to visit and he and Kim fell hard for eachother.  That was difficult for me to deal with at the time...but so it goes... At the end of the first semester, I had a MAJOR falling out with these girls, cuz I realized that I was giving them all of my attention and not focusing on the other 32 people of my floor.   Needless to say, I branched out and they got pissed.   Since that time, I haven't really gotten along with Kim and Andrea.  It's always a fake "hi" and an even faker "bye".  I got close to Desiree when I had to spend the night in the hospital with her due to her horrible asthma attacks.   The year ended with a fucking BANG and I said goodbye to all of them.   The next year, I pulled away from ALL of them completely, in typical Joe style, and got to know my girls of 56B.  The girls that stayed with me up until this point and the girls that I owe my life to.  All the bullshit with my residents up until that point was worth it, having met these incredible 56B ladies. But I sacrificed all of them in the process. When I saw Desiree and Kim on the subway, my heart stopped.  So many things flashed through my mind.   1)  I was INCREDIBLY excited to see them. 2)  They don't know I am gay.  I came out two years after not talking to them anymore. 3)  I think they might still harbor negative feelings for me, considering how it all went down at the end.  Kim especially. So, because of all of this bullshit...I had no idea how to react to them.  I acted like I didn't want to see them and when it was time to go our separate ways...I said: "Well...see you at the subway again."  They both looked a little disheartened, but it was too late.  I had already killed the chance of asking for or giving my number.  They were like "ok...see ya", I hugged and kissed them, turned on my  heels and walked away.   As I walked home I started to get upset.  Why was I like that to them?  Regardless of these thoughts I had...why did I not just suck it up and be nicer?  Why didn't I give them my number and let them make the choice of calling me? I'll tell you why.   It's so RARE...in fact...it's almost impossible for me to run into anyone who doesn't know that I am gay anymore.  And if that exceptional occassion does happen, I have no problem telling the person.  This is different.  These people looked up to me and for a year I was their mentor and best friend.  I lied to them about who I was.  Well, in actuality, I lied to myself about who I was.  It wasn't their fault.  But damn.  Now look what I have done. When I walked in the door, I immediately tracked down Kim's number and have since been calling her over and over and over.  No answering machine and no answer.   Now I am forced to sit and stew.   I miss Kim alot.  I always have.  She was an incredible person and I always felt really bad about how things ended.  But you know it is impossible to go back and apologize.  I don't know where her feelings are at right now.  I hurt her and I know I hurt her badly.  Of all of the people on the floor...she is one of 3 people that I just destroyed by pulling away.  She, of the 3, is the only person who destroyed me right back.  As I said...she and Andrea had a lot in common with me, including the way we handle dicks.  And I was the dick. I want to see her.  I must see her.  I need to take her out for drinks and maybe we can get a friendship going again.  Alright...time to go give her a ring again.   Let a word to the wise be sufficient... Life is coincidental and the world is small.  It is never impossible to go back and fix things.   Here is my chance. When is yours?

      So now that Paul has no job, he has gotten increasingly more adorable.  He calls me like every five minutes just to say crazy things. The thing he just said was this: "Joe..I have two huge things I need to tell you.  First is that there is a huge storm cloud over my head and no other clouds in the sky.  But it is right over my head.  Second is that there are Asians everywhere.  I was just sitting on a bench and heard these two British guys talking about something interesting.  So I peek my head over the bushes to check them out and staring back at me were two pairs of Asian eyes.  It was fucking creepy!" I LOL'd until I about shit myself.  (which isn't a hard thing to do today...have had about 3 intense cases of diarehhea in 4 hours) Also...a good point to know...The secret shopper that got Paul fired from his job was Asian.  So now he hates all of them.  And I don't blame him.  Asians are sick! ;) He is being so fucking cute I don't know what to do with myself.  He has said over and over, in the last week, that he is so excited for Florida.  Member how last month he was ruining my life by saying how much he was dreading it?  Well good old Paul comes through again with his last minute...I love everything attitude.  Thank God for that.  He stresses me the fuck out, but at the same time...I know that he will always come through. I am going to go set up a poll that I NEED answered by all of my friends.  I will leave it up until I go to Florida.  Everyone...please take a minute out of your day to give me some advice. Have a great night!   Especially Kelly who is in NC and Rita who is in Scotland today!  YAY!

      Man it is beautiful outside today.  Man alive! I definitely got some color.  My arms are actually stinging a bit.  And I lovel it!  If the weather keeps up, I might not need to spend any money on tanning.  That would be bizomb.   Did you hear what I said?  Bizomb.  Yeah, that's what I said. Tonight is the Real World Chicago Reunion special.  Literally can't wait.  From the sounds of it, Kyle and Kera haven't grown up a bit since the show.  Kyle actually goes so far as to say the following:  "I do theater as well as weightlifting, sports, and other manly things."  Now I don't know what he is referring to (God hopes it's not that creepy/realistic performance of his in  The Cough ), but I do know that he is no way a MANLY man.  Weightlifting or not.  Kyle is the biggest gossiping bitch on the show and I think the world has already realized that as a man...Kyle knows not how to be.   What a fuck.  Don't destroy the name of theater people everywhere.   And Kera...shut the fuck up for once.  The funniest part of the preview, though, has to be when Kera says: "I never said that did I?" (referring to her statement of "I am going to land me a man").  The computerized voice goes "Yes you DID Kera."  I about shit myself.  If you even have computerized voices saying that you are a fuck...then guess what...you are a fuck! It will be sad to let this all go.  Chicago was one of my favorites.   OH MY GOD!  Have I seriously forgot to mention this???? I saw a preview this weekend on MTV that went a little something like this: Opening shot of the first NYC Real World house with one of the original people going: "NYC!" Then the commercial continues through every season with each picture being that of a season of the Real World.  But then...OMIGOD...then...right after "return to NY" and before "Chicago" is a picture of VANCOUVER with a big X over it.  After the commercial comes to a close...you hear this big whoosh and then "The Real World Movie: Vancouver, the Lost Season".   Coming in august, I think. UM!  Vancouver the lost season what??????????? I freaked!  I mean...fucking freaked! Who else is just as curious and excited???  ROCK!  Things like this make MTV the best network out there.  I fucking love those people, with their ingenious ideas and marketing tools.  It's enough to make Rita proud.

      I kept telling myself that the reason I have never been a  Blog of Note   is because I don't have fancy shmancy shit on my page.  But then...I find this  Blog of Note  today:  urlLink I mean, what?        It's not a BAD page, but it is no better then Penelope's or mine.  So what's the dilly blogger?  I said: What's the DILLY blogger?!?!?!?

      Three very important thoughts for you to think about: 1)  While I was outside, I saw an absolutely BEAUTIFUL blind girl with her ugly seeing boyfriend.  Now is that fair?   2)  Eminem has a song on his new album called "Hallies Song".  It's about his daughter and let me tell you something... I adore the song.  Not only is it about something of substance for once, but he SINGS on it.  I mean, REALLY tries to sing.  The song is flawless, like his others, but with this one...you can feel the emotion exuding off of it.  I'm telling you folks...3 good songs on the album and I am buying it.  It's my rule.   3)  I had a moment earlier when I felt really horrible for Doris.  Now, understandably, it is almost impossible to ever imagine such a thing as feeling sorry for dis beast, but I did and still do.  She has been screamed at, belittled, and stomped on all day.  Now, she DOES deserve it, but man!  These people have just pounced on her face all day.  Hmmmmm.....why does it bother me so?

      So I NEED to come up with a new theme to my blogger.  I am bored as shit with it.  I don't know what happened.  I just don't like it anymore.  Maybe I am just in a rut with it.  But honestly...do I need any more ruts in my life?  So if this thing just casually dies...let it.  Let it go in peace. We'll see... These are the highlights of the past week: 1)  Rita and Kelly left for their vacations!!!  I have the house all to myself, which has turned out to be a lot more misery than I thought.  Some days are amazing!  Some days make me really sad to have them gone.  Either way...I am trying my damndest to enjoy the time alone.  This kind of thing only comes once a year, so gotta try to love it.  :-/ 2)  The cat and I have become bosom buddies.  For the first two days, he completely ignored me.  Didn't even come out from his hiding places.  But then late on Saturday, I was crying like a pathetic loser and he came out from the closet and sat right on my lap.  Um what???  He has never done that before.  And it made me cry more.  He's a cute boy.  Since then, he won't leave me alone.  He follows me from room to room and is constantly in need of attention.  So am I...so it's a relationship based on a mutual affection.  Every morning at 5:00am, he walks into my room and screams his head off.  I don't know why.  I think because the sun is coming up at that point.  Either way...we go to bed together every night and every morning begins with me screaming at him to shut up.  Ahhh...the life of being married to a cat. 3)  Paul lost his job at Fridays.  Uh what?!?!?!  Right...he lost his job at Fridays.  This is what happened: Sunday night was very busy at the bar.  Paul was rushing around serving drink after drink after drink when suddenly this woman pulls him aside and asks for the manager.  Paul calls the manager up to the front bar and the lady proceeds to explain that she is with a "secret shopper program" and Paul didn't ID her.  The rule at Fridays is that if you don't ID someone, you are terminated on the spot.  (Kelly...it actually wasn't the BARS program...weird right?)  So...Paul was asked to not come in on Monday and received a phone call late last night informing him that he is fired.  UGH! He and I cried when we talked about it.  (I am an emotional wreck)  We came up with some ideas as to where he can apply for a new job.  We also discussed making arrangements for him to move to NYC as early as Oct. 1st!  WOW.  So there may be a dim light at the end of this tunnel.  He is a strong kid and he will get through it.  And there is still a chance that he will be allowed back at work.  But at this point...he doesn't want to go back there after all this.  I don't blame him. 4)  Yesterday I hated my job more than I have hated anything in my life.  I could have KILLED everyone.  So irritating and the project that Penelope and I are working on is so fucking awful, I don't even know where to begin.  UGGLES. Today at work has been MUCH better.  People are in better moods and Doris has fucked off completely.  I kind of let her have it at the end of yesterday.  Can't wait until 5pm. 5)  Hung out with Penelope on Friday night and had a blast.  As usual.  It was a late night and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  :-D 6)  My parents have returned from Germany with smiles and with safe travels.  The prayers have worked!  They had tons of stories to tell and have informed me that Rita will be going to see my brother on Friday.  How fucking cool is that.  VERY COOL. SO RJR just came by and was like: "You are typing fast, it must be good.  What are you doing?  What's Post to Cut the Shit?" I about die laughing that she actually asked and I told her the truth.  It's my personal and PRIVATE online journal.   She was like:  Great idea!  Why "Post to Cut the Shit?"  I go:  "Because I am a very mature 25 year old".   She smiles and walks away.  Ugh.  Oh and by the way RJR.  It's not called "Post to Cut the Shit".  Just "Cut the Shit".  You know...Cut__ The__Shit. and also...LOLOLOLOLOLOL. I saw about a hundred thousand movies this weekend.  Here is the list: Moulin Rouge (again) A Knight's Tale Dude, Where's my Car? The Royal Tennenbaums Rollerball Dick Tracy Night of the Living Dead Shrek (whatever you do...don't even bother with  Rollerball .  Damn that shit was awful.   Tennenbaums ...amazingbaums!) (oooh!  Just so you all know...RCS and jaba are SCREAMING at doris right now.  I mean...SCREAMING!!!!!  I have no idea why...but it is fucking intense.  Now Doris is BUGGING!  Now they are bugging back.  Man...wish I could hear what they are saying!) In any case...bored now.  This journal writing aint so bad.  Maybe I won't kill it afterall.   I'll think about it. Hey...anyone want RITAS next week?  I do!  I do! PEAYCE! RCS has said: "Let me RE-ITERATE" about a hundred times, each time growing louder and louder and louder.  They are all yelling at the same time.  If Doris don't come out of this meeting in tears...then I swear, it's true.  She has no heart at all.

      So I am writing in here for my poor little souls who are stuck working in the Hillel and aren't lucky enough to sit at home and stew like I am.  I have a headache.  A headache that hasn't quit for days.  But even bigger than my headache is the work ache that I get when I sit around and think about it.  I hate my job for the last couple of days.  I don't know if it is my sickness...but either way...I am so tired of my hum-drum life at the Jewish agency that is my demise.  I am tired.  I am sick and I am bored.  All I have been saying lately is that I am "bored".  What has happened?  Am I actually getting itchy despite my perfect, non-important, EASY life?   I had an INCREDIBLE birthday.  Everyone did what they could to make it exceptional...and let me say...it was one of the best times of my life.  At one point...Kelly noticed that I hadn't even begun to start drinking and she says: "Joe...I don't know what to do with you ...drink!"  It's just that I felt a NATURAL high that I haven't felt in so long.  I was happy.  Just plain happy to be alive and to have my friends be everything to me that I needed them to be.  I felt special for the day.  I felt happiness pure and true.  My friends did that for me.  I had Penelope, Mariah, Kelly, Rita, Angie...all in the same place for the same reason...me!   I will write more about my day when my head doesn't hurt so bad. Man...it was just about the best. Boston was perfect.  Will write more about that later as well.  But to be honest.. Paul may not know how to give gifts...as will be explained later...but he is so in love with me and that means more than any present he could give.  The kid literally would do anything just to see me smile.  He LOVES me.  How weird is it to be so loved by someone?   Very fucking weird.   He loves me.  I want to write it a thousand times.  He loves me like no one has ever loved me.  A very pure and real love .  A love that is honest and jealous.  A blatant and true love.  Man...I lucked out with this one.   Headache... I have the day off tomorrow because I feel like garbage.  Why am I even writing in this?  Prolly cuz of boredom and because I want to communicate with my co-worker Penelope.  I am hanging with her this weekend.  I hope she will have me over. Rita and Kelly are off on vacation for a week and I will be all alone.   I went on and on about how excited I am to be alone and to do what I want to do...but to be honest...I am a little sad.  I will be alone and lonely.  Penelope...get ready for some Joe time.  Mariah is out of town in Cape Cod.  Joe is home, alone, sad, and relying on the only friend he has.  Don't get me wrong...I LOVE hanging with P.  She is bomb shit and I would chill with her anyway...regardless of vactations...but still....she is going to have to work overtime to keep my emotions in check.  I NEED her next week.  NEED.  :( Love me k? Head pounding...must leave computer...I love you all. thank you for being my fwiend.  I appreicate all of you.  Sorry my head hurts. Snarf.

      So the day continues... For lunch, Kelly and Rita took me to a Psychic to get my palm read.  Her name was Tina and she had itty bitty brown teeth.  At first, she was really intense and I bought into everything she was saying.  She told me that my Aura was very dark right now due to the lack of support that I have with my friends.  Also that my close circle was really jealous of me, etc.  She told me that I need to pull away from these people in order to succeed in my chosen career, etc.  Then she goes: "Do you have a question for me?" I say: "What can I do to get my positive Aura back?"   She says:  "Well, you need to give me $190 for these purple crystals.  9 of them to be exact."  Idiot me gives her $1.90.  She about bursts into laughter and says: "No.  $190.  I take checks, cash, etc."  I say: "I don't have that kind of money on me."  Tina proceeds to ask me if my friends have the money.  In my head I am thinking...My friends ain't gonna give me $190 for crystals just so that I can turn around and tell them that Tina says that they are jealous of me and hate me deep down.  Craziness, right? I leave her apartment and try to hunt down Kelly and Rita so that we can jump on a subway and get away without paying this loon.  Unfortunately, the devil herself aka Tina, found us on the street and got her money.  She turned to me, baring those beautiful, pearly browns and said: "Now remember...don't tell your friends about this reading.  Keep it to yourself."  "Oh, and call me when you have the money."  Right Tina...in fact...I will write over my birthday checks to you.  :-D But thank you to Kelly for this unforgettable experience.  In fact, Tina said to me over and over "You will never forget me."  She was right...I will laugh from today until forever about how ridiculous you are lady.   When I returned to work, I was so overjoyed to find a HUGE bouquet of flowers from Paul.  THEY ARE AMAZING!  He did such a wonderful job picking them out and it makes me feel good.  He always comes through.  But why does he have to be such a prick first?  I'll never know. I also got cards from everyone I work with, as well as a GORGEOUS (german for awesome) photo album, and two blocks of cheese from my lady friend, one miss Angela.  Everyone took such good care of me and that makes my heart swell to about 3 times its original size.  As we know...I can be grinchy, but today...I am just happy. In other news...Angie called me today to say happy birthday.  I was dreading talking to her, but once on the phone...damn I miss her.  I try to shut the door on her face every day, but somehow she always makes it back in.  She is an incredible girl with the best of intentions.  It's just that sometimes she does some really shitty things.  I don't know.  I do hope she can make it out tonight. I realized today that there are all GIRLS going out with me for my birthday.  Not one gent.  For real?  Have I really turned into that guy?  I guess I have always been that guy, but wow.  I need some male companionship.  Sometimes.  For the most part...I love being friends with girls.  They are so much more fun.  But I would like to have a guy go out with us just so that he can protect us from harm.  HAHAHAHAHA. That's what Rita's boyfriend will do when he gets here.  Protect all of us ladies.  :-D Today has been a beautiful day from beginning to end.  It's how birthdays should go.  I love everyone in my life and am so grateful for everything that was done for me today.   And the day has only just begun.   This week is bomb.  I tried to write every little detail in here so that I wouldn't forget a thing.  Ever. (Big sigh of love)

      WOW.  So if it weren't for Paul, this day would be going perfectly.  :( He is just so weird and wasn't as nice on the phone as I hoped he would be.  But I am going to force that out of my head and focus on everything else thats good today.  Ugh.  He just sets me back and that is so unfair.  I would rather not talk to him at all then talk to him and have him be an asshole. Anyway...Since this morning, I had a 30 minute talk with my brother that was wonderful!  I talked to my dad, my mom, and Mariah.  Then Kelly's sister Aly, Im'ed me to wish me a happy birthday.  :-D THEN...I get this voice message on the work answering machine from Kelly's parents saying "Happy Birthday" and some other really nice things.  It was so great!  Having all of these people say and do this makes me feel so loved and happy.  We all need a day like this every once in awhile.  Just reminds you that people really do care about you and that you aren't as alone as you would think.  Thank you everyone.  Thank you so so much. Thank you for making up for my boyfriend.  :( One should always be able to count on their friends to make up for other things.  And I am blessed to have an incredible group of them here in this city.   Leaving in about 10 minutes with Rita to go meet Kelly for the first part of the day!  YAY!   I never want this day to end.  Never.   :(

       TODAY IS MY 25th BIRTHDAY!  TODAY IS MY FUCKING BIRTHDAY!  YAY!  It's weird when you wake up on the day of your birthday.  Everything seems different.  Good different, but different nonetheless.  As soon as my eyes opened I thought, WOW!  I am 25 years old today.  And it feels good!  I feel older and more mature.  Not that a night's sleep will do that.  I was talking to Rita last night about how it sucks to keep getting older.  But today, I feel good.  I am actually happy that I am 25.  Maybe I worried too much about being this age in the past and now I have just come to accept it.  I mean, of course, there are things I want to change...such as my career, financial status, etc.  But for today...I am thrilled to be 25.  And I am thrilled to still look like I am 18.  I guess the days are coming when I am going to have to capatilize on that theory.  I remember all of these people saying to me: "You look so young...you will love that when you get older".  Well, now I am older and I do in fact love that. So here is what I have done on my birthday so far: Did my normal routine and then while I sat and smoked my cigarette before work, I opened the the birthday cards that I received thus far.  I got one from my uncles, one from my granny, one from Rita, one from Rita's sister Jeannie.  I have to admit...up until this point...Jeannie's card is by far my favorite.  I loved yours too Reets.  But Jeannie...damn that shit be funny.  I laughed out loud and then hugged the card to my chest.   Ok, I didn't quite hug the card to my chest...that would be queer, right?  Thank you for thinking of me.  :-D (picture one lone tear rolling down my face...but a tear of happiness) After opening my cards, I had a moment of sadness.  I don't know why.  Sometimes when I get really happy, something in me slaps me in the gut and makes me sad.  I don't know.  It's on days like today that I miss my brother alot and also my grandmother.  Weird huh?  It kinda just creeps up on you.  But it will be a good day and I know that they are both here with me in spirit and I will do my best to get in touch with that today.  :) What else was weird...no one on the subway seemed to know it was my birthday.  No one offered me a seat or even said "Happy Birthday".  Assholes.   When I got to work, everyone was so adorable.  They all wished me a good day and I got cards and hugs!  It was really wonderful.  Rita had breakfast ready, hot, and waiting at my desk for me.  She is so good to me!  Especially since when I was on my way in, I almost bought a Vitamin Water, but thought...I will wait until someone runs out for coffee.  Then I came in and my favorite flavor was sitting at my desk.  MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM. At 1:40pm, I leave for lunch for the first phase of the day.  Kelly will be waiting at 92nd street for Rita and I.  What could it be?  I am really excited about today.   Also!  When I was like 2 years old, my dad bought me a little kid record with the "Birthday Song" on it.  It goes like this: "My name is Zoom and I live on the moon...I just came down to sing you this tune...hey Joe...it's your birthday...TODAY!"   Every year since I was two years old, he has either played the record for me or sang it to me on the phone.  This year, I came into work to find that he had faxed the song to me.  :-D  HOW CUTE IS HE!?!?!?!  I was wondering if this year was going to go by without the song.  Man...he is such an incredible person.  So thoughtful and so great.  He helped to start my day on such a beautiful note.  Thank you dad. AND! My room is officially set-up and perfect.  I spent two more hours on it last night redecorating and organizing the shit on my walls.  Then I just sat and stared at my new place.  I love the way it came out.  There is tons of stuff to look at and it feels like home now.  It is mine and I am so happy it is done.  Thank you again Kelly for getting this started for me.  You did so much hard work and got my ass in gear.  You are the best. Ok...that's it for now.  Will report back with more later!

      So I went to the park today on my lunch break even though it was overcast and muggy.   I don't know if it is because my birthday is tomorrow or what, but the sky opened up for about a half hour today and I was able to bake myself.  It's like God said, in a big booming voice, "Hello Joe.  Whaddya know?  Here is some tan".  I gladly accepted the gift, and maybe even got a smidge of color.  Yeah...a smidge.   It's almost time to go home.  Lucky me doesn't have to tutor today.  Ok...I shouldn't really be saying lucky me...it was supposed to be my first day.  Oh well.  It's just that I want to spend the whole week doing what I want to do and none of it doing what anyone else wants to do.  Sounds fair right?   Did you know that once you turn 25 years old...you get to slap each of your friends in the mouth?  It's like this swedish tradition.  Tomorrow...everyone I see gets a slap right on their lips.  Better watch out for me. Ever wonder why people even celebrate birthdays?  If so, click on this to learn the truth:  urlLink History of Birthdays  Ok...time to go plan more things for my vacation. With the amount of activities I have researched, Paul and I are going to have about 5 seconds of free time.  And that's if we don't sleep or have sex. oh god...am I really having sex with him in Florida. yes Yes I am.

      When I walked out of the house this morning, I was unplesantly surprised to find Fuckface getting something out of a car in front of our house.  As I walked by, he shut the door and we said "Hi" and both turned to walk to the subway together.  I was fully ready to suck it up and deal with it, knowing that we would have to walk and talk, but then, he took a step behind me and I just walked ahead.  He walked about 10 feet behind me for the entire time and then ran into me at the metro pass machine.  It was all pretty humerous and thank God that I look good today.  I was like "eh...see ya fuckface".  It's not bad being put into uncomfortable situations if you just remain calm and make the other person look like an asshole.   Works really well actually. :-D

      Shit. I have a lot to write today.  I might have to do this in installments.  You see...the whole thing started when I got home on Friday.  The birthday festivities officially began and they ain't gonna stop until this Friday.  I love a week full of birthday.  It is just about the best week of the year. My parents were so excited to have me home.  We drank tons of wine, smoked a LOT of pot and opened my birthday gifts right from the beginning.  They were really generous with me this year.  When I mentioned that to them, they were like "You are 25!  It's a big birthday!"  (Secretly I think they just feel sorry for my poor ass, but hey...I'll take it)  I showed them my headshots and they went on and on and on.  My dad started to cry, my mom held my hand and we all just sat there feeling and knowing that this is all starting right now.  Wow. After the drinking and board games, we ate tacos (my favorite food to eat at home) and I literally passed out in my bed at 2:30am with the tv on.  I was expecting to stay up a bit by myself and chill, but that was a fruitless effort. Saturday, my mom took me to get a one hour full body massage.  At first, I was terrified and totally skeptical.  I had never done this type of thing before and I was very uncomfortable with having to take my clothes off.  ALL my clothes off.   I met the nice lady before she did the massage and she made me feel so comfortable.  (My mom had said that it would work out cuz the massage therapist was incredible--and that she was!) The room was dim, I was naked under a sheet, some type of Japanese music was playing in the background, and she began rubbing my shit down.  IT WAS FUCKING AWESOME.  The first five minutes were definitely weird.  Especially when she put her hands on my ass.  But eventually, you have to just let go.  I was on another planet for the entire hour.  In fact, it went by so fast that I about shit myself when she told me to put on my clothes and meet her outside.  (P.S. Don't REALLY shit yourself while naked under a sheet.  Massage therapists don't like that.) When I walked out of the room, my head was buzzing and cloudy and I literally stumbled out of the building.  No, I really STUMBLED out of the building.  I felt like I had just done an excessive amount of drugs.  It was pretty awesome.  I have never been that relaxed in my life and hells if I am not counting the days until I get to do it again.  Unfortunately, it costs like $65 for a professional massage, so this can't be an addiction type activity.  I am going to have to space out my need for full naked rubdowns.  But if you get the chance...GO!  Everyone is uncomfortable with the body image thing...but once you let go...I am telling you...it's like nothing else. After that, my mom took me on a shopping spree for summer clothes.  She got me tons of shit, including new kicks, and 3 new necklaces.  3!  Memble last week how I had no necklaces??  Well, now I have 3.  :-D And I love them all! Following the shopping extravaganza of my life, my parents took me out to dinner at the Old Country Buffet.  Yes, it was my choosing to go there.  I got real stoned before we left, with my parents knowing and loving it  (my dad especially thinking it was cool--???), and then proceeded to eat my face off.  I mean EAT MY FACE OFF.  At one point, the "waitress" brought me over a new face and asked me politely not to do that again.   The one thing that shocked me a little was the clientele at this place.  We were there at 4pm, but let's talk about scumbags... I mean, it's not there fault...it's $7 all you can eat and that is an affordable meal for extremely overweight, poor black folk.  ;) When I was up getting my salad, this little black girl was standing next to me sucking down jello cubes of some sort and wiping her smeary nasty hands on the sneeze guard.  I burst into laughter, avoided the pasta salad and went back to the table.   If you think about it...it is very rare that we are ever in the type of establishment that these type of people are.  Even in NYC.  I am not saying that I am Mr. Class or that I have all the money in the world (haha), but damn these people were like used to feeding in troughs outside of their barn!   Once dinner was over, we all went home for an hour nap and then off to the Saratoga Race Track.  We went for the Harness racing, which if you don't know, is smaller horses that run around a mile long track with little chariots tied to their backs.  The jockeys ride back there and the whole thing is just great!  I mean...you gotta feel bad for the horses, but after 4 beers, I swear I saw the horses smiling that they were getting whipped in the ass.   After the first race, one of the horses wouldn't stop running crazily around the track.  The jockey was thrown from the little chariot thing and the horse bolted towards the fence surrounding the track.  People were trying to wave down the horse, there is a woman on a horse trying to get this crazy steed under control, but to no avail.  The horse jumps the fence, smashing the chariot into a billion pieces and takes off out of the raceway.  Where did he end up?  Probably shot to death in the parking lot. :( I don't know what was scarier...when the horse went running away, or when everyone in the crowd was like "Oh God.  Someone help! BLAH BLAH YIPES!" No...someone actually said: "Blah Blah Yipes!"   That person was a jackass. Overall...the time at the racetrack was probably my favorite.  I had such an incredible time with my parents.  We just joke around and laugh and make fun of everyone and its all so great.  They took such wonderful care of me this weekend and I am so happy to have them.  My mom did about 80 pounds of laundry for me, they gave me the money to get my headshots reproduced (although I told them it was a loan and that I would give them the money in August.), and they did whatever I wanted to do with no complaints. It was perfect. Wednesday evening, they leave to go spend a week or two with my brother in Germany.  They are psyched and I am psyched for them.  I talked to my brother quite a bit in the last couple of days and he is thrilled to have them come.  For once HE is going to be the only brother in the family.  ;) SO THEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I come home from the weekend to find the most INCREDIBLE BIRTHDAY PRESENT EVER!  Kelly, while I was gone, completely rearranged my room and made it beautiful!  I mean...she TOTALLY gave my room an OVERHAUL!  My jaw hit the floor when I saw it and I think I stood in the center of it speechless for a good 20 minutes.   I was a little nervous at first cuz there is so much space in there now.  I thought that she just took a huge garbage bag and dumped it all in the trash.  But she didn't.  ;) It definitely took a little while to get used to, but I immediatly got down to business on fixing it up the way I want it.  I needed this push and Kelly new that.  She DID this for me.  She worked so hard and I will never forget this for as long as I live.   It looks so good.  I am going to re-do the walls tonight and make it exactly the way I want it.  Then, after a year and a half of being here, my room will be done!  I am seriously overjoyed by this whole thing.  I woke up this morning and let out a yelp of glee.  It's like a brand new place and it looks so fucking good.  For the first time since I graduated college, I have a slamming room again.  :-D Thank you Kelly.  I can't say it enough.  What you did was the nicest thing anyone has done for me in so long.  It is...damn.   It means so much. Now...on to the rest of the week of birthday!  Tomorrow is the actual day when I will turn 25!  Ugh!  But ROCK!  I am not dreading the age thing at all.  It's nice having Rita turn the year older first, cuz then I can warm up to it a bit before I do.  I have no idea what my friends are planning, but I am so fucking excited.  At one point, there was a grilled cheese restaurant involved.  But that has since been nixed due to my peeking eyes.  HEEHEEHEEHEEHEEHEEHEE! I wonder what is going on!?!?!?!  Unfortunately Paul will not be attending.  That hurts.  He and I have had some ok conversations lately, but there is always this underlying disappointment on my part.  I am sad that he is not going to be in town, but I understand.  I leave for Boston on Wed., so it's not that I won't get to spend any time with him.  It just sucks that I won't be able to have everyone I know and love at the same place on the same night.  And if he does surprise me and show up, I will probably punch him in the face for playing this stupid "I am going to tell you I am not coming and then come" game.  I hate that game. BUT!  I am very excited to do it up with my friends without having to worry about any of the bullshit that goes along with Paul.  I can be myself and get trashed and not worry if I end up finding some guy on the street that wants his dick sucked.  :-D Too bad I have to work at all this week.  I shouldn't complain.  I have wed-fri. off, but still...don't want to be here at all.  And I am supposed to go to lunch with my boss today, but going to try my damndest to get out of that one.  Just don't want to do it is all. Only want to sit back, accept gifts, and wear my new clothes.  That sounds like the perfect birthday plan to me.   YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAY!

      THE VMA'S! ROCK.  Rita and I sat through the entire show, commenting, dissecting, and in some parts...loving!  Kelly was able to get out of work a little earlier than was originally expected and came home to join us for the last hour. The man of the evening...JUSTIN TIMBAHLAKE!  FUCKING ROCKED!  I am telling you...this kid is going to blow up!  You thought he was in your face before...just wait until the aftermath of his performance last night.   I am proud to say that this 25 year old gay man is in LOVE with Justin.  His moves, his voice, his style.  He is my man.  I am so impressed by him.  Best part of the show for me...hands down. Also, Pink pulled off quite a stellar performance last night.  Usually she pisses me off, but last night, both Rita and I sat and stared wide eyed with our eyes open.  She was pretty great.  Specially when she said:  "I think I am too drunk to accept this award right now."  Um. Eminem...LOVE YOU.  Really have been enjoying him.  He does seem a bit angry, eh?  "I have no problem hitting a girl with glasses..." I do believe he deserved his awards.  The guy works hard and his music is real.  Very pleased with him last night. Britney Spear's...dressed in her most beautiful "gay man going to a night out at the leather bars" outfit.  Goodnight sweet lady.  get some rest. Joey Fatone was like seeing a lost cousin of mine.  I wonder if Rachel was at home visualizing his dick in her mouth.   He is nast.   Jimmy Fallon...had great moments and horrible moments.  Overall...I didn't like him.  I don't want to slam him because he is a sweet little guy that means really well AND there were moments when I genuinely laughed at him.  But overall...he was flat.  Not enough life to him.  Maybe not his scene really. Guns and Roses what??? Nuff said. Avril sucked.  No Doubt took home 2 very unexpected awards.   Limp Bizkit was amazing! SIKE Great show.  Glad I saw it last night so that I don't have to watch it again.  Although we all know MTV will have it on repeat until the year 2005.   Tonight Rita and I head off to the Pocono's to see our girls.  Very very excited about this.  I hope it goes smoothly and that everyone gets along like the olden days.  Weird to go back in time.   Kelly is unable to breathe and has some sort of respiratory problem.  She will be going to the doctor today and then heading off to Albany this weekend.  I wonder if she will go to the gay bars while she is there.  ;) All in all, this weekend should be fun for the three of us.   Very much looking forward to having Monday off from work.  Plan to sleep as late as humanely possible.  What is THAT like? Hope everyone is doing well.  Wish I could write in more detail about last night's awards show, but I have to do some actual work. Ugh. Sorry for the bland, no content filled entry. Will be back with my sarcastic self next week. Latas!

      It's the end of the day as I know it....and I - feel -  fucking great! YAY! The day is done done done!  In fact, the week is done done done.  Got to work 4 hours tomorrow and then I am off for a 3 day weekend.  Thank the Lord for Labor's Day.  Well, and also thank the laborers for whom without, none of this would be possible. VMA's tonight kids!  Make sure to catch the one and only Timbahlake!  He will steal the show.  I just know it!   Gonna go home, pour me a glass of wine, do some shit around the house, and then settle in for what I hope is going to be a good show.  Jimmy Fallon...good luck my friend.  You are hot.  You are from my hometown.  You best rock out. It's rainy.  Everyone go home, pour yourself a beverage of choice, curl up in a blanket, and flip on MTV for the rest of the evening. (I just farted) hope no one catches it. gotta sneak away now. Calmly and casually...

      So last night I had the pleasure of catching up on some  Sex and the City .  It was excellent.  I was very disappointed by the first two episodes this season, but now I feel like they have found their stride once again.  Great.  Just in time for the last two episodes.  And BIGGIE will be back next week!  ROCK!  I about jizzed when I saw his adorable little face. In the episode I saw last night, Miranda stole the show.  Well, Samantha was pretty funny too.  Charlotte annoyed and Carrie was so incredibly self-absorbed.  I kind of understood her position of feeling as though everything is changing around her, but honestly...she talked about herself the entire time and never gave anyone, including Sanford, a moment to open up to her.  Finally he yelled at her and I think maybe she got the hint.   What is the deal with her this season? Overall, I loved the episode and I laughed and laughed at certain parts.  If you ever happen to miss a week, contact Ari.  She relayed one of the scenes to me and she got it almost verbatim.  No.  She DID get it verbatim.  She is great with that stuff.  But also...don't let her even start if you want the surprise of the episode.  As I just said, this girl can quote an episode of anything...VERBATIM.   It's pretty great. I also watched some of the  Teen Miss Usa Pagent .  Snores. I saw some of Gwenyth on Jules Asshole's  Revealed .    And I watched  American Idol .  Best episode thus far.  I have to admit...I just adore Kelly Clarkson.  She is by far the most talented and will hopefully win this competition.  Her voice gives me chills.  Last night, I almost lost it when she re-sang "Without You" by Mariah.  She sang it on Tuesday night and it was mediocre.  Last night was an explosive performance by her.   Nikki McKibbin...see ya.  Nikki knew she was going and she should have gone!  But it was sad to see her go.  Simon mentioned to her, right before the announcement of who got cut, that Nikki doesn't deserve to be in the finals.  Her face fell and she was totally crushed.  He embarrassed her hardcore.  Then I felt bad too.   But whatever!  See you later Stevie Nicks/PINK wannabe.   :( Justin Guarini...if his face doesn't crack wide open from his ridiculous smile...I may drive out to Hollywood and smash him in the mouth.  He annoys.  He so annoys that it drives me CUHRAZY! Alright...time to go take a shit. Then to eat some soup. Then to take a shit again. And hopefully by the end of all that, work will be over. Horribly productive day I got goin!

      The Poll has spoken!  Most voted for me to tell a  Crazy, but TRUE Story...  It was a steaming Thursday evening.  I was standing on the underground subway platform at 96th street in NYC.  The humidity was forcing the sweat to run down my face, down my back, my legs, etc.  Everyone around me was moving very slowly and I could see the haze resting stagnantly in front of my eyes.   I slowly turn my head to the left to see if the subway was coming down the track, when I notice a HUGE hornet hovering in the air next to my face.  It was moving so slowly and kind of resting in the stale air that was consuming the entire underground area.  The hornet startles me cuz it is so close to my face, but then I start to laugh cuz it is moving SO SLOWLY!  As I go to turn my head away, this lazy hornet suddenly gets a burst of energy and lands directly on my left eyeball. I IMMEDIATLY FREAK!  I grab the bee off my eye and throw it towards the ground, all the while doing a little scardey-cat dance and shaking my body in massive convulsions.  People all around me were staring and laughing and I just kept shuddering. Eventually the subway came and I got on it.  I stood there, holding the pole, reminiscing about the horrifying experience I just had.  I look down at my shoes, pondering the moment, when I realize that the hornet it now sitting on my shirt staring at me with it's beady eyes.  Just staring at me!   Once again....I flip out, grab it off my shirt and throw it away from me.   Who knows where it ended up.   As long as it stopped stalking me!  ---end scene---

      Feeling a little bit better today.  My nose isn't as on fire as it has been during the last couple of days.  Got a lot of rest last night and Rita made me some soup just like she promised.  She served it to me in bed and it was AWESOME!  It was lentil, which I never liked in the past, but now am in love with it.  I think Rita puts some magical spice in everything she cooks, cuz all the stuff comes out tasting like Wolfgang Puck or some shit.   Thanks Reets!  You helped me to get a little bit better. So I am supposed to start dog sitting tomorrow night, but it turns out that the dog is menstruating all over the place.  "Missy", the dog, is now wearing a diaper and it must be changed before she goes out on her walk.  SICK!  I don't do that.  And I KNOW Kelly don't do that.  So I have told the people that she and I will not be dog sitting this weekend.  EWE!  I can't believe this lady hasn't had her dog spade.  I mean...it's bleeding out of it's vergina for god's sakes!   And yes...I meant to type "vergina". This weekend, Rita and I head to the Pocono's to have a weekend romp with our lady friends from college.  While these 4 girls are Rita and my best friends from way back, it will definitly not be a weekend of total exuberance.   Did that make sense? There will be drama.  There will be laughs, prolly some tears.  It will be overwhelming.  That's for sure.  I am excited about it.  I really am.  But I am NOT going swimming.  There is a lake and a pool and I have made Rita promise me that she nor I will go swimming.  If she decides to break the promise, I have to make out with our friend, Jessica.  I think it's a fair deal.  I mean, Jessica is one hot piece of ass. (snicker snicker) We have told the girls that we can't stay until Monday, cuz Kelly has her graduation party that day.  hahaha.  We lie.  We just wanted to have one day to sleep!  I mean...August has been the absolute craziest month of our lives!  Neither she nor I have had a moment's peace.  Every weekend has been filled with either visits out of the city or events in the city.  It's been great, but a bit much.  Just think Reets...next weekend will be free and clear!  For the most part. Paul is supposed to come down and visit me and I am very excited to see his little face.  As I wrote on Monday, we had an incredible weekend together and it definitly helped to spark the passion between us a bit more.   Well, actually, the sex was blah, but the connection we had was great. Long story and way too personal to get into here. Last night I watched  American Pop Idol .    The show blows.  It really does.  2 of the 3 that are left suck my dick.  I do enjoy Kelly.  I think she is phenomenally talented and definitly has a bright career in front of her.  But AMERICAN POP IDOL?  I don't think so.  I think that maybe we are done with Pop Idols for a little while.  Society is moving towards R & B or music with an edge - hence Nicklesnore, Puddle of Snore, and Avril LaSnore.   I do enjoy the premise of  American Pop Idol .  What I don't like are the stupid skits they do, the constant judges bickering, and the annoying children that are screaming the entire time.  Does anyone else understand what I am getting at?  I don't want to be a negative nancy about all of this...but if Dunkleman doesn't go away forever, I will be forced to remove him myself.  I also happened to catch the  Diary of the VMA Superstars  on MTV.  Justin TimbAHlake will be making his first solo performance tomorrow night at the VMA's.  GOD!  Could this kid GET any more beautiful?!?!?!  There is just something about him that makes me wet myself whenever he is on the tube.  He is, obviously, attractive, he is smooth, he is cool, and above all else, he is fucking funny and adorable.  I just love him.  I will immediatly buy his cd, and like the giddy 15 year old girl that I am, I might even buy a poster of him to put above my canopy bed.   Ah the dreams I will have... He's the fucking best. Too bad Joey Fatone is busy getting his dick sucked by my friend Rachel.  He could have been performing at the VMA's too, but he is too horny for his own good.  Way to go Sexaholic!  I have a question... Could the 3 gigantic pimples I have on my face go away now?   If it's not too much to ask. I weighed myself this weekend while I was in P-town and was shocked to find out that I tip the scales at 180#!   FUCK YEAH! I weigh as much as my boyfriend now.  WHOOPS!   I say to Paul: "Holy shit!  I thought I was at like 155#." Paul: "No Joe.  You haven't been near that for 3 years!" Thanks Paul. Douche. It's a good thing I have an overly attractive face.  ;) but not really ;) I like being bigger, but I would also like to see my abs at some point before I am fitty. And by fitty, I mean 50. Alright...I guess that is it. peace jiggas! If you are bored and want to read about how awful it is to ride the NYC subways,  click  urlLink here  This is another link that Ari sent me, but I haven't even seen what it is yet.  I may be taking a risk by just plugging it in here, but I trust her judgement.  urlLink WHAT COULD THIS BE?  Also...I just started  The Lovely Bones  by Alice Sebold today.  I am only on page 30, but tears have pricked at my eyes twice already.  It's a beautiful book.  I can just tell. Rita has already read it.  I am next and then Kelly.  After we have all finished it, we are having a book club meeting to discuss it.  How fun, right?   Our next book is for Halloween!  Does anyone have a SCARY book that they can suggest?  It has to be one that none of us have read and with me being the connosiurereoai (that is supposed to be connosewer) of horror books, I need to know of one that may not be that popular.   Also...on Halloween night, after we do something incredibly fun of course, Kelly and I are going to show Rita  The Rocky Horror Picture Show  movie on VH1.  She has never seen it!  Kelly and I created the tradition of watching it on Halloween last year.  How fun, right? Last year, Kelly and I went to the restaurant she was working at at the time (Park Avalon) and got drinks.  We also got these little cookies.  Do you remember Kel?  The one of the pumpkin and the one of the American Flag (post 9/11 cookie).  We had a great time and went home, ordered dinner and watched the movie together.  Of course singing along the entire time. It was probably one of the best nights Kelly and I had last year.  It was seriously fun. So this year...big plans!  :-D K...now that is it for real. barp.

      YES! Time to go home!  I am immediately putting my nose in a bucket of epson salt or something when I get to my house.  It burns like nobody's bihness!  Does anyone have a remedy or an idea as to how to soothe my burning nose?   I would greatly appreciate any and all help. Rita has offered to make me lentil soup cuz I feel like shit.  We are going to get some juice and fresh bread on the way home and then she is going to tuck me into my bed and serve me, slave style.   She is a good friend to offer to take care of my grump ass.   Well, I am a good friend for eating her out every night before she goes to sleep. And I hate pussy. Whatevs. Either way I get soup.

      What the fuck is wrong with my head? I don't understand it.  I must have some sort of serious sinus infection.  It has been bothering me all summer and it just won't go away.  I am at the point where I am considering lopping off my nose, digging my fingers around in there, and cleaning out all the shit that is driving me to the point of insane.  I don't have a badly stuffed up nose.  I have this constant tingling and itchiness that makes my eyes water, my nose spray, and my head fuzzy.  Can it go away now please?   I took some Robitussin this am.  Robi-my ass.   Tonight there is a free concert downtown.  Moby and Our Lady Peace are playing.  OUR LADY PEACE!!!!!!!!!! I have yet to see them live and tonight was to be the night.  But now I feel like shit and I don't know if I should go.  I am off to the Pocono's this weekend to see some friends that I haven't seen in years.  Must be in tip top shape for that.  So it might be another night laying in bed and wishing I was dead. Drop Dead Fred. Now THAT is classic. Kisses and a tit grab to Phoebe Cates. Let's see... Thanks to those commenting on my site.  Looking forward to Thursday when I will be doing an entry based on the verdict of my latest pole.  Kind of exciting.  So I hear that there is this blog party on September 20th.  Does anyone actually go to that?  I think it could be kind of cool.  As long as I do what Ari says and not tell anyone who I am.   YEAH RIGHT!  I want them to all know who I am.   I am Joe Cut the Shit.   LOL. bullshit. Last night I watched a movie called  Jakob the Liar  starring one Robin Williams. It sucked. honestly, it was shit.  I hate saying that about a movie based on one of the most horrible tragedies of our time, but still.  Guys, it blew. Usually I like Robin Williams.  But in this, he was kinda snores.  And the plot line of the movie, while rather cute, was dumb. Watch  Bamboozled  instead.  Now that shit rocked! What else, what else... my nose is burning! I think I will be taking a nap during lunch today.  Must kick the shit out of this nose bullshit.   Sorry to keep complaining about it, but really, it's not good.  If it keeps up, I feel that my nose will rot off my face in   urlLink Cryptkeeper Style  Check that out!  It says "Boils and Ghouls!"

      Here is the story... Mariah and her best friend Rachel go to see  RENT  last Wednesday night for Rachel's birthday.  As we know, Joey Fatone, of NYSYNC fame, is starring in the show.  Rachel and Mariah wait after the show to meet him and to give him some special love.  Unfortunatly, they weren't able to meet him at first because there were thousands of little girls screaming and yelling and going crazy.  As Joey makes his way to his car, he waves at Mariah and Rachel and drives off.   Kind of disappointed, the girls leave the show and go to a club called Suede.   While there, Joey Fatone walks in the front door, notices them and comes over to hang out with them for awhile.  SERIOUSLY.  Joey Fatone, and his semi-annoying entourage, hung with Rachel and Mariah all evening.  Then, P-Diddy's mother stopped by for a few drinks and Mariah goes up to her and is like "Girl, you look good!"  P-Diddy's mom loved Mariah and talked to her for awhile.  Eventually, the club is closing and Joey asks the manager of the club if he can use it for about an hour.  The guy says "Sure" and everyone leaves the club.  Mariah waits outside while Joey eats Rachel's pussy and in return gets a quick blow.  When asked about Joey Fatone's dick, Rachel comments: "Joe...it was a SUPERSTAR penis!  It smelled good, tasted good, and looked good!" I barfed, but was also totally excited for her. After this, Joey drops them off at their apartment, promising to call. And he actually does! Joey Fatone calls Rachel on Thursday morning and makes plans to go to lunch with her and Mariah.  Of course, the douchebag doesn't pick them up at their apartment, and forces them to trek all the way to this dink pizzaria in the dredges of Brooklyn.  Whatever, pizza went well, they had some funny conversations, and Joey LIKE A PERFECT GENTLEMAN FOR ONCE, drops them off at their place. Friday night, he calls Rachel again to hangout.  UM! He mentioned something about being at the VMA'S this Thursday.  IMAGINE IF RACHEL GOT TO GO!?!?!?! Will definitely keep you all updated.  It is very rare that a celebrity, no matter how nasty, hooks up with someone we all know. If you want more stories, or to see pictures of the whole event...talk to Mariah.   Ask her about "Doey". She will die laughing.

      Home from the weekend!  And of course, back at work.  I got in so late last night that I had to crash at Mariah's.  It was fun, but so exhausting.  I haven't been home since Thursday.  It will feel so good to get into my house and collapse on my bed tonight.  It's also the only night this week in which I have nothing to do.  ARGH!  But also good I guess. So the weekend was fantastic.  Everything up until Provincetown on Friday was snores, so I will start with that. Paul, Mariah and I got to Cape Cod at about 11:30pm on Friday and immediately drove to P-town for Carnivale!  It was wonderful!  We had tons of drinks, got to go to a bunch of different bars, met some cool gay people, and did it up!  The three of us always have a great time together and it was nice being with them for the night.  (everyone else stayed back at the beach house, cuz they were boresville) Provincetown is adorable.  I find out that Provincetown is actually quite large, but Provincetown CENTER is where all the gays are.  It's a small area, but so fun.  And people are just packed in like cattle.  I would LOVE to spend a summer there, living the gay life, working, and just hanging out.  It was seriously fun.  Paul and I were able to hold hands and kiss and walk around all romantic-like with no fear of getting the shit kicked out of us. Friday night ended with the three of us staying up until 5am and partying like the rock stars we are. Saturday morning, Paul and I drove into P-town to go to lunch, sit on the beach, and do some shopping.  It was amazing.  We got along very well, which was a nice change, ate like a couple of hoss's, and talked talked talked.  It was beautiful. Around 5pm, we drove back to the beach house, took quick naps, ate another GIGANTIC dinner, and drank the night away.  Mariah's girlfriend "Marisa" had a bunch of friends there, who don't know that she nor Mariah is gay, and that kind of sucked.  Whatever, they were bitches and we ignored them the whole time anyway.  Paul and I did meet a couple cool people and the people we already knew were fun to be around.  But for the most part, he and I had an incredibly romantic weekend together. I loved being with him.  LOVED it. We had some amazing talks and I think we are doing better than we ever have.  It's weird.  He and I go up and down all the time.  But after the week I had last  week, I needed him to be great this weekend and he was. Sunday, Paul and I drove these mini-motorcycles around Cape Cod and then went out to brunch with Marisa and Mariah.  It was great. Marisa decided to drop Mariah and I off at the bus station.  While we were at a traffic light, Paul tells me to check his messages.  I do and find out that Kelly has had a nightmare of a time taking care of this dog that we are supposed to be sitting for.  Turns out she spent most of Saturday night chasing the dog around NYC.  The message I heard was "Joe, the dog is gone.  Just gone....shumma shumma shum the dog is gone!" WHAT?!?! I freaked out.  I mean, how could I not.  I immediately called Kelly to find out that the dog was safe and sound in the apartment.  I still have yet to talk to her in depth about the whole ordeal, but thank the lord in heaven above that the dog is okay.  THANK THE LORD!  I have no idea what I would have said to the lady when she got back.  Oh boy.  God really is looking out for us. Phew. Supposed to dog sit starting on Thursday, but will have to call the other people that are sitting and find out if I should even do that.  I was really looking forward to this and I need the money, so hopefully it will all figure itself out.   We shall see... I guess that is it for now.... Have a great story about Joey Fatone and my friend Rachel to put in here.  But that will have to wait until later. Right now I get to go do some bullshit project in our office library. A NNOY ING Latas.

      Wow.  So busy again today!  I can't believe how much shit I have done this week.  The pads of my fingers are pretty much worked to the bone.  If I have to design one more flier at this job, I may shoot myself or a Rabbi.  Depends on my mood. We had lasagna today at work that was quite excellent.  However, there was no sauce on it.  Is it illegal to make lasagna without sauce?  I think so.  I will ask my Italian grandmother tonight and see what she says.  Oh yeah.  She is sleeping forever.  Maybe I won't be able to ask her. Too bad I ate so much of it that now I feel like I am going to shit out some whole noodles.  Eh.  Maybe next time I will chew. Whatevs. So I have to go meet the dog lady after work today.  I am supposed to potentially dog-sit for her for about a week while she and her husband are in Italy.  She seems like a nice lady.  A little pathetic, but nice.  I think she is one of those people that has pets instead of children.  She originally wanted to take the dog with her to Italy, but has since decided that that may be a little ridiculous.  I kind of agreed.  Plus, I want her money. My boss is trying to fuck me out of having Friday off, but little does he know...I don't give a SHIT what he has to say about it.  I will not be coming in on Friday regardless and I just DARE him to fire me.  Double dog dare.   Will never happen. I got my haircut today and it looks pretty decent.  Usually it takes about 30 minutes for the whole process.  Today it took 8.  I had so much extra time that I got to go to Duane Reade of my love, the bank, AND even had a couple extra minutes to jerk off in the bathroom. SIKE. But not always sike. Ok...adios.   Hope everyone is doing well. Penelope got the most beautiful roses today.  She is one lucky lady. She was so adorable and red-faced when she came in and saw them.  Everyone was like "Oooh" and "Ahhh".  They all wanted to know what the deal was.  She tried very covertly to tell them who they were from without actually telling them who they are from. I mean really.  They were like flies to shit wanting to know the whole story.  Even the woman rabbi called her into the office to get the scoop.  You know...for a rabbi, that lady is quite the gossip hound. Hmmm....do you make fun of rabbi's repeatedly in your blogger? Yes. Yes you do. Latas.

      What up everyone??!?!?!  Sorry for the whole missing in action thing.  Got caught up in my weekend and then work has me going non-stop.  Its funny that I spent the whole summer doing shit, just to find out that when the students return, I have a real job afterall. The one good thing is that the days go by SO much faster when I actually have shit to do. And boy do I have shit to do. Let's see... Sitting here with my pathetic glass of wine.  Rita is out meeting up with an old friend of hers from highschool.  They haven't seen eachother in years and she is nervous, excited, etc. about the whole thing.  I gave her a good pep talk and sent her on her way.   Unfortunately, there hasn't been much going on in my life over the last couple of days.  Been kind of down about some shit that happened over the weekend, but I think I may be pulling out of it afterall.   Time heals all wounds.  As annoying as that saying is...it is very true and I must remember it every time I get stuck in a rut like the one I seem to be stuck in now. whatever.  No reason obsessing.  It will all just go away eventually.  Hopefully. So I got this new obsession going.  It's called the New York Public Library.  I just got my card about 2 weeks ago...but I can't stop going there like every day.  Seriously, it's becoming a problem.   If you go to the library on Monday and check out a book, it's a given that you shouldn't need to revisit the library again for at least a couple days or a week, depending on how fast you read the book(s) you have just gotten.   But my theory is...if you don't like the book you have just gotten...you go back the next day, turn it in and get something new. It's too much power for a boy like me.  I am getting into this habit of reading 50 pages of a book, deciding it's shit and then going back the next day on my lunch break to spend an hour in there finding something different and more exciting.  At this rate, I will never actually read a full book.  But I will know all the titles of everything out there. Plus they have movies and I can't stop renting those either.   Oh man.  Someone help me.  I am getting a little out of control. This weekend, I went to a couple Albany bars with my friend Mariah and a couple of her friends from home.  One of which lives in NYC with her.  I love this girl, Rachel, that she lives with....USUALLY.  But Friday night, she was the devil and I really hated every second I spent with her.  Eventually I ditched them all and did what I wanted to do. Alone. And I was great with it.   And to be honest, I wasn't alone.   Kelly...I ran into the following people at Oh Bar: Jim Lanahan and Tommy.  UM WHAT?!?!  Do I run into them in Albany??? Dan Keon.  Stupid idiot, wouldn't leave me alone Dan Keon. KEVIN!  OKAY!  So I run into an ex-boyfriend?  He sucked and wouldn't leave me alone either...but I think he eventually got the hint.  I mean...someone like me just doesn't spend the night walking around with someone like him.  heh heh. Also...I ran into Erin Selkis who is now a WOMAN!  Uh what?!?!?  I actually said to her: "What's your name...you look so familiar."  She goes..."Joe...it's ERIN SELKIS!" After shitting myself from shock...then having to go to the bathroom to clean myself up...I say to her..."What the hell have you been doing all these years?" I don't remember what she said because I was asleep from boredom after the first five minutes. Snore. Rome, the bar, has turned ghetto and everyone in it was out of their fucking minds.  I remember when I was at Rome's opening with Kevin, like 4 years ago, and it was so classy and nice. Now...wow.  It's become a teenager/drug romp fest. OH!  And let all you NYC people know...I ordered 4 drinks for the people I was with...expecting to pay for them all, cuz it was my turn.  Guess how much it cost?  I thought at least $26 bucks...but NOPE! $13.50. How does anyone ever go poor in Albany?!?! The night was fine. The end. I saw the movie "Signs" with my parents on Sunday and it was not only scary as fuck...it was moving.  I found myself laughing, crying, and jumping out of my seat.  If you don't see this movie in the theater...then you are missing out on quite an experience.  Mel Gibson...can do no wrong.  No seriously...no wrong.  I don't care if he hates gays.  This gay loves him. Certain movies are meant for the big screen.   This is one of them. And if you don't like it...it's best to keep your mouth shut...cuz I know theater and I know film and I know what works.  This movie is fucking BOMB. The end. Again. Alright...time to go make myself some fucking dinner.  This bitch has been burping up hot dogs all day, cuz I made the wonderful mistake of eating 2 of them for lunch today.  They were amazing. But now I taste them about every five minutes or so. Jami...you are adorable.  Where do you live?  Your emails and webpage make me smile. If you are in NYC...HELLS if we aren't getting together for drinks very soon. Adios mi mujeres. Oh!  Y muchachos as well. It's hard for me to tell who is reading these dayz. Off to french fry land.

      Hello to Jami! hahahahaha!  I have been out of the loop for like 3 days and suddenly I am unknowingly causing tons of confusion and havoc.  I wrote to this girl "Jami" about a week ago and then we started conversing through our bloggers.  Well, I noticed that she called one of her friends a "fag" and of course, my overly defensive nature jumped out and I commented on her entry.  Poor thing doesn't understand that I use MUCH worse terminology in my life, but for some reason, that day I was in the mood to tell a "non-fag" that they weren't allowed to use it.  (Roll your eyes at me...cuz I deserve it) In any case, it's all worked out, I think. She has commented on my site a lot in her blogger and now she has totally peaked my interest. Here is her page:   urlLink Jami  I get out of work in 10 minutes so I gotta go pack my shit up so as not to be caught in this hell hole for a minute longer than I have to.   Will try to write something tonight when I get home.  But in order to do that, I must have a glass of wine and/or a beer in my hand. Also, a pack of smokes would be nice.  mmmmm....smokes. PEAYCE!

      I am home.  I am home.  I am home! And it feels fucking good. For those of you who don't know, I originally hail from Albany, NY.  I try to get home every month and a half or so to get a taste of where I come from.  My parents are close to being my best friends and with my brother being in Germany due to the ARMY, it is sort of my duty to the good son and come home as much as possible.  I shouldn't say it's a duty.  That is about the farthest thing from the truth.  I love being home.  I love being with my family.  And I LOVE the no-anxiety/stress free Joe that comes out when I am here. Unfortunatly, due to the last minute plans, my parents won't be home until tomorrow morning.  They are away and it sucks not having them here.   For somebody that is an INFJ, I sure have a lot of trouble getting my energy from being alone these days. Something to think about... I took the train home with Mariah and Rachel.  We were able to ride for free because Mariah's father called in a favor with one of the guys that takes your tickets once you are on the train.  When I asked Mariah what the favor was, she said "I have learned not to ask my dad such things".  I laughed. But then I was scared. The ride home was fast.  The girls were in so-so moods, which was perfect considering that I spent the first 15 minutes trying to fake the best mood ever.  Once I realized that there was no need for that, I just settled in for an easy and smooth ride.  Momma C (Mariah's motha) picked us up at the train station and so far, that has been the best moment of the entire trip.  I just adore Mariah's mom and she just adores me.  So there were lots of hugs, lots of kisses, and lots of talk about the impending theater career I got goin. They dropped me off at my house and I walked in the door to find my dog, Bizmark, so excited to see me that his dick was in boner form until just about 10 minutes ago.   Sick. But true. He won't leave me alone.  Which is nice, considering that I adore this dog with my every being.  He follows me everywhere.  I went to take a shit and he sobbed outside of the bathroom door until I let him in.  Hey, if the smell doesn't bother him, why not come in and sit at my feet while I squeeze out a few of the Cosby's.   I am doing my laundry, which is free and convenient...a luxury only available in Albany.  I took a shower and now a I sit in my towel, waiting for my clothes to dry.  All the while, sipping a glass of wine and smoking a cigarette or 7.  You see, in Albany, people don't hate smokers the way they do in NYC.   Who would have known that Albany has more class than the big apple? I talked with Paul for awhile.  I informed him that if I happen to meet someone out tonight that I find attractive, I will definitly be pursuing a hook up.  He swallowed it with grace, slight bitching, but overall love for me.   He is a good boy.  He deals with my bullshit the best way he can.  And in all honesty, am I REALLY going to hook up with someone tonight? Never. But I want to be as honest with him about this whole thing as I possibly can.   Starting with preparing him for the worst. He talks about moving to NYC every five minutes now. It's funny to hear him talk so highly of the city now, after he only had negative jargon to spew about it for the last year and a half.   But that is because he hated the fact that I was there without him.  Now that he knows we will be together at last, he just loves it!  What a ridiculous monster. So it seems to me that I must definitly add the comment section thing to my webpage.  The poll has come to show that all those that read this have made my decision with a resounding YES! So, first thing Monday morning, I will have it on my page.  Thank you to my dear friend Jami, who convinced me of such a thing.   This girl intrigues me.  She wrote an entry the other day, that included the word "fag" and I just felt compelled to comment on the entry, letting her know that I was uncomfortable with her use of it.  In no way should she change for me.  It just surprised me that people are still using that word in the conotation that she used it in.  I hope that what I wrote didn't offend her and scare her off.  A word is a word is a word.  Especially when it is someone I don't know.   Unfortunatly, I happen to be a "fag", so it just zinged me when I read what she wrote. Jami...if you are reading this...sorry if I made you feel bad.  ;) Rita is in Syracuse.  I will be calling her in a bit to make sure that she is ok.   She is there to comfort some friends of ours that lost their grandmothers last week.  :( She is a stronger girl than me.   And I consider myself to be a VERY strong girl. Kelly has the house to herself this weekend.  She said something this morning that shocked me and filled me with absolute respect.  Usually, she HATES it when we both leave.  Cuz Kelly is an "E", not an "I" and she gets her strength from those that she surrounds herself with. For those of you that don't understand the whole ENFJ/INFP shit, I will put a link on my site so that you can take the test and see what you are.  It's a famous and historical psychological test that will give you some insight into who you really are.   Quite like the mini-tests that you can take and post into your webpage.  You know, like "What Kelly Osbourne hairstyle are you?" or "What flavor of cake represents your sex drive?" OK.  That was a joke.  PLEASE understand that that was a joke. So anyway, what I was saying is that Kelly told me this morning that she is actually looking forward to having the house to herself this weekend.  Hearing these words out of her mouth was shocking.  But it was also good and made me feel a little bit less guilty for her having to stay there alone, while I go back to our hometown.   It would be great to have her here, but it is even better to know that she is going to use these next couple of days to do what she wants to do.  We ALL need that once in awhile. So Kelly...ROCK.  Do it up.  Relax, walk around naked, get some strength back after your long ass week.  Oh, and clean the bathroom. SIKE! I still don't understand why God didn't give us three arms.  It is SO hard to type and smoke a cigarette at the same time. Fuck you Bloomberg. No really. Fuck you. Let's see... one more random story. Last night I am watching my tv and it is like 12:30am.  I don't remember what was on and it is unimportant.   Actually, maybe it was important.  So I will just say that I was watching  Dawsons Creek . YEAH FUCKING RIGHT.  Like even in stories I would say that I was watching  Dawson's Creek .   James Van der Beek is NEVER allowed on my television.  Unless it is  Varsity Blues .  Cuz he was pretty hot in that.  In any case, I was watching  The West Wing  and suddenly out of nowhere, a little "n" appeared in the middle of the screen.  But it wasn't any old "n".  It was a spanish "n" with the little atilda (~) over it.  Just like in the Spanish language.  It sat there like this:                                                                    n   but remember, it had this:   "~"   on top of it. It sat there in the middle of the screen for about 2 minutes and then it just went away. I died laughing. Then I stopped laughing and realized that my tv is slowly breaking. Great. Fuck you Spanish. Alright...that is about it for tonight.  Time to get dressed and hit up the lame ass gay bars in Albany. Is it wrong that I am kind of excited? And don't worry Kelly, I will definitly get a slice from Romeo's in your honor. Bye all. Enjoy your weekends.

      Just a quick update on Paul... We had an incredible talk last night.  I was open, he was open.  I got a lot of shit off my chest and he listened and responded with a sense of understanding so uncharacteristic of him.  I was a little shocked.   I told him of my desires to pursue other sexual conquests.  I told him about my fear of his moving to NYC.  I told him that I don't know how I feel right now, etc.  He swallowed all of it with ease and came back with some incredibly insightful comments.   He is planning on moving here on December 1st.  With or without a job.  As he says it: "It's time and all I want is to be there with you.  No matter if I can see you every day, or once a week.  Just being in the same city with you will make me happier than I have ever been." Wow.  And holy shit.

      OOF DAH. What a day.  I had a feeling that today was going to be shit from the minute I walked in to work.  I was a little wrong...cuz it isn't total shit.  Just exhausting, never-ending, mundane boredom has filled my inner being.  That's all.  Other than that...things are grrrrrrrrreat! I must say...Mayor Asshole Bloomberg has stepped over the line now. Like he hadn't up until this point.  urlLink Penelope  said it best in her entry today, so for full description, go visit her and see what she had to say. Not only has Michael raised the cost of packs of cigarettes $2.50, he is now trying to limit smoking, in general, to either dumpsters, or in your house with all of the windows closed. Today I wake up to find out that Bloomberg is also trying to pass a law forbidding cell phone usage while one is walking on the streets of Manhattan.  Meaning...you can not walk up the street while talking on your cellie.  No really.  What I said is no fabrication.  It is the truth. Penelope had a good point.  If you can't use your cell phone while you are driving and you can't use it while you are walking, where can you use it? In your house, next to your home phone?   That sounds brilliant! Gosh.  What is this city turning into?  Land of the free, home of the snarf.  Pretty soon, we will all have microchips inserted into our brain so that the government can monitor our every movement. Hmmm.... HMMMMMMM... Hm.

      I just received my site meter report and folks...BIG NEWS!  I have broken the 3,000 mark for number of visits.  Page views...hey that's in the billions.   SIKE! But page views don't count anyway.  Aren't you proud of me?  SNORES.  If anyone is ACTUALLY proud of me...then I think we have to re-evaluate our friendship. I think I could have a new reader named Jami.  I read her blogger the other day and she had the funniest story in it.  In fact, at the end of her entry, she wrote: "I am so glad that only my friends read this, because this is pretty embarrassing." Of course, I then write her a little note in her comment section that I thought her story was genius and that I went through the same thing she did. She wrote me a nice little email today saying that I should put comments on my page. Should I? I have been fighting against it this whole time, but maybe I should do it. What the hell right? Answer the poll and let me know y'all!

      I just about love the New York Public Library.  Not only have I proven my addiction by going just about every day, I have a routine.  I take out two movies a week and have to have them back within 7 days.  I can watch them at my leisure and the best part about all of it is that it is free!  I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!  Why don't more people use the library?  Not only is it convenient, it hasn't cost me a dime yet!  Books and movies and it's all fucking free!  :-D Also, you can reserve your books online so you never have to actually thumb through each book trying to find the one you want.  You get an email telling you when the book you want is in.  I wanted to reserve  The Lovely Bones  by Alice Sebold, but there are 910 people waiting for it before me.  Maybe I will just borrow it from Penelope or Rita.  :) I borrowed a book yesterday called  Bitten  and it is by one, Kelley Armstrong.  The dedication in the book says: "To Jeff - for believing that I could."  Now, although my name is Joe, I still thought that this was pretty cool.  Cuz I know a Jeff and he is so fucking amazing.   SNARF! The book is about a female werewolf.  But seriously...it's really good.  As I said to Rita yesterday, this woman, her name is Elena, is trying so desperatly hard to live a normal human life, but it is so impossible when she is just so hungry all the time.  She bench presses like 500# and she is the best!  Why won't everyone just let Elena be a strong and hungry girl? No, but really...the book is jood.  Very realistic so far.  And kind of erotic.   In fact, I might need to go in the bathroom right now and beat off to the idea that I am a female manbeast that needs to eat everything I can get my hairy paws on.  HOW HOT IS THAT!?!?!

      Hello friends.  Pretty tired today.  It is Wednesday afterall, so I guess that should be expected.  Have had two very productive evenings as of late.  I have done my theater resume and cover letter to just about the best of my ability.  Spent two evenings completely focused on it and hopefully they will both be well received by my future potential agents.  (insert a fingerscrossed symbol here) Tonight I have to make up the phone calls that I have let completely slide over the last week.   I have to talk to my parents because they have been begging me to hear all about the vacation.  I am going to see them Saturday, so maybe I can just talk to them about it then. I have to talk to Mariah because we have been playing phone tag like nobody's business.  I call, she calls, I call, she calls...no words have been exchanged in person in over a week. I HAVE TO HAVE TO talk to Paul tonight.  We spoke for a few minutes last night, played another round of the infamous phone tag and never actually connected.  So tonight, I have to sit with him and discuss the impending future.  Is he or is he not moving here?  How is he doing with his life in Boston?  So many questions to ask and answer. Also, next weekend, I am going to Boston because he is taking off Friday and Saturday from work so that we can go to Provincetown with Marisa and Mariah.  Kind of like a double date weekend trip thing.  I guess there is some sort of party going on and we are staying at some beach house.  I really don't know too much about it, but it does sound like fun.  And it has been ages since I have been to P-town.  It feels so good to be in a town filled with gays.  No worries.  And it actually feels like being gay is normal. I have been thinking lately that when I get older I am going to move to an all gay area, such as Provincetown, Fire Island, or San Francisco.  I never thought that I would ever want to do something like that, but as I get older, I get less excited about living with my family in a city in which very few people understand.  Although NYC is a very open-minded city, having kids go to school and tell their friends that they have two daddies does not go over very well.  I am sure it happens in SF all the time.  It's just something that I am going to want to pursue eventually.  At least do some research.  I don't want my children to have no straight influence and I definitly don't want them to be clueless as to the way the world really works, but I want them and myself to feel safe and to feel normal.  Especially in the formative years. I don't know.  Just a thought. Time to go take my fat burner.   Hey, that's what they do in San Francisco.

      I am sitting here right now, supposedly working on my theater resume and cover letter, but I got bored.   Kelly and Rita are watching an  Oscar nominated movie called  Amelie .  IN FACT! They just yelled at me saying the following:  "VIVA LA FRANCE!  YOU MAKING ME MISS THIS MOVIE!" Ok, Rita said that.  Not Kelly.  But Kelly loved that Rita said it...I just know it!  (picture me with a "curses" face on) I just can't stop interrupting.  They are watching a good movie and I want to watch a good movie.  But work comes before play, AND the movie is in English subtitles, so I sit here and putter away until I go to bed.  Which is soon, cuz Paul and I have to talk tonight.  Things are getting a lit-tle out of hand at this point. He is obsessed. He thinks I am going to break up with him, so suddenly he is calling all the time.  And when I say all the time, I mean, he called tonight at 5:50pm to "make sure that I got home alright." Um. It's weird to me and actually, this time it's not working. My brain is in overdrive and I can't sort shit out.  I feel confused.  I NEVER feel confused.  I am a man of action.  I always have a plan.  I even schedule every moment of my evenings, minute by minute.   Ask Rita. So I don't know what I think right now. What I do know is that: 1) I need to hook up with some big men and soon.  Did I say fucking soon?  cuz I mean like now.  While you are reading this. 2)  I am really going to jump into this acting thing, and although Paul supports it now, I know for a fact that he won't support it when it takes off.  He is a jealous person by heart and it does factor into our relationship.  Quite often. I won't have time and he won't accept that.  No matter he says, he will hate me if we break up after he moves to NYC.  And now?...of ALL things...he is moving here for him!  He wants to live here.  But NO he doesn't.  I can say "Don't move here." and he still will.  I convinced him to convince himself, or will this work, or will, SDKFHJO:ISDIHJFLEIJFS  ---------it's driving me fucking mad.  Shit. I wanted him here so bad for so long and now it's the reality.  I am still in love with him.  I feel it. But I also feel extreme doubt.  Which, to be honest, I go through alot.  About every 6 months.  We just got back together in December.  So this would be our 8th month that I got a little itchy.  Commitment and me = garbage. I gotta figure out a way to get through this.  I am no where near the place right now in which I would want to break up with him.   It's just all becoming so real, so fast. Wow everyone.  I really do have a boyfriend.  Look he lives in the same city that I do! uh.... what? So much is changing.  SO MUCH IS CHANGING! Sometimes I wish I was one of those lucky, ply-wood personality people (stacey), that just went through their life like it was smooth and easy.  Then I wouldn't know that my life is changing. I analyze too much.  My brain, as is yours if you are reading this, is fucked up.  Too much.  Always too much! So I need to relax.  I need to write in this journal for therapy (thus having the luxury to explain myself to all of my friends without really saying it...), pray more, and let it go.  It all happens the same way anyhow.   Craziness. Goodnight. I am worn the fuck out.

      I have a lot to write about today.  I may have to do it in installments.  But here are the headlines of the topics that will be addressed:  Britney Spears and the VMA's   Road Rules Campus Crawl   Smoking Ban in NYC   My Theater Resume  I was actually laying in bed last night, doing my best to try to remember each one of these topics so that I could write about them today.  In fact, when I woke up, I immediatly ran the list in my head again.  Now I am here and I actually remember.   First...  Britney Spears and the VMA's:  After seeing (once again) the preview for the upcoming Video Music Awards (August 29th), I noticed two things.  One is that Jimmy Falon is just about the funniest and most adorable thing to come out of Albany since me.  Second is that Britney Spears will only be making an "appearance" at the show.  She will not be performing.  At least, that's what I picked up from seeing the preview.  Kelly and I were discussing the Britney Spear's/VMA situation the other day and she said that she thought it was good that Brit was out of the scene for awhile.  Of course, we all whole-heartedly agree.  However, I have to say that it would be in her best interest to take a break AFTER doing a knock-out performance at the awards show.  She owes it to them and she owes it to herself.  It wasn't too long ago, that her pseudo-strip tease caught national attention thus propelling her career into this mega-star phemomena.   Where are her publicity reps?  Where are the people that are supposed to be planning her career out for her?   Yes, Britney needs a break.  But she should perform at the VMA's first. If I was her marketing/publicity rep., this is how I would have this all go down. Britney performs in some sort of knock-out outfit.  Having worked out for months to prepare, her body would be in the best shape it has ever been in.  There is a big crescendo and then an explosion.  Brit appears in the middle of the stage surrounded by her dancers.  She wouldn't be performing her latest top 10 (Boys).  She would be doing a mix of all of her top 10's, beginning with Baby One More Time.  She would do about 30 seconds of each song.  The songs should be somewhere along the lines of:  One More Time ,  Sometimes I Run ,  Crazy ,  Lucky ,  Oops I Did it Again ,  Not Yet a Woman ,  I'm a Slave ,  Overprotected , and  Boys .   (Did I really just list all those songs off the top of my head.  Oops.   I  did it again.) During the montage of these songs, Britney would perform like mad, including a dance step from each hit.  There would be lights, pyrotechnics, and at least 3 costume changes.  Her dancers would be sweating their balls off trying to keep the whole thing flying.  All of this would take place in under 6 minutes.   At the very end of her performance, I say that the lights cut out except for the lone spotlight on Britney.  There is a loud crash and she says in her sexiest voice, "I'll be back" or some shit.  The light then cuts out and Britney is gone.  She has left the stage and she has left the VMA's.  She doesn't do interviews, she doesn't do anything.  She leaves the entertainment scene for 6 months or a year, or whatever she needs.   BUT WOULDN'T THAT BE GREAT?!?! Slamming performance and then Britney just disappears.   But what will really happen is that Brit will not perform, she will present an award, snore us to death, and then do a thousand interviews before slipping into the crack of embarrassment with Tiffany, Debbie Gibson, and the Backstreet Boys. Hmph.  Road Rules: Campus Crawl  I don't have too much to say about this show, except for the fact that if you aren't watching it, you are missing something wholesome and sweet.  It is the very FIRST season I have ever seen of any MTV reality show in which all of the people co-exist in a space the size of a peanut and still get along as though they are all the most kind and gentle people on the planet.   Seriously.  The season is at least half over at this point and last night's episode made me cry.  It really did.  This group has come so far.  The 6 of them take care of eachother, are honest with eachother, and really do work together as a team on every mission.  5 of the 6 of them are athletes, leaving out Sarah, who, as she says, just likes to "sit around and hang out."  Yet, when Sarah causes them to fail most of the missions, they swallow it, help her along and just move forward.  It's really quite beautiful. BUT THE CLINCHER IS... The Road Rulers have been told from the beginning, that if they lose more than 2 challenges, they have to either: a)  Give up all the prizes up to that point or b)  Vote off the weakest member of the team. Within the first 3 episodes, the team lost two challenges and the decision was easy.  Give up the prizes.  They had only earned motor scooters by that point.  But now...7 weeks into the game, they have made tons of money, won tons of prizes, gift certificates, etc.  And then last night, they go and lose another challenge.  Decision time. Lose all prizes or vote off Sarah.  But there is another clincher...and I don't know WHY MTV is doing this... If they decide to lose all their prizes and NOT pick someone to vote off...a RANDOM cast member will be voted off.  UM!  Yeah, that's totally fair. They all sit down together to fully discuss what is going to happen.   The boys vote to eliminate someone and to keep the prizes.   The girls vote to lose the prizes and leave everyone on equal playing ground.  Who ever gets the boot, gets the boot. There are hard feelings and everyone is upset.   Joe crys at this part. Next week though...the answer will be revealed.  Who is going home? None of this is probably intersting to you.  But it should be.  It's nice to sit and watch a half hour show that makes you feel better about humanity.  And who can possibly sit in front of this show and NOT fall completely in love with Road Ruler ERIC!  Not only is he totally adorable, he has a heart of gold.  He is open minded and he is wonderful.  I want to marry a man just like Eric.  That looks like him, acts like him, and well, IS him. Watch this show...you don't know what you are missing.  Smoking Ban in NYC  I think Penelope wrote about this in her blogger at one point, or she and I talked about this... but either way... I hear on the radio this morning that Bloomberg is going full force with this ELIMINATE SMOKING campaign.  As we all know, a pack of smokes costs $7 now.  (You can find them at Duane Reade for much cheaper, but don't let the word get out...) On top of this, by the end of the year, there will be no smoking in the following places in NYC: Bars Restaurants Beaches Parks CAN YOU BELIEVE IT???  Not only has he raised the prices, he is eliminating every area in which smokers can go.  It's pretty unbelievable.  In a way I am happy.  It will definitly get me to quit.  But I have to be honest and say that it is completly unfair.  I think it may even be against the constitution.  It has been linked to Prohibition and that may be correct.   Z100 made a good point today when they said that you can sit in Columbus Circle and have a cigarette, but don't you dare walk into the park with it.   Cuz if you do...fines up the ass! Wow.  Time to quit everyone. Lastly...  My Theater Resume  Is so amateur and shitty, I will never make it in this business. The end.

      For the first time since I have been back from vacation, I am actually bored.  I have been working my ass off at this job for nearly a week straight and haven't had a free second to do anything fun.   But today...that all changed.  I finally caught up.  So now I am looking for things to do, websites to read, games to play... I decided to go back on these diet pills I have.  They aren't really diet pills exactly.  More like metabolism increasers.  I bought them last year, had a rough bout with them and gave them up.  Okay, I only used them for two days.  But I spent good money on them and I do believe they will work.  And don't give me any of that..."Don't do it Joe.  It's unhealthy to use these type of pills..." Cuz I am using them.  The end. I have yet to be hungry today, which is a good thing.  After eating a HUGE lunch at the Neptune yesterday, I proceeded to eat a full sandwich 3 hours later, a gigantor bowl of pasta two hours after that, and I capped off this glutton filled day with about a half bag of candy.  Man, it felt good to be alive. And it felt good to have a shit load the size of Kansas this morning. :-D Sending out sympathy cards for the two girls who lost their grandmas over the last week.  It's so hard to write anything substantial in cards like that.  I mean, I am usually good with words in cards, but with these... It brings back too many memories.  Memories which I am still not ready to confront head-on. Tonight and tomorrow night will be filled with the tons of shit I need to do.  Time to update my acting resume, write a slammin cover letter, and then get some pictures out to as many people as I can possibly think of.  Wow.  Should probably start memorizing some monologues too.  I got a couple still floating around in this head of mine.  But none that are ready to be presented. One night before I left for vacation, Mariah and I were sitting on her roof drinking wine and she asked me to do something for her.  Give her any sort of acting presentation that I could.   So, I gave her a short, and totally random few lines from  One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest .  Although it was nowhere near the caliber of what I have to offer as an actor, it felt good to get that rush again.  I love the look of incredulity on people's faces when they realize that "Shit, he really can act.  He's not just pretending." Very few of the people that are involved in my inner circle right now have not seen me do anything, so it will be quite a shock for them when they realize who the real Joe Cuttheshit is.  I am telling you...it's not the guy in this journal, that's fo sho. My mom has been offered this new job making 100K.  She is not sure if she is going to take it yet, but if she does, she and my dad will move to (the very bottom) of upper class.  At least, as far as I am concerned.  Not that that is a huge deal, but for a family that started out great, fell into bankruptcy, and had to work their way back from nothing...this is surely a big deal to all of us.   I am incredibly proud of her. And it has the potential at being a job that she would totally love.  Not that she doesn't totally love the job she has now.   Some good things going on, I guess. My brother is out in the field for two weeks, so won't be able to converse with him in any way, but email during that time. That sucks.  Never want to talk to him when he's here, but you make it impossible for me to talk to him, and I about die inside.  Finally...work is over in about 40 minutes.   Gonna go do something relaxing for that time.  I gots work to do when I get home. Paul has called three times today and I have ignored every call, letting the phone mail take it.   Just can't do it right now.

      One more thing...just in case you haven't heard. Yesterday, Jason Priestley (Brandon of 90210 fame) was in a horrible race car accident going about 180mph.  He fractured his spine, broke bones in both feet, and had internal bleeding in his skull. As of this morning, the doctor's were saying no paralysis, but it is too soon to be completely sure.  WOW, right? I bet Brenda had something to do with this...

      So I have been back from vacation for over a week now and have yet to stop running myself into the ground.  Last week, although it went by faster then I could blink, was full of fun, craziness, excessive drama, and death. Saturday was Kelly's graduation party and it was a rising success.  So many people, so many stories, and smiling like I haven't seen in ages.  It was a wonderful experience from beginning to end. Because of all of these celebrations, Angie has been around a lot more.  Once I hung out with her for more than 3 hours at a time, I realized how much she has really changed in the last year.  Some for the good, some for the not so good.  As far as our friendship is concerned, things are smooth.  I find her to be hysterical and a little outrageous.  There were some things that came out of her mouth that made me cringe.  Such as the use of the word "fag", calling Kristin and I the "Anti-Christ", etc.  But overall...I think I have figured out that if you take Angie with a grain of salt, her presence is an overall pleasure. Got to spend a lot of time with Kelly and Rita as well and that is ALWAYS a pleasure. So both Erica and Nina had their grandmothers die within a week of eachother. I don't have much more to say about that, except for...ugh.  This has got to be so hard for them. Penelope is out on vacation and hopefully enjoying herself.  Doesn't look like she nor I will be taking many more days off in the future as summer is coming to a close. Paul is being sweet and adorable and I have been ignoring him since the minute he left here to go back to Boston last weekend.  I don't not like him anymore or anything.  It's not like I am out of love.  Just really dealing with some issues inside of my head and talking to him usually doesn't make it much better.  So, no phone calls. Mariah has a job.  CONGRATS to her.  It's a part time nanny job, but it's for like the CEO of Time Warner or some shit...so I am sure the money is good.  Even if the people aren't.  ;) What else...going home this weekend.  Going to see my parents on Saturday.  That rocks out just a bit.  Mariah will actually be going home with me, so it will be cool to go out to some Albany gay bars with her on Friday night.   Have so much to do this week.  SO MUCH.  I have to stop putting shit off.  Woke up with a panicky/stressed feeling this morning.   I am getting right off of this thing to make my to-do list up.   Edward called last week.  Or maybe even two weeks ago.  Who knows anymore. Don't know what to do with that phone call either. Are he and I still in contact?  I don't know. Movies that must be seen by all: Bamboozled by Spike Lee.  FUCKING WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE.  I hope.  If it doesn't, then maybe you need to re-evaluate this "open mind" thing you got goin. Lord of the Rings.  Fucking great!  Lots of action and totally well acted.  I am now excited for the next installment to come out.   Eh...looking forward to little things is pretty great. I guess that's it. Feeling that this journal is coming to a halt again. But refuse to give it up until I have something really worthwhile holding me back from it. So far...nothing is.   Please God let that change.  PLEASE.

      HOLY SHIT...back from vacation. I never thought this day would actually come.  I thought that my vacation would last for years and it is slowly hitting me that it's over.  All of the planning and energy that went into it and now...now...nothing.  Just memories and tan bodies.   It was quite the experience.  I will write more about it later when I have organized my thoughts a bit better.  Right now I am just frustrated that it's over and that my life is still stagnant here in NYC.   But oh well.  It's time for lunch and things always seem brighter after a smoke.

      Been a pretty decent Monday so far.  Usually I wake up with dread that courses through my gay veins, but today is turning out to be harmless.  Actually, I did get to waste some time exchanging immature jabs with two fucking losers through blogworld.  It was pretty fucking funny and I have gone back to the site like 5 times to read what they wrote back to me.  It is damn hilarious.  Especially if you could see one of these guys in person.  He is the epitome of what you would expect from an online journaler.   He's hideous, in every possible way.  It's so unfortunate for him that he is still walking this planet, but it does give all the rest of us something to laugh about! Here is his link... urlLink Doug the fuck  Enjoy!  Don't bother reading his site.  It is the most incredibly boring thing your eyes will ever have to experience.  If you want...say something mean to him.  He and his dork friend are pretty hilarious when they get insults shoved into their vaginas.  urlLink Doug's equally hideous friend  GO TO THEIR SITES AND MAKE FUN OF THEM!  They love it! In other news, this weekend was pretty much blah.  I did hook up with an old friend of mine and we had a blast on Saturday night.  What time did I get to bed?  Oh yeah.  6am!  Dayim!  Spent most of the day lounging around and watching movies yesterday.  It was the fucking best.  I took like 3 naps and ate everything that sat still for more than 5 minutes.  At one point Rita was sleeping on the chair.  She didn't move for awhile, so I thought it only polite to take a bite out of one of her boobs. It was tasty. And I don't like boobs even! It is almost time for lunch!  Going to the West End today.  Probably going to eat buffalo wings and french fries and drink 5 glasses of wine!  Sounds like the perfect way to spend a lunch break.  Dont ya think? ooh...there's Ari.  Time to head out.  Will do my best to stop by here later!

      Gotta piss gotta piss gotta piss.... Promised myself that I would write in here before I run to the bathroom.  Why, you might ask?  Because I am trying to discipline myself.   Whatever.  I am lazy as fuck. Today has been a pretty awful day.  Work is dragging, I have been a bit stressed out, and I am fiending for a cigarette.  It is rainy outside, and while I usually love days like that, I hate it today.  It's bringing me down more. Once work is over for the day, I am hoping that beer will make me smile.  It usually does.  :) I don't have much to write about today, but I definitly wanted to stop in and say hello.   Kelly works all weekend.  Rita is going away on a wonderful trip to PA with her boyfriend.  I am really excited for her.  These kind of getaways are what I live for and Rita doesn't do them nearly enough.  She has got quite the self-restraint.   Paul is sick again.  Remember how he was in the hospital awhile back?  Well, turns out...the surgery didn't go well...like we didn't know that from before.  He may have to go back in for another surgery.  I am going to die if he does.  I surely can't take more time off from work to go be with him and it is going to break my heart to think that he is going to have to go through this all again by himself.  Damn. He went to Beth Israel for the surgery last time.  They are like the best in Boston.  What's the fucking deal? Spent alot of today talking to my friend Ian at work.  He is a really great guy.  Every time he makes plans with Rita and I for dinner or drinks, I accept and then cancel with him the day before.  I suck like that.  I am going to have to make plans with him for real this time and no matter what...keep them.  Sometimes I can be a douche.  Lots of time I eat a douche. My boss is standing directly behind me as I write this. Fuck you boss. What else... hmmmmmmmmmm.......... Today I had chicken fingers for lunch and had to run back to work to go to the bathroom.  No joke...WHOLE pieces of the chicken fingers came out in the bowl.  Seriously, is there an open passage way from my mouth to my ass?  Why does food go right in, not digest, and then come flying out in such a spastic manner? Why do I always find myself talking about shit on this thing?  I hate poop and yet I act like that's all I am good at. Enough. I got this zit on my lip this week...I decided not to pop it, hoping that it would just sink back into my face.  It didn't.  In fact, it became so painful that I had to squeeze it last night.  EXCRUCIATING is the only word I can think of to describe it.  But it is finally on it's way back to hell where it came from.  Damn you acne.  DAMN EWE! Been chewing the same piece of whitening gum for about 2 and a half hours.   My teeth have bleached right off at this point. Okay...guess that's it.  Need to go piss before I puke. latas...

      Just had the weirdest conversation with this girl.  It was about the band Guster and every time I tried to explain myself to her, she just kept looking at me as though I was a lunatic.  It was so intensly horrifying that at one point, I looked down and noticed that I was pinching my dick in my fingers.  I was PINCHING my DICK in my fingers!  I was that uncomfortable!  I hope she didn't notice. In any case...I heard this amazing rumor that the fifth floor of our building contains slices of pizza free for the taking.  I will immediately be going up there, eating what I can and stuffing the rest into my pockets for later. So just now, this old Orthodox Jewish man walks in and asks to talk to the head rabbi.  I knock on the rabbi's door to see if he is in a meeting.  He is in fact in a meeting with a student.  A private meeting.  I turn to tell the asshole that he can't come in right now and this little shit shoves me aside with one hand and continues to barrel into the office. I look at the head Rabbi and make a smarmy "fuck you" face at the guy and then proceed back to my desk. I just love rude buttholes. That dick just walked over and goes: "WHERE DO I GET WATER?" Instead of pointing out the very clearly marked Poland Spring Water cooler in front of his face, I sent him to the bathrooms on the 2nd floor.  He is old and an asshole and I just sent him to get toilet water.  That will teach you to be so fucking inconsiderate my douchebag friend. I am using a new gel.  I opened up the bottle this morning and used my usual amount.  What I didn't count on was the fact that this gel is similar to cement and when dry...feels like I have a spikey helmet on.  I keep playing with it and I am so afraid that it is going to rub out without me realizing it and turn the top of my head into Old Smokey. Memble Old Smokey?   Memble how a meatball rolled down Old Smokey once? If you have no idea what I am talking about, just continue on... If you do know what I am talking about, take a pause to laugh a little. Have to admit...Las Vegas Real World last night was MUCH MUCH better.  The people have started to "let go" a bit and not act like such fucks.  I mean that literally.  They are fucks cuz all they do is fucks. Fucksing annoy me. Last night was decent.  Then I watched the Making of the Video with Kelly Clarkson.  SNANORE! Nuff said. She's a tad ugly that one.  I don't know.  Something's up with her face. OK!   BIG NEWS!  (ooh...hot Jewish boy just walked by)(not the big news, although it should be considering that I work in a place for the ugly) So the big news is two-fold.  First the biggest part... Last night Mariah and her roommate Rachel went to this club called  Suede  because Joey Fatone was going to be there doing a special Joey Fatone type show.  Whatever, he is such a fuck. Anyway...if you recall...Mariah's friend Rachel sucked Joey's dick about a hundred times during that evening and the following day.  He also ate her out.  She also had a yeast infection when he did it.   Fucking nast.  But whatever...when you're hungry, you're hungry. So, Mariah and Rachel go to Suede last night to see him perform in his show.  He recognizes the two of them immediatly and spends a great portion of the night hanging with them.  According to Mariah, he is really smitten with Rachel.   Twatever. But the BIG NEWS is that Justin "The Fucking Man" Timberlake shows up at the club and Mariah MEETS him and then he KISSES her on the right cheek and then he hangs with her for awhile.  UMMMMMMMMMMMMM! UMMMMMMMMMMMM! hey... UMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM! Fucking amazing!  And why the FUCK didn't I go with them?!?!?!?!?!?! Argh! I have yet to speak to Mariah in person about all of this.  She left these details on our answering machine this morning. I just left her a message telling her to call my sorry ass back asap. So yeah. Second big news is that she is having a show on October 26th at a bar downtown.  The cost at the door is $15 and we are ALL going to support her, k?  The place holds 100 people and I plan to do whatever I can to fill the place.  Wanna go? If you are reading this now, you are more than invited.  I will contact the rest of you via email.  How fun, right?  She will be doing 6 songs.   I was going to guestspot on one of them, but I think it depends on whether or not I want to preview my new album or whatever. Eh...we'll see... Man.  I REALLY hope these erotic feelings for Eli go away soon.  No joke...he is limping cuz he twisted his ankle and he also has a stye on his eye that is the size of Vesuvius and I STILL want him to come sit at my desk and give me kisses and hugs. I don't think I want his dick in my mouth just yet.  Maybe after he buys me dinner. I am so hungry for lunch right now.  I have been starving since 10am, but I have held myself back, cuz I know that this hunger is based from my lack of smoking.  The last thing I need in my life is to start acting, but weighing 50 pounds more.  Then the only parts I will get will be Jaba the Hut or the Nutty Professor 3.   Which may not be so bad. Alright ya'll.   Mariah is on the phone!!!!!!!

      Wow.   What a day. I had exactly 15 minutes to myself all day and it was during that time that I wrote my other entry.  It's a good thing I type fast. God...you wouldn't BELIEVE how busy I have been at work.  I hate leaving projects for the next day.  I don't do it ever.  But today I had to and that drives me insane.  If I don't do the shit I have to do the day it is assigned, there is no way I can catch up the next day.  It is virtually impossible.  So even though I worked my ASS off today, tomorrow promises to be even more exhausting.  Gosh.  It must be REAL fucking nice to be just about anyone else in my office.  I mean...in my opinion...none of them are as busy as I am.  None of them are juggling two full time jobs (administrative assistant/program coordinator) while at the same time, answering questions, acting as a personal assistant to two people, and constantly being interrupted by others in the office place that have no idea how to do the job they got hired for. It really wore me down today. Big time. Ari was NOT fired today.  They told her that they will discuss her employment with the agency in 4-5 weeks. ARE WE SERIOUS?  Wow.  This is the first job, in my LIFE, where an employee can say and do things that would be detrimental to their job security, and STILL walk out of a meeting and have their job.  The place I work for is complete bullshit.  I am not happy right now.  Not at all.  I mean, I want the best for Ari.  I do.  But she needs to go.  And soon.  This job is killing her inside.  I know it is.  And it's also killing me.  I don't know how many more times I can see and hear from her about how horrible it is to be her at this place.  She is right 99% of the time.  But the whole thing is definitly taking its toll on me.   I want her to be happy.  First and foremost.   I don't know. It was a long day. A VERY long day. I still have yet to put my headshots/resume together.  That's next on the agenda.  Man...there just isn't enough time in the day.   Paul hasn't called since Sunday afternoon.  He is supposed to come here on Friday for business, but if he can't give me an answer by tomorrow morning...I am going to go ahead and make plans for this weekend.  I DESPISE worrying on Wed. about what I will be doing for that weekend.  I am a planning freak and I can't stand this "Let's just wait and see attitude". It might be a "I need to hang out with some new friends" type of weekend.  I need a breath of fresh air. God I need to start acting soon. Alright...that's it.   Time to go decompress a bit.

      Hello to everyone!   Especially to my new friend  PHEOBE  who has recently joined us and is seemingly QUITE amazing!  So welcome Pheebs!  Hope you stick around for awhile. Hi again to the rest of ya!   So guess what?  Last night I DID in fact have a Nicotine Patch dream.  You are going to think I am lying when I relay it to you, but I promise it is for real.  Each and every detail. Here it is So I am sitting in a classroom with a bunch of people I have never met before.  Lets say that there were about 75 people.  I have no idea why I am there except that I am waiting for the big news.  Suddenly a 30ish woman walks in and starts calling out peoples names.  She calls out 6  names and then I hear mine.  I stand up and join the rest of the people in the front of the classroom.  Everyone who didnt have their name called get up and leave the room.   I look at the other 6 people and realize that they are the current case of Road Rules. (The last thing I saw on tv last night before going to bed was Road Rulesso this does make sense) The 7 of us leave the classroom and immediately rush off to this hotel to do our first mission.  We are all laughing and getting along as though we have been on the road for months.  In fact, I think that at this point of the dream, we HAD been on the road for months.  We get to the hotel and settle into a corner of the lobby.  We look around the room and notice that there are about 15 other Road Rules teams waiting for further instructions, just as we are doing. Eventually, this horrible looking man with HORRIBLE hygiene gets up in front of all of us and tells us that we have to drink beer and talk to each other for two hours.   THATS THE MISSION???? AMAZING!  Cuz I am SO good at that. We hang out and drink.  We laugh, we joke, I have the best time of my whole life. At some point, I look around the room and realize that all of the other teams have been eliminated.  WE HAVE WON!  WE WON THE MISSION!   How did we win?  I have no idea. But I know we won! YAY! We are all overjoyed and then I realize that Eli (this guy I work with) is missing from our group.  Now, he wasnt in the original casting, but at this point we are all freaking out that we have lost him.  Rachel, from Road Rules, says to me: Joe, you go find him.  He likes you best. I get up and go down the hall of the hotel.  I open this random door to Eli with his head on this wooden desk.  He is crying hysterically.  I ask him whats wrong, but he wont answer.  I start to get really upset too.  I ask him over and over if he wants to talk or if I should get the rest of the team.  He says: No, then gets up and walks over to me.  He puts his arms around me and just stands there hugging me.  I hold him while he cries and then I wake up. Jigga what??? When I had the Eli/Nicotine dream last time, he was the sexiest beast on earth.  But last night wasnt like that at all.  He wasnt cute or sexy or anything.  He was just Eli.  But he broke my heart and OH GREAT!  I woke up being in love with him again!  Last time this happened, it took me 3 days and him dressed up in a chicken costume to get over it.   Oh Lord. What could this dream mean? Elis mom is in the hospital because she is battling breast cancer.  Do you think I should talk to him about it?  Do you think that I should ask him to go get drinks or something, just to get his mind off of a few things? I dont know him very well and the whole situation is just weird.  He is a sweet kid, but am I comfortable enough asking him what the deal is? I dont know. I think I will write him and email later just to let him know that I am thinking about him. In any caseI laid in bed for about 20 minutes this morning thinking about Eli and WISHING that I was a member of this seasons Road Rules.  In my mind, they were MUCH cooler than they really are.  I mean, dont get me wrong.  I think that they could be my favorite Road Rules Cast ever.  Fuck that.  They ARE my favorite Road Rules cast ever.  I just love em. So thats that. As I type this, Ari is in our bosss office discussing her future at our job.  For her sake, I hope they fire her so that she can finally get her ass in gear and get out of this slum that we work in.  She takes so much shit from these people and its about time that she moves on.  Its whats best for her.  I assure you.   GO ARI! I dropped off my headshot/resume/thank you card to my new friend GIGI.  Everyone keep your fingers crossed that she will make me famous!  She has the power to do so!  So give it up! This student just told me about this test that was conducted somewhere.  (I wasnt listening at the beginning of her story)  In the test, they took self-proclaimed homophobes and also self-proclaimed non-homophobic heterosexuals, hooked them up to these shock type therapy things and made them watch gay porn.  And of coursethe homophobes got shocked repeatedly for being turned on by the whole thing, while the non-homophobes got away free of charge! Figures, right? Well anyway I hope everyone has a decent rest of their day. Mine gets better the minute I lock myself in my bedroom to run monologues! WHOO WAH!  I might be an actor afterall!

      The weekend has come and gone.   Hate it when it does that.  I slept rather fitfully last night.  Not that I didn't have a good nights' sleep, but that I woke up every hour and thought to myself: "Wow.  5 more hours of sleep."  Or "Wow.  35 minutes more of sleep." I kind of like doing that.  It makes it so that I have a very long night of sleep.   Overall the weekend was mediocre.  Rita and I watched movies and did some shopping on Friday.  That's always fun.  The restaurant opening that we went to on Saturday was a bust.  The place was cute, the food was pretty good, but the party blew.  It was impossible to get free drinks, the serving staff sucked, and once we did get drinks, it was all over priced.  Well, maybe not that over priced, but over priced cuz where the fuck were the free drinks?  Poor planning, I think. However, Ari and I met a fellow blogger named FISH NEEDS A BICYCLE!  She was great!  Very cute and totally easy to talk too.  I just wish we had more time to chat.  She seemed like a really nice girl.   After this whole thing, Ari, Kelly, Rita and I went over to this other bar called Blackstar or some shit.  It was ok.  Nothing huge.  It was fun to be out, but other than that, rather boring evening. Rita and I ended up taking quizzes on the internet until about 4am and that was pretty fun.   Sunday, Rita and I watched Harry Potter and went back to bed.   Love days like that. Today I pick up my new reprinted headshots.  Wish me luck! Back on the patch today.  Hoping for some kick ass dreams tonight.  Went off it over the weekend thinking that I was stronger than I was.  I even smoked cigarette in front of Fish.  So I can't act like I have been totally clean this weekend.  :) What else? Reconnected with a friend from way back.  She and I used to be busom buddies.  Kind of hoping that she hasn't turned into a complete psycho.  If she hasn't, this will bring my friend quotient in the city up to 5! That's exciting. I guess that's it. Had a great talk with my brother today.  We laughed alot and it felt good to hear his voice. Paul and I had some good talks over the weekend too, so that makes things pretty great overall. He is tentively scheduled to come to NYC on Friday for work.  If so, he and I will have the house to ourselves on Friday night and that would be amazing.  Maybe make a nice dinner, with candles and love.   Not trying to get my hopes up though.  He won't know until Wednesday if this is going to all go through. Alright...outta here. Be back later

      So tonight we head to a restaurant opening with Ari, Trick, Kelly, Rita, myself and also, one FISH! Meeting up with an actual fellow blogger tonight.   How cool and strange and exciting! Rita and I are leaving my apartment at 6:15pm to be at Ari's by 7pm.  We will all relax for a bit and then head down to GOA at like 8:30pm or so.  Free drinks and debauchery all night. What a perfect Saturday evening. Gotta go jump in the shower.  Rita is done and now it is my turn. I am wearing long sleeves tonight.   It is about 357 degrees outside.  Appropriate clothing. Okay, Rita just walked out of the bathroom holding a pair of underwear that she accidently dropped in the toilet. HAHAHAHAHA She is now drying them with a hair dryer in hopes of still wearing them. Even though there is clearly a poop stain on them now. Weird girl!

      Wow.  Do I have a story! Do you all remember when I dog sat?  I mean, I never actually "dog-sat" per se, but I was staying at this woman's house, taking care of her plants, bringing in her mail, etc.etc.etc.etc.etc.etc.etc. One night, Kelly dog sat and the dog went haywire and she ended up losing it for a couple of hours.  Well, the hours being between 1-4am or something.  Whatever.  That's not the point of my story. The point is: It's been two weeks since she told me that she would mail my check for what we did end up doing while she was gone.  She was very pleasant on the phone and everything seemed to be great. Today, having not received the check yet, I called her and left her an answering machine message explaining that she must have had the wrong address, cuz I still haven't received the check.  Where is my check?  What the fuck, give me my check! So when I got home tonight, she had left a message on my answering machine FURIOUSLY explaining that she basically hates me and my family and that she will kill us if she ever sees us in a public park. She is pissed about Kelly and the dog.  And also that I spilled a red perfume stain on her couch. Okay, guys... I am gay.  Yes.  I admit it.  But I have yet to try on women's perfume.  It's...well...it's gay. I made a stain on the couch?  YOU made 57 stains on the couch.  When I called her back the second time, not only did I say it was impossible for me to have made the stain,  you "Vicki, have so many stains on your couch that it would be out of the realm of possibility for you to have found a new one". Oops.  That stung. But true. Also she said that I shouldn't have been staying at her house, without the dog.  Although she told me OVER and OVER..."Please...oh please stay in my apartment, just in case I get any important messages or something goes wrong." Right. Suck my dick you stupid bitch. I hate you. I stressed over this shit longer than I ever should have tonight.  What a waste of emotion. I am a VERY responsible, VERY concientious person.  I NEVER hurt people, unless I mean to hurt them.  Somehow I fucked up this ladies existence worse than when last year, her other dog got hit by a truck on Broadway.  While she was walking it. I know.  Fucked up.  And I am SORRY that the experience with Kelly and the dog seemed to have sent you over the edge...but you know what?????? I DIDN'T SPILL PERFUME ON THE FUCKING COUCH! Whatever. what the FUCK ever. Will have to let you all know how this turns out. just so you know...when i called her back the first time...i was extremely aggressive and demanded that she mail the check to Kelly and I tomorrow.  Demanded! She did offer to mail the check when she called back the second time.   But I feel that if I took the money, she would take a nut.  She didn't spay her dog, cuz it bleed like a siv the entire time she was gone, but I tell you...she would take a nut. Today on the bus... Rita and I were stepping off through the front exit, cuz the bus was INCREDIBLY packed.... We were the last two out the door and this black woman says to me as I walk by "Supposed to go out the back way, goddamn you".  I turn around and go "SHUT UP!" right in her face. LOLOLOLOLOLOL Then we walked off the bus gloating about how she should have shut up. It was pretty great. Today was a very angry day on my part.  Why do people provoke these emotions?  Unless you scare them back with harsh words or major volume, you get stomped on. I don't want to have experiences like I did today.  I am a VERY nice person overall.  But cross me and I turn into a fucking beast. I hate it. I very rarely if NEVER give someone a reason to freak on me.  And today someone did.  For no reason. NO reason. Man...sometimes I get so frustrated with dealing with people who don't get it. To be on that next level is a privilege, but also a burden to carry. I think you get what I mean. Sorry everyone else sucks.

      I was just upstairs in the bathroom exploding every possible blackhead on my face.  The amount of squiggling that happened was damn near sickening.  Also, the entire lower half of my face is bright red from pinching and squeezing.  I am trying my best to hide my mouth in my shirt.  Yikes. But listen!  I had to do it.  They were getting a little sick. HAPPY SUKKOT to all my Jewish readers. Okay, just to Ari.  We are selling our Lulavs and Etrogs for the holiday.  If you don't know what a Lulav and Etrog is, it is essentially a citron on a stick.  It's pretty cute and if it weren't $35, I would buy one for my bedroom.   Who DOESN'T want a lemon on a stick? I sure would. if I were you. Ate two wonderful hot dogs for lunch. Continue to eat them as the day goes on. Ok enough. Can my journal NOT turn into only entries about flatulance, poop, farts, and acne?  I mean seriously.  What the fuck am I turning into? Eh.  A boy is a boy is a boy.  Boys love to talk about poop. At least the ones that I want to date do. SIKE! or SICK! Big restaurant opening this Saturday!  Going to meet one of my fellow bloggers.  How weird is that???!!!  Pretty cool too.  Very much looking forward to a night out on the town.  I might even dress up and NOT wear my usual cut off shorts. You know how I just LOVE my cut off shorts. Faded blue with patches. Hot. Guess what?  Today I went to the library. Wait, there's more... I love going to the library, cuz they have movies.  And they let you rent the movies for a whole week for FREE! So Rita and I go at least once a week, sometimes 3 times a week, and rent movies.  FOR FREE! This week we got "Godzilla" and "Down to You".  Then today...we found "Harry Potter"!  WHAT?!?!! They have "HARRY POTTER" at the library? ROCK! I quickly snagged it.  Some 5 year old boy wanted to rent it, but I slapped him in the mouth and took it before he could tell his mom.  Please don't tell Rita that I slapped the little boy.  She has issues with me hitting children.   Whatever. So yesterday on the way home, Rita and I stumbled across this exercise bike from 1963.  Some wasteful IDIOT put it out on their stoop to be picked up by the garbage men.  I was mortified.  I IMMEDIATELY picked up this rusted piece of smelly garbage and put it in Kelly's bedroom.  I thought she would LOVE having a new piece of exercise equipment.  Good for the legs. She left a note on the kitchen table this morning saying how much she loved it. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Does this mean I have to take it out of her room and put it back by the curb? I'm too tired to do that part. Kelly...just use it and love it. Paul just called and was pretty fucking adorable.   Ah geez.  Love that ghoulie a lot. So I found out today that (MOST LIKELY) my brother will be able to come home from Germany on block leave from the ARMY.  Well, we already knew that he would most likely be coming home, but he told me today that he is coming home on December 23rd!  He will stay until January 5th!  WOW!!!  He is going to be home for Christmas!!!  I couldn't believe it.  I about shit myself.  Cept I didn't cuz I have constipation still.  But I boofed really loudly.   boofed = farted Of course, there are reasons why this whole thing could fall through, but I am not comfortable getting into them on here.   Let's just keep our fingers crossed, our prayers strong, and our hopes high. My brother might be coming home for CHRISTMAS! Shit yeah. Today after work Rita and I are going to this little gay pub in Queens called the "Albatross".  Paul and I went there this weekend and discovered that they have a dart board, a pool table, and a mega-touch game!  He and I played 8 dollars worth of games.  It was the most fun and I am pretty excited to get out on the town and drink tonight for a bit.   Kelly has been working her ass off this week.  Doubles upon doubles.  She is starting a new restaurant.  From what it sounds like...the word on the town is hinting at...this restaurant is going to be BIG!  Lots of money to be made there, we think.  And she might only have to work 3 or 4 nights. AMAZING!  I really hope this all falls into place for her.  She has been going non-stop, so it would be nice for her to have a bit of a break after the training is complete. She will be joining Ari and I for the restaurant opening on Sat.  So will Rita.  Mariah has to work, but will meet us after 11pm for more drinks at local bars.  Unfortunately, drinks we will have to pay for.   Ok...I think that is it for today.  Almost 5pm and almost time to go home!!!! BTW...I took my nicotine patch off this morning at 7am and I have yet to put it on. Proud of me, eh? I am going to put it on now though.  I still have yet to drink beers and NOT die inside from wanting a smoke so badly.   We will see. Alright...peace jigs!

      Balright.  I have no idea why I am writing right now.  All I know is that I want to write. Came home tonight, had a few beers, played some Mancala (insert trademark symbol), and now stumble around like a doofus. doofus? never doofus. stumble around like an indigo girl. no. that makes no sense. (it's whats playing on the computer right now) (My housemate Rita owns the computer) (she's a lesbian) (shh about her being a lesbian) So in any case...I sit here and write. Been thinking a lot about the Real World today.  Yes, I realize that that could be a scary thing to admit in a public journal.  What with everyone being so "particular" and such.   But I been thinking how Las Vegas is really such bullshit.   I mean, yes.  The Real World isn't EMMY nominating reality television.   But it was the first.  And I have always thought...the best.   A little smut, a lot drama, but sometimes...actually real!  Do you remember New Orleans?  Do you remember Irene with her Lyme Disease?   SIKE!  That was shit. What I really meant was...do you remember Lindsay getting the call? That call that told her that one of her best friends had committed suicide. I mean...do you remember? That was real.  That touched so many people. THAT my friends, was EMMY nominated reality television. And now this. The Vancouver thing really pissed me off.  I never fully explained in this journal how much it really shocked my shit. Let me just tell you this...I really BELIEVED that there was a REAL Lost Season Vancouver.  Seriously.  Walked around telling everyone I knew that the unthinkable happened!  Something went wrong in VANCOUVER and now they are showing it on MTV!!!! Everyone WATCH! Watch me be a fool. You made me a fool MTV.  ME!  Joe Cuttheshit!  The one who realizes that he is 25 and still vehemently supports MTV's programming. And while I can say all of this, I turn on my television last night, so excited, to see Las Vegas.  Oh God.  Las Vegas. Yes.  It IS fun that they will humiliate themselves in front of the nation.  Yes.  It IS personally satisfying to see other people ruining their lives at a faster rate then we seem to be doing.  And if none of all that strikes you...yes.  Yes, it is great to tune into an hour of craziness and debauchery in order to escape the true reality that is our hum drum lives. But you know what? I LOVE the Real World.  I know some very cool people (Rita, Kelly, Ari) that follow this Real World thing as well. I mean...didn't we hope for those beautiful moments?  Those rare moments that would show us a glimpse into what present day reality tv can never hope to do?   A moment of honesty from someone else.  Out of their tv and into our lives.  And for a second we are changed by this experience. Wow.  Whatever.  I wax philosophic about the Real World. But I admit again: I love MTV. I think they do wonderful programming.  (Yes, they have some bullshit, but you tell me one station that doesn't) I am disappointed in the direction in which this Las Vegas bullshit is going. But I will watch.  I will be sad. Sad y'all. Sad. Over it already. Sorry bout all that. What the fuck happened?  I felt like I was sitting here typing furiously away about something that ultimately means nothing to me. I am not THAT journal writer.  The one that explains only opinions on every day social issues.   (if you can even call "The Societal Impact of MTV a social issue) So I guess that's it. Just give me a computer and twenty minutes and I will give you intensity on the first thing that comes to my mind. Hope everyone had a pleasant evening. I did.   And am even more overjoyed that tomorrow is Thursday. One day closer to pretending that I have no responsibilities. Love the weekend. hate the sunday. Enough.

        WELCOME BACK TO THE 9 TRAIN!  ROCK!  I have missed this train in a way that can only be described as "erotic".   Back in the day, you used to be able to take the 1 or the 9 all the way up past where I work.  After September 11th, the 9 train went to sleep for awhile.  Now that things are moving steadily down at ground zero, they have re-installed my favorite train!  Two chances to catch the local up town.  This makes my commuting life so much easier!   Welcome back to you my friend.  Welcome back.  I have poop in my ass.  It feels a bit solid and I don't think it will come out any time soon.  Damn you cigarettes.  Damn you for giving me beautiful diherehea for months and then now...constipation up the ass. hee hee.  double entandra. entendra. tandra. double entandra. entindra. hmmm....entandra and diaherrehea are very hard to spell.  It hurts my inner self. So, as it turns out, we will definitly be going to this restaurant opening on Saturday night.  I am pretty excited about it considering that Ari has invited me to at least a dozen of these events, including the opening of Britney Spear's restaurant "NYLA", and I have yet to go to any of them.  The restaurant is called "Goa" and they are serving free alcohol from 10-11pm.  AND they will give us goodie bags.  What more could you ask for besides GOODIE BAGS? Sorry everyone.  Gotta be on "the list" to get in. If you can bring a very buff, kinda gay guy, with you, I will MAKE SURE that you and your friend are immediatly put on the list. I know people in high places. Eh, Ari? Oh no.  The 4:30pm rush is starting.  Gotta go.

      So when I lost my blogger entry, the only thing I could do to make myself feel better was to scream at the top of my lungs: "FUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCK!" It did feel better, but I only did it cuz I thought that no students were in the office. Then just now I realize that one of the prissiest students ever was sitting in the student office. SHIT! or FUCK!  Whichever. Now I am red faced. And also I peed my panties.

      Once again, I have lost everything that I wrote in this mother fucking journal. FUCK ME! FUCK ME FUCK ME FUCK ME!  a la Exorcist style. Here is a recap of what I wrote about: Real World Las Vegas is smut garbage. Steven is gayer than shit and will annoy you the entire season in proving otherwise. If you believe he could be straight, than you need to go back to gaydar school and figure out which BLATANT lie of his threw you off track. Found 5 monologues last night and half memorized one of them.  Still working and hope to be ready to go by Sunday.  My patch is itching. I ate a huge turkey sandwich, then bit off part of my thumb thinking it was a left over morsel. Farted once. Farted twice. Farted a third time and then resolved to stop farting in my chair. Had the most amazing french fries for dinner last night.  They are GOYA brand and have like zero fat.  They were fresh, tasty, and I almost finished a bag off last night. Shit at work is pretty intense.  See Ari's journal for more details. Debating going to this opening of a restaurant Saturday night. Jerked off 3 times in the last 16 hours.   Getting a haircut since I am now in the running for the next American Pop Idol. And I think that was it. Ah...this condensed version is a much easier read. May have to consider doing it this way always. way way and way. Lata jiggas.

      Hi all! Sorry to have been gone for so long.  This weekend got the best of me and I thought it, um...best, to not go anywhere near the computer.  Paul was here and we had a beautiful time.  We only hooked up once and it was for like 8 minutes.  That kind of sucked, but sometimes there are more important things to do or talk about other than sex.  It was a nice change.  We had some pretty intense conversations as well.  Some of which will find their way to this page, some of which will never come out of my mouth.  :-D Friday night we partied it up in NYC.  Saturday, we saw the movie SIGNS.  (My second time, his first) GO SEE IT!  It's muy brilliante!  Sunday, we went to this great, local gay bar and rocked out.  We got home and ended up staying up just about all night.  We talked and laughed like two girls that haven't seen eachother in years.  Yesterday was a bit depressing as we both had the impending doom of him leaving weighing very heavily on our shoulders.  He got his stuff together and left at 6am in order to make it to the train station by 7.  To be honest, I have had this gaping hole in my heart ever since he took off.  I hate it.  I hate hate hate it.  You would think that after 2 years of doing this, we would have it down to a science.  But lo and behold, it hurts more and more with each arrival and departure.  I guess that's what true love is.   I SAW THE JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE VIDEO THIS MORNING! And about SHIT myself.  DAMNIT!  Why is there such beauty in this world, and why don't I have full access to all of it?   Meaning Justin's penis in Joe's mouth.   I know I know.  I am a child for loving him the way that I do.  But you know what?  When I was 12 and gay, I had to pretend to be in love with Deborah Gibson.  (Not that I didn't love her for her talent and perfume.  I mean Electric Youth y'all.)   Now that I am 25 and gay and out, I feel justified to express my love for my new pop idol. And by pop idol, I am in NO way referring to Miss Kelly Clarkson.  If I hear her overly virbratoed rendition of "A Moment Like This" one more time, I might rip my eyelashes out one by one.  GAH! and also gah. Let's see.... No big NIC dream this weekend.  Prolly cuz I didn't have the patch on for most of it.  Prolly cuz I smoked a couple cigarettes.  Prolly cuz I am not quitting anymore.  SIKE! I am so still quitting.  Just kinda had a little falling out.   IT IS SO HARD!  Don't let any ass tell you differently. So Doris...if you read  urlLink Ari's Journal  you know who Doris is, just came up to me and asked me a question that I definitly know that answer to.  Unfortunately for Doris, that gigantic piece of goop that was stuck to her lip forced me to vomit rather than answer her.  I told her "I don't know" and quickly diverted my eyes before I ended up sitting in a pool of my own bile.  God she is fucking repulsive. Can everyone stop interuppting me?  Marco, our superintendent, who I just found out makes $7,500 more than me, just walked up to me and goes: "Sup dude."  He then proceeds to smile at me all creepily.  Then he just stands there.  I go: "Sup." and he continues to stand there all sexually and weird like.  Eventually I just went back to typing until he got the hint and left. I mean...don't you got better shit to do then stand there looking at me as though I have some double d jugs? I don't get it. What is wrong with the world? Well, I think that might be it for today.  Going to go figure out how to get to this place downtown.  That should take a good half an hour...and then it will be time to go home. (big sigh) Been waiting all day for that moment.

      I thought you would all be upset if a whole day went by without me telling you about the Nic dream I had last night.  No seriously.  If you think that I am just sitting here every day making up stories to tell...you are dead wrong.  DEAD WRONG! All of what I write is pure truth. If you get tired of hearing about my crazy nicotine dreams, leave me a comment.  Not that I will stop writing them or anything.  It will just give me a reason to laugh in your face. Let me begin... I am sitting in my house in Albany and we are having some sort of a party.  My whole family is there, including my gay uncles from California.  Kelly and Rita are also there, and guess what?  So is fucking BJ.  (Does BJ ALWAYS have to be in my nicotine dreams? In case you didn't know, the answer to that question is yes) There are also other people in the house, but they remain faceless, thus making them nameless.  We are all sitting there and talking when someone yells out that we should go to the local indoor playground.  (In Albany, we call it Stompin Grounds.  I worked there for 2 years.  They have big structures made of tubes, and bins full of colored balls to play in.  Although, do NOT play in them.  They are filled with kid piss.  Just an insiders piece of advice for ya.    We all load up into our various cars and drive to Stompin Grounds.  On the way, my uncles say that there is this new dinosaur game that we should all play. (I get very excited cuz I just LOVE dinosaurs.)  We pull up to Stompin Grounds and all file into the building.  Once inside, it is like kid heaven.  There are tons of those tube structures, numerous ball pens, and a food court, and a huge slide, and and and...so many things. I am thrilled!  I look around the place and there are about 100 students from the place that I work at.  They make some sort of announcement that the "Dinosaur game" will start so I run over and get on my uniform.  The uniform for the dinosaur game is kind of like an athlete's jersey.  Mine was red.   I realize that no one else in the group wants to play the dinosaur game.  They only want to eat pizza and sit and watch.  I still play with people that I don't know and they all vary in age.   Some were 3 years old, some were 80 years old. The game begins and I don't know how to play.  All I know is that I have to figure out a way to destroy these so called dinosaurs.   A HUGE door opens from the bottom up and I see the most amazing thing.  There are two dinosaurs that must be at least 80 feet high.  They are gigantor and are both T-rex's.  One is green and one is red.  Oh.  Did I mention that they were made of Lego's?  Cuz they were.  Green and red legos.  Once the door is open, the T-rex's ROAR very loudly and start to step out of their holding pens.  All of the people I am with scream at the top of their lungs and start running to hide.  I am so excited to play and can't wait to get started.  I stand where I am and face the dinos.  The red T-rex steps right in front of me and bends down to pick up a little girl that is next to me.  I start laughing cuz she was caught.  The laughter stopped when I realize that this red lego T-rex swallows the little girl whole.  She just disappears into his massive belly.  I think to myself "Um.  Is this the game I signed up for?  Dying isn't so much fun. "  I quickly run away and hide in climb inside one of the tube structures.  I hide in this yellow tube and watch the T-rex's scour the building for everyone in the game.  Everyone else that I came with sit on the sidelines, eating pizza and cheering for their favorite player.  I see my uncles and they mouth to me:  "YOU CAN DO IT!"  Little boys, old women, grown men, they all get swallowed whole by these dinosaurs.  I start to think to myself: "How do I POSSIBLY destroy them to win the game?"  I see people throwing balls and other various objects at them and all it seems to do is piss them off more.   Even though I am totally hidden in one of the tubes, the red T-rex eyes me and comes charging towards the tube structure I am in.   I climb higher and higher until I at least 20 feet above him.  Now, I don't know how the T-rex does this, but he shrinks to a  smaller, but still huge size, and starts to climb into the tubes after me.   It was at this point that the dream turned into a horrifying nightmare.   I notice that the T-rex is very agile and is climbing up towards me very fast.  I find an exit slide in the tubes and I slide away from him.  Once at the bottom of this amazing slide, I see a lego Betty Rubble and Wilma Flintstone go running by me with one kid above each of their heads.  (Understand this...it may sound bizzare and slightly humorous, but when I saw them run by, a major streak of fear coursed through my veins.)(cuz I mean seriously...no one said that lego betty's and wilma's would be in the game!) I run over to my gay uncle Brad and I say: "Help me!  HELP ME!"  He, along with the rest of my family, BURST out laughing at me and Brad says: "You wanted to play, so go play."  Yikes. I turn around and notice that the green T-rex and spotted me and is charging in my direction.  I look to my right and see a bathroom door.  I run over to it and go inside.  Once inside, I realize that it isn't a bathroom at all, but some sort of EXTREMELY small storage closet.  I lock the door and think to myself: "He could never get in here.  It is air tight and there is a metal door separating the two of us. As I am thinking this, the T-rex starts to ram his head against the door.  The door seems to hold up and I feel relieved.  I'll just wait until the game is over and then I will come out, I think.   But the green T-rex isn't giving up.  He roars loudly and then takes a huge bite out of the top of the door.  I scream as well and back as far as I can into the corner.  The T-rex starts taking bite after bite out of the door, with a HUGE vengence.  The strength he has proves to be too much for the storage closet.  A whole opens up to my right.  After the T-rex finishes off the door, I stand there screaming.  He then lunges at me with the biggest lego teeth I have ever seen.  I quickly jump over his snout and through the hole that has opened up.  I go running as fast as I can back to the huge tube structure that I was in.   The T-rex screams "I AM GOING TO GET YOU!" (Yes, you got that right.  Suddenly the T-rex speaks very good English) I climb and climb into the tubes and once I am at the very highest point of the structure I look down and see his huge head below me.  At this point he is eating someone, but I can't tell who it is.  I look across the room and see this kid Orahn that is a student at my workplace.  (Yes Ari.  Orahn is waving at me from across the room....why the FUCK is he in my dream?)  I wave back, as though I have the time, and look back down at the T-rex.  His doesn't seem to be noticing me, but I notice that on the very top of his skull is a button that says  "PUSH ME".  Without even thinking about it, I vault over the side of the structure and I land directly on the button.  The entire dinosaur collapses VERY GENTLY under me and the T-rex turns into a baby lego T-rex.   Swear to God, the fear leaves me and I think "How cute!"   I pick up the baby T-rex and hold it in the palm of my hand.  I look around the room and no one is running anywhere.  It's just kids playing normal games like "Who can climb the tubes fastest?" or "Try to find me in the balls!" The game seems to be over.  Uncle Brad calls out: "Time to go home."  I go over to meet my family and we leave Stompin' Grounds.  As we walk out to the parking lot, I wake up. WHA WHA WHAT?!?!?!?! And that's it.  But when I woke up, I was still petrified.  Why the FUCK did I dream about this.  Why the FUCK have I had any of the dreams that I have had in the last 3 nights?  I can blame it on the nicotine patch, or I can just accept the fact that I think in ways that only psycho-paths and serial killers think.   Hmmm....

      Would you like to hear about the nicotine dream I had last night due to my ever lovin patch wearin arm? Well here goes... I am at work sitting at my desk with Ari next to me and Rita in her office.  Things seem like a normal and average day.   Suddenly, this other guy I work with, Eli, comes running out of his office and says: "Joe, I need you to take me and a friend to the grocery store to buy some stuff for our dinner tonight."  I'm like "Sure, why not?"  I grab my things and Eli, his friend (some random chick) and I leave my job and get into a car that is supposedly mine, but I have never seen before.  I remember it being early morning as I was getting into the car, but as Eli and I were driving, it was nighttime.  It made sense at the time.  I also remember that the car was busted ugly and that it was a stick shift, with the stick being up against the steering wheel.  Weird. I remember laughing and having a blast while we were in my car.  It was the most fun.  Driving to the grocery store.  Um. yeah. So we get to the grocery store and Eli, this random chick, and I start shopping for bags of chips, sodas etc.  As I turn one of the aisles, I see an ex-girlfriend/friend of mine named Sam.  She was there with some other people I know from college.  I immediately ran back to the aisle I came from and told Eli what was going on.  Eli says: "You have to talk to her.  I will go get the rest of the groceries and meet you at the check-out counter in a little while.  I start to panic a bit, but I say "sure" and start walking over to Sam and crew.   Sam is really rude to me when I talk to her and she is acting like she has become this mighty powerful beastmaster.  I remember hating her in the dream.  I spend about 10 torturous minutes with her and then realize that's it's getting late and I have to meet Eli by the check-out.  I say something off the cuff and rather rude to Sam and head towards the cashiers.  When I get up there,  I realize that Eli has left with his friend and has taken my car.    I am furious!  So angry!  I immediately leave the store and go to a payphone where I call Kelly and ask her to come pick me up.  Within minutes she is at the store, driving a white, convertible VW bug.  (lol) I jump in and she drives as fast as she can to get me back to work.  The roads curve all over the place and we end up having to drive up a mountain.  It is so dark and the only light that she has to drive by is that of the moon.  She speeds up around the corners and I start getting extremely scared at this.  I yell at her to "slow down" and to "stop driving like a maniac".  She tells me to "Relax...that it will be fine" and before we know it, we fall off a cliff and go tumbling over and over down the mountain.  She is screaming the entire way.  I am quiet as we fall, but making sure not to leave my legs under the glove box so that they won't get crushed by the crash that we will inevitably envelop us.   When we do hit the bottom of the mountain, Kelly and I are both alive and fine, but the top of the convertible has ripped off.  The car has landed right side up so Kelly continues to drive back up the mountain.  We speed along and suddenly we are toppling over and over again to the bottom of the mountain.  This time Kelly is laughing and I am screaming.  I am starting to get very scared of her becuase I think that she is trying to kill me.  When the car hits the bottom of the mountain, she speeds up trying to go back up it.  I jump out and she calls after me: "Wait Joe!  I can get you there.  Get back in!"  I scream: "No way!" and I run up the mountain by myself. Once at the top, I realize that my office is right there.  I run inside and up to the third floor where I work.  It is still nighttime and everyone is preparing for whatever big event Eli needed the groceries for.  I go into Eli's office and say to him: "I am so fucking angry with you.  Sit down we need to talk." The students that were in the office have left and Eli sits down across from me.  I start to tell him that I can't believe he took my car and left me at the store and blah blah blah.  Finally Eli opens his mouth and says: "Joe.  I think I might be gay." I say: "Eli, I know.  I have known for awhile."  Suddenly I am not angry about the car anymore.  He stands up and I stand up in front of him and we fully make out for awhile.  I remember being overwhelmingly turned on in the dream and started to fall in love with him at that moment.  At the height of our make-out, the door whips open and one of my co-workers walks in and says: "Stop it.  I need to talk to you two about the event tonight."  We stop kissing and touching and listen to her bullshit.  After she leaves, I tell Eli that he should come by my place later that night.  He agrees and I walk out of his office and out of the dream.   I wake up. ------THE END------ Ok...first of all...that dream was so fucking real!  I am not that attracted to Eli.  In fact, I am MINIMALLY attracted to him at most, but ever since that dream, I am fully in love with him.  When he walked into work this morning, he looked at me as any normal, straight boy would look at another guy and I looked at him with hearts in my eyes.   What is my fucking problem?  The dream last night was much scarier than the one the night before.  Man. Everyone should go on the patch.  It gives you the most incredible dreams of your life.   I went to bed last night at 9:45pm and slept pretty fitfully the entire night.  Quitting smoking has given me horrible constipation and I woke up at 2:30am with feelings of bowel panic.  I sat there for FOREVER trying to go and finally it all flooded out.  What is the fucking deal!?  I hate quitting.  I have like strep throat, constipation, horrible sleeping patterns, and all I want is a smoke.  Ugh. But I will press on.  Keep on keeping on.   Probably going to go to the doctor tomorrow to check out this throat thing.  My glands are so swollen, I feel like they are going to pop and blood will splatter against the computer screen.  Pleasant. Okay, that's it for today.  Am going to go to the doctor's tomorrow, I think.  My froat is so awful.   Enough complaining. But did I mention that it hurts more than I think it ever has in the past? Oh I did? Great.  Go fuck yourself. Just kidding.  No anger allowed on September 11th. Bye kids.

      A conversation I had with Paul today:  P:  "Hi Joe.  Did you get the present I sent in the mail?" J:  "Hi Paul.  I have no idea what you are talking about." P:  "I sent you a present in the mail last week.  Did you get it?" J:  "Oh.  You mean the packet of fliers you sent to me from your office?" P:  "Yeah.  What did you think???" J:  "Well, I read it and then I threw it away." P:  "YOU DID WHAT???" J:  "I read it and then I threw it away." P:  "WHY?  Why would you do something like that?  I made that packet." J:  "You didn't make it Paul.  You stuffed the envelope.  I read the information and then since none of it really applied to me, I threw it in the garbage." P:  "That is so shitty Joe.  I save everything you send me.  Cards, letters, presents.  I keep them all in a designated 'Joe' folder." -----NOTE----- Upon each visit to Paul I have seen letters and cards that I have mailed him shoved behind televisions, under bed mattresses, inside of shoes, etc.  So don't lie to me Paul about being SO CAREFUL with the little love letters I send you. -----END NOTE----- J:  "Paul.  Why would I save this packet of random information?  It's not like you even included a post-it note with the word 'hi' on it.  I have enough trash, so I figured get rid of it before it starts cluttering up my life." P:  "OMIGOD!  OMIGOD!  LD:SJKHF:SLDKH S":DLK H:SDLHJK" J:  "Okay.  Calm down.  I just didn't see why it was important for me to hold onto it." P:  "BECAUSE I SENT IT TO YOU...GARBLE GARBLE SCARY JUMBLINGS OF GARBLE" J:  "Alright look...calm down.  I am sorry I threw the fliers from the insurance company you work at in the garbage." P:  "INSURANCE COMPANY?!?!?!  Do you have any idea what I do with my life?  Do you even know where I work?  Do you do you do you do you do you do you..." J:  "ARGH!  OK!  I AM SORRY!  I don't understand why it means so much to you, but obviously it does..." P:  "Of course it does.  I sent you that packet out of love and because I was thinking of you." J:  "WHAT?  (hysterical laughter) You sent me that packet filled with 3 ridiculous fliers out of love for me???  HAHAHAHAHA" P:  "Fine. Fine.  Be a dick.  I just wish you were more supportive." J:  "Oh shit I'm sorry.  I didn't realize that that packet was supposed to be my birthday card from last month." P:  "I gave you a birthday card!" J:  "Yeah...a month and a half later and it had five lines written in it." P:  "That's not the point.  The point is that you threw away the important packet from my company." J:  "Oh God.  I have to go." P:  "Fine. Bye." J:  "Bye Paul." P:  "I love you." J:  "I love the packet you sent me." P:  "ARGH!  DF:LKHJSDG:LIYUDS:GFLHJKSD:HK!!!!!" J:  "Okay, call me later.  Love you too and bye!"   ----click---- Just thought that you would all appreciate that little story of my ridiculous, yet beautiful relationship with Paul.

      Okay, but I do have one quick funny story. I was just standing in our copier room talking to our Spanish housekeeper.  Now understand that she is totally adorable.  But this story does not make her come out looking so great. So we were standing in the copier room discussing how to prepare steak.  Suddenly, and out of nowhere, she rips a fart louder than the sound of xeroxing being done.  I looked her right in the eye after it happened and she didn't even blink.  Neither did I.  I went on like nothing happened.  But then the smell hit and it was something fierce.  I had kind of forgotten for those few seconds that she had even laid that fart bomb, but the smell reminded me in a way that only eggs can.  I stifled every bit of laughter that I could.  Once I thought I had it fully under controlled, this wonderful and sweet lady ripped another one even louder than the one before it.   At this point I just had to leave.   I knew the smell that was going to follow and I don't think my stomach could have handled another one.

      Kelly, Rita and I decide that we want to spend a night in this beautiful bed and breakfast.  It is run by this 80 something year old lady and the house has about 25 rooms on the upper level.  Kelly, Rita and I each get our own rooms and we begin to unpack.  BJ, who used to live with Kelly and I, decides that he wants to go too and shows up at the house with some of our guy friends from Albany.  As I unpack, I realize that we are about to go out to a local bar in like 15 minutes.  I quickly get dressed and find myself standing outside with a group of about 10 people waiting to drive to this bar.  Kelly and Rita have decided to stay in and not go out.  Once at the bar, I remember drinking margaritas.  Blue margaritas.  I also did a shot of Tequila with BJ. As I got more wasted, I look around the table and notice that my two best friends from Elementary School are at the bar: Shawn and Tyson.  I haven't seen them in years, but they act like we are all still best friends.  I realize how much I have missed them and I spend a majority of the evening hanging out with them, taking shots, and shooting the shit. Suddenly, our friend Alex, from Albany, walks by and I run over and give him a HUGE hug.  He looks good!   He turns to leave and I see this incredibly hot guy sitting without his shirt on at the table that I was sitting at.  I go over, sit on his lap for awhile and then suddenly realize that I am with all straight people and none of them know I am gay.  Except for BJ.  I get off the guy's lap and then sit back down by BJ who grabs my knee and holds it in earnest.  I look at him and he nods to me that no one saw me sitting on this guy's lap.  EXCEPT for the fact that I was sitting on this lap at the SAME table that all of these straight friends of mine were sitting at.  But whatever. Eventually the bar starts to shut down and we all get up and leave to go back to the bed and breakfast.  Everyone is trashed and I sit in the back of a mini-van next to BJ.  We hold hands for a little while, even though I KNOW he is straight at this point.  The van is jam packed...but not with actual jam...and we eventually reach the parking lot of the place we are staying at.  Once we pile out of the van, everyone is conducting their separate conversations and we are all laughing and going crazy.   I leave the group and go upstairs to check on Kelly and Rita.   I see Kelly standing in her bedroom and I ask her where Rita is.  She says that Rita is sleeping and that I will see her in the morning.  Kelly and I sit and talk for awhile.  I tell her about Shawn and Tyson and then we say goodnight.   I go back to my room, get undressed and climb into bed.  I fall asleep. When I wake up, I am in my bed in NYC. Okay what? I was told that being on the nicotine patch caused intense dreams or even nightmares, but this is ridiculous.  The dream was so real and detailed that I don't think I will ever forget it.  The strangest part about this whole thing is that I had the dream between  6-7am this morning.  All of that happened in an hour.   I was so exhausted from partying all night that when I woke up I felt as though I had never gone to bed. Very weird. One last thing... I have, by far, the worst sore throat that I have ever had in my life.  My mom says that it is a side effect from quitting smoking.  While I believe 99% of what comes out of her mouth, I had to check it on the web.  Sure enough, one of the first side effects of quitting smoking is an intense sore throat.  It is so bad that I can't even swallow the spit in my mouth.  My tongue is lolly-gagging all over the place and I feel like an overheated poodle.   I also am in the beginning stages of a stye on my left eye, but if I don't play with it, it will surely go away.   I hope. Quitting smoking not only sucks mentally...it is destroying my body.  My glands are out to my temples.   I look very pretty today. So I guess that's it. Got my patch on again today.  It has officially been 36 hours since my last smoke and I feel pretty good about the whole thing.  The cravings do come, but they do go as well.  I have to keep myself busy.  I find is almost impossible to sit around and watch tv or talk.  All it does is make me want to reach for my pack of Parliaments.  Probably won't be drinking for awhile either.  The temptation to smoke then is just too great.  Yesterday was definitely easier than today.  Tomorrow will probably be even more difficult.   You know?  It's funny.  I feel so much more in tune with myself now that I have cut out cigarettes.  My emotions seem more real and connected to what I am thinking and doing.  It feels good.  Cigarettes seemed to cover up all that I was dealing with.  If upset, I would just smoke a butt.  If angry, I would just smoke a butt.   Now...I have to find other ways to deal with these feelings.  Like actually experiencing them.  Weird. Tomorrow is September 11th and that makes me want to have a cigarette. When I walked in to work this morning I felt pretty comfortable with it being the eve of the anniversary of the tragedy.   Now, having been at this desk for a couple of hours, I find my mood turning dismal.  I feel sad.  I don't know.  It's not something I want to deal with and as much as I know I shouldn't block out these thoughts, I find it is the easiest way to deal with it.  I think that after work tomorrow I might go sit in Central Park for awhile.  Maybe write in my journal and just spend a little time reflecting.  I had originally thought that I would go to a Memorial Service of some kind, but I am starting to think that maybe that is a bad idea.  When I get upset, I prefer to be alone.  That's probably how I will spend the next few days.  Alone.   Thinking and detoxing myself of this whole thing.   I don't want tomorrow to come.  I wish we could just fast forward to Thursday.  Even trying to remember what exactly happened last year at this time is just so overwhelming.  It took me weeks to get myself back together and I don't want to feel that way again.   There was some good that came out of all of it.  Such as the new lease on life, new patience and love for people I don't necessarily like.  But it is very difficult to hold onto these feelings for a long time.  They tend to dissipate a lot faster than the hurt does. Luckily, my and Ari's boss has been completely ignorant to the fact that she or I might not want to be in this shit hole tomorrow.  No offer for some time off to go to a prayer service or anything.  DESPITE the fact that everyone we work with will be taking time out of their day to go to a service.  But Ari and I must answer the fucking phones.  Man...this place is a trip. When everything went down last year, I was sitting right at this very desk, checking the voicemail on the machine and planning for another day of bullshit.  Then suddenly everything changed.   And here we go... Okay enough.  I am getting way too deep for 12:20pm on a Tuesday. Hope everyone gets through the next 48 hours as calmly and introspectively as possible.

      Alrighty!~ What a day so far.  I have quit smoking.  Well, I don't know if I deserve the right to say "I have quit smoking", but up to this point I have had zero today!  It doesn't feel so bad.  I think these nicotine patches I got goin work pretty well.  I am just going to keep my head up and keep praying.  I really want to be quit.  It's time. So I just got off the phone with this lady "Gigi" that is supposed to be my new and hopefully best theater friend in this city.  She was absolutely DARLING on the phone!  She was so nice to me and actually told me that she tries to meet people over the phone before she meets them in person, due to the fact that alot of people suck.  But she told me that she thought I sounded "wonderful, intelligent, fun, and adorable."  She said all of those things!  It made me feel so good. So I am to drop off my headshot/resume/cover letter to her by next week.  She will review it and then she will take me to her agency to get me started.  UM! Of course she and I will get together for dinner or drinks before that.   And I will sex her up. Ok sick.  She is like 60 years old or something. The agency that represents her focuses on both film AND live theater.  There is something for everyone!  I am thrilled. Thank you to my brother for securing this for me.  From what Gigi says, this really may be my ticket to getting my start.  She was very helpful and seems to me to be sent straight from God.  :-D She told me to keep my real name.  She said that it is very American, easy, and also classy.  So there will not be usage of my middle name everyone.  What Gigi says gos.   I am very happy and excited about all of this. Now time to get these damn headshots reproduced.  What else... This weekend was pretty great.  Rita took me to my first BBQ restaurant on Friday and it was phenomenal.  We SHOVED our faces and then went to Toys 'R' Us to buy new board games for our house. We got the "MONSTER GAME CENTER!" which has 13 traditional board games included.  (ie: chess, checkers, etc.) And we also got the SIMPSON TRIVIA game.  It was great!  The game is very hard and I have yet to answer a single question correctly.  Stupid Joe.  Stupid.   Saturday we went out in the city which is ALWAYS fun and last night we watched the finale of SEX AND THE CITY. Overall a pretty great weekend.  I got a ton of sleep.  Haven't gotten to sleep in that late since my Florida vacation.   I spoke with Mariah this morning and she informed me that she has been called back 3 times for Making the Band 2 with P-Diddy! UM! Amazing!!!!!!  I am so excited for her!  There was a whole big story involved with it, but you will have to talk to her to get the scoop! This is MY journal afterall and we don't like it THAT much when people's careers take off.   Unless it's my career, of course. ;) So that's it. Going grocery shopping tonight and dropping off my laundry.  Tomorrow I gotta get these headshots reproduced and then ROCK! Gigi told me that she got a stint on Guiding Light through her agency.  UM.  What is the deal with me and Guiding Light?  This is the second person that told me that they might be able to get me into that soap.   I've never even seen it. So that's it. Everyone wish me luck.  It would be so amazing not to have to come to this shit job anymore.   It would be even more amazing to actually do SOMETHING with acting. Oh man.  Please God.  Please make this work out.

      What a fucking day.  I can't believe that I didn't do ONE second of playing today at work.  I mean...seriously.  Not even a personal email.  It was that busy.  Remember yesterday when I said I was sweating from the amount of running around that I did?  Yeah...well today I reek to high heaven.  Well...that's if heaven smells like onions.   So here I sit at home and actually excited to be sitting here writing.  No rush.  Just simple thinking... Let me first cover the basics... Kelly Clarkson is the American Pop Idol.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  nuff said. The dog sitting that I was sort of doing has ended very anti-climactically.  Kelly will get $25 for doing one night from hell and I will get $30 for taking care of her plants and mail.  Snore.  BUT...on the plus side, she has no idea that I was smoking pot and cigarettes while laying in her bed.  HAHAHAHA. One funny thing...the conversation I had with the dog lady today was very sweet and nice.  Me just happy that she didn't smell shit when she got home.  (I did Febreeze her entire apartment and spray about 8 gallons of "Sunny Day" air freshner...also got her some gerbera daises....actually...now that I think about it...with the money I spent on these air freshining devices, I should just about break even from my share of the cut) great. Anyhoodle... When we were talking she said: "Do you know where the stain on the couch came from?" Now understand this...what in her apartment WASN'T covered in Stains?  I mean seriously.  This bitch done got herself a great place in the city and turned it into GARBAGE!  But whatever, I say to her...what stain...as though her entire couch wasn't covered in stains already.  She's like: "I found this stain on one of the cushions.  I smelled it and it smelled like perfume." UM!  Okay bitch listen...#1...I be gay.  So I didn't have any chicks over while you were gone. #2 I am NOT the kind of gay man that wears perfume. #3.  I turned the cushion over last night cuz that stain that you be talking about is HUGE and was DEFINITLY there when I interviewed.  I remember looking at it and being like: "Wow.  You are one dirty dog lady." And now she tries to blame it on me.   Enough.  Give me my money and you and your crazy, bleeding everywhere dog, go away. The end. In other news... Edward Im'd me today.  Welcome back.  He moves into the city next week.  Oof dah.  Since he has the link to this page, that will be all that I am writing... My mother and brother both called me at work today to see if I had called that agent that my bro told me about. This was my reaction to both: "I am seriously busy at work and I don't have time to discuss MY acting career with either of you." Both said: "But Joe, you WILL call today.  You WILL." I said: "Hi.  Mother and brother...FUCK OFF AND LEAVE ME ALONE!" Fortunately both conversations ended well and I DIDN'T call the lady today just to spite them. oops. I think I spited myself. Will call tomorrow.  But really...GAH!  Give me five seconds to breathe, ok?! Yesterday I bought the EMINEM CD.  Yes I know.  "How could you possibly support him being a homosexual male?!?!?!" You know how?   With $15.  And I love every second of the cd.  Very proud that I own it. I think that Rita has lead me to Paul and my new song.  We have "OUR" song already.  Embarrassed I tell you that it is by the Backstreet Boys.  It is called "I Need You Tonight" and while totally appropriate at the time...times have changed and now so has our song. It's now by Ben Folds Five and it is called....um... It's called #12 on the disc.   Their new disc.  I plan on fully absorbing him into the song and then when he least expects it...I slam him with "Don't you just LOVE our new song???" He will love. I got my pictures from Florida back today.   The best part of my day was not the fact that I got the pictures...it is the fact that 5 rolls of film WITH doubles came to exactly $47.18. $47.18??? By far the cheapest thing I have purchased in NYC.  I am pleased. The pictures came out well.  Actually they came out fucking hysterical.  Paul spent the entire trip trying to "hide" from the camera which turns out to be a very stupid move as he is still IN all the pictures...they just look ugly.  Nice going Pauley. OK...so it's now a half an hour later and I just got off the phone with Mariah. Her girlfriend broke up with her on Tuesday.  UM?! In my opinion better off cuz Mariah is so much better then this pseudo-gay bitch... But for Mariah, I know it hurts. Oh man.  Poor thing.   Can't get into it now. I think I just heard Rita come home from her Tai Chi class. Oh...nope.  It's assholes from upstairs. I guess that's it.  I have been on this computer and the phone since I got home and I have yet to unpack my bags.  Sorry for the chaotic ramblings tonight.   Ah well.  Sometimes the best shit comes from chaotic ramblings. Time to go smoke a bowl. Peace in the middle east y'all. refer back to May's entires to understand that quote.

      Got to be real quick today.  Leave work in about 15 minutes.  Have been so swamped today.  Not even a couple minutes to write.  And as I write this, the head rabbi is mumbling some shit and looking at me like he has work for me. Ugh.  He does. FUCK! Can I have 3 seconds of peace? Guess not. One quick story.  I talked to my brother today.  Turns out that a friend of his in Germany has this godmother named "Gigi" who is this like, well-known actress in NYC.  My brother's friend talked to his godmother and explained my position.  She is 60 years old and has been living as an actress in Manhattan for over 40 years.  Supposedly, she has never worked any other job but acting, and has totally made money and supported herself. I have to call her in the am and set-up a dinner appointment with her for either this weekend or early next week.   HOW EXCITING, RIGHT?  I spoke with this godson today.  His name is Chris.  He was very cool on the phone and told me that she is this incredible lady and knows every agent and connection in NYC.  I am hoping that she is really going to help me out and get me on my way. Wow. Will definitely write more about this in the morning. GAH!   Everyone at work has just officially stepped on my last nerve.  I just went storming into the administrator's office and was forced to act like a cunt. Why do people make me do that? Ugh. FUCKING PHONE! Alright...I must go. I have nothing productive to say right now except that I may kill some well-meaning Jews.  ;) Peace Jigs.

      Oh! One more thing. Remember last Thursday when I wrote the story about the hornet landing on my eyeball? Well... I am standing at the volleyball court on Saturday, when I notice a mosquito buzzing around my head.  When I go to swat at it, suddenly it zooms in and lands on my eyeball. AGAIN! Two species of bugs have landed on my eyeball within days of eachother.  Um. Can that stop?   It hurts when they do that.

      I am get-ting so hot, I wanna take my clothes off............ Okay...work is fucking out of control today.  The phone has yet to stop ringing, the amount of students pouring in through the door represents only one thing...INSANITY! I am sweating, I think.  I have been running around like a crazy person.  Ari is out today and while I fully support her taking time off to do whatever she needs to do, I am here alone and am starting to drown.  Luckily I am leaving for lunch in a couple of minutes, so that should give me some time to clear my head.  My co-workers promise me that it won't be this crazy for the whole week, but what do they know?  They aren't sitting at the front desk selling Rosh Hashana tickets.   On the plus side, the day is FLYING by.  I can't believe it is almost 2pm.   It's all good. This weekend in the Pocono's was one of the best weekends I have had all summer.  Without a doubt.  Rita and I both fully enjoyed ourselves.  We spent about 98% of it getting drunk and laughing and running around like mad people.  In total, there were 9 of us there.  All 6 girls (me included) and three of the 6 boyfriends.  The guys I met were fucking amazing.  These girls have really secured hotties with great personalities.  Okay...they weren't all hotties, just Nina's.  FUCK!  That girl has the hottest boyfriend this side of hot. And he was the one boyfriend that I spent most of my time talking to.  What a gem! lol gem. What am I?  A granny? Friday night, everyone passed out pretty early, cept for a small group of us that decided to get a game of "Spoons" going.  It was fucking fun.  And I won. Hee. Saturday, the girls (me not included this time)_made a huge breakfast for all of us.  We housed, then went to the lake to play a couple games of volleyball and bocce ball.  All the while chugging beers and laughing our tits off.  At one point, I went to tickle Rita's nose with a feather (from a dirty, west nile infected pigeon) when I accidently rubbed it all over her tongue.  Oops.   It was PRETTY funny. Saturday night we had the fucking best meal, then played a trivia game that Rita and I had previously prepared.  We were the most popular for this game.  The girls LOVED it. Then we all got ready and went out to this really nice bar that was having Karaoke.  Everyone sang and went out of their minds.  Then Rita and I took the crew to  Baby Boomers  Dance Club.  HAHAHAHAHAHAHA.   Baby Boomers .   Rita and I soon realized that we were the only ones from NYC when we danced a little more insane then everyone else. You know that Khia song: "My neck, my back, lick my pussy and my crack"? Well...they played that as we were walking in and then right after it, they played "My neck, my back, lick my cock and my sack". It was PRETTY great. We stayed up real late and then all passed out somewhere around 4:30am.  Got up again at 9am for breakfast and talks.  Ended up leaving at 1pm. Very sad to go.  It was so amazing.  So much better than I had anticipated.  And so much better then I ever thought it could be.  I miss these girls with my heart.  I miss having a group of people like this.  6 people makes it so that there really aren't any problems.  You can fight with one and still be part of the group.  It's hard to do that with 3.  And even harder to do that with 2. :-D So....(big sigh) it's over.  We are going to try to plan another get together for sometime in a couple of months.  Rita is in charge this time. The condo that we ended up staying in was so fucking beautiful.  The rooms were huge and everything was just PERFECT!   It all ended up being totally affordable.  Everything really went flawlessly.  No problems.   I, for the first time in my life, have no complaints.   I spent last night dogsitting.  Well, housesitting.  The dog comes back into my life tonight.  God I hope it's not bleeding out of its' vergina anymore.  That is so sick. Gotta see if I can clean up this bitch's apartment too.  It's just so trashed. Last night on  Road Rules ....which by the way was the most amazing episode of the whole season so far!  There is one line in it that was so fucking funny that I literally spit out what I was drinking. The new girl, Raquel, was talking about the challenge.  They had to eat like all of this fucked up stuff.  Like cow brains, cow testicles, etc.  The trick was that the girls had to make it and the guys had to eat it.  They ate and puked like every bite, but eventually accomplished it.  When it was the girls turn, the boys had to make them vanilla smoothies out of cow testicles and some other nasty shit. Raquel says to the camera:  "I'm worried about this challenge.  I mean, I am really hungry, but not for cow penis." It made me SHIT myself.  Wait until you hear her say it.  It's by far the funniest line on the planet!  And she is adorable.  Bye Sarah, hello Raquel.   Welcome. One other note...about a couple weeks ago, I wrote that Shane, the gay one on  Road Rules , was wearing my bathing suit in one scene.  Well last night, Rachel, the lesbian, was wearing one of the polo shirts I own from Urban.  I mean, for real?!?!?! What is the deal with gays all buying the same clothes? ugh.  No wonder people call me fag on the bus.  You can tell by the clothes I wear! Who knew. Ok...seriously typed this in 10 minutes.  Got to get back to work, but these were the things I just HAD to write about today. pth.

       urlLink HAPPY HALLOWEEN!  FUCKING YAY! I think it is possible that Halloween is my favorite holiday of all time.  There are no pressures, no relatives to see, no presents to buy...just good old fashion candy, costumes, and scary movies!  What could be any better than that?? Tonight, Rita, Kelly and I will be going to Jake's for drinks.  There we will drink and laugh and talk and probably SCARE eachother.  Cuz how can you have a Halloween with no scares?  Following this, we will then move over to the Gin Mill where we will drink and laugh and talk and SCARE again!  After this we will go home to watch  urlLink Rocky Horror !  Memble yesterday how I said that Kelly had something up her sleeve as far as Rocky Horror was concerned?   Well! Rita and I woke up this morning to see the Rocky DVD sitting on our kitchen table.  This ADORABLE roommate of mine went out and bought the DVD for our house.  I mean, really!  Is she the fucking best or what??? I woke up this morning and had literal butterflies from being so excited.  Am I serious??  It's just Halloween, but to me it's my birthday!   My 26th birthday.   Work has been a beast in typical Halloween style.   I have never met a group of students that are so damn needy.  I just had a guy in here that I swear was dressed as a baby.  At least that was how he was acting. Then there is this other girl (Ari, it's Dina) that just told me that she was going to "Ladie's" night at a lesbo bar.  Um!  That is totally cool if she would just admit that she was a lesbian!  But she will never.  I even caught her looking at a girl's ass recently.  I feel sorry for people that feel trapped inside their straight persona.  Especially when the person is fucking amazing.  As Dina is. So I just smile and say, "Have fun!" when I know that deep down she will be having more fun than she will ever let on. pth. Last night I opened up my Bible and read me some verses.  Haven't even cracked my Bible in years.  The feeling I had when I started to read was so overwhelming that I physically and emotionally felt small miracles begin to work.  I have been begging for months for God to talk to me.  Then I go and open up my Bible and lo and behold...God talks to me.  It was such a powerful experience for me that I felt like a MORON for not having opened it sooner.   I have ear marked the passage that I read and will be commenting on it in more detail this weekend.  Sorry for those of you who hate Bible/God talk.  It's just such a huge part of my life.   Wait until you read what I read. This Saturday night, Rita is taking me to a party for Jane magazine.  She got an invite in the mail and she is allowed to bring one person.  That person is going to be me!  I might even wear a tie.   Fun right? si mama. Paul has been so adorable lately.  Every phone call he makes to me is filled with nothing, but understanding and support.  So, today, to reward him for being so perfect, I ripped his face off with my acid tongue.   oops. Why do I do that?? He even said: "Joe, why are you lashing out at me?  Why can't we just have things stay good for awhile?" I was so embarrassed that I then put on my fake voice and was like: "Well, you go and have yourself a Happy Halloween!"  "Yeah!  I love you too!"  Yeah!  I MISS YOU TOO!"   Man, I was so annoying.   I hung up with him, went and had a smoke and then called him back after I had returned to my desk.   He wasn't there.   So of COURSE now I feel like a raging douchebag.  Why do I act like that?  Why am I mean to him for no reason some times?  Am I not comfortable with things going well?  GAH!  STOP IT JOE!  STOP IT RIGHT FUCKING NOW! i thtopped it. i better now. HI RANDY! What else? My phone is STILL dead at my apartment.  At this point, I have considered bringing home some heavy duty cans from work that I will connect by a very long, durable string.  Kelly and Rita can take it with them when they go to work and I will keep the corresponding can at home.  That way I can call them up and ask them to bring me home pizza sometimes.   I think it's a pretty good idea. and I just love pizza. Alright...have to jump on some projects that need to be done by 5pm.   Love me because I am beautiful. Or hate me because I act like a lunatic sometimes. Poor Paul.  How does he possibly put up with me?

      Went to the West End for lunch and ate me some spicy wings.  They weren't too terrible.  I did have the waitress bag them up so I could take them home and devour them fat ass style.  Just couldn't allow myself to slobber all over the table.   Read the Village Voice and found some possible theater outlets.  MMMMM...actually only found 2, but that is two more than before lunch.  Again actually...one of them I already knew about, but the that still leaves me with 1 outlet!   YAY OUTLET! What to watch on tv tonight.  My choices are the following: 1)  Predator 2.  (wish it was the first one, but can't complain as there is not much to watch anyway) 2)  The Bachelor (otherwise known as "The show of garbage") 3)  Amazing Race 3  Most likely will watch the "Amazing Race" since it provides the least amount of mental commitment.  10pm is South Park and lately I have been loving it.  10:30pm, MTV debuts a new show about real life crimebusters.   What type of crimes you say? Oh, well you know...the crime of cheating on your girlfriend.  The cameras then follow this "evil-doer" and busts him on National Television. Wow.  Looks like I am going to be up really late tonight watching trash on tv.  GO ME! I got a wonderful email today from one of my readers.   Here is what it said:  "Hi Joe, Did I see an answer to prayer in today's post? I hope you find a peace in the center that let's you make all the changes.  (Insert Reader's Name) PS. I'm a pastor. But I read blogs after work. And I suppose that I read yours because you're the age of my sons and you write so darn well that even when you're in the depths of despair, you describe it well.  And I truly hope you find God faithful."  Beautiful, right? I wish all of my readers could have such class and insight.  I truly enjoy each email I get from this reader.   Thank you to (insert name here) from the bottom of my heart.   I will definitly hold onto my belief in God and Jesus.  They are there for me whether I conciously realize it or not. Rita said something very insightful the other night concerning the whole sprituatlity struggle I am having. She said: "Praying to God is not like a genie in a bottle.  You can't rub it and expect your prayers to be answered like wishes." Well, that is mostly what she said, if not verbatim. She is right.  I expect God to pick up the phone and tell me exactly what to do.  In the past I have had such strong responses from God that I almost feel as though he is a genie in a lamp.  I need to realize that this is clearly not the way that this thing works. If all else fails, I could probably start fasting for a couple of days.  Delirium tends to bring on some major God induced clarity.   I will wait to see if my new ideas pan out or not before I go to that level. Alright enough. The wings in my stomach are starting to flutter. Looks as though I will be going on a mini-vacation.  To the bathroom that is. PEACE!

      Joe Cut the Shit will be working at the GAP!  Or Banana Republic.  One of em.  I hope! I am now looking for a part-time job.  Ugh.  But it has to be done.  I am going on my lunch break to drop off a few applications.  I am not necessarily excited to be working retail, but at the same time, it gets me out of my house and that is a plus!  Wish me luck!  Hopefully I will get to wear a headset.  Oh, that's Old Navy.  But still!  Maybe I can bring in my own headset and if customers ask me where this season's best cashmere is, I can fiddle with my headset, wince from the static that I am picking up, and then nod my head as I tell the customer that it is along the back wall.  :-D YAY! WHAT FUN! And I will get a discount and buy all my future clothes there. And,  yeah.  That's about it. One more day to Halloween!  I just love this holiday.  No pressures to do anything too big.  I never even dress up!  In fact, I will probably wear a tie tomorrow and when people ask me who I am going as, I will say: "Myself, but handsome!" Kelly, Rita and I are supposed to go out for drinks at either Jake's Dilemma or the Gin Mill.  Two very great, very cheap, and very fun bars.  They have Megatouch even!  After we get soused...sick...I am never saying soused again.  The way it echoed in my head was hideous! After we consume a few libations, we will then go home to watch the Rocky Horror Picture Show.  Kelly and I watched it last year and we are thrilled to be welcoming Rita into our new tradition.  Last year we ordered dinner from this restaurant that we love, called  La Locanda.  Depending on how much money we spend this year on sousing, (hee), maybe we can splurge and order from their again. I always get the Margherita Pizza and Caesar Salad.  Kelly gets the chicken paillard.  Last year, she changed her order on the chef and he got angry and sent all of her food to our house piled on top of eachother.  It was one giant lump.  Kelly got angry, called the chef back and he re-sent her her dinner.  He even put a spooky gravy on her mashed potatos!   SIKE! Kelly wishes. We then sat and sang along with the movie while shoving our faces.  It was quite a fun evening. Kelly looked earlier today and saw that it is showing on VH1 at 12am.  UM!  That is a little late for this Joe.  She told me that she would figure it out, so I think she has something up her sleeve.   Either way, I am excited about the event.   A holiday with no stress.   Is there really such a thing? Ari is out today at a funeral.   Please send her an email to let her know that you are thinking of her.  My heart goes out to you P! If I don't piss soon, my bladder is going to kill me  spooky  style. Latas.

      I just stopped over to visit my friend Adam at  urlLink Kansas City Dreaming  and saw that he had written about this girl named Karyn. You are going to  DIE  when you see who "Karyn" is and what she is doing on her website. I am SO jealous and also a little annoyed.  Why didn't I think of this idea first? You MUST go to  urlLink Save Karyn.com  I am stunned!

      Today is the first day of the rest of my life. Or some cliche as equally irritating. I feel better today.  I feel much better.  I woke up and was ready to tackle the day.  I felt like some of the weight that I have been needlessly carrying on my shoulders has finally lightened up a bit.   You see it all started with a house meeting about the move to Manhattan.  I think Kelly, Rita, and I all felt a bit of nervous tension going into the meeting.  We all want what we want out of the situation and I don't think that any of us thought that we would be able to compromise and still be happy.   Kelly immediatly said that the move to Manhattan was just as much an impossibility for her as it was for us. Sigh of relief by Rita and Joe. Kelly then said that she wanted to still move and as soon as possible.  She wants to re-locate to Brooklyn.  Rita and I had thought about it during the day yesterday.  I decided that I thought it was a wonderful idea if only we could wait until after the New Year.  Rita seemed to jive with this idea as well, although she did say that she wants to live in our apartment in Queens for the rest of her red-headed life.   SIKE! But she don't mind staying for awhile longer.   After all of us said what we wanted out of the situation, we agreed that we would start feverishly looking for a new place come January 2nd.  We would hopefully be able to give our landlord notice and be in our new apartment on or around 2/1/03.  Pretty exciting!  Brooklyn will be better for us.  It will be filled with less Latinos and more gays!   I wish. The places we are looking at will be filled with people of all shapes, colors, and sizes.  It's pretty great!  Also, we will be SO much closer to Mariah, which is a HUGE plus for me.  AND the West and East Villages are right around the corner!   ROCK! After this decision, the three of us sat around talking about other business.  At one point, I just lost it and started crying.  I explained that I have been feeling so horribly down these days and that I really feel like I am losing my grip.  I talked about God, acting, my lack of happiness... Both Rita and Kelly had such smart and intuitive advice.  I listened to each of them with such intensity.  I felt my life changing right before my eyes.  Because, as they put it, it is up to me to change my life.  To take more risks.  To make it what I have always wanted it to be.   I was especially encouraged by what Kelly had to say.  I tend to be very hard on her at times because she does things that I only wish I could do.  She takes risks and as an actor AND human being, I need to be able to let go and do that.   Since I want my life changed so badly, why am I not extending myself and trying to achieve it?   It's time. After Rita went to bed, Kelly and I stayed up a bit longer and discussed working together on this theater project she has been kicking around in her head. In the past, when she has talked about it, I always dismissed doing anything with it for a number of reasons.  After we dissected a few conversations that we have had in the last month or so, we both realized that maybe working together on this "piece" would be not only beneficial, but creatively exciting!  I shared my feelings on the project and she seemed to like what I had to offer.  Tonight, aside from working on some cover letters and monologues, I am going to read the play she has picked.  I never thought that I would be so READY to get going on something.  This is that SOMETHING that I needed.   I will report more on this at a later date, but for now, I am just excited to go home and read a new play.  A play that I am going to help produce!  Wow.   Was last night the night that changed my life? I plan on also contacting my friend Mariah and asking her if she will give me voice lessons.  Then I am going to research and join an acting class.  These three endeavors combined with working my full-time job and potentially new part-time job could be the schedule I have been dying to have.  It's time for Joe to stop sitting around feeling horrible.  I have a course of action and I need to pursue it. Maybe my prayers have been answered after all.   God...I hope so. Just think...if I can start implementing this routine into my life AND I have Paul here with me...what else could I possibly lack?   I am sure I will think of something, but for now, I am just plain excited.   Thank you to Kelly and Rita for letting me release last night.  I really needed it.  I was about at the point of internal combustion.   I KNEW there was a reason why they are my best friends.

      Just back from lunch. What a miserable day it is outside.  I have had a chill in my bones since I woke up this morning.  Can't get rid of it for the life of me. Having a house meeting with my roommates tonight to discuss the move to Manhattan.  We have decided that we will NOT be moving onto the island, but Kelly still wants to try to find a place in Brooklyn.  Should prove to be an interesting conversation tonight. My house phone has been dead for a week.  That will be the other issue we discuss.  While the phone needs to be fixed asap, it has been VERY nice not having to listen to it ring every five seconds. Tomorrow I am going part-time job hunting.  Hoping to get a very respectable job at the Gap or Banana Republic.   Has my life really sunk this low? Man.   Seems like I will never crawl out of this ridiculous money hungry, no creative outlet rut I have gotten myself into. Once again I ask God... Where are you?

      The weekend is officially over.   Only when Paul comes to visit does the weekend fly by so incredibly fast.  I mean, he got here last Wed. night and before I even had a chance to fully enjoy him, he was packing his shit to leave.  Once he walked out the door, I felt as though I had been punched in the gut.  My happy little world came crashing down on my broken little heart.   :( This weekend was by far one of the best weekends we have ever had together.  The only time we even SORT OF fought was on Thursday night when we were hanging out with Rita.  Even that was over within minutes.  During the rest of the time, we were a team.  We were laughing and hugging and sitting in eachother's laps at every possible moment.  I didn't want to spend one second away from him.  I felt happier than I have in a long time.  Comfortable and happy. Man, having him leave fucking SUCKS!!!!!! Friday night we went out to dinner.  Saturday night we went to Mariah's show and it was BOMB!  She was absolutely phenomenal.  Her voice is like something from out of this world.  After the show, Paul and I went to this incredibly expensive hotel for drinks.  We hung with Mariah's family and friends from Boston and Albany.  I met so many people and really had the time of my life.  So many of the people there wanted to meet me and get to know me.  I felt like I was actually SHMOOZING for the first time in two years.   I miss those days alot.  I felt like I was a part of the Oswego Theater department again.  :-D I had shots bought for me.  I had drinks handed to me one after another.  I got hit on by one of Mariah's sisters' friends.  THAT was hysterical.  Man.  It's hard to capture it all in here without going on and on... It was a night I will never forget. Paul and I went up to Mariah's hotel room at like 2:30am and smoked some bowls.  I got WASTED and forced myself to puke in the bathroom.  That was a definite highlight.  Mariah has this friend Joanna, who I think is just about the tops!  I spent at least 2 hours talking to only her at the end of the night.  Sometimes you meet people who are so in tune with you, it's like destiny.  Joanna will fit in WONDERFULLY with my friends.  I am glad to have her on board. Mariah made me immensely proud on Saturday night.  I still get choked up thinking about it. Or maybe I am just choked up cuz I miss Paul so deeply.   I don't know what it is.  He has visited so many times before and I have never felt this deeply affected by the separation.   He is having a hard time finding a decent apartment in the city.  I am nervous that it won't work out by 12/1.  I NEED him here now.   For my sanity and our happiness.   I have never loved or been loved this hard by anyone in my entire life.   This kid is it.

      Just ate 2 hot dogs for lunch.  BARF!  They were good and all, but now my insides are doing somersaults.  Joe Cut the Shit is about to really go cut the shit in the baffroom.   ouch. Wanna hear something totally annoying? ... ... well?  I am waiting... ... ... fine, fuck you then, I will tell you anyway. I went to this porn site last Friday and subscribed to 3 days free.  They told me to cancel before the 72 hour period ended and I would not be charged.  I cancelled my subscription within 48 hours, of course.  I even sent them an email ensuring that I wouldn't be charged the $40 fee.  I got an email back yesterday that said that I was all set.  No fees would be given. Today I go to the bank and check my statement at the ATM and wouldn't you know it, they fucking charged me anyway. RAWR! So I come back to work and I make the call to the home office of this porn site (btw, I do it right as I am sitting at my desk and in front of Rabbi's).  I explain the situation and the representative is like: "We can't take the fee off because you didn't cancel it in time." I say:  "Oh yes I did, and I have the email to prove it and the site totally sucked anyway."  I'm like:  "The guys on it are nasty!" He laughs and says: "Fine, I will credit your account." HMPH! SCORE ONE FOR JOE! Paul asked me last night how I ended up getting such a big mouth. "You weren't this bold when I met you", he said. "NYC makes you a fucking asshole", I said. "Bullshit.  I will not be an asshole when I move here.  You are just a crazy person", he said. "(LOL) But Paul, you were already an asshole to begin with!", I said. Paul glowers for a bit. Then I say: "And you know what else...you have no idea how hard it is too live in this city." He cockily laughs in my face as though I have no idea what I am talking about. I punched him in the mouth and then went to look at some more porn. sike.   I can't wait till he moves here.  Every time he struggles with anything, I am going to say: "TOLD YOU SO!" and then pull out my dick and make him suck it. :-D Have a great weekend y'all, if I don't stop in here again. MWAH!

      I was just standing outside of UFM, smoking a cigarette with Rita, when the weirdest thing happened.   We were standing pretty close together, for warmth, I suppose, when this RANDOM old woman, looks me directly in the eye and walks over to stand RIGHT in front of us.  But with her back turned to us.  I mean, she was less than 12 inches from us and she just stood there.   Just stood there. Seriously. She just stood there for about 1 minute and then she walked away.   WHAT?? WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAT? It was so WEIRD! In other news... check out this funny shit:  urlLink Black People Love Us  HAHAHAHAHA!

      Yesterday was quite the day, let me tell you.  Ari took me over to the doctor's and I had a few things checked out.  Got some more shots and spent two hours with people who are much sicker than me.  :( It was nice to be with Ari and to have her be with me for moral support.  I think I may be finally getting better.  Physically I mean.  Emotionally I am still a basket case.   ha! Last night at around 11:30pm, I was laying in my bed ALONE and thinking about how I was going to tell Paul that he had screwed up for the last time.  I was really hurt that he didn't show up.  I decided to have one more smoke before bed and when I was half way through it, I heard the doorbell ring.  Kelly quickly went to get him and within minutes my boyfriend, looking fucking ADORABLE, came into my bedroom.  I screamed: "YAY!".  He burst out laughing and immediatly threw his bag down and jumped into bed with me.  We laid there, me naked, him fully clothed for about an hour, just laughing and telling eachother about our week.  He was so cute I couldn't stand it.  Eventually I ate a burrito and he ate a can of baked beans.  Yes, the room reaked of sweat and fart this morning.  BLECH!   We went to bed around 2:30am and I held him for most of the night.  Slept so well.  Didn't wake up once.  I felt so content being in bed with my boy.  It just makes everything better, you know?  Really can't wait for him to move here permanently on December 1st. Tonight we are going to happy hour with Reets.  Tomorrow it's back to the doctor and then apt. hunting.  Paul is now going through  2  different brokers.  The woman who is his boss at the internet company he works at in Boston, who also happens to be Mariah's old nannying boss, hooked him up with this amazing agent.  She has places lined up for him.  It is going to cost a bit of money, but they have it and need the help.  I am really excited for him.   Tomorrow night we will probably go out to the bars.  Kelly's good friend Ingrid has a show at this bar in the city.  She will be performing 7 songs.  It's quite exciting!  Mariah has a show on Saturday night too.  It is so weird for them both to have a show in the same weekend.  Kelly invited Paul and I to go to Ingrid's show, but it looks as though we won't be going.  Paul isn't too happy about spending the whole weekend watching people sing.  The kid has no tolerance for artists.  Unless it's me.   So this homeless guy on the subway this morning randomly struck up a conversation with this business man.   The business man was reading a book called "Smart Squash" and the homeless man says "Is squash like tennis?"  The business guy ignores him and then the homeless man goes: "SCUSE ME!  SCUSSSSSSSSSE ME!  IS SQUASH LIKE TENNIS???" The business guy puts down the book and is very polite to homeless man.  "Yes, it is like tennis, but it is much different, and in my opinion, much more difficult."   Homeless:  "Do you win when you play?" Business:  "Not usually.  Like I said, it is a very difficult game and I usually lose." Homeless:  "Your attitude sucks!  To be a winner, you have to think like a winner!  Look at me...(at this point, I open my eyes to look at him as well) I play to win.  I never lose."  (I smile to myself and think... oh really ...) Business:  "Well yes.  You must have the right attitude in everything you do.  It is important to stay positive and to pursue new challenges.  It changes you as a person and ultimately..." Homeless:  "Yeah man.  YEAH MAN!  LIKE IF YOU'RE A CRACK WHORE.  THEN BE THE BEST CRACK WHORE IN THE BUSINESS!" Business:  "Um, not exactly.  I think it might be two different..." Homeless:  "AND IF YOU ARE A BABY KILLER...BE THE BEST BABY KILLER OUT THERE!" Business:  "Wow.  No, that is not what I was saying.  I don't know if..." Homeless:  "WE GOT EACHOTHER BRO.  WE GOT EACHOTHER!  I KNOW WHERE YOU COMIN FROM.  IN ALL YOU DO, DO IT WELL." Business:  "I, er...eeee...yikes, um...whoa." Homeless:  "DID Y'ALL HEAR THAT?  THIS GUY AND I AGREE THAT IF YOU ARE A CRACK HEAD, JUST BE AN HONEST CRACK HEAD.  THERE ARE CRACK HEAD ROBBERS AND CRACK HEAD NICE PEOPLE.  BE A CRACK HEAD NICE PEOPLE!" At this point we arrive at my subway stop and business man and I get off at the same time and I swear his face is so red and flushed.  Everyone else on the train seems to be looking at business man and wondering why HE caused such a ruckus.   Poor guy.   He was just trying to learn some new tips about "Smart Squash". Right now I am going to UFM to buy myself some bread and butter.  Why am I craving that today?  I am also so thirsty that I want to chug a lug at least 13 diet cokes.   Unfortunatly, every time I drink soda before 12pm, the housekeeper in my building somehow finds out and scolds me over and over. "If tu' mamita was here, you would drink no soda!  Only juice!  Tu' mommy knows best.  Let mommy get you someting good." I always nod my head and say: "I know" and act all disappointed in myself.  Then she goes and gets me juice.  During the last two days, the juice she has given me has been so rank that I have gagged on the first sip.  It has seriously gone bad.   When she isn't looking, I run to the sink and dump it, pretending as though I have slurped down every last foul sip. Time for bread, smoke, and soda!   What a good day it is shofar.

      MY BROTHER JUST CALLED!!!!!!!! It was absolutely amazing to hear from him.  He has been out in the field doing all these weird ARMY maneuvers for the past 4-5 weeks and it is impossible for him to ever get to the phone.   Imagine my surprise when I answered the phone just know to find out that he was able to call.  We had a GREAT conversation and it just lifted my spirits to heights unknown.  He is coming home for Christmas and I can't wait.   Do you think it's gay incest if I snuggle with him during his entire visit at home?   Yes.  Yes it is Joe. But I just want to spend every possible second talking to him, laughing with him, hugging him, and loving him.  He is my boy and I will always consider him to be my bestest friend on this earth.   You know, in that brother - brother type way.  :-D Man, I miss him so much. He will be back to his apartment on November 6th.  (big sigh) I just got back to work having had lunch with my boss.  While the lunches always go very well, I have to admit that I am happy that I don't have to go again for at least another couple of weeks. I love how DORIS the asshole walks by my computer staring at what I am typing only to be totally busted by the rear view mirror I have on my computer.  I can see what she is doing even when my back is turned. Stupid ass. YES DEBBIE!  You are a STUPID ASS!  Or are you reading this right now? ARE YOU?   THEN KNOW THAT YOU ARE FUCKING UGLY! DEBBIE YOU ARE UGLY! Okay, she's gone now. But really...if she is going to stare at my computer then fuck it if I am going to let her not think that I don't know about it. You have rosacea you ugly ugly woman. I hate u. Okay WHOOO! Sorry bout all that. Just had to rip her face off while she was standing here. Had 2 glasses of wine at lunch.  My throat is still killing me, but drinking does make it better. How does that happen? Rita mentioned that maybe my sinus's are draining into my glands.  I think she could be right. I will have to check that out when I am alone tonight in my bedroom.   Don't ask how I will do it.  Just understand that I WILL do it. Okay, time to go write my friend Randy.  It's been two days since he has heard from me and I need to send him a shout! Latas...

      I was just standing in the elevator by myself and I realized that if I pull up my pants as high as possible, I can give myself the most beautiful camel toe ever seen.  It was quite exciting. Will have to show Rita later. So although I still feel like I want to kill baby bunnies, I am back at work and trying once again to get through the day with more style and grace than I did yesterday.  I refuse to allow my journal to become some angry, bitter bitchfest.  Yet, if that's how I am feeling every day, how can I possibly deny it? For some reason, my right ankle has a problem today.  It feels like I chipped a bone or something.  Now, understanding that I have done minimal to no exercise in the last couple of days, so how is it possible for me to have chipped a bone?  Maybe I did it on the subway?  Maybe while I was shoving pizza into my face last night?   Hell.  Maybe I did it while I jerked off last night.  My masturbatory fantasy was based on circus acrobats, so that makes a bit of sense. In about 2 hours I get to go have lunch with my boss.  He forces this on me every couple of months and I am DUHREADING it.  He is a nice guy and all and he will buy me lunch, but UGH! I hate giving up my only hour of bliss during the day.  Especially for anyone I work with. Guess what?  I use pomeade in my hair now instead of gel. My throat is still raging against my machine.  It's fucking so annoying.  Specially if it is something serious.  I am super finished with this gladular problem I got goin.  Please GO THE FUCK AWAY already! Last night I was watching the show "Crank Yankers", which if you haven't seen, see!  It's pretty fucking hilarious.  Last night, there was a skit on there that was done by  urlLink Sarah Silverman .  If you don't know who Sarah Silverman is, then find out!  She is BY FAR the funniest lady on the planet.  She is raw, real, and so clever that I can't possibly sit and watch anything she does without uriniating all over my bedroom rug.  Hence my need to go home and shampoo my carpet tonight.  Everything about her is great.  I hate comediannes as a general rule, but this girl...now this girl...yeah this girl! Please familiarize yourself with her work. Tonight is another episode of the shit Real World. Maybe Steven will die tonight.  On his tombstone it will read: "I fucked up MY LIFE." God I hate him. What else? Already talked about my sore throat, my ankle, my sarah silverman, hmmmmmmmm................ Is it wrong that I want to go home and get blisteringly drunk tonight? Um, did I just say "blisteringly" drunk? You see, although I have the worst gladular pains possible, I feel otherwise great!  Why should I not drink? Oh gad. Probably going to be another night of shoving my face with soup and sleeping.   gad. This morning as I was leaving for work, Kelly informs me that at like 5:30am the police came with a warrant and tried to bust into our house.  She said that they were pounding on her bedroom door (this door connects to the outside) and showed her a photo of the guy they were trying to arrest.  After a bunch of hullabaloo and crazy antics, they ended up climbing through our kitchen window to get through to our backyard.  The guy lives underneath us.  (we live on the first floor.  He lives in the basement.)  Fucking what? Kelly tells me that Rita woke up and the two of them sat and watched out the window like two crazy old women.  How did I possibly sleep through all of this?  I miss all the fun! Oooh!  One more thing... If you live in NYC, this will affect you. As you may or may not know, the MTA (Metropolitan Transit Authority) will be raising the subway/bus fare $.50.  This means that each ride will now cost the commuter $2.00!   UM! Outrageous!  First it was the cigarettes.  Now it's the metrocard.  This city is going to kill us all.   or at least make us all poor and hungry, but with great calf muscles from walking everywhere. If you think that this increase is completely ludicrous, please go to  urlLink Straphangers  and read more about it. Also, please consider calling George Pataki himself at 212-681-4580 to voice your opinion. In a Democratic society, such as we pretend to have, nothing will ever change unless we open up our mouths and demand it. I will make my call today. When will you make yours? ouch.  My throat hurts. and my ankle too. I am going to write it every five minutes just so none of you forget! Baright. Guess that is it for right now. Paul should be here tomorrow night. ROCK. and  ROLL.

      Came into work feeling pretty ok.  Now I am in a FURIOUS mood.  How does that happen?  Not that I am necessarily angry at anything or anyone in particular.  I guess mostly I am just frustrated with myself.  I fucking HATE my life.  It never goes away.  Every Monday morning reminds me that I am miserable in this city.  I don't know.  No need to dwell on it in here. My throat has closed up shop.  I could tell that I was getting the sore throat thing again on Friday night and sure enough, Saturday morning I woke up with the WORST throat ache this side of the Mississippi.  I have been sucking on Halls, spraying chloroseptic, and basically just taking it really easy.  NO AVAIL!  It still hurts tremendously and it is definitly contributing to my bad attitude.   This weekend was basically suck filled.  Second weekend in a row of suck.   Friday night was great.  Hung with Mariah and she ended up staying over at my place.  That was amazing.  She is so much fun and we have a blast together no matter what we do.   Saturday and Sunday was filled with nothing.  Just me feeling like trash.   Our phone is dead for some reason and since no one really cares about it, it will probably stay dead for a week.  We think the cord might be the problem.  I don't think it's our service. Oh well.   Let it rot. I have been doing so much research today as to what auditions are open to me in this city.   I have to admit, I am fucking frustrated out of my mind.  I can't find anything that is an open call.  Most of them you have to send your headshot/resume and hope to hear back from the group.  I don't want to keep doing this.  I WANT TO BE IN A FUCKING SHOW ALREADY! Damnit. Why is this SO hard? I mean seriously! I just want to audition.  Just go to an audition, say a few lines, be told "That was fine" and go home.  But where the FUCK do I find these auditions? Tomorrow I will get the Villiage Voice.  I will keep checking out my acting websites.  Whatever. Whatever I can do just to get my ass in to a role of some kind. God I miss college. I just want to act.  It's a pretty simple thing. FUCK! Whatever. Can't talk about this anymore. Paul will be coming into town on Wed.  I am pretty excited to see him.  Actually I am THRILLED to see him.  It has been so long.  I am thinking that we will spend a good portion of his visit with him and I hanging by ourselves.  I want all of the time he is here spent laying next to me in my bed.  Maybe going out to a nice dinner.  Or catching a movie.  Or something.  I need some Paul time.  Seriously.   If I don't break this unlucky streak soon, I am probably going to take a knife to my chest.   Just feel so horribly down. GOD! The word HATE does very little to describe how fucking fed up I am with my station in life.

      30 minutes until my weekend starts!   BOOOOOOOO WAH! Tonight I think I am going to be hanging with Mariah.  It's been 5 weeks since I have last seen her.  UM!  She lives in Brooklyn and I live in Queens.  THAT'S the reason I haven't seen her.  Ridiculous, huh?   We try to spend at least an hour or two a week on the phone, but not seeing eachother is just ridiculous.  Her housemates refuse to ever take her out to the lesbo bars, so tonight I will meet her on the Upper East Side, we will have dinner, run some errands, and then attack the lesbian scene.  Poor thing works all the time and is stuck going out "straight" every day of her life.   Tonight that changes! Tell me one thing that is more unsatisfying than a can of soda that is flat the minute you crack it open? So Edward has just written me an email.  I quickly wrote him back.  What is the deal with him?  I haven't heard from him in months and I have really been wondering what his deal is.   Man, he is like this constant reminder of my past.  The whole thing makes me feel weird inside. He has the link to this journal so I can never be fully honest about what I am feeling about him.   I miss him.  That's what I know. I think about him alot. Ah well...I gotta jet.   Time for pizza, naps, and then fun! PEAYCE!

      At 5pm yesterday, I walked out of my office building to find that Paul was NOT waiting for me.  He was nowhere to be found.  Rita and I got on the subway and went home.  There I sat, drinking a beer and starting to get extremely worried.  Why hadn't he called?  Even once!?!?! At around 7:30pm the phone rings and I answer it.   Paul says: "Hi." I say:  "Where have you been?  Why haven't you called?" Paul:  "SORRY!  God!  I forgot my phone and the broker took us around the city in cabs and there was no way for me to call you." I:  "There is no excuse.  You were supposed to pick me up at work and then you never showed up, you never called, you never contacted me at any point to let me know what was going on.  I am fucking furious with you and I have been stressed out for the last 5 hours!" Paul:  "Whatever.  I didn't make it.  I said sorry."   I:  "GOD!  Alright...enough.  I don't want to talk about this shit anymore.  But you fucked up big time no matter what you say." Paul:  "Did you eat dinner?" I:  "No."   Paul:  "Are you hungry?" I:  "No." Paul:  "Fine then.  I am going to go out to eat with Jen and Lisa and we will swing by your place before we head home." I:  "ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!?!?!?!?!?!:LHKSD:LSHKDF:LK?!?!?!?!?!?!?!  You were supposed to pick me up at fucking 5pm!  Get your ass in the car and get over here NOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!" Paul:  "No!  Meet us in the West Village." I:  "Omigod.  Get here now.  I am serious.  I am NOT coming back into the city after you ditched me.  Get in the car and get over here now Paul.  FUCKING NOW!" Paul:  "Fine, but we are going to dinner whether you want to eat or not." I:  "You crazy fuck just get here!" ---end scene--- Paul shows up at my house at around 9pm.  I immediatly jump into his arms and we giggle and kiss eachother all over like two little gay babies. His new roommates were there: Jen, whom we both already know, and this new girl Lisa.  They are both incredibly sweet, a bit reserved, but also very very chill.   The three of us went to dinner and had an AMAZING meal.  We had some wine, laughed, got to know Paul's new roommates, and Paul and I even held hands in a straight restaurant.  Instigated by him, I might add.  It was an absolutly beautiful evening.  After the meal was over, they dropped me off at the house and I asked Paul to come in for a minute or two.  We sucked face and just held eachother for a couple of minutes in my kitchen.  Then he had to go.   My heart was SUCKED out of my chest and I just stood there, paralyzed by the overwhelming two hours that I had with him.  It was incredible and sad all at the same time. While Paul and I screamed at eachother all week, the connection we had when we were together was out of this world.  It was pure electricity.  There were no fights, there was nothing but smiles and happiness.  We were in love.   Now I am so excited to see him for our long weekend.   I know that we have had quite the horrific week, but at the same time it will all prove to be worth it.   We are both stressed and we are both going crazy, but hopefully crazy with love.   Guess time will tell.

      4:53pm and still no word from Paul.  Either way I am annoyed now. If he isn't outside waiting for me when I leave work, I will chop off his nuts. If he is outside waiting for me when I leave work, I will kiss him, then chop off his nuts. Why does he play these stupid fucking games? It's in no way cute.  It's purely annoying.   Great job again Paul. Boyfriend of the year.

      You know what I just thought... Paul is probably not calling me so that he can come to work and surprise me. Now understand that it is in NO WAY a surprise that Paul is in the city today.  But he has a tendency to pull this stupid shit all the time.  For example, we will have plans to visit for weeks...then the day he is supposed to come, he will call me to tell me that he can't make it.  Of course I FLIP the fuck out and go crazy on him.  Then 5 hours later, after my whole day is ruined by his horrible antics, he will show up at my job and go "Surprise!".   Um, does anyone else find that at all logical? My boyfriend is a fucking weirdo that hurts me in order to make me happy. Interesting...

      Got my hairs cut cuz Paul is supposed to be picking me up from work. Only problem is that it is 3:45pm and no word yet from Paul. Please God don't let him not call me.  If this kid comes to NYC and does not see me, I just might drive to Boston tomorrow and punch him square in the head.

      Kelly just called to tell me that she ran into Darlene (Sarah Gilbert) on the street just now.  Kelly looked back to see if it was her and in an odd coincidence, Darlene looked back to see if it was Kelly.   WEIRDENS! NYC is PRETTY great.

      Thank you to everyone for sticking by me even though I tend to be a massive psycho on occassion. Imagine dating me! Paul and I talked for a couple of hours last night.  We were laughing for most of it.  After he had hung up on me for the second time in a row, I gave it twenty minutes and called back and said: "Isn't it adorable how we scream and yell and one of us hangs up, but then just calls back in 20 minutes to scream and yell again?"  He was incredibly sweet last night and although we don't see eye to eye on the fights of the last week, we do understand that both of us have such a deep love and sensitivity to the other person that the littlest thing will push us right off the deep end.   Randy wrote me an email this morning and brought up something that I think is very interesting.  He mentioned that Paul and I seem to have a very dramatic relationship and that we are always dealing with something or other. Now, while this can be true at times, mostly it isn't like this at all.  People that read this journal get a partial understanding as to who I am and how I react to things.  I come to this journal to write the word "douchebag" and "cunt" and I allow myself to flip out to the point of insanity.  In real life, it is rare that I FLIP OUT so intensely.  I mean, let's be honest.  I have been known to flip out intensely during my life.  But not nearly as much as my journal seems to represent.  I just like the fact that I can come in here, rant and rave, and walk away feeling a little bit of release. One thing that should always be understood by my readers: "Joe is the best and Paul is the second best". :-D In other news... (again with that "in other news" shit) Last night Rita and I welcomed Kelly home.  The two of them made dinner for eachother and I hung out for a bit.  It was nice to be reunited, if only for an hour or so.  Kelly works non-stop this weekend, so we will not see her again until Sunday when we have our next dinner and pumpkin carving adventure!  Fun, right?  I think my pumpkin is going to be a bodybuilder.  Swedish bodybuilder, perhaps.   There is some SHIT going down here at work.  Last night there was a HUGE fight that broke out between Ari, myself, and this other woman.  If you read Ari's journal, you know her as Doris.   Doris is a BEAST!  And yesterday I felt that she crossed the line with her attitude.  I had already left work and I came back into the office to tell her that I thought she was unprofessional and out of line.  When I started telling her this, she didn't like it so much.   hahaha who would? But in any case, she FLIPPED and I just kept egging her on.  Eventually she comes out of her office and begins screaming at the top of her lungs.  Ari tells her to "SHUT UP, there are students here!", but she keeps on screaming. OOOOOOOOOH!  FUN! Life is so much better at work when shit is going DOWN! So last night I jerked off for the first time in like 5 days.  I thought that it would feel PRETTY good, but it only felt, well... good. But did I pump out about 3 quarts of cum? Yeah.  Yeah I did. And I KNOW you were dying to hear that delicious story. Oh! One important thing... Last night, Rita talked to her sister Jeannie for awhile on the phone.  Jeannie is getting married in about 23 days and we are all kind of freaking out.  It will be the first wedding that I have ever been to in my life.  I went to one wedding once, but I didn't know the people and it was totally gaylord.   This one though!  This one is going to be for my best friend's sister and I actually got my OWN invite in the mail and I get to bring a date!  (Paul said no, cuz he feels that "we aren't ready for our big coming out party at a straight person's wedding" - so he gets to not go and I will bring Kelly instead.  My other boyfriend)  I am TOTALLY STOKED about it.  I get to dress up in my nicest ballgown and then I get to eat so much good food and then I get to drink so much champagne and then I think I just realized that this is Jeannie's wedding and not mine. hmph. In any case, Jeannie had asked to talk to me for a few minutes on the phone, so Rita hands it to me and I'm like "HI!" We bullshit for a couple of minutes and then Jeannie does something that totally throws me for a loop.  A curve ball if you will.   She is like: "I have been reading your journal and I know what you are going through."  I act all aloof and I am like: "Oh really?  Thanks for thinking of me."  Jeannie doesn't accept this answer and dives into a very serious conversation with me about how she feels the same way I do sometimes and how prayer really keeps her strong and and and and... While I wasn't ready for her to go right for my insecurities, I was able to really let go with her and I walked away from the conversation feeling "healed" in some way.   I find myself always putting on a front with people.  Not in a bad way, just in an "I don't want to really show you my true feelings" way.  Jeannie doesn't tolerate that Joe.  And that is the reason why I absolutely love her to death.  I want (certain) people in my life to call out the stops with me.  Even though I don't know her all that well, I know so much about her as does she with me.  I like that after she stripped me of my walls, she talked with me about what I could do to make myself feel better.  She knew what to say because she truly understood me.   Jeannie also believes very furvantly (fervantly? fuhvantly?) in the power of prayer.  She informed me that she has been saying quite a few for me these days and that she truly believes that my prayers will be answered.  She is a woman of God and I am so thankful to have her on my side. Thank you Jeannie! I love you so much and thank you so much for last night. MWAH! Baright. Just about time for lunch. Time to go slap Rita around for a bit.  She is acting all high and mighty today and I think that for lunch she wants a mayonaisse slap.  With extra lettuce.  :-D

      Didn't make it to get my hairs cut today because received a WONDERFUL email from Paul telling me that he will not be coming to NYC at all tonight.  He will be here from 8am-6pm tomorrow.  Considering that I work from 9am-5pm that will leave about 15 minutes for us to see eachother. It's been 5 and a half weeks since I have last laid eyes on him. Douche. Fucking douche.   Man I hate this.  Can he just move here already?  I miss him so terribly and these fake visits are really eating away at my insides. When I woke up this morning, although I was frustrated as all hell about this visit, I still thought to myself "At least I won't be sleeping alone tonight." Now of course! Why wake up and rely on anything?!?!?!   We spent about 20 minutes on the phone screaming at eachother about why he is such a fucking asshole.   And then I spent 20 minutes after that thinking about why I am such a screaming mimi. I JUST WANT TO SEE HIM!   I hate not being able to control the world.   I need to just relax.  He will be here for like 5 days next week.  But I really needed to see him for at least a little bit THIS week.  But why should I ever need anything from him? He doesn't come through when I do.  At least not unless it benefits him in some way. gggggggggggrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! (growls) It's going to be a pretty lonely night in my bed.

      Well fucking YAY!  I am back at work. ugh. Even though I spent most of the day in the doctor's office yesterday, I still find that to be more enjoyable than sitting here in my chair at my extremely unrewarding job. Enough of that talk. What's going on these days... Paul is supposed to come in to town tonight.  It's a last minute change on the plans we had.  He was SUPPOSED to come here on Thursday and stay until Saturday morning.  Because he thought that it would serve HIS purposes better by coming tonight at 11pm and leaving tomorrow at 7pm, that is what will be happening. I was pretty furious last night and in fact, am still upset that he doesn't make any sort of effort to include me into our plans.   I mean, he is coming to see ME, right? Very frustrating. The only good thing about all of this is that he will be staying with me from Wed.-Sun. next week.  While that is great and will be an extended visit, I have things to do during that time.   Oh it's so irritating that even writing about it is driving me crazy. Don't feel like explaining anymore. Let's switch gears. Talked to my friend Randy on the phone for just about 2 hours on Monday night.  It was an absolutely great conversation.  This guy makes me laugh, makes me question, and also opens me up to things I have never really considered in the past.  While we are very different, we are also very much the same.  I find myself opening up to him about things that I really should keep quiet about.  I think he feels the same. For example...Randy has decided that he is so open minded with his sexual endeavors that he would be willing to.... SIKE! I promised him that I would keep his business out of this journal and I will do just that. But Randy...do you KNOW where I was going with that? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA oh So yeah, I really like this guy.  I hope to keep up with him and to bother him with my drunken slobbery every night of the week.   BTW...if you didn't see the Real World last night, you really missed out.  This cast is so unbelievably irritating that I can't sit still and watch it.  I drag my fingernails down my face during just about every scene.  Someone kill these people.  Steven dies first. Today I need to get my haircut.   Did you ever just not WANT to get your haircut? I mean, it sounds like no big deal.  Just do it Joe.  Stop acting like a baby about everything. But in all honesty, I hate sitting in that chair making stupid conversation until they are done butchering me.   See, the problem is that I have Asian hair; pin straight and damn near the worst style to have when it grows out.  If put off for too long, my head turns into some sort of spikey beast that, when covered in gel, brutally wounds all those that try to hug me during the day.   Oh and by the way.  Stop hugging me.  That will kill any sort of ridiculous hair comment that might fall out of your mouth when I am trying to avoid your impending hug. Don't touch me. Why is it that some people understand the no touching rule, while others feel that it is their personal challenge to make you comfortable with it? Wow...I hate people, huh? Not really.  But sometimes yes. Today I was riding the local train uptown and decided to close my eyes.  I have about 9 stops before I have to get off the train. In what seemed to be 2 minutes and 30 seconds, I was already uptown and past my stop for work.  I opened my eyes to see my sorry white ass zipping into Harlem.  I told Rita that when I opened my eyes, I SWEAR that everyone's face on the train turned from white to black.  And also became very angry.   Black hemoss. It was a little disconcerting. I quickly switched sides to go back downtown and realized: "I NEVER want to live in Harlem." Never. Harlem is for people who have tough skin.  Tough black skin. Astoria is for short in stature latinos. That's why I live there. come esta? Do you know that song "Twisted" by Keith Sweat?  It's kind of an annoying song and it seems to be playing on repeat on my computer right now. I am about to "Twist" Keith Sweat's nipples right off.   Purple lurple style. Have any of you ever played "Tune in Tokyo" before? If not...this is how you play: Tell a female friend to put her hands on her head so that her elbows jut out from each side of her face. Tell her then twist her body from one side to the other while saying "Boop boop boop boop..." While she is doing that, quickly grab both of her nipples, twisting them and saying: "Tune in Tokyo!"  "TUNE IN TOKYO!" Act like you are really scared about getting the right frequency on her nipple radio. That way she can't possibly get mad about you hurting her titties.  I mean, you are really trying to culture yourself by listening to Asian music. It's PRETTY fun. Is it wrong that the woman rabbi that I work with has a HOT brother? Is it wrong that he may have caught me looking at his ass? Is it wrong that I was pulling on my dick at the time? Alright Joe.  No more crass attitude today. So there is this lady that I work with that just happens to be my programming boss. She is probably my favorite person to work with although I hate her very deeply sometimes.  I really have no favorite at work.  They all suck.  But she sucks the least. Anyway, she has this smarmy way of saying things to me in front of students or other staff members. My new thing... When she says these comments, I then say a MUCH ruder comment back to her and embarrass her in front of the student or staff member.  It is childish and sometimes I feel bad when she gets red faced and walks away. But doesn't that mean that she should STOP saying rude shit? I think she WANTS me to make her feel like an asshole. She does. It's just too bad.  Cuz I do like her.  But I like not being embarrassed better. Okay, that's it.  Off to lunch. And to get my fucking hairs cut. I hate it. hate it  hate it want to eat pizza and mcdonalds for lunch instead of getting my hairs cut. hate it.

      What a day. Days like today make me stop and think how happy I am to be alive and to be doing what I am doing in NYC.   I have had to deal with some very complicated and impossibly difficult situations in the past two years.  Sob sob.  I know.  But really...I havent been happy with who I am, since, well,  I graduated college in May 2000. Every day I go through moments that make me want to run to the bathroom and vomit out all the shit that is dragging me down. Very often my alarm goes off at 7:15am and I think to myself Today I will come right home and go to bed. Most of the time, people in my life, in ways that they dont realize, change my perspective and I find myself hanging out and laughing until 9pm that same evening. But when the sadness is too strong...when no one can pull you out of it....when you feel as though you would rather have something awful happen in your life just so that you have a reason to be as down as you are... I want to be an actor. Very badly. I want to have the life I KNOW I could have if I could just get my life together and try. I am so scared.   I have never been this scared in my life. I am 25. Its time to make something of myself.  Every day I dread the next day.  A day closer to me not doing what I want with my life.   Change it you say. Stop wallowing in your self-pity and do what you should be doing. Grow up already. While I hate you for thinking that, I agree with you. Its weak and useless to sit in your miserable life and not make any attempt to change anything. I give this advice out to every single person in my life. Why arent YOU doing what you want with your life? Why are you YOU sitting there and letting life stomp on your face? Why? Because I am sitting here doing the same thing. I have moments where I feel deep down that things are going to change. I feel better! I feel strong! I feel alive. Then something happens... The littlest thing.   Paul calls and we have a stupid argument. Thats it...home to bed. I have a fight with one of my housemates. Well, cant be an actor now!  I have to worry and stress over how to fix this new problem. None of this is anyone elses fault but my own.  I know this. I have GREAT days  and I have HORRIBLE days. The days that are nothing are wonderful, refreshing, and few and far between. Do you ever feel as though you have too much emotion? Sometimes I feel like I am the only one in the world that feels as deeply about EVERY little thing that happens in my life. Sometimes it makes me go undeniably insane in my head. I know my close friends analyze everything as deeply as I do or we wouldnt have formed the bonds that we have. But even they would admit that they feel alone when it comes to society understanding how deeply affected they, as individuals, are by every moment of their day. If you are reading this right now, odds are that you understand what I am talking about. In my opinion, one of the reasons we read others journals is to find someone else who makes us feel not as alone. Horrible sentence structure, but you understand. I want to be strong again.  I want to feel self-confidence.  I want the esteem that I had when I graduated college.  I was at the top of my game. I always scoffed at those that left college and let their life turn to crap. I mean, SCOFFED. Now, I am worse than any of them ever were. You want to talk about turning your life into crap? Growing up I was always ETERNALLY optimistic. I was THAT gay kid.  The one always in a good mood.  Hey!  Wanna laugh?  Come hang with Joe the gay kid. Even when I struggled through the most horrifying moments of my childhood, I found a way to smile and laugh despite. Rita knows this as the Happy Boy Syndrome.   One day, all of this optimism ceases and you start to doubt who you are and begin to wonder why you were ever so happy to begin with. I went through a full year of (as only I can understand it) hardcore depression.   Prozac, therapy, the whole nine yards. Okay, maybe 7 yards, cuz I wasnt fucking crazy. Just burning myself sometimes. HA~! Right??  Cuz I did that. However, lets talk about being dramatic... Joe burns himself, but sits here today with no scars, minus one POSSIBLE scar that probably happened when I was shoving my face with donuts while taking a shit on the toilet. Oh man.  Dont get me started with what a loser I was when I was a fat little happy gay boy. So whatever.  I was bad. Kelly was there through all of it and that is where a lot of the understanding in our friendship comes from. She gets the sad part of me. As does Rita... For reasons of her own. For Ritas of her own. giggle snort boof In any case, when I went through that tough time, I lost my optimism.  I lost myself.  I was sad beyond the point of repair.  Optimisim was for fools.   It sucked. Cuz that is not me. After the year ended, I got my optimism back.  It just kinda happened.  My life took some drastic changes (switching majors to theater, coming out of my closet (closet? I had a very EASY coming out of closet experience thanks to surrounding myself with beautiful people prior), and letting my insecurities drop regardless of what anyone else thought-----and I became that optimistic Joe once again. The Joe that had way many more good days than bad days.  It was exactly who I wanted to be. Then without realizing it...after college...the bad Joe came back. The Joe that didnt know how to succeed without a handbook.  The Joe that allowed himself to dive into a hole too big to climb out of. Now that I am here, I find myself clawing at the side of my (I picture it dirt) hole, making some ground, and before you know it...slipping right back to the bottom. My prayers have been filled with such intense passion and helplessness. I have started to make my way back to God. Its funny... When things are going your way, you have to work even harder to keep the communication lines open with God. Yet the minute things get bad, there you are begging and pleading for an answer. While I have prayed every day my whole life, I see now that I need to do more. That I shouldnt expect him to help me unless I am doing it for him and with him. Its hard to explain if you find yourself atheist or not believing in any sort of determined deity. Its okay. Please.  Everyone needs to figure things out in a way that will make sense to them. But I know what I believe. I believe that I need help. I need an answer.  I pray, I write in this journal, I talk incessantly to my friends and boyfriend about all of this. Where is my direction? What cant I find MY path??? I am confident that I will find it eventually.  How could I live on this earth if I didnt feel this way? Im just scared that I have followed the wrong path up until now. What if I was supposed to be a teacher? What if I was supposed to be in a secure job in a nice suburban city? OKAY WHAT?  OKAY...WHOA WHOA WHOA See...even writing those words makes no sense to me. Thats not me. I am meant to be an actor. LOL. I try to sit here and type what my fears ultimately are... But I see the words and I die laughing.   I am still optimistic enough to think that I am going to go somewhere with this theater thing.  As sad as I get...be a teacher in a suburban school? BOO WAHHHHH!. No no no no no I LOVE me some teachers. But I dont be me some teachers. I hate it, but I am always called back to the horrible adage of: Those who cant do, teach. I do NOT agree with that at all! But I refuse to ever fall into that category. Unless I am 40 and still struggling to get my first audition. Then maybe its time to teach nursery school dickheads. hahahaha you think.  Joe be a nursery school teacher?  NEVLE! But you know what? I got that knack for kids.  It has always clicked with me. I started my own Babysitters Club when I was about 12.   Yes, member?...I was gay. I played Ken in the neighboorhood show (that I produced) Barbie and the Rockers. Ok enough. Can this journal be any more self-effacing? Well, if self-effacing is a bad thing. Enough. Time to go to bed. Tomorrow I will not be going to work. I get to suck up my fear and go see a doctor. You see, Joe has something that he has to take care of. Hells if you will ever know what it is... But for those of you who do know.....YIPES~! Hey,  Its my own fault and I face it with courage and dignity. Stupid Joe.  Stupid Joe. Besides that, I have about 101 Dalmations to figure out tomorrow. No I didnt. Yeah I did. So much to do.  I hate using sick days as real life days. Sick days are meant for smoking pot and watching scary movies. Oh yeah.  I do that every day anyway. Sick days have now become productive days.  It happened HERE folks!  Sick days are productive days. Oh yeah again! The reason I had a good day today are because of the following reasons: 1) I acted like a smarmy bitch at work and people seem to respect it and love me more for it.  Balright. 2)  I had a fight with Paul and he fixed it in two seconds flat by allowing, ONCE AGAIN, me to be a psycho and him to just understand that I am a lunatic. 3)  Ritas impromptu invite for drinks at Jakes Dilemma.  While I fought to keep a smile on my face all day, tonight I sit with a genuine peace and contentment. My life could change tomorrow. Right around the corner is the little dirt paved road leading to my success. My optimism kicks in and I realize that it is my time. For clarity. Joe will do this yall! Just give me some time. Eventually all of my entries will be about this and that soap opera star that is really gay, but pretends to be straight while on ACCESS HOLLYWOOD. You just wait! Wow. I feel better. Good feeling.   I gotta remember this. Write in your journal and by the end, you can once again take on the world. (also Joe...remember to have 3 glasses of wine while conquering the world)

      Barfaria~! I took two aleve about a half hour ago and now they are trapped somewhere between my esophagus and my chest cavity.  (cough cough) Get the fuck OUT! Well this Monday is almost over!  Thank the Lord in Heaven above.  I have spent most of the day researching doctor's as I have to go tomorrow to "get a few things taken care of".  Annoying.  But also finally! We had a staff meeting this morning that was so fucking boring.  That part is business baz usual.  But the odd part, I couldn't stop bursting out laughing.  I don't know what the deal was.  I kept staring my executive director right in the face and then suddenly would just go "BOOWAH!" and die laughing.  It was pretty ridiculous. This afternoon I ate McDonalds with Rita for the first time in about 6 months.  YuM!  But also massive diarehhea.   Friday night, Rita and I took her boyfriend out for drinks at this place called The Gin Mill.  I had been there a couple weeks ago and I LOVED it!  During Happy Hour, the pitchers are $6.  The entire bar is half off.  Which means that a vodka tonic costs around $3.  IT was pretty great!  We got plastered and played about a thousand games on Megatouch.  Of course I prefer to play Photo hunt Hunks.  But we had to play photo hunt Babes for Andy.  Then Rita made us play photo hunt General which was pretty difficult.  I am much better at finding the missing labia then I am at finding the missing toothpick.  You know how it goes. Saturday I watched "Frailty" for the second time, with the Andy and Rita.  Second viewing was just like the first viewing.  Cept I got to eat some Peanut M'n'M's the second time around.   After that I seemed to lay in my bed for the rest of the weekend.  Of course I got up to shit and shower.  And also to make 3 pounds of chicken.  I ate every bite.  Sunday was loll around in bed day again, but this time with monologue books shoved up my ass.  It was a very productive, horribly anxiety filled afternoon.  By 6pm I calmed down a bit, realized that of COURSE I am going to make it as an actor, and then I went back to sleep. I love the weather right now.  It's Freezing!  Climbing under the covers, cuddling with....oh wait...with no one.  Cuz boyfriend lives about 280 miles away. Speaking of Paul... We spent 2 hours on the phone Friday night and it was WONDERFUL.  We touched base on a lot of different things.  I can't believe I haven't seen his face in 5 weeks!  He will be in town on Thursday, with his two future roommates.  Yay I get to see Paul.  NAY I get to spend all Thursday night with these two girls.  And they have to stay at my house which is ULTRA annoying, cuz I don't even know them.  Ah well.  They can sleep in the living room while Paul and I lay naked in my bed. Hee pth. I think I am going to accompany him back to Boston this weekend.  Not sure yet.  But it's an idea.  Been along time since I have been back there. Alright...I will do my best to write in here later.  I have some computer shit to do and will most likely stop in to this to write something a little more interesting than the jargon I just spewed out.   Forgive me for the quick nonsense.  I wanted to make sure I touched base before I took off to go home. Lovel me!

       It's Friday night and I JU JU JU JU JUSSSSST, got PAID!  MONEY MONEY MONEY   That is a song.  Do you know it??? Shit!  I was planning on doing an entry in here, but then I got totally sidetracked by people at work and now I am like typing my ass off so that I can get out of here at exactly 2pm. WOOF! did i just bark? This weekend, Rita's boyfriend is coming into town.  We are going out to happy hour and then to night time hour and then to after hours and then to bed.  It should be a raging alcoholic good time.  I hope so at least. It is POURING today.  It is quite miserable outside except I love this kind of weather and I can't wait to spend the whole day in bed tomorrow watching it drizzle down my window.  How romantic!  Especially since I will be spending it alone. playing with myself of course. how romantic! In any case, gonna grab a slice of pizza on the way home.   Already had breakfast of hash browns and toast.  I prefer only side dishes for breakfast.  Never main courses. What else? Last night I smashed a wine glass in my room so hard (by accident) that it was almost as though it had a stick of dynamite in it.  It EXPLODED.  I rubbed my dick in it and then laid down for sleep. Rita says I am acting crazy today.  I say that I am acting  well crazy. I don't know.  I am in an exceptionally good mood.  Is it because I have no obligations to fill this weekend? Probably.  I miss Paul too.  I haven't seen him in a month and I am about at the point of clawing my virgin face off.   Hum. Alright...I will do my best to stop in here this weekend. But if not...peayce jiggas.

      Well Helloooooooooooooooooooooooooo.... If I were any more nautious right now, I would probably request that my stomach be removed immediatly from my body and thrown into the Hudson River. Okay, that was the most ridiculous thing that I have said all day.  I am just going to let that go. Went to the West End with Ari today for lunch.  That was pretty enjoyable.  I got the BLT and then my ass had it about an hour later.  ouch. This morning, as I was walking to the subway station, I saw a car accident happen.  That is the most terrying thing ever.  If you have never seen one, let me tell you, it is something else.  The sound of the two vehicles smashing into eachother is deafening and creates a pit of tense worry in your stomach.  As I walked past, I did see that everyone seemed to be ok.  But the sound echoed in my head for at least a couple of hours.  The weirdest part of this whole thing is that yesterday at lunch I was thinking about how I have never seen a car accident.  Within 18 hours, I did in fact see one.  I don't know.  Maybe I'm just nautious.  Oh yeah, I am. Last night turned out to be the fucking best.  Rita and I got home and planned on hanging out with Kelly for a little bit before we retired to our rooms.  A couple of glasses of wine later and I was ready to stay up all night.  Kelly's ex-girlfriend, and a very close friend of both of us still, Angie hung out for most of the night and it was an absolute thrill.  She has the best laugh and is so fucking funny.  Every time she opens her mouth, I feel like her words go right to my gay funny bone.  Kelly and Angie had rented two movies to watch with eachother and then big mouth Joe was like: " Let's watch  urlLink Vulgar !"  As though it had anything to do with me.  I can be very intrusive when I want to be.  We all stayed up way past our usual bedtime.  11:30pm.  Hee.  I really need to start having a life. BTW...if you haven't seen the movie "Vulgar" and you aren't weak hearted, please go rent it immediatly.  There are aspects to this movie that will shock your face off.  Or maybe even your vulva. Yeah, it will knock your vulva right off! Today has been a pretty mediocre day for me overall.  Nothing too exciting, nothing too awful.  Just the sheer enjoyment of it being Thursday and tomorrow being FLYDAY. When I was younger, our local Radio Station "Fly 92" used to call Fridays, "Flyday".  Lame - O! Ari and I just blatantly lied to our boss about the lunch we had today.  See...sometimes Ari and I will be able to read eachother's mind and the minute that one of us starts creating a story, the other one knows immediatly to follow suit.  We are getting pretty good at this shit. Ah jeez...I gotta go do something for a student.   Sometimes I want to kill my job.  I want to take it by the throat and squeeze every ounce of life out of it. Then I would spit on it while it laid there dying on the floor. Then I would piss on it's dead face. Then I would close this entry while I am ahead.  Cuz why am I acting so scary right now? HAHAHA and LATAS!

      OK...WHAT???????? DID I REALLY JUST HAVE THE CONVERSATION THAT I JUST HAD?!?!?!?!?! Oh boy.  Here I go again.  Making friends with people whom I have never met in my entire life.  HAHAHAHAHA~! Like I don't have enough friends in real life.  I have to go and make a friend in Chicago.  As we know, I have recently been talking to this guy named Randy.  He visited my site and sent me a pretty incredible email.  I liked it so much that I wrote him back and he and I have been exchanging letters for about a week.  Today, he included his work number and I actually used it.  It was a very strange, but somehow invigorating thing to do.   I was very taken back by how deep his voice was.  I must admit, that the dirty and overly sexual side of me was like "mmmm".  Okay sick.  I have a boyfriend that I love.  But still...deep voices are a pretty big turn on in my world.  In any case, Randy was able to conversate very well.  I enjoyed hearing about his life and his Juan Carlos.  ;) We have simlair backgrounds and I know that when we have more time to talk, we will realize that we have even more in common.  As I have said in here before, it would be EXCEPTIONALLY great if I had a gay friend in my life.  I mean, a real one.  Not the pseudo gay friends that I seem to have now.  And by gay I mean: man gay.  Not women gay.  Although most of my lesbian friends are turning straight faster than I ever thought they would.  Hmmmm.... He is a cool kid.  And want to know the craziest thing? Kelly...he has the exact same birthday as you!  Sagittarius's unite!  Very fucking weird. So I don't know.  He told me that he and some of his friends at work talk about my journal and the saga that seems to be going on down here in NYC.  I mean, do I actually have a following?  That made me beam with pride and excitement.  Are they talking about me at the water cooler???????  ROCK! I will keep ya'll updated as to my Randall adventures.  Although do not call him Randall.  Call him MR. Randall.  He likes that better. sike. peace.  time to go pack up to go home.  It is 4:40pm afterall.

        I wrote this last night and waited to post it until today so that I could start off on the right note...  I wasnt sure what I wanted to write about.  I just knew I wanted to write. Then as I was taking my fifth beer piss of the evening, it hit me.   I want to write about Paul for a bit. This is what I want to say tonight: I love Paul.  I love him, love him, love him.  I dont know why I love him, I just do.  I always thought that the person I fell in love with would be some movie star celebrity or horribly successful, but devestatingly handsome philanthropist.   Instead I date the very nice looking, horribly work oriented, very often emotionally distant, bartender.  Sure he has his degree in Biology from BU and studied in Africa for 8 months.  Sure he has more money than I could ever dream of achieving at this point in my life.  Sure he is a very intellectual, unbelievably responsible personality.   But where is my hot passionate lover that is going to take full care of me while allowing me to be who I have always wanted to be? Where is the dream boyfriend I knew I would get? I am not sure that Paul is the one for me to end up with.  I have never thought that in the past and I have currently fought that idea more than I would ever bother to explain to anyone. In my mind, he is the person who teaches me about love in order for me to find my true love in the future. Wow.  That sucks. But it has always been true. Now that we are just about 3 years into our relationship,  I have definitly learned what love really is.  What it ends up being after the luster of the whole thing goes away. Love is counting on someone.  Love is knowing that no matter how bad things get around you, with whomever or whatever or whereever...this person will always take you in and protect you.  This person will allow you to show the ugliest side of your personality and then in turn respect you more for it.  In fact, they will love you more just for the fact that you allowed yourself to let it happen. The person you love will be all of these things while still looking at you in a way that no one else can.  They will tell you to Cut the Shit, in an email, faster than anyone else in your life.  They know you and dont accept anything but the truth. These qualities I have in Paul.   While I still sit here and think in my concious that Paul and I will ultimately just have a good run, I now sit here and think what if?  What if Paul is it for me?  What if he is meant to be my One and only.  I whole heartedly believe in the idea of one perfect person for everyone on this earth.  Is Paul mine? The problem that I face is this... In our entire relationship, Paul and I have only lived in the same city for 6 months.  We shared an apartment and it was beautiful and then ugly all before we could even realize it.  I vowed to never live with a boyfriend again.   However, we stayed together and we worked through it despite the problems we had in the past and the horribly impossible long distance relationship that was our future.   We did it. We overcame it and we are now at the point in which he is moving to the city to be with me.  No matter how you look at it and no matter how I try to fake it, the kid is moving to NYC to be with me.  His boyfriend that he is in love with. Since we have only known random weekends together, what will it be like when I see him just about every day?   Will this work? I am so excited to give it a try.  I love him deeply enough to allow this to happen in good faith but I would be stupid not to admit that a lot will change with him being here.   No more random hook ups.  No more instigating flirtation. Its time for us to give this a real shot. Shit.  This is going to be big. While Paul and I fight alot, we do have quite a few sincere moments.  I give him a bad rap in this journal as I do with him and a lot of friends in my real life.  I dont mean it the way it all sounds.   Yet it does show me that I am afraid of so many things in this relationship. It is a written example of how I cant commit to anything.  No matter how good it could prove to be in the end. I have yet to give myself over to Paul. If he has done it, why havent I? After this long, I cant believe that I would still have so much work left to do.   I love him enough to at least try.

      OKAY!  I digress! Rita showed me this ZFRANK website (I have linked it to my page) and now I HOPE he goes to my highschool. His site is AWESOME!  If you are bored, check it out. I wonder who he could possibly be!!  The internet hasn't been around that long, so maybe he was in my math class. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm....

      So if you clicked the above link that said: "Fun with your name" then you will need to also know this... Rita said that the guy that designed that stupid thing went to the same highschool that Kelly and I went to.  She said his name is  Z. Frank. I think she is crazy and full of craziness. And if Z. Frank DID go to my highschool...why isn't he doing something better then "Fun with your name"? Ah geez. I think Rita lies. Or is drunk from eating beer for lunch.

      So, as it turns out, having beer for lunch is a pretty great idea. This day has been filled with bad moods, bad attitudes, and big time screaming.  And that's just been the way I have been acting. Just think how annoying the rest of these devils have been! Rita writes me an email right before lunch and she says: "Let's go to the West End for beers as a treat for lunch." I think in my head: "Fuck yeah!"  Cept I have no money, so Rita has to pay for everything. We go to the W.E., we drink some beers, we laugh and we kid, and then we come back to our shit lives. Fortunatly, neither of us really got buzzed at all, but somehow my mood has turned to the better. Unfortunatly I have to spend an hour when I get home talking to acting guru lady Gigi.  That should be a good thing.  But I dread anything that's not eating, drinking, or smoking pot. OOH! Guess what? Want to know something pretty horrifying? FUCK! Just had the most IRRITATING Email exchanges with my wonderful MIA boyfriend Paul. God...so annoyed with him and our whole pretend relationship that I can't even get into it right now. DAMN him. Damn me for being so stupid for falling in love with him in the first place. Last night, I was watching tv before falling asleep and this commercial came on that blew my fucking mind.  I still don't really know how to feel about it. There were two kids sitting in the den of one of the kid's houses.  One kid was sitting at his father's desk, the other one was sitting directly across from him in a big chair.  The kid in the chair was ripping tubes from a bong.  (for non-pot smokers this means SUCKING EVERY POSSIBLE BIT OF SMOKE OUT OF A TUBE and then BLOWING IT EVERYWHERE IN THE ROOM) Both of the teenagers must have been no more than 14 or 15.  They were blitzed out of their mind and they were saying some stupid shit.  Next thing I know the kid behind the desk rifles through some papers on his dad's desk and pick's up a handgun. He says, while totally aiming it at the other kid: "I wonder if this is loaded?"  BAM!  (words across the screen) "Marijuana alters your reality" End of commercial. Um.... I was in my bed all alone and I go, out loud: "OMIGOD OMIGOD OMIGOD!" I couldn't believe what I saw.  It was a very powerful commercial, but I am left with the following confusion: I have been smoking pot just about every day for the last 4-5 years.  In fact, I was stoned when I saw this commercial. hee oops. Never in my entire life have I been so stoned that I thought that it would be okay to pick up a handgun and point it at somebody, regardless of whether or not it was loaded.  I don't ever remember my "reality" becoming so distorted that I thought things that were fatally dangerous became play toys. Never once. I have never known anyone that thought that. Yes, I agree that we should be deterring our children or future children from using drugs.  But do we lie in the process? Pot has never distorted my reality.  It has made me starving and in a better mood.  It has made me unmotivated to be productive in my life.  It even has gone so far as to make me hornier!  !!GASP!! But has it ever made me think that my best friend wouldn't die if I shot them in the head? Ah...no. I loved the commercial and I can't wait to see it again.  Just for the sheer impact of it. Would I stand by it as a valid deterrent from Marijuana? nah. Whatever. Back to Paul the asshole. I am not mad at him.  I am not upset.   I miss him incredibly.  I understand that he is moving here in less than two months.  But does that mean I should just sit back and not expect phone calls until then?  Should I expect that I am not going to hear from or see him for two months and that that is ok? No...it isn't okay. It's fucking garbage. You see... I am an asshole.  I am EXTREMELY high maintenance when I want to be.  I expect gold.  Never silver.   Man...he just sent me another nasty email. Doesn't he understand?  The more he's a prick to me, the less likely I am to EVER talk to him in person again. I have no problem hanging up in his asshole face.  If I have gone 5 days without talking to him at all, what's the big deal with going 5 more?   He's a shithead. Here is the conversation we just had over email:  Joe:  what is your schedule for work this weekend?  If you can get off sat. maybe I can come to see you.   Joe again:  Never mind.  Can't do it.   Paul:  That was a wierd message.  I received your every thought in one message!  wish I could see you.  this sucks not being able to see you, but soon we will be together all the time.  The search goes on!  You did not sound too happy to even hear your my voice this morning. I understand you just got into work, but geez. :(  Whatever.  Hope your day is going well.  Mine is busy.  Our event seminar series is in Denver today and Dallas tomorrow.  I am busy keeping it a float here at the headquarters, it is pretty neat.  You do not give a shit I am sure.  Becky flew in from Cali, will see her tonight. i will tell her you are doing well and that you said hello.  (BTW...Paul was totally right in saying that I don't give a shit about his "seminar series in Denver today and Dallas tomorrow"---cuz SNORE!  Talk about ANYTHING else for once!)    Joe:  it would just be nice to be able to have a relationship with the boy I am supossedly dating.  I have just about had it again with this long distance bullshit. I never get to talk to you, I never get to see you, we know nothing about what's going on in each of our lives. I was going to come this weekend to see you because I just missed you too much.  Since I haven't really heard from you, I decided against it.  I am not angry with you.  I am frustrated with this situation and I don't know what to do about it anymore.  If you weren't moving here on Dec. 1st, I don't know how much longer I could keep up with this whole thing.  When am I going to see you next? Probably never. (Now let's be honest...My email back was not THAT bad. --- Yet this is how he responded)  Paul:  Cut the bullshit!  You think I like not seeing you!!!  Don't make it any harder than it is joe.  You know what if I do not see you, guess what you will see me december 1st.  What part do you not understand???  Give it a break, don't get worked up.  Deal with life and sacrifices!  You make me so depressed when you have this tone all day.  You have not said or referenced one fucking positive thing since I called you at fucking 9am this morning!!!!  Think about it!!!  It does not help matters and I KNOW how you deal with things!!!!!  Joe:  You know what?  Try calling more than once a week. Try sending a letter once in awhile.  Try doing SOMETHING to let me know that you are still alive out there in Boston. You don't have the right to tell me how to feel when you make no effort to be a part of my life ever. You, Paul, don't need to be here every weekend to keep me happy. Maybe you should try taking time out for me via phone and letters.  Maybe when I call you, as I did last Friday night, and every night of my life, you spend some time talking to me instead of going out with your friends and forgetting all about me.  Expecting me to wait up until 3am to finish the conversation we started.   As I said, I am not angry with you. In fact, I care so little about this, that I cancelled the idea of coming to see you this weekend almost as soon as I had it.   I just don't care enough anymore to argue this. I have way too much to stress in my life without having to worry about how to deal with my MIA boyfriend. Yell at me all you want. That's fine. But don't bother trying to call to make it better. It would be changing the whole way you conduct yourself in a relationship.  Paul:  Fuck that!  you are real perfect.  Try working more than 35 hours a week and talk to me later.  Make your fucking mind up, do i say the right things or the wrong things.  Oh, I thought you always had to have plans in New York.  One night in and no plans, so call Paul.  I am leaving work now.  Joe:  Sounds good to me.  Bored with you and this conversation already.  ---end scene---  Pretty brutal words. But he will pay for them later.  Trust me.  Don't fuck with me or I will make sure you die. GRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! FUCK HIM MAN!  FUCK HIM! I hate this whole thing. I hate how much we fight.  I hate that we never get to make up. To be honest, I have hated this for the last 3 years and it never gets any easier.  It just gets more fucking irritating. I will NEVER do this again.  NEVER do long distance again for the rest of my annoying life!

      I'm not a morning person to begin with.  Never have been.  All of my friends know to avoid me for the first couple hours of the day, or else they get their neck snapped in two.  And without apology.  Rita and I, although we work ten feet from eachother all day, even take different subways on the commute to work because I can't be trusted to break one simple smile. Now, knowing this, also understand that I am one of the first people into the office.  Usually hovering some time between 9-9:15am.  Do you have any idea how fucking ANGRY it makes me when I check the morning voicemails to find that there are 6 messages from the lazy fat asses I work with telling me to make their fucking phone calls?  Or to photocopy stupid bullshit?  I would gladly do this for them, if it weren't for the two FULL TIME jobs I am doing in this place already.  I am so sick and tired of the utter LAZINESS represented by the assholes that I work with.  And if you ever mention to them that they are abusing you, they say either "But Joe, it's your job", or "Joe, how can we make it so that you can do all of your other tasks, while still being accountable for wiping my ass every time I shit?" My answer is this... I will shoot you in the face. If you think that it is OK to leave me a message at 8:30am telling me that I need to get the papers out of the printer and put them in your mailbox because you are too lazy to get them yourself the night before....then I tell you this: no. You will come in to work and you will get them yourself. If you leave me a 25 minute message telling me to make 3 phone calls...all of which are calls that involve your gas, electric, and credit card bill, then I tell you this: no. I will delete the message and look at you blankly when you ask how it all went. And if you give me a hard time about it???? When you hand me your PERSONAL mail to put in the box when I go to lunch, don't surprised if it never gets there. Cuz guess what? It's going immediatly in the sewer as soon as I leave this place. And don't think I won't laugh all the way home. I fucking HATE these people. FUCKING HATE.

      I spoke with my acting guru/friend Gigi today.  She was all upbeat and sweet and we made a phone consultation appointment for tomorrow evening.  She is going to help me get my resume looking as it should and she will hopefully guide me into a very productive direction.  Please let this work.  Please let this work.  Please let this work. I  really  need her help. I ate two hot dogs for lunch today.  Rita had one.  They were pretty good.   Have I mentioned that this is the 7th hotdog that I have had in the last 5 days? Sick, right? I moved the ring that was on my left hand, ring finger, to my right hand, ring finger today.  Do you know how weird that feels when you do that?  It's been there all day and I can't get past it.  It feels awkward and strange.  I should never have put it on the other hand to begin with.  >:-0---grrrrrrrr........ wobbly ring  wobbly ring Member how I mentioned earlier today that when I have Vitamin Water, it runs right through me? Well, I have gone 3 times since I first drank it and DAYIM I gots to go again! I'm a lesbo. wrote that purely cuz it was the first thing to pop into my mind. that's strange. yet erotic. Ok...time to make that to-do list already!!!!!!!!!!

      Another week.   God, can't I just die already?  It would be so much easier than coming into work on a Monday. So tired today.  This weekend kicked my ass.  Had an incredibly wonderful time with my parents.  Sharing the day with them, laughing our asses off Saturday night while drinking and playing cards, having some private and serious talks...all of it was perfect.  I hugged my mom so long before she went to bed at the end of the night.  I didn't want to let go.  Ever. :( Our bathroom is a pretty fun place.  We have signs all over the room.  For example, we have a quote of the day, a word of the day, an "IMPORTANT READING MATERIAL" section and most fun of all...a "Drawing Board".  The drawing board is a blank piece of paper that encourages graffiti of any nature.  It ends up being pretty damn funny.  My parents almost spent their entire visit in the bathroom drawing pictures and making jokes.  I about shit myself every time I went in there. It was so great.  I had drawn a full mural for them before they got there.  On Sunday morning, as they were leaving, I looked to see them tearing down the picture and shoving it into my mom's purse.  They wanted to bring it home and mail it to my brother.  How adorable.  I miss them alot already.  Probably won't see them again until Thanksgiving.  Maybe the first weekend of November, but it is unlikely.   Last night I made dinner for the housemates.  I made chicken with a special dijon sauce.  On the side I made broccoli with cheddar melted on top and also brownies.  Rita made her famous cheese biscuits and we all sat down together and shoved our vaginas full of food!  It was great.  And man did I eat myself to death. Who's turn is it next week!?!?! Kelly will be in Albany, so probably my turn again. I love Vitamin Water.  LOVE it.  Today I bought one that is 32oz.  Am I serious???  For some reason, when I drink a bottle of this stuff, it makes me have to piss as though I haven't gone in days.  Hm. So lately I have been a little angry at God.  I know it sounds weird.  Especially if you are someone that doesn't believe in God.  Cuz then it's like: "What to get angry at?" But I am an individual that lives my life under the direction and guidance of Jesus and God.  I have very strong convictions and am way past the point of arguing their existence or power in the world.  Save that talk for someone who wasn't raised in a baptist church. In any case, I very rarely ask God for anything.  I mean, of course I ask for everyone in my life to be safe and blah blah...but I never ask for anything that is based on petty wants.  When I do ask for something big, it is usually because I need it.  Seriously need it.  In my life, I can think of 2 other times when I said to God that I needed something and now! One was when I asked for a boy to come into my life that I could love and that would love me back.  It's a long story and my reasoning's why I asked for this are very good, but not your business just yet!  :) The second thing I asked for was to make a decision about whether or not I should change majors to theater or finish up the last 6 credits I had left in becoming a teacher.  Due to the timing of this request, when I got my answer it was big(!) and changed my life very dramatically. It has been years since I have asked God to help me with a problem that was of the same caliber as the problem I have been dealing with for the last couple of months.   What do I do to find my answer?   I am trying to be patient.  I am trying not to get discouraged of angry.  But it hurts you know? What I need now from God is some clarity.  I don't need him to (overnight) make my life perfect.  I just want a direction, a pathway, a sign as to what I am supposed to do.   (big sigh) It's rather upsetting to me.  Waiting for an answer and not getting anything close.  Damn. I will continue to pray.  I will continue to allow my life to change.  I will continue to work on the aspects of myself that need to be worked on.  But at what point do I realize what I need to do differently? I love God with everything in my heart.  I trust him, I defend him, I stand my ground on my belief in him.  What am I not doing? It's puzzling.  It really is.   So I am not really "angry" at God.  I am just confused and a little hurt.  Doesn't he want me to do what's right for both of us?  And if so, why won't he help me along in figuring this out?  Should I fast until I have an idea as to what I am really looking for? In other news... I love the change in the weather.  It's about time!  The cooler fall air.  Now that's where it is at! I really can't wait until its sweaters and jackets.   Got a lot to do this week. Think I am going to go make a to-do list right now.  If I don't, there is no way I will get everything done that I need to do. barp.

       THE BEER IS BAD.  NOBODY DRINK THE BEER!  that was for you Reets. What up dawgs?  what up in the underground?   In this case, the underground being this crowd of blogging peoples we got chillin HERRE. What the fuck is wrong with me tonight? You would think that after scrubbing the toilet, scraping goo off the inside of the fridge, completely excavating the buildup that has accumulated inside of our microwave, I would be covered in gunk and ready to die. And you would be half right.   Hells if I showered after I cleaned this piece. Who got time fo dat? I got beer to drink. Good beer.  Rita likes beer.  You see, if Rita were drinking obsessive amounts of beer, as I have been lately, I would sit her down and have this conversation: Rita: I drink alot of beer. Joe:  Stop hiccuping. Rita:  Beers just really good. Joe:  You should stop drinking so much beer. Rita: Why Joe.  Why? Joe:  You could get......addicted. RAWFULRAWFULRAWFULRAWF anyways... My parents are coming in the morning.  They will be here at 10am.  Ugh.  but yes...10am. I will then show them my newly redesigned bedroom, explain that I am still smoking cigarettes on the basis of pretend, and hug and adore them as much as physically possible in the first 10 minutes. My parents... I love em. Big time.  I grew up in a very strict, but incredibly fun household.  I mean, we all got our past... But overall, I was pretty alright as a child.  Since college, my parents have completely opened up to me and have, in the process, become very good friends of mine as well. We will go to the planetarium tomorrow because my dad has always been obsessed with space.  He took me to every Star Trek movie, made me sit through hours of DEEP SPACE NINE, and even confided to me one day after an episode of The Next Generation that Jean Luc-Picard is the best Kirk that was ever born. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA.  He is so adorable!   After the planetarium, we will grab a bite to eat and then I will take them to where I work to show them where I sit every day and waste away my existence as a non-working actor. It will be fun. And it was my idea. But i am so excited!  HAHAHA.  I get to show them where I spend every annoying day of my life!  Now my mom will understand exactly where I sit when I call her and tell her that I just saw somebody pick their nose and eat it.  BOO WAH! Sometimes I tell her better things than that. After we go to my workplace, we will come back to Queens and spend the night getting blasted with my two housemates, Miss Kelly and Miss Rita.  We will play cards, laugh, embarrass eachother and my dad will probably tell both of the girls to kiss him on the lips and I will vomit on my self and tell my mom that its time for bed. you know, the usual family get together. My mom will give me the look around 8pm that tells me to pack up my bowl cuz my mama want to smoke some pot! cuz what? cuz right. My mom smokes pot with me when we get together.  She is a fucking cool smoker too.  In the beginning she would go crazy in her head and go running around the house vacuuming for 2 hours.  But now she is relaxed and even gets bored with it by the end of the night.   My mom is very beautiful and concious about her weight, but you give her a toke off a bong and she will eat every mnm, potato chip, slab of beef in the place.  Its pretty great. The day will be wonderful.  It always is.  They love me unconditionally and actually get very excited to spend a day with me.   Since my brother is in Germany due to the ARMY, I am all they have.  Its a big responsibility and if it had fallen into my lap two years ago, I would have sunk. Big time. But I was ready to be close to my family.  I had come out of the closet to them with very concerned and confused reactions, but they learned to respect me for me.  To let me do what I know is best for me.   I love em! Welcome to my parents! In other news... I never know how to segue, so its always... In other news... So guess what happenend to me today? DUCK! POOP STORY COMING INTO PLAY! You have to understand...the only reason I talk about poop and pee so much is because just about every time someone goes to the toilet in my house, something huge and funny happens and we laugh and laugh. Then I run to the journal and not knowing what else to write, fall back on the only thing that connected deep with me all evening. Poopie stories. LOL and OMIGOD LOL. Poopie? did I really say,........................................................poopie? AHHH...HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA i am a gaylord. So here is my poopie story of the day: I was watching Trading Spaces with Rita today and we were eating two slices of pizza.  I couldnt finish mine and ate the rest in installments throughout the episode.  Rita swallowed hers whole and said the following:  Joe...there are few times in my life that I enjoy as much as when I eat my pizza. (OMIGOD OH MAN I AM SHITTING MYSELF WITH LAUGHTER!) she is fucking funny. cuz she meant it. So I rest my eyes during most of the episode and I miss the whole boring middle part. I open for the last ten minutes and end up on the couch next to Rita.  They are about to show the two couples their new rooms when suddenly I get the most spastic cramp of DIA REAR in my life.  I clutch my intestines and go to Rita: OH NO!  I WANT TO SEE THEIR REACTIONS!  WHY WONT THEY JUST SHOW THE REACTIONS!?!?!?!? Rita says: Joe, they are boring people, member?  It will be a boring scene for all, go to the toilet. And quick. Joe (writhing on the couch taking fast and incredibly sharp breaths) But RITA NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!  ITS THE ONLY REASON TO WATCH THE SHOW!  I HAVE TO SEE THEIR FACES!and ouch. this really hurts.  wait Rita, youre not remembering that this really hurts. I continue to writhe and beg God for fogiveness for treating my body in such a manner, when they FINALLY show the peoples reactions. It was so fucking BORING that I wanted to hold the shit in, get in Ritas car, drive to Wisconsin and dump it right on their new living room coffee tables. How dare they be boring after what I went through?   Hmph. That shit was well earned my friend. well earned. Over the weekend I will do my best to come up with things that are funny besides poop and pee.  I dont know why I wont let it go.  I dont talk about only that in my real life.   At least, I dont think I do. I will see tomorrow.  If I find myself always going back to peoples, you know, peoples pthhhhhhh and pisssssssssssssssssssss then I will realize that I have a problem and will seek medication.  fuck counseling. that would solve the problem. latas!

      As I write this I am listening to Nelly Furtado.  I am drinking a Corona Light and I just finished smoking my pretend cigarette.  If you tell everyone and yourself that the cigarette in your mouth is just pretend, then it is.  It goes completely undected by those that dont understand about pretend.  If those people that dont understand try to tell you that you are still smoking a cigarette, I find it best to laugh as though you are uncomfortable with the way they are talking to you and slap them swiftly and directly across the face. They wont bring it up again. HOLLA! Today turned out to be not such a bad day afterall.   I received some absolutely beautiful emails today.  Emails that should never have been given to me after my unbelievably immature attitude all week.  This whole blogger shit just started something in me so completly scary and unnatural.  I got back and read what I wrote and I shudder at how crazy I allowed myself to get about it.  I remember the emotion I was feeing every time I flipped over to Jamess site and saw the incredibly hurtful things he was writing.  Especially since he was uninvolved in the whole thing to beging with.  I dont know.   I want to erase what I said.  I wanted to delete it so that I wouldnt have to be reminded how ugly I can be when confronted with an ugly world.  I try to be someone much more above that.  Someone who really can turn the other cheek and act responsibly and organized about things. Barf.  I feel better now.  I feel like the new template gave me a fresh start on this thing.  So even though I wont  see every day how offensive the comment sections got on all of our sites, I will remember it and use it to prevent it from happening within myself or other journals again.   This girl Phoebe and this guy Randy sent me beautiful emails today.  Just when I had thought that I pushed my site too far in the wrong direction, here were people commenting on things that kind of healed the damage that was caused this week.   Randy commented on how well written he thought this blog was.  That meant the world to me.  I know my voice on here isnt LEXICON city.   That doesnt mean I cant write like that.  That means I have chosen this blogger to represent me.  Or at least part of me.  My voice.  My real voice. I think you understand.  So when Randy wrote that, he began to heal the damage caused by people telling me that I was a teenager in humor and grammatical skills. I vaguely remember something to the effect of http://www.joewritespoorly.com Now while using web addresses to make jokes about people is so 4 months ago, it stabbed me in my gut. People that tell me this site is humorous, get me.  I am not saying that my humor is the humor to have... I am saying that people who understand the way I write this, do think its funny, cuz it is honest and it is me.  It is raw and it is real.  I may write in vulgarities, but who doesnt think mental vulgarities all day? Okay, so maybe you dont. haha But you do. I will pray that you do tonight. ANYWAY....BLAH BLAH BLAHBLAHBLAHHAVENTBLAHMASTURBATEDBLAHINTWODAYSBLAH so Im horny. Thats it.  Phoebe...thanks.  Really.  You will be in NYC soon.  Weird.  Are we friends?? cuz I think we are.  Magine i am like...Hey Phoebe...want to meet for drinks after work? and Phoebe says: Well sure Joe...see your round 5:30pm, YEAH...MAGINE! With Randy...he wrote to me in an email today this introduction to his letter: Aack.  Another e-mail from me.  Dont mean to inundate you of course.  But its incredibe to talk to you for some reason.  You must be my twin.  oh my God, you are my twin.  shut the fuck UP! Now, after reading that, besides immediatly dying laughing (cuz I get this kids writing voice---wink wink), I think to myself...Rita just said that an hour ago.   You see...I had showed Rita the email he first wrote to me.   Something struck a very weird chord in me.  It was just great.  It felt like the kid really knew me.   I have talked to other people (Fish and Chevy discluded) online and even met someone off of here, yet I NEVER felt that with anyone before.  It was an invigorating moment.  It was raw. So I look forward to keeping up with this Randy character, cuz it is possible that he and I will be friends.  I dont have one single gay guy friend.   And then there was Randy. Rita has the hiccups.   A pretty fiece case of them. We were hanging out and laughing and talking and trying to enjoy ourselves, but she was quoted at saying the following: Hiccups ruin everything!  She couldnt relax and laugh along.  She couldnt talk back and forth.  She couldnt experience what the absolute fun and excitement of being around me truly is.  You see...she wasnt having the time of her life soley because she had the hiccups. Hiccups ruin everything. It was pretty devastating. And boom. One quick funny story before I sign off: Everyone in my house (Rita, Kelly and myself) has a problem with replacing the roll of toilet paper when it runs out.  I am usually flawless at it, cuz you see...I have respect.  Respect for the next person stuck with shit on their ass and unable to scoot out to the kitchen pantry to get a new roll.  Today, for example, I came home to find a (pause to laugh as I write this, cuz it was pretty funny) very tiny piece of PAPER TOWEL on the toilet paper roll.  (Which means that this person scooted into the kitchen, pee dripping down their leg, to get paper towel.  I KNOW never stopping to grab and replace the roll.  I KNOW this, cuz she didn't replace it after the whole ordeal)(Sike Kelly...I just told the story to be funny...you didnt know that there was toilet paper under the sink.  That was the saving grace for my next battle with shit ass) (u understand) Now, yes, I did find this piece of paper towel AFTER I had already shit.  I definitly should have learned my lesson by now, but I never do. I used that paper towel for all it was worth and left, NOT replacing it due to the point I was making. Rita fell victim to the no toilet paper dilemma only hours later. But the story I am trying to tell is this: A couple weeks ago in a bathroom very close to my bedroom... I had just finished taking a shit and put my magazine down.  I think I was probably reading something about pizza and french fries, cuz I really love them...mmmm...pizza....mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm......french....when I see that there is no toilet paper.  Of course! I look under the sink and no toilet paper.  I close my eyes and play the pretend game in hopes that it will be there when I open my lids.   No such luck. So I decide to reach into the garbage can and pull out different wads of tissue and use it to wipe my ass.  There are some pretty big clumps in the wastebasket and of PLEASE(!) I didnt pick any that looked as though they might contain booger babies.   I used one wad and it all seemed cool. Yet, when I used the second wad, as I was rubbing it up my crack, I realized that there was something oddly shaped inside of it and it poked me pretty hard. Yeah...right??? Well, I mean.....NATURALLY!  One of the girls had wadded up their tampon and wrapped it in toilet paper!   ROCK! My luck being what it is, picked up that specific wad and shoved it against my ass.   UUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM! I know the story is vile, but it is true. And as I have been recently told, I have toilet humor.   which by the way is damn funny and will always be funny and if done right can save the world. Think about that story for awhile.   I just wish we would all remember to change the roll of toilet paper when we finish with it. This story is okay to tell.  You know why?  Cuz no one will ever know who's monthly expulsion caused my horrifying demise. If the other girl in my house ever reveals the truth about this story, I have a story about them with a tampon and my house in Albany that would make them feel exactly the same. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA(boof) what am I?  Big mouth asshole tonight? :-D we better never hope this journal goes mainstream. The end.

      Just had an absolutely PERFECT conversation with Kelly about the whole move.  She is going to read what I wrote earlier and chalk it up to "Joe is a crazy, overly sensitive psycho".  And she's right.  I freak out about Kelly wanting to leave me in the city.  In my mind, she had already signed a new lease on her own and I was to spend the rest of my day finding a half normal subletter.  I don't know how the girls that I live with can possiby deal with my extreme psychosis.   Kelly just explained how she would NEVER leave us behind, that she was just setting a date for us to move, since we usually sit around and TALK about moving, but never actually move.  :) She made a lot of sense.  We were both very honest in our talk and I stopped at one point and just marveled at how far she and I have come in the last couple of months.  We are both so emotionally invested in everything that when one of us doesn't see eye to eye about something, we get very frustrated and take everything very personally.  Hence the journal entry previous to this one. You all must understand that I love Kelly very deeply and sometimes it is hard for me to imagine her moving on without me.   :( In other news, I got an email today from a fella named Randy.  He said that he just happened to stop by my site a couple days ago and absolutely loved it.  He said that not only was it incredibly funny, but also insightful and meaningful as well.  Now, understand that after all the bullshit that has gone down this week with my journal, getting an email like this really squelches alot of the frustration that I have been carrying.  Randy...you sound like a wonderful guy.  Please email me again and it would mean the world to me if you would visit my site more often.  There aren't nearly enough genuinely nice people in the world. Usually just pretentiuos pseudo-writers that seem to think that keeping a BLOGGER is as intelligent and powerful as becoming president.  How bout just be honest and write from your heart?  Anyone think of giving that a try? Wow.  For the first time in days I feel a bit better.  I get moments of better and then suddenly an asshole walks into my life and fucks the whole thing up.   Please pray for me.  If you are a prayer type person...please say one for Joe Cut the Shit.  Pray for me to have patience and for things to kind of turn around.  Pray that a little happiness might make its way to my life. Ok...enough serious talk. I promise to be back with more poop and tampon stories soon.   I know you are all dying for them.  Especially my new friend Randy!

      Damnit and shit. This has been the worst week I have had in a very long time.  It started with me having to deal with internet dorks trying to give me a hard time online.  They made me question things about this site that I have never questioned before and they have pissed me off in a way that I will not forget for a very long time.  I just have to keep reminding myself that these people are sad and their lives unsatisfying.  Otherwise, they wouldn't be constantly trying to bring me down.  I am assuming that these aforementioned people are either mentally stunted or that they are 20 year old children looking to fill up their days with online hijinks. Get over it already. Had the meeting with Kelly and Rita last night about moving into Manahattan.  It was a pretty honest and open meeting and while everyone explained their side to eachother, I feel that some things have not been fully understood.  Rita and I are in the same financial position.  We can't afford what Kelly can afford.  It's fine for now, but I know it will prove to be a problem come December 1st when Kelly will sit down with Rita and I and inform us that she will be finding us a subletter for her room and moving out.  Kelly wants out of Queens now and while I have wanted this from the minute she found us this apartment, I have to be logical and responsible and not throw away all that I have built for just so that I can have a Manhattan zip code.  I want to leave Queens more than life itself, but I realize that this may turn out to not be a possibility.  Kelly is a pretty spontanieous personality and when she has her heart set on something she has to have it. She just called and told us that she found an amazing apartment and although it falls into our price range, the realtor she went through would charge us $2700.  Kelly could pay her share of the $900.  Rita and I can only pay $100.  As was said last night, it will be impossible for us to use a realtor to find an apartment and that sucks.  We really do need one.  I guess what bothers me the most out of this situation is that I have a very strong feeling that what will ultimatly happen is that Kelly will move out on her own.  Rita and I are unflexible in our financial restraints.  Not because we are frugal or stingy, but because we just don't have the kind of money that she has. It truly blows.   I never thought that Kelly would move out due to these circumstances.  I thought that our lives would change direction or we would have a huge fight or someone would get pregnant.  I didn't reckon with the fact that one of us would just take off on our own.  I guess that is what growing up is all about.  While the three of us are have very strong and intense friendships, we all have to still remember that we are in NYC for our own personal reasons.     It's not the end of the world.  In fact, it really is okay.  As much as I have always wanted to move out of Queens, I am just happy that I have gotten to the place where I can afford to even live in this area.  I am paying my bills every month, have obtained a steady job, have gotten alot of my personal life in order, etc.  If having to suck up staying in Queens for a couple extra months is the worst thing that I am facing, than that is just about ok. In other news, Kelly has a new template.  I changed mine yesterday and she totally copied me.  If you go to her site, you will see the same exact color scheme in front of your face.  Kelly you are a copier!  :-D LOLOlololOLollollololwearebestladies I made a joke last night about how Kelly got a part in this local Hyundai commercial and my big accomplishment of the day was changing my template on blogger.  When I went to bed, Kelly changed her template so that my one accomplishment, which was lame to begin with, became even more lame.  THANKS FRIEND!   SIKE! sorta sike. No hard feelings.  ;) Paul called this morning and was incredibly understanding and supportive of me.  I was supposed to talk to him last night for awhile, since it was his one night off from work, but he never called me back.  I went to bed miserable and woke up even more miserable.  When I got to work this morning I was so overwhelmed by the utter incompetence of the people I work with that I completly lost my temper.  I was calling people "assholes" and "cunts" and ranting on about how "nobody gives a shit about this place but me!" It was all very dramatic and in actuality didn't make me feel much better.  I gotta hand it to Ari and Rita for being so patient with me and allowing me to blow my top the way I did.  I just feel like people keep placing things on my poor gay back and all I can do is take deep breaths so that I don't fully drown.  Like I said, it has been such a bad week.  I have been acting like someone I don't know.  I have spent a good portion of my days hating myself.   I am usually so much stronger than that.   I need a good weekend.  I need not to have my brother call me and tell me that he is going to war.  I need my boyfriend to be living in this city.  I need to be acting.  I need to feel confident and tough again.  Someone who didn't know me would look at me and think "what the hell does HE have to complain about".  I, seemingly, have all I need: a great family, a ton of great friends, a beautiful apartment, a steady job, a talent for my chosen passion, a wonderful boyfriend, and let's be honest...good looks.  So why do I feel like I have nothing?  Why do I feel as though I am struggling to keep my act together?  Why, every time the fucking elevator opens, I want to brutally murder anyone who walks through it?   Please God help me to help myself.  I need some direction.  I just need to know that it will all work out.   I have been praying and praying and praying, begging God to just give me SOMETHING that will give me my start.  SOMETHING that will open up my eyes to the right path I should be traveling down.  And all I have gotten back so far is some asshole signing his name as "christ" on my site and spouting off ignorant and poorly written garbage.  (That's okay, cuz I talked to God last night about this shithead and God did promise me to immediately send this fuck to hell for all eternity.) yay. Kelly is on the phone...be right back.

      Time to go home!   This day has been pretty amazing.  It has gone by so fast. Have been in such a great mood.  Why, some days, do I struggle to even break a smile and some days I can't keep one off my face? West Wing is on tonight.  I always say to Ari that I am going to jump on the bandwagon with this show, but I can never seem to commit to it.  Tonight I will give it another try.  If not, I am sure I can find a Trading Spaces episode somewhere.  As though Frank and the crew haven't completely stepped on my last nerve. Have you noticed that when Frank creates a design for a room, there is a huge ROOSTER somewhere in it? Mmmm...maybe rooster will be what Rita, Kelly and I will have for dinner. SLURP. Alright all, have a great night!  Thanks for the mostly drama free day.  Much needed and appreciated. ADIOS!

      Alright all...I have just been informed that somebody is posting shit on Durbin's site again. Please, if you are a reader on my site and are going over there to do it, stop. Feel more than free to bash him here.  He deserves that completely.  Hell, I will probably say what a douchebag he is at least once a day, cuz, well...he is! But I don't want anyone zipping over to his shit site in my defense.  I don't care to go there and I don't want to have to defend myself in the future.   Thanks everyone.   :) Have a happy Wednesday!

       WELCOME TO MY NEW SITE!  YAY!  I have picked a new template and cleaned up my act.  I hope ya'll like it.  I am pretty happy.  I got rid of the poll and the weather thing, but it was time for that shit to go anyway.   I mean, I am 25 years old now and I need to have a site that is going to be mature and respectable. (James Durbin is still a dirty bitch) See?  Mature and respectable. Mmmm...Rita just brought me pizza.  Time to go shove it into my face!!!!!!!!!

      What an absolutly beautiful day it is.  I came into work a bit late today.  Had some responsibilites at home.  I got here around 11:15am and it feels so great to have like half of a work day.  ROCK! The sun is shining, the birds are chirping, and the world just seems like a very happy place today.  Yesterday was an ugly day.  I spent a good majority of the day arguing online with fucking dorks.  I refuse to ever revisit Jim Durbin again.  I have sent messages to every person I know that blogs informing them of what a fucking waste of time this kid really is.  Even though part of me is still a little annoyed that he is living and breathing on this planet, most of me just feels bad for him.  He's sick and I feel that I may have made his mental state worse.  Ah well.  One bullet to his head will solve that problem. Snore. After yesterday's hullabaloo, I decided to take the comments off of my site.  While I love hearing from Chevy, Fish, Adam, and the others, I feel that having comments on my site detracts even more so from what I originally had in mind for this journal.  I don't want my site to be a forum.  I want it to be a place where I can come, write what I want, and leave.  Although the site isn't totally personal, it was more personal before I added the blog out section.  I write in here to keep in touch with my close friends.  On the rare occasion I even allow myself to fully let go and talk about things that actually mean something to me.  Once I had my confrontation with Durbin the bitch, I decided that I don't trust him or anyone else for that matter to come in and say something childish and ultimately unimportant.   So, sorry everyone.  Please still feel free to email me and I will definitely still be checking out your sites.  But Joe Cut the Shit needs to write for Joe Cut the Shit; without the worries of gaylords like James Durbin getting involved. BTW...Last night, while having a few beers with Rita, I came up with a new word.  You know how there are people on this planet that act totally gay, but for some reason are totally straight?  I mean, we have all met them.  The kinds of guys that definitely have more feminine qualities than masculine qualities...yet they still happen to be heterosexuals?? Weird that that happens, but it does. So I have decided to call these people gaylords.  So if I mention someone as a gaylord in the future, you will understand that they are a flaming homosexual in mannerisms, but not in sexuality preference. Kind of like James Durbin. HAHAHAHAHAHA.  I fucking love saying his name.  It makes me and my friends die laughing.  We sat around last night talking about his horrible website for hours.  I didn't realize how much his lame comments really bothered me at first, but once I realized that the kid really doesn't have much a following, that most people laugh behind his back and not to his face, I felt much better. I promise not to re-hash this over and over.  Just had to get the last bit out today.  If you are wondering what this shithead looks like, go to my link section and click on the link that says   urlLink James Durbin is a bitch  He is the ugly one on the left. :-D Don't fuck with Joe Cut the Shit, cuz I will send you to hell motha fucka!!!! ROFLROFLROFLROFLROFL! SLAM! What else... Kelly, Rita and I are having a house meeting tonight to discuss moving into Manhatten.  We are just about ready.  We are hoping that by years end, we will be comfortably resting in an apartment on the island.  It's quite exciting.  I think things will be much better for all of us if we are living in the actual city and not in a surrounding burrough. Wish us luck! Okay...I gotta take care of some annoying shit, but I will surely be back.

      So after fully housing a bagel this morning, Rita and I go to lunch to simply walk around the Upper West Side.  Yeah...walk right to Burger King I mean.  Do I ever stop?  My stomach is so full of trash right now.  I look like I have distended belly syndrome. Paul has been totally up my ass lately.  It's very strange.  Last week he basically begged me to go visit him in Boston, and while I would usually jump at the chance, I just felt as though I needed a weekend on my own in the city.  I ended up staying here and had a pretty great time on Saturday night.   This week, he is still finding a way to crawl inside of my ass and go right to my heart.  He can be incredibly sweet when he wants to be.  On more than one occasion today, I have stopped and thought about how adorable he really is.  Well, Rita explained to me how adorable she thought he was and then I had to totally agree with her.  I mean, whatever Rita says gos!  His internship has just been extended through October and while that is great for him (meaning he may get transferred to NYC if he gets hired full time), it also means that I will be seeing much less of him.  :( Haven't seen his face in about 2-3 weeks.  Usually that is about all I can handle.  This weekend my parents will be here, the weekend after, Rita's boyfriend will be here and the weekend after that... well, the weekend after that will make it 5 weeks apart. I can't stand this shit.  Just be patient Joe.  He is moving here in exactly two months.  Two months from today that is. If he actually moves here and he and I see eachother every day, I am going to bust with happiness.  I can't possibly imagine what it would be like to have a boyfriend that lives in the same exact city.  WOW.  The luxury of it all. K...guess that's it for now.  Should probably try to do some actual office work.   Oh and before I forget...the words of the day are: shit, douche, cunnilingus, feces, urine, period, and anything else that makes my humor base and not as pretentious as those I have recently encountered.

      THANK YOU TO MY FISH!   What a wonderful and sweet girl she is.  I met her the same night I met Doug and was absolutely blown away at how great she was!  Ari likes her alot and they talk quite a bit during the day.  Ari is constantly telling me stories as to how funny this girl is.   Fish, if you are reading this...come back to NYC soon!  Ari and I would love to take you out and spend more than 5 minutes in the same room as you. Tell me again WHY we separated and went different ways that night? Thanks for what you said on Jame's site.  It gave me the warm fuzzies.  Hopefully all of this madness burns itself out. How exhausting and utterly irritating.  (I will work on my complex sentence structure) And CHEVY!  You are the best always!  I hope you realize that.  Always looking out for your Joe Cut the Shit.  ;)

      I feel so lucky to have friends that jump to my aid when things get sticky.  If anyone gives me trouble, I can count on them to be there to take care of me.  There are good people in this world.  It is just hard to find them.  Once you have, hold tight.  They don't come around too often.

      I am so in the mood for a full Thanksgiving dinner today.  I am starving.  It's like I haven't eaten in years, yet I distinctly remember shoving my face last night at 11:30pm.   I am going to take a run to the local deli.  Maybe they will have a stuffed turkey sitting there, ready to be eaten for breakfast. If not, I guess a couple slices of pizza couldn't hurt.  I mean, it's a VERY healthy way to start the day.

      Rita ROCKS!  Have you seen what she wrote on ugly Doug's site?  If not, you can visit my blogger shout out and see cuz she posted it in both places.  I am so done with these two.  They have such boring, unfulfilling lives that all they can think to do is write incessantly on their site about how ANGRY they are.  LOL.  I mean...these two are so fucking pathetic that I don't even know what to say anymore.  I would LOVE to see this James Durbin character in person.  Not only would he get my fist in his mouth, I would have a great time laughing his sorry ass right out of NYC.  I love dorks that think they are cool.  It's pretty entertaining. From this point on, we don't mention these two douchebags.  They are losers.  Big time losers and we don't deal with them anymore.  I am upset with myself for even thinking any of this mattered in the first place.  If you would like to see how human beings with no dignity or class conduct themselves, please visit my blogger shout out from yesterday and see what they wrote.  Granted you will be appalled.  I don't know of anyone who has read it and hasn't been.  Luckily, I think I have pulled a few readers from their site and that does give me some sort of inconsequential victory.  Ah...these horrible men are dead.  DEAD!  BTW...I have never met two straight men that act more like homosexuals in my life.  Especially this James Durbin character.  He just can't stop bringing it up.  I feel bad for the poor guy.  JAMES---Just admit it and then maybe you won't be such a nightmare of a human being.  I will pray for you. Last night I met up with an old friend of mine named Joy.  She and I were best friends in highschool and then some shit came between us.  It has been about 3 or 4 years since we have been in touch.  I had the best time hanging out with her last night.  We laughed, we talked about old times.  I absolutely loved being with her.  I am hoping that we are going to be able to pick up where we left off.  We are different people now, but I think better people.   I got home around 9:30pm and hung out with Rita and Kelly for awhile.  Kelly was drunk as well and we smoked a cigarette!  Okay, I smoked like 5 yesterday.  Not doing so well with this quitting thing. Yipes.  My parents are coming this weekend for their bi-monthly "we come and play cards and drink with Joe's friends night".  It's pretty fucking fun.  Rita, Kelly and I will sit around with my parents and die laughing as we see them get wasted right before our eyes.  My parents are just about the two coolest people on the planet and I am very much looking forward to spending the day with them.  My mom has already asked me if I got "the pot" for this weekend.   God!  Could she BE more adorable? Could I BE more like Chandler just then? enough. So I find out last night that Road Rules is ending next week.  Uh...what???  I know alot of you don't watch it and I totally understand.  Not everyone is as much of a MTV reality TV junkie as myself.  But I must admit...I am pretty sad to see this group go.  I feel like I never really got the chance to know them.  I mean, they didn't even invite me out for a drink.  Thanks alot team.  After I went and had that wonderful dream about all of you.   Okay...Ari just pointed out the newest "entry" on my blogger shout out.  Wow.  I can't believe these two have taken this to that level.   It should hurt.  It definitely should sting a little.  But you know what?  It doesn't.   These two have no balls.  It's so mundane at this point. Ah well...time for a smoke.  :(

       HAPPY 23rd BIRTHDAY TO MY WONDERFUL BROTHER!   I just wish he was able to celebrate it today.  Poor kid is stuck out in the field doing ARMY maneuvers until 12/17/02.   I love you Winfield.  Can't stop playing the Justin Timberlake CD over and over!  I might need some serious therapy if I ever lose or damage this disc.  Seriously, I am falling madly in love.  Before it was just a deep yearning.  Now it's full blown obsession.  I'm comfortable with that. Had a great shift last night at the Gap.  They put me on register again and I shined shined shined!  At about 8pm, I took my 15 minute break and while I was standing there smoking my cigarette, Ari appears out of nowhere, walking her baby boy.   In this case, baby boy = a dog named Riley.   Don't get nervous ya'll; she don't got no human baby yet.   Phew.  I don't know if I am ready to be a father yet. We smoked a butt together and then she went back to her apartment.   At 9:15pm, I took my 45 minute break and scooted on over to her pad and we smoked a bong together and I was able to rest my weary legs.  It was the best 45 minutes of my whole day.  After I returned to work, stoned and happy, the night just FLEW by.  I may have to consider smoking pot during every shift.  Even if it means hiding out in the fitting rooms with my new bong.   I think they'd be cool with that. As I was walking back from Ari's apartment, I stepped within inches of a hypodermic needle.  Yes, NYC really does have needles lying on the ground.   SICK! and scary! and I also used it cuz I wanted to know what it felt like to share a needle with a stranger.   BTW, it felt kinda good. I got home around 1am and Kelly, Rita, Angie and I sang La Cucaracha while Angie smashed the shit out of her "Hello Kitty" Pinata.  Rita had stocked the thing FULL with amazing candy.  We all ate one piece together, talked a bit more, and then it was time for bed.  I think my head hit the pillow some time around 2:15am.   A very long day. I am off work tonight so I am THRILLED to go home, drink a few glasses of wine, sing for a bit, put away my laundry, and relax my worn and torn body.  What a great and QUIET evening it will be.  Actually, Kelly's parents are coming into town tonight instead of tomorrow due to this supposed "massive snowstorm we are going to get tonight".  I don't know how much I believe in it, but it would be pretty exciting to wake up to snow on the ground.  And right before Thanksgiving.  To me, that is a beautiful thing.  If there is more than 2 inches on the ground, I will be creating a snow man masterpiece outside my bedroom window.  Then I will pee on it so that it looks just like a true to form NY'er snowman.   Everyone walks around with pee on them here.  It's just how things are done. I guess Paul signed his lease yesterday.  He called me at work ONCE during the whole day, but I happened to be out at lunch.  Then he never called back.  He is switching his service on his cell phone, so it has been out of commission for the last couple of days.  Also, his home phone has no long distance because he and his roommate have cellies (as they call them) (trust me, my boyfriend really ISN'T flaming).  I have no idea if he is living or dead at this point.  Imagine he moved to Idaho or something and never told me?  This whole time I thought he was signing a lease in NYC, but in reality he was just playing me for a fool.   I hate foolery. So one more ridiculous thing before I go finish up my bullshit work related nonsense... Yesterday morning, when my alarm went off,  urlLink Z100  (my flavorite radio station) was talking about the  Sopranos  episode from the night before.  Now, I don't watch the  Sopranos , cuz I simply don't have the time, but they played a scene from Sunday night's episode.  In the scene, Tony is telling Dr. Malfey (Malfee? MalFe? stuart?) that he doesn't want to participate in anymore therapy sessions with her.  She tells him that he should just come back for one more session and he says "No, I'm done".  Then he proceeds to shoot her in the face.  She screams and hits the floor.  Dead.   You see...he kills her cuz she knows too much about him. I GASP and wonder why I haven't found the time to watch this show.  What a cool concept.  They proceeded to talk about the episode at great length and I immediatly found my conversation piece for the day.   As soon as Ari came into work, I asked her if she had seen the episode.  She said "no" and I pumped it up like nobody's bihness.  I told her that the episode was HUGE and that she should do all that she could to avoid any sort of recap on it during the day, so as not to spoil it for herself.  I talked about it ALL day. Then last night when I got home, I did the same thing with Kelly, who has as of late, been watching the show.  Both of them were curious and thrilled to see what the big deal was. This morning when my alarm went off, Z100 was fielding angry phone calls from listeners who were questioning why Z100 would pull such a horrible prank on their listeners. I find out that they made up the entire thing.  The scene I heard on the radio was exerpts from past episodes and it was put together so BRILLIANTLY that everyone bought right into it. I was DUPED by Z100 and that makes me embarrassed as well as totally overjoyed.  I don't fool easily and they got me! That makes two times in the last year that I have fallen for media pranks. Remember the  Real World Vancouver  bullshit from a couple months ago? Well, that one made me physically angry.   This stunt makes me smile and think to myself: "Why am I such a ridiculous monster?" Alrighty all!   Have a great night and think about this final thought: "If a comedianne boofs on a subway, does the humor of it all make the smell worth it?"      yikes. I need sleep.

      Yesterday afternoon I was able to come home from work and sleep for 2 hours before I had to go back.  The first hour was uneventful as I really was just tossing and turning, but during the second hour I had the most intense and REALISTIC dream!  I know ya'll love it when I write about my dreams, so here it is: I was rushing home on the subway so that I could go to sleep for a couple of hours before I had to go back to work at the Gap.  I was supposed to be there by 3pm.  (so far, this part of the dream was parralleling my real life)  I get off at my subway stop and my friends Hannah and Kelly pick me up and we decide to get ice cream at the local   urlLink Stewarts Shop .  We are all in great moods and the sun is beating down on our faces.  We drive for a bit, blaring music and laughing.  Finally we arrive at the "Stewarts" and I notice that it is 2pm.  "Hurry up everyone, I gotta get back to work by 3!", I emote. We go inside and start choosing our ice cream flavors.  Wouldn't you know it, a girl that I was VERY good friends with in highschool, "Dayana Krawchuk" appears out of nowhere and is like: "Joe?  Joe CuttheShit?  HOW ARE YOU?"  I am THRILLED to see her and we immediately hug.  She introduces me to the 35 friends she has brought with her.  Yes, that is correct.  She had like 35 people with her...all girls.  I meet them all and they act as though I am some sort of celebrity.  They hang on my every word and laugh at all my lame jokes.  At this point, Kelly is eating her ice cream in a corner booth all alone.  Hannah comes over and says hi to Dayana, but it seems as though Dayana is more concerned with me than her.  Hannah feels dejected and goes to sit with Kelly.  I get a tap on my shoulder and this girl, whom I have never met, hands me a black cherry ice cream cone, but instead of black cherries, there are huge chocolate chunks.  I love it and eat the whole thing in two seconds.  Then I announce that I am going to get a second cone, when Kelly calls out : "Joe, we have to go or else you are going to be late for work!"   She's right!  I quickly say goodbye to the 35 random girls that I have just met.  Dayana decides that she wants to drive me to work and I tell Hannah to just go home.   (Real nice of me, I know.  I don't have much class in my dreams.) Dayana's car is silver and looks like a porsche or something.  I am sitting in the front seat and Kelly is sitting in the back seat.  We are cruising along, when suddenly the car takes a sharp left turn up this grass covered rock garden and Dayana scrapes the entire lower half of her car on a rock bed.  It basically guts the car.  We sit there all shooken up at the accident we have just gotten into.  Suddenly I start to panic.  "I HAVE to get to work.  It's only my 3rd day!", I scream.  Dayana pushes a button on the dashboard and the car starts up again, cept when we start to move, it's no longer a porsche, it's a silver wind up car and it is impossible to control.  She smashes the car about every half mile.  Once we hit a tree, another time we hit a telephone poll.  Each crash made me increasingly more upset and I was literally clawing the skin off my face, cuz I KNEW I was going to get fired from my job.   Finally I tell Dayana that "I'm driving" and I move into the driver's seat.  I bust my feet through the bottom of the car and I run us all the way home.  (No seriously, I ran it home like a Flintstone car).  We round the corner and I pull into my parent's house in Albany.  My dad is busy working on a rose garden he has just planted.  We jump out and I say to my father "Look who I ran into??  Dayana!"   My dad says: "Joe, there are some people here to see you".  The 35 girls we left at Stewarts coming running out from behind my house and start cheering for me.   I take a few bows and ask Kelly what time it is. She says:  "8pm".   I say "WHAT!!!!????!?!?!?!?!  OMIGOD!  I am TOTALLY FIRED!" My dad says: "Calm down, we will figure this out.  What lie can we use?" I say: "There is no lie to be used!  I fucked up!  I totally fucked up." I reach into the bag I was carrying and pull out my cigarettes.  When I go to remove one from the pack, I notice a pill of ecstacy sitting in the cellophane wrapper.  I try to hide it, but my dad says: "What's that pill?"  My stomach clenches and I say: "Nothing!" He asks to see the pack.  I pull it back out of my bag and realize that it's not one pill in my bag, it's like 15 and they are all shoved into the wrapper all crazy like.  My dad takes the pack and tells me: "These pills are no good.  You should get the red ones."  The 35 random girls voice a resounding "Yes you should" and I realize that I am not in trouble with him at all.  In fact, he has given me excellent advice on which pills of ecstacy are better.  I start to smoke a cigarette while the 35 girls go running crazily through my yard. ------end scene------I wake up-------- The phone rings in my bedroom and my dad is calling to ask how the job at the Gap is going.  I wake up totally disoriented and tell him about the crazy dream I just had.   I swear, it felt so REAL as it was happening.  I was convinced that I was fired from the Gap and that there IS such a thing as a silver Flintstone car.   HOW RANDOM!  I knew I had to lay it down in this journal.  Dreams like this should never be forgotten. Fuck you Gap for making me crazy in my head.

      It feels  REALLY  good not to have a weekend at all.   SIKE!  It sucks!  I have spent the last 72 hours at the Gap.  Seriously.  I worked 24 hours this weekend.  I slept for like 11.  It was awful.  I still have the tired buzzing in my head.  Getting 3 hours of sleep a night is by far one of the worst things on the planet.   Yet, I pulled through.   I work AGAIN tonight and then I have tomorrow night off.  Thank God.  I was originally scheduled to work, but my my (music hits me so hard, makes me say "oh my lawd"...)  GM (General Manager) took me off the schedule because I had complained to her the day before.  My average work week at the Gap was supposed to be 35 hours.  UM!  That is more than I work at my FULL TIME day job!  Hopefully we got it worked out so that I am only working between 25-30 hours a week.  FUCK.  Are these people kidding me? But on the plus side, my co-workers and managers are nothing short of wonderful.  They are all nice to me and willing to help.  Of course there are the few that I think suck, but that's just cuz they think they are God's gift to "Gap".  But whatevs, cuz really...if they believe that then they've got their own massive issues.   We had this full staff holiday meeting yesterday at 7am (meaning I had to get up at fucking 5am after having worked until 12am the night before) and I was shocked at how great all of the people were.  During the meeting there were games and prizes and I walked away with some good shit.  I got a $25 gift card to use in the store, as well as a $10 Virgin Records gift certificate and ALSO $10 in McDonald's coupons.  AWESOME, right?  For doing nothing, but showing up and answering a few questions about Gap products.  Now, if the rest of the job could be so damn cool.   My legs and back are so sore!  I go through moments of complete and utter exhaustion and then I get my 3rd and 4th wind and I am okay.  More than anything, I want this job to be overwith.  Just 6 more weeks to go! Yay! :-0**** that's me vomiting. Paul comes into town today to sign the lease to his new apartment.  I mean, is he really going to be living here in 6 days?   ~AYIYI~ Angie spends tonight as her last night in NYC.  Her last night for 6 months or so. She left me with her Playstation 2 and her bong!  What more could a girl like me ask for? I haven't looked to see what games she left behind, but I did see that she has the   urlLink Britney Spear's Dance Game  I am so playing that as soon as I get the chance.  I want to get her moves down so Justin will do me good. Yes, I said "do me good". My fingernails are doing so poorly lately.  I have been chomping on them so vigorously that it makes me kinda nervous.  The bad part is that I just LOVE biting them.  They taste so good!  Like chocolate covered fingers. oh. that might be poop I'm tasting. To celebrate Angie's big trip to Mexico, Kelly is taking her out to dinner and then Rita will meet them for drinks.  When I get home around 1am, we will smash open a pinata and then we will probably do La Cucaracha and go to bed.   I said last week that I was probably not going to be able to go home for Thanksgiving and luckily that has changed.  I am leaving at 8:30am on Thursday and coming back at 9am on Friday.  Kind of a whirlwind trip, but it will be worth it.  I can't imagine not being able to be with my family on this holiday.  Or really any holiday for that matter.  The 'rents told me that they were throwing a New Year's Eve party again this year and while I would love to go, I will have to work at the Gap.  I told them that they should cancel the party and come spend New Year's with us down in the city.  I think they might actually do it.  Then YES Kelly, we will stop by to have drinks with you or to celebrate the 12am countdown with you or sumptin sumptin.  Why do I feel like I will be the one coordinating everyone's schedules?  That's ridiculous.  But probably the only way everything will run smoothly. And why am I stressing about New Year's today when Thanksgiving is literally in 3 days?  Cuz I am an anal monster that drives myself to the point of lunacy over minutia. That's the word of the day today:  Minutia (the smallest, most trivial of details) So I am just about the WORST folder to ever work at the Gap.  I have figured out a way to hide pieces of clothing in the store so that no one will ever know the better. I am the best at covering up my lack of skillz.   There is this guy that I work with named Eli. Member when I was having dreams about him for awhile and for some reason I was like in love with him? Well, nothing much has changed between he and I since that time, except now I hate him.  I don't have any idea why, either.  I mean, I hate lots of people.  I am totally intolerant of anyone and anything that gets under my skin.  While Eli is a very nice and pleasant person, I find myself wanting to grab him by his little neck so that I can ring the life out of him.  And the best part about it is that he does nothing purposely wrong.  NOTHING.  Yet, when I see him, I want to punch.   He's not an ugly guy, by any means, but I do believe that his face is slowly melting off.  I have said this to Rita on numerous occassions, and while she laughs each time I say it, she is always perplexed as to what I really mean when I say it.   This is what I mean:    urlLink Example of Eli's melting face  He just drives me crazy for no reason at all.  GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAWR! I probably shouldn't have worn the tightest shirt I own on a day when I have to work for 15 hours. Okay, Eli just walked up to my computer and I thought he saw the picture of his melting face.  I got nervous, but then I remembered "His face is so melty, his vision is probably blurry, so he can't read over people's shoulder's so well".  (snicker) Okay, Angela, the housekeeper in my building, just came up to me and told me that she was putting the fruit we got for a fruit salad "upstairs" so that I could "go cut it up when I get the chance".  Okay, is she kidding?  I think she is, but part of me thinks she's serious.  I ain't cuttin that shit!  FUCK!  What IS this place? Did I get hired to cut fucking fruit?  Prolly. So tired right now.   A wave of exhaustion has just clouded my eyes.  And I am starving AGAIN!  I have already had my daily roll with butter and vitamin water.  Now I am ready for a steak dinner. "did you say STEAK?"  ---- horrible reference to "Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo" There is a crazy man in my office right now. cuhRAZY man with a huge egg on his forehead.  Cuz HOW did he get that shit on his face?   Like I should talk...I get weird things on my face all the time. They just haven't been in the form of a Robin's egg yet. I wish I could take a nap now.   fuzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzy I gotta go put my head down on my desk for a minute. for a minutia I mean.

      So wow.   Everything is changing right before my eyes. I mean, I know that with this journal I am notorious for saying that things are changing and that I am due for some sort of comeback within my life.   But I feel like this time its for real. I know this sounds stupid, but I work at the Gap.  I mean, Joe Cuttheshit works at the Gap.   Joe Cuttheshit doesnt work at the Gap.  Joe Cuttheshit doesnt work a second job period. But here I am...trying my best to guide my life into a healthier direction.  A life filled with no booze, no slack time, and no life that isnt anything, but productive.   Tonight was my one night off.  I am sort of understanding how Kelly feels when she has to work every single night knowing that she can only see her roommates once a week or so... Weird, cuz before I didnt get that and now I kinda do.   Last night, when I found out that I wouldnt have to work this evening, I thought FUCKING YES!  I can get drunk with Rita and not feel guilty for doing it!  I can earn my night of drinking instead of relying on it. You see... I dont think that I am addicted ( you could get...addicted ) to alcohol; I think I am addicted to the feeling I get hanging out with my friends while having a few beers on the table.   Going into tonight, I knew that this was my night to drink.  I knew deep down that it couldnt be CRAZY and go all night because its a Thursday and there is  work  to do tomorrow, but at the same time, I looked forward to tonight as though it was my own personal weekend. I have to work at my day job tomorrow and at the Gap for just about all of Friday and Saturday.   I am used to having one night watching movies and one night going out on the town. Wow.  Everythings changing. I had the most amazing time with Rita tonight.  We discussed some very personal issues that are plaguing both of our otherwise perfect lives.  Lots of shit has been going on with the three housemates lately and none of it is journal business at this point.  Eventually I will spill the beans, but for now, the three of us are really finding ourselves in not only the city, but in our personal lives as well.   We are learning, very gradually, what our purpose is in this great big world.  I know  it sounds lame, but it is so tragically true.  I count on the fact that those who read my journal understand that this is a journal and that there is so much more going on behind the scenes.  Its focused on what I see in my every day life as well as how I feel feel expressing myself on that given day. So I have just inundated you with non-sequential bullshit, but I think that you understand my freeverse. tangent. whatever. I love my Rita.  In a way that would make a grown man cry.  A big hairy trucker grown man even. I dont wax philosophic nearly enough about her.   At this point in my life, I find myself as a cojoined twin. Siamese baby if you will. Rita and I work together, come home together, go out together, have the same friends, watch movies together, buy underwear together, and even call out the fact that we are at that moment taking our daily shit. Its a little bizarre and somewhat cartoonish at the same time. I am constantly writing in here about the levels that Kelly and I are conquering, yet Rita remains a complete mystery.  All that is ever said is that she is funny and likes BBQ and got me hooked on this journal.   But in all reality, she is ties it all together. Kelly and Rita serve very different purposes in my life. Kelly knows me in one way and Rita knows me in another. Both of them are one of 8 people that mean the world to me.  8 people that comprise my entire existence on this planet.  If all of them were to die in some freak ridiculous accident, I would be forced to kill my own person, because I would have no one. I dont think I need to explain who these people are, because that would make this even that much more staged and cliche, but I do need to say that yes Ari, I consider you one of these 8 people. ***DISCLAIMER---IF YOU ARE NOT ARI FEEL FREE TO SLIP THIS PART ENTIRELY*** You are my NYC life.  At least at this point.  I know you and I have thus begun to understand you.  You have taught me so much about myself that I couldnt begin to thank you.  You and I have that relationship where we hate and love eachother so intensely.  We dont fight, but when we do its scathing, no matter how it happens.  Yet, as personal as these moments get, I find myself talking about you and explaining who you are to people that dont even know you.  You are a huge part of my life and I am so glad tht I have gotten to the point (regardless of age and all of our other society based stipulations) where I truly know who you  are .  You amaze me.  I see through that hard exterior.  You know I do.  I happened to be talking about you with Rita tonight, as I often do...and I realized once again how integral the part you play in my life really is. So whatever snores.  Thank you.  You are one of the 8.   Please love it. ***DISCLAIMER OVER! DONT ACT LIKE AN ASSHOLE, I TOLD YOU IT WAS FOR ARI!*** All of my friends serve this incredibly important function in my life. I just wanted to highlight Rita tonight.   She started me on this journal.  I read hers before she even got here.  She allowed me to actually experience it. Cuz see, with Rita...it was never about the site meter.   It was about the love of writing. I have tried to put a guest book and comments on my page and while I think that that is totally appropriate for some journals, based on the writers purpose, I dont think it is right for mine. Rita taught me to write for me and as much as I dont think that I open up nearly enough in here, I have sessions of writing where I find myself pouring out my soul.   So Rita has been the influence of this particular journal. This girl just gets me.   She looks at me directly in the eye and before I can even conceptualize the thought of having a bad day, she says to me: Are you alright? And I fucking hate that! I always respond with Yes.  Are YOU alright? Then 20 minutes later I am down and out in my so called Beverly Hills life and I say "Fine, I suck today.". She just knows. She gives great advice, she has a great laugh, and she is the first person that I have spent 18 hours a day with, every day, and never bores me.   Tonight, for example, we came home knowing that we were having wine...despite the fact that she battled a headache and post -Billy Blanks Tai Bo - recovery all day.  Shes crazy.   She also ate an entire bag of Haribo Raspberries today and felt so physically nautious and full of guilt that every sentence began with Hi, I ate all of the raspberries in my special bag, um...sorry bout that....do you want me to fax that donor opportunity to the president of the board. Seriously, she made herself ill.  And I laughed all day. As quoted by Rita in an email around 11am this morning: Joe, I made a mistake.  I bought a bag of Haribo Raspberries and ate the entire thing just now.  Forgive me baby Jesus.  I just ate em and ate em and now I am sick.  So I laugh and think:  "You weigh 17 ounces and need to have this experience every morning before 11am.  Wait..."You ate that entire bag before 11am?" hahahha please I drink a bottle of pepsi on my way to my shower. BTW...Kelly has been swimming alot lately and has really huge biceps. No, I am not kidding. They are better than mine. Um...do I want Kelly cuz she is a bodybuilder? interesting... So yeah...I started this thing wanting to say how great Rita is and instead I go on and on about how shes ridiculous. hahahahaha oh. BTW...why am I hahahahaing all the time now.  Its not like I am sitting in my chair and literally hahahahahahaing?  As Rita says:  Stop writing to me in your fake ass emoticon faces. Okay, she never said it like that (cuz we are polite middle class citizens), but the point was taken. A couple months ago we created nicknames. Hers in Ladle and Mine is Boobie. I know its strange and doesnt make sense, but to us, when it is said...it does.  It really does. Everythings okay if its: Goodnight Boobie and in response Goodnight Ladle. Truthfully. I am totally satisfied and in some ways personally moved by how wonderful my weekend was. I had tonight and Rita made it the best. We got home at 6pm and sat in front of the television, without it even turned on, and talked for 4 straight hours. Then she had to go to bed. Just talked. My housemates are bomb.  They really are.  They are my best friends in the world and I defintiely couldnt have asked for a better people to share this time with.   While we all struggle and fall...these are the people that are going to pick you up and (sometimes literally) put you back on your feet. I am lucky. Gosh, after all this, how can I ever write about my life being shit?

      HELLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! What a couple of days!  I mean, DAYIM! I am officially an employee at the Gap.  I had my orientation on Tuesday night and last night I worked my first shift.  I was most nervous that my co-workers were going to be assholes and unwilling to help me in learning the ropes.   When I first moved to NYC, I transferred from a Boston TGIFriday's to a Manhattan TGIFriday's and the experience was nothing short of hell; mostly because the people treated me like stank garbage. But the people at the Gap were wonderful to me.  They were friendly and helpful and I even got asked out on a date! This girl Dolores (btw she is 19 years old) asked her friend Pillar if she would ask me if I had a girlfriend and/or to a movie.  I was very flattered, but soon realized that nobody had any idea that I am gay and that I was going to have to make a decision as to how I am going to play this all out.  I mean, I don't give a shit if they know I am gay, but now I have given them the impression that I am straight and blah blah lame-o blah.   In conclusion, I said I was in a "relationship", but it was in no way as ambiguous as it sounds.  They all think I am straight. Plus!  Where are the rest of the gay people that work at the Gap?  Isn't that what the Gap is known for?  Or is it Banana Republic that is known for gays?   I work with mostly Latinas, but some black guys/girls too.  They all treated me with nothing but respect and at no point did I feel uncomfortable or out of the loop.  I was quite relieved. However, the job is fucking hard!  I mean, standing on your feet for the entire shift, on top of folding clothes over and over and over and over and over and over and, yeah you get the point. I didn't even know how to fold when I walked in the door last night.  Now I get the jist of it, but it's still not one of my strongest of suits.   Folding pants is easy, but the turtlenecks?  That shit be hard!  Every pile of clothes I made looked like someone had shit them out of their ass.   Whatever, I'll learn. I do get a discount of 50% off on all their clothing!  FUCKING AWESOME!  But the discount is limited to a certain number of items a month and at no time am I allowed to give it to anyone else.  I must use my own debit card when making the purchase and if I am caught buying female clothes with my discount, I get fired on the spot.  They call it "Discount Delinquency" or "Discount Fraud" or something equally as cheesy. I am off tonight, which is awesome because I SERIOUSLY need a glass of wine and at least 7 beers.   Probably the worst part of the job is the schedule. Here is what I have to deal with this weekend: Friday:  6-11pm Saturday:  7-9am (Cash Register Training) then again from 6-11pm. Sunday:  7-9am (All staff Holiday meeting)  At 7 fucking am????  What the jizz is that???? So essentially I will be getting up earlier this weekend then I do normally for my full time job.  Ah geez. It's all good.  I promised myself that if at any point I can't handle it anymore or I just despise it with my every being, I will just quit.  I am going to do my best to stick it out for as long as I can.  But if I don't think that I have an "out" with this thing, it will destroy me and fast. So that's that!   WELCOME TO THE GAP! Everything else in my life is pretty snores for right now.  Paul will be moving to NYC in 10 days.  OH YAYAYAYAYAYAY! I can't believe it.  The good thing about the Gap is that it is three stops from Paul's new apartment.  It will take me about 15 minutes to get there.  Not bad, eh?  Everything is really working out in that area.  He comes in Monday to sign his lease and then it's time for lovin. And maybe some sex. I mean, am I really going to be a 26 year old virgin?  That is just about the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard of.  I thought that being a 25 year old virgin was crazy, but 26???? YIPES! Stripes. Fruit stripes gum. Just stick it in me already. sheesh. So...what else? Our good friend, Angie, is moving to Chiapas, Mexico in a couple of weeks.  Angie has lived either with us, or upstairs from us, since we moved to NYC.  She is Kelly's ex-girlfriend and one of my oldest and most favorite friends.  It is going to be incredibly sad to see her go.  Especially for Kelly.   Angie has decided that she wants to go to Chiapas for 6 months to have the experience of her life.  She will be teaching poor kids how to take pictures with a digital camera and then post them on the internet. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA I am serious. And then Angie will leave Chiapas, take her camera with her, and the kids will be left with nothing, but memories. Hm. yeah. Great educational program. Angie will be back in NYC sometime next summer.   Kelly is trying to get all of us together on Monday night so that we can take her out for drinks and the such.  I am probably going to have to work at the Gap and that pisses me off, cuz I don't want to miss out on the event.  I am really hoping that with the grace of God, I will get scheduled every other day and not that day.  It will be the last time I see Angie for awhile.  Who knows.   You gotta do what you gotta do.   I told Paul about the get together since he will be in NYC on Monday to sign his lease.  He was like "If I stay in the city that night, I will go to Angie's thing."   I'm like: "If I have to work that night, you will not be going to Angie's thing." Of course that comment resulted in a fight and I haven't decided yet if he is allowed to go.  I mean, of COURSE he can go.  But I don't want to miss out on something with MY friend that he gets to be a part of.  Plus, I am not about to get out of work on Monday and have him be completely trashed from having hung out with everyone else.  I told him to go back to Boston right after he signed his lease.  Real mature of me, I know.  But whoever said that I had to be mature when it came to my relationship with Paul?  I think I have proven myself to be QUITE the psycho when it comes to how I react to him during most of our conversations. So that's that. I want Angie to be happy and when it comes down to it, if Paul is going to be in the city, he can go to her thing.   But he can also stay overnight at her place, cuz I am not about to have him jamming his drunk fingers in my sober ass when I get home.   Ari was just reading an article that called "Sisco (thong thong thong lame thong)" an openly gay music artist.   WHAT?????????? I don't EVER remember Sisco saying that he was gay. I mean, of COURSE he's gay.  But please don't tell me that he is doing anything in the way of trailblazing for future gay artists.   The kid's an ugly, horrible bitch that does complete injustice to anything respectable.  Please don't let him get kudos for this. MMMMM....kudos. Member them? I remember when I was in middle school that if you had a Kudos in your lunch, you were the cool kid at school.  I always had those nasty orange peanut butter filled crackers.  I mean, I ate them all in one bite, cuz I was gigantor, but still.... As you see, I was not the cool kid in my school. I was a fat spikey haired gay kid. with cheesy crackers. Wow.  I am so glad that I look and act the way I do now.   (Rita hates it when I talk about what a horrible beast I was when I was little) (It makes her sad) (it makes me glad to be 25) What else.... Tonight I get drunk!  Can you believe I haven't had a drink since last Saturday?  I feel healthy and alive and ready to get blasted!  I have actually earned it this week.  I mean, now that I work two jobs and all.   hahahaha. pth. AIGHT! Guess that is it for now. Peace be with you my little gaylords.

      Just got back from buying a new sweater to wear to my first shift at the Gap.  It is simple, yet elegant.  And it cost me 40 fucking dollars!  It was like the cheapest thing they had.  Why is it that in order to start a new job, one has to pay money, whether it be for new attire, equipment, or briefcases?   Like I would ever need a briefcase for any of the jobs I apply for. Wish me luck!   My fingers are already starting to bleed thinking about the amount of clothes they will be folding. I  LOVE  my life!!!

      Okay...just got another email back from my dad.  They are definitely NOT coming down for Thanksgiving.  So unless I get off Wednesday night at the Gap, I will not be able to spend the holiday with them.   Hmmmm....that breaks my heart. But if that's the decision that they have made, then that is the decision they have made.  I will do my own thing and pretend like the event isn't even happening.   Sounds like a plan to me.   Wow.   Getting older really sucks.

      Back at work having had quite the long weekend.   Was out yesterday due to the migraine from hell.  It's still not completely gone, but I can feel it dissipating with each minute.  I spent 48 hours laying in bed holding my head.  It was the most fun.  NO!  The most fun was when I was waiting for the subway yesterday... I was standing there, nautious as fuck, when suddenly a burp of vomit came into my mouth and spewed onto my nice work pants.  I was mortified and when two nice ladies asked me if I was okay.  I screamed "I'm FINE!  I'M FINE!!!!" and ran away as fast as possible.  Back to bed I went. Saw  My Big Fat Greek Wedding  this weekend.  It was pretty good.  Not what I expected and not nearly as entertaining as I thought it would be.  But glad I saw it!  Now I never have to again!  :-D Other than that the weekend was pretty snores.  Kelly, Rita and I got blasted in our apartment on Saturday night and that's always fun. Paul has decided to definitly take the East Village apartment and will be moving in on December 1st as planned.  That is one week from Sunday!  It is actually happening!  I have to admit, when I think about it I get very happy inside.  It is like the best thing to happen since pizza with bleu cheese.  Two years of waiting...and now 10 more days until it is a reality! I have yet to see the apartment, but for the amount of money they spent on it, I know it will be beautiful.  I was told that it is very small as most village apartments are, but as long as he is happy, I am happy. I am not going to be able to go home for Thanksgiving due to my new job at the Gap.  It will be my first Thanksgiving not in my house in Albany, which is weird and makes me sad.  I mentioned this to my parents last week and my mom said that they were going to try to figure things out so that we could do Thanksgiving at my house in NYC.  That made me feel so good.  Then I come into work today to get an email from my dad that says: "Not having you home for Thanksgiving is a real downer for all of us, but it is really not surprising with a retail job...no way you'd get out of Black Friday tho I did think you could get home Weds and head back Thurs evening...but you gotta do what you gotta do..." Does this mean that they AREN'T coming down for the holiday?  If so, that was a pretty shitty way of telling me.  Whatever.  I'm not going to think about it.  Worst case scenario, I rent movies and watch them in the house alone.  Fine with me.  Kelly invited me to go to dinner with her family, but I really don't want to do that.  I absolutely adore her family.  They are the best.  But spending the holiday with anyone other than Paul or my family is not something I want to do.  I don't know.  It sucks, but I have dealt with it and it will be fine.  My brother will be spending his birthday and Thanksgiving stuck out in a marsh with nothing to eat, but military food and water.  If he can suffer through this holiday in the freezing rain, I can surely suck it up in my warm apartment.  Right? Right. And maybe I am wrong.  Maybe they are still planning on coming down.  Who knows.  I have training at the Gap tonight from 5-9pm.  Last thing I want to do on the planet is go to the fucking Gap from 5-9pm.   Once I am there I will be glad that I went.  Gets me out of the house and will definitly give me the chance to meet some new people.  Not that I am concerned with that.  I like having 4 friends in NYC.  It pretty much.... yeah it sucks. Alright...this journal is pissing me off today.  It's like everything I write is reminding me what a frustrating existence I have.   Maybe that's my cue to sign off.   Will be back when I am more ready to take on some of the issues mentioned in this entry.

      I have a patch of dry skin on my face that will never go away.  No amount of lotion or steroid cream seems to kill it. It is this big:  O I hate it more than I hate just about anything else on my body.  Well, to be honest, it's a toss up between the dry patch and the spare tire I got resting on my waist.  Both combined make me one fiercely ugly bwah! Paul is out looking at apartments right now.  I wish he would just settle on one already!  I want to start picking out things for the house.  I told him last night that I was fully building things for his apartment a la TRADING SPACES.  I am going to put on my best "Hilde" costume and go to town.  But in order to do that the kid needs to settle on a place.  He keeps thinking he will find one that is just that much better.   ARGH! Do you have any idea how happy I am during the day when I know that I will be seeing Paul later on in the night?  I mean, just about THE happiest boy on the planet.  Pretty soon I will have everyone I love the most all in one place.  Kelly, Rita, Paul, Mariah...ROCK! Last night he and I went to KFC and housed a family size bucket of garbage.  I am in no way a fan of KFC, but after smoking the biggest joint humanely possible, the chicken tasted just that much better.  Plus I doused it in Blue Cheese so that I would be able to meet my calcuim requirements for the day. You know. It makes sense. Really. Yeah, I am a FAT ass. With blue cheese legs. Penelope went to the dentist and I am at work alone now.  Well, Rita is here, but she is in her office with her best friend Debbie.  They are sucking on cough drops together.   yew! Rita and I are going to go to this gay bar "Albatross" for happy hour.  Paul is going to see a couple more places and then meet us there for a few more vodka tonics.  I will only be having juice as I will be driving there. BOO WAH! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Never ever ever will that be the case. Today has been the most draggingest day of my life.  Work blows and I can't fucking wait to escape from here. It's just about 4:15pm and I watch the clock tick by in manner of something slow. Yeah!   Wow.  I am so incredibly snoresville today.  I have no sense of humor, nothing clever to contribute... But at least I haven't talked about shitting or pissing.  I know how some of you get squemish about poop and pee.  Just try eating some.  It will cure you from being grossed out by it.    :-X  Tomorrow night the movie  Pumping Iron  will be on Cinemax.  You KNOW I will be taping that shit.  It's like my own personal porno.  I love the fact that all of these huge bodybuilder guys thought that they were making the movie to educate the world on the mechanics of the sport of bodybuilding.   SUCKERS!   I will sit there naked and pulling on my dick to show my understanding!   Maybe I will even play with my balls too, just to give them that extra zing! ZING! These are the things I want to do this weekend: 1)  Go see a movie and drink a 40 while it is showing.   2)  Piss in a cup like I did while watching "The Ring".  (I mean, do YOU want to miss part of a movie just to use the bathroom?) 3)  Hang with Mariah and her roommate Joanna.  Rita and I are hoping that they will return my calls and get some drinks with us.  It's been TOO long since we have all been together.   4)  Sleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep 5)  Sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep - the w + an L = (more) Sleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep 6)  Figure out a way to hook up my playstation.  I miss playing video games. 7)  Rub my balls on Rita's face.  NO JOKE!  One time, I was drunk, but not nearly as drunk as Rita.  She was sitting on the couch on the verge of passing out and I went over to her, unzipped my pants and rubbed my bag of balls all over her face.  After about 2 minutes of this, she raised her head and was like "Wha?" I said: "Go back to sleep...I am rubbing my balls on your face." She said: "Ok.  Carry on" and went back to passing out.   So of course, I "Carried on" by continuing to rub the bag up and down her left cheek. If you know Rita, you know that she is SO serious about what touches her face.  She has a face washing regimine that takes about an hour to do.  She would NEVER, no matter how wasted she is, forget to wash and cleanse her skin.   But that night, she went to bed with at least two of my pubes resting high and proud on her cheekbone.   SICK! I don't know what I am more sorry for...actually rubbing my balls on her face, or for telling the story in here. Good thing she is such a good sport about it all. Good thing, cuz I am doing it again to her this weekend. (sssh...don't tell her that I am keeping this journal.  That way she will never know!) Alright...this entry today is full of nothing, but ridiculousness.  I must go and finish up some shit before I leave this hell hole! PEAYCE! and a bag of balls.

      Sup peeps?! Just ate the most wonderful roll with butter.  It's my new thing now.  I get a Vitamin Water and a roll with butter every morning.  With all of the breakfast possibilities out there, why I have chosen to stick with this simple pleasure, is beyond me.  But I eat it and I love it. Had a great night last night.   I am now a proud employee of the Gap on the Upper East Side.  I had my interview last night and it went smashing!  I shmoozed my ass off and was able to snag the whole week of Christmas off.  They were like: "We don't usually hire holiday staff if they are not able to work during the time around the holidays."  I batted my eyelashes and made some jokes and then the lady was like: "You know what?  Since you are so charming, we would be pleased to offer you the job regardless of Christmas week." HA! They are also paying me $9 an hour!  ROCK OUT!  They said the average pay at the Gap is like $7, but since I basically mind fucked the lady that interviewed me, she offered me more.  Amazing!   Thank you to God for this job. After that I went home and talked to Kelly about the show we are going to be putting up.  We came up with some wonderful ideas and it really seems as though she and I are on the same page with everything.  We are setting the tentative completion date for the show as March 1st.  I am sure it will be a little before or after that date and as soon as I know more details, I will be posting all of the information on here.  Cuz of COURSE you are going to want to come and see it.  I just know it! Once the talk was finished, Kelly made us some DAMN GOOD turkey burgers.  It was my first time tasting such a thing.  I think I may have had one in the past, but I remember hating it with all of my being.  I am a burger kind of guy, so I get skeptical with things like veggie burgers and the like.  But this burger was FINE and I asked it out on a date after Kelly went to bed.   While we were bullshitting, waiting for the burgers to be done, I read Kelly  urlLink A Girl Named Bob's  entry from two days ago.  I was so moved by what she had written that I just had to share it with someone. That Bob is quite a writer.  I fully identify with alot of what she writes about.  Especially now that her boyfriend has moved to California.  When I got close to the end of her entry about the visit to Cali., I actually got a little choked up.  I felt so sad for her.  I have been in her place for the last two years.  What with my boyfriend living in Boston and me in NYC.  It is SO difficult to live like that.   I think that in the two years that Paul and I have lived in this long distance relationship, we have had two breakups, 2 instances of "cheating", and about 354 fights.  All of this is just what I have done.  Paul has never broken up with me or cheated on me.  I have had a very difficult time in trying to figure out how to overcome the fact that we only see eachother once a month.  But that is all changing!  He will be here today to hopefully finalize a deal on a place.  Then within weeks, he will be here and I will be able to see him every day if I want.  (which is what I will probably do for the first month he's here due to the fact that I am finally going to have a REAL RELATIONSHIP!)  MAN!  I hope everyone in my life is as excited for me as I am for myself!!!!!!!! He is supposed to be here today around 1pm.  I actually have butterflies because I am so happy.  :-D It's going to be hard not to stick his dick right in my mouth.   I think my boss might think that was a bit lewd for the office.

      I wish it was Halloween again.   Why am I obsessed with this holiday all of a sudden??  Thanksgiving is just around the corner and all I can think about it how much I like Halloween.  What am I  urlLink Wiccan ? I am having Kelly and Rita make my drug deal for me tonight.  What am I?  The worst friend ever? If they get busted and go to jail over it, I am SO putting on their nicest dresses and walking around the house in their highest heels. mmmmm....highest heels. mmmmm....highest. mmmmmmm...........mmmmmmmmmmmm. I really don't got much to type in here right now, but wanted to spend the rest of the work day    urlLink killing time . Now what to write about? I just ate a chocolate chip cookie with nuts in it. It was so-so. asi asi. yeah well, writing in my journal when I am this uncreative is really sick!  urlLink Enough is Enough !

      When I quit smoking a couple months ago, I made the mistake of telling people at work about it. Since I started up again, my boss thinks it is his personal challenge to reprimand me for having cigarettes and is constantly going "Joe, what are you doing smoking?  I can smell it!" Just now, as Rita and I were going out for our morning smoke, we saw our boss waiting outside the front of the building.  What he was doing just standing there staring is beyond me.  I think he might be a little weird. Well, anyway, Rita goes around the corner of the staircase and sees him and freezes in her tracks.  She calls behind her "Joe, don't move...Teef is standing right outside the building." I decide that it would be VERY covert of me to sneak a peak around the corner of the wall to see what he was doing.  As I am staring at him, he (VERY CREEPILY) turns his head and looks me directly in the eye. HOW DID HE KNOW I WAS THERE??? He points at me and motions for me to just come down the stairs.  Because I don't want to deal with his "lecture" on why I should still be cigarette free, I looked at him in the eye and then just RAN up the stairs.  I pretended as though I was getting my money out of my wallet for a bagel.  Well, there was no need to pretend anything.  He was gone when I came back down the stairs. So essentially what I have done is: a)  Not get away with smoking b)  made myself look like an ass for RUNNING away and  c)  gotten a very tasty roll with butter. YUM!

      Why is it that I can sleep for 4 hours one night and feel totally refreshed, but last night I slept for at least 7 hours and have woken up as a zombie.  My eyes are bleeding, my yawning is excruciatingly even more exhausting, and I feel like the muscles in my face are sagging onto my keyboard. So tired today.  Maybe I need to go jerk one in the bathroom.  That sometimes does the trick. Having never been a coffee drinker, I have always hated the mornings.  I don't DO coffee, cuz it is the only vice I have yet to pick up.  At the age of 25, being a frequent drinker-constant masturbating-pothead seems to be enough.  Oh and sometimes I do whip-its in the bathroom.   sike. sorta sike. These are the things I have to do today: 1)  Get my haircut.  Let me say for the UPTEENTH time in this journal: "I  HATE  getting my hair cut.  HATE HATE HATE. hate 2)  Find something good to eat. 3)  Go to my second interview at the GAP.  HATE HATE HATE second interviews at the GAP. like i have ever had one before. 4)  Talk to Kelly about the show we will be producing/starring in/directing. 5)  fart in my jeans again. 6)  Change the sheets on my bed.  WOW, do I need to do that.  I am convinced that I have bugs nibbling on me during the night.   cuz where ARE those little bumps coming from? 7)  eat a pussy 8)  omigod imagine? 9)  write a number 10 10)  yay!  SHIT!  10 things to do today.  UGH!  How will I ever get them done? Oooh...I gotta mail my bills from work now.  oh, and also have a smoke. Remember when I quit smoking?  That was so ridiculous.  I realize now that I am so much happier and cooler when I smoke.   Quite often I say to Rita and Kelly: "I think I am going to quit smoking for 2 weeks every month!  Cuz when I start smoking again, I realize how much I truly missed it and love it."  Welcome back to YOU lung cancer.  Oh...and hi to you my dear gum disease.   You guys are the best! There is a woman I work with that is a Reformed Rabbi.  When she walks around the office, she  stomps  her feet in the manner of  urlLink Optimus Prime .   She is full out Amazon.   BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM Sometimes I think she is going to break her feet walking like that. Sometimes when I am home when no one else is, I walk around on my tip toes.  I don't know why, but recently I have fallen in love with  urlLink Bobby Valentine . I have no idea why.  I sit on the subway and stare at his picture in the Metrocard Advertisement and think that I love him. I didn't even know who he was until he got fired from the Mets.  Now I want him to take me out on a date to a very nice restaurant. What is he?  Like 65 years old? But what a stud! Great. This bitch needs to eat and smoke. Eat and smoke Bobby Valentine that is.

       Just in case you hadn't heard, I wanted to let you know that "Jenny from the block" aka Jennifer Booger Eater Lopez is engaged again!  This time to botard Ben Affleck.  Sorry, but if I have to see her no-talent, snot eating ass, on the cover of the paper one more time, I might knife her in the eyeballs.  Could she BE anymore pathetic and IRRITATING!  What asshole would marry this bitch?   Yes, I am very vehement in my hatred of J-Glow.

      Just got off the phone with my brother.  We had a great talk.  He was pretty depressed when we started the conversation.  By the end, I had him laughing and in a better mood and that always makes me feel like I am doing my job as his big brother. He just spent a WONDERFUL weekend with a girl he met last August.  Her name is Nina, short for Katrina, and she is from Ireland.  From what Winfield was saying on the phone, she could definitely be in the running as the next possible girlfriend in his life.   Of course I immediatly hated her when I found out that he really likes her. I am so over protective of him and I don't want any girl fucking with his head. :-D He even asked me what I thought about him moving to Ireland after his 4 years with the ARMY is up.  I was VEHEMENT about the fact that I would fly to Ireland to punch Nina in the face, if he so chooses to move there to be with her.   My brother is going to come HOME after the ARMY duty is finished.  Nuff said. :( Ah well.  We will play it by ear. He just left to go back out into the field for a month.  He will be back at his apartment on December 13th.  GAH!  I fucking hate having wonderful conversations with him just to have him go away again for another 4 weeks.   Can I say once again how much I hate the fact that he is in Germany?  In other news, Paul has lost that amazing apartment that we looked at last week.  He had to work in Boston on Saturday, when his two future roommates came down to check out the place.  They decided that "the neighboorhood was too dangerous".  Now granted, I didn't see any white faces on the two blocks that we walked, but who GIVES A SHIT?!?!?!?!?! The apartment was so WORTH it.  Paul NEVER would have given up this apartment if he was here on Saturday.  They just told the guy "no" and went to look at other places in the city.  From what Mariah told me on the phone earlier, these two girls found a few other possibilities, but all of the places are half the size and come with a massive broker's fee.   I laid it on thick with Paul this morning.  I explained to him that these girls were fucking him royally and that he better get on the ball with this or he is going to end up in an apartment the size of a shoebox AND be spending double the amount of money that he would have spent.  Grrrrrrr....I feel horrible for him.   Now, there are 3 other available apartments in the same building as the amazing one.  One of them is on the first floor and is almost identical.  From what Paul says, it has access to the backyard as well.  So he may still get to take that one.  But it is all dependent on what happens in the next two days.  He will be coming back to the city from Wed-Fri morning to look at some of the new places, but hopefully to put a down payment on this last WONDERFUL apartment.  He was pretty sad when I was talking to him.  He may be realizing that these girls aren't going to be right for him, as far as future roommates go.   Whatever, as long as he gets his ass here.  We can deal with them later.  Saturday was Jeannie's wedding! It was one of the most beautiful things I have ever had the pleasure of attending.  She was GORGEOUS and the whole event went off without a hitch.  Rita and the rest of her family were nothing but love. Kelly and I left early Saturday morning and took the train to New Jersey.  Once there, Rita's boyfriend "Scott" picked us up and we stopped at a cafe for breakfast.  The wedding began at 11am and ended around noon.  Rita was a STUNNER, let me tell you.  The other bridesmaid, Leslie, was also a beauty and both of them rocked the house like it was 1999! There were about 1,754 pictures taken.  I was moved to tears about 17 times during the wedding.  I didn't actually let any tears roll down my face until I realized that Rita would be doing the same wedding thing with Scott in the near future.  That made me want to hurl.  And also sob my brains out.   Speaking of Scott...he was an absolute STUD at the wedding.  He is such a perfect person to have at any function.  He is willing to help out, so easy to talk to, and funny as shit!  Everyone at the wedding just LOVED him.  It is impossible to count how many people came up to him and asked him if he was next.  Every time someone posed that question when I was around, I would shoot him a dirty look and whisper to him: "You do it, you die!" Rita is supposed to be MY girl forever! and ever. Amen. The wedding reception was a fucking blast.  It started around 12:30pm and that is when we began dumping booze down our throats.  Kelly and I must have had 2 bottles of wine, just between the two of us.  And that was just during the dinner.  The dancing was INSANITY and I made sure to get freaky with both Rita's mom and every available woman in the place.  INCLUDING, 5 crazy married women from VA.  I can't even explain how nuts the whole thing was, but I can say that it was filled with hysterical laughter, hugs, and the Electric Slide.  OF COURSE!   Once Leslie caught the bouquet (THANK GOD!), we all went back to the hotel to continue doing it up!  Kelly and I went up to our room to change and smoke a bowl, when the funniest shit in the world happened. You see... Kelly and I were pretty drunk when we got to the hotel.  When we got to our room, we both SQUEALED like little girlie pigs and went running through the place.  We were out of our minds.  We were jumping on the beds, climbing up the walls, and basically just acting like 13 year old children.  At one point, I took a piece of the curtain and slammed it into her face.  I screamed "DUCK!" and slammed it right onto her glasses, which in turn, smashed right into her eye.  She then slapped me SO HARD right across the face.  We both sat there stunned for a minute, not understanding how things had gotten so out of control. It was just about the funniest thing I have ever seen.  Kelly and Joe go CRAZY in their hotel room until they slap eachother to calm down.   It worked.  We were much more behaved after that. Finally, we met up with Rita and the rest of the gang, and joined the rest of the crowd at the party.  We OWNED that hotel lobby until about 12am.  Rita's mom and sister in law, stayed up with us and were just about the MOST fun.  God, there must have been 10 of us crowded around a little table, all talking at the same time: yelling, laughing, going out of our minds. Man...it sounds hectic, I know.   And it was! I have never had so much fun!!! Kelly and I went back to the room around 12am and continued to stay up and drink and talk.  I think we finally passed out around 3am only to get back out of bed at 9am for breakfast.   It was an unbelievable whirlwind for everyone involved. Kelly was the PERFECT date.  She was fun, easy, and brought tons of cash!  hahahaha! If I had it to do over again, I would bring her.  She made me very proud. Rita's family is absolutely beautiful.  They were ALL nice to us, giving us hugs, and inviting us over for dinner. Her one aunt, in particular, Maribeth, was a God send.  She was SO funny and did nothing, but take Kelly and I under her wing for the entire party.  As Rita had explained to me prior to the event, "Maribeth's family is like one you will never meet."   They are that perfect. SO yeah!  The whole thing was a raging success.  Rita, Kelly, and I spent yesterday trying to detox.  I think Rita slept for 12 hours last night and I KNOW that I had at least 12 diarrhea shits.  Kelly still feels like garbage today.  I am not kidding when I say that we DID IT UP!  15 hours of drinking, dancing, and debauchery.  That'll get ya every time! I would do it again this weekend, if I could. UGH!   Okay...I just got off the phone with Paul again.  I gotta go help him with some apartment bullshit. I can't wait until he is just here already!

      I think I said everything I wanted to say yesterday and now I am left with nothing to write about.   Third Eye Blind  is playing on my Launch player right now and it is fully enjoyable. Kelly and I are going to see  8 Mile  at 6pm.  She called him a legend yesterday and I burst out laughing.  Legends of the  fall. Okay, that's all I have to write today. Hope everyone has a BOMB weekend!!!!!!

       Can someone stop me before I really hurt one of my friends???   What is wrong with me?  I am like two different people.  Completely split down the middle.  From 9am-5pm I am a miserable mean bitch.   I have good moments, but I find myself so  GRRRRRRRRRR  with most of my day.  It's really disconcerting. When I wrote my "Ten Reasons Why I love Justin Timberlake", I really thought that the entry read as funny and light.  A sarcastic way of saying to the world that it is OK for me to be obsessed with this artist.  I dedicated it to Fish and Ari because they were participating in an IM about how I was a really great guy with a very powerful weakness for cheese.  Not edible cheese, although that is a serious weakness too.   Justin cheese. (the most expensive brand) I meant it to be fun and stupid, but Ari just called in a panic, hoping that she hadn't truly offended me.  And the thing is...she didn't at all! I just re-read what I wrote and thought to myself "How could they NOT take that as a slam?"  Although I meant it as a shout out to the world, it CLEARLY came across as a letter directly addressed to one, Miss Ari and two, Miss Fish.  I also noticed that I wrote "Fish That Needs A Bicycle" when we all know that that is quite against the contrary.  I apologize for that typo Fish.  I got more respect for you than that playa shit.   I should never write when I am at work.  My entries are coming from someone I don't even recognize. Last night Paul looked me right in the eye and goes: "You're crazy." Just that. "You're crazy." And you know what? He's totally right.  I kept coming back at him with "YOU'RE crazy."  "oh no YOU'RE crazy".  "YOU?  YOU be crazy." That's all I could say because I knew he was totally right. What is going on with me?  Seriously.   I am going...well...crazy.   How do I learn to relax?  I am riding on a so much tension these days that often I do feel like I am losing my mind.   During my average day I will have conversations with strangers and get to a point in the conversation where I start to panic.  I don't know what to say anymore.  My heart starts to beat faster, my head gets all foggy and I actually just stand there quiet.  Who is this person? I am usually exactly the opposite.  I can talk to people I don't know with ease.  I am the man with the "ly's".  You know that guy.  The one that always responds to whatever you say with "exactly", "definitely", "totally", "always".   did u not catch that? go back and tell me why "always" is not what I say. I am the guy that makes you feel good.  People have always wanted to be around me because I am a genuinely nice guy.   It's what I base everything on. And I think we can all agree that Joe Cut the Shit hasn't been a  nice  guy for awhile. He seperated from me at some point.   I think I have fought more with my friends in the last year than I ever have in my life.  I am constantly having to either apologize for something or prove my position on a topic to the point of a full blown screaming match.   Dammit Joe. Stop it.   Why, when I know that Paul is here for only 12 hours, do I find myself so ANGRY?  I lash out.  I come across as insincere. I am alienating myself from the outside world. And it scares me. Quite a bit. It is going to be very hard for me to make it as an actor if I have a piss poor attitude.  Or if I am a mean-hearted person. Now, I do know that I am hard on myself.  So hard on myself. I am not like this all the time.  Usually I am this guy during my work day.  Nighttimes are totally cool with me.  I slow it down and I smile a lot more.  I don't dig my fingernails into my thumb looking for an escape from my peers.   Okay wait.  Now I just decided that I am a complete weirdo.  Dig my fingers into my thumb?  Yes, I do that alot.   Told you...legitimate split personality.   Maybe I am growing up and it is natural for an adult male to become a jaded fuck. Maybe I am SUPPOSED to be acting like a prick all the time. Well THAT was an easy lesson to learn. :( Rita and I had a talk last week about some serious shit. We hashed out some issues and I walked away from the conversation believing that I was right in most points that I made.  And that she agreed.   However, upon further investigation, I am seeing so much truth in what she had to say.  When she confronted me with some of my recent personality traits, I was like: "Oh no no.  I am not that and I am so perfect and wonderful and like an angel that gets it's wings, I fly over the clouds and up into the beautiful blue...." right. Now I sit here and see VERY clearly the point she was trying to make.  Yesterday Rita asked me what was wrong.  I said "nothing".  I mean, I felt good, Paul was coming into town...things should have been perfect.  But as the day went on I started acting as though something really  was  wrong. Was it that Rita planted the seed of bad, depressing things in my head? OR Was it that she knows me better than most and saw straight through to my core before I did? I pick choice B now.  Oh.  Didn't you know that they were choice A and choice B? It was choice B. If Rita asks me if anything is on my mind, why do I feel compelled, even if subconciously, to act like the guy who's got it all together? I surely don't have it all together and Rita knows that better than anyone. So why am I playing this game? I don't know. What I do know is that I am cruising for a breakdown soon.  It's been coming for awhile.   When I was a senior in college, I was just coming to grips with changing my major.  It was the most stressful time of my life.  I mean, everyone wanted me just to finish my Education degree and GRADUATE already.  So before a performance of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", I was saying goodbye to two of my housemates at the time, Rita and Erica, who were giving me nothing but smiles and "Break a leg!". As I was saying goodbye I absolutely BURST into a violent explosion of tears.  I collapsed on their laps and just sobbed for about 15 minutes.  It was so intense that for the first 5 minutes neither of them said a word.  They just held me and let me get it out. I will never forget it. I just RELEASED. I am not a huge cryer.  I mean, I don't have any sort of problem with crying.  I will cry with pride and I expect and encourage my friends to cry with pride as well.  It's a healthy and natural emotion. But let's not do it too much, cuz then you're just a lump of sobbing annoyance in my life. Am I right? I be right. After I collapsed with those two girls, I felt as though I had the strength of ten men.  I was flying high for months.  It was shortly after that that I got my life together.   That's where I think I am headed now.  In an eerie coincidence, it was 4 years ago, around Thanksgiving, that I had my big sobfest. I keep thinking that I can predict when my life is going to take the turn towards productive and rewarding.  Whether it be a sobfest, a change in the weather, the fact that I am irresistibly adorable...I just don't know. Foolish boy I am. Ah well.   I got to just let it happen.  And I have to remember the lessons I am learning each day. Today's lessons are: 1)  Next time you start to act like a prick, take a step back and contemplate the delivery of what you got to say. 2)  RELAX 3)  Don't be so hard on self 4)  Tighten that body up oh.  didn't really mention my body image problems today.  haha.   but still, tighten it up Joe. 5)  Be MUCH kinder to Paul 6)  Allow self to go to friends with any sort of problem; even if don't feel comfortable, at the time, discussing it.  Well!  That is quite a few things to think about. Nice. Alright, I am going to call my mom now.  Just need to hear her voice. My final words: Fish:  Feel v. bad about what other self said earlier.  Other self wishes to apologize to H. in hopes that H. will forgive and understand that Joe acts like immature tool during most of his social interactions with others.  Fish knows Joe and knows that he thinks v. highly of her.   BTW Fish, fuck the bicycle. Ari:  I don't need to say much to you cuz I talked to you on the phone tonight.  Thank you for being my concious.  Sorry that I am grumps Mcgrumps during most of our work days.  You told me I would become you, the way you became Fran, and guess what...whether I like to admit it or not, you were right.   Fran is really to blame.  :) Rita:  I have thought about our conversation and I thank you for bringing to my attention some things that were hard for you to say, but necessary for me to hear.  I will work on my stuff too.  You are my ladles.  Forever and ever, amen. YAY WEDDING! Kelly:  You are a gaylord.   Paul:  Like Paul reads my journal. hahahaha like I would just call Kelly a "gaylord" and move on.   Kelly:  For once I don't have anything to apologize to you about.  Wait, we are hanging out tomorrow to watch "8 Mile".  I am sure I will hurt your feelings at some point.  So, in advance,  I am sorry for hurting your feelings. Ok, that it! One more thing about Justin and I will let it go. for tonight. His second single off the album is called "Cry Me a River".  It is pure genius.  Seriously.  I think it will grab the attention of people who (as most of my readers do) loathe him.  There isn't that much Michael Jackson influence in the song.  I think it's a winner.  Please let me know if it changes anyone's opinion about him. I will post any and all GOOD responses.   If they be bad responses, they be sleeping in my recycle bin.   But I am truly believing in what I say right now.  You really may like this one! I am going to go in my room now, take off my prom dress and call my girlfriends on the phone so we can discuss Justin some more. If we play the NSYNC boardgame I am totally being Justin.  Ari, you can be Chris Kirkpatrick. HAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHA.  Fine.  you can be JC if you want. he's pretty cool. Thanks for reading my long entries today.   Sorry I am "crazy".

       10 Reasons Why I love Justin Timberlake                  by Joe Cut the Shit    Dedicated to Ari and The Fish That Needs A Bicycle   10)  The way he moves is sumptin else.  Pop lock dancing?  Uh yeah...amazing.   9)  His voice, although falsetto most of the time, is smooth, clear, and rhythmic. 8)  He always performs live.  Oh, you thought he was lip synching?  Yeah no.  He's that good. 7)  He's real.  Always acting like himself.  The only show Justin puts on is on stage. 6)  He's cutting edge.  His music tends to border on that of chaos - fly beats and new rhythms combined with a distinct melody. 5)  He works hard.  Very hard. 4)  It's not COOL to like Justin when you are 25 years old and a boy.  That makes me like him more. 3)  His image.  He appeals mostly to a younger crowd and still finds a way to keep his shit clean.  Regardless of the fact that he is at that age when it is almost IMPOSSIBLE to keep your shit clean. 2)  He is sexy as fuck.  While not my physical type, I have an easy time understanding why guys and girls alike would want to spend a night kissing his fuckable lips. 1)  He's a fucking SUPERSTAR for a reason.  He has been working his ass off since he was a child.  Despite growing up in front of the public eye, Justin is someone who must be commended on doing it right.  He hasn't been to jail, had a drug problem, or even been caught shoplifting.  Justin is a class act.  He has earned everything he's got.  I realize that most people in their 20's or 30's don't understand the hype behind the Justin phenomenon.  But also understand this...when you were all screaming at the top of your lungs for  Warrant  and  Skid Row  no one gave you a hard time for liking male bands that wore more make-up than you!   I will always be willing to take a good Justin bashing, but I also think it should be pointed out that everyone likes music that they can identify with.  If I happen to identify with a guy that sings higher than your mother, then so be it.  I like him and don't need to be reminded every day what a loser I am for appreciating his style. Right? Thank you and goodnight.

      I stumbled across a GENIUS website today.   I received a 5 dollar bill with this website printed on it:   urlLink www.wheresgeorge.com  When I went to the website, I logged in the serial number and series date of the bill and I was able to track down where this 5 dollar bill has been over the last year.  It was the fucking coolest thing I have ever seen.   I immediatly logged in the bill and spent it in order to send it on its way.   Then I came back from lunch and took out a 1 dollar bill, marked it up and will send it on its way later tonight. What a cool concept!   However, isn't it against the law to deface currency? oooooooh.  I am so badass.

      Well! Paul is gone. Lately, these visits have been so quick that I have a hard time believing that he was ever here to begin with. I had my interview at the Gap last night and it was so snores that I don't even know what to say about it.  It was a group interview so I was stuck in a room with 10 other random people.  There was one girl there that didn't speak any English and at one point she got so frustrated and upset that her eyes filled with tears and she said:  "I got to go bathroom", grabbed her bag and bolted.  It was sad.  And also funny as shit.   Paul told me not to tell that story anymore cuz he thinks that there is no humor in people getting their feelings hurt.  Yeah ok Paul.  That's the only thing that IS funny on this earth. Sike. sorta sike. I now have to wait 48 hours to get a phone call from the Gap Management.  If I don't hear from them, I don't get a second interview.  Now...if I don't hear from them, am I really supposed to believe that the other 10 people in the room were more qualified than me? Well, I guess that depends on if the Gap is looking for people who just recently obtained their GED, regardless of how old they are.   Cuz really. After the interview, Paul was supposed to be waiting outside for me.   Of course he wasn't there.  Thank God I had a calling card on me (you read that right, my po' ass don't got no cell phone).  I called Paul and he was like: "Where are you?"  I'm like: "Where are YOU?!!?!?"  Turns out he was across the street at  Aldo  trying on shoes.  I ran across the street to see Paul standing in the doorway of  Aldo  holding up two pairs of shoes and grinning ear to ear.  I was like: "What are you DOING?"  He had obviously sucked down a bottle of vodka in the half hour that he was waiting for me and I must admit, he looked fucking adorable standing there with his new shoes.  I immediately called the shoes "womanly" and "hideous" and ushered him out of the store before he could waste more money on shoes he doesn't need. After we got home, something bad happened. We went to buy groceries for dinner and got into a bit of a fight over whether or not he was going to buy me "Hawaian Punch Fruit Chews".  He didn't end up buying them for me because "Candy is bad for Joe.  Not healthy enough".   So instead, he buys a roll of sugar cookies. Um? Yeah. Ah geez. After we get home, I threw a temper tantrum because I didn't want my steak to be covered in mushrooms and gravy.   "But Joe, have I ever made anything that you didn't like?"  "No Paul, you haven't.  But gravy is something that makes me gag on sight."  When my back was turned he slopped gravy onto everything and I started hissing like the gay snake that I am.  I went into my room to chill out for a minute.  When I came back out into the kitchen, I did something so stupid and regrettable.  I embarrassed him in front of Rita by making fun of the fact that he just recently lost his internship.  I don't know why I did it and I know that it is something that really upsets him.  The minute I said it I wished I could have erased it and started over.  Too late. After that comment, he and I had a HUGE arguement full of slander and acid tongues at the kitchen table.  Rita sat politely and quietly on the couch and I became increasingly more humiliated as the conversation went on.  Eventually I just stopped speaking because I was horrified at where the conversation was going.   It was quite awful and I felt horrible for Rita for having to sit there and endure it all.  Fuck.  It sucked. I then went back in my room to chill out again.   After Rita came into my room to say goodnight, I went back out into the kitchen again and Paul and I worked shit out.  For the most part.  It was a rough hour and sometimes I wish I could exhibit more self-control in these type of situations.  Especially with Paul. Once dinner was over, we watched  The Simpsons  and then began to kiss and touch.  It was incredibly romantic and I just laid back and let whatever was going to happen, happen.   The love making last night was so real and intense that when I orgasmed, I actually started to cry.   Now, I don't know if you have ever had a moment like that, but it is the scariest thing on the planet.  Especially when you have been with someone for 3 years. In all that amount of time, I may have cried once or twice in the moment of passion.   I felt so overwhelmed with love and understanding for him.  It was so raw.  He wiped my tears and kissed me on the forehead.  It was one of the most beautiful moments we have ever had.  Also, it was one of the best love making sessions I have had in my entire life, much less with Paul.  We also discussed having sex and both decided that once he moves here, it will be one of the first things that we do together.  It's been a long time coming, but I know it will be worth the wait. Shortly after that we discussed the move for a while and then I crawled into his arms and fell into the deepest sleep of my life.  The night hours flew by faster than normal and we both woke up at 6am and mushed our bodies as tight together as we could. I felt love and happiness corsing through my gay veins.   It was mind blowing.  I reluctantly got out of bed to shower this morning and to save time I didn't even shave.  As soon as I had my clothes back on, I jumped back into bed to hold him for 15 more minutes before I had to leave for work.  I said goodbye at 8am and then made my way to the subway. Bye Paul. Having him move to NYC to be with me is just about the best thing that has happend to me in a long time.  Not that good things haven't happened, but this is something that is not only going to change my life, but make it better.  I have waited 3 years for this to happen and it is almost time!   I have been saying quick prayers all day that this new apartment will work out for him.  I have been praying that he and I will be able to be candid with eachother, but still find a way to be respectful and helpful to eachother.  Because I love him so much and because we have known one another so intimately for so long, it gets increasingly easier to whip out the acid tongue and  say whatever is on our minds.  I, for one, need to be careful.  If I love him so much, then I have to make sure that I treat him well and that I cherish him, rather than cut him down.   Paul is my ghoulie and I am happier with him now than I have ever been.  (big sigh) In other news... Jeannie will be married as of Saturday morning.  I am still shocked by this whole event.  She is 23 years old and is planning to spend the rest of her life with her husband, Rich.  How does she know this at 23 when I don't know even know to be nice to my own boyfriend? I am thrilled to be invited to this event and I am taking Kelly as my date.  I did ask Paul originally, but he doesn't feel comfortable yet going to an event as an openly gay man.  I guess I can understand that.  I would be nervous too and these are my best friends.   Rita looks absolutely gorgeous in her maid of honor dress.  She is wearing a very slim fitting purple dress with a very LIGHT sprinkling of sequins.  YES THE SEQUINS LOOK GOOD ON THE DRESS!  I KNOW THAT SEQUINS ARE WRONG AND ONLY MEANT FOR BEDAZZLER GUNS, BUT I PROMISE YOU IT LOOKS GREAT WITH THIS DRESS!  sorry for screaming at u. The wedding is at 11am. Kelly and I will leave around 7am to get on the 8am train to NJ.  We will attend the ceremony, then take tons of pictures, eat and booze it up at the reception and then make our way to a fun filled, alcohol filled, evening at a hotel!  I really can't think of a better way to be spending my weekend. YAY JEANNIE!  WHAT A HUGE DAY FOR YOU! I am so proud to be going. I guess that's it for now.  It has been quite an interesting couple of days.   A good couple of days. If I keep farting in my chair, I am bound to blow a hole right through the cushion.

      OMIGOD! I can't believe it.  Paul and I just got back from looking at a couple apartments.  The first one we looked at was nice, but the building smelled like piss and the area seemed a little rough.  The superintendent was nice and very helpful.  We looked at the place and then figured we would just move on.  Then the super is like: "Wait a few minutes and I will show you a couple apartments that haven't been listed yet." So we stand around for a bit and then the super takes us down to 112th and 7th avenue.  One block from Central Park I might add.  We walk into this apartment that is on the first floor of this BEAUTIFUL building.  There is a lounge right outside of the apartment that has nice couches, a coffee table, and (randomly) 6 picutres of Marilyn Monroe a la Andy Warhol Style. When the super opened the door, I screamed "Holy Shit!" and immediately went RUNNING through the place.  I am still overwhelmed at what I saw.  There are two bedrooms on the first floor (yes, you read that right...the first floor), a full bath, a beautiful kitchen, HUGE living room and a great view.  Then, there is this long winding staircase that goes to the basement and this is the point in which I piss all over myself.   On the bottom level is the master bedroom and amazing full size bathroom.  It is GIGUNDO!  There is a good size sitting room outside this bedroom as well.  UM! There is this little hallway outside the master bedroom that leads to the backyard.  UM!  YES!  BACKYARD!  If Paul takes the place, and he will(!), he will have access to this strip of concrete backyard all for himself!  Well, and his roommates can use it, I guess.   They have a dishwasher, fully renovated kitchen with a flat stove, silver chrome fridge, intercom system, night security guard, washer/dryer in the building... MAN!  I swear to God it's a mansion. Now, how much is it you ask? Yeah.  Well only $2600.   I KNOW! I sit here shocked to my core that he has stumbled across such an incredible deal!  I am thrilled for him.  He has been stressing about this move for months and it really seemed that he was going to have some major trouble in finding a place.  But this is really going to work out for him and in such a wonderful way.  He deserves it.  The kid works harder than anyone I know and it's nice to be able to see him get something he really wants.   Plus, I get to live there with him whenever I want!! I took a cab from this apartment to work.  I was nervous that I was going to be late from my lunch break.   WELL GUESS WHAT?!?!?!?!  The cab ride cost me $2.50 and it took only 4 minutes to get to work.  UMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM! My commute now is an hour and when Kelly, Rita and I move to Brooklyn, it is going to be an hour and 20.   But now that is no real worry!  I can stay at his place whenever I want and sleep until 8:30am and STILL be to work on time.   I am floored.  This is all working out perfectly.   Thank the Lord! Praise God! Hallelujah Amen! Whoo hoo! Well, that's that.  :-D Tonight I have an interview at the Gap.  Ugh.  I have to get a second job and tonight will decide whether or not I am working there over the holidays.  I am not that happy about it, but once I am making some extra cash, I think my opinion will change. Wish me luck!  I gotta be there by 5:15pm. Yesterday Rita and I ran errands.  We had the day off due to "Election Day" or some shit.  We both went and voted, then I dropped off my Gap application and then we hit Target to buy her sister wedding presents.  (The wedding is in 3 days!  WOW!!!) While at Target, Rita and I went over to the music section to see if Justin's new cd was in stock.  It just came out yesterday morning, so I didn't think they would have any copies left.  BUT THEY DID!  I am so broke and knew that I couldn't buy it until next week.  Next thing I know, Rita and I are wrestling eachother to the ground cuz she wanted to buy it for me.  I really didn't want her to have to do that, but it was nice that she cared enough about my Justin obsession to help a brotha out.   She bought it for me and it was probably one of the nicest gifts I have ever been given.  She bought me my boyfriend's solo debut album. Wow.  What a friend. BTW...the cd is wonderful.  I have listened to it all the way through about 5 times already; or course stopping to play the ones I like over and over.  I LOVE IT! After the interview tonight, Paul and I will make a nice romantic dinner together and settle in to watch a movie.  I am thrilled to be able to spend the night with him.  I can't WAIT until we are doing this all the time.  Only 3 more weeks! I am filled with such happiness and excitement right now.   What a day...

      I got an email from "A Girl Named Bob" this morning, explaining that urlLink Sour Patch Kids  have literal acid on them.  Hence the reason why my tongue still feels like I dipped it into a boiling pot of, well....acid!How can they put acid on a candy???  I have been eating these things for years and I never knew that you could either eat Sour Patch Kids or use them to take the acryllic off your car.  Gosh!  Time for me to be a LITTLE more careful in the candy I choose. Want to know something even more ridiculous? Do you know the candy called  urlLink Warheads ?  Well the makers of this extremely wonderful, but horribly painful candy have come up with liquid warhead juice.  Paul and I used to buy sour patch kids and squirt the liquid wardhead juice all over it.  We would soak the "kids" in the juice and see who could last the longest.   Then we would wonder why our tongues would bleed for days. It was pretty great. Yeah. Pretty great.

      Welcome back to this shithole I like to call my job. The weekend came and went faster than any I have ever had before.  I don't understand how it is Monday already.  I was laying in my bed last night wondering how it was possible that I had to get up and come to work again today.   Luckily, our office is closed for Election Day tomorrow, so Rita, Ari, and I have the day off.  How random and wonderful! Tonight, Rita, Kelly and I will go to see  urlLink The Ring .  I had told Rita that I wasn't going to drink tonight, even though we have off from work tomorrow.  Then I decided how fun it would be to drink in the movie theater.   Great.  More useless calories for me!   But I'll sleep like a baby. Last night for our family dinner, the three of us made breakfast.  We had pancakes, homefries, turkey bacon, omelettes, and lemon water.  It was fucking bizomb.  I usually hate breakfast, but when it's for dinner...I love it!  While we were deciding to have that, the  three of us all commented on how our parents used to make breakfast for dinner all the time when we were little.  Little and poor.  Pancakes are for the cheap. Well, anyway, when Paul called last night, I told him that we were having "Breakfast for Dinner" and he goes: "Awesome.  My parents used to do that all the time when I was little."  Then this morning, Kelly told her sister, Aly, that we had "Breakfast for Dinner" last night and Aly said: "HAHA.  Dad makes that for me all the time." Either we all come from families of hobos or pancakes for dinner is some good old fashioned American eats! Spiderman the movie sucks. So Ari just walked by my computer and noticed "Breakfast for dinner".  She loves it too!  What is the deal with this world???? Paul is coming into town on Wednesday night.  He and I will be going to look at some more apartments.  Hopefully we will be spending most of the time in bed, but that kinda depends on how many places he has to see. How nice is it that I get to see him more than once a month?  Pretty nice.  He called the other day and we had a "normal" talk.  Just under an hour later he calls back and I'm like: "What's going on?  What's wrong?", cuz he never calls just to call.   Paul responds by saying:  "I just love you so much". Course my heart melts all over the floor and I go "Shut the fuck up you piece of shit!" Then I slammed the phone down on him. Cuz really...back off! alright...if you believed any of that, then you are too easily convinced that I am a psycho.  What I actually did when he said: "I just love you so much" is make gurgling baby noises and tell him that he is my favorite person on the planet.  Man.  He is the best. The heat is broken in our office building today.  It is fucking freezing.  My nuts are the size of little snow peas and Rita's hands look like they have been smashed with a sledge hammer.  They are purple and twisted.  Well, not so much twisted.   BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR......................... Oof dah.  I have yet to take a shit since BEFORE the Breakfast for Dinner extravaganza.  Then I had about a box of candy and a cheese sandwich before I ewent to bed.  Then this morning I had a roll with butter.  Now I have to go. Kelly said that I am going to have a: Pancakebaconomeletthomefriescandycheeserollwithbutter poop.  I think she could be right. Also, just now I kept saying to Kelly over AIM:  "Oh you."  Then she was like:  "Oh me, what?" So I just happend to randomly write  urlLink www.ohyou.com  and she actually clicked on it. When she did, this crazy lady screams: "VERISIGN IS A BAD COMPANY!" She told me what happend and then I clicked on it too.  But I didn't realize that she was going to scream it.  I thought it was going to be a stupid pop up window. Everyone in the office knows that "Verisign is a bad company" now. OK...horrible story.  But the way it transpired was pretty damn fun. Alright fuck you then.

       HAPPY DAY AFTER HALLOWEEN!  Wow!  What fun we had last night!  We did everything we said we would do and I, for one, had a fucking blast.  Rocky Horror was amazing.  I don't really have all that much to say about it except that I love my girls so much.  It was pure fun and at no point did I feel that I wanted to be with anyone else.  Not even my boyfriend. So, last Sunday I decided it would be not only healthy, but appropriate to shove my face with about 3 pounds of Sour Patch Kids.  I just love those little guys. I ate and ate and sucked on and ate as many as I could possibly stomach.  At one point my tongue felt as though it was engulfed in flames.  I swear I heard it split at the seam.   Yet, I continued to eat.   "GO JOE!", I thought to myself as I pushed through the pain the "kids" were causing my mouth. Well, it's now been 5 days and my tongues still feels fucked up. Is it possible that I did permanent damage? This morning on the subway, Kelly told me that she had a friend in highschool who's father got tongue cancer.  They removed half of his tongue.  He then walked around with it bobbing up and down all weird-like in his mouth.  Cept, Kelly was convinced that part of it regenerated.   Well, that's comforting. Kelly works two doubles this weekend. Joe works nothing. Well, Joe works the floor at the Jane party tomorrow. I am going to go and act extra smarmy.  So that people think that I am something BIG!  When I get asked the question: "You're an actor Joe, right?  Have I seen you in something?" I will say: "Why yes, you have.  You have seen my fist in your face!" Then I will lay a HUGE egg fart and walk away all casually. Now that is some class dawg! Tonight Rita and I are renting movies.  Sunday afternoon, once Kelly is finally realeased from her hellish prison, Rita and I will show her "Boogie Nights" and then Kelly and I will show Rita "Happiness".  Pretty excited about curling up on the couch and watching awesome movies. Note only for Kelly: Hey Kelly!  I saw a picture of Sam today on her website.  Brass Tacks bullshit. Sam is supa skinny now.  She looked so different.  I mean, some things never change.  You nose what I mean. But still!  Fuck!  She is really getting her shit together. Good thing I just keep wallowing away in my own degredation and filth. End note to Kelly. Sam used to be my ex-girlfriend.  We were together for 3 years off and on.  The only thing physical we did in that time period was kiss like 4 times.  Once I put her hand on my dick just to give her a thrill. Man that girl loved me. Poor thing. Now she looks pretty good. Ok snores. Have a great weekend ya'll.   PEAYCE!

      MERRY CHRISTMAS EVE! How happy have I been over the last couple of days?  I think it is impossible for me to find the right words to explain it.   My brother is here and I can't seem to stop hugging him.  He will be casually walking by the room and I find myself jumping up and tackling him to the ground... We are getting along famously, as though he has never left, and last night there was a definite brother/brother gang up on the parents as we were playing a game of cards.  Having my family all back together is the best gift I could have gotten this Christmas.  Everyone is in GREAT moods and there hasn't been even a second of grief or frustration. So far, this has been just about the best holiday ever. Last night we put up our Christmas tree and I gave my parents my "special" gift.  Giving my parents access to my journal was one of the riskiest and most perfect thing I could have ever done.  After some tears were shed and some explanations were given, my family and  I had the most intense and introspective conversation about my gay lifestyle.  We exchanged our fears, our confusion, and and and!!!!! And I never felt so good about being me ever in my life before.   My family loves me so much and it is apparant in everything that they do. While I was feeling some apprehension about showing them some of my most private writings, they took it all with grace and wonder and I sit here today feeling as though I made the best and right decision. They respect me and they are here for me. What else could a gaylord like me ask for? My mom also got Paul a gift and that was just about the sweetest thing anyone could have ever done.  She truly does care.  A great deal. We played cards and drank booze (my mom sucking down the pot as though it was water) until the wee hours of the morning and then I passed out and experienced the most amazing night's sleep I have had since before I started at the Gap.   Today is CHRISTMAS EVE and we have MUCH planned.   My granny should be here within the hour and tonight we have some friends coming over.  We will drink and laugh and share funny stories.  We have about a thousand traditions and if we don't get started early, we will never accomplish them all.  Lord knows we have to be in bed by midnight...Santa gets in around 1:30am and we must be fast asleep.... I have gone MUCHLY overboard in my purchases for my family.  I just got back from the mall.  I didn't necessarily NEED to buy more things, but what's a Christmas without me going to Crossgates and picking up a few last minute items.  I saw just about everyone I went to highschool with and HOW PROUD did I feel when I explained to the few I talked to that I live in NYC and am just home for a couple of days... "Oh Joe, we MUST get together before you go back"... "Oh (insert highschool asshole's name here), you see...I just don't care about you anymore.  See you never." HA. Back to NYC I go. Tomorrow is a big day.   Presents and dinner and playing with all of my new toys.  I have a feeling that my parents have really gone out on a limb for me this year.  They do every year anyway, but this year.... This year I might be a bit embarrassed at their generosity. Good.  This bitch is poor and needs some new shit! Tomorrow night, Mariah, Kelly, my brother, and maybe a few other randoms, will join me in going to the "Power Company", one of Albany's biggest and most ridiculous gay clubs.  We will dance and drink Christmas night away and to be honest...I just can't wait.  It feels SO good to show off my hot self at the club.  Knowing that I will have some hot people with me to do the same thing make me gets jitters of excitement.   Time to take over the scene I tell ya! I guess that's it for now... I don't know if anyone will be reading this, but if you do...MERRY CHRISTMAS! The only thing that would make this flawless is if Paul could be here with me.   Miss that booger like nothing else. When he left yesterday morning, he sat and stared at me for about 10 minutes not speaking.  I sat there doing the same. Finally he said: "Joe, I just love you so much.  I see you every day, yet I can't get over the fact that I have to spend the next week without you.  You are the most important thing in my life." I sat there stunned and said: "Could you make sure to lock the front door when you leave?" NICE ONE JOE! I did tell him I loved him.  And I do miss him tremendously.  It just feels so good that he cares so deeply about me.  We really are finding our niche in this relationship and I feel incredibly happy and contented with where we are at right now. HERE IS TO A BEAUTIFUL AND GREAT WEEK!  No WORK!  No having to deal with shithead customers at the GAP!  NO NOTHING I DON'T WANT TO DO UNTIL JANUARY 2nd!  FUCKING ROCK! MERRY CHIMMA!  (As my granny would put it!)  Oh and Rita...we miss you tremendously.  My parents read your card over and over  this morning and my dad welled up with tears.  Thank you for being you. And by the way...did you get your RING yet??????????????????????????????? Off to play with my family some more!  Enjoy!

      This will be my last entry until I see my brother, Christmas comes, and I get time off from both of my jobs! I have decided to piece together bits and pieces of this journal and give it to my family as a special present for Christmas.  Every year we try to give eachother gifts that are not soley based on money.  We try to do special things. In the past I have written poems, made photo collages, framed greeting cards (that was a VERY lean year), and even created coupons for free dish-washing, driveway shoveling, etc.   This year I wanted to share something with them that is very important to me; something that gives that some insight as to what I go through while I am here in NYC.   I cant believe this year is over. Gosh, it isnt possible. It really seems like just yesterday I was standing in Times Square saying goodbye to my brother and now in 72 hours I will be at the airport waiting for him to come home.   Uhwhat? I praise God that we all got through this year safely.   Thank you Lord for giving me the family and life that I have. While I know that I complain day in and day out about how hard it is to be me and to live my life, deep down I know how truly easy I have it and how blessed I am.   I feel very lucky to be me. The three most precious people in my life will join me in celebrating the most wonderful holiday of the year.  The birth of our Lord. Heres to good times, great memories, and an overall beautiful couple of weeks.   2002 is OVAH!

When things turn around and you are happy and care-free and trust in people for who they are...don't forget that they will do shit just to get under your skin anyway.

       Happy 22nd Birthday to KELLY!   I hope you do exactly what you want to do on this beautiful Tuesday.  Enjoy it to the absolute fullest.  You are my best friend and my lover. cept not so much lover.  Damn that pesky twat of yours!  I love you!  DO IT UP DAWG!  Now back to me... :) I don't know why, but I am having the worst day on the planet.  I feel sad, angry, lonely, and just about every other nasty emotion possible in the human body.  I don't get it.  I woke up alive and rested (although I only got 5 hours of sleep) and ready to tackle my shit day.  I am starting to get a headache and I have done nothing to make it go away.  I haven't done even a second of Christmas shopping and we are just about a week away.  I don't want to spend the money and I know that the money I will spend will not be enough for me to do anything really special for my family.  It is a bit frustrating, but not one of the reasons why I am miserable today. Will get to all of this in a minute.  I walked into the Gap last night with my mind made up.  I was giving my two weeks notice and that was that!  So I sit down with my General Manager and this is how the convesation went:  Me:  Hi Kat.  Thank you again for being so supportive and flexible with my schedule over the last week.  I truly appreciate it. Kat:  No problem Joe.  We are here for you as your boss and as your friend. Me:  (gagging) Right.  Um...ok.  Unfortunately, I think Saturday is going to be my last day. Kat:  What??  Why is that? Me:  Well, you see, I am unable to work from 12/23 - 1/3 (BIG NO NO in the seasonal retail world) and then after that, my availability is going to change drastically because I will be rehearsing for an upcoming show.  (or so I thought last night) Kat:  Ok.  Why can't you work during the week after Christmas? Me:  I want to spend the time with my family and my brother.  He is here for two weeks and considering the fact that I haven't seen him in almost a year, I think it would be appropriate for me to spend as much time with him as I can.    Kat:  Well, I understand completely where you are coming from and I would like you to know that we value you immensely as an employee here.  I want you to stay on at least through the season.  Take all the time you need over Christmas and New Years.  I will put you back on the schedule starting on January 3rd. Me:  (UGH!  I can't quit this job to save my life!)  Wow.  That is incredibly generous of you.   Kat:  What would your availability be once you returned on January 3rd? Me:  I have full availability from 1/3 - 1/10, but after that I am only able to work Tuesdays and Wednesdays from 6-11pm and then Saturdays from 12-6pm.  It's not much and I know you hired me for seasonal, but that is what I am going to have to do. Kat:  I think that's fine.  We would rather have you on staff than not, so why don't you write down this new availability and I will work around it. Me:  (UM!)  Ok...thank you so much for being so understanding and helpful.  When does the season end? Kat:  Seasonal employees are hired for about 3 months and then depending on the stores' needs, you may or may not be asked to join us full time.  (meaning part time hours, but full gap employee status)(my biggest nightmare on the planet) Me:  Great.  Then I guess we can meet by the end of January to discuss my future employment here. Kat:  Sounds good to me.  And again Joe, I want you to know that we really do value the work you do here.  It does not go unnoticed. We hug. ----END SCENE----  It is quite clear to me that I am going to be working at the Gap for the rest of my life.  You would think that one fake sick day, one fake death, and then completely changing my availability to suit my needs and my needs alone would be cause enough for a firing.  But no!  These people love me more for it.   Ah geez...on the plus side...I will still be making cash, which is nice.  My last paycheck was for $412 and that looks very nice sitting in my savings account.  :)  My goal is to have $1000 in there before this whole Gap thing is through.   I can't wait to work my last shift there on Saturday.  The 10 days off from both of my jobs is just about the best Christmas present I could ever get. Thank you for being born baby Jeebus.  I had a wonderful conversation with my mother this morning.  She made me laugh pretty hard and she assisted in making this day just a bit better for me.  Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to stop the avalanche that is my personal strength today.   Tumbling and rolling down the mountain goes my optimistic view on life.  Kelly and I had a talk this morning about the show she and Megan are putting up next year.  They are now doing three different shows that will perform at three different times throughout the year.  Originally they were going to start work on a show called   urlLink Stupid Kids  in January.  I did this show in college and it was by FAR my favorite script to work with.  It is a wonderful play, so complex and intriguing.  It's a true audience favorite as well.  I was very VERY excited to come back from Christmas and start work on this.   Unfortunately, Kelly tells me this morning that they have now decided to start work on this show in late April.  They will be doing another show called   urlLink Sexual Perversity in Chicago  first.  Work on this production will begin sometime during the 3rd week of January.   I am very excited for Kelly and Megan and for the fact that they are going in a definite direction with all of this. But I would be lying if I didn't say that I am incredibly disappointed to find out that I will not be working on this with them.   Kelly and I sat down at the beginning of December and discussed, in great detail, a show called "A Bench at the Edge".  Now, while I was not going to be acting  much  in the show, I was still going to be a very big part of the production.  I told her, about two weeks ago, that I was going to be unable to start working on the show until the second week of January due to my schedule being completely filled up with two jobs, Christmas, and a boyfriend moving to New York City.  She didn't seem too keen on waiting for me and has since changed everything with Megan.  I understand why she did what she did, but it does sting a bit. I was really excited.  Kelly sees me as a "consultant" for this new show.  I am more than willing to help in whatever way I can, but through all of this, I have learned that I can't count on anyone else to get me started.   I have to get me started.  I thought that working on this production with Kelly and her friend Megan was a great opportunity for me to dip my foot into the "acting" pool again; a way to feel and experience again what theater is all about before I try to go out and face the big, bad, scary world that is awaiting me.   But this isn't going to happen.   I feel a bit defeated today.   I guess this is what a career in acting is all about anyway.  Nothing is ever a sure thing and ideas get formulated and changed all the time.  It is the actor's responsibility to just go with the flow.   Which is what I will do.  :(  I truly hope that I will be able to get myself into an acting class and production come the new year.  I want 2003 to be a lot different than 2001 and 2002 were.  As I have said a million times previous, it takes one day to change your life.   Maybe January 1st will be this day.   :) It is so hard to stay positive when there are constant curve balls being thrown at you. I know I keep saying how much things are changing around me, but I must say it again: Things are  changing , drastically and fast.    Paul is increasingly more lonely in NYC despite the fact that I am there for him.  I work way too much.   Rita is going through so many new changes and experiences. Kelly is moving forward with her life and career. I am working two jobs that are doing nothing, but making me feel inept and worthless. I am poor. And most importantly, I haven't been genuinely happy in months.  When is rock bottom? How do I know if I have reached it?  I wish I could figure this all out.  I hate being 25.

      So everyone has left work except for my boss and myself.  It is DEAD in our office and there really is no need for us to be here.  Unfortunately, I had to stay because I have to work at the Gap and there is really no need for me to go all the way home, to Paul's or to Ari's to hang out.  Well, I could go to Ari's, but the temptation to smoke pot with her once I am there is way too great.  I'll fall asleep on my face by 9pm if I get all jacked up right now.   :( I want to leave early too! Ah well.... 10 more minutes and I will feebly make my way to the subway and bus.   Have I told you lately how  much  I truly hate the Gap?  Hate.

      NO STRIKE! Thank GOD! sike.  I keep telling myself that so I'm not pissed at all of the hype that has gone on in NYC over the past week.  I mean, did any of us  really  believe that there was going to be a city wide transit strike?  Obviously, we know it's too good to be true.  I reconciled with the idea of no strike on Saturday, so that I wouldn't spend all day yesterday hoping and praying.  I would be lying if I said I didn't immediatly turn on the tv at 12am to see what the deal was.  And of COURSE (!) the strike was delayed.   The only thing that could be worse than NOT having a strike, is having one during the work day.   Either way we gotta stay at work and then...how do we get home?? Harumph!  Friday night, Paul and I went to Ian's soiree!  It was a really great time.  Actually, I'm a bit surprised at how much fun he and I had there.  We didn't know many people, but both of us were able to make conversation very easily and everyone wanted to know our entire life story.  We must have told how we met and fell in love about 36 times that evening.  It was fun having everyone be interested in the reasons of why Joe and Paul are now living in NYC together.  It was the first time in, well...maybe forever, that Paul and I were an actual TEAM.  We drank some beers, ate some holiday cookies, and found our first gay couple to go on dates with!   Ian and his boyfriend David are just about the best.  Paul was anti-Ian before the party, but 30 minutes into it and he was pulling me aside and telling me how great he thinks Ian really is.  Ian's boyfriend, David, was pretty incredible too.  He and Paul got along famously as Ian and I gossiped like two bitties in the corner.  We made plans to get together after New Year's for dinner or a show or something.   How neat.  After the party, Paul and I jetted down to the restaurant that Kelly works at.  It was beautiful!  I really loved the style of the place.  It was very warm and I thoroughly enjoyed being there.  Kelly was busy counting out her tips and closing up, but we were able to talk to her for a bit.  Paul and I had some very interesting and intense conversation while we were there.  I tried to explain the reality of "depression" to him as he sat there and told me that he has "depression" too.  It was rough going for a bit, but I think I got my point across.  Eventually he was able to listen to what I was saying without trying to compare and compete with me. You see, with a lot of gay relationships, there is this unnecessary desire to turn everything into competition.  I think it is based on jealousy, but that could be just my scenario.  It tends to be somewhat difficult to have two people of the same sex share friends, make different salaries, etc.  Sometimes things just become a big game of who is better than who... Paul tends to do this with me alot. If I say I struggle with depression, Paul says that he "has depression too" because he "gets sad alot". Ugh. If I say that I am working a lot this week, Paul says that he has "worked his ass off for the last 4 years". And so on and so forth... I am really tring to break him of this habit, but it is hard.  I find myself choosing my words very carefully as to avoid any sort of argument as to who is the stronger individual.  I have decided that I am putting my two weeks in at the Gap.  At least I THINK that is what I have decided.  I was on the subway this morning, analyzing my plan of attack.  I was told yesterday that if we don't work the week of Christmas, we will be scheduled on New Year's Eve and New Year's day as stock people.  We would get paid time and a half, but really...is it worth it? never. I think I am going to tell them that this satruday is my last day.  Essentially it is two week's notice, cuz I have all next week off due to Christmas and my brother coming home.   But I don't necessarily want to leave permanently.  I really wish I could work 2 or 3 shifts a week there.  But at this point, that is impossible.  Besides, I am VERY excited to get to work on the play that Kelly and her friend Megan are putting together. (Oh yeah...Kelly and her friend Megan are putting together another show.) And they want me to be a part of it.  YAY! I will miss the people that I work with.  They are all so totally nice and appreciative of me.  If the job wasn't such dook... And more importantly, if my schedule wasn't such hell.   Aw well.  LATAS GAP! It was good for the 6 weeks it lasted. Luckily I work this Saturday at 6am.  They will kick me right in the nuts as I leave...  Tomorrow is Kelly's 22nd birthday!  And also my friend Randy's!  HAPPY BIRTHDAY GIRLS! Kelly and Rita are planning on having some food and drinks.  I wish I could be there, but I knew going into this week that it was going to be completely impossible.  Unfortunately, I am off Wed. and Thursday of this week.  The only woman that could have switched shifts with me  told me that she doesn't work after 10pm and since I work till 12am that night, it's a no go.   Kelly and I had a talk about it last week, so at least I know she won't hate me for not being around.   Whatevs Kel!  We will go to the Power Company on Christmas night to celebrate!  WHOO HOO!    Paul and I watched  urlLink The Laramie Project  last night.  We had been wanting to see it for months and we finally just rented it.  I must admit that it wasn't what I thought it was going to be.  As far as content goes, it was a beautifully written and emotionally powerful movie. As far as a movie goes, I was left wanting a bit more.  I got a bit tired at the end and started to fade out rapidly.  But maybe that was because I worked an 11 hour shift yesterday.   I was extremely moved by particular scenes of the movie and I do recommend that everyone on the planet see it at some point. If you have any problem understanding the difference between straight people and gay people, this movie will make the message clear. THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE. Please see this movie.  Ok...one of my gay internet friends wants to talk... Must go stare at his beautiful body for awhile. :-D hahahahahahahahahahahaha but also no ha's.    ha.

      FRIDAY! FRIDAY! FRIDAY! WHOOOOOOOOO! I just ate my breakfast and now I am counting the minutes until this office closes.   Last night's dinner at Cafe Orlin started out a bit rough, but ended up being a fantastic good time.  I bit Paul's head off at one point and then he ripped my nuts off and then we both sat there bleeding for about an hour.  I told him to "just go home" during one of his little "bitch at Joe" sessions and then he almost did.  The rest of the night, no matter what I said or did, had no affect on Paul "Sally Sad Pants".  He was pissed off.  He was quiet and he obviously just wanted to be left alone.  It was rather frustrating. Cuz really... Get the fuck over it. I find myself constantly biting my tongue at the things he says and I just "get over it".   I think we may be spending too much time together.  We will have a little break this weekend.  He is going out with friends of his on Saturday night and I am hanging out with Miss Reets.  We may either go to a party on Long Island or we may stay in and watch movies or maybe we will fuck the shit out of eachother. without condoms. um. I don't know.  Don't ask me why that just came out of my fingertips, but it did.  Tonight Paul and I are going to Ian's party for a bit.  Then we will go to where Kelly works and have a drink.  Then we will probably go out to some gay place and grind on eachother for a couple of hours.  Sweaty, drunken, fun. Okay never. I'm lucky if we even kiss eachother goodnight at this point.  SO! Have we all seen the new plans for the NEW YORK CITY 9/11 rebuilding? If you haven't seen a picture of what they plan to do, you are going to die of shock!  They want to build a beach that sits on the edge of the east village.  They also want to put up an ice rink, all of these crazy shops, 10,000 new apartments, and best of all.......a floating meadow. Now what IS a floating meadow, you ask?  Well you see, it's a huge plot of grassy land that will be towed by boat around the island.  My understanding is that you go onto the floating meadow to have a nice picnic lunch, then sit on it as you go floating by the entire outling edge of the city.   IT'S SO WEIRD!  And so COOL! I want a floating meadow to drive me to work. Magine? Ok...I just got some pretty great news.   As it is, I have off the entire week of Christmas from work.  I also have New Year's Eve and New Year's Day off from work as well. And now the piece de resistance is that I have off 12/30 too!  That means I have 9 days off from work!  That is more than I had off during my vacation to Florida this summer.  What is this place?  The best?! So many days...so many days... I really can't wait until the 23rd hits.  What a fucking great holiday it's going to be this year.   I think it's fair for me to have a good Christmas, considering that Thanksgiving was a complete wash.    Good times, great tastes.  I had such a great time hanging out with Rita and Kelly last night.  I miss them tremendously.  I got kinda drunk and actually was the only one who was that way.  The rest of them were pretty sober and I was stumbling around like a mad man.  It's kinda fun to be that way once in awhile.   So, we are hastily making preparations for our transit strike! YAY! Can we PLEASE have more days off???? At this rate, I NEVER have to go to work. We will all find out on Sunday night (monday morning) at 12am if don't have to go to work. Please please please please.  Please and carrots. Alrighty.  I'm out! Have a great weekend everyone! Hopefully I won't see you here on Monday morning!

      It's THURSDAY!   I don't have to be back at the Gap until Sunday.  I will be mourning the loss of my uncle until that day.   Man, I am a scumbag in it's truest form. But a scumbag that doesn't have to work!  Every morning when I come in, my boss has to come out, prop himself on my desk and instigate some increasingly stupid bantar about how I must be so tired working two jobs and living the life of a 25 year old.  He is rather annoying and if the bitch doesn't leave me alone soon, I swear I am going to blow.  How many times can I tell him: "Yes, Teef, I am EXHAUSTED (even when I'm not) and so ready for the weekend."  "Oh yes Teef, it's just one more week till Christmas.  I know, I can't wait either."  Fucking snore!   Can you just stay in your office and act like a boss?  Or at least like a guy who has some sort of work to do?  Next topic...  Paul has been living here for exactly 10 days now.  In those 10 days, we have "hooked up" once; the night he got here. It's starting to worry me a bit.   Yes, I am gone most of the time, at one job or another, but is this really the reason why we aren't physical with eachother? Over the last week I seem to have developed a horrible body image.   See, while Paul doesn't have the body that I desire, I CERTAINLY do not have the body he desires, and it is becoming increasingly more obvious to me.   He is nice to me and all and it's not like he calls me "blobby" or "fats Mcfats", but at the same time, his body is better than mine and suddenly I am feeling really horrible about the way I look naked.  I am sure that I am doing this to myself.   I have a tendency to beat myself up over things that are totally inconsequential.   I don't know. Either way, I feel shitty about the stomach, ass, and thighs issue.  Why don't I just grow a fucking vagina already? I think it may be time for me to really start eating a bit healthier.  Smaller portions, less grease, not late at night, etc. I am 25 years old and I am tired of having a blah body.  I want to have a hot body.  I want to feel healthy and feel confident when I take my shirt off.  These are things that everyone probably wants, but it's time for me to stop my complaining and just take care of it.  Then maybe if I do, Paul will start to build up his bod a bit.   At least one can hope. If not, I will body slam him.   Cuz by then I will be big and buff. So I wonder why Paul and I haven't been affectionate.  Last night the reason was because I was a fat ass. Two days ago it was because he just didn't like me anymore. Tomorrow it will probably be because I have black shoes with buckles on.  As I was falling asleep last night, I was thinking about how many guys I have hooked up with.   As we all know, I am a virgin when it comes to the anal penetration, but dick sucking...yikes. I counted 8 different guys.  There was one more guy, but I just played with his cock and balls a bit.    :) I keep saying that I don't want to commit to Paul completely because I need to experience other guys.   But really?  Aren't 8 dicks in my mouth enough?  Isn't it time for me to TRY to block out all of my other sexual conquests?   I am confused.  When you are in love, are you to never have other thoughts? No, that's foolish. Of course you have other thoughts. But should you go looking and pursuing these other thoughts? Cuz I do and usually on a daily basis.   When is it all going to click?  On Tuesday night, when Paul and I were having our "serious talks", one of the biggest topics we discussed was our fear of this relationship not working out the way we thought it would. For one, he is afraid that once we have sex, he will realize that he is a bottom.  This is a BIG fear of mine too, cuz although I have yet to have a dick in my ass, I KNOW that I want to be the receiver.  Paul asked how I know and I couldn't explain it coherently, except to say that when I jerk off and think about having sex, I am always getting it in the ass. Paul seems to think that he is versatile.  He wants to give and receive.  He also seems to think that I am going to love sticking it in and will eventually become a top and bottom (versatile like him). But that will never happen and I know it. So the problem here lies in the fact that if we are both bottoms, all we will be able to do sexually is slam our asses against eachother. Hmmmm.... This problem leads into MY biggest fear about our relationship...  I am so nervous that we are going to figure out that we are extremely intense best friends, but that that is as far as it will ever go.  How do you know the difference between love and sex?  How do you know when the two just aren't working together in a beautiful cohesive manner? Paul isn't as worried as I am about us figuring out that we are just friends.   He thinks that, mostly, because he is secure in how he feels about me. I am secure in where our relationship is  now .   But that is about it. I can't predict the future or how our lives will be after sex.  S:Dhjif :LKSDJ F:SDKLHJGDL:KH!!!!!!!!  I have no idea.  Everything is changing around me and I can't control any of it.  I have major control issues and I am finding that as life goes on, there are fewer and fewer things in my life that I have control over. I hate curve balls. I hate anything I don't understand. I hate not being able to live my life the way I want to live it.  I guess I am going to have to learn how to deal with this. But I am not ready. Not yet.  What do I want? I want my friends to be chill. I want my boyfriend to want me and love me the way I always thought my boyfriend would. I want my parents to let me live my life at my own pace. I want my brother to leave the ARMY. I want to get my act together in all areas of my life, not just those that are work related. I want to live a healthier existence. And most of all... I just want to be understood and in turn, be happy. But really...is any of this possible?  Maybe?  Maybe.

      Paul and I went to "Tom's Restaurant" (of Seinfeld fame) for lunch.  I always get the open grilled cheese sandwich, but today decided to try the chicken souvlaki.  Cuz I LOVE me some chicks and souvlaks.  However, it was the nastiest thing I have ever had.  The chicken looked like Pimento loaf and it was served with honey mustard. Honey mustard?!?!?! oh yeah Tom, VERY Greek. In any case, I ate as much as I could and watch Paul HOUSE his chicken salad salad.  No really, that's what it was called. He had chicken salad on a salad. Sick. But he ate every bite. As I was walking back to my building I looked back to see if he was still looking at me and I noticed that he was.  We kept looking back at eachother over and over until he disappeared behind the local food mart. It was all very sappy and annoying. And I loved every second of it. Only 6 more hours until I get to go back to bed. Thank the goodness of the Lord.

      Ugh. Wednesdays are such shit.  Once Thursday hits, the week gets SO much better.  I know we all feel this way.  However, today is making me want to run far far away.  I just want the day to be over.  I wish I could fast forward until 12am when I will be warm and happy in bed. But alas... Paul and I had happy hour at his apartment last night.  I picked up some wine on the way over and we talked and drank until about 7:30pm and then got dressed in our prettiest and went over to Beige to have a couple of drinks.  I felt so NY when I was with him last night.  Big and tough Paul was showing quite a few signs of insecurity and that made me feel as though he is finally understanding how hard it is to live in NYC.  Visiting is one thing, staying here is totally another.   But alas... Ok, can I stop with the "but alas" shit? Usually, Paul and I don't function well at gay bars together.  He tends to be a bit overprotective of me and he gets all crazy sometimes.  Last night was not this way.  Last night, we just talked and talked until both of our mouths were ripping off at the hinges.  I mean, we covered everything from losing our virginity to eachother, to what secrets we have that no one knows about. (there is still one I haven't told him, no matter how much he begged)   I am sure he has a few skeletons in his closet.  And also some gay spiders too. I do have to say that Paul surprised me with some great shit last night.   He only buys milk and orange juice for his pad.  He doesn't believe in Kool-Aid or Iced Tea or soda.  But that's all I drink.  So last night I come home to find a box of Kool-Aid Koolers in the fridge.  I didn't have the heart to tell him that I am not really a fan of sugar pouches, no matter how much the company decorates the product, but I chugged down three of them in 5 minutes anyway.  He also bought me an Arizona Iced Tea, which was pretty sweet of him. Then, the coup de resistance, he rented a movie called  L.I.E. , which I have been dying to see.  How did he know to get that?  I had never mentioned it to him before. It was random and so wonderful. I told him that he shocks me with how incredible he is every single day. We did spend alot of the night in heated discussion about one thing or another. But unlike the past, we get over any argument in about 5 minutes and are back to being happy with eachother. It was never like that before.  There was always one of us threatening the other person with some sort of bullshit.  But now, we just get over it and try our damndest to make attempts at being mature, responsible adults. Overall, I had a very nice time with Paul last night. I am waiting for him to come up to my work to take me to lunch now.  I want grilled cheese, but I know he is going to make me get a salad. Fine. I like salad with tons of BLUE CHEESE on it!   HAHAHAHAHAHA and also boh. While I was on the subway last night, going to his apartment, I had my headphones on and wasn't really paying attention to what was going on around me. Suddenly, this man with no legs...and I mean NO legs, not even stumps, goes scooting by in front of me jingling a cup and asking for change.  I was like "WHA?", cuz I mean, NO LEGS!   I gave him the change I had in my pocket and then I lowered my head to either laugh or cry.  I don't know.  Kelly and Rita have decorated our apartment all Christmasy!  Is Christmasy spelled Christmassy? Thats weird looking. So, Kelly and Rita have decorated our apartment all Christmasy and I get to see it tomorrow night. We are going out to dinner with Paul as well, to celebrate the holidays.  Kelly has picked a place called "Cafe Orlin" and I am much excited to go and have a wonderful dinner with friends.   Hopefully Kelly will sexy dance for our waitress. Give her a bottle of wine and I think that is a guarantee... Tonight I work at the Gap.  I have to walk in with a very sad face on.  I really hate having to go and it has been so nice to have the past two days off.  It felt like I had a life again!   Ah well... I am off Thursday-Saturday, so that will be nice. I am supposed to go to a party at this kid Ian's house on Friday, but Paul is not a huge fan of him.  Probably cuz I sucked Ian's dick last summer. I mean really Paul...can't you just get over it already? Paul and I had a really long talk about him and he is finally willing to get to know him a bit better.  We will go to the party from 10-11pm and then we run away as fast as we can. Ian has a roommate named "Will" who is probably one of the worst people ever.  He's just gross gay.  You know how that goes. Will will be all over me until the minute I leave the party.  Paul will probably punch Will in the face by the end of the first round of drinks.   Snores. Alright, Paul is finally here for our lunch date.  YUM! I don't know what I should eat first... His dick or my grilled cheese. maybe both at the same time. SLURP!

      So Paul and I are hanging out alone tonight.  We are going to Beige for some drinks.  But not until we have watched the SIMPSONS together.  How fun!  I haven't seen the Simpsons in about 3 years.  Tonight is the test to see how Paul and I do at a gay bar alone.  Usually we aren't so good.  I have the "roving eye" and he plays the part of "bitter jealous boyfriend".   Will definitely check in here tomorrow to report on the nights' happenings. PEAYCE!

      I just had the most adorable break. I had nothing to do today, so I walked around our building trying to find somewhere to rest my eyes.  Every single room was occupied, so I went down to the spot that I have been using for the last couple of days. There is a little room next to the front desk that has some chairs, blankets, and pillows set up.  When I sleep there, Pedro, the front door man, lets me go in there and use the space.  Today he wanted to sleep in there too.  So, I tell him to sleep next to me.   The two of us laid there, next to eachother sleeping.  It was so cute.  But, I have to admit that it was like sleeping next to a full grown papa bear.  There was gurgling, choking, and some kind of wheezing that I am SURE isn't normal coming from a 40 year old man.   But who knows.  He was very tired. I also should point out that one of my co-workers, who is a female but has been called "androgenous" on numerous occassions, now has the same exact Gap sweater that I have.   She wore hers yesterday and I am wearing mine today. If she is half a woman and I am half a woman and we are both wearing the sweater on the same day, does that make us one full woman?  HOT!

      I think this has been the longest I have ever gone without writing.  I have been inundated with life's bullshit and I had a hard time making my way back to this poor lil' journal of mine.   But here I am, back and with a smile on my face. :-D            Where to begin.... hmmmmm...... Paul moved back to Boston.  Things just didn't work out.  He and I found ourselves fighting non-stop, so he cancelled his lease and moved back.  It was such a waste of a trip. hahaha.  imagine?  Quite the contrary.  Things between he and I are going so well and I have never been happier in our relationship.  Being around eachother so much has enabled us to really get to know eachother better.  Or at least, get to know our relationship better.  I am not as much of a bitch as I used to be, I have so much more kindness and patience with him now that I know that I can see him whenever I want, AND most importantly...my love for him grows stronger with each word that comes out of his mouth. Overall we are much nicer to eachother.  He says stupid shit, but then APOLOGIZES for it.  In turn, I accept the apology and keep my smart ass retorts to myself.  Well, sometimes I let a few slip out, but he handles them better now knowing that there are only a  few .  He misses me when I am gone during the day.  He calls more.  It's just SO MUCH BETTER for our relationship now that he lives in NYC.   I told him this morning, that I might not stay there tonight (for reasons which I will explain in a minute) and he was like "Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?"  And I said: "Cuz I want to".  And he gave me sad face until I left to go to work.   Who replaced my old Paul with this wonderfully sweet person?   I love him. I was supposed to work last night.  But you see...what happened was..... I told them that my uncle died yesterday.  (um!)  I know.  But I did.  I was supposed to work a shift this Friday night from 10pm-7am and I just REALLY didn't want to do it.  It kills my whole weekend.  AGAIN!  And it's CHRISTMAS TIME!  AND I HATE THE GAP! Anyway, since the "funeral" is on Friday, I can't work the shift.  They were INCREDIBLY understanding and told me to take last night off too.  I got back to Paul's place around 7pm and we had a "toasted almond" and then went to a sushi restaurant.   Ok...Joe CuttheShit doesn't go out for sushi.  Joe CuttheShit goes out for McDonald's  only .  But I went and I tried so many new things and guess what???  I LOVED IT!  I had California Rolls (which I knew I liked thanks to Rita) and also I had Philadelphia Maki and Alaskan Maki.  Now I know that these are probably the most generic sushi items that you can get, but I still ate them and loved it!  They had cream cheese in them for Pete's sake!  I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.   Asian people are pretty nice too. They smile and work fast.   haha. sike. hmmmm.... sorta sike. Paul's roommate, Lisa, went with us and that was interesting.  She is a very unique individual.  And I don't mean that in a nice way.  She's kind of hard to talk to.  I mean, she is fine...but definitely gives me some pause.  I don't know...it might take time before I fully understand what she is all about.  Paul's other roommate, Jen, is unique as well, although "unique" in a way that Lisa is not.  But still not in an overly good way.   Do you understand what I am trying to say? Lisa and Jen are not the devils of doom, but they are definitely not the angels of fun.  Hmmm... I am being very vague about them, but that's because I feel like it's not right for me to judge them yet.   Once I get to know them better I will give a little more detail.   Or at least judge them a little more critically. hee. After Sushi dinner, Paul took me over to   urlLink Pommes Frites  and I chowed down on some MAJOR FRIES!  I got a "double" and here are the dipping sauces that Paul and I shoved into our mouths:  Cheddar Cheese, Ketchup, Tartar Sauce (Paul's horrible pick), Blue Cheese (my wonderful pick), and the best of all Rosemary Garlic Mayo! ----->  that one was jizzmatic.   The double size is enormous, but I had no problem fitting in all in my stomach.  Even after 15 maki rolls.   And the best part about this wonderful restaurant is that it is right around the block from Paul's apartment!  ROCK! It was quite a wonderful evening.  Well, except for the fact that we watched  Death to Smoochy , which sucked my asshole dry.   I was in bed by 12am and HAPPILY got to sleep for 8 hours! I have to call the Gap in a little bit and feel it out.  If they tell me to take another night off to "get myself emotionally together" then I totally will!  YAY! I think I was most impressed with the fact that literal tears rolled down my face while I talked to my manager last night.  Told you I was a good actor.  The gift is still there, even if a little rusty.   Last Wednesday night, Kelly, Rita, Paul and I went out for drinks and had plans to go see the Christmas Tree lighting at Rockefeller.  Well, of COURSE by the time we were going to get our drunk asses over there, the roads were all blocked off and we just went home.  We had fun any way and Kelly "sexy danced" her night away. No, I'm not kidding.  While acting out our craziness at my apartment, in Queens, Kelly sexy danced in her bra and jeans for at least an hour and a half.  She was grinding my leg, the frame to my bedroom door, and Paul until the wee hours of the morning.  In between grinding, Kelly would go tearing through the house attacking me from every angle.  At one point, she took her nails and dragged them down my neck in typical Freddy Krueger style.  Although painful, I laughed my ASS off all night long.   It was amazing fun.   What else big happened? OH! On Friday night, Paul, Rita, Mariah and I hung out and had a buh buh buh blast!  We were supposed to go the West Village, but ended up at  Cedars , this cute hole in the wall for french fries and drinks.  Hanging out with Mariah is always amazing.  She and I were able to jam out to the Justin Timberlake CD for hours and that is just about my favorite thing to do.  Mariah and I always put in our favorite cd and then try to teach eachother new parts to the song, although Mariah is much better at it than I am.  She discovers hidden riffs everywhere and I always stand there sheepish. Paul actually didn't drink much that night and was sober by 2am.  I, on the other hand, was buh buh blasted and kept him up until 4:30am with my incessant rambling.  At one point, he told me that I always have to be the "life of the party" and that I "don't give anyone else a chance to have the spotlight".  That hurt my feelings a bit and I thought about it all day on Saturday.  When I got home that night, I apologized to him for doing that and he said that he was sorry for making me feel bad about it. Paul is not totally right in what he said, but he does have a point.  I need to take the step back sometimes.  I don't need to be in control of everything.  It's hard not to act like that. I don't know. I'm not ready to deal with it yet. so i run away. but with my spotlight off and my mouth closed. I will be better. Okay, I have to go play now.  I have spent too much time writing diligently in my journal.   Time to go partake in some sexy talk online. Then off to have a cigarette, roll with butter, and vitamin water. Then write in here again. Then lunch. Then sexy talk until I spend the last hour of my day doing actual work. mmmmm....sexy talk. Promise not to take such a long hiatus next time. Promise with my entire nut sack.

      SO! It is Wednesday.  Fuck yeah.  I don't have to work tonight, I don't have to work tonight.  The minute I walked out of the Gap last night, my heart jumped in my chest and I felt ALIVE again!  Not having to go back until tomorrow night.  Amazing.  I could sit in my bedroom and stare at the wall all night and I would still feel just as happy not to have to work a 15 hour day.  Everyone said that I would really start to value my free time and wasn't that the truth.  I have about 2 hours a day to do what I want to do.  These hours are always between 12-2am.  While not the best time of day to put in a movie or read a book, just being able to sit and talk with someone is usually more than good enough.   Paul and I were talking last night about how little I have actually seen him since he moved in.  Although I haven't been home since Sunday, the only thing that is really different since Paul's move, is where I lay my head at night.  He understands that I have to work as much as I do, as most of my friends do, but at the same time I know he is a bit disappointed that I am not around to play with.  Both figuratively and literally. We made a "date" for Saturday night.  Of course I have to work all fucking day, but I get off at 8pm and we are going to go on the first of what I hope is many dates.  Probably dinner and a movie.  Maybe we will try to get some  RENT  tickets for that night.  Who knows, just as long as I get to hang out with him for more than an hour before I have to rush my ass to bed.  While not seeing him enough is rather disheartening, just being able to sleep in bed with him every night is making my life so much happier.  It's no fun working 70 hours a week, but when you know that you are going to be able to crawl into bed with your boyfriend that night, the day just seems to have a coating of "good" all over it.  That "coating" is jizz.   I hope you realize that. You do realize that.   Slurp. OMIGOD!  Everyone I work with is at a Board Meeting and since they have left, this place has been nothing short of a living nightmare.  The phone is going crazy and I am about ready to rip someone's cunt off.  Specifically this one bitch who keeps calling our office over and over and over and over.  Fucking bitch!  You see, I call her a bitch, cuz she is a secretary that is telling me to do something that HER boss wants HER to do.  Whatever, long story and too annoying to get into.  This lady sucks my cock. Okay...vented and got that shit out. Our housekeeper broke her front tooth last night on a piece of rice.  There is a huge gaping hole in her mouth.  I could tell she was upset this morning.  Then she showed me the space in between her teeth and my heart smashed into a million pieces.  Poor thing. Paul is going food shopping today, thank GOD!  Paul's roommate, Jen, brought down a HUGE cooked ham with her.  Don't ask why...it's a tad random that her mom made a Thanksgiving feast and then made a 20lb ham to bring to NYC.  But whatever... So we have been eating nothing, but ham sandwiches, grilled ham, plain ham, ham with water, etc.  I must admit that it is the best ham I have ever had, but ere'day?  Too much ham for this boy.  I won't be having any more until Easter.   Great, I can hear the elevator coming.  Let it be an asshole...let it be an asshole...I am so ready to punch someone in their ugly face right now. Tonight I have to stop by  Mama Mia  to get tickets for my mom.  Every year she buys tickets to a show for my parents, my grandmother, and me.  This year we tried to get  Into the Woods  tickets, but the show is closing.  I was VERY disappointed.  So  Mama Mia  it is.  That's fine.  Not my first pick, but who am I to complain?  After I pick up the tickets, Paul and I are meeting up with Rita and Kelly to see the Christmas Tree lighting in Rockefellar Center.  Paul thinks it's the dumbest idea on the planet and was even more irate about us not going to a gay bar for drinks, but I laid the smack down on this event.  He can suck it up and go.  And he better LOVE it or no dick action for him tonight. Is it wrong that I am most excited for bed tonight than anything else?  Is it possible that I am going to have 7 or 8 hours of sleep tonight???  ROCK!  I am so used to laying my head down for 4 hours and then getting up as though I never laid down to begin with.  And I get to have drinks tonight too!  That NEVER happens.  AND AND AND I GET TO BE IN MY OWN BED IN MY OWN APARTMENT.  YES! Sorry these entries have been so mundane these days...but when your head buzzes all day long from lack of sleep this is the writing that spews forth.  The writing will become a lot more interesting once the end of January comes and I get some sleep. Until then, bear with my text-bookish entries.   I gotta go talk to Mariah now.

      As of this moment, my bosses are deciding whether or not to close our building due to the fact that it is about 60 degrees in here.  The heat is busted and we are all walking around in jackets, gloves, hats, and the such.  It's quite awful.  My fingers are killing me.  I am convinced that if I type too fast, one of my digits is going to snap right at the keyboard.  No blood will come out, cuz obviously that froze hours ago.  The Gap went very well last night.  They put me on cash register AGAIN!  I told them that I wanted to be on the floor because I fucked up so much on Sunday night.  They were like: "But we want you to be on register."  I agreed with major hesitation and then suddenly I was register genius!  I didn't have any voids and I was breezing through each transaction.  At one point, a manager comes up to me and says: "Joe, cancel that transaction right now".  I thought I was in trouble for something.  As I go to ask him what the problem is, he says: "Miss, you have been banned from the store on numerous occassions.  Leave now."  She flipped out claiming that she didn't do anything wrong and eventually the security guard grabbed her by the arm and dragged her out of the building. It was quite exciting.   I got to Paul's apartment at about 12:30am and was unpleasantly surprised to find out that he was not there.  I started to get a bit frustrated with him because it is so typical for him to be more concerned about going out for drinks than it is for him to make sure that I could depend on him.   Luckily I found him in a bar down the street.  Don't ask me how I knew he was there, I just did.  I walked in and without screaming and yelling, told him that I thought he was completely undependable and that I needed the keys  now .  He gave them to me and said something about loving me, but I was already out the door by that point.   As I was getting my clothes ready for the next day, he came home and apologized and gave me the biggest, longest hug.  I explained, very calmly, that I need him to be responsible when it comes to circumstances that are out of my control, but still affect me.  I think he got the point, but with Paul you never know.   We stayed up talking and laughing until about 2am and then I just had to go to bed.  As we were falling asleep, he said "I love you" (he said it first again!) and then he combed his fingers through my hair until I went to sleep.  When I woke up in the middle of the night he was reasting his hand on the top of my head.  It was incredibly romantic and sweet.  The 5 hours I spent with Paul yesterday (although all of them spent sleeping) was the best part of my whole day.   I am so happy he's here. Tomorrow night, he and I are meeting up with Kelly and Rita for drinks and then we are heading over to Rockefellar Center to see the lighting of the big Christmas Tree.  It is nice to do NY'ish things once in a while.  I am THRILLED to have the night off from the Gap.  I am actually staying at my house in Queens for the night.  It was like pulling teeth to get Paul to agree to stay there instead of in the village.  He doesn't see why we should ever go to Queens.   He will learn his lesson.  I just want to give him a couple days before I start laying on the guilt that I have an apartment that I love too.  We will see. So cold...... so cold. Getting ready to go into my boss's office to tell him that I am calling it quits for the day. Cuz really...........................BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIITTTTTTTTTTTTTO! yum. I am doing my absolute best to quit biting my fingernails.  I actually have some white on the tips of the nails now.  It's pretty great.  The only thing is that dirt gets under them and then I have to eat it.  I want to have some salt and ketchup with my fingernail dirt.   Some nice garlic, or rosemary...  :-O***  I guess that's it for today.  It's so freezing that my nuts have suctioned up into my body.  They are gone now.  Hibernating, I suppose. Time for me to go do the same...

      Gosh.  What do I talk about first?  So many things have happened today that I think I have to list them in order to make sure that I cover all of it.  Here is my list:  1)  Today I was informed that a student at my job knows that I keep this blog.  I don't know how much he is reading and I don't know what to do.  Yes, this is a public blog, but I write things in here that I would never want made "public".  At least to my co-workers.  So I am nervous about it and as I type in here tonight I feel as though I am being watched.  Truth be told, the kid who knows about this blogger is seemingly very nice and respectable.  I don't think that he would expose this site.  And I don't think that I should have any cause to worry.  But I do.  This is MY journal and I have put a lot of effort into it and I don't want to ever have to explain myself when it comes to things I have written.  Should I shut it down?  2)  I spoke with my dad today, after not talking to him since New Year's.  The longer I waited to call him, the more nervous and anxious I became.  It was weird.  My dad and I are very close, but he has said to me in the past:  "I need you to give me 20 minutes of your week.  Every week."  And he's right.  We should ALL have 20 minutes available, every week, for the people we love.  I always get wrapped up in my dramatic bullshit that the days go by and I realize I have missed another phone call with my father.  This man is my heart.  I cherish his every being.  I am very hard on him and I go through the day acting as though I am tough and "am embarrassed about everything he does", but when it comes down to it, I just love the man.  He is  very tough on me.  Not in the way you would think.  Truth is, he just wants the absolute best for me.  The man truly believes that I have achievable dreams.  He knows that acting is for me.  He just wants me to prove it to myself.  But damn that's a lot of pressure.  Having someone believe in you more than you believe in yourself...AND they're your father?  Shit.  Sometimes the love I have for him makes me implode with nervous vomit.  I think you understand.  3) public blog public blog public blog  4)  I have to change the link to my website soon.  5)  Yesterday for lunch I had an apple (granny smith, the only apple that can be deemed 'edible'") and a wheat roll with nothing on it.  Pretty healthy, eh?  Well today, we had free pizza at work and my yogurt and apple idea went down the tubes pretty quickly.  You see, I can do it.  I can be healthy.  But when I am told that there is free pizza and I don't have to pay $2.50 for organic bullshit, do I say no?  Do I spend the money on yogurt and granny's when I can just eat the pizza for free?  FOR REAL NOW.  Why does dieting cost so much more money that eating garbage?  My point is:  OKAY FINE!  I WILL EAT HEALTHY!  But why the FUCK do I have to go broke doing it?  Does the government want us to be obese?  All of the newspapers say that "America is getting fatter!"  ARE WE SERIOUS?  It costs MORE money to buy an apple and wheat roll than it does to buy a slice of pizza.  Sure, water is free.  But god forbid you want to drink a bottle of cranberry juice as a change up.  That shit costs like $40!  I mean, come on.  I am willing to get into shape and all, but bitch gotta live.  6)  I think I might have a nervous breakdown when Rita leaves and Kelly and I move into Manhatten.  7)  Paul and I had the most wonderful and horrible argument last night.  You see, I wanted to go out to dinner and not eat "shepard's pie".  (The dinner he prepared the night before.  Yes, I know.  Peasant food.)  Paul could eat it every day.  hm.  I offered to pay for us to eat a sushi dinner (his favorite), but that I would need to borrow $10 until Friday cuz I didn't have enough cash.  But NOTE...I  offered to PAY.  Also don't forget that during my work day I offered to meet him at "The Food Emporium" to buy groceries.  I was trying to be NICE and AGREEABLE.  When I mentioned the idea of borrowing money from him, he said "No!  You will go to an ATM cuz you never pay me back and you spend all of my money."  (When I relayed this to Rita tonight she screamed back: "There is DOCUMENTED PROOF that you have gone dutch since he's been in NY!"  And she's right)  I told him that I couldn't believe that I had to spend $1.50 on an ATM to get cash when he had it sitting right on his dresser  (I don't know how to spell dresser)  We fought big time and eventually I just told him the truth.  "I'm not happy in this relationship.  I think you are mean to me and cut me down.  I think that you take everything that bothers you out on ME and I am tired of spending my nights that way.  Something needs to change now.  You moving here or not.  I don't want to be around you anymore."  Paul responds with:  "Then get out!" Don't worry.  Joe responds with a witty and intelligent and pinning him to the wall argument that he cannot deny.  Paul gets nervous when he knows he's wrong and all he can say is: "I don't want to talk about this right now" or "just go home then.  If you don't love me, go home."  That old story.  Bitch, we been together three years.  Be a man and talk serious with your boyfriend.  After much debate I do believe that Paul heard me and that he will see the difference between the good way to treat people you love and the bad way to treat people you love.  If he doesn't learn the difference, then he will be spending alot of time alone.  Thinking.  8)  "The Bachlertette"...OMIGOD HOW DO YOU SPELL BACHLORETTE?  AAAAGH!  I HATE THE SHOW AND EVEN MORE SO I HATE THE SPELLING OF THE NAME!    boof.  9)  Today, Kelly told the landlord that we were moving.  She's got balls, that one does.  I am so thankful that she took care of that and that we can all focus on just moving. From what I hear, Pintu, our landslords, told Kelly that he would lower the rent in order for us to stay.  UM!??!?!?!  I mean, we should have "moved" MONTHS ago!  For the love.   In any case, we don't have to pay this month's rent cuz our security covers it and there, my friends, is my security deposit for my new apartment.  A WHOPPING $670!  Yeah!  That FLIES in Manhatten.  Oh boy.  10)  I still love having my computer in my room.    Now I gotta go.    There's a dildo calling my name. SIKE! (of course....sorta sike)

      I guess the weekend is officially over now.  I am back sitting at my desk and wondering how it is possible that the last 3 days have flown by as quickly as they did.  Oh well.  Back to my humdrum existence of answering phones and talking to students.  God I hate my life.   The weekend was pretty great.  Kelly and I ended up staying awake until about 6am on Saturday night.  Just talking and smoking cigarettes and hanging out.  It was nice.    Sunday night, Mariah, her roommate Rachel, Kelly, Paul and I all went over to the Boiler Room for drinks and talks.  Despite Rachel's past attitude problems and the fact that she wanted to leave from the moment she got there, the time spent with her was pretty ok.  She didn't bother anyone and I even laughed at some of the shit that came out of her mouth.  Mariah was a gem all night and I definitely wished that Rachel had stayed home so that Mariah could have spent more time with us.  Kelly, Paul, and I head over to Urge for one final drink before going home.  Paul was able to sit and talk about his new job and I think that he is starting to feel a little bit better about being in NYC.  Eventually Kelly took a cab home and Paul and I went back to his apartment.  Passed out around 3:30am.    Yesterday I had the day off from work, which was NICE.  I spent the majority of the day watching tv and preparing for the audition that Kelly's theatre company was holding.  Around 7pm, I bundled up my nerves, threw them in my bookbag and took off for Mid-town.  It was freezing last night and the commute was fucking awful.  I arrived at the theatre at 7:45pm for the 8pm audition.  We were paired up into groups and were told that we could run lines with eachother before we had to go in.    Side note:  I hate running lines with people that I am supposedly competing with for a part.  I was asked to read with this guy Patrick.  At first I was glad that he was the one I was to be reading with.  He was a nice guy and I thought that he would be easy to read with.   I was completely wrong and knew it right from the start of the audition.  Patrick is one of those guys that does distracting shit during a reading.  In the middle of our audition, Patrick walks away from me, grabs a chair from against the wall and sits in it.   UM...WHAT?!  I mean, of COURSE he grabbed a chair and sat down in it.  Why WOUDN'T he?  He completely through me off and then my mind was racing with: "Now, as an actor, I KNOW I should figure out a way to get another chair and sit next to him, but he totally threw me off and now I don't even know where my line is and doh(!) I have just stepped all over his dialogue and ARGH I HATE THIS KID!".   It was pretty frustrating.  So then we switch roles and Patrick plays the part that I was playing and I play the part that Patrick was playing.  This time though, I moved the chairs very far back so he couldn't grab one.    BUT WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT!  In the middle of our scene, Patrick turns his back to me and takes at LEAST 4 or 5 steps towards the back of the room.  Now, in order for me to continue reading with him, I have to figure out a way to walk backwards to stand by him.  Or I can just turn around, talk directly to him, and stand with my back to the auditioners.   Sure, I mean, why not?   What an asshole he was.  I mean, part of me is like: "He maximized his space and is trying to 'change up' the audition".  But a bigger part of me is like: "You are a selfish prick/showoff/asshole that can't focus on your own audition.  Instead you are distracting and do nothing but provide  unnecessary  challenges for the unlucky soul who has to read with you."  Needless to say, this portion of the audition did not go well for me at all.    When our time was up, I retreated to a chair outside of the audition room and just thought about what happened.  I realized that it's been two years and I am out of practice.  If I had been at the top of my game and slightly less rusty, I would have been able to combat Patrick's game playing.  But I didn't.  I fumbled, I lost my spot on the page, and I began to feel whatever confidence I had slip away and down the tubes of acting hell.  While I was waiting for my second reading, I had a chance to watch and see the other guys preparing for their audition.  As I watched each pair preparing for their turn in line, I was overwhelmed at how much more appropriate they would have been for the part instead of me.  I usually think that I can play just about anything, but the old adage is true: "Not every actor is right for every role".  These guys were better suited for this play and while I wanted to run out of the room in embarrassment, I know that a true actor sticks it out even when they know that they are no longer being considered for the part.  So I did stay and I did the best I could at remaining focused.     I was paired up with a guy named Lee for the second reading.  This reading went much better for me, but I am not sure if that was because he was not an actor or if I just felt more comfortable with him.  Lee was a great guy and was very easy to work with.  Unfortunately, Lee just doesn't have it as an actor.  (in my opinion)  We had a smooth run and then we were asked to wait around for a bit.    About 20 minutes later, Kelly and the rest of the crew came out and asked that 3 of the actors remain.  The rest of us were told we could leave.  I knew for sure, at that point, that there was no chance at me getting one of these two parts.  I put on my jacket and left as quickly as I could.  Upon arriving back at Paul's apartment, I was greeted with immediate "congratulations" and other words of excitement.  Unfortuately, I had to sit down and explain to people, who aren't actors, that I just wasn't right for the role.  Jen, Lisa, and Paul listened to what I had to say, but assured me that I would get cast based on the fact that Kelly is my housemate.  That train of thought makes sense, but I didn't know how to explain to them that it just wasn't the case.  Kelly wasn't the only person who would make the final cut and even if she was, she needs to do what she feels is right for her show.    I spent the rest of the night running the audition over and over through my head.  What could I have done differently?  What do I need to work on?  Was there ever a chance at me getting one of these roles anyway?  I came in to work today to find an email from Kelly explaining that I was indeed NOT cast in the show.  The disappointment I felt was pretty horrible, as it should be.  Being told that you can't do something that you want to do, regardless of what it is, hurts a bit.  Even though I convinced myself that I wasn't right for this part, I still felt kinda bad when I knew that my assumptions were right.  I do believe that I could have played either of the roles I auditioned for.  I believe that just about any of the guys auditioning could have played them as well.  I think that Kelly and her group made the right decision in not casting me.  If I had auditioned for people I didn't know, I am sure that it would have turned out the same.  There were gyus there that were better suited to play these parts.   I can accept that.  So now I have to find another audition.  There are quite a few good things that came out of last night.  1)  I auditioned.  After two years of running away from my dream, last night I took a step back towards it.    2)  I realized that my fear of "risk taking" in an audition is still haunting me.  I have always had a hard time putting myself out there when I am unsure as to how the part needs to be played.  I set up walls for myself that I must learn how to climb over.    3)  I felt ALIVE before, during, and after the audition.  I felt more like myself again.  I have been so mean and bitter lately and having spent one hour in front of people, trying out for a show, made me feel more like myself than anything else I have done since I left college.   4)  I learned how to accept defeat.  In the entertainment business, there is much more heartache and disappointment than any other field.  You must learn how to be told that you are "not right for the part".  I began learning this lesson last night.  It will only make me stronger in the long run.  All in all, last night was a great experience.  So it's one show and I didn't get in.  It happens.  I will spend today looking for another audition and I will try to find the positive in what I have right now.  I am so grateful that I was invited to the audition to begin with.  It was a wonderful stepping stone for me.  I remember what it's like to be in a room with a bunch of guys all wanting the same thing.  It's just that this time, I was one of those people who didn't get what they wanted.  This is going to happen to me about a thousand more times before I actually relax into something big.    And that's it.    Time to put the dream back on hold and go back to my life as an administrative assistant.   :(  For some reason, I hate this job more today than I ever have before.

       Talk about a LAME Saturday Night    I had it all planned.   Friday was my day alone.  Tonight was dinner at Pauls restaurant and then out to see our friend Steve play in his band. But then things happened.  As they always do.  Friday started with Paul cancelling our Saturday dinner due to money worries.  I understood.  How could I not?   Even if I was pretty excited that he used the word "date" when asking me to hang out.  My night alone last night was everything I didnt want it to be:  filled with anxiety, eating trash, and watching horrible tv for hours on hours on hours.  Could I have done a sit-up?   Could I have eaten a salad?  Could I have done some acting exercises?  Could I have EVEN put in a movie and watched something I hadnt seen over and over? no.  Impossible.  I was a piece of shit.   And for the first time in a long time...I hated it.  I didnt relax and I didnt have fun.    Today...I did the same.  Hung around and masturbated repeatedly.  At one point I was sitting naked at Ritas computer pumping my shit when Pintu, the landlord, came barreling through the front door.  Again.  Does he have to come in EVERY time I am doing something nasty and gay?   GOD. After running to my room and hiding out for an hour, I decided that it was time to re-emerge with confidence.  If he was still tooling around our apartment, I would act all surpised and tell him to get the fuck out.  Luckily he was gone.  After that, I spoke with Paul and he was pretty irritable from having worked at a new restaurant for the last 5 days.  He has been studying the store menu for days.  His test is tomorrow.   After speaking with him, I decided to whip up a very elegant and FAST dinner for him.  I wanted it to be ready before he got to my pad.  That gave me 50 minutes.    I tore through the cupboards thinking of endless dinners in my mind.    I finally settled on a quick marinated chicken, pasta packet of Fettucini Alfredo, and homemade bisquik biscuits.  JUST LIKE RITA MAKES.  I busted ass and the dinner was fully prepared for the minute he walked in the door.    He was very pleased and we immediately sat down to dinner.  (BTW...it was JOOD! ((that means "real good")))   While chomping on my fourth biscuit of the evening (stop it Joe.  really now.), Mariah called to inform us that she wouldnt be going to the show due to a sudden illness.  NOOOOOOOOOO!  I was COUNTING on  her being there. (She wasnt going originally, but changed her mind on Friday and I decided at that moment that I could only go if she were going.)  So Mariah bails and I start to realize that I just dont want to go anymore.  Of course.  Paul needed to study his menu, so I spent the time taking a shower and getting ready for our night out.  With Paul studying so diligently, I planned on us going out for a quick drink at a gay bar before heading over to the show at the  Elbow Room .  Every half hour I checked in on Paul to assess his progress.   During one of my visits, I ripped his pants off and sucked his dick.  He seemed surprised, but also pleased.  I knew it would help him relax.  :-D   Finally, at 9:15pm, I gave him the final quiz.  I dont know if the kid has literal rocks in his head or if he just stares at the pages and dreams of having fame, fortune, and a hot body, but he retained NONE OF IT!  He has been studying this menu for days and when I quizzed him, he burst out laughing at each item.  He was clueless.    I grew frustrated and explained to him that he was really only hurting himself by spending his time studying, daydreaming.  He nodded in approval and went back to work.    At 10:15pm....   HE STILL KNEW NONE OF IT!   No, thats not true.    When I asked him what the ingredients were in the basic cheese pizza, he said:  Well, I know that you are supposed to leave the basil off when children order it.....................................um.  Good Paul. very good.  I gave him a crash course in how to memorize things. The imagery trick worked like a charm, but after an hour and a half we still had only gotten through half the menu.    At that point I offered to not go out at all and to spend the night helping him memorize.  He was vehement in the fact that he had to go to Steves show.  I said I understood that, but also understood that the test was in the morning and that he was still unprepared.  This conversation eventually turned ugly and we fought.  The fight led to a discussion and  I tried to discuss a lot of the things that have been bothering me lately.:  1)  He never listens.  He talks over me and only about himself at an increasingly annoying rate.  2)  He throws everything, from our past, in my face on a daily basis.  It doesnt matter what comes out of my mouth, Paul has a memory of something shitty I have done that will counteract the point I am trying to make.  God!  This is the worst one.  Whether its a talk about money or the amount of times one of us has said I love you, he throws it in my face.  It makes it impossible to ever move forward.  3)  He is taking all of his frustration on finding a new job and changing his life out on me.   I understand that this has to happen.  The kid did just move to NYC for me. But, its gotta let up a bit.  I mean, seriously.   Its been 7 or 8 weeks and he is about to break me.  (I spent the last 3 days away from him.  Not really talking on the phone, not sleeping in the same bed, not arguing...it was nice)   I need him to get adjusted.  Yet deep down I know it takes forEVER for this to happen when you first to move to NYC.   I just have to be patient.  It's all I can do.    ugh.  After our argument, there was no way that I could go to the show with him.  The discussion had gotten too personal and real.  I have to admit, I was very proud of myself during the whole thing.  He got crazy and was screaming and I just listened and tried to understand.  I didnt scream (unless he spoke over me) and I really made an effort in working through it.   Ultimately it didnt matter tho. He left and refused to kiss me.   (how quickly we forget the blow job of 8:17pm)    I let him go.    I then realized that I had no plans for Saturday night.  Its now 12am and I sit here typing in my blogger.  Yeah JOE!  You are the MAN in NYC.  Look at how the phone rings off the hook!  God...time to not be such a loser.    Kelly called and said she would be home around 2am.  If I am still awake and breathing at that point, we will hang out.  If not, I go to bed having spent 48 hours in my house.  And for the most part...I have hated it.    Tomorrow night I am to hang out with Mariah.  That will prove to be more fun.  Thank God I dont have to work on Monday or else this weekend would have been a complete wash.    In conclusion...   While sitting here typing this, I decided to play Ritas mp3 selection.  I miss these songs.  I remember sitting here last summer, drinking my glass of wine, and writing about my woes.  Hearing some of these songs and sitting in this seat gives me this eerie feeling of comfort.  I love it.  And I am seriously going to miss living in my apartment.  Pretty soon Kelly and I will move to Manhatten and Rita will move back to Syracuse.  Life as I know it will change.    Lord help us.   oooh!  One more thing....  Rita had a very beautiful and MOVING experience on Thursday night.  An experience which she nor I will forget for the rest of our lives.  I dont want to get into it, cuz its her business, but I do want to say that I was and am still overjoyed with happiness. And relief.  It finally happened baby!  WELCOME!  I have never seen such beauty and innocence in your eyes as I did that night. I am always here if you need to talk.  And thats it.   Hope everyone else is having a more eventful Saturday night.    I gotta go find something to do.  Kelly doesnt get home for another couple of hours.

       OH NO!!!   Guys...big problem.  Nell Carter has died.  I am in complete shock.  The poor thing was 54 years old and yesterday she passed away.  I mean, really!  How can today be positive?  Nell Carter is gone!  For the full story, click on this:    urlLink Nell Carter is dead now   I feel horrible about this.  Who DIDN'T love her?  Cuz I surely did. ugh.  Bye Nelly.  Bye my sweet fat lady.  :(  In other news...  I really don't know what else to say.  I am kinda sad.  I guess I am just going to have to get over it.  I have yet to figure out a way to bring people back to life, so I guess I just have to accept the fact that I will never meet her and put my face in her beautiful busoms.  (big sigh)  So, this weekend seems to be filled with nothing, but fun.  Tomorrow night is my night alone.  I have no plans and that is exactly what I wanted.  When Rita asked me what I was going to do...I told her that I would "buy a pint of Ben and Jerry's and eat the whole thing.  The end."  She thought that was a good idea too.  On Saturday, Paul and I are going out to dinner at his new place of employment.  I am excited about that.  He is paying and that's a treat.  These days we both go dutch and I hate it.  I used to love being treated like the little princess.  Dinner will be fun.  And if I am lucky, maybe we will even hook up afterwords.  Who knows.  Saturday night, Kelly, Paul and I are going to see our friend Steve play a show at the Elbow Room.  The band is called   urlLink Lincoln Conspiracy  and they're pretty good.  Paul and I have been friends with Steve for a long time and it is going to be great to see him again.  And he's pretty hot when he performs.  His voice reminds me John Mayer.  Cept "Lincoln Conspiracy" is more like "Our Lady Peace".  You understand.  Not only will we see Steve, we will also see our friends Stella and Doodie.  It's going to be a big Boston reunion.  I am muchly looking forward to it.  On Sunday, I will be sleeping as late as I possibly can.  After that I have errands to do and then will be going out with my old friend Mariah.  It's been two weeks since I last saw her and we are very overdue for some special time together.  Maybe we'll go out, maybe we'll stay in.  Either way I am very happy to hang out with her again.  I don't see her nearly enough and that has to change.    On Monday, I will sleep late again and then get ready for my first audition in NYC!  Kelly's theater company,  The Glass Cage Theater Company , will be auditioning for their first production.  I am pretty excited just to do anything that involves reading a script.  I photocopied her copy of the script today and plan on dissecting it this weekend.  Fun, right?  Let's just hope it all works out.    And that's it!  I will be off from work Monday and I am pretty stoked about that.  Sleep late for 3 days??  How will I manage?    Okay, unfortunately, I HAVE to get back to work.  Will be by later.  I mean, I do have a computer in my room afterall. ROCK!

      I'm at home!  YAY!  I'm writing on my computer.  Geez...I love ya guy.    I miss my computer.  I only get to be home like 4 days a week now that Paul is living in the city.  So when I am home, it's like a celebration of kinds.  Not really a party, per se.  More like a reunion.    Kelly got cut from work tonight and to Rita's and my surprise, came walking in the door at 7:30pm.  It was pretty strange!  She is NEVER home after our usual 9-5 jobs.  She walked in and we loved.  We absorbed.  We talked for a bit and then tuned in to  American Idol  to laugh and laugh.  It was nice.  And I miss it.  A lot.  I decided that while writing tonight, I was going to do something different.   I decided to be fucking LAME and tell a few things about myself that you might not know.   LAME For example...I will tell you a secret or an embarrassing couple of things and you will laugh and go...boh? Cuz you go boh.  Even if you don't think you act boh...you do.  You are boh.  Here we go: (boh and go)  1)  I like french fries alot.  A very lot.   (I just wrote a whole paragraph about french fries and hated it so much that I had to burn myself and erase it immediately.  Holy shit.  I just wrote complete garbage and almost posted it.  LAME joe.  lame.)  (stop with the "lame" shit!)  I can't stop saying it.    Next...  2)  I have a problem with tangents.  I can't stop ever.  3)  I believe in the Lord Jesus Christ pretty hardcore and sometimes it doesn't come across nearly enough in this journal.  Cuz it should.  It's everything to me.  I understand that people have their own opinions about my lifestyle and my quote un quote (lame)homosexuality, but my relationship with God is my business and I couldn't possibly see it otherwise.  4)  I am a horribly jealous person.  In highschool I was terrible.  I thought I had outgrown it, but lately I think it's worse than ever.  I am an evil monster.  The ugliest kind.  I can be scary.  5)  ha. (being honest hurts)  5)  I want to hook up with a bodybuilder before I die.  It's just what I want to do.  I want to do it alot.  So much.   6)  I worry about being an actor every day of my life.  I obsess about it and I make myself sick over it.  I want so badly to have it all fall into place, but I haven't yet found the path.  It's close and I feel the tides changing.  It's such a long process, yet I know what I am destined to do.  I know it.  Yes, people say it all the time, but I truly feel it.  I am at the start of something big and I am afraid to accept it.   I believe this shit.  And I believe it's time.    7)  I have watched every  Real World  from beginning to end and it truly hurts my feelings that the Las Vegas cast was ever born.  Sometimes...sometimes Rita and I sit and name every character from every cast.  It's just what we do.  I am pretty impressed by us.  If the LSAT'S involved memorizing and adoring the  Real World , then Rita and I...well...we'd be PhD's.  or something else with an easier abbreviation to type.  8)   The Simpsons  is my favorite tv show of all time.  hands down.  9)  I love my parents obsessively and it scares me to imagine a life without them.  (I haven't talked to them in 2 weeks and it makes me ((literally)) sick to my stomach.  I miss them.  I worry about them.  I need...NEED...to learn how to live my life separate from them.  I am 25 and I want to spend every day with them.  What happens when they're gone?  When I don't have them here anymore.  This is the fucked up shit that I think and stress about.  Stop it Joe.  Stop it.  10)  I love to sing and sometimes think I was meant to be a singer.  Then I stop and smack myself for lighting and loving that first cigarette.  I wasn't meant to smoke.  I know it.  But here I sit smoking anything that will light.  Singing is my love.  I love music and I love a good voice.  I love everything about it.  I have aspirations of writing a song and being in a Broadway musical and cutting an album (even a lame European one)...and and and.  I just love it.  I wonder how my life could have been different.  11)  I need to finish soon.  It's 10pm and I gots shit to do.    12)  This is how much of a loser I was...when I was in fifth grade, one of my friends, Todd, brought a "Penthouse" on the school bus and I went up to the bus driver and totally rat him out.  As we know, even then, I must not have liked titties.  I TOLD on him!  He was busted and didn't ride our bus for awhile.  Man.  I sucked.    13)  I was obsessed with "The Babysitter's Club" (trademark) for 13 straight books and two super specials and can to this day tell you how upset I was when Claudia's grandmother "Mimi" died.  It's a secret I tell only the few.  Cuz I mean...Joe...did you think you were a 13 year old  girl !?  But I did and I loved it.  I find it to be useful knowledge these days.  You wouldn't look at me and think "That guy just loved "The Babysitter's Club"!".  But I did.  And in the game of life, I will use it against you.   14)  I like to be in my bed and comfortable no later than 11pm when I am home.  That means no more of this little share myself shit.    This was fun.  Maybe I will start thinking of random themes and topics to my journal!  Yeah!  That's exactly the thing I'm trying to go against!  snore.    Sometimes it's just fun to type when you know that other people are reading  it and thinking how damn crazy and sexy you are.  cuz so sexy, right?  I mean, I haven't shit in two days.    sexy, right?  oooh.  it's brewin...

      Okay, so I am back.  Officially.  Yesterday was crazy, but today has been a bit more low key.  The only downfall is that the day FLEW by yesterday when I was so busy.  Today crawls like a slug on the table of life.   hmmmm....  no.  Today crawls like my cock. how's that for creepy?  Thank God it's Wednesday.  This week is almost over.  Thursdays are cake.  I have a 3 day weekend coming up due to the fact that I had to be at that lame ass retreat on Monday.  All we did was sit around, eat BAD Chinese food, and discuss "turning points" in our lives.  Since I was not in the mood to divulge anything personal or for that matter, important, I decided to tell all of the new students that I was gay.  I swear I saw a few jaws hit the floor.  I mean...these poor students come in to talk about their Jewish experiences and I tell them that I like to touch other guy's penises.  It was pretty LAME and pretty GREAT.  Whatever.  In any case I get the day off on Monday, so how can I complain?  Paul and I have been two peas in a pod this week.  Sunday we made dinner and watched tv.  Monday we made dinner and watched tv.  Last night?  Oh yeah, we made dinner and watched tv.  I have seen more reality television than my stomach can handle.  Also, I have been eating rather hoss-like again.  Paul keeps asking me what diet I think I'm on and I always repsond with: "Can I have some more sour patch kids now?"  This diet is going GREAT!  I think I have lost....mmmmm.....NO POUNDS!  Eh...whatever.  I'm still hot.  On Thursday, Paul and I will have avoided sex for over 2 weeks.  Considering that our 3-year anniversary kinda went down the tubes, I am thinking of celebrating this mini-anniversary.  In fact, I spent at least one hour last night lecturing him on this topic.  He absolutely agrees that we need to start making love more often.  I don't know.  I sense that he doesn't want to touch me anymore.  Which is fine with me considering that I don't really want to touch him.  Paul and I are becoming great FRIENDS.  But when are we going to be boyfriends again?  It's weird.  I know I am still in love with him and I KNOW that he is still in love with me...but we have hit this plateau and we need to find a way to break out of it.  I am tired of being the one to initiate the hook-up.  And if I don't initiate it, it doesn't happen.  Basically...we've got work to do.   But it's fun work!  Naked fun work.  Paul has gotten a job!  He started yesterday (orientation) and has shifts through the week.  The place is beautiful.  We are going to eat there on Saturday night.  He actually asked me out on a date!  I thought that was adorable, even though I know he only did it cuz he is supposed to go eat there at some point.  Snore.  I'm getting the most expensive thing on the menu.  CAVIAR TOPPED WITH LOBSTER BISQUE!  Sike.  I'll probably get garlic bread and hash browns.  ooh.  yum!   After we went out to meet his lame cousin, Paul and I spent the rest of the night with me watching tv and him next to me studying for his food and beverage quiz.  He called us "Study Buddies" and I about shit myself.  Cept that I wasn't studying.  So...fuck study buddies.  Luckily, his roommates Jen and Lisa have been MIA for awhile.  Jen went back to Boston for the week.  Supposedly she is coming back this weekend, but Paul says he thinks more like next week.  FINE WIT ME!  Lisa has been doing her own thing.  She tried to eat dinner with us the other night, but my shitty attitude and lack of interest in anything she was saying made her leave.  I was pretty pleased with myself.    GOD!  Could I BE a bigger ASSHOLE?  Yeah.  yeah I could.  I am becoming a VERY good cook.  Last night I made a pasta casserole!  I don't even know how to spell casserole, but I made it anyway!  It was fucking tasty and Paul licked up his plate and then mine.  I used 3 different types of cheese, two types of sauce, and seasonings seasonings seasonings!  The entire apartment smelled fucking good!  Paul sat on the couch studying while I spent an hour and a half preparing.  He was very grateful and surprised as shit that I am getting as good as I am.  I have decided that I like to cook.  Never really thought about it in the past.  But I think I have a slight knack for it.  You know why?  I have yet to cook anything that turns out to be nast.  Once that happens, I don't think I will be tooting my lil'  horn anymore.   fucking toot.  I get this pain in my chest now.  It's not in my heart, it's closer to my left breast.  Or my left pec.  Depends on which gender I am trying to affiliate myself with on that given day.  Today...woman.  So my titty hurts.  I think it's from cigarettes.  Sometimes it just goes away and sometimes it stays and talks to me.  Today it's talking at full volume.  I want to chop it's head off.  But essentially I would be chopping my tit off and that would just be hurtful.  Emotionally as well as spiritually.    I'm a whack job today.    Last Friday night, Paul, Rita, and I ate chicken clubs and watched "Signs" together.  It was my third viewing of this movie, but I still cried my eyes out like a pretty princess.  I am very moved by this movie and will go so far as to say that it was one of, if not, THE best movies I saw all last year.  There are scares, tears, laughs...everything a great movie should have.  It's wonderful.  Go out and rent it please.  Think of me when they discover that there really isn't aliens and it's all a hoax. sike. but maybe not sike........................... hahahahahaboof.   scuse me.  I made homemade french fries to go with our chicken clubs.  It was just about the tastiest thing my fat belly has had in awhile.  I HOUSED them.  Then I HOUSED some more.  Then I HOUSED my house.  Stop it Joe.  Stop being such a good cook.  Did I mention I go through about a gallon of olive oil no matter WHAT I make?  Yes, very healthy.  Pasta boiled in olive oil is gooooood!   No wonder my chest hurts.  On Saturday night, Rita, Paul and I went to this club called Heaven.  It was overpriced and sucked completely.  While we were there, this guy, Kris, comes up to Paul and they seem to know eachother from Boston.  Kris hung out with us the entire time and I was in full bitch mode.  First of all, Kris thinks he's hot shit.  I think Kris is FULL of shit.  At one point, Kris (who is like 20 years old) goes to me:  "You remind me so much of ME!"   I gagged on my vomit and then thought about what he said for a minute.  I remind you of YOU?!?!  But you are a cocky twink loser!!!  Why do I remind you of YOU!?!?!  As I saw him staring at himself in the mirror, adjusting his lame tie over and over (what is he?  fucking Avril Lavigne???), I decided to put an end to him hanging out with us.  I go: "Kris, I realize why I remind you of yourself.  You are used to everyone in the club staring at you and so am I.  Does it upset you that tonight they're only looking at me?"  He gives me a dirrrrrrrrrty look and skanks his way over to the bar.  While he was gone, Rita, Paul, and I decided to leave this so-called Heaven and go home.    Paul stayed at his place and Rita and I took the subway home.  TOOK THE SUBWAY HOME!  I don't think I have EVER taken the subway home after a night of drinking.  It took forever, but Rita and I were wasted and played the whole way.  Well, most of the way...we closed our eyes and laid our heads on eachother's shoulders for at least 15 minutes.  I made the stupid mistake of buying a 6 pack of Amstel Light for $11.  I opened one up in the subway station and chugged it on the way home.  It was trashy and it was perfect . The night went very well.  Kelly was home when we got there and she and I ended up staying up all night and talking.  Rita passed out in the chair and Kelly and I waxed philosophic until about 4:30am.  It was a very good night and despite Kris, the cocky motherfuck, I thoroughly enjoyed myself.    Okay...time for lunch!  We are having a party at 3pm today for Rita and our housekeeper, Angela.  There will be cake and fruit and annoying conversations to be had by all!  Surely looking forward to it.  But for now... for now I shove my face with lots of greaseless food.  Did I say greaseless? I meant...greasegrease.

       ONE MORE THING!!!!   PLEASE, for me if not for yourself, sign this petition to keep America from going to war with Iraq.  There are other solutions to this conflict, other than war.  If you disagree, I understand.  But if you are against murder or are apathetic to this issue, please take one minute out of your day to sign this petition.    urlLink No war!    My family and I appreciate it.

      At this moment I SHOULD be working on the 325 projects I got going, but instead I am playing on Gay.com and writing in my journal.  Yes, the Rabbi's would be very happy about that.  Right now I am having the most annoying experience of my life.  Can the housekeeper STOP STARING AT MY COMPUTER SCREEN!?  She is going to see that I am talking to my gays.  And then the gig is up.  She will be embarrassed and I will have to explain why it's important that I talk to people who have pictures of themself covered in pee.   :-0****** me vomiting  Can people just leave me alone so I can talk to hot gay man and write in my journal all day?  I mean...dayim!    Alright...some guy wants me to "cyber" with him.  Too bad his body looks like it went through a donut factory.   BOOO WAHHHH!  Cuz I mean, who am I kidding?  I got "raspberry glazed" strapped all the way around my waist.  But online, everyone thinks they are talking to their fantasy man.  Too bad I'm at work, or I might let this guy call me up and get off.  My theory is, if I don't end up liking you on the phone, I hang up just as you are about to cum.   MAN I'm such a bitch.    It's just...snores.    I love the guys that send me their picture and I end up recognizing the pic from a website I have recently been on.  Or the guy whose pic is of a HUGE bodybuilder, but when they call me on the phone, this little pip-squeak voice is like: "Joe. HYEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!"  Then I barf and hang up right quick!  If I wanted a woman to call me and get me off...I'd ask my mother.   Ok SICK!  YAY Weekend!  Here I cum......

      I just have to say one more thing.  I just signed in to "sitemeter.com" and checked my stats.  Within this account, you can see where people are coming from.  Like what link they were at before they got to you.  You understand what I am saying.  Computer geeks.  Cookies. hahahahalolorofllololcookies...geeks.  I get so many randoms on my site.  I get people who "google" things and end up on my site.  For example...one of the things I saw tonight was that somebody googled "Justin Timberlake free Naked".  (first of all...free?  Cheap bitches...)  They google THAT and end up on MY site?!?!  WHA!?!?!  Well, I guess I did put all of those words in my journal, so why WOULDN'T somebody stumble upon it.  But the weird thing is this...  Somebody "googled"......................."Paul Cut the shit"  PAUL(!) CUT THE SHIT?!?!  What happened to JOE (!) CUT THE SHIT?!?!?!   Somebody is more interested in Paul than me!   Haven't I told you people enough bad things about Paul already?  Do you still have to remember him regardless???  haha.  I think it's pretty cool   Well...and weird.    Why are people googling about my life.   But it's fun.  and also weird.  I made this weird. I have a tendency to do that.  ...............o....................  Goodbye now.

      Look at me writing at 12am on a Thursday night.  I have such POWER when I have a computer in my room.  Thank you mom.  Thank you dad.  You have given me a reason to sign online at midnight.  Rock out.  Had a very good day today.  Work sucked big time.  Have been so swamped and no one has given me a chance to breathe.  If you see that I am working on 4 major projects, do you send me an email telling me to ask my co-workers for money for the housekeeper's shoes?   No, that really happened today.  "Joe, please send an email around asking the staff if they will contribute $10 to buy the housekeeper new shoes.  She uses these shoes to walk around our building all day.  I am a complete asshole."  That's what my email said, promise!  So now...on my salary, which is pretty much laughable, I have to buy the housekeeper new shoes.  Why doesn't my JOB buy her new shoes?  Why do I have to do it?  I don't know.  But it makes me die laughing. Just so you know...I'm not giving the $10.  I'm giving $5, like the passive aggressive bitch I am.    Aside from that the work day sucked.  Afterwords, Rita and I met up with our friend Ian (formerly "Brian" in this journal) for drinks.  It was quite fun and I realized how desperately I need friends.  Such as Ian.  As we know now, Rita is leaving in a month.  Kelly works every night and soon Paul will too.  I guess it's time for Joe Cut the Shit to branch out.   It had to happen at some point.  Ian was fun and I think all of us enjoyed being with him.  Paul showed up and was a delight.  He always adds a certain "randomness" to every situation, but it worked well.  Rita and I came back to Queens and Ian and Paul walked to the subway together.   They probably fucked while waiting for the 9 train.   you know how it goes.  After getting home and me housing the rest of the box of wine, Rita gave me a Tarot card reading.  I have been feeling exceptionally "hot" this week and I thought that it was the right time for me to hone in on my personal shit.  Rita did the reading and it was right on!    I am not Wiccan and I don't summon the four corners (Menoh) when I do the Tarot.  I believe in Jesus and I know I shouldn't be playing around in these "devil" games.  (hee hee) (oh.)(stop with the parenthesis baby)(please stop calling me baby)  I do the Tarot because it gives me a chance to look at my life.  And my deck is in tune.  It knows whats up.  I give readings to people sometimes and it just blows up!  (I'm trying to be somebody I'm not)  My reading was right on and gave me a chance to analyze all of the different relationships I got working right now.   Rita, Kelly, Mariah, Paul, Ari, snorely mcsnores...you know.  All the importants.  Want to hear the weirdest thing?  I have been telling everyone lately that I should "play the numbers".  Monday night I was watching the local news when the lotterly numbers came on.  It was the pick 5 and I guessed three of them.  Do you know how hard that is?  There is like a billion and one numbers!  And I picked THREE of them! and I am a gaylord right now.  But the point is this:  I told Rita that I wanted to play the pick 3 lottery yesterday.  I said about...well...3 times.  I said: "Rita!  I want to play the numbers 5-9-6!" Tonight Rita tells me that the numbers were: "5-6-shumma shum".  (whatever it wasnt a 9 so why should I care...)  If I had played.... If I had tuned in my abilities... If I had trusted in myself...  I would have won money!  You get some cash for guessing two out of three.  Sure it may be 50 bucks and a handful of Twizzlers..but it's...CANDY!  And we  LOVE CANDY!    I gotta sit with myself and figure out how to come up with my numbers.  I have never bought a "Quickpick" lottery ticket before.   I picture me saying:  "Can I pick some numbers?" and them saying: "Wha?" Me:  "I want to pick some numbers for the pick 3." Weird Indian man:  "Whaaa?" Me:  "I feel hot.  Can I pick some numbers?" WIM:  "Oh.  What numbers would you whaaaa?" Me:  "Hot.  Me.  Numbers." WIM:  "Oh.  4-3-7. Me:  "No no no.  You speak English?  Phew.  Can I play the pick 3 please?  I would like to pick some..." WIM: "Whaaaa?" Me:  "I hate you." WIM:  "Fuck you man!" Me:  "I could have won money, but you ruined it.  You ruined my "hotness".  My psychic "hotness". WIM:  Lame. WIM:  "And also get the fuck out." ---end scene---  So you see... I am destined to not win the lottery.  People make me crazy and eventually I will be agoraphobic.  But my computer is not as cool as Sigourney's was.  And Harry Connick Jr. has better things to do than stalk me.... So...  Cured.    I buy a lottery ticket tomorrow.  Wow.  I'm done writing now.    Do any of you think I'm crazy?  I went completely free verse tonight and now I feel like Joe Cut the Shit has maybe cut too much shit?  Or maybe I am trying to give Christian Finnigan a run for his money.... Or maybe it would be  absurd  for me to think I could be Christian.  Cuz I mean...he's FUNNY!  Or maybe I never thought about it until this minute.  Snores.  I don't even have comments on my page.  Who am  I  kidding?  Sweet dreams... we hope

      Okay...just had to stop in here and say one quick thing...  I was just checking my email and saw that another girl I went to highschool with, Shauna, wrote me an email through Classmates.com and made contact with me.  WHAT?  What is going on with me these days?  This is so strange and so good for me.  I completely shut out my past and now I am being forced into facing it and accepting it.  It's a lesson I never expected to learn and a challenge I never thought I was strong enough to face.  But here it is and I feel ready for it.    You are gay Joe.  It's cool and you have accepted it.  You are comfortable with it.  Everyone else will be too.  And ultimately it doesn't matter.    D, I know will be cool about all of this.  She was always a very intriguing and special person.  I respected her and looked up to her and in some ways, was very intimidated by her.  She was so smart and cool and I was so heavy and spikey haired.  (well...I'm still heavy and spikey haired)(Sike)(sorta sike)  I wanted to be like her.  Cept a boy and yeah that's it.  I still wanted to like boys like her, so no need to change that.  I know she'll be nothing short of amazing.  But Shauna? I didn't know Shauna very well.  She was better friends with two people from my group.  She was always very nice and really...well...never made an impression on me either way.  Actually!  She never called me "fag", so I guess I do hold some place for her in my heart.  People like that were few and far between.   So what's up?!!?  I guess I do talk to her and see what's going on with her.  I am curious.  And it's also good for me.  I am 25.  TIme to start healing the past and focusing on the future.  Has this been what the last 3 years have been about?   Purely discovery?  Possibly.  Or possibly I'm just crazy and lazy and smoking up my hazy.  If I EVER write anything like that again...I expect anyone reading to send me an email belittling me.  No one deserves to read shit like that.  That's it.  Welcome to Joe Cut the Shit.  I feel all brand new and shit.  shit shit and shit

      What a day!  First off, can the constipation that is plaguing my poor body PLEASE come loose now?  I feel like my stomach is completely distended.  Is that the right word?  If not, just picture my stomach being gigantic and you get the point.  D has written me back and we are in the midst of making plans for drinks or lunch next week.  How exciting!  What will she look like?  How has she changed?  What if we fall in love and I have to tell Paul that I'm not gay afterall!?!?!  Oh man am I nervous!  haha  I finished reading the most charming children's book during my lunch break.   Rita gave me this adorable book on Sunday and told me to read it.  It's called   urlLink Because of Winn Dixie  and I just loved it.  It took me about 3 minutes to read and I wanted it to continue on so that I knew what happened to little India Opal and her dog "Winn Dixie".  It's nice to read a book for children sometimes.  It reminds you how innocent and beautiful things were back in the day.  Back when things didn't matter as much as they do now.  I was sure that the dog died at the end.  Rita even assured me that that didn't happen.  But how could a book be so nice and polite and NOT have the dog get run over by a mack truck in the end?  No books are like this anymore.   Sure enough, the dog did not die and I was RELIEVED.  I love you  Winn Dixie !  You are the best dog ever!  Going home to my own house tonight.  That's nice for a change.  Going to have a drink with Rita and then work on Paul's resume/cover letter.  Then I have to get to work on some stuff for me!  I've got to become an actor at some point, right?   Eh, maybe I will work on it tomorrow.  I'm sure there will be actors needed tomorrow.  Yeah that's it.  Yeah.  So Lisa, Paul's roommate, just e-mailed me the nicest message.  Maybe she's not as evil as I thought?   Nah...she's evil, but I will break her.  I sent her a bunch of links this morning that will hopefully net her a job in this city.  We'll see... She even invited me over tonight for veal parm.  I had to tell her that I hate her and can't come over.  I think she'll understand. It would be SO typical of me to become friends with Jen and Lisa after hating them so much.  I just don't like anyone until I have known them for awhile.  You know how it goes.   And if you don't know how it goes...please learn.    Okay...I might have a turtle poking it's head out of my ass....god willing! I gotta go...

      I have had QUITE the interesting morning so far.   It started as most Wednesdays start...boring, unfulfilling, and pessimistic.    BUT THEN!  I sit down at my desk and check my variety of email accounts.  Today, I received an email from a friend of mine from highschool.  Her name is "D".  You see, about a month ago, I wrote an entry about D in this journal and I used her first and last name.  I don't know why I do that, but I do.  (I gotta remember in the future to be much more careful of this type of behavior)(I mean, what if I wrote about someone I DIDN'T want to meet up with again)  In the entry about D, I had written about a very strange dream I had in which she was driving me around in her car.  She crashed the car in the dream, over and over.  If I recall correctly, she made me late for work at the Gap.  (ha!)  So...D writes me today and says that she "googled" her name and my site popped up.  Um!    She also told me something that shook me pretty deep.  She said that I had that dream about her on her birthday!  WHAAAA?!?! If there was any question about my psychic abilities before... I just got to learn how to hone these talents so that I can manipulate the world into doing what I say and giving me what I want.  heh heh heh (maniacal laughter)  SO, D!  I have lost touch with just about everyone from highschool and to be honest, that is absolutely fine with me.  I am a much different person now than I used to be and I don't have the energy or the desire to go back and get to know these people from my past.  I like my inner circle now and see no reason to change it.  However, there are those few individuals that I have always wondered about and would love to get to know again.  D is one of them.  I also found out that D goes to Columbia for Graduate School.  Ironically enough, I work at Columbia!  If she had never googled her name and written me an email, I would have still thought she lived somewhere exotic, like the Bay of Pigs, or something. Cept that she was always very thin, so I don't know if she would fit in with the other pigs.  And also, wasn't the Bay of Pigs a war or something?  Probably a war over gluttony.    WOW!  I am thrilled.  Things like this don't happen to me very often.  I am known for running into people I don't want to see.  How refreshing to run into someone I DO want to see.  It's been a good start to the day.  I am muchly happy.  And promise never to use the word "muchly" again.    In other news...I am supposed to go to this super lame work "retreat" on Monday.  Both Rita and Ari get the day off from work and I will be sitting bored out of my mind at this damn retreat.   Usually the retreat is at my boss's house in the Bronx, but this year they moved to my office!  And I don't have to be here until 10am!  I'm sorry.  But is today my birthday?    Also! (man, I am just FULL of good things happening to me today)  I was checking out my site meter and noticed a random blog that was linked to me.  Don't you just love when that happens?  She is "Bitchen!" and my theory is...if you link to me, I will link to you.  That seems like a nice thing to do.  Plus...my sitemeter has reported that "Joe Cut the Shit" is booming!  Please keep on reading folks.  It makes me feel good deep inside.  Way down deep in my vas deferens.  Vans deferens?   I don't know...let's just say it makes me feel good in my nuts.  So far so good.  The only thing that could top all of this would be if Stephen Spielberg called my office and asked me to play the next T-rex in the new  Jurassic Park  movie.  Yay! and also  GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!      Had a great time with Paul last night.  Ate 2 HUGE sloppy joes and then continued to swallow anything that sat still.  His roommate, Jen, was consumed almost immediately, due to her lack of creative conversation and social skills.  Figured I would just eat her and be done with it.   Am trying so hard not to get up and get a bagel.  Must eat fruit or salad or yogurt.  All of which I hate.  Well, I do love salad, but it has to be covered in blue cheese and toffee.  Cept substitute bacon bits for toffee.  You know how it goes...  Guess I should start doing some work.  I have so much to do and I have been sitting here FREAKING out for the last hour and a half.    It does feel good to be freaking out over something good for once, instead of my usual overly dramatic ranting and raving as to why Paul is such a jerk and my life is slowly, but surely, spiraling down the toilet.    Gotta keep this momentum going...

      WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!  I have been so completely swamped at work this week.  It's like I will never catch up.  Work just keeps piling on and no matter how big a breath I take, it is impossible for me to keep my head above water.  Really, I shouldn't complain...the days go by MUCH faster when I am not trying to fill it up with ways to play on the internet.  That shit bores me to death eventually.  I mean, how many times can I try to get Michael Jackson to throw his baby in the basket and not on the pavement?  Paul is SO back in my good graces.  Just as I had given up on him, he goes and does something wonderful.  Turns out that last night was to be my anniversary evening.  When I got to Paul's house he was, of course, lying in bed naked, taking a nap.  He must have been farting since the moment he laid down, cuz that room done stink!  Once I sprayed him and the blankets with Febreeze, he got up and we watched the Simpsons together.  (Fox has given us a full hour now, instead of the usual half hour! - 6:30-7:30pm)(rock) After the episodes were over, we both got dressed and went to the grocery store.  We split the cost of the groceries, which kinda sucked, cuz we didn't split the cost of HIS anniversary dinner, but whatever...  We bought the ingredients for taco salad and we got eachother little surprises.  He got potato chips, I got ice cream.  Then we rushed home and he made me the biggest feast imaginable.  I laid in bed while he served me an appetizer of Tater Tots (actually called Tasty Morsels)(they were the generic brand) and fruit punch.  After this he brought me my taco salad and I SHOVED it in my face.  It was so good, I almost jizzed on it before I ate it.  But that would have ruined it, so I decided against it.  After dinner, HE did all the clean-up with no fuss and I got to watch both  Fear Factor  and  Joe Millionaire  from the comfort of his warm bed.  It was wonderful.    At no point did I even see the evil Jen and Lisa.  They were in the apartment the entire time, but never made it down to Paul's room.  At one point I had a massive diarrhea attack and Paul was the lookout while I ran to the bathroom.  I escaped them for the whole night and it was great!  Paul was damn adorable all night long.  He made me laugh over and over and it was exactly what I needed.  I said "thank you" to him a million times and I finally gave him what he wanted:  I told him that he was off the hook for the botched anniversary.    We both went to bed happy.  Over the last two nights, I have had some horrifying dreams.  On Sunday night, I dreamed that I was diagnosed with a terminal illness called "Sephora".  Yes, I KNOW it's some sort of make-up store, but in my dream, it was a rash that started at my shoulders and covered my entire body.  It seemed to be the cousin of leprosy.  My family and friends put me into a cage and I got to watch them live their lives from behind bars.  When it was time for me to die, everyone crowded around the cage and said "Goodbye" to me.  I felt so scared and alone.  And then I woke up.  Last night, I dreamed that my old dog, "Garfield", was attacked by bees and laid dying on my living room floor.  Only it was my grandmother's living room floor.  You know how that goes... When I was younger, I saw one of my dog's get stung to death, so this dream is probably a throw back to that memory.  As Garfield laid there dying, my mom and I pet him over and over and cried about how much we loved him.  Eventually he stopped breathing and my mom and I just hugged eachother until the emotional pain went away.  I woke up as the alarm went off and immediately jumped out of bed.  I sat, smoking a cigarette, thinking about how much I miss my mom, my old dog, and my dead grandmother.  Kind of a rough start to the day.      The one upbeat thing that happened yesterday was that Mariah gave me a beautiful letter.  (She and I used to write letters to eachother all the time when she was still living in Boston and me in NYC.)  When I got to Paul's yesterday, I was still feeling low after what happened on Sunday night.  Mariah explained how much she loved me and how she totally sees where I am coming from.  She was very blunt about calling out some of my insecurities and in turn healed them all.  She smoothed it over for me.  Now I owe her a letter back explaining how lucky I am to have her in my life.    I finally feel as though I am not a complete lunatic.  Even though I have been reassured by everyone that my yelling fits are natural (considering the amount of pressure I put on myself), it took her writing me that letter to make me feel okay about it.  Thank you Mariah.  Thank you thank you.        She always gets me and that's why I love her so dearly.  There are few people that are as special as she is to me.  We have been friends for over 2 and a half years and I can't wait to see what the future holds for us.  Hopefully nothing but the best.  Tonight I am helping Paul with his resume and cover letter.  We will probably get some grub and watch a movie.  Since he doesn't have cable, we are very limited as to what we can watch.  There is only so much Fox news that a boy can take.  I promise to write a much better entry tomorrow.  I have been so crazy at work that I only have a couple minutes to stop in here and write about the quickie things.  Tomorrow will be filled with crazy tales of my past, longings for the future, and sexy secrets only I could tell!  Giggle snort goodbye!

      Today has been so blah.  I woke up feeling pretty gross, which a night of drinking will do to you.  No real hangover, just kind of "out of body".  Once 9:30am hit, I started to get quite a bad headache, borderline migraine.  I took some Aleve and layed down for an hour and now it is slowly dissipating.  I am proud of myself for staying at work and sticking through it.  For awhile there, I thought that I was going to have to up and leave.  Computer screens are not condusive to curing bad headaches.    But I am so relieved that it is going away.  I become completely incompacitated when my head throbs.    This weekend was pretty wonderful, for the most part.   Friday, Rita and I went home and had some drinks while discovering our new Playstation 2.  Thank you Angie!  We had a very good time.  I had talked to Paul during the work day on Friday and I was pretty furious with him when I left to go home.  I called him later that afternoon and he was sounding damn miserable.  So I sucked up my anger and told him to come over to my house; that I would make it better for him.  By 11pm that night, he was doing much better.  On Saturday, we stayed in bed for the ENTIRE day and I had the time of my life.  We laughed and talked and watched tons of tv together.  The day was wonderful.  I have a tendency to stay in bed, alot...but having Paul there to spend the day with me made it even better!  At one point he pulls me close to him and says: "I feel so lucky to be the one person who is this close to you".  It was one of the nicest things he has ever said and I haven't stopped thinking about it since the words fell out of his mouth.    He never did plan anything for me for our anniversary and at this point I think it's best that I just give up.  I have had numerous talks with both Rita and Kelly about this situation and I do feel better about it.  Once Paul gets a job, I am hoping he will come around.  Until then, there isn't much I can do about the way he has been treating me.  I am the one person he can take shit out on and I accept that responsibility.  He takes my shit daily.    The kid just needs a job.  Yesterday, I came up with, what I thought was, a good idea.  "Why don't we have everyone get together for mid-afternoon drinks!?!?!"  We all met at a bar called "G" and played "$25,000 Pyramid" while chugging down Vodka tonics.  The night ended on a very sour note.  VERY sour note.  I am not going to get into it on here, but just understand that it was bad.  I don't think we will be having a big get together with all of my different friends again for awhile.  It just doesn't work out.  When Paul and I got home, he was trashed!  Thank God he came with me when he did.  I spent the night cleaning up his vomit and wondering how I let this happen again.  He's got a major drinking problem.   ugh.  I ate rice and went to bed around 11:30pm.   I know this entry is complete snores, but I still have my headache looming at the back of my head and it is making it impossible for me to be any sort of a writer.    Tonight I am going over to Paul's place and he is taking care of me.  He knows how I am when I get headaches this bad and he told me that he will nurse me back to health.  That was pretty nice of him.  We are having taco salads for dinner and I will probably settle in for some  Fear Factor  and  Joe Millionaire .  Quite an eventful evening, eh?  But it's exactly what I need.  A little rest and relaxation.  And no drama.   And no Jen or Lisa.   That would be my perfect night.   Goodnight sweet prince.

       Happy Anniversary to no one.   Yesterday morning, I said to Paul: "Please be at my place by 8:30pm."  When he asked "why?", I said: "Just be there."  When I got home yesterday, I immediately went to the grocery store and bought the materials for a very nice dinner.  We were to start with shrimp cocktail.  After this, we would move to a very special blend of cheese and mashed potatoes, Italian chicken and Italian bread.  For dessert, strawberry cheesecake.  I also rented the movie  BeetleJuice  cuz he had been wanting to see it again.  I turned my room into a little restaurant.  I set up a little table with a table cloth, nice napkins, candles, a flower, etc.  I even took a picture of us and hung it right by the mini-table.  I put his gift at his place setting and did what I could to prepare the dinner.  At 8:25pm, the phone rings and it's Paul.  "I'm leaving now, so I will be there in about 40 minutes."   Disheartened, I say "Ok" and wait patiently for him.   At 10PM (!) the door bell rings and it's Paul.  He walks in holding a Duane Reade bag and I think: "He didn't just go shopping for me now.  He didn't." We go into my bedroom and I am nothing but sweet to him.  I feel horrible inside that my boyfriend has gotten there so late and that so far he has done nothing to make this day special for me.  He never even called me at work yesterday.  Without even being prompted, he says: "I needed a nap."  "But Paul", I say, "I asked you to be here at 8:30pm."  "I told you I needed a nap", he says.  The tear in my heart increases as I start serving the king his fucking dinner.  (can you tell I am a bit angry and hurt today?)  He shoves his face with food and I serve him course after course.  The food turned out wonderfully and I was quite impressed at what I put together.  The mashed potatoes turned suck, but I saved them with a little TLC and Paul did say that they were the "best mashed he'd ever had."  Once  I  cleaned up the entire mess, Paul said: "Time for presents".  I opened mine first.  The card he wrote had five lines in it and was filled with typos and messy handwriting.  "I love you Joe.  You are everything to me.  Happy Anniversary."  FUCKING SNORE.  "Did you write this on the subway ride over here?", I think.  I open my gifts and was UNPLEASANTLY surprised to find that he got me two dvd's.  "Requiem for a Dream" which is one of my favorite movies and "GIA", which I didn't like that much before and now after receiving it as my anniversary gift, I hate.  I also got a box of popcorn.  Gee, thanks.  I could hardly contain my excitement.  Mind you, this is my Christmas gift as well.  Two special events combined.    I take a deep breath and say "thank you" over and over.  I am not one for being ungrateful, even when I feel like he has just given me my own broken heart in a gift bag.    I give him his gift.   He opens the envelope to his letter and says: "What is this?  A book?"  My gaze turns into a glare and I say: "Please just read it." He does read it and seemingly loves it.  He says that I "write well" and that it contained "all the things he needed to hear."  I remind him about the gift, cuz he seems to have forgotten.  He opens up the watch and his jaw hits the floor.   Yes that's right Paul...I spent time, thought, and money on your gift.  He is dumbfounded.  He immediately tries it on and explains to me that he has never had a wristwatch.  I respond with: "I know.  That's why I got it for you."  He plays with it for awhile and definitely loves it.  I sense that maybe he feels bad about getting me crap.  But I don't know.  He puts the watch back in the box and asks me to turn on the movie.  I do as he says and realize to myself that this is supposed to be my anniversary too.  Not just his.  Why am  I  cooking the dinner?  Why am  I  giving gifts based on love when his are based on convenience?  Why is he acting as though I OWE this all to him?  We start the movie and I begin to get really upset.  My throat swells as I hold back the tears.  I tell him,  very nicely , that I don't like the movie "Gia" and want to exchange it for "Magnolia".  He responds by throwing the movie across the room and saying: "Fine".    I just sit quietly.    About half-way through the movie, I serve him his cheesecake and he says: "thank you".  I mention to him that "I feel as though you didn't put much thought into this holiday".   "Well Joe, this is your thing.  This is what you like to do."  WHAT?!  what?  oh.  I say: "Paul, honestly...I have bent over backwards for you and have done everything in my power to make NYC a home for you.  I am supportive about finding you a job and wiping your tears when you are depressed.  You knew this day was important to me and you have done nothing for it.  In fact, you have done everything in your power to make it worse for me."  "You know what Joe?  I pay for everything when we go out (which is SIMPLY NOT TRUE!!!!!!!!!) and I am giving to you all year long."  oh my god.  OH MY GOD!  The anger and hurt and frustration is building inside of me and I know I am going to blow.  I turn back to the television and we finish watching the movie.   I didn't even laugh when Beetlejuice got his head shrunk and that is my favorite part.  Instead, I had to keep biting my tongue so that I wouldn't cry.  I didn't want to give him the satisfaction of seeing me upset.  He doesn't deserve even that.  As we turned the movie off, I said: "You know...you could plan something for Saturday that would be just for us.  I would feel much better then."  He says: "Ok".  We watch a few minutes of mindless tv and as we turn the light off, I say again: "You know, I would really like it if you planned something on Saturday."  He responds with: "Yeah".    He barely kisses me goodnight.  This morning I get up and get ready for work as he lies there in bed.  When I get back from the shower, Paul informs me that his friend, Stephen, might be visiting town tonight and he would like for us to go out with him.  I say: "Maybe", but inside I am thinking "fuck no".  Then he says: "Jen and Lisa want to go out tomorrow night (saturday) and I want to take them somewhere cool.  Where do you think we should go?"  I look at him and my jaw hits the floor.    "Are you kidding?", I calmly ask.    He just looks at me blankly.    I say: "Ok.  I gotta go.  Call me later if you want."  I kiss him and leave.  And that's that!  That is my 3-year anniversary with my boyfriend.  I don't have much more to say on the topic.  I think you can understand how I feel.  It was a horrible evening.  It would have been better if he didn't show up at all.  At least then I could be angry at something concrete.  Instead, I sit here and feel like he doesn't love me at all.  Like he is done with me.  Like he doesn't know me at all and frankly doesn't care.  What am I going to do?    I can't call him today and scream at him.  I am so tired of fighting over this kind of shit.  I shouldn't have to yell at my boyfriend over something like this.  I shouldn't have to beg him to spend a little time picking out a gift or writing me a nice card.    Maybe he loves me, but doesn't like me very much.  Maybe...maybe it's not fair that I sit here driving myself crazy about all of this, when I know that he is sitting there thinking soley about his life and what he's going to do with Jen and Lisa this weekend.  I am going for drinks with Rita right after work.  Yes, I am using booze as an escape.  I just want to laugh a little today.  Yesterday, I didn't.  Paul can call all he wants.  I think I am going to be "away from the phone" all weekend.    I hurt right now. And the worst part... is that he doesn't care.

      My mom just called me to check in.    For our anniversary, my dad called and left the most beautiful message on my answering machine.  I stood there, soaking wet, as I had just gotten out of the shower, and listened to him tell both Paul and I how happy he is for us and that he hopes we have a special day together.  WOW.  I love this man with so much of my heart.  I hope he realizes how much it means to me that he called and left this message.  My parents are nothing short of wonderful to me.   When I got to work, there was an "E-card" waiting in my inbox.  I opened it up and there was this message:  "HAPPY 3RD ANNIVERSARY...WE WISH YOU BOTH MUCH LOVE AND HAPPINESS..ENJOY THE JOURNEY...WHEN YOU DO IT TOGETHER IT IS ALWAYS BETTER...WE LOVE YOU"  WOW!   I remember when I was much younger, thinking that I could never tell my parents that I was even "questioning" my sexuality, and look at this!  They love me so deeply and it shows in everything they do.  They don't have to accept my homosexuality, but they accept me and want me to be happy regardless of who I am with or what I am doing with my life.  Is it wrong that I consider my parents to be two of my closest friends?  They will always be mom and dad, but I love hanging out with them so much that they might as well be my buddies.    Thank you mom and dad.  I don't think I could ever come up with the words to express how much your messages meant to me today.    I am so touched.

       Happy 3rd Anniversary to Paul and myself!   I came into work late as I was up until 2am running around our house like a drunk chicken with it's head still on.  You know how that one goes.  It was quite an enjoyable evening.  Hells...it was fucking fun!  Ari, Mariah, Kelly, Paul, Ari's brother, Ethan, and I were all together to celebrate Miss Rita's turning 26 years old.  We had many vodka tonics and some shots and well, how could the night go wrong with all of this booze going down our throats?  It was great and I am sure that Rita had a very special and wonderful birthday.  She is so grateful for everything she gets.  Her attitude about everything made me want to form a lasso and grab the moon for her.  She loved everything.  And it warmed my heart to see her so relaxed and happy.    When we got home from the bar, we gave Rita her birthday cake and opened her presents.  Her sister, Jeannie, sent the most wonderful package and we all sat around like giggling girls while she opened up and played with each little gift.  Her sister loves her dearly and I was so happy to see Rita be able to celebrate, in some way, with her family.  While we were in the cab on the way home, Rita was eating a box of Animal Crackers that Mariah brought for her.  All she kept saying was: "I want the elephant one.  Please find me an elephant cracker."  There were none.  When we got home, Rita had received a package from her boyfriend, Andy, and when she opened it...what did she find?  She found a big stuffed elephant!  How did he know?  How did he POSSIBLY know that she wanted an elephant???  And it was better than an animal cracker.  By far.   It was beautiful and once again, she was so grateful.   BTW...Rita ate most of the animal crackers despite the lack of elephant shape.   hee.  Around 1:30am, Paul and I went into my room to eat a slice of pizza and go to bed.  Once finished with our food, we sat and discussed, very briefly, our anniversary plans.   Here is how the conversation went: Me:  "So tomorrow's the big day.  What are we going to do to celebrate?" Paul:  "I don't know." Me:  "ooook.  Um, how about dinner and a movie?" Paul:  "Well, actually, I told Jen and Lisa (GRRRRRR!) that I was going to make taco salads for dinner at home." Me:  "Huh?" Paul:  "I told Jen and Lisa that I was going to make them taco salads for dinner." Me:  "What the FUCK are you talking about?  You're joking, right?" Paul:  "No.  That's what I told them before I met you at the bar tonight." Me:  "Paul, you have to be kidding me!  Tomorrow is our 3-year anniversary and you are planning on spending it with Jen and Lisa and taco salads?!?!?!?!" Paul:  "I don't know." Me:  "This is fucking crazy!  Why are you doing this??  You knew how important that this day was to us.  At least, how important it was to me.  How could you even entertain that thought with those bitches?  I can't believe this." Paul:  "Oh Joe.  It doesn't matter.  I can always come over afterwords." Me:  "Fine.  FUCK YOU!  Why am I with you?  Why????  When you know something means something to me, you do everything in your power to destroy it!  I am tired of this shit.  If you have taco salads with Jen and Lisa tomorrow night, you can stay there and spend the rest of the evening with them.  And don't even THINK about calling me or coming over.  EVER again." Paul:  "Oh stop.  It's not a big deal." Me:  "Of course it isn't a big deal to you.  But it is to me and as my boyfriend and on our anniversary, you should have thought about my feelings and not just yours alone.  I'm not talking about this anymore.  I am going to sleep and you sit there and think about why I am so upset over this." Paul:  "Just hug me." Me:  "Fuck no.  Goodnight."  And that was it.  I fell asleep so upset and hurt by him.  I also vowed to be angry at him in the morning, even if I felt differently.  This is fucking bullshit!   I woke up and he was already awake.  He looks in my eyes and he says:  "Happy Anniversary".  I go:  "Happy Anniversary to you, Jen and Lisa."  I sat up in bed and put my head in my hands and felt the tears rising in my throat.  He rubbed my back for a couple of minutes while I just sat there.  Eventually I got up and got into the shower.  After I returned to the bedroom, I had calmed down a bit and decided to give him one more shot at making this situation better.  When I opened the door to my room, Paul was sitting there, obviously thinking about our conversation from the night before.    "Are you still having taco salads tonight?", I said. "No.  I want to be with you.  I'm sorry.  I will meet up with you after you get out of work."  As I was in the shower, I decided how I wanted the night to go.  Since Paul had already made plans with other people, I figured that I would, as usual, take the responsibility of planning the entire night myself.  As if it was my anniversary alone.  I decided that I wanted to make him a romantic dinner and turn my bedroom into some kind of restaurant, with candles, nice music, a picnic blanket, etc.  I told Paul to come by my place at 8:30pm.  I will have appetizers, a meal, and dessert already prepared.  I am also going to do my best to rent a movie that he will want to see.  I'm thinking "Beetlejuice", cuz he had mentioned the other night that he wanted to see it again.  I wrote him a two page letter today and I am giving him his Kenneth Cole watch tonight.  I am also giving him something else, but I haven't decided yet as to what it will be.   I hope I, at least, get a card.   :(  When I spoke with Rita earlier this morning about the incident with Paul, all I had to say was: "Paul told Jen and Lisa that he is making taco salads with them tonight, instead of hanging out with me."  I barely got out the "me" before she exclaimed: "WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU JUST SAY!!?!?!?!?!?!"  I repeated myself and she was like "WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!?!" I love her for her immediate support.  I am sure it will all work out fine.  I just don't understand why he does this stuff?  I still feel very hurt by the whole thing and whether he meant it or not, it wasn't funny on any level.  Damn him.  This lady that I work with, Doris, has the fucking worst BO I have ever smelled in my life.  She just came by to grab something from my desk and my eyes rolled up into the back of my head.  She was like: "Are you ok Joe?" and in between gagging I'm like: "Please, for the sake of my health, step away and go back to your office."    Today when I walked into work, I told the front desk attendant, Pedro, that today was mine and Paul's 3-year anniversary.  He asked if we were doing something special and I said "Probably dinner and a movie".  He responded with: "and then a little kissing" and I said: "Yeah, that's when the gross stuff begins".  He looked at me and very seriously says: "Joe, you need to stop with that shit.  What you have is normal and you should represent it that way when you are talking to other people." You know what Pedro?  You are absolutely right. I will work on that.  I hope this day turns out better than it has started.  I am in a decent mood.  Just can't seem to shake what Paul said to me last night.  I am positive that it will be fine.  By why did he have to say that shit? Why?  I gotta go figure out what else I am getting him, but something is telling me that I should stop while I am ahead. I don't know. Will give a full update on the evening tomorrow. I pray it goes well.

                                                    HAPPY 26th BIRTHDAY MISS RITA LOVELY!!   YAYAYAYAYAYAYAY! I hope today brings you nothing but pure joy!  You are my best friend and my confidant.  Thank you for all of the time you give me and for the endless (and I mean ENDLESS) talks we have.  You make me feel so good about myself and I thank you for that.   HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU MY LOVE.  Tonight we will be taking Miss Rita to happy hour at Jake's Dilemma.  Everyone will be in attendance.  Mariah, Kelly, Paul, Ari, myself...all of the people we know and love.  It will be quite the time.   I hope. I always stress about shit for no reason.  I ended up writing a ton yesterday, so if you have missed it, scrolled down and you will see the entry from late last night. Have been so swamped at work today so don't have much time to write, but will try to check in after my birthday lunch with Reets. PEACE!

      This is a momentus (momentous?) occassion.    I am sitting in my bedroom and typing an entry.   Wha??? I don't sit in my room and type an entry.    I sit in the kitchen and I type. I sit at work and I type. Sometimes I sit at random computers and I type.  But sitting in my room, my private, wonderful room, and typing, is something else.  Clearly...I'm in love.  As I type, I am listening to the  Miss Saigon  soundtrack.  I had ordered the cd from BMG a couple of months ago, but they sent me the "highlights" and I was very upset.   So for Christmas I asked for the full blown soundtrack.  Every song.  Every word.   You see, I lost my version.  Someone else has it.  Probably someone I don't talk to anymore.  I hate that person.  I hate them hard.  But you see, now I have my old love back.   I'm not THAT gay.  It's just that there are certain things a man needs  and the  Miss Saigon  soundtrack is something a man needs.  ha.  I am happy right now.   Paul decided to have dinner with his roommates.  The cursed Jen and Lisa. At first I was pissed that he was "choosing them over me", cuz I am a psycho.  Even when I hinted that I wanted him to come over instead of having dinner with them, I thought to myself: "I hate them (that's the first thing I ALWAYS think when their names come up) and I would love to have a night away from Paul, so go go go!".  So, I'm crazy...I don't know what I want.  Anyway, I got distracted, cuz I was jamming out to a Broadway musical.   It happens. Now and again.  and always.  Right now I am about to make preparations for Rita's bday.  I have some things I need to do.  But since she is such an avid reader of this ever popular journal (hahahahahah....boooooooowaaaaaaahh...oh damn.....OH DAMN.....oh yeah thats good) I can't give away the details.  So I have decided that I am king. I decided that rather than just have a good time with whoever I am with, I will just control every situation, so that I never end up with those "uncomfortable people" hanging out in my group.   Essentially I crown myself as king. I am sure that my friends will completely appreciate this. You see, we are all looking for a leader.  Someone to make all of those decisions you don't want to make.  For example... You are sitting around with a group of people (some of which are better friends of yours, than others.) and you all have to decide where to go to dinner. You get nervous, cuz you want to voice your opinion, but you don't know if you have what it takes to say: "Look...we should go here."  What if they think it's a stupid idea?   And you don't know these people, so it might be best to make a good impression and do whatever they want.  NEVER! Invite Joe Cut the Shit to all of your parties and I will make your decisions for you.    I have accepted the fact that I am going to obsessively worry about everyone in my life no matter what, so it might be best to just go with it and control it all.  I think it's VERY healthy.    Instead of wondering who is going to call everyone and make sure they show up at the right time to your PRECIOUS (golum) event, I will call them all and make SURE they show up on time.   What I am getting at is simple.  I am tired of sitting back and worrying about all of my different friends meeting eachother and getting along.    No one has asked me to do it and no one expects me to do it. I have done this.  I can't change overnight.  But I can be more vocal and honest with what I feel.   Instead of expecting people to automatically know what I think, I need to explain it to them and give them a chance to understand me.   If I feel uncomfortable with Paul's roommates, I need to explain to him  why , instead of hoping he will ask me about it after hearing me say things like "Oh Lisa?  Yeah.  Her words are my sleeping pills.  Basically she is suck."  Joe...stop it.    LOL.  and stop it.  okay enough.  That's just the lesson I learned today.  So here are a quick OTHERS that are going on in my life right now:  1)  I am looking to purchase a BOWFLEX or TOTAL GYM or something else endorsed by such popular actors as Chuck Norris.   I'm talking  Texas Walker Ranger  folks.  I want it.  Or one of them.  I want to be able to work out in private and not at a gym.  Paul laughed in my face when I told him the idea.  That just makes me want to do it more.   But I am on a limited budget, so I need to figure out a way to find a good, compactable machine, that is affordable.  Even if I have to pay for 12 months...that's fine.  Just affordable.  Hey, it's cheaper than a gym!   And so much sexier when I stare at myself in the mirror. All sweaty and raw.  sickest.  2)  I feel good.  I am ready to tackle some things in my life.  AND most importantly, I feel that I am doing it at my own pace.  I am ready.  You watch.  A year ago right now (read my archives) I didn't feel the way I do now. I am ready folks.  3)  Kelly and I might end up living with this girl Stephanie.   Okay...news is out folks....Rita is leaving NYC on March 1st.  She is going back to Syracuse to claim her love.  She has answered the question we all want to answer: "Am I willing to spend the rest of my life by his side?"  Well...it took her 6 years, but she has realized her passion.  She will be an amazing wife and mother.   But let's not completely let her off the hook...cuz the thing is...my dream for Rita has always been HUGE.  I want her to get published.  I want her to act in a play.  I want her to sing a solo in a choir.  Rita's got the talents and when it comes to my view of her life, I dream big.  Joe big.     But I finally get it.  I see that she has to go for her.   It's pretty difficult to accept, but I get it.  I do. enough. so anyway (BTW... Cry Me a River  is now playing.   I love this man. Have you SEEN the new "Rolling Stone"? whats up!?!?!?!?!  So Kelly and I are, of COURSE going to move in together.  We were planning on two, but now we are thinking 3.  Kelly has this friend Stephanie that has been with her for at least a year.  When around, Stephanie is nothing short of a darling.  I am BIG on first impressions and this girl has it.  Every visit with her is nothing short of a joy. So Kelly poses the idea of Stephanie to me today and I think...why not.   Of course I was looking forward to living with just one other person and cutting out the college-ish life entirely... but I also think...interesting.  This could be a good experience.   For all of us.   So that's that.  More to come...  4)  I am bored now so goodbye.  Wow.  I just typed all of this in my bedroom.    I am so lucky and never for a second do I think that I have it worse than 80% of the rest of the world.  ha.  I better stop while I am ahead.

      YOWZAHS I gotta piss right now.    Whenever I drink Vitamin Water, it literally runs right through me.    Good story Joe.  Very intriguing.  Sometimes I just don't know how to jump right into my entry for the day.  So I start by saying something like: "Whoa!  The slice of pizza I had was so greasy" or "ROCK!  I have two arms and two legs".  I don't know..either way...it's LAME!  Last night was quite an interesting evening.  I got out of work at my usual 5 o'clock time and scooted on down to Paul's place.  We had plans to get movies and groceries.  When I showed up Kelly was at his apartment getting ready to go see "The Hours" with Paul's roommates, Jen and Lisa.  Unfortunately, when Paul opened the door to reveal Jen and Lisa, I immediately cringed and wanted to leave.  The problem with Jen and Lisa is that there is no problem.  They are very pleasant people and have never ever come close to doing anything hurtful or mean to me.  Yet, I can't stop saying horrible shit about them and on every level, I REFUSE to accept them.    To be honest, they aren't my FAVORITE type of personalities to hang out with, but I am mature enough to realize that people are different and variety is what makes the world go round.  However, I am NOT mature enough to allow them into my inner circle.  I am very picky about who is allowed "in".  In many ways, I feel as though I have hand-selected the people that reside in my little group.  Kelly, Mariah, Rita, Ari, Paul---as of right now, these are my special people.  Of course I have other friends and of course I get along with most everyone, but I am VERY picky when it comes to hanging out with acquaintance-esque people  all  the time.    I'm a bitch who hates spending my free time with people I don't completely LOVE.    It makes sense.  Kelly, on the other hand, is a  very  accepting person and we all appreciate her for that.  She has seemingly clicked with both Jen and Lisa and I am happy for her.  Since Jen is a lesbian, Kelly has a new gay friend to go bar hopping with.  Kelly could make peace with a piece of dook if she wanted to.  She's that open-minded.  Now, put me in the middle of all of this and you can see where the problems develop.  I am in no way soft spoken or demure.  I am very opinionated and I want what I want when I want it.  For example, if everyone is sitting around trying to make a decision as to where to go drinking that evening, I will walk into the conversation and within minutes say: "Why are you arguing?  We are obviously going to (insert the name of a super fun bar)".  Sometimes it's a great thing, sometimes it's a big problem.    When I saw Jen and Lisa sitting on the couch last night, it took all I had not to vomit or scream on sight.  Paul's apartment is quite small and there is no escaping any unwanted conversation.  I told Paul to get his things, that we were going to Blockbuster and to the grocery store.  He immediately obliged and at the time I'm not sure if he obliged so quickly to appease me or to get me the fuck out of the room.  Probably a mixture of both.  We said our goodbyes and took off towards Union Square.    Paul was in the mood to make cheeseburgers and french fries.  There has never been a day in my life when I HAVEN'T wanted cheeseburgers and french fries, so I was very excited about this choice.  Unfortunately, I suggested the turkey burger and later on that night, we both took one bite of our sandwiches and chucked them in the garbage.  Turkey burgers have a tendency to taste like horse shit.  At least the ones Paul made did.  The french fries we got ended up burning so I sat with a gigantic bowl of cereal and that was my wonderful dinner.    ha.  We rented the movie "Trapped" with Charlize and Kevin and I never saw more than 20 minutes of it.  You see, I pretended I was asleep so Jen and Lisa would go to bed and it worked!  YAY!  Will use that one again in the future.    But...there was one thing I have skipped over...  Paul and I were putting clean sheets on his bed, when I decided to be all sexy and shit and I pulled him down on top of me...  WARNING: SEXUALLY EXPLICIT TEXT --- IF YOU ARE OFFENDED (ie: totally LAME) then go to   urlLink the lamest site on the internet and be completely bored .  As we lay there kissing, I felt totally out of body.  We were fully clothed and I could sense that he was feeling very awkward about kissing me.  Our clothes were fully on and our breath was not the most pleasant.  I told him to kiss me for a few minutes and that we could make dinner after that.  He pulls in tight to me and I can feel his erection through his pants.  I immediately stiffen and suddenly I want nothing of this kissing... I want to hump. What happened to me?? I start grinding against him and I can tell by his breathing pattern that he is about ready to go to town on me.  I casually slip out of my pants and he starts pumping my erection up and down.  While it felt tremendously good, I couldn't help but still feel completely awkward.  I look up at him and his face is all serious.  He is now in full "hook-up" mode.  I try to make myself believe that after almost 3 years in a relationship, there is no reason why I should feel weird with him.  I closed my eyes and tried to just go along with what I started.  Paul took off his pants and boxers at that point and I started to panic.  What was wrong with me?  I started this whole thing and now I lay here and don't want to do it anymore.  But how do I tell him that I want to stop?  Paul began to give me head, very slowly, and for the first time in our relationship, very gently.  (he is not a good blow, usually)  The head of my dick was so sensitive and I repeatedly had to push his head away.  We maneuvered into a 69 position.  His dick was raging at this point.  Usually I give amazing head....very slow and wet and hot and yeah...I can finish Paul off in about 35 seconds.  But last night, his dick made me gag and I didn't like the taste of it at all.  Paul sat upright and knelt next to me, massaging my dick in both of his hands.  I closed my eyes and went to fantasy land.  After about ten minutes of this hand-jerking, I finally had to push his hands off of me.  I told him that I wanted him to kiss me until I came.  He was comfortable with that and there he laid...next to me...while we each just jerked our own dicks until orgasm.  Of course, when he came it had to be all over my chest.  This is the way it almost always ends up, and last night, I hated it.  I felt degraded and tired of having to be the one to either jump in the shower or eat up all the cum.  ok SIKE!  Never would I eat cum off my chest.  That is purely disgusting.    In any case...this is the love session we had last night.  After 3 years, this is how the two of us made love.  Maybe intercourse will actually change our relationship for the better.  But what if it doesn't?  What if I always have to run away to fantasy land?  Is that normal?  Do other people do the same thing and as often with their mates?  Do we all envision the best bodies on the planet?  Or am I the only one that can't keep my eyes open during sex?  Our anniversary is on Thursday and while I feel no pressure to de-virginize myself on that day, I know it has to happen and soon.  This kid is about ready to bust inside.  And so am I.  I am tired of not knowing what sex is really like.  I am tired of being in love with someone and not being able to share this adventure with him.  There is so much I don't know about and I am ready to start exploring.   But is Paul my best friend?  Or my boyfriend?  I am still unsure.  After we finished "hooking up", Paul said that he felt MUCH better and that we should do it at least once a day.  (Right now, we average about 3 times a week) (yeah...yikes.  cuz I cum at least 9-10 times a week...just alot of times, alone)  Why did Paul feel that our sex was so good, when I felt like I was touching a stranger.  And a stranger that I wasn't attracted to no less.    Hmmmmm......  And why did those cheeseburgers taste so completely nasty?  In any case, I am off to do some planning for one Miss Rita's bday.    This was a different entry for me today, huh?  If y'all like gay porn, I've got some great stories I could lay on you.   Just let me know...

      Paul has been utterly adorable today.  He called earlier and when I answered the first word out of his mouth was "POOOO!"  He was happy and excited to talk to me.  In turn, I was equally as happy and excited to talk to him.    I was really struggling with some Paul issues last week and explained to Rita my fears and doubts as to the level we are at right now.  She gave me some amazing advice which I have since implemented into our relationship and it seems to be working perfectly.  Encourage him, even when you don't want to, give him some extra TLC, and most importantly, allow him to be himself.  He is having a very hard time adjusting to this city and I hate to say it, but "I TOLD YOU SO!"  See, these are things I am trying not to say to him.    In any case, a little bird told me that he has gotten a "call back" for a job and I am much excited.  Once he becomes employed, I know everything will fall into place for him.  Well, at least he will start being nice to me again.   That's all I really care about.  ;)  This morning as I was getting ready for work, not only did he let me smoke a cigarette in his bedroom, he sat and talked to me until I got into the shower.  Then when I got out, he was sitting there in bed waiting for me.  We giggled like girls and talked right up until I had to leave.  Most mornings, he lays there trying to fall back asleep.  But on those special mornings, when he sits there and talks to me, I feel so good about him and about us.  Just that he really enjoys being with me. It's quite wonderful to have moments like that after 3 years of a relationship.  Okay...gotta get ready to leave this place I call my job. Off to dinner and alone time with my special boy.  I think we are in for some good sex tonight. I'm feeling it today. (heh heh)

       urlLink I hate Mondays   Welcome back folks.  How awful is it to have 2 weeks of time off due to holidays, just to wake up on January 6th to find out that reality is back and there isn't a vacation in sight!?  Ooooh, how joyous is this bullshit we call life.  The only thing that seems to keep me going today is the fact that I don't have to go back to the Gap.  I still wake up in the morning and think how happy I am that Rita quit for me.  Thank the Lord.  I just couldn't do it. Speaking of the Lord, I saw "Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" last night and I loved loVED LOVED it!  Yes, it was three hours and yes I ate more candy than my teeth could handle, but OH MAN was it good.  Especially that little Golum guy.  (you know...SHMEEEEEEEEEGEL)  Paul and I ran around calling everything our "precious" last night and then cracked up over and over.  Paul actually came up with the best "precious" comparison:   CIGARETTES!   When I couldn't find my butts this morning, I jumped on the bed, curled my lips and snarled: "WHERE IS MY PRECIOUSSSS!!!!!!!!!!! If and when you see the movie, you will know what all of this means... The effects were great, the acting was wonderful, the writing (obviously) is brilliant.  It is quite a movie experience and it should be had in the theater.  If that's your cup of tea.   And I hate tea!  After the movie we ate 3 pounds of rigatoni and then I stole half of his roommate's block of Brie and shoved it down my throat.  We proceeded to watch the movie "The Dangerous Lives of Alter Boys" and I was impressed at how wonderfully shocking certain parts of the movie were.  Unfortunately, it made me feel weird inside and I vow never to watch it again. Don't you love my eternal passivity?  Paul and I will celebrating our 3-year anniversary on Thursday.  I have gotten him a Kenneth Cole watch and am planning on getting him a baby turtle from Chinatown.  But as I told Angie in an email this morning, I have heard that baby turtles give you Salmonilla, so I am going to have to watch Paul carefully.  He has a tendency to put everything in his mouth.   Even cute, baby turtles.  So, much to my surprise, I looked in the mirror this morning and my skin looks beautiful!   WHA HAPPEN?!?! I have had these dry skin patches on my face for just about 6 months and suddenly they are just gone?  Will someone PLEASE tell me why I get weird body things that stick around for awhile and then just disappear without any sort of explanation?  Remember my bleeding gums?   Whatever the reason, fine.  I just pray it stays away forever.    SO...I have been quite worried about Mariah lately.  She is struggling to make her way in NYC and has yet to find herself a job.  I know that deep down she is quite depressed about it and I have done everything in my power to help her.  I spent a half hour one day trying to get her bills in order, I researched and gave her contact information for temp. agencies in the city, and I have been through numerous conversations with her about curbing her spending, etc.  She is in some serious shit.   She has borrowed thousands of dollars to pay her rent and this month was no different.  Right before New Year's, and another loan later, she was very close to making her rent for this month.  I was informed last night that since she baby-sat, she was able to make her money and can breathe free until February 1st.  But then what does she do?  She goes tanning, she goes out to eat, to bookstores, to movies, drinking....and I am told that I should just back off and let her be.  But how can I do that when no one else seems to care at all about  her .  At least not enough to truly help her.   Lord help her.  Cuz I surely can't.  What's worse is that she has some horrible influences in her life that cause her to just open up her wallet, and dump more cash on something useless.  You would think that her friends would understand that she needs to SLOW DOWN!!!  But they don't.  They keep taking her out and encouraging this ridiculousness.  After talking to Rita about this, she has informed me that I have done all that I can do and it essentially is her responsibility to take care of it.  While I agree with her, I wonder...do I just leave my friend high and dry?   I guess the answer is yes.  Mariah's biggest fear is having to move back home (Albany) and at this point, I am pretty sure that is where she is going to end up.  She has got talent like nothing I have ever seen before, but that means nothing when you are thousands of dollars in debt to your family and friends.    Probably the thing that bothers me the most about all of this is that I have become this scary beast with her.  I drill her about her spending, I lecture her about finding a job, and worst of all, I act like her mother and father all rolled into one!   Gosh, I just don't know.  I just care so much about her.  I don't want to be this person with her.  But I don't want her to leave, more.    I had made arrangements with her to come into where I work to get computer lessons, but she has bailed each time we were to get together.  So I guess that's it.   I take Rita's advice and I trust in the fact that Mariah will wake up before she digs her hole any deeper.  And maybe I will take a fist to these so-called "friends" of hers that keep bringing the girl down!  Rita has had a rough morning and I am just generally annoyed today, so we will be going to the West End for some grub.  I just love me the West End.  It is the one place where you can sit and smoke away all your cares.  Wednesday is Rita's birthday and we are planning on going to happy hour and then I assume, shoving our faces with pizza and the like.  It really is dependent on whatever Rita wants to do.  It is her special day afterall.  And I am going to do my best to make it the specialist! Remember that movie "The Specialist"? Yeah, me either.  Oh...just so we are all in the loop together...my brother made it safely back to Germany.  VIVE LA GUTENTAGS or some shit.  Time for smokes and food!    Rdios.

      I am a die-hard cancer.  There is no "cusp" in my life.  Rita just sent me our compatibility chart and ironically we are exactly the same!   Unfortunately, the chart also said that I am totally incompatible with the Aquarius.  Well surprise surprise...Paul is an Aquarius.    Here is the description of my personality.  It is 100% true.  Cancer's element is Water. Symbolic of the emotions, water signs need to give and receive. They thrive on the exchange of feelings. They need security and love to be wrapped in an environment of love and comfort. Truly a wonderful example of Yin receptivity, Cancer seems to absorb memories, feelings and psychic messages. Of course, they send back their own good vibes in the process. The cardinal' motivation energizes their strong ability to provide for others. Few work as hard and as tenaciously as Cancer. Without the balance of Yang assertiveness, however, Cancer's confidence can be a bit wobbly. After all, the Crab is so very sensitive to everything. Just as the sign's ruler, the Moon, goes through phases, Cancer often experiences mood-swings. Sometimes the desire to love results in giving too much. In such cases, the Crab can become over-protective or dependent. Balanced, the Cancer adds personal independence to his or her priorities.

      Happy Friday! This is the first Friday in forever that I don't have to leave my day job and go to the Gap.  Is it wrong that every five minutes I stop and think how HAPPY I am that I don't have to go back there?    Rita and I had a very long discussion last night about my need to quit this job, my reasonings for getting it in the first place, and my plan of action having freed up all of this time.  She was incredibly supportive, as she always is, and I left the conversation feeling confident in myself and comforted in my decision making skills.    After much analyzing, we came to the conclusion that I didn't get the job at the Gap for the money.  I did it for the experience.  I learned a variety of lessons both about myself and about the world around me.  You see, before I worked at the Gap, I found myself in bed every night at 10pm, drinking obsessively, and worst of all...scared to make new friends because of my decreasing self-confidence.  Having to spend 40 hours a week with people I didn't know, doing work I didn't enjoy, and making conversation with people, regardless how I felt emotionally, was something that I never thought I could do.    I was becoming fearful of myself and what I could accomplish if given the chance.     I know it sounds weird, but it's true.  By looking at me you would never know that I, internally, FREAK out when I have to make base conversation with people I don't know.  Yesterday, I was talking to one of my co-workers and while I was making very diligent eye contact, the entire time she was speaking I found my mind screaming: "She thinks you're not paying attention", "She thinks you're humoring her", "She thinks you are a fat, nasty beast that has impossible goals of being an actor".   I make myself insane with this nonsense.   Yet, Rita assures me that the people I am talking to don't realize my internal struggle to be a normal guy.  She seems to think that I am very good with social situations.   It feels so nice to get this type of encouragement.  Especially when you feel as though you are Blobby McBlobbersons with nothing clever to say.    When I explained to Paul last night that Rita and I came to the conclusion that I worked at the Gap for the "experience" of it all, he reacted in two very awful ways. 1)  He laughed right in my face.   He has this new thing where, when I say something he thinks is absurd, he laughs right in my face.  No joke.  It's like: "Paul, I didn't work at the Gap for the money.  I worked there to learn about myself and about my personal endurance." Paul:  "BOO WAHHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!" --- which essentially means: "You stupid fucking moron...how could you possibly have voiced such a ridiculous notion!" It really hurts when he reacts this way to me. 2)  When I asked him not to laugh in my face when I say something of importance, he instead SCREAMED in my face and said: "You are so lazy!  That is what it comes down to!  Laziness!  You didn't work at the Gap for the experience Joe.  You worked there so that you could make some money for once.  Cuz you spend it frivilously and without any sort of responsibility."  Needless to say, I fucking hated him last night. After he, literally, screamed in my face, I politely asked him to get the "fuck out of my house". He screamed again and I felt my heart about ready to burst.   "Stop yelling at me.  It's not your life!  It's mine!  I want to live for me now..." Cuz you see...while Rita and I were hashing and re-hashing the issues swirling around our lives, I came up with my New Year's resolution. I want to spend 2003 living my life for me. Most of my day is spent worrying about what my parents think of me, if my brother is going to live or die while in the ARMY, if Kelly and Rita are mad at me all, if Paul is doing ok living in this new city...etc etc and it doesn't even stop there...etc. When my brother and I were at Kelly's restaurant for New Year's Eve, there was a moment when he looked at me and said: "Joe, you need to stop beating yourself up about everything in your life.  You are an adult and you need to make your own choices, regardless of what other people think."   I found instant clarity in what my little brother was saying to me. Why at 23 is he able to go off and do what he wants to do with his life, while I sit here at 25 and act as though I still need my parents and friends to make all of my decisions for me? Why have I let this go on for so long?  So...in 2003 I am going to make my decisions and be confident and proud of them.  Even if they aren't the "most responsible" of decisions.  I think I know what is best for me and it's time I start implementing that into my life.    Paul is the one that makes this the most difficult for me.    We had a very long and horrible discussion after I asked him to leave.   He put his jeans on and as he was packing his stuff up, I said: "Go ahead.  Run away from every problem we have.  Don't stay and be a part of this relationship.  It's what you always do." He stood there contemplating what I said to him and then he slowly took off his jeans and got back into bed. I tried as hard as I could to explain to him that I need to live my life for me and that I can't worry so much about what the other people in my life are going to think. Not only did he completely disagree with my New Year's resolution, he called me the most self-centered guy he has ever met.  He says that I "have always lived my life for me and only me".  And that all I "care about is making sure that I am okay with what is going on in my own life." Of course I tried to explain to him, as calmly as I could, that this is so far from the truth, but he wasn't having it.   It wasn't until he screamed at me again about quitting my job at the Gap that I pulled out all of the stops and said: "Stop acting like your fucking father!  Be Paul!  Stop treating me the way he has always treated you and your family." He didn't speak much after that. And I was grateful.  I sit here, right now, and I feel so hurt by the way he acted last night.  I had the most beautiful and healing conversation with Rita and then Paul comes in and wipes it all away with his anger, bitterness, and resentment.    Fuck.  Why does my boyfriend do this to me??  Why am I letting him do this??  Why does he not see me for who I really am?   but more importantly  Why does he not protect me and love me no matter what I do with my life?  Does anyone else have this problem(?) or am I just in a fucked up relationship?  I am so tired of being misunderstood by him.  I am so tired of having to try to explain to him that what I feel is valid.  I am so tired of him laughing in my face.  Tonight, Rita and I are going out for drinks.  I am seriously excited.  I want to get out and I want to get away from our house, Paul, and from the rest of the world that thinks they know what's best for me.    My New Year's Resolution:  Be myself.    And   Be confident in every decision I make.

       HAPPY FUCKING 2003!   Are we serious?   It's 2003!!!!!  Finally!  You see, I am truly hoping that this year brings a more exciting and purposeful direction for my life.  2001 and 2002 sucked my nuts, but this year...this year's gon' be good!  I'm BACK!  And in a wonderfully upbeat mood!  I can't believe that I have been away from this computer for 13 days.  I did the best I could to slow down time, to make the minutes crawl, but regardless, here I am at my job and ready for some more time off!   Shit nigga!  It would be virtually impossible for me to do a blow-by-blow of the different things that happened over the last week, so instead, I will simply create a small and very significant list of the  big  things that happened over the holidays.   Joe's List Of Big Moments:   1)  My brother came home and we had the most beautiful time together.  His plane arrived on 12/23 and from that moment on we were inseperable.  We watched movies together, played board games together, got drunk together, made fun of my parents together, etc etc more drunkeness etc.  I realized over the last week and a half that my brother truly is my best friend.  I miss him more than I ever let on and it is finally catching up with me.  He knows me so well.  When he gives me advice, I listen.  There are few people in the world as important to me as my brother.  God help me get through this next year without him.  I feel sick when I think about it. 2)  PRESENTS PRESENTS and more PRESENTS!  Man, I cleaned UP this Christmas.  My parents are notorious for going overboard every year, but this year....YOWZAHS!  I could have never expected to get what I got.  For starters, I got a fucking computer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  My very own computer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  And also a new television, a leather jacket (tremendously classy and nice), clothes, cd's, dvd's, cologne, gift certificates, and that is really only the beginning.  Mom and Dad took such good care of me this year.  I felt embarrassed at how much they gave me.  As my brother says every year: "Joe's Christmas list is purely a cry for help." I feel so blessed and I can't wait to dive into all my new toys! 3)  My family and I went bowling over break and I LOVED it!  We drank beers and smoked cigarettes and I won 2 out of the 3 games.  Go Joe!  Bowling's pretty fun.    pretty . 4)  I re-arranged my bedroom and it looks kinda good.  My dad has informed me that I have a college person's bedroom at the age of 25 and he is right.  Our entire apartment is way too cluttered and filled with more fun than class.  When Kelly and I move, we may have to discuss changing it up a bit.  I don't think she would mind that at all.  Paul bought me the most adorable little computer desk for Christmas and I now have a huge television, DVD player, VCR, and Playstation all in my bedroom.  Um...and I can pee out my window.   Go ahead and ask me if I am ever leaving my room. ....................................... ....................................... ...................................... fine don't ask, but the answer is still "no". 5)  Paul's roommates officially live in NYC.  Fucking snore. 6)  My parents and my brother joined me in bringing in the New Year at Kelly's beautiful West Village restaurant.  The food was fucking bomb and the drinks were just about free.  The bartenders took such good care of us and with the exception of my over-active anxiety, the night went off without a hitch.  Sometimes I have a very difficult time relaxing.  I am so afraid that someone will be left out or that my dad will grab one of my friend's boobs, or that my mom will fall right out of her barstool.   Oh yeah, my mom DID fall right out of her bar stool. 7) Paul met my parents for the second time in his life and he was fucking NERVOUS.  Me, being the self-centered asshole that I am, didn't even consider the fact that he would be nervous.  I didn't ask him once before the night started if he was ok.  And he never brought it up.  I found out from everyone else that he was having minor panic attacks.  Once I confronted him about it, I was able to make it all better.  Just took me awhile to get my head out of my ass. He got along FAMOUSLY with my parents.  My dad, especially, had an INCREDIBLE time hanging out with him and talking.  They discussed everything from religion to homosexuality and marriage, and they both walked away still smiling.  I don't know how that happened.  But I am grateful for it.  God was truly watching out for me in that respect.   My parents love my boyfriend!  I am the luckiest kid alive. 8)  Friday night, Kelly, my brother, Mariah, Paul and I went to Webster Hall for the evening.  I wanted to do something big and special when Winfield was in NYC and I thought that Webster Hall would be the "it" place to go.   Clearly it was, since the line to get in stretched for about 4 blocks.  BUT!  I went to the website to check out times and location and noticed that you could buy the tickets in advance.  Kelly sat down and took care of "business" for us and wouldn't you know it...we didn't have to wait in the line at all!  It was like we were VIP.  (I played Pamela Anderson's character) (if you didn't get that reference, then you are an individual of a higher class than myself) We walked past all of the other people in line and got right in.  It was nice to feel important for once.  Thanks to Kelly for making sure we got those tickets.  Otherwise, we would have been in line for at least 2-3 hours.  It was a crazy night.  At one point, Kelly and Mariah were laying all over my brother as though he was their pimp daddy.  Well, Mariah was passed out and drooling on his chest, so I don't know if that counts as laying all over him.  We danced, we drank, we sat on a nice couch.  All in all, I think we had a GREAT time.  Paul, of course, got out-of-hand wasted and wouldn't pull the bottle of vodka from his mouth.  Two days later, he goes out with Mariah and Kelly and word gets back to me that he was even more drunk that night.  I sat him down yesterday and had a very long talk with him about the abuse of alcohol.  Hey, act like a child, get treated like a child.  He made a "resolution" to cut the shit when it comes to drinking like a hobo.  And he fucking better or he and I are headed for some major drama in our relationship.  I'm not letting this slide anymore.   I've had enough. Why is it that my group of friends, me included, can go out and get WASTED, but still hold onto some thread of dignity, while Paul goes out and leaves his maturity at the door?  Anyone who thinks it's "funny" when he gets like this only encourages him.   I'm just really tired of having to baby him every single time we go out.  And he embarrasses the fuck out of me.     9)  Remember how I told the Gap that my uncle had passed away so that I could get out of work for a couple of days?  I said that he got an infection in his leg from the hip replacement?  Yeah, well he does in fact have an infection in his leg and he is back in the hospital for real.  Do I have to kill everyone in my family????  God, please don't let him die.  Not yet.   Man, why do I do this shit?   10)  Today, Rita called the Gap and quit for me! Yes, you read that right.  Rita called the Gap this morning and told them that I wasn't coming back to NYC for awhile and that I had to be taken off the schedule!  I am officially done with that hell hole!  FOR REAL!  YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAY!  I have never been so happy in my entire life.  No, really.  My ENTIRE life.  I was supposed to work there all weekend and all next week and now I don't have to go back ever.  They are going to mail my paychecks and hopefully, I will never have to see their retailing faces ever again!  Honestly, I haven't been this elated about something in a LONG time.   Well, except for last week when my brother came home. heh. Hey!  Remember when I worked at the Gap? I hardly do! YES! Thanks Rita!  You gave me the best New Year's present ever!   Now get working on my Easter present. What else... I am FUCKING SO FAT RIGHT NOW, it's ridiculous.  I am on a hard core diet that consists of nothing, but wine, beer, and french fries.   No seriously, Joe Cut the Shit needs to cut the shit when it comes to shoving his face.  My pants are ripping at the seams.  I had to wear a pair of Paul's pants for New Year's, cuz all of my nice slacks fit like spandex.  Oh and how does my ass look in these pants?  Let me tell you a little something about gigantic... SO BIG! I need to cut it out or eat rice cakes.   I may have to have a counselor intervene at some point.  I don't know if I can do it by myself. I love to eeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaattttttttttttttttttttt. I am having "Subway" for lunch, because I am at the point where even fat ass Jared is having to influence me.   I mean if Jared can do it...can't I? too bad Jared's still an ugly motha fucker. dork. (just jealous cuz Jared has the money to buy subway every day for lunch/dinner)(the most EXPENSIVE diet on the planet) Mariah and I have been spending a great deal of time with eachother these days.  I think she is really enjoying herself.  It's got to be nice for her to get out of the apartment and hang out with other people, besides "Rachel the psycho" (her roommate) once in awhile.  I drove her back to NYC from Albany and she didn't leave our little group until Sunday morning.  She was tons of fun, even if she spent more than half of it on the phone with her ex-girlfriend, Marisa.  Wait, did I say ex?  Cuz what I meant was "sex". Even broken up these two are more in love then they have ever been.   Marisa is even talking about moving to NYC now.  WHA? Could this relationship of theirs go primetime?   We shall see... I miss Mariah and now that I am no longer a slave to the Gap, I know that we will be hanging out more than before.  I would really like to get a potluck dinner thing started.  Paul came up with the idea and I think it's genius.  I will pose the idea tomorrow night over drinks and dancing.  I think Mariah is going to want to go to this club called "Heaven", but since she gots no money, she will be accompanying the rest of us to a dirt cheap bar that has games; darts and Megatouch 4 eva! Alright...time to go eat my low fat wheat bread sub from Subway.    If Jared's there I will ask him how it's possible to lose 245 pounds and still be a loser.

      We have begun the process!  The move is officially under way.  I woke up yesterday at 1:30pm and immediately started helping Kelly tear apart our apartment.  We got a lot done, but I am afraid to say that there is so much more to do!  I dont think I have any time left for fun this week.  We have to have the house ready to go by Wednesday night.  It seems as though Kelly and I will have to move into our new place on Thursday evening, rather than Friday morning.  Gotta make use of the big strong boys when they are available.  Regardless, we will still be sleeping in our Queens apartment for one more night.  Rita leaves early Friday morning and I want to make sure that we are with her up until the moment she drives away.    Man, its really happening.   The days are flying by like wild fire.  My head is swirling with things I need to do and just when I think I have narrowed down my final list, I realize that I have yet to change my address on some of my bills, or that I havent called the thrift store yet to remove my couches, or that GAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!  See?  So much.  In other news  I was out having my mid-day cigarette when the strangest thing happened. This guy walks out of an apartment building, about 50 feet from me, and projectile vomits all over the sidewalk.  Seriously.  It was like, one minute, silence.  The next minute, a tremendous splash on the ground.  The guy wipes his mouth and goes back into the building.  I couldnt help but burst out laughing.  I mean, I DO feel bad that he got sick, but how rare is it to see someone just haul off and erupt from their mouth?  I had an enjoyable cigarette to say the least.    Thank God I dropped off my laundry at the Laundromat today.  I have been wearing BO covered clothes for at least a week or two.  Just wanted to have all new laundry before we moved into the city.  But still, thank God, I got some clothes clean, cuz I was starting to get a little embarrassed at having to keep my pits shut whenever I was in a group of people.  My boss is driving me up the fucking wall today. The end.  SO! Member how I wrote that I used too much steroid cream on my cock and it dried out and shriveled up?  Well, late Thursday night, I needed to jerk off pretty badly, and decided to tempt the fate of my dick and just go for it.  I have to be honest, the cock looked so severely damaged that I was sure I was going to have to forgo sex for the rest of my life.   WELL! As I began jerking, the skin surrounding my dick head and shaft began crunching.  Like, well, you know, crunching.   It didnt hurt at all, so I kept jerking.  The lights were off in my room so I couldnt see what was happening down there.  It only took about 5 minutes to get myself to orgasm and once finished I flipped on the light to see the damage I caused. LO AND BEHOLD!   Jerking my dick off made all the crust crumble and flake off.  I was lying there naked, looking down at my cum covered dick and saw that there was dead skin everywhere!   I jumped out of bed and stood over the garbage can so that I could get as much of the dead skin off my stomach and into the trash.  There was like 8 layers of it.  I then wiped myself up and pealed the remaining skin off.  Underneath all of this crunch was the most beautiful baby soft dick I have ever seen!  And it was mine!  ALL MINE!  I was elated.  Not only did I not destroy my cock, the three days of steroid cream torture I went through ended up turning it into the prettiest and softest cock in the world!  I havent been able to keep my hands off it since.    The lesson I learned is this:  If you make a mistake and put steroid cream on your cock in order to eliminate a pseudo-skin disease, wait three days and then jerk feverishly.  Underneath all that ugly is a cock that is brand-new and baby soft!  SICK!  I got so much packing to do.    Ari just got back from her final lunch with Rita.  She just walked into the office with tears brimming in her eyes.  Ari doesnt cry, so the minute I saw it, I grabbed her and took her out for a smoke.  Rita has become such a big part of so many peoples lives here that when they say their good-byes, it just tears them up.  Ari and Rita have gotten to know each other pretty well over the last year and I knew it was going to be hard for them to give their farewells.    And the beat goes on  All righttime for lunch.  I heated up my soup like an hour and a half ago and maybe now that it has fully congealed, I can go enjoy it.  Latas.

      I am sitting at my computer in my bedroom and typing in the notepad of microsoft.  You see, my wonderful computer came with "Windows XP", but there was no "word" program downloaded onto it.  I know, sounds crazy.  But it's true.  Since my internet connection in my room is dial-up, I get knocked off every time someone calls.  So I am forced to type in the lame notepad cuz I don't wanna lose the shit I type. You understand. And what a lame way to start this entry.  I'm not sure what I want to write.  I just knew that I wanted to sit and get some shit out of my head.  With so much going on in my life these days, it's hard to pick a topic and focus in on it.  I could write about the move to Times Square, I could write about Rita leaving for Syracuse, I could write about Paul's lack of support throughout this whole thing...really I could write about any of these.  But I don't want to.  I am already feeling pretty stressed and dwelling on any of these issues might send my emotions reeling.    I will try to work up the nerve to wax philosophic about this depressing shit in a minute.  But for now...  For now, I start with the   TOP 5 PET PEEVES I HAVE ABOUT RIDING THE NYC SUBWAY:     1)  The subway system has no real schedule to follow.  Sure, there IS a schedule, but actually seeing a train pull up at the exact minute it's supposed to is like waiting for Usher to admit he's gay.  Every morning I try to leave the house at the exact same time.  It takes me about 10 minutes to walk to the subway platform (an estimated 11 blocks).  I leave at 8:05am and know that I need to make the 8:15am train in order to be exactly on time for work.  I am not one for leaving early as I am a slave to routine.  No matter what I do I am guaranteed to miss the train.  Then I must wait another 5-10 minutes for the next train to arrive.  At this point I am late for work no matter how fast the train speeds along.  I fucking hate that there is no true subway schedule.  2)  As a gentleman, I am usually left standing on the subway.  I always give my seat to an elderly person or a woman that is seemingly pregnant.  I say "seemingly" because I have had that moment of offering my seat to a very pregnant woman who has in turn looked at me as though I was criticizing the baby made of donuts sleeping in her belly.  Yet I still try to offer my seat to someone that needs it more than me.  Fine, so I stand.  Even when I feel like shit from drinking the night before or even when I haven't slept well and would just about kill someone for their little space of bench, I offer them the seat and stand clutching the "straphanger" (aka the handgrip that runs along the top of the train).  Now, my pet peeve comes in when we are pulling into another train station.  No matter who it is: old lady, man with one leg, teenager with a coke problem, they are SURE to stand up and ask ME to get out of the way so that they can get to the door first.  This infuriates me!  My theory is: "If you are lucky enough to get a seat on the subway, then you accept the fact that you will be one of the last people off the train."  Sounds fair, right?  NO!  I am constantly shoved out of the way by self-absorbed people who think that we must not only give them a seat, but get out of their blessed way when the train is slowing to a stop.  Truth is...I am not getting out of your way, cuz I have to get off too.  Can you wait five fucking seconds so I can just turn my body and inch towards the door?  Oh no, you can't?  Then enjoy my book bag in your face while you wait for me to get off the train.  I fucking hate people who tell you to get out of their way when you are getting off at the same stop as them.  3)  If it is rush hour and there are about 100 people crammed into a subway car, do whatever you can to not rip an egg smelling fart.  I can't tell you how many times I have been stuck riding 90 blocks on a subway train smelling someone else's rotting insides.   Yes, I have let a couple go myself, but I have also held that beast in until I grew nautious, doing my best to spare my fellow commuters from this nasty gas.  It makes me physically angry to stand, smooshed in like caviar, and smell with each breath, the breakfast, lunch and midday snack that your body is slowly and angrily digesting.  I fucking hate people that deliver horrible fart babies on the subway during rush hour.    4)  Since I commute mostly during rush hour, every time I get off the train, I am forced to barrel through a crowd of anxious subway users.  It's like I'm invisible.  If I am unlucky enough to get off the train last, I get knocked around like a pin ball trying to escape before I am stuck on and forced to go to the next stop.  You've got to be a fucking asshole in order to commute successfully in NYC.  After being shoved around for 2 years like I don't matter, I have now started to pretend I am the biggest football player in the city.  I walk with determination and force and give men, women, and children alike, my shoulders to their face.  Hi.  Nice to meet you.  Did you like my shoulder being shoved into your douchebag face?  Then WAIT until I can get my poor white ass off the subway.  For lack of a better thing to write: "I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore".  I fucking hate people that don't let you off the subway before they barrel through the entrance door.    5)  I think that, subconciously, this last pet peeve bothers me the most.   I have done the same commute so many times that when I arrive at the subway platform, I know exactly where to stand in order for the door to open right in front of me.  As I previously mentioned, I arrive at the subway platform just in time for the doors to close right in my face, each day.  Therefore, I am stuck waiting awhile for the next train to come.  Now, since I have been waiting for what has been up to 20 minutes for a train to come, is it fair that you walk right up to the subway as the doors are opening and shove me aside so you can get in first?   My god, asians are the worst.  I don't have a true problem with asians per se, but why is it that when I am waiting patiently for a subway, I am constantly shoved aside by a little asian woman who somehow knows that she is to be the first person onto the train.  I just don't get it.  Any asshole that would walk up to a subway door and shove aside all those that have been waiting in line, deserve to get slapped swiftly in their ignorant, "I am the only person on the planet of course I go first" face. Last week, I was waiting for the 1/9 train at Times Square.  I was waiting a while.  Let's say 10 minutes.  10 LONG Monday morning minutes.  When the subway finally arrived, there must have been 30 people waiting to get into one door.  This little foreign woman (I will explain how I know she was foreign in a minute) literally shoves through the crowd, waltzes into the train and grabs the first seat she sees.  This black man who was waiting in line yelled: "Hey!  What are you doing?  Chill out!"  Eventually we all boarded the train, and this black guy sits in the seat across from me.  About halfway through the ride, that little bitch foreign woman gets out of her seat and walks up to the black guy.  She starts in with: "How dare you tell me chill out.  I am woman and deserve respect that all women deserve."  The black man retorts with: "I don't care if you're a woman or not, you don't shove people aside that have been waiting for a train."  In her foreign, broken English voice, she starts freaking out.  "Fuck you!  Woman should always get in train before man.  It's how things get done here.  Are you new to this country?!?!"  The black man sat silent while the woman freaked out on him for a good 3 stops.  Eventually this man had enough and the two engaged in an argument so intense that it made me want to slink away into another subway car.  "Go back to your country you stupid bitch.  Take your crazy poor ass out of here and go back to where you belong."  "Go back to what country?  You black!  This isn't your country.  How dare you raise voice!  I belong in country and you don't!"  Blah blah blah.  It carried on this way until I finally got off the train.  To be honest, I wanted that black guy to rip that self-centered bitch's face off.  I fucking hate people that believe that they are to be the FIRST person on the subway regardless of anyone else's time or position in line.   And I don't hate asians.  It's just that they have green blood and are from a planet I like to call "Chinese".   You see.  And that's that.  There are so many other reasons as to why I hate entering the NYC subway, but this listing is a good start.  We won't even get into the people that WORK for the subway system.  That would take me three days to get off my chest.  ------------------------------------------SHIFTING GEARS--------------------------------------------------  THIS FOLLOWING ENTRY IS PRETTY MUCH DRAMA.  IF YOU READ THIS YOU WILL EITHER BE BORED TO DEATH AT HOW MUCH OF A SILLY LITTLE GIRL I AM OR YOU WILL CRY LIKE  A SHIT BABY.  CUTTHESHIT BABY THAT IS.  On Thursday night, Kelly and I got together (Rita came too) to measure the dimensions of our new apartment.  It was pretty exciting to look at the space again knowing that this is our new home.  We realized during the process that our current furniture set would not fit into the new apartment.  I was pretty upset considering that it is my furniture and I am still not ready to dump it.  Cuz I mean, even the couch has reclining seats in it!  And cup holders!  How could we get rid of it??  But I finally accepted the fact that not only would they not fit into the apartment, the dimensions of the hallway leading up the stairs would not allow it either.  Kelly decided to save the day and purchase a futon.  I was very skeptical of having a futon in our new "classy" apartment, but after seeing what she purchased today, I took a huge sigh of relief and realize once again that I can trust Kelly's decorating skills.  She picked a beauty.  And it gives us more sleeping space for any spontaneious visitors.    We tested the shower, the stove, and picked up the largest dead roach any of us have seen off the floor.  Kelly and I are going to be happy in this apartment. - No.  For real.  Ignore the roach comment.  It was a nuclear fluke.  There are no such things as roaches that big. - And Rita shit herself when she saw the location.  (I loved her excitement at that)  I wasn't kidding folks, we live IN Times Square.  Not near it.  IN it.  And I am very proud of it.  And no, it's not LOUD.  Everyone keeps telling me that it is "too loud" and I always wonder how they know that.  It's not like any of them have lived in this area.  But after being there on Thursday, all of us were in fact relieved that it is NOT loud at all.  In fact, all you can hear is a very faint "hum".  The place is perfect for us.  After the visit to our new pad, the three of us went to have a few drinks at  Siberia .  This bar is where Kelly will be putting up her show in April.  On first site of the bar, I grew extremely uptight.  It is what I like to call "slummin".  Not slammin.  Slummin.  There is graffiti and garbage all over the place.  AND.  And, there is a toilet hanging over the bar by way of chain.  It's hanging from the ceiling from a very large chain.  For real. After the first vodka tonic, the place started to grow on me.  Although everyone in the place was dressed like a skater (me in dress pants and a button down shirt), I felt ironically safe and comfortable.  After the 3rd vodka tonic, I started to fall in love with the place.  And by the 5th vodka tonic, I realized that there is not a place in the world I would rather be, than in  Siberia .  Kelly found the PERFECT space for her show.  Conversation between the three of us was incredibly strained in the beginning.  We were talking about the move, but it was all logistics and nothing personal.  I remember just sitting there wanting to crawl out of my skin.  As the alcohol started to settle in, the talk shifted from business to reality.  Kelly was unbelievably upbeat during the evening and truthfully rescued the evening from spiraling down the tubes.  Before the measuring of the apartment, Rita and I had just come from her goodbye party at work.  Just so you know how down Rita and I were feeling...during Rita's "final words" at the party , sobs took over my body and I stood there in front of all of my co-workers with my chest heaving and my nose running out of my face.  It was hella sad.  We were spent.  So when Kelly confronted the situation during our drink session, it was a chance for Rita and I to open up about how this move has been affecting us.  Kelly acknowledged the fact that although Rita leaving NYC upsets her, she understands that for the two of us, this move is virtually impossible to bear.  It is the first time that I felt like someone got it.  I am constantly having conversations with people who say: "I want Rita to stay.  I am going to miss her so much."  While I am overwhemlingly happy that Rita has formed relationships with these people in order for them to feel this bad, I walk away each time choking back my sadness and end up feeling incredibly alone.  Like no one understands how hard this is for us.    It's not that I want to sit around and cry with everyone about this.    and  It's not that anyone is doing anything wrong.  But OUCH.  This hurts bad.  SO bad.  Any time I have a good moment in my day, a moment that makes me feel genuinely happy, it's cut short with the reminder that Rita has to leave NYC in less than a week.   Let me explain a bit better.    Rita and I have been best friends, in different ways, since the day I met her back at the beginning of our sophomore year of college.  We immediately understood eachother.  Friends like this are so rare to find, but so cherished once you realize you have finally found them.  Through circumstances out of our control, I moved into the apartment she was living in, during our senior year of college.  During this year, Rita and I discovered why we were destined to be best friends.  We have a million memories from that year.  It was like fate slapping you right in the face.  During the peak of its intensity, Rita and I dealt with the feelings of "love" that were developing between us.  Now, memble...I'm gay.  And Rita was the first person that I fully disclosed this to.  It was all very crazy, but very sane at the same time.  When the entire situation exploded around us, Rita and I spent a week not speaking to eachother.  And it tore our worlds up to the core.    At the time, Rita and I were living with 4 other girls all crammed into the same apartment.  (but we all had our own rooms ironically enough)  Because of it being our senior year and because she and I were surrounded by 4 of our best friends, there was never really a chance for us to spend the real time together that we wanted to.  There was never a chance for us to fully discuss and digest everything about our friendship.  At the end of the year, everyone graduated with the exception of me.  (I decided half-way through the year to chuck everything that I worked for into the garbage and to follow my dream as an actor.  I stayed for one more year and finished the entire major in 3 semesters.  All while juggling about 15 shows and becoming the theater club president.  Okay, yes I am tooting my own pathetic horn)  I stayed at school with two of the girls I lived with, but Rita moved back to DC.  There she lived with her parents and got a job teaching at a ballet school.  RANDOM.  But a time period that changed her life.    During my SUPER-Senior year (that's what we 5-year plan losers called it),  Rita and I kept in touch and I basically begged her to move back to where I was going to school.  At the time, she was broken up with her boyfriend.  The same boyfriend that she is moving back to Syracuse next week to be with.  Rita, for many different reasons, did in fact move back to where I was going to school.  During the second semester of my senior year, we became incredibly close again, and I even directed her in a scene I was doing for school.  It was another wonderful chapter in our relationship.    In May of that year, I once again said goodbye to Rita and I moved to Boston to be with my newly found boyfriend, Paul.    I stopped speaking to everyone then.  Including Rita.    That's how I used to do things.  If I moved to a new place, you could consider yourself out of my life.  I couldn't deal with keeping up with friendships that were long distance.  It was too much effort and then it always ended up hurting intensely in the end.  While I was in Boston, Rita sent numerous letters to me.  After never hearing back, she sent the letter that changed our friendship forever.   I remember coming home from work (TGIFriday's) and finding this random envelope in the mailbox.  I saw that it was from Rita and sat down on my bed to read it.  The opening of the letter went something like this:  "I know you aren't going to write back.  I've given up on expecting that.  Instead, what I am going to do is just write what is going on in my life and tell you what I am up to."  There were little comic strips in the letter and cut-outs of magazine pictures asking "Where has Joe gone?" and "Why won't Joe ever give me a call?"  When I got done with the letter, I did what I knew was right.  I called Rita.    From that point on, Rita and I have stayed heavily in touch.  We used to talk about once every couple of weeks until I moved to NYC.  Once there, she and I began to talk about once a week, we visited eachother a couple of times, and then, towards the end of my first year in NYC, I had convinced Rita that she needed to move into my apartment in Queens.  Once again, I had asked Rita to come to where I was.  I knew we needed eachother.    At this point, Rita was back with her boyfriend and she had made a full life for herself in Syracuse.    Rita moved in on December 28th, 2001.  It was the day that changed our relationship, yet again.  Rita got a job at my current place of employment and we began building a little life for ourselves.  We commuted together, we worked together, we went out of the house everywhere together, we were co-joined twins that slept in separate beds at night.  You understand how that works.  Through the year, we have gotten a chance to know eachother in a way that I've never known anyone.  Even with my own boyfriend, we spend most of the day doing other things.  But with Rita, everything we did was together.    This girl understands me so completely.  I can talk about  anything  and she sees exactly where I am coming from.  She has been there for me during each emotional roller coaster ride I took this year.  I cried to her.  I laughed with her.  I fought with her.  We got a chance, for the first time since I've known her, to see what our friendship could really be if given the chance.  And come to find out, it's everything we hoped it would be.    Rita and I have always been very good at putting on an act when we are with other people.  We inherently act as though we are merely just "friends" and go on with our business.  This is why we spend most of our time together alone.  Or with Kelly.  It works best for us when we can truly let go and be ourselves with the other person.  Neither one of us get what we want from our boyfriends, and find that we get that other part from eachother.  I listen to her and she listens to me.  That is something so rare in a person that it should be considered diamond studded gold.    Rita has confronted quite a few of her personal demons while in NYC.    I wanted Rita to move to NYC to live the life that I was living.  Get a shit job in the city and pursue your creative talents.  Drop everything you've been taught and live the bohemian life the best way you know how.  And she did.  She did her absolute best at working the shit job and living as though we have the world at our fingertips.   But eventually, the honeymoon period wears off and Rita was forced to confront one of her biggest life challenges.  "What was her passion in life?"  Being someone that has talents across the board, Rita had a million choices as to which creative direction to go in.  She can sing.  She can act.  She can write.  She is book smart.  She's amazing on a computer.  She knows more about music than anyone I have ever met.  Rita could go with any of these and be successful given her desire to be so.  But it turns out....Rita's passion wasn't being the next Pulitzer Prize winner.  Rita was not to be the next Greta Garbo.  Rita didn't want the fast paced, overly aggressive life of NYC.   Rita was to a wife and mother.  Rita wanted a family.  Being someone that grew up in a military family, Rita has always struggled with the concept of settling down.  She is accustomed to moving and starting over.  When things get boring or they get too tough, move and start a new life.  She does physically what I do emotionally.  You run away.  So, one night in Mid-November, Rita and I sit around after work and had a couple glasses of wine.  (We are notorious for talking serious AND have also been known to spend three nights a week in front of the television while never turning it on.  Hours spent talking ourselves hoarse)  During our discussion that night, Rita discloses that she has found her passion.  She wants to start her family and at 25 years old, doesn't want to wait any longer.  She is in love with her boyfriend, unconditionally, and she knows that he is the one that she needs to be with.    After discussing this with her, we came to the conclusion that she needed to live NYC and move back to be with him.  It was a beautiful talk and one that neither she nor I will never forget.  We kept the secret for a couple of weeks, only telling Kelly at one point.  Rita was giving herself time to settle with the decision and didn't want to have to re-tell everyone that she was staying instead of moving.  You know how it is.    As last year came to a close, it was set in stone that Rita was leaving.    AND THIS IS HOW I REALLY FEEL.  (although incredibly long winded.  my bad.  snore.  read it or don't read it.  i don't give a shit)  As the weeks have gotten closer to Rita's departure, all of us have had moments of emotional insanity.  Kelly had the first breakdown a week or so ago and it was then that I realized that it was all really happening.  Since that Sunday night, I have not felt okay.  I find that I am suprisingly strong on the outside.  It seems as though I am just going about my business.  Yet, deep down, I find myself losing my shit hardcore style.  I don't want Rita to leave.  I felt so positive and unselfish about it before, but now I am panicking.  I've spent the last year of my life married to someone and now they are leaving.  I am so accustomed to the way we do things and the thought of always having her around.  No matter what...Rita was ALWAYS there.  She is the epitomy of "being able to count on someone".  And now...she moves 5 hours away.    I'm scared to be alone.  I'm scared not to have her here to ask every little thing to.  I have become so dependent on her for everything.  She IS my self-esteem.  She IS the clarity to every crisis I have.  She IS my foundation.  I'm not saying that what I have with my other close people isn't wonderful, cuz without it, I would truly be lost.  The point of this beast of an entry is to clearly show for once and for all why Rita's leaving is making everything around me change so drastically that I feel like I am starting over.   And I am doing it on my own.    We will never live together again.  I will never hear her puttering around the house before I get out of bed again.  There will be no more random glasses of water forgotten around the house.  I won't see those red sneakers every day.  No more pizza fridays.  No more 6:30-7:30pm Simpson viewings.  No more falling asleep on the couch at the same time.  No more sitting on the couch together for hours at an end crying and sharing and laughing together.  (yes, everything we did involved the couch)  The only thing that gives me comfort throughout this whole thing, is knowing that she feels exactly the same way.   There is no doubt in my mind that she is struggling mind, body, and soul with the decision she has made.   Rita loves me and I know that this distance kills her insides just as much as it kills mine.  This was our last weekend together.  Last night we did our Friday ritual of renting movies and buying groceries and vegging out in front of the television.  We went to bed around 10pm and I spent a good majority of my remaining evening staring at my bedroom wall.  Today we watched like 3 more movies together and had plans to go out drinking.  We layed around all weekend and although completely unspoken, so many emotions ran through our hearts.  At one point Rita informed me that she didn't want to go out anymore.  I panicked.  I told her that I still wanted to go out.  That I couldn't stay in the house for the whole weekend.  She was amazingly cool with it and explained "I am bugging out.  I can't go out tonight."  I responded with "Well, okay, but I still gotta get out of the house."  About 10 minutes later, Rita apologizes again for not wanting to go out and all I say back is "I totally understand.  But I still want to get out of the house."  She again handles it wonderfully and turns back to the television.  We sit quietly and finish the movie we are watching.  I get in the shower and think about what is happening.  She doesn't want to go out because this whole thing is hitting her hard today.  I feel myself start to lose my cool and I begin to lose it in the shower.  I don't know how to help her with this.  I hurt too bad to ask her to talk about it.  For the first time since I have known her, I can't ask her to tell me how she is feeling because I am afraid that I will lose my defense and break entirely.  I stay in the shower until I feel like I have regained control.  I decide to ask her to play "Boggle" and then maybe bring up why she is feeling so bad.    I come out of the bathroom and go into my room to dress.  About 15 minutes later I emerge and Rita has gone to bed.    Over the next hour I debated what to do.  I knew that I didn't want to go out anywhere with her feeling like this.  I stood in front of her door and just listened.  I walked around and played with the cat.  I even sat and had a cigarette or three on the couch and thought "if she comes out, I will catch her and sit her down to talk."  But she didn't come out and I didn't go in.    Gosh, this is hard.  Almost impossible.  I feel just as bad as her and instead of confronting it so that we both could release a bit, I run away to my bedroom and get onto the computer to type this entry.  I have been typing for over two hours now and while I thought that it would help, it hasn't.  I still want to go into her room, climb in bed with her and just let her cry to me.    But I don't know if I can.    She and I have handled this whole thing very maturely.  But we haven't confronted it with eachother because we are both afraid that it will debilitate us when we know we have so much to do.  To get this move done successfully.      I guess this is all I have to say.   This is where Rita and I are at now with the big change that is happening.    I had to lay some of it down.    There's just so much...

      OOOH!  ONE MORE THING! As if life wasn't ironic enough...remember how I called the "Gap" yesterday to see if I could go by to get my paychecks?  Well, I was fucking nervous to confront the situation, but I did.  I know it all turned out well, but before I called, I nearly had diarhea in my khakis.  Then I get home last night and my paychecks are sitting in the mailbox!  I mean!  Are we fucking serious?  If I had just waited one more day, I wouldn't have had to talk to them at all.  Whatever.  It felt good to be an adult and confront the situation head-on.   Plus, if I hadn't called, I guarantee that God wouldn't have allowed the paychecks to come so soon.  He wanted me to be a man about it.  I just know it.

      Today is the most beautiful day of the year.    The sun is shining.  The birds are chirping.  And all of the snow is turning into a flood that is wiping away all the homeless people, subway garbage, and even venereal diseases.  Its pretty great.  You almost dont need a jacket.  Isnt it weird how when its summer, a 46 degree day could kill a man, but in the winter, a 46 degree day will warm up your balls?  I dont really understand metaphysics, but Im willing to write it off as gaylord.    Can you tell that I am in a good mood today?  I dont feel as tired as I have felt all week.  I dont feel as emotionally beaten down.  I just feel plain good.  Having Paul stay at my place last night was the fucking best.  Rita made Breakfast for Dinner and we ate like hogs.           I made brownies for my two roomies and Paul managed to shove half the pan in his face before we went to bed.  Paul has this theory about brownies.  Brownies are a dessert that you eat periodically through the evening.  Its best to get started early, so that the pan can be finished and cleaned before bed.   Hmm.  Sick.   Paul and I literally laughed all night long and when we went to bed we continued to do the same.    We didnt even come close to hooking up, which is something he and I are working through right now.  But there is also another reason why we havent been touching.  You see, I use this steroid cream on my dick to get rid of this little patch of dry skin that I have.  I use a little every couple of days.  Well, on Sunday, I put extra steroid cream on the head of my dick and then on Monday morning I did the same thing.  By Monday evening, I had completely destroyed my cock.  When I woke up on Tuesday, I noticed that I had a SHEET of skin pealing off my dick.  When I play with the skin on and around my penis, it crinkles and looks like the top layer of a pan of brownies.  Its fucking gross and Rita says that I need to start wearing underwear again.  Someone please help my yiddle cock and balls.   In other news, Rita and I are meeting up with Kelly to measure our apartment tonight.  I am excited to see the place again.  I havent been back there since we first saw it.  How exciting!  Todays a good day for looking at apartments and going to happy hour afterwards.  Oh.  Did I mention that we were going to happy hour afterwards?  Cuz we are going to happy hour afterwards.  How fun to be able to scope out our new neighborhood!  We were originally going to have dinner together, but as Kelly said today: Im just lovin liquid dinners!  Yem!  Just got off the phone with Mariah.  Dammit she is being super amazing about this whole moving thing.  She will be at my apartment on Thursday night to help with any last minute packing.  Then she is getting up bright and early with us Friday morning in order to help us move our shit to Times Square.  She is being incredibly sensitive to my feelings about this whole thing.  I have so few friends in the city and now is the time when I need them to come through for me.  And so far, they all are.  Paul has stepped up to the plate.  Mariah is there for me WHENEVER I need her.  Everyone at work is asking lots of questions and being very supportive.  And then there is my brother and parents who are nothing, but excited for me and for this whole process.  I told Mariah how badly I needed her to be around after Rita moves; that I am not going to have many people to hang out with since Paul and Kelly both work evenings.  She gets out of work at 6pm every day and she told me that it takes her 15 minutes to get to Times Square.  She has volunteered to sleep over and to take me out whenever I want.  I feel very lucky to have these people be so wonderful to me.  Hey, if you arent going to have more than 5 friends in NYC, its best that they be GREAT ones.  And they are.    Kelly is very lucky to have the life that she does in the city.  She has a ton of friends, a new theater company that she is working on, and a great job.  I want to have the same stuff to keep me busy.  This move will hopefully provide me with that same type of lifestyle.  I am very proud of Kelly for achieving this for herself.  If I can just focus on that, then maybe this move wont be so damn hard.  Thats why we are moving anyway.  Its time to get down to business in this city.  I seem to be the only one who hasnt started anything.  Now, its my turn.  In any caseRitas going away party for work is in an hour.  Of course I am planning the entire thing.  Now I must go buy her a cake and Clementines . Her two favorite pleasures!    ROCK OUT GIRLS OF 21ST STREET!

      So, I dont know what the deal is  I just called the Gap to find out when I could go in to pick up my last paycheck.  I spoke to two managers and both were very excited to hear from me.  OMIGOD Joe!  Where have you been?  We want to see you!blah blah blah.  I then asked to talk to the head manager (manager on duty) and she and I had the following conversation:  Manager on duty:  Joe!  How have you been? Me:  Good.  I was wondering when would be a good time for me to come in to pick up my remaining paychecks. MOD:  Well, first I want to let you know that we miss you greatly around here, but we are also a little upset that you werent as communicative over the last two months as you should have been. Me:  Yes, I know.  I apologize for that.  Its been a crazy couple of months, but I think things have finally settled down and now I am ready to get back into the swing of things. MOD:  Great.  Well, why dont you come by the office and we will fill out a new availability form for you and we can get you started right away. Me:  Oh.  Actually, I wasnt planning on returning to work there.  Thank you for everything youve done for me, but I am going to have to say no.   MOD:  I am very sorry to hear that.   Well, come by to get your paychecks and if you want to work here in the future, just ask to speak to me. Me:  Thank you very much.  I do appreciate it. MOD:  Bye Joe. Me:  BYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!  OK.WHA?!?!?!  Rita called and quit for me over two months ago.  And I havent contacted them since.  And they STILL want me to work there?  One of the managers told me that I made a very good impression on them and they missed having me around the store.  UmI worked there for 5 weeks.   I cant believe them.  I feel bad now.  They are so good to me.  I will have to make sure not to burn this bridge.  I mean, what if I need a retail job in the future?    HA!  NEVER!    Anyway  Today has been incredibly stressful at work.  So much to do and so little time to do it.  Of course I refuse to stay any later than 5pm.  I mean, seriously.  Pay me what I am worth and then I will make sure everything is taken care of.  But they have chosen to pay me peanuts.  So I never stay late. You pay for what you get. Grrrrr  Tomorrow night, Kelly and I show Rita our new apartment.  We are going to take some measurements, so we can figure out what we are keeping and what we are throwing away.  I reserved our Budget truck today and it seems as though everything is going pretty smoothly.  I just gotta make sure we get enough boxes for all of our shit.  And at some point I should probably get my act together with all of this.  I have yet to take even one picture off of my bedroom walls.  I dont want to start the process, cuz then the move becomes reality.  And who wants to deal with this reality?    Paul wasnt able to stay at my apartment last night.  He ended up having to work until real late.  He said he will stay tonight, but who knows I loved his card and flowers yesterday.  It made my whole day.  But what I really want is for him to be around a bit more.  I need  him  right now.  Not flowers.  About 10 minutes until I go home.  Rita and I are making dinner tonight.  I think we are having hangar steaks or something.  She is doing most of the cooking and I am doing most of the eating.    Okayso get this shit!  Just as I start typing about Paul not being around a lotthe phone rings at work!  Paul got off his shift for tonight and is coming over right after work!  Now he will be able to eat dinner with Rita and I!  UMWHAT IS GOING ON!?!?!  Yesterday I was writing about how Paul fucked up the night before and really upset me.  As I was writing the entry, Paul showed up at work with the flowers and the card.  Then just now, I am typing about him and me not seeing him and he calls and says that he is going right over to my apartment at 6ish.   Are he and I on some sort of psychic connection these days??   Yay. I am so happy to be able to spend the night with him.    YAY!  Alrighttime to go piss and get on the subway.  Although I could wait and do it right on the train.  No one would know.  This city smells like piss and fart all the time anyway.   Latas!

      CAN YA BELIEVE THE AMOUNT OF SNOW IN NYC??? DAYIM!    I woke up, yesterday morning, at 7am to find that the city had been buried under about 18 inches of snow.  I looked out the front window of our apartment and saw that not one car was brave enough to tackle the treacherous roads.  It was at that point that I called Rita on her cell phone (from the house phone) to tell her that there was no way that we would be going to work.  After a few phone calls, Rita and I were in for our first and only snow day of the year.  We put on some jackets and gloves and went to the deli to get ourselves some soup and soda.  Once we got back to the apartment, we were happy to find Kelly sitting on my bed, excited for the snow day to begin.  We all got under blankets and watched  Minority Report .    I fell immediately back to sleep, so happy to be in my bed on a Monday morning.  Kelly and Rita watched the movie as I lay snoring my face off.  I woke up sometime around 1:30pm to find them gone from my room.  I climbed out of bed to find Kellys sister, Aly, and her 5 teenage girl friends chilling in our living room.  (They had come down for a whirlwind 48-hour visit)  The rest of the day was spent drinking beers and playing cards.  I had a very good time and I know that Kelly was happy that Rita and I spent the day with her sisters friends.    I havent seen Paul since Friday night and I was really missing him yesterday.  I was supposed to go over to his place on Sunday night, but I was pretty hungover from the night out with Joanna and frankly, I want to spend as much time in my house as possible these days.  Paul was a bit pissed that I didnt go over to his place, but was still planning on staying at my pad last night.  I must have called him 37 times yesterday trying to figure out what time he was coming over.  At about 9:30pm I started to give up and assumed that he was ditching me, the way I ditched him on Sunday.    Paul called around 10:30pm to check in.    Here was our conversation:  Me:  Hey.  Where have you been?  Ive been calling all day. Paul:  Sleeping.  It was a long night at work and I just wanted to come home and take a nap. Me:  So, should I assume that you arent coming over? Paul:  Yeah.  I dont feel like it.  Im still pretty tired.   Me:  Paul, whats wrong?  You knew how badly I wanted to see you today. Paul:  I wanted to see YOU last night and you wanted to stay home. Me:  First of all, I am at your place at least triple the amount of times that you come to mine.  Paul, you know I n------!!!!!!  (As I was typing this entry, Paul came into my office with a card and flowers.  He just showed up.  He never does that.  Wow.  What he did just now is why I am with him.  How amazing.)  Basically, I tried to explain to Paul last night that I really need him right now and that I dont feel like he wants to be there for me.  Eventually I started sobbing to him on the phone about how sad I was and that with each day ending, we are one day closer to moving out of our apartment in Queens.  At the peak of my crying, I said: I just feel like the world is crumbling around me.  Paul responded by saying: Oh Joe, you are so dramatic.  The world is NOT crumbling around you.  At that point, I hung up on him.  I lay there in my bed crying and crying for about 15 more minutes.  I took the phone off the hook and forced myself to try to go to sleep.  At 1:30am, I was still awake and miserable.  I put the phone back on the hook and stared at the ceiling until much after 2am, when I finally drifted off.    When I woke up this morning, not only was I exhausted, I just felt emotionally void.  Its been awhile since Ive cried so much, on such a regular basis.  The pain of Ritas move keeps getting more intense and Im almost at the point where I just want the move date to come so that all of this aching will go away.  I know she feels the same.  This is the hardest thing I have had to deal with in a long time.    While I know that this move to Manhattan is good for me While I know that Rita needs to move back to Syracuse in order to give her life new direction While I know that everything happens for a reason.  I cant convince myself that I want all of this to happen.  It seems like just yesterday that we all made the decision to move on.  Cept it wasnt yesterday.  It was November.  And March seemed years away.  Now we are nearing the one-week point and I feel as though the weight of sadness just gets increasingly more unbearable.    I am not one to sit around and talk about how I am feeling.  At least not when the feelings are so intensely bad.  I usually run away.  I hide in my room, or I stay over at a friends apartment and I ignore that which I need to confront.  This time, however, I care too much about Rita leaving to spend even a second away from her.  I dont want to hide.  And I surely dont want her to have to deal with this alone.  Surely its not the end of the world.    But days like today give me a whole in my chest the size of Vesuvius.  Thats MT. Vesuvius, just in case you were wondering.  Itll all be ok.  Itll all be fine.   :(  I just read Pauls card.  Here is what it says:   Joseph,  (He always calls me by my full name)  I do not always seem sensitive to situations, but I apologize about that.  I know what you are going through and how it feels.  It hurts so bad to lose someone who is so close to you!  (I have been through it)  I want you to know that I am here for you.  I will try to make more of an effort to be with you during this trying time.  I have been selfish and I am sorry! I miss you so much right now, but I feel like I do not deserve your presence.  There is a reason for everything, and only time heals.   Take one day at a time and prepare yourself for the future.  You have so many people around you that love you.  You just have to allow them to do that!! Keep your chin up and look for the positives and new beginning.  I love and care about you SO much Joe Cut the Shit.    Love,   Paul     Of course, because I am a lame ass crybaby, I got choked up the minute I read what he wrote.  Pauls not big on saying things from the heart.  But this time he got me good.  He totally made up for our fight last night and even more importantly, he has made me feel comforted in the fact that he is in love with me and that I really am not alone.  Thank God for him.  Oh!  Just so you know, Paul DID in fact give me a Valentines Day gift this year.  He got me flowers, some candy (fat free of course), a pair of Jeans from Armani Exchange, and also a shirt from Express.  Mens Express.  Yes, it really does exist.  I loved the clothes, but even more so, I loved the fact that Paul made the effort to make my Valentines Day extra special.  It was a wonderful day for us.  It went smoothly and for the first time in 3 years, I had a beautiful V-Day.  So thats that.    Kinda got a lot going on.  So grateful for this journal.  Its like the only sane thing in my life these days.    Its the one place where I can truly release.

       urlLink HOLLA!   Sup dawgs!?!?  I came into work furious today and for some reason I am in a slamming good mood right now.  I think it might have something to do with the amazing phone conversation I had with Mariah, but I'm not entirely sure.  She informed me that not only is she meeting me out for drinks before Paul's birthday adventure, she is also staying over at his apartment with me too!  AMAZING.  I was really dreading going to this bar with Paul tonight.  It is a cruisey, slimy, and horrible bar, but it's "All-you-can-drink for $10".  I mean, really.  How can I complain.  Thing is, Paul doesn't take care of me while we are there.  He is busy watching  Boys Gone Wild  on the mini-televisions while I give angry looks to all of the old men who undress me with their eyes.  The place is sick and I was completely UN-excited.  But now that Mariah is going to go to the bar with us AND staying over at his place, there is no worry.  The three of us get along like baby triplets.  Tonight is sure to be a blast.  Rita and I drove to work today cuz she has to leave at 4pm to go to Syracuse.  She's got a lot to do in the next couple of days.  Does the whirlwind ever stop?  Parking the car in the city this morning was complete and utter beastmaster.  I had to leave her in the car in order to make it up to the office on time.  Rita came in flustered and hating life about 45 minutes later.  If I were her, I probably would have driven down Broadway and all the way home.  Yet, here we all are.  My bosses, Ari, Rita and myself.  One big mother fucking family.   can we leave now?  During my lunch break today, I must go get Paul's Valentines and birthday gifts. What I need to do is cut this bush of a hair-style I got goin.  Unfortunately, I don't have nearly enough time to do that.  I know I am buying him an alarm clock for his bedroom.  And also a box of chocolates.  (Gotta stick to some sort of tradition here.)  I also need to get him a card, an electric toothbrush, and maybe a cup of my cum.  You know how it goes.  I am sure Paul is spending most of his free time shopping for me, so yeah... go fuck yourself Joe.  You ain't gettin shit.  Paul is currently working at two jobs right now.  One of the jobs is for a darling little restaurant in the East Village.  He is waiting tables and he absolutely hates being there.  Total amount of money he has made at this job in the last week: $350.   The other job Paul has is as a bartender for a very expensive chain restaurant in Hell's Kitchen.  He loves the job there and the people have been treating him very well.  He has already started to build a semi-regular clientele.  Total amount of money Paul made there on Monday night: $400.  You read that right.  400 fucking dollars for 7 hours of work.  Now.  While I was extremely happy for him and filled with relief, I explained that he should ditch this "serving" job and work only as a bartender.  "But I don't work at the bar enough and I need to make as much money as I can."  Fine.  Makes sense.  Cept today, he has to go late to the bar job because he is working as a waiter during the day.  I told him that he should really think again about only working as the bartender.  "Your bar job is not going to give you the shifts you want if they know that they are competing with another employer."   Paul responds with:  "YOU are the last person I want to talk to about this right now."  huh?  What did  I  do??  I just gave my opinion.  Obviously Paul was a bit stressed out this morning.  I just let it go and got off the phone. Damn birthday boy.  You gonna get some fucking birthday spanks later.   right in the face!  So what else?  I have an apartment in Times Square.  Oooooh yes!  Hmmm....last night for dinner I had chicken cutlets slathered with macaroni and cheese (sharp cheddar style).  Yeah it was fucking good.  After I ate it, I laid clutching my stomach for about 20 minutes.  For some reason I thought that I had salmonilla, but then realized that it was gluttony and I then I just laid there embarrassed.  Stop it Joe.  Eat granola and apples like real little boys.  My mom sent me the most adorable Valentine's Day package.  In it was tons of candy and a secret surprise.  The surprise was a special St. Patick's Day package.  What is my mom?  The best?  I haven't opened the St. Patty's package yet.  I am saving it for tomorrow.  If Paul doesn't get me anything, at least I can count on my mom.  Too bad it's sick and against the law to marry your mother.  Then I would have gifts for every special event!  Ugh.  I sent her a teddy bear and thank you bag for her V-day gift.  I never usually send her anything.  I just take her gifts and say thank you.  But this year, I wanted to do something for her.  Unfortunately, my parents 27th anniversary is on the 21st.  More money to spend that I don't have.  Whatever.  I am getting really good at budgeting my money these days.  It's like I am waiting for the other shoe to drop.  Why do I have my money in order?  Is there a secret bill out there calling my name?  Please don't find me.  I like having enough my money to get by.  At least until I move into Manhattan. YIPES.  Okay...back to work.  Leaving soon to buy my boy some special gifts.   :)

      WELL!   WE GOT THE APARTMENT!!!!!!   Kelly and I just finished interviewing with the landlord and signing the lease!  OMIGODOMIGODOMIGODOMIGODOMIGODYAY! I can't believe this.  Not only are we going to live in Manhattan, we are living in TIMES SQUARE!  Gosh.  This is about the best thing to happen to me in forever.  I was praying so feverishly that this would work out.  I prayed that if it was God's will, we would get this place.  AND IT WAS GOD'S WILL and WE GOT THE PLACE!  Man, I am overwhelmed with joy and relief.  Just so we all know, there is a LAZAR TAG place right across the street from my new apartment AND there is a McDonald's RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER!  And they DELIVER!  AY YI YI! I don't know.  This is all just so great.  Thank you God!  Thank you Kelly's parents!  Thank you my parents!  And just...well...thank you.    Tonight I am going home and nursing this headache and weary body of mine.  I need some sleep.  Paul informed me earlier today that he wants to go out tomorrow night for his birthday.  I explained that I have to work on Friday morning and couldn't go and his reply was: "IT'S MY BIRTHDAY!!!"  So yeah.  I will be going out with Paul tomorrow night.  And want to hear the best part?  We aren't even going out until 11:30pm.  Ugh.  But he IS the birthday boy.    Okay...back to work.    Days like today are so hard to come by.   Thank you again Lord.

      Do I dare show my face in here?    I mean, I have been gone for so long, there is no way that you don't hate me.   Ah well.   At least I can't see or hear your anger and resentment.  I will just pretend as though you don't really feel that way.  (snickers)  SO HI! Gosh.  Where do I begin?  So much shit is going down right now and in order to explain it all, I am going to have to do a brief synapsis of each thing.  Ok?  Ok.  Let 'er rip!  1)  First, foremost, and most importantly, Rita is leaving NYC, two weeks from Saturday.  She has been feverishly looking for a new job/apartment in Syracuse and today she found out that she has accomplished half of her goal.  She and her boyfriend, Andy, will be living in what we hope will be a beautiful little house with a white picket fence and maybe a swingset in the backyard.  Well, maybe not a swingset just yet...but we can still hope.  She has two job interviews lined up for this Friday and if all goes well, she will be employed AND have a place to rest her pretty little red head.  So, while she is hastily making plans to move, Kelly and I are doing the same.  We have found a charming place right in the heart of Times Square.  Can ya believe it?!?!  The place is extremely small, but the bedrooms are both a good size and the bathroom is bigger than the one we currently have.  The refridgerator?  Yeah, it's in the living room.   This is the first apartment Kelly and I looked at and we knew immediately that we wanted to jump on it.  I mean...it's in the heart of Times Square!  What am I?  Big and important now???  I don't want to jinx it.  Kelly and I are meeting with the landlord today at 2:30pm to sign the lease.  God willing, it will all go well.  I must admit, the apartment is a bit out of our price range, but I think we have figured out a way to make it work.  Please keep us in your prayers.  Not only would I be proud to live in this place...our apartment search will be completed.  Then we can just stress about moving and that's it!  2)  I have been having quite a few emotional breakdowns these days.  Kelly had a big attack on Sunday and Rita and I both sat there knowing exactly how she felt.  I just think that we aren't ready yet to confront this "moving" thing head on.  Paul has been ironically supportive throughout this entire period.  I rarely cry with him, but over the last two weeks, I find that the minute he asks me how the "move" is going, I break down into hysterics.  Last night he came over to my place to sleep and within 20 minutes I was sobbing about how I can't handle the fact that Rita is leaving.  He just sits there saying: "I know" and "We'll get through it".  I sit there with tears flowing out of my face.  Eventually I just fell asleep with Paul holding me.  Tears staining my pillow.   (or was that a jizz stain I saw this morning?)  I know that Rita and Kelly feel these emotions too.  Yet still, I am most concerned about me right now.  I have never hurt this bad over someone leaving.  Am I going to be alright?  3)  I met someone who reads my site!  My good friend, Randy, came to NYC last Friday and he met up with Rita, Paul, and I at Jakes for some cheap drinks.  I was hella nervous and vomited five times on the subway. Ok, it was invisible vomit, but it still smelled like shit!  I didn't know what I was going to think of him and was unsure as to the idea of connecting (in person) with a reader.  In any case, the meeting went better than I could have ever imagined.  Randy is quite adorable and has the personality of a genius.  He made me laugh and more importantly, made me so comfortable with him.  As we know, I have about zero gay male friends, and this kid is someone I hope will become my first!  He is moving to NYC soon and will be applying to graduate school.  I was impressed and relieved to know that my instincts were not wrong about this fella.  Randy is amazing and he won the "Rita stamp of approval".  Paul, on the otherhand, was a fucking weirdo all night and barely said two words.  He sat there like a jealous bitch and couldn't break out of the funk to become a part of the conversation at any point.  In the cab, he and I had a little spat about it and I can tell you that he definitely didn't get his dick sucked that night!   or the night after.  4)  Last night I spent two hours on the phone with Mariah's roommate, Jo.  I called to talk to Mariah and two hours later, Jo informs me that she wasn't at home.  I have always really liked Jo, but never have the chance to see her.  This weekend all of my friends are either busy working or away in Syracuse, so I made plans to hang out with her.  We are to have drinks in the city sometime around 9pm.  How great?!!?!  She is one of the easiest people to talk to and I believe that she truly understands me when I open my mouth.  I talked to her alot about Rita moving and she was nothing short of incredible about the whole thing.  She let me get it off my chest and she gave me some wonderful words of encouragement.  I think I am truly going to enjoy having her around once Rita takes off.  I have very few friends in the city that I like to see on a regular basis and Jo is going to be one of them.  I just know it!    5)  I decided to keep my site the way it is.  There will be no password blocking and I am not changing the link.  I am doing my best at retaining my restored faith in people, but it is quite a challenge.  As long as y'all behave yourselves.  You know who you are!   winkles!  6)  Paul's birthday is Friday.  Yes, it's also on Valentine's Day.  I get screwed each year!  (not like I don't get screwed even when it's  not  his birthday.  To start out the day, I ordered this  urlLink Aphrodesiac Garden  for him.  He LOVES plants and LOVES taking care of them.  (maybe if I were a garden, he would tend to me a bit better...)  This surprise should be delivered to him early in the day.  I think he will really like it.  After work, I am going to his apartment to take him out to a sushi lunch.  After that we will probably have a nice nap and cuddle on the couch.  I still have to make dinner reservations for us, but with it being Valentine's Day, I have no idea where we are going to go.  Every place will be so crowded and I don't want to make the same mistake I did last year.    urlLink Click here to read February 15th's entry from last year.   Being gay and going out to dinner on Valentine's Day is always a challenge.  I just have to make sure that this year we do it right.  Fuck you AGAIN  Bill's Gay Nineties !  Fucking lame ass old people homophobic bad karma livin douchebags. So we will see!  I still gotta go buy him some special little gifts.  Please God let him do something nice for me.  That's probably it for right now.  I'm sure there's more, but right now I gotta get some shit done.    BTW, I upgraded to Blogger Pro and then immediately asked for a refund.  Be careful folks.  You will not get what you wish for.    Alrighty...wish me luck at my lease signing!!!  If this works out today, I will be very pleased.  I can't believe that I could really be living in the heart of Times Square!  This location will be so convenient for when I get into my numerous Broadway shows.  I mean, I can just walk out of the stage door and into my home in a matter of minutes.  (Big sigh)  Can I be in a Broadway show now?  and boom.

      Hello.  Where have I been?  I know.  I am sorry for what I have done.  I have left you without any warning.  BUT  I have decided to re-work this site.  All I ask is that you give me a couple more days to do it.    I hate having to ask you to wait and keep checking back, but I have an idea and I think it will work well for the both of us. You understand.  Don't you?  I appreciate any and all traffic to this site.  I want you to keep coming.  But with my life being in a place of chaos, I can't afford this journal to do the same.  I am fixing things.  Please come back to me.

      Back from my weekend at home and sitting at my desk  Unfortunately, this weekend didnt turn out the way that I thought it would.  I was  so  excited to be with my parents and  so  excited to be out of NYC that I really believed getting away would be the best release.  And to tell the truth, the first 10 minutes of the trip was indeed that way.    After we finished dinner on Friday night, my dad informed my mother and I that he had something he needed to tell us.  In unison, we all lit up cigarettes and listened to my dad tell us how my brother has received new orders and will be shipping out to Baghdad on Easter Sunday.  Originally, we were told that he would be a part of a peace-keeping mission and that he wouldnt go to war for at least a couple more months.  According to my father, my brother burst into tears on the phone with him and went on and on about how scared and angry he is at this war.  He was so together about it before, but now that its becoming a reality, he doesnt want anything to do with it.  He doesnt want to fight.  He doesnt want to kill.  He is the boy we knew he was all along.    Hearing that Winfield is so upset and frightened made us even that much more depressed.  After my dad relayed the news to us, my mom immediately started to cry.  The news hit me like a ton of bricks and all I could was sit there stone-faced and stare at my father, the words going in one ear and out the other.  I had no idea how to comprehend the idea that my little brother would be going to Baghdad.      We sat and discussed the scenario for a little bit and then we all agreed that it would be best to put it out of our minds for the rest of the evening.  Winfield was to call on Saturday and we would discuss it with him then.  Slowly, but surely, we got drunk and had a good time together.    When I went to bed on Friday night, I watched my usual 15-minute dosage of CNN to catch up on any developing news that I might have missed.  I ended up sitting on my bed, wracked with sobs for a very long time.  I was so angry and frustrated and I felt as though I wanted to tear my bedroom up into a million pieces.  It took all the strength I had not to destroy everything in arms reach.  The pain and anguish I felt was so intense.  As the tears flowed, I clenched my hands as tight as I could, punched my legs over and over, and well, did whatever I could to make the pain go away.  Eventually I burned myself out and I lay down exhausted from allowing all of this emotion to flow out of my body.    On Saturday, we did in fact go see a movie and out to dinner.  It was a nice day, but each one of us was carrying a heavy heart the entire time.  Winfield didnt end up calling and we assumed that he was too upset to talk to us.    Just before we left for the movie, we were all sitting in my living room watching TV.  Out of nowhere, my mom starts crying and crying.  She kept saying: This hurts too bad.  I dont think I can do this.  What are we going to do??  My dad remained calm and somehow I managed to keep my act together too.  We let her cry herself out and comforted her in the best way that we could.  Watching my mom cry in desperation was one of the worst moments I have ever had in my life.  She seemed so helpless and afraid.  And it was exactly how I was feeling.  Eventually, my mom pulled herself together and we all hugged each other for a very long time.  I said: We have to stick together on this.  No one can deal with this alone.  Saturday night was probably the most relaxing time of the whole weekend, but it was still filled with underlying anxiety.  I went to bed at 11:30pm and watched mindless TV until I could finally fall asleep.    Yesterday was tough.    I had lunch with my parents before I left to go back to NYC.  They made tacos, cuz they know how much I love them.  I dont know how I found the appetite, but I did and ended up shoving my face with a lot of Mexican before I got on the train.  When I hugged my mom goodbye, we held each other for longer than usual.  She told me to call her if I ever need to talk.  She told me that she loves me more than I will ever know.  She told me to be safe.  And then I turned and left the house.  My dad picked up Mariah and we went to the train station.  The mood in the car was rather somber, but we got through it.  Mariah could tell that something was up, but waited until I said goodbye to my dad to inquire about it.  My dad, like my mom, held me for a long time at the train station.  The tears threatened to overwhelm me, so I kissed him and said goodbye.  I turned and walked away without looking back.    I informed Mariah of the latest news and she was incredibly supportive.  We only spoke about it for a couple of minutes as I found that I couldnt keep my shit together.  She hugged me for a bit and then we decided to get some beer on the train.  For the ride home, we did our best to make up games and laugh.  It worked for the most part, but the minute I got off the train, I just wanted to get into bed.  I walked from Port Authority in the rain.  The last place that I wanted to be was in NYC.  If I could have found any excuse for staying in Albany, I would have.  I cant stand the thought of my parents having to go through all of this alone.   I cant stand having to be separated from them during this time.  Winfield is the love of our lives and I know that the only thing any of us want right now is for things to go back to being normal.    I got home around 7pm and immediately went to my room.    I called my parents as soon as I walked through my bedroom door and they informed me that my brothers leave date has been postponed again.   He is tentatively leaving on May 10th now.  GOD!  I was relieved, but also exasperated at this stupid ARMY that breaks your heart 50 times before they actually break it for real.  My parents were very positive on the phone and told me that the later he goes into battle, the better chance there is for his safety.  They also told me that Winfield worked 15-hour days on both Saturday and Sunday and that was the reason for his not calling.    And I guess thats about it.    I feel like I am made of glass today.  I am barely holding it together.  The only thing I want is to be left alone.  I feel warn down and I think that if I am pushed in any way, I might break and fall apart completely.  The last thing I want to do is talk about any of this with any of my friends.  My Uncle Brad just called to talk about the California plans for this summer and I had to tell him that today was not the day to discuss it.  I got the feeling that he felt bad having me push him off, but I just didnt want to talk.    I plan on leaving work tonight and spending the evening with Paul.  He is the only person I want to see right now.  Maybe after I reconnect with him, I will feel a bit more rejuvenated.  He is the only person that I want to hug me and he is the only one that I want to cry to.  If I didnt have him right now, I dont know what I would do.    The war has only been going on for two weeks yet my emotions feel stretched to the limits, as though it has been going on for months.  I am worried and I am sad.  I feel helpless and like I cant get control over anything in my life.  When all I want to do is protect my brother, I find that I can do nothing, but pray.   My mom said one thing this weekend that struck me so deeply.  She said: Without faith in God, how would we ever be able to deal with this? And she is so right.  If I didnt have God to go to and to count on, there would be no way that I could look at any of this in a positive light.  God is in control and I have to trust that his plan will be done.  He will protect Winfield and he will keep us all sane.    But for now, I dont want to talk about it.    For now, I want to heal myself from the inside out.

      FRIDAY FRIDAY FRIDAY FRIDAY FRIDAY FRIDA KAHLO  Rock out!  I leave in an hour to go to Port Authority.  I am very VERY excited to go home this weekend.  Not leaving the city since Christmas has really taken its toll on me.  I think this may have been the longest I have ever gone without leaving the 5 boroughs.  And with the spring weather hitting us, I am even more excited to be in the fresh, open, Albany air.  Gosh, the boner I am sporting is HUGE.  YAY.  Tonight is Wasted Night with my parents.   Tomorrow, we are going to the food court in the mall and then off to watch a movie.  My parents love the food court in the mall and I must admit, so do I.  I can get a slice of pizza, french fries, and tacos all at the same time!  I mean, DAYIM!  There doesnt seem to be too much showing this weekend as far as cinema is concerned.  My parents have these free movie passes they use and sometimes Hoyts blocks the newest movies that come out for at least two weeks.  So, we are going to try to see The Core, although I must admit that it looks cheesified.  What are the other options?  How to Lose a Guy in 10 days or Bringing Down the House, which will probably be what we end up going to if The Core is blocked.  My mom loves Steve Martin (as do I) and I am just in love with that Queen Lateef!  She can do no wrong in my eyes.    I will stay up late, sleep late, and eat eat eat.  Oh Joe, like you need to eat anymore than you already do.  I mean, the fly on my pants isnt FULLY busted yet, so why not keep going??  Things with Paul and I are going so well that its almost as though we just started dating.  Last night he calls me at 6:30pm to see if I was getting ready to go out.  I told him that I was taking a nap to get ready and he said that he was doing the same.  I then hinted that maybe we could not go out and just hang at my place and have dinner.  He totally went for the idea!  I was shocked.  Paul has one night a week that he can go out and drink and he gave up his one night to be with me, alone.  I was very happy to say the least.    Paul arrived at my apartment at 7pm and we ordered ourselves some dinner.  We also made an oatmeal cookie that is easily the size of Kansas.  We spent the night watching Must see TV and eating ourselves into an oblivion.  Just the way we like it!  Our night was filled with laughter and small kisses and hugs.  I felt calm, relaxed, and so happy.  As we fell asleep, we were suctioned to each other like literal peas in a pod.  It was so great.    I woke up this morning at 6am, from having a terrible nightmare (as I have been having just about every night these days), and Paul turned over and asked me if I was ok.  I told him that I had a bad dream and he wrapped his body around me until I fell back to sleep.  It was wonderful.    At 9am, Paul left my place and I got into the shower.  When I returned to my room to get dressed, there was a little note on my bed that said: Have a great weekend with your parents.  I cant wait to spend more time with you.  I love you so much Joseph.  If things keep going the way they are, I will really feel as though our relationship is going to achieve levels that I was previously sure were impossible to reach.  When Paul wants to be this much a part of our relationship, I fall in love with him over and over again, every single day.    Basically, when things are going well with Paul, everything else in my life seems to go much better.  So this morning, as I am getting on the subway at Columbus Circle, this lady (who I dont think was homeless, but was definitely dirty looking) gets on through the same doorway entrance that I use.  We stand on the subway together, holding onto the same pole and just before she gets off at 86th street, she turns towards me, looks in my eyes, and screams: BALK! in my face.  I jumped out of my skin and backed away from her.  She turns and exits the subway and I move back to the pole I was holding.  As the doors to the subway close, she turns to face me, points her finger in my face and goes: BALK!    I was pissed at her for screaming balk! at me again, so I burst out laughing in her face.  I just laughed and laughed and as the subway started to move out of the station, she kept going BALK BALK BALK BLAK while watching me through the windows.  It was SO WEIRD!   Cuz what is BALK??  And why am  I  balk?    I decided that I hate balk.  In other newsmy shoulder is getting much better.  The pinched nerve is slowly working its way out.  I can almost turn my neck all the way to the left AND I can get out of bed on my own now.  I dont need Paul to pull me up by my arms.  I figure that it will be fully healed by next week.  Then I can start masturbating upside down with hooks hanging out of my eyelids, like I usually do.    Ok, shits getting strange in here now.  I am going home.    (HEY DOV!)  Alright, have a great weekend yall.  Be back soon with more stories of how scary, dirty ladies call me Balk!

      Its almost the weekend and I am very happy! (I wrote that in a singsong voice, but when I just read it aloud it came across boring.  Sing that first line to the tune of na-na-na-na-na-na  oh god nevermind.  Trying to describe the tune of a song in words is fruitless.  And I only deal with the fruitful!) Anyhoodle I am really excited to go home tomorrow.  In fact, that is a complete understatement!  I am MADD excited to go home tomorrow.  Mothers Against Drunk Driving has nothing on me!  The weather has been unbelievable lately and every time I get off the subway at work I smell the Hudson River in the air and that makes my insides go all mushy.  (cuz the Hudson River runs from my work all the way up to my neighborhood)  I love the suburbs.  How could I not?  I spent 21 years of my life in them.  So going home tomorrow, when the weather is amazing is just about the best thing on the planet.  My parents and I will have some wine while sitting on our deck in lawn chairs and we will breathe the fresh and clear air of Albany, NY.  Cept we will also be smoking our brains off and that makes the air not so fresh.  EITHER WAY YAY!  When I spoke with my mom earlier today, she asked me how I would feel about having buffalo chicken roll ups for dinner tomorrow night.  But mom, what are buffalo chicken roll ups?   Moms:  They are buffalo chicken sandwiches rolled up into something that resembles a pita pocket.  But its not pita and instead of a pocket, there is a ton of blue cheese in it.   Joe:  YUM! Moms:  So what do you think?  Do you want to have that for dinner? Joe:  YUM! Moms:  Sohmm.do you want to have it?? Joe:  YUM! Moms:  Joe, do you want to have this for dinner or not? Joe:  YEM!? Moms:  Whats yem mean? Joe:  It means YUM! Moms:  (hysterically laughing) So you havent answered my questiondo you want this for dinner or not? Joe:  Moms, I think I have answered your question already. Moms:  Okay fine. So we will have buffalo chicken roll ups. Joe:  SICK!  Who could eat such a thing?!?! Moms:  But you just said YEM!  At this point, I couldnt stop hysterically laughing at the fact that she cant stop saying yem, so I say: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA.  You said YEM!  Buffalo Chicken Rolls ups sound amazing.  I cant wait to see this woman.  Both her and my dad make me happier than anything else.  So LAST NIGHT Paul took me out to dinner at Leshkos in the East Village.  We had THREE COURSES!  It was a BIT ridiculous as to how much we ate, but after we left, I asked him if we could stop for dessert.  Paul reminded me that we just finished a brownie sundae and a cheesecake and I reminded him that I was doing my best to grow up into a fat beastie, and he said that I could have butter cookies when we got home.  I said ok and ate 37 of them the minute I got the chance.    We both laid in bed farting and clutching our stomachs for at least an hour before falling asleep.  In other newshad lunch with my boss today.  Thought that I was going to be yelled at for one reason or another, but instead I had two glasses of wine and waxed philosophical about whatever shit came into my mind.  I always think that lunch with my boss is going to be some big and scary thing, but every time it turns out that he just wants someone to sit with him and talk for an hour.  Ehfine with me.    Tonight I am off to THE HOLE to pay $10 for all I can drink.  Want to know something weird?  When I just typed THE HOLE, I said the words to myself in a very deep and scary voice.  I was like  the HOLLLE .  Then I laughed at myself.  Yeah, it was pretty weird.  OkI have been doing TOO MUCH playing today and now I have about 3 piles of work to get done before I go home.  Maybe something exciting will happen tonight and then tomorrow I can relay stories of drunken sex and debauchery.  Are sex and debauchery the same thing?  Hmmmeither way, I hope they both happen to me tonight.    ROCK!

      Well ladies and gentleman, it turns out that I have a pinched nerve in my left shoulder.  The specialist I met with this morning felt around my back and told me that I am all jammed up.  He said that I have knots upon knots in my back and that I need to start changing my sleeping and relaxation patterns.  No more double pillows, thats for sure.  He said that I also need to find a way to relax, that most of the tension in my back is because of stress.  Makes sense I guess.  I mean, I did just move to Times Square, Rita did just leave, and the war is ripping my heart out, so yeah, thanks Dr. Swayzer, you are a genius.    I have stretching exercises that I need to do and I can take as much Aleve as necessary.  When I asked about getting a prescription for a REAL pain reliever, he told me that I would have to go to my primary healthcare physician to get that.  Harumph, I said.  Harumph.  But at least I feel better knowing that what is going on in my back is normal and not some alien tumor that would require weeks and weeks of intensive surgery.  MMMMMMMMM.surgery.  In some ways, that could be nice.  Despite my crumbling back, I managed to meet Mariah and Rachel out for a drink.  I only stayed an hour, but found that vodka tonics and champagne cure all pain.  I was laughing and moving my neck all over the place.  Then as I stopped drinking, the pain came back and I made the girls take me home.  I rewarded them with some marijuana and all was good.    SO!  Paul and I have settled on a vacation place.  We will be going to Freeport in the Bahamas!  Whoo hoo!  We put down our deposit today and will be gone from July 26th  August 2nd.  I have decided to go to California sometime in September or October, depending on when my uncles are visiting the East Coast.  Maybe Paul will even be able to go with me then.  If not, I am still very excited to get out to San Francisco.  And with my uncles paying for it all, who cares who goes?  I got a ticket to ride dawg!   The condo we are staying in is beautiful.  Its a block from the beach and a block from nightclubs, an international bazaar for shopping and restaurants, restaurants, restaurants!  There is even a place on site that allows us to swim with the dolphins.  How could that be any better!?!?!    YAY!  I have never been out of the country.  This is my first attempt at being a traveler and I am most excited.  Paul and I have been doing very well these days and that allows me to have some sense of relief when it comes to planning this adventure.  We have had really good conversations lately and he has been actually trying to be a good boyfriend.  I have not let any of his effort go unrecognized and when he gets stressed out and reverts back to his old ways, I take a step back and allow him to decompress.    We still have yet to dive into our physical relationship again, but I am hoping that that will pick up again in no time.  Paul doesnt like touching when we are angry with each other.  And for the last 3 months, there has been a lot of anger.  But since our huge fight a couple of weeks ago, he has been slowly making progress.  And I am so much happier for it.    Mariah leaves for Florida next Wednesday.  (sad face)  She will be gone for a month!  What am I ever going to do?  I mean, I have 3 friends in the city as is, and now with her gone, I will have two.  Heh heh heh doh.  (sad face again)  Mariah has decided to go home this weekend and in lieu of me having no life and constantly spending money, I have decided to do the same.  (I get a free train ride out of the deal, cuz her dad has connections with Amtrak.)  Last week, my mom was talking to me about my brother and the war and she had to get off the phone because she started to cry.  She doesnt like to break down about things that she knows I am struggling with,  even though I want to be there for her as much as she always is for me.    So this weekend, I will be with her.    The minute I told her I was coming, she got off the phone, called my dad, and then called me back with minute by minute plans of what we would do.  They want to play cards and drink on Friday and then Saturday we will go tanning, out to dinner and rent a movie.  If possible, we may play tennis too, but with my pinched nerve, who knows about that?  Maybe I will just sleep in late on Saturday so they can go play tennis.  Im not much for moving around when I dont have to.  (snicks)  I havent been home since Christmas and I am sick with myself for that.  My parents live for me to be home and I live for seeing them, so whats been the problem?  Ouch my back.  Oh yeah, stress has been the problem.    So thats that.  Ugh.  I just got off the phone with Mariah.  We had an intense discussion about Rachel that ended up with her in tears.  I have a tendency not to hold back when I have an opinion on something and since Mariah cares so much about what I say to her, sometimes my honesty is a bit hard to bear.  I just have a very hard time hanging out with Rachel and Mariah.  Rachel spends the whole time telling Mariah that she is stupid worthless and wasting her time.  My teeth gritted through most of the evening as I struggled not to vocalize the anger at Rachel that was steadily building in me all night long.  A best friend shouldnt tear down another best friend the way that Rachel does to Mariah.  And really, this is just the beginning to how deep their problems go.  Ultimately, Mariah got off the phone thankful that we had had the talk, but I still worry about her and her capability with dealing with someone who is as vicious as Rachel.  Gosh, its tough.  I just love her so much and hate to see her being treated poorly.  Gosh, it kills me inside.    Okay, off to date night with Paul.  As long as he doesnt have to work tonight, we are planning on going out to a nice dinner in Chelsea.  Last weeks dinner was great and I am hoping for some of the same.  And I love being able to spend the night with just him.  Our naked bodies writhing in oh yeahno writhing.  Alright, time to go shit.

      OUCH!  Fucking ouch.  Somehow I have managed to completely throw out my back.  I have had these overwhelmingly painful knots in my shoulders for about two weeks and now my back has finally given up.  Yesterday I stayed home from work, for a number of reasons, most of which had nothing to do with my back hurting.  I met Mariah at 3pm for a quick lunch at Dallas BBQ (DAYIM was that goodand I thought about my Rita the whole timeshe loves BBQ) and played with the baby she is the nanny for.  It was a great time, but in the middle of lunch, my back seized up on me.  I said goodbye to her and crawled onto the subway.   To my wonderful surprise, Paul was in my bed waiting for me when I got home.  I climbed in next to him and lay there stiff as a board for about 2 hours.  At 8pm, we decided to start making dinner, cept I couldnt move at all.  Paul helped me to my feet and I stood there like a statue.  Each movement sending coursing pain through my arms and down my spine.  It was awful.  Paul made dinner for me and even went to Duane Reade to get me some Ben Gay.  I laid in bed and ate his wonderful dinner and then he slathered me up with that peppermint smelling nonsense.  Lo and behold it did help a bit, but after two hours, the numbness started going away and the searing pain set in again.    Paul and I spent the evening with him at my computer (picking out vacation spots) and me in bed not moving an inch.  We decided that, if financially possible, we will go to the Caribbean this summer.  Our first choice was St. Thomas, second choice St. Johns, third choice Jamaica and so on and so forth.  Unfortunately, we cant try to book the condo until mid-May.  Which is completely irritating for someone like me who has to have everything planned to the minute, months in advance.  I guess I just have to be patient.  Had a great weekend.  Saw the movie  Dreamcatcher  with Kelly and we had a wonderful brunch at the famous  Playwright Tavern .  Then we went to the park and read our books for awhile.  It was a beautiful day and I had such a great time.  Saturday night I went out with Joanna and Rachel and had a surprisingly good time with them.    Then I met Paul at his job and had a few glasses of extremely expensive champagne.  Then I met Kelly at home and we went to an Irish pub at 2:30am to have a couple nightcaps.  It was such a random evening.  I spent $40 and went to 5 different bars.  I guess thats what happens when your Rita leaves and you have to meet people at their places of fun in order to do anything.  I need some more friends and ASAP!  Oooooooooooooooooh my back!  Everything else is going pretty smoothly these days.  I did get one good piece of news!  Turns out that I overpaid my mom $220 this month on the bill I owe her.  Dont ask me how I did it, cuz its ridiculous.  But in any case, she told me that I just paid one month in advance.  Which means (!!!) I have money for my taxes now!  WHOO HOO!  Leave it to me to balance my checkbook never and then somehow save my own ass.  Rock out.  That made me happy.  Alright, I cant even type anymore, my back hurts that bad.    I will be back tomorrow and hopefully in one more solid piece.    ouch.

      Today I write this while playing a little game with myself.    You see, I have to piss so bad that my teeth ache.  Yet, I want to get this down in here before I leave work cuz Lord knows I wont be able to write again tonight.  What with the HUGE plans I have.  I mean, making dinner and watching movies.  Now those are plans that are unparalleled to anything anyone else is doing.  Man Im a pathetic loser.    SO!  Instead of going out last night, Kelly, Paul and I sat in his apartment and had a few drinks while watching the war coverage.  It wasnt really the BEST time I have ever had, but it was nice to be able to get a few things off my chest.  I think that Kelly felt the same way too.  We were all able to discuss the different aspects of what is going on around us and I know that after all was said and done, I felt much better having released some of the tension that had been building in me throughout the day.  Eventually Kelly fell asleep on the couch and I made the mistake of telling Pauls roommate, Jen, that one time I sucked a dick so big that it was almost impossible to breathe.  I come out of Jens bedroom having made this ridiculous comment, and Paul is scowling at me from the kitchen.  I was immediately pissed that he was turning our easy night into yet another fight filled extravaganza.    And thats what it became as we argued for at least an hour.    He was mostly pissed that I wouldnt go out with him and get drinks.  It was his one night off and he wanted to spend it in a skank bar.  I have no problem drinking and staying home.  Its more comfortable, much cheaper, and easy.  But Paul bitched about staying in all night long.  Eventually we ate some cereal and climbed into bed.  I didnt want to fight with him and eventually I just gave up trying to explain myself and my big mouth.    He called me this morning to tell me how much he missed me.  So no hard feelings, I guess.  I told him that we would go out late tomorrow night to make up for last night.  He seemed pretty happy about that.  I was just glad that he shut his fat head up for once.  LAMESKI.  Oooh!  The piss is creeping out the slit of my dick now.  Ok phew.  I just clenched my dick shut with my fingers.  I think I bought myself some more time.  Gosh, totally at a loss as to what to write today.  My night was pretty uneventful, I dont feel like discussing the war anymore, and I dont have diarrhea.  What else do I usually write about?  I have had to resort to discussing my urine.  Man, why would anyone want to sit down and read this nonsense?   oh yeah, cuz Im hot.  Alright, I will tell a story.    Here we go  One time, when I was like 16 years old, one of my family members got the  Saved By the Bell  board game.  Now of course I LOVED this TV show and watched it religiously until I turned 22 years old.  The only reason I stopped watching it at that point is because they began showing it during the day when I was at work.  And I just dont DO the New Class.  I mean, give me a break cuz I sure need one.  (man, I still miss Nell Carter pretty bad) SO!  I was incredibly in love with AC Slater.  Cuz dayim what a body he had.  Well, in the board game, all of the different cast members had their own photo cards:  Jessie, Lisa, Zack, Screech, Kelly, and Slates all had like 3 different photos.  One of Slaters photos was with him with his shirt off.  All beefed up and ready to take me home to fuck me, or so I fantasized.    Well, I ended up stealing this photo of AC and I hid it under my mattress in my bedroom.  I would pull it out every once in awhile and stare at it longingly.  (oh god, am I really telling this story?)  One day, as I sat staring at the picture of AC, I decided to masturbate to the picture.  I laid down on my bed and pulled out my cock and balls.  I began jerking and jerking and imagining Slater picking me up in his arms and carrying me to his big bed where he would most likely get me pregnant.  hahahahaha.   My baby would have had a jerry curl.   So as I am jerking feverishly on my bed, the door to my room suddenly swings open so fast and so abruptly that I yelped and sat up trying to hide the fact that I was jerking off.  My dad stands there looking at me and IMMEDIATELY swings the door shut.  Silence.  My eyes grow SO WIDE and my heart starts beating out of my chest.  A few more seconds pass and then I hear my dads quiet little voice outside my bedroom door.  Joe, do you know what you would like for dinner? Dad says. Oh, erum..(MY GOD WHAT HAS HAPPENED!!!)I dont know.  Whatever you are making. I reply. Well, do you want corn or peas with your steak?  Dad tries again. Oh gosh, um, you see, Iuh (FUCKING LEAVE!!!), wellcorn!  I say. But I thought you liked peas better?  Dad says. FINE PEAS!  FINE!  ILL EAT WHATEVER YOU MAKE!  Me totally exasperated Ok  Dad says. ----SILENCE for a couple more seconds---- Are you okay in there?  Dad says (IS HE FUCKING SERIOUS?!?!?)  YES!  I am fine!  I am just kind of tired!  I say. Okay then.  Be ready for dinner in 15 minutes.  Dad says. Yeah, sure dad.  I say while trying to possibly think of a way to leave my home and never return.  My dad walks down the hallway and returns to the kitchen.  I sat there stunned and shocked with my pants down around my ankles and my knees huddling against my chest.  Did my dad actually just catch me masturbating??   DID HE?!?!  And did he see me clutching the AC Slater photo card while doing it??!!?!?!    I decided to finish masturbating.  Cuz at this point, I needed to finish what I had started.    After I cleaned up my jizz, I joined my family for dinner.  My face was beat red, but no one said anything.  My dad did look at me a little funny for a couple of days, but I think eventually he forgot that it had happened.  About a year ago, I brought up the incident to him and he says that he doesnt remember catching me masturbating.  But he does remember walking in on me while I was rolling around on my bed naked.  I reminded him that I was NOT NAKED and also that I obviously was masturbating.  His reply was: Well, I dont know WHAT you were doing, but it sure was weird.    And thats that.  I can assure you that from that point on, I became much more careful about when and where I decided to make love to myself.  This story has not been elaborated on or exaggerated in any way.  I am really this big of a loser.   But hot.  Always hot.  Never forget that I am hot.  WINKLES!    aRdios!  TIME TO PISS!  YAY I WON THE GAME!

      So it has happened huh?    The war has begun.    I dont know about you, but I knew it was going to happen all along.  I think anyone with a military family knew that this was going to happen all along.  Many of my friends had kept hope that this would just blow over, but as the months went by, it was pretty much inevitable that there was no other solution to this situation.    Last night, as I sat and watched the coverage on NBC, I was shocked at the realism of this entire thing.  Being able to see Baghdad and the activity that was going on around the city was terrifying.  While I wanted nothing more than to switch the channel, I joined America in watching history being made.  About 30 minutes into the live coverage, I lost my mind.  Paul and I had been arguing over something incredibly stupid and as the tension between us escalated, I felt any sort of control I had over my emotions escape me.  I started shaking uncontrollably and the tears just poured out of my face.  Why? I kept screaming.  Why?!  It was so overwhelming.  Paul immediately stopped yelling at me and moved over to sit next to me on the couch.  He put his arm around me and I cried and cried and cried.  He dialed my home phone number and I talked to my father.  When my life spirals out of control, my parents are the people I want to talk to the most.  My dad, having been in the military for over 27 years knows so much more about the world and war than I could ever imagine.  Having retired as a Lieutenant Colonel just over 4 years ago, he is currently struggling with the fact that his old unit has been activated and deployed to the borders of Iraq.  He is on the phone daily with numerous family members of those that used to serve under him.  Regardless of the fact that he is no longer an active member of the United States Army, he is still the touchstone for a lot of people who have had their fathers, brothers, sisters, and mothers be sent off to war.   He is an amazing man.  So I called him and within 3 minutes and 37 seconds (according to the cell phone), my dad had wiped my tears, told me that the anxiety and upset that I was feeling was natural, and also that I have to focus on the fact that we are a strong army that will come out victorious.  He and I fought the idea of this war together over the last 12 months; writing letters, signing petitions, etc.  But now that we are at the point when peace is no longer an option, it is our duty as Americans to stand by our country and to support all those that are fighting on our behalf.  My dad has a way of finding the right words to say within this delicate situation so that I dont walk away hating either the US for their military action or Iraq for being such a belligerent, nasty country.  I have told my dad before that he is my hero, and today, I feel it more strongly than ever.    Same with my brother.  I had a great talk with him today that was filled with laughter and joy.  He is very optimistic about his position and while we are all afraid of the danger he is going to be put into, as long as he can hold himself together, I surely can too.  I want every talk with him to be nothing short of positive.  I ask him about his new girlfriend, his daily routine, and his friends.  He asks me about my job, Paul, my friends, and my new apartment in Times Square.  He is doing big and great things with his life right now and I have never been so proud of him.  Nor so scared at the thought of losing him.    He got his Small Pox vaccine this morning.  Turns out, the vaccine takes 3 weeks to take hold of your system.  Until that time comes, he will have numerous side effects, most of which are pretty harmless.  There is a chance of death after receiving this vaccine, though he and I are not worried about that possibility.  He is more likely to have his Bradley (tank) blown up than he is to develop a deadly case of Small Pox.  He says that no one can touch the spot where he got the shot until the scab falls off.  If anyone comes in contact with this area, they will immediately develop this disease and if not treated immediately, this person would die.  He also informed me that he is going to visit his girlfriend this weekend.  When I asked him if he was going to have sex with her, he said Fuck yeah.  I replied with But Winfield, what if she rubs against your arm?   Winfield:  Then I call 911. Me:  Well thats pretty fucking dangerous, dont you think? W:  Nah.  Im going to wear long sleeves. Me:  I think shes going to get small pox from you. W:  Joe, I will be careful, I promise. Me:  Well, what if your scab falls off while you are visiting her? W:  Then I wont be contagious anymore. Me:  Yeah, but what if she finds the scab in the bed and starts eating it? W:  What? Me:  What if you wake up and Nina is lying next to you, pensively chewing on the small pox scab that has fallen off your arm? W:  Then I would do two things.  1) I would dump her and 2) I would call 911. Me:  Oh.  Ok.  See, so Winfield and I are covering the basics while still trying to make eachother laugh.  He is such a great kid.  And he is making my family and myself so incredibly happy with how well he is doing with this whole ARMY thing.  He is up for another promotion and is getting rave reviews from both his commanders and platoon.  Plus, he has promised me that after he goes to war, he will be able to come home for a months worth of block leave.  And then after that, he will have two years left until he is out of the ARMY.  And at this point, he says that he wants nothing more than to do that and to settle into something more his style.    Thank God.  I will have my brother back.  But for nowfor now I focus on him and on every person that has left their loved ones behind in order to fight for what we, as a country, believe is right.  This is a scary time and as Paul said so eloquently last night No one should be alone right now.  He then hung his grandfathers American Flag outside of his window in support of our troops.  I fell in love with him all over again.    Switching gears  Guess what?  I dont know if its because I sobbed my eyes out or what, but Paul and I kissed and kissed and kissed last night.  We ran our hands and bodies all over eachother.  Its been two months since we have been intimate and last night was an amazing first step.  We didnt hook up to the point of orgasm, but it felt so good to have his hands running over my body again.  I felt safe and I felt happy.  He is still taking small steps when it comes to our physical relationship, but I am willing to work with him on this every step of the way.  Just before we fell asleep, I said: I want to have sex with you.  Pauls arm tightened around my shoulders and he kissed me on the neck.  It was a beautiful moment. Very beautiful.  And then he fucked me.  Hardcore style.  So anywaytonight we are all going to The Hole.  Nice name for a bar, huh?  Nice and SKANKY.  I have written about this place in my journal before.  $10 for all the booze and sluts you can handle.  Its pretty slimy, but with the right people, a fucking blast.  Kelly is spending the night at Pauls place because she was pretty scared and upset being alone in Times Square last night.  I dont blame her at all.  If something happens to NYC, Times Square is not the place I want to be in.  Nor do I want to be in Harlem.  But thats just cuz.  Alright, off to lunch.    I just want us all to remember one thing.    No matter what your views on this war happen to be, we are all in it together.  This is OUR country and whether we agree with everything the president does or not, we have chosen to make this a democracy ruled by the people.  And the people have chosen to go to war.  Feel how you want, but support those that risk their lives daily for your freedom.

      TGIW!  Weeks almost over, thank the Lord.  I live for the day when I dont care whether its a weekend or not.  You know, the day when I am doing something with myself other than sitting at my lame desk from 9am-5pm.  Gosh.  I really cant stand this life.  I wonder what it feels like to be doing this type of thing every day for 40 years?  I mean, shit.  If thats me, I think my brain will shrivel up and die before I ever get the chance to really use it.  I have the worst anxiety today.  I dont really know why.  Maybe its because I am to meet up with a friend from highschool tonight after work.  Or maybe I just feel off.  I dont know.  Either way, I have caught myself grinding my teeth over and over.  My jaw is aching from clenching down on my teeth all day.  Its weird when you do that without having any prior experience with it.  My jaw only clenches shut when I do drugs.  Which isnt ever.  So I sit here and rub my poor mouth and ask myself to please calm down.    When I woke up this morning, I thought I cant possibly go to work today.  I lay in bed dreading my life and eventually I decided to go in an hour late.  I called my boss and told him that I was running behind and I closed my eyes for another hour, not sleeping.  Eventually the nervousness that I felt about getting out of bed dissipated and I crawled out and got into the shower.  I dont know why I feel this way sometimes.  Every day I deal with this emotional rollercoaster.  However, some days, for no reason at all, I cant control how I feel.   It scares me and forces me once again into the realization that I need to go back on some sort of anti-depressant or anxiety reliever pill.  Previous attempts at taking this type of drug failed miserably and its been a while since I have considered going back on them.  Ugh.  I just want to feel normal.   After work yesterday, I went home to take a nap.  It was very exciting to get back into bed at 1:30pm.  But then I couldnt get back out.  I lay there ALL DAY.  Not doing anything.  The harder I tried to get out, the more my brain resisted and kept me stuck there.  It was incredibly lonely and eventually I just gave up and went to sleep around 9pm.  The one thing I did do was make a nice dinner for myself.  I whipped up this weird au gratin potato/chicken package that I had purchased at the store.  It took about an hour to put together and tasted pretty good.  But thats it.  Thats all I accomplished.    God, I just feel so helpless.    Why do I have such HUGE highs and then such DEEP lows?  And why cant I get my shit together so that I can fix it?    Its frustrating not being able to control how you feel.  Very frustrating.  And the problem is, I feel this guilt as though I have done something to put myself in this position.  And, well, I probably have.  Its like I need someone to come into my life and fix it.  Cuz I dont know how to do it on my own.  I have been dealing with the same issues for over two years now and at this point I feel like I have no idea where to start repairing the damage that I have caused.  When will I actually get the nerve up to DO something about this acting dream I have?  When will I stop going right to bed as soon as I get home or conversely going out and getting drunk?    When you begin to really hate yourself, its almost impossible to find anything positive thats worth changing for.    Some days I am okay.    Some days I can get out of bed just fine and go on with my life.  Some days I feel empowered to take control.  Some days I even do that which I didnt think I could do the day before.  ie: getting the job at the Gap.  Or moving to Times Square.    But then I end up back in my bed, struggling to even put on my clothes the next morning.  I get to work planning on working on my resumes and mailings.  But the next thing I know its 5pm and I have done nothing to move myself forward.    Alright enough.  Writing about all of this is not helping me see anything more clearly.    I need to pray now.

      ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooof DAH!  Whoa what a night.  I am more than lucky to have gotten out of bed today and made it into work.  Thing is, I knew Ari had to go to the dentist and there was no way I could call in.  Im glad that I got my ass out of bed and came though.  I wasnt sleeping well and I think my body will heal faster if its out and about, rather than deteriorating in my bedroom.  Cept now I am feeling as though my ass is about to explode with vodka tonics.  EEEEEEEEEEEEE! Okay, wave of diarrhea has passed.  Goodness.  Left here at 5pm yesterday to meet Pauls roommate, Jen, at a bar called the Cubby Hole.  It was in the meatpacking district, which I dont get to very often.  I couldnt (and still cant) believe how beautiful the weather is.  I feel like spring is actually here and its not even June yet!  When the weather is like this, it makes me eternally happy and full of life.  Makes me want to be healthier.  Okay whatever, back to the ridiculous night I had.  So I get to the bar at 5:30pm and Jen is supposed to meet me there at 5:45pm.  I finished the rest of my book and asked the bartender if he took credit cards.  He said no, we only take cash and then I asked him if I could start a tab.  He looked at me for a moment and then said What would you like?  I ordered my first of 382 vodka tonics and as he was making the drink I noticed a sign that said: ABSOLUTELY NO BAR TABS.  He gave me the drink and winked at me.  Eventually it was 6pm and still no sign of Jen.  I had finished my drink and the bartender comes over and we have this conversation:  Bartender:  Would you like another one? Me:  I would, but I dont have any sort of cash on me and my friend is running late. Bartender:  I trust you.  Let me make you another. Me:  Okay, thank you very much.  Whats your name? Bartender:  James.  Yours? Me:  Joe. Bartender:  (extends his hand) Nice to meet you Joe.   I notice at this point that the bartender is pretty fucking adorable and I dont know what to do with myself.  He was at least 61 and had dark curly-esque hair and he was sporting two days worth of scruff.  He was very lean, but his clothes were baggy and fell perfectly on his upper body and ass.  He had an amazing smile and was the coolest guy in the place.  I was in love.    After giving me my second drink, he added green food coloring to it and the smile on my face became HUGE.  Thank you so much for being so great to meI truly appreciate it.  No problem Joe.  Happy St. Patricks Day.  Around 6:30pm, Jen showed up and I paid for the drinks that were on my tab.  She and I sat at the bar for another hour or so before her friend Dana showed up.  Dana was interesting and I could talk about her in greater detail except that I would rather talk about James, my new love.  Over the course of the night, I paid for 3 drinks total.  That includes the 2 I had before Jen got to the bar.  By the time I reached my 6th drink, I was starting to realize how drunk I was becoming.  Yet I was VERY in control, as I wanted to look cool in front of the hot bartender.  He gave me $5 and told me to play whatever I wanted on the jukebox.  I did and I tried to pick songs that I knew he would like: John Mayer, Bob Dylan, *NSYNCokay, so I HAD to throw one song in there for me!    I got back from the jukebox to find ANOTHER drink sitting at my seat.    James, Im not sure that I am ready for another one, I said. Its not from me this time, its from Steven.  Want me to introduce you? James said.  I look over to see who Steven is and am horrifically reminded of a 30 year old Edwin McCain.  Completely NOT my type.   Justnot.  Because I am a polite gentleman, I went over and sat with Edwin for at least a half an hour.   I can pretty much talk to anyone and I did my absolute best to make conversation with him.  I asked him all about his job, his apartment, his interests  At no point did he even ask me what I did for a living.  When I found out that he has been temping at Barnard College, I threw out the fact that I work at Columbia University.  (SOMETHING WE HAVE IN COMMON, RIGHT??)  No, he smiled and kept talking about himself.  Well Steven, you didnt have a chance before and you SURELY dont have one now.    Steven goes into the bathroom and James walks over to me.   Adorable, cute, want to lick his face, James. At this point he had put on a baseball cap and this little duck tail of hair was coming out of the hole in the back of it.  I wanted to wrap my fingers around it and pull him in VERY close to me.  And he was so much taller than me!  I love that.  (I am 58  member?)  James, if Edwin McCain or anyone else wants to buy me a drink, please tell them that I am not interested and that I only buy my own drinks. I said. Did you just call Steven, Edwin McCain? Yes.  (getting nervous cuz I think I insulted his friend) BOOOOO WAAAAAH HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.  That is so funny man! James exploded. (nervous giggling and realizing that I am sucking this MAN in) I just dont want to have to sit and talk to anyone else that I am not interested in.  I said. Oh, does Joe have a problem being so beautiful? James said. hahahaha.  Yeah, thats definitely it.  I am embarrassed at my devastatingly good looks.  I blushed. Well, there is a reason the guys here want to buy you drinks.  You have this quality about you James said. (heart in my chest) Thanks James.  That is really nice.  I dont know what to say.   He winks at me and walks away.  I float on over to the table where Jen, Dana (and now Kelly) were sitting at.  Kelly arrived during all of this commotion.  I explained to them that I had just fallen in love at the bar and that I didnt know what to do about it.  Kelly handled it all with ease as she is used to me falling in love the moment I see a hot guy.  A MANLY hot guy.  Yum.  Jen goes Just dont let me see anything.  I wouldnt tell Paul, but what if you end up really interested in James? I wont.  Its just nice to be wanted for once.  It feels nice to be single. I said.  During the next 15 minutes, I glanced at James numerous times and most of the time he was looking back.  Smiling, pensive, obviously thinking about me and what I was about.  I decided that I wanted to give him my number.  Not for sex, but for someone cool to hang out with.  Makes sense, right?  Its not like I would EVER give him my number because I was interested.   SIKE.  I was TOTALLY INTERESTED and at that point, Paul was so backseat.  Kelly wrote out my phone number and I told her that I was going to give it to him and then we could take off and go home.  I grabbed the piece of paper, got 3 steps towards the bar and stopped walking.  Was I really into James?  He was nice and he was absolutely hot, but am I in a relationship with Paul or not?  How could I do this to him?  How could I do this to him  again ?  No matter what problems we have.  The last thing he would do is give his number to another guy.  The last thing he would do is cheat on me.     I turned around and shoved the piece of paper back into Kellys hand.  I went over to the bar and James told me to hold for one second.  I waited for him with a pained look on my face.  Whats wrong buddy? James said. Nothing, I just wanted to say thank you again for making this a great night for me.  I said. Never a problem.  Glad that you hung around here with me for awhile. James said while his smoldering brown eyes made my cock stir a bit. When do you work here?  I would love to come back and see you? I work (insert times) and would be very excited to see you again too.  James said. Then its settled. I will be back soon to visit.  Okay.  James said, pausing I THINK to ask for my number.  Well, umnow I dont know what to say. James said. I know.  Ill see you soon.  I finally said. Okay man.  Take care.  Have a good night.  I shook his hand, looked in his eyes one last time, and left the bar.  Kelly and I went back to our apartment and Paul showed up about a half-hour later.  We argued for another hour after that and I went to bed feeling shitty.    I do love Paul.  I mean, I am still IN LOVE with Paul.  But sometimes it feels good to be wanted.  Paul still doesnt want to kiss or hook up.  He said last night that that is because he feels that we are really off with eachother.  We fight so much that he doesnt see how kissing or touching in the midst of that would be ok.  I think it would help us to find our way back to who we used to be.  I didnt tell Paul about James and I dont plan on doing it any time soon.  It was a moment that I had for myself.  And I missed the feeling I got from talking to someone new.  With Paul I forget that I am a good looking and fun guy.  I forget that I am someone that other guys want to be with.  I forget that I am who I really am.   Instead, I live day to day being angry and hurt and lonely.   When is enough, enough?

      WELL!  HAPPY ST. PADDYS EVERYONE!  and also HAPPY PURIM!  You know, I was going to bail out of drinking beer today because I felt as though I had been drinking enough lately and I want to try and tone it down a bit.  But then I came to work and had a pretty great day and the weather is unbelievably enticing and beautiful and now I am going to have drinks as soon as I get out of here.  Nice one Joe.  Way to stick by any sort of resolution.  But YUM!  Green beer!    Had a wonderful weekend.  Friday night went out with the girls to lesbo city.  Joanna came over beforehand and brought me a wonderful card that she had written along with a new plant for my bedroom!  My old plant, Conrad, was VERY excited to have a girlfriend.  This new plants name is Frida Callow.  Or whatever her name is.  You know, the woman with the unibrow.  Yeah.  Conrad and Frita are happily in love.  Stayed up late talking to Kelly again and was up by 3pm on Saturday to get ready for my night out at Aris b-day party.  Was supposed to hang with Pauls family this weekend, but after running into them Friday night, decided against it.  They were nothing short of weird with me and gave me dirty looks and made it almost impossible for me to be around them.  I mean, SORRY family, but Paul is GAY and I am his GAY BOYFRIEND and we do GAY sex together (well, not for the last two months, but still) and GAY GAY GAY.  It took all I had not to scream these things in their faces.  They were BLECH.  And if it werent for Mariah and Joanna, they would have ruined my night.  Thank God for friends.  Saturday night I went to Aris party ALONE.  I never go anywhere alone, but decided that her get together was more important than my irrational fears of having to fend for myself.  So I went.  When I walked through the door and realized that I really knew no one, I told myself that I would be out of there in 5 minutes flat.  As I sipped on my first drink, I decided to give the night a shot.  See if I could survive more than one drink.  Turns out, I survived 4 drinks and had a pretty great time.  I talked a great deal with Aris old-time friend Fran and her husband.  I was able to get to know them a LOT better and I was very happy about that.  Ari has hung out with my friends on numerous occasions and I felt like Saturday night was my turn.  I talked to FISH, I talked to K (dont want to give her real name, but dont know her online name), and I exchanged hellos and good-byes with Doug.   It was a very successful evening and I felt so PROUD of myself after it was all over.  I went there stag and came out of it feeling confident and empowered.   GREAT night.  Yesterday, I went to lunch with Kellys family and had a beautiful time.  They love her so much and it was nice to be around family for the afternoon.  Turns out, Kellys father lost his keys in the cab and he and Kellys mom had to wait 8 hours on the corner of 46th and 6th for a new key to be made.  Oops.  It was really upsetting to have to see them wait for so long, but it didnt stop Kelly and I from going to see the new movie, Willard!    WHICH BY THE WAYI LOVED!    It wasnt cheesy and it definitely was directed well.  There is one scene in the movie that involves a cat and the song Ben by Michael Jackson and I loved it so much that I have told every single person about it, in great detail, since I have woken up this morning.  My god, I might have to buy the DVD of this movie.  Dont judge me.  I watch good movies too.  But being someone who has always had a weakness for scary b-movies, I just LOVED this one.  And it was better than most.  Very cleverly done.    I am ONE chapter away from finishing  The Manhattan Hunt Club  and once again I am riveted!  Will Joe escape the subway hunt?  Will they cut off his dick and put titties on him?  Will the rats and cockroaches eat him alive once he has been shot and killed?  SO EXCITED TO FINISH THIS BOOK.    I will always love you Willard.  The shirt I am wearing today smells so fiercely like cum, I dont know what to do about it.  Obviously I didnt bathe in real cum this morning.  I think its just that the Russian lady that cleaned my clothes used too much detergent,  but I reek of a blown load and its making me gag.  I truly hope that everyone at the bar I am headed to thinks I smell like cum.  Straight guys LOVE other guys that smell like cum.    SO!  I have been researching very heavily, the different places for Paul and I to take our vacation this summer. I think I have narrowed it down to the Bahamas.  UM!  I MEAN!?!?!?  We are once again using my parents time-share and I find out today that they have shares all over the world.  I checked out Hungary and Singapore and decided that now is not the time to visit these countries.   Truth is, I have never been out of the USA.  EVER.  In fact, the only states I HAVE been in are Massachusetts, Vermont, Florida, California and Virginia.  I dont go on vacation ever and last year I was cautious about taking a whole week away with Paul.  So we went to Orlando and I ran around Disney with gayness coursing through my veins.  This year, I really think we are going to end up in the fucking Bahamas!  I am so excited I could shit.   Oh no, thats the pizza I had for lunch brewing.  I will definitely keep you posted as to these plans.    FUCKING YAY!  Alright, I really do gotta shit myself.  So see you tomorrow.  And will someone PLEASE remind me to clean off the jizz from my shirt before I put it on?   DAYIM!

      Jeannie Dreama has guessed the correct Broadway show from yesterdays entry.  It was  Brigadoon!   I know that I can always count on my Dreama to know her Broadway trivia.  Good job sweets!  You should be expecting a little prize very very soon!  HAPPY MOTHA FUCKING FRIDAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY! Finally.  I cant say that this week dragged, but it definitely wasnt smooth sailing.  Usually I have like no plans for the weekend and I get excited to lay around and sleep the whole time.  But this weekend it is completely the opposite.  I have something to do at every moment of the weekend with the exception of tomorrow afternoon.  That will be the time when I catch up on my MTV marathons and any left over jerk off sessions that I havent yet completed.  But by the end of tonight, I will surely be relieving some THAT pressure.  HEH!  HEH BY MYSELF RELIEVING IT!  heh.  oh.   Last night I had a wonderful talk with my parents.  I told them how the ghetto lady at the haircut place made me bald and ugly.  They laughed over and over as I regaled them with tails of my big fat head.  They were very cute on the phone and I had an excellent time chatting it up.  They are doing very well and I miss them a great deal.  Kellys family is coming down on Sunday and we are all going to brunch.  In a way its like having my family come too.  I mean, we have been friends for so long, it feels like that.  So at least I will get some dosage of family before I have to return to work on Monday.    After I talked to my parents, I called Rita.    Since the move, Rita and I have been struggling to find some sort of middle ground with our friendship.  The last two weeks before she left were very difficult on both of us.  In a lot of ways, it was like a husband and wife getting a divorce much before it was time to do so.  Neither one of us wanted to confront what was happening and after we had moved, the separation anxiety became incredibly hard to bear.  bear?  bare?  bear.  (growl!)  Up until last night, I had only spoken to her once in the last two weeks.  We exchanged some pretty vicious emails this week and yesterday morning I was convinced that she and I were headed for some big troubles.    When she answered her phone last night, it took all I had not to burst into tears of joy.  Just hearing her voice made me immediately melt.  She wasnt angry with me at all and I wasnt accusing her of leaving me behind anymore.  The conversation began easy and over the next hour and a half we sat focused only on eachother.  I told her everything that came into my mind, but of course got off the phone thinking of at least 5 more things I should have mentioned.  We discussed the details of the move and then talked about how each of us felt about towards the other person.  It was a beautiful conversation filled with honesty, confidentiality, and love.  I knew we had to get off the phone after the hour and a half mark, but I could have stayed on talking to her for the rest of the night.  I miss her deeply.  But for the first time since I said good-bye to her, I felt somewhat excited about the new friendship we were going to start developing.   Love you Reets.  AND SHES ENGAGED!!  WOOO HOOOO!!  YEAH!  (GIRLY SCREAMS) (CRYS OF JOY) (REACTIONS BETTER THAN SHE HAS PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED)    To me, its the biggest wedding I will ever be a part of.  So weird that last November I went to my FIRST wedding and it was Ritas sister, Jeannies.  Now next spring (tentatively scheduled) I will be going to my biggest wedding and it will be Ritas.  Do you see how thats weird?  Do you?  Let it go then and stop blaming me for your ignorance.  AND, to top it offit will be a wedding that Paul will accompany me too.  Or if not him, some hot gay stud of my choosing.  OH damn its going to be fun.  And filled with so many tears.  And time to change the subject!!  I watched  ER  last night and was reminded how much I missed this show.  But it made me quite upset.  There was one scene that involved an eyeball and it made me actually have to turn away from the TV in horror.  I think I almost vomited right on my turkey sandwich.  Cuz thats what I had for dinner.  A sad ass turkey sandwich.  And the turkey was slimy.  And KellyI have decided that I hate real mayonnaise.  You can have it.  (When I went to the store to get our apartment some condiments, Kelly put in a request for Real Mayo as opposed to Miracle Whip.  I bought the  Hellmans  brand and when I took my first bite the other night, I about spewed chunks all over the kitchen.  That shit is so fucking nasty, I dont even know how anyone could put it in there mouth.  And remember, I am used to having jizz go in my mouth.) In any case, Kelly, finish the Hells Mans cuz I gotta get me some of the fake shit.    So member how I mentioned that I was reading the book  The Manhattan Hunt Club ?  And how there are scenes in it where one of the guys kills his best friend and girl friend and puts the girls tits on the guys chest and fucks him?  And how I love it?!?!  (hahaha) WELL!  I am almost done with the book because I simply cannot put it down.  But I have had a couple powerful realizations throughout the journey of this book.  FIRST and most shockingly to me, this morning I was reading a chapter about the guy that does the titty cutting.  The guy (Jagger) is 6 ft 5 and 280# of muscle.  So, besides the fact that he is a psycho murderer, I think he sounds like the hottest man on the planet.  The book is not about his sexual fetishes, but it is a wonderful sub-plot.  Well, this big monster of a man, er, I meanstud, is stuck in the subway with the lead character of the book, Joe (my name!).  Joe is a straight man, but Jagger is falling madly in love with him.  Now, the reader knows that Jagger is a scary sexually perverse killer, but in my interpretation of the book, when Joe wakes up and finds that Jagger has his big arms around him, I sport a boner.  I get very excited when Jagger starts really coming on to Joe.  Protecting him and staring provocatively at him.  Well, I realized THIS MORNING (and 50 pages until the end) that Jagger wanting to sex Joe up is supposed to be  terrifying  and  suspenseful .  But because I am a gay man reading this book, I have totally missed out on the fear of this relationship, and have even imagined that I am Joe and Jagger has his big body nestled up to my little body.  When I realized what I was doing, I sat on the subway shifting my eyes back and forth all guilty like.  IT'S NOT MY FAULT THAT I LIKE BIG MEN!  WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO CHOP OFF MY PENIS AND STICK TITTIES ON ME!  So the book isnt as scary because I want to make love to Jagger.   Great.  The other thing I realized is that the book totally blows.  I am getting too old or something, and Im not enjoying readying books about titties being cut off and meals made of rats and slime.  So what am I asking is that if you know of a good book that I should read, please hit me up with some suggestions.  I am looking specifically for two different genres of books.   1) I would LOVE to read a GOOD gay book.  A love story that involves two gay men.  One of which is a bodybuilder.  Simple enough, eh?   2) Would love to read a book that is dynamic, emotional, and powerful.  Doesnt matter the type of book it is, just that its not too difficult of a read.  Not that I am ignorant or uneducated, I just dont want to read a book that is going to force me to exert any unnecessary energy.  I think you get what I am saying.  SO please send me your suggestions!  I am thinking that my next book will be  The Bell Jar  by Sylvia Plath.  Rita has been trying to get me to read it for awhile and Kelly has a copy of it.  So that will most likely be my next read.  But as we know, the book is not about a bodybuilder, so.  I guess thats it.  I drank four mini-boxes of Yoo-Hoo this morning and now my stomach feels as though it might explode with Vitamin D vomit.  What was I thinking as I continued to shove the straw down into each box?  Blech.  Done with that beverage for at least a couple days.    Have great weekends everyone.  I forgot to buy the phone cords I needed to hook up my internet last night.  Will NOT forget to do so today.  If it all works out, I will definitely pop over the next couple of days.  Latas skatas.

       What a day this has been, what a rare mood Im inwhy its (BUM BUM) ALMOST LIKE BEING IN LOVE!!!!!!!!   Name that show and win a prize.  After staring at my hair in my computer rear view mirrors for the second day in a row, I decided that it was high time I got my ass to a barber.  Well, not a barber so much as  SUPERCUTS  right down the street.  I told the stylist what I ALWAYS ask for, I want a 1 blade on the sides and take about a quarter of an inch off the top.  While she buzzed my hair down to the root, she talked my ear off about how she put some woman in the hospital because this bitch was messing with her man.  HmmI should have known then that this was going to be a shit haircut.  As she proceeded to chop my life away, she kept saying uh-huh, this look fly, so fly man, You lookin fuh fuh fuh flyyyyyyyyyyyy.  I wiped my tears and put my jacket on.  (By the way, those tears were figurative)    Because she told me her entire life story while she cut my hair, I felt compelled to tip her more than I would have.  I mean, shitty haircut = shitty tip.  But nope.  Not if its Joe CuttheShit.  Im such a stupid asshole.  As though I have the money to be paying people to do bad things to my body.  And just for the record, my hair is NOT fly.  Its gone.  Thats all.  GONE.  In other news, Paul and I had an INCREDIBLE date last night.  From the minute I showed up at his apartment, he was cute and adorable and sweet.  Unfortunately, he rolled his ankle on Tuesday night and his entire right leg seems about two sizes too big.  He is in massive pain and I got to play nurse all night.  Well, nurse without the sexual touching.  Although the night went extremely well, he still avoided sexual contact.    After we did his laundry, he took me to dinner at a restaurant called  Dolphin .  For appetizers, we had the fried calamari and avocado Caesar salad.  Then we ordered some champagne.  Then for dinner he had the stuffed lobster and I had the swordfish.  It was biz-omb.  We had some nice conversation and only argued once.  After dinner we each ordered a slice of cheesecake and sat and talked some more.  By the end of the meal, I felt like I was going to have to be rolled out of the restaurant and down the street.  But instead, we just walked really slow; Paul complaining about the extra weight his fat hungry ass was giving his swollen ankle.  It was pretty funny.    Once we got home, we watched some TV and I read some more of my book.  We fell asleep in each others arms at around 12:30am.  I thoroughly enjoyed myself.   HERE IS WHY WE FOUGHT: Paul and I heavily discussed our tentative vacation for this summer.  Although he was a COMPLETE prick about the vacation in Florida last summer, guess where he wants to go THIS summer?  Fucking Florida.  What an ass.  I told him that I would like to go somewhere new, but he wants to go somewhere tropical and Florida or the Bahamas is all he could come up with.  I am supposed to visit my gay uncles in California this summer too and if Paul decides against taking our vacation to California, then I will be making the trip with my mom instead.  When Paul asked how I would afford both vacations, I informed him that my uncles will be paying for my plane fare and most of what I do once we get out there.  He then informed me that we would go to California and split his plane fare between the two of us, since I was getting my ticket for free.  After a short debate over his idea, I basically told him to go fuck himself and that I wasnt paying a dime for his plane ticket at all.   Its not my fault that a) you have the money to pay for your ticket, when I dont and b) that MY family is paying for MY ticket.   Paul: Its only FAIR that we split the cost!!!   Its not fair and its my family.  Tough shit.  I will never agree to that.   Paul: Then Im not going to California at all.  Case closed.  WERE not going.   Fine with me.  I want to go with my mom instead.  ASSHO-LEE-O-LEE-O-LEE-DOUCHE (obviously this is the abridged version)  So unless he comes to grips with the fact that I get a free ticket and he doesnt, we will not be going to California together.  I dont know.  Paul and I have some major problems.  And now I am starting to hate him again.  Lets drop this while I still have the fading memory of our wonderful evening together.    Tonight I am installing the internet on my computer.  Our phone line is hooked up and we are ready to go!  I am muchly excited and am counting down the minutes until I get released from jail (work).  You understand.   HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ARI!!!!!   YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAY!  Was very excited to get a phone call from Joanna today.  We made plans to go out tomorrow night.  Mariah will be joining us later on.  Turns out she has plans to go to a show beforehand.  How Mariah always comes up with these mysterious plans, I will never know.  But in any case, it gives Joanna and I a chance to get to know eachother better.  And she will be accompanying me to Pauls apartment so that I dont have to hang out with just him and his family alone.  YIPES.  Getting a little nervous about it now that its approaching.    My head is in 13 places right now.  I gotta get some shit done.  But if I get my computer hooked up tonight, you may see an entry from me writing in my new Times Square bedroom!  WHOO HOOOOOOOOOOOO!  Peace out.

       Ive done it!     I have given myself a comment section again.  As most of you know, last time I did this, shit got way out of control and I pulled it immediately.  So this time, I have resolved to do it a bit differently.   Starting with not getting so personally involved with it.  Its great to have feedback, but I dont want to have to sit and debate or defend anything I write.  You understand.  You always understand.   Thats why you are the clit to my vagina.   Pulsing with erotic excitement.  Well things are finally starting to pick up.    It was very strange for me to go home after work last night, hang out there for a couple of hours, and then go out for a drink.  Way back when I lived in Queens, it was impossible to go home, hang around, and then go out to a bar.  Astoria is great and all, but its not the most convenient hole in the wall.  I dont miss the area at all.  Well, except for when Rita and I would go grocery shopping on Friday afternoons and to Blockbuster.  That was the fucking best.  And also that we got to drive in a car once in awhile.  That was great too.  But then Rita left and so did her darling little Protg.  I miss that little bastid.  Mariah came over at 7pm and we talked and sang along with my CDs until 8pm and then went to Pauls bar.  Let me tell you, we both had heart attacks when we walked through the front door.  It is by FAR, the CLASSIEST place I have ever been in.  The bar is located in this skyscraper that goes to heaven.  Its an office building mostly, and the bar is at the bottom of a long winding staircase.  Mariah was in sweats.  She was terrified of walking down the stairs.  Everyone was staring at us as though we were the belles of the ball.  I called out Presenting Master Cuttheshit and Princess Mariah as we walked in.  A few people rolled their eyes and the rest ignored us completely.    Once we got to the bar and started downing free drinks (thanks to Pauls overwhelmingly benevolent behavior), we started becoming a bit loud.  Mariah starts with Well Pa, these here drinks are purty good.  Id like another.  I respond with Ma, would pass me over the pee-nuts?  Havent had ma dinnuh yet.  All the while performing in our best Southern Droll.  There were some looks and stares and that only made us want to be even more obnoxious.  Mariah does some damn good impressions of people and she had me rolling on the floor with laughter.    Turns out that rich people not only eat peanuts and pretzels while sucking down their drinks, they eat hard-boiled eggs!  Dont ask me why, but supposedly that is like some high-class appetizer.  Mariah and I each peeled our egg and swallowed it in like 2 bites.  Paul walks over and sees that we have eggshell covering our spot at the bar.  He laughs and wipes it away.  Mariah and I make fun of the eggs for awhile and then realize that we are really making fun of ourselves because we cant stop burping and farting sulfur.  We are such trash, its ridiculous.    Paul was absolutely adorable in his little uniform and he seemed completely relaxed behind the bar.  He introduced us to his fellow bartender, who I swear was Cheech Marin.  When he introduced me, I was so impressed by him for referring to me as his boyfriend.  I shook Cheechs hand and said a casual hello.  Cheech responds with The minute I met Paul I asked him if he had a boyfriend.   In context, he said that meaning Paul was flaming.   My jaw hit the floor and I looked at him as though he was the most ignorant fuck on the planet.  Sorry asshole, but youre straight and straight people arent allowed to say stupid shit like that when they first meet a gay person.  Especially when its Cheech Marin.  And especially when Paul isnt flaming at ALL!  If Pauls flaming, then my entire body and soul is charred with gay blackness.  I dont know where this guy was coming from.  He was probably just nervous and that was the first thing that came out of his mouth.  I dont hold a grudge about it, but I will never be the Chong to his Cheech.  Never.  Paul wanted me to stay over at his place, but I decided to go home instead.  He spent the previous two nights in my bed and I was kind of excited to do my own thing.  Meaning masturbate feverishly.  Tonight we are going out on a date.  Its been a couple months since our last one.  We are going out to dinner at some restaurant called Valescos in the East Village.  I think thats the name of it.  But I dont care either way.  As long as Paul is paying, cuz I am busted broke until my next paycheck.  If Paul doesnt pay, we will make  Success Rice  and probably put some leftover chicken on it.  Please let him be paying, please let him be paying.  I could do with a night out to dinner with my boyfriend.  He has been absolutely perfect since our big blowup on Sunday.  I mean, dont let me count my chickens yet, cuz this is how it usually goes before he regresses back to the caveman boyfriend he really is.  I am hoping this is it though.  That he is really committed to making this relationship work now.  And if not, I have already told him that I am serious about removing my stuff from his apartment.  But then I went ahead and made him a copy of the keys to my place.  Hee hee oops.  But how do I play the role of Serious Sally and Loving Larry at the same time?  Im doing my best.  I just pray he continues on the path he is currently heading on.   BTWserious sally and loving larry? Right.   Vomit.  How is it that I need a fucking haircut already.  On my computer desk, I have these two mini-rear view mirrors that I use to watch out for people coming up behind me.  You know, cuz I am a sneaky lying bitch.  Well, instead of seeing the people behind me, I have been staring at my hideous hairstyle all morning.  Lets be honest, my hair looks like an asshole.  And remind me again why I have to have Asian hair, when I am clearly not an Asian?    (Big Sigh)  This weekend has turned into utter craziness.  I have more plans than I can handle!  Member back in the day when I was crying about how lonely I was?  Yeah, well now I am being pulled in about 37 different directions.  No wait, 38 different directions.  On Friday night, I am to hang out with Pauls Aunt, cousin, and sister.  (Remember?the pseudo-lesbians)  After that I am supposed to go out with Mariah to a lesbian bar so that I can get her some vagina.  Sounds fun.  On Saturday, I may be seeing a Broadway show with Pauls family and then I am sure we will have dinner or something.  I will be forced to sit there with a brain aching fake smile and it will be nothing but enduring annoying conversations; most of which will be conducted by his 28 year old know-it-all sister.  I shouldnt be such a prick about them, cuz they arent the most terrible people in the world.  But his sister Steph just talks and talks and talks and if I offer a varying opinion on any subject, she looks me directly in the eye and says No.   Its a lot of fun.   Saturday night is Aris party!  Now THAT I KNOW will be a blast.  On Sunday, I am currently scheduled to have brunch with both Paul and Kellys family.  I have to let one of them down and I think its going to be Paul.  It really depends on how the weekend goes and also on how upset he will be if I dont go.  After brunch, Kelly and I are going to try to see the movie Willard.  I mean, what movie about a thousand rats crawling all over your body while Michael Jacksons Ben plays in the background wont be a hit?   Shit.  I know!  HUGE!  Alright, time for my soup and roll.  I am reading this fantastic book right now called The Manhattan Hunt Club.  Its by John Saul, whom I love although he borders on absurd sometimes.  In one scene of the book, this guy stabs his best friend and girl friend and then puts the girls tits on the guys chest.  Then he fucks the guy.  Its all very normal.  Really, Im not a spikey-haired, Asian psycho.    Boof.

      Busy day, busy day.  Damn you busy day.    Does it ever slow down?  Did I graduate college just to move to NYC to get a job at a better college then where I went?  How does this happen?  And why does it seem as though I will never escape from the clutches of academia?  I dont get it.  Ah wellat least I get paid, right? Sort of.  Sort of right.  Have been a very good boy when it comes to that which I stick in my mouth.  Ok, that came across in a completely different way than I meant it to.  What I  meant  to say is: I have been really good about the food I have been eating.  But I have also been good as to the cocks I have put in my mouth as well.  Meaningnone.  Paul still wont hook up with me.  Last night, although I had masturbated before he got to my house (had to alleviate the pressure somehow, you know?), I said: Tonights the night.  Get naked!  For the first time in a couple of months, he didn't immediately say no.  Instead, he paused, thought about it for a minute and THEN said: No.  We ARE GETTING SOMEWHERE AFTERALL!  My plan is just to remain patient with him about it and to casually bring it up every day until I get me some action! Not that Im not trying to help him figure this whole thing out.  But I do miss it a lot more than I thought I would.  Im 25 years old and I want to be loved!  Physically loved.  yawn.  We are having a birthday party for Ari in about 5 minutes, so I gotta make this quick today.  Why is it that we have parties every 3 days??  Gah!  Does anyone ever get any work done around here?  Oh yeah.  They dont.    I had California Rolls today, in honor of Miss Rita.  They werent very good and now my stomach is raging.  Is it possible to buy BAD Cali rolls?  They were so unappetizing, that when I got to the last one, I bit into it, gagged and spit it into the garbage.  All the Wasabe in the world couldnt make it better.  Tonight I am off to visit Paul at one of his jobs.  I have yet to go get a drink at his bar, but he has been begging and begging for me to come.  Tonight I drag Mariah with me for a drink or two.  And they better be free, cuz I dont think I could even afford the water in this place.  Its classy and snooty and why am I going there again?  Ari has planned her birthday party for this Saturday.  WHOO HOO ROCK!  Its going to be weird to meet some of the fellow bloggers out there.  For example, A Girl Named Bob.  Is she a real live person?  WEIRD!  I have roped Mariah into going with me for a drink.  It should be pretty convenient since we are going out with Pauls family earlier in the evening.  Cuz UM!  Pauls family wants to get to know me????  I thought they wanted all gay people dead!  But Paul seems to think I will live through the night, so wish me luck!  He is planning on taking them to a show on Saturday evening and if I behave myself, maybe he will buy my ticket too!  Then I can see a Broadway show for free!  Now THAT could be fun.  And less talking amongst the gay boys and the family.    Although I SWEAR that his sister and his aunt are raging lesbians. I mean, both could defeat me in an arm wrestling match.  EASILY.  They are some tough looking bitches.  But Paul swears that although they have dirty fingernails and can bench 450#, they are straight.  Who knows.    Ok, the housekeeper just came over to me, tapping on her watch and informing me that its time for the party.  Im sorry, but cant the housekeeper see that I am BUSY typing in my journal?!?!  I mean, gosh!  Alright, now my annoying boss is up my ass.  And hes big.  So I gotta go eat some shitty Entemanns cake.   Adios and something more clever.  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$  Okay, so the party is over.  It actually was pretty painless.  Ari and I hung out at her party for about 10 minutes and then spent the rest of the time hiding out smoking cigarettes.  Now THATS what I call a party.    RITAI sent over Michelle to buy the cakes and stuff for the party and on the UFM form, I wrote $30 thinking that that should be MORE than enough to buy a cake or two and some soda.  Well, Michelle spent the entire $30 on 4 cakes, a basket of fruit, 3 gallons of soda, and the most expensive juice she could find.  In fact, she spent $30.06 and says to me: I was so close to the limit that I had to put in $.06 of my own money. Oh Michelle.  My bad.  I should  have explained better that we dont throw $30 parties.  Hee hee.  Guess I wont be getting that raise afterall.    AlrightaRdios!

      Happy Monday!  Actually, for the first time in about 5 years, this Monday doesnt suck.  I feel rested.  I feel content.  And I dont feel nearly as much anxiety as I have felt over the last week.    Friday night was random.  Mariah was too hung over from Thursday to go back out on Friday, so Kelly and I went out with Pauls roommates, Jen and Lisa.  Member how I hated them with my every being?  Well, of course, now I am friends with them.  Its been a couple weeks in the making, but I finally just stopped caring and then they wanted to be Besties.  Who knows.  Either way, I had a very good time talking to them and hanging out Friday night.  Kelly got tired and we went home at around 2:30am, but then we ended up doing our weekend ritual of staying up until 5:30am talking our faces off.  I had a nice time overall.    Saturday was the worst day of my life.   Ok, not really at all, but it was pretty horrible.  Paul was supposed to come over at 4:30pm to watch movies and maybe go out to dinner.   At 11:30pm that night, with still no word from Paul, I gave up and went to McDonalds for dinner.  Unfortunately, my home phone is still not hooked up, so there was no way for him to reach me.  Thank God we got cable on Friday afternoon, or my Saturday would have truly been a day spent in loneliness hell.  (And by the way, our cable fucking rocks!  We have like 130 channels of basic service and also this thing called Videos on Demand.  I rented  Men In Black 2  and  XXX  just by hitting a button on my remote control.  It cost me $3.95 each and I had the movies for 24 hours!  I saw  Men In Black  twice!  Its $50 a month and I am in pig shit cable lovin heaven) I fell asleep Saturday night wondering where the fuck Paul had gone.  Why didnt he show up?  And also, why is this the 3rd time in a week that he stood me up?  Sunday afternoon, Paul calls me on Kellys cell phone and I talk to him.    Me:  Hi.  What happened last night? Paul:  I ended up taking an extra shift at work and didnt have time to call. Me:  Paul, this is the 3rd time this week that I have waited around at my apartment for you.  And this is the 3rd time that you havent shown up.  Or even called. Paul:  SORRY JOE!  But you know I gotta work.  At this point, I completely lose my shit.  I am talking screaming at the top of my lungs losing my shit.  Our conversation lasted about 10 minutes, during all of which I was vein poppingly yelling in his face.  Eventually I hung up on him, because the frustration was just too much too bear.  He called back about a half-hour later.    During this phone conversation, I broke up with him.   I told him never to call me again and that I was going over to his place while he was at work to get all of my shit.  As far as I was concerned, this kid shit on me for the last time.  He got very upset and I could hear his voice cracking with tears.  I had no sympathy.  I felt so hurt by him.    He never wants to see me.  He chooses work over me EVERY time.  He hasnt kissed me or made love to me in over a month and a half.  He wasnt around at all before my move to Times Square and still hasnt been around since I have moved in.  He stands me up every time we have plans.  And to top it all offhe still doesnt treat me with any sort of kindness or respect.    I had had enough.  I hung up on him again.  Kelly and I then went grocery shopping in Union Square.  I hadnt gone yet and I really needed to get out of the house and do something productive.  At that point, I had been lying in my bed for over 24 hours.  During our trip to the store, Kelly and I talked over the fights that I had with Paul.  I was still very angry and hurt and had an incredibly difficult time trying to vocalize the way I was feeling.  Kelly was patient with me and allowed me to vent the way that I needed to vent.    Upon returning from the grocery store, Kelly made us a wonderful dinner.  We had fish and pasta and I tried Brussels Sprouts for the first time in my life.  I loved the first two I had and after that, they became too much to bear.  But the dinner was eggselent and I thoroughly enjoyed our first sit down dinner in our new apartment.    While we were eating, I got a chance to think about the situation with Paul with more of a clear mind.     I called him right before I went to bed and said: If you still want to come over tonight, you can.  CLICK  At 11pm, Paul came into my bedroom.    Seeing his face made my heart instantly melt.  He sat down on the bed and he and I just stared at eachother while he ate his store bought mash potatoes and seafood salad.  When he was done eating, I said:   Well, what do you have to say for yourself?  Paul went on and on about how he knows he needs to put in more of an effort.  He promised (yet again) to work on the things that he needs to work on.  Against my better judgement, I have given him another shot at being a boyfriend.  When I asked him about the lovemaking he said that he is just not emotionally ready to dive back into it just yet.  Without completely exposing his personal life, let me just say that I know what he is referring to and as long as he is open and honest with me, I can accept his need to push off the intimacy of our relationship.  I mean, Im in no rush anyway.  It would just be nice to be kissed once in a while.  Well see  He and I had a wonderful evening together (as we usually do when he actually shows up) and went to sleep at 2am.  We held eachother all night long and when I woke up this morning, I had my cigarette staring at his adorable little face.  How is it possible that I can hate and love someone so intensely?    I just want things to be good.  Today is Mariahs birthday.  WHOO HOO!  Happy Birthday RYE!  Tentatively having dinner with her family and friends tonight, but I havent heard from her all day, so who knows if that will go through.  If not, Paul and I are planning something for her for later in the week.    Aris birthday is on Thursday.  As soon as she figures out what she is doing, I will figure out if I can go!  She is looking at this place called The Remote Lounge or something like that.  I checked out their website and was horribly impressed by the joint.  They have cameras all around the bar that take pictures at random times throughout the evening.  Then you can send the pictures through their website to your friends.  Its fucking cool.  I am rooting for her to pick that place.  But wherever she chooses, I will be happy if its affordable and full of vodka tonics.   You know how it goes.  And thats it, I guess.  Paul is staying over again tonight, but of course working until 11pm.  He and I are so overdue for a real date night.  But with him working two jobs, the chance of that happening any time in the near future seems incredibly unlikely.    OH BTWhavent been smoking the pot in over 3 days.  I do feel much more awake and clear-headed.  Also, I am in a strangely good mood today and wonder if thats related.  Who knows.  My goal is not to buy another bag until Friday.  Lets see if I can make that happen.   Tonight is my first day of working out after work too.  Lets see if I can make that happen as well.    Ah geez.  Can I just have the perfect body now please?    Please?  Please?  Cheese?  Yum.

      Omigod what have I done to myself?  HORK.    What was supposed to be a casual night out at the bars What was supposed to be an easy beginning to Mariahs big birthday celebration tonight What was supposed to be an hour or two at a local lesbian bar  HORK.  I sit here at my desk and wonder how the fuck I woke up with blood dried all over my arm.  I look down at my leg and wonder how there is dried pizza sauce all over the pair of jeans I am wearing.  My stomach churns and burns and I am stuck somewhere between vomiting all over my desk and shitting out everything thing that went down my gullet in the past 12 hours.    Mariah got to my house last night at around 7pm.  We drank some beers, talked for a couple hours, and got to Pauls apartment at 9:30pm.   From that point on, shit was crazy.  Mariah, Lisa, Jen, Paul, and myself sat around and talked some more before we were to head out to the Meow Mix.  Fucking purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.  At one point during our pre-gaming, I burst into tears AGAIN.  Can I have a day WITHOUT crying?  I mean, I am rapidly turning into the biggest fucking baby on the planet.  Nobody wants Joe around cuz you know that tears are sure to follow.  My friends are being amazing about everything.  Never making me feel as though my emotions are too much for them to handle.  Last night I didnt feel nearly as alone as I have felt over the last week.    We arrived at Meow Mix at 11pm and that is when things start to get a little fuzzy.  You know, although I have been known to drink on a semi-regular basis, I am always in control, and maintain an appropriate level of drunkenness.  But last night, as the vodka tonics came and went faster than I could breathe, I found myself experiencing this new level of wasted asshole.  Lets seeHere is a recap of what I do remember of the evening:  *I didnt spend that much money.  Paul spent about $250.  The kid just buys drinks.  He doesnt even ask if anyone needs them.  Kelly showed up at Meows with her friend Stephanie and this other guy named Evan.  (Evan was pretty cool, although I dont actually remember talking to him at any point.  And now as I type this I remember him bumming a cigarette from me while I was being stalked by the only gay old man in the bar.  Ok, weird that I remember that.)  So, as I was saying, I noticed Paul was buying a drink and I went over to give him money for mine. I realized that he had purchased 8 drinks.  There werent even 8 people with us.  So yeah, Paul just buys all the vodka in the place, thinking that people are just going to stand around holding 3 drinks and dancing.  No wonder we all ended up so out of our minds.  *Mariah fell down on the ground hard and Kelly rescued her in the knick of time.  But not before completely ruining a new pair of pants she had gotten earlier in the day.    *Paul and I go to Rays Pizza and buy food for everyone, cuz we left the bar earlier then everyone else.  I think we spent like $30 on food.  Then we get home and I smoke a bowl and realize that I am hella fucked up and Paul and I sit and debate our relationship for an hour.  At some point, the meatball that I was eating rolled down my leg and out the kitchen door.  I must have laughed and walked on past it cuz this morning I found sauce on my jeans and a trail of dried sauce in a perfect line coming out of the kitchen.  Yet, there was no meatball at the end of the trail.  Did I pick it up and finish eating it?  Probably.  Ive been known to do worse.  *The music at the bar was from 1993 and included such hits as Are you down with OPP? and Humpty Dance.  I liked it for the most part, but then I hated it.  yeah.  yeah thats exactly how I felt about it.  *I took Pauls keys from him cuz I thought he would lose them.  Then we get out of the cab in front of his apartment and he cant find his keys.  And I start bitching at him about how I should have taken the keys when I had the chance.  I buzz his house buzzer for like twenty minutes and his roommate Lisa finally crawls out of bed and lets us in.  Once upstairs, and after apologizing to Lisa, I take off my jacket and empty my pockets and the keys fall out onto the floor.  I felt incredibly sheepish.  *Somehow I scraped my knuckles against the side of a wall and decided that it was perfectly normal to let it bleed all night long and all over my entire arm.  Imagine my horror when I woke up this morning and saw blood everywhere.  After scrubbing and cleaning myself, sure that I was to find a HUGE gash somewhere on my arm, I realized that all of the blood came out of three tiny knicks on my knuckles.  Lame.  It could have been a great story about mangling my body, but instead its puss story about knicks and shit.  *The alarm went off at 8:50am and I screamed to Paul: Why would you set the alarm?  Turn it off!  Paul snoozes once and 7 minutes later the alarm goes off again.  Turn off the alarm!  Its fucking SATURDAY!!  No Joe, its Friday and you have to be to work in an hour.  What?  WHAT?  WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!?!?!  Two rounds of intense diarrhea immediately follow.  And thats pretty much it.  I had an enormous amount of fun.  But boy am I paying for it today.  I called Mariah as soon as I got to work to make sure that she was doing ok.  Today is her second day at her new job and when she called me back she sounded in MUCH worse shape than me.  Mariahs new job is as a nanny for a 10-week-old baby.  For the last two days, the mother of the child has stayed home to make sure that Mariah is comfortable with the apartment and with the baby.  Yet, Mariah keeps calling me from the bathroom, saying that the lady is driving her crazy and wont leave her alone with the baby ever.  I picture her standing in the closet with the water running, sneaking phone calls to me.  It makes me die laughing to picture her at work, hung over like fuck, and hiding out in the bathroom every 20 minutes or so to call and complain about her new job.    This afternoon, Paul and I are taking a LONG nap together and having a grease-filled lunch.  Then we will get ready to go out again!  Ugh.  Wish I could have a day off in between all this partying, but that is just impossible at this point.  Paul has proclaimed that he will only be drinking juice.  I have proclaimed that I will only be drinking vodka and juice.  Oh Joe.  Calm yourself a bit.  I must have a wish to spend the rest of the weekend sitting on the toilet.   I can tell you this thoughno more meatballs at 4:30 in the morning.    Alright.  Hopefully will have a phone and cable hooked up by today.  YAY.  fucking yay.    SHABBAT SHALOM!  ********Just got off the phone with Kelly.  No phone until next Wednesday.  Shit fuck.  Thats irritating.  They decided to give us a month and a half free service though, cuz they have screwed up this installation process like 3 times.  So thats cool.  But no phone or internet at my house until next week.  The cable better still come today though.  Cuz reallyI am about ready to kill the WB channel.  Buffy and Dawson are quickly becoming my archenemies.  I fucking hated them to begin with and now I am forced to watch that or the incredibly unintelligent Gilmore Girls.    Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz  Oh sorry.  Even writing the name Gilmore Girls puts me right to sleep.  Hasta la pasta.    Snort.

      Holy fuck.  I am telling youdisaster and destruction seem to be following me wherever I go.  Well, that is definitely an exaggeration, but it just seems as though chaos and I are becoming very good bed buddies.    I walked into work this morning to find that the front desk area in which I work had been completely broken into.  Over the course of the night, some asshole took a crowbar and pried off two file cabinet drawers in order to steal $300 in cash that Ari and I were responsible for.  They then proceeded to try and pry open the office door of the Accounts Payable department.  Imagine my shock when I walked into work and saw my office space completely destroyed.  It was a bit upsetting.  I mean, this is mine and Aris work station and someone came in and broke into our personal shit.  I dont know.  It sucks.    The police came and took a report from me.  Then they dusted for fingerprints.  It was all very melodramatic and random.  And thats that.  Kind of a crazy way to begin the workday.  Last night I went home to my apartment thinking that it would be nice to have some alone time.   However, once home for more than 20 minutes, I started to get incredibly lonely and uptight.  I missed Rita and I missed having someone to talk to before I retired to my bedroom.  I decided to call Mariah.  It was the best decision I could have made.  We talked for an hour about all sorts of things.  It started with me once again breaking into sobs over the move to Times Square.  Then we talked about the fact that she just got two moles removed from her face.  Then we talked about how the two moles she got removed  from her face got infected and how she had to go back to the doctor to get them "re-cut out.  Then Mariah burst into tears because when they went back in to remove the rest of the mole from her nose, they took a huge chunk of skin out as well.  After making her describe the entire wound to me in detail, I have decided that she looks exactly like the Cryptkeeper.    She is coming over to my place tonight to pre-game before we go out to the bars.  I told her that I would inspect the damage caused by this doctor and that we would figure out to what to do next.  Mariah is an absolute KNOCKOUT of a girl.  She is probably the hottest friend I got.  And with her personality, she is suh suh suh SLAMMIN!  Yet, with this chunk out of her nose, I know she feels horribly ugly and terrible about herself.  Time for me to step in and make her feel better.  I told her that I had been collecting skin cells from everyone at work so that I can graft a new nose for her.  I think she felt very relieved after hearing that.   American Idol  is a pile of dogshit. The end of that topic.    So the one great thing about moving to Times Square is my amazing commute!  It takes me exactly 18 minutes to get to work.  I dont even have enough time to fall asleep on the train.  I get an extra hour of sleep a night and the walk to the subway is fucking cake!  And I dont mean yellow cake.  I mean white cake with sprinkle topped frosting!  YEM! Sike, I hate all kinds of cake.  You understand.  My parents have been incredibly supportive about the fact that my brother is heading off to war.  My dad called me this morning at 9am again to check up on me.  At first I thought he was DEFINITELY calling to tell me that someone had died today.  I figured that I couldnt get away with him calling two mornings in a row and not have someone be dead.  But instead, he was just making sure that I was holding up okay.  I assured him that I am, in fact, doing okay.  We had a nice conversation and I got off the phone feeling good about all that we talked about.    I then called my mom and asked her how she was doing after having heard the bad news.  My mom is always incredibly strong about things.  At least on the outside.  On the inside she is angry and scared and trying to cope.  I could sense that she was struggling to come up with words of comfort for me.  I let her know that I was doing okay with it all and I could feel her start to collapse a bit.  Just as I thought she was going to start crying, she immediately picked herself up and choked down the sobs.  Man.  She is so strong and in such control.  I admire her.  So much.  Paul has been MIA for the past two days.  He has been working like a crazy horse.  For the past two nights, he was supposed to come over to my apartment after work and sleep in my bed with me.  But on both occasions he bailed and didnt even call to let me know.  Now yes, granted I dont have a phone, but he knows Kellys cell phone number and he never uses it.  Last night Kelly left me with her phone and I called him twice to let him know that I would wait up for him.  (Even though he told me that he would get out of work at 9:30pm)  I finally fell asleep at around 12am.  No word from Paul.  As I type this, I get increasingly more angry about it.  What the fuck is wrong with this kid?  As I was drifting off to sleep last night, I convinced myself that he just doesnt love me anymore.  He isnt attracted to me physically and he is bored of my drama.  I fell asleep confidant that over the next couple of weeks I will be dumped.    Dumped.  What a fucked up term when used in this scenario.  When I woke up this morning I didnt feel nearly as self-pitying about this whole situation as I did last night.  So what if he breaks up with me?  He moved to NYC to be with me.  If he dumps me, then he can make his own friends in this city, cuz I am taking mine back.  He just blew $4000 on the move from Boston.  Breaking up with me now would be nothing short of a poor financial decision on his part.  I dont know.  I am only writing this shit, cuz I dont know what to think.  I have never dated a guy who refused to kiss and touch me.  Usually its the other way around.  I cant keep the horndogs OFF my shit.  Paul also carries no responsibility for this relationship.  He is SUPPOSED TO call me sometimes, right?    Fuck I dont know.  If you could meet me in person, you would be shocked that I am putting up with (and have put up with) this kind of shit from someone who is supposed to be my boyfriend.  It is so not in my personality to put up with this type of garbage.  I have never wanted to be around people who dont want to be around me.  GOD!  It makes me so frustrated.  I am SO TIRED of begging him to be there for me.  I do realize that he is busy trying to make money in order to afford living in NYC.  But honestly, he makes DOUBLE what I make at my job and I find a way to be a boyfriend.  Who knows.    He just called me.  Why is it that he ALWAYS calls when I am writing in my journal about him.  He apologized profusely about not calling last night.  I wasnt having it.  You cant apologize every day about something and then continue to fuck it up again and again. Eventually these apologies run super thin.  God, its so irritating.  You know, I dont count on Paul for my entire happiness.  But can I count on him for any sort of happiness at all?  FUCK!  He disappoints me on almost every level.  Anyone else interested in taking me out on a date?   I am almost to that point.  I told Paul the other night that if he doesnt start being intimate with me again (and soon) then I will be going out and hooking up with randoms.  I need to feel sexually wanted. If he doesnt want to give it to me, I will get it from someone else.  I am the only 25 year old I know that is still a virgin.  And that has had a boyfriend for over 3 years, yet hasnt been good and kissed in over 2 months.  FUCK THIS SHIT.  FUCK IT FUCK IT FUCK IT FUCK IT FUCK IT!    Hes gotta go.  Alright, now that I am pissed off, I am going to go home.  Thank God this day is over.  I really hope tonight is fun.  I could use a bit of fun in my life right now.    Actually, what I could really use is for a huge bodybuilder to walk into my life, pick me up into his arms, and fuck me real good.  Hows that sound?  Any takers?  ****Sorry that the entries this week have been kind of jumbled and confusing.  My head is in 13 different places right now and it is so hard for me to clear it all out and focus when I am typing.  It will get better, I promise.  For now, please just deal with my erratic train of thought and my horrible, almost un-intelligible, grammar.

      TGIW!  Thank God its Wednesday, of course!  Once the day is over, we will be just that much closer to the weekend.  And we all know how I feel about the weekend!  Pretty damn good!   I need some sleep.  I finally fell into a half-ass slumber some time around 12:30am last night and I feel completely beat.  I dont understand.  I was basically falling asleep while eating my pizza dinner, but once I took off my clothes, brushed my teeth, and got into bed, I sat there completely wired.  I hate when that happens.  I must have woken up every hour and then when my alarm finally went off, I rolled out of bed as though I had been up partying all night.  Yeah, this story sucks my cock, so lets pretend like I never began it.  Spoke with Rita yesterday from work and found out that she got ENGAGED on Sunday!  DOH!?!?  I mean, whaaaa?!  We all knew it was coming, but it figures that it happens 48 hours after she moves to Syracuse.  I wanted it to happen while she was in NYC with me so that she and I could jump around and scream like lil girls.  But insteadI sorta screamed on the phone when she told me.  I wish I had given her a better reaction.  It was the first time I had talked to her since she left and there was so much shit going through my head to begin with that when she mentioned the engagement, I was like yay! instead of  YAY!.   I think you understand what I mean.  Either way, YAY I AM GOING TO BE A BRIDESMAID!  Okay, maybe I wont get to wear the frilly dress and all, but hells if I aint going to her Bacherlorette party.  Rita is pretty classy, so she probably wont have naked mens running around in g-strings.  But if I have anything to do with the planning, there will be at least one naked mens for me!  In fact, if I can get this gut of mine in shape by the time the wedding comes around, maybe I can jump out of the cake myself and be the naked mens!  Wishful thinking.  I had pizza AGAIN for lunch today.    BTWthat means pizza for dinner last night and then pizza for lunch today.  SOMEBODY STOP ME!  (Say that like Jim Carrey from  The Mask )  Sike.  Dont say it that way ever.  There is no date set yet for the wedding.  I am thinking that Rita found it best to unpack her boxes before she settled on a date for the marriage.  Gosh.  Rita is the first member of our group of friends, from college, that has gotten engaged.  Pretty big!  I couldnt love her boyfriend/fianc any more than I do.  He is the love genius.  His personality matches hers perfectly and they will be undeniably happy together.  Wow.  Engaged at 26.   I will never know such a thing.  CONGRATS to my favorite RITA LOVELY!   ~HUGE KISS AND HUGS!~  I have yet to tell everyone at work that Rita has gotten the ring.  I told Ari and my mom about it, but I havent told anyone else.  I wanted Rita to be able to break the news to them.  Its her big news afterall.  But if she doesnt tell everyone by this weekend, I know I will blurt it out.  It was damn near impossible not telling Kelly last night.  Good thing she is working over the next couple of days or I would surely spill my gay beans.  Mariahs birthday is on Monday.  Tomorrow night I am going with her to a lesbo bar in the city and on Friday, a bunch of us are taking her out to a different lesbo bar for drinks, etc.  I will do whatever she wants to do.  Unfortunately, her devil roommate, Rachel, is going on Friday.  Rachel has already told Mariah that she wants to go to at least one straight place Friday night, before we go to the lesbo bar.    Im sorry.  Whos birthday is it Rachel?  You fucking selfish piece of shit garbage bitch.  I wish I could explain to you how truly awful Rachel is.  Shes sowellsoumgodshe is frozen barf.  And I say frozen, cuz she is one uptight and frigid cunt.    Now I think you understand.  But Mariah is excited about this weekend and all that she asks is that everyone gets along and has a good time.  So what she really means is:  Joe, behave yourself, but if people get out of hand, please take care of business.  And that I surely will do.  With guilty pleasure.  I got bad news today.  My dad called me at work this morning at around 9:15am.  The minute I answered the phone, I go: Oh God.  Who died?  Cuz he only calls me at work (and early in the morning) if something bad has happened.  And sure enough, something bad has happened.  My brother  received his orders this morning for the war in Iraq.    We have been dreading this moment since the minute the two planes hit the World Trade Center Towers.  At this point he is unable to tell us where he is going.  He was notified that he will not be front line and most likely will be part of the clean-up duty/stabalize the country mission that will take place immediately following the invasion.  This is good news, but its not the best news.  (best news obviously being that he comes home to his big brother right now)  Unfortunately, he will be leaving for training and combat preparation in 3 weeks.  We were hoping and kind of counting on the fact that he wouldnt be leaving until the beginning of June, maybe late May.  But instead, he will most likely be gone by the end of March.    My brother has been trained to shoot people in the face.  He will be driving tanks and will be carrying loaded weapons from the moment he wakes up till the moment he goes to bed.  He is also in charge of a 60 person platoon.  Quite a lot of responsibility for a 23 year old.  There is always a chance that he will be killed on one of these missions, but the best I can do at this point is trust in Gods inevitable plan for Winfields life.  There is no use in sitting here and worrying every day about it.  I have no power or control over this situation at all.  Man.  I just love this kid with every ounce of my being.  I am the older brother.  I should be looking out for him, giving him the advice that he needs.  Instead, I sit here in comfy America watching the whole thing unfold on a television.  Its frustrating and its heart breaking.  But its not the end of the world.  And if it werent for people like Winfield, my life wouldnt be what it is now.  (which is a piece of shit.)   Sike. Sorta sike.  I will definitely keep everyone posted as to how he is doing.  If you are the praying type, say one for all the men and women who are on the front lines of this thing.  I am personally uncomfortable with the idea of war, but I stand behind my country in its decisions.  Its one thing to argue a war before it happens.  Its completely another to watch other peoples loved ones get slaughtered for your freedom while you sit there talking about how wrong the war is.  Whether or not you want this war to happen, please remember that our friends and family members are risking their lives so that you can have an opinion.   I am so proud of my brother.  He is doing something that I could never do.  He is risking his life for me.    Thank you Winfield.  Thank you on behalf of all of us.  Well, I guess that is it for today.  Its weird writing this journal with Rita being so far away.  Usually she is right in the next room as I sit here and type.  I hope she is still reading.    HA!  I know she is.  She is my biggest fan!  My biggest  Swimfan  that is.    Member that lame movie?  yeah me either.  PEAYCE!  (in the middle east)

      Man alive!  The last 5 days have been nothing short of a whirlwind.    It would be ridiculous for me to dive into a day by day summary since so much happened in such little time.  Basically, Rita and her incredible boyfriend, Randy, in conjunction with Mariah and Paul, moved Kelly and I into Times Square.  It was BY FAR the hardest move I have ever been a part of.  Imagine trying to get 2,000 pounds of bullshit up 4 flights of stairs.  It was damn near impossible and I almost vomited from sheer exhaustion.  It was a beast, to say the least.  Beast and least.  Kelly and I helped pack up Ritas U-Haul at the crack of dawn on Friday morning and after a gut wrenching sobfest, she and her boyfriend set off for their new home, Syracuse.  Pulling away from our Queens apartment, while waving goodbye to Rita, was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do.  Seeing her standing on the curb, tears streaming down her face Me sitting in the cab, chest heaving from losing my co-joined twin It was awful.  As we drove over the Queensboro Bridge that morning, the three of us wiped our tears and looked at what was to be our new home.  THE ISLAND OF MANHATTAN!  Needless to say, the excitement was at a bare minimum.  Upon arriving at the apartment, Kelly, Mariah and I worked our asses off trying to set up the new pad.  We had planned on taking a quick nap, but once we got started, we didnt stop until the place was finished.  By 5pm that evening, Kelly and I had managed to set up our entire place.    Of course, it took us through the weekend to tweek the rooms.  We have about 3 apartments worth of stuff and had to find some way to fit it all into our 4-room apartment.  It was hard and frustrating and without beer, I dont know if I could have barreled through it.  Kellys friend, Stephanie, came by Friday night and was our first visitor.  She was much impressed with what we had done with the place.  She hung out for a bit and I think my head finally hit the pillow at around 3am.    Saturday morning my parents came down to visit.  The location and the amount of work we had already put into the place FLOORED them.  They took me to K-mart and bought me $200 worth of stuff.  (I was planning on paying for half of the stuff, but my mom informed me, at the cash register, that not only am I not getting a tax refund this year, I owe the IRS $400!  After a brief, tear welling breakdown, my parents offered to help me out in whatever way they can.)  After we got back from K-mart, my parents worked their asses off trying to put together the stuff we bought.  We then proceeded to drink beers and play cards for the rest of the night.  My dad and I stayed up until 4:30am talking about anything and everything.    On Sunday I barely moved out of my bed.    Yesterday I had to stay home in order to fix all that should have been fixed by the time we moved in.  Lights, heat, hot water, etc.  It was a frustrating day, but ended on a very high note.  Paul came by around 5pm and he was AMAZING.  He was supportive, funny, and a big help.  We ordered dinner and laid in each others arms for the rest of the night.    How do I feel now that the tornado had spit me out?  Well, I feel empty.  I feel lost.  I feel like I have no idea how to start over.  I feel like half of my heart moved to Syracuse.    Its been a lot harder adjusting to Ritas absence than I originally thought it would be.  I was sure that with the new environment I wouldnt have any time to think about the fact that she was gone.  Unfortunately that has not been the case.  On Sunday night I managed to get some reception on my TV antennae (can we get fucking cable already?!?!!?) and there was a documentary on eczema on PBS.  I watched it and was reminded of a story that Rita told me once, about how this girl had an online journal and wrote about how her body was covered in the stuff.  Instead of crying for the girl with scaly skin, I cried for Rita and for myself.  And I cried hard.  In fact, I put myself right to sleep.  And it was 7pm!    This whole thing has just been overwhelming.    I dont know where anything is in Times Square.  Laundry?  Blockbuster?  A grocery store?  Gosh, I feel lost.   Its rather intimidating walking out of my apartment and right into the heart of Broadway.  There is no time to prepare.  One minute you are in my safe, little, quiet apartment, the next minute, you are standing in front of Beauty and the Beast and several thousand tourists.  I know that eventually I will love it.  But for now.for now its really lonely.    Tonight I am going home to drink some beers and to forget.  I have already finished decorating my room, so tonight I will put photos in a couple albums I got lying around.  Fucking exciting, eh?  Paul works until 10pm, so I am meeting him at his job and then staying over night at his place.  I just dont want to be alone.    Kelly is being great about everything.  We are getting along wonderfully just the two of us.  But we are in different places with this move.  She definitely has more excitement about it than I do.  I am sure I will join her in jubilation, but its just going to take me some time.  For now, I lament the fact that Rita is living 5 hours away.    My heart hurts so bad.  Ok, gotta get back to work.  Lunch is almost over.    Will try to be more positive tomorrow.

      Pretty nervous right now.    I have to leave work at 3:30pm today to get to my first audition ever in NYC!  YIPES!  Its not going to be too difficult since I only have to do a cold reading.  I dont have to prepare a monologue or anything, so its not like I am actually performing for them.  I anticipate that they will hand me a very generic paragraph of literature and I will have to read it with some sort of conviction.  Sounds easy enough.  What I am hoping is that I will walk in to the interview, they will see how devastatingly handsome I am, and offer to represent me right away.  Now, wouldnt THAT be great?  I have been praying and praying all day that I will be able to relax in front of these people, that I will be able to be myself.  I havent worked this long on a winning personality just to go in and act as though I am shy or that I possess no sense of humor.  But sometimes I freeze up and let my nerves take over.  In all honesty, if I take a huge dump before I go, I will most likely be fine.  Most of my nerves come from my asshole anyway.    The other night when Paul and I were pseudo hooking up and watching television, we came across the strangest thing!  A regular TV program came on, but it was engineered for the blind.  The actors all said their lines as normal, but thrown in intermittently was a narrator that would start describing the scene as though we had both just lost our sight.   For example, if I was blind, this is what I would have heard:  Johnny:  Susan, I asked you to please pick up Daniel from school today.  Where were you? Susan:  I forgot all about it!  Work has had me swamped and I had no way Johnny:  NO SUSAN!  You have done this repeatedly in the past. Narrator:  Johnny picks up Daniel under his arms and places him on a chair in the kitchen. Susan:  Dont yell at me.  I support this household financially, so you should expect that sometimes you may have to go out of your way to help. Narrator:  Johnny shrugs his shoulders and turns his back to Susan. Susan:  Look at me when I am talking to you. Daniel:  Mommy, dont yell at daddy! Susan:  Shut your fucking face Daniel.  SHUT UPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!! Narrator:  Daniel begins to cry.  Hahahaok, I started to get a bit carried away with the fake plot line I just created.  But you see what I am talking about.  It was so weird to sit there, pretend we were blind, and still know what was going on.  I mean, to be honest, it wasnt much fun and we only remained on the channel for a couple minutes.  But how weird!  I think Paul said it best when he said: You knowif I was blindI think I would give up television all together.  There are other things that blind people can do for fun.   And you know what?  There is.  Like reading books.  Well, Braile-ish books.  I dont know.  Leave me alone.  My dad talked to my brother from Baghdad yesterday.  My brother only had a few minutes to talk, but he let my dad know that he is safe and doing well so far.  He feels confident about his training and according to my dad, was ready to complete the mission and get home as soon as possible.  Gosh, its strange how much more I miss him now that I know he is in the desert and not sitting in his plush apartment.  I mean, Im still not going to see him any more than I would have if he was still on his Germany ARMY base, but just knowing that he was there and not holding an assault weapon in Iraq, made me feel like he was still close.  And safe.  But it will all be fine.  Just gotta keep telling myself that.  Stay positive!  BTWif one more person tells me to stay positive, I am going to punch them in their cunt.   I ate so healthy yesterday!  I never eat breakfast, but yesterday I decided to start and with a banana.  For lunch I had a salad and a yogurt.  For dinner I had chicken breast and green beans!  I was so proud of myself.  But then I made the mistake of sharing a bottle of wine with Kelly and eating an entire loaf of garlic bread.  Then I found some candy in my room and ate that too.  Then I chewed some gum, cuz seriouslywhy was I ruining my whole health day by shoving candy down my gullet?  I know why.  Cuz I have a lazy eye.  Ok, Sike no I dont.  (I forget that I cant make those jokes, cuz no one on here knows if that is true or not)  Speaking of which  When Rita came to visit, one of the first things she said was: I thought I was going to have to talk to you about your eating habits cuz on your journal you say that you have gained so much weight.  Joe, you look exactly the way you did when I left.  Which is beautiful!  Ok, so I made up the last sentence.  But it got me to thinkingdoes everyone that reads my journal think I am a huge beast?  Cuz let me just clarify for everyonewhen I say that I am gaining weight and that I am a gigantic monster with blue cheese laden french fries hanging out of my mouth, I am totally kidding.  Well, not about the french fries.  Those are hanging out of my mouth.  But definitely about the gigantic part.  I am pretty.  Very pretty. Alright, I hate what I have just written.  Its like trying to convince a deaf person that I play really beautiful music.    Ok, what is with me and the blind and deaf today?  So sorry to offend anyone with these inflictions. snores.    YIPES!  Two more hours until my audition.  Someone say a prayer for me!  And if not, Ill just say another one for myself.    I really hope this goes well.    Really hope.

      Before I discuss the big thing I need to discuss, there are two things that I need to get off my chest immediately.  I couldnt possibly go forward with this entry without clearing my mind of these thoughts first.  1) Sometimes life is funny.  Sometimes it is absurd.  Sometimes Monica Lewinsky ends up as the host of a television show called  Mr. Personality .  Truth is, I hate every being of HER personality so much that I wish she was the one wearing a mask.  I wish I didnt even have to blog about her.  She doesnt deserve the space I have to offer.  But after her ranting and raving on last nights episode, I thought that it was only fair that I write a short paragraph about why she deserves to never EVER be on television again.  First off, she sucks.  Literally.  Bitch is internationally known for having presidential jizz on both her mouth and her clothing.  Whatever opinion anyone has on this subject, the truth remainsshe is a worldwide jizz eater.  Second, you have entertainment talent??  I mean WHAAA??  Most hosts of reality television have no talent as a rule, but MonicaMonica seriously shouldnt even be allowed to get a headshot.  Why WOULD SHE?  Shes a jizz eater.  Not an entertainer.  Thirdly, as I sit and watch Monica Doublechinsky talk to the other members of the show, I am appalled at her lack of interesting things to say, but mostly at her lack of class when addressing the suitors.  When one of the contestants quit due to the pressure of the game (FUCKING LAME!!), Monica FREAKS out and gives the whole group the most annoying and condescending lecture on being a man.  We have rules, people, and you must follow them.  If you dont want to be a part of this process anymore, be a MAN and wait until the selection has made.   And lastly (fourthly), she takes herself so fucking seriously that I cant possibly hold down my anger laden vomit.  When she does anything, but stand there statuesque, I find myself scraping my fingers down the side of my face.  MY GOD I HATE THIS WOMAN.  Mostly becauseGET THE FUCK OFF THE TELEVISION!  You arent an actress!  You are someone who was made famous because of nonsense.  Now wipe your mouth and go back to your cave.    2) I happened to catch the E(!) True Hollywood Story of my one and only love, Nell Carter, this weekend.  Not much of the special shook me up, but then during the last two minutes of the show, they throw in a HUGE secret.  Nell Carter is a lesbian?  Lesbiawhaaaaaa???  WHO KNEW!  Surely not me.  And I AM a lesbian.  I dont get it.  Why are some people tortured for their sexuality and some people are just left alone?  Nell had a very difficult life and I am not saying that she should have been tortured.  But how did it slip by me that she was lesbionic.  I still sit here shocked and am a little upset that she didnt tell me about it when she was still alive.  Nellieoh Nellie.  Had I only known who you truly were when you were still alive.  Sadness fills my heart.  OkI feel much better now.  Is it wrong to say that I wish Nell Carter was alive right now instead of Monica Lewinsky?   Yes Joe.  Yes, that is wrong to say.  Last night Paul and I did something that we havent done in months!  We hooked up!   UM!  I KNOW!  See, this is how it all went down  Paul and I begin watching  The Simpsons  at 6:30pm.  We are getting along wonderfully; laughing, hugging, playing who can stand the longest pinch.  I called my Pot Guy because Paul was in the mood to smoke a fatty joint with me.  I wasnt much in the mood for getting the pot, but was trying to be as amiable as possible.  As we were joking around, I happened to notice that he was sporting a pretty hefty boner.  I thought Nows my chance.  I can use this opportunity to get us over the weirdness of starting back in with our long lost physical relationship.  I gently began playing with his dick, wondering if he was going to pull away from me, as he does every time I begin to turn the moment sensual.  It indeed was the right moment.    Here is what happened next:  Joe:  (fingering the shaft of his cock) Can I kiss you? Paul:  I dont know if we should do this. Joe:  Can I kiss you? Paul:  Ok. Joe:  (Begins to kiss Paul lightly on the lips, all the while playing with his cock and balls) Paul:  (Kisses back, but body language indicates that he is nervous and uncomfortable)  Eventually, the moment escalated to my kissing him down his chest, onto his stomach, and then to his boxer briefs.  I begin nibbling on the outside of the cloth and he relaxed.  He gave in to me.  I stripped off his boxers and began giving him the most amazing blow job that I could give.  He started breathing heavier and faster and I began going to town.  I wasnt at all worried about pleasing me.  My hope was to get our relationship back on track.  Having not been intimate with him over the last two-three months has certainly placed us in a very awkward position in our relationship.  As I am about to get him off, the phone rings.  The Pot Guy.    I groan and pick up the phone and tell him where to meet up with me.  Paul immediately stands up and says:  Well that was that.  And when you get back, I wont be horny anymore.  So were done for today.  My jaw hit the floor.  I stood there, not knowing whether to cry, or to punch him in the face.  I slowly put on my shoes, grabbed the money, and head out the door.  During the entire walk to and from meeting up with Pot Guy, I kept running his comments over and over in my head.    Well that was that.  And when you get back, I wont be horny anymore.  So were done for today. Well that was that.  And when you get back, I wont be horny anymore.  So were done for today. Well that was that.  And when you get back, I wont be horny anymore.  So were done for today. Well that was that.  And when you get back, I wont be horny anymore.  So were done for today. Well that was that.  And when you get back, I wont be horny anymore.  So were done for today. Well that was that.  And when you get back, I wont be horny anymore.  So were done for today. Well that was that.  And when you get back, I wont be horny anymore.  So were done for today. Well that was that.  And when you get back, I wont be horny anymore.  So were done for today. Well that was that.  And when you get back, I wont be horny anymore.  So were done for today. Well that was that.  And when you get back, I wont be horny anymore.  So were done for today. Well that was that.  And when you get back, I wont be horny anymore.  So were done for today.  By the time I got back to the apartment, I was fuming angry.  I walk in and sit down on his bed, next to him.  I sit quietly staring at the television.  Paul:  Whats wrong? Joe:  Nothings wrong. Paul:  Please tell me whats wrong. Joe:  Paul, what do you THINK is bothering me? Paul:  Ok.  I shouldnt have said what I did before you left the apartment.  It was wrong of me. Joe:  Yes it was wrong of you.  I feel so embarrassed and betrayed by you.  You are making no effort to improve this aspect of our relationship.  At this point, we say we are in love, but if we dont start making love soon, we are done.  I am not going to spend my time trying to make my boyfriend want me when he has no interest in it. Paul:  I do want you.  I just dont know how to get back to the place that we were at before everything went wrong. Joe:  Everything didnt go wrong.  You just gave up.  I am 25 years old Paul and I get hit on DAILY by people. Do you think that I have no libido at all and just dont care about being intimate with people?  Cuz if thats what you think, then you are sorely mistaken.  PaulI am going to cheat on you.  I am.  We fix this or you come to grips with the fact that the next time an attractive male hits on me, which will be SOON, I am going to take him up on the offer, and I am not going to feel bad about it.  I have tried with you over and over to help in whatever way I can.  But its not working and all you do in reciprocation is shut me down and make me feel bad.  I am done.  Paul sits on the bed staring at me for awhile and eventually puts his hand on my leg.  Paul:  I want to work on this with you.  I need to take this slow.  I dont want you to be with anyone else, but I dont know if I can give you what you want right now. Joe:  As long as you understand the point I am trying to make.  I laid next to him on the bed and we began to kiss and touch again.  Our cocks sprang to attention and we cautiously played with each others members.  (members = lame term for COCKS)  As we began to hook up again, I felt him start to pull back.    Joe:  You said you wanted to take this slow, so lets just each masturbate.  We can do it together and we can make it casual and easy. Paul:  Ok.  I would like to do that. Joe:  Can we kiss while we do it? Paul:  Yes.  And that we did.  We came together for the first time in months last night.  He was very happy with the way things turned out and I pretended that I was to.  When I was in the bathroom cleaning up, tears pricked at my eyes.  I wasnt as happy with the outcome as he was.  Its a first step and it will hopefully get better from here.  But if it doesnt  If it doesnt, than Paul and I are going to have to have another talk about his willingness to participate in our relationship.    All in all, it was a step in the right direction.    Too bad Monica Lewinsky had to go and ruin everything when she showed her fat head on my television.

       The Return of Joe CuttheShit!   I am lucky.    I am lucky to have such a wonderful family. I am lucky to have friends that want nothing else than for me to be with them and be happy. I am lucky to have a boyfriend that loves me more than he loves anyone else. I am lucky to have a brother that makes me proud daily by doing the things I could never dream of doing.   I am lucky to be alive.  I have had a lot of time to think over the past two weeks.  I spent numerous days in bed, staring at the wall.  I spent hours on the phone with my parents assuring them that I am not going to kill myself.  I saw Kellys show and I said goodbye to my brother.  There were things that threatened to consume me, but I found a way to barrel through the way I felt.  I sit here today, somewhat proud of how well I did and somewhat ashamed that I couldnt do better.   In either case, I am going to write off the last two weeks as a time in my life that I would rather forget.  I am hoping to move on and to grow stronger within myself.  I am hoping to take care of my depression now, so that I am not stuck in the midst of a crash again.  I cringe at the thought of re-visiting last week.  The support I received from this website was overwhelming, to say the least.  The fact that there are people in the world that would take time to send emails of encouragement, having never met me before, fills me with a restored faith in humanity.  I want to thank everyone for taking the time out of their busy lives to make sure that I was doing alright.  The few moments of happiness that I had over the last week was in direct relation to the support I received through my site.  Thank you.  Now, onwards and upwards!    Over the last two weeks, Paul has become a boyfriend sent directly from Heaven.  He has done all that is in his power to make me smile.  I am more in love with Paul now than I ever have been and I feel blessed to have someone like him in my life.  Last night, knowing that I said goodbye to my brother yesterday afternoon, Paul showed up at my apartment with a bouquet of flowers and some take out dinner.  He was the one person that I wanted to see.  His smile is so beautiful and when he walked through my door, it took all I had not to jump all over him.  As we slept last night, I would wake up to find his arms holding me extra tight.  If I moved to the end of the bed, Paul would move too and would rest his hand on my head.  I woke up quite a few times to him running his fingers through my hair, or scratching my back with his hand.  The tenderness in his touch was exactly what I needed.  Im not so sure I needed the eight pounds of mashed potatoes that I shoved into my face before going to bed, but still  The high in NYC today is 83.  The sun is shining with full force and there is a light breeze in the air.  For lunch I am going to sit in the park and read the newspaper.  I am going to look at the river and allow myself to relax.  I will take deep breaths of fresh air and then I will shove a cigarette between my lips to counterbalance the oxygen that I dont deserve.  I had originally planned on buying some fruit for lunch (yes, I knowAtkins doesnt approve of fruit, but hes dead now so I can have it) but now as my stomach churns and burns with massive hunger pangs, I think Shit, roast beast sounds mighty good!  Like I would ever eat roast beast.  Well, unless it was covered in cheese.  One time  One time I was at the Warp Tour.  Dont ask me what the Warp Tour is if you have never heard of it.  I think its like Ska bands or something.  At the time of the concert, I was trying to be cool so I pretended like I was really into Ska.  Now I dont care and am pretty much proud of the fact that Celine Deons I Drive All Night is my new favorite song.  In any case, while I was at the Warp Tour, I decided to grab a bite to eat.  Kelly was there with me, as well as our friend, Slam.  Yes.  I know.  But Slam is her real name.    So we go up to this food court type place and we look over the menu.  Its raining outside and everyone is kind of grumpy.  There must be 15 people in line and no one is happy to be soaking wet.  Suddenly we hear SNOOPY WANTS FRIES!   The loud voice made us jump out of our skins.  We pressed forward in line with hopes of getting ourselves some fries too.  Then againloud and above all the other noise, we hear SNOOPY WANTS FRIES!.WITH CHEESE ON IT!  Now we burst out laughing, cuz cheese on it and we turn around and catch sight of the guy who is screaming things about Snoopy.  Lo and behold, this crazy man, has a puppet of Snoopy on his hand and he is acting as though Snoops was really alive.  SNOOPY WANTS FRIES!  WITH CHEEEEEEEEEEESE ON IT!.  As he moved closer to the counter, he would twist his wrist so that Snoopy would get more excited about the impending cheese fries.  Snoopy had conversations with girls in the line and Snoopy was even holding a 5-dollar bill in his mouth.  Probably hoping to pay for the food with his own money.  All I remember after that is that Kelly, Slam and I laughed for years.  Snoopy wants fries.  With cheese on it.  Gosh, sometimes you just want to pinch your tits and make sure you are not sleepinglife is too funny.    I have a bruise on my left arm the size of a half dollar bill.  Numerous people have asked me what it is from and I honestly dont know.  It just kind of appeared.  What I didnt tell anybody is that last night I laid in bed for 10 minutes convincing myself that it was a lesion.  My heart started to pound in my chest and instead of worrying about my health, I thought What am I possibly going to tell my parents!  I guess thats a normal reaction, but I think that at some point, I gotta stop worrying so much about mom and dad.  They have their own lives afterall and all they want is for me to have the same.  Interesting dilemma.   Dilemma = Kelly Rowlands and Nelly.   Boo.  AUDI. Peace.

      Depression.  Webster's Dictionary defines depression as:  A psychiatric disorder characterized by an inability to concentrate, insomnia, loss of appetite, anhedonia, feelings of extreme sadness, guilt, helplessness and hopelessness, and thoughts of death. Also called clinical depression.    I define it as (and I wrote this  before  looking up the literal definition.  Scary right?):  Having zero control over personal happiness.  Can't fulfill daily responsibilities or personal activities due to the extreme feeling of sadness.  There tends to be no specific cause for this type of emotion.  See also  helplessness  and   hopelessness .    I have struggled with "depression" since I was a senior in highschool.    I remember going through pathetic bouts of anorexia, bullimia and the lame old "burning myself with cigarettes" before I realized that putting the pain onto my body wasn't in any way taking away the feeling I was struggling with inside.  I went to counselors, psychiatrists, through 6 months of St. John's Wart, and through 9 months of Prozac.  Then I thought the problem could be my latent homosexuality, so I came out of the closet.  But then I thought that being an "Education Major" in college was it, so I changed my major to "Theater".    After switching my major, I took myself off the medicine cuz I found that it was only making me crazier on the inside.  Rather than try a new form of anti-depressant, I chose to control my own life free of psychiatric drugs.  For two years it worked beautifully.  I remember being on the phone with my mom during one weekday afternoon and she asked "How do you feel today?".  I responded "Better than I have ever felt in my life.  Finding my passion in theater has changed my world for the positive."  I was legitimately happy.    Once out of college, I moved to Boston in order to work on my first "true love" relationship with Paul.  Over that year I had ups and downs, but was for the most part, still happy.  As time went on, as I moved to NYC in search of my dream, I lost every bit of confidence and control that I worked so hard to build.  I used to look in the mirror and love what I saw.  I used to go through my day awake and alert having slept only 5 hours the night before.  I was busy and I was happy.  NYC presented challenges to me that I was not ready to face.    I was the big fish in a little pond at college. I owned the theater department.  In the matter of a year and a half I got the grades, the roles, the responsibility, and the respect that I have always wanted.  Everyone wanted to be my friend and everyone looked up to me in a way that now seems impossible.  Every professor at school told me "Enjoy this now because NYC will be a much bigger pond".  I would laugh it off and say "Yeah I know".    But only now do I really know.  I went from a place where I was the king to a place where I have 5 friends.  Literally 5(!) friends.  I have spent two years in this gigantic city and have nothing social to show for it.  I don't go to great parties.  I don't have celebrity encounters.  I don't EVER get to wear a tie.  My life is filled with random nights of drinking, movie watching, staring at the wall.  I am afraid to step out of my house.  Because my financial situation is so tight, I haven't had a new piece of clothing since Christmas.  I used to have great clothes.  I use to feel wonderful and powerful.  And now I have been reduced to this paranoid, insecure, child that can't seem to get dressed in the morning and do something as simple as go to work.    I am sad.  So sad.  I have tried over and over throughout the last couple of years to blame my sadness on other things.  Most recent being my brother's upcoming depolyment to Iraq.  But in the past it was the long distance with my boyfriend.  It was the apartment in Queens.  It was anything I could put blame on so that my sadness was justified.  It is impossible for me to look at myself and be proud of where I am.  As has been told to me over and over, I have a "great apartment, financial stability, a successful relationship, wonderful friends, a family that adores and loves me".  But I look at all of this and think so what? It seems so easy.  Like something anybody could do.  I haven't WORKED to have all of this.  It's just what happened while I was sitting around feeling sorry for myself.    Most people don't truly understand what depression is like.    From what I can tell, the general public falls into these categories:  1)   Everyone gets depressed   This is the most common of responses.  These people truly believe that people with depression are lazy and in need of attention.  In their minds, depression happens to everyone and you just gotta dust yourself off and move on.  When I discuss depression with these type of people, I am mostly left with a feeling of confusion.  These people tend to be closed minded and also believe that homosexuality, as with depression, is a state of mind.  Case in point.  Their team slogan would be:  "STOP MAKING EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU!"  2)   I get depressed too   I feel bad for these people.  They don't mean it.  They just need someone to talk to.  And as someone who struggles with a deep form of depression, I have a hard time being the support system for these type of people.  Of course I'll do it as I have a soft spot for anyone in emotional trouble.  But I can't be THE support system.  The one that makes it all better.  I hide from that.  I am scared by that need in other people.  In my opinion, these people go through depression for a specific reason.  IE: miscarriage, death in the family, losing an eye in an accident involving jism.  (i had to throw a joke in this entry somewhere!)  These people get a taste of what depression is, but usually end up okay.  They are lucky enough to see the horrors of it, but strong enough to break free of it.  They will never return to this state of mind, because it scares them too deeply.  3)   I am bi-polar, manic, suicidal, crazy depressed   These people make me look the other way the minute I cross their paths.  Truth be told, these are the most interesting and wonderful people on the planet.  Experiencing their highs with them is like being on planet fun.  They are constantly making jokes, ready to do wild and spontaneious things, and more than ready to make you have a good time.  But as with the law of gravity, what goes up, must come down.  Their lows are terrifying.  These are the people that really do burn and cut themselves.  A person with these type of disorders will call you to tell you that they are taking a bottle of pills to end their life and by the time you get to them, they have actually done it.  They want to be helped, but they can't figure out how to ask.  How to make anyone truly understand.  I used to be incredibly good friends with someone who was manic.  For a long time, she was the only support to my depression that I could accept.  She understood me.  She knew what to do to make us feel better.  She was my mentor.  But when I got better and she didn't, she grasped on to me with desperation.  I realized that to be better I needed to be away from her and she realized that she needed me to feel the same way that she did.  I turned my back and left her.  And I will never forgive myself for that.  But like I said, these people are intense and if you aren't completely balanced, it's almost impossible to have a successful relationship with them.    4)   I love you so much and would do anything to make this better for you   These people tend to be best friends, family, boyfriend-girlfriends.  The amount of love and frustration that comes out of these people is mindblowing.  My parents want nothing more than for me to be happy.  When I had my first depression crash in college, they drove up to get me and brought me home to make me better.  They paid for doctor's, counselors, medicines, you name it.  They follow my rules and do whatever they can to not shake me up, but still find a way to let me know that they are always there.  My friends are this way with me too.  Always available and always willing to extend a hand of support.  The only problem with these type of people is that they are the last people you want to go to in the midst of a depression crisis.  They know you and will make you tell them exactly how you feel.  When I am having a day where I am teetering on the edge of sanity or madness, I hide from these people cuz they will push me into the madness unknowingly.  "How are you feeling today?"  "You don't seem like youself."  "Do you want to talk about anything?"  While I am so grateful to have them actually asking, I rarely take them up on the offer.  I feel guilty telling these people that I am "just going to bed".  I feel terrible saying "Sorry I didn't call, I was having a 'down day'".  These people love me so much that I feel hurt by not allowing them to make this all better.  I don't know how to let them in.    5)   I love you, but can't accept the fact that you are depressed   For me, this person is Paul.  Paul has such influence on me that he believes that he can single handedly put me back together.  He has expectations of me that I must fulfill and if I don't he is unaccepting of the depression excuse.  He is a combination of numbers 2 and 4.  He gets sad too and will force himself to get out of it.  If I am sad, he assumes that I will just do the same thing.  For me, he is the one person I want to be around when I am depressed.  I can scream at him, cry in front of him, and be silent in front of him.   He doesn't cut me any slack and for right now, I like that.  He gets me out of the house and he puts my mind on other things.  When people are in AA, they need a partner to help them get through it.  I feel that it's the same method that people with depression should use.  My partner is Paul.  Most times he doesn't truly understand how I feel, but regardless, he will get me through my day.  Unfortunately, when things go wrong, I blame Paul.  I trust in him and I rely on him, so when things crash down in my life, I expect Paul to make it better.  He is the one forcing me to live my life afterall.  Paul needs to become a little more of number 4 and I think that I could begin taking some major steps.  These type of people are the ones that people with depression need around.  They are the ones to get you back into your routine.  This is the world around me.    Over the last couple of days, I have dissected what I really need to do to become better.     A)  (we use letters now)  I need to start acting.  An audition here or there.  It will help me to feel like I have a purpose.  I can't put all of my hopes on acting, but I have to at least begin to do what I came to this city to do.  My mom said today that if I don't go to this pending audition that I have on Saturday, she will ground me.  "Joe, if anything else, do this for your mother".  And she's right. I will do it for her.  Cuz I can't seem to do it for myself.  B)  I need a counselor.  Since leaving college I have had two sessions with a psychiatrist.  I am the first person to tell you that you need one, but am the last person to take the advice myself.  I can't afford the counselor that I want and haven't had the drive to find someone for cheap.  It's as though I need someone to do it for me.  I will go...I just don't want to find the person myself.  Talking to someone, whether it be once a week, or once a month, will give me hope that I am getting better.  That I am doing what I need to be doing for the disease that I have.  It will be accepting the fact that I am depressed and that I can't do it by myself.    C)  I need to go to the doctor's.  I need a check up.  I need to know that everything is ok with my body and that I don't have lung cancer or something.  Everyone has these thoughts, but not everyone stays in bed all day obsessing about each cigarette because they are SURE that they have already crossed the point of getting the cancer.  I need to know that I am ok.  While there, I need to discuss the option of going back on an anti-depressent.  I have been doing my research and I think that "Welbutrin" will be the way to go.  It has a supplement in it that aids with quitting smoking.  If I go on Welbutrin AND I quit smoking, I am taking steps towards truly healing myself.  It seems like an impossibility, but I know that if I make the effort, I can achieve it.  So that's it.    I wrote all of this, cuz I needed to get it all out.  I needed to write it and see it and read it as though it were all real and not just something that I am making up in my head.  My dad just called to check up on me and it was a really good talk.  People do love me and are only frustrated with me because they want to do for me what I can't seem to do for myself.  If you are someone that is hurt by me because I haven't "showed up" or I haven't made any effort to see you when I said I would, understand that it's not you.  It's me and I haven't figured out how to be myself yet.  I always feel like I am letting people down because they just don't understand that I have no control.    Sadness is something that happens to everyone and I don't ever expect not to be sad.  But I can't expect other people to make this better for me.  I can't expect other people to take my sadness away.  The answer doesn't lie anywhere, but in my heart.    I have two choices.  I can either let this thing control me or I can make every effort possible to control it.  The last thing I want is to let it beat me.  I am a strong person.  I am a capable person.  I want to be someone that everyone else aspires to be.  I used to be that be that person.  And if I try hard enough, I can make it happen again.

      TGIW! Sike.  First and foremost, I have to get something off my chest.    Last night, I slept like a fucking rock.  I didnt wake up once during the night and I had the deepest and most powerful sleep.  Sometime before I woke up, I had the most upsetting dream.  It started out completely normal, but then ended in such a way that even though it has been a good 3 hours since I woke up, I still have the feelings of anxiety and sadness coursing through my veins.    Heres my dream:  I am hanging out with some friends at a house in upstate New York.  We are all sitting around in a living room area playing cards and listening to music.  Some of the people are drinking beer, but I am feeling tired and not in the mood to drink.  Eventually, the craziness of the drunken people starts to get to me, so I decide that I am going to take a quick nap.  At this point, it must be around 2pm.  The sun is shining through the windows and the room is very brightly lit, despite the cloud of smoke that is hovering in the air from all of the cigarette smokers.  I pick up my soda from the room and put my own cigarettes into my pocket.  I tell everyone that I will be back and I head up the stairs to a bedroom at the far end of the house.    I enter through the door and immediately smell fresh linen.    I set my soda and cigarettes on the bedside table and I take off my shoes.  I feel good.  I feel happy to be taking a nap.  I feel exhausted and immediately lay down on the bed.  As I lay there, I have a hard time falling to sleep.  I try to get as deep into the covers as possible, but no matter how much I toss and turn, I cant fall asleep.  I decide to sit up and smoke a cigarette in order to relax myself.  I lean over and turn on the television and light up my butt.  When the TV turns on, one of the news stations is broadcasting a shuttle landing in St. Louis.  There is a picture of the Arches and a crowd of at least a couple thousand people standing behind them watching the spectacle.  There are cameramen, signs with words of support, and families screaming and cheering at the excitement of watching the shuttle return from space.    The camera zooms in on a figure in the distance and although I cant make out the exact shape of the shuttle, I can feel the energy in the crowd start to pick up.  After a couple minutes, the camera pans back to its position behind the crowd of people.  It was quite a beautiful scene.  There were people eating ice cream and hot dogs.  I remember seeing balloons and happy faces and feeling the excitement from the crowd as the cheering grew louder.  The camera switches angles again and now we can see the shuttle moving closer to the landing spot.  We, the people at the site and me through the television, watch the shuttle moving faster and faster, almost in clear view.  The cheering of the crowd escalates to a moment of surrealism and then the unthinkable happens.  The shuttle picks up even more speed and instead of moving towards the pre-determined landing site, it flies off course and smashes right down in front of the St. Louis Arches.  The crowd has no idea what has happened and immediately people start screaming, grabbing their children and running as fast as they can away from the crash.  The crowd is so thick with people that I can see families being knocked to the ground and trampled.  The cameraman, despite the chaos, moves in closer to the crowd and through the arches, I can see the burning shuttle.  There is a sudden explosion causing debris and flames to shoot out of the center of the shuttle.  Like in the climactic scene of a disaster movie, the top half of the arches split in half and tip over on to the remaining people in the crowd.  I see men and women alike raise their arms up in a futile attempt to stop the concrete from crushing their bodies.  The concrete hits the ground with a SLAM and everyone that was previously standing under the structure has been buried.    The camera, through which I am watching all of this devastation occur, shakes uncontrollably and when re-focused I see that we are now panning over the rubble.  Screams still fill the air and now I can hear sirens and see a fire hose open up over the burning wreckage.  The cameraman moves closer to the destroyed arches.  There are people all around him trying to save their loved ones or to put out the flames that are spreading all over the area.  In the midst of all of this chaos, someone shouts into the camera MOVE!  ITS GOING TO FALL!  The camera jerks violently towards the sky.  A huge piece of the Arch breaks off the top of the remaining structure and hurtles towards the lens of the camera.  I watch as the lens and TV screen is filled with a picture of falling concrete.  There is a loud crash and the picture cuts out.    I sit shaking in bed.  I feel as though my guts have been torn out.  I stand up quickly and run out of the room.  I run as fast as I can to get back to the people that I left at the party.  When I enter the room, I realize that there is no noise, no music, and none of my friends.  I see a piece of paper tacked to the door.  On it the words read:  Went to see the shuttle land at the Arches.  Help yourself to a beer.  Be back later.  In the pit of my stomach, I know that all of my friends have been killed in the tragedy.  The fear and grief that I feel begins to overwhelm me.  The room starts to get very dark, as though somebody was playing with a dimmer switch that is connected to my vision.  I fall to my knees and wake up in my bed with a jolt.    I woke up covered in sweat.  I immediately sat up and realized that I was shaking uncontrollably.  I reach over to light my morning cigarette.  I sat in bed for 15 minutes running the dream over and over in my head.  The emotion I was feeling was very intense and I did my best to shake it off.  I got into the shower and got dressed, the whole time trying to convince myself that it was just a bad dream.  This tragedy never happened and nobody died.  But how scary that life can change over the course of a couple minutes.    I dont think I started believing that it wasnt real until I got to work.    Even as I write this, I still feel a bit shaky.  Dreams that are that realistic stay with me for a long time.  I can remember it all as though it truly happened.  And its scary.  SO thats that.  Kind of a rough morning.  In other news, Rita gets into town tomorrow morning.  I get out of work today at 1pm and will not be returning until Monday at 9am.  Tonight is Paul and my Date Night and since I have not seen him since last Saturday, it is sure to be a great time.  I cant wait to crawl into bed with him.  I miss him incredibly and need to spend some serious alone time with him before the weekend extravaganza begins.    YAY RITA!  YAY WEEKEND!  YAY YAY!  Happy Passover all!  Chag Sameach or some shit.

      It is SO rare for me to have a hot guy in my office and right now that very thing is happening.  I walked in from lunch to find the most beautiful man sitting in the couch in front of my desk.  Its weird, I mostly go for big muscle studs, but once in a while a bigger-ish kind of guy can walk in and just sort of sweep me off my feet with their pulsing masculinity.  He is wearing a black t-shirt and blue navy shorts and he is a bit hairy.  He is also wearing a dark blue baseball cap (which always gets my jizz flowing).  I just found out that his name is Mark.  LOVE that name.  Okay, he just made eye contact with me and I swear that my entire body just melted onto the floor.  Man, he is so fine.  I can tell that through the T-shirt that he has a beautiful body and the way he carries it is making me die with lust.    I do have a boyfriend, right?    Mark is now walking out and of course my eyes followed him right up until he left the office.    Sometimes I have game.  Most times I have game.  But when I really want a guy, when I am really turned on by a guy, I lose every skill I was given.  Rita used to make fun of me about this cuz she has seen me lose my shit over boys before.  Its rare, but when it happens, I become this child-like creature that is helpless and in dire need of approval.    I love you Mark.  I know we have only known each other for 5 minutes, but let me tell you, it was the best five minutes of my day so far.  **BIG SIGH**

      Well the Atkins Diet thing worked really well!  You should see how much weight I have lost in the last 24 hours.  Im like a brand new man.  Considering this, I am done with it.  I thought I could keep it going strong until at least Thursday, but nah.  Im bored by it already.  I am still going to change my eating habits so that I am consuming a lot LESS carbs and I am still going grocery shopping tonight to get some healthy shit up in my pad.  But Dr. Atkins is a bitch and I am not really in the mood for him anymore.  So well see  I have decided that I absolutely adore the TV show  Scrubs .  At first I thought it was silly.  (Like I ever use the word silly.  As a gay man, Im just not allowed.)  But over the last two weeks, I have started to believe in it as a brilliant and smart comedy.  It makes me howl with laughter.  Last week, they did the most unbelievable thing.  There was a scene where all of the doctors were sitting around at a lecture and the lead doctor guy interrupts the person speaking by saying SNORE.  Paul happened to be watching the show with me that night and we both burst out laughing and freaked!  He used MY LINE on a TV show.  Isnt it strange when you come up with a saying and then hear people use it on TV?  Cuz no WAY did the  Scrubs  writers actually create that phrase.  Clearly, I passed it on to Rita and Kelly, who in turn passed it on to people they know and so on and so forth.  Man!  I am so glad that my comedic genius is finally getting the attention it deserves.  In all reality, hearing my pride and joy phrase SNORE, on a major network, just led me to believe that I am even more generic than I originally thought.  Now I hate  Scrubs .  No one watch it.  So, RITA is coming to NYC!  It will be a very short visit, but at least I am going to be able to spend some real time with her.  I was afraid that we werent going to be able to work out the visit this week and that would have sucked big time.  Sometimes you just need a quick fix.  Like, for example, when you sniff glue.  Sniffing glue is, well, I guess, no, actually it has nothing to do with sniffing glue.  Never mind.  Yay Ritas coming!  Just a quickiecan someone please explain to me why last week in NYC we had a foot of snow and exactly one week later, it is a blazing inferno?  Is it because everyone missed the connect the dot zits that appear on my forehead when the subways become an oven?  Because soon enough, they will be in full bloom!  I love this weather, but hate the fact that I become this sweaty, slimy, scary beast that trudges through the subway as though I am looking for a meal made of flesh.    I dont know about you, but if you dont watch the Real World/Road World Battle of the Seasons, you are missing out!  The shit is gooood.  So much better than that lame ass Las Vegas garbage they had going.  I happened to catch that new show  Punkd  last night and saw that one of the people that they were playing the pranks on was Trishelle from the most recent  Real World .  I started SCREAMING at the television when I saw this nonsense.  Dont tell me that this lame bitch thinks that she is some sort of a STAR now.  Every single one of those Vegas Real Worlders better fade into the background and fast.  I curse their very existence.    CURSE!  Havent seen Paul since Saturday night and dont plan on seeing him again until our Date Night tomorrow.  Since I just got paid today, it is my turn to take us out to dinner.  He pays for the meal every single week and now I have to fork over a few bones to kind of make up for my I eat everything I want and for free attitude.  I am pretty sure that we are going to go out near my apartment in Midtown, but finding an affordable place to eat there is difficult.  And hells if I have any chance at finding a GAY restaurant, which he considers a necessity.  Honestly though Paul, grow up and learn to accept the fact that straight people are all around us.  Sometimes they even have good food too.  So we will, against his whining and complaining, be eating straight cuisine.  Im thinking a diner of some sort.  This bitch dont got enough money for us to eat in a restaurant that sells wine.  Only soda and milkshakes.    Time for lunch!  Oh God, what do I have to eat?    I heard pizza is good this time of year.  Maybe Ill go check it out and see what all the fuss is about.  I mean, pizza.  What a strange concept.  Ive never had it before.    Sounds yum, no?

      Oh YAY its MONDAY!  My most favoritest day of the fucking week god I hate you fucking Mondays.    Really shouldnt complain since this week I have off most of Wed. and all of Thursday and Friday.  But MAN if Monday still doesnt suck my twat.    Had a fine weekend.  Friday was spent fully drunk.  Got home from work at 2:30pm and drank until 2:30am.  It was seriously fun.  Hung out with Kelly and her theater friends for a bit and then we went over to Pauls pad and hung with him and Jen for awhile.  We went to a bar and I was confronted with the no-smoking ban for the first time since its conception.  Man, let me tell you, this law sucks my cock.  In the two hours we were there, I went outside to have two smokes, but NEEDED to have at least 5.  It made me furious not to be able to light up.  But I obeyed the laws of the man and tried to pretend as though I am not as addicted as I really am.  God this new law blows a dickhead!  Didnt do much else for the rest of the weekend.  Truly believed that I was starting up the Atkins diet today, so whether hungry or not, I went through my house and shoved every carbohydrate into my body.  I ate almost every bite of my groceries.  Tomorrow I FINALLY get paid at work, so I will immediately be going to the grocery store to buy tons of vegetables, meat, and eggs.  I have spent the last hour researching this diet plan online and have to admit that it looks MUCH harder than I originally planned.  You arent allowed to have any sugar, carbs, milk, or anything else that tastes great.  Thing is, when I want to, I can be overly committed to anything I set my mind to.  And I also think I should clarify something as well    I am not doing Atkins because I am obese.  I am not doing Atkins cuz I need to lose massive amounts of weight.  I dont seriously weigh enough for anyone to throw mud at me or poke my fat rolls in a cruelly obscene manner.    What I want to do is change my eating habits.  All I eat right now is cheeseburgers, pizza, and french fries, so its time that I start eating a lot more vegetables and a lot less carb. infested food.  Thats why I thought that Atkins would be perfect!  And so far it is.  (Cept I have yet to eat anything today so I really cant speak from experience just yet.)  I need protein and I need some organic, straight from the earth nutrition.  And thats that.  So, lets see what I can do with this new eating regimen.    As for Dr. Atkins telling me that I cant drink booze while on his diet plan, I say Go fuck yourself.  Drinking is a must in ANY diet plan that Joe Cut the Shit does, so dont worryI am not taking myself TOO seriously.  Still not sure if Rita is coming to NYC this weekend or if I am going to Syracuse to see her.  Will know by the end of today or tomorrow, I hope!    Had a good talk with my brother this morning, but I found that I had nothing to say.  I kept thinking that I SHOULD have something to say, considering that in two weeks he will be leaving for Iraq for at least 6 months, but stillfound myself blank.  I tried not to lead on that I was braindead while we were on the phone and I am pretty sure he bought it for the most part.  Mondays are hard for me to talk to anyone on the phone.  Especially in the morning.  My mind is always full of work-related things I need to do, and my co-workers seem to be excruciatingly annoying when I first walk in the office.  But by 12pm, or so, things begin to settle down and I can get back to my usual routine of Work hard for half an hour, Take a half an hour off.  Winfield did let me know that he ships out on April 26th.  A week from Saturday.  Wow.  He will be going to Lower Iraq, most likely in or around Basra.  But thats all we are allowed to know at this point.  I dont feel nearly as petrified as I did a couple of weeks ago. The war is starting to come to a close, you know?  Yet, I am still nervous and feel as though I will carry underlying anxiety about this whole thing until he returns safe and sound.  Naturally.  Every email and phone call from him, while he is gone, is going to be so important though.  NO matter how little I have to say on those days, I HAVE to come up with something to talk about.    MAN!  Why am I such a schizo weirdo?!?!  Cant I just think normally like most people??  Why do I have to sit here and worry about what I am goi-  Ok, so done with that topic.  Next  Did NOT see  House of 1000 Corpses  this weekend.  Kelly totally would have gone with me, cept I made the decision to stay in my bed ALL day yesterday and could not be bothered with leaving to go 3 blocks to the theater.  She came home with snacks and we curled up on my bed and watched  Signs  together.  I just got the DVD from my mom, cept it seems to be all scratched up and we ended up having to order it from Videos on Demand through Time Warner.  Whatever snores, the movie was great the 7th time I saw it and Kelly really liked it too.  Its a winner folks.  If you havent seen it yet, go see it today.  And if you didnt like it, what kind of alien are YOU!?!? This morning, though, I heard a review of  Corpses  on the radio and they said that it is absolute Carnage and nothing more than brutal murders.  And I say to that YAY!  Thats EXACTLY what I was going to see it for!  I love being a sick bastard.  So THIS weekend I must see it.  Must Must Must!  Or like the  Willard  scandal of March, it will be pulled from the theater within the first 3 weeks.  And that movie was good!  (shifty eyed emoticon)  I just sat staring at my computer for at least 5 minutes without blinking or thinking a single real thought.  No joke.   I think I could be a literal vegetable today.  Maybe its cuz of the pending Atkins diet.  Maybe you really are what you eat and my brain is turning into a mushy vegetable.  Gosh, thats interesting.  Was I a french fry up until this point??  Well, yeah.  Yeah I was.  I never KNEW there was so much truth behind that little colloquialism.    Alright, time for lunch.  I am very excited to eat a famous actor.  For OBVIOUS reasons!

      Today is the ugliest day on the planet.  Since I am one of the idiot boys that loses my umbrella every time it rains, I have given up buying a new one.  I brave every storm and run my ass to my destination.  But todaytoday I punched myself in the face for not having one.   My short walk to the subway left me drenched to the bone.  And this wasnt even the worst of it.    My shower at home is so trigger sensitive that it takes at least 5 minutes for the water to be safe for skin.  It either boils and scalds or it freezes and tortures.  Today it was a combination of all four as I played with it for 10 minutes before Paul and I could get into it.  We both were running late and trying to maneuver our bodies in my shower was totally fruitless.  Eventually we completed the annoying task of cleaning our bodies and were able to get ready for work.    When I realized that there was a torrential downpour, I definitely debated whether or not to even attempt commuting to work on the subway.  If I didnt have just $13 left in my checking account, I would have cabbed it.  But since that is where my funds are at until my next paycheck (this upcoming Tuesday), I just said fuck it and looked the storm in the face.  Fortunately, the gel in my hair was still drying when I walked to the subway, so I was VERY excited to see what all of this wetness was going to do to my hairstyle.  When I got to work, I stopped off in the bathroom to see the damage.  Just like I had hoped, the entire back of my head is sticking straight up to the ceiling and the front half is plastered to my forehead.  If you stop for a second and imagine this image, you will realize that I am one of the doofiest looking people that was ever born.  Rain, rain, go away, find someone else to fuck today.    Despite this morning from HELL, I am in a slamming good mood.  Had a brief, but GREAT talk with my Rita and was VERY excited to find out that she just nabbed herself a wonderful new job.  AND they are paying for her to go to GRAD. SCHOOL!  YAY!  Sounds like things are REALLY on the up and up for her.  I mean, damn.  You do not know the happiness I feel in my heart when things go right for Rita Lovely.  To top off all of this good news, she informed me that she is going to try to come to visit next week!  When she mentioned the idea, I immediately shot my load into my pants and had to get off the phone.  I ran to the bathroom to find that there was no toilet paper in any of the stalls, so I had to wipe the jizz right on the bathroom wall.  I ran away in shame.  So yay!  Rita is coming, Rita is coming!  And if she doesnt, I am going to visit her.  End of story.  Not another week without seeing her.  Its like my birthday and Christmas all wrapped up into one!  (sound familiar Reets?)  This weekend I plan to spend the entire time wasted.  You see, I havent gotten drunk in like the longest time.  Back before I moved to Times Square, I was drinking like 4 or 5 nights a week.  But since the move, I have avoided it all together.  But this weekendthis weekend I am doing it up!  Leaving work today to meet up with Paul for happy hour.  It will be an early night as he as to work a double tomorrow.  Saturday evening I am going out with some lesbians and thats only fun, cuz I have nothing better to do.  Kelly may join us later and that will pick up my mood, Im sure.  Other than that, it will be a weekend of rest, food, and reading my book.  FUN!    On Monday I am starting Atkins.  I know, I know, everyone has an opinion about it.  And franklyshhhhhh.  I dont want to hear it.  My goal is to give my body a jump-start.  I dont do any diet for too long, but if this Atkins is going to get me losing a couple pounds around my gut, then great!  Once I see my body start to change a bit, I will get motivated to really get my ass into some serious shape.  I dont have that much work to do.  Its not like I am starting out at 300#.  At this point, I am 59 and 175#.  Not bad.  Actually, to look at me, you wouldnt ever think of fat or overweight as an adjective to describe me.  Its just that I want to have one of those bodies that stop people in their tracks.  If I ever decide to get off my ass and be an actor, I want to be able to pull my shirt off and have the world begging to sleep with me.  You understand.  We all understand.  So Monday, I start Atkins.  (Hush Jeannie, I can feel you struggling to hold back the advice!)    Paul and I had another great night last night.  Made dinner, laughed and laughed, all around super evening.  We went to bed EARLY.  I was passed out by 11:30pm and same for him.  We slept for 9 hours last night!  We even woke up a bit earlier than usual today and talked in bed.  We NEVER do that.  I always have to leave before he does and this morning we got to laugh and play for at least 15 minutes before I had to get out of bed.  Sickwe are becoming so lovey dovey and I know that for anyone reading this, that is irritating as fuck.  But, truth be told, still havent had his dick in my mouth for over 3 months.  Although we are having the time of our lives together, we still dont do anything remotely erotic.  Snores.  I dont care.  Or at least, I dont want to care about it right now.    In too good of a mood  Thank God this week is over.  My job has driven me up a fucking wall this week.  Probably because I knew going into Monday that this would be the last full week of work I would have until May.  With Passover coming, we get off 2 and half days each week until April 28th.  Pretty fucking great to work for the Jewish, but not be one yourself.  Lots of time off.  :-D  My one goal this weekend is to see  House of 1000 Corpses .  If Paul doesnt go with me, I am totally dragging Kelly to it.  We usually go to movies on Sundays in honor of our newly created Super Scary Sinema Sunday.  We missed last week due to us both having other plans.    Okay, I so have to go right now.  I will try to come by here this weekend.  I always say that and then end up with my dick in my hands all the weekend.  But this entry was so rushed and ridiculous that I think I owe it to myself to write something more readable and interesting.   aRdios!

      Last night with Paul was great.  We have totally fallen into this new routine.  I go over to his place right after work and we sit and talk about our days for a few minutes.  Usually at this point, he is in bed, naked, trying to coerce me into taking a brief nap with him before we go out for the evening.  I always say no to the nap, knowing that I will never get back out of the bed.  After we wrestle around for a couple minutes, I make him give me at least 3 baby kisses on the mouth (still havent worked up to tongue kisses since the whole Paul wont touch Joe scandal of 2003).  After this, he gets dressed and we smoke a bowl while picking out a few different places for dinner.  I always let him pick a couple different restaurants and then I make the final decision.  Of course, he always wants to go gay friendly and that bores me, but as of late, I have tried to compromise and have stopped bitching about it.    About this time,  The Simpsons  comes on and we watch it for its full syndicated hour.  This show is one of the few obsessions that Paul and I have in common.  Rarely a night goes by when we miss the show.  One of last nights episodes was about Income taxes and we both agreed that they should have shown this episode on April 15th.  Not the 9th.   Well, at the time it seemed like an interesting discussion.  By 7:30pm, the two episodes are over and we have decided where we will go to dinner.  Last night, it was Brunettas in the East Village.  We finished getting ready and were off.  Paul likes to walk around aimlessly in the village and I have a HUGE pet peeve about walking anywhere without a prior destination already planned out.  If I were a Playboy playmate (which I very well might be some day) I would list one of my turn-offs as Long walks with no purpose.    Last night Paul promised that we could go directly to the restaurant without having to walk around for 45 minutes.  Instead, he made us stop and look at every plant that was growing on the sidewalk.  You see, Paul is obsessed with biology.  His major at Boston University was Bio and he lives his life in front of his plants.  As of right now, he must have 18 plants in his living room.  I tell him that he is not allowed to buy anymore, cuz I feel as though they are looking at me while I sleep.  Theres just too many of them for my tastes.  Too much of anything gets a little scary.  So, after taking inventory of every new weed that has grown in the last day, Paul and I arrived at Brunettas.  The place was EMPTY and looked vaguely like a cafeteria.  I turn to him and go Ill have the sloppy joes.  And make em EXTRA SLOPPY FOR ME!  He grinned and we took our seats at a table near the front.  Paul ordered a glass of Merlot and I stuck with my glass of water, instead of my usual diet coke.   For appetizers we ordered Caesar Salad, Hot Parmesan Pesto bread, and a fritter.  We sucked them down in 4 bites.  (Keep in mind that we were stoned and food goes down much tastier and can be shoved in like animals)  For dinner, I had the Chicken Brunetta and Paul had the Risotto, due to me telling him to try something new.  My chicken was covered in cheese and egg and despite the soggy vegetables and rotting potatoes, it was very good!  Pauls risotto was nasty shit.  He ate it, cuz he was starving, but he really was not a fan.  Our waitress was a boner and half way through the meal, two other co-workers of hers came in to eat and annoyed the piss out of me.  I mean, if you work in a restaurant and decide to go eat there, behave yourself.  Dont act like a jackass cuz you think its your right to show off that you work there and are drinking and eating at half price.  I scowled at them as we left.    The restaurant blew, so I told Paul that I would buy dessert.  I only had $6 on me so I offered to get us some candy or ice cream cones.  Paul said he wanted pastries.  I hate pastries, but agreed to get whatever he wanted.  I picked out a brownie and he picked out the carrot cake.  Not a slice, the ENTIRE carrot cake.  I didnt have enough money for that, obviously, so I gave Paul 5 of my $6 and we went home with a gigantic cake.  We were going to get the ENORMOUS Remember September 11th cake with the picture of the World Trade Centers on it, but thought that it might be stale.  For obvious reasons.  On the way home, Paul and I held hands for 2 full minutes!  More than we have ever done in public.  It was a nice moment that I wont forget for a long time.  We talked about whatever came into our minds and just enjoyed being with each other.    It was a wonderful evening, despite the cafeteria food.  For the rest of the night, we laid in bed naked and watched the news,  Friends , and some of  That 70s Show .  Since I have been, as of late, sticking my finger into Pauls belly button, he is now trying to do the same to me.  But that shit hurts!   Have you ever done it?  If not, stick your finger into your belly button and get to know the worst and most uncomfortable pain on the planet.  Plus, if you have never stuck your finger in there, odds are that it will smell when you remove it.  If this happens, wipe it under your boyfriends nose when they arent paying attention.    I have a tendency to do things to Paul that I would NEVER want done to myself.  First, I rub cold things on his naked body.  (piece of ice, cold hands, fudgesicles)  He screams and when he tries to do it back to me, I pinch him.  And hard.  Also, on Monday he said something sarcastic to me, so I stuck my finger into his mouth and down his throat.  He gagged and said: Why would you DO something like that??  He knew why when I proceeded to give him a wet willy with his own spit!  GENIUS, right?   Right.  So now, when I am trying to fall asleep, he tries his damndest to get his finger into my belly button.  Trying to avoid his hands is fruitless and eventually the whole scenario had me laughing so hard that I felt tears brimming.  I squirmed all over the bed until 1am trying to escape his fingers of death.   Yet the minute he started to fall asleep, I jammed my finger to the core of his belly.    Then I laughed as he called me irritating.  Then I felt bad cuz dont call me irritating.  So I poked him one last time in his button.  He was furious at first, but when he saw my face, he burst out laughing and we went to bed cuddling.  Me with my palm covering my belly button entrance.  I slept hard last night.  Most nights I wake up every couple of hours, but last night, I was like a rock.  (can ya smell what I was cookin?)  The last dream I had was VERY strange.    Rita and I were hanging out on a baseball diamond and the weather was beautiful.  Lots of sun.  We were just walking around and talking and she decides that she needs to use her cell phone.  She walks a couple feet away and I turn to face the river.  (right.  River?  I swear it appeared out of nowhere, just to give me something to do while Rita was on the phone)  After a couple of minutes, I turn back and notice that Rita is walking right towards a deep ravine.  I freeze in my tracks as I realize that even though she is holding up her cell phone to her ear, she is sleepwalking and it is up to me to steer her in the right direction.  Away from the ravine.    I start to panic as I run as fast as I can to her side.  I do reach her in time and I guide her away from danger.  As I am steering her away, she rests her head on my shoulder and I realize that she is snoring quite loudly.  When we are back on the baseball diamond, I turn to face her and she is snoring so loud that I start to laugh.  Stop snoring Rita, I say.  Her head lolls around on her shoulders and she continues to snore her brains away.  Rita!  Wake up!  STOP SNORING SO LOUD!, I yell in her face.  I yell so loud that I jerk myself awake.  Paul is lying with his head on my shoulder and he is snoring in such a way that I think he is going to break his nasal cavity.  I gently nudge him and he keeps rip-roaring away.  Eventually I had to get up and get into the shower and it wasnt until then that he quieted down.   I wonder where the dream would have gone had Paul not started snoring directly into my ears.    So yeah, thats that.  Weird dream, cafeteria dinner, and severe diarrhea when I woke up this morning.    I told you that Paul and I had a great time last night.

      TGIW!  THANK GOD ITS WEDNESDAY!  SIKE!  I promised last week that I would stop with that shit.  (but I can never stop) (TGIW is my heroine)  Hellooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!  Good news yall.  Talked to my brother today and he was in incredibly good spirits.  The Iraq attack is going fast now and it looks as though this war may be over very very soon.  (I can hear the sigh of relief from most of the country)  This new development doesnt change the deployment plans my brother has already received.  He will still be going to Baghdad or Basra, but it will definitely be in the vein of a peacekeeping mission.  I have yet to talk to my dad and mom about this, but I know that they are sporting some major wood over this news.  Our biggest fear was that Winfield would be in combat and that is something that none of us were ready to deal with.    Winfield was also overjoyed because he was notified today that he will be promoted to Captain over the next couple of months.  He was just promoted to First Lieutenant in December and he told me today that it is completely unheard of for a soldier to be promoted to the next rank within the same year.  His commanders are overly impressed with his work and they want to make sure that he is rewarded for his diligence and excellence.  I am so proud of him for doing his best and for achieving the goals he has set for himself.    I went on and on about how wonderfully we all think he is doing and he was very glad to hear that.  I know how deeply he misses his family, but hearing from me that we are riding on his coattails throughout this whole ARMY experience makes it all seem worth it to him.  Yet, we are all very vehement in how we feel about him getting out once his four-year duty has been completed.  My only fear is that he will reconsider staying in the service if he is constantly being promoted.  The money is good and with each new rank he achieves it gets even better.  But I think this war situation has shaken him up quite a bit and I dont think he will remain enlisted once his time is up.  At least thats what I am hoping for.    I just want my brother back.  Thats all.    In other newstonight is date night with Paul and I am muchly excited.  This will be our fourth date in a row!  I am so proud of him for making such an effort to spend every Wednesday with me, doing date-like things.  I am sure we will go to dinner tonight and maybe rent a movie.  I miss him a lot today for some reason.  Isnt it weird how even though you see your boyfriend on a regular basis, some days are just impossible to get through without them?  I am in a pretty good mood today, yet I dont want to do anything without him by my side.  Hes my little ghoulie!  And he is also my poo.  And thats about as queer as I get.   Last night I spent the evening with Miss Ari.  We had an excellent time.  We eventually ended up back at her apartment, smoking the bowls and talking our faces off.  We havent hung out, just the two of us, in a very long time and I realized how much I truly miss it.  At 11pm I realized that I had stayed out way too late and that I was way too drunk for a Tuesday night.  She helped throw my sorry ass in a cab and I went home and immediately passed out.  (But not before consuming my third and fourth slice of pizza for the day)  I  gotta  have something else for lunch today.    My penis is feeling very smooth today.  I dont know why.  Its not as though I have been putting lotion on it or anything.  Its just very nice to touch.  I woke up this morning and immediately started playing with myself cuz the texture was justwell, for lack of better words, delectable!  It even  looks  pretty.  How did that happen???  Picture my cock with a little sunbonnet on the tip and with a nice scarf wrapped lightly around the shaft.  Its my little gentleman.  My little English gentleman.  Only two more days until  THE HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES .  Heh heh heh.  MoooWAAAHAHAHAHA! I am fucking Lame City, USA.  Its just that the movie is directed by Rob Zombie and it looks to be so disgusting that I MUST see it in the theater.  No one else will pay money to go watch it, so I must support it to the best of my ability.  Plus I am so in the mood for movie theater popcorn.  My body isnt as much in the mood for it as I am, but I tell my body to go fuck itself.  At least for one more week.  I will start slimming down next week.  This week has already been shot to shit.  What with yesterday being a 4 slice of pizza day.  Egads.    Since when do I ever write egads?    I just started another David Sedaris book.  This one is called  Barrel Fever  and so far so good!  I love Sedariss quick wit and willingness to give over to his reader.  He is, by far, the funniest author I have ever read.  Usually I avoid comedic literature, but with him, I am what I like to calladdicted.  Each book is filled with short stories that are mostly fiction.  He dives into his family, his relationships, his entertainment personaits all brilliantly written and his writing tone allows his words to convey exactly the feeling and content he is trying to express.  If you have never read any of his work, I suggest getting  Me Talk Pretty One Day .  You will not be disappointed.  I guarantee it!  Okayoff to eat some grub.    Wonder if its normal to eat 6 slices of pizza in 36 hours?   Wonder if  its normal to gain 4 belt sizes in 7 days?  You know, at this rate, no one is going to be stopping me, asking me to model for them, again.   Well, that is, unless I consider the plus-size modeling career.  That could be some serious fun.  Being in the limelight and shoving my face with greasy boogers all day.

      My name is Joe.    That was my introduction into todays entry.  Sometimes being creative is just so completely exhausting.  And I am very tired today.  I have no idea why.  Its not like my life is filled up with late night parties and charity events.  More often than not, I get a full 8 hours sleep and make sure never to exercise or exert my body in any type of way, so I should have no reason to be anything, but dutifully rested each and every day.  Yet, here I sit with eyes still puffy from sleeping and its 12:45pm.  Harumph.  Last night Paul and I had taco salads again for the 3rd time in 8 days.  Its not like we are eating leftovers.  We are creating these taco salads from scratch each time.  Could we get any more boring?  I think tonight for dinner I will have something NOT Mexican.  In fact, maybe I will have pizza.  Havent eaten that in the last 12 minutes.  Might as well see if I still like it  Oh great, now I am totally having pizza for lunch.  I just did it to myself.  And Lord knows I still like pizza.   Pizza Pizza Pizza Pizza Pizza  Anyway, did yall catch the beautiful comment that some dickhead left in my shout outs from yesterday?  Kelly has been getting comments from this douchebag too, so I am positive that it is someone that knows both of us.  Reading what this loser wrote didnt make me upset at all.  It made me realize that there are people in the world that are more sad and pathetic than I am.  I complain every day about having nothing exciting to do with my life, yet I must be exaggerating, cuz I never have to resort to calling people cunts and fagots on their websites.   Yet, I do know the correct spelling of faggot as I grew up being called that name.  Fagot reads like FAGO with a silent t.   Snores.  I wish it did upset me, cuz then I would have some sort of adrenaline coursing through my veins.  Yet, instead, I sit here filled with as much laziness and passivity as I had before I even found the comment.    Know what I did this weekend that was hella stupid?    I was cleaning out my bowl (marijuana pipe) and I broke off a piece of glass on the inside.  Unfortunately, the broken piece was slightly bigger than the hole where your mouth goes, so I couldnt get it out.  I tried sticking a hangar up inside of it, but to no avail.  SO!  I had a GENIUS idea!  I remembered from high school physics (although I never took that course) that glass expands when heated up.  So I held up my lighter to the mouth piece of the bowl for about 3 minutes.  I forgot that when you do that, a black coating of soot covers the glass and anything that touches it, gets covered in black as well.  I quickly looked around for a napkin or tissue in order to wipe off the black gook.  No luck.  Quickly and without any sort of brainpower, I decide to wipe the bowl off on my stomach.  (I happened to be naked at the time as I was about to get into the shower).  I put the bowl to my stomach and began wiping off the black shit.  A searing pain quickly followed as I realized that I was burning a hole right through my stomach.  IDIOT ME forgot that only two seconds earlier I was holding a lighter up the mouthpiece.  I threw the bowl on the bed and inspected the damage I had done to my tums.   Tums = stomach  A blood blister immediately formed and now I sit here typing this entry with a wound the size of a quarter on my right love handle.  Its REALLY pretty.  And I didnt feel stupid at ALL for having wiped off a blazing hot bowl onto my naked skin.    Why do I do the things I do?  Here is a poem I just wrote:    GAY    Gays.  Quickly flowing through the hands of time I see your dick embraced with mine. We slurp, we chew, we even suck Cat and mouse, a game of luck.  Some day soon, I will beat your face My boner is tan, Asian race. When I grow up Ill see my fate Cuz gays are gay and gays are straight.  People eat the strangest things This shoe belongs to Lisa Lings Some day soon, Ill be showbiz If no one knows I tasted jizz.  Gays.  --------------------by Joe Cut the Shit    Ahhhhthat felt good.  I am REALLY good at poems, so I thought I would just get one down on paper instead of having it roll around inside my head.  If I just did this more often, I might have a book of collected works.  I mean, cuz I write such good prose.    My stomach is starting to churn and burn from hunger.  I am off to lunch.   What should I have today? Salad?   Cookies? Sandwich? Hot dogs? Oh yeahpizza!     And if I wipe off the top layer of grease with my napkin, then it becomes fat free!    ROCK!  I am off to La Famiglia!    AY YI YI!

      Fucking Monday I hate you fucking damn motha fuckin stupid Mondays.grrrrr..  I have this new thing that I just love.  Its called Monday morning anxiety.  I wake up every Monday, at 7am, and lay in bed with an upset stomach and nervous tension.  I try my hardest to fall back to sleep, but it doesnt work.  No matter what I do, I am forced to sit and worry about nothing.  Eventually my alarm goes off and I crawl out of bed and into the worst day of the week.  I fucking hate you Monday.  Had a pretty good weekend.  Paul stiffed me on Friday and we fought for an hour and then I decided that I didnt want to spend time with him anyway and forbid him from coming over to my pad.  Turns out that  House of 1000 Corpses  doesnt open up until this upcoming weekend, so we didnt miss out.  Saturdays lunch with my parents was, of course, incredible.  I got to eat good food, take home tons of leftovers (which were gone by the time I went to bed that night) and spend time with my two favorite people on the planet.  They came down with two friends of the family and it was great to see them too.  I took the group souvenir shopping and then to Toys R Us and they loved it!  We visited the E.T. and Jurassic Park section and my parents were in awe.  My moms friend, Bev, went running through the Barbie Dream House like a mad woman.  They each bought $5 teddy bears and we were on our way!    It was a super good time.    Saturday night I went out with my love, Joanna.  We went shopping for her friend, April, and then to this bar called FUBAR.  We had wanted to go to a bar that had cheap drinks and a MEGATOUCH game and this is the one we came across.  It is located about 4 blocks from my apartment and when we walked through the door, we saw ashtrays all over the place.  Now, knowing that NYC is under a No Smoking Ban I was shocked to see this type of paraphernalia lying around.   I immediately walked over to the bartender and asked her if we were really allowed to smoke.  She said Of course you are honey!  Have a seat and light up!  That I did and Joanna and I stayed through the night having the time of our lives.  We talked about so much and learned even more about each other.  We laughed, we cried, it was a very good time.  And we did in fact play Photo Hunt.  I dont think she likes it as much as me, but she worked hard at it and thats what counts.    This week is bullshit.    I have nothing to look forward to yet and thats gotta change soon.  Everyone at work is severely under my skin.  Its just one of those days when I want to murder someone for no reason.  I guess my shit quiz was right.  Diarrhea is murder.  Murder to spell that is.  Even they couldnt spell it right in their own quiz!  Snores.  I saw  One Hour Photo  this weekend and I thought it to be brilliant.  It was tre creepy and the acting/writing/directing was good.  Its nice to see these three elements actually work together in a cohesive manner for once.  I recommend it.  The movie.  Not writing/acting/directing in a cohesive manner.  I also saw  Simone  this weekend too.  Oh never heard of it?  Yeah, cuz its garbage.  I decided that Al Pacino should just stop making films all together.  He is doing nothing, but pissing me off these days.  When you are AL PACINO, you have a right to turn down bad scripts.  You just do.  Instead, he continues making shit.  Ah well The director cant decide whether he wants the movie to be realism or a farce.  And since he cant decide, the actors cant decide and the whole movie comes off looking like a jumbled piece of nonsense.  MAN IT WAS SO BAD.  And lastly, I saw  End of Days  with Arnold Schwarzeneggar.  My first husband.  (I had to drop him when he started to go flab.)  Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.  Oh did I fall asleep just now?  Funny, cuz I did that during the movie too.  Its SNOWING SO HARD TODAY!  In a way I love it, cuz it gives me hope that the city will blow up and I will be able to leave work early.  In another way it pisses me off, cuz my job would never close and the commute home is going to be that much worse.  So yeahthe jury is still out on this April blizzard.    I am so boring today.  I cant even play on the internet with any success.  I stare blankly at my screen and I have nothing to contribute to anything.  At one point, I put my head on my desk and just sat there.  I didnt close my eyes, I didnt relax my body.I just sat there.  FUCKING BORED OUT OF MY SKULL.  Bored with my life that is.  Need a new hobby.  Like punching people in the face that I dont like.  That would not only give me something to do, but also find a way to release this pent up boredom frustration I got goin.    So Ari and I just went out to have a smoke and let me tell you how fucking cold it is. so cold.  Snow has covered the city and the thing that pisses me off the most is that I am still sitting at my fucking desk.  Do not think that I havent already given thought to throwing myself on the ground and breaking a leg.  At least then I can lay in bed and watch TV without any sort of guilt.    Ah shitI gotta go.  This journal is even boring ME today.

             I am  Diarrhea  .  Diarrhea's are by far the most humorous of all the shits going for the big laugh at all costs. From fart jokes to slapstick humor Diarrhea's are know for pulling out the stops when it comes to shits and giggles... though Diarrhea's do have their down sides.. And like the sad clowns they are, Diarrhea's are actually dying inside and prone to suicide and even murder...  What Kinda Shit Are You?

      Finally, its Friday.    I made a big mistake.  I rubbed out all of the gel I had in my hair, cuz it looked like nutsack.  Now what remains is a huge POOF of bullshit.  I sit here at my desk, glancing at my reflection and grow more and more embarrassed at the damage I have caused.  I tried to put water in it to fix it, but to no avail.  I still sit here laying claim to the worst hairstyle on the planet.  Lordy, I really need to get it cut soon.    Last night I finally got my wish of eating sushi!  Paul and I went to dinner at our favorite Soosh place and sat at the bar so we could watch the chefs do it first hand.  It was fun, cept watching people make your food is pretty sick.  The chefs didnt wear gloves and when they were putting the rolls together, it all looked so slimy and barfaricious.   Yet, when our order came, I shoved each roll down my gullet.  I even tried a new kind last night!  DRAGON MAKI!  Ooooooooooh scary!  Cuz of dragons!  This particular roll is covered in avocado.  I liked it, but prefer my Philly Maki better.    Paul and I finally saw  Jackass the Movie .  OMIGOD I loved it.  I am not a HUGE fan of the show, but I have been known to catch it on occasion.  Paul owns Steve-O Uncut and that shits pretty fucked up.  (If you dont know, Steve-O is one of the main stunt performers on Jackass.  Hes the one that always runs around naked) But  Jackass the Movie  was fucking hysterical.  Most of it is them hurting themselves and I dont really laugh at that stuff, but when they play jokes on the public, they go so overboard, that I lose myself in hysterical laughter.  I wont give away any of the scenes, cuz I want everyone to experience it for the first time by themselves.  But MAN I was rolling on the floor unable to contain myself.  Honestly, I dont remember the last time I laughed so intensely.    Still no hook up with Paul.  We are hanging out again tonight so maybe then?  Maybe I need to relax and stop freaking out about it every day.  That would probably be step #1.    I decided that I dont like Pauls roommate Lisa anymore.  Member when I hated her, but then I started to like her?  Well, she gets on my nerves again and big time.  Last night she got home from this event that her job was sponsoring and she bounds into Pauls room wasted and goes I need to smoke pot!  Whos got some?   Now clearly, I am the only one that could have the pot as Paul never buys his own.  (Dont get me started on that one)  But I have like none left.  So I say I dont have any left.  I am SO sorry.  Paul chirps in Yes you do.  Its on the dresser.    At that point I could have easily ripped Pauls lungs out.  But I calmly responded with No it isnt Paul.  There is  none  left.  Then Lisa goes You dont HAVE to smoke with me if you dont want to.    OH SNORES LISA.  Fucking go away.    In any case, I covertly hid the pot that Paul claims I had sitting on the dresser.  Then I sat there acting as though they were both out of their minds to even THINK that I would have it on me.  Eventually Lisa gave up and went to bed and I look at Paul and go Dont you EVER offer up MY pot to YOUR roommates.  I am not the supplier of everyones drug whims.  The minute people want to start tossing me some cash, THEN they get some smoke.    Paul waved me away in a condescending manner and then I stuck my finger in his belly button again.    THAT GOT HIM!  Thats what I do now when he pisses me off.  Stick my finger way down into his belly button.        Tonight we are off to  THE HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES .   SPOOOOOOKY  and  GORRRRRRRRRRRRRY  and  ITALLLLLLLLLICS .  I am excited to be grossed out.    Tomorrow my parents come.  Tomorrow night I will hopefully find some plans cuz right now I got none!  I havent had a drink at all this week.  In fact, I havent had a drink since last Friday!  What is happening to me?!?! I wish I had friends to go out with.  But ehits been nice to detox a little.   SHABBAT SHALOM ALL!    Be back in here this weekend.

      What up what up??  Just got off the phone having talked to my lovely Rita.  She sounded stuffed up, but ok.  Things arent going as easily as I had hoped they would for her in Syracuse, but we are planning a visit soon and I know that that will lift her sprits! As the conversation came to a close, I got the impression that she felt a bit better.  Its hard on both of us, not having each other to sit and discuss every little detail of our lives with.  We went from being Siamese twin babies to being separated so brutally by way of  rusty knives.  And I dont remember the Dr. using any sort of antiseptic.   This shit still hurts!  Paul and I did NOT hook up last night.  At one point, we were both lying next to each other on his bed watching TV.  When the commercial came, I looked over at him and noticed that he had pulled his pants down and was staring at me with greedy eyes and a boner in his hand.  I stifled a laugh and asked: Oh, are you finally ready to be physical with me again?  The look in his eyes didnt go away and he replied Put your mouth on my dick.    Um, excuse me.  I dont fucking think so.    I have been begging and pleading with this kid for weeks to take off his clothes and touch me, and he always says No, I feel weird.  I dont want to.  Im LAME!  So last night when he told me to Put (my) mouth on his dick I decided that there was no harm in putting off hooking up till another day.  I leaned over him and let him think that I was going to give him a blowjob and as I got close to it, I took one hand and slapped his dick in its face and took my other hand and poked him inside his belly button.  He screamed and then burst out laughing and said WHAT?  NO BLOW?    Who is he kidding?    No blow.  We did kiss a bit during the rest of the night, but the mood was lost.  We bitched and bitched at each other about where to go to dinner.  I wanted sushi cuz it was cheap and close to the apartment.  He wanted to go to a GAY restaurant and snores.  So we went to this place called Stingy LuLus, where the waitstaff is all drag queens.  Kind of like Lucky Chengs, but not nearly as cool.  The menu was lame shit and our drag queen waitress was nothing more than a bearded man in a wig.  It was so faux drag queen that I told Paul we should leave.  He had no problem doing that, so we drank our waters, left two dollars on the table and took off.  We ended up at one of my favorite little restaurants in the city, Yaffa.  Kelly and her ex-girlfriend Randy introduced me to this place when we first moved to the city and I have been back numerous times since.  They have the BEST chicken sandwiches and their carrot dressing is slammin.  Paul and I had a very nice dinner and as usual ended up with 3 courses.  We are turning into gigantic monsters.  Someone take the food out of my mouth and give it to an Ethiopian baby.  We talk, ere day, how we are going to be the two biggest porkers in the Bahamas. Ehpth.  We discussed what to do over the next couple of days, since he has time off from work.  Tonight we are going to an IMAX movie and tomorrow I think we may go see  House of 1000 Corpses .  Rob Zombie directed that sick shit and I think it looks SPOOOOOOOOKY.  And also disgusting.  I cant wait.  I am so happy that things between he and I are going so well.  He is being extra cute these days and its making me love him deeper and deeper.   My parents are coming to NYC this weekend to see  Beauty and the Beast , on Broadway, with some friends of theirs.  The show is beautiful and I know they will love it.  Before that, I am going to meet them for lunch at  The Playwright Tavern .  Its like my new favorite place.  The burgers are big and the dumps I take after are noteworthy.  I wish I could see my parents for lunch every weekend.  Life would be much more relaxing.  Cept last weekend, I left wanting to kill myself  Embarrassingly enough, I am walking around with Michelle Branch playing in my Discman.  I stumbled across the CD last week and I decided to listen to it all the way through today.  To be honest, I love it.  I mean, Im not obsessed with it and have no need to memorize all of the words to all of the songs, but.   But there is this one song (track 2) that is the theme song for MTVS  Sorority Life  and I just love it.  I love it so much that I clipped my dick off and turned my genitals into a vagina.  Next year I am pledging DZO.  You know how it goes.  Wanting a vagina so you can be in a sorority.  Its natural.  Heres some things I bet you didnt know about me:  My granny does indeed have a third nipple.  Just like Marky Mark!  But I have never seen it up close.  My dad has and he advises me against it.    I didnt come out of the closet until I was 21.    The first person I jerked off to and had an actual orgasm over was Gilad from Bodies in Motion.  My favorite food when I was a child was french fries and it still is.  I have only been on a horse once.  But it didnt walk anywhere.  It stood there like a dumb ass.    My nickname during my Freshman year of highschool was Fairy Fruit Fag.  I liked that a lot.  My nickname during my Sophomore year of highschool was Pat - As in androgynous Pat from SNL.   That felt gooood.  My nickname during my Junior year of highschool was Joe.  Seems fair.  My nickname during my Senior year of highschool was Jim Carrey.  Who the fuck knows.  But at least the name was male oriented.    I have been known to take pisses in cups rather than walk ALL the way to the bathroom.   Cuz I am used to living in mansions, obviously.  The sports I played growing up: Flag Football, baseball, volleyball, softball, basketball, and wrestling.  The sports I was good at: Choir.  I never get sick, but weird things happen to my body ALL the time.  My most recent list of maladies include: a pinched nerve, weird rash on my face and elbows, bleeding gums, a baby tooth (still in my mouth), scars on my dick which then became a mound of flaking-off dead skin due to my overuse of steroid cream, enough crusty boogers to kill a man, and most importantly, gayness.  That should be enough for now.    Time to go get lunch.  Sometimes I really do wish that I could just turn into Pizza the Hut and be done with it.  Then I wouldnt have to spend so much damn money on food, when I could just eat myself!  But I would make sure that  THIS  Pizza the Hut had no olives.     I hate you olives.

      TGIW!    Ok, can I stop with that lame TGIW shit already?  I gotta get some new material.  And fast.  So, when one problem ends, another begins.  I am not as miserable today about my brother and the whole war in Iraq thing, as I have been over the last couple of days.  Instead Im pissed cuz my hair looks like fucking garbage.  Can anyone answer a question for me?  Why is it (for guys) that one day you go to bed and your hair looks fine, but when you wake up the next day, you notice that somehow your hair has grown an extra half inch over night and now looks like cunt?  Its a very strange dilemma.    I am feeling SO MUCH better today.  Im like a brand new boy.  I have to say that the support I have gotten from everyone around me (including my readershow could I possibly forget?!) has helped me tremendously.  I have bounced back and feel much more like my old self again.  You know, fat, balding, and missing half my teeth!  Its great!  Tonight is Date Night with Paul.  I think we might have sushi.  I havent had those little fishy bastards in about 2 weeks and I am in some sort of withdrawal.    Yet, Paul wants to go somewhere gay, of course.  So, as per my weekly ritual, I have picked out a few nice restaurants in Chelsea and am giving him the option of picking the final place.  He is paying, afterall.  I dont care where we go.  We have been having so much fun on these date nights that I am excited just to be with him, out to dinner.    When Paul and I hung out on Monday night, we decided that tonight we were going to start hooking up again.  I know how lame it sounds that we have to plan this, but its been 2-3 months since we have had an orgasm together.  A lots been going on and to be honest, when you are with someone for over 3 years, sometimes the other issues take the place of physical romance.  I am not upset that we havent been intimate, but its definitely damn time that we start doing the nasty again.  I mean, at this point, Im not going to lose my virginity until I am 54.  Oh yeah.  Did you forget that I was a virgin?  Cuz I pathetically am.  Lets not talk about it right now.    --Sidenote-- I woke up incredibly horny this morning and was FORCED to jerk my dick off.  Good thing I build up a lot of jizz during the day, or I would never be able to get the hooks tonight.    SO LAST NIGHT, I am walking to my apartment from my Columbus Circle subway stop, when this Asian guy stops me and asks Excuse me sir, have you ever modeled before? Joe:  (Having been stopped by people like this before, I say:) Yes, I have. Asian Persuasion:  Are you currently being represented by anyone? Joe:  No, actually I am in between agencies at the moment. A.P.:  Oh, great!  How would you like to come to an open call for TransAtlantic tomorrow night at 7:30pm? Joe:  Im not sure what I have going on tomorrow night, but if you want to give me your card, I will think about it. A.P.:  Well, actually, I cant give you my card if you arent going to guarantee me that you will show up. Joe:  Okay, thats weird.  I dont know if I can make it tomorrow night, but if you give me your card, I can follow up with you in the morning. A.P.:  I cant do that sir.  My job is to find attractive men and women and get them to come to our open call. Joe:  But I dont understand.  You will give me your card, but only if I make a promise to you that I will be there tomorrow night. A.P.:  Correct. Joe:  What if I promise you that I will go, but then dont show up?  Do you come back and take the card away from me? A.P.:  (Getting flustered)  No, well of course not.  But we will have your name and phone number listed with our company and if you didnt show up, I guess we would have a problem working with you in the future. Joe:  Hmmm.  I think this sounds sketchy and I have been stopped on the street for this type of thing before.  My feeling is that if you were really interested in me, as a potential model for your company, you would make every effort to accommodate me, am I correct? A.P.:  (starting to lose his mind) Uh, yesumno.  I dont know.  Are you interested in coming to an open call tomorrow night for TransAtlantic?  Joe:  Can I have your card? A.P.:  Not unless you are guaranteeing me that you will be at the open call. Joe:  (starting to laugh) Good day to you sir.  I walked away and when I got to the end of the block, I looked back to the spot where the guy had stopped me.  He was still standing there looking as confused as I have ever seen an Asian look.  I smiled to myself and went home to eat chicken and scalloped potatoes.  BTW, it was a YEM dinner.  Why is it that no one can ever stop me and discover me for real?  Why, when I am stopped on the street, is it only to be scammed for one reason or another?  Its some shit, lemme tell you.  You gotta be careful who you give your phone number to in this city and even more careful what type of situations you put yourself into.  Yet, if the guy who stopped me was a bodybuilder, instead of an Asian, I would have done whatever he asked me to do.  And I would have been putting myself into a  much  more dangerous position.  But, its just that I like muscles so much.    Spoke with Rita today for the first time in awhile.  I sent her a very long email last night detailing everything that has been going on in my life.  She wrote back immediately and then called me as soon as she could today.  Hearing her voice was like getting a load blown in my ear.  Or, hmmm.  No, not  getting  the load blown in my ear, more like  blowing  the load in someones ear.   OK I DONT KNOW!  Whatever kind of load it was, it made me so happy.  We are trying to arrange a visit for the sometime this month.  I havent seen her since she moved out of our apartment on March 1st.   I long for her company daily.  I am not sure yet if she will be coming to NYC or if I will be going to Syracuse for the visit, but either way, it couldnt come fast enough.  She is my love.  Time to get something to eat.  I am so starving, that I am about ready to start swallowing the fingernails that I so readily chew off every day.  I have never actually done that before, but at this point, add some salt and blue cheese to them and I am sure they would taste just fine.    YEM!

      Today is a new day.    After I left work yesterday, I went to Pauls apartment as we had plans to go grocery shopping for dinner.  I think I spoke 7 words between 5:30-8pm.  Paul was very patient with me and stayed close to me throughout the entire shopping adventure.  At one point, I had to walk away from Paul cuz I thought that I was going to lose my shit and start sobbing.  I walked to the frozen sausage section and stared at the different boxes of Jimmy Deans while I tried to regain control.  Paul found me about 10 minutes later and asks:  Oh, did you want to have sausage for dinner?  I smiled and told him never.    When we got back to my apartment, I sat on my bed and smoked a cigarette.  A commercial came on that asked families of US Troops to send pictures of their sons/daughters, serving in the war, to the television station.  I quickly recalled a conversation with my mom ,from this weekend, in which she asked me what I thought about her sending Winfields picture in to the local news station.  Everything toppled inside my head and I finally let out all of the emotion that had been pent up in me during the day.  Paul sat down next to me on the bed and put his arm around me.  He let me cry out all of the pain I was feeling and when I was done he kissed me on the cheek.  After that, I felt much better.  We decided to make taco salads for dinner (my flavorite) and my mood improved drastically throughout the night.  At one point, Paul looks at me skeptically and goes Youre manic Joe.  I laughed and said I know.  Weird.  We spent the rest of the night in bed holding each other, watching reality TV.  Funny how reality TV is nothing like the reality I live in on a day to day basis.  I like that.  I like that a lot.    I woke up today feeling much better.  I got out of bed with a little bit more strength than what I had yesterday.  As the day has progressed, I have started to get back more of my personality.  My brother called around 1pm and we had a wonderful conversation.  I sobbed the entire time, but by the end of the talk, I felt like he and I completely connected on all of the emotions that my family is dealing with.  We are a strong unit of four and over the last couple of days, that unity has been strengthened even more so.  Winfield has promised me that after he returns from the war, he will definitely finish up the rest of his commitment and he is out.  Definitely.  I just needed to hear it from his mouth before I started getting my hopes up.    I want so badly for my family to return to the normality of what we once were.   Other than that, I am doing much better today.  If it wasnt for the support I have gotten from Ari, in particular, I would never have been able to survive the workplace.  She has totally taken care of me and gone out of her way to make sure that I am protected from the usual bullshit.  I feel so grateful to have her.  The rest of my office is being incredibly supportive as well.  They know when to leave me alone and they know when to ask me how I am doing.  As for my friends, they are being exactly the same.  Phone calls, e-mails, whatever.  Everyone can see how badly I am feeling and they have done as much or as little for me as I need.  I feel very lucky to have these people around me.     The Real World: Las Vegas  ends tonight.  Thank the Lord in heaven above.  Talk about the worst, longest, and most boring  Real World  ever.  I hate all of the cast members and as they cry their good-byes tonight, I will laugh in each and every one of their faces.  So you seeeven though I am dealing with sadness myself and love for all people, I will always hate these particular cast members and I will retain my immaturity when it comes to them.  K?  K.  Alright, sorry so snoresville.  I will try to write some more in here later.  And I promise to make it an entry based on something interesting and not just on my sad sap sally life.

      Please help me  INTERPRET MY DREAM :  Kelly and I are walking through the streets of Washington DC.  All around us we see landmarks.  There are street vendors and balloons and the smell of hot dogs in the air.  Its a beautiful day outside and there is a cloudless sky.  As we walk along, Kelly and I laugh at different things and talk about the fact that we are having a great time visiting DC.    We hear an airplane approaching overhead and we both stop to see where it is coming from.  Over the top of a very tall building, we see a jumbo jet fly into our vision.  We both comment on how low the plane is flying and how slowly it seems to be moving.  As the plane crosses our line of vision, it seems to sink even lower to the ground.  Just before it is out of sight, the plane turns its nose and looks directly at Kelly and me.  Kelly and I laugh out loud as we have never seen a plane turn its nose and stare at someone before.  We walk to the end of the sidewalk and watch the plane swivel back and come back toward us.  We notice the White House in plain view.  The airplane flies towards the White House and just as its about to collide into the roof, it accelerates speed and bounces off the building as though the entire thing is made of rubber.  It literally bounces off and keep flying.    Thats when the streets and buildings start to shake uncontrollably.  Kelly and I stop laughing and realize that there is an earthquake starting.  The crowds in the street start panicking and we hear someone yell Its the terrorists!  Kelly and I look up and see the tops of skyscrapers swaying in the wind.  Mass confusion and hysteria.  People are running and screaming.  We see mothers trying to grab their children as they frantically figure out how to take shelter.  To our left someone calls Kellys name.  Kelly!  Kelly, bring Joe and get in here.    I dont recognize the face of the person who calls us, but I see that he is standing in the doorway of a museum.  Kelly and I quickly run over to the man and he ushers us into the grand lobby of some random museum.  When we get inside, we notice that there are hundreds of people crammed into the lobby.  There are still screams all around us.  Kelly and I move to the center of the room.  Suddenly there is silence in the lobby.  Not a sound.  Kelly and I look at each other wondering why everyone is so quiet.  I dont think this is an earthquake, I say to her.  The walls of the museum start to wobble and shake.  Then, without warning, both of the walls on the east and west side of the building collapse in on themselves.  Mass hysteria again.  Kelly and I can see that everyone standing underneath the walls are immediately crushed.  We are then bounced around like a pinball by everyone trying to grab their families and get out of the building.  I glance to my left and see that not only have the walls caved in, they are being moved into the center of the room, seemingly by a 90 ft. bulldozer, although I cant actually see the piece of machinery.    Kelly grabs my arm and when I look at her, I notice tears streaming down her face.  We are going to die Joe.  We are going to die today.  I grab her by the arm and I start shoving people out of the way.  Cinderblocks begin falling from the ceiling.  They crash all around us.  People are being crushed immediately by the falling cement.  Still holding onto Kelly, I begin climbing over the fallen blocks.  I can see the exit door and although it cant be more than 25 feet away, it feels as though we will never reach it.  I climb and climb and shove people to the left and right.  I look back to make sure Kelly is still behind me and I see that she is lying on the floor.  She is dead.  A cinderblock has crushed her skull.  I stand and look at her in horror.  It is at this point, that I realize that I am going to die too.  I begin to ask God for a chance at survival.  With people screaming and dying all around me, I ask God to spare my life.  A peace washes over me as I look through the falling rocks at the door.  I say Im going to die.  I am going to die today.  With that, the entire ceiling falls and I stare at the rocks as gravity pulls them to earth.    I wake up with a start in my bed.  I am covered in sweat and my heart is pounding out of my chest.  Now, I am known for having nightmares.  I dream vividly every night, but about once a week, I get a horrible dream that I just cant shake.  This one in particular was so horrifying that I sat in my bed for a half an hour smoking cigarettes, trying to get my mind on something else.  I prayed to God over and over asking him to clear my thoughts.  My biggest fear was going back to sleep and re-entering the dream, which has happened to me before.    Eventually I did fall back to sleep and I didnt have the dream again.  But since then I havent been able to stop thinking about it.  I run the events of the dream over and over in my head in great detail.  It makes my stomach hurt.    What do you think it means?

      As much as I try to let my head do some of the thinking, my heart always steps in and controls my actions.    Last night I met up with Ahmad and told him that I thought it would be best if we pursued our new found relationship as friends.  I was unsure as to how he would take the news.  Although we have only known each other for a week, I could tell that his feelings were progressing way too fast.  So, in order to get us on the same page, I invited him over for a pot session.  When Ahmad showed up at my apartment, he was all smiles.  He could tell that something was wrong with me almost immediately and without any hesitation, we dove into a conversation about us.  I explained that I am just not ready to let go of Paul completely.  Against my better judgement, I am still greatly in love with Paul.  He consumes most of my thoughts every day and it wouldnt be fair to Ahmad for me to continue being with him in the same way.  I told him that I thought he was an incredible person and that at a different time in our lives, we might be perfect for each other.  I further explained that I was most afraid of hurting him down the road and ultimately destroying any chance we could have at a friendship.  Ahmad was immediately upset.  He did his best to hide the way he felt and to be logical about the situation.  When that didn't work, he pulled every trick in the book.  He told me he couldnt be just friends.  He told me that he would give me the world.  He told me that he was ready to change my life in the most positive of ways.  Without saying it, he told me that he was quickly and for the first time in his life, falling in love.    I countered everything he said with ease and did my best to make him see that a friendship is what is best for us right now.  Ultimately I realized that there was no getting through to him.  Ahmad was hurt and I was grateful that I had this conversation with him as quickly as I did.  It horrified me to think how he would have felt had I waited another week.  I told him to go home and to put me out of his head for a few days.  The kid needs perspective and having me around all the time will not allow him that.  He gave me a kiss on the cheek and walked out the door.    Tonight is supposed to be my one night with Paul for the week.  Of course, Paul has fucked up the plans and we will not be hanging out afterall.  Paul has no respect for anyone, but himself.  Nothing changes.  But I have realized something about MYSELF.  I am not scared of losing Paul anymore.  I am not scared of living my own life, independent of a boyfriend.  I am not scared of stepping out into the world alone.  For so long I lived under this faade that I needed a boy, that I needed someone to take care of me.  Now I see that thats a bunch of horseshit.  No one needs ANYONE else to make them happy.  Happiness comes from within.  Gosh, its so easy to forget that sometimes.    As much as I would love to step out and meet a new guy As much as I would love to let go of Paul forever As much as I would love to shift my life into another direction  I realize that I am still not ready.  I have come farther with all of this stuff than I ever thought was possible.  But now that I see that I have the ability to do these things, I want to focus on making small steps toward achieving them.  Paul is still my number one.  After 3 and half years, I dont know how to treat my happiness as the primary  priority.  In my mind, I still worry about his happiness so much more of the time.    It may take weeks, it may take monthshell it could be another year of this.  But deep down I know that eventually I will achieve the level of satisfaction and contentment that I have always wanted.    Eventually I will fall in love with someone who is right for  me .

      My God.    If I could be any more worn out and tired today, I think I would be classified as the first walking gay corpse.  I really shouldnt complain as I had one of the best weekends ever, but damn, it sapped every bit of life I had left in my body.  Besides getting little to no sleep every night, I drank and drank and drank as though alcohol was a life saving elixir.  Never once got a hangover, but hell if my eyes arent blood shot with exhaustion nonetheless.    Spent a great deal of time with Ahmad this weekend.  A bit too much perhaps.  I went into the weekend in love with him and I left the weekend wondering if I want to continue down the same path that we are currently heading on.  I think the main problem is that he likes me way too much.  He is falling hard and fast and it makes me panic with fear.  In the past I have always liked a challenge, have always gone for the bad boy.  Or at least the boy who was impossible to make like me - whether he was straight or emotionally unavailable or whatever else makes guys unattainable.  With Ahmad, its constant sweetness and compliments.  He takes amazing care of me, pays for any whim I might have, and holds me with more fervor than any hug Paul has ever bestowed upon me.  He is the ideal boyfriend, yet I just know that his heart is going to get broken.    I have tried in various ways to explain to him that we need to take everything a bit slower.  But honestly, at this point, if we were moving any slower, we would be cobwebbed over and smell like stale milk.  Ok, does that make sense at all?  Nah lets move on.  Ahmad and I had our first hook up this weekend.  He stayed over at my place on Saturday night and we did nothing, but kiss and hug.  I woke up at 8:30am Sunday morning to him kissing my neck and then we kinda just fell into it.  I did not cum, as I never do, and Ahmad finished himself.  I sucked his dick for awhile and was getting incredibly exhausted at the effort I had to put forth.  Fortunately, he read my mind and took the matter into his own hands.  Ha.  I feel very weird about the hook up.  We crossed the line and now there is no way to ever go back.    I stayed at his place last night and he made me a beautiful dinner.  He even left halfway through the evening to go get more wine, since he thought that was what I wanted.  He calls me handsome and beautiful and wants nothing but to be in love.  He has never had that experience before and it seems as though he has set his sights on falling in love with me.  I know like I sound presumptuous, but honestly, you know when someone is falling hard for you.  You know it and if you arent ready for it, it can be a very scary thing.  I have told Ahmad all about Paul.  I have explained the entire situation to him and so far he is very comfortable with it.  He understands and is willing to work around it.  Well, then again, of course he is willing to work around itI have yet to make him really do that.  As Ahmad has said over and over to me Lets just take this whole thing one day at a time.  (big sigh)  I dont know.  Paul and I spent Sunday night together.  I explained to him that Ahmad and I were officially dating and that Saturday night was the night of our first hook up.  I could tell that this hurt him.  But since I have been honest with him from the beginning, he has no reason to be angry.  In fact, he told me that its best for me TO date Ahmad right now.  Paul is not in the place to give me what I need and he doesnt want to hold me back any longer.  However, he spent the entire night being the boyfriend I have always wanted him to be.  Figures.  He left to go home to Boston on Monday morning and as he walked out my door, I looked at him and thought about how deeply in love with him I still am.    WHY WHY WHY?  Why am I still so in love with him?  Why do I want him over Ahmad?  Why do I want to give him chance after chance to make things better?  Why do I make myself crazy over this?  Why cant I just sit back and let it all happen on its own?    Paul has been working over time to make our relationship better.  However, I know he is doing this only because he is jealous of my thing with Ahmad.  I need to keep my head focused and try to do what is best for me, whether that means continuing with Ahmad or breaking it off entirely.  I have this tendency to follow my heart and not listen to my head.  This situation requires a bit of both.    By the way, my shit this morning looked like black vomit.  Very strange.  Maybe its because I spent the entire night kissing a Muslim.    Interesting.

       In the last 24 hours, I:   1) Took 4 shits.  Two of which were during the night.   2) Ate one of the best cheeseburgers of my entire life.  (And it only cost me $7(!) and it included fries!) 3) Frantically solidified plans for this weekend.   4) Rented a car for Pauls trip to Boston next week. 5) Made plans for lunch with Ahmad at one of my favorite Queens diners.  (Chicken Souvlaki from the  	Neptune, anyone?) 6) Watched 3 episodes of  Real Sex  on HBO. 7) Watched 2 episodes of  Sex and the City  on HBO. 8) Watched 1 episode of  Will and Grace  and nearly shot myself in the head before it was over.   Can you say overabundance of stereotypes?   9) Discovered a new phrase to add to my lexicon on the lame  Will and Grace  episode I watched.     	Rudeness Giuliani.  Funny, right? 10) Poked Paul in the bellybutton 11 times. 11) Did 12 sit-ups. 12) Took a cab to work because the trains at Times Square were shut down. 13) Ate two ice cream sandwiches. 14) Ate two slices of pizza. 15) Ate a fudgesicle 16) Realized I cant stop eating. 17) Figured out why I took four shits in the last 24 hours. 18) Got angry over something stupid and squashed it before I ripped the persons face off. 19) Licked a penis. 20) Was told to stop licking the penis. 21) Flicked the penis. 22) Dropped a freshly lit cigarette out of my mouth and had to leave it behind due to oncoming traffic. 23) Called my best friend. 24) Had a laughing fit so intense that my sides still hurt today. 25) Talked to my parents. 26) Prayed for my brother.   27) Smoked 14 cigarettes. 28) Got a compliment on my hairstyle. 29) Got a new belt from the clothing pantry at work. 30) Read 75 pages in my book.  ( Jaws ) 31) Listened to the  Mamma Mia  soundtrack all the way through. 32) Gave $.36 to a homeless woman with bright red lipstick riding up her face. 33) Stepped on an Asian womans hand.   34) Slept for 6 hours. 35) Broke a brand new umbrella the first time I used it. 36) Found a Good N Plenty on the floor of Pauls apartment and ate it for laughs. 37) Got embarrassed that no one laughed at me eating crap off the floor. 38) Bit a fingernail off much too low.   39) Balanced my checkbook. 40) Got pissed off at my checkbook and decided that I hate checkbooks. 41) Felt fat. 42) Felt skinny. 43) Felt like this entry is totally fucking lame. 44) Decided to end this entry with a swear word coupled with an ugly adjective. 45) Seafood cunt.  Off to lunch with Ahmad and then off to a weekend of craziness.  Most likely will not be back here until Tuesday.  But you never know!  Hope everyone has an incredibly fun Memorial Day.  I know I will!  Be safe.  And never drink the fluid from an amniotic sac.

      Hi, my name is What? My name is! Who? My name is!!!! SO GENERIC SIT-EE!  I am stuck in the middle of boresville today.  Its rainy, nothing exciting is really going on, and I dont have too much to write about.  I mean, what am I?  Selfish?  I just had a wonderful date two nights ago and now I sit here complaining that nothing fun or exciting ever happens to me.  OKI have to understand that downtime is needed at some point.  Snores.  Here is a quick story  My brother (who is currently in Baghdad) called my mom two weeks ago and was really shaken up over something horrible that had happened.  Winfield was upset because a man in his unit had started freaking out over the fact that he was in Iraq fighting in a war.  He bugged so badly that the chief officers stripped him of his artillery and weapons.  They classified him as a level 9 or some shit.  I dont remember what level it is when you go mentally insane.  But that was the level that they classified him as.    The night before this kid was to be sent home, everyone else in the unit was sleeping in the barracks in order to get rest for the next days mission.  My brother was woken up due to a loud noise echoing throughout the building.  He immediately jumped up, along with the rest of his men, and ran to where the noise came from.  When they reached the room, my brother was horrified to see the Level 9 guy lying in a pool of his own blood.  Apparently, this kid had saved one bullet before his equipment was taken away.  He snagged one of the other troops guns and used the lone bullet to kill himself.  My brother and his men were in charge of cleaning up the mess, despite the fact that they were witnesses to one of the most disturbing things any of them had ever seen.    When my brother spoke to my mom, it took all he had not to burst into tears with her on the phone.  He gets 20-minute time slots to talk and there is usually a line out the door.  He didnt want to break down in front of his fellow men.  Now, I dont tell this story lightly at all.  I just find it easier to disconnect with the emotions of what actually went down.  I cant even begin to imagine what my brother must have felt when he found the dead body.  I dont think my brother has actually seen a dead body before this whole thing happened.  It makes my heart hurt and it makes my stomach turn to even conceptualize such a horrific event.  Poor kid.  I wish he could come home now.  Changing gears  Paul and I had a very long talk last night about my date with Ahmad.  He literally forced the information right out of me.  I wasnt going to tell him originally because the idea of hurting him deliberately in any way destroys my insides.  But Paul and I have been together for a long time and he is able to pull things out of me, whether I want to talk about it or not.  I told him everything.  Well, almost everything.  I didnt tell him that my friend Joanna was the one that set me up on the date.  I didnt think that was fair to her.  Paul handled it all with grace and dignity, as he usually does when he finds out that I am interested in another guy.  He grilled me on different Ahmad related questions for about an hour and then he continued to make jokes about it for the rest of the night.    Paul is definitely jealous over the fact that I had a great time with Ahmad.  I explained to him that if he would just step up to the plate and be a better boyfriend, or at least a much less neglectful boyfriend, I would drop Ahmad instantly and be with only him.  He laughed my comment off and told me that he is still not ready.  When I told him that I would continue to see Ahmad, Paul said Maybe it is better that we both date other people for awhile.  Sure Paul.  You go ahead and date other people.  THE ONLY REASON I AM DOING THIS IS BECAUSE YOU DONT PAY ANY ATTENTION TO ME.  Gah!  He will take it more seriously once I start to have real feelings for another guy.  And at that pointat that point it will be way too late.  I wont love Paul anymore.    This morning when I got out of bed, Paul was already in the shower.  I deliberately waited for him to finish, rather than joining him in the bathroom.  When he came back to my room, he was all I love you so much, I missed you while we were sleeping, I cant wait to spend time with you tonight.  Barf.  Why was he putting on this show?  I gave him a brief and very un-passionate kiss on his way out of my apartment.  Why does he do this?  Why does he LOVE me one minute and DESPISE me the next?  Why do I have so many mixed emotions about all of this?    I have to do what is best for me.  And more importantly, I have to keep telling myself that it is ok that I am doing this.  I am someone who is constantly carrying unnecessary guilt.  Yet, no matter how much I tell myself that it is okay to do the things that I do, sometimes I cant convince myself of it.  When I saw the look in Pauls eyes after I told him that I stayed over at Ahmads apartment, I thought I was going to vomit in misery.  He looked crushed.  I explained that I didnt hook up with him, that there was no dick play.  He handled it well, but that look...    God, I hate hurting people.  Hate it hate it hate it!  So yesterday, as I am leaving my job, I see this incredibly attractive guy walking down the sidewalk toward me.  At first glance I knew he was straight, so there was no reason to scope him out.  However, as he approached me, he stared directly into my eyes and I did the same to him, even though I knew he was not sexually interested in me.  (and I dont know why notI mean, even straight guys like to stick their dicks into a random tight hole sometimes, right?)  As the guy and I passed each other, I saw him check me up and down and go Tisk.    I was like Tisk?  Tisk?!?!    Did this guy just give me the once over and then basically tell me that I wasnt even close to his league of hotness?  Thats exactly what it felt like.  Like I was inferior.  It was such a minor thing, but I have thought about that moment over and over and I wish I had said Tisk before he did.  Or I wish I whipped out my cock and slapped him in the mouth with it.  Dont tell ME Tisk.    Fucking Tisk.  A tisket a tasket I should have shit on his face.  Im dating a Muslim.  I love saying that to people.  There is this lady at work (keep in mind that I work for a Jewish agency) who is constantly eavesdropping on all of my personal phone conversations.  Yesterday, when I was talking to Mariah about the previous evenings adventures with Ahmad, she happened to be walking by my desk.  Well, when I got off the phone, she came over to me and said:  Co-worker:  Are you dating someone other than Paul? Me:  (GOD WHY DO YOU HAVE TO SPY ON ME ALWAYS!?!)  Actually, I did go out on a date last night.  How ever did you know? Co-worker:  I always know, Joe.  I pick up on these things. Me:  (sigh)  Yeah, you are SO intuitive. CW:  Sowhats he like? Me:  Hes handsome and a gentleman and successful and treated me like gold.  What else could I want? CW:  What did you guys do together? Me:  (Well I took him back to my place and proceeded to fuck the shit out of him.)  Well, we went to this classy French restaurant and then back to his place for conversation and some wine. CW:  Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh!  Was it romantic? Me:  Incredibly. CW:  I am so happy for you!! Me:  Thank you, me too.  You know, its weirdhe is the first Muslim guy I have ever met, much less dated. CW:  WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA????? Me:  whaaa? CW:  Hes Muslim?  I, uhoh neat. Me:  Yeah, it is pretty neat. CW:  Um, I(at this point I think she is pooping in her pants) what are you having for lunch? Me:  Probably something Muslim. CW:  AY YI YI!  Ok, so the last two lines never happened.  But wouldnt it be funny if it did?   Yeah.  Yeah it would have been.  Oh welltoo late to go back now and erase what I typed.  Computers just dont work that way.  Its now 3:38pm.  I cant wait to get out of here.  I want to curl up in a blanket and watch a movie.  Maybe make some popcorn, snuggle up close to a Muslim.  Yeahnow THAT sounds HOTT!  Rain, rain go away, cum in my face another day.

      Um.  Gosh, okay, how do I start this?  Things have happened.  Strange and spontaneous and wonderful things have happened.  Yesterday I sat here writing that I had no one to go out with.  I debated going out by myself and as the day wore on I realized that it is so not in my style to do such a thing.  As I said, I need my friends around to give me the confidence that I wouldnt have if I were on my own.  So, knowing this, I decided to email my friend Joanna to see what was going on with her.    About two weeks ago, Joanna and I went to a party that was incredibly fun.  We met some new people and flaunted ourselves around the scene.  In fact, I am pretty sure we owned the party since we had people coming up to us left and right.  We met these two gay guys there and to be honest, I dont even remember what their names were.  However, after the party, they told their friend, Ahmad, about me.  Supposedly they went on and on about how great and cool I was and that I would be perfect for him.  A compatible match.  A week or so after the party, Joanna mentioned to me that this Ahmad was interested in meeting me.  At the time, I kinda let it drop and didnt give it much thought.  So yesterday, when I didnt have any plans, I decided to ask Joanna about him.    With very little effort on my part, an email exchange began between Ahmad and myself.  I found him to be charming and polite and I even detected a sense of humor, which is always a plus.  After a few emails to each other, Ahmad and I decided to meet up for dinner.  After work, I rushed home, showered, had two glasses of wine and prepared for the first blind date I have ever had.  My friends told me that he was dark colored and that he was very successful in his line of work.  I have to admit I was pretty nervous about the whole dark thing as I have never actually dated a black or Latino guy before.  I decided I was up for anything as long as he turned out to be fun.    I showed up at the corner of 44th and Lexington around 7:30pm.  I waited for about 5 minutes and suddenly, out of nowhere, Ahmad showed up.  I was shocked!  I meanSHOCKED.  He looked so handsome and dashing.  He was wearing a very expensive looking pin stripe suit and he was carrying a briefcase.  We exchanged quick hellos and then went to a very nice French restaurant.  At dinner I was able to scope him out a bit better.  He has the most beautiful brown eyes and his skin is flawless.  Not a blemish anywhere.  Not like my pizza face.  Sike.  No one I know has pizza face.  I feel bad for pizza faces.  pizza face pizza face.  Ahmad is 27 years old and is about 510.  He says he weighs 175#, but I get the impression that he weighs a bit more than that.  He has big and strong arms and his shoulders are solid slabs of beef.  And we know that I like the beef.  He has a great chest he totally outclassed me with his suit and overall exterior.  I was incredibly nervous as we sat down to dinner.  I found myself stumbling on my words.  Sitting in front of me was a complete man and I have never felt so balanced by someone in my life.  He took incredible care of me.  He was polite and a gentleman and treated me like gold.  Without being overbearing, Ahmad gave me quite a few sweet and kind compliments.    During dinner, which I ate none of, Ahmad and I talked about numerous things, ranging from religion (hes Muslim, which I found incredibly intriguing) to jobs to family to our passions in life.  I opened up immediately to him and found myself detailing the struggles that I go through on a daily basis.  He listened to each and every word I said with interest.  He opened up to me as well; talking about the loss of his grandfather, the fact that his family doesnt know that he is gay, and about the fact that he has never truly been in love.  As dinner progressed, I found myself wanting to be in his arms, laying there, being held and protected.  After dinner, Ahmad and I went back to my apartment to smoke a bowl.  (yes he smokes pot, folks!  Hes a keeper!)  We blasted Monster Ballads (a collection of the best hair band songs from the early 90s) and sang along to it together.  At the end of To Be With You by Mr. Big, Ahmad asked if he could kiss me.  I said, please do and he stood up, put his hands on my waist, I wrapped my arms around his neck and he gave me the softest and most tender kiss I think I have ever received.  I get kind of shy in those situations, so I pulled away before it was necessary.  I enjoyed the kiss, but I couldnt stop thinking that I was cheating on my boyfriend.  The reason I thought this was because I loved everything that was happening.  I loved it too much.    Ahmad invited me to go back to his apartment in Queens.  He lives by himself and despite the fact that he still hasnt unpacked all of the boxes from his move, he wanted me there to talk to, to hold, to spend the night with.  I packed my overnight bag and we took a cab to his place.  Once in his apartment, I was blown away by the numerous pieces of art he had displayed on both the walls and his countertops.  He is definitely an aficionado of fine things.  The kid has worked hard to be where he is and I was proud that he wanted to share some of it with me.  We smoked another bowl and watched a bit of an old James Bond movie.  We discussed his future goals as well as mine and we kissed on and off throughout the rest of the evening.    At 2:30am, we both decided that it was time to go to bed.  I slept in his college gym shirt and a pair of my boxers.  He slept in just boxers.  He does not have a 6-pak and thank goodness, cuz I dont have one either and thats always an awkward moment.  If one guy has it, the other guy always feel like an ass.  I guess its a gay thing.  But looking at him half-naked, I began to sport the biggest hard on ever.  While not huge, he is solid and strong and totally man.  He asked if I wanted a massage and of course I said yes.  His hands were like iron.  Seriously this guy has the strength of a thousand men in those hands.  I melted completely.    I didnt have to do anything.  He paid for dinner, he hailed all of the cabs, he opened doors for me, he made sure I was happy at every moment.  And then did I ask him if he wanted a massage?  No, I just took mine and loved it.  hahaha.  But its nice to be treated like gold sometimes.  I fell asleep lying on his chest, his arm wrapped around my back.  It was kind of a rough sleep, new environment and all.  The last time I saw the clock, it was 3:30am.  We were up again at 7am.  Needless to say, I feel very worn out today.  On top of getting no sleep, I was completely swept off my feet by a man.  A MUSLIM man.  Who wouldve ever thought?    When I got out of bed this morning, I found that he had gotten up a little earlier and ironed my clothes along with his suit.  I mean, is this guy for real?  He irons my clothes??  Goshhe was pretty great.  I showered and got ready and we commuted together this morning.  As in typical gay style, he kissed me before we left his apartment so as not to get ourselves beat up on the way to work.  It was a long and sweet kiss.  To be honest, I am getting hard just thinking about it.  So thats that!  He has emailed me a couple of times this morning and it is pretty apparent that he is smitten.   I done good!  So we will wait and see.  I did tell him about Paul, but I explained it as though Paul and I were pretty much over.  Truth is, Paul and I are not over.  Not by a long shot.  Usually I would tell Paul about me going out and meeting other people.  But this time, Im going to hold it in for awhile.  It will just upset him and I dont see any reason to upset him unless it turns into something a lot more serious.  I was very well behaved last night.  I didnt hook up with him at all.  He simply kissed me a few times and treated me the way my current boyfriend should be treating me.    Im still very much in love with Paul.  But I am tired of having my heart broken daily.  I am tired of not feeling special and I am tired of being with someone who is more concerned about their job and their friends then they are with me.  I want a real man.  A real man takes care of his woman.  Or in this case, his gay.  Ahmad showed me an incredible time last night and I am still reeling from it.  I am very lucky to have met someone with such class and dignity; someone who, despite his intimidating financial status, is down to earth and real.    Man, what has happened?

      Ok, ok, okI am back.  SO SORRY TO HAVE SOME TIME TO MYSELF!  Sike, never.  I wasnt in work yesterday so I decided to take the day and do things that I like to do.  Unfortunately, that didnt involve being at the computer.  But alasnow I am back where I belong.  Sitting in front of a piece of shit PC, bored out of my mind, and literally counting the minutes until I can bust out of here at 5pm.  Damn my life.  And damn my vagina.  I hate being a hermie.    Hermie = hermaphrodite.   Hermaphrodite = sadness  SO!  Friday night!  Hmmmmmmmm..  After work on Friday, I jetted down to the SOHO area of NYC and met up with Mariah.  She took me shopping for some new pants.  I thought it best to make myself look as hot as possible, considering that I was going out to meet the man of my dreams.  After an hour and a half of trying on different styles and sizes, I finally found the pair of my fantasies.  Of course they were more money than I can afford, but at the same time, I needed them.  Both for aesthetic reasons, as well as confidence reasons.  None of these reasons need to be explained any further.   Theyre just reasons.  Kelly and I rocked out at my apartment until about 10pm and then we went over to SBNY, otherwise known as Splash Bar, otherwise known as the place of all hotness.  Since we got there pretty early, we sat at a table near the bar and talked for awhile.  3 vodka tonics later, and with my groove on, we went upstairs to do some dancing.  Unfortunately, the crowd was a mix of the ugliest people I have seen in a very long time.  Now, I have no problem with ugly people at all.  In fact, I really like ugly people.  They usually possess extremely witty senses of humor.  (wow that came across so smarmy)(ehappropriately smarmy)  Kelly and I danced for about 10 minutes as I checked out the scene.  To be frank, the scene consisted of losers and whores and I was really not interested in anyone.  Kelly and I debated giving up and leaving.  I was a bit crushed as I had my heart set on meeting the man of my dreams.  Or at least the man of my evening.  No such luck.    Before heading out, Kelly and I decided to get one more drink at the bar.  We made our way through the crowd, pinching, clawing, and biting when necessary.  Finally, we reached our destination and that is when I met HIM.  THE man of the night.   Thom.  WowThom.  His beauty was absolutely stunning.  He had a very masculine face and a body like I have never seen up close.  Im talking cuts, and ridges, and valleys of muscle that I didnt know really existed.  He had dark blondish hair, was at least 61 and weighed in at an estimated 210#.  My kinda man!  So, Kelly starts to talk to the bartender and he eats her up right away.  They were talking and laughing and making everything totally comfortable for me.  Kelly is really good at hooking me up with the men.  Every guy I have dated has gone through Kelly in some way.    Thom and I talked for a couple of minutes and he served us our drinks.  Kelly and I chilled at the bar and watched Thom run around and do his thing.  Eventually he came back over to us and offered us some shots.  We took them with him and he kept smiling and winking at me.  When we had another moment together, this is the conversation we had:  Thom:  So, are you from NYC?   Me:  Yes.  I live in Midtown right now. Thom:  What do you do for a living? Me:  I work for a university and am kind of like a glorified RA.  Its a fine job, but I am actually here to be an actor.  One of the million. (Thom bursts out laughing and points to a tatoo on his right shoulder.  I take a closer look and see that he has the dramatic mask symbols emblazoned on his massive shoulder.)   (I smile back at him and continue to bat my eyes and try to look as cool as possible.) Thom:  Do you come to this bar a lot? Me:  Not nearly enough.  This is where most of the hot guys go, so when I am in the mood, I try to sneak on over and catch whats going on. Thom:  What do you think of the crowd tonight? Me:  Honestly, is there another night I should be coming here?  Cuz most of the guys here tonight are busted.  I dont see one potential guy in the whole room. Thom:  Really??  Well tonight is the night that you would want to come here.  You dont see anyone that you like?  Anyone at all? Me:  Well, from what I can see, the only guy I want to talk to is you.  And I know better than to get mixed up with a bartender.   Thom:  (laughs) Oh yeah?  Why is that? Me:  (laughing as well) Why do you think?  Come on man, no guy should ever spend his time at a bar falling for the bartender.  It is a waste of effort.   Thom:  Its not necessarily a waste tonight.  I think you are really cute.  Probably one of the cutest guys in the place.  So stick around a bit longer.   Me:  Cool.  I will.  Kelly and I talk and I explain to her that, although against my better judgement, I am falling quickly for Thom, the bartender.  She is excited for me, but also reminds me of the No bartender rule.  I agree with her and we decide that we want to leave pretty soon.  Thom:  Did you guys want another shot?   (I glance at Kelly and she seems willing) Me:  Sure.  What are we having?   Thom:  Its up to you.  Whatever you want. Me:  (beginning to panicwhats the cool shot to have??)  UmMaybeI dont(wellI suckand I have NO PERSONALITY!) Kelly:  Why dont you make us your specialty shot? Thom:  Cool.  Will do.   Me:  Kelly, thank you for saving my ass.  Eventually Thom returns with our shots.  We all clink glasses and down em.   Thom and Kelly talk for awhile and he asks her some questions about me.  I was definitely peaking his interest.  My stomach was tossing and turning with anticipatory excitement.  This guy was fucking BEEYOOTIFULL.  Eventually they turned their attention back to me.  Without going into even more unnecessary detailThom offered to give me his number, but I gave him mine instead.  We talked for about another half-hour or so.  He put his hand on my face numerous times and leaned in and kissed me twice.  It was simple, yet sweet, and my god, the boner I was sporting was fucking huge.  My hand barely covered the rock bicep of his upper arm.  I wanted him and badly  Eventually Kelly and I had to leave.  Thom asked if I would be coming back the next night and I told him no.  I started to want to marry him and Kelly had to drag me out of the bar.  He mentioned to her that he thought I worried too much about everything.  I guess I was being a bit overbearing toward the end.  Its just that I wanted to set a wedding date before I left that night.  I mean, I knew that he was the man of my dreams and I didnt want him to bail on the details of our big event.  You know how it goes.  Guys never want to help plan the celebration.  When we got outside, I begged Kelly to let me go back in and talk to him one more time.  She said never and I am so glad she did.  Rita always said that I have no game and she is right.  When I get drunk and fall in love with a guy, it is almost impossible to pull me away from them.  No.  Thats an understatement.  It IS impossible.  I went home with Kelly and we had a good rest of our evening.  I couldnt stop talking about Thom.  He was so beautiful and funny and sweet and exactly the kind of man, that after one night of knowing, I wanted to be with.  Gosh.  Saturday, Thom didnt call and I felt fine about it.  I mean, he didnt like me as much as I liked him.  Or once againnever go for the bartender.  On Sunday, Kelly and I went to see  X MEN 2 .  It was fucking awesome.  Then, that night, Kelly went out to a dyke bar with a bunch of friends.  Around 11:30pm, the phone rang and I thought it was Paul telling me what time he was coming over.  I picked it up and heard a strange voice on the other end.   Me:  Hello? Strange voice:  Is this Joe? Me:  Yes it is.  Paul? Strange voice:  Hahaha.  No, its Thom.  Do you have a lot of different guys calling you? Me:  (FREAKING OUT!)  Uh, yeahyou know.  You were Friday night, Paul is tonight.   Thom:  Hahaha.  Well, I was wondering if you wanted to go out tonight.  Maybe get a drink together? Me:  I would love to.  Thanks for calling and asking.  Unfortunately, I have to work in the morning and I am just about to crash for the evening.  (Now I was pissed that Paul was on his way over) Thom:  Well thats too bad.  Maybe another time then? Me:  Definitely another time.  Let me know. Thom:  Will do. Enjoy your rest.   Me:  Thanks Thom.  Talk to you soon.  And that was it!  Um!  He actually called!  Damn!  I must be like the hottest ticket in town!  I get a bartender to call ME!?!?  Sweet.  That made me feel fucking excellent.  I hope he calls again.  Thom is definitely someone I would love to run my tongue down.  Did I mention that he is 34?  Well, yeah.  Hes 34.  So he is really only interested in me for sex, but that works fine for me.  I will make that decision if it ever comes down to it.  But what a high I am on!!!    I want so badly to go tonight too, but everyone is working.  I am debating going by myself, but thats risky.  Paul and Mariah go out by themselves sometimes, but its just not my style.  I need to have that friend in the corner that I can turn and run to if things get hairy.  But then again, do I want to pass up a night meeting hot guys at Beige?  Hmmm.I dont know yet.  The weather outside is beautiful and I feel great!  I want to enjoy it as much as possible.  And Paul, well Paul  Paul is great right now.  We are getting along well and we are being very open and honest about the demise of our relationship.  Not that it is over or anythinghe just needs time to figure things out.  He wants me to go out and have some fun and I am not about to sit around and wait for him any longer.  If you know someone who is really great, gay, and overly masculine, send them my way.  I am so ready to meet and get to know new guys.    Its about fucking time.

      FRIDAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!  YEAH!  So excited about tonight.  I am leaving immediately after work to go buy myself a new pair of pants and a shirt for tonights escapades into the city.  Kelly and I have plans to go out to one Lesbian bar and one gay bar.  We are both hoping to do it up to the extreme.  I want to be WANTED tonight.  I want guys all over me.  I want drinks bought for me.  I want to DANCE and I want to be kissed.  Oh MAN I want so many things.  I will not go home until all that I set out to accomplish is completed.  Who knows?  Maybe I will even bring someone home. (gasp!)  Paul says that he is going to stay at my apartment tonight to make sure that I dont bring anyone home.  Funny, cuz he NEVER has EVER once stayed at my house on a Friday night.  Hes just too tired.  If he shows up tonight just to bust up my plans, he will be surprised when I make HIM leave and tell my boyfriend of the evening to stay.    In all honesty, I probably wont bring anyone home.  But I love knowing that I could.  Its like I forgot I could for so long.  But nownow I feel strong and ready.  I have had a great week and I want it to end with a BANG!   Bang = cum lovin.    sike.  sorta sike!  Last nights viewing of  Urban Cowboy  was just about the MOST fun.  The boys were beautiful, the dancing was ON POINT, and the experience was totally memorable.  The show wasnt my most favorite of all time, but it was good.  I am not a big country music fan and you would have to be to really get into the score.  I thought the leads were a bit weak, but the chorus was so good that I found myself watching them even when the main characters were on stage.  Overall, I feel so lucky to have been there.  I had a blast.  I wish I could have nights like last night every week.  I felt so high profile with my comp tickets.  Gosh, it was great.  Paul and Mariah had a blast too.  And did I mention that the guys were HOT?!?!?!  SO HOT.  Cowboys are fucking sexy.  They pack themselves into denim in a way that I have never seen on a city boy.  I saw (and loved) each and every cock package I saw.  The bodies on these boyswho hoooooooo!  Thank you Kambri Crews.  Thank you thank you thank you and oh yeah thank you.    Time for the   Filthy Friday Five !   Have you ever attempted, even once, to perform oral sex on yourself?   Yes of course.  I swung my legs up and over my stomach and I tried in vain to stick that cock of mine in my mouth.  It was very unsuccessful and I managed to do nothing but give myself horrible muscle cramps in my chest.  Its not like I have a small dick or anything.  It just wouldnt reach my slurping lips.  Ok, sick.  Magine I swallowed my OWN cum when I said I wouldnt even swallow my boyfriends?  sick again.   Tell us about your best sexual experience to date.   My best sexual experience was with a guy named Berry.  Yeah, his name totally sucks, but his body and his sex appeal was fucking off the hook.  He was the quarterback of his high school football team and he did some time in the military.  He had red hair (the bad kind), but he was still so HOT!  He and I hooked up off and on for a couple of years.  (whenever I would visit  home (Albany) during college breaks.)  One time, I met up with him at our local gay club and he and I immediately fell into each others arms.  I didnt want to go back to his place after the club, but I wanted his dick in my mouth more than anything I had ever wanted in my mouth previous.  He took me out to his land rover, which was sitting in our local park, and we climbed into the back seat.  I sat on his lap while he kissed me and ran his hands all over my body for a very long time.  Eventually I couldnt take it anymore.  I ripped his shirt off, exposing his amazing pecs and arms.  I licked every inch of him and then worked my way down to his huge erection.  To date, Berry had the most incredible dick I have ever been lucky enough to suck.  Big and strong and virtually hair free.  I sucked and sucked and sucked and he begged to suck me.  I let him for like 5 minutes, but I really just wanted to finish him.  (I had to get back to my friends at the club afterall)  Eventually he finished and yes I did swallow that load.  He, unlike most of the men I have been with, was deserving.  So I drank it down.  He held me with one arm around my back and the other exploring the rest of my body.  I jerked off for a bit more and blew my load right onto that beautiful chest of his.  I then cleaned up and went back to the club.  I masturbated to that experience for the next couple of months.  Berry was beautiful and if I had the chance to do it again, I would.    What physical characteristic turns you on more than anything in bed?    More than anything, I love big, strong arms.  I love a guy who has biceps on him.  I love to feel them, squeeze them, lick them, and have always wanted to put my dick in the elbow crevice of a bicep and forearm.  Ever fucked an arm before?  Probably not.  But I imagine it would be so amazing.  MMMMMMMMMM.maybe I can do THAT with someone tonight.     Body hair: what's your take on it, both your own or on your partner?   I am down the middle on this one.  I like smooth or with a light trickle of hair.  Too much of it grosses me out.  And never back hair.  But a nice, ripped up body, with a trickling of black chest hairoof DAH!  That is the stuff.  Very manly and very sexy.     The scent of love: does your partner's own particular "funk" turn you on or off? What do you like to smell in the sack?   I LOVE the smell of cologne.  If a guy has a nice fresh smelling cologne on (none of that old spice shit) I am immediately smitten.  I love to breathe it in deep while we kiss.  I love to suck on a nice neck that smells GOOD.  I can also get down with the smell of fresh gym workout.  Meaningsweat.  Manly sweat gets my cock hard in two seconds flat.  I guess I have somewhat of an armpit fetish.  But it has to be the right guy.  I wouldnt stick my face into the pit of someone nasty.  That would make my fetish turn into a nightmare.  As far as cum or sex smell is concernedit (yet again) depends on the guy.  Certain peoples funk is a turn on cuz it smells raw and animalistic.  But some funk smells sour and that makes me gag and spew out bile.  I guess I will have to let you all know after tonight.    HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  Can you tell that Im excited!?    ROCK!    I hope everyone has the kind of night that I hope to have.  Heres to all of us horny people!   I love how the filthy five is always on Friday.  Gets me pumped up and ready for a night out in the clubs.    Be safe everyone.    Lets make this a good one!

      I so need a new format for this site.  I want a new template so badly.  Everywhere I go, everyone has the same template as me and when I return to my own site, I want to puke all over it.  I am so bored with it.  It might be time for a change.  As with the human body, the body of a journal should evolve as well.  Body BODY body.  Body. Fucking body.  Now I hate the word body.  Bodybodybodybodybodybodybodybodybodybody.  Not YOU hate the word body.  Body.  After work yesterday, I ran over to meet up with Miss  urlLink Kambri Crews  to pick up the tickets for  Urban Cowboy .  When she came out of the elevator to greet me, my jaw hit the floor.  I forgot what an absolute KNOCKOUT she is.  My god!  Seriously, I gagged on myself in pure intimidation.  And why is it that she is so incredibly sweet and wonderful?  Total package my friends.  Totally total package.  The tickets she gave me are in the orchestra!  I immediately went home and looked up the seats on the  Urban Cowboy  website and was shocked to find out where I am sitting.  I tugged on my penis in pure joy.  When Paul arrived at my pad, I explained that I had a surprise for him.  He was like Oh great, cuz every surprise I give him is pretty lame.  Sometimes its a candy bar, sometimes its a coupon for free french fries at Burger King, sometimes its a whack in the nuts.  So when I pulled out the tickets to the show, he looked at me in pure shock.    But how Joe?  HOW?  How did you get these?  Did you buy them for us? No Paul.  I got them through my online journal.  This really nice girl who works for the show was giving them out and I jumped at the chance. Holy shit thats great! I KNOW! And you hated my journal up until now. No, I still hate it. Oh.  Cool.  After giving him the surprise tickets, I took us out to dinner at this place called  DinerBar  in Spanish Harlem.  Paul peed in his pants from fear when he saw the neighborhood that the restaurant was in.  I told him to walk fast and make no eye contact.  Instead, he rips a huge fart in front of a group of ghetto dwellers.  They immediately turned in our direction and I just picked up my pace, praying that we wouldnt hear them call out to us.  Luckily they didnt.    The food at the restaurant was fucking amazing.  Paul enjoyed himself thoroughly.  We ordered two entrees as appetizers and then we ordered two entrees as entrees.  The waitress looks me directly in the eye and says Are you SERIOUS?  I look her back in the eye and go Have you ever seen the face of serious?  Cuz this is definitely it.  I think she got the point.  One of our appetizers was their homemade macaroni and cheese with chicken cutlets in it.  um!?!  YUM!  It is just about the best thing I have ever put in my mouth.  Or rubbed on my chest for that matter.  I could have bathed in it all night long.    When we were eating our entre entrees, the chef walked over to us and in a VERY loud voice says: I need to meet the two gentlemen that are eating me out of house and home.  I am VERY impressed with you two for eating all of this food.  Ive never seen anything like it.  Are you going to finish it all?  At this point everyone in the restaurant is staring at us.  I reply No, actually I am getting pretty full now.  Im going to have to take it home, I think.  (I glance around at the rest of the customers and kind of half smile)(They stare blankly back at me)  The chef responds Then youre a pussy!    My jaw hits the floor.   A pussy? um..A pussy?  I lower my head in pussy shame and Paul responds Im going to finish mine.  Dont you worry! I secretly kick Paul under the table while giving him and the staring crowd my most impressed and supportive look.  My boyfriends a fat hoss!  I am so proud!  But at least hes not a pussy.  A FUCKING PUSSY?  Come on now.   As we ate our dinner, we discussed our relationship problems a bit further.  He was surprisingly supportive during our talk and was very open to suggestions as to how to improve our current situation.  I explained again that I have a strong desire to go out and meet other guys, especially since he wont be physical with me.  He told me that while it hurts him to know that I am going to meet other men, its only fair that I be allowed to do what I want to do.  He asked me to not hook up with anyone that wasnt a bodybuilder.  He understands that I want to be with a man like this at some point in my life and he respects that.  He would not, however, respect me hooking up with just any guy off the street.  Im down with that.  I dont want to hook up with any guy off the street.  I want to hook up with BIG.  Thaz it.    Paul agreed to work on himself a bit more.  He agreed to try and take a step back before judging me and my life.  He agreed to delve deeper into himself to figure out what the problem is with him and sex.  He also agreed to be more available to me and to not be as unnecessarily cruel as he has been over the last few months.  He was a sweetheart last night and for the first time in a while I wanted to be with him and only him.  The one thing I love about mine and Pauls relationship is that it is based on honesty.  There is no fear about holding anything back to spare each others feelings.  There is no worry that one person will secretly cheat on the other.  We are very vocal about what we want.  We may fight a lot, but ultimately, everything gets said and then put to rest.  I am very lucky to have him during this whole growing process.  Its hard to be 25 years old and in a committed 3 and a half year relationship.  Its hard for both of us for different reasons.  But I never worry that we wont do what is right for us, whether that means staying together or breaking up.  Our relationship is a job that we are both committed to seeing all the way through.   A couple of weeks ago, I took some seeds out of my bag and put them in two of Pauls plants.    Now, if you dont know drug lingo, let me translate that for you:  A couple of weeks ago, I took some marijuana seeds out of my marijuana stash and put them in two of Pauls plants.    Ok, that translation was totally unnecessary.   Pennyhow, I didnt (lol pennyhow) tell Paul that I had put the seeds in there, thinking that nothing would happen anyway.  Well, since Paul is Scientist/Gardener extraordinaire, the seeds have grown immensely.  At first he was pissed that I just stuck old nasty Mary seeds in his beautiful Armarillas.  But when I promised to take care of them on my own and to transplant them into a new pot, he agreed to go along with the process.   The day I met Paul, he was getting ready to go to court for having been busted with growing Marijuana plants.  He was having a party and the cops broke it up and found him growing four plants in his closet.  They had just bloomed too.  Getting Marijuana plants to actually bud (the bud is the part you can smoke) is like impossible, but Paul did it.  Gosh, he makes me so proud.    So my seeds are growing and fast!  They are already 6 inches tall!  They are pretty weak and Paul thinks they will die soon.  He says that they definitely wont bud, but they may spawn better seeds.  So we will see.  But how fun!  My own little illegal project.  I love myself.  YAY off to Broadway tonight.  Two shows in one week.  I am a SUPERSTAR.   But without the smelly pits.   Bodybodybodybodybodybodybodybodybodybodybodybodybodybodybodybodybodybody Bodybodybobodybananafannafofadi.  I had a friend named fadi once.    Ok, Im done.

      Spring has spa-RUNG dawgs!  Wow.  I know its only been 24 hours since my last post, but what a day it has been!    So, last night was fucking amazing.  I mean, last night was fucking HOO RAH amazing.  It was the perfect start to a summer of gayness.    Heres what I like to call The Deelio:   Kelly and I showed up at Beige around 10:30pm.  We immediately secured ourselves a spot at the bar, which is an incredible feat in itself.  We werent there for more than 10 minutes before the bar tender comes over and says, A friend of yours has bought you a drink.  I turn to Kelly and say, Wellity, wellity, wellitylooks like we are going to have a very lucrative evening!  I then go to check in my coat at theumwellyeah the coat check.  My turn comes in line and I realize that I went over there without any money.  (Why do I embarrass myself at every possible occasion?)  As I turn to walk back to my spot at the bar, I notice that Paul is talking to Kelly.  He is with a girl I have never met, named Dierdra.  I give him a quick peck on the cheek and turn to Kelly.  Fuck Kelly!  Paul is here and we just got our drinks bought by a potentially hot guy.  Kelly smiles and says, I know!  Cept the potentially hot guy that bought the drinks is Paul.  Nooooooooooooooooo! I respond.  And I thought that I was a stud or something.    My friend Will showed up a couple minutes later and we all hung out for awhile.  Now, I dont know if its the new pomade I am using or what, but I was getting more attention than the alcohol was.  The boys were all over my shit.  But the worst part about it was that I couldnt enjoy any of it cuz Paul was standing next to me the entire time.  At one point, he and I went to the bathroom and this guy in line (who was ba ba ba BUILT) was checking me out.  When Paul entered the bathroom before me, I hung back and said hi to him.  He smiled and we made polite conversation before I had to take my piss.  I know that I could have had his number in two seconds flat if I was alone.  Suddenly Paul comes out of the bathroom, walks right over to my new boyfriend and me and says, Hes taken.  He then put his arm around my shoulder and pushed me into the bathroom.  Paul had every right to do that had he not already pissed me off by treating me as his property all night.    He had his hands down my pants all evening.  He kept putting his left hand in the back of my pants and kind of playing around in there.  I asked him to stop and he refused to comply.  Eventually I pulled his hand out, informed him that I am not his property and changed my place in our circle.  He got offended and asked me what the problem was.  The problem, Paul, is that you wont even kiss me when we are alone.  Yet you see me getting all of this attention and now you realize what youve got.  You have your hands all over me only because you know I am going to meet someone else tonight.   Do you want to meet someone else tonight?  Paul asks. I WANT my boyfriend to make love to me and to treat me like a human being.  But since that doesnt seem to be sinking in to you, I am definitely going to do my best to meet someone else and get my sorry ass some physical affection.   Then you would be cheating on me.  And I wont stand for that. Yes I AM going to cheat on you and you dont have to stand for that.  I am tired of this shit with you.  I am a 25 year old guy that is very capable of meeting other attractive people. Joe, you are MY boyfriend. Paulact like it then.  Otherwise deal with the repercussions of being a neglectful boyfriend.  I am not going to wait around for you to improve yourself in this relationship anymore.  Either fix it or let me go.  After that brief yet poignant conversation, Paul and I hung out for a bit more before making the trek home.  I decided to stay at his place since he lives right around the corner from Beige.  On the way home we began to debate our relationship again.    Joe, you are not going to cheat on me.  Im serious. Paul, figure out why you havent touched me in the last 4 months or yes I AM going to cheat on you.  If you cant handle that, then break up with me.  I am in love with you and am not going to break up with you, but I refuse to deal with this shit any longer.  I am absolutely exhausted by it. If I wasnt at the bar tonight, would you have met someone else? I think its very apparent by the attention I got tonight that I would have met somebody else.  Paul, you dont own me and Im tired of having low self-esteem because of you.  You are slowly destroying every bit of confidence that I have worked so hard to build. I have not.  You have destroyed it yourself.  You think you control this relationship.  You think you make every decision regardless of how I feel. Then make the decision to let me go.  If you dont want to be with me, then LET ME GO.  At this point we began screaming at each other.  We called each other every name in the book and our voices woke everybody in the apartment building.    Finally we calmed down.    I am not doing this with you anymore Paul.  Im not.  Either fix your shit or get out of this relationship.  I know you moved to NYC for me.  You have rubbed my face in it time and time again.  But I am tired of living in a dead end relationship.  I am tired of you not acting as though I am a priority.  Basically, you have destroyed me. You have destroyed me too.  You have torn me down, you have made me feel ugly, you have hurt me irreparably. Then we need to break up Paul.  Who cares about the Bahamas vacation?  Who cares about the plans for Memorial Day?  Who cares about anything right now except for us being happy?  And if being happy means that we have to be away from each other, then that is what we should do. Do you want to just be friends for awhile? Paul, we will never be friends.  I have never been friends with anyone that I have dated and I have no plans to start with you.  If you wont put in the effort to fix this relationship, then I have nothing else to say to you.  You have broken my heart time and time again and I dont think that I want a friend like that. Thats fucked up Joe!  You are saying that you will never speak to me again? That is exactly what I am saying.  You dont have any more chances Paul.  I am warning you now.  Fix this or let me go. Fine.  Lets get something to eat and go to bed.  And thats what we did.  We ate and went to bed.  He did his best at kissing up to me and I wasnt having it.  I didnt speak for the rest of the evening and I went to bed facing the wall.  As we all know, I have had just about enough of Pauls shit.  I know he loves me, but I cant hold his hand anymore.  Its not fair to me.    He held me all night long and when I woke up, he leaned over and kissed me.  It was nice and it started my day off on a very positive note.  If Paul puts in the effort, so will I.  But I am going out on Friday night and I am planning on doing it up the way I want to do it up.  I dont have a boyfriend on Friday night.  I will be open and honest with Paul about everything that happens, but I will not hold myself back any longer.  I see no reason to stick this out with him if he wont work at improving himself.  We will see what happenswe will see if he can turn it around.  Overall I did have a wonderful time last night.  I love Beige.  Its just about my favorite.  The guys are fucking HOT(!) and they have a patio out back that is crowded with smokers.  It is hella great.  Also, one other thing has happened today that is absolutely terrific!  Ari alerted me this morning to news that   urlLink Kambri Crews  was giving out free tickets to see  Urban Cowboy .  I wrote her an email and lo and behold, Paul and I will be going to see the show tomorrow night for free!!!!!  I cant believe it!  He and I have been talking about the show for months and now we get the chance to actually see it.  The guys in it are supposed to be HOT HOT HOT!  Kelly and I were talking about the show last night.  She went to a big, expensive dinner on Monday too and saw a bunch of numbers from various Broadway musicals.  She loved  Urban Cowboy  and couldnt stop talking about it.  YAYAYAYAYAYAY!  Paul is going to be so excited tonight when I tell him the news.    Its my turn to take us out to dinner, so I have picked an incredible diner in Spanish Harlem.  He will complain that its just a lowly diner as opposed to a five star restaurant, but once he tastes the food, he is sure to jizz all over the counter.  We are supposed to talk about our relationship tonight.  Imagine he breaks up with me and then I tell him Too bad, cuz you could have seen  Urban Cowboy  for free!    I hope things work out with us.  I really do.    But I am thru begging and pleading with him.  Its time for hard ball.  Shape up or ship the fuck out.

      Wellity, wellity, wellity  The dinner sucked my nuts.  I hate smarmy people who have lots of money and dont give a shit about anyone, but themselves.  I hate people who think that they are higher class then me and in turn act like it at every opportunity.  I hate people who shove into me and knock me to the side as though they dont even notice me standing there.  Our annual dinner was full of people who have more money than class.  And for that, I drank my free wine and bolted before they even served the main course.  Fucking assholes.    Some day, when I have lots of money, I am going to make sure that I am nothing but sweet and INTERESTED in WHO other people are, regardless of their ethnicity, culture, or economical status.  I am going to introduce myself to people that seem like they have something to say.  I am never going to stand around and silently judge everyone else.  I am fond of having a big and sensitive heart and I am not going to let the amount of money I have get in the way of my kindness.  I am not going to be condescending and rude in order to make myself feel more important.  I will rely on my own achievements to exemplify my character.  I am not going to treat other people the way that I hate being treated.  Take your chicken dinner and shove it up your ass.  I think the moment that pissed me off the most was when one of my own co-workers snubbed me at the reception.  I walked up to her to congratulate her on a job well done and in the middle of my compliment, she turned her back to me and walked away.  Its not as though she had someone or somewhere to walk to either.  She just walked away.  GOD.  In the real world, this woman would get her face beat in.  She is a leach, always trying to tag along with people who matter in order to make herself look and feel important.  But when you have Rosacea on your face and you wear a read suitlets just say that its best that you dont snub anyone, especially those that help you out (on a daily basis) in the workplace.  Doris, you suck my dick.  I dont know why I had such a problem with last night.  During the event I remained very positive, laughing with Ari and a few others, joking about how I possess no class when I go to galas of any kind.  I paid little to no attention to those around me and shoved my face with as many hor'doerves as possible.  But when it came time for the main course, I found myself looking around at a room of people that could have cared less whether I showed up or not.  I found myself supporting something that was based soley on financial status.  And I didnt like it one bit.  I turned to Ari and told her I was leaving.  I was bored and I was annoyed.  I cant stand rich people who dont have an ounce of respect inside their fickle bodies.    I have had rich friends before and I have never felt as though I am any less of a person for the amount of money or social status I possess.  Frankly, I feel better being who I am because I know I am real and that what comes out of my mouth is based on kindness and honesty.  I dont use people to my advantage and I dont disrespect people because of who they are.  My friends have always been the same way.  But as I saw last night, it is a very naive world that I am living in.  A world where celebrities and politicians are king.  Those of you who are anything less better have a million dollars in your bank account or dont even bother trying to open your mouth.  You clearly have nothing interesting to say.    All in all I am glad that I went.  I did get to eat some wonderful sushi and I downed at least 5 glasses of wine.  The waiters were incredibly cute and I found myself trying to make eye contact and conversation with them at every moment.  My boss paid for my cab home and Ari and I smoked a bowl before the whole thing went down.  So there were good moments.  Its just that these moments were overshadowed by a room filled with a bunch of smarmy smarms.    Tonight I am off to Beige, one of the cities most respected gay bars.  Brittany Spears and J. Timberlake have been known to frequent this place.  But tonight I am going to have a drink with people who are in my league.  I am going to scope out the other boys and be judged purely on my looks alone.  That I can handle.  My goal is to get at least one drink bought for me.  Last time I was there, the fashion editor for  Allure  gave me his number.  That was cool.  Cept I dont DO fashion editors.  I do sports editors.  You understand.     I feel so much better having bitched and moaned about all of the ridiculousness in the world.  Now its time to go be with people just like me.    Ahhhit feels good to go back to the real world.   BTWthe pants I wore fit perfectly.  I worry for nothing.   SLURP!

       MAMMA MIA!   MAMMA MIA! MAMMA MIA LET ME GO!   I saw  Mamma Mia  this weekend in the Winter Garden Theater.  Same place that  Cats  used to be in.  I must say, this show was just about the best thing I have seen in forever.  The music is absolutely wonderful and the show, itself, proves to be the most uplifting and upbeat piece of theater out there.  During a time when most of us cant seem to put a smile on our face,  Mamma Mia  shows up and allows you to laugh and more importantly, be comfortable in laughing.  I dont want to go into too much detail about the performance because everyone should have a chance to see it firsthand.  But if you are looking for a way to cheer yourself up or to end a bad week on a really good note, this show is the way to go.  Gosh, I just loved it.  (my mom bought me the soundtrack as soon as we left the theater)(Im such a queen sometimes)  Had an absolutely incredible weekend.  Went to a house party, a club, a Broadway Show, a famous restaurant for lunch, and basically had a smile on my face the whole time.  Being able to see my mother on Saturday made my entire weekend.  I rarely get to see her on Mothers Day, but this year, I spent it with both my granny and my mom.  Well, my dad was there too, but hes not special until mid-June.    My granny is getting super old.  On the outside she looks great, totally healthy and vibrant.  Shes deaf-ish, but has been that way for as long as I can remember.  But on this visit, I noticed that she was having a really difficult time walking.  Im talking so difficult - that because of her foot pain, she wasnt able to see my apartment.  Too many flights of stairs.  It took us about a half an hour to walk four blocks.  She was very positive during the entire trip, but at the same time I could tell that she was in pedestrian anguish.  When we got to the theater, we quickly took our seats and my dad double checked to make sure that we were all in the appropriate places.  I glanced at the seat numbers and assured him that we were.  As the show is about ready to start, these two assholes show up and accuse us of sitting in their seats.  My mom whips out our tickets and my granny starts in on my father about how he should have checked the seat numbers.  The three of them stand up and the usher comes over to explain that we cant just move over one seat.  She wanted to see the tickets and since the show was just about to start, she was very aggressive and obnoxious.    My dad hands the usher bitch the tickets and while she is glancing them over, the couple starts complaining that they want to sit and look at the playbill before the show starts.  This is turning into the biggest hassle, the woman said.  Then dont show up 34 seconds before the show starts you fucking asshole!  Anywaysas the chaos peaks, my dad yells out in the middle of the Broadway Theater I dont know where the hell you want us to sit, but make a choice and stick with it!  Everyone in front of us turns around and glares at my father.  I immediately bury my head in my hands and feel the embarrassment cover my face.  There is murmuring in the crowd as to who the crazy man is in the back.  I stand up, move over one seat, and tell my family to shut the fuck up.  Just ignore these assholes.  Its not your fault, I say to my father.  Finally it all got straightened out and when my dad and I were having a cigarette during intermission, I gave him a hug and told him that I was sorry that I had gotten the seat numbers wrong.  He wasnt angry with mejust frustrated with three women bitching in his ear.  Fortunately the second act started without a hitch.  snores.  Tonight, my office is throwing their biggest event of the year.  Its an annual dinner that we hope will raise close to 2 million dollas!  Basically the entire thing is fucking boresville, but there will be free champagne by the gallons and a free dinner as well.  I plan to leave as soon as my plate is clean and right before the speeches start.  I figure that I can be at Pauls apartment before  Mr. Personality  starts.  Yes, you read that correctly.  I am bowing out of a million-dollar dinner before the speeches so that I can rush home to watch the lamest show on the planet.  Dont judge me.  Dont EVER judge me.    So Joanna and I went to a house party this weekend.  Well, more like an apartment party.  At first I was very skeptical of us going, cuz I hadnt met anyone there before and Joanna and I are still new-ish friends.  Butturns out that the party was AMAZING and I had the best time ever.  The people were all doctors and lawyers and straight straight straight.  So, as soon as I was done schmoozing and realizing that there was no chance of me ever landing myself a surgeon, we phoned up Mariah and took off for some gay fun.  Gay it was.  Well, that is if gay means fucking lame.  Mariah and I hated the club we went to, so instead we went in and out of bars all over Times Square and then set off on a trek to find a 24-hour McDonalds.  No such luck, but after wandering around for 45 minutes, I realized that earlier that day I had created my own special version of homemade macaroni and cheese.  It was so fucking bomb that Mariah and I ate the entire batch in a matter of 6 minutes.  I mean, we ATE and ATE and ATE.  And then we fell asleep on my couch.  But not before blaring Debbie Gibsons  Electric Youth  album at speaker breaking volumes.  It was the funnest.    Fuck you for thinking that I really use the word funnest..   Fuck you man. Yeah. yeah.  Just found out that there may be a donor giving us a 3 million-dollar gift tonight at our dinner.  UM!  That is so good for so many reasons.  Most importantly being that raise time is coming in July and I am so in need of some cold hard cash.  If the gift is announced at the dinner, there is no way that my boss can tell me that there is no money left for a substantial raise.  heh heh heh!  Oh please let us get this money  I am wearing a suit jacket and tie tonight.  Kind of excited about that.  I never get to dress up.  The only thing is that the pants I am wearing are getting pretty tight.  I was sure that I wouldnt fit into them this morning, cuz a month ago, I couldnt.  But when I tried them on this morning, guess who looked fucking fly in their slacks?!?  Well, not me, but I was still able to get the button shut.  When I told my parents that I might not be able to wear my nicest slacks cuz of fatness, they burst out laughing and explained that I shouldnt have grown out of my pants at the age of 25.  But Im not fat!, I exclaimed.  Then you should be able to fit into your slacks, my mom said.  Oh, then Im fat, I added.  Cept I do in fact (in fat) fit into them now, so rock!   Its pretty disconcerting to grow out of clothes.  Especially when summer is right around the corner and I want to be able to show off my hotness at the beach.  Yeah right, like I ever go to the beach to show off hotness.  I go for the hot dogs and burgers!  Cuz Im fat!  All righttime to go beat one in the bathroom.  Hope I dont get caught this time

      Work is too busy today to talk about much.    In which case, I will only be doing the FRIDAY FILTHY FIVE!  Im loving this shit.  It gives me a chance to put my brain to rest and let my innards do the talking.      Have you ever experienced female ejaculation, either as a participant or an observer?   Not personally.  Well, maybe.  One time I fingered this girl and all this wetness came out, but I dont know if that counts.  HOWEVER, Kelly and I rented this movie once called The Art of the Extended Orgasm.  In it, one woman lies on her back while another woman (wearing surgical gloves) manipulates her clit to the point of ejaculation.  But to Kelly and my shock, the womans ejaculation wasnt just cream.  It was spurt after spurt of cum and it flew across the room, no less than 5 feet away.  WE WERE SHOCKED AND I STILL CANT GET THE IMAGE OUT OF MY HEAD.  So ladies, if you are not happy with the current load you are blowing, rent this flick and you can be shooting like a guy in no time!   Does male ejaculate turn you on? If you are a guy, does it/would it turn you on to cum on someone, and if you are a girl or a guy, does it turn you on to have a guy cum on you?   As a gay man, I should love to swim in cum.  However, the taste, smell, and sight of it makes me want to vomit.  After I ejaculate, I wipe off the cum or shower immediately.  I really want nothing to do with it.  Paul prefers to cum on me as it turns him on.  I prefer to cum on no one as cum is from the inside of my body and I dont do well with inside the body things.  the end.      If you have tasted cum, please liken its flavor to something.   If the guy is deserving, I have been known to swallow.  Yet, most guys are not deserving and thats when I either spit it onto their stomach or run across the room and spit it into the garbage can.  I cannot stand the taste of cum.  I will wretch and puke immediately if I dont pretend as though I am tasting something other than jism.  If I had to liken this nastiness to something, I would liken it to bloody boogers on bread.  With a side of throat coat.      Anal intercourse, yes or no? Have you tried it? Good? Bad?   At 25 years old, I have yet to have anal intercourse.  Paul and I have been together for 3 years and 4 months and we have yet to dive into this aspect of our relationship.  At this point, we both want it to be special and we are waiting for that special time.  Most people tell me just to DO IT(!) already.  But clearly Im not ready.  It will happen.  Just not sure when yet.  I think we are close to doing it.  Last night I was jamming my erection into his ass crack while he laughed and tried to escape. (escape?  ESCAPE?!!?  escape.)  Sometimes I just want to grind my dick into any surface.  It just feels so good!     What is the most socially taboo thing you will admit to being turned on by?   There is very little that I am turned on by.  But at the same time, that which turns me on, gets me going to the point of combustion!  As we know I like huge muscles.  I also get turned on by mens cologne, sweat, gym equipment, suits, cop/fireman uniforms, and scruff.  Anything that exudes masculinity gets my cock blood boiling!  I like my men big and powerful, confident bordering on arrogant.  None of this is really taboo, but it can be if you choose to have a conversation about it at the local synagogue or cathedral.  If my granny was here right now, the last thing we would talk about would be anal penetration and cum loads.  But that again, she does have a third nipple, so she might be open to discussing tits and cunts.  Who knows  My answers are really suck today.  I am just way too busy at work to expound further.    Have a FUCKING GREAT weekend everyone!    Keep in mindits the lusty month of May!

      First and foremost, I have to take back some false information that I posted on here a couple days ago.  Luther Vandross is NOT dead.  Someone at work told me he was and I immediately posted the sad news on this site.  But after a week with no news about the event, I did some researching.  Luther Vandross is still in rough shape, but he is alive.  I apologize for posting incorrect information.  Stupid Joe.  Stupid, stupid cunnilingus stupid.    If you are not watching DZO on  Sorority Life  or their Brother Fraternity (Sigma Chi somethin or other) on  Fraternity Life , then you dont know what you are missing.  I am a sucker for MTV reality TV.  They are the original and the best.  (Do I even have to say it again?)  Last night, I was lucky enough to catch the new episodes as they premiered - rather than sitting around all Saturday afternoon catching up on my missed moments.  The shows are essentially Lois Lame, but I am nevertheless addicted.  Especially because the shows take place at the University of Buffalo, which is 2 and a half hours from where I went to college.  Its weird watching these kids, cuz I feel as though its a complete flashback to my college.  You knowthe nails on a chalkboard accents, the keg parties, the late night drives, eating lunch in the Unionif you were ever wondering where Joe CuttheShit went to college, tune in to MTV on Wednesday nights at 10pm.  These boners make me feel all nostalgic and shit.  Ahthe dayz.  A week from Saturday, I am going to  The Quiet Party .  Joanna and I discovered this party when we were playing on  Craigs List .  The premise of the party is simple.  There will be no loud music and no craziness.  No screaming and no yelling.  From what I imagine, there will be candles lit and light jazz playing on the corner jukebox.  A place where singles can meet and get to know each other without having to scream over the top of unnecessarily loud speakers.  In the back room (and this is the best part), there is no talking AT ALL!  It is a silent room where you can only talk to other people via paper and pencil.  If you have something you want to say to the girl sitting across the room, you must write her a note on a piece of paper and pass it along to her.  If you want to buy a good-looking guy a drink (me!), you write that offer on a piece of paper and pass it to me.  Fun, right?!?!  Joanna is excited to meet some interesting single guys and I think that this would be a great opportunity for her.  I also invited Ari as I think she could benefit from a night out with good people and mature men.  No psychos allowed.  I anticipate it being a very good time.  As long as I can keep my mouth shut for more than 5 minutes.     Tidbits of Today:   -I have taken a literal shit every half-hour since 8am.  This means that I have shit 7 times so far today.  7 times sitting on the toilet and 7 times wiping my asshole raw. -I ate an Odwalla bar and absolutely hated it. -I spent 20 minutes looking at muscle pictures when I got to work.  Making sure to minimize the screen when the housekeeper emptied my garbage can. -After leaving Aris apartment last night, I ate a huge cheeseburger and French fry dinner.  It tasted so damn good, but wasnt totally fulfilling.  When Paul showed up at my apartment an hour later, I faked that I hadnt eaten all day and he ordered me a sandwich from Subway.  I ate that too.  (ahhhis this the reason for my chronic shitting?) -My hair is so spikey that it breaks the sound barrier.  Sound barrier?  Yeah, sound barrier. -I almost got caught masturbating in the bathroom. -I have a nugget of pot in my cigarette pack for when I go to Pauls apartment later. -Am eating pizza for lunch because I am sick and tired of eating fruit every day.  I need a break from all this healthy nonsense.  -I put on both deodorant and AXE Body Spray and still reek of sour BO. -Tried to buy my mom a Teddy Bear from Vermont Teddy Bear Company, but found out that they were $100 each.  Then decided to make her a teddy bear card. -Bit off one of my fingernails, which caused a hangnail to form, after which, I ripped out the hanger and now have blood dripping down my right ring finger.   -Smelled fart in our supply room at work and in turn made sure to blame it on anyone and everyone around me.  I didnt lay the fart bomb, but wasnt at all willing to take the silent blame for it either. -Realized that by writing these Tidbits I have made myself sound like the most stank, disgusting boy on the planet.  In other news  Nell Carter is still dead.    The agency that I auditioned for last week still hasnt called me.  I guess they didnt like my thank you note that much.  For the first couple days of this week, I would run up the stairs to my apartment, burst through the door, and look at the answering machine with hopeful eyes.  As of yesterday, I just gave up.  Fuck them.  If they dont want my hot ass then I certainly dont want their snores filled asses.  It was a good first start.  Now I must find a new agency to audition for next week and then another and another and another.  yeah.  YEAH! But then again, maybe they will call me tonightpwease?  pwease and carrots?  Because I am a broke bitch, I wont be able to see Justin Timberlake and Christina Aguileras tour this summer.  I mean, its the hot ticket of the year.  Everyone who is anyone loves Justin and Christina.  I hear all this talk about Radiohead and Ben Harper and Jack Johnson and I think, Sure these people are wonderfully talented, but they arent Justin.  No one is.  Not even Justin.  Oh great!  I have to poop again!  What IS this?!?!  Did I eat a bowl of dysentery last night?  I mean, fucking for real.  I am going to have permanent creases on my ass from sitting on the bowl all day.    Alright, outtie.    Peace out my little ghoulies.

      If its broke, you can always fix it!    Okayso I will be the first to admit it.  I make a big deal out of nothing.  I can be overly dramatic, I can blow things out of proportion and I definitely take everything way too personally.  I have been this way for as long as I can remember and changing it seems about impossible.  The reason I am writing all of this is because last night I had a wonderful evening with Paul.  Oops.  I have this problem of opening up and laying all of my shit on the table with both my friends and this journal whenever anything goes wrong.  Or at least when I start to get deeply upset about the problems I am facing.  Over the last 72 hours I have broken up with Paul in my head a number of different ways.  In one such fantasy, I arrive at his house, enter via the keys he made me, grab all of my shit, stuff it in my backpack, and finally turn to tell him that Its over.  Once and for all.  Thank God there is a part of me that calms me down and forces me to get advice from my friends and family.  If I didnt do that and I acted completely on impulse, I would be sitting here most likely regretting my hasty decision.    Paul called me at work yesterday.  He was very sweet on the phone and when I informed him of my plans for the evening, he asked me to break them.  He wanted to see me.  Against my better judgement, I obliged and told him that I could be at his pad by 6pm.  When I arrived at his front door, he was nowhere to be found.  I let myself in and walked to his bedroom.  When I opened the door, there was nothing but a pile of blankets.  I immediately ripped off the pile in one fell swoop and exposed my naked boyfriend.  He screamed and started hysterically laughing.  The sound of his joy was so contagious, that I immediately forgot why I was angry and jumped on top of him.  We wrestled for a bit, laughing and pinching and acting as though our relationship was based completely on shits and giggles.    After we calmed down a bit, we started talking about anything and everything.  I had decided before arriving at his place that I wasnt going to bring up the problems of our relationship.  I was just going to have a good night with him and encourage him to talk to Mariah.  This plan worked for the first hour we were together, but out of nowhere, we began arguing over something stupid.  Having debated breaking up with him in my head over the last couple of days, I felt all of the anger, hurt, and frustration fly back into me.  I told him that we were headed down a path of destruction and that if things didnt change soon, we would be forced to go our separate ways.    It was at this moment that I realized that I am overly dramatic, blowing things out of proportion, and taking things way to personally.  Paul stared at me blankly.  He asked So, you want to break up?  I explained that I didnt want to break up, that that was the farthest thing from my mind.  I told him how deeply in love with him that I am.  But then I hit him with the reality that we might be better off as people if we took a break from each other.  I suggested that maybe we should take a month off from seeing one another, just to get perspective.  The look of horror on his face said it all.  But Joe, you are the only one I want to see.  If I cant see you, I dont want to see anyone.    My heart melted.  I told Paul that I simply was not happy with our relationship.  I explained that I am not comfortable with the way he talks to me, that he can be condescending and cruel.  As I continued to explain my position, he got very defensive.  We decided to drop the talk altogether and go to dinner.    Once we had arrived at probably the worst restaurant either of us have ever been to (the food was fucking nast), Paul brought up our Bahamas vacation.  I informed him that I had talked to my mother and that there were ways out of the trip.  Once he saw that I was serious, his entire demeanor changed.  We discussed at great length about the way we treat each other.  He was verbal with me and open about how he perceives me in the relationship.  Going into the conversation, I was just as closed minded about my wrong doings, as he has been in the past.  I found the anger building in me when he was laying all of our issues on the table.  I bit my tongue and I sat there and gave him a chance to speak his mind.  Fortunately, it was the smartest thing I could have done.    Once Paul explained himself, I felt a release of all of the pressure that had been building up inside of me for the last week.  We then had the most productive conversation that we have had in the longest time.  Its funny how everything can change in the matter of minutes.  He became this beautiful boy again and not the monster that I had been envisioning.  When he reached across the table to touch my hand at a delicate point of the conversation, I knew that I had lost the battle again.  We would not be breaking up.  We would be giving our relationship yet another chance.    The one thing that I was not flexible on was our lack of intimacy.  He tried to explain to me why he doesnt want to be physical and it made some sense.  SOME sense.  I still feel as though there is no excuse for using sex as a weapon in a relationship and I explained that to him in great detail.  I also told him of my fear of us never actually having intercourse, as we cant even kiss on the lips these days.  He then did a typical Paul thing and said, Lets have sex (anal sex) tonight!  I burst out laughing and told him Never.  Because Paul can sometimes be a clueless moron about things, he made me discuss why it wasnt normal for us to have anal sex for the first time when we dont even suck each others dicks anymore.  Eventually he backed down and agreed to start working on our physicality.     By the end of dinner, we were back in love and ready to grow.  We laughed all the way home and when we got back into his apartment, he turned to me, kissed me on the cheek and said I love you Joe.  THATS EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED.  To feel appreciated, to feel loved, and to feel wanted.  All of the things that any guy would need to get from his boyfriend.    I have learned quite a few lessons over the last couple of days.  Mostly about how  I  am as a boyfriend.  I am lucky to be surrounded by people who care about me and love me so much that they want nothing more than for me to be happy.  Although Paul and I exist within the same group of friends (a very dangerous thing I might add), we are both blessed to have surrounded ourselves with people who dont take sides except when needed.  They are objective and understanding.  They are a true support system.  Engineered and designed specifically for nut cases like Paul and I.    I know it seems like I deserve better and that may be true.  But until I fall out of love with this guy there is no hope of me ever moving on without him.  His happiness is my happiness.  I dont like to give up on anything.  Especially not something like this.  If it takes more work, I am willing to put it in.  We could have the opportunity to achieve emotional levels with each other that I never thought was possible before.  I dont want to lose him or give up on him until I am sure that we have hit our plateau.    I need to keep in mind that Paul struggles with his own issues too.  I am not the only one in this relationship who is suffering from the trials of life.  My mom told me yesterday that I need to make sure that I am not projecting my current misery on him.  He is not the answer to all of my problems.  Yet it is so easy to sit in here and write about how badly he treats me, when I really should be sitting here focusing on fixing my own shit.  I need to be there for Paul just as I want him to be here for me.   I am not the center of the universe.  I am just a star.  Ok, that was a lame ass analogy, but you get the idea.  Thanks for putting up with my struggles over the last couple of days.  If I didnt have this journal here to release everything that is in my head, I would certainly make some irreparable decisions.    Starting this thing up was the best idea Rita ever gave to me.

      If Cinco De Mayo is translated into English, the definition must be Crazy, Intense, Day of the Ludicrous.   My gosh, if last night was anymore dramatic, I think my head would have exploded into a thousand miniscule pieces.    Let me explain  Paul called me at 4:30pm yesterday to see how I was doing.  Having had a day of hating our relationship, I was very weird with him on the phone.  He asked me what we were doing for dinner and I quickly said that I already had plans with the girls.  He responded with No one called me.  I did my best to be polite and tried to get off the phone as quickly as possible.  He wanted to know what was wrong with me and I briefly explained that I wasnt very happy with the conversation we had on Saturday.  He gave me the same old excuses for his meanness and I just sat there quietly.  Eventually we got off the phone and as I sat at my desk, I started to feel really terrible for upsetting him.  I called him back and we spoke for a couple of minutes about whether or not he was going to meet us out.  He said he would think about it.  For the rest of the night, I called him over and over (because my number is blocked at home and he wouldnt know it was me calling) to check up on him.  He never answered the phone.    Mariah, Joanna, Rachel the fuckface, and Mariahs friends Anne and Trevor, went with me to a bar called Cacti Jacks Cantina.  When we walked into the front doors, my anxiety was working over time.  I knew that we were going to a straight bar, but I didnt know that it was going to be one big frat. party.  At first, I was ready to bolt.  I was pretty uncomfortable and I had no expectation of fitting into this sweaty and loud and obnoxious environment.  The girls were kinda busted, but did their best to wear the hoochiest of clothing in order to make them somewhat attractive.  The guys were kinda busted too, but were exuding testosterone and masculinity all over the place.  And for that, I loved it.  Then after 3 margaritas and some of the worst music I have ever heard in my life I started to fall in love with the place.    Of course I found both a boyfriend and a girlfriend within the matter of an hour.  Girls, finewe are in a straight bar.  But a guy hitting on me?  How does that happen?  But it did.  He was a bit too girly for my tastes so I ignored him completely.  A guy with broad shoulders and a rippling chest walked in and he was the one I wanted.  But of course I didnt go up to him and say anything.  I like having a full row of front teeth afterall.   Joanna left the bar at 8:30pm and I decided to stay for one more margarita with the rest of the crew.  We danced and drank and watched two girls pretend they were lesbians and make out on the top of the bar.  The guys were hollering and cheering them on and I felt like the entire thing was so Lois Lame and overdone.  But whatever  I decided to leave the bar at around 9:30pm.  Mariah offered to walk me to the door and she and I had a few cigarettes before saying goodbye.  I dont know how it happened, but I started sobbing about how Paul and I are headed for a break-up.    SIDE NOTE:  Back when I first met Mariah, I went through a very hard break-up with her and her then girlfriend Kathleen.  They had been together for 5 years when Kathleen decided to break up with Mariah.  Stupid, stupid mistake for Kathleen, but I stood by Mariahs side throughout the entire ordeal and I understood every time she went running back to her.  But now, Mariah is over Kat and although Kat still calls her and begs for a revival of their relationship, she has moved on in a more productive and positive direction.    So Mariah stood with me in the drizzling rain and hugged me and talked to me and made sure that I was okay, before sending me home in a cab.  She was a God send last night.  Especially since when she went back into the bar, Rachel threw a fucking tantrum because Mariah had ignored her for a matter of 10 minutes.  Rachel ripped me apart behind my back and told Mariah that she is a terrible friend and that gay people are always so dramatic and a waste of time.  Rachel is a fucking cunt that deserves to get her smarmy face punched in.  I am about on my last nerve with that bitch and if she makes Mariah feel unnecessarily bad about one more thing, I am going to ruin her life.    When I got home, I began to feel incredibly lonely for Paul.  I thought a lot about our current situation and I started to really question myself and my reasons for wanting to break up.  Truth is, I am still very deeply in love with him.  I hurt when he hurts.  Making him angry or upset really brings me down.  I feel terrible inside when he gets sad or lonely.  If this were the perfect world, Paul would turn into the best boyfriend ever and we would have a wonderful and loving relationship.  We would make love and he wouldnt throw past shit in my face.  We would go to movies and he wouldnt tell me to watch what I eat.  We could spend all day in bed, just because we love being with each other so much.    But this is not the perfect world and none of this is currently possible.  As I was running all of this through my head, the phone rang and it was Mariah calling to check up on me.  When I answered the phone, she was crying.  I asked her what was wrong and she said that she was just so upset for me.  She hates to see me cry and she said that she had been running our conversation over and over in her head throughout the rest of the evening.  We cried a bit together on the phone and I felt so loved.  Mariah has been the third wheel to my relationship with Paul for as long as I can remember.  She is very good friends with him and wants nothing more than for us to be in love.  And happy.    It breaks her heart that we arent happy right now and she wants to help fix it.  I told her that as Pauls best friend, I think that she needs to sit him down and explain to him what is happening.  He wont listen to me, but he will hear everything she has to say.  And maybe that will be what it takes to get he and I back on track.  But if notif not, then I am going to have to trust in my friends to help me heal my heart which has already started to break.     Do whats best for Joe.  Make Joe the first priority.  Re-discover who you are as an independent person.  So much advice has been given to me and so much love has been shown to me.  But its up to me to make the decision for myself.  And right now, I am still completely confused.  And I miss Paul so much.     After calling Paul a few times with no luck, I fell asleep.  It was pretty lonely lying in my big bed all by myself.  I positioned all of my pillows around me to pretend as though I wasnt alone.  To my delight and surprise, when I woke up in the middle of the night, Trey, Kellys baby boy (our cat) was curled up inside my arm.  I was so shocked that I jumped out of my skin when I saw him there.  He immediately ran away and I chased him through the apartment trying to get him to come back and lay with me.  All of this happening at 3:30am.  Finally I gave up and went back to sleep.  When I woke up this morning, there was little Trey again, curled up in my arm.  This is the first time that he has done this and I have never needed it more in my life.  When I left to go to work this morning, it made me so upset to have to leave him behind.  He was so sweet last night and I wanted to stuff him in my bag and carry him to work.    Mariah offered to take me out to dinner tonight to get my mind off of everything serious.  I am not sure that I am going to go yet, but the offer is still on the table.  We are also going out to a busy and overcrowded gay bar this weekend.  I am so overdue.  I need to feel wanted and I will surely get some attention from the ridiculous boys at one of the local clubs.  Plus she offered to pay, since at this moment I have $8 in my checking account.  Yipes.  Seriously yipes.    Time to go enjoy a bout of diarrhea.   Knew I had one too many margaritas last night

      Happy Cinco De Mayo everyone!  I am very excited to leave work and go meet up with Joanna and Mariah at a very famous Mexican Place in the city.  At 6pm, picture me chugging down some Coronas with Lime and maybe even chowing down on a plate of nachos.  You may even imagine me wearing a sombrero, but that would be foolish.  This cat doesnt do shit like that in public for fear of ridicule.  But you can definitely assume that I will be wearing my burro costume.  What kind of mockery could come from that?!?!  After allit IS CINCO DE MAYO!  AY YI YI!  Paul and I are quickly going down the tubes.  Ive about had it with him.  Yes, I know I say this a lot and yes I know I have broken up with him twice before But this time when we go our separate ways, we do it for good.  I am not playing games with him anymore.  Honestly, I feel like I hate him.  I dont know what it is.  Maybe I was pretending for too long that things were going well, just so I didnt have to deal with the fact that I was stuck in a dead end relationship.  Maybe, deep down in my heart, I believed that he and I would eventually iron out the kinks and end up successful and happy.  Maybe I just didnt want to confront the fact that I have dedicated three years of my life to someone who makes me completely unhappy.  Very often I write in this journal about how great Paul is and how much fun we have together.  Sometimes its true.  But please understand that I am definitely STRETCHING the story as best as I can to make him come out looking all right.  If I came into this journal every day and bitched about how terrible he was the night before, the entries would get old and played out and hella fucking boring.  Truth is, Paul has treated me with little to no respect since I have known him.  And I am not someone to sit around and complain every day about how terrible everything with him really is.  I constantly write how in love with him I am, but thats because Id rather say that then get into what is really going on.   It used to be cute when he was tough on me.  I used to like the challenge of being with a guy that doesnt really like me.  I get bored in relationships easily and I drop them without even a second thought.  But with Paul, there was something deeper, something holding us together.  What that was, I dont remember anymore.  All I know now is that Paul treats me like shit.  He isnt kind to me and he never treats me with any sort of gentleness.  In fact, so much of our relationship has been tainted that I am not sure if he even likes the sight of me anymore.    Paul has quite a few intimacy problems, as has been discussed at great lengths in this journal.  He wont kiss me, he wont touch mefuckhe wont even hug me without holding one hand against my chest to push me away.  Of course I have tried to have numerous conversations with him about all of this and when I am asked what the results of these conversations are, I am left to shrug my shoulders and say I really dont know.  Paul isnt a communicator.  I will talk and talk about what I think we need to do to fix the relationship and he will just stare at me blankly or wait for me to finish what I am saying and then counter with a rude and insensitive remark.  A remark that is totally unrelated to what we are discussing.    I give him every possible opportunity to treat me better.  I am very vocal about what I want out of our relationship and of the expectations that I have of him.  Basically, Paul just must not care.  Or he has fallen out of love with me and is afraid to let me know.  Maybe thats it.  Maybe he simply doesnt love me anymore and doesnt know how to go forward with breaking my heart.  But I would rather have my heart broken once and for all, have it heal, and move on from there; get away from him before he completely destroys my faith in other men.    I DONT KNOW!  I am completely confused as to what to do.  Its not like he has cheated on me or like he beats the shit out of me.  Its not like he has done anything wrong in specific that would cause the end of our time together.  I just dont know.  The thing that perplexes me the most is that we have a vacation to the Bahamas planned for July.  I dont have any money saved up for it and going on the trip would just put me further in debt.  If he and I were in a good place right now, the debt wouldnt bother me at all.  But the idea of spending $800 on a trip to be with someone who wont even kiss me seems absolutely ludicrous.    I just got off the phone with my mom and I explained the entire situation to her.  Basically we have to go on the trip or we will still be forced to spend all of the money for nothing.  Here are our options: 1) I can go on the trip with someone else.  I can have the name on the plane ticket changed and I can bring a friend with me. 2) Paul can go on the trip and I can pay $100 to change my ticket, but allow him to use the condo on his own with a friend of his choosing. 3) Spend the $400 for the condo and plane ticket and just throw the whole thing away as a stupid mistake.  Besides that, there is nothing left for me to do.  The biggest part of this whole problem is that if we dont go on the trip, he and I are definitely done.  The advice I have been given from numerous people is Dont stay with Paul just because of the Bahamas vacation.  While that makes sense, I know that deep down, if we dont go, we are done.  Forever done.  So part of me wants to go on the trip because that part of me doesnt want to face this break-up.  Goshjust so confused.  Do I really want to break up with him?  Is there no other solution?  If I talk to him about all of this again, will he respond in a beneficial way or will he do what he has done in the past and shut me out?  If he shuts me out again, it is going to be hard for him to come back to me at any point in the future.    Paul and I havent talked since Saturday because during a phone call that afternoon, he said something to me that was pretty horrible.  I didnt hang up on him, I didnt yell at him, I simply got off the phone and thought about what he said.  Instead of having him come over to my house, I told him that I was going out with other people, locked the door and didnt answer any of his calls for the rest of the weekend.  We usually spend Monday nights together, but tonight I have made other plans.  I am not calling him to tell him that I have made other plansI am just going.  He has yet to call me today at work and I am pretty much hoping he doesnt.  I want to avoid talking to him for as long as possible.    We have a lot of anger built into our relationship and I dont know if any conversation we have could fix this.    I am left not knowing what to do.    Would I be better without him?    Or   Am I giving up too soon?

       Disclaimer:  I hate leaving disclaimers, but I think I should for this entry.  If you are offended by gay, graphic sexual conversation, then this is not the post for you.  I suggest you check out a more boring and bland site, such as www.imaclosedmindednofunloser.com  I have yet to participate in Pussy Ranchs Filthy Friday Five questionnaire thing, but today I figured I would give it a shot.    Here we go:   What did you think about the last time you masturbated?    The last time I masturbated, I thought about a male bodybuilder.  (no one in particular)  I have always had a very strong fetish for guys with a lot of muscle.  So EVERY time I masturbate, thats what I am thinking about.  I mean, what girl doesnt want to be picked up in a strong mans arms, then carried into the bedroom, only to be fucked by a guy that smells and feels like MAN!?!?  GoshI think I might have to go rub one out in the bathroom at my work.  These questions are getting me HORNY and I am only on the first one!   How often do you masturbate?   This depends.  Definitely every day.  I really try not to let a whole 24-hour period go by without an orgasm.  I find that it soothes and relaxes me.  The most I have jerked in one day is 6 times.  I want to try for 7, but my dick has like zero skin left once I pop off number 6.  Most of the time I am a two times a day type of guy.  But like I said, it depends.   Do you prefer visuals, literature or any other kind of stimulus?   GREAT QUESTION!  I prefer a photo of the guy that turns me on for that day sitting next to me as I read a hot piece of erotic literature.  I am huge into muscle fantasies and find that there are quite a few really good stories on the net.  Of course I have a couple of videos, but I dont get turned on by anal fucking, so its hard for me to find that right video that has kissing bodybuilders.  Of course I have a dildo.  Well, actually, I have two.  One is little, probably the size of my middle finger, and the other is quite large and in order for me to insert that bad boy, I have to lube up and get myself all hot and bothered.  Soin conclusionI prefer erotic literature combined with a photo combined with the dildo of my choice.  ROCK!   When was the first time you masturbated? What was your "method?"   The first time I masturbated, I was 14 years old and home on spring break from highschool.  I had been trying to masturbate for a couple of months and with no success.  So, as was previously mentioned in this journal, one day I was watching  Gilad: Bodies in Motion  and I noticed that Gilad was looking extrawellGilad-like that day.  I stood in front of my television and pulled on my pud for at least an hour with no luck.  After pulling and yanking and pulling and yanking and pulling and yanking, some white stuff flew out of my cock and gave me the SHOCK of my life.  I think I screamed when it happened.  It felt like something I have never experienced before.  It was so unexpected.  My heart was pounding out of my chest and I felt like I must have done it wrong.  It felt so overwhelmingly good and strange and I kind of panicked.  Eventually, like 20 minutes later, I began tugging and tugging again hoping to repeat the process with the same outcome.  Unfortunately, at the time, I didnt realize that it takes a while to build up a new supply of cum, so I would pull and pull for hours before it happened again.  From the moment of my first orgasm until now, I have yet to stop pulling on my cock.  I just love it.   Do you enjoy watching others "love themselves" or is it a purely solo act?   I HATE watching others please themselves.  Ok, I dont HATE it.  But it does nothing for me, but make me bored.  Problem is that I am not attracted to 98% of men.  I need them to have TONS of sex appeal or I need them to be BIG and STRONG.  If they arent one of these two things, then I have no interest in seeing them whip out their cock and balls and go to town.  Unless I am in the midst of a mutual masturbation session, I am completely bored by another guy gratifying himself.    My own personal question:   What do you do during orgasm to make the experience even that much better?   Try out these wonderful little tricks to extend or intensify that orgasm:  1) At the point of creaming, tighten every muscle in your legs.   2) If comfortable with inserting objects into your anus (sick, I hate that word anus), take your finger and stick it in only slightly into your asshole and curve it like a hook.  At the point of orgasm, use this hook to stretch your asshole.  Once you get comfortable with poking around in there, you will find that there are quite a few erogenous zones in that area.  Good luck in discovering your own! 3) At the point of orgasm, hold your breath and dont let it out until the orgasm is over.  The overwhelming body sensation is probably dangerous, but it feels pretty good. 4) When your dick is about to explode with cum, slow down the jerking technique that you use and try to make the orgasm last as long as you can.  Slow jerks will make the orgasm extreme and wonderful.  This process might take a few tries before you can get it down to perfection. 5) At the moment of orgasm, pinch the vas deferens shut (thats the tube that the cum flows out of).  It hurts, but you can still experience an orgasm and return to jerking off 10 minutes later because you havent spent all the cum in that one moment.  Plusthe next orgasm you have will be BIZOMB!  And I guess thats it!  If youve got any other suggestions, leave them in my comments.  Always interested in trying out other peoples techniques!    Have a great weekend yall.    Im going home to play with myself!

      WELL!  The audition went very smoothly.  I arrived at the agency at 3:40pm for my 4pm time slot.  The receptionists were a bit aggressive and I have to admit that they did nothing but add to my heightened level of stress.  They handed me my audition piece and it was pretty difficult.  I expected something much more basic and easy to read than what they handed me.  But for about a half an hour I went over and over the lines and came up with the interpretation that I thought worked best for me.  At 4:15pm I went in and was greeted by a very professional man named, Richard, who told me not to overact and not to be too loud.  (I have a feeling that most people that do this reading for him go into it full force and end up way off mark) (Plus, he must hear this reading every day, all day, and was probably tired of people coming in and treating the piece as though it was to be the next Oscar winning performance)  I handed him my headshot and resume and he commented on how I have zero film experience.  I explained that that was my reason for auditioning for his agency.  They are well known for placing both Union and Non-Union actors in bit parts for upcoming commercials and films.    After my reading, Richard told me that he liked what I submitted to him and that I should call today at 10:30am to find out how we were going to go forward with all of this.  I did call this morning and was told by a different Richard (one of his fellow agents) that they were still reviewing my submission and that they would be in touch soon.  I find these people to be very intimidating, but I figure its my place to be humble and to do whatever they say.  After I got off the phone with the second Richard, I typed up a quick thank you note and am planning on mailing it to the agency this afternoon.  Just to keep me in the forefront of their minds.  So who knows?  Basically, if they decide not to go with me, I am fine with that.  My biggest accomplishment was actually going TO the audition and not bailing like I have done in the past.  So YAY!  Regardless, I have a few other agencies that I will be checking out over the weekend and I hope to make appointments with them next week.  I hope this is the start of a very wonderful career as an actor!  We will see  MY BROTHER CALLED ME THIS MORNING!  Imagine my shock when I answered the phone and heard his voice broadcasting loud and clear from somewhere in the Middle East.  He sounded good overall, but I could tell that deep down he wants nothing more than to toss in the towel and come home.  He has definitely lost the passion for the military and is doing his best to complete his required service time.  I can tell that he misses his family and his girlfriend too much.  I did my best to be as supportive as possible and I encouraged him to do the best job he could possibly do.  And I have no question in my mind that he will do just that.  I wasnt allowed to know where he is stationed right now and we werent allowed to discuss anything military oriented for fear that the line would be cut off.  At one point I asked him if he had told anyone in his battalion that he was a homosexual and after he burst out laughing, he asked me not to say anything that could be misinterpreted again.  There are military people listening to everything you say during this phone call Joe.  Be careful.  I reply with Yeah, but have you found yourself a boyfriend?  He laughed again.  When we were talking there was a delay in everything he said.  Damn Satellite phones.  Kind of like what happens when news correspondents from Baghdad broadcast their information to the CNN news reporters.  On TV the delay isnt as funny as it is when you are on the phone.  I would say something like Last night I took a shit that looked black and blue.  Then before he could respond I would say Mom is still pretty upset about you being gone and then he would laugh out loud.  It took me a minute to realize that in order for us to have a normal conversation, I would have to slow down and wait for his response.  I got the hang of it towards the end.  In any case, talking to him made my entire day.  He is safe and he sounds good.  As long as that remains, so will my sanity.  Last night, Paul and I had our date night.  He picked a restaurant off of the internet called The Hour Glass Tavern.  When we showed up at the restaurant, I immediately thought that the experience was going to be a disaster.  The crowd looked very stuffy and straight-laced and if youve read my archives, you know that we have had bad restaurant experiences before.  But we went in and sat down at a table anyway.  Turns outit was the best restaurant that either he or I have been to in the city.  We got our usual three courses and we also received a free batch of their homemade bread and a free vegetarian casserole appetizer.  Both were excellent.  We had filet mignons and a glass of wine and the food was so fucking good that I ate my own poop this morning, just to savor the taste one more time.   The ambiance was wonderful and the waitstaff was incredible.  We are so heading back there some time soon.    After dinner, Paul and I walked around the city for a bit and then got some ice cream.  We laughed, we debated, we had a great time.  Overall yesterday was an excellent day.  I felt like a normal kid again.  Not anything like the depressed sad sap of last week.  This is not to say that I still dont need to find myself a doctor and counselor, cuz I do.  It just felt good to live a normal life for a day, without worry as to whether or not I was going to start crying over something lame.    OH!  I keep forgetting to write about this ridiculous thing that happened last Sunday night.    Paul and I were sleeping together in my bed and it was one of those nights where we both tossed and turned throughout the entire evening.  Well, around 4:00am, I was having this dream where I was trying to smash something.  I kept taking my hand and slamming it down on a counter.  I remember repeating this process over and over.  Suddenly I wake up with a start and Paul tells me that I have been slapping my stomach repeatedly.  I told him that was impossible, that I would never slap myself while I slept.  He turned on the light and to my shock and horror, I had welts in the shape of my handprint.  My stomach was bright red and there were finger marks.  What the fuck?  I told him that I was sure he took my own hand and slapped it against my stomach and then blamed it on me.  Cuz why would I slap myself while I slept??    Needless to say, I am sure he didnt force me to hit myself.  But it still perturbs me to think that I harm myself while I sleep.  Now, every night before we go to sleep, Paul tells me to behave myself.  I always laugh when he says it, but then turn over and face the wall worried.  Joe, please do behave yourself, I say over and over in my head.   Since we have been together, I have done quite a few random things while sleeping in bed with him.  The biggest and most horrifying thing I have ever done was pee on him.  Yes you read that correctly.  I peed on him.    We had been together for exactly 3 weeks and he came to visit me at my college.  I woke up one morning and thought My God, I sweated my ass off last night and then as I shed my grogginess, I realized that I had sweat ALL OVER THE BED!  I ripped open the sheets to discover that both Paul and I were covered in my piss.  It took me weeks to get over that experience.  I have never pissed the bed before and I definitely wasnt drunk before we had gone to bed.  Not that I have ever pissed in my bed when I was drunk, but I have heard of it happening.  His little joke after that incident was Joe, please dont pee on me while we sleep.  MAN!  I STILL CANT BELIEVE I DID THAT!  In any case, it hasnt happened since.    Alright, time for lunch.  Am going to the park to celebrate the fact that it is absolutely beautiful outside.    (Did I really just write about how I pissed on my boyfriend?)

      Wellity, wellity  Gay Pride was a complete success!  I got out of my mood the second I left work.  Figures that that was what was bringing me down!   We did and saw and participated in so many events that it would be impossible for me to list them all.  But I will say that the best time we had was at the Gay Pride Parade.  There were tens of thousands of gay people strewn about 5th avenue screaming and chanting and being one.  The floats were incredible, the music was PUMPING, and the costumes were lavish and fun.  There were gay babies, gay senior citizens, gays with one leg, political representatives, famous musicians, playwrights, body builders, strippers, dancers, etc.  Standing among this massive crown of people filled with me so much pride, I almost started to weep with joy during a couple different moments.    There are very few times in my life when I feel an identity towards a specific group of people.  This weekend was definitely one of them.  I felt so much happiness and joy in my sexuality.  Who wants to be straight when you can be GAY?  Surely not me.   The lesbian places we went to turned out to be a lot of fun and totally welcoming to gay men.  I was shocked and relieved that I didnt have to split up with my friends.  We drank from 5pm on Friday straight thru to 5pm yesterday, only stopping to sleep during 4-hour intervals here and there.  I thought I was going to die on Saturday afternoon, but somehow I found the energy and pushed through.  Thank God that I did.  I feel so happy that I was able to attend everything that I wanted to and that I didnt let my exhaustion get the best of me.   Here are some highlights from the weekend of GAY:  1) At the lesbian party on the Hudson River, I decided that the bathroom line was WAY too long.  I asked everyone to give me their empty cups and to form a tight lesbian circle around me.  With my friends protecting me from the thousands of lesbians at the party, I whipped out my dick and filled up two glasses with piss.  Two minutes later, Mariah bumped into my friend, Angie  who was in the process of holding one of my piss cups.  It spilled and drenched everyone with steaming hot urine.  We laughed and laughed and smelled like booze piss for the rest of the night.  2) In one evening, we stumbled across at least 4 different groups of people smoking pot.  They ALL included us in their smoking sessions and for the first time in forever, I didnt have to bring or pay for all of the pot we smoked.  Everyone was so generous and wonderful about it.   3) I hooked up with Ahmad twice.  Once when we crashed at my place at 4am, Saturday morning, and once more when we woke up at 9am, Saturday morning.  He came the first time, I came the second time.  After I wiped up my cum, I told him to Go home, which he did.  I had a great time with him on Friday night, but needed some space after the hook-up extravaganza.  4) We all crashed at Pauls place on Saturday night and ended up passing out at 5am.  Each one of us was up by 11am the next morning with a Bellini (champagne and orange juice) in hand.  We drank the biggest bottle of champagne I have ever seen in my life and headed out to the parade.  The old hangover cure of having some of The hair of the dog that bit you is totally true.  I can attest to it first hand.    5) I finally saw  A Beautiful Mind  and loved it.  Russel Crowe, although not my most favorite actor in the world, is truly brilliant.  Jennifer Connelly was excellent too, but should she be allowed to win an OSCAR for that part?  Does she even get NOMINATED for that part?  I thought she was VERY VERY good.  Dont get me wrong.  But the part was rather weak for an OSCAR nomination.  Then again, what do I know?  I just got into the first play of my NYC career.  Snores McSnorsersons.  6) I got my first letter from Baghdad!  My brother finally got a note out to me and it made my day.  7) Saw two of my favorite Gay Bodybuilders at the parade.  They were HOTTTTTT, cept kind of femmy.  Now I dont think I can masturbate to them anymore.  The faade was totally ruined.  At first I was like OMG!  Look who it is!   urlLink Caesar  and  urlLink Tom Katt !  But after they flexed their huge bodies for all of the adoring fans, they proceeded to skip and prance around the float they were supposed to be posing on.  My jaw hit the pavement and I looked away in disgust and embarrassment.  Dont be BIG and HOTT and then go be BIG and fag.  Thats just not appealing at all.    8) We came up with so many new saying and jokes during the weekend.  Despite a few arguments and bouts of tears, the group managed to stick together and laugh throughout all of it.  When you have so many different personalities working towards a common goal (Gay Pride), there will, of course, end up being some disagreements.  Yet, I was pleasantly surprised to see that everyone got along.  The one thing that I will carry away from this whole experience is that we all laughed and laughed and laughed.  So much laughing that my vagina is aching today.   I cant believe the entire thing is over now.  So much anticipation and so worth it.  But now we have to wait a whole year in order to do it up again.  We all commented on how there should be Gay Pride at least 5 times a year.  None of us like the idea of the city only turning uber friendly towards gay people during one weekend of the year.  As the parade ended and we finished up our beers and burgers, we were all very sad to say goodbye to the freedom and the fun that we were collectively a part of.  While saying goodbye to each other, we hugged a little bit longer than usual.  But I will see you this week for my birthday party!, I called out.  But its not the same.  We wont get to do this whole gay weekend again until next year, Mariah said.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know, I admitted.    The fantasy world ended and Kelly and I boarded the subway for home.    Tonight I am going over to Ahmads after work.  He is making me dinner and a cake and giving me my birthday present.  I have NO idea what it is, but I was given this clue:   My gift is not extravagant (NUTS!), but it is something that will show you how good of a listener I am.  And I know for a fact that you will love it, He says. Thats a lot of pressure you are putting on yourself. I reply. Im confident that you will love it. He says back.  So we will see!  I am nervous and curious and hmmmmmmmm.I dont know.  We will NOT be hooking up tonight.  I need to slow us down a bit again.  He told Mariah on Friday that Joe is a good boy and I am willing to wait as long as he needs for him to be able to open his heart to me.  Mariah immediately reported this information back to me, along with some other comments that warmed my heart, but made my nerves shatter at the same time.    What ever happened to just Playing it by ear or Taking everything one day at a time?  The kid has some serious feelings for me.  I have serious feelings for pizza.    You understand.  Thank God this Monday is almost over.  Two more days until I am @^!  Oops.  I meant 26!

      Well, it's officially Gay Pride Weekend and I have started it out in a foul mood.    Last night was ok.  Nothing special.  I didn't end up going out to the Meow Mix, with the rest of the girls, cuz I was having a day of hating lesbians.  It's a little overbearing to hang out with a group of 8 girls, all of whom want to go to every lesbian bar in the city.  I wish we had some gay guys in our group.  And by gay guys, I mean gay friends.  Not the variety of boys I have been known to date at times.    I have been such a bitch to everyone I have talked to this morning.  I am having one of those days where I take out my mood on everyone else and it's not fair.  I have to go home and take a nap and get ready for a weekend of fun.  It's going to be whatever I make of it and I must make it a good time.  I think I just need some rest.    I surprised Paul by staying over at his house last night.  It broke my heart to see how happy he was to have me waiting there for him.  But the guilt I felt inside, knowing that I was seeing Ahmad tonight, made me act all weird and detached.  Paul wants only me.  And I don't know what I want.  I want Paul, the way he is right now, but how do I know that he won't revert back to his old ways?    As he fell asleep last night, I lay staring at him for a long time.  He looked so beautiful laying there.  He looked so real.  I thought for a moment "I know him better than I know anyone else on the planet.  He is the most real person I have in my life".  Then I got increasingly more upset that behind his back I am still dating Ahmad.  He doesn't deserve that.  Not when he loves me so much.    I need to get my mood in gear and enjoy this gay pride to the fullest.  It's my first one in NYC.  I have tons of plans, including: house parties, bar hopping, a kegger on Chelsea Piers and the big ass parade on Sunday.  There is no reason why I should feel the way I do right now.  It's not the gay events or the lesbians that is really bothering me.  It's the confusion, guilt, and anger I feel towards myself over the whole Ahmad/Paul situation.  As often as I say that I just want to live my life for me and to do what I want to do, deep down it is a very difficult issue for me to deal with.  I am always upset because I feel as though I am hurting other people by living my own life.    Congrats to my fellow gays on the Supreme Court's Ruling Against the Ban on Gay Sex!  It is a victory that I know a lot of you have been hoping and praying for.    Here's to our equality!   And to a beautiful, pride-filled, weekend.

      Guess whos famous?  MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!  Me.  This morning I gave an interview to the  Daily News  about being a twentysomething Manhattanite that finds a way to survive living a life without a cell phone.  My friend, Joanna, was interviewed yesterday and she gave my name to the columnist and I was contacted this morning for the interview.  It was SO much fun.  She asked me numerous questions and my opinion on cell phone usage in todays society.  When I get nervous, I speak fast and throw way too much information into the conversation.  I hope she doesnt cut and paste things I said in a manner that would make me humiliated.  I can just imagine the article coming out and it saying:   Joe CuttheShit believes that cell phones are impersonal and straight from the depths of hell.  He believes that if you (sic) use a cell phone, you should go to hell too.  Hellbound fuckersI like cheese a lot.   The interviewer said that she might even take a picture of Joanna and I and put that in the paper next to the article!  YAY!  How fun!  I will make a hundred copies and mail it out to anyone who wants one.  Or you could just look at it online.  OH!  One more funny thingthe interviewer lady person asked me what my girlfriend thought of me not having a cell phone and I was like DOH(!), girlfriend?!?!  So, I said Yes, I have a girlfriend and shes cool with it, blah blah blah.  Oh, how long have you been together?, she asked next.  For about 3 and a half years, but now Im dating a Muslim and he has a really good body.  OOPS!  Sike.  But I did tell her that I had a girlfriend.  All I could think about was that if I told her I was gay, it would eventually come back and bite me in the ass in the future.  So I lied about my sexuality.  Which I HATE HATE HATE to do.  Whatever.  I need a publicist ASAP.  Last nights auditions were AMAAAAAAAAAAAAZING.  Holy shit was it so much fun.  We auditioned about 11 or 12 guys and out of all of them, two were great!  Megan decided to have call backs next Tuesday, so that we can see the guy, Brad, from Tuesday night, alongside the other two boys from last night.  I have a personal favorite that I hope gets the part.  Brad was excellent, but after seeing this guy, Ian, I immediately realized so much more about my character than I had previously.  Ian embodies the role of Jim.  But I am not the director and I am confident that Megan will make the right choice.  Brad was too pretty to be Jim, I think.  Ian has this inherently masculine, confident, aggressive nature that seemed to work wonderfully.  Plus, he was one of the only two that read the play before the audition.  A total MUST for any aspiring auditioner.      I got home around 9:30pm and was up until about 2am running the lines in my bed.  The fire in my belly was pulsing with the passion of a thousand actors.  It was such an invigorating feeling!  I couldnt stop running the scenes over and over.  Trying out new ways to say the lines and inventing different circumstances for my character.  It was SO fun and all consuming.  Welcome back to acting Joe!  YAYAYAYAYAYAYAY!  Yet, I am pretty tired today from staying up all night playing around.  I gotta try to keep my passion a little bit under control or I am going to end up being a gay zombie.  And gay zombies have been known to eat brains.  And I dont mean brains from your headI mean brains like your bag of balls.    crunch slop gulp.  Tonight I am off to the  Cubby Hole  for happy hour and then MAYBE over to the local dyke bar for a few drinks and dancing.  I am doing my best to bail out on the lesbian nonsense, but I dont know if I will be able to.  My friends seem to love having me stand there fending for myself.  And every time I go, I get into a fight with one angry dyke or another.  No lezzies seem to like cute and harmless gay boys.   (okay, maybe not so harmless.)  (but definitely cute, right?)  So far Ihavent been able to find many fun things to do for PRIDE weekend, despite getting trashed at the clubs.  I was hoping that there would be a gay boat cruise or a gay picnic or even a gay man lazar tag.  But it seems to me that the only genre of people that do events like that are lesbians.  And lesbians are mean.    Ok, sorry.  I digress.  Lesbians are not the devil.  I dont want any of my lesbionic readers to think that I hate them.  I am just tired of not being included in their little events.  And I am VERY tired of getting into confrontations with them every time I step into one of their bars.  Gay men very rarely treat women like this.  So why the double standard?    Oh!  And I found out something totally weird!  Turns out that lesbians consider fingering a girl more personal than eating a girl out.  TWAT?  I was SURE it was the other way around.  But no.  All of my lesbians say that eating a girl is like nothing.  But fingering is like fucking.  Interesting.  I learn something new every day about those vagina eaters.   Ah wellin any caseI am very excited to spend Pride weekend with my girl friends.  I just wish there was a place that we could all go where everyone felt comfortable.  One would think that gay people had a natural kinship with each other, but its just not true.  Boh well.  Happy Thursday my gaylords!

      Theres just so much.  No introduction to my post today.  Last night was such an insane evening that I must immediately jump in and try to explain why every time I go out with my group of friends, drama follows us and slaps us in the face.  First offthe audition.  Last night, Kelly and Megan (Co-Founders of the Theater Company that is putting on  Stupid Kids ) and I met up with this kid named Brad to audition him for the part of Jim.  You get all that?  So many names.    The real auditions for the part of Jim happen tonight, but Brad couldnt come so we met him last night just in case he was right for the part.  And thank God we did!  Cuz, umhe is PERFECT for the part.  First off, the part of Jim has to be played by a very masculine, Rebel Without a Cause type of guy.  He must also be comfortable with homosexual kissing.  During last nights audition, Brad and I had chemistry that  blew everyone away.  His acting was top notch and his sex appeal was off the charts.  He has blond hair, steel blue eyes, and a ripped body.  He is taller than me and manjust looks SO good.  Guys with lean, muscular bodies do not turn me on, usually.  I go for BIG and BEEFY.  But Brad has so much charisma and appeal that I know I speak for both Kelly and Megan when I say that we all wanted to drink his cum.  Once we had finished, the three of us went to have a drink at a nearby bar.  We were all FLOORED by the amount of talent this kid has, combined with the chemistry that he and I had during our reading.  It was a bit overwhelming.  Tonight, we audition 10-15 more guys, but I know we all breathe a little easier knowing that if none of them work out, Brad is a shoo in for the part.  He is currently doing an off-Broadway show and just finished shooting a film on Sunday.  Impressive, but intimidating.  I left Kelly and Megan at the bar and went over to Pauls place to get ready to go out.  However, the whole audition experience left me a bit shaken.  I felt emotions that I havent felt in 3 years.  The passion in my gut for performance was lit up.  I started to realize that being an actor is who I am.  And for the last 3 years I have been doing everything in my power to run away from that.  I started to cry.  Kelly arrived at Pauls apartment an hour later and I immediately pulled her into the bathroom for a quick talk.   I told her of my fears and doubts of becoming an actor again.  I told her that I felt as though my world was turning upside down and that for the first time in my life, I was truly SCARED.  You see, I am a good actor.  I know it.  I feel real emotions when I say the lines.  I BELIEVE in what is happening in the scene as though it were real life.  Its a lot to be confronted with after such a long hiatus.  Kelly hugged me and told me that she understood and that she will be with me throughout the entire process.  But for the rest of the night, I was off.  I was confronted with my old life and while part of me wanted to run away from it, part of me wanted to grasp onto it for dear life.  I dont want to be Joe CuttheShit pseudo-actor, man-eater, smoker/boozer.  I want to be Joe CuttheShit focused actor, hard worker, honest soul.  Anysnoodle, we all arrived at Beige/B-Bar/Bowery Bar, etc. at 10pm.  Tons of different names for the same place.  Joining me in my first Gay Pride outing was Paul, Kelly, Mariah, and Pauls roommate Jen.  B-Bar has a patio in the back that allows smoking, so we immediately started walking back to that area.  As we rounded the front bar, I bumped my arm into one of the waiters arms.  He turned around and dropped one of the drinks he was carrying onto the floor.  Somehow, he thought that Kelly did it.  He looked her in the face and then launched the other drink on his tray right into her face.  It landed on her toes and then smashed all over the floor.  We were SHOCKED.  Suddenly there was an uproar.  Mariah, Paul, and I all started freaking out.  What the FUCK do you think you are doing?  You dont THROW drinks at customers!  Are you fucked up in the head?!?!  It was crazy, chaotic, and rather exciting.  A manager ran over, talked to Kelly about what happened and then told the waiter to go upstairs and change his clothes.  We are pretty sure he was fired.  The manager then gave Kelly 7 free drink tickets and apologized profusely.  Kelly handled it all with style and grace.  But Mariah and Paul were furious for a long while after.  The whole situation was really fucked up and I just stood there saying Why is it that EVERY time we go out, something completely out of control happens?!?!  We downed some vodka tonics and talked our faces off.  Paul was absolutely adorable.  I bought him a rose and he about burst into tears with sheer joy.  As Mariah and I were taking a trip to the bathroom, this is the conversation we had:  Mariah:  Paul is so in love with you.  He was just telling me how he is so glad that you are giving him a second chance. Joe:  Mariah, I dont think I want to be with Paul anymore. Mariah:  What do you mean?  You just gave him a rose!  He is really trying hard to be the boyfriend you want him to be. Joe:  I know I keep saying that if he just changes his ways, our relationship will be so much better, but the truth of the matter is that I dont know if I want a boyfriend at all anymore.  Its not Pauls fault.  At this stage in my life, I think I just want to be single and free.  Independent and able to do what I want. Mariah:  What about Ahmad? Joe:  Ahmad is a great guy too, but I dont want a relationship with him.  I want to kiss and date and talk to lots of boys.  I have never really had the opportunity to do that freely and I think now is the time.  Mariah totally understood where I was coming from, but it was hard for both of us to watch Paul work overtime trying to make me happy.  Fortunately, that didnt last too long as Paul and I got in a screaming match at Rays Pizza and I left to go back to his apartment alone.  I remember calling him ugly and reminding him that the friends that we went out with were my friends and not his.  It was a terrible scene and my acid tongue got the best of me again.  Paul was a dickhead back, but he is never as cruel as I can be.    I arrived at Pauls apartment before Mariah, Kelly and Paul did.  When I got to his pad, I had another glass of wine and hung out with Jen and Lisa.  Eventually the rest of the group showed up and we smoked and laughed and had a good time.  It was as though the whole Rays Pizza confrontation never happened.  Everyone got ready to go to sleep at 2am.  Paul was already passed out in his bed.  Without saying goodbye to him, I packed up my shit and went home.  It wasnt that Paul had done anything wrong.  In fact the only person that had a big fat mean mouth last night, was me.    I am in a place of confusion right now and I find myself doing and saying things that seem so out of character for me.  Yet, I do them because I feel as though I need to start trusting my instincts a bit more.  I have to allow myself to grow and change and make mistakes.  If leaving Pauls place at 2am without saying goodbye is what I needed to do, then that is what I needed to do.  If I was unnecessarily mean to him, then I was unnecessarily mean to him.  I am not saying it was appropriate at all.  But if thats how I felt in the moment, then I resolve to be confident in my decisions.    I am so hard on myself every day for stupid shit and its time I started LIVING.  People fuck up all the time and I want to stop criticizing and watching my every move.    As I have said over and over for the last couple of entries, I need to focus on me and stop worrying what everyone else in my life is going to think about it.  I have a great group of friends.  Its time I started trusting in them.    Tonight is the big audition!  Hoping it goes as well as last night.    Wow.  Look at me acting again!  Baby steps.  Baby steps all the way to fame.

       HAPPY GAY PRIDE WEEK!   YAY!  This is one of my most favorite weeks of the year.  Its like the one time when you can truly be proud to be a gay and also get away with drinking yourself into an oblivion every night.  And all in the name of gayness!    ROCK.  Tonight I am off to Beige, one of the citys gay hot spots for a Tuesday night.  Also, they have a patio in the back where you are allowed to smoke cigarettes.  That is like unheard of these days.  So, tonight around 11pm, picture me kicking back with my fellow Homos, toasting to a week of cruising, drinking, and full out debauchery.  Slurp it up baby!  SLURP-IT-UP!   This weekend with my parents was fucking fantastic.  We laughed so hard and so often.  They were overly generous with my birthday gifts, as usual.  I mean, I know Im going to be 26 and all, but I love opening my presents as though I just turned 8.  I think they also get a kick out of seeing me revert back to my childhood, when everything I said was Just what I always wanted or Oh cool!  Can I play with it now?  The weekend flew by and I was pretty sad to have to say goodbye to them on Sunday.  If I could have had the birthday present of my dreams, it would be for them to live much closer.  I still look forward to the day when my entire family can get together every Sunday for a big family meal.  But until Winfield comes back to the states, there is no chance of that happening.  We did talk about him a lot this weekend and for the most part, it was very positive.  Only a few tears were shed.  And they were cleansing, good tears.  It was really nice to be with two people who know what it truly feels like to have Winfield away.  As much as my friends are there for me, its impossible for them to fully understand how I feel.  But with my parents, they get it.  I dont have to say anything about the situation as its always on all of our minds.  And if you need a hug, you dont have to ask for one.  There are arms around you before you even get the chance to let the first tear fall.    In total, it was a beautiful weekend with them.   So..we may have a bit of a problem.    Ahmad has returned from his conference.    While he was gone, Paul and I had a really great week together.  He is being extra adorable and putting in overtime when it comes to our relationship.  We arent fighting nearly as much and when he senses that I am upset, he immediately works on correcting the situation.  He has gotten more time off from work so that we can spend time together and he doesnt act as careless with my feelings as he used to.  I am floored at the change in his attitude.  And mostly, I am happy being with him.    But  As I said, Ahmad has returned home.  He had a great conference and came back ready to continue where we left off.  When he e-mailed me yesterday morning, my stomach immediately clenched in worry and dread.  I had forgotten how close he and I got before he left.  Now, granted, he was only gone for 10 days, but in that amount of time, I have been known to have full blown relationships and moved on to my next conquest.  Unfortunately for Ahmad, the relationship I had in the last 10 days was with my boyfriend.  The one I have been with for 3 and a half years.  The one that I am still in love with.  Right before Ahmad left, we had the following conversation:  Ahmad:  Joe, I want to bring something up to you. Joe:  Sure.  Whats up? Ahmad:  Sometimes when I am with you, I feel as though I am the other guy and I dont know how comfortable I am with that. Joe:  You feel that way because you ARE the other guy.  There is nothing more I can say about it. Ahmad:  Am I always going to be the other guy? Joe:  As of right now, yes.  Who knows about the future. Ahmad:  Do you not want to talk about it anymore? Joe:  Not especially. Ahmad:  Then we wont.  After having this quick dialogue, I could tell that he was a bit upset.  But there is nothing I can do about that.  I cant give him any false hope that he and I are going to jump into a relationship.  I still want Paul.  And even more than I want Paul, I want to be single and independent.  Most people take months or years to bounce back into their single life.  I feel like I have been bouncing back into it slowly for the last year.  The last thing I want to do is have a relationship with ANYONE else.  Ahmad included.  Sure, time can change that, but for now, I am putting the focus back on myself.  Paul can come along for the ride, but no one else.   At (almost) 26 years old, its about time to put the focus back on me.    When Ahmad and I spoke on the phone today, he asked me what we would be doing together for Gay Pride Week.  I explained to him that I am already booked up for the most part, but I could fit him in somewhere this weekend.  My biggest fear is that he is going to show up at one of the bars I am at.  This is my fear, because most likely, Paul will be accompanying me wherever I go.  At least until Friday night.  Then he has to work all weekend.  I told Ahmad where I was going out tonight and IMAGINE if he shows up there while I am with Paul?  I will probably have a heart attack while spewing vomit out of my mouth and diarrhea out of my ass.  Im in no way ready for THAT confrontation.    Plus, in some ways, I want neither of them to go out with my friends and me.  I would LOVE to meet a new guy tonight.  As we all know, I am in the midst of a game called Sluts or Bust and I am not getting many points hanging out with these two bwahs.  Tonights bar should definitely net me some hotties.  But not if my ballS and chainS show up.  ManI am a pathetic, selfish, asshole.  And I love it.  Ahmad got me presents while he was in Vegas.  He had mentioned to me that he was going to try to get me a robe from the Ritz Carlton (where he was staying).  When he told me how much one of those robes cost, I told him to NEVER EVER spend that kind of money on me.  (knot in my stomach) I think he still got it for me.  As much as I am excited to see what he is going to get me for my birthday, (knot in stomach) I wont accept anything too extravagant.  Cuz then I would feel as though I owe him something.  And I aint owing anyone shit just because I am cute, adorable, and fun.  Right?  Right.  Wish me luck, my people!    One more word about the donation thing  THANK YOU to everyone who sent us a payment.  You MADE my day yesterday.  And are totally helping us reach our goals.  We will be taking donations until the first weekend of October, so dont worry that it will ever be too late for you to send us a gift.  Howeverpleaseand I mean PLEASEunderstand that no one in any way should feel guilted or obligated into giving us a dime.  I am given so much love from this journal daily and I appreciate that more than anything.  I just figured that, while I have the outlet available to me, I might as well try and take advantage of it.  Right?  Sassy sends mugs, Eelnahs sends CDs, Joe begs you for your money.  It really is a nice system we got goin.  I just appreciate all of your love and support so much.  The donation thing was just a long shot.  And of course I will keep everyone posted as to how it all goes!  The auditions are tomorrow night!  YAY and also HORK!  (a bit nervous)  Enjoy the sun!    And if its raining where you live, you probably deserve it.  Its been raining in NYC for weeks.     YAY GAY PRIDE!

       We interrupt the regular scheduled blog posts, to bring you something of the utmost importance(!):   During the first two weeks of October, Joe CuttheShit will be performing in his first show EVER in NYC.  The show is called "Stupid Kids" and will be done by the theater company owned and operated by my housemate Kelly.  Considering that this is a new theater company, they have to do massive amounts of fund raising in order to rent a space, pay for royalties, pay for lights, pay for music, pay pay pay.  There is so much paying it makes my heads spin.  (heads meaning my big head and my little head  Big Joe and little joe)  We have already written a fund raising letter that is currently being mailed out to everyone we know.  The letter details the mission statement of the company, the process that took them through their first production, and it also promotes the upcoming shows.   And I must say, it is PRETTY classy.    Keep in mind that this company put on a production at the end of April that was a smashing success.  We are hoping that this next show will outdo the first one by leaps and bounds.  As Kelly and her partner gain more experience, the shows will blossom into even more extravagant pieces of theater.  This time, I will be helping them out as much as I can.  My focus is on the show and on the company.  I want us to be able to put up an excellent work of art.  And I am confident that we will.  SO  On the right hand side of my page, there is a Make A Donation button.  Yes (load groan), this post is soliciting you for money.  Please understand that I would NEVER EVER ask anyone for anything unless I felt that it was a worthy cause and also impossible for us to achieve our goals without it.  The royalties alone cost $360 ($60 per performance).  This is just one of the many costs we will encounter over the next couple of months.  I came up with the idea of placing a PayPal button (It is the safest and easiest way to donate money on the net!) on my site in the hopes that we would raise (even) a measly $20 from it.    Now, I understand that everyone is strapped for cash and I understand that most of you have never met me in person.  So why would I think that I deserve any of your money?  Well, frankly, I dont.  And part of me thinks its rude to ask.  However, theater is my passion and hopefully my inevitable career.  You would not only be supporting the company, you would be supporting my dream.    Any amount of money is GRACIOUSLY accepted.  That means if you donate $1.50, I would jizz all over myself in excitement.  If you donate $550, welldont.  I would drown in the amount of jizz that would come out of my cock and balls.  I dont have much to offer you as a thank you for donating your hard-earned money to this endeavor, but I can promise you that if you donate over $10, I will put your name in our program as a PATRON OF THE ARTS.  And I will even mail you a copy of the program so you can hold onto it as evidence that you are a caring and supportive person.  And most importantly, you will take some of the worry and stress away from planning this whole process and replace it with happiness, love, and excitement.    Please understand that you dont have to donate a single cent.  Please understand that no amount is too low.  And most importantly, please understand that I would never ask for anything I wasnt desperate for.  Its not like this site is  urlLink Save Karen  and Im asking you to bail me out of my over-spending immaturity.  Although maybe I will do that during my next post.  (snicker, snicker)    No donation is small enough.    If you are offended at all by me coming onto my site and becoming a beggar, please know that this is the only time I will ever do something like this.  Its just very important that we get this show off the ground.  Not only for the company, but for me.  This show is the platform I need to jump start my career.    Thank you to everyone for reading this.  Youve already done a lot by sitting through this whole thing.    BLING BLING dawgs!    (ok, never bling bling)  Adios.

      So, I've spent the majority of the morning thinking that  urlLink Cati Fabulous  was hurt by me.  I would never intentionally hurt any of you bloggers.  I don't even know most of you, so I can't see how hurting you is even possible.  But when I thought that she was upset with me, I wrote this whole sad, introduction to my post today.  Then I had to go back and fix it, cuz she swears that it's not me that hurt her feelings.  Can I just tell you how relieved I feel now?  The pit that was resting like a rock of despair in my stomach has finally eased up.  And phew.  I take things so personally sometimes, it's scary.    Ive been known to have a bad temper.  Actually, it doesnt flare up very often, but when it does, it consumes me in a way that I am totally embarrassed and uncomfortable with.  Last night for instance, Paul and I had plans to go to a nice dinner.  We hadnt been out to dinner in over a week and I was really excited to sit and have a nice, quiet meal.  He and I arrived at the restaurant at around 8pm and Mariah joined us for a bit, but had to leave by 9pm due to a rehearsal for an upcoming show.  Its very rare for Paul, Mariah, and I to have any time for just the three of us and I cherish those moments greatly.  While ordering the appetizers, the three of us got into a discussion about how important it is to spend some personal time with the people that you love.    At that moment, Pauls roommates, Jen and Lisa, were walking by the restaurant and Paul got up to go say hi to them.  (Keep in mind that we hang out with Jen and Lisa ALL the time, cuz they are constantly at his apartment)  I say to Paul as he is leaving to talk to the girls, Please dont bring them in here.  The three of us are doing our own thing tonight.  Paul nods his head and leaves.  Five minutes later, Paul enters back into the restaurant with Jen and Lisa in tow.  Mariah pinches my leg, cuz we had JUST had the conversation about how it was nice that the three of us were having a mealjust the three of us.   As they are all taking their seats at our table, the fury of the INCREDIBLE HULK, fills me and instead of busting out of my clothes into a mass of green muscle, I kick Pauls chair HARD from underneath the table.  In fact, I kicked it so hard that the glasses and silverware made this upsettingly loud clinking noise and I realized that I had exposed my anger to everyone at the table.  Paul handled it very well and didnt make a comment about what I had just done.  I sat there, frustrated at him for bringing them into the restaurant and frustrated at myself for getting so irrationally worked up about it.  Within 10 minutes or so I had squashed the fury and we all had a good time.   As Paul and I were walking home later on in the evening, he grabbed my arm and apologized for what he had done.  By that point, I had realized that I had gotten angry over something very stupid.  I explained to him that I was confused as to why he brought them in and that I was also sorry for kicking his chair so violently under the table.  He kissed me on the cheek and told me that It was okay.  But in my mind, it wasnt.  I try not to screw up often and when I do, I carry it with me for a long time.  I just hate making myself look like a psycho.    So whatever, it was over and done with and no one was any the wiser.  But it reminded me that I still have work to do on controlling my reaction to things that I dont like.  Trust me, I have come a long way in curbing my acid laced tongue.  No one is perfect and I have to understand that I have made some progress.  But it sucks to know that I still have more progress to make.    BUT WHY DID HE BRING JEN AND LISA BACK IN WITH HIM?!?!    Just cuz.  Thats why.  Just cuz.  argh.  ErI meanyay!  Barf.  I guess thats all I have to say today.  I am excited to go home.  I am excited to get out of the city for a couple of days.  I am excited to just get away.  Next week is GAY PRIDE and we have so many plans for it that I think I will fall into a homo-induced coma by the time next Sunday rolls around.    Hope everyone has a nice weekend.    Drink too much, eat too much, stay up late, and be thankful for the friends you have.

      We will begin with the disturbing dream that I had last night.    (Ritayou may want to avoid the beginning part of this entry as it will be all too familiar for you) (No, seriously) and  (Kelly, another horrifying dream about the cats)  In the dream, Paul and I are hanging out at my apartment in Times Square.  I remember the TV being on and that we were sitting on my bed.  We had been commissioned to watch over Kellys cat, Trey, and our friend Angies cat, Alex.  Paul and I were goofing off when all of a sudden we heard a loud crash come from out in the living room.  I jump up and run out to the living room to find Alex laying on the ground with his body all twisted and mangled.  Trey, was sitting next to him and crying.  There were little cat tears coming out of his eyes.  I run over to Alex and see that he can barely lift his head.  It looks to me like his spine is broken.    Paul comes running out of the bedroom behind me and gasps when he sees Alex.  Trey starts to pace around Alex and he licks him on the face.  Alex just turns his head from side to side, whimpering.    Paul says: What happened?? Joe:  I dont know.  I think he fell off the fridge or something.  It looks like his back is broken.  Is he going to die? Paul:  I think so, Joe.  But probably slow and painful. Joe:  Should we take him to the hospital?  Should I call an ambulance or something? Paul:  Joe, its too late.  He would die before we got him to the hospital. Joe:  Then what do we do??  I cant stand to see him suffering like this. Paul:  Ill take care of it.  You go back in the bedroom.   Joe:  No.  I will stay here with you.  Trey is crying and he needs me. Paul:  Fine.  But turn your head.  Paul goes to the bedroom and returns with a baseball bat.    Joe:  What are you going to do?!? Paul:  I have to end his suffering.  I told you to walk away. Joe:  I cant!  I cant leave him! Paul:  Its your choice.  And with that, Paul raises the bat in the air and brings it down right on top of Alexs skull.  Brains and blood splatter all over the walls and on to Treys face.  Trey starts to cry even harder and it sounds like the voice of a baby.  I fall to my knees next to Alexs smooshed head.  Paul returns to the bedroom with the baseball bat.  Trey walks over to the couch and begins to lick off the brains and blood from his fur.  I start to cry while sitting there looking at dead Alex.    END DREAM.  I woke up to my alarm and Paul asking Whats wrong?  Youve been thrashing about on the bed all night.  I told him about my dream and he said SNORE.  (Damn me for ever teaching him that word)  He scratched my back while I had my first cigarette of the morning and I tried my best to get the image of Alexs smooshed head out of my mind.    Overall I feel much better today.  I spent last night hanging out with Kelly and puttering around in my apartment.  Paul came over around 11:30pm and brought me french fries from McDonalds.  They were really good and gave me an exceptional shit this morning.  He was so adorable last night and I realized (once again) that I love him dearly.  I want only him.  I have to break up with Ahmad again .  Somebody slap me in the nuts please.  One day I want one thing and the next I want something different.  Ah well.  Im sure Ahmad will give me a super nice birthday present, so I will keep him around long enough for that.  Sike!  And if you thought I was serious, then you dont know me at all.  Gold digging is so pase.    Very excited to go home this weekend.  My parents and I are celebrating Fathers Day and my birthday all in one!  Friday night we will play cards and drink and smoke pot, as per our usual Friday night plan.  Saturday we will go out to dinner at an all you can eat buffet.  (NYC doesnt have those and I LOVE them) (Whos up for a plate filled with french fries piled to the ceiling?)  After dinner we are off to the harness track to drink some beers and bet on horses.  Back in the day I used to be the biggest advocate for animal rights and wouldnt have imagined EVER supporting an equestrian track.  Now that Im older, I love drinking beer and hanging out with my parents too much to give a damn about the horses feelings.  Sure its tough to be whipped all day and to run around a dirt track.  But do they ever have to deal with being called a fag?  I think not.    Faggot horses.  I am totally saying that to their faces when I see them on Saturday.    Auditions for the show I am doing are next Wednesday.  Remember that the show is called  urlLink Stupid Kids (brief synapsis at this link) .  Kelly and I are playing Kimberly and Neechee respectively.  We still have to cast the role of Jim.  This is a big deal on so many levels.  Most importantly for me, its the guy I have to make out with in the show.  So, of course, I hope he is motha fuckin hotttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt!  Hot with 37 Ts.  My part in the show is that of a little, flaming, gothic, emotionally tormented, 17 year old boy.  The part of Jim is a rebel, overly masculine, macho, ego driven, 17 year old MAN.  My character falls in love with him and wants to form some sort of a love-based relationship.  Jim aint havin it.  Cuz hes a straight.  Or IS he?  Thats the beauty of the play.  And I get to tongue him on stage.  Amazing.  My parents and friends of my family will have a heart attack.  But that makes me want to do it so much more.  SHOCK VALUE.  Guess what everyone?  Not only is Joe a homosexualhe kisses and humps boys on stage too!  What TALENT he possesses.    Rock.  Alrightoff to my daily nap.  Gonna grab a bite to eat, shit it out in 10 minutes and go lay down for a nice summers catnap.    Snore me a river.

      My brother called me at work this morning.  Its been over a month since I last heard his voice and I was overwhelmed to hear it today.  He called me a couple of weeks ago at 6am at my apartment, but I had spent the night at Ahmads and unfortunately missed that call.  Every day when I walk into my apartment and see the answering machine light blinking, I get a tinge of worry that he has called and for whatever reason, I have missed it.  But today, I got to talk to him.  He was calling from a satellite phone somewhere inside of Baghdad.  Knowing that I only have a few short moments to talk to him, I tried to ask as many questions as I could, questions that I know my parents would want the answers to.  He only had 10 minutes to be on the phone with me and for most of it, the reception cut out and I couldnt hear what he was saying.  There is also a major delay on everything that I say to him so he has to pause in the conversation to wait for my response.  It is frustrating and exciting and upsetting all at the same time.  In the last four months my brother has lost 22 pounds.  He entered Baghdad weighing 173 and currently he is at 141.  His skin is pasty white, but his hands are the darkest tan he has ever had!  He is both physically and mentally exhausted.  When I asked him how things were going with his men, he said, Weve lost a few in combat.  But Im still okay Joe.  No need to worry.    No need to worry?  People are dying around you and Im not supposed to be freaking out?  I maintained as much composure as I could.  I tried to be upbeat and I tried to sound as though everything with my life is fine.  And comparatively, it is.  As our conversation came to a close, something inside of me broke free.  The tears started flowing out of my face as I realized that I wouldnt be talking to him again for a while.  He says he will try to call me on my birthday, but you never know.  As I started crying, so did he and he kept saying over and over Ill be home soon.  Be happy.  I love you so much.  Everything is fine.  My sobs began to take over and it took every ounce of strength in my body to give him an audible I love you too.  I hung up the phone and left my office building.  I walked up the street and crouched in a doorway to smoke a cigarette.  Eventually I was able to get myself under control, but as I type this, I still feel this sadness sitting directly on top of my heart.  A huge lump resting in my throat.    I have tried so hard to put Winfield out of my mind.  My parents have let this thing take over their life and I refuse to do that.  I can barely find the energy to get out of bed in the morning, much less sit around thinking about, worrying about, and missing my brother.  He is everything to me, but I dont have the emotional courage to focus on it.  I have worked so hard to make the last month and a half of my life happy.  Then a 10-minute talk with my brother turns my world upside down.  Gotta put him out of mind, as much as I hate doing it.  Im going to go get a drink of water and smoke another cigarette.  Maybe say a prayer for him.  Maybe shed one more tear in order to feel the release of all of this pent up sadness.

      Its funny.  When you work at a University job, the summers are filled with mindless projects and hours of utter boredom.  So, in order to occupy my time, I have decided to find myself a  urlLink Prison Pen Pal .   urlLink Kambri Crews  had the link on her site yesterday and I decided that that was just about the best idea ever.  So for the last two hours I have contacted my favorite prisoners and let them know that I want to be their friend.  Upon telling my mom about my new venture, she said, Why dont you take that time to write to your brother in Iraq.  I replied Nah.    The two guys I picked as my pen pals are buff and HOT.  One of them is bisexual and the other is straight.  One is in jail for robbery and the other is in jail for homicide.  Yesthis was the best idea I have ever had ever.  I can only hope that these boys will get out of jail, come find my family and me and brutally murder us all.  HOTT!  In other newsI began using  urlLink Trim Spa  today.  This product is supposed to increase your metabolism while fighting to decrease fat pockets.  The bottle also said that it is an appetite suppressant.  So this morning, I took one pill (instead of the recommended 2) and have found myself more ravenous than usual.  Maybe its my metabolism speeding up.  Or maybe its all in my head and I just spent $40 on horse pills for nothing.  HOTT!  My birthday is on July 2nd.  (I am a die-hard cancer-through and through)  I am going to be 26 years old.  YIPES.  I thought 25 was bad, but 26 is like 30 which is like 50 which is like death in a body.   In all honesty, I have yet to truly care about turning another year older.  Maybe that anxiety will come in time, but so farI could care less if I am 26 or 57.  As long as I always have baby smooth skin on my face and on my ass.  And as long as I can always jerk on my penis as though its made of rubber.  Hairy rubber.  Each year my friends do something amazing for me for my birthday.  Up until 2 years ago, I was always thrown a surprise party.  Tons of my friends would get together and we would rock out in one way or another.  Sometimes it was booze filled, sometimes it was cake and ice cream filled.  Okay, it was only cake and ice cream filled before I turned 21.  Two years ago, once the parties stopped coming, Kelly and her ex-girlfriend, Angie, in conjunction with Paul, took me to the Crown Plaza Hotel for the night.  I snorted lines of coke the entire time and we all had a blast.  I have to admit the only part of the night that I wasnt too fond of was the coke.  And I have yet to touch the stuff since.     urlLink Last year , Kelly and Rita planned the day and we all went to dinner and drinks and opened tons of presents and I even went to a psychic during the day.  It was one of the best days that I have had in my entire life.  I remember sitting at dinner and saying: I dont even want to drink alcohol!  I am having such a good time being sober with all of the people that I love!  Mariah was there, Ari was there, Angie, Kelly, and Rita were there, and it was wonderful.    But this year is going to be different.    Everyone is kinda poor now.  And our group of friends has split into so many different directions.  Since it is now June 17 and no one has mentioned my birthday to me, I have decided to take the matter into my own hands.  It is up to me to plan the celebration.  And you know what?  Thats okay.  For years I havent had to plan my own birthday, so Im due.    I decided to work at my job during the day of my birthday.  Usually I would take the day off, but I had such a great time being in the office last year that I figured why not do it again?  I have off the 3rd and 4th, so no need to take the 2nd as well.    Wednesday night, the day of my birthday, I am going to spend the evening with Paul.  I am leaving the entire night up to him, which is probably a very risky thing to do.  Paul is terrible with planning ANYTHING and I am hoping to high heaven that he doesnt fuck this night up.  It means the world to me to be able to spend the night with him.  I havent spent a birthday alone with him since the year we first got together.  It could be a beautiful night or a terrible night.  Its all dependent upon how much he truly cares about me.  Thursday I have off from work, so I am hoping that Kelly and Angie and maybe Mariah will plan some fun stuff for us to do during the day.  (HINT,HINT GIRLS!)  Thursday night I want everyone to meet at my apartment for a few drinks before we hit the town!  Im talking going out to some fun gay bars!  So probably Splash bar and maybe The Roxy or something.  I want us to drink a lot, stay up late, smoke the pot, and have a wonderful time altogether.  In my wildest dreams, I want all of us to crash at the same location, whether thats at Mariahs apartment in Brooklyn, a hotel room, or crammed into my tiny apartment in Times Square.  On Friday, the 4th of July, I hope that we will all wake up together and have some breakfast while laughing and giggling about the previous nights activities.  Some time around 2ish, I hope that all of us will go to a local park to have a picnic.  Im talking hamburgers, hot dogs, cheeseburgers, and if Paul is theresome of his famous BBQ ribs.  I want to cook and lay out in the sun, drink some beers, and be with the people that I love the most.  (cept for Rita, who wont be able to come.  But more about that in a sec.)   After our picnic is over, I would like our little party to continue to the fireworks.  This is the first 4th of July that I have spent in NYC and I am pretty excited about it.  I have spent the last two 4ths in Boston with Mariah and Paul.  This year, I dont have to leave the city to see themthey are here with me!  After the fireworks and a beautiful day together, I hope that we will all slap on some smiles and go back out to the bars.    And thats it.  Saturday and Sunday of that week will be meant for detoxing and masturbating.    Doesnt that sound like fun?    Do you think people will want to come to this get together?  Its always hard to plan things for my birthday, cuz a lot of people go away for the 4th of July weekend.  But I am hoping that people love me enough to stick around this year.  Time will tell.  The only downfall is that my Rita wont be able to be with us.  But she has offered to buy my bus ticket to Syracuse for the following weekend!  That way I can finally see her again and be with her in her new home.  And it will be just us!  Hanging out, talking and laughing and singing and being best friends.  If it werent for her offer of a free visit, I would be extremely saddened by her absence at my party.    And thats that!  Sorry for the very informative, not really entertaining, post today.  I had to get all of my ideas about my birthday down on paper so that I can get it straight (ergay) in my head.  Invitations will be going out by the end of today.  YAY!  HOORAY!  BOOM BALAY!  SNORE McCRAY!  ANY OTHER WORD THAT RHYMES WITH A!  Thats it!  I hope everyone has a nice Tuesday.  Two weeks from tomorrow, the extravaganza begins!  What are YOU going to get me?

       Your smell intoxicates me, The yellow of your skin, the freckles of your spice The luxury of gripping you in my hands.  In moments of sadness  you are there In moments of elation you are there An object of desire and dependence.   Years have passed; your body has changed, Your flavor and variety Has only grown with age.  My children will know you as The father they never knew A life made complete by your inexistence.  Lovers will come and go Flitting in and out of my life through fickle hopes Driving me back to your consistent smile.  It is only now that I can see  The ramifications of loving you  too much. The reality of letting you run my life.  Pizza, today I say goodbye to you.      This Weekend   Had an incredible time.  So much fun in fact that it was 8pm Sunday night before I realized that the fun was finally over.  Went out drinking on both Friday and Saturday nights and was up until 5am each evening.  Slept very minimally, as I had to get up and go to brunch on both Saturday and Sunday mornings.  Man, it was serious fun.  Today my eyes are a bit swollen shut from lack of rest.  I plan to catch up on that this week.   Ahmad   Is away on business until Friday.  Since I am going home to Albany this weekend, I will not see him until at least Tuesday of next week.  I miss him a tad bit, but definitely needed to get some perspective while he is away on his trip.  Got an email from him this morning and he sounded pretty good.  I got hard when I read some of what he wrote.   Paul     Has been pretty exceptional over the last couple of days.  It doesnt change how I feel about anything right now, but it was nice to know that he could treat my friends with respect.  He hasnt always been so congenial in the past, but Saturday night he was a gem.  And last night, he was more than a gem.  He was funny, patient, helpful, kind, and more than a boyfriend.  He was my man.   Kellys, Ex-girlfriend, Angie   Had an AMAZING time with her this weekend.  Her 6-month trip to Mexico fucked her up a bit.  She is slowly acclimating to her old life again and it was good to see that she hasnt lost some of the wonderful things that make up who she is.  She is growing and changing as an adult, but I do feel very lucky and proud to be a part of it still.   Cheeseburgers   Had one for brunch on Saturday, one for dinner on Saturday night, and one for brunch on Sunday.     My Shoes     Are on their last legs.  There is no suspension left in the heel and I am almost embarrassed to be seen tripping all over them.  I found a pair at Payless for $20, but decided to wait and buy them this week.  Now my right ankle is starting to hurt.  If it rains, my foot gets soaked and then makes SQUIT, SQUIT, SQUIT sounds every time I take  step.     Phlegm   Gallons of it resting comfortably inside my throat.     $10   The amount of money I had to pay to get into  Jeckyll and Hyde  (one of the WORST bars in Manhattan) because the hostess refused to believe that I am a homosexual.     Amaryllis   Bought one for Paul yesterday as a Thank you for his generosity when taking out my friends on Saturday night.     463   The amount of drinks I had this weekend.     3,249   The amount of cigarettes I smoked.   4   The number of joints I took part in.   All of them   The number of joints that I took part in that were rolled from my pot.   Not Another Teen Movie   Saw it again last night and decided that I MUST own it.  So funny.  SEW SEW SEW funny.   Rachel   Told her roommate, (and one of my best friends) Mariah, that she was fat and ugly and that she Wouldnt be caught dead with Mariah if she didnt change the outfit she had on for the  Spooky Ooky Pub Crawl .    Rachel was SO mean and cruel to Mariah that despite a very determined effort on her part, Mariah ended up bursting into tears in front of the entire group.  Then I started to cry, because I cant STAND seeing Mariah cry.  Then Rachel got angry that we were both crying and took off her costume and refused to go out with us.  After an hour of coaxing and 10 minutes of me begging and pleading with her, Rachel agreed to go out.  Of course, an hour into the evening, Rachel threw a HUGE temper tantrum and refused to drink or dance or talk to any of us.  She sat in the corner for the rest of the night.    Must I say it again? I fucking hate that bitch.  So, my birthday is coming!!  WOOO HOOOOO!  Will definitely get into that topic tomorrow.  So much planning to do and so much fun to be had.  I have already planned out the entire thing in my head, minute by minute.    Tune in tomorrow for the great and exciting details.  Have a fast fucking Monday!

      I just re-read that post in my typical anal style and thought:  Please Joe don't write when you're wasted anymore.  Please Joe?  Please?  You make no sense and your mind wanders please?    Member about please?  You said one time you would do it please?  Please goes very well with carrots.    Cuz pweas and carrots.    For a long time I       please  fucking please  PLEASE  Did you say please?   please.  Yeah man.  Please.   ***I call this "Waiting for Gadoot".  I mean...is there a  reason to get it?  I mean...is there?  (I run away now)

      HOLY SHIT WOW!    Joe is posting during the weekend!    It is late late late on Friday night and I am way way wasted.  So many drinks, so many conversations, so many snores.  Which leads me to the reason I stop into this journal tonight.    I always check my site.  We all do.  Right?  I mean, we do.  You click on it, you check your comments, you get in those modes where you stop by your sitemeter account every 10 minutes.  I mean we all do it and I am the first to tell you that I never have.    Cept I always do.  Tonight when I came home and happened to GLANCE by my site...I was a little shaken up.  You people care.  You do.  And you know me.  I've never met (almost) any of you and the things you write to me are so in tune and on point.  It blows my mind.    I have two types of readers.    I have those who leave comments, the way you all do (the people I am writing this post to).   And I have those that for the most part, have been with me from the beginning, but never make their voice known except through emails.    I cherish both aspects.  So much so.  The point of all of this is ...er...this: (this this and this)  You all made me feel really great about myself tonight.  You made me feel important.  I am gushing and it's unsightly for a woman to do that...but...well...(boner sticking out)...I love you all.    T-bone signs "Latas" and "Snores" on my site and I smile HUGELY.   April comes by my site and leaves a comment that is different than any I've gotten from her so far.   I feel like I know her a little bit more by reading her site in depthly over the last week.   And I love it.  April...thank you for laying it out there.  It's brave and it's rare.  Good for you.  And thank you for including us in your recent loss.  It rings true with me.   Rose, Tina, Keol, Meegan, Daisy, Ahmad's Cheerleading section...you understand.  I mean....hahahahaha.  None of you know me and now I feel like king.  Well, gay king.  Don't worry...I still know my place.    Okay...I have so gone overboard.  That's what happens when you "stop by your site" after a few hundred vodka tonics with extra lemon yum does anyone have a vodka tonic with extra lemon I am going to eat the donuts I bought I promised myself I wouldn't eat donuts anymore, but guess what I have powdered AND chocolate                fuckin c ya

      At 11:30pm last night I was taking off my clothes to get into bed with Paul.  Once naked, he and I sat in his living room to have our last cigarette before bed.  We talked a bit and discussed the next days activities.  I finished my cigarette first and went into his bedroom.  There were no lights on in the apartment and the curtains that hang over his open bedroom doors were blowing back and forth grasped in the clutches of the fans oscillation.  I decided to pull a little joke on Paul.  I climbed onto his bed and jumped into a doggie style position, my ass humping the air.  Behind me I hear Paul say Very funny Joe.  Put that ass away.  But to me the joke wasnt over as I stayed in my all fours position.  Eventually I realized that the joke was beating itself into the ground and I scooted back off the bed with a jolt.  The next thing I knew, a lit cigarette was shoved right into my asshole.  I SCREAMED in pain and started feverishly rubbing my rosebud.  The pain was unbearable.  Behind me I hear Paul apologizing over and over and over.  Im SO sorry Joe.  I didnt think you were going to back up so quickly.  Why did you scoot backwards like that??  JOE!  I am SO SORRY!?  Why the FUCK would you stick a burning cigarette near my ass, PAUL!?  WHY?!?!  Oh my GOD you fucking ASSHOLE!  My ass is on FIRE!!!   Joe, pleaseI am so sorry.  I am so so so sorry. SORRY!?!?!?  What possesses a person to stick a lit cigarette into someones asshole!?  How could this have ever happened?!?! I didnt realize you were going to back up.  I didnt mean to hurt you at all. Then what DID you mean to do?  What was the master plan in your head when you thought I am going to stick a lit cigarette in between Joes cheeks?? I am sorry.  Can I do anything to make you feel better? Yes.  Get me some Neosporin so I can slather my asshole with it.  In no way was this story exaggerated.  I sit here right now with the most tender butt hole on the face of the planet.  Paul and I have a history of playing jokes on each other and once in a while a joke goes awry.  In this case, it went very awry.  In fact, its rather ironic that on Wednesday night, Ahmad was sticking his finger into my asshole and I was loving it, and on Thursday night, Paul was sticking his cigarette into my asshole and I was hating it.  A true representation of the relationships I got goin.  Paul felt terrible about it and didnt mean to hurt me.  But this morning as I was taking my shit I cursed the day I ever met him.  I feel as though I shit out a hundred Ginsu knives.  Sheesh.  In other news  Tonight is my friend Joannas birthday.  She has planned an event called The Spooky Ooky Pub Crawl.  Everyone dresses up in spooky costumes and we go to bars like The Slaughter House and Meat Cleaver Mamas and Chop off my pussy spooky place.  Okay, so maybe I made up the last one.  Personally I dont know if I will dress up at all.  I need to get some balls.  I am nervous about dressing up in make-up and a costume and going with a bunch of girls to a bunch of straight bars where no one else will be dressed up.  I knowget some fucking balls Joe.  But I just cant.  Most likely what I will do is put some blood on my mouth and say that I am a gay vampire.  Or maybe I will dress up in my nicest outfit and when people ask me whats so  spooky  about me, I will whip out my dick and say Suck my scary dick.  You know how it goes.  Joanna has no idea that I am going.  Initially I had to go home to Albany this weekend, but then found out that I had the wrong weekend booked on the calendar.  Jo was very disappointed when I told her that I couldnt attend the spookfest, but she handled it all with style and grace.  Mariah and I decided to surprise Joanna and not tell her that I can go afterall.  It was going so well until Kelly called Joanna yesterday and told her that Of course Joe is going.  Hes been talking about it all week!    NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!  Kelly didnt know that I was keeping the secret from Joanna.  I never told Kelly about the plan.  I didnt think I had to, since they very rarely talk.  Luckily, with a little bit of acting skills and a lot bit of guilt, I was able to re-convince Joanna that I am not going out with them tonight.  Crisis averted.  It wasnt Kellys fault at all.  It was mine.     Also, Kellys ex-girlfriend (Angie), who is also a very good friend of mine, is coming into town for a visit!  She has been in Mexico for the last 8 months on an internship.  We are both very excited to have her back in NY.  This weekend is (hopefully) going to be non-stop hilarity and fun.  But also  spooky .   Spooky fun .  Gosh, the inside of my butt is sore.  Good thing Ahmad is going away on business for the next two weeks.  Gives me time to heal.  Paul just called me at work to apologize again for burning my insides.  He also apologized for being a brat last night.  Although Paul has begged me to give him another chance, last night he took every liberty in making me feel like a douchebag.  But when he called this morning and actually apologized for being that way, it made me feel all mushy inside again.  DAMN HIM.  And DAMN ME for falling into the trap on a more than consistent basis.    Kbefore I sign out for the weekend, I want to say two things.  1) If my comments arent working when you come by my site, refresh the page and they will eventually appear.  I have gotten numerous emails asking me what the problem is and all I can say is that Blogger doesnt like me very much.  I hope you can forgive them as well as me for not upgrading to a more appropriate server.    2) Whoever is leaving me the comments from Ahmads Fan Club, I LOVE you for taking the time out to be so creative and adorable.  Yall make me laugh so often, its like I wouldnt be complete without having you there.  This site has taken off into such a wonderful direction and I have you, the reader, to thank for it.    I bless you all with a beautiful and fun weekend.    And I bless me for being so smart, talented, and good looking.    Arent I just the most humble and deserving kid you know?    Yes, Joe!  Yes you are!    (cheering and applause echo throughout the room as Joe takes a bow and leaves.)

      Last night I came up with the best idea for a journal entry, but now I have to scrap it and go in a different direction.  I will save my idea for a day when I have nothing to say.  But today I have so much to say that I should just get into it.    This is me getting into it.   1) I am doing this part time work for a lady in my office.  Its basically data entry work, but the good thing is that I am getting paid $10 an hour for it and alsoget thisit is work I can do from home.  AMAZING.  Its mind numbing work, but when I put in 3 hours of work, I can say that I put in 6 hours of work and who hoo-----payday!  In any case, the woman who is monitoring my work is what I like to call the most terrifying beast from the inner depths of ugly hell.  She has absolutely no social graces whatsoever.  On numerous occasions I have opened her office door and banged her in the head.  You seeit makes sense.  She lies down on the floor when things get too stressful.  Doesnt EVERYONE do that at work??  Anyhobblelast week when she was showing me what to do with my data entry, she horrified me worse than usual.  You see, beast had bitten her cuticle too short and proceeded to smear stripes of blood all over every piece of paper that she touched.  I watched in HORROR as she smeared and wiped and gushed blood all over my work.  I gagged on myself and was shocked that at no point did she seem embarrassed or grossed out by her blood smearing.  She just wiped and leaked all over the place.  On Sunday, when I pulled out the packet of work, I saw that the blood had turned from bright red to brown.  I re-gagged on myself and vowed to never EVER be in the same room alone with this woman again.  I also cut out the pieces of blood from each page of my work.  It was hurting my feelings.    2) I went to get my hair cut today.  I HATE getting my haircut, but it is imperative that I participate in such an activity.  Cant be letting my pretty face be hidden by my pin straight Asian hair.  In any case, when I sat down in the barbers chair, I looked at the mirror and noticed that I had a HUGE whitehead zit resting delicately next to my nose.  WHEN DID I GET THAT?!?  It was SO big and intimidating and I kept thinking Stupid Joe.  Next time look in the mirror BEFORE you go out in public.  When the hairdresser walked away, I took my fingernail and tried as quickly as I could to scratch off that disgusting imperfection.  Unfortunately, the hairdresser returned before I could fully take care of the problem.  For the rest of the hair cut I had blood sitting idly next to my nose.  It was a trashy experience and I left with my head hung low.    Is there a reason why my first too stories are blood filled?  No, but my next story is about how I bled when breaking my hymen.  SIKE.  sorta sike.  3) Last night I had the best sex of my entire life.  Seriously.  Ahmad came over and although I was sick as a dog, he looked so PUMPED from the gym that I immediately had my hands all over his shoulders and arms.  I just couldnt stop myself.  He pulled away a few times, I think because he was trying to hold us back from going farther then we should have.  Unfortunately, when I see a big playground of MUSCLE in front of me, I can do nothing else but climb the monkey bars and take a slide down thewellyou see where this clich is going.  In any case, we made out for over an hour and we stripped each other naked for 20 long and enjoyable minutes.  At one point, Ahmad looks at me and says I have never felt anything so good in my entire life.  I want nothing more than to pick you up in my arms and make love to you.  Ironically enough, I have never had anal sex in my life, but after knowing Ahmad for only 3 weeks, I came so close to doing it with him last night.  When I kissed him I felt pure and utter electricity.  I felt like he was making love to ever inch of my body.  The sweat that poured off our bodies was a sure sign that we had truly let go of our sexual inhibitions.  I rubbed his dick all over my ass region and gave him a taste of what its like to be SO CLOSE to an asshole that you cant fuck.  Over and over he said: You are so warm.  You are so warm.  I love being this close to your body.  And I loved it right back.  Instead of inserting his dick into my ass, Ahmad inserted his finger.  It takes the right moment and the right guy for me to allow anyone inside of me.  I let Ahmad in because he is so MAN and I felt so erotically wonderful in his arms.  After 15 minutes of expert fingering, I exploded (!) in one of the most intense orgasms of my entire life.  Not only do I not cum in hook up situations, if I do, I do it only while I am submersed in fantasyland.   I stayed focused on Ahmad throughout the entire experience and I realized, for the first time, how good sex can really be.  Raw, powerful, and real.    This week I have had amazing sex with both Paul and Ahmad.  Pauls was very emotional because of where were at in our relationship.  Ahmads was sexy and hot and unlike anything I have ever experienced.  Can you see why I feel as though I am a kid in a candy store?  But can you also see why I am nervous to be that kid?  How much longer are both of these guys going to give me their all while I sit back and only give half of myself to each one?  In a selfish way, Im glad.  Its about time that I thought only about myself.  Its about time that I have a little fun.  Its about time that I get to know what its like to be a healthy, sexually active male.  At 25, Ive yet to get to know this side of my personality.  And as I have said over and over in the last paragraphits time.  Its funny.  I havent masturbated in a couple of weeks.  There has been so much touching and kissing and jerking in my life that when I am by myself, I have no desire to play around with my ding dong.  Fucking ding dong.  What I meant to say wasplaying around with my Venus De Milo.    Remember when I was all depressed and suicidal a month or so ago?  What a fucking crybaby I was!  I wish I could go back and slap myself in my crybaby face!  I so deserved some slaps.    sike.  That was a test.  If you agreed with slapping my crybaby face, then now I know that you dont really believe in depression as an actual disease.  Thanks a lot  you .    Thanks a very lot.  Im going to go pull my dick in the bathroom for a bit.  Lord knows I havent had nearly enough action in the last 72 hours.    PEAYCE.

      Hi everyone.  I am a sick kid.  I very rarely get sick and when I do, its like the world falls out from underneath my feet.  Although I had an amazing weekend, I contracted some sort of food poisoning on Saturday night and the sickness rode with me until this morning.  Talk about vomit.  Ive never seen such an ugly color of bile in my entire life.  Over and over I threw up and when I got up to go to work yesterday morning, I realized that I had pulled every muscle in my back.  Thats what retching uncontrollably will do to a person.  Ah well.  I think the best part is that I kicked the stomach thing by this morning, but now I have severe head congestion.  Im talking sneezing every five minutes water eyes head congestion.  GAH.  I am exhausted with being sick.  No more please.    Since last Thursday, so much has happened.  Ahmad has proven himself to be a superstar when it comes to the way he takes care of me.  Manif I say jump, the kid literally jumps.  When standing looking at his boxes of cereal (all of which are healthy chunks of granola snores) I say I want Cookie Crisp, Boo Berry, or Fruity Pebbles.  Ahmad says he is going for a run and returns with Cookie Crisp, Fruity Pebbles, and Franken Berry.  Wellhe was close.  I ate one bowl of Cookie Crisp and havent been back to his apartment since.  I mean, AMAZING that he went out and surprised me with these little treats.  But oopshe doesnt eat those kind of cereals.  Now hes stuck with them rotting in his kitchen.  The part that stood out to me the most though is that he listens.  When I speak, he hears every word.  And thatI love.  Butuh-oh.  Paul came over to my apartment on Sunday night and in the midst of my vomiting and rolling on the bed in agony, he bursts into tears and asked me to Please take him back.  I sat there staring at him and let him continue.  Paul:  Joe, I love you more than I have ever loved anyone in my life.  I dont have anything in my life that compares to you.  Not my family, not my friends, and not my jobs.  I want you and only you, Joe.  What can I do to make us better? Joe:  I have told you repeatedly what I need from you Paul.  I am not going to sit here and tell you again.  I am pretty sure that the only reason you are telling me this shit now is because you finally realize that I am moving on without you. Paul:  Do you even want to be with me anymore? Joe:  I really dont know. Paul:  Do you have any forgiveness left in your heart? Joe:  I dont know. Paul:  Joe, I am willing to work on our relationship.  I am willing to call you more, be nicer to you, work on our sexual relationship.  Joe, I am willing to be the boyfriend that you deserve. Joe:  While I would have killed to hear those words months ago, right now I cant allow myself to trust you.  I have put in so much effort into this relationship and I am tired of doing it now.  I realize that other people treat me better than you do.  And most importantly, I feel better about myself when I am not with you. Paul:  (sobbing)  Please Joe.  I need one more chance.  I will work on what I need to work on.  I promise you. Joe:  (sobbing as well)  You dont need to promise me anything.  If it is important enough to you, you will fix it on your own.  Obviously the conversation went on much longer and in much more detail, but this was the highlight.  Since that talk, Paul has been incredible.  He has been sweet, kind, and supportive.  Monday afternoon, as I lay in bed sick as a dog, Paul woke up and made love to me.  The way that I have wanted him to make love to me since January.  It was a beautiful time together and I enjoyed every second of it.  It was the only time over the last couple of days when I havent felt like complete shit.    As easy as it is for me to fall back into the routine with Paul, I am doing my absolute best to keep a level head and to not count on the fact that things with him will improve.  In all honesty, I really hope it does, but I am so used to being disappointed by him that I cant count on it anymore.  I am still hanging out with Ahmad and I plan to continue doing so.  But so far so good.    Paul has asked that I try to work with his schedule and to be as open minded about us as I can be.  If Paul is willing to put in extra effort, I am willing to make him my first priority.  But the second I see him slipping back into his old ways, I pull out.  Until I am confident that we are in a better place, this will be how things go in our world.    So yeah.  Wow.  I am SO pleased that he has made these small steps so far.    Now if I could only kick this fucking head cold.  I got a big weekend coming up and HELLS if I am going to miss out on any more activities.   HELLS.  BELLS. So many bells.  Latas.

      For you, its Thursday.   For me, its Friday.  Tomorrow is the Shavuot holiday and I have the day off from work!  Woo hooooo!  Considering that I want to take as much advantage as I can of the time I have off, I have been hastily making plans to fill up my days.  Usually I like to have a block of time to myself as welljust to rejuvenate and get my shit back together.  However, this time around, I will be continuing on the little sleep that I have now and dont imagine that I will be resting much before next week.    My mom is coming to town on Sunday!  She has a business meeting in the city and will be staying until Tuesday.  We have plans to go see  Dream a Little Dream , the new off-Broadway, Mammas and Papas musical.  We have plans to have some wine and a nice dinner.  AND we have plans to buy my ass some new clothes.  My mom is overly generous with me and has been known to sacrifice whatever she has in order to make my life a little bit easier, especially now that my brother is somewhere in Iraq.  She has been talking about this trip to NYC for awhile and I am going to do whatever I can to make this trip wonderful for her.  I am so lucky to have her and I try to take advantage of this fact whenever I possibly can.  I love my mother more than I love most anyone I have met in my life.    Tonight I am going out for drinks with Paul.  Tomorrow I am spending the day with Ahmad.  Saturday I am hanging out with fellow bloggers.  Sunday and Monday I am with my mom.  Tuesday, I die.  Goshdating two boys at once sure can take a lot out of a gay.  ErI mean, guy.  But I am excited.  Its a lot better than sitting at home miserable and depressed.    Yesterday I received my mug from  urlLink Sassy !  Gosh, I cant go on about this girl enough.  Its my first present from a fellow journaler.  And can I say that it is the coolest mug I have ever had?  Its so  manly  and full of punkin love.  So, THANK YOU Sass.  You made my day yesterday.  Im using the mug to hold my jizz loads.  Anyone want a Joe baby?  Twelve bucks a pop.  My hair has been so good lately.  It falls right into place and to be honest, looks like some sort of movie star hair.  That is until TODAY.  For some reason it is a HUGE poof of nonsense.  I resemble a cross between Tina Turner and Weird Al Yankovich.  Okaywowis this ALL I have to write about today?  Lets play a game.  The game is called My Bloodiest Booger.   We start by putting our forefinger up our nose.  (Pausing for you to put your finger up your nose) No no no.  You must put it way farther up there than that.  Im talking FAR.   All set?   Now take your fingernail and scratch the inside of your nose with all of your might! OUCH!, right?  Well, do it again.   Good job.  Pull your finger out and look at it.  How much blood and booger did you find?   If it covers your whole forefinger, you get 5 points.  If you find nothing, you get a punch.  If you get a huge piece of bloody messyou are the winner!  Eat it and declare yourself the King (or queen) of the Bloodiest Booger contest.  End game.  SOMariah, Kelly, and I came up with a fun activity for ourselves this summer.  We dont have a name for the game yet, but I think it will be called SLUTS or BUST.   This is how you play:  When you are at a bar, it is imperative that you find a man or woman of your dreams and get them to fuck you.  That is really the essential point of the whole game.  You get 1 point for every kiss that you get.  You get five points for every time someone goes down on you.  You get 10 points for staying over at that persons apartment AND getting them to go down on you.  Obviously there are points that are given for varying degrees of sexual escapades.  It is up to the other two people, not involved in the hook-up, to determine the amount of points dolled out.  I started the game with 10 points because of my experience with Ahmad.  But since I was so confident that I would accrue more points, I let those 10 drop and am currently at zero.  Once you hook up with someone, they dont count anymore.  So, as far as this game is concerned, Ahmad nets me zero points.  But dont you worryI will get me some more.  Mariah currently has 5 points.  She stayed over at this 35-year-old chick, Patties house, but she didnt do the whole hook-up.  So she only gets 5.  Kelly is currently at zero.  But you waitthat girl will strike the minute she feels ready.  Fun game, eh?    I am hoping that by the end of the summer, I will have 95 points, the Clap, and a mild strain of the herpes.  Goshthen I will be the WINNER!    Alright my ghoulies.  Please rememberif you didnt eat your bloody booger, you will have to wipe it under a countertop somewhere.  Not everyone is as fond of the game as we are.   PEAYCE!

       If God brings you to it, He will bring you through it.   The last few weeks have brought so many changes into my life.  At times it felt as though the changes were too dramatic and a bit daunting.  But I am starting to settle into the new and hopefully improved, Joe.  I havent had a down day in a couple of weeks.  My emotions have been much calmer and easier to control and my head doesnt feel nearly as cloudy as it has since I moved into Times Square.  I am starting to achieve the seemingly impossible task of becoming focused on both my personal life and career.  I am trying to learn how to take things day by day.  I am trying not to stress so much about unnecessary bullshit.  I am trying, more than ever, to be the best Joe I can be.    Last night I spent the evening with Ahmad.  We didnt end up going out to a nice dinner because we were having way too much fun drinking wine and smoking the Gangia.  We hung out at my apartment for awhile and then we went back to his place to talk and hang some more.  The night went more smoothly than it has in the past.  There wasnt pressure on me to like him as much as he likes me and we both took everything very slowly.  We treated each other as friends and that was it.  I laughed with him and I shared with him.  It wasnt until we went to bed (3am - ugh) that we began to kiss and touch and become intimate.    The problem is that Ahmad has an unbelievable body.  While I know that I need to avoid physical intimacy with him right now, it is very hard to do when I just want to squeeze and feel his amazing pecs and arms.  And can I say again how amazingly this kid kisses??  From his lips to his hands, he is gentle, but strong.  (I am getting hard just writing about it.)  He holds me and I feel safe with him.  In bed, he is total man and I couldnt ask for anything more.  But I also have to keep in mind that his feelings for me are progressing a lot faster than my feelings for him.  I have to remember that or the last kiss I will have with him will be us kissing our friendship goodbye.    When Ahmad showed up at my apartment last night, he brought me a present.  It was a book called  The Muslim Jesus .  On our first date, we had discussed the differences between Islam and Christianity and I was surprised to find out that they have a lot more in common than I previously thought.  The only HUGE difference is that Muslims believe in Jesus Christ as a prophet.  I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.  While Ahmad is a semi-practicing Muslim, I find him to be very open-minded when it comes to listening and understanding other peoples religious points of views.  I have a lot of personal conviction when it comes to discussions about God and Jesus and heaven, etc.  He totally respects my opinions and has an honest interest in what I have to say.  Gosh, he is a wonderful conversationalist.  At no point did I think about Paul last night.  Ok, maybe once or twice, but it wasnt nearly as heartbreaking as it was for me two weeks ago.  I like the direction that Ahmad and my relationship is going.  It feels easier now and without any of the previous pressure to fall in love, get married, and have 16 gay babies.  One day at a time.  Or something equally as generic.  I am out of the office for most of the day today due to our annual staff lunch.  Ari and I are both dreading it.  We would rather have our own lunch break and do our own thing.  I think the part that pisses me off the most is that over the next two weeks, our contracts of employment are up for review and that means Raise Time.  Ari and I are both asking for more money than we will get.  And the worst part about it is that the money we are asking for is not out of the question at all.  If anything, we both deserve it, hands down.  But instead of giving us a good raise, my bosses will do as they have done in the past.  They will give us a 3-5% raise and a lunch out at a cheap Middle Eastern restaurant.  Rock!  And also, Fuck!  Whatever.  I am eating my weight in hummus today.  Thatll show em.    I missed the premiere of  The Real World: Paris  last night.  I will have to catch it this weekend in repeats.  I did find out, however, where they are filming the NEXT  Real World .  SAN DIEGO!  Now THAT will be a great house.  Finally some place new and some place interesting.  Mary Ellis Bunim and Jonathan Murray can take  Las Vegas  and shove it up their ass.  E gads.  I hope they dont Google their names and find out that I wrote that.  I just love those two.    What does a cannibal call a phone book?  Well?  What is it?  Alright, be lazyI will tell you.  A menu!   A HAR HAR HAR HAR.  A YUK YUK YUK YUK.  A snore.  I like my new template.  It makes me feel clean and pretty.  And if you put your nose up close to your computer screen, it smells like Bubblicious.  Go aheadtry it.    Yum, right?  Total yum.  But not Bubble Yum.  Bubbalicious!  AlrightI have to go be Jewish now.  The Rabbis are ready to go eat some Babaganoush!    Shalom to you and yours.

      First, I would like to introduce a blog that I found earlier today.  Please welcome  urlLink Not So Simple .  I noticed that she had me linked to her site and I went over and visited her this morning.  I was stuck on her site for quite a while.  The girl has some serious talent when it comes to writing.  I began with one of her past posts called Her Body is a Map of Scars It was excellent.  So honest and bold.  I enjoyed it immensely and because of that, I had to give her a little plug in here.  She is good.  Please check her out.    Last night, as Paul and I were wiping the cum off our bodies, we flipped over to the  Style  network.  (yes, you got that rightPaul and I hooked last night!  Fucking finally) -(More about that in a minute) The  Style  network was promoting this new reality show in which they take homeless people off the street, give them makeovers and new jobs, and help them fix their life.  While watching this minute long preview, I immediately got choked up.  What a wonderful concept!  After I regained my composure and slapped myself in the nuts for being such a crybaby over stupid reality TV, I got immediately angry at our society.  Why is it that we broadcast dozens of reality shows about people trying to marry fake millionaires or people trying to marry guys with ugly masks on or people trying to compete for their dead grandfathers will?  And WHY do we reward these people with a million bucks?  For the love of the Lord.   Seeing the preview for this Homeless Life Make-Over show made me see how wrong we all are in supporting these other cheesy and useless shows.  If we are going to sit around and watch reality television every night, why dont we want to watch shows where people with AIDS finally get the treatment they need?  Or a show about foster kids finally finding a family that will love them?  Why the FUCK are we sitting around watching Joe Millionaire FuckFace lie and slander women in order to win himself some cheap fame and cash?  I just dont get it.  And as of right now, I dont support it.    I mean, sure.  I will still watch MTVs reality programming cuz I have said in this journal time and time again that they are the first and the best.  And no ones getting a lame ass reward out of the deal.  But as far as watching The Bachelor or For Love or Money or Insert the unclever name of an unclever show here, Im done.  You can take my nonexistent Nielsen rating and shove it up your ass, corporate conglomerates.  You dont have my support any longer.  I originally thought it was bad enough that people preferred reality TV to scripted sitcoms based on the fact that so many actors are going out of work.  Now I just think its sad that as a society we prefer watching people suffer more than we prefer watching people get the help that they need.  And that we financially support these boners.  Im done.  So yesPaul and I DID hook up last night.  I had to play with his limp penis for 20 minutes before I could get him in the mood.  Then he wouldnt even kiss me until I had him lubed up and ready to go.  I was happy that we shared this time together, but of course irritated as fuck that it took so much effort on my part to make it happen.  One of these days I am going to go down on him and bite that lazy dick of his right off.  ORone of these days, I will find someone who actually gives a shit about sex.  And about me.  SNORE A LICIOUS.  Tonight, Ahmad is taking me out to dinner.  I think we are going to the the  urlLink SoHo Grand .  He told me to dress up really nicely and to be ready for a good time.  I checked out the Grand online and to be honest, it seems a bit out of my league.  Ok, a bit?  It is HELLA out of my league.  I dont think I have any clothes nice enough to wear.  I am calling him a little bit later and I am going to do my best to change his mind about our dinner destination.  I am a diner type of kid; not a glamorous restaurant type of kid.  Money means nothing to me and the possession of it means even less.      Kelly would kill me if she knew that I was giving up the chance at going out to dinner at a place like The Grand.  She has been dying to find someone to take her out to dinner.  I understand how she feels, as I have been there before.  But she wants to go out classy and expensive and I just dont care at all about classy or expensive.  We have completely different tastes when it comes to dining out.  She is rather elegant and I am rather down to earth.  But if someone doesnt take this girl out soon, I might have to mortgage my entire life and do it myself.  Its getting to that point.  Too bad Ahmad doesnt like pretty blue eyed ladies.  He could take HER to the SOHO Grand.  But then Id have to cut his dick off for leading me on.  Okwhat is WITH me and the mangling of dicks today?   I need to get fucked.  Thats probably it.  Off to take a nap for lunch.  Cuz when you make $30,000 a year at a shit holeyou get to take naps during your lunch break.  And this bitch is ready for his!    Latas lovahs.

      So as we can see, I have a new template!  I have no idea what I did to my page last Friday, but whatever it was, it fucked up my shit royally.  Since I am HTML illiterate, I did what any blogging amateur doesI chucked the whole thing and started over.  Honestly, I like it better now.  All of that dark blue was hurting my eyes.  And the print was small and everyone had the same template and wellthis is a much more grown up looking site for my shit slinging entries.    Here are two conversations that happened today.  You figure out which one was had by a four year old girl and her 6 year old sister and which one was had by a 26 year old Paul and a 25 year old Joe.    First Conversation:  Why do you always hurt my feelings? Cuz I hate you. You shouldnt hate people. I cant help who I hate and I hate you. Then I hate you too. I hope you die. YOU DIE. I hate you and I hope you die. You are not supposed to tell people that you hope they die. To me you are already dead.  Second Conversation:  Why do you always hurt my feelings? hahahaha. Do you think this is funny? Stop acting so stupid. What did you just say to me? You get so mad over nothing. Who do you think you are talking to? Who do you think YOU are talking to? I hate you. Dont say you hate people. But I really do hate you.  Do you want me to lie? Youre a jerk. Im a jerk that hates you.   Oh yes.  I love looking at my conversation compared with childrens conversations and not being able to tell the difference.  Just love it.  Paul has been a fucking prick all day.  Ahmad has been a gem all day.  Do I need to be slapped in the face every day by senor douchebag in order for me to remember that one of these guys is much more worth it than the other?  Its totally ridiculous.  And I am totally bored with writing about it.  In other news, I am going to be in my first show EVER in NYC.  The show is called  Stupid Kids  and it is extremely cutting edge and powerful.  I have already been cast as one of the lead parts and my stomach clenches in excitement every time I think about it.  Today I am going to the park on my lunch break to re-read the script.  Since I have moved to NYC, I have been waiting for the moment when I could go to the park and read a script of something that I am working on.  Could this be the start of Joe CuttheShits acting career?  Yes, I think so.  In two weeks, we are auditioning for the last role of the production.  Unfortunately, it is a very hard role to cast.  The guy who has to play the part must be overly masculine and comfortable with onstage homosexual kissing (kissing ME!).  Its a lot to ask for, but it is a wonderfully challenging role if the right person gets cast.  Considering the fact that I am not directing this show, I am a bit nervous as to whom is going to play this part.  It is my job as an actor to work with whatever I am given and that I will do.  But it would be a much better experience if the group could cast someone who not only fits the part aesthetically, but talent wise as well.  Gosh, I am so excited to be working again!    Can someone explain to me why it is has rained every fucking weekend since February?  And can someone else explain to me why it is beautifully sunny on every Monday?  It is so fucking annoying.    I would kill to have a sun-filled weekend.    And the person I would kill is you.

      This will be my last entry until after I return from the Bahamas.  I leave work today at 5pm and will not be looking back once.  I dont have to come to this place for 9 whole days.  Its like the best thing to happen to me all year.  Its not that my job is so bad, per se, but just knowing that the next week and a half is for meah yes.  Freedom in its truest form.  I just finished reading  urlLink The World of Normal Boys .  Ahmad let me borrow it before we stopped hanging out and I just finally got around to reading it.  There are very few books that have impacted me the way this one did.  The story was captivating, the characters were beautiful, the emotions conveyed so honest and real.  The book sent my entire world into a free fall.  As I closed the book, I sat staring at the trees in the park and contemplated my existence.  How lucky am I to be who I am?  How blessed am I to have the family and friends that I have?  Gosh, some people dont have it nearly as good as I do.  I cried and let the tears flow down my face, unashamed.    Reading this book was one of the best experiences I have had all week.  I feel touched in the most incredible way.  A mixture of happiness and sadness balled into one.  Because so much is going on around me right now it is hard to exhibit any sort of control.  I feel good, but I feel anxious.  So much to do, yet none of it is negative.  I dont necessarily like feeling this way.  I like to have control over my life and over the emotions that result.  Unfamiliar feelings scare me.  At times, I think that I should avoid books like this, as it brings so many delicate topics right to the surface.  However, I always walk away a stronger and better person because of it.    In other newsI am petrified of the upcoming flight to the Bahamas.  I am sure that everything will be fine and that there wont be any problems.  There hasnt been an airline accident (in the US) in over a year.  But the unknownthe wonderingthe time that I have to sit and fantasize about my horrible death.  Please God let this flight be smooth.  Calm me down, relax me into it, and let me enjoy it for what its worth.  I have been waiting so long for this moment.  Dont want it to be ruined by superficial fears.    Trust in God.    I will miss all of you while I am gone.  Miss the routine of it all.  If there is any chance that I can find a computer in Freeport, I will stop in and give a quick hello. But if not, I hope that everyone has a painless and enjoyable week.  Do something for yourself.  Tell someone that you love them, even if they are driving you crazy.  Take 20 minutes out of your day to spend thinking and analyzing yourself, your situation in life.  Do this and find some peace.    Gosh, next time I write in here, this whole trip will be over.  If for some reason I dont make it through the flight, I need my Rita to take care of my friends and family that I have left behind.  Kelly, you are in charge of disposing of my dildos, porn, and anything else that would otherwise embarrass the other people in my life.  I trust in you two the most.  You know everything about me.   Alright, that is it.  I am leaving for a trip that will hopefully bring a moving and life changing experience.    Be good everyone!    And  Dont forget about me.

      I came home tonight and sat down at my computer.    Alone in my house.  Alone, in general, for the first time in a long time.   It's weird cuz back in the day, 2 months ago, I was spending every night alone in my room.  Upset, sad that I had nothing to get me out of bed.  Here I sit now, busy and happy.  The two seem to cooperate so perfectly.  Remember this moment Joe.    Remember the introspective nature of this feeling.    There are times when everything slows down for a moment and you are given the chance to truly experience it.  Seemingly for the first time of your life.  But you've been in this place before and your concious knows that.  Yet, this time it feels different.  This time it feels real.  It's rare to experience peace like this.  It leaves faster than it comes.  But the sheer exhiliration of it all makes these moments worth the wait. Worth the sadness and worth the frustration that is commonplace.    Still   I wouldn't trade it for the world.

      Much better mood today.   Thank the goodness.  However, my comments are PISSING me the fuck off!  I have tried adding Squawkbox in an effort to get some sort of comment system back, but instead, all I got was a SquawkboxTV icon.  No comments.  RAWR!  Ari is having the same trouble, so at least I am not alone in my problem.  Why oh why is my blogger so gay? Dont answer that.  72 hours until I leave for the biggest trip of my life!  Woo HOOODLE!  So thrilled.  Boneriffic!  Supersplendific!  Cumonmyfaceeriffic!  Ieatmyownshittastic!  enough.  After my rehearsal last night, I was shocked to find Paul waiting for me in my bedroom at home.  After the night we had on Monday, I was sure I wouldnt hear from him again until the trip, but there he wastotally brightening my mood.  We had a good rest of the night together.  We watched  Queer Eye for the Straight Guy .  Its  pretty  good.  And thats about all I have to say about that.  (can you tell that it made quite the impression on me?)  HOWEVERPaul introduced me to a show called  urlLink Da Ali G .  Its this one-man show on HBO.  I dont really know how to describe it, without ruining it, except to say that it is the funniest shit I have seen in my whole entire life.  While watching back to back to back episodes the other night, I couldnt contain my howling laughter.  I mean, seriously.  It is SO funny that I would give up sex with Paul every night if I could just watch 10 minutes of it.  Oh.  Oops.  Ive already given up sex with Paul.  Yeah, even trade.  Please please PLEASE take 27 minutes out of your day to tune in and watch it.  I promise you will not be disappointed.  The end.  I did, in fact, cancel my plans with Ahmad for this evening.  He handled it very well, as he is porking his new gay boyfriend, Leo.  Ahmad called me to wish me a Good trip and I brought up the Leo thing.  Just to know what was going on.  He got all uncomfortable and was like I cant talk about this at work.  Yeah fucking right.  So I pushed him farther.  How long have you and Leo been dating?  About a week or two.  Have you hooked up?  Yes, but it was very minor.  Kissing here and there.  (Then I found the opportunity to zing him)  Do you realize, Ahmad, that in the last 7 weeks you have had 3 different partners?  (Like I give a shit at ALL about that, but I KNEW that it would make him a bit upset)  Yes, I realize that Joe.  But I would settle on one partner if the guy was just interested enough to continue our relationship.  OOOPS.  Pushed that one too far.  No, you definitely should pursue things with Leo.  UmI gotta go now.  I laughed it off and got off the phone slapping myself in the head.  Why do I DO things like that?  Am I really that immature? Dont answer that question either.  I am about to leave to have lunch with Mariah.  I am taking a 2-hour lunch today.  I just decided.  I also decided that I love candy-coated candy.  Yum, right?   UM!     I just got back from my lunch with Mariah.  You are NEVER going to believe what happened!  We were casually sitting, having a nice lunch, when chaos broke loose!  People go RUNNING down the street, cop cars are everywhere, and there is tons of screaming.  Everyone in the restaurant gets up and walks outside.  Mariah and I pick up the baby she is the nanny for and we join the crowd.  Down the block, we are told, there is a GUNMAN shooting people in City Hall!  UM!!!!!!  We all duck back into the restaurant as the police scream to everyone Get off the street!  Move into the buildings!    We rush back to our table and one of the bartenders turns the television to  urlLink CNN .  We watch as they do a live broadcast, telling of a crazy person shooting people in City Hall.  Councilman James Davis was killed and as of right now, we don't know who else was killed.    It is RIGHT OUTSIDE the spot that we chose to have lunch!  We barely finish our meals and grab our shit to go.  She and I barrel through the crowds and make it to the subway.  It was absolutely NUTS!  And it also figuresthe day I take a 2-hour lunch is the day that I end up in the middle of gunfire.  (ok, so not so in the  middle  of gunfire, but CLOSE ENOUGH!)    All in all it was great to see Mariah and I love that every time she and I get together, there is madness.  It makes hanging out with her so exciting.  BTWamidst the chaos, the baby wanted nothing, but to eat my french fries.  Stupid baby.  OkI am almost done with work and THANK HEAVENS!    This week has been an udder beast. Yes I meant UDDER.    Its been a beast with teets.

      My job has been the demise of my existence today.  I have a ton of shit to do, the people are driving me up the fucking wall, and there is no reprieve, ever.  It figures.  I should have expected that it would be like this.  Every time I have some extended time off from this shithole, everything seems to fall apart right before I leave.  And I even detect some guilt being thrown my way.  As though I am not totally deserved in going away on my vacation.  Twatmothafuckingever.    Paul and I spent the majority of our evening, last night, fighting.  Well, in all honesty, he was amazing for the first three hours, while I was a bitch.  I couldnt shake my bad mood and every time he opened his mouth, I wanted to kill him.  He wasnt doing anything wrong, but the fury and disdain I was feeling manifested itself into an incredibly horrible attitude.    Finally I broke out of my bad mood around 9pm and Paul picked up where I left off.  At one point, he got so angry with me that he threw my pillow at me and told me to go to bed.  By then I was done with my pouty, selfish, bullshit, and looked at him as though I couldnt possibly figure out why he was so angry.  He screamed and screamed for awhile and I just got into bed.  We fell asleep on opposite sides of the bed.  I woke up, in the middle of the night, and kissed him on his forehead.  He smiled and said Thank you and thats the last thing that we said to each other.   Im just in one of those moods.  Im stressed out about the vacation, about my job, about how much I have to do.  I dont have time to see the people I want to see and the people I have to see are pissing me off to no end.  I feel angry inside.  And there is no reason for that.  I am about to go away on the best vacation of my life, yet I cant find a way to get through this fucking irritating week.  GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAH!  I had pizza for lunch today.  Its been weeks since I did that.  You should have heard the debate that was going on in my head about this stupid decision.  Dont do it Joe.  Youve come too far to ruin your diet with two slices of pizza for lunch.  Oh just fucking do it.  Two slices of pizza will do nothing more than make your mood better.  So I ate the pizza and then got angry at myself when it was finished.  Why did I think that drowning my attitude in grease and fat was going to cure anything?  Now Im angry AND bloated AND I have to wear a bathing suit in less than 5 days.  Wonderful.  Ahmad and I are supposed to go see  Terminator 3  tomorrow night.  However, we had a short e-mail exchange today in which he exposed the fact that he is dating a new guy, named Leo.  Deep down I want to be happy for him and I want to be happy for me.  Ahmad is moving on and it looks as though I wont have to confront our break-up conversation again.  But the petty and ridiculous side of me is pissed off that he is dating someone else.  I know its not fair and I know that he has done nothing wrong, but with the way I have felt over the past few days, I feel like I could jump on the subway, ride over to his office building, and spit in his face.    Obviously I wont be spitting in anyones face.  But I will be canceling our little trip to the movie theater tomorrow night.  I just cant help it.  He should ask Leo to go with him.    God, I suck today.    Alright, back to work.  I think there is some data entry calling my name and its probably best that I take out my aggression on that, rather than on the people in my life that dont deserve such nonsense.    Hey, were all allowed a bad day every now and then, right?

      This morning as I took my shit and read my  Entertainment Weekly , I found myself staring at a picture of Jason Mraz.  Now, we understand that I have a new obsession with his music, but as I sat atop my toilet, I realized that it wasnt the music I was thinking about.  His skinny little body, dressed up in his jeans and hoody, made me incredibly horny.  I wanted to kiss him.  I wanted to unbuckle those jeans and feel his girth while he held the back of my neck and kissed me.  SICK!  Hes skinny!  What was WRONG with me?!?!  Maybe I am growing up after all.  I leave for the Bahamas on Saturday!  AY YI YI!  While enduring some pretty heavy constipation earlier, I sat and thought about the flight.  Within minutes, the nerves in my stomach broke up my packed up bowels and the poop exploded with success.  Basically that was my disgusting way of letting you know that I am nervous as all hell about the flight.  When I told Paul that I was pretty scared, his response was You know Joe, if its our time to die there is nothing you can really do about it.  Thanks Paul.  You totally squelched my fears.  I had an absolutely INCREDIBLE time with Rita this weekend.  Swear to God, the visit flew by so fast that I sit here shocked that I went to Syracuse and back.  We had so many drinks, so many conversations, so many laughs.  I spent some quality time with her fiance and he asked me to be in the wedding.  On the grooms side.  Rita and I thought it was best for me to wear a tux, rather than in my beautiful bridesmaid dress.  You understand.  Rita introduced me to the world of moisturizing.  I have been battling this eczema/psoriasis thing, on my face, for years, but for the most part, it is under control.  However, I woke up on Sunday morning to discover that both of my cheeks were COVERED in dry skin.  Im talking lizard-like scales that made me look as though I was preparing for Halloween, 3 months early.  Rita gave me a bottle of sensitive, Clinique lotion to use until my face gets under control.  Well, wouldnt you know it?  That little genius of a Rita has given me the gift of healthy moisturized skin!  It looks MUCH better.  Just wish I was smart enough to figure that one out on my own.  Sometimes I am such a boy its ridiculous.  I havent seen Ahmad since my birthday.  We spoke on the phone once.  So last week, I sent him a forwarded email questionnaire thing-a-majigger.  One of the questions was What did you do last night?  Ahmads answer was Had an awesome date with a great guy.  We had two bottles of wine and a nice dinner.  Funny, cuz I thought he and I were still dating, but clearly he is with someone else.  Another question was Do you like the person who sent this to you?  Ahmads answer to that one was Sure.  My initial reaction was What a cunt smeller!  Im not complaining that Ahmad is pulling himself away from me.  Its fine.  I want him to pull away from me because I dont know how to tell him that he and I are totally over.  Unfortunately, I would still like to be friends with him and I am unsure if that is going to be a possibility.  We are supposed to go see  Terminator 3  on Wednesday and I am already trying to come up with a way to cancel.  But if I do cancel, he will surely hate me forever.  I dont know.  I just dont want to deal with any of this until I come back from the Bahamas.  Thats fair, right?  Actually I dont care if its fair at allits whats going to happen.  Everything is my life is going pretty well these days.  Rehearsals are great, work is hectic as fuck, but fine - my parents are good, my brother is doing well, and yeah.  Overall I feel great!  I get nervous when I have this feeling.  Like I shouldnt enjoy the relaxed nature of everything.  It is so rare for there to be any calm in my life, that when it does happen, I feel as though something is surely going to show up and turn everything upside down.  I am perpetually stuck in the dropping of the other shoe theory.    Then again, maybe I should just stop it and allow myself to feel good.  4 more days until I leave for my trip.  I dont think I have ever been this anxious and excited about something in my life.  I am leaving the country for the first time!  And my first question to my mom this morning was Will our condo have cable?    Ah geez Joe.    Cut the Shit.

      Having good hair is extremely important to me.    That is why I absolutely hate going to the hairdresser.  My hair is pin straight and if not cut correctly, will stick up to the ceiling, despite any amount of gel or pomade I use.  So imagine my surprise when the lady spun me around in my chair today and I was like YAHOO!  That is a do after my own heart!  No joke, I hugged her as I was leaving.  Then I stiffed her on the tip.  Sike.  I decided, while walking the streets of the Upper West Side, that I LOVE the male body.  I love the way it looks, I love the way it feels, I love the way clothes fall on a man.  Gosh, I love it all.  Like seriously in LOVE with man body.  The more muscle, the better.  To me, it exemplifies masculinity and strength.  A real man takes care of his woman.  A real man works hard at his job and just as hard in his personal life.  A real man should embody everything beautiful and spiritual in the world.  I love men.  My favorite body part on a man is the arms.  I love big and strong, built up arms.  I love when a guy flexes for me and I love when he is confident during the flex.  A love a man that will pick me up.  I love a man that wants me to sit on his lap.  I love a man who can do all of these things and not emasculate me in the process.  I know, sounds like irony in its truest form, but as a gay man, this is how I feel.    A man who will pull his shirt off and get under his pick-up truck to do some manual labor wins my heart immediately.  I much prefer blue collared men to the Wall Street banker world of white collared snore.  I like a man with dirty hands.  I like a man who has bulging forearms, with veins snaking up the interior.  I like a man that smells of sweat.  I like a man that works for everything he has and refuses to accept pity.    My man also has to have a sense of humor.  He has to be able to keep up a conversation, to read people, to stand by me even when I am wrong.  My man will put his arm around me when I cry as well as when I have accomplished something important.  When I feel low, it will be my man that cheers me up.  My man will understand me because he will love me.    I dont care what my mans face looks like.  I have enough face for the two of us.  I do, however, care that my man is physically fit.  He must work on his body and treat it as though it is his temple.  He must exercise, eat well, and keep on me to do the same.  (pizza binges excluded)  My man will take me to the gym with him.  He will teach me new and improved ways of keeping myself fit.  My man will be my mentor and my supporter in all of these endeavors.   I think that this is a pretty good description of the ideal man.  Obviously, when you fall in love, some, if not most of these requirements, become unimportant.  You fall in love with who someone is, not what they look like or how many times they have been to the gym.  I just hope that the next time I fall in love, it is with someone who has more of these qualities than the men I have been with previously.  I just wonder what it would be like to be in a loving and nurturing relationship with a man of this nature.    I guess Ill keep wondering.

      Im gay.  So this morning I woke up at 6:30am to go to the DMV downtown.  I dont think I have gotten up that early since I was in high school.  I thought it was going to be a lot more of a pain in the ass than it was.  I woke up before the alarm, which I always tend to do, but not when I have to get up an hour earlier.  In any case, the DMV was mostly painless and I was able to keep my old drivers license!  WOO HOOOOO!  Now I dont have to worry about only having the temp. card for when I go to the BAHAMA MAMAS.  That took a LOAD of pressure off my back.    When I was waiting to get my picture taken, I fell in love with the most beautiful specimen of a man that has ever existed.  Seriously, no contest.  This man wins the awards for best body, best face, best hair, best clothes, best sex appeal, and the clincherbest voice.  He opened his mouth to read the eye chart and this deep and sexy voice came out of his manly throat and I literally gaped in awe of him.  He and I made a ton of eye contact and I hoped with every being in my life that he was gay AND also attracted to me.  And also attracted to me enough that he would approach me and ask me out to dinner.    Then he did.  He strolled right up to me, took his shirt off and picked me up in his arms.  I stared into his dark and deep brown eyes as he kissed me on the forehead.  I started to cry.  Im in love with you, he said.  Im in love with you too, I said.  He carried me out of the DMV and down the street.  People were staring at us, but I didnt care.  I had finally found the love of my life.  He walked us down into the subway and stood there holding me, waiting for the train to come.  You can put me down now, I said.  I dont think so, he replied.  But Im getting kind of embarrassed, so you can put me down any time you are ready, I said back.  This man of my dreams held onto me even tighter and I finally released into him, cuddling as close as I could to his awesome chest.   I could see the lights of the train coming down the track.  Ok, put me down please so I can get onto the train.  No, fucker. he said.  Fucker? I thought out loud.  Did he really just call me fucker?  Sumptins up.  I looked into his eyes to see if it was possible.  He just smiled back, holding onto me with every muscle in his arms.  As the train approached, this stud kissed me on the forehead again and tossed me into the tracks.  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! I screamed.    But it was too late.  The last thing I remember is the blinding glare of the headlights.    After that, there were doctors and hospitals and snores.  Now Im back at work, but a little wiser than I was when I woke up this morning.    Gosh, what a weird day it has been so far.  Tonight I am hanging out with a friend of mine from high school.  Her name is Hannah and she and I have known each other since I was a freshman.  Thats the longest I have known any friend.  She and I dont talk or see each other often, but every time we spend time together, I enjoy it immensely.  It will be great to catch up with her and she always makes me laugh so hard.  Im looking forward to it.  Last night was our first official read through of  Stupid Kids .  I am falling madly in love with the cast.  Everyone is smart and funny and seemingly talented.  (Will get a better feel for that as the weeks progress).  There is no problem making conversation either and no one is a show off or name dropper; which in acting, is a rare find.    Ian, the guy who plays my partner in the show, and I get along very well so far.  Last night he and I talked quite a bit about our lives.  He is easy to talk to and pretty interesting.  He also exudes so much sex appeal, but is (fortunately) so not my type.  I am really hoping to develop a true friendship with him through this experience.  Especially since he is straighter than straight and has to make out with me for the next 3 months.  It is going to be so weird to kiss a straight boy.  I mean, as I have said in this journal, I have been known for kissing my fair share of straights, but this time, I really believe that he is.  I wont be trying to turn him gay and thats new for me.  Plus, if I start to develop ANY feelings for him at all, I have to do Kellys laundry.    Fuck you Ian.  I aint doin no motha fuckas motha fuckin laundry.  YEAH.  yeah.  Kelly and our friend, Angie, are going to see Ani Difranco perform tonight.   That was a boring story.  Want to see where Paul and I are staying in the Bahamas?   SHO you do.  Here it is:   urlLink Bahama Trip!    Fun, right?  Oh please, you dont even KNOW me.    Im getting my gut something to eat!

      Just got back from having a wonderful hour of sunbathing in Riverside Park.  I figure that I really have to start getting myself a base tan if I am going to be heading off to the Bahamas in a week and a half!  UM!  YAY!  So I had a minor freak out last night when I realized that not only do I not have a Passport, I dont have my Drivers License renewed.  When you turn 26 in NY, you have to get a new license and re-take the eye test, etc.  Whatever, I kept putting it off cuz it costs $50.  Now I have to get up at the crack of dawn tomorrow and go to the DMV in order to get it taken care of.  Most likely I will not have the actual license until after I get back from the Bahamas, but I will have the temporary one on me at all times.  I hope that works for Bahaman bars.  I called the travel company today in a panic when I thought that I needed a passport.  They informed me that I only need my birth certificate and a picture ID.  Since I wont have my license by then, she said that my work ID would be okay.  I hope she was right, cuz otherwise, I will be spending my time at the Bahamas, fighting with the John F. Kennedy airport security.  Can anyone calm my nerves on this and re-assure me that all I  do  need is a birth certificate and a picture ID?  For some reason the travel agent didnt squelch any of my fears.  OohI definitely got some color today.  Rock.    So I boofed just now and poop almost came out.  Maybe I should go take a little shit.  Paul and I are doing extremely well these days.  We actually got up a little early this morning and talked in bed before we had to leave to go to our respective jobs.  We have never done that before.  Usually I have to leave a lot earlier than he does, so I just let him sleep.    Last night we were up laughing so hard for so long that I almost burst with happiness.  We had a discussion about the Ahmad thing and about future hook-ups.  He said that he is totally cool with the fact that I may want to hook up with other people besides him.  (Especially since we are still not hooking up these days.)  But he is really uncomfortable with me dating anyone else or pursuing any other type of relationship.  I told him that I understood and that I thought that was fair.  It was the first time in as long as I can remember that we had a conversation of this nature and didnt end up slicing each others faces off in the process.  Are Paul and Joe actually becoming a real couple afterall??  I mean, it has been 3 years, 7 months, and 6 days.  Bout motha fuckin time.  So I am quite the celebrity at work what with my HUGE face in the paper.  My boss wants me to photocopy it so that he can put it up in my building for when the students return.  I told him that I thought the idea was CRAZY, but he insists on me doing it.  Ugh.  Hi students!  Welcome back!  Look at my fat head in the newspaper!  How was YOUR summer?  Oh yeah, theyll just love it.    My dad is CONVINCED that I could get a commercial deal with  Sprint  out of this whole thing.  I tried so hard to explain to him that it just doesnt happen that way.  He refused to believe me and said that my situation is just like Jareds.  You know Jared dont you?  The  Subway  sandwich loser guy.  But Joe!  Look at Jared.  He wont have to work another day in his life!  Oh yeah dad?  Well, I hope that I dont become Jared for a number of reasons; mostly being that I dont want to be known as the fatty who became skinny from eating Veggie subs all day.  Oh Joe, I figured you wouldnt make the most out of this opportunity, but what do I know?  Yeah dad.  You are right.  Ill think about it.  NEVER.  My parents seem to think that if you are blessed to have your picture in the paper, you should consider it an open opportunity for fame and fortune.  I tried to explain that if that were true, there would be no regular people in the world.  Everyones been in the paper at some point, for some thing, and we dont have a gazillion celebrities running around.  But nooooooooo.Im lazy and missing out on my chance to make it big.  Achoo. Scuse me.  Hes just trying to help and I LOVE him for it.  But I just need an agent.  Then they can deal with my dads great big ideas.  He wants me to make it so badly he can taste it.  And so do I.  But the subconscious pressure that comes from all of this makes me want to call up the  Daily News  and have them retract the whole thing.    Sike never.  But you understand.  Turtle head turtle head how are you today? Very very well my friend, can I come out to play? Turtle head turtle head why do you hurt me so? Well you trap me inside your bowels, you fucking little ho.  Turtle head turtle head, are you trying to hurt my heart? Let me out your sphincter, or Ill juicify your fart. Turtle head turtle head, you have won this round. I will win them all and here comes poop with sound.  Peace out yall!

       Drop it like its hot, drop drop it like its hot.   SO!  The  Daily News  article came out yesterday.  I dont know if you read down after Fridays post to see me freaking out about the preview they put in Fridays paper.  Well, yesterday morning at 7am, my phone began ringing off the hook.  I stayed in bed not answering, so afraid that I was going to hate the picture or that even worse, they wouldnt use it in the real article.  Eventually I got out of bed and walked to the local convenience store to buy a couple copies.  I got home, I sat, and I opened up the paper and my eyes BUGGED out of my head.  Not only is the picture IN the paperit is the COVER of the Lifeline section!  HAHAHAHAHA!  No for real! It was a FULL-page picture.  I pooped my pants immediately, then I burst out laughing, then I almost cried, then I went in to my bedroom to think about what had just happened.  God, how could I have pooped in my own pants??  I smoked a cigarette and stared at the picture for about 20 long minutes.  It doesnt look like me at all? I thought to myself.  I must weigh close to 350# in the picture I worried to myself.  This is so surreal I finally decided.  The article was pretty good too.  I was happy with the quotes she used and yeah!  It was a complete thrill.  Supposedly, they sell the  Daily News  around the country, so my dad went out yesterday and bought every copy they had in the local CVS.  My uncles did the same in San Francisco.  I bought two copies and plan on laminating them so I can stare at myself for the rest of my life.  LAME!  Okay, thats it.  Do you want to see it?  Promise you will be nice to me about it?  I dont really look like I am pregnant in real life, but as you know, sometimes the camera adds babies to your otherwise non-baby filled stomach.  Whatever.  Here is the  internet version  of the article.  (sike, the link has been removed.  YOU missed it.  I'm sorry.)  In other newsI am off to visit my friend Rita this weekend.   Really  looking forward to it.  ROCK. More newsI leave for my Bahamas vacation a week from Saturday.   UM!  Still some newsmy niggle has healed.  There is still a tiny bump, but it doesnt hurt at all anymore.  Sorry for freaking out about itits justwellits my niggle.  And I dont like when niggles hurt.   And finallyI am going to get a new checking account today.  Thats pretty fun, since Chase Manhattan Bank sucks a fatty.  They charge you fees for everything and I am TIRED of that nonsense.  Alrightthats it for now.     urlLink Now and Laters .  Yum.

      Okay, so I know I don't post on weekends, but tonight is a big deal.  Regardless of the fact  that I'm wasted and already typed this post once, I will continue to do it up.  It's just that I have to tell you something.  I AM IN THE  Daily News  paper today.  Do you have any idea how hard it was to put the HTML  of italics in just now.  So hard.  Anyhow...  Kelly and I went out for a few quick drinks tonight with Mariah.  Well, Joanna shows up and she's  like"Joe, have you seen the newspaper today??  I'm like "Hells no."  Cuz well, hells no.  She then opens up the paper and there under "Coming Sunday" is MY PICTURE about not having a cell  phone.  No seriously.  (I am dying laughing as I type this).  And also so wasted.  But I am  trying my best to be serious.  HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  My picture is in the fucking Daily news.  Fuck italics.  Right under Cameron Diaz's stupid plug is MY fat ass being like "I have NO REGRETS about not having  a cellie in the city".  Like I ever said that I have "No regrets".  Like I would EVER say that.  Cuz honestly, I WANT a cell phone.  I'm just poor and can't get one.  But the PREVIEW of the article makes it out like I am so happy to not have a cellie.  In the pic, I am gazing off into the sky being like "Oh thank God that cell phones don't exist in my world."  Sick. They made me out to be such a loser.  But whatever...hahahahaha I'm in the newspaper.  This is why it's cool:   colon and then explain sorry, speaking out loud.  Joanna said to me tonight:  "Joe, they interviewed like 4 or 5 people for this article, including me, and they chose YOUR picture out of all of them to put into the paper." Now maybe she was saying that only because when I saw the picture I vomited on myself twice,  but she made it out to be the biggest deal and you know what...to me it IS!   AY YI YI!  The minute I got home from the bar, I called everyone I loved.  My parents Rita Paul.  "Guess what???  I'm in the fucking paper!"  They chose MY pic!  However sick it is, they chose my PIC!  Do you have any idea how AMAZING I feel right now?  Gosh, so amazing.  Thank you lord Jesus.  I know that seems ridiculous, but to me.... the wannabe actor to have his picture in the paper...and like a HUGE REAL picture...to me...it's God.  Giving me the little boost that I need.  snores.  Done.  But really...YAY.  I miss my Reets.  I called her immediately after I called my parents and actually I am calling her again right now. I just want to share this with her.  SO badly.  Joe is in the paper. Can I be more obnoxious about it?   It's just the biggest deal to me.    Wow.    Look...I have no idea how jumbled all of this sounds.  I am typing, for the most part, free style.   I am not about to go back and edit out my bullshit at this point.  I'm in the paper and what up. If you don't like this entry, then you don't like that I'm in the paper and I don't know how to  be friends with you if you don't realize that this is a big deal for me right now.  hahahaha. sike.  But totally sorta sike.  Cuz, I'm in the paper.    Under Cameron Diaz.  OKAY!  So I just had a very long talk with Mariah.  It was probably one of the best "phone talks" we've  ever had.  Basically cuz Rachel was in the room while we were talking and it was all "Is Rizzle listening?" "Yes, shizzle is hizzle." "Okay, so let me ask you this", I say, "Is rizzle being a bizzle?" "Yizzle your quizzle." HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA cuz shizzle.  It was funny and great and I'm in the paper and way too exicted about it.  Alright, I'm outtie.  Sike...major diatribe coming...  I want to thank the following people:  (Look my first famous speech)  Rita.  Cuz without Rita, there isn't a Joe.  For rizzle. Kelly.  Cuz without Kelly, I would be totally alone. Mariah.  Cuz without Mariah, I wouldn't smile, laugh, or grow nearly as much as I did tonight. My parents.  They are everything. Paul.  For never being around during the important events. ARI.  For being the first person I called to share my news with.  I know that she is an avid  reader of the DAILY NEWS.  And when I called her to tell her that I was in the paper, she was tired, but proved herself to be an incredibly important friend of mine when she immediately asked: "Are you going to send the picture to Winfield?" WOw.  Thank you Ari. Now my journalers...I love this.  How fun. A Girl Named Bob...for being the first journaler I fell head over heels in love with.  You know Bob, my friend Rita got me into this whole journal thing.  Hence my thanking her for me being Joe.   But her first big journal inspiration is/was PAMMIE.  PAMMIE.Com is pretty big now, but hearing the way she talked about Pammie, reminds me of the way I talk about your journal.  It's what I want mine to be.  Okay, I know I'm drunk and gushing ridiculously about you, but honestly...at some  point a forum needed to be presented to me so that I could explain my profound love for your journal. You're exactly what I want my journal to turn into.  The end. Drowning Fish...You captivate me more than anyone else.  Your stories peak my interest in the way a dirty soap opera would.  I know it sounds like a half-compliment, but the truth lies in this: You choose to do an online journal, like the rest of us, but your story is real and intriguing.  You instigate feeling and opinion in your journal.  Sometimes I walk away from your writings thinking that you are wrong to be doing what you are doing, and sometimes I walk away thinking...thank God she IS doing what she's doing.  You instigate opinion in me.  And for me, that is rare in online journalers.  I LOVE your journal. Sassy...cuz you are the pioneer of women when it comes to this whole thing.  You took a journal that wasn't known and in the process of 6 months turned it into an icon.  Yes, your writing is good.  Yes you are honest and true.  But the thing that stands out most about you, is your sincere care for  your readership.  Most people want the numbers, as do you and I, but you make sure that each number is respected.  You send out mugs.  You give sass love.  You are making a name for youself and I think that if you keep up with this journal thing...you got yourself a copywrited, full fledge novel on your hands.  Damn girl.  You got fired, cuz you are too good. T-bone.  T-bone is my internet crush.  I know we talk about them.  Well, I don't really.  I love you all.  But of course I am gay, and I have an internet crush too.  And it's a boy.  Buv course.  But I am not crushing on T-bone in a physical way.  I mean, is he a bodybuilder, cuz I don't think so. He's not about that shit.  He has a wife and a cutlet and he comes across like the most PERFECT husband and man any woman would want.  He truly cares about his life and he is happy with it.   Very rare to find that.  He reads all of our journals every single day.  He takes time and puts  in the effort to be that guy and I, for one, truly respect it.  It seems that every time I go  to post a comment on someone's site, T-Bone has already been there and said a wittier comment in his three minutes than I could come up with in my 37.  Whatever.  T-bone, I have a crush on your  journal.  As I am sure that quite a few others do.  But guess what?  I bet I'm the only guy  that crushes on your journal.  So whatever, you're a gaylord.  :) Chevy Valentine.  We don't visit too much, but I will always consider you my original sister  blogger.  We started together and in my opinion we finish together.  You are Joe's girl.  No matter how insignificant that may seem. Jedi Nord...you straight ass brotha.  Tango me again and I might fall in love with you too.  It's  just cute when a straight guy is really sweet and supportive of a gay guy, no questions asked.   That's all I need to give someone the AOK.  I'm tough on people, but when you're the Nord, you're in. Cati Cati Cati...my sweet and darling Cati.  Of everyone I read, you're the one I want to know  the most.  YOur emails, your posts, your every being...I wonder about you.  If there weren't  such a thing as online journals, I feel that you and I would have crossed paths at some point, regardless. I have no idea what you look like, but I picture you to be one of the most beautiful creatures that has walked the earth.  I know, lame.  But really, you are my internet fantasy.  Not that I would want to do you.  Obviously.  But I would want to be your friend.  Badly.  It takes quite a lot for someone to upset me over the internet, but when I thought that you posted something about me being an asshole, I got literally upset.  I stressed and checked my journal every five minutes for  some sort of clarification.  You are cool.  Very cool.  And we think exactly alike.  I don't want us to ever fight.  Especially since some day, I know we are going to be real friends.  I just  know it. Okay...I will end this soon...but I'm finding it to be so much fun.  April - You make me laugh so hard.  You are my subconcious.  Sometimes I read your journal  and I'm like "Is she serious?  Did she just say that and really mean it?"  Cuz HAHAHAHAHAHA! You get away with it too.  That's the best part.  You are my subconcious.  You say the things that I want to say so badly, but instead I'm like "LYLAS!" and "BE GOOD!".  I like you. I like you as my partner in crime.  I think we could do some serious damage. Okay, serious note... Keol, thank you.  For changing my life.  You've been through alot and gosh I don't know what to say that sums up what I think.  Girl, get comments on your site and keep writing the way you  do.  Everyone...read her journal and take it for what it is.  She's got alot to say and so much of it will blow you away. Not so simple - Are you serious?  You are the best writer ever and I hate you.  LOL!!!  (okay, what am I...12?) (kinda) (I really wrote "LOL") I love your journal and you have such a nice site with writing samples and snores!  Why can't  I  have writing samples and pictures and stuff?  I want my site to be respected like your site.  I think it every day.  Every time I click on "Not so Simple", I'm like "How is she going to be upstaging me once again?".  Sike.  I just really like everything you do and say.  You're funny and real and honestly, an excellent writer.  Rock. WINDOWSILL WENDY...how could I possibly not write about her until now?!?!  Holy shit I love the wendy. FIrst of all...have you seen a picture of her?  Cuz YOWZAH!  The girl is a knock-out.  And the best part of it all is that she is self-effacing and real.  She is non-stop support and non-stop love. I read this girl and I think...Am I gay?  No seriously...am I gay?  Cuz having someone like her  in your life must be the greatest priviledge.  I don't know too much about her relationship with THE JOKER.  (And I just LOVE that Joker)  She just comes across as like the coolest and most chill prom queen you ever met.   As I said, she is a knock-out.  But so real and introspective and cute and am I serious? Wendy, go away.  It makes me think that online gayness isn't hereditary. Indigo Steve, I love you.  I smile at your pictures and I will be your best friend always.   You are my boy.  If there was ever a fight, I would scratch and claw anyone's face to make sure that Max Casella was safe and sound.  You know how it is.  Okay, I've got to stop now.  I could go on and on for hours, but my buzz is wearing thin. I just typed and typed so much love that I feel like I could puke in my garbage can. Okay, maybe that's the 307 vodka tonics I had tonight.    I just feel like I don't take my journaling community as seriously as I should sometimes. I've had this site for a year and a half and it really wasn't until just recently that I  felt truly affected by the support system that comes about from this whole thing.  I remember writing Indigo Steve one time saying "I don't really read other people's journals and write them e-mails".  Cuz at the time, I didn't.  But now, my mind and my heart is so much more open to  this whole experience.  I am proud of my journal and I am SO PROUD of my readership.  I mean, you guys gave me money for my upcoming show.  You guys sent me e-card after e-card for my  birthday.  You write me the nicest stuff when I am feeling like shit.  Seriously...fuck.  Wow. Thank you.    Look, if I act all gushy sometimes, it means that things are going well in my life.  And when I feel good, I want nothing more than for my friends and family to feel good as well. I think you understand.  But sorry that I couldn't put links to each of your sites when I  spoke about you.  I don't know HTML and I copy and paste the code every time I do it on my site. And when I'm at home, I don't have the code.  So stop being so concerned about publicity and take a true compliment for once.  hahahahahahahahahaohmanI'madick.  So if tonights entry was "too long" and "full of drunken ramble" then fine.  For once I didn't look at this journal as "my next post".  I looked at it as a way of saying everything that was in my  mind and in my heart.    And if that's overbearing, then put your fingers in your ass and love it. hahahaha.  Always end on a fingers in the ass reference.  It's really the way to go.  Goodnight my babies.

      The  old  Joe vs. The  new  Joe  Lets begin.  You seeI went to a very STRAIGHT man college.  There were like 5 gay people there and they were scary as fuck.  And without exaggerating at all, I was the ONLY gay male in the theater department there.  I know, I know.  Theater?  Filled with gays!  But not at my college.  At my college, even the gay kids were straight.  So, since I couldnt really date anyone, I would meet straight guys that I thought I could TURN gay with just a little bit of coaxing and a lot bit of patience.  Through my last two years at college, I attempted to change over 4 different guys.  3 of them ended up making out with me and staying in my bed.  Pretty great accomplishment if I do say so myself.  But once I left school and moved to big cities (ie: Boston and NYC), I realized that my days of turning straight people gay were over.  Thankfully.  There are enough gays in these cities that it would be foolish of me to still find the need to mess around with pseudo straight guys.  Why bother?  For the most part, this change has happened without incident.  That is until last night.  We had our first cast meeting at a bar called  REVIVAL .  It went wonderfully and I drank way too much, as my nerves were brittle and breaking.  Ian, the guy I have to fall in love with during the show, revealed himself to be a very opinionated, extremely intelligent, chauvinistic, hottie.  At one point, he was quoted at saying Halle Barre only won the Oscar for  Monsters Ball  because she laid down and put her feet up in the air.  Um.  Yeah.  But for some reason, Ian can say this nonsense and still come off like a stud.    During one of our cigarette breaks, Kelly bet me that I would, at some point, have feelings for Ian.  That I would go for him, regardless of my belief that straight men are a waste of my time.  The minute we started talking about it, I got a bit nervous inside.  What if I DO end up having feelings for him?  What if I cant help it and the old Joe comes forward and takes over?  I know it sounds ridiculous, but old habits die hard.    In any case, the bet is on.  I will do WHATEVER it is I have to do in order to avoid falling head over gay heels in fake love with Ian.   Wish me luck.    Oh by the way, if I win the bet, Kelly has to do my laundry.  And in a town where doing laundry is the biggest inconvenience, I am surely going to LOVE watching her cart my huge bag to the cleaners.  Heh heh heh.  We also made another bet about whether or not Evanescence sings Bring me to Life.  She thought it was T.A.T.U., I knew she was wrong, shook her hand, and now she has to do my laundry even sooner than was expected.  I was like Kelly, youre NOT GONNA GET IT!  hahaha lamest lyrical reference of the day.  What else?  Have you ever stopped to think that other people are masturbating about you?   This morning as I sat on the subway, this random guy kept staring at me.  I would look away, fake yawn, do a little cough, only to see that nothing deterred him from staring at my face.  He stayed that way until I finally got off at my subway stop 50 blocks later.  During the walk to my office, I thought about the chance that the guy who was staring at me went home and feverishly jerked off his penis.  I am sure it has happened to all of us at one point or another.  Hells knows that Ive jerked off about people Ive known or just seen on the subway.  But when its the other way around, its kind of violating.  Cuz its their fantasy, not yours.  And you are left to wonder if they are closing their eyes and making you pee all over yourself while they lick your armpits.  You understand.  So I keep getting these credit card applications saying that I am pre-approved.  Yet, every time I send in the forms, I get this horrifying letter back telling me that there is a delinquency on my credit report that prevents them from issuing me a credit card.  So I finally wrote a letter asking for a free copy of my report.  Now I sit here in FEAR that my statement is going to come and there is going to be an overdue bill on there that I didnt know about.  What if its like $1,000?  Or a million dollars?  Or even worse, what if its for $400 and I have to actually pay it?  I dont have $400.  I didnt even have $50 to buy a new pair of shoes.  Oh the woes of being a poor actor in NYC.  At what point do I just give up and move away to a financially stable home in suburbia?   Yuckowitz.  I hate money.    But I love yuckowitz.  Thanks for that one Reets.    OH!  If you sent me an email over the last week, I have lost it.  There was a problem with my Hotmail account.  Virus or something and I was forced to expunge all of the emails in my inbox.  So please dont hate me if I didnt write you back.  I dont remember who I owe emails too and I dont want anyone to think that I ignored your PRECIOUS little writing to me.  PRECIOUS golum golum.  ONE LAST THING Please welcome the  urlLink Renee Chronicles !  She is one my new loves.   Alrightlove ewe.  And also love pizza.  Can my belly go away now so I can have some?    Have a great weekend yall.    Im going to stick my fingers in my ass I think.  You do the same.

      Yeah.  Three weeks ago, we auditioned this kid, Brad, for our show  Stupid Kids .  The script calls for the other character to give my character a titty twister.  Purple nurple, tune in tokyo, whatever you wish.  Well, the kid who was auditioning grabbed my tit and twisted it so hard that for the last 3 weeks I have had a yellowish bruise around my nip.  Fine.  I can deal with that.  Its ugly, but I can deal with that.  BUT THEN!  This morning I wake up to find that my entire left nipple is swollen and there seems to be a rock hard substance beneath the skin.  It is incredibly painful.  I have run my fingers over the nipple about a thousand and one times and I cant figure out what the solid deposit could be made of.   urlLink Ari  has inspected the nipple and she seems to think that its just a bad bruise.  But do bruises get pregnant with hard deposits?  I dont know.    Either way I could kill that fucker right about now.  Good thing we didnt cast his violent ass in the show.  Otherwise I would be severely scared of the scene that calls for him to knife me in the gut.    Sike, there is no such scene.  But still, Id be scared of him twisting and hurting my innocent niggles.    Yes I wrote niggles.  Love it.    Anyhoodles, tonight is our first cast meeting!  AY YI YI!  We are all meeting at a bar at 7pm to get to know one another.  I am kind of nervous, kind of excited, but also dreading it.  I  dont  want to spend any money on this event, but even moreso I dont want to get to know these people WITHOUT alcohol, so I guess the best decision was made.  Can I just NOT be so poor?  I couldnt even buy myself a new pair of kicks.  Luckily Ari came to the rescue on that one and got me a pair for my birthday.  Do you think they sell nipples for a reasonable price at Walmart?  I could surely use a new one.    To me, Nick Lachey is really really hot.  He has a new reality show coming out called  Newlyweds  and supposedly it chronicles his and Jessica Simpsons first year being married.  Okay, I HATE Jessica Simpson, but mostly because she gets to have Nick Lachey in her vaginer.  The show itself will probably be LAME CITY USA, but as long as he takes his shirt off every time hes in front of the camera, I dont care.  Id watch him take a shit if he had his shirt off.  (HORK!)  Its just that he is so damn phyne.  And I am so damn swollen from that jerkoff dickhead that twisted my niggle.  Do you think if someone looks up niggle on Google, they will come across my site and think that Im a facist.  Er, I mean racist?  Cuz honestly, fuck you.  Dont judge me.  Today I bought a three-pack bar of soap.  Big news, right?  Well kinda.  Cuz I bought  urlLink Coast bar soap  for the first time in my life.  Supposedly it wakes you up with its refreshing deodorant smell.  I only bought it cause the commercials seem so convincing.  I figure, why not try out a little test of my own.  Okay, I guess not such big news, huh?  Oh IM sorry.  Are you BORED?  Yeah, well fine.  I didnt know that this journal was called For your interest only!    Shit.  Im spicey today, right?  I dont know why.  I dont feel spicey.  In all actuality, I feel ricey.  You know, cuz of my Asian hair.    Okay, should I have called this post Doing my best to offend all ethnicitys?  Cuz really.  I need to stop.  Im 26 now and we dont make jokes like that when we are 26.    At 26, we make jokes like this:  What do you call a fly with no wings?   Well, A WALK of course!  HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR.  Okay, wanna hear the most ridiculous part about that joke?  I am so braindead to jokes that I had to look up Lame Jokes on the internet and thats what I came up with.   I did find one kinda funny one.  Wanna hear it?   Fuck yourself then.  Here it is:  What do you call a person with leprosy in a bathtub?   Stew  oh THATS rich.    Righty Oh.  I am off for today.    Enjoy your Thursday evening.  Whatever you decide to do with it.  You stupid niggle.

       By the time you teach her Rappuhs Delite, she gone fuhget Juicy.  By the time you teach her Juicy, she gone fuget Rappuhs DeLITE!   ---  Babs (Making the Band 2)  Guess whos back?  Back again.  Joeys back.  Tell a friend.  HI!!!  Totally my bad.  Who do I think I am anyway?  Someone with a real life?  Never.  Lets immediately get down to business, since I dont have an excuse big enough to make up for my lazy lack of posting.     Here are the things I need to discuss:  The present from Ahmad.  Yeah.  Well, Ahmad came to have lunch with me LAST WEDNESDAY (wow, been a long time) and brought my present with him.  After lunch, we went down to the auditorium in my building so I could open up my gift in private.  He wrote a beautiful card and the present was wrapped up all nice and shit.  Now remember, the present was supposed to exemplify how well Ahmad knows me.  I was nervous, excited, and totally curious.  When I opened up the gift, guess what it was?  No guess.  No really Hells, youd never be able to guess.   It was the  urlLink Pasta Pro .    Do you know of the Pasta Pro?  Its the pasta pot with a built in colander.  The second I saw it, I looked into his eager eyes and said Oh wow!  The Pasta Pro!  My parents got me that for my birthday too!  Ahmads face fell and he said Why didnt you tell me that?  I wanted my gift to you to be something that you really wanted.  I reply No I DID really want it.  And I love that you listen to me when I talk.  I just didnt think to tell you that my parents had already given it to me.  I feel terrible.  Im sorry.  We hugged and I thanked him over and over.  Then I said goodbye to him and offered to give one of my Pasta Pros to Ari.  I was a bit disappointed in the gift, but I really shouldnt have been.  How dare I?  Ahmad has known me for a month and he really went out of his way for me, what with making me dinner and baking me a cake and all that jazz.  But, I thought maybe he'd get me a new car or something.  Ah wellwill have to work on my gold-digging skillz.  NowPaul on the other hand.  I showed up at his apartment at 5:30pm last Wednesday.  I was told to get there as soon as I could.  When I walked in the door, Paul was standing in the bathroom door, butt-naked, shaving his face.  I looked at his cock and said Is that a drip of CUM on your cock?   Paul quickly looked down and goes Oops.  Yes.   What is WRONG with you?  Its my birthday and youve already made sure to masturbate so there is no chance of us hooking up tonight.  How could you start the night like this?   Im sorry Joe, I was horny.   Wipe up your dick and lets do whatever it is you have planned.   When Paul got out of the bathroom, he told me that we would watch  The Simpsons  until 8pm, cuz that is when we had our reservations for dinner. Wait.  Do you mean to tell me that we are going to smoke a bowl and go to dinner for my birthday? Yes Joe.  Is that not good enough? Honestly Paul, its not.  Thats what we do EVERY night.  I thought that maybe you would plan something fun for us to do. Dinner is fun and you are being selfish and greedy. WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA?  Its my birthday!  How could I even BE selfish and greedy? Just stop it.  Lets watch TV and get ready for dinner. 10 minutes later I started to cry.   WHY ARE YOU CRYING?!?!?! Because I decided to spend my birthday evening with just you and you havent planned shit for us.  In fact, I am SURE you waited until this afternoon to plan dinner.  I should be seeing my friends, who I know would take me out and plan something fun.  But it is so TYPICAL of you to forget about the entire thing and to quickly throw something together.  Im going home. Dont be so dramatic. (Tears flowing out of my face)  You are the WORST boyfriend on the planet.  I will never forget this day. FUCK YOU JOE!  We are going to a show at 8pm, but you had to go and ruin it! silence. huh? We are going to a show and if you could just wait an hour without freaking out silence. oh. Yeah. Well now I feel like such an asshole!  Why do you have to hurt my feelings in order to surprise me?  After that we started the night over.  We had some wine and got ready to go see  urlLink De La Guarda . The show was fucking mind-blowing.  I shouldn't explain to you what it was about, but if you EVER have the chance to go see it, you would be FOOLISH to miss it.  Definitely the best and most surprising thing I have seen in years.  After dinner, Paul took me to Brasserie on 52nd street.  It was by FAR the nicest and most expensive dinner I have ever had the pleasure of taking part in.  We had numerous appetizers, bottles of champagne, and I got the swordfish for dinner.  The price of dinner came to $255.  UM.  He even stopped and bought me dessert on the way home.  It was an absolutely wonderful evening and Paul secured his spot in my heart once again.  It wasnt about the money, but rather the fact that he actually planned something, wrote me a nice card, and made sure that I was happy all night long.  We laughed and laughed and laughed until we went to bed, happy as gay bugs in a gay bed.    The birthday party I had planned went off pretty smoothly, but to be honest, was my least favorite part of the weekend.  The highlight of our night out was that Kelly got a bodybuilder to pick me up and give me a hug.  Mmmmmmthat was the hottest.  Also, Mariah and Joanna gave me wonderful gifts and everyone treated me really well.  It just wasnt the night I had originally envisioned.   The 4th of July was amazing!  We drank beers and margaritas all day and smoked tons of the pot.  We hung out on Mariahs rooftop in Brooklyn and got ourselves a sweet tan.  We were also able to watch the fireworks up there.  The whole day and night was excellent.  There are more details, but why bore you with them?  You only care about dicks and vagina.  And thats that!  I feel very lucky to have the friends that I do.  They made the whole weekend special and fun.  At no point did I want to be anywhere else.  I loved my birthday, although anti-climactic at the party.    In other news, I got a letter from my other  urlLink prisoner pen-pal .  He wrote me the nicest letter and I have now decided that the only friends I want to have in my life are people with jail terms.  They have nice bodies, are confident and strong, and will take care of me always.  Theres just that little detail of them wanting to slice off my face, but whatever.  Ill risk it.  I already wrote Carlos back.  I hope we fall in love some day.    I havent talked to Ahmad since my birthday.  As each day goes by, I start feeling even guiltier than I felt the day before.  I am convinced that he hates me now.  I plan on calling him this afternoon to touch base, but I think he is going to spit on the receiver and put it near his ass so he can fart on me.  Why wouldnt he?  I took the present he had for me and never called again.  Its just that Paul and I are doing really well now and Id like to give our relationship another chance.  I told Paul that I would make a decision about Ahmad before the Bahamas trip.  He says that I should make my decision now.  Although I know that Ahmad and I need to call it off, I am not so sure I want to call off every possibility I have of meeting someone else.  Im doing my best to just play it by ear and to take it day by day, but that shit is boring and nothing ever gets solved that way.  Secretly I must love the drama.   Oh please, openly I must love the drama.  OkI think thats it!  I hope this entry will serve as my penance.  Work has been a nightmare lately, so I havent had the chance to catch up with all of you.  But I will make SURE to find time to do so in the next couple of days.  I can PROMISE you that.  And I can also promise you that I will not eat pizza.  Mariahs birthday card to me had a picture of she and I on the front and I had a HEART ATTACK when I realized how humungous I have gotten over the last couple of months.  It used to be funny before.  Not its just plain sick.   urlLink This  is the size of my belly.  AYUK AYUK.    Peace be with you my friends and lesbians.

      SO!  I have just finished getting ready for my sweet 26th birthday party.  I am MAD excited, to say the least.  The John Mayer CD is playing in the background while I type this and I am wearing the new shirt that my friend Angie got me.  I must say, I look pretty fly tonight.  Love handles or not.  I am currently chugging down a Corona Light and getting my mind ready for the next two days.  Only me would plan a party that spans over 36 hours.  I hope everyone is in for a raging good time, since I am in a raging kind of mood.    Last night Paul showed me the TIME of my life.  I have so much to say about it, but will be forced to explain at a later date.  Let's just say that I was treated like a prince.  He was the most perfect gentleman.  I felt so lucky to have him last night.  Gosh, it was beautiful.   Today I bought myself a new pair of shoes, thanks to my dear friend Ari.  They cost me only $5 more than what she had given me and they are FUH FUH FUH FLYYYYYYYYYYY!  I am happy.  And my feet have finally stopped screaming at me.  So I guess all is good in that area.    I got my picture taken for the  Daily News  today and it was less than fun.  He showed me a few of the pictures after he took them and I was like "SICK!  WHO IS THAT FAT ZITTY GAYLORD OF A FREAK PRETENDING TO BE ON THAT PAYPHONE?!?"  So, needless to say, if they come out poorly, none of you will be able to see it.  I am not about to let the first time my face is shown to be ugs.  You understand.  Kelly got me the most amazing gift ever!  She is taking me to see the show  Take Me Out .  It's a Broadway play (my first!) about a gay baseball player.  Not only have I heard that the show is incredible, there are naked boys throughout the entire production.  YAH HOOOOOOO!  We go at 3pm on Sunday.  She's the breast.  I am just loving my birthday.  I always get so worked up about it in my head.  You know, like it's not going to turn out exciting or fun.  But every year it does.  And this year is no exception.  My friends are all showing up at 9pm to have some champagne and then we are off to the bars.    There is only one thing I wish I could change about this evening.    I wish my Rita could be here.  It's times like this that I miss her the most.  Whenever something big happens in my life, all I want is for Rita to share it with me.  Luckily I am going to visit her next weekend in Syracuse.  Her birthday present to me is a free roundtrip ticket.  I mean, who could ask for a better gift?  Not only do I not have to pay to see her, I get to spend a whole 48 hours with her.  It's unreal.  It's surreal.  It's how I wish we could spend every day.  Just like old times.  Gosh, I miss her.    Alright...off to put the final touches on my makeup.  The lipstick I got just isn't working.  I might have to run out to  Sephora  real quick and grab a new color.    SIKE!  LATAS LOVAHS!    YAY BIRTHDAY!

HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!   WOOOO HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!  Today has been AWESOME so far!  I feel naturally happy and excited about what is in store for me.  Everyone at work has been incredibly sweet and they even got me some cards and presents.   urlLink Ari  gave me a gift certificate to buy new shoes, which if I havent said it enough, I desperately need.  The sole on my right foot is almost completely ripped off.   urlLink Ari , in her divine wisdom, and motherly care, thought to get me a gift that I really NEEDED.  Thank the Lord.  I would have had to spend my day with one shoe on and one flapping in the wind!  Also, member how I did that interview with the  Daily News  about living in NYC without a cell phone?  Well, the reporter called me this morning and told me that they are INDEED going to take my picture to put with the article.  YAYAYAYAYAY!!!  Tomorrow at 1pm, I get to go stand at a pay phone in Times Square, pretending that I am making a call to all of my friends.  HAHAHAHAHAHA.  I am hella excited.  My picture is going to be in the paper a week from this Sunday.  As soon as I know the link to the article, I will post it so you can all see what I look like.  Unless the picture is terrible, in which case, you can keep wondering.  I got cards from my uncle and granny, both with money in them.  My brother called me from Baghdad to wish me a good day.  That was probably the best part of the whole day so far.  It meant SO much to me to hear his voice.  We had a great talk and I felt very positive when we got off the phone.  It was the first time that I havent cried after talking to him.  So thats a good thing.    Paul is being overwhelmingly sweet today.  I stayed at his place last night so that we could ring in my b-day together.  I didnt tell him that I was going to stay there, as I wanted to surprise him.  Ironically enough, he went to my apartment with a bouquet of flowers, only to find me missing.  He then jumped on the subway and found me in his apartment watching TV.  In order to make up for me missing out on the flowers, I told him that he could buy me McDonalds.  Heh heh heh.  It was a pretty sweet deal.  I shoved a Big Mac meal in my mouth at 1am.  Nothing like making yourself extra blubbery for the birthday celebrations.    Paul let me wear his clothes today, which he never does.  He is supposed to call me in a bit to let me know what he has planned for tonight.  I am pretty excited to spend the evening with him.  Honestly, he is the only one I want to be with tonight.  Its the first birthday of mine that we have spent together since we met.  In the past he lived in Boston and could never make it.  But this year I get to spend the actual day with him.  I am thrilled.  Ahmad is coming up to my office to take me out to lunch.  He is bringing his present for me.  I have no idea what it could be, but the anticipation is definitely killing me.  Remember, he says that the gift will showcase what a good listener he is.  Eggselent.    I want to thank EVERYONE for sending me E-cards.  I couldnt believe my eyes when I opened up my Cut the Shit account this morning and found all of those cards.  You all care!  You really really do.  It makes me want a hot dog REAL bad.  Snicker snicks.  You are all the BREAST.  Thank you from my little gay heart.  Rebecca Gayheart.    So last night we had the callbacks for the show I am in.  They went very well.  We cast the guy I wanted and I am bubbling over with nervous excitement.  Our first cast meeting is a week from tomorrow.  The guy I get to kiss is so adorable and manly.  We didnt go with the super hot guy from the first night of auditions.  Thank God too.  He was a bit scary last night.  So scary, in fact, that he made up a full script during our audition.  He did like half the lines he was supposed to and completely made up other lines and said them.  I just sat there thinking You know, you are so beautiful, but if I ever have to act in another scene with you again, I am going to pee on you.  Dehydrated birthday pee, no less.    The end.  Tomorrow night is my big party.  ROCK!  Everyone is pretty excited, including me.  Well, I HOPE me.  It is MY party, afterall.  And I will surely cry if I want to.  I have no idea what I am going to wear.  Ah geezso much to do.  We have a huge BBQ planned for Friday.  I have to go tomorrow and get the food with Mariah.  Damn, so much to do.  I am starting to stress a bit.   AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!  So much fun and so much to do.  So much to do.  Lets all say it one more time:  SO MUCH TO DO!!!    AY YI YI!!  Okay, thaz it!  I might not be in here for a couple of days.  I am off from work tomorrow and Friday.  I will try to stop in this weekend, but if I dontHave a WONDERFUL 4th of July my friends!    Thanks again for making my birthday extra special.

      One more day until my BIRFDAY!    YIPPEE SKIPS!  Last night was the official start to the birthday fun.  Ahmad invited me over to his place to celebrate the occasion.  We had great conversation, laughed so hard, and we shared things about our lives that we had yet to disclose.  On the subway over, I felt anxious about seeing him.  Whenever we have intense hook-ups, I always want him out of my life.  I dont know how to enjoy sex and Ahmad gets penalized for that.  Once we got to talking, I brought the subject up and we had a very enlightening conversation about us and about the relationship that we are pursuing with each other.  My anxiety took the back seat after that.    Ahmad not only had two bottles of really good Chardonnay waiting for me; he had a bottle of champagne.  He made me a birthday dinner, which consisted of cheeseburgers, cheese fries, and Caesar salad.  He also made me (from scratch) a carrot cake with cream cheese icing.  (All of this and the kid doesnt eat cheese!)  At the end of the night, he came into the bedroom with the cake all lit up with candles and sang to me.  From his trip to Vegas, he brought me a Ritz Carlton bathrobe, some phone cards, and candy.  Tomorrow he is meeting me for lunch and that is when he is giving me my actual birthday present.  Although I consider the robe to be my birthday present.  I saw the price tag and it was $125.  Yikers.  I had SO much fun with him.  We didnt hook up last night, but we did kiss and hold a lot.  I finally went to sleep around 2:30am and had to wake up at 7:15am.  Needless to say, I am very much looking forward to my nap this afternoon.  Ahmad and I talked at great lengths about my brother and I showed him the letter I got from Baghdad.  He is the first person I have shown the letter to and he was the definite right choice.  He went on and on about how beautiful my relationship with my brother is and how he cant wait to meet him.  He was so supportive and it was nice.  I am glad that I showed him the letter first.   In other news  Member how I wrote two pen pal letters to  urlLink prisoners ??  Member how I am crazy and I do shit like that?  Well, yesterday I got a letter back from one of the prisoners:  urlLink Trent .  UM!  It was a really amazing letter and the guy was totally cool.  He did refute the fact that he didnt kill the person the law said he did, but I dont care either way.  This guy is HOTTT and it will be fun to have a pen pal that is beautiful AND dangerous.  He has been in Playgirl three times and in the letter he says that he is "bigger and tighter now".  Bigger is always better for me.  He's too lean in this other pic.  The one thing that stood out to me about his letter was how starved he is for human contact.  He was honest and straightforward, but thanking me over and over for writing him.  I guess jail can be a very lonely place.  Who wouldve thought?    Tomorrow is my 26th birthday!   Here is a little tidbit I bet you didnt know about me: I was born on 7/2/77 at 7:27pm and weighed 7 pounds 2 ounces.  Also, my social security number is XXX-72-XXXX.  Also, I have 7 fingers and 2 toes.   Ha. Sike.  But the rest is true!  I wonder what that all means.  Some day I will have to figure it out.  But for now, its just a nice little conversation piece. Right?  For example: Hi Barbara!  Do you want to know a strange little tidbit about me? I would ask. No., Barbara would say. But Babs, I really want to share something about my life with you. I would say back. I asked you not to call me Babs. Barbara would say firmly. Well you see, I was born on 7/2/77 at 7:27pm and I would begin. **Gunshot** Oh thats real nice Babs.  Now Im bleeding. Barbara exits through the window on the left.  Seemingly in a hurry.    I spent the majority of the morning putting the final touches on my birthday party.  YAY!  I hope everyone is excited and not too burnt out from Gay Pride Weekend.  I also hope people bring me presents, although they totally dont have to.  But I also hope that people pay for my drinks when we go out, although they totally dont have to.  And one last thing I hope for is solitude.    Sike!  Imagine I wanted solitude for my birthday?  Thats just quazy.  Let me introduce you to my FAVORITEST NEW ARTIST!     urlLink Jason Mraz !!!    (Please take a listen.  "The Remedy" was the song that got me into him.  But the rest is so good too.  He's better than John Mayer.  snicker snicks)  I adore this kid.  His voice is GREAT and I just LOVE his music.  I have been playing some of the songs from his new album this morning and I am LURVING it.  He does a remake of Kermit the Frogs  Rainbow Connection  and it is INCREDIBLE.  Please spend a minute acquainting yourself with Jason Mraz.  He wants me to call him Razzie, but I think thats a bit lame.  He will always be Mr. Little Guy Jason to me.  You understand.  I guess thats it.    The next time I write in here, it will be my BIRTHDAY!    AY YI YI!  (Come on Razzie, lets go get a drink) (No Babs, you cant come)

       TONIGHT IS THE MTV VIDEO MUSIC AWARDS!   Rock.  The show goes way too long, but other than that, I am muchly excited.  My friend Angie is coming over to watch them with me.  She stopped by my place last night and we talked for awhile about her grandmother.  Pretty much, things are not going well.  There isn't much hope left.  I feel terrible for her.  Its the last living grandparent that she has.  Angie has been in complete control of the situation and I told her that if and when she needs to release some of the pent up emotion, I am here for her.  She asked if I would watch the award show with her tonight and I immediately felt like that was the right thing to do.  Poor thing.  Last night Paul ran lines with me for my show.  He was so adorable during the whole thing.  He asked me tons of questions about my part in the play and made me laugh over and over.  Things are going so well for us right now and I wish I could be with him every day.  Im not going to see him again until after Labor Day and that totally blows.  I wish things were different and that he could come with me to the Poconos this weekend.  I live for the day when my boyfriend will be able to go to events with me, as not only my date, but my lover.  Sicklover.  Some day maybe.    Thank God that Ritas fianc isnt going to the Poconos either.  Rita and I have already planned on jumping on each other and French kissing the second we get together.  I am going to impregnate her with my tongue.  Since Rita planned the trip, she, my friend Erica, and I get to sleep in the big master bedroom at the condo.  It sounds AMAZING!  We will be like three bugs in a beautiful looking rug.  Beautiful because Erica and Rita are Hot City, USA.  Actually all the girls are Hot City, Usa.  For some reason, these 5 beautiful women wanted to be MY friend in college.  Its pretty great.   Im totally getting some.  Lick my cunt.  I have been a VERY bad boy this week.  I ate two slices of pizza on Tuesday and today, after I promised myself that I would be healthy, I ate another slice.  The grease dribbled off my chin as I stroked my cock in pizza heaven.  It was the most erotically disgusting thing that I have ever done.  Oh man it was so good.  And just to piss Angela off, I had TWO diet cokes today.  Take your egg smelling farts and leave me with my oh so delicious soda pop.   Ok, can I stop writing like a fucking weirdo today?    Last night when I was hanging with Angie, she told me that when she was in Mexico a couple months ago, she was walking down the street and bumped right into a man that was taking a shit on the street.  She bumped into him just as the long dook was hanging out of his ass and ready to break off.  Startled, she took a step back and saw (with her own blue eyes) the poop string break off and fall to the ground.  It was long and nast.  I burst out laughing and we decided that the new term for when poop falls out of your ass is breaking point.  Angie and I had a good laugh and then I horked all over her face.    Think of me tonight as Justin Timberlake performs on stage.  Also think of me when Britney and Madonna pretend theyre friends and sing  Like a Virgin .  Madonnas voice is so weak and destroyed at this point, that I wonder who will be the tighter lip-syncher.  MTV says that they ban lip-synching at the awards show, but these two bitches couldnt belt out a tune if you paid them.  Oh yeahMTV IS paying them.  Be ready for sweet, melodic whispers to come out of their mouths.  Do NOT think of me when Kelly Osbourne does anything.  Unless she falls flat on her doughy face.  Then think of me dying laughing.    Do NOT think of me when Christina Aguilera is eating 17 cheeseburgers and wiping the melted cheese all over her sweaty, stupid body.  And for the love of Georgia, please dont think of me if any more late 80s, early 90s metal heads jump back into the scene with their rendition of Paradise City.  You understand.  I gotta take a crap.  Enjoy the show!

      After posting Ahmads letter yesterday, I began to feel really guilty about it.  It wasnt a very classy thing to do.  He didnt deserve that.  So in order to put my mind at ease, I decided that I would delete the letter from my journal as soon as I got to work.    But then, when I woke up this morning, I decided that I wanted it to stay.  Sure, its not classy, but its real, and Im not going to start censoring myself even more than I already do.  So, the email stays and I will learn to deal with having no class.  Not like I had much to begin with.  The end.  I never made it to rehearsal last night.  Looooooooong story and I would just rather ignore that topic of conversation for now.  Instead, I went to Pauls apartment to run lines while he was at his job.  I worked on the script for a couple of hours and then finally had to pull myself away from it.  Sometimes I get so wrapped up in my acting that I look at the clock and realize that the evening is almost over and I have spent the entire time with my nose in my script.  Its the one time of day where I feel passion.  Its all encompassing and its a beautiful thing.  After I was finished working on the show, I decided to completely re-do Pauls living room and bedroom.  The two rooms are connected to each other and were in need of some serious work.  I ripped the place apart, vacuumed, dusted, and re-organized everything.  I then moved into Pauls bedroom and did the exact same thing.  I hung pictures on his walls, folded and organized his dresser drawers and closet and basically sucked the room free of dirt and nast.  It wasnt the most fun project of my life, but I knew that he would be surprised when he got home from work.  And he was.  He was thrilled.  Sometimes I am such a good boy.  So, while I love the housekeeper at my job, she tends to drive me a little crazy.  She considers me to be one of her children and attempts to take care of me as such.  She brings me juice and fruit almost every morning and whenever I need anything, she goes out of her way to get it for me.  For example, one day I needed toilet paper, so, Angela, put a few rolls into my backpack.  One day I needed chocolate syrup (heywe all need certain things at certain times) and Angela got some for me and surprised me with it.  In return, I try to take care of anything that she needs: photocopies, postage on her letters, translating broken English into broken Spanish.  Its a good balance.    However, she is now starting to get on my nerves.  First off, she talks to me non-stop.  As anyone who has ever worked with me before knows, I dont really like to have hour-long conversations at work.  I have a lot to do and I hate wasting time on insignificant banter.  Or, I have my work done and really need the extra time to read online journals or play around in gay chat rooms.  You understand.  And to top all of this offshe now told me that she doesnt want to see me drinking soda anymore at work.    Angela:  Soda is bad for body. Joe:  But Angela, I love soda.  I need to drink soda every day or else I lose my mind. A:  No Joe.  You drink water. J:  But I dont like water.  It tastes gross. A:  Grrrrrross?  (she trills rs cuz she is Spanish) J:  Water tastes like nothing and I just like drinking some soda during the day. A:  No more soda.  No more. J:  (okayback off!)  Fine, I will drink more water, but can I just have a soda once in awhile? A:  NO SODA!  I have had no soda for years.  Some time I have soda, but only one time year. J:  (laughing)  So  you  can have soda, but I cant. A:  You have soda one time year. J:  I have soda one time day. A:  No Joe.  No soda. J:  Fine Angela.  I wont drink soda. A:  You drink Seltzer soda. J:  SICK!  Never.  I hate seltzer water more than I hate regular water. A:  You drink water. J:  Huh? A:  YOU DRINK WATER. J:  Fine.  I will.  But just cuz you make me drink it. A:  No, you go get water now and drink. J:  But Im not thirsty. A:  OK.  Then I get you water drink. J:  (ARGH!)  No, Ill get it.  Thanks Mami (mommy), I will drink water from now on. A:  (Smiling and so happy with herself)  So now Im stuck drinking water when Angela is around and sneaking up to the soda machine for a quick fix when she is at lunch.  Man, it sucks working with your mom.  Plus, to be honest, I dont see whats so wrong with soda.  Despite the sodium, what else is wrong with it?  Theres no calories, no fat, no carbs, no nothing.  Its tasty water is what it is.  Fucking yum and fucking yum.  The only part of the story I left out is that Angela ripped a huge egg fart at my desk as she walked away.  She eats tons of vegetable, so her farts are totally rank.  I had to breathe through my nose for a good 3 minutes.  Its pretty sick.  My friend Angie is at the hospital because her grandmother is dying.  There is no hope for her at this point and they are currently trying to figure out when would be the most appropriate time to let her go.  From what Angie said, her grandmother is completely doped up to decrease her suffering.  Its incredibly sad and I feel horrible.  I wish I could do more for her, but at this point, I think she just needs to be with her family.  Ive been there and my heart breaks for her.  Oakily Doakily.  Off to lunch.    I am so hungry and so in need of pizza, but that just cant be a possibility.  I scarfed two slices down yesterday and am not allowed to scarf any down today.    That is unless nobody sees me.  Then it doesnt count.  HO YEAH!

      The most upsetting part of my day   Good Morning Joe,   This email has been long overdue, but after seeing you on Friday and thinking about our situation a bit more in depth, I concluded that I had to finally be completely honest with you on how I had felt and how I am feeling now.   From the day we met, I have felt an incredible connection with you. As you know, I very seldom open myself up to anyone, but with you it seemed easy. I enjoyed spending time with you and looked past and at times ignored your situation with Paul. In retrospect, that was a huge mistake on my part because all it did was confuse you and I even more. I never wanted to listen to what you had to say about where you stood on Paul because always in the back of my mind I figured you would break up with him and we would end up dating and it would all fall into place.   I underestimated the extent of your relationship with him, even though, in fairness to you, you tried to tell me in the most delicate of ways. But all I heard and listened to was how much you two were not getting along. All I saw were the little notes you would leave all around my apartment. All I heard were the optimistic things you would say about you and I, the hope that you displayed about having some sort of future with me. All the times we were with one another further made me feel like there was an honest chance that we would end up together. Sex was never as intense, it seemed like there was no one else in the entire world when I held you.  No one. Yes, Joe, I fell in love with you.   But now, I need to look out for myself. I need some serious time away from you. I know that I said I was ready to be your friend, but I am not. I can not afford to invest anymore time into something that has caused so much confusion and heartache for me. I need for my heart to heal. And during that time, I cant see you or talk with you or be in touch with you. Because if you were part of my life, even in a small way, I would always think of what could be. I would always think of having the chance to introduce you to people as my boy.   I dont know when I will be ready to see or speak to you again, only God knows. I do this because it is the fair thing for both of us. I dont want you to always be cautious around me, I do not always want to be thinking that there is a chance of something, because there is not. You and I are too far apart in this period of time in our lives. If God deems for us to meet again, than it will happen and I have all the faith in him to guide our lives in the best of ways.  But, I have to say goodbye for now. I do this because this is the best thing for us both. I have to walk away from this and go on with my life without you. But mainly, I do this because I love you, with every fiber of my being.   I will always keep you in my prayers along with your brother and loved ones.   Amahd    While I completely understand where Ahmad is coming from and while I know that he needs to do what he needs to do for himself, it still sucks that no matter WHAT I do, I cant secure any gay male friends.  Without sounding like an ego driven asshole, this type of thing happens to me all the time.  I dont always hook up with my potential gay male friends, but regardless, they either hate me or love me too much to be my friend.  Fuck.  Well, such is life.    I have to let Ahmad live hishowever he feels most comfortable.

      My head is spinning so fast on its axis that I feel as though I am coked up.  Man, I have been running around the office today as though I am on a SPEED high.  The day has flown by, but damn, Im actually TIRED from working so hard today.   So many things to talk about  First things first  My visit with Ahmad went wonderfully.  At first he was really upset and angry with me.  I gave him about an hour to tell me how I hurt him, destroyed his faith in love, and ruined the trust that we had worked so hard to build.  When he was finished, I explained my side of the scenario and apologized for hurting his feelings.  At the end I gave him the option to either pursue a friendship with me or to cut me off entirely.  He decided to keep our friendship.  After a couple of hours at the bar, I took him back to my apartment so that we could smoke and chill.  I thought that it would be the true test to see if we really could be  just friends .  It worked out fine.  When Ahmad was leaving he told me If you ever feel as though you want to try things out with us again, let me know.  But Ahmad, you are dating someone already.  Yes, but hes not you.  I kissed him on the cheek and he left.  It will take us time, but I am sure that if I handle this relationship maturely, I very well may make friends with someone that I have hooked up with previously.  Its never happened before, but this time I am determined.    SOthere is this girl and her name is  urlLink Shy Lux .  Turns out that Lux and I went to high school together.  Also turns out that she did the high school choir and musical and graduated a year after me.  It is IMPOSSIBLE for Lux and I to not know each other.  I mean, I was in choir for all 4 years of high school and I just about ate, shat, lived, and breathed the high school theater department.  I am positive that we were friends in school.  I know it.  ButI still dont know who she is.  I have put my detective hat on with this mystery and I am bound and determined to figure out who she is.  Oohthe suspense is killing me.  Luxif we figure out who each other arewe have to  promise  to keep total anonymity.  Promise?  Promise with your whole heart?  Paul and I had an incredible dinner on Saturday night.  He took me to one of the places he works at and everyone treated us like GOLD!  We were served just about every entre and appetizer they offered and all for free.  Everyone wanted to meet me and I felt as though I was a mini-celebrity.  The food was SO GOOD!  I had crab cakes and lobster salad and calamari and oysters and filet mignon and champagne and french fries, and my God there was so much more.  My stomach was completely distended from all of the food I shoved into my mouth.  I kept making Paul poke me in the belly cuz I was totally pregnant.    Paul treated me so well, paid for everything, and we laughed and snuggled all night long.  I wasnt going to tell him about Ahmad as I thought that it would be inviting an argument.  Yet, as Saturday nights dinner progressed, I found the right opportunity and threw the information into our conversation.  His face fell when I first brought it up, but I promised him that Ahmad and I are fully over and that I am overjoyed with how well his and my relationship is going.  He kissed me on the lips and I knew that all was well.  My brother is fine!  Of COURSE hes fine.  God is taking such good care of him.  He called us all on Saturday morning, just in time for my parents to salvage some semblance of their weekend.  He was on the firing range when the fatality occurred, but he said that he is okay and that he is dealing with it, just like he is dealing with everything else thats fucked up there.  He is making me so proud that I cant even put it into words.  My brother, the solider.  Weird.  I am going to the Poconos for Labor Day weekend with my best friends from college.  There are 5 girls and ME!  Baby Joe.  Everythings all planned and as I get closer to Friday, I get more and more excited.  It is the only time of the year that we are all together and it is non-stop hilarity and fun.  For some reason, our 6 drastically different personalities blend so well.  Man, it will be a weekend to remember.  Off to stay the night at Pauls apartment.  Now that things are going so well with us, I actually get EXCITED to spend the evening with him.  He makes me laugh so hard.   And thats that!

      For some reason I was so excited about today being Friday that I couldnt fall asleep last night.  I was working on my lines for the show until 2am and then I lay in bed staring at the wall with weekend jitters.  It was so weird!  Like it is my birthday or something.  Man, it should TOTALLY be my birthday again.  That shit is fun.  Our rehearsal last night went well.  Actually for the first hour or so I was in a pretty horrible mood because I was starting to feel the stress of not having a full cast, the pressures and inconveniences of a new space, and the fact that we havent had a solid rehearsal in two weeks.  Sure, weve HAD rehearsal; they just havent been intensive.    Ian, the guy that plays opposite me in the show, is fast becoming my new best friend.  He is such a tough guy, but for some reason he and I have a great rapport with each other.  When Megan and Kelly were auditioning the girls last night, Ian and I went to another room to work on our scenes.  Ian could tell that I wasnt in the best of moods and he asked me what was wrong.  We both discussed our fears, the changes, and our excitement about the upcoming show.  He had some great advice and we both walked away from the conversation feeling much better.  I asked him to go out with me and have a beer in order to get to know each other a little bit better and he was all for it.  I just love this kid.  I couldnt ask for a better partner in the show.  My parents are crazy today.  There was a report on CNN this morning explaining that a soldier in my brothers unit was killed yesterday at a firing range exercise.  My brother was supposed to be at the firing range yesterday, so my parents are convinced that he was the fatality.  I tried my damndest to calm my mother down, but my dad had already pushed her over the edge.  I understand that they are worried and scared.  Every day is a living nightmare for them.  I wish there was SOMETHING that I could do, but unfortunately there isnt.  I tell them that I am positive it wasnt Winfield who was hurt and that they have to trust and believe that God will keep him safe.  But it doesnt matter.  My parents are going to worry themselves into an early grave regardless.  I fucking hate the war and I fucking hate the fact that my brother is in the ARMY.  There isnt much more I can say about it.  I  fucking  hate this shit.  Heres a funny little story to get our Fridays off on the right foot  The summer before my senior year in college, I dated this guy named Kevin.  We dated for a month, 2 weeks of which he spent in Florida on vacation.  I dated a number of guys while home in Albany for my summer breaks from college, but Kevin was the only one that I stayed with for more than a week.  And even him I couldnt stand after 9 days.  (reason number one why Paul is so special and important to me3 years and 9 monthsI have never committed to a guy for even half that amount of time)  One time, Kelly and Angie (her ex) and I were at Kevins house hanging out, drinking some wine, and playing Balderdash.  Out of nowhere, I had to take the biggest shit.  I snuck out of the room and used one of the bathrooms that was off to the side of the rest of the house.  I remember that the bathroom was salmon colored and that there was a washing machine and dryer in the same room.  (it was a huge bathroom)  I squirted out my typical diarrhea-esque shit and when I went to stand up and flush the toilet, I accidentally knocked a clean stack of washing clothes into the pool of shit resting happily in the toilet.  I let out a yelp and immediately tried to fish the cloths out.  They were covered in poop water.  Mortified, I panicked as to what to do to solve this situation.  Once all of the wash cloths were retrieved, I flushed the toilet and stood there, sweat pouring from my brow.  Then it hit methe washing machine!  I threw the dirty shit covered wash clothes into the washing machine and decided that I would turn it on and clean everything up.  Then it hit meif I turned the washing machine on, Kevin would know that something was up and he might figure me out.  And thats when I got an even better idea!    I opened up the dryer and noticed that there was a pile of dry clothes sitting inside.   Cover Up Time .  I shoved the shitty washcloths to the bottom of the clean clothes and then shut the door and exhaled a huge sigh of relief.  I exited the bathroom and no one was ever the wiser.  Cept for the lucky person who took out the clothes to fold them and found 15 different washcloths covered in diarrhea poop.  Hahahahahaha oh God, why did I think that was  good idea.    In any case, I was never busted for it and I broke up with Kevin a week later.  Whats done is done!  Okay yall!    Have an EXCELLENT weekend!    And remember  Pussy is best eaten with a little Tobasco sauce and a ton of salt.    Yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuum!

      Oh thank the Lord that it is almost the weekend.  This week has been so crazy that I feel as though I am going to collapse in exhaustion.  Too bad that I have a ton of shit to do this weekend.  Luckily, some of it is fun and not centered around errands and chores.  Damn those errands and chores.  I saw  Freddy Vs. Jason  last night and I LOVED it.  Yes, it was campy and yes, the acting was horrific, but it was such a wonderful throw back to the originals that it would have been impossible for me not to love every second.  Freddy is definitely getting older and Jason seems to be getting bigger (new actor playing the part), but they can still hack up bodies with the best of them.  I never realized how hard Jason swings his machete.  Man, he rips through bodies like nobodys business.  I almost got hard watching him sling around his brute force.   On Friday night I will be hanging out with Ahmad.  He was originally supposed to go to Albany to visit a friend, but the trip was cancelled.  Now, he and I are meeting up for drinks so that we can get some closure on our past dating relationship.  I have promised myself that I will not kiss him, hug him for too long, or insinuate in any way that he and I should ever date again.  I want him as a friend and realize that it is up to me whether or not we act out on our physical attraction.  No matter how drunk I getI REFUSE to kiss his mouth.  Okay, maybe once.  Okay, maybe twice, but I SWEAR that I will never touch his dick again.  Never.  Ever.  Whatever.  I just love Paul so much.  Although he wasnt thrilled to go see  Freddy Vs. Jason , he went willingly and was a gem throughout the entire experience.  After the movie was over, I wanted to stop and get a bite to eat and he wanted to go to the local grocery store and make dinner.  At first I was irritated because I didnt want to have to MAKE dinner at midnight, but I gave in and put on my happy face as we did our shopping.  When we got home, he decided he wasnt hungry.  At first I wanted to rip his face off, cuz all I wanted to eat was a fast food hamburger and maybe some fries.  But I didnt yell, I simply explained that he wanted to go food shopping and now I was stuck without anything to eat.  Without question, Paul got up, went into the kitchen made me two grilled cheese sandwiches, a salmon plate with cream cheese and crackers, and poured me a glass of soda.  It was amazing.  Usually we would fight over something like this and would probably go to bed hungry and angry.  But now we have this new communication thing going and instead of yelling, we talk and fix the problem.  I went to bed full and happy.  Mariah invited us both to go see Tori Amos on Saturday, but I had to say no because I simply dont have the money.  Paul really wanted to go, but he and I had plans to go to dinner on Saturday night.  When I heard him tell Mariah that he would go to the concert anyway, I bit my tongue and shut up about it.  Later on in the evening, Paul surprised me by saying that if I dont have the money to go to the concert, he wont go either and he will still take me out to dinner.  I looked him in the eyes and smiled.  We kissed, then we hugged, then we kissed again.  Its like I have a REAL relationship now.  And I am thrilled.  When things are going well with Paul, everything else in my life seems to fall into place.  I am SO glad that I didnt do anything irrational and break up with him.  Yes, I have been upset with him for a long time, but deep down I just knew that we werent ready to end what we have going.  Love requires patience and understanding and Im not convinced that I gave him enough of that when we were having our problems.  It takes two people to fight and it takes two people to have a loving relationship.  It is very possible that I was a huge part of the problem as well.  I am relieved that we are giving this one more chance.    Even more of a reason why I cant do ANYTHING with Ahmad when I see him.  Self-control, self-control, self-control.    Tonight we are auditioning two new girls to replace the one that had to be booted from the production.  I PRAY that one of these girls will work out.  We are six weeks away from opening night and we desperately need a ton of work.  At this point, I am the only one who is memorized for the show.  I understand that everyone has a lot going on in their lives and that we dont have to be fully memorized until Monday, but I would be lying if I said that I wasnt a bit concerned.  It is impossible for us to run whole scenes if there is even one person who is still working off of the script.  It is inevitable that the new girl will be working with the lines in her hand for the first two weeks, which is even more of a reason why Kelly, Ian, and I have to have our shit together.  It is our responsibility to pick up the slack.  So yeah, Im a bit concerned.  Tomorrow is Friday!  FUCKING YAY.    It really couldnt come fast enough.  (I love you poodle!)

      Wellity, wellity, wellity  Its Wednesday!  YaHOOOOOOOOOOOO!  Tonight I am going to see  Freddy Vs. Jason !!!  Its like my favorite day of the year or something.  I heard the movie is super good and I cant wait to sit there and watch two of the classic monster men of my time battle the fuck out of each other.  I dont know yet if there is a winner in this match of doom, but personally, if there is, I want it to be Freddy.  That fucker gave me nightmares for years.  I was obsessed with him.    I remember one dream in particular.    I was waiting for the school bus at night with some friends.  The bus pulled up, we all got on board and started driving to school.  We hadnt gotten a mile from my house when Freddy appeared outside the bus windows and was like Ill KEEL you.  Of course we all screamed and then everything goes a bit fuzzy.  But I do remember that somehow Freddy fell inside of the bus engine and was turned into green puree.  We all cheered and then got boners.   Or something.  It was a long time ago.  We also came up with a game that we would play all the time.  My brother and I would have friends over and we would play Freddy.  Yeah, original name, I know.  The details of the game were this: Everyone had to go into one room and pretend that they were sleeping.  You would have to fake go to sleep so that you would wake up in the dreamworld.duh!  When you woke up, you had to search through the pitch-black house for the kid who was playing Freddy Kruegar.  We would all stick together and detail search the rooms, convinced that somehow the child playing Freddy would be able to hide in places that were just not possible for a little kid.  But Freddy had POWERS, so you never know.  It is the dreamworld after all.  He could easily turn himself into the family dog and when you went to pet himWHAMall of your fingers get sliced off.  (Children and their imaginations.  SIKE.  Adults and their imaginations.)  Once Freddy jumped out of his hiding spot, it was up to all of us to run as fast as we could back to the room that we started in and jump back into our designated sleeping positions so that we could wake upalive.  When you woke up, you would notice who was killed and who wasnt by how many people were left in the room.  The missing people obviously became helpers of Freddy until everyone was slashed and brutally murdered.  It was just about the most fun game we created when we were little.  My brother and I were never actually allowed to watch the  Nightmare on Elm Street  movies when we were younger.  My parents deemed them too horrifying for our fragile little minds.  So we would wait until my parents went to bed and sneak down to watch them.  I specifically remember sleeping on the very outermost edge of my bed, SO terrified that Freddy was going to stick his knife-wielding hand up through my mattress and into my gut.  I slept that way for a year I think.  Sometimes I still wonder if hes coming for me.  Needless to say, the day cant go fast enough.  I want me some  Freddy Vs. Jason  and I want it now.  Ahmad and I are back in touch as of this morning.  I called him during the blackout and he wrote me an email this morning.  We have been exchanging notes back and forth all day.  He is fully dating someone newthis guy Leo, whom I have mentioned before.  When I asked Ahmad to describe Leo to me this morning, this is what he wrote:   Leo is around your height, but looks nothing like you. He has blond hair and big blue eyes. Things are not serious, we are just dating. I have only known him for about a month so we will see. He is a little pit bull since he wrestled in school. It is weird, because you call me Mahd, and he calls me Mahdy Mahd. I cant escape this nickname.   Perfectly acceptable description right?  This is what I wrote back about Leo:   Mahdy Mahd, eh? SNORE. sike. I will stick with the plain old "Mahd". He's a little pit bull? I don't picture that as being your type, but what do I know? You look way past the physical anything and go for the personality, so I am sure that he is a sweetheart of a guy. Good luck with him my man.  I hope Freddy Krueger slashes his ugly face.   Ok, so I didnt say anything about his ugly face, but I tried to be as open minded about it as I could.  It was me who brought him up, so I couldnt justifiably be too much of a dick about it.  Either waya wrestler??  I am kind of jealous.  Cuz I want to date a wrestler.  And I want Ahmad to like me still.    Yes, I realize that this is completely selfish.  But this is my journal and I want him to like me.   Sorry, I just spanked myself for acting like such a spoiled child.    Baby Joe can do no wrong.  --That was what all of my girls in school used to say about me.  I have a big mouth and I do some fucked up things sometimesyet Baby Joe can do no wrong.    In any caseI will try to be as mature and responsible with Ahmads feelings as I can.    Yeah right.    I live for me man.    Dont we all live for me?

      Holy shit.  Its been such a chaotic last five days.  I seriously feel as though the world must be blowing up.  Otherwise, why would everyone and everything be so far out of my hands?    Lets break it down:  1) Work is a mad house.  I have so much to do and no time to do it.  SO MUCH and NO TIME. 2) There are now auditions on Thursday to replace the girl that had to be booted from the show. 3) My friend, Jessica, came into town for 5 days.  I saw her Saturday night and was unable to see her again due to the fact that the world is pretending to fall apart. 4) I got a KILLER migraine yesterday and put myself farther behind with everything.  Instead I lay clutching my head for about 11 straight hours in a warm, completely dark room.   5) The power came on for me on Friday, but because of the outage, I was unable to go to the dermatologist, I lost all of the food that I just bought, AND my office was closed.  Thus making the world start to fall apart. 6) My apartment was a revolving door all weekend.  People in, people out, people all about.  It was nuts and eventually I had to run away from it all.   7) The Theater Company has decided to lease their own rehearsal/performance space for the next couple of months.  This is GREAT news for them, but it totally adds to the chaos.  Kelly is thrilled with the space.  I have yet to see it, but know that I will be spending the rest of the next two months there.  The only thing that I wasnt thrilled about is the fact that the space is in Brooklyn.  Luckily it is only one subway stop into the borough, but my travel time to and from rehearsal has just increased by a half an hour each way.  We will start going to this new space a week from today.  I should climb in bed now and sleep, cuz Lord knows I wont be sleeping again for the next 8 weeks.      So much!  Eh?    Also, I am so broke.  Like, penniless.  It has been so hard to survive this month for some reason.  While I am THRILLED to be going to the Poconos over Labor Day with my friends from college, I still dont know how I am going to afford it.  I have to talk to my friend Rita about it.  My heart is pounding with debt fear and I dont yet know how to handle it.  She will make me feel better.  She always does.   Now that I have spit all of that out  The power outage, while being slightly irritating, was just about the coolest thing to happen in a while.  NYC was drenched in blackness for a whole day!  I ended up going over to Aris, drinking a bottle of wine, and catching a cab to my house around 12:30am.  Talk about SPOOKY!  Times Square was completely empty of both cars and people.  It was like  28 Days Later  cept with less human brain eating.  You understand.  Everyone banded together and treated like one big holiday.  I wasnt afraid for a second.  It was an inconvenience for me, but was cushioned by the fact that everyone, regardless of economic status, race, sexual orientation, was stuck in the same position.  Its like the one time during life when we are all one in the same.    Since I had no power, I called everyone I knew when I got home, but no one was around.  Probably in bed, since it was close to 1am when I finally made it into my apartment.  I was convinced that there would be a killer hiding in my apartment when I got inside, but there wasnt.  Just rotting food and a freaked out cat.  I threw both in the garbage and made my phone calls.  Hope everyone else is doing well.  I feel so out of the loop.    Time to get my work done and jump back in.    GAH!    Oh.  And also  ACK!

       WHY  is it that  EVERY  time we all go out to the bars, there is an excessive amount of drama??  I just dont get it.  It literally follows us.    Mariah and I showed up at  The Hangar  around 7pm last night and were unimpressed from the get go.  The bar itself was very dark and covered in red lighting.  The people were no younger than 47 years old and each of the guys made sure to wear their dirtiest wife beaters.  Too bad the amount of wrinkles and flabby arms deterred me from staring at all the bodies.  The one good thing is that the happy hour goes until 9pm and it was 2 for 1!  I must have downed at least 5 vodka tonics in 2 hours.  I was drinking so fast that I had to switch to Baileys.  Embarrassing yes, but worth it not to puke?  Yes again.  The MINUTE Mariah and I walked into the bar, the bouncer (bouncer? hahahahahe had flames shooting directly out of his ASS) gave us a hard time.  He stared at us throughout the duration of the evening and at one point, followed us into the bathroom.  Mariah asked him Why are you watching us and following us around the bar?  His reply was Cuz I know that you two are going to have sex in my restroom.  WHA?!?!?!  Fucking toolbag.  It seems that every time Mariah and I go out, we have such a hard time dealing with the other people at the bar.  Either they cant stop putting their hands all over us or they are unbelievably cruel to us because they think were straight.  Its fucking frustrating.  I was always told that gay men were SO accepting.  Fuck that noise.    The straw that broke Mariahs back was when the bouncer came over to her and asked her to Stop dancing.  When we burst out laughing IN his face, he got the manager and we were told that dancing was prohibited.  What a fucking LAME place!  A bunch of people met us at the bar, I ended up dropping my empty glass on the floor and smashing in right in front of the bouncer, Mariah got yet ANOTHER reaming by the fuckhead manager and we knew that it was time to go.  On the way out, I looked the bouncer right in his ugly face and told him that he "was a disappointment to the gay community while Paul spit on the floor.  Yet, I still dont know why poor little us come in contact with so much drama.  hahahaSnarf.  Needless to say, we will NEVER be going back to  The Hangar .      Things that I am excited about:    Going to the dermatologist tomorrow!  Finally my face will be BEEYOUTIFULL and free of rash-like bullshit.  Starting a semi-regular routine of going out to the gay bars with a group of gay guys.  My friend Ian and I are organizing the group and I am so happy to finally be able to have some gay guys to hang out with.  I mean, every good gay needs a group like this.  Paul and I are treating each other with respect and kindness.  Things are going better than they ever have before.  Line of communication = fully open now.  Getting SO much work done at my job this week.  The fact that I am already fully memorized for the play.  And as far as I know, the first one to do so.  Got to talk to my brother yesterday for a HALF AN HOUR!  The conversation was incredible.    Things that I am NOT excited about:    The back up for Robyns part in the show, Ingrid, will be unable to do the role.  Now the company will have to re-hold all new auditions because the rest of the girls that had tried out are either not good enough for the part or dont fit into it in any way.     Had grilled cheese and fries for lunch.  It wasnt my fault though.  I promise.  I went with my friend, Ian, and he told me that I should get it.  I blame him for my jelly rollserbelly rolls.  Well, thats a short list!  And surely a good sign that things are going well.  Before I goI am going to give a brief synapses of  The Osbournes  season finale so that if you dont have cable or live on another planet, you will be filled in on what happened Tuesday night.  If you dont want to know, then now is your chance to leave my page and move on out.    SYNAPSES  Seems that Jack Osbourne has a sleepwalking problem.  He explains, for the first half of the episode, that he has been having violent sleepwalking attacks where he hurts anyone that wakes him up, etc.  This is further proved by film documentation.  Kelly gets into a HUGE fight with her mother that results in the two of them parting ways as manager and client.  There is a ton of screaming by Kelly culminating in her HYSTERICALLY dramatic exit from the Osbourne household.  Picture her wearing a black wig, tons of make-up and sunglasses, all the while throwing her packed suitcases down the stairs.  The entire time, no one notices, although Kelly is pouring her soul into the performance.  One night, Jack is sleeping in his bed.  He seems to wake up and notice Minnie (Sharons favorite dog) standing next to his bed.  Without any hesitation, he grabs Minnie in his arm and pulls her into his bed.  At that point, we see him struggle ( slightly  out of view of the camera) with Minnie and we hear the dog crying for help.  Jack twists Minnies neck and kills her.    The next morning Jack wakes up to find Minnies dead body in his bed.  He responds by saying whoa.  He gets out of bed, somehow wraps up Minnie in a blanket and shoves the dead body in a duffle bag.  All the while, Sharon and Ozzy are running around the house screaming Minnies name.  Minnie where ARE you?  MINNIE!  Jack is seen running down the stairs and out of the Osbourne house, duffel bag in tow.  A couple of minutes later, the phone rings and Ozzy answers.    Jack:  Dad, Ive done something really fucked up. Ozzy:  What is it?  You know you can tell me anything. J:  Dad, Ive killed Minnie. O:  Whawha(jumbled ex-heroine addict talk)Iuh J:  Dad, I killed Minnie while I was sleeping.  I dontIdad O:  You better not be pulling my leg Jack.  This isnt funny.  Jack J:  Dad, Minnie is dead.  Dont tell mom.  Please dont tell her. O:  But I have to tell her.  Jack I have to tell your mother. J:  Oh god dad, Minnie is dead.  They hang up and the next scene is Ozzy confronting Sharon:  Ozzy:  Sharon, I have terrible news. Sharon:  What is it Ozzy?  What is it? O:  Sharon, Minnie is dead.  Minnie is dead. S:  Youre just trying to round (wind?) me up.  Youre just trying to wind me up. O:  Sharon, Minnie is dead.  Jack killed Minnie.  Minnie is dead. S:  Minnieeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! O:  (Crying and shaking uncontrollably) Sharon, I am so sorry.  Sharon, Minnie is dead! S:  MINNIE!  Next scene  Sharon packs up everything that reminds her of Minnie, kisses Ozzy on the forehead, while hes sleeping, and leaves the house.    The phone rings and Ozzy answers:  O:  Sharon, where are you? S:  I had to leave the house.  Everything there reminds me of Minnie.  I need some time alone. O:  Sharon, come home.  Sharon please. S:  Ozzy, I need to be by myself.  I need to be away from the house right now. O:  (borderline hysterical again)  Sharon dont do anything dangerous.  Sharon dont do anything dangerous. S:  I need to be away from the house. O:  Sharon dont do anything dangerous.  Sharon I love you. --click  So, we, the audience, sit staring at the television in complete horror.  It was like a nation-wide moment of horrified silence.  Everyone processing it in a different way.  After  Ozzy gets off the phone with Sharon, he attempts to change the television station.  He is unsuccessful and goes to walk up the stairs.  Thats when the director calls Cut!.  The camera pans around and Kelly and Jack are there and Minnie is being held by Sharon!  (Although Minnie looked like she had grown by 50 pounds)  The show was over and it was all a hoax.  But you tell ME that you didnt believe in it as it was happening.    Personally, I think that they did this episode, not to make everyone think that the whole show was faked, but to let everyone know how influential the editing of a TV show really is.  We, as members of the watching audience, are convinced that everything we see is for real; that we are seeing directly into their house, into their lives.  That couldnt be farther from the truth.  We are only seeing what MTV wants us to see, what MTV wants us to know about the Osbournes.  It was their way of reminding us that it is still a television show, afterall.  I LOVED the episode.  It was, probably, the most ingenious 30 minutes of television that I have seen over the last couple of months.  The whole thing was SO believable.  I heard that Sharon, Jack, and Kelly were playing a joke on Ozzy and thats how the idea of the show came about.  Interestingespecially since I took so much more away from it than that.    You must see it in person.  But if for some reason you are unable to, I hope this synapses did the episode justice.    It was so unreal.  The whole thing.   Happy watching!

      Kelly and I hung out last night and had a few drinks together.  We havent done that in a long time and it was pretty fun.  It gave us a chance to catch up on things that have been on our mind.  And it gave her the chance to tell me of something horrible that happened with our show.  Turns out that the girl that we cast in the show, Robyn, is a member of Actors Equity.  This means that she is in the theater union.  Actors that are in Equity are not allowed to do any show that isnt sponsored by Equity.  There are a million rules and guidelines when an actor is in this union.  Usually its a great benefit, but in this case it is not good at all.  Our director, Megan, had to call Robyn at home last night and tell her that she is no longer in the show.  Robyn told Megan that she had to get off the phone because she was going to start crying.  We all felt horrible for Robyn and horrible for ourselves.  I mean, we have rehearsed for a month together and now we have to cast a new girl in her place.    Robyn should have known of the Equity rules before she auditioned for the play.  I am absolutely stunned that she was unaware of the guidelines.  Kellys friend, Ingrid, is going to take her place.  Hopefully.  Ingrid is an excellent actress, although not the first choice for the part.  She will do a great job if she decides to take it, but its going to be crunch time trying to catch her up to speed.  Honestly, having to recast this part is about the last thing any of us want to deal with right now.  Stupid Robyn and her stupid Actors Equity card.    Did you SEE  The Osbournes  last night??  I mean,  did you???   Holy FUCK!  In my opinion, it was the BEST episode that I have seen over the last three seasons.  I so badly want to tell everyone what happened, but I dont want to give it away, just in case there are a few people slow on the uptake.  Everyone that I have talked to about it has a different opinion on what it all meant.  Personally, I think that the family wanted everyone to see how influential the editing of a show really is.  You cant always believe everything you see on TV.  And how often do we all take this for granted?  I certainly do.  If you put a slice of cheese on television and tell me that its actually a slice of dark chocolate, well, I would believe you.  Why wouldnt I?  And how dare you lie to me.    My favorite part of the episode could very well be Kelly Osbourne packing up her shit to move out.  With her wig and sunglasses on, she looked like Judy Garland post alcoholic breakdown.  It was unreal and fucking awesome.  Especially when the truth was revealed.  WHAT A GREAT SHOW!  Joe CuttheShit gives it four dicks straight up!  Meeting up with Mariah after work for some drinks.  We are going to place called  The Hangar .  I have yet to go to this gay bar and to be honest, am slightly scared of it.  When I checked it out online, it looked like the crowd was compiled of ex-cons who decided to dedicate their entire existence to the leather lifestyle.  Yikes.  Here comes Joe and Mariah, two of the prettiest, most UNTHREATENING people on the planet to have some vodka tonics.  Wish me luck.  I plan to be either raped or murdered in the first five minutes.  Ehas long as the drinks are cheap. And as long as the fucks are long and hard.   Why I  Love  French Fries   You go so well with crumbly bleu cheese. You look so cute sitting atop my knees. You taste so good slathered in Mayo I laugh out loud when you say Heyo!  My friend, my love, the dear french fry, The hope of marrying you could make me cry. Your truthful nature, your loving embrace, Fruits and veggies vanish without a trace.  I aspire to your incredible heights of glory I knew a girl in school named Dory. Dory was a nice and ugly lesbian Who didnt eat french fries, so the end.   Man, I gotta shit.  So bad.    I love you, you love me, homo-sexu-ali-ty!  Enjoy whatever the nighttime brings.

      I was minding my own business, taking a casual stroll to get my haircut  My discman was blaring TLCS latest disc,  3D , and I had a cigarette in my mouth.  Out of nowhere, this psycho scumbag steps in front of me and goes Give me a cigarette.  I didnt even see him approach and it took me off guard.  I replied No man.  Sorry.  I never broke stride once, yet the man followed on my heels and said forcefully Give me a cigarette.  When I kept walking and ignoring him, he took his hand and smacked me extremely hard on the back.  Without even thinking, I whirled around and shoved him hardright on to his ass.  Dont EVER fucking touch me mother FUCKER!  He stared at me, eyes gaping, while lying on the ground.  I turned and kept walking.  Unafraid.    For the next 5 blocks or so, it took all of the strength I had in my body to keep my hands from shaking uncontrollably.  I dont like physical confrontation of ANY kind, but fuck if I am going to let ANYONE shove me around in this city.  I feel bad for knocking this dickhead on the ground, but I also feel justified.  God, I dont know what came over me.  One minute I was jamming out to TLC, the next minute I knocked some dude on his ass.  Damn, Im ruff and tuff with my afro puffs.  Had a very uneventful weekend.  Sort of.  I did see  The Hours , which blew my mind.  I also saw  Punch-Drunk Love , which solidified my belief that Paul Thomas Anderson is the BEST and most INGENIUS director out there.  And finally, I saw  Deliver Us From Eva  and was horribly disappointed that LL Cool J only took off his shirt once.  AND he was covered by the bedsheet the whole time.  FUCKING LAME!  Oh yeah and I attempted to watch Wes Cravens  They  but I got so frustrated with it that I didnt even finish watching it.  Now, besides all of the movies I saw this weekend  Paul came over on Saturday night and we had our talk.    The minute I told him that I thought we should take a break, he said Fine and got up to leave.  When I grabbed his arm and made him sit down to talk about it all, he burst into tears and sobbed for awhile.  He told me that he hates himself right now and has for a very long time.  He admits to treating me poorly and knows that he doesnt deserve me.  He talked long and hard about his parents, his life in NYC, his failure at our relationship, and his imploding restaurant career.    When he was finished, I held him for a long time.  I told Paul that I am very much in love with him, but think we should take a break because we are slowly destroying each other.  Paul acknowledges this and said that he understands if I need to be away from him.  I told him that I didnt want to do that at all, that what I really wanted was to have my boyfriend back, the guy that I fell so hard for 3 and a half years ago.  Paul promised to work harder on making me happy.  He promised that he will do his best to make me first priority and to treat me with nothing less than kindness.  Paul promised that I wont have to wonder if I should be with him anymore.  I took all of what he said with a grain of salt.  While I would love to believe him, I know how unlikely it is that he will turn it all around.  And if he doesnt, he is now prepared for me to leave him.    The rest of Saturday night went very well and when we woke up on Sunday morning, we made beautiful love to together.  I KNOW!  3rd time since January!  Cept that this time, I felt it.  Our kisses were real and not forced.  His touch made me melt and his arm around me made me feel like he really loved my body, my heart, and my soul.  I came within minutes.    So, the Paul and Joe saga is far from closed.  We will continue on together, cuz thats what people in love do.  But I have definitely learned some lessons from this whole thing and I am a bit less scared about having to leave him, if the time for that should come.  I appreciate all of the support that my friends have given me throughout this rough time period in my life.  Without that support, I might have done something totally irrational.  I have been known, you know?  Tonight Paul and I are celebrating our talk with a bottle of champagne and a nice dinner in the East Village.  I am pretty excited.  Pedro was right about us communicating better.  Even though we talk all the time, we dont necessarily  talk  all the time.  I have to work on keeping that line of communication open.  As long as he keeps working on himself.  The two boys, together again.

      The reason I'm in love with Paul is simple.    I know him.    I can read him.  I have learned what there is to know about him.  I can predict his moods, his words, his thoughts. I know what makes him happy and conversely I know what makes him sad.  I know what Paul is capable of and because of this I am often disappointed by everything I have come to know.    What do I love most?  There is no fear with Paul.  I'm 100% convinced that Paul is in love with me.  I'm completely sure that Paul has found the guy he  wants to be with for the rest of his life.  There is no doubt in my mind that Paul would do anything he could to hold on to me.  It took me a while to catch on to this, for me to figure out his pattern.  Paul has always been a challenge for me.  I was never sure what priority I was in his life.  It made me have to work for the relationship.  It forced me to forego all of my previous stigmas.  No one before Paul has made me want to sacrifice my happiness.  No one before Paul has made me as obsessed as I have been in the past.  Obsessed with being the perfect boyfriend.    As much as I'd like to believe that Paul and I have an open line of communication, I am now starting to think that it's just the  opposite.  We have so much anger in our relationship resulting from numerous bad experiences that we have encountered along the way.  Mariah told me today that Paul said that "the Bahamas trip was the best time that Joe and I could have ever had.  It was the time of my life."  If he believes this way, then how can I sit here and say that Paul deserves to be dropped on his ass?  Why do  I think that I'm at all justified in causing this breakup?    Yes, I am unsatisfied.  It's been 8 months since we've made love and I can't even begin to explain how much that hurts me.  He  doesn't shower me with praise and he never surprises me with fun things.  He doesn't ask how my day was and he doesn't verbally support me in any of my endeavors.  Paul does not put his arm around me when I am sad.  I can't cry with Paul and feel comfortable about it.    He doesn't buy me a pair of shoes when the soles of my shoes are completely deteriorated.  Paul is inconsistent with his attentiveness to our relationship.  He can go a full week without calling me once.  It's common for him to go away for a weekend and never call me once.  Paul doesn't like to get out of the house or do anything spontaneious.  He doesn't want to party with me.  He doesn't want to do anything crazy.  And worst of all, he doesn't have fun with me when we are in a group of people.  Paul and I aren't a team.  Never have been.   These are the things that I need to say to Paul when we have our final conversation about the future of our relationship.    I am ready.    I am ready to be single.  I am ready to live my life for me now.  I am ready to be the Joe CuttheShit that I meant to be when I  graduated from college.  I have dreams.  I have hopes and desires (luv u reets) and I have things that I want to do and  experience in my life.  I didn't move to NYC (one of the BIGGEST cities in the world) to sit around and not enjoy it.  To sit in  my room at night and be afraid of the good things that are coming my way.   I don't see how any conversation with Paul could save our relationship.  There isn't much that he can say that will give me a new perspective on...us.  I don't see how there is any difference between our relationship and our friendship.  There is a popular term in the gay community for lesbians who stay together too long, much longer than was necessary for either person.  This term is  Lesbian Deathbed .  While Paul and I aren't lesbians (surprised?), we are stuck in the worst "deathbed" I've ever seen.  We are destroying eachother.  Not helping or changing.  Fucking lesbians and their damn deathbed.  I always thought that when I broke up with my first "real boyfriend" it would be because one of us fucked up; that one of us would have cheated on the other person or killed their mother or knocked their teeth out.  But it's not like that all the time.  This time, two boys who are very much in love with each other can't figure out how to have a stable, supportive, and edifying relationship.  It's very sad.  More than that, it's heartbreaking.  These are all of the things I need to say to Paul when we have our conversation.  The reason why I haven't wanted to confront it up until now is simple.  As simple as me being in love with him.    I love Paul more than I want to hurt him.    Yet, there is truth to the theory of living for oneself.  Loving yourself so that you can love someone else.  If the person you're with doesn't make you love yourself, then it's time to rethink the whole situation.    It could be time to find my roots and move on.

      I got advice today from the most unlikely of people.  I was outside having a cigarette during my morning smoke break when the front desk attendant of my building came out and sat next to me.  At first I was a little irritated because I just wanted to sit by myself, smoke my butt, and clear my head.  When Pedro came out he sat down and lit up his smoke.   Whats wrong Joe?  You dont seem like yourself lately. What do you mean?  Im fine. Oh come on, you cant fool me my man.  Your face is dragging on the ground.  Things with Paul ok?  I looked at Pedro for a minute and instead of replying with my usual No, everythings fine, I decided to tell him whats going on.  I think Paul and I are going to break up.  Things havent been going well for a while now and Im afraid that I am going to have to cut things off with him.  I explained in further detail as he listened to me with complete interest.  After I finished speaking, Pedro told me a story about he and his wife, Marilyn.  He explained that although they have been married for decades, they have had numerous moments of calling it quits.  But the one thing that always seemed to save their relationship was the fact that they could sit down and have a serious and open conversation about their problems.  He advised me to sit down with Paul and to talk to him.  At least one last time.  You never know what could come out of the conversation, Joe.  He could surprise you.  But Pedro, I have had numerous conversations with him about our problematic relationship.  Why should I have to do it again?  Because you committed 3 years of your life to him, Joe.  If you truly love him or did love him at one point, you owe it to both of you to have one more open conversation before you call it quits.  He may not fully understand why you are so hurt.  I appreciated Pedro sitting with me and giving me the advice that he did.  I took everything he said and digested it throughout the day.  Since I have always been someone who needs to make a decision about things as quickly as possible, I have had unending ahgida over confronting this head on.  I feel a bit better now.  It was nice to have someone tell me that I should give Paul the chance to explain himself.   I am very influenced by my friends and most of them have told me to cut Paul loose, which in all reality is probably what will happen.  But I liked having someone give me the other perspective.  I will be going into this conversation with Paul with an open mind.  And thats whats most important.  Rita called me yesterday, despite my vain attempts to hide from her.  She always senses when Im not doing well and yesterday she broke through my wall and got in touch with me.  As soon as I answered the phone I opened up my heart and told her everything that was bothering me.  Luckily I only started to cry once.  Rita has this way of pulling everything out of me.  I just open up and spill my guts.  She is so good with me too.  She supports me in everything that I say and helps me come up with different solutions to the problem.  After talking to her for 40 minutes yesterday, I felt somewhat healed.  God I miss her so much.  This break-up situation wouldnt be nearly as difficult if I had her still living in NYC with me. Paul has Saturday night off from work.  I am going to call him tonight and ask him to have dinner with me.  It will be then that I have the conversation with him about our relationship.  Worst case scenario, I throw my drink in his face and storm out.  (oh how part of me would LOVE to have that happen)  And now for my dear friend Wahini:   Peanut Butter Goodness   There was a day when I grew up  And left my peanut friend behind. He waved goodbye with solemn tears Chewing on a melon rind.  Why dont you love me any more? I heard Peanut say. Cuz you make my belly fat and gross, My ass and teeth decay.  But I taste good with chocolate kisses, Peanut begged me Please. Begging is unsightly jerkoff. I have to take a pee.  There is no reason for you to yell You hurt my feelings bad You fucking talking peanut man My goals to make you sad.  With that last word, my peanut friend Turned his back and left. He walked real slow and bowed his head I left him sad, bereft.  You see peanut man and his butter wife Had stole my lively hood. I once was pretty, thin, and cute Like most true gay boys should.  But after years of spreading them All over my sand-whiches Peanut man and butter wife Became my nemesisses.  Today I stay away from peanuts Salted or cashewed. Cuz saturated fat aint nice In fact its rather rude.  ------written and copyrighted by Joe Cut the Shit.   Have a great night yall!

      Sew   Kelly and I have bugs in our apartment.  Lots of them.  Big ones.  Gross ones.  Ugly, scary, horrifying ones.  According to everyone we have talked to, they are water bugs.  They are MUCH bigger than cockroaches and they look more evil.  When I got home on Saturday night from my vacation, I was lucky enough to have one jump on my leg.  It was about the most disgusting and terrifying thing to happen to me since I have lived in NYC.  Kelly found a bug in her bedroom on Sunday night and since then she has not slept at the apartment.    Our exterminator came yesterday to seal off every hole and crack in our walls and near our pipes.  Today they are supposed to come again and spray the fuck out of the place.  Please God let these bugs either die or crawl back to the hell they came from.  It is SO nasty to live in a space that is infested with creepy crawlers.  From what Ian (the guy Im in the show with) has said, these water bugs live in the walls of the buildings.  They feast on cockroaches (which is a good thing) and very rarely come out of the walls.  He said that if you step on a water bug right after they have eaten, a full cockroach will pop out of their mouth.  Fucking yikes.  If I ever have to experience that shit, I will vomit on myself and let it dry.  Just to take my mind off the situation.  Kelly just called me and told me that the exterminator has come and taken care of business.  Phucking phew.  My mom got me some new CDs!  I am now the proud owner of TLCS final CD 3D, among others.  When I played the album this morning for the first time, I almost started to cry as I walked to the subway.  I hate the fact that Lisa Lopez is dead.  I hate it.  Almost as much as I hate that Nell Carter is dead.  You understand.   The Truth About Dicks and Balls    (Loosely based on  The Truth About Cats & Dogs )  My dick is hard From all the jerks. My balls are tight Its filled with spurts.  Dicks are nice Hard and firm When tugged on lightly It makes me squirm.  Finger the hole And get a slap Why would you do that? Do you like crap?  My cum is salty It tastes like cream You just need cookies A dessert and dream.  This poem is Lame Yet caused me to smile Not talking about Paul At least for awhile.  Off to rehearsal!    Thank GOD I have acting back in my life.  Just when I needed it the most.

      Another day  I have been so productive at work, its almost scaring me.  I usually like to get in as much play time as possible, but lately, I havent had a free second to do anything.  My journal reading has decreased to a bare minimum and my e-mail responses have stopped altogether.  This is one of the busiest times of the year for me.  The students return in 3 weeks and everything must be completed and ready by then.  Really, the only relaxing thing I do during the day is write in my journal.  Well, lunch is pretty relaxing too.  Unless Im fighting my pizza urges.  Then things can get quite hairy.  Orcheesy.  Depends on how you like your pizza.  I prefer black and curly.  I got a letter from my brother today.  It was kind of smarmy.  I had sent him some of my journal for leisure reading and he writes, I dont know how you can divulge so much personal information on the internet.  I find it funny because I know you.  I guess these strangers find you funny too, although Im not sure why.  Do they get off on stories of burning assholes?  Ok, prick, I know you are in a war and all, but back off.  EVERYONE that  I  know loves stories of burning assholes.  Maybe military men are too  serious  for my sense of humor.  Snore.  I wrote him back as soon as I got to work and told him that if he would rather sit and read ARMY paraphernalia all day, thats fine with me.  I will save my journal for people who dont have sticks shoved up their asses.  Or burning cigarettes for that matter.  Ive thought long and hard about what to do about my situation with Paul.  Ive come to this conclusion: I have no idea what to do or when to do what I should do, but I cant do it now.  Nice having closure, huh?  Ive gone from anger to sadness and every time I hear his voice on the phone, I feel as though I am holding back the biggest secret of my life.  He knows that I am not happy in the relationship and I have mentioned breaking up a couple of times, but I dont think he realizes how serious I am this time.  Maybe because I have already broken up with him twice before and took him back after a month of begging and pleading.    Paul is very much in love with me.  I know this.  ErI think I know this.  He doesnt want to make love to me, but at this point, I dont want him to touch me either.  We have a great friendship going, but the minute I tell him that I think we should break up, our friendship of a relationship will fall apart.  I know it.  He wont be able to be my friend and in some ways, I dont know if I will be able to be his either.  Ive never been able to be friends with my exs.  It seems virtually impossible.  With so much residual anger, I dont see how either one of us could tolerate the other person.  They say that it takes half the time youve been with someone to get over them.  Paul and I have been together for 3 years and 8 months.  Does that mean that I have to wait until 2005 before I can fully put this to rest?  The idea of it makes me vomitous.  I have said repeatedly in the past that I am not scared to be single, that I am not afraid to be alone.  I have wonderful friends and a full support system through them.  But as the reality of all of this starts to clear up in my head, I am starting to recognize how scared I truly am.  Its not like Paul and I are a team, the way that most couples are  Its not like I only have Paul in NYC to be around and to hang out with  Its not like Paul does much besides tear me down But there is something to be said for being in a relationship.  No one in my life knows me the way that Paul does.  Sure my friends know more details about my life than he does, but only he  knows my behavior.  Only Paul knows me when my guard is completely down.  And he takes advantage of that.  But at the same time, I trust that whatever comes out of my mouth with Paul will be taken with a grain of salt.  I could never destroy him with my words.  I am allowed to be myself without regard for anyone else.  I can be selfish.   I will miss this aspect the most.  Boyfriends/girlfriends/husbands/wivesyour partner knows a side of you that only love can bring.  I dont want to lose this familiarity.  I dont want to lose this luxury.    Yet, its quite a toss up.  Whats more important?  This one simple luxury or a world free of antagonism, anger, and frustration?    It will be a while before I can confront this conversation with the people in my personal life.  I find myself lying to those around me, telling them that everything is fine.  I want to deal with this alone right now.  I dont want to talk about it.  I dont want advice and I dont want any pressure from anyone.  Not that I have gotten any of that, but I cant figure out how to talk to my friends about this, without having them tell me what I already know.   Do whats right for you.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.    But if I break up with Paul this time, there is no going back.  We will be done forever and I will have lost someone that I have dedicated 3 years of my life to.  The answer is simple, the execution is impossible.    Selfishly, I just need more time.

      WELL!  I am home.  Safe and sound.  And with a pretty great tan, if I do say so myself.  I worked hard at it.  Spent every day on the beach.  Ate lots of food and even gambled a bit.  I won $150 one evening at the casino and that was quite a highlight for me since I am usually living a life based on poverty.  Overall, it was a VERY relaxing week and I feel truly rested and rejuvenated.    I should be able to sit here and type for hours about all of the adventures I had and all of the crazy shit that happened to Paul and me while we were living it up.  Unfortunately, that isnt the case.  As the plane landed in the Bahamas, Paul decided that he is no longer a drinker.  Funny, since he blacked out from too much vodka on the Thursday before we left.  Paul also decided that he is no longer a pot smoker, cept that he smoked every bit of the pot that I bought while there.  Paul also decided that he doesnt smoke cigarettes, cept that he smoked every pack I brought down with me.  Gosh.    While the trip was totally relaxing and while Paul and I didnt fight barely at all while in the Bahamas, the trip wasnt that much fun.  I was in bed by 11pm every night.  Paul didnt want to do ANYTHING.  He wanted to go to the beach, make dinner at home, and watch TV.  And thats what we did.  I catered to his every whim while we were there.  I didnt want us to spend the week arguing, so I sucked it up and did whatever he wanted to do.  However, now that I am home, I hate him for it.  I hate him especially since he has spent the two nights since we have been home, drinking.  Yet when I drank a few beers each night of the vacation, I got an ear full of reprimands.  Hypocrite fuck.    Paul and I barely even kissed on the mouth while we were there.  Romance was not even a factor.  It was like two boyswaittwo BORING boys hanging out in the Caribbean, catching up on episodes of  Will and Grace  and  Friends .  I know I said that I would do whatever I wanted to do on the trip, despite what Paul had to say, but when it came down to it, I just couldnt.  The native people were pretty aggressive and did everything in their power to rob us of all of our money.  They were mean and nasty.  Freeport (the island of Grand Bahama) is a third world country and the people are direct products of their environment.  It was scary to go out and tool the island by yourself and even more importantly, I dont understand why Paul couldnt take the step down and do what I wanted to do.  At least to get out of the room more than we did.   You ask him if we had a great time on the trip and he will surely say yes.  Basically because he did everything he wanted to do.  Go to the beach, make dinner in our suite, and be in bed watching TV by 7pm every night.    God, I so dont want to talk about it anymore.  Ive barely told anyone about the trip.  I think Im not ready to confront it yet.  Still stings a little.  Dont get me wrongI didnt have a terrible time at all.  It just wasnt the kind of trip that I get off on.   It was very  relaxing .  What else can I say?  Paul just came and had lunch with me at work.  It made me sad.  Knowing that we are cruising for a heart breaking break-up.  Its inevitable.  Im sure of it now.  And I just cant talk about it at the moment.  Got a week of rehearsals and work ahead of me.  I was in a great mood before Paul came for lunch.  Now, I feel like I could burst into tears.  I dont want to hurt him.  I dont want ME to hurt either.    But how long can I keep this relationship going?  Is it really time for us to call it quits?  Im confused about love and Im confused about relationships.  After this one, I feel like I never want one ever again.  Ive been living on the theory that I just need to take everything day by day.  But does an answer ever come that way?  Am I just putting off something I need to take care of?  Should I let it continue to see how it turns out?   God, my head is swimming with confusion.  Work is over now.    I should go home.

      Well!  The show opens in 4 days!  I could puke all over myself.  I am that nervous.  I woke up yesterday and turned to Paul and said I dont think I can do this show anymore.  It was a bad idea and Im not ready and I have to back out of it and I am not an actor and ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!  I started to shake and freak out.  Paul was amazing.  He immediately calmed me down and held me for a couple of minutes.  I leaned into him and allowed him to take away the stress.  Thank God for his comfort and assurance.    We were able to work everything out between us on Saturday night and I am very happy with the outcome.  We both listened to each other and he took some of the blame for the fight that we had.  It was very comforting to know that we have gotten so far into our relationship that we can listen to one another and understand where the other person is coming from.  Its taken 3 and a half years to get to this point, yet it has been well worth the wait.  I have three more rehearsals until the big opening night.  I couldnt be more excited or more scared about it.  I am in a horrible mood today and hope that I can get out of it before I go there tonight.  To be honest, I really hate my job and its been wearing down on me for the last couple of weeks.  There is nothing I want more than to ditch these shitheads here and move on in my life.  I have had just about enough of their smart mouths and lazy fucking attitudes.  Being the administrative whipping boy has taken its toll on me.  I fucking hate my job.  FUCKING hate it.  Fuck fuck fuck wish I could find a way to get out of here fuck.  My friend Angies grandmother passed away this morning.  The funeral is on Wednesday.  I feel terrible for her, but we all knew this was coming.  She has been incredibly strong throughout this whole process and I am very proud of the way that she has handled herself.  Instead of shoving all of these emotions out of her mind, she has dealt with it head on.  Im not sure if I would have done it that way if our situations were reversed.  I hope she realizes that she has Kelly and I to lean on, should she need to take us up on that offer.  Alright, thats it for today.  Time to go get out of my shitty mood.  Seriously, I feel like I could kill someone today.    Grrrrr.I fucking hate Mondays.

      I just bought my costume for the show!  AY YI YI!  It cost me $50 and that pisses me off, since I will never be wearing these clothes ever again, but it was something that I had to do.  Theater careers are so expensive!  I think it looks pretty good though.  Its just a couple of t-shirts and some REALLY lame jewelry.  The one good thing, though, is that one of the t-shirts for the show is going to surprise my housemates from college.  The picture on the front is an inside joke with me and my girls.  YAHOOOOO!  So Paul called KELLY yesterday.  Not me.    He called her to let her know that he is coming by my apartment on Saturday night to talk about our relationship.  When Kelly told me the news, I was immediately pissed off.  He calls HER?  I have called him twice this week and he hasnt returned any of those calls, but he feels that its appropriate to call her and tell her that he is coming over.  Thats fucking lame and Im still angry about it.    Too bad for him that I already made plans on Saturday night, so it doesnt seem as though we are going to get together to talk.  I just called him again and left a message and told him that I would be willing to change my plans if he could give me a definite time of arrival at my place.  I'm still thinking about it.   If he doesn't take this seriously, he can go fuck himself and I wont deal with his nonsense until after the show.  The thing isI totally fucked up last Friday night.  I have dealt with that and have admitted it over and over.  Paul deserves an apology and I am more than willing to give it to him.  BUT, and this is a BIG BUT(T), he needs to understand that he is in a RELATIONSHIP with me and with that comes certain responsibilities.  SUCH AS calling back your boyfriend, no matter how hard it is.  I know for a fact that he still wants to work things out and be with me because he said all of that to Kelly on the phone yesterday.  However, calling my best friend to ask her if she can make arrangements on my behalf is not only offensive, its fucking immature.    Needless to say, I am very much not in the mood to talk to him right now.  I was, but Im not anymore.  I dont know whats going to happen with us.  Yes, I want to be with him, but he needs to make much more of an effort to be a normal human being.  Not a selfish baby, like he has been for the last 3 years.  Im through with kowtowing to his every need.  I am supposed to be dating a MAN, not a little child.    GAH!  He pisses me off more than anyone else in the world does.  Maybe thats love or maybe thats hate.  Im not quite sure yet.   Rehearsal last night was incredible.  I was able to reach a few new levels and I even shocked myself with some of what came out of me.  It was an invigorating and monumental rehearsal for me.  And it made me even more excited for the showif thats even possible.    Okthaz it fo today!     I got a ton of shit to do at work and I have to get my ass in gear for rehearsal tonight.  TOMORROW IS FRIDAY!    Please God let it better than last Friday.

      Since I have had a horrible couple of days, I have been unable to write about all of the shit that has happened since last Friday.    Here is the quick low down:  1) On Saturday night, I met a guy named Joe at a bar that we all went to.  He is 39 years old, kinda cute, but kinda nasty at the same time.  He had nice pecs and I was in the mood to be wanted, so after talking to him for a little while at the bar, Kelly, Angie, Mariah and I went over to his high-rise building in Hells Kitchen to have a few drinks and hang out.  He has the most unbelievable view any of us have seen in the city.  It was absolutely beautiful.  After hanging out there for awhile, the girls left and I stayed behind to get to know him a bit better.  Within minutes of the girls leaving, Joe asked if he could kiss me.  My immediate answer was No.  He proceeded to beg for the kiss for about 10 minutes and I finally was like Fine, whatever.  Big mistake.  Instead of giving me a nice, manly kiss, Joe came at me and started to lick my lips.  I was like Wha?  HORK!.  He licked them for like 30 seconds and then I pulled away.  His question was Did you like the kiss?  My answer was I have to go now.  I used the bathroom and bolted from his apartment.  But waitdont you want to exchange phone numbers?  I replied Sure, but I cant call you for at least a month.  I am in a play and dont have any time for anything else right now.  I gave him my number and took off.  He called yesterday and left a message.  I laughed and deleted it.  That will teach YOU to lick my lips in an indulgent and grotesque manner.   2) As we were walking to Joes apartment that night, something absurd happened.  Out of nowhere, I feel something slam into my back.  My first reaction was Someone through something at me cuz Im gay!  (Damn, I can be so lame)  I turned around to see what was thrown at me and what did I see?  A pigeon (!) lying on the ground next to me, totally disoriented.  I saw the girls, walking farther behind me, laughing hysterically.  Turns out, Kelly had tried to pull a feather from one of the wings of the pigeon and scared it so badly that it flew directly into the center of my back.  Um.  3) Things with Ian and I are going very well.  We are starting to settle into a real friendship now.  He talks to me about things going on in his life and vice versa.  I feel much more comfortable around him now and I can tell that he feels the same way.  He told me last night that he is going to burn the new Dave Matthews disc for me.  Well!  I mean, if youre  giving  away presentsbring em on!  I just love this kid.  I hope we continue to get to know each other after the show ends.  4) I sent out 50 headshots and resumes to talent agencies in NYC.  I have yet to receive a single phone call in response.  I am following up my letters with a reminder postcard about the show.  There isnt much more I can do beside that, except pray.  The headshots and the postage together cost me about $100.  Last night at rehearsal Ian and Sarah both announced that they have gotten interviews with commercial and film agents from the letters they sent out.  I did my absolute best to be a good sport about it, but deep down it hurts.  I put in so much effort into my letters and so far it seems as though I flushed all of that time and money down the toilet.  All I can do is count on God to guide this endeavor as well as the rest of my career.  If this performance is not meant to net me an agent, then thats fine.  I have to trust in him and not get upset if other people get a better response.  5) I got a new hamster last night!  Right after work, I went to the local pet store and picked up my new baby.  He looks exactly like Neechee, cept he is a bit bigger.  The employee at the store told me that it wasnt a good idea to put a new male into the cage with an existing male, but I told him that I wanted it any way.  When I got home, I introduced Jim to Kimberly and they hit it off immediately.  When I returned to the apartment after rehearsal, they were sitting together having tea.  It was the most adorable thing I have ever seen.  Them with their little mugs and cigarettes in their hands.  Tre cute.  Cept not so much tea and cigarettes as them eating sunflower seeds.  You understand.  6) Paul still hasnt called me since our fight.  Although my friends tell me that he misses me and loves me, I still feel a bit concerned about the whole thing.  I am going to let him take as much time as he needs.  But with the next 3 weeks of my life being an emotional and chaotic roller coaster, I could really use his support.  I suppose I did this to myself.  But I would feel much better about everything if I had the boy that I love there with me every step of the way.  7) Although I havent had any agents call to reserve a ticket for the show, my friends and family have reserved 60 tickets!  Considering that the space only holds 40 people at a time, this is a great accomplishment.  I have the most wonderful and supportive people in my life and everyone wants to come.  It makes me feel incredibly loved.  Especially since I havent done a single thing in this city since I moved here back in 2001.  So maybe its okay if no one from the industry comes for me.  It is most important that I have those I love around me.    8) I have been on the most strict diet for the last 3 weeks and guess what?  Its WORKING!  I have lost 10 pounds at this point and I am hoping for another 5 by the time the show opens.  I feel so much better in my skin and my clothes fit me better than they have in years.  What have I done to lose this weight?  Eat MUCH less and when I do eat, it has to be healthy.  Low calorie, low fat, high protein.  Who knew?  Everyone in the world, but me.  Now that the excess weight is coming off, I never want to return to the days of pizza and McDonalds as my staple food source.  Well, except for when I am drunk.  Cuz what is better that pizza and McDonalds when you are wasted?  NOTHING!  And thats it!    Thank you to everyone for the kind words yesterday.  I really needed it.  I felt so horrible about what happened with little Neechee.  But today is a new day and the sun is shining and I feel ready to continue on with everything that I have been working on.    You are all the breast.

      As if things couldnt get any fucking worse  I woke up this morning and noticed that the top to my hamster cage was left open last night.  I had fed them before I got into bed and somehow forgot to close the cage.  When I got out of bed this morning, I noticed that hamster Neechee was missing.  I immediately started to panic.  I looked all around my room and couldnt find him.  I thought maybe he got out of my bedroom and was walking around the apartment.  But if that was the case, our cat would have made some commotion to let us know that something was going on.    I looked everywhere for the little guy and I couldnt find him.  Finally I decided to get into the shower as I was already making myself incredibly late for work.  I walked over to the broken box fan that sits on my floor and turned it off.  (I have to be careful not to slice my fingers off, because the grill of the fan is busted and hanging open)  It was then that I found my little guy.  He had somehow walked into the blade of the box fan, clipped his nose on it and bled to death on my rug.  Neechee is dead now.  The second I saw him, my heart went into my throat.  He looked so little and sad anddead.  His body was perfectly intact, but his nose had dried blood on it.  After I took a moment to compose myself, I went into the living room to get Kelly.  She came in with me and saw poor little Neechee dead on the rug.  I was just standing there shocked.  Kelly immediately went and got some paper towel and I wrapped him up in a plastic bag and she disposed of him.    Then I came to work.  Once here, my boss proceeded to send me one obnoxious email after another about how my voice is too loud on the phone.  He says that I talk to my mother too loudly.  I immediately freaked out and wrote him back, basically telling him that of all the petty shit he could have slung at me this morning, this had to take the cake.  We wrote nasty emails to each other until I just stopped communicating with him altogether.  I just cant do it today.  Why the FUCK should I have to put up with this stupid stupid shit? I work too hard at my job to be criticized as though I was in fucking middle school.    I cant get the image of Neechees dead body out of my mind.  God, I hate today.  Why the hell was I so irresponsible as to leave the top off of the cage?  Mother fucker.  My friend Mariah called this morning and told me that she saw Paul yesterday.  According to her, Paul misses me and is very upset that we are not speaking right now.  Truth be told, the entire fight was my fault.  I took it to a level that was not at all appropriate and I have been feeling terrible about it ever since.  Paul shouldnt want to be with me after what I did.    Yet he does.  Want to be with me.  He told Mariah that he loves me very intensely and wants nothing more than for us to work through the issue we are dealing with right now.  He is being very level headed and fair about this.  I wish he was here right now to give me a hug.  God, I feel like I could burst into tears.

      I had one of the most random, most horrifying weekends of my life.   Without having to get too deeply into the logistics of it all, Paul and I had a huge fight on Friday that ended with us breaking up.  It was a drunken brawl and I am still unsure as of right now if the break-up was for real.  He hasnt called me since then.  And probably rightly so.  I acted like a complete lunatic and hurt him pretty badly.  I havent been feeling the same since.  Last night I had a terrible dream that kind of sums up my entire weekend.  I was in my bedroom playing with my hamsters, Kimberly and Neechee.  As I was playing around in the cage, I noticed that there were tons more hamsters resting under the shavings of their cage.  I put the lid back on the cage and as I turned around I saw that there were hundreds of hamsters milling around my bed, my dresser, my computer, etc.  There were also big hamsters that look like chinchillas.  It was absolutely terrifying and gross.    I looked back into the hamster cage and saw that it was filling up with more and more of them.  I opened up my bedroom window and started throwing them out the window.  As I tried to grab them off the floor, they bit me over and over and I specifically remember the pain I was feeling in the dream.  It was their teeth chewing on my skin.  I then grabbed a bath towel and started picking them up and breaking their necks and throwing the dead bodies out of my window.  I couldnt move nearly fast enough.  They were all over my room.    The lid on the cage started to come off as the hamsters filled it up.  As I tried to shove the lid back down, I sliced through a couple of their bodies and there was guts and blood all over the place.  I started calling for someone to come and help me, but no one did.  Eventually I just stood in my room and watched as the hamsters started to take over everything.  It was fucking scary and it was fucking nasty.    I woke up and stared at the wall for like 10 minutes, wondering why I had such a horrible dream.    Figures.  Perfect representation of my weekend.  I feel sad today.  I fucked up over the weekend with Paul and now I carry the guilt of our fight.    I have so much to do this week.    Our show opens a week from Friday and today I just dont feel excited.  Instead I feel sad and alone.  I wish I hadnt screwed up so badly with my boy.    I have rehearsal every night this week and at this point, it seems as though I will never make it through to Friday.  I also go to the dermatologist at 4pm today to see if I can get this dry skin/rash thing on my face taken care of once and for all.  I hope tomorrows a better day.

      oh YES!  It is ALMOST THE WEEKEND!!!!!!!  I couldnt be any more excited.    Back in the day when I used to go home every day after work and get drunk cuz I had nothing better to do, I felt as though I never really earned my weekends.  Now, it is the ONLY time that I have to do my errands, have some fun, suck down a vodka tonic or 11 and stay up past 2am for pure ENJOYMENT!  My boss told me today that I look really run down.  Thanks boss, but also, he couldnt be more right.  So tired, so worn out, so EXCITED to perform this PLAY!  (ok, calm down a bit Joe)  I just farted I got so excited.  My mom just called.  She is coming to the show THREE TIMES!  Not only is she coming down for both Saturday performances, she is taking a train down with some friends of hers from work to go to the Thursday night performance as well.  She is so damn cute, I feel like I could die with love.    UM!   One of the students that is a member of the organization I work for just came in and told me that she and a couple friends of hers are coming to the show too!  They just made reservations.  AY YI YI!  I feel so supported and loved.  Man, I better do a good job.  OK, change of topic, Im getting so nervous my bowels are starting to bubble up!  So last night I got home to find little hamster Neechee sitting on TOP of his rolling ball.  (I bought him this little plastic ball that he can use to run around my room.)  When hes not running through my bedroom all willy nilly, I put the ball in the cage so he can continue his exercise routine.  Well, last night I found him on top of the ball with his hands pressed against the lid of the cage.  He was totally trying to get out.  I took the lid off and he crawled right into my hand.  I then let him run around my room for a bit inside his ball of love.  Kimberly, the gender-bending hamster, decided she wanted out too and when I picked her up, she immediately crawled into the crevice of my neck and went to sleep.  It was so fucking cute that I almost started to cry.  But then I realized that crying was a bit over dramatic, so I settled for eating her out.  You understand.  About a half an hour later, and after I smoked myself a bowl of the pot, I realized that I had forgotten all about Neechee running around my room.  I went to find him and noticed that he had escaped from the ball.  Frantically I looked everywhere for that little guy and guess where I found him?  Inside one of my dirty socks!  I knelt down by the sock and when he peeked his head out, he got so scared by my gigantic head staring back at him.  I picked up the sock and put him back in his cage.  He had had enough fun for the evening.   Ok, so when I was at lunch today, I almost ran into a blind lady being guided around by her Seeing Eye dog.  I stepped around her as she breezed past me.  Suddenly, and without any warning, the dog stopped moving and took a huge crap on the sidewalk.  Right in front of the local food market.  I watched her, wondering what she would do next.  Without hesitation, she grabbed a plastic bag from inside her pocket, squatted next to where the shit was and felt around until she found the huge smelly pieces.  She picked each piece up, wrapped it together, and threw it in the trash.  My first instinct was to doubt that she was blind, considering that she performed the whole exercise with such expertise.  But no, she was truly blind and she cleaned up after her dog more efficiently than 85% of this cities dog owners.  It was a sight I wont forget for a long time.  What else, what else  Last night as I was coming home from rehearsal, I walked right by the  Making the Band 2  folks filming some sort of promotional video.  It was so cool.  I very rarely stop and gape at things that happen in Times Square.  (that is just sooooo tourist)  But when I saw Babs and Fred and Chopper chilling out, I had to stop and be as lame as possible.  I just LOVE those guys.  I am SO buying the album when it comes out.  Cept dont tell anyone, k?  I dont want anyone to think that I am turning all gangsta style.  Fucking gangsta be droppin mad hits yo.     snore.   urlLink Ari  just got into a HUGE fight with one of my co-workers and it was (by far) the best moment of my whole day.   urlLink Ari  screamed out You are a PSYCHOPATH and then proceeded to mock her until her face turned a shade of beet and she was forced to walk away and stew in her office.  It was HILARIOUS!  And also, it was EROTIC.  Cept not so much erotic.  Ah the days of working with oil and vinegar.  I will surely miss them when my theater career takes off.    Alrighty oh!  Tonight we are painting the theater space while running lines.  Someone had mentioned that we could drink beers during it and although no one has mentioned it since, I have decided that it is my personal responsibility to pick up a case and bring it over.  Cuz, if you are going to offer up the possibility of having beer at rehearsal, then you can count on me to take that offer and make sweet, sweet love to it.  HOT!  Friday, Friday around the corner I couldnt be(!) any more hornder. I will eat and drink and smoke away my life, And cut on my genitals with a super sharp knife!  What will YOU do this weekend?

      So it figures.  Now I dont like Ian anymore.    I just thought about what I was doing and decided that I needed to put an immediate halt on it.  Whats the point in sitting around and fantasizing about something that could never happen?  I was just getting wrapped up in the whole I am in a show with a cute boy syndrome.  Usually I NEVER have crushes on guys that I am in shows with.  I prefer not to date people in the entertainment business cuz they tend to be incredibly selfish, emotionally erratic, and overly dramatic.  Basically, all of the qualities that represent me.  So why would I want to date someone exactly the same?    Answer: I wouldnt.  Ian is SO not my type.  I dont know why I let it consume me yesterday.  I think its because I have a real problem with wanting guys that I cant have.  UGH!  At 26 years old, I should REALLY be over that petty shit by now.  Ah well.  Maybe at 36 it will be different.  Rehearsal was ok last night.  We were all a little off, not totally focused.  I found Ians performance to be better than it has been in the past, but I found his attitude to suck big time.  I dont know.  Its hard to explain.  He is a very aggressive, macho type of person, so its hard to read him all the time.  He is usually sweet with me and lowers his guard within the first couple of minutes of us being together.  But last night, something was off.  Our subway ride home was filled with weak conversation and to be honest, I felt like some of it was strained.  He was telling me about his girlfriend and how he doesnt know if they will end up together.  I tried to be as supportive as I possibly could, but after awhile, his attitude was bugging me so much that I had to just ditch the whole conversation.  We sat in silence for a couple stops and then I was like See ya later.  He realized that I was pulling away, so he tried to step it up a bit, but it was too late.  I turned my back and walked out the door.    Gosh, so much game playing that its making me want to puke on his face.  In any case  Tonight, Kelly and the other owners of the Theater Company are going to meet the playwrights best friend to discuss everything that is happening.  He will tell them what nights he is coming to the show as well as what night the playwrights parents are coming.  It is SO exciting for us and I know that everyone involved in this production is completely thrilled.  We are going to be performing for people that KNEW John Russell!  Wow.  Its totally unreal.    In the show, Kelly and I have to carry around notebooks that we store our poetry in.  My character is often described as a tortured poet and Kimberly is quoted at saying I have all of these feelings, I need to get them out somehow.  Its quite an ingenious concept, considering that when I was 17, I carried a notebook filled with poetry and thoughts as well.  To delve further into our characters, Kelly and I have been writing daily entries into these books.    Here are two sample poems that I have written.  Now remember that I am writing as a 17-year-old closet case that is in love with a 17-year-old straight boy (interesting parallels, eh?):   TRUTH   Truthfully I adore you. 	Your eyes  so beautiful 			So intense 				So focused. So real.  Why does this hurt so much? Deep aching from the inside out.  I shouldnt love you. But I do.    LIES   You fucker. You lied to me. Why do you hurt those that love you? Why do you make me cry? You do it on purpose.  Asshole! You see me follow you. You see me trust you. You see me want you. You see me give my heart without question. And you dont care.  Its done.  Im walking away from you. Im leaving you behind. No more tears will be wasted on you. No more nights spent sleepless. Goodbye. Forever.   Hilarious, right?  I love writing like a little kid.  Not that this journal is much different.  I just call it little kid writing so you wont judge me.  Fucking stop judging me.  Fucking judgers.  And I will leave you with that.  Its so sunny in NYC today.  Im thinking its the calm before the HURRICANE!    ISBABELLA SNORES!    I wont care about it unless it sucks the subway system up into the eye and then spits it out over Jersey.  Then I wont have to go to work!  YAHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOpth.  Peace!

      Stupid Joe.  Stupid stupid stupid.  I have been SO good with my eating habits lately.  Im talking seriously good.  I have cut fast food completely out of my diet and I have limited my portions to an amount that is suitable for the not so growing boy that I am.    That is, until last night.  Paul got to my place around 9pm.  I had already eaten dinner and was working on a bowl of Fruity Pebbles when he surprised me at my apartment.  At 11pm, he wanted to go to McDonalds to grab a burger and I thought that since I have been so good lately, that I could have some Donalds too.  Well, I ate a grilled chicken and some french fries and for the rest of the evening, I lay in bed clutching my stomach.  At 5am, I finally got out of bed to rid myself of the garbage and now at 11am, I sit at my desk burping up puke filled hatred from the depths of my stomach.  Why oh WHY did I eat McDonalds at 11pm?!?!?  Fucking stupid!  A waste of calories and even worse, my stomach is RAGING today.  I feel like shit.  There is a reason why I am typing this entry so early today.  I have to get some things off my mind.  Things about Ian.  Fine, I admit it.  I like him.  I like him a lot.  I have a HUGE crush on him.  Theres nothing I could doit just happened.  There is no doubt in my mind that I have lost the bet to Kelly and that I will be doing her laundry.  At this point, I cant even hide the fact that I am swooning heavily over this straight boy.  GRRRRR.  I had a feeling it was coming, but now there is no denying the fact that I want him for my own.    On Friday night, Ian and I went out for drinks so that we could have the chance at getting to know each other better.  We started at a sports bar and after one drink, I moved us over to a gay bar that was down the block.  I just felt more comfortable with him there, rather than competing with the rednecks playing beer pong at a nearby table.  Ian was very open to moving to a gay bar.    Ian and I talked about everything.  Our families, our past relationships, our thoughts on the show, theater in general, hopes, dreams, and desires.  He is an incredibly interesting person and he is a lot of fun to talk to.  The play flirting continued throughout the evening and I finally just had to ask him if he was ever bi-curious in his life.  I was very shocked at his answer.  And I wish that I could dive in and explain it all in here, but its not fair of me to do that to him.  Everything I was told was to stay in complete confidence.  So I will keep it that way.  But lets just say that Ian is open to the idea of having a gay relationship, with the right guy.  Ian told me that I was incredibly good looking.  He told me that I am unlike any of the other gay people he has met.  He told me that he likes hanging out with me and talking to me and that he wants us to get together this week to spend more time with each other.    Ian also told me that he has purchased an engagement ring for his girlfriend and that at some point over the next couple of years, he hopes to propose to her and begin their life together.  After hanging together for a couple of hours, Ian asked me to go to his apartment so that I could see his pad and meet his girlfriend.  I did go and was a bit overwhelmed.  His girlfriend is AMAZING.  She is pretty and sweet and a bit shy.  Ian talked about me to her as though he and I have been friends for a really long time.  He showed me numerous pictures of his family and friends and when it was time for me to go, he and his girlfriend walked me to the subway.  It was one of the most thoughtful things any new friend has every done.  Ian and I spent a great deal of the night talking about our friendship and about the little quirks that drive the other person crazy.  He says that sometimes he feels like I want to be his friend and sometimes he feels like I want nothing to do with him.  Thats a fair assessment.  When I mentioned that I was unhappy with the way our kiss went last Thursday, he said that he felt the same way and that we should practice a bit tonight before we start the rehearsal.  I was all for it.  (obviously)  We made tentative plans to go costume shopping this weekend and also to get together one night before rehearsal to work on character development and line memorization.  Both his ideas.    The reason all of this bothers me so much is two fold:  1) I really like Ian.  I like him a lot.  Definitely more than I should.  Im not like in love with him or anything, but I do have a serious crush on him.  Physically hes not really my type, but conversationally, I cant get enough.  Sometimes, when I think about him, it makes my stomach hurt.  Sometimes when I know that I wont see him again for a couple of days, it makes me frustrated and a bit sad.  Cuz I KNOW I cant just pick up the phone to call him and see how hes doing.  To do that with a straight boy would bewellgay.  I have a boyfriend and things are going well.  Im not at all in the place to be looking for other guys.  But why does it seem as though every guy I meet, I fall for.  ESPECIALLY if they are straight or committed in another relationship.  Even more especially, if theyre both.  Ian does not want to date me.  He does not want to drop his girlfriend of 3 years for me.  I dont want to do that with Paul either.  But why do I feel so intensely about this?  Why?  2) Ian has worked very hard at his relationship with his girlfriend.  He has never cheated on her, although she has cheated on him.  He is dedicated, caring, sweet, and kind to herall parts of his personality that no one else in the show has seen, beside me.  They have a wonderful rapport together and it is very clear to me that they are deeply in love.  It is not my place to make Ian question his relationship, his sexuality.  If I see a loophole in his theory, it is not right for me to capitalize on it.  This is one person that I cant have and I have to understand that.  It isnt fair for me to do anything to jeopardize any of this.    Ian and I have the potential to become really good friends.  It is totally possible that we will get through this experience and become incredibly close.  I want that.  I really do.  I want to have a straight guy friend that I can talk to and learn from.  But why do I ALWAYS fall for them?  Its because I cant have them, right?  Its because it is the ultimate challenge and I am bored unless I try to go for it.  But its not like I am doing it intentionally.  The feelings I have for him have happened against my better judgement and there seems no way for me to separate reason from logic.    Fuck.  I dont know.  All I do know is that I am really excited to spend time with him at rehearsal tonight.  I am excited to kiss him and I am excited to help him in his part for the show.  I am excited to talk to him, be around him, and for him to make me feel important.  I am majorly confused as to why this is happening to meagain.

      HOLY FUCK!  I just got the biggest and most wonderful news EVER!  Are you sitting down?  Cuz if not, please do so.  Kelly just called me at work and told me something that is BLOWING OUR MINDS!!!  Ok, here is the quick backstory:  The guy who wrote the play we are doing, John Russell, died of AIDS before the show debuted off-Broadway.  Due to the circumstances surrounding his death, the play had a very short run and closed a month or so after opening.    Now, in order to get the copyrights for this production, Kelly and Megan have been talking directly with friends of John Russell about the guidelines for doing the show.  WELL!  Kelly just received a phone call from the guy who handles the copyrights and he told her that not only is HE coming to see the show, so are the PARENTS of John Russell!  And not only are THEY coming to see the show, but their BUSINESS INVESTOR is coming as well and if they like what they see, they are going to talk to us about INVESTING IN THE PRODUCTION!!!    UMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!  This is HUGE news.   HUGE.  I mean, of course, it could mean nothing.  It could just be a really big compliment to us by having actual friends and family of John Russell be at one of the performances.  OR it could go as big as Broadway.  Really, the possibilities are endless.  Its dependent on a number of things, but I cant BELIEVE that we are going to have the honor of having these IMPORTANT and INFLUENTIAL people in our audience!  FUCKING YAY!!!!!!!!!!  This is especially good news since last night we rehearsed the ending of the show for the first time and let me tell youit is GOOOOOOOOD.  By the last scene, Kelly and I were both sobbing on stage and it was incredibly powerful.  And it was only our FIRST time through the scene.  We all left rehearsal a bit overwhelmed and absolutely stoked about the progress we are making.    Holy shit my head is spinning off its axis right now.    God is so good.  He gave me this show to do and all of the wonderful experiences that have come out of it.  And now hes giving us the chance to take this show to the next level.  I have never been so excited for anything in my entire life.    Could this be the start of my career?!!?!?!?!?!  Ian and I are off to drinks tonight.  We kissed onstage for the first time last night and it was incredible.  He handled it with style and grace and we grew even closer as friends.  We also discussed the possibility of putting up a show together after this one is done.    Ok, I have to go.  I have to call my parents immediately!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Everyone have a wonderful weekend.    Mine is already starting out in the most life changing way.    THANK YOU GOD!!!!

      In reverence to all of those innocent lives lost on September 11th, 2001, this journal will have no post today.   Instead, please take a minute out of your day to pray for the souls of both the victims and the perpetrators of this horrifying act of terrorism.    Aside from that, do what you need to do to get yourself through the day.  And  No matter how angry you may still be, please remember that God judges each human beings heart.  Not us.  I thank Jesus that no one close to me was hurt or killed as a result of this tragedy.  Peace.

      Last nights rehearsal was groundbreaking for me.    I have a monologue in the show that requires me to invest a lot of emotion into it.  Until last night, I wasnt able to bring myself to the point that I needed to be at.  Ive been working on it for quite a while and have hit a few obstacles.  Last night, by the end of the monologue, I was able to bring myself to tears.  I cried!!  Its exactly where I need to be for the monologue.  It felt so exhilarating and good!  Crying on stage is just about the hardest thing for any actor to do.  It requires full investment in the subject material and confidence in yourself in order to allow true tears to come forth.  When rehearsal was over, I felt emotionally spent, but I also felt like an actor that could conquer the world.  Having not performed in over 3 years has given me quite a few doubts within myself.  But last night changed all that.  I am the actor that I used to be.   On the flip side, Ian and I are getting closer as friends, but the relationship is taking a turn for the irritating.  We have this thing where we bust each others balls from the beginning of rehearsal until the end.  As each rehearsal comes and goes, the ball busting gets more and more intense.  I guess this is what straight guys and gay guys do to each other when they are trying to form a friendship.  I dont know.  I havent had a straight guy friend in a while.    Also, Ian wont keep his hands off of me.  Last night we took rehearsal pictures for the website (btw, they came out great!) and I was wearing a pair of suspenders.  (My character is a loserI wasnt wearing them because I thought they were fashionably acceptableplease)  Ian kept running his hands up and down them and snapping them on my back and blah blah blah.  It was flirting in its purest form.  Then, while the cast was sitting and discussing the show, Ian puts his hand on my knee and starts massaging my leg.  I acted as though I wasnt paying attention, assessing how long he was going to continue the rub down.  He rubbed for a good 20 seconds and then I looked at him and he smiled.  My response was Take your hand off my leg or I am going to take this to a level that you wont be comfortable with.  His response was Try me.  Yeahok Ian.  Kelly and I discussed this for a bit on the commute home and we both agreed that Ian just doesnt know how to  be  around gay guys.  At least not gay guys like me.  Ian has numerous gay acquaintances, but he, according to him, has none that are like me.  Meaning, that he has none that are as easily accessible as I am.   Meaning  that I am pretty straight acting, good looking, and cool.  Hows THAT for a mid-entry ego boost?  I do think Ian wonders what it would be like to kiss me.  I do think Ian wonders what it would be like to use his friendship with me as an opportunity to explore some of the thoughts and feelings that he has dealt with in the past.  However, he is 24 years old and in a relationship with a girl for over 3 years.  Hes not gay.  But he is curious.  And why wouldnt he be?  I represent the straight mans outlet for sexual exploration.  I dont say this in a cocky way at all.  I say this in a I have been in this situation with straight men dozens of times before way.  Ian doesnt realize that I know every move hes going to make before he does.  This shit has happened to me with so many guys before, that basically  I  could predict his next move.    At one point, Ian called me a bitch.  Now, as  urlLink Ari  knows and as most of my friends know, I do not accept that word as a description of myself.  Sure, I can be a bitch.  What human being cant?  But for a straight man to call me a bitch is totally emasculating and it is something that I refuse to tolerate.  I didnt ream him for it, but I made my point clear.  Dont call me that word.  You wont like the bitch that I can really be.  He laughed it off and called me it again 20 minutes later.  Friday night we are going out for drinks and all of these issues will be addressed.  While its fun for me to have a friend crush on Ian, it is nothing that I take too seriously.  Ideally, Id love to walk away from this experience with a straight guy friend.  A guy that I can hang with, bullshit with, explore different aspects of my personality with.  But this is all to be determined by the way we treat each other over the next couple of weeks.  We shall see  NOW!  In related newsRita, you are never going to believe this  The last time I performed in  Stupid Kids , my friend Mark played the part that Ian is currently playing.  I had a HUGE crush on Mark during the show and although Mark is straight, Mark is one of the guys that I coincidentally turned gay for a little while.  Mark and I have spent nights in each others bed, we have kissed each other, we cried together, we became very close.  After I graduated, we continued to keep in touch, but the relationship was strained because he is straight and I am gay and we crossed the line.  (see what I am saying about having been through this situation before?  And Mark is just the tip of the iceberg)    I emailed him to let him know that I was in  Stupid Kids  and he just wrote me back and told me that he is going to come!  I have only seen Mark once since I graduated from college, so this is a pretty big deal to me.  Having him in the audience is a thrill for me and will give us a chance to get to know each other again.  I will always have a soft spot in my heart for Mark.  He is one of the most immature and beautiful men I have ever had the pleasure of knowing.  He just joined up with the grad. school program at the university that employs me.  I have a feeling that Mark and I have a lot more history to make together before we move on to different parts of our lives.  Look at me with all of my boys splayed out.    If Ive said it once, Ive said it a quadrillion times, I am boy crazy.  I will be 85, and done with 2 wonderful marriages and will STILL be talking about how I made this guy gay, this guy cry, and this guy want to kill me.    Its just the way that it goes in the life of Joe CuttheShit.

      YO YO YO!  YoYo Ma.  I have just finished going through our Clothing Pantry at work in order to find a costume for the show.  My character is a huge loser, so I figured that a clothing pantry would be the best place to try to find my character something to wear.  I have chosen a pair of green pants that fit pretty well, but are totally out of style.  They remind me of an Old Navy-esque khaki from like 1996.  Perfect.  The shirts I picked are both button downs and of a sickly color.  AND, the find of the daya set of  3 Stooges  suspenders.  Now, hows THAT for loser?  Im not sure that this will be my final costume, but its a good start.  We are taking some rehearsal pictures tonight to put up on the Theater Companys brand new website!  Its all pretty exciting.  We are in the process of sending out reminder postcards to everyone that received a mailing about the show and let me tell you.the postcards are AWESOME!  I am SO excited.  From what I hear, the website is going to be PRETTY bomb.  Working with this company was such a good idea.  Dont forget that we are still taking donations for the show.  Just in case you wanted to throw a couple bones our way.  I am so blessed to have had my friends in NYC throw me some cash, as well as a couple friends of mine from school.  One friend, in particular, sent me $25 and I was shocked!  Of all of my girls from school, this girl and I arent the bestest of friends, but she totally supported me in my theater endeavor and proved to me that she really does care about what Im doing in NYC.  I was overwhelmed by her generosity.    I sent out an email yesterday telling everyone to make reservations for the show and you would not BELIEVE the response I got.  The theater space that we are using only holds about 40-50 people at a time.  At this point, I have already reserved 30 tickets just for people that I know.  And more are on their way!  I love that the space holds such  few people because it makes the performance so intimate, and allows the audience to really be a part of the production.  The only downfall is that once all of the tickets are reserved for a certain night, we have to turn people away or offer them standing room only.  Im a bit nervous that some of my friends who let things go to the last minute will not be able to go, or at least not on the night that they would prefer.    Gah! I worry about too much.  God will take care of it all.  I just have to let it happen.  Had another horrifying dream last night.  In the dream I was in the house I grew up in.  It was nighttime and my parents, brother, and I were watching a movie.  We see a flickering light outside and I go over to the window to see whats going on.  About a block away, I see a friend of mines house totally engulfed in flames.  I can hear people screaming from inside.  I call out to my parents and brother who run over to the window and we all stand there watching the house burn down.  There seems to be no one else on the street.  All I can hear is the crackling of flames and people screaming to be helped.    I lean against the window and realize that its hot.  My parents grab me by my shoulders and pull me back into the depths of the living room.  Without warning, the windows blow in and flames shoot all over the couch, walls, carpet, etc.  My brother and parents open a door and run into our basement.  (A basement that we didnt have while living there.  I dont know WHY I created that in my dream) When I went to join them in the basement, the stairs collapsed and fire spread all over the entrance.  I called out to my parents, but there was no sound.  They were gone.    I ran through the house trying to find an exit, but couldnt.  My heart was pounding in my chest as I started to realize that I wasnt going to make it out of the house alive.  I found my bedroom door ajar and ran into the room and barricaded it.  I sat down on the bed, knowing that I was trapped, knowing that I was going to die.  After a few moments, the bedroom door burst open and flames went everywhere.  I backed up against the wall and it was then that I woke up.  I woke up from the dream around 6am this morning and was unable to fall back to sleep.  All I could hear in my head was the screaming from my next door neighbors begging to be helped.  And I couldnt get the image of my parents disappearing into the basement out of my head.  The clock ticked by until the alarm clock eventually went off and I got out of bed.  It was horrible.  I dont know why I keep having these bad dreams.  Some people say that nightmares are a sign that things in your personal life are in upheaval.  That is true for me.  Everything is so hectic, crazy, and unstable for me right now that it makes perfect sense that my subconscious would be going nuts.  It would just be nice to wake up one morning and NOT feel like I am going to burst into tears.  Ah well  I am so excited for rehearsal tonight.  Not only are we having people take pictures, we are going to have a mini-audience.  YAYAYAYAYAYAYAY!    Everything is starting to come to a head and I couldnt be more thrilled.

      Happy Monday!  Sick.  Never.  But I did have an incredible weekend!  I was so busy that I never had a chance to sit around.  I love weekends like that.  I felt so productive and important.  It was such a wonderful change of pace.  And I came out of it a father.  But I will explain that in a minute.  Friday night I had drinks with my two loves, Angie and Kelly.  We had planned to go out with some friends of ours, but ended up having such a good time the three of us that we opted out of it and partied in my apartment.  After hours of drinking and singing and playing games, the three of us went out to a nice restaurant and spent the money we WOULD have saved on dinner.  It was terribly fun.  After we were finished eating, Kelly and I walked home and ran right into the star of  urlLink Take Me Out .  (Kelly had taken me to see this Broadway play in July and we were thrilled to see the lead guy!)  Saturday was the day to end all days.  I got up at 8:30am to talk to my brother.  We spoke for about a half an hour and then I showered and went down to the rehearsal space to knock down one of the walls.  Yes.  You read that correctly.  Little gay Joe put on some work gloves and joined Ian in ripping down the kitchen area that was taking up too much room in our space.  It was so manly and fun and I had plaster in my hair until this morning.  I think everyone was a bit surprised at hot strong and aggressive I can be once given the chance.  It was hot.  At around 1:30pm, the owner of the space came in to check on our progress and freaked out at the fact that we were sawing one of his countertops in half.  (Needless to say, we had gotten prior permission)  This joke of a man (weighing easily 2,359 pounds) screamed at all of us until I basically told him to go fuck himself.  He stormed out and came back 20 minutes later to continue the verbal berating.  I went out to have a cigarette to calm myself down.  (I cant STAND people belittling my friends, especially when it was clearly not justified)  When I came back into the building, fat fuck was still yelling at everyone.  I joined the rest of the group in trying to explain to him that he was acting like a psycho.  Suddenly Ian, who remained quiet during most of it, BLEW UP!  He started screaming at the owner, in the same way that the owner was screaming at the girls.    It got way out of hand.    Before we knew it, Ian and the owner were standing in the hallway, screaming at the top of their lungs, spit flying all over the place.  Their chests were puffed out against each other and then Ian screams: Go ahead!  Hit me fucker.  Hit me once and Ill knock you on your ass!  (told you Ian was MAN!)  I immediately ran over, put my arms around Ian and took him outside.  (Side note---I thought Ian might shove me aside, but instead he wrapped his arm around my shoulder and let me take him with me---it was very sweet and wonderful)  Once outside, Ian and I talked about what happened and I was able to calm him down.  Inside, the owner was freaking out, but the girls eventually calmed him down as well.  Luckily it all worked out and everyone left on decent terms.  It was fucking crazy and the closest I have ever come to getting into a fight.  Although, clearly I was not in the fight.  You understand.  After all this shit went down, we all went for some food and beverages at Applebees.  Ian and I both ordered a mug of beer, which turned out to be a pitcher each.  He and I sat next to each other and play flirted the whole time, while the 5 of us talked about the days adventures.  Ian and I moved our date to this upcoming Friday.  Man, I just love hanging out with this kid.  Instead of going home, Kelly and I went over to see our friend Mariah who is going through a life crisis.  She asked me not to write about whats going on with her in this journal, so I wont.  But basically, things in her life have gotten severely out of control.  Kelly and I hung with her for a couple of hours, until we were sure that she was going to be ok.  After that, we headed home.  When we got to the front of our building, we noticed that somebody had abandoned an adorable hamster on the sidewalk.  It had all of the food and bedding with it, so we thought that maybe somebody was moving out and that they were going to pick him up soon.  We spoke to our landlord about it and he said that the hamster had been sitting there for most of the day.  We immediately picked up the cage and brought him inside.    Once we got up to our apartment, Kelly and I ran around trying to get everything set up for him.  Out of nowhere, Kelly starts screaming for me to join her in my bedroom.  When I arrived there I immediately saw why she was screaming.  Instead of one hamster, there were two!!!  We BURST out laughing and named them Kimberly and Neechee (Our character names in our show).  We cleaned the cage and set them up in a lap of luxury.    And let me tell you, these little boogers are so friendly and CUTE!  I have no idea why somebody would have dropped them off on the curb.  They love to eat out of your hand and when I woke up this morning and turned on my light, they woke up too and stood with their legs pressed against the side of their cage.  They were saying Good morning!  I rewarded them with some hand fed sunflower seeds.    We think Kimberly is pregnant.  She doesnt run around as much as Neechee does.  And Neechee caters to her every whim.  Kimberly always sleeps in this little tin can that came with the cage and last night, when she got out to get something to eat, Neechee ran inside the can and tried to go to sleep.  Kimberly walked around for a little bit and then crammed herself into the can with Neechee.  I watched closely as Kimberly shoved Neechee out of the can and took it back as her own.  It was hysterical!  And reminded me a lot of guy-girl relationships.  Or guy-guy relationships, considering the fact that I am SO Kimberly in mine.    I still havent decided what to do if Kimberly gives birth.  I will probably just let the babies stay in the cage so that Neechee can eat them alive.  I dont know what else to do.  I cant have 35 hamsters living in my bedroom.  Plus, babies are probably a really good source of protein.  Neechee will grow up to be big and strong.  I just love them.  I feel like Kelly and I rescued them from dying and now I want them to be my babies forever.  I went to K-mart yesterday and bought one of those little hamster ball things so that they can run around my bedroom whenever they want.  They just love it.    So yeah, what a great weekend it was!  I am a proud father of two beautiful hamsters, I got to spend quality time with Ian and Paul, had a great time with Angie and Kelly, and even got to sleep in late on Sunday.  Ahh, the life.    Now, back to a weeks worth of intense rehearsals.  But Im excited about it.    Everything is going so well and I am truly happy.

      Administrative Assistants shouldnt work nearly as hard as I do.   Nuff said.  So, yesterday was the most chaotic day of my life. Among other things, I was once again reminded that not only is this journal popular, its way too public. A good friend of mine was hurt by something I wrote in these pages after she stumbled across the site. Then I was asked to remove certain items from my journal that was destroying someones very guarded privacy. I didnt want to remove this stuff, but since I care so deeply about the people in my life, I thought it only fair to do what was asked of me. Could this journal BE any more censored?   Its sad, to say the least, and I feel terrible about what happened. Reason #1 why I dont give out this journals web address to my friends. There is always the chance that someone will read something and not understand the way in which it was intended. This is MY journal. No one elses and I hate having to make excuses for it. But I guess thats the problem you run into when you post thoughts and information in a public domain. Fuck it. Its over. I dont want to think about it anymore.  Rehearsal last night was INTERESTING.  I have been writing lately about how Ian, the guy in the show with me, is becoming my new straight man crush. Well, let me explain a bit better.   I dont go for straight guys unless I have just cause. In fact, I am so over the whole straight boy thing at this point that I find it a waste of my time to flirt and play around with this type of ridiculous activity. Thats why this thing with Ian is throwing me for a loop. Its been a long time since I have had a straight guy flirt with me for no apparent reason.  For examplehere are some statements that came out of Ians mouth in the last 48 hours that have lead me to believe that he has some sort of special connection with me. (Aside from the fact that we are actors together in the same production)  To the director and Stage Manger, he said: "Sure, I will come and help out on Saturday. Make sure to bring gloves, hammers, beer, and.Joe."  To the director he said: "We need to figure out a way to get down the stairs before the next scene. Why doesnt Joe give me a piggy back down (them)?" I responded with "Ian, YOU should be the one that gives ME the piggy back. Youre the man in this relationship." He responded by winking at me.   To me he said: "I was thinking about you last night and was going to call. But then I thought that you would think that was fucking weird." I responded with "Yeah, that is fucking weird."  On top of these little blurbs that come out of his mouth, he is consistently paying more attention to me than he is anyone else. He is constantly wrestling around with me and punching me and staring at me and  Without sounding like a total egocentric idiot, he is acting the way that all of the other straight guys I bedded have acted. I am still a firm believer that Ian is straight and I have worked very hard at not giving him any reason to believe that I have a friendly little crush on him. I find him to be so adorable and fun. Thats all. But I do like the fact that he shows me this extra attention. Its just so reminiscent of the days of college. The days when I would make straight guy friends discern if they could be even  partially  gay and then have them kiss me and hold me in my bed. I just have this  way . Ask any of my friends.  So, I am pretty excited to spend Sunday afternoon with him, drinking beers and getting to know each other outside of rehearsal. Dont get me wrong, Im not looking for a new BOYFRIEND or even a HOOK-UP. I am very happy with Paul and how things are going between us. Its just FUN to have this type of thing going on. Ians an awesome guy and I hope to be proud to call him my friend. Friend that wants to hold me in my bed.   Sike.  So thats it.   I gotta go home now. Its already 2:15pm and I am STILL at work. But I didnt want to leave without telling everyone to have an EXCELLENT weekend!   So..have an EXCELLENT weekend!

      When I was in the Poconos this weekend I had the most horrifying dream about my brother.    In the dream, all of my friends and family and random people from my life were staying at a condo together.  (not much unlike the condo I was at while away this weekend)  My brother was home from the war, but he still had on his fatigues and other ARMY getup.  We were all having an excellent time together when my brother announced that he was going to step outside for a minute.  He left the condo and I went to the window to watch him walk down the stoop.  He turns and puts his head against the wall and out of nowhere, this Iraqi looking person runs up behind him, puts a gun to the back of his head and blows it right off.  Right in front of me.   I burst into hysterics, but after that everything gets a bit fuzzy.  Everyone surrounds me and comforts me and I cry and cry and cry.  Moments later everyone goes on with their weekend as though nothing has happened.  Every time I think about my brother, I begin to cry again.  I can still remember the heartache I felt in my chest.  My friends gathered around me and told me that I just needed to get over it and to move on.  When I kept sobbing, they got a little more forceful about it and said Its over.  Hes dead.  You need to let it go.  The rest of the dream was spent with me sobbing and nobody doing anything to make it any better.    It was horrible.    When I woke up, I was still in the Poconos.  I immediately told Rita and a couple of other people about the dream and they were incredibly supportive.  But still, I have a hole in my stomach when I think about it.  Oddly enough, my brother called while I was getting my haircut today.  I hate when I miss his call.  Especially after that disgusting dream.  UghI gotta try to let it go somehow.  Thank God it is almost Friday.  My job is wearing me the fuck down.  I have NO time for play and it is driving me MADDDDDDDDDDDDDD.  Mad with 14 Ds of course.  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!  19 As.  I have been in an excellent mood all week, despite the chaos that is my life.  I think I am most happy when I am busy.  I have no time to sit around and think about what a sad sack I can be.  I work best in overdrive.  But eventually the stick will burn out and I will need a break.  But for nowI push through with a smile.    Ian, the guy in the show with me, asked me to go out for drinks with him this weekend.  I had mentioned it to him a couple of weeks ago and he loved the idea.  Last night he says Joe, do you want to go out this weekend?  Elated, I say Yeah, sure (still trying to play it cool).  He responds with It will be our little date.  Immediately I had to shut him out.  Dont be cute with me Ian, or I will immediately fall head over heels in love with you.  God, it seems like no matter how old I get, straight men will always be my lust men of choice.  They are just so inherently MANLY!  Ian also has this new thing where he pinches me and punches me and slaps me all the time.  I guess thats what straight guys do with other straight guys, but umI like it too much.  Next time he slaps me, I am going to wrestle him to the ground and kiss him on his man mouth.  You understand.  Did you hear that Justin Timberlake is the new spokesperson for McDonalds?  The commercials will air in the US starting on September 29th.  Get ready for major overload of the Timberlake.  Hes going to drive his career right into the ground with this shit.  Can anyone say over-exposure?  Britney did it to herself and now she is lovehated by everyone on the planet.  So when Justin starts with his Im lovin it (his catch phrase) nonsense, make sure not to shit directly onto your television.  Thats just a mess to clean up.  Peace out jiggaz.    TOMORROW IS FUCKING FRIDAY!  FUCK!  (fuck in a good way)

      Holy fuckin fuck!  Work has been a madhouse for the last two days!  I thought I was busy beforeOMG!  Im not kidding when I say that I broke a sweat about 15 minutes ago.  I decided that sweat was totally unnecessary and that it was time for me to start taking my job a little less seriously.  In which case, I write a quickie entry in my journal.  Unfortunately, due to the craziness of the office place I am going to be unable to do a VMA recap.  This is what I will tell you: The show basically sucked, with the exception of the over-hyped Britney/Madonna/Christina kiss.  The performance by Beyonce was decent until it exploded with energy and excitement right at the end.  That bitch can dance AND sing.  She was amazing.  Justin was too high on his britches for the entire show.  (Bitch didnt even peform!)  He acted like such a cocky asshole and I think I might be starting to lose my interest in that playboy.  He is SO getting on my nerves.  Humility, anyone?  Thats about it.  The rest of the show was chock full of the same people up for the same awards (50 Cent, Justin, Beyonce, Snore).  I was just glad that I had a bottle of wine while watching it.  Made it a bit less painful to watch.  Based on past years, this VMA show totally blew.  And you KNOW how much I love MTV.  It MUST HAVE sucked for me to have nothing to write about.  Last night I went to Pauls apartment after an INCREDIBLE rehearsal.  I saw the space that we are using for the show and within the first hour, I fell completely in love with it.  There is a TON of work that needs to be done there and I wonder how its all going to get finished in time, but I can see why Kelly and Megan would have wanted to go forward with it.  Its pretty busted, but the playing space is PERFECT!  And SO much fun to do the show in.  Im pretty excited.  And honestlyI dont give a shit if people feel weird about the building.  Theyre there to see a show!  And a damn good one at that.   So, when I got to Pauls apartment, I found a HUGE basket filled with all sorts of presents for me.  The note attached explained that Paul went out and bought me food for dinner, medicine to get over my cold, and juice, candy, and gum just to make me happy.  There was so much to choose from and I was elated!  When Paul walked into the apartment after work, I tackled him to the ground and covered him in kisses.  I just LOVE him so so much.  He is really trying and we are doing so well.  I am proud of him and I am proud of our relationship.  I love being in love.  This weekend at the Poconos was awesome!  I played so many card games, including a PITCH tournament that Rita and I won!  (we each got $20!)  We also played our annual Housemate Trivia game.  Rita won that too!  We played kickball and I pulled every muscle in both of my legs.  (I am currently hobbling everywhere I walk)  We went out drinking, stayed in drinking, drank with dinner, drank for breakfast, and drank our own piss.  You know, just to savor every bit of alcohol possible.  So much partying.  No WONDER I felt like garbage on my way home Monday.  Being able to have all of us be together was wonderful.   There was so much gossip and talks and loveman.  I loved every second of it.  It was like none of us ever graduated.  So little has changed.  At least not with our personalities.  3 of the 6 girls (yes, I AM one of the girls) has gotten engaged, so there was a TON of wedding talk.  One of the ladies, Jessica, asked me to be in her wedding.  Now Im in TWO!  (Rita asked me first and of course is the most important to me)    The thing that stood out to me the most about the trip was that everyone took such good care of me.  All of the girls know that I have very little money, due to the overly expensive nature of living in NYC, and they EACH pitched in to make my time enjoyable and on par with everyone else.  I contributed $60 towards food and wine, while everyone else put in way more than that.  I only paid $50 to stay at the condo, while everyone else paid $150.  See what I mean?  At no point did I feel embarrassed or like I was slighting anyone.  My Rita took good care of me and everyone else followed suit.  I had one of the best weekends ever.  Cant you tell??  Alright, I gotta go.  Work is kicking me in the nuts every chance it gets.  Latas!

      Hi EVERYONE!  What a weekend I had!  Holy mother fuck it was amazing.  But unfortunately, I am too busy at work to get into it right now.  I will tell all stories tomorrow as well as do a mini-yet extremely important recap of the VMAs.    In order to give you something to read, I have decided to answer the interview questions selected for me by my new and wonderful friend  urlLink Lux .    Here are your 5 Questions:  1. Who would you cast in a movie about your life?  What an amazing question!   Okay, if I had the choice, I would totally cast Leonardo Dicaprio.  To me, he is one of the most genius actors in the entire world.  He is believable and truthful in all of his performances.  I could watch Leo read a Biology textbook and still find it fascinating.  He finds a way to incorporate aspects of himself into every script.  To me, that is the key to an honest performance.  He is good looking, edgy, and possesses more talent than the Olsen bitches have money.  Leo has been my favorite actor for years and I would be PROUD to have him play the part of Joe CuttheShit.     2. If you had to give up pizza or soda, which one would you choose?  Impossible to answer, but since I mustI must.  Goodbye pizza.  Goodbye.  Soda is a complete staple in my life.  To me, it is sugary, carbonated water.  And from what I know, people are supposed to be drinking gallons of water every day.  Works for me.  But I would miss pizza (EXTREMELY) for the rest of my sad existence.  In fact maybe I will get a slice today just to remind myself how lucky I am to not have to make a choice.  3. How did you discover blogs and why did you start blogging?  My dear friend Rita had a blog that was very successful and encouraged me to do so myself.  In January of 2002, when she moved into our apartment in Queens, she sat down with my housemate Kelly and I and explained to us the fun involved with keeping an online journal.  I started mine that evening and have been blogging every since.  Most times its an excellent release for me.  Sometimes its a creative way to express myself.  And some other times its a pure hassle.  But I have found that the benefits of blogging clearly outweigh the benefits of NOT blogging.  So I still plug away at mine.  At least until something else in my life replaces it.    4. Would you rather French-kiss Britney or Christina?  Britney.  I would rather HORK on Christina.    5. Where is your favorite place in New York?  My favorite place in New York would have to be my bedroom.  But if I couldnt have THAT as a choice, then I would say that it is a bar called SPLASH.  Its a gay bar and I have never seen so many muscle bound men in my life.  I very rarely get to go there, since I basically have no gay male friends.  But on those nights where I get to dress up, have a vodka tonic and go meet the men of my dreamsoh man, there is nothing like it.  Sure, most people would pick their favorite restaurant, or their favorite sight to see, or a place that makes them totally relaxedJoe CuttheShit picks the place that has the most muscle.  YEM.  THE END!  The Rules: 1. If you want to participate, leave me a comment saying "interview me." 2. I will respond by asking you five questions - each person's will be different. 3. You will update your journal with the answers to the questions. 4. You will include this explanation and an offer to interview others in the same post. 5. When others comment asking to be interviewed, you will ask them five questions.  Have a great night all!  Be back tomorrow with full details.

      After freaking out about my lack of Halloween plans yesterday, I pulled a typical Joe move and planned the entire evening minute by minute.  I made numerous phone calls and did much researching on the web to find out where we would  all  want to go and what we would  all  want to do.    Here is what I came up with:  6-8pm: Kelly and I get dressed up in our costumes while singing show tunes and drinking our pre-party drinks.  8-9pm:  Kelly and I go to Pauls apartment to pick him and Jen and Lisa up.  We will surely pause to have another drink there.  9-10pm:  The five of us go to a house party on the lower East Side in order to meet up with my friend Mariah and her entourage.    10-10:30pm:  Snore ourselves to sleep at a party filled with all straight people.  10:30pm:  Decide we have had ENOUGH and jump in a cab to the West Village.  There we will meet up with my friend Ian from work and a bunch of his other friends.    10:30pm-12am:  Hit every hot spot in the West Village looking for cheap drinks and hot boys.  Goal: get as liqoured up as possible.   12am-?: Go to the Meow Mix (a hot, yet sometimes scary lesbian bar) for dancing and yet more drinks.  Once one of us has taken a fall or thrown up all over the wall, we will pile into cabs and move out.  Kelly, Angie and I will go home (possibly with Paul, assuming he isnt the person falling down and throwing up  ehone can always hope) to eat food, smoke some bowls, and watch  The Rocky Horror Picture Show .    4am:  Can I go to bed now?   Thats it!     Now, lets see how much of this we actually get done.  I always come up with these very strict time lines and we never seem to follow it.  But tonight I am determined to do everything I have planned for us.  Its not fun being the guy who has to keep everyone to plan, but someone has to do it.  And that someone might as well be me.  Especially since I tend to be the most anal-retentive person in our group.  But hey, as I saidsomeones gotta do it.  I thought long and hard about what to do for a costume.  I usually cop out on dressing up cuz I feel so embarrassed and utterly uncreative.  But this year, I decided not to go for a FUNNY costume or a CLEVER costume.  It never works out well.  So tonightI will bedun dun DUN!an accountant.    Hahahahahaha and also zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.    But its a functioning costume and it will work out.  I am going to part my hair on the side, and slick it over.  Then I am going to wear a really cheesy tie with a shirt that doesnt match, throw on a pair of slacks and a suit coat, and fill my shirt pocket with pens and a calculator!  ROCK?    ROCK!  I am sure I will end up looking like a dork or a dweeb or snorey McSnoresalot, but in any case, I wont look like me.  And thats the whole point!  ALRIGHT!  I am outtie 5000!   HAPPY HALLOWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN!

      Do you have any idea how GOOD it feels to be on vacation for a week, only to come back to a work week that started on a Wednesday?!?!  I woke up this morning and thought Yay!  The weekend is coming already!  Its just about the breast feeling in the world.  I went to bed as soon as I got home last night.  I literally passed out the second I put my bag down on my floor.  I slept for an hour and a half without interruption.  Then I woke up, made a sandwich, and turned on  Sex and the City  for an hour.  Although I had seen both of the episodes a couple of times, I found myself sobbing to the point of embarrassment.  One of the episodes dealt with the death of Mirandas mother and my tears just flowed and flowed.  Ive said it before and I will say it againit is truly one of the best acted and well written shows ever to air on television.  It doesnt matter what walk of life you are on, the characters on  Sex and the City  enable you to identify with everything they go through.  Its a rare find in a TV program.  God bless you HBO.  And God bless you chewy Sprees.  I chomped on them for a good hour last night and loved every second.    Tomorrow is Halloween.  Usually this is my favorite holiday of the year, as there are really no expectations.  No one to buy gifts for and no one to visit.  Just a good wholesome feeling and tons of vodka tonics.  How could one NOT enjoy the day?    Well this year, we have been really struggling to put together some REAL Halloween plans.  In the past, the holiday fell on a weekday, so it was totally acceptable to go out for happy hour, grab some McDonalds burgers and go home for a viewing of the  Rocky Horror Picture Show  (a tradition that Kelly and I have been taking part in 3 years in a row).  But this year, the day falls on a Friday, so we wanted to make a bigger deal out of it.  Initially we were going to shroom.  For those of you who dont understand the drug world, this means, eat magic mushrooms.  Its been years since we did that and it looks as though it will be years before we do it again.  As the day got closer, no one really wanted to spend the evening acting like maniacs.    Paul has decided to have a Halloween blow out in his apartment.  It could be fun, but it could also be the most irritating function on the planet.  I had the luxury of going out with some of Pauls friends from work a couple weeks ago and although everyone jumped all over me when I walked into the bar, they then proceeded to give me advice about my life and tell me what to do in order to be an actor.  Listen people, I just went out for a casual drinknot for help with my fledgling acting career.  Sheesh.  So either the party will happen and everyone will be extra spooky, or the party will happen and everyone will be extra douchey.  Its really a toss up.  Afterwards, we will go out for some drinks in Gay Chelsea.  I am dying to see the different costumes.  I mean, its like a night worth of jokes that I dont even have to TRY to make.  I have already decided that if I see more than one gay boy dressed up as an angel, I am going to rip those fairy wings off andrun away as fast as I can.  Shit manI want a pair of fairy wings too.  The role I play in my group of friends is Party Organizer.  Usually its easy.  Pick a bar, call everyone up and tell them to be at my apartment at a certain time.  But since its Halloween everyone has something they want to do and no one has any ideas that everyone will agree to do.  I will probably end up staying at home and dressing up my hamsters in super cute outfits.  I mean, its not the WORST Friday night a guy could have.  Since returning from California, Paul and I have been getting along famously.  We have spent quite a bit of time together and I have never laughed so much in my life.  He has been increasingly more affectionate and kind.  I decided to reward him with a little bit of sex.  It all worked out nicely.  I spoke at great lengths with my uncles about Paul and my relationship.  As I mentioned they gave me excellent advice.  They asked me if I had ever considered couples counseling.  I almost burst out laughing when they said that (and so did my friends when I mentioned it to them), but on further analysis, I believe it to be the best idea I have heard of so far.  I mean, it makes perfect sense.    Most people my age would never consider something like couples counseling.  But I also feel like most people my age arent as committed to working through their problems within a relationship as Paul and I are.  It may be a little hokey to pursue this avenue, but I also think that if we are really serious about figuring some of our shit out, counseling may truly be the way to go.  Since returning we have been getting along great, so I havent even mentioned the idea to him yet.  Who knows.  If it gets to the point again where I have to bring it up as an option and he shoots it down, then I will.  And at that point, I dont want him to think that he isnt making some major improvements.    Home Improvements?  ERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRUH!  (that was my best Tim Allen/Home Improvement impression)  Enoughs enough.   Eight is Enough .    No more cheesy Television sitcom jokes.    I have to go figure out Halloween now.    Im starting to have a nervous break down.

      Whats UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP?  Back from my trip to the beautiful state of Cali!  Dammit what a good trip it was.  One of the best I have ever had.  My Uncles treated me so well and took complete care of me.  I mean, from the wonderful food to the 150 drinks I had, everything was top notch and laden with class.  I felt like I had stepped out of my economical strife and into a world filled with beauty.    Their house is unbelievable and comes with a fully functioning hot tub!  They have an incredible dog named Sundance.  They have a wine cellar and a fully refurbished kitchen that puts the ones one MTVs Cribs to shame.  They own Playstation 2 and the biggest television I have ever sat in front of.  Really, being at their home was one of the most incredibly fun experiences I have ever had.    They took me all over the city.  We saw Lombard street and the Golden Gate Bridge and City Hall and the Opera House.  We frequented the Castro district and quite a number of the other famous sites.  They took me to see  Beach Blanket Babylon  and out to the most luxurious dinner I have ever eaten.  We went to a gay bar and played cards for hours.  And most importantly, we talked our faces off and really got to know each other.    Saying goodbye to them was very difficult.  It was a whirlwind trip and I fell into the trap of loving SF too much.  Of every place I have ever been blessed to visit, San Francisco is, by far, the most beautiful.  I could definitely see myself settling down there.  The whole city smells like flowers and the people are so relaxed.  At no point did I feel intimidated or uncomfortable.  I love it there and am desperate to go back again next year.    My uncles treated me like a princess.  They did my laundry for me, made me fantastic dinners, and offered everything they own to me as though I live in their house with them.  They even had a gift bag with tons of fun stuff in it waiting on the bed for me when I arrived.  They are so sweet and funny and smart.  I spent a great deal of time discussing my relationship with Paul and they gave me better advice than I have gotten from most of the outlets that I have pursued.  I left California feeling refreshed and ready to tackle my life in NYC.  Yet, nothing could prepare me for the strong smell of piss that I encountered after exiting the airport.  (Some things never change)  So now I am back.    I had dinner last night with the cast of  Stupid Kids .  Everyone, except for Ian, showed up.  Meaning, see ya later Ian.  Nice knowing you.  Im actually not upset about it at all.  I tried to be his friend and he just doesnt seem to care.  It happens.  I have other friends.  Like 3.    Please.  I have at least 7.   Anyhow, I spoke with Kelly at great lengths about the next project that the Theater Company is planning.  I am very excited to continue with them over the next couple of months.  Details will surely follow.  Now, I have to plan for Halloween, look into auditioning for something in the city, and clean out the hamsters cage.  But other than that, I feel pretty good about being home and in my own bed.  I will surely miss the life of San Francisco, but I will just keep the idea of visiting there again next year very fresh in my mind.  Time to go take a huge dump.    You understand.  Peace!

      Wellity  I am off to California!    What am I?  The luckiest kid on the planet?  My uncles are flying me out to San Francisco for a week of gay FUN!  See, my uncle is gay and his husband/wife is gay too and I love them both!  I have never spent any time with them alone since I have come out of my stuffy closet, so this is my chance to show them who I am and to get some familial gay love.  I know its going to be just great!  I am a bit apprehensive about taking a plane by myself, but I think I am ready.  I mean, if God wants me to crash and burn and not continue with my acting dreamsthen sobeit.  But I am pretty sure that God has big plans for me, so I am just going to get on that flight and deal with it.  Non-baby style.  I have yet to pack.  I have yet to even THINK about this trip.  The whole time, I was like, "Wellsomeones going to Cali. this week, but surely its not me."  Imagine my surprise when I woke up this morning and was like OMG!  Its me!    So tonight I go home and pack.  I have already told all of my girls and boyfriend that I will call them as soon as I get there and well make plans for next week.  I meanam I serious?  Can I just go on vacation and not think about my normal life?    Hells never.  Halloween is coming and my trip to SF aint gone fuck up dat!  Anysnoodle(What?Microsoft Word dont recognize that as a real word?  Fuck YOU Microsoft word)  I will DEFINITELY write in my journal while I am on the West Coast.  So please, keep coming by and checking in on me.  I will know by my sitemeter tally if you care or dont care.    I will KNOW!  Sorrytoo much wine on my lunch break.  Have a GREAT week everyone!  The next time I write in here, I will be hanging out in the Castro district with my fellow gays and shooting the shit with the two coolest homos this side ofwellthis side of!  Peace out yall!

      Pretty good, but pretty snorific weekend.  I did see  Texas Chainsaw Massacre  and loved it.  Soooo gruesome and I thought that Jessica Biel was amazing.  She cried so many real tears that her performance was utterly inspiring to me.  And I must say that every time I heard that chainsaw start up, chills ran up and down my spine.  Maybe the best part of the whole experience though, was the fact that the theater was crowded with people.  Every time someone got brutally slashed, everyone screamed their heads off.  It was hilarious and made the experience that much more worth it.    I also hung out with my friend Hannah on Saturday.  She made us homemade chicken wings and we each downed a 6 pack of beer.  It was terribly fun, but by the time I got home Saturday, I was exhausted.  I decided to avoid alcohol for the rest of the weekend.  Probably a good idea.  My bowels were very grateful.  I leave on Wednesday to go to San Francisco for the week.  I couldnt be more elated.  My job sucks so hardcore that being able to get away is like the most wonderful thing on the planet.  I will not miss it in NYC for even a second.  When I was walking to the subway this morning, I thought One more time to do this before I go away on a fantastic trip to a place thats WARM!  Its so cold here in the city these days.  And I cant find my winter jacket.  Grrrr.  While in SF, my uncles are going to take me to see  urlLink BEACH BLANKET BABYLON !  It is supposed to be the most amazing show ever.  It started as a very small theater production over 30 years ago and due to popular demand, it has become a staple as a San Francisco Must see.  On Friday night my uncles are taking me out to the gay bars.  I am most excited about that I think.  I want to see what gay people look like in SF.  I picture them with really muscular bodies and handlebar mustaches.  I am going to jump on one of their Harleys and take off for a midnight ride.  You understand.  Theyve offered to take me wherever I want to go, but I told them that all I really want to do while I am there is drink tons of vodka tonics.  They loved that idea.  I am SO going to party it up.  And eat lots of good food and sleep and rest and ride in a car and not have to wear a jacket outside and go in their hot tub every five minutes and meet their gay friends and play tons of card games and and and and, man, I cant wait.  Off to get my hair cut for the big trip.  Unfortunately, I have so much pomade in my hair today that the stylist is totally going to yell at me the minute I sit in her chair.  I am going to tell her to go fuck herself up the twat and then leave.  Its going to be great.  I just know it.  Happy Monday!

      Whoa.  Drank way too much last night and puked the second I ate my first cheeseburger from McDonalds.  Cant believe that I actually made it into work today.   Gonna go home and lay my head down before I have to do it all over again tonight.    Heh.   Ouch.  My stomach holds the fire of a thousand vodka tonics.    My bowels hold the weight of everything that is ugly and scary about the world.  Help me help myself.

      Today, I was sitting on a park bench, reading my book and smoking a cigarette, when the most horrible thing happened.  I took the last few drags from my smoke and then tossed the butt on the ground.  Within seconds a pigeon ran over and scooped it up into his beak.  A couple of moments later, the pigeon freaked out and spit it out onto the ground.  Then, I SWEAR he looked at me in the eye with hatred and flew off.  It was bizarre and I felt terrible.  And then I laughed and laughed.  Yeah, its  MY  fault you ate that butt.   My  fault.   Myyyy  fault.  Ok enough.  I had pizza for lunch and now my belly bubbles with anger.  Yeah, its  MY  fault that my belly is bubbling with anger.   MY  fault.  Ok enough.  Last night I went home and surprised hamster Jim and hamster Kim with some fun new toys for their cage.  Since they currently live in an aquarium, I was able to buy a new top with maze-like tubes sticking out of it.  Now they can leave the cage and run around the tubes for awhile.  Its great and amusing and they seem to really love it.  I also bought them some fun new treats and some new yarn-like bedding.  Of course Kimberly has stolen all the new bedding and put it on her side of the cage.  Poor Jim sits, frozen, in the corner of the cage, naked.  That selfish Kimberlyshes such a cunt.  I am busy making my Christmas Wish List for my mother.  She has been on my ass about getting it to her as quickly as possible.  She likes to shop for months before Christmas.  I think it takes her mind off of the bad things going on in her life.  This time aroundmy brother not being able to be with us during any of the holidays.  When I asked my mom what we were going to do for Christmas this year in order to make it specialshe said Your father and I were thinking about taking you all out to dinner and then to a movie.  Thanks momthe typical Jewish Christmas.    The ARMY offered my brother a two-week leave package since he is going to be in Baghdad for over a year.  Instead of taking the leave time, my brother gave it up to one of the men in his unit.  According to my bro, the guy he gave it to just had a baby and was unable to be there for the birth.  When this story got back to me, I was so proud of my brother that I literally burst into tears.  My mom cried too, but her response was How could he DO that?  Doesnt he know how badly I miss him?  Babies dont have the recognition of whether they see their father or not?!!?  Ok, maybe she didnt go that far, but she was puh-retty upset.  We are all proud of Winfield, but it totally sucks being on the other end of all of this.  We miss him so badly.  Sometimes I sit around and fantasize about the day he will come home.  I think about what my face will look like when I see him walk off the plane, or if I will cry or not.  Often I picture myself running up to him and tackling him to the ground, pinning his skinny, Iraqi weakened body to the floor.  What will we have for dinner the first night he is home?  Will he look as different as he must feel?  War changes people and I wonder what kind of change will have taken its hold on Winfield.  Will he have nightmares?  Will he cry alot?  Will he still want to get out of the ARMY?  I spend every day living as though I am an only child.  I talk to my parents every day; I go about my normal activities.  It is only when he calls or I get a letter that I am truly reminded of the fact that one of the people I love most in this world is half way across the planet.  Maybe its wrong that I dont carry him in my mind wherever I go.  Or maybe its justified.  Either way, there is no right answer.  And either way, I have to get through this whole ordeal somehow.    It sucks that he has missed my birthdays for years, or that he wasnt able to even get a glimpse at the first show I did in NYC.  It is heartbreaking that even when he has completed his time in Baghdad, he will move back to Germany and not to the states.  Part of me will always be angry with him for this.  Part of me despises the fact that he chose this path.  But most of me worries that he wont come back alive and that I will be stuck living the rest of my life with a memory of my brother at 24 years old.  Its not fair and I am just about so sick of this whole fucking thing that I could fly out to Iraq myself and drag him home by the scruff of his neck.    But until then, I will continue to pray and trust in Gods divine mercy.  I will also continue to throw cigarette butts onto the ground and hope that every pigeon in the city will eat them up.   I meanfuck.  I gotta take out my aggression on SOMETHING.

      Okaythis poem is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO lame as I didnt have much time to do it.  But I hope you all feel a bit special because of it.  I just love you all so much.   The Strangers That Became My Friends   There was a time when I was lonely  starved For friends, for love, for support. Words were scrambled in my brain, Fumbling, falling inside the depth of my person. Then there was Rita, the one who saved my thoughts from destruction.  Her intelligence and creativity guided me through The process, the chance to formulate my internal struggle. I met Blogger and began to compose My new persona, my opportunity to turn my life Into something more interesting.  Joe CuttheShit was born. The long, introspective trip began.  Along the way, Joe has been blessed by many, Those looking to offer support, encouragement, love. Shocked and in awe of the power of words, Joe moved forward  deeply touched and affected. Altered for the better.

      Hi.  So I just got back from lunch.  I spent my hour reading a book that my dear friend Rita gave me, entitled  Running With Scissors .  So far so good.  At first I was like This book is base and lame.  But then I got to page 8 and it was much better.  I am so impatient sometimes its ridiculous.   My name is Joe.  AnyhowI hung with Paul last night and we had a GREAT evening together.  We had a nice dinner and watched the movie  Very Bad Things , one of my absolute favorites.  We laughed and laughed together all night long and when we went to bed, I pulled a huge practical joke on him.    (I cant believe I am going to write about this now)  As we were in our spooning position, ready for bed, I decided to rub my asshole on his leg.  I was tickling him in the process so he didnt realize that my butthole was suctioned to his leg.  About 5 minutes later, Paul says I smell poop.  I reply: Maybe you farted.   Paul:  I didnt fart and it still smells like poop. Me:  You did fart.  I heard you. Paul:  Joe, I did not fart.  I should know if I farted. I tell him to go to bed and we curl up again and I suction my asshole to his leg again.  Paul:  Joe, it REALLY smells like poop.   Me:  (unable to contain my laughter anymore)  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Paul:  You didnt. Me:  I DID!  You poop smelling, motha fucka. Paul:  SICK!  Joeyou dont rub assholes on boyfriends. Me:  Ohsee I thought that was what boyfriends were SUPPOSED to do. Paul:  You are disgusting and now I have to go wash my leg. Me:  Snorego to bed. And thats what he did.  He went to bed.  I woke up this morning and could smell nothing.  So snorseville Paul.  There was never poop on your leg.    Or was there  I have to piss.  Annoying.  Lets play a game  If you can answer these three questions about my life, I will write a poem about you.  You may submit answers via email or via my comments:  Here we go:  1) What is the one thing about men that turns me on the most?  2) My brother is currently living where?  3) The name of my character in the play I just completed is  (Ariyou are not allowed to play.  Ritaneither are you.  Kellyno dice.  You three  know way too much already, its scary.  ((of course you know the most Reets))    Alrighty  Time to go rub my asshole on anyone who will let me.  Peace.

      The show has officially come to a close.    Yesterday morning when I woke up, I immediately began to feel depressed.  It took me hours to drag myself out of bed and once I finally did, I spent most of the day sporadically crying.  Not only was I upset that the show was over, I was upset that I wouldnt be seeing Ian and Sarah (two of the other people in the show) every day.  And above all of this, I was most upset that I had to say goodbye to my character, Neechee.  It is quite difficult to spend 3 months pretending that you are someone else, knowing that eventually you will have to just stop and never be that person again.  At 26 years old, I find it very hard to believe that I will be playing this 17-year old character again in the future.  I think I could be getting a bit too old for that.     It was a very emotional evening for all of us.  The show was a complete success and the audiences seemed to be really affected by both the plays content and the performances we gave.  All of my friends from college came on Saturday night and for me, that was the best performance I did.  The tears flew out of my face easily and I felt completely focused the entire time.  Afterwards, they popped open a bottle of champagne for us and then we hit some local Manhattan bars and ended up partying at their hotel for awhile.  It was an amazing night.  One of the absolute best.  As we said goodbye and got into the elevator, I started to cry.  I miss my Rita so much that seeing her for such a short time really broke my heart.  I wanted her to stay forever.  Now that the show is over, I am pretty excited to have some time to myself.  It will be great to get some real rest and relaxation as well as be able to go out with my friends and party it up!  For instance, this Thursday, I am going out with 8 fellow gay men for an event that has been dubbed Gay Sex out in the City.  I only know three of the guys that are going to be there, but I am SO excited to be able to get together with a group of gays for a night out at the bars.  YAY!  I am SO going to fuck all of them in the ass.  Ok, sike.  They are so going to fuck me in the ass.  Ok, sick.  Anyhoodle, Paul took such good care of me yesterday.  I called him around 4pm yesterday very upset and he immediately calmed me down and made me feel better.  He was going to bring two friends of his to the show, but I asked him to come alone cuz I really wanted to spend the evening with just him.  As we were leaving, a few tears escaped my eyes and Paul put his arm around me (in the middle of Brooklyn!) and walked me to the subway.  We got back to his apartment, smoked a bowl, and then he took me out to a wonderful dinner.  It was exactly the way I wanted to spend the evening.    Sometimes Paul really does come through for me.  Let it not go unnoticed.  Tonight we are planning on going to dinner again and then cuddling and watching TV.  I am SO excited to have the night off and to be able to spend it with him.  We are going to watch  The Simpsons  together and just enjoy being in each others presence.  Just like the olden days.  You know, the days when everything was covered in Sepia.    You understand.  Some tidbits about this weekend:  On Friday night, in the middle of a performance, I went backstage to get ready for my next scene.  While there I realized that the gun I have to pull at the end of the play wasnt in its appropriate spot.  I immediately start to panic and look at Kelly and go: THE GUN IS MISSING!  THE FUCKING GUN IS MISSING!  She was so calm and was like I will find it.  Just focus and dont worry about it.  In turn, I responded BUT THE FUCKING GUN!  HOW COULD I BE SO STUPID TO NOT CHECK ON IT?!  I CANT DO THE SHOW WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE THE GUN IS!?!?!?!  I forced myself to shut up and after the next scene, she found it and took my heart out of my throat and put it back into my chest.  Last night, the video camera that we use for the live feed, fell down and crashed right at the end of the performance.  Kelly and I didnt even wince.  We just continued with our dialogue.  Also, every person who drank a beer during the performance managed to drop it 103 times during the show.  It was like performing for a bunch of wasted Frat. guys.    Also on Friday, Megan, the director, was holding on to Kellys cell phone during the show and wouldnt you know it?  IT RANG IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR PERFORMANCE.  Ironically enough, the caller was a guy that was in the companys last show.  On the message he said: I think you are in the middle of a performance.  I hope you remembered to turn off the ringer.  HAHAHAHAHAHA.  No. Kelly did not remember.  The financial investor never showed up.  Nor did he call.  Bastid.  BUT, the parents of the playwright came and it was such an unforgettable experience meeting them and being in their presence.  They fully enjoyed the show and had some powerful things to say to me after it was over.  I hugged them a couple of times and felt completely fulfilled.  Things with Ian and I ended on a high note.  He and I have plans to hang out at the end of the week or early next week.  I am going to miss him very much.  Although a bit difficult to work with, he has taught me a great deal about myself.  This experience wouldnt have been the same if he and I didnt form the bond that we did.    I feel so blessed by all of this.  The show went well, everyone I know came out to support me, and I fully believe that all those in attendance were moved by my performance.    Now.  On to bigger and better.    God willing.

      YAHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!  The show went incredibly well last night.  We had a full audience, we were able to ride through any random mistakes and there were tears shed by numerous people at the end of the performance.  I could not have asked for a more wonderful start to a long run.  God is so good to me.  He truly does reward hard work.  My only hope is that he will stand by me throughout the rest of the performances.  I am sure he will.  :)  So.  The one thing that did not make me happy was the way Ian acted before and after the show.  He barely spoke a word to anyone in the cast and as he did last Saturday, left immediately after the performance.  He didn't even stay around to tell me that it was a good show.  I don't understand what is wrong with him, but it hurts.  I have spent so much time trying to get to know him and to support him, yet he has completely pulled away from me.  It's like he wants nothing to do with me anymore.  Maybe he has some shit going on in his personal life or maybe this is how he deals with a show ending and I can accept any or all of that.  I just wish he would clue me in to what's going on in his head.  Part of me thinks he is unhappy with the way my performance is being received by the audiences.  I get a lot of support from the people who attend and I think he may feel a little left out.  But truthfully, most of the people that have come to see the show are people I know and got tickets for.  If he had spent more time getting people in the seats, maybe he wouldn't feel so overlooked at the end.  I work really hard to give the performance I give and part of me thinks that his jealousy is getting in the way of us being friends.  Maybe I'm completely off base?  I hope so.  Cuz if this is how he feels, I don't know that we will ever be able to talk again once this experience has come to a close.    It's just a sad, sad thing.  As for the other shit going on in my life?  My hamsters, Jim and Kimberly, are becoming so scarily attached to me.  When I get home at night and turn on my bedroom light, they immediately come running from their beds and try to climb out of the cage.  I take the top off and they (Jim especially) crawls right into my hand and runs up to my neck to snuggle in.  They are totally in love with me now and it makes me want to have them as my babies forever.  They are so fucking adorable I can't stand it.   Things with Paul and I are going smoothly although I'm still not convinced we are going to be able to work through our many issues.  Some things just never change.  Some days I love him and some days I hate him.  It's not healthy, but it's the way things are.  And the way things are going to stay for awhile longer.  I'm just not ready to say goodbye to him yet.  I don't know if I will ever be ready.  My mom came to the show again last night.  She is so adorable and supportive.  I miss her so much.  She is my favorite person in the world and I am so blessed to have someone like her as my mother.  She is coming AGAIN on Saturday with my dad and some other people we know from way back.  Gosh, my parents.  A kid couldn't be any luckier than me.  Okay!  The next time I write in here, I will be done with  Stupid Kids .    I can't believe it's almost over.  How depressing.  Now what am I going to do with myself?

       Another Openin, Another Show.  Another Openin, Another Show   YAY!  Its that time again.  Time to go put a gun in my mouth and bring everyone to tearshopefully.  Oh, does that sound weird to you?  Well, to most people it would.  But to meevery time we do a show, I know going into it that I need to attempt suicide at the end of every performance and bring myself to hysterical tears.  It takes a lot out of me, if you can imagine.    When we first started rehearsing, I would put the gun in my mouth and scream my way through the entire scene.  Since then, I have been working extremely hard on taking each moment as it comes.  Some nights, all I do is scream and yell, and some nights, I become a blubbering mess on stage.  But on all nights, I sort of wish that I was playing a different character.  A character that gets to stand by and watch the events transpire instead of having to be the one that forces them towelltranspire.  Its a lot of pressure to put a gun in your mouth on stage.  If it comes off looking fake or hokey, the whole thing is for shit and people leave thinking that the play was goodexcept for the guy at the end that was fake shooting himself with a gun.    You understand.  What I do now to prepare is put the whole thing out of my mind.  According to my character, Neechee, there is no need for a gun-to-mouth experience.  Neechee, although a bit filled with lunacy, is still a focused and together guy.  But when Jim, my love interest, shits on me one too many times, thats it.  I lose it.    So, I spend the whole play pining and pining for his acceptancehis love.  He uses me and abuses me and by the end, if I believe in everything that has occurred between us during the show, I am ready to either blow his head offor blow off my own.  Its a beautiful thing really.  And lucky for me, the audiences last weekend fully believed me.  Lets hope for the same during this 4-day run.  The only real downfall to playing a character such as Neechee is that at the end of the show, all I want to do is crawl inside a box and cry my eyes out.  I have to get myself so worked up in order to go psycho at the end and just because the lights have gone down and the curtain call is coming, it doesnt mean that I can just turn off the sadness and anger that is coursing through my veins.  What usually happens is that I finish the last scene, go to my spot for the bows, cry a bit more, chug a beer, and slap a shit-eating grin on my face.  Once the lights have gone down completely, I go into a corner, change into my normal clothes, cry the rest of the tears out, if need be, and force myself to go shmooze with the people I know in the audience.    Its a very bizarre experience and hard for people who arent actors to understand what its like.  Most of the times, non-actors tell me how lucky I am to have an outlet for my underlying emotions.  If I were an actor that had to cry on stage, I would love it, cuz I would be able to get out all of the emotions that plague me during the day.  But its not like that.  Its more likebringing up all of the stuff that hurts you and then once you are finally releasing all of the pent up emotion, you have to turn it off immediately and move on.  Its not at all a healing process.  But if it works and the audience cries with me, then it is surely a fulfilling experience.  So, as I prepare to take the stage again tonight, these are the thoughts that run crazy-like through my head.  I want to give an honest performance.  I want people to listen to me and to follow my character.  And most importantly, I want people to identify with Neechee and truly feel it when he is happy or when he is sad.  Thus affecting the audience member in a powerful and moving way.  I am so blessed to be able to play a part that has such range.  It gives me a chance to really showcase my talent and to teach people something about homosexuality that they may not have previously thought about in the past.    Thank you God for this opportunity.

      3 more days until I see my ladies from college!    They are hastily making plans to come down to see Kellys and my show this weekend.  I talked to Rita for awhile today and her excitement got me all nervous and pumped!  Not only is she coming with my friends from school, but also with her sister Jeannie, who I havent seen in almost a year!  What a thrill this weekend is going to be.  The thing is  Part of me is really depressed about the show coming to a head this weekend.  Saturdays performance will be quite the thrill, but then Sunday comes and the show is over.  I forgot how upsetting it is to finish up a show and say goodbye to everyone involved.  Remember when I was in love with Ian for like 10 minutes?  Well, after Sunday, I pretty much doubt we will stay in touch.  I mean, things are going very well between us and we have gotten much closer as the show has progressed.  But Ian and I have different lives and I am sure our connection will die with the closing of the show.  Thats ok.  I would prefer that we stayed in touch, but Im bad with that and I know he will be too.    I have decided to direct a show with this company as soon as  Stupid Kids  comes to a close.  I havent picked the play that I want to direct yet, but I will need to do that soon.  I have one week off after the show and then I leave to go to California for a weekso time is of the utmost!  As soon as I return from Cali., I am going to have to begin rehearsals immediately.  We will only have 6 weeks to put the next show together and while the task seems pretty dauntingI am ready for the challenge.    FUN.  So, despite what certain people have to say about my starting my career at the age of 26, I am pretty stoked to have two different commercial agents in the audience this coming Saturday night.  Cuz I meanwhat if?  What if they see me and are like We want to represent you and take you away from your miserable existence as an Admin. Assistant!  What a dream come true that would be.  Most likely, they will come see the show, gush to me about what a wonderful job I did, and then high tail it out of there as though they have never met me in their life.  Either way, its fine.  The only person I trust to guide my career is God.  All of this is in his hands, really.  I made the decision to dedicate my life to this dream based on his guidance and it will only be through him that I succeed.  I will keep my eyes pointed upwards and my patience level intact.    Until thencan I fax something for you?  I am wiped out today.  I am definitely going to have to take a quick nap during my lunch break if I ever plan on getting through my touch-up rehearsal tonight.  I feel like the walking dead.  My brain is all mushylike rotted potatoes.  Or squash.  Or pudding.  Or swing sets.  You understand.  Here are a few artists that I love these days:  TLC Nine Inch Nails The New American Standard Kelly Rowlands OutKast Beyonce Dave Matthews Band (Welcome back brother manyoure new disc is JOOD!  Finally!) Christina Aguillera (Two Lsone for each labia)  Here are a few artists that I am embarrassed to love these days:  Hillary Duff Simple Plan Lillix  Here are a few artists that I cant stand(!) these days:  Ashanti Sean Paul (Just gimme the lie din don dih bo oh oh.) Sugar Ray Avril LaSnores  Here are a few artists that I want to shit on these days:  Britney Spears Madonna Pink Kid Rock Sheryl Crow  Wellthats about it for today.    ENJOY YOUR WEDNESDAY CUZ TOMORROW IS THURSDAY!  YIPEE KAY YAI YAY MOTHA FUCKA!

      HO YEAH!  The opening weekend of the show is over and I have to say that it could not have turned out any better.  All of the months of rehearsing and stressing has truly paid off.  The show was received wonderfully and I think that everyone who attended walked away touched by both the content of the play and the performances given by the actors.   urlLink Ari  was in the audience on Friday night, along with two of her fellow blogging friends.  Everyone was so supportive after the show and it made me feel so good to know that I had them there for me.  On Saturday night my parents came and my boss from work and a bunch of other people from my life and it was a slamming good show as well.    I was walking on clouds until I woke up this morning and realized that I had to come back to my daily 9am-5pm hum drum of a life.    The friend of the playwright, David, came on Friday and he had some wonderful things to say to me.  He told me that John Russell, the playwright, wrote my character based on his own perspective on life and that he would have been beaming with pride to see the work that I had done.  He said that my performance was powerful and emotional and honest.  He said that I made him cry.  When he was talking to me about the similarities between my character and Johns life, I began to cry as well and we ended up having a very meaningful hug after all was said and done.      At the end of our conversation, David asked me if I had any representation.  I explained to him that I sent out over 50 headshots and resumes, but that I never heard back from a single agent.  He told me that after the show he wants to sit down and have dinner with me so that he can help me out in whatever way he can.  The smile on my face was huge and I told him that I would contact him as soon as our run was complete.  This weekend was one of the best theater experiences I have ever had in my life.  Both shows were successful and the audience raved about the final product.  When I saw my parents after the show on Saturday, my mom was in hysterical tears.  She said: I had no idea that the show was going to be as moving as it was.  Your character ripped my heart out at the end and I still feel as though I cant get myself under control.  Both she and my dad went on and on about the performance and as I put them in the car and sent them home, they both hugged me and told me how proud they are of me.  It was a beautiful moment that I wont forget for the rest of life.    I feel elated with how well everything went.  The audiences really seemed to enjoy the production and more importantly, I think they felt affected by the body of work.  I cant imagine anything that could have gone any better.  I am a real life actor again and it feels SO good!    Now I have one more night off before I have to jump into 5 more days of complete craziness.  Tomorrow is a brush up rehearsal and then we have 4 evenings of performances in a row.  My best friends from school are coming on Saturday, including the love of my life, Miss Rita!  They are all staying in the city after the show, so I will be able to hug them and love them all night long.    Last weekend was a great opening and preparation for what is coming up.  I have to make sure to get as much rest and relaxation in now as I can.  I dont think there will be any of that before next Monday hits.    I wish I could make a career out of acting.  Its all I have ever wanted.  Some day.  Some day soon.

      Well!  Tonight is the night.  After months of preparation, it all comes down to this evening.  It is the opening night of  Stupid Kids  and I couldnt be more pumped about it.    Last nights preview went very well.  We received a wonderful response from the people who were there and even a few tears were shed.  It was excellent.  As a crazy actor, I still believe that there is more that I can do with my performance and my focus during the run can be a bit better.  I have to remember to use the dialogue to my advantage and to try my hardest to stay in the moment.  Live on impulse!   urlLink Ari  is coming to the show tonight as well as some great friends of mine from college and high school.  I am performing solely for them.  Well, and also for the dead playwrights best friend and ex-therapist who are coming as well!  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!  I so hope they like the show.    Thank you to all of you for your undying love and support.  I feel so blessed to have this online community in my life.  You all make me feel so confident and secure in my ability.  And a special thank you to  urlLink Amaryllis , who sent me the most beautiful virtual bouquet I have ever seen.  What an incredibly sweet thing to do.    BREAK A LEG --- GOOD SHOW --- FUCK YEAH!  The time is now.    And I am ready.

      HAPPY THANKSGIVING!  Well, almost Happy Thanksgiving.  One day to go!    I woke up really excited about the holiday.  When life gives you lemons, you have to make Country Time or some shit.  Right?    Today is my brothers birthday.  Whenever it crosses my mind, I get a twinge of sadness that eats away at my insides.  I hope that his fellow soldiers are doing something nice for him today.  I am big on birthdays and it kills me to know that my brother has to spend his in Baghdad.  Then tomorrow he has to spend Thanksgiving eating under a tent with his fellow ARMY brothers.  It will be a horrible couple of days for him, but he will get through it and so will we.  I told my mom that I am going to arrive at home in a good mood, with a positive attitude.  It is up to me to make sure that we all laugh a lot and enjoy the time together.  I will do my best.  Tonight we are going to party it up at the  urlLink Albany Gay Bars .  I always look forward to going out gay in Albany.  I get to walk in and act all NYC-ish.  Plus, I am fresh meat to them, so the guys tend to dote on me a bit.  Heh heh.  Always feels good to be doted on.  Then on Friday night we will go out and do it all over again.  Saturday, my parents are driving Kelly and I back to the city.  That night my parents are taking me to see the  urlLink Christmas Spectacular  show at Radio City Music Hall.  This is our third year attending and each time it is such a thrill.  Its definitely the way to start the Christmas season.  Very much looking forward to it.  So you see?  Although the holidays are not nearly as wonderful with my brother being gone, there are still events to look forward to.  I just have to remind my parents of that by being the best son I can be.  What do you eat for your Thanksgiving dinner?  Our menu consists of: Turkey (obviously) Mashed Potatoes (yem!) Peas (sorta yem!) Broccoli and Cheese (my personal favorite) Yams (sick) Coleslaw (sickest) Rolls (slurp) Pies  usually blueberry and chocolate Ambrosia (weird marshmallow dessert-esque food, but its actually pretty good)  There may be a few other things thrown in there, but I really only care about the turkey, potatoes, and broccoli.  You understand.  Every Thanksgiving, my mom and I always watch  urlLink Planes, Trains, and Automobiles  together (the quintessential Thanksgiving movie).  When I spoke to my mom earlier today, she said, Are you bringing home any of the good stuff?  By good stuff, she means Mary Jana.  Hahahaha.  I say Yes mam!  And we will be sure to toke some buds together!  My mom replies Toke em thuds?  I laughed and said, Yes, toke em thuds!  You love that!  She couldnt BE any more adorable.  I feel so grateful for so many things.  Among the list are: My family  especially brother, granny, and uncles! My boyfriend Paul My friends  especially you Rita Lovely! My job Theatre Our US Troops My hamsters  Jim and Kim NYC Pizza and French Fries  urlLink The Real World/Road Rules Gauntlet  My dashing good looks  ha! My health and the health of those I love. And most of allI am grateful to God for giving me all of this.  Thank you to Jesus for dying on the cross for our sins.  And thank you to those who work so hard at bringing God into other peoples lives.    Happy Thanksgiving to all of you lovelies.  Make the best of it and eat your face off!  I lovel u.

      Today I am exhausted.  I dont know what it is.  I did nothing last night, but shove my face with food and hang with my boyfriend.  Yet, I walk around in pure zombie form this afternoon as though I was out all night partying it up with Paris Hilton and Nicole Ritchie.  You understand.    I made the dyer mistake of eating two slices of pizza for lunch.  I dont know if its the cold weather or because Thanksgiving is around the corner or whatbut I am starving.  Always starving.  Always ready to cook up a quick ham and shove it down my gullet.  Probably follow it with a 32oz glass of gravy.  And maybe a spoonful of peas.   Sike.  Like I even like gravy.  That shit is so nasty. Cept on french fries sometimes.  That can be good.  For some reason my house phone is disconnected.  I think the wind knocked the line dead or something.  Either that or a killer is plotting my grisly death.   Eh.  This has been the longest week of my life.  I am not really looking forward to going home, although I know it will be enjoyable once I get there.  Of course I want to see and spend time with my parents.  Of course I want to go out to the gay bars in Albany.  Of course I want to play with my parents little pup.  And of course it will be so nice to be out of NYC and in the clean, fresh smelling air of Albany, NY.  Its really beautiful up there.  When I was home a couple of weeks ago, I marveled at how gorgeous Albany really is.  Its so simple and calm.  The anxiety just runs out of my bones and I settle in to life there so quickly.    The only downside is that I am allergic to my old cat.  So by Friday morning, my eyes will be swollen and I will be breathing through my dickhead.  Theres no way to avoid it.  Just have to deal with it.  I do love my shower at home though.  So much water cascading over my pizza-laden thighs.  I may even take a bath.  I havent done that since like early 2000.  I could use one.  Calgon take me away or some shit.    Only two more hours to get through before I can go back to my apartment.   Gotta pack and clean the hamster cage and do a conference call with the Theatre Company.    After that, to bed I said.

       Updates   The weekend was great!  I am FINALLY feeling better.  I woke up this morning and was actually in a good mood.  Who would have thought that could happen on a Monday?  I still have a residual cough, but my aches and pains are gone and I dont feel nearly as cranky as I have felt for the last two weeks.    Just in time for  urlLink Ari  to catch it.  She is home now and doing her best to keep her sanity.  Poor thing.  The fundraiser was a major success.  We didnt raise as much money as we had hoped, but we did fairly well.  Everyone that came had a blast.  The entire space was turned into this raging cool dance club.  The music was tight and the decorations were fucking phenomenal.  I met a slew of people and drank half the keg myself.  (I forgot how TASTY keg beer really is)  I am very pleased with the way it turned out.  And I also have the best friends in the world.  Almost everyone I know in the city came down to support.    My brothers best friend in Iraq, Lou, was in a horrible accident this weekend.  From what I have been told, Lou, was on a mission when a wall crumbled and fell on top of him.  Both of his legs and pelvic area was smashed in the accident.  He was flown to Germany where they are currently trying to put his lower body region back together.  It was a horrible, horrible thing, and my brother is on the verge of a nervous breakdown.  Not only is he upset that Lou got so hurt, but also that he doesnt have him in Iraq with him anymore.  They didnt get to see each other very often, but it gave him piece of mind to know that he was right around the corner.  Winfield called my parents in tears yesterday.  Only the second time he has cried since he has been there.  My dad called me in tears this morning to relay the news.  Ugh.  And Thanksgiving is in 3 days.   In other newsKelly told me the funniest story on Friday.    She was babysitting for this 2-year-old boy.  While he was sitting with her, she signed online and a picture of Michael Jackson came up on the screen.  Gus, the baby, looked at Kelly, looked at the picture of Michael and said That lady looks like you!   End story.  Busy week ahead of me.  Paul and I are going to go to dinner at  urlLink Rocco's  tonight.  You may remember that place from the NBC show The Restaurant.  I cant wait to try Mamas Meatballs.  YEM!  Off to lunch now.    Gotta clear my head for a bit.

      I have seen the face of death and I have shit right on it.    I am finally back at work.  Much to my dismay, I have spent the last 72 hours in bed - alone, sick, and miserable.  Sometimes its nice to have a day or two off.  Sometimes it SUCKS.  This time, in particular, I hated it.    The flu is an ugly disease that, in the past, I have been lucky enough to avoid.  Looking back on my history of illnesses, I cant remember actually getting the  flu .  I have had bad colds and the like, but never an actual case of the influenza.    I still feel weak and cranky and have no appetite to speak of.  My cough still scares small children and my breathwellPaul has no eyebrows left on his face due to my breathing on him all night.  Tonight is our big November Fundraiser for the Theatre Company.  Thank God that I feel somewhat okay.  There is a lot of work to be done and I have just enough energy left to do it.  We hope to raise upwards of $1,000 tonight.  I dont see any reason why we wont.  We have 4 DJs rotating music until all hours of the night and many have RSVPd.    I dont plan on staying there any later than 12am, but you never know.  Sometimes beer helps one to feel better when they have the flu.  (snicker snicks)  Thanks for all of the great advice everyone gave me.  I do have a new toothbrush and I am constantly washing my hands.  I am drinking lots of liquids and I am eating the healthiest of healthy foods.    I have never wanted to beat a sickness so badly in my life.    Stay healthy yall.    The flu makes no exceptions.  Except for bodybuilders.   Who DOESNT make exceptions for bodybuilders?

      Well, it's official.  I have influenza.  Or something equally as ugly.    I am leaving work now to go home and die in a corner.    Love me.  But don't get too close or you may be loving me out your ass for the next two weeks.  Over and out.

      Back from my weekend with the parents.  It was an exceptionally good visit this time around.  No tears were shed and although we did talk a lot about Winfield, most of it was positive.  I am much relieved that there were no emotional outbursts.  I really needed this weekend to clear my head.  And that I did.    Now Ive got my nose back to the grindstone.  This Friday is our November Fundraiser for the Theatre Company.  I am nervous as to what the attendance will be.  Considering that we need a lot of people to come in order to raise money for Decembers rent, our fingers, toes, and tits are crossed.  The fundraiser is essentially a Record Release Party for the guy who did the sound for  Stupid Kids .  He will be debuting his new album and we are fortunate enough to keep all of the profits for the company.  It is really hard to anticipate the level of attendance since most of our patrons will come because of him.  I was incredibly stressed about it this weekend, but now I have calmed down.  At this point, there is no need to worry.  If its a flop, its a flop.  I have too much going on to worry about it anymore.  Worst case scenarioI drink a keg by myself and stumble home.    Okayhow bout BEST case scenario, I drink a keg by myself and stumble home.  I just spilled the toner for the copy machine all over myself and the entire supply room floor.  As soon as it happened, I started screaming SHIT!  SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT!.  The students ran away in fear.  When I looked at my jeans, I saw that they were COVERED in black shit.  I just got the jeans Im wearing, two weeks ago.  However, with patience and understanding, I was able to get rid of the black powder from my right pant leg without so much as a spot.  (Thank the Lord in heaven above.  Cuz I certainly dont have enough money to go out and buy a new pair of jeans) Now, our housekeeper is scrubbing the supply room floor to rid it of the huge mess I caused.  I told her that I would clean it myself, but she just let out an egg fart and refused to let me help.    I havent spent any time with Paul over the last week.  In fact, I havent seen him since LAST Monday when we hung out.  Because of this, tonight he is taking me out for the night.  We are either staying in a hotel or going to an expensive dinner.  He wont tell me exactly what it is.  But I am tre excited.  We will not be partaking in any sex type adventures as my dick has some sort of rash on it.  I used a very frilly type of lotion last week and my dick exploded in irritation.  I am not happy about it, to say the least.  In order to allow it time to heal, I have had to completely refrain from masturbating.  But then, late last night, I tugged on my dick for 5 solid minutes.  My insides were exploding with cum and I just had to release it.  When I woke up this morning, my dick had become an innie instead of an outie.  I now have an infected vagina.  Looks like I wont be playing with myself until early December.  I am now leaving to get my hair cut.  As you know, I HATE getting my hair cut.  But I love being pretty, so I must go.    Latas lovahs!

      Its Friday and I am off to Albany for the weekend.  Im going so that I can spend time with the moms and the dads.  They are in dire need of some love.  I know Thanksgiving is only two weeks away, but my parents are hella depressed these days.  I am hoping that my visit will lift their spirits a bit.  And mine.  The other night Mariah took a couple of us to see  Little Shop of Horrors  on Broadway!  It is like my favorite show of all time.  The whole experience was wonderful.  I have to admit that I was not a fan of the girl who played Audrey.  I thought her performance was weak and that she made some pretty bad acting choices.  Seymour had a couple of nice moments, but irritated me and the rest of the audience with his inexperienced physical comedy skills.  Thinking back on it, it could be the direction that was way off and not the actors.  Its hard to tell.  Some of the show was brilliant and some of it was terrible.  Bad direction should have led to the whole show falling on its face.  But reallyI only found Audrey and Seymour to be the ones falling on their faces.  Ah well. However, the show was not a total wash.  Not in the least!  The Doo-Wop girls were sensational and the dentist stole the show.  I also thought that the set and the lighting was out of this world.    To sum it up, I think Kelly hit the nail on the head when she turned to me and said: Thank God there is a talking plant in this musical.  It is so much fun to go to the theatre and I always walk away with a deep aching to be on the stage.  Oh how I wish I could have the chance to play the part of Seymour in this musical.  Oh how I WISH!  Last night I ate a whole bag of chewy sprees.  I woke up with no teeth in my mouth.  I had to gum my first cigarette of the day.   I also tuned in to  Friends  for the first time in years.  That Monica Gellermanshe puts me in stitches.  Is it wrong that I want to grow up to be just like her?  She is everything I want to be as a girl.  Alrightyhave a great weekend everyone!    Its time for me to go hug my mom and dad.

      Ever have one of those months where you are so stressed out that you feel as though you could burst into tears at any moment?    Well, consider this my month.    Since my trip to California, nothing in my life has been smooth.  I have filled my evenings by becoming a full time active member of the Theatre Company.  (more work than I could ever explain)  My mundane and totally unsatisfying job is slamming me with project after project.  I have recently found out that one of my co-workers is leaving us in December and all that does for me iscreate more work.    On top of this, I have been struggling with the flu of death.  I have had the shits, a fever, a horrible head cold, body aches, and borderline hallucinations.  However the hallucinations may be a result of shitting out everything that lives inside my body.    Paul and I are good, but I am having a hard time fitting him into my schedule.  My friends are good, but who has time to make everyone happy?    And as I mentioned previously, I am throwing a Murder Mystery Party.  GOSH!  Who am I KIDDING?!?!  I think the reason all of this is getting to me today is:  This is the first holiday season that I will spend without my brother.  For my entire life, my parents, brother and grandmother have gotten together to celebrate the holidays.  This year it will be just my parents, myself, and my grams.  I am dreading the whole thing.  If possible, I would choose to fast forward right to January.  Bypass the whole thing and pretend as though it never happened.    Its sad really.  For us AND for Winfield.  He will be sitting in a steaming hot building on Christmas, having dried out SPAM with his fellow soldiers.  The whole idea of it is enough to make me start crying, from now until New Years.  As strong as I have tried to be with my parents about my brothers absence, and as strong as I have tried to be for myself, there are days like today when I want to throw in the towel and lock myself in my bedroom for weeks.  I just love him so much and I need him right now.    Winfield has missed out on so much of my life and vice versa.  He was unable to see my first show in NYC.  He will be unable to see my next two shows, at least.  There are few phone calls, few letters, and even fewer moments of honesty between us.  How you holding up out there? Same as always.  How you holding up in the city? Fine.  Same as always. I miss you. I miss you too.  And thats about it.  Arent I supposed to be growing up with my brother still?  I understand that we are both in our twenties and that it is natural for us to be in different places, doing different things.  But its been this way since he went away to college.  While I stayed within hours from home, Winfield went to school at Wake Forest, in North Carolina.  While I graduated and moved to NYC (still within hours from home), Winfield moved to Germany to be in the ARMY.    My brother and I didnt become close until the summer before I left for college.  Since then we have only had summers and school breaks to be together.  He tricked me into allowing him into my personal life.  He tricked me into trusting and leaning on him.  He tricked me because he moved away and did his own thing.    But what about me?  What about us?  What about Christmas?    Its days like today that make me feel as though there is nothing to look forward to.  I am working my ass off every day and yet, at the end of it, I dont have Winfield here to share it with.  I dont have his friendship.  I have a phone call every 5 weeks that results in us making sure the other is okay.  Well, I am not okay.   I am sad and lonely and understand that it only gets worse from here on in.    Come home already.  God, I dont know.  Its just hard

      (Sheepish grin)  Hi. Its me.  Your old friend Joe.   Where have I been? What have I been doing? Not much, but so much at the same time.   Lets seequick recap:  Halloween was kind of a bust.  We ended up going to that house party and dying there.  We were there for hours and went home afterwards.  It was one of those nights where Paul got wasted and caused 137 problems.  We actually had to pull him from the apartment, as he was about to get into a fistfight for calling a friend of ours a cunt.  Yeah, I was really proud of him that night.   Also, there was the guy that when introduced to Paul and I responded with Faggots!  How you doing?   Here is how the conversation actually happened.    Mariah:  John, I want you to meet my friends Paul and Joe. John:  Faggots!  How you doing? Joe:  WHAAAAAAAAAA?!?! Paul:  What the fuck did you just say? Mariah:  Johns gay too, he didnt mean John:  Chill out.  Were all a bunch of faggots. Paul:  You smell like shit.  Did you just shit yourself?  It smells like shit now. Joe:  Oh God, here we go John:  What are you talking about? Paul:  YOU SMELL LIKE SHIT!  Shit smelling John!  At that point I walked away to let Paul and John finish their retorts.  Mariah apologized profusely for Johns comments.  All I could say was Who SAYS something like that?  I was legitimately shocked.  And that was Halloween.  Since then I havent done much beside hang out with people I havent had the chance to see.  Work has been a beastmaster and Ive been a little down without having a show to work on.  That will change, but not soon enough.  The Theatre Company has made the decision to throw an AIDS benefit in December.  I will be performing a monologue and a scene at the cabaret portion of the event.  On Tuesday I plan to sit down with the company and discuss my future role as an active member.  I hope to get as involved as possible.  In other news, I am throwing a  urlLink Murder Mystery Party !  I have mailed out the invitations and am excited to be the host of this event.  So far people seem really pumped about it.  Now I just have to figure out what to serve for dinner!  Ive become a raging huge fan of the new  urlLink Real World/Road Rules Challenge - The Gauntlet .  I have also become somewhat addicted to  urlLink Rich Girls  as well.  Something is clearly wrong with the way I choose to live my life.  I havent talked to my brother since mid-September.  He has called twice and I missed him twice.  His birthday is at the end of the month and Im starting to get those I cant deal with him being gone anymore feelings.  Its making me hecka sad.    I have asked Paul to spend Christmas with my family.  Although his relationship with his own family pretty much resembles shit on toast, he still feels as though he should be at his parents house for the holiday.  He is making a concerted effort to be a part of my Christmas though.  The plan is that he will come for Christmas Eve and leave early Christmas morning to go see his family.  It would mean the world to me if he were at my house for the holiday.  It will make it slightly less lonely since Winfield will be gone.    This weekend I plan to spend as little money as possible.  Thats really my only goal.  Im kinda broke right now and I need to start saving my money for Christmas presents!  Or bags of pot for myself!  Ora big fat steak that I can shove into my mouth right now.    Im veddy hungwey.    Have a great weekend and make sure to look both ways before diving into a vagina.

      Christmas has come and gone.  I couldnt be more relieved.  This year the holidays have been extremely difficult for my family.  I think we all just went through the motions of opening presents and engaging in past traditions because we felt like we had to.  As much as I tried to keep my positive attitude, 4 days in Albany definitely stripped that out of me.  My parents, as usual, went overboard with the presents and I walked away with (basically) a new entertainment system.  Dvd Player, bigger television, Cd burner, Playstation 2, etc.  I was overwhelmed and really excited.  Other than that, this Christmas is one I would prefer to never revisit.  New Years is this week and I must say that I am dreading that as well.    Maybe its because I have had a horrible month, or maybe its because my life is need of some major changes, but either way, I hate everyone and everything right now.    During the month of December, my friends have managed to turn my life upside down.    I hate fighting with my friends and will usually try to do whatever I can to fix the situation so that we can all be a tight knit group again.  But this time around, I feel like I have no group.  The group has turned into something I dont like and worse, something I dont feel comfortable in.    My closest friends in NYC are Angie, Kelly, and Mariah.  In December I found out some secrets that they were keeping from me; secrets that were hurtful and did major damage to my trust in them.  I thought that I would be able to get over it with time and that I would chalk this ugly situation up to a growing pain that a group of friends goes through.  But it seems like as time goes by, I become increasingly more angry and upset.  Its almost to the point where I feel as though I want to pull away from the group entirely and make all new friends.    These feelings are all very new to me.  I have had girl friends my whole life, but Ive never felt so hurt and betrayed by any of them as I do now.  Ive never felt so lonely, so out of the loop, and so angry.  I can honestly say that I have gone overboard in making sure that these three ladies were happy and comfortable and included in everything that I was lucky to be a part of.      The problem here is that my close friends are all lesbians.  They can go out to the bars with each other and have the time of their lives.  Unfortunately for me, the lone gay man in our group, they are not nearly as interested in going out to the places that I would prefer.  Its not that they WONT go out with me, cuz they will.  But if I dont organize the outing, it wont happen.  Yet, they dont need me to organize a lesbian night out.  That they can do completely on their own.    I cant seem to come up with a solution to the way I feel.    I have had numerous talks with Kelly that I thought were really positive.  Unfortunately, none of them has changed the way that I feel towards her right now.  I dont like who she is dating  (Pauls dud of a roommate Jen) and until I can either get over it or accept it, I dont see how I can be around her.  At least, not around her at Pauls apartment.  I dont like that she is there without me, yet I cant be there when shes there, cuz I just know I will lose my temper.  I tend to be very guarded about places and relationships that I have claimed as my own.  Its a very immature trait that I have, although it never usually comes to the surface.  Now, with Kelly dating Jen, its on the surface of my skin every day and I find myself spending most of my free time angry and irritated.  Dont get me wrongI love Kelly.  She is one of my best friends and always will be, but until her and Jen break up, I dont want her at Pauls apartment.  I just dont.  Its selfish and close-minded of me and unfortunately, nothing she can say will change the way I feel.  Kelly and I have had a rough month together  A month that has left me wondering who she has become.  It seemed to happen over night, but here it isthe new Kelly.  And sadly, its a Kelly that I feel has hurt me very deeply.  I am almost nervous to talk to her everyday, for fear that she is going to throw yet another curb ball in my direction that is going to push me over the deep end once and for all.    But, if you cant talk about something and fix it, how do you move forward?  This is not the way to have a best friendship.  But this is where we are right now.  I guess the main reason why I am so frustrated is because no matter how many talks I have with these girls about the way I feel, I still walk away angry and hurt.  Sometimes worse than before the talks.    Where is Calgon when really you need it?

       Addenda   I must be doing SOMETHING right.  Or wrong.  Or...ugh.  Today I have spoken (at great lengths) with the following people:  Paul - My boyfriend Michael - the guy I met over Thanksgiving Brad - a guy that I used to date back in 1999. and the clincher:  Ahmad!  Ahmad just called me to tell me that he is finally over me and willing to be friends.  I haven't spoken to him since he cut me off back in August.  Remember the story?  He was in love with me and was no longer interested in just being friends.    Well, well, well...look who came around?  I told him that I am "apprehensive" to talk to him again and that it will take some time before I feel as though I could be a part of his life.  He understood, but informed me that he misses me and would like to have me in whatever capacity I could allow.    Truth is, I am not interested in Ahmad anymore.  That whole situation gave me agida for months.  But friends?  Maybe down the road.  I gotta process this whole thing first.  Okay, one question.  Am I an uber stud?   Or  Am I a love hatin playa that gets his kicks off of making other boys love him?  Probably the second one.  But...ahhhhhhhhhh!    How did all this happen?  I need to go home for Christmas now and think about all of this.  You know, if I were single, this situation would be something that I would revel in.  But since I am not single, I just feel ugly and guilty.    Just have to remind myself that everything happens for a reason.

      (I don't understand why...but I couldn't get rid of all of the weird little symbols in this post.  Consider it a Christmas/Chanukah present!)  At last!   The 3 Weeks of Chaos  is finally over!  What an incredibly awful and wonderful time period it was.    Lets briefly recap.  Shall we?  1) My hamsters are still alive and running around although Jimbo has one foot thats dangling by a tendon.   2) One of my co-workers is leaving our office at the end of the month and I have been inundated with so much extra work, my brain is completely fried.    3) I took Kelly to see the  The Ricki Lake Show  on her birthday.  It was the thrill of my life.  On top of having an amazing time while watching the taping, I yawned at one point and Ricki points at me and says Hey you!  Wake up!?  It made my whole life.  (yes, I will tell you when the airing of the episode will be) 4) After seeing RICKI, Kelly, Angie and I went to eat at a restaurant in the area.  We were the only people in the restaurant except for this guy sitting by the window.  When he got up to pay his bill, he walked by our table and I notice that it is Ethan Hawke!  UM!  He walked over to us, talked for a bit and then Kelly shmoozed her way into getting her picture taken with him.  It was hecka fun. 5) With all of the money I spent this month, I somehow came up with enough to buy everyone presents, send out 30 Christmas cards, and make 100 cookies to give to people in my office.  My budgeting skills impress even Donald of the Trumps. 6) Had a huge fight with my friends that is just now being worked out.  Picture it as a complete upheaval of everything that is understandable and acceptable in the world.  I basically lost my mind and am just now picking up my gay marbles. 7) My family got word that my brother could be home for two weeks in January!  God willing. 8) Developed a weird rash on certain parts of my body.  Finally healing!  My skin is so uber sensitive.  It makes me feel sad inside. 9) Had an amazing month with Paul.  Also had an amazing month with a guy that I am talking to online.  Met him in Albany over Thanksgiving and have yet to give him up.  Ah the life of being 26. 10) Saw an amazing one-man show,  Addicted , thanks to my dear, generous friend  urlLink Kambri Crews ! 11) Saw a guy have a seizure in the subway. 12) Ate about a hundred bags of CHEWY SPREES.  YEM!!!  And now it is time for all of this to come to a close.  With the New Year comes a fresh beginning.  I am going to make the best resolutions list ever.  I will post it as soon as its done.  This year, I am resolved to at least TRY to keep my resolutions.    For Christmas, my parents have decided that it would be in our best interest to go out to dinner and to a movie.  They think that doing things differently this year will make the holiday go more smoothly since my brother will be in Baghdad.  Its the first Christmas where we will not be all together as a family.  It is extremely upsetting, but we will do our best to make it work.  Im just going to feel like such a dumb ass opening up all my presents on Christmas morning, while everyone just stares at me.  And what if I dont like something?  I wont have my brother there to make fun of it with me.  Ah well.  As I did on Thanksgiving, I will go home with a positive attitude and do my best to save Christmas.  I am excited to see my parents, to open my presents, to eat Japanese food for dinner instead of roast beast.  I cant wait to sit around the Christmas tree and to listen to Christmas music.    Paul is actually driving me home tonight.  He is going to spend the evening with me at my house in Albany.  Its pretty sweet of him and I am very much looking forward to being with him tonight.  We have been spending so much time together as of late and I am very happy with our current relationship status.  Who knows what the New Year will bring, but 2003 is definitely ending with us a good note.    So thats it.  I hope everyone has a beautiful Christmas!   Enjoy it to the fullest.    Be with family, be with friends, be with lovers.    But most importantly, Be happy.  Much love.

      I have a few extra minutes right now.  Minutes that I didn't think I would have.    So, tomorrow is Kelly's bday.  I have planned the entire thing.  Right down to the second.  I know she is excited and so am I.  It's going to be a great day.  My nose is all sorts of jammed up.  It's leaking fluid all over my tits and ass.  It's driving me up the fucking wall.  My boss just handed me an  Allegra .  Snoresville.  I want something stronger than that shit.  Anyone got some Valium?  Last night, while at my apartment, Paul picked up the phone at the most inopportune moment.  The guy that I had the date with during Thanksgiving was calling me and instead of reaching me, he got Paul.  Before Paul could give him a piece of his mind, this dude hung up on him.  LAME!  Problem is, this kid calls me at LEAST 3 times a day.  He will NOT leave me alone.  No matter how rude I am to him.  Probably going to keep calling me until I move out of my apartment.  Luckily that happens in March, so not too far off.    Ah geez.  Okay, my free minutes are gone now.   Latas.

       In keeping with the tradition of the 3 Weeks of Chaos   Here is how my day has gone:  Spent a good portion of the morning fighting with my friends.  Its been a rough go as of late and there doesnt seem to be a reprieve in sight.  All I can hope for is  Christmas understanding  from everyone in my life.  While I was on the phone with my friend Mariah,  urlLink Ari  reaches over to me, with tears in her eyes and asks me to get off the phone.  As I go to tell her to hold on for a second, she doubles over in horrible pain and loses it completely.  I immediately get up and ask her if shes ok.  All she could do was shake her head no.  I ran to get my boss and we decided that it was best that we call 911.    I had never made a call like that in my life and needless to say it was pretty terrifying.  Ari was moved into one of my co-workers office to wait for the ambulance to arrive.  Within 15 minutes, 3 paramedics and 2 police officers showed up.  They asked Ari a barrage of questions and then decided that it was best to move her to the emergency room.  I collected our stuff and we both piled into the ambulance, me up front, her in the back with the paramedics.    Instead of going right to the hospital, the technicians decided to do an EKG reading and give her an IV.  On top of being scared to death, she was forced to deal with the pain of getting poked and prodded with various needles.  As she cried, I started to cry in the front seat.  There is nothing more heartbreaking than going through an experience like this with one of your closest friends.  And there was nothing I could do to make it better for her.    Eventually we arrived at the hospital and the nurses took some readings and moved her into a room.  I made a bunch of phone calls for her and then sat and talked with her on her bed until both her mother and brother arrived.  While it saddened me to have to leave her, I thought it best that she be with her family.  I didnt want to be in the way.    As of right now, we are still unsure as to what caused this reaction inside Aris chest.  It is possible that she had an allergic reaction to the medicine she is taking for her asthmatic bronchitis.  The doctors were running tests and asking her all sorts of questions when I left.  I am sure she will be fine, but its the not knowing that scares me.  All I can do is pray.   While I was sitting with Ari, waiting for her mom, we both got to have a good laugh.  The woman (a 280# black woman) was passed out next to her on a gurney.  During our stay in the emergency room, her gown slowly crept up to the point that her big black bush was exposed.  Ari kept saying Look at that Joe!  And I would fall for it every time.  My eyes glued to the bush of doom.    I am always in awe at how strong Ari is as a person.  She has constant humor about everything, even while being led away in a stretcher.  She is an inspiration to me.  When things go wrong, she has such a positive attitude.  Thats why it hurt me so badly to hear her crying in the ambulance.  It must have been overwhelming for her to cry.  And for that, it makes me cry.    Please keep her in your prayers and I will do the same.    She will get better.  Its just scary for right now.

       Quick update on Hamster Jim and Hamster Kim   Things arent going so well for my deal little boy Jim.    Last night I went home and played with him for a little while.  The cut on his back leg has turned into a full out hole now.  I can see his intestines I think.  The wound itself smelled like fucking garbage and I gagged at least 3 times while I cleaned it.  I held him for awhile and then I allowed him to run around my room.  His energy level is where it should be, but one of his back legs has curled itself up into his body.  He is essentially walking around on three legs.    After he had worn himself out, I put him back in his cage and he immediately went back to bed.  He is eating and drinking, but I fear that he wont survive for that much longer.  My dad thinks I should drown him or suffocate him to ease his suffering.  But the idea of that makes my skin crawl and my heart go into my throat.  Unfortunately for Jim, he is just going to have to ride this one out.  And I am not totally convinced that, minus the gaping hole in his back, he is in that much pain.  He is handling this whole ordeal like quite a trooper.  I just feel bad that I allowed this to happen.  I adopted him from the pet store and then, due to my ignorance of raising hamsters, allowed Kimberly to rip his face off.  I have learned my lesson, although maybe a moment too late.    Kimberly is doing just fine in her new cage.  I think she hates me though.  She wont come near my hand when I put it in her cage and she hides when she sees me coming.  If I am patient, she will eventually crawl into my hand, but I think she carries a lot of resentment.  But honestly?  Tough.  She hurt my little Jimbo.  So too bad that she is lonely in her new cage.  Thats it for now.    Taking it day by day.

       Reasons Why I am Going Out of My Gay Mind:   My job is slamming me with end of the year bullshit.    My boyfriend is becoming wonderful, essentially out of nowhere.  My friends and I have been fighting with eachother for the past 3 days.  I have the opportunity, thanks to  urlLink Kambri Crews , to see two shows for FREE this week.  But I also have tons of meetings/social activities to go to and am unsure if I wll make it to either of them.  (Why does it seem like you can never do what you WANT to do?)  I have a HUGE zit on my forehead.  When that goes away, there are seven others vying for my attention.    I have YET to think about Christmas, as well as Christmas shopping.  I have to memorize monologues and work on the Theater benefit for January.  I have to see the people I have neglected over the last two months.  I have a birthday event to plan.  There is a guy that likes me that is hounding me at every turn.  I need to pay my bills.  I need to flier the Columbia University campus for the Theatre Company.   I need to CREATE the flier in order to, well, flier the Columbia University campus.  I need to clean my apartment.  I have to save money.  I need to keep up with this journal.  I need to write back to emails that are dying in my inbox.  I have to do my laundry.  I feel like I could cry today.  I need to mail my brother something for Christmas, although it will surely get there much after the holiday, now that I have put it off to the last minute.  I have to plan for a Murder Mystery Party that had been postponed.  I am so tired.  That is it for now.    God, I could die from exhaustion and stress.  But not until I complete this list!  Ardios.

      It is officially the  3 Weeks of Chaos !    Breathe it in deep and welcome it in with open arms.    You see, when I was in college, my housemates and I came up with this theory called the  3 Weeks of Chaos .  It is the one time period of the year when everything seems to hit the fan.  If you think back to the days of yore, or at least as far back as college, you will remember that the time period between Thanksgiving and Christmas was always incredibly hectic.  There were term papers to write, exams to study for, parties to attend, and professors ready and willing to use their red pen in a flourish of pure evil.    When I was in school, we would keep track of the different events that would take place during the  3 Weeks of Chaos , so that we could look back in January and marvel at how lucky we were to have survived.  There were times when relatives would die or boyfriends would break up with girlfriends; times when the local bar would burn down or someone would eat some rotten sushi and end up in the hospital for a week.  Not that this stuff wouldnt normally happen during the yearit would.  But imagine it all happening at the SAME time and there youve got the theory behind the  3 Weeks of Chaos .      There were also times when strange and mysterious things would happen.  For example, how did a handful of my laundry end up on our crazy, child killing, neighbors lawn?  You should have seen my face when I came home to THAT little surprise.    Things arent always BAD during the  3 Weeks of Chaos .  Sometimes they are really good.  Like I would find $45 on the ground and it would be mine!  Or I would finally convince the buffed up straight dude that Im chilling with to take off his shirt and make out with me.  And only during the  3 weeks of chaos  would he do such a thing.  And yeah, it was good.    So here we are.  Another year has gone by and the chaos of the end is in full bloom.  It makes perfect sense that I would see someone have a seizure on Tuesday and that my hamsters would be close to death.  It also makes sense that I have met a new boy and am still struggling to keep the old boy that I have been with for 4 years.  Surely my job is hectic and my friends are bouncing off the wall with the excitement of the holiday season.    But what is truly in store during this  3 Weeks of Chaos ?  There is no way to know, but it can be expected to be a whirlwind of messy misfortune and marvelous memories.

       The bloodlust of Kim vs. The lovelust of Jim   Over two months ago Kelly and I discovered two hamsters abandoned in front of our apartment.  Our hearts grew to the size of watermelons and we immediately rescued them and gave them a new home in my bedroom.  Although both were male hamsters, I named one Kimberly and one Neechee.  The two hamsters lived happily in their aquarium until the day that I left the top off of the cage.  During the night, Neechee escaped and was part of a tragic accident involving a box fan.  He bled to death on my rug.  I immediately went out to a pet store and bought myself a new hamster.  He looked exactly like Neechee, yet I decided to name him Jim.  The dude at the pet store warned me that the hamster that lives in the cage would most likely resent having a new hamster invade the dwelling.  I felt so horrible about the death of Neechee that I went against his better judgement and purchased the little guy anyway.    The second I introduced Jim to Kimberly, a fight broke out.  Kimberly attacked Jim and threw his sad little body all around the cage.  It scared me at first and I did everything in my power to separate them whenever they started fighting.  I did this for almost two months successfully.  When I wasnt at home, I am sure that they beat the shit out of each other, but I wasnt there to see it, so it was easy to convince myself that it wasnt happening.    The day before Thanksgiving, I found Jim and Kimberly snuggled up together in the corner of their cage.  It warmed my heart and gave me hopes about their future.  I gave them some Thanksgiving treats and went home to Albany.  Upon my return to NYC, I found Jims body torn about by claw marks.  Kimberly must have spent the three days I was gone beating the fuck out of the poor little guy.  The saddest part of the whole situation? Jim never fights back. All he does is sit there and put his hands up, eyes pleading for Kimberly to leave him alone.  His mild mannered attitude just infuriated her more.    I was so sad by what I found, that I decided it was best to separate them for good.  My parents were visiting, so they helped me to fashion a barrier inside the cage, making it impossible for them to get at each other.  Wouldnt you know it?  They banged on the cage for hours, Jim doing his best to keep Kimberly on her own side.  Late that night, I went to Pauls and didnt return for two days.  While I was gone, Kelly noticed that Kimberly had figured out a way to get to Jim.  She created a new barrier and hoped that this would keep them away from each other.  It didnt work.  Last night I went home to find Jims entire backside swollen and bleeding.  Kimberly beat him so bad that Jim laid there gasping for breath.  With tears in my eyes and anger at myself for being such an irresponsible parent, I separated them.  Kelly arrived at home about a half an hour after I did.  She and I worked together to make Kimberly a brand new home.  Now, they live in separate cages and are seemingly very happy.  Well, Jim is happy.  Kimberly is furious that she has no one to beat up.  That bitch has got bloodlust like I have never seen.  And Jimmy poor, sweet, little guy, Jimhe has lovelust like I have never seen.  All he wants is to be kissed and pet.    And all I want more than anything is for him to survive.    And at this point, I am not sure he will.

      What a day it has been!  My morning started on a horrible note.    I was waiting for the subway in Times Square, when suddenly a young man standing near me started convulsing and fell to the ground.  He landed inches away from the subway tracks and to my horror, he landed directly on his face.  People started to back away from him and I heard a few people shout for an ambulance.  I stared at this man and watched blood ooze from the side of his head and thenhe began to pee himself.    At first I was just scared that this was happening in front of me.  I didnt know what to do or how to help.  Immediately some policemen ran over to him and made everyone back away.  I heard one of the cops say He has a medic alert bracelet on.  The man just laid there, blood and urine surrounding his body.  After a minute or two, the man began to wake up and he tried to stand.  The cops helped him to his feet and I heard him say that he had to go.  His entire head was scraped and bleeding and the front of his pants were soaking wet.  A second or two later, paramedics arrived and had him lay down on a stretcher.  I, along with a crowd of people watched as they began to carry him out of the station.  Tears filled my eyes and I boarded the next train.  When I got to work, I was pretty shaken up.  I called my mom immediately to tell her what happened.  Unfortunately she wasnt there, so I decided to go outside to calm myself down.  When I returned to my desk, the phone rang and I relayed the story to my mom.  I was crying and explained that I was most upset because the scene reminded me of my friend, Rita, who has been known to pass out due to epilepsy-type seizures.  I couldnt stop thinking that it could have been her.  It brings me to tears even as I write this.  When I was finished telling her what happened, my mom said I have news that may cheer you up.  She then began to tell me that my brother, Winfield, got word that he could be coming home in January for a visit!  Now, nothing is definite yet, and the ARMY has a way of saying one thing and doing another, but this is the news that all of us have been waiting for!  From what my mom said, my brother should get two weeks off in mid-January to come home to the States.  After his visit is over, he will have to return to Baghdad until the end of April, early May.    My parents are bouncing off the walls and deep down that is how I feel too.  I am trying to stay realistic about it and not get my hopes up.  But if he really could come homeit would make all of us feel so much better.  We need the pick me up, especially during the holiday season.    So keep your fingers crossed and the prayers coming.  Winfield may be coming home in January!!  Other than that urlLink Ari  is out sick with Acute bronchitis and some sort of asthma related illness.  I feel horrible for her.  And also horrible for myself.  The other Administrative Assistant, Michelle, called out today too and I have been not only doing my own work, but both of their work as well.  Ari, I can understand and feel grateful that I can cover for her.  Michelle of doomwellMichelle of doom is taking the number one slot on my shit list.  Come to work sometimes why dont you?  Lastly, Paul and I had a very honest and open talk about us.  Afterwards, I felt so much better about a lot of the issues that we are dealing with.  Truth is, no matter how much I get hurt or feel slighted by him, I am seriously in love with the kid.  I want to be his rock, his best friend, and his lover.  I want to be his boy.  Its confusing and frustrating, and sometimes, its wonderful.  But either way, its a journey that I am happy to be taking.    After our talk, Paul gave me a gift, which NEVER happens.  It was a $120 outfit that he bought for me during his day off.  I opened the boxes to find a pair of beautiful slacks and a very hip button down shirt.  I tried both on and unfortunately, Paul thinks that I have the biggest ass on the planet.  (size 36 waist?!?!  Since WHEN?!?!)  The pants are fly and I am going to exchange them for the appropriate size when we go to the store this weekend.  The card he wrote to accompany the present was the best part of the whole gift.  I will save it forever.  Other than that, the guy I hung out with this weekend sent me flowers.  I had to write him an email this morning explaining that while I love the flowers and the thought that went into it, I am still involved in a relationship that I want to be in.  Mark doesnt want to get mixed up with me.  There is nothing but hurt waiting for him at the end of this whole thing.  He hasnt written me back since.    Ah well  What a day, huh

      And back to work.  Cept now I think I weigh at least 15 pounds more than I did before I left to go home.  Luckily the weekend went pretty smoothly.  My family did their best to keep a positive attitude despite the fact that my brother was unable to be home for the holiday.  My mom only broke into tears twice at dinner and my dad only lost it once.   I was really proud of both of them.  I was the rock, though.  I refused to cry at any moment and when I felt the wave of sadness start to take over, I did whatever I could to block the whole thing out of my mind.  By doing this, I was able to get through the weekend with a smile on my face.    My brother did call us from Baghdad on Thanksgiving evening.  It was incredibly special for the four of us to be on the phone during the conversation.  It was the one time during the holiday when we were all together.  Thank God for that.  He sounded pretty upbeat on the phone and it sounded as though he had a more comprehensive dinner then we had.  So, at least he didnt miss out.  Even if he did have to eat the meal with a bunch of hardcore military boys.  (kind of sounds like my fantasy)  I did end up going out on Wednesday night and wouldnt you know itran into a guy that I dated awhile back.  He looked amazing.  His name is Mark and he is about 6 tall and 200#.  Totally my type.  We talked a bit outside the bar and since he arrived sober, I asked him if he would take Kelly and I home, considering that it was 2am.  He took us back to my house and he and I stayed up until about 4am, talking.  And kissing.  Oops.  Yeah, I kissed him a couple times.  I mean how could I not?  Hes a BIG boy.  And my day to day boyfriend doesnt kiss me that often.  You understand.  Friday night, Mark took me out to dinner.  We had great conversation and I got the chance to get to know him a bit better.  Afterwards, he drove me (in his truckhot) back to his house in Greenbush and we stayed up talking for most of the night.  The rest of the night was spent with me in his arms.  Minimal kissing, but lots of cuddling.  It was nice and I really enjoyed having a big guy wrap his arms around me.  However, when I woke up on Saturday morning, I remembered that I have a 4-year anniversary looming with Paul.  I jumped out of bed and made him drive me home immediately.  As always, I am confused.    Paul and I are doing very well together.  As friends.  Breaking up doesnt seem to be an option at the moment.  I dont think I will ever be ready to break up with him.  I know we wont be able to be friends and Im just not ready to lose him yet.  Everyone is encouraging me to be strong and has offered to stand by my side, should I choose to make the decision to become single.  However, Im just not ready.  And I need everyone to have patience with me.  4 years is a LONG time to be in a relationship.  And its damn near impossible to just end it.  (big sigh)  Mark and I have been emailing this morning.  I figured that there is no harm in keeping in touch with him.  As long as he doesnt get too wrapped up in the idea of us.  As much as I love the way he feels, the last thing I want is a new boyfriend.    And there is one more thing  Just a little catch.  Last time I was with Mark, he fucked up big time.  We ended up hooking up together and things didnt really go according to plan.  Its a long story and it ends very nastily.  Maybe someday I will have the guts to write about it in here.  But until then, just understand that this boy will not be going down on me any time soon.  Heh heh heh.  Cept he wont be.  Happy Monday!

       Yes I really DO live here   If you saw last nights  The Apprentice , you should know that you were staring into my backyard.  I live in the heart of Times Square.  Every landmark that you saw in that area I can see from my apartment.  I have never lived in any place that has allowed me to see whats going on outside by just turning on the television.  When TRL is on, I can tell if its raining or snowing or how crowded the streets outside my apartment are just by watching MTV.  Its strange and wonderful all at the same time.  (and for the record NOBODY who is ANYBODY eats at  Planet Hollywood .  Fucking terrible food and WAY overpriced)  As I saw the contestants on  The Apprentice  running around the TKTS booth and in and out of  Planet Hollywood , I kept thinking, I can be there in five minutes.  WEIRD.  Luckily for me, my apartment is on the inside portion of a high-rise.  There is no noise in my place and no blinding lights.  Conversely theres no sunlight either.  Its kind of like living in a cave, only its a cave that smells like Chinese food.  Thank you to  Johns Shanghai  restaurant for cooking soba noodles at 7am.  Kelly and I are making arrangements to move OUT of Times Square on March 1st.  Our lease is up and it is time for us to move to an area of NYC that doesnt cater to tourists.  You cant IMAGINE how annoying it is to have to weave your way through hundreds of people taking pictures.  While I am glad that you are spending money in my city, I am a little too busy at this point to stop and organize a group photo op.  And also, if one more person stops dead in their tracks to stare at the colorful billboards and tall buildings, thus causing me to collide into their backs, I will probably scream bloody fucking murder.    Yeah, its time to move out of Times Square.  Its been a trip though.  A 2 liter bottle of soda costs $3.52.  The McDonalds across the street from my pad sells the two cheeseburger meal for $8.50.  If you want a turkey sandwich from  The Roxy  deli, take out a small loan.  They sell it for $24.  And no, you dont get fries with that.  I cant wait for the day when I can walk to the laundry mat without having to barrel over small children and groups of Asians.  I cant wait for the day when I dont have to hear Free comedy show tonight at 7 and 11!  Or Jenna Jamison is showing off her cunt and tits during $50 lap dances at Flashdancer!  Or my favorite 35 t-shirts for $10!  Cuz who DOESNT need 35 t-shirts that say I heart NY?  Kelly and I currently spend $900 EACH on our apartment.  Two bedrooms for $1800 and its the size of a huge walk in closet.  Its not like we are going to spend less money on our apartment, but we definitely would like some more space and a more tolerable neighborhood.  While it was cool to spend a year in the heart of the greatest city in the world, I think she and I are both itching to get the fuck out.    So next time you see a picture of Times Square, stop and think how cool it is that Joe lives there and how fortunate you are for not.  Have great weekends.  Ill give Rita love from all of you.

       Why is it that every time I try to come up with a title to my entry, I always think The Truth about Cats and Dogs over and over in my head?   Obviously this entry isnt going to be anything related to cats and dogs.  Its just so weird that every time I create a title, I literally think The Truth about Cats and Dogs.  My mind is being fucking wasted on pot and booze and endless hours playing with my cat and dog.  Sike.  I have hamsters you ballsac.  Lets just hope this entry goes in a more focused direction from here on in.  I have the most gigantic lip zit today.  It is red and bulbous and looks as though it contains my new baby inside.  The worst part?  The lip zit I had on Monday is on the other side of my mouth and is in scar mode.  Does anyone want to hire an actor that has lip zit scars all over their mouth?  If you do, send me an email.  Unfortunately, this amount of beauty cant last forever.  Drink my cum.  Sothis weekend Rita comes to town.  I couldnt be more elated.  I havent seen her since October and that is way too long.  2 or 3 weekends ago, I actually called her at 10pm on a Friday night and sobbed on her voicemail about how much it sucks to have her so far away.  She called me back immediately and we just fell in love all over again.  We decided that a trip was absolutely necessary and that leads us to this weekend.    I know we have two whole days together, but its never enough time and when she leaves on Sunday, part of my heart will be ripped out and force fed down my own gullet.  Which is probably for the best since Im gonna need that heart in the long run.    As spring looms round the corner, so does Ritas marriage to her fianc, Drew.  A day that I had hoped would never come.  I mean, of course I want her to have a family and get married and of course I ultimately want nothing else for her than happinessbutbut its hard and a big change and shes my best friend and I wish there was a way for she and I to fall in hetero love and get married ourselves.  She is the last link I have to the hetero worldat least as far as thinking I may still be straight.    At 26 years old, Im not only positive Im gay, Im relieved.  I mean, who wants to go through 20 years of being called a fag just to find out at the end of the road, that you really were straight?  Talk about a fucked up life and a sad state of affairs.  But with Rita, there was always that chance that we would really end up together.  We are literal peas in a pod.  We are THE perfect balance.  If there was no such thing as vaginal/penile sex, we would have the quintessential love relationship.  It would be nothing short of wonderfulness.    But instead, I have to accept the fact that not only is Rita a women, shes not a bodybuilder.  And we know how I feel about the bodybuilders.  I am so proud to be able to be in her wedding as a groomsman and to stand by her side throughout this entire process.  She will need me the most of everyone and I will want to be needed just as much.  If there was a way to give someone your heart, Rita would have had mine long ago.  Okay, I dont know where all of this has come from, but here it is.  And I do feel a little bit more at ease about this whole situation, having written some of it down.  Expect more posts like this in the next couple of months.    Ultimately, I am SO excited for her and for the changes this wedding is going to bring into both her and my life.  She will eventually have a baby (that I will steal) and she will have a house and a picket fence (which shell probably make me paint) and so many shit filled diapers that I will laugh and laugh and laugh.  Pausing only to pop my lip zits.  Ritas plane comes in at 6:05pm on Friday.    I will be waiting there with tears in my eyes.

       Lying  not down, through your teeth   As I was falling asleep last night and saying my nightly prayers, I came up with a very interesting idea for an experiment.  It occurred to me that I am one HUGE liar.  Sometimes I wonder if anything I say is true at all because I am so used to spilling out nonsense from my mouth.  I am not a liar in a bad way.  Its not like I sit around trying to come up with grandiose stories to make myself look cool or to try and get under someones skin.  Instead, I tell Caucasian lies.  You know, little ones.  Ones that will either get me out of trouble or spare the feelings of a friend of mine.  But I do it often.  Pretty much in every conversation I have throughout the day.  Maybe its because Im too scared to offend people with what I really think.  Or maybe its because Im nervous being myself.  Im pretty sure its the former and not the latter, but without an experiment, how would I ever know?  So I have decidedI am going to pick a day (Lets say Monday, February 2nd) and spend it telling the truth.  When asked if I like your skirt, I very well may say Nah, its boring.  When asked if I would like to spend the evening volunteering at a soup kitchen, I will probably respond with The only soup kitchen I work in is my own.   If you are sucking my dick and I find myself unable to cum, instead of saying Its not you, its me, I will say Youre a bad blow and youre unattractive.  Get your mouth off my dick now.  As you can see I will be honest to a fault.  I think it will be interesting to see how my friends react to my new attitude as well as the general public.  Its said that most people prefer honesty as opposed to bold faced lies.  But I have a hard time believing thats true.  Now is the time to test this theory.  So beware!  On Tuesday February 3rd, I am going to conduct a similar experiment, but with a slightly different twist.  I am going to keep track of how many times I lie throughout the day.  I will carry a pen and a piece of paper with me and every time I lie to someone, I will make a slash on the paper.  At the end of the day I will tally my results and figure out what kind of a liar I really am.  If its more than 30 lies, Im going to shave my nuts and eat it.  You know, as punishment.  Thats what God would want.  Check out this page on Wednesday, February 4th for the results to both of these experiments.     MTV and ME   As most of you know, I am a huge MTV junkie.  I have been known to leave work on a Friday, go home and turn on MTV and leave it on that channel until work begins at 9am on Monday morning.  I can pretty much quote every line of each reality series and if you want to know ANYTHING about  The Real World  or  Road Rules , I am your man.    Well, as of the last couple installments of  The Real World  I have been very disappointed with the casting.  All Ive seen is a bunch of sluts and jugheads who couldnt carry on an interesting conversation to save their lives.  But nowbehold  urlLink San Diego !  I am so desperate for a decent  Real World  season that I am allowing these new 7 Strangers to live in my house regardless of the amount of drinking and sex that is sure to come with it.  Last nights episode was excellent and I find myself falling in love with these people.    BUTthe coup de resistance is surely  urlLink The Gauntlet .  It is BY FAR my favorite program on television.  The show pits the two series against each other in numerous physical and mental competitions.  The teams are comprised of past  Real World  and  Road Rules  stars.  If you watch the series as regularly as I do, you begin to really know these people.  You take sides in their petty fights and you cry when some of them get voted off and have to go home.    I have loved this competition for years, but MTV has now done something that has made me jizz bomb.    After The Gauntlet competition ended last Monday, I was disappointed to find out that there would be no reunion special.  Instead, this Monday, MTV aired a show called Behind the scenes of the Gauntlet.  They discussed every fight and every hook up that happened throughout the whole season.  And talk about candid.  Ive never seen a group of people attack each other so viciously.  It was fucking brilliant.  The best part?     urlLink The Real World/Road Rules Inferno  begins next Monday with some new characters and some old ones from The Gauntlet.  Tempers are already flared, egos wounded, skin fragile.  Its going to be a bear.  And I cannot wait.    If you get the chance, try to tune in to MTV at 10pm on Monday nights.  The new season starts this week and you will be SO happy that you joined on.  Talk about guilty pleasures.  And kudos to MTV for always broadcasting quality and cutting edge entertainment.  Theyve had a few slip ups, but overall, I am dedicated to their station.    Bring on the fights and bring on the fun!    I will make a bucket of popcorn and meet you on the couch.

       OUCH!  My Skin Done Hurt   Yesterday after work I went to the dermatologist to get a few things checked out.  I was not pleased with the result of the visit.  First off, she didnt get to my appointment until 45 minutes after it was scheduled.  Then she rushed me through the whole visit and I didnt get a chance to ask her some of the questions I wanted to ask.  It was very frustrating.  Other than that, this is what I have been diagnosed with:   Seborrheic Dermatitis    Seborrheic dermatitis is a common skin disorder that can be easily treated. This condition is a red, scaly, itchy rash most commonly seen on the scalp, sides of the nose, eyebrows, eyelids, skin behind the ears, and middle of the chest. Other areas, such as the navel (belly button), buttocks, skin folds under the arms, axillary regions, breasts, and groin, may also be involved.    This is exactly what I have.  Not including the chest, breasts, or buttocks.  But I do have it on my groin and it makes me embarracksed.  With the cream I have been using, it has kept it under control, but there is no cure.     Psoriasis    Psoriasis (sore-I-ah-sis) is a common immune-mediated chronic skin disease that comes in different forms and varying levels of severity. Most researchers now conclude that it is related to the immune system (psoriasis is often called an "immune-mediated" disorder).  It is not contagious. In general, it is a condition that is frequently found on the knees, elbows, scalp, hands, feet or lower back. Many treatments are available to help manage its symptoms. More than 4.5 million adults in the United States have it.   Between 10 percent and 30 percent of people with psoriasis also develop a related form of arthritis.    FUCKING GREAT.  I was given steroid cream to get it under control.  I have little spots of it on my elbows, my knees, and my forearms.  You can barely see it at this point, but I notice it and it makes me sad.    My doctor gave me 3 new prescriptions to try out.  I really hope that they are effective in controlling this shit.  It makes me nervous that some day Im going to be covered in scaly ugliness.  My friend Rita used to know of this girl who had psoriasis all over her whole body.  She had to bathe in like Epsom salts or something to ease the pain.  Can this NOT happen to me please?  Lastly, I told the doctor that my acne was increasing due to the medicine for the Seborrheic Dermatitis.  She told me that this is a side effect of the cream.  Well, that is just not acceptable.  So instead of having scaly, itchy skin, I get to have a 16 year olds acne angst?  She gave me a new cream to try and told me that it is experimental.  Well, last night when I put it on my face, Paul told me that I smelled like a huge matchstick.  Then the cream dried and turned my eyebrows white and best partthey started to fall out.  Guess I wont be using that cream again unless I want to have a head with no hair on it at all.    ERG!  In case you are dealing with the same type of skin problems, here is what I have been given to treat it.  Check it out and talk to your doctor as soon as you can.  For the Dermatitis:    Clenia - is an antibiotic and drying agent combination used to treat acne and other skin conditions.  And  Desonide - is a corticosteroid used to reduce itching, redness, and swelling associated with many skin conditions  For Psoriasis:    Clobex is a corticosteroid used to reduce itching, redness, and swelling associated with many skin conditions.  If you have any further questions, let me know.

       You really dont want to piss me off   I have been told that I come across as a very nice person.  However, those people that know me well know that I am not nearly as sweet and kind as I may seem on the outside.  I tend to be very manipulative, most especially if you wrong me in some way.  But then when you try to figure out my manipulativeness, I look at you and wonder why you could possibly be attacking ME of all people.    Here are some prime examples:  I cannot STAND it when people cut me off in line for the subway.  I also cant stand it when I am trying to scramble up a set of stairs and someone comes from out of nowhere and pushes me out of the way so that they can get up them first.  This type of shit happens to me all the time.  So, one day last week, this girl not only cut me off on the way out of the subway, but she did it again going up the stairs.  Anger rose in my gut and I did my best to get away from her before I punched her in the back.  On my way down another set of stairs, this girl showed up AGAIN and cut me off.  I couldnt believe it.  And what I couldnt believe even more is that without thinking about it, I deliberately kicked her foot and tripped her.  She stumbled at least 5 feet and looked back at me.  With the crowd surging behind me, I looked at her as though I had NO idea who could have tripped her.  But deep down I thought, youre just lucky you didnt fall DOWN the stairs asshole.  If I go to buy a pair of pants, shoes, gloves, dildos, whatever, it is in your best interest to be polite to me.  I dont expect much and I dont need you to blow me.  I just need a smile and maybe a thank you.  If you treat me like shit and then hand me back the wrong change, I am going to take that money and laugh at you as you get fired for that missing $20.    If you are a student that takes part in my organization and you talk to me every day like my college education means nothing in comparison to your Ivy League education, I hate you.  I will also take every request you have and throw it in the garbage.  When I am confronted on the missing paperwork, I will stand in front of you AND my boss and act like I have never seen you in my life.  I mean, learn how to be respectful or understand that it will take you 12 times as long to get the paperwork you need processed.    If I find out that you have said something bad about me to one of my friends or boyfriend, I will spend weeks coming up with a way to get you back.  For example, were you wondering where that missing Metrocard went?  Yeah, I saw you drop it on the floor and I stole it and I threw it away.  Sorry that its 3am and you now have no way to get home.    Did you call my office and ask for someone that doesnt work here?  When I told you that you had the wrong number, did you huff and puff and hang up on me?  You seeI dont like that very much and I have caller ID.  Dont be surprised if I call you back periodically throughout the day using my blocked number and either blow a whistle in your ear or slam the phone down as soon as you answer.  It really does pay to be polite.  Its not that I am a jerk to everyone.  In actuality, I tend to be a fairly patient person.  I will not immediately hurt you.  But if you come at me over and over or if you catch me on the wrong day, beware.  I can be quite a psycho with no compassion.  I have left many in my wake.

       All Work and No Play makes Joe a Straight Boy   Work has taken over my life this week.    I have had so much to do.  I even stayed a little late one day (ok 15 minutes), but still.  Although I have been busting my ass, I am still so behind and have even debated bringing some of the shit home.  Don't worry, I've thought better against it.  I mean, it's not like I make THAT kind of money.  Saw  42nd Street  last night.  Quite an experience.  Think I enjoyed seeing  urlLink Kambri Crews  more though.  She is so sophicsticated and beautiful.  I always get a little nervous when I see her cuz she comes across as totally together.  When I hugged her, I accidentally got a piece of her hair caught in my mouth and I, unfortuantely, ripped it out with brute force.  I swear I saw her wince and then I said "Oh, I'm sorry".  But I said it quietly as I'm not sure if the wince I saw was because I ripped her hair out or because she saw the huge zit on my forehead.  Either way...  Had a wonderful evening with Paul.  We giggled and pooped all night.  It was great.  Ate some subway, watched some television and spent the night tossing and turning.  FUCK YOU NICOTINE PATCH.    Today I am off to a wine tasting at Paul's job.  First time I've gone with him.  Afterwards we will probably get more drinks or dinner or see a movie.  Tomorrow I am hanging out with my lesbians and getting new clothes.  I am praying for a fun evening, but you never know these days...  Super weekends to all!

       Things I Must Admit   Since the early January wedding of Miss Britney Spears, I have found myself falling head over heels in love with Jason Allen Alexander.  You know, her ex-husband.  I dont know him personally and I dont think that he and I have much in common, but the feeling I get in my stomach when I see a picture of him is one of a kind.  I think that he is the most beautiful man I have ever seen.  In particular, I love his shoulders, his height, and his adorable face; which is new for me as I have never been attracted to someone because of their face.  I spent a good chunk of my morning desperately trying to find a picture of him with his shirt off.  I have seen glimpses in numerous magazines, but nothing I can really take home and make love to.  If you are reading this Jason, please understand that I am falling in love with you and fast.  Valentimes Day is just around the corner.  Be mine?  Hillary Duff has a new song that I just love.  I have to say that I was a fan of So Yesterday and NOT AT ALL a fan of that do a crazy dance shit.  But her new onemaybe its called Come Clean, Im not sure.  What I am sure about is that when the rains fall down I smile so big and sing along.  Clearly I am in fourth grade, with braces and pigtails.  Does anyone have a pudding I can trade an apple for at lunch?  I masturbate at work.  A LOT.  In fact, twice yesterday.  I dont like chocolate or ice cream.  I just dont.  I used to be obsessed which is why I was Martha Dumptruck, but now the idea of it makes me cringe.  What kind of American am I anyway?  Willy Wonka would have slapped me right across my dumb face.  I always look at my poop when I am done shitting.  Sometimes I truly marvel at the outcome and am impressed with my creative design.  For example, yesterday I took a shit that had a coil that could have been stretched for at least 4 feet.  No breaks.  If there was a  Trading Spaces  for poops, I would be in high demand.  Surely.  I would rather date a 50 year old man than an 18 year old boy.  Hands down.  When I was 16 or so, I thought that  urlLink Gaston  (from Disneys  Beauty and the Beast ) was the most beautiful cartoon I had ever seen.  Multiple orgasms on that one.  And Im not even embarrassed by it.  Go figger.  I won my 5th grade spelling bee by beating out 200 or so other kids.  I WON.  My parents rewarded me with The Babysitters Club #9  The Ghost at Dawns House .  I then moved on to the 5th-8th grade spelling bee and came in 18th.  I spelled dessert as desert and cried when they told me to leave the stage.    When I initially won the first spelling bee, they put a picture of me outside one of the administrative offices in the school.  One day I was walking by the picture and heard a girl say Ewe.  That kid is such a dork.  I hate him.  I was humiliated and ran away.  Its VERY difficult for me to watch the Academy Awards and the Golden Globes.  Most times I skip it and read the reviews.  Deep down I truly believe I should be at those ceremonies and watching other people get their awards encompasses me in jealousy and sadness.  I was so afraid to take a shit in a public bathroom during my first week of college that I went for 8 days without one.  I drove home that next weekend and sat on the toilet for two full days.  I was impressed with my control, but immediately had to figure out a way to poop at school.  Turns out, no one uses the bathroom at 4:30am.    Well, on that note, I am off.    Probably to jerk off to  urlLink Johnny Bravo  or some shit.

       7 days in 24 Hours   Yesterday was an incredibly long, yet wonderfully spontaneous kind of day.    It began with me working for 8 hours at my job.  I then dropped off my laundry, ate a bologna sammich and went to a 2 hour rehearsal.  I must say that I am very pleased with the progress we are making for the AIDS Benefit, planned for February.  We worked on our scenes, Mariah sang her songs and we were out of there and home by 9pm.    Since I had decided to stay at Pauls apartment, Mariah and I shared a cab.  On the way there, we decided that we wanted to go for a drink at the Bowery bar, one of NYCs hot gay spots on a Tuesday night.  Luckily Paul lives right around the corner so we only froze our tits off for about 8 minutes on the trek there.  Once inside, Mariah had a Cape Codder and I had a vodka tonic.  We sat at a booth in an empty room and talked for about an hour; during which time we ordered 2 more drinks each.  Eventually the bladder called and asked if we would release a stream of piss in his honor.  We obliged.  As Mariah was in the ladies room, this guy walks up to me and we have the following conversation:  Scary Man:  My name is Jonathan.  Whats yours? Me:  Joe Scary Man:  Nice to meet you Joe.  Do you party? Me:  Yes and no. Scary Man:  Well my friend Scary Lady and I have a bag of coke and would love for you to join us in the back room. Me:  You know, my friend is in the bathroom, so let me ask her and I will get back to you. Scary Man:  Its good shit.  Come and join us. Me:  Give me a couple minutes to talk to my friend. Scarey Man:  Fine.  Mariah exited the bathroom and I immediately told her what happened.  We both decided that doing coke with Scary Man and Scary Lady was in no way the kind of evening we wanted to have.  As we are laughing it off, the Scaries approach again.  Scary Man:  Hey you.  (apparently he didnt remember my name)  Come on.  Bring your friend and lets party. Me:  Mariah, this is Jonathan.  Jonathan, this is Mariah. Scary Man:  Hi Mariah.  Do you party?  (ENOUGH with the party shit already) Me:  Actually, we are going to pass tonight.  Its just not the---ohoksee you later. Without warning, Scary Man walks away from me and takes Scary Lady with him. ----End Scene----  Mariah and I decided to stand by the front of the bar and wait for Paul to join us.  Now, without sounding like a total asshole, I must say that the guys were all over my ass.  (I just know I am going to get a face full of acid for talking like that, but such is life)  It got so bad at one point that I asked Mariah if she was ready to leave.  She was ready, so we called Paul and told him to meet us at home.  On the way to his apartment, she and I shared a cigarette and it was the best tasting moment of my evening.  Upon arrival at Paul and Mariahs apartment, we ran into Paul coming down the stairs.  He was in an incredibly pissy mood.  We tried to be as positive as we could and told him that we would go back to the Bowery Bar if he was so inclined.  Unfortunately, he  was  so inclined.   Mariah, Paul and I then went BACK to the Bowery bar.  At the entrance, we saw Jonathan (Scary Man) and his friend, Scary Lady, being escorted out of the bar by the bouncers.  Obviously their coke wasnt THAT good.  We then sat and had dinner.   Paul was acting like a complete dickhead and eventually I exploded.  I yelled at him for a good 10 minutes while we were eating our Shrimp Poppers.  Mariah just sat there shaking her head.  (She knew Paul was in for it after the way he acted)  Eventually I let it all go and we finished our dinner.    4 drinks later, we trudged BACK home to the apartment, stopping only for McDonalds.  As though we hadnt eaten enough already.  When we got inside, we all collapsed and ate our burgers while lamenting the fact that it was 3am.    We wiped our faces and threw ourselves in bed.    Paul tried to snuggle.  I told him to do as I did at the bar and let it go.  I was not about to be snuggled after him ruining my evening.    It just goes to show that when you try to have 7 days in 24 hours, its just too much.

       The Dream that Shook My World   Last night I had a dream that really shook me up.  You see, what happened wasI was hanging out with my friend Rita.  Mariah was there too and the three of us were in Pauls apartment watching television.  I remember us sitting on the orange sectional couch and discussing the fact that we couldnt find anything good to watch.    I looked at Rita to make sure she was feeling okay.  It was at that point that I had a dream blipyou know, its a moment where you knew something, but when you see it, you are reminded about it and shocked all over again.  In this case, it was the fact that Rita was 9 months pregnant.  When I noticed her protruding stomach, she looked at me and said Joe, its time.  I asked her where her fianc (Drew) was and she said He cant make it.  I need you to help me.    I dont know what happened after that.  I think Rita gave birth in the bathroom or something, cuz the next thing I know, Rita is holding her baby and Mariah and I are once again arguing over the fact that there is nothing good on television.  Eventually Rita gets tired of holding the baby and puts him (thats right, it was a boy!) in a pet carrier.  She puts him inside and locks him in via the little door in front.    Side notethe baby looked EXACTLY like her fianc, Drew.    We sit and watch television again, making some sort of conversation.  I remember having the feeling of love for Rita as I watched her watch her baby.  I also remember being really sad that Drew couldnt be there with Rita and their baby.  She looked amazing, especially for just pushing a watermelon out of her vagina in the bathroom.  After this nostalgia feeling wore off, I looked back at the baby and saw that the top of the pet carrier had been removed.  And the baby was doing the creepiest thing ever!  He was lying with his head propped up on one hand.  He looked at me right in the eyes and said Pooey Doo.  NO JOKE.  Pooey Doo.  I start screaming Rita, the baby said his first word!  Pooey Doo!  Pooey Doo!  The baby winked at me and we all started to laugh.  I remember having the specific thought of This baby is a super genius for saying his first word on the day he was born.    I picked him up and held him for awhile with Rita on one side and Mariah on the other.  They were coo cooing and I had a moment of full completeness.    When I woke up, I was actually sad that Rita doesnt have a baby yet.  But now that its 12:30pm and I have had some time to clear my head, I figure its best that she doesnt get married in May with a huge stomach sticking through her beautiful dress.    I love you Rita.  And I am so excited about the changes that this year will bring for you.    Mostly, Im excited to be able to share it all with you.

       A Moment of Peace   As night crept in, snow began to fall Lightly fluttering to the cold ground below Moods were high, wine being passed from mouth to mouth, Laughter erupting, cackles from above  The covered earth.  Memories created, lasagna baking in the oven Fresh greens to remind us of Spring Warmth, happiness, security A time when beauty grows Within yourself.  A hug from a friend, a kind word shared The noble trust of years with you by my side. Your smile, your gaze, your sensitivity to my language Creating a wall that will separate your heart from your brain Allow yourself to trust in me the same.  The television glows with comedic anger As we move from room to room Wondering if this moment will turn romantic Awaiting the time when we will be together As one.  Standing by the window, we marvel at the blanket Of life, of time slipping through our fingers Caught in the breeze, held still by the streetlight Fluttering, for a brief moment Reminding us why stand in unity.  An arm across a shoulder, cherished silence Intertwined with love, A signal of our future, the truth that brought us  Into the lives of the one  That we call our own.  Winter will move forward, the snow will melt away But our strength, confidence in the choice we have made Will stay with us through the seasons Encouraging our happiness, blossoming with the new life That will begin soon.

       Single People VS. NON-Single People    This post should in no way reflect on anyone that is in my personal life.  It just so happens that I know quite a few single ladies and I wouldnt want them to feel as though any of this is about them directly.  Its not.  This is all just something Ive been thinking about as of late.     The other night I was sitting around and thinking why it is that I so often make Paul and my relationship sound like more of a hassle than it really is.  Cuz the truth of the matter is that its not a hassle at all.  Its a fun, obnoxious, wild, and often dramatic experience.  Sure, there are moments when I want to slap his little face, but there are moments when I want to slap my best friends faces as well.  Basically I just want to slap faces.  You understand.  Then it came to me.   I always thought that I was making my relationship sound awful because it really was.  When the truth of the matter is, I dont ever talk about how wonderful things are; I talk about how Paul did something fucked up or how he didnt keep his word, etc.  Now I have realized that the reason why I make my relationship out to be so negative is because thats what I think other people want to hear.  Those who are not in a relationship tend to give me break-up advice at every corner.  Those who are not in a relationship tend to encourage me to drop it and be single.  Its a freedom like you will never know!  As though I didnt spend 21 years living single.  A la Queen Latifah and Kim Coles.  This theory was made very clear to me during a conversation that I had last night with my dear friend Karina.  When telling her about my anniversary dinner and the gift that Paul gave me, I noticed a scowl creep over her face.  Instead of saying how happy she was for me or how I am so blessed to have someone in my life that loves me as much as Paul, she said very haughtily Are you going to move in with him now or what?  It was just about the nicest thing she could think of to say to me.  I find that people who are in relationships tend to give advice like Have you thought about how HE feels in the situation? or Give it time and be patient.  He will come around.  Those who are single tend to be the ones that say You deserve so much better. or I would never tolerate something like that in my relationship.  Its such an interesting phenomenon.  As though these type of single people have either never been in a relationship or have been out of one for so long that they cant even remember what its like.    I find that the girls that surround me in my personal life are very supportive of my decisions and my relationship.  They love me deeply and because of that, they give me genuine support and advice based on the information I supply.  But this is rare and I am lucky for that.  As per my conversation with Karina, it is apparent that there is no way for her to be supportive when she is so lonely in her own life.  Misery seeks company after all.  I wonder what would happen if Paul and I were to break up.  Would my mind and heart turn a complete 180?  Would I automatically become the kind of guy that would try to make everyone as lonely as myself?  In the past, I dont remember being the guy that wanted everyone to be single along with me.  In fact, I think I preferred being the only single guy in a bunch of committeds.  In this case, you are the one that everyone caters to; the one that everyone wants to take out and fix up.  It can be hecka fun.    I feel genuinely frustrated for those single people that date consistently and want nothing more than to fall in love, yet have a devil of a time doing it.  If this type of person is able to keep a positive outlook and still remain supportive of their committed friends, they will be rewarded ten-fold.  It takes quite a special person to keep up the momentum of dating while also allowing those around them to be in love and be happy.  I know a few of these people and it warms my heart to be a part of their lives.    But for those of you that are negative and bitter and make a concerted effort to encourage others to join you in your land of miseryshame on you.  We have all been there and it is quite possible that we will be there again.  Help us be happy if you want the same in return.  When I ask you for advice on my love life, the first words out of your mouth should not be Are you sure you still want to be with him?    I dont know.  Its just something thats been on my mind lately.

       Updates and Lil' Tidbits   Back in action!  1)	Yesterday was my first doctor's appointment in the last 8 years.  I mean, I've BEEN to the doctor since then, but I now have a real doctor in the city that's all my own.  It feels GREAT to be an adult for once.  The check up went perfectly.  He said that I am in excellent health.  The only bad thing he noticed was that I have a slight tremor (I was unable to touch my nose with my eyes closed).  He said that it may be caused by my quitting smoking or by not eating breakfast yesterday morning.  Either way, he's going to monitor it over the next couple of months to make sure it's not something serious.  BTW, I can touch my nose with my eyes closed now that I'm out of the office.  Figures.  2)	My anniversary with Paul was wonderful!  His gift to me was perfect.  He bought us two handmade silver rings from a jewelry designer ( urlLink Jill Platner ) in the city.  They are beautiful rings.  On the inside of mine it says "APG loves JHC, 1/9/2004" and his says "JHC loves APG, 1/9/2004".  We are both wearing them on the middle finger of our right hand.  I was very moved by the gift.  After this, Paul took us out to dinner at  urlLink Lupa's  and we had a great dinner.  The wine was SO good and the food, although it was gourmet style and looked foo fooish, was excellent.  The whole night was memorable.  3)	I didn't end up doing the five senses gift.  I am running VERY low on money and was unable to buy him a gift this year.  Instead I remodeled his bedroom.  I decorated it, organized it, and whipped it into shape.  He was VERY excited and happy with the gift and I saved me some extra pennies, which I am in desperate need of.    4)	For Mariah's Christmas gift, I overhauled her bedroom too.  I wish you could see it.  In the 4 years I have been friends with her, Mariah has never had an organized, clean bedroom.  Now she does.  I told her that I would be giving weekly inspections to make sure it stays that way.  And I'm serious.    5)	On Friday night we went out to Splash Bar.  I think everyone had a blast.  I know I did.  BUT, there was one rough moment.  There were these three middle aged queens hanging out in the bathroom at the same time we were and they would not leave Mariah alone.  I pulled her away from them and they got pissy.  I then asked them to leave us alone as we didn't want to hang out with them.  This one guy got really angry and called me "bald", which I didn't like very much.  I then told him that he was an "ugly 50 year old man that is obviously spending his night alone".  He didn't like that very much and grabbed my shoulder.  Now, I do NOT like when people put their hands on me and I tend to turn into a huge psycho.  I started telling him to "remove his fucking hands immediately" and he kept pushing me and rubbing my head.  Eventually the bouncer came over and asked me if this loser was bothering me.  I said yes and proceeded to walk with the bouncer to the entrance.  Fuck head got BOUNCED right out the bar.  I felt so powerful and dared all of my friends to mess with me.    6)	My brother is being nominated for a  urlLink Bronze Star !  Read up on it to find out more.  My family couldn't be more proud.  7)	I saw  Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King  last night.  I must say, this trilogy is by far my most favorite trilogy ever.  I could watch it over and over and over.  The last installment is surely Oscar worthy and will prove that point once the Academy Awards roll around.  I won't give anything away, but dammit, it is rare to see a movie of such caliber.  Thank you  urlLink Peter Jackson  for directing this masterpiece.  8)	Ari informed me that there is a new remake of  urlLink Dawn of the Dead  coming.  She showed me the trailer while we were at work on Friday and I still can't get it out of my head.  FUCKING YAY!  9)	I had one cigarette on Friday night.  I caved and had it all by myself in my bedroom.  I haven't had a single drag since and am still quitting the smokes, but I did cave once and thought I should be honest about it.  Unfortunately, the Nicotine patch is giving me a horrible case of insomnia.  I have to try removing it before bed tonight to see if that helps.  I'm barely surviving on 6 hours of sleep  for the last 3 days.  That should be it.    I have rehearsal tonight.  We found a space for our February AIDS benefit.  I am really excited that this is moving forward.  I have to memorize another script during my lunch break today and I should be ready to go.    Now, if only I could get myself an agent and make some money doing this acting thing.  That's my next goal and it couldn't come sooner.    Happy Stupid Tuesday!

      Its FRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIDAY!  PHEW!  I actually survived this full work week.  When Monday began, I wasnt sure that was a possibility.  With all of the holidays lately, I had gotten really used to sitting on my ass all day, watching tv, jerking off, eating boxes and boxes of donuts.  Oh waitthats what I did LAST night.  Tonight I am off to  urlLink Splash  bar.  I havent been there in QUITE a long time.  The lezzies in my life are feeling guilty, so they have offered to go out to a bar that would be of my liking for once.  I thought it to be a nice gesture.  Gesture.  Gesticulation.  Ation.  Time for a new paragraph.  Last night I was able to coerce Little Poop into being held for awhile.  Now he is totally addicted to the man love I have to offer.  Every time I put him back in his cage, he would either squeak to be picked back up or would sit next to the glass, with our heads looking lovingly at each other.  I think Colby (who is the definitive leader of the group) didnt like all the attention that Little Poop was getting because at one point, he attacked the Little Poops and made him cry.  I was NOT happy.  If that happens again, Colby is going to be chilling out at Petland.  He will NOT hurt my poopsie.    SoSplash it is!  This bar is usually filled with many a muscleman, so tonight I must look good and be ready to work my charms.  Its always nice to have a big man to kiss and talk to for a while.  Then tomorrow night is my anniversary celebration with Paul!  He was a raging prick about it this morning, but my mood is too good to ruin.  4 years and he is still cunty.  But that seems to be the way I like em.  Dont treat me like gold, or I will surely show you the door.  A la the guy that has been stalking me since Thanksgiving.     urlLink Ari  got me 4 new DVDs for Christmas!  The selection is as follows:  The Shining, GO, National Lampoons Vacation, 28 Days Later .  WOO HOO!  I couldnt BE more thrilled.  I have so much to watch and I am proud to call these movies my own.  My DVD collection is coming along just nicely.  Thank you  urlLink Ari !  Great gift!  This is my 6th day without a cigarette.  And wouldnt you know it?  I forgot to put the patch on this morning.  I didnt even realize until I got to the subway and then panic mode hit in.  Well, now I HAVE to smoke today.  I cant get through 4 hours or work with no patch and no cigarette.  I was about ready to run back to my apartment or to hit the closest CVS for a pack when I realized that this is NOT a crisis.  I only work until 2pm today and I have enough confidence in myself that I can make it without either.  I am a quitter and I love it!    The biggest challenge is going to come tonight when I get wasted for the first time since I quit.  Definitely going to be hard, but I am ready for it.  I wonder if Ill feel better tomorrow when I wake up, having not smoked 2 packs of cigs.  Twill be interesting.    Want to hear something sad?  Yesterday, my brother called me at work, but I was on my lunch break, so we didnt get a chance to talk.  Then he called my mother who was on a business trip, so he couldnt talk to her either.  After that he called my dad, who was away from his desk, and his girlfriend, who was at the gym.  4 phone calls from Baghdad and everyone was too busy to talk to him.  Insert overtly sad music.  Poor kid.  Just come home now please.  Well, thats it.  Leaving work soon to have an anniversary lunch with my boy and then off to see my theatre professor from college.  Random day, but totally ready for it.    Here comes the weekend!  Breathe it in as deeply as possible.

      Ouch.  It hurts to type today.  Would you like to know why?  Well, yesterday, I left work to go buy myself some new children.  You know, hamster children.  I had previously decided that I would be purchasing 3 or 4 dwarf hamsters to inhabit the cage that dear departed Kimberly left behind.  I went over to Petland Discounts and picked up 3 beautiful new babies.  Two of them are twins  fluffy and grey, and from what I can tell, the supermodels of the hamster world.  The third one looks like a tiny black cotton ball.  When he walks, he looks like he is moving on tiny wheels.    AnywayI named the twins Colby and Morgan.  I named the little puffball Paul, but his nickname is Little Poops.  I am in serious LOVE with Little Poops.  He is so fucking cute that every time he came out from his nest I jumped up from my bed and pressed my big scary face up against the wall of the aquarium so that I could get a closer look at him.  He is so adorable that I want to put him in my vagina and pretend as though I birthed him myself.  I LOVE him.  It almost makes me cry I love him so much.    But then there is Colby and Morgan.  These two fucking bitches are the most vicious animals I have ever come across.  The only time they didnt draw blood from my fingers is when I was feeding them some lettuce.  I figured that they were just getting acquainted with their new environment, so I left them alone for most of the night.  This morning I woke up to find that their water bottle (which I have added an extension to, cuz the new babies are too small to reach it) was lying on the ground.  I reached my hand in to readjust the bottle, when out of nowhere, Colby comes charging out of the nest and chomps right on my pinky.  I jerked my hand up just in time to see a NEW welt being formed.  I wasnt ANYWHERE NEAR him and he attacked me.    I was furious.  I pulled my hand out and noticed that Colby was staring me down through the glass.  His eyes are beady and blood thirsty.  Now, I have 4 bites on my hand and one substantial bruise on my knuckle.  Little FUCKERS.  My old hamsters never did that.  If they nipped, they never broke the skin.  These new little bastards have broken the skin by just LOOKING at my hand.  I dont like them one bit.    But then theres Little Poop who just rolls (remember, he is on wheels) around the cage being as adorable as he possibly can.  Unfortunately, Colby and Morgan wont let me anywhere near him.  I am glad that they arent fighting, but I am angry that they think that they are the boss.  They better chill the fuck out or they are going to find themselves fending for their lives in the NYC subway system.    Lastly, as I have said, little Jimbo is doing very well.  He is healed up and acting like a brand new hamster.  He and I have this new game.  When I want him to come out of his little bed and play with me, I ring a bell and he peeks his head out of his hole.  If hes in the mood to be held or play, he will stretch his weary bones and come out.  If hes not he will simply put his head back in his house.  Sometimes I want him to be held even when hes not in the mood.  Ill stick my finger inside his house and he will gently nudge it out with his nose.  I will keep putting my finger in there and he will nudge and nudge until I get the point.  Its a very loving relationship and nothing like what I have with Colby and Morgan.  In other news, thanks to my dear friend  urlLink Jules , I have figured out what to give Paul for his anniversary present.  I will be doing a Five Senses themed gift.  INGENIOUS!  And I am embarrassed that I couldnt think of anything that clever.    Heres what I came up with so far:  Sight:  A book  probably an Augusten Burroughs or David Sedaris. Sound:  A CD that I will burn for him myself on my new burner! Taste:  My cum.  Well, my cum and ALSO a gift certificate to Starbucks. Touch:  Colby and Morgan.  He will LOVE the way they make his hands feel. Smell:  A Q-tip that has been swabbed in my belly button.    Okay, so obviously I have a bit of tweaking to do on this gift.  But I love the idea.    Im also thinking that I am going to take him to see a gay play in the city.  There is tons of gay theatre here and he and I have yet to partake in any of it.  Afterwards, he will take us out to a very nice dinner and we will spend the rest of the evening cuddling and in love.  It would be nice if some sex was thrown in, but its been months since that has happened, so not counting on it.  Ill probably just hook up with someone else on Friday night to get it out of my system.    You understand.  Its how EVERYONE spends their 4 year anniversary with their boyfriend.  And that is all she wrote.  Murder She Wrote.

      It is Wednesday and I must say that this week has flown by so far.  I appreciate that.  Thank you Monday and Tuesday.  You are the sweetest.  So, Im on my fourth day of no smoking and I must say that I am having quite an easy time with it so far.  I always knew that when I was ready it would be something that I would WANT to do and not just something I thought I should do.  I have some rough moments, but overall, I am in a very good mood.  I feel healthy, I feel alive, and I feel like I never want to go back to being the person that I was, just last week.  Quitting the cigarettes is something that changes your life in dramatic ways.  You feel like a completely different person.  Its almost like I decided to wear clothes, when I was morally opposed to it in the past.  Does that make any sense?  Fuck no, but I still like that I quit smoking!  I had a horrible dream last night that resulted in me punching my mother in the face.  It was very upsetting.  When I spoke to my mom this morning and told her of the dream, she said Joe, dont punch your mother.  That hurts my feelings.  MOM!  It hurts my feelings too!  Dont get me all riled up or youre gonna get another punch.  The dream sucked and I came in to work an hour late because of it.  Or maybe because I wanted to lie in my comfortable bed for an extra half an hour.  Get off my back will ya?!?!  This Friday is mine and Pauls 4 year anniversary.  He has yet to arrange for the day off from work.  Yeahdont get me started on THAT one.  In any case, I havent come up with a gift idea yet.   Anyone have any suggestions?  I dont have much money and I have about exhausted the creative outlet.  One year I sang You are my Sunshine and gave him clothes.  Another year I wrote him a letter.  Another year I wrote him a poem and gave him a framed picture of the two of us.  So you seeI think the last thing he wants is for me to perform a monologue or make decoupage.  OMG.  What about decoupage?!  That could be fun AND adorable.  Ok, stoppit Joe.  Buy him a ham and be done with it.    Our rehearsal went extremely well for me last night.  My monologue is coming along nicely and I am excited about the decisions that were made regarding the February AIDS benefit.  Afterwards, Angie, Kelly and I went for a couple of drinks and I was able to make it home for the last half of the new Real World.  At first glance I thought I was going to hate it again (the last few seasons have REALLY tried my patience with Bunim/Murray Productions).  But by the end of the episode, I decided that I love it.  Of course the manimal Brad is extremely hot to me.  But I must say that he is the ugliest hunk I have ever seen.  His eyes are that of Sylvester Stallone and they look wildly inappropriate for his face.  And hes a meathead.  And I want to give him head.  I also decided that I love the girl thats punk rock-ish, although why did the casting directors ruin her life by sticking her in that house.  I dont think she will fit in well.  And lastly, my favorite character is the girl who has jinormous boobies, but is built like a muscleman.  She seems hella cool.    Baright.    I gotta go drain the lizard.  Ok, since when do I use THAT phrase?  EhI gotta go drain my cock.   Thats the Joe we know and want to fuck.  Enjoy the hump day!

      Over the last couple of years, I have been very lax about making New Years resolutions.  This year I decided that it was imperative that I make a few and really try to stick with them.  However, instead of forcing myself to come up with them and start on New Years Eve, I decided to wait until a few days afterwards, so as not to put any unnecessary pressure upon myself.  As I said, I am serious about sticking to my resolutions.    Sowithout further adieuadooraguI give you my 2004 New Years Resolutions!  *Quit smoking.  By all means, cut the shit and stop putting those filthy bitches in your mouth Joe!  I am three days in and more vehement about quitting than I was 3 days ago.    *Eat healthier.  Pizza should be eaten no more than twice a week and there must be a serious cut down on candy.  My teeth and my loves (love handles) need the break.  *Complete 3 days of exercise per week.  That means running or calisthenics or weight training.  Jumping out of a plane counts and so does taking a really good shit.  Ok, shits dont count, but if Im having a really hard weekyeah, shits dont count.  *Put $25 a week into my savings account.  God knows where I will get that extra money, but God also knows that I need that extra money, what with all of my friends getting married this year.  $25 a week may save my ass in the long run.  *Make one MAJOR jump in my acting career.  This includes getting an agent or doing a student film for PAY or participating in any production that will get me closer to obtaining my Actors Equity or SAG card.    *Work on having more patience, more self-esteem, more confidence, and better stress management.  *Take an acting class.  *Get my Passport.  *Learn how to sew.  *Go to the dentist.  (Yes Ive BEEN to the dentist beforejust not since 2002.  Im SCARED of it ok?!?!)  *Be kinder and more understanding with Paul.  *Go to church at least twice a month.  No exceptions.  *Create a recipe binder.  *Organize my loose papers.  (We ALL have loose papers, right?)  *Develop my 25 rolls of film.  *Hook up with a bodybuilder of substantial size.  *Eat a vagina.  Hork never.  I think this list is fair and I have a whole year to complete it.  To me, the most important item on this list, besides learning to sew of course, is to go to church.  Over the last two years, my relationship with God has become strained and almost non-existent.  I do pray on a daily basis, but its just not enough.  I know that if I work on this relationship, everything else will fall right into place.    Its time to focus on what is really important.

      Well, it is officially 2004!  The last couple of weeks have been so hectic.  I am relieved to finally settle down into some sort of a routine.  I am such a creature of habit that the last month has torn me apart, both physically and emotionally.  But now it is time to start afresh.  It is time to move forward and to implement some new direction into my otherwise directionless lifestyle.    Heres a brief recap of 2003s bitter end:   New Years Extravaganza   Kelly, Angie, my parents and I spent New Years Eve together.  We went out to an overly priced, not very good tasting dinner.  Afterwards, we played charades and a game that I had created all on my own.  And yes, there was a prize for the winner.  At 11:30pm, the five of us walked 25 steps to the center of Times Square.  For a half an hour we were brutalized by the thousands of people that were crammed into the heart of the city, ready to ring in the New Year.  It was a bit scary, but totally exciting.  The jumbotron above our heads counted down seconds to the New Year and we all screamed and screamed and screamed.  At midnight the five of us hugged and kissed as best as we could, and tears streamed down my face.  It was one of the most memorable moments of my life.    Luckily, we only had those 25 steps to walk to get back to my apartment.  Upon arrival, we grabbed our bottle of champagne, went to the roof and watched the rest of humanity try to fight their way to freedom.  It was completely overwhelming and Ive never been so proud to live in Times Square in my life.  We were all part of something that we will (hopefully) never have to do again.  But it was amazing to do it once.  At 1am, Angie, Kelly and I went down to Pauls apartment and the night continued to be hectic and random.  Initially we were locked out of Pauls apartment and we spent a half an hour drinking beers and smoking in his hallway.  It was hilarious and awesome.  Around 2am, Mariah came home and we partied until 6am.    I woke up on New Years Day with a horrible hangover and the flu of death.  I watched 4 hours of  Punked  with Angie and Mariah and went out to dinner.  After that I spent the next four days coughing my lungs out and sleeping in my bed.  Not a great way to start the New Year, but there was no other option.  Im just glad that Im FINALLY feeling better.  And much thanks to Angie who supplied me with enough Cranberry Juice and DayQuill to get me up and out of my bed on Sunday.   The Sad Death of Kimberly   On New Years Eve, my darling little hamster Kimberly walked over to the little car inside her cage, laid her head down and breathed her last breath.  Over the Christmas holiday, she seemed to age at an extraordinary rate.  Out of nowhere.  I spent the days leading up to New Years with her sitting in my lap watching TV.  I could tell that she was about to go.  She received a proper burial in the garbage can on 46th and 7th.  I plan on buying a new baby sometime this week.   The Unbelievable Recovery of Jim   Wouldnt you know it?  Little Jimbo, who has had the life of misery since the beating Kimberly gave him, is now running around like a mad man.  He is fully healed and is going out of his damn mind.  He has learned to use his gimpy leg and runs so fast on his hamster wheel that I am convinced hes going to knock it off its track.  I think he knows Kimberly is dead and he is surely celebrating. The little guy has a second chance at life and I couldnt be more pleased.  All that TLC and hydrogen peroxide I used made him all better.     My Biggest Challenge   After 6 and a half years of smoking a pack a day, I have decided to give it up once and for all.  I have made attempts at quitting in the past, but I have never felt so strong in my resolve as I do now.  It has been 48 hours and although I am getting panic attacks and moments of tear inducing anxiety, there is no way that I am going to return to the life I once led.  I want out and I want out now.  I need the money, I have a desire to be healthy, and I dont want to be a smoker ever again.  Enough is fucking enough.  Be strong Joe.  Be strong.   My Lil Accident   8 hours after quitting smoking, I had a seriously bad moment.  I was in the shower, radio blasting, when Paul decided to wash the dishes.  I had shampoo in my hair, body all soaped up and was hit with an onslaught of scalding hot water.  I backed away from the stream of pain and started screaming at Paul to stop washing the dishes.  He couldnt hear me over the sound of the radio so I reached out of the shower to turn the volume down.  Without any warning, my feet gave out from under me and I plunged headfirst onto the bathroom floor.  I twisted my ankle and smacked my head against the wall.  The pain was excruciating and the tears came immediately.  Paul heard me fall and ran to the bathroom door, but it was locked.  I reached up and unlocked it and he gasped when he saw my soapy body huddled on the floor in tears.  He tried to move me, but the pain was unbearable and I began to throw up in the toilet.  It was awful.  Eventually he helped me back into the shower so that I could rinse the soap off my body and out of my hair.   Some Bad News   My brother called my family on Friday and told us that he will not be able to come home in January.  His leave time was cancelled.  We are obviously devastated.  When he is released in May, it will be 13 months since we have seen him.   The Theatre Company   Rehearsals start tomorrow for our upcoming AIDS Benefit.  I have yet to memorize my monologue and will be spending the next 24 hours doing just that.  I am SO glad to have some acting to look forward to.  A friend of ours is now doing guest spots on  One Life to Live  and the fire inside of me burns to be where he is right now.  By the end of yearby the end of the year   My Hair   is wildly out of control.  Someone grab the hedge clippers and meet me in the parking lot.   The Real World   Yes I saw Dannys boyfriend Paul and I have to sayWHA HAPPEN?  Paul used to be HOTTTTT.  But now Paul is scraggly and skinny.  Wha happen?   Also, thank you to MTV for showing  The Real World: New Orleans  from beginning to end.  It was just what this sick boy needed.   The Sims   I got the Sims game for Playstation 2 for Christmas and I have already spent at least 56 hours on it.  Its kind of an irritating game that is mind numbingly addictive.  Someone help me help myself.     Adios   Thats it for today.    Hope everyone had a JOYOUS and FUN New Years!    Heres to a better year.  For all of us.  Peace.

       Ride or Die   Wellity.  Look whos back!  Back again.  Tell a friend.  Fuck you Eminem.  And fuck Kim Mathers too.  Hi everyone.  Long time with no shit cutting, eh?  Well, dont you worry.  Ive been stewing in a dumpster of my own shit for weeks.  Unfortunately I havent been able to crawl out of my poop pile in order to write an entry in my journal.  But here I am.  Alive and kicking.  So, why should we dilly dally any longer?   Its time to jump right in with some updates!   Work  Ari and I have had quite a tumultuous ride over the last couple of weeks.  It all started with a simple supply order mistake and ended up being World War 11.  My boss scheduled a meeting with the two of us which had me sick to my stomach for days.  When we finally sat down with him, he screamed like a bitch for 20 minutes until Ari shoved her foot up his fat ass.  Eventually it all worked out ok, but I think I have had enough of my unprofessional, lackluster, waste of my time, job.     The Big Move  After countless days of looking at countless apartments, Kelly and I finally decided on a place on the Upper East Side.  Yes, were movin on up.  Its actually not too high up, 76th street.  The apartment is gorgeous:  Exposed brick on the wall, beautiful wall paper, cherry wood floors, and brand new appliances.  Downfalls: 3 and a half avenues to the subway and the living room is a bit small.  Its pretty much a trade off.  A fantastic pad that is on the edge of the earth.  But at least were still in Manhattan and the river will be beautiful in the summer.  Picnic lunch on the Promenade anyone?   Paul  Weve been getting along, which is nice.  But weve been getting along like friends do.  Last Friday he and I had a very long talk about our future.  I feel as though we are on the last legs of our relationship  for real this time.  He has quite a few issues that he is trying to work though and I have done whatever I can to help him along the way.  Unfortunately I think there comes a point when you are no longer helping, only making things harder.  I think we may be at that point.     Wedding Showers and Bachelorette Parties  My best friend, Rita, gets married on May 1st becoming the catalyst for a summer filled with weddings.  I have only been to one wedding in my life, yet this summer I will be in two and attending a third.  Clearly I dont have the finances for this type of summer, but all of my friends have been incredibly supportive and have offered to cover some of my costs.  Some of the best times of my life have been spent with my girls from college.  Our group consists of 6 very different people.  However there is a clear balance to our love and an understanding like I have never been able to find in any other group of friends.  I am in the midst of planning Ritas bachelorette party at the moment and it is fun and sad all at the same time.  I want this to be the time of her life.  More than anything.   Theatre Company  On top of everything else that I have going on, I am still an active member of the Theatre Company.  Auditions for the next show are in two weeks and I couldnt be more excited and stressed by the whole thing.  The Company has decided to do the play The House of Yes, assuming we have no problem obtaining the copyrights.  If you have never heard of this play before, you may want to check out the movie starring Parker Posey.  Freddie Prinze is also in it, but he sucks cock.  And poorly.   And he lets jizz dry on his face.  And then he scrapes it off and eats it.     My Brother  In three months, my brother will be returning from Iraq.  He is supposed to be making his flight reservations this week.  My family has been awaiting this moment since he left for the war back in April of last year.  Its been too long since we have seen him.  Its time for him to come home to us.   This Journal  I have been so stressed out over the last two weeks that keeping up with this journal has been nothing but a hassle.  Ive considered shutting it down.  Its been two years of keeping this thing alive and it may be time to pull it.  However, this morning I received an email from a reader in London who told me that she lives for my posts.  That kind of encouragement makes me feel like I could never stop.  Its emails like hers that gives me the fire to keep up with it.  So, thank you to my new friend.  Youve kept me writing for at least another day.     In Closing  We move into our new apartment on Monday.  Please bear with me until then.  Once I settle in to my new exposed brick apartment, I will be so relieved.  I have a big weekend of packing and moving ahead of me.  Im pretty much ready for it.  But are my muscles ready for it?  While I have 4 or 5 girls helping me out, being the only boy involved makes me a bit nervous.  Paul has to work.  Figures.  Next time I need to date a big, strong, AVAILABLE guy.  Then I will move every weekend just cuz I can.  I hope all you readers out there are happy and healthy.    Spring is coming.  NYC is sure to smell like hot summer piss.  Cant wait.

       My boss is the Antichrist   He has not only hurt my feelings and my pride, but he has proven himself to be a completely useless superviser.  There is a line that a boss should never cross with their employee.  And that line was definitely crossed today.  It's the last straw.  He and I will be meeting on Tuesday morning.    After our meeting, I will be meeting with HIS superviser to discuss the way he treats his employees.  You want to play hardball fucker?  I'm ready.  Be back tomorrow when I feel like I won't kill someone.

       What a Friend Does   Today I had the honor of visiting my friend Angie during my lunch break.   You see, I was having a super bad day at work and I decided that I would feel better if I jet down to Hells Kitchen to catch up with my dear friend, the Angemeister.  Ora better nicknameor at least one that wasnt MUY LAME!  It takes me 20 minutes to get to her apartment from work and then it takes me another 20 minutes to get back.  I had previously warned  urlLink Ari  that I might be a few minutes late.  Ha!  Few minutesit was a full half hour.  Thanks A-dawg!  So, I arrive at Angies apartment and I immediately have to take a dump.  Go figure.  I had to shove my face with 3 pounds of Swedish fish last night and my punishment is tie-dye diarrhea.  I sit on her can for a couple of minutes and then I flush, light a match and join Angie on the couch.  She presents me with the tightest and most beautiful  J  I have ever seen and we proceed to wellJ it.  You understand.  Ten minutes later I am laughing my ass off and talking to her about all of lifes foibles.  We discuss a number of things and stamp out the J.  I ask her for a piece of nicotine laced gum and she obliges.  With 6 pieces.  Since I dont have the patch on today, the Nicorette gum saved my ass.  I can now chomp with abandon and marvel at my cigarette free day.    As I am leaving to go back to work, Angie presents me with a chicken breast sandwich that she bought for me at a local deli.  I just looked at her with astonishment.  Does she think of everything?  Did she want me to pay her back?  I didnt plan on buying a sandwich, but should I pay her back?    She refused to take my money.  Absolutely refused.    I gave her a hug and a kiss and I took off for work.  Angie gave me a few gifts today.  The gift of J.  The gift of Nicorette.  The gift of chicken breast sandwich.  But most importantly the gift of friendship.    To be able to hang out with someone and have them change your mood completely in a half an hour?  Thats a friend.  To be able to talk to someone and have them listen and give you intuitive advice?  Thats a friend.  And finally, to be able to count on someone to look at you with understanding eyes and to take notice of how you feel deep down?  Thats a friend that I am so lucky to have.    Today will be better now.  I just know it.

       Just Another Saturday Night?   On Saturday night, the Theatre Company held a fundraiser entitled Aids. a benefit.  The program consisted of 3 monologues, 2 poems, and 2 scenes.  Also my friend Mariah performed 2 songs and we had a representative from Gods Love We Deliver give a short presentation about his organization.  All in all it was a very tight little piece we had put together.    Of course there were the usual panic attacks right before the show.  Was anyone going to come?  Did we have enough snack foods?  What if we had more people than we had chairs?  What if we forgot our lines?  Why is the pipe in the back of the theatre spilling water all over the floor?    It was completely nerve-wracking and hectic, but we pulled everything off with such grace.    The performance only lasted about a half an hour, but the response was incredible.  I thought that everyones performance was right on.  I was also extremely pleased with the way my monologue went.  I received quite a few compliments from those in attendance.  After having in depth conversations with a few audience members, I was relieved to know that my piece was not only well done, but moving and powerful in its own right.  I had stressed about my monologue for so long that finding out how much it affected people really made me feel as though the work I put into it was well worth it.    We had about 35 people in attendance and we luckily made just over $400.  We are donating 20% of the proceeds to Gods Love We Deliver and are using the rest of the money to get started on our spring 2004 production.  We are wasting no time in jumping in to the next show as we are having our first production meeting tomorrow.  It may be a little soon, since Kelly and I are frantically trying to find ourselves a new apartment in the next week as well.  But I tend to work best under pressure, so I am lucky that there is a shit load of it on my back right now to keep me moving in high gear.    After the benefit, I spent some time with a few guys who visited from my college.  It was so nice to catch up with them.  There were also people there from every aspect of our NYC life.  Work, friends, lesbian bars, etc.  The only person who wasnt in attendance was Paul.  He got stuck at work, sort of.  There isnt much to say except he broke my heart that night.  And he didnt apologize either.  As Ive been telling myself every hour after the showits fine.  After schmoozing at the bar for an hour or so, 15 of us made our way to the East Village.  We ended up completely taking over a local dive bar and drinking our faces off.  It was a very eclectic group of people and for the most part it went smoothly.   I am always perplexed by people who ignore guests of theirs.  I mean, if you dont want to hang out with someone, send them home.  Its irritating for everyone else to have to take care of your guest, while youre busy talking to who you want to talk to.  And that happened A LOT on Saturday night.  I dont think anyones feelings got hurt, thanks to those of us who took care of the problem.  But if you ask me if I had a great time on Saturday night, I wouldnt be able to say YES!  I would smile and walk away politely.   I am learning to bite my tongue a lot more than I have in the past.  I have tried being vocal about shit that bothers me, but to no avail.  I have since learned that people would rather have smoke blown up their ass than they would to have a real conversation with someone.  I guess all of this stuff is running through my head today because it is the first time I have voiced my opinion since Saturday night.  I like hanging out with tons of people at once, but I like when I dont have to be the one that makes sure everyone is comfortable.  I dont know if people expect me to assume that role or if I do it out of necessity, but either way, it is something that happens frequently.    So yeah.  The benefit was a raging success.  The outing afterwards was ok.   Kelly and I start looking at apartments this week too!  AY YI YI!  So much going on at once.  We think we have found a really adorable place in Chelsea, but we wont know for sure until we see it on Wednesday.  But could you imagine me living in Chelsea?  ME EITHER, but I LOVE the idea!  Keep Kelly and I in your prayers.  Till tomorrow

       The Fall of Poopsie   Last night I got home from rehearsal to find that there had been a coup detat in my hamster cage.    As I entered my bedroom, I heard some loud squeaking.  I flipped on the light and went over to the cage to find that Poopsie had Colby pinned to the floor of the cage.  Now, if you remember correctly, Poopsie is the smallest hamster I have ever seen.  He is a black cotton ball that moves on mini wheels.  He is TINY, but as I found out last night, can pack quite a wallop.    When Poopsie saw me looking into the cage, he backed off of Colby and put his innocent face on.  I put my hand in the cage and he walked right into it.  He can be quite adorable and also manipulative as I learned last night.    I played with Poops for a while and then put him back in the cage.  I went to get something to drink from the fridge and when I came back, Poopsie had Colby pinned down again.  I decided to watch from afar to see what was really going on.  Eventually Colby freed himself and I watched as Poopsie chased him around the cage, biting at his heels.  Colby squawked and squawked and ran for his life.    Morgan sat nearby shoving his face with everything he could get his hands on.  I decided to clean the cage.  I thought that maybe they were fighting because they were living in a cage filled with shit and piss.  Once their new home was ready to go, I put them back in the cage.  Poopsie immediately went over to Colby, grabbed him by the neck and shoved him to the ground.  I burst out laughing, but also thought What the fuck is going on with my Poops!?  Eventually the squeaking got so loud that I had to separate Poopsie from Colby and Morgan.  I put up a divider in the cage.  I fixed up both sides and made the cage into two little homes.  Colby and Morgan walked around and decorated their new pad while Poopsie went CRAZY.  He thrashed about, tearing through his half of the cage.  The little house I built for him out of a cardboard box was destroyed within minutes.    I went over to the cage and asked Poopsie what the deal was.  He looked at me with his tiny brown eyes and I melted.  But I was perplexedhow come these three hamsters have turned into vicious enemies?  They were best friends and now they want each other dead.    Who knows.    But for now they must be separated.  Jim, on the other hand, is doing so well.  He sits and watches TV with me sometimes.  Other times he walks around my bed and has little adventures.  He loves crawling under my sheets and in my pant legs.  He can fill a whole day by playing hide and go seek.  I just love him and his sweet disposition.  Tonight I will go home and love them to pieces.    Maybe thats all their world needs.    A lil bit o love.

       I screwed up.     I was supposed to do a post today on the effects of lying and the such.  But unfortunately, I lied about doing the experiments, so there will be no post about that today.    Sike!  I just forgot.  Can you forgive me?  Can we take a rain check on it and I will do the test next Monday and Tuesday?  Or am I just lying once again?  MWAH HA HA HA HA.  heh. yo.  InsteadI give you some  Did you knows .  So, did you know  That I own 8 muscle man videos?  They are kind of like porn except the focus is on the muscle and not on the dicks or assholes.  I just love my men BIG and watching them on TV makes me blow my load over and over and over.  The only catchone of the men in my videos died last year and I still masturbate to his video.  Is that necrophilia?   That I tried my first cigarette at the age of 20?  I HATED it.  When I turned 21 I decided I wanted to be a smoker because it would make me cooler.  Now that Ive more or less quit, I have realized that being cool is what its all about.  I should go buy a pack after work.  That my favorite meal at McDonalds used to be the Big Mac?  I loved it for years and would get it as often as I could possibly stomach it.  Now, for the first time ever, I have moved on to the Big and Tasty (of course with cheese!) and I have never been happier.  That I would rather be deaf than blind?  That I have been writing this post for the last 5 hours?  I gotta go.  SWAK!

       Theatre brings me to Tears    The theatre company that I work with is throwing their AIDS Benefit this Saturday.  A month of work has finally culminated in whatever tonights rehearsal will bring.  Although the event is 4  whole  days away, we have yet to put all of the pieces into a concrete format.  Leave it to actors to wait until the last minute.  I know that everyone has worked on their monologues and I am very excited to put it all together.  The production shouldnt last longer than 45 minutes, but it is our goal to make it as powerful as we possibly can.  My monologue gives me the jitters.  I have to talk about how I was in the hospital with AIDS and how I shit myself all the time.  Its pretty graphic, but if done well can be very moving.    During lunch today, I spent the hour running my pieces.  At one point, I was sobbing while delivering my lines.  Out of nowhere, I heard a knock on the door and was horrified to see the fire marshal walk in.  (He was testing the alarms)  He saw me crying and said Oh, sorry.  I didnt mean to disturb you.  I was so embarrassed and before I could explain myself, he shut the door and left.  I sat there thinkingno one ever understands an actor.    You should see me running my lines on the subway!  Anynoodle, my friend Mariah is singing two songs and we are having someone from  urlLink God's Love We Deliver  speak about the organization.  AY YI YI!  So much to do and so little time.  But thats how we all work best, so lets go!   If you are interested in attending, the event will be at 6pm at a bar in Times Square.  Yes, you can drink during the performance.  Send me an email for further details.  Other than that, everything is going pretty smoothly on my end.  Paul and I had a wonderful night together.  He made my most favorite dinner: macaroni and cheese (Velveeta style), sauted green beans, chicken cutlets, and Caesar salad.  He is a wonderful cook and I ate as though I hadnt seen food in months.  It was greedy and monsterish and I couldnt stop myself.  I moved on to an entire bag of sour patch kids and Swedish fish and finally rolled my fat ass into bed.  Dont worry, I took a huge dump this morning and was ready for pizza by 11am.  Yeah, I gotta re-think this whole eating like a slob while not smoking thing.    If you havent started watching  The Inferno  on MTV, you are really pissing me off.  Get on the ball.  Last night RUH RUH RUH ROCKED!  Gotta jet.  Not much time today.  Must Must Must increase my bust?

       Rita and The Patriots and Pigs in a Blanket    This weekend was a whirlwind of madness.    As I sit at my desk this morning, I am reminded (by my sagging eyelids) how little sleep I actually got.  I am also slightly impressed that I made it through the entire experience, from beginning to end, with a positive attitude and jubilant mood.    Ritas visit was the shortest its ever been.  We partied, we talked, we hugged, we laughed, and we spent every second trying to maximize the visit in whatever way we could.  She was able to spend time with Kelly, Angie, Mariah, and even Ari hung with us for a bit!  So many beers, so many bottles of wine, quite a few Malibus and pineapple.  In total, I slept for 10 hours this weekend.  And fuck do I feel it today.  After sending Rita off in her airport bound cab, I took the subway to Pauls apartment.  Sure, it was 7:30am and a Sunday, why WOULDNT he be expecting me at his front door?  At first he was irritated that I woke him up, but after he had a minute to realize that I went over to be with him, he softened and even went late to work on my account.  I then crashed for a 3 hour power nap.    When I awoke, Mariah and I hastily through together a Super Bowl party replete with chicken wings, hot dog roll-ups and numerous varieties of vegetables, potato chips and dipping sauces.  There was more beer, some red wine, some vodka tonics, and even a few bottles of sodayou know, for pussies.    8 people were at the party, only one of which was straight.  Yes, gay people pretend to like the super bowl too!  I think everyone had fun, although I didnt move off the couch for the entire evening.  I just kept shoving my face with whatever I could get my hands on.  It was sick and wonderful all at the same time.    Then half time hit.    What the fuck.  Is something seriously wrong with Justin and Janet?  I mean, I understand trying to push the envelope and shit, but at the Super Bowl?  The event children stay up with their families to watch?  Parents who allow their children to BUY Justins CDs?  I just didnt get it and to be honest, I thought it destroyed their performance.  It was bad enough that the Super Bowl performers were warmed up leftovers from years ago, but to end it with a jaw dropping removal of Janets right breast plate?  Scummy.  And lame.  I was not impressed.    And I was even MORE unimpressed that Justins reps are saying that it was a wardrobe malfunction.  Give me a fucking break.  You made a decision that was risky and it didnt work.  Accept your consequences.  Janets star metal pasty over her nipple?  Clearly she wasnt prepared for the ripping of the costume.  And alsowas Janets boob white?  I dont see a lot of boobs in my travels so its possible that black girls have white boobs, but logic tells me otherwise.        The game itself was really good.  Very exciting.  The guy who owns the building I work in also owns the Patriots, so the game meant a little more to me than it usually would have.  The commercials blew, but Beyonce blewmy socks off!  That girlshes the next Whitney Houston, I tell ya.  Cept not Whitney.  You understand.  Afterwards, I stayed up to watch the  Survivor: All Stars  and the late edition news to find out what the hell happened with Janets titty bomb.  Finally fell asleep at 1:30am.  Crazy Joe.  Crazy and stupid Joe.    One last piece of info. for the day:   urlLink Mary-Ellis Bunim (co-creator of The Real World/Road Rules) has died .  I have to admit, this hurts almost as much as Nell Carter.    Now I must get through the rest of my day as quickly as possible.    I plan on climbing immediately into Pauls bed upon arrival at his apartment.  It will be there that he will serve me dinner.    It will be there that I will die until tomorrow.    It will be there that zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

       Nelly + Taxi Cab Hike + John Kerry = My Life   Where to begin?  I was watching the local news last night and was pretty bummed to find out that the taxicab commission in NYC has gotten approval to increase their starting fare.  Usually it costs $2 just to get IN a cab.  Now, it will cost you $2.50.  If you want to take a cab during rush hour on the weekdays, the fair gets another $1 slapped on to it.  So, lets summarize, shall we?  If you get in a cab at 4:30pm on a Wednesday and ask to go 30 blocks uptown, understand that before the driver pulls away from the curb, you will pay $3.50.  Now THAT seems fair.  But I guess if the cost of everything else goes up in NYC, so should the cab fares.  Wish my salary went up as often as everything else does.  Johnny boy (!) my new President.    Last night I saw MTVs Choose Or Lose special on would-be president John Kerry.  While I was exhausted and really didnt want to stay up any longer, I forced myself to sit through the brief half hour special on the Democratic candidate.  I have to admitI was highly impressed.  While he danced around quite a few major issues and never really took a stance on anything, I was impressed to see that he is a kind and smart man with a wonderful sense of humor.  In my opinion, if you want to know what hes REALLY about, dont watch MTV, watch the news.  But in any case, I was pleased to see him address the issue of gay marriage as well as the fact that most people that will vote for Kerry will do so on an ABB basis.  ABB = Anybody But Bush.    Kerrys hope is that the voters will not pick him based solely on the fact that Bush is his competition.  Until last night, my feeling was the same as many other Americans.  I am DONE with Bush and want him out immediately, but I want to have a  reason  for voting for the other party.  Kerry does offer me that reason and I honestly feel like he will be the person that will bring the younger voters in  our next generation of leaders.  So as long as all you non-voters go to the ballot box, we will be free of Bushs bullshit forever!    Funny, since I made the mistake of voting for Bush during the last election.  Yet, what were my options?  Gore?  It really didnt matter.  We were due for four years of garbage no matter how you looked at it.    So John Kerrymy hat is off to you.  You get my support and you get it with confidence.  I trust him.  Something tells me to do so.  I believe he will be the candidate that will allow our nation to grow as a unified whole.    Now, Nelly.  And by Nelly (who Im usually not into), I mean, band-aid wearing, hot black guy that raps about it being hot in herre.  You know him, we all know him, and now I want him as my own.  Last night I had a dream.  Similar to Martin Luther King, except I didnt nail anything on a church door when I was finished.  Ok yeah I did, but it didnt have the same effect.  In the dream I am sleeping in my bed.  My bedroom door was locked and I was watching TV.  Much like my usual routine as I go to bed.  Suddenly, Kelly knocks on my door.  I roll over and try to go to sleep, not in the mood to answer the door.  She continues to knock and knock and knock and I start to feel as though I should let her in.  As I am mulling this over, she unlocks my door and comes in.  I am immediately irritated and I say to her Kelly, you dont just WALK into my room when the door is locked.  She responds I have a visitor to see you.  I spit back Kelly, no visitors, Im in bed!    The door opens and Kelly moves to the side so Nelly can enter.  I immediately sit up and am like OMG.  Hi Nelly.  How are you?    Kelly leaves and shuts the door behind her.  Nelly walks over to my bed and sits down.  He is wearing a greenish t-shirt and cool jeans.  He crosses one leg and begins to ask me how my day was and what I want to do for the evening.  Without hesitation, I realize that Nelly and I are actually in a relationship and he came over to check on me.    He looked devastatingly handsome.  In fact, he looked more than devastatingly handsome; he looked more beautiful than any man I have ever seen.  As the dream continued, I started to ask myself some very odd questions.    1)	Why was I dating a black man?  I had never done that before and it still seemed kind of odd as I am usually not attracted to guys of color.    2)	Why was I dating ANOTHER skinny guy?  I had resolved in my head that after Paul, I was NOT going to date skinny ever again.  It just doesnt do anything for me.  3)	How LONG have Nelly and I been dating?  I felt clueless as to the factors surrounding our relationship.  Above all of these questions, the thing that stood out to me the most was that I felt so happy and fulfilled for the first time in a while.  I felt sexually charged and relaxed.  I wanted Nelly to wrap his arms around me and to hold me for as long as both of us needed.  It was a feeling that I dont get with Paul, nor have I gotten with any guy I have ever been with.  As soon as I started to notice and enjoy this feeling, it was gone.  I was ripped from the dream and left empty.  Obviously there is no obvious meaning to this dream.  A couple of years ago, I had a dream about P-Diddy that made my legs quiver and I had a crush on him for a month or so (sick, I know).  I figure that this Nelly thing will be just about the same.  The only real difference between the two dreams is how I felt sitting next to Nelly.  There was nothing physical, no chance at hooking up, just an overall feeling of satisfaction.    How do I find that in my real life?  Definitely something to ponder after I vote for John Kerry and take a cab home.

       Do you know what she did?  Your cunting daughter?   Its FRIDAY!    YAHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!  I really dont have that much going on this weekend.  Have to run a bunch of errands and have to play my new videogame  see  urlLink The Suffering .  Other than that, I am going to try to find a way to enjoy the nice weather.  Maybe bring my book (see-  urlLink The Davinci Code ) to the river tomorrow afternoon and relax for a bit.  Ooohthat sounded like such a wonderful idea when I wrote it.  But odds are I will end up lying in my bed with my dick between my legs.  Last night I rolled around in my bed with my lil guy Jimbo.  He and I have become incredibly close over the last few months.  He is so fucking cute that when hes near me I turn into a puddle of gobbery goo goo daddy goo.  Gobble goo.  Paul remarked on how well Jim knows me.  When he would go to pick him up, Jim would scamper away and crawl inside the crook of my arm.  He would then peek his head out at Paul and then bury himself away in my arm again.  It was super really awesome really hella great cute.  I love him and am actually looking FORWARD to going home and loving on him for a couple of hours.  Umcan anyone say  urlLink The Apprentice ?  LOVE it.  I was so nervous last night because I thought that my little  urlLink Nicholas  was going to get fired.  I ultimately believe that Amy will win the job, but that Nickyhe is so fucking cute that it makes my legs quiver.  The show rocks and I eat up every second of it.  Paul tends to talk a lot through the show and I actually had to tell him to Shut his gay mouth a bunch of times.  He then proceeded to tickle me ad nauseum.    Did you like the way I used the phrase ad nauseum?  I learned it recently and I vowed to use it whenever I could.  I never knew it was spelled AD nauseum.  Thats PRETTY cool.  I love you, you ridiculous English language.  What else, what else  I guess not much.  I had a fart this morning that was boiling hot.  I think it burned the back of my leg.  I now have a blister there and when it pops it will smell like eggs.  Yumfree breakfast!  Alright yallenjoy whatever it is you got planned.  You best expect that this hot bitch will!    Smooches!  And also  Booches.

       The FAT of It   Last night I was watching the local news, which has become my new favorite thing by the way, and they did a special on a new diet craze.  At first I was pretty excited as I am always looking for a new and creative way to shed a few excess pounds.    I was introduced to  urlLink My Pet Fat .   Upon first glance, my pet fat looks pretty cute and lovable.  I mean its like a little friend that you can carry around in your back pocket.  I immediately wanted to buy one for everyone I knew.  But as the news story continued, I became increasingly grossed out and ultimately offended.  And as we know, it takes A LOT for me to become either grossed out OR offended.    My pet fat is actually a plastic blob that is supposed to represent the fat gunk that resides in your legs, ass, or in my case, the mid-section.  The blob is yellow and looks like the fat particles you pulled out of that frog you dissected in 11th grade.  It is absolutely disgusting.  The best (worst) part is that the yellow fat has bloody veins running through it to remind you that what you are looking at is essentially your own body.  The purpose of this product?  To remind you that when you are shoving Snickers Bars and Donuts in your face, those delicious treats are eventually going to become your own Pet Fat, cept it will be resting idly on your body.  This product is supposed to gross you out and remind you that you shouldnt be eating anything that tastes good.  The idea itself is not totally ridiculous.  I mean, some people might really like to buy the 1 ounce Pet Fat to leave at their computer; its beedy eyes staring at you every time you take a bite of that greasy (wonderful) cheese pizza.  I am sure that if I had a 5 pound glob of lipids in my lap, I might vomit everything that I put in my mouth.  So you seepet fat could really work.  If youre into that sort of thing.  The end of the news segment is what really pissed me off.  On top of advertising this repulsive product, the reporter included various clips of obese people walking around the city.  And yes, they showed their faces.  In the background the voiceover was saying something to the effect of If this is you, you may really want to consider buying yourself a pet fat.  The summer is coming and its time to put on those bathing suits.  The best way to look good in that suitcarry a pet fat with you as the constant reminder of how lazy your eating habits have become.  Excuse me?  Im sorry, but in my opinion, its about fucking time that we lay off the weight issue.  I mean, McDonalds is cutting out their Super Size meals because America is too fat.  Airplane services try to charge overweight people two fares because they claim the seats arent big enough for their ass.  Atkins, The South Beach Diet, liquid diets, Trimspafucking enough!    Truthfully, obesity is the number one most preventative killer in the United States. But does that mean that America has to go to great lengths to make overweight people feel  bad  in the process?  Carrying a few extra pounds sucks for the individual as it is; combined with the fact that everyone else can see their issue as its displayed prominently on their body.  They have no way of hiding this problem.    I want everyone to mind their own fucking business.  Its not like overweight people dont KNOW that they are on the heavy side.  Its not like overweight people are ENJOYING being on the heavy side either.  Lets take a collective agreement to let people be the way they are.  If overweight individuals want to lose weight, let them do it on their own.  Lets stop making judgments on everything and everybody.  Lets stop criticizing.  Its like none of us can be happy unless we point out the misfortune of others.  It makes me sick.  Sicker than when I was looking at My Pet Fat.    Now, time to go plunk down $100 so I can have the  urlLink  biggest pet fat  available!  Hes going to look so cute dressed up as a sailor on Easter.

       ImImIm just being honest.   Is it wrong that every day for more than an hour, I bring my blanket and pillow and sleep in the student lounge with all of the other kids sitting around me studying algebra, thermonuclear dynamics, and philosophy?   Is it also wrong that when I wake up, I yawn and stretch my bones as though working at my job is one of the hardest and most physically demanding jobs I could take in this city?    And lastly, is it totally inappropriate for me to lay there, with Jewish kids around me, imagining musclemen whisking me away to a land of rough, yet passionate sex?  Eh.  Just wondering.  Cuz its my life.  This week has been pleasantly uneventful.  The weather is finally getting nicer, my co-workers moods have improved (slightly) and my apartment looks so beautiful bathed in the glow of warm sunshine.  Makes me want to walk around singing Pinks God is a DJ.  And I hate Pink.  Unless its a pink vagina.  Now THAT I can get down with.  (running to the bathroom to vomit)  Ok, now that Ive wiped my mouth of the excess puke, I can think about more important issues.  Like, well, why does Jessica Simpson have a man face?  And if she does have a man face, does that mean that Nick Lachey is gay?  And if THATS the case, does he really mean to be married to me?  Or how come Ryan Seacrest is 5 inches tall?  It seems to me that every time I switch on my TV, he gets littler and littler until he is SO yiddle that all of the 14 year old American Idol Contestants are bigger and stronger than he will ever be!  Theres also the plaguing dilemma of Rudy Huxtable in that Chingy video!  I meanscaring me Rudy.   Maybe, instead, I will discuss the difference between poop and pee.  You see, poop consists of a solid while pee consists of a liquid.  No, that cant be right.  My poop is often classified as a liquid.  They do come out of different holes though and that is very important in discussing the truth behind the poop and the pee.  But is a stream of yellow corn and one is stream of peas and carrots.  But both taste like vegetables and are good for you.  On the other hand I think tha  Gotta go.

       The Last 36 Hours   Over the last 36 hours I have had quite a few random experiences.    It all started on a stormy St. Patricks Day evening.  I met up with my friends Angie and Mariah and my little ghoulie Paul was there.  We had some drinks and played some music and danced around like idiots.  Finally at 10pm we decided that we couldnt spend the whole evening inside.  I mean, it was St. Paddys day after all.    We trudged out into the cold and hiked our way to the  Boiler Room  .  Once there we downed a few vodka tonics and played a few games that I learned in acting class.  Anyone up for a round of BUZZZZZZZ?  The crowd was lifeless and lame, so we THEN decided to go over to  Urge  for one more round of green vodka.    Upon walking in the door, I noticed a familiar face sitting at the bar.  I glanced at him a few times and I kept thinking, Thats  urlLink Randyboy !  I just know itthat looks like my old friend  urlLink Randyboy !  I turned to my friends for confirmation and Paul was like No way.  Thats not him.  But I just felt that it was, so I turned once again to that familiar Randy face and mouthed Are you Randy?  His face looked confused, so I marched right up to him and asked him up close.  Are you RRRRANDY?  (Always trilling my Rs)  His face lit up and we proceeded to have hot passionate sex on the floor of the bar.    Well, the clothes stayed on and the tongue within the confines of our own mouths, but it was pure joy seeing him.  The last time that Randy and I were in the same place, it was about two years or so ago.  My friend Rita and I met him at a bar, while he was visiting from Chicago.  He was a faithful reader of my journal and I always liked what he had to say.  We seemed to click really well.  That night at the bar was a blast, but in typical Joe style, I threw the wall up and never returned his calls.  Now that our paths have crossed again, Im sincerely hoping that he and I will become fast friends.  As we decided, hes supplies the gay boys; I supply the entertainment of lipstick lesbian hotness.  It all works out in the end.  So to my  urlLink Randyboy :  Lesbee friends!  Very much looking forward to hanging out with you soon.  After a couple of drinks, we left the bar so that Paul could make us all English muffin pizzas.  They were burnt, but kinda good.    Yesterday I decided to invite my old friend Mark (from Albany) to visit me in NYC.  Mark is someone that I kind of dated a few times at the end of last year and we have kept in touch since then.  Paul doesnt want me hanging out with him because he has a super good body and treats me like a princess.  Its not that Im cheating on Paul by having Mark downwe never hook up.  The most we do is hug a little and lay in bed with our t-shirts and shorts on.  Very G rated.    So Mark showed up at my place and we drank some wine and talked about our lives.  It was really wonderful seeing him in person again.  When he wraps his big arms around me, it makes me feel uniquely differently than I do with Paul.  Its not like Im falling for Mark or anything, but(heavy sigh)hes definitely a breath of fresh air in my otherwise stuffy world.  Mark and I ate some pizza and watched a movie and slept for about 3 hours.  He left promptly at 9am and then I came to work.  Feeling a little out of sorts, but also really satisfied.  Nice combo for once.  Upon arriving at work,  urlLink Ari  and I ordered some breakfast from the local deli.  I took a huge dump and then we left to pick it up.  Right before we walked out with our bounty, I looked in the window and noticed that  urlLink Dan Futterman  was sitting there.  Who is  urlLink Dan Futterman  you may ask?  Wellclick on his picture and you will see!  He was very very adorable sitting in the window reading a script and drinking his coffee.  I hope to one day say to him I think its very cool that we are in the same movie.  Especially since I have been stalking you since that day in the deli.  You didnt know I was there, but I knew you were there and I blew my load on myself.  Glad we can be actors together.   urlLink Ari  was upset that we didnt give him our boobies when we had the chance.  I was upset too.  Other than that, my 36 hours have been a cake walk.  Sometimes I hide in my bedroom for days, only emerging to piss and shit and occasionally brush my teeth.  Other days, I run into my Randyboy, have an encounter with a past flame, and rub elbows with the acting elite.  Now back to my bed.    Have a great weekend everyone!

       I Answer Your Questions    For my entry today, I have decided to go through my old emails in my CuttheShit account and to answer some of the questions that have been asked of me.  I tend to be really lazy when it comes to email correspondence, so I thought that by posting my answers, I would at least be doing something half ass, rather than no ass.   When did you realize that you were gay?   I first knew that I was gay when I was in 8th grade.  It suddenly occurred to me that when I thought about Arnold Schwarzenegger, my dick would spring to life.  I remember specifically picturing a woman and having my dick go lifeless.  Then picturing Arnies hulking body my dick would become rigid all over again.  Now, to be honest, I didnt think I was Gay.  I thought that I was normal; just not normal enough to discuss my desires with anyone else.  As time progressed, I just hoped and prayed that I would start to like girls like everyone else instead of the array of boys in the weight room.  It didnt happen that way and I finally came out the closet when I turned 21.   If you could be anything besides an actor, what would it be?   Honestly, there is NOTHING else I would want to be.  Whether I make it big in my 20s, 30s or 70s, I dont think that I will ever pursue anything else as a career.  The acting bug is ingrained in me and I dont have much of a desire to be anything, but a performer.  The biggest fear I have is that I will be 75 years old and still an administrative assistant.  I refuse to take on a new career until I have made major leaps with this one.   Why are you still with Paul?   Paul and I have been together for over four years.  Not a day goes by when I wonder if we are supposed to be together.  This is conveyed in every post I do and in every conversation that I have with the closest people in my life.  Paul is a wonderful person and has a lot to offer, but Im unsure if what he has to offer is what I need.  I find myself sad a lot with Paul because I know that if we break up, there is a very distinct possibility of me losing him entirely.  I guess I keep hoping that by holding out, things will just get better.  There is a lot more to this story, but not having Paul is my life is the biggest inhibitor to me making that change.   What is your favorite thing to do in New York City?   My most favorite thing to do in New York City has to be sitting outside at a restaurant with a glass of wine in one hand and a cigarette in the other.  I could take or leave the food, no matter what restaurant we are at.  Chilling with a friend on a beautiful New York afternoon, sun shining, both of us laughing, smoke coming from our nostrilsits a beautiful thing really.  I am muchly looking forward to Spring.   When I come visit, can I stay with you?   No.   If you could live anywhere else in the world, where would it be?   If I could live anywhere in the world, it would be on the beach in California.  I have been having a major gnawing at my insides to move out West.  I dont think Im ready for that kind of change yet, but it is definitely in the cards for my future.  I love New York.  Always will.  But I prefer the warmth and I prefer cars to public transportation.  Mostly I just want to be in a place that is a bit more relaxed that the bitter, fast paced lifestyle of New York City.  I thrive on being busy and do my best work when stress is involved.  However, I dont enjoy the stress when it involves going to the corner food mart to get a soda.  Everything here is a hassle.  An addicting hassle, but a hassle nonetheless.   Are you angry at your brother for joining the army?   I wouldnt say that I am angry WITH my brother, but I am definitely angry at the situation.  While my posts dont always reflect my respect for the US ARMY, I definitely have it instilled in me.  My father served in the ARMY Reserves for over 25 years and he always taught his children about the importance of the military.  Some days it gets a little too hard for me.  Hence my post yesterday.  But most times I am overly proud and in awe of what people like my brother do on a daily basis.  The selfish side of me wants my brother back for me.  He and I are incredibly close and not having him near me over the last couple of years has definitely taken its toll on my heart.  I just want him back.  We can discuss the ARMY and his role in it after that.     Are you going to close down your journal?   Not just yet!  I will give ample notice, I promise.  OK!  Thats it for today.  I hope I didnt offend anyone by answering these questions in a public format, but I kept everyone anonymous so that it was something we could all share equally.  I appreciate the email feedback I get and hope that everyone understands that I am truly horrible with correspondence of any kind.  Ask any of my friends who live out of town (please dont bother my friends).  Have a great day yall!  Much much love and respect.

       Winfield   My brother called yesterday and we spoke on the phone for almost an hour.  There isnt that much going on with me at my job this week, so I was really able to give him my full attention, which he truly deserves during every phone call.  I was hoping I would hear from him yesterday and like he could read my mind, the phone rang at 2:30pm and we got to have our talk.  Overall, my brother is in very high spirits.  He has handled his tour in Baghdad with such grace and positivity.  It always astounds me that he has such strict control over his emotions.  I can barely keep a smile on my face for one full day and I live in NYC with my friends and crack whores all around me.  But Winfield very rarely cries about being in Baghdad.  Yesterday, he even told me that he is so happy that he has been able to have the experience of being in a war.  It has given him quite a lot of perspective.  It was at this point that he and I discussed his future career with the military.  When I was in Syracuse this weekend, I had the opportunity to discuss my brothers return from Baghdad with Ritas mother.  She has quite a bit of personal experience in this area as Ritas dad has been in the service for over 25 years.  He has been all over the world and as she told me this weekend that they have encountered many obstacles once he returned from his tour of duties.  Expect Winfield to be kind of cold upon his arrival.  It will be hard for him to return to normal life after being submersed in a war zone for over a year.  It felt so good being able to get advice from someone who actually knows what it is like to be in this type of situation.  During the conversation with my brother, we mostly discussed our plans for his visit in May.  He wants to do everything, from seeing Broadway plays to sitting around watching corny TV.  Once I found a lull in the conversation, I asked him about his future in the ARMY.  Usually my brother responds I am done as soon as I get out in May.  I cant wait for this whole thing to be over and to be able to pursue a different path.  However, yesterday he said the opposite.  I dont know what I want to do yet.  Im thinking that I could remain in the military and pursue a different path with them.  I about lost my shit.  Now, with all due respect, my brother has achieved quite a bit during his short time in the service.  He moves up in the ranks very quickly and he has always been at the top of his class.  As was written a couple months ago in this journal, he has even been nominated for a Bronze Star.  He must be doing GREAT things there for this to have happened.  The second he mentioned continuing with the military, we launched into a very in depth conversation about the effects of this kind of decision on both his girlfriend and family.  While my brother thinks that he needs to do what he needs to do, I was very clear in reminding him that his decision does not effect him alone.  He has always done what he thinks he needs to do, without any regard for the consequences on those that love him.    I explained that while we may never know what it was really like for him to be in Baghdad, he will never know what it was like for all of us to be here; worrying and crying and freaking out every day over the fact that he is in consistent danger.  In my opinion, his life may be more physically dangerous, but our lives have been emotionally crippled by his choices.    It will be impossible for me to ever understand a personal calling such as his.  I feel the same type of calling, but its for performance, and it doesnt worry my family that I would be killed in my pursuit of this dream.  While I may wholeheartedly disagree with his thought process in continuing with the military, I will always be here to support whatever decision he makes.  BUT, I will put him through emotional hell before that happens.  And I will enforce the fact that he and I will never be as close as we could be if he made the choice to get out.    I drove my point home yesterday and I know he heard me loud and clear.  Stay in the military if that is what you wish, but the daily support will not be as powerful and understanding as it is now.  My parents are VERY strong in their resolve to see him out of the ARMY.  When I called my mom to tell her about my conversation with my brother, she was like He does not want to come home and tell me that he is staying in the service.  Ill kill him.  While this may seem a bit ludicrous to some people, I agree with her completely and will do whatever I can to keep him out.  Ultimately supporting him in his decision the best I can.    Not everyone is cut out for the military lifestyle.  My brother is good at everything he does.  He has talents that have yet to be explored.  For him to continue in the same vein only limits his talents and leaves all of us in constant fear.  By the end of the conversation, I could tell that he was happily influenced by my words.  Sometimes its hard to remember that you have a life that is very fragile back home.  Sometimes its hard to forget where your priorities really lie.   All I can do at this point is to be as understanding as I can be.  But the truth of the matter is, he better not decide to stay in.  We will ALL be against that decision and it will tear our family further apart.    I am excited, but also filled with anxiety about his impending visit.  Who will he be?  How will he act?  What decisions will he have already made?    I pray to God, cuz thats the only thing I really know how to do.    God will take care of it and will lead my brother in the right direction.  I can only hope that he will soften our hearts to this in the process.

       A Wonderful Weekend That Ended In A Nightmare    This weekend I was an honorary woman at my best friend Ritas wedding shower.  Picture 25 women and me  the superGAYstar of the group.  To be honest, I thought that I was going to feel more uncomfortable than I did.  In fact, I loved being the only guy.  The girls totally treated me like a man (despite the amount of estrogen) and I really felt super special.    I was the one that got to help Rita open her presents.  I was the one who held the pole during the piata game.  I was the one that spent the most time with Ritas family.  And I was the one that Rita would look at to find that feeling of home.  At one point I pulled her aside and I said Usually I would need you to reaffirm my friendship with you and its importance during this type of event, but this time I feel it automatically.  I feel like its happening to you and I at the same time.  I feel it and I couldnt be happier than I am right now.  Ritas sister, Jeannie, planned the most amazing wedding shower.  It was catered by  urlLink Dinosaur BBQ  which supplied delicious pulled pork sandwiches.  I ate 4 within a couple of hours and boy did I enjoy every burp that I had for the rest of the afternoon!  Rita raked in some pretty incredible presents as well.  It made me totally want to get married.  I mean, I could SO use a new set of wooden spoons.    I took my friend Angie with me on the trip.  She and Rita have known each other for a couple of years and I thought it would be good for her to get out of the city for awhile.  Well, I didnt expect her to get along with everyone as well as she did.  I mean, she was without a doubt the star of the weekend.  She had the best jokes, the best hugs, and made it comfortable not only for me to spend time with everyone alone, but as a group as well.  At one point, Ritas family started chanting Angie for President 2004!  I cant tell you how proud I was to have her by my side.  If I needed anything, Angie was there with support.  From talks to favors I needed, she never complained once.  In fact, she obliged with nothing but love.  Muchly impressed with her.  I also got fitted for my  urlLink Tux !  It looks SO handsome and I could see the joy all over Ritas face.  The wedding is in 7 weeks and I couldnt be more excited.  Her wedding dress is the best I have ever seen.  Simple, yet SO elegant.  If it werent for her fianc, I think that she and I would look AMAZING standing next to each other at the alter.  Except for the no sex on the honeymoon part.    Too short of a weekend for my tastes, but arent they all?  Last night when I got home, I immediately climbed into bed with Paul.  We had some nice talks and laughs and shoved our faces with pounds of Italian food.  Maybe it was the amount I ate before bed or it was the fact that I have so much swirling around my mind, but in any case, this is what I dreamed:  My parents, friends and I were hanging out in my house.  I was trying to feed the hamsters when I noticed that they were multiplying.  (You may recall that I had a similar dream to this a couple of months ago)  There were the cutest little babies and I remember my mom and me playing with them for what seemed like hours.  But thenthe inevitablethey started coming out of my closets and out from under my bed and they began to bite me over and over.   My parents and I ran away from them and got into the car.  Along the trip I became enraged with anger.  It felt like an intense burning in my stomach that I couldnt release in any way other than with physical brutality.  I began kicking the door from inside the car.  It wouldnt break off so I began screaming at my mother while repeatedly kicking at the hinges of the door.  I remember wishing that I could cry and release the anger that way, but it was physically impossible.    Eventually I broke the door off the car and got out.  I then turned around and began kicking the doors to my parents car inward.  My mother was screaming for me to stop and I continued to let the fury out threw kicking.  It was awful.  The whole time I was dreaming I tried to make myself calm down, but couldnt.   When I woke up at 5am this morning, I was covered in sweat and shaking.  I immediately lit a cigarette and sat there trying to erase the dream from my head.  When I fell back to sleep, I noticed that the hamsters were still multiplying in my head and the dream began all over again.    My alarm went off at 7:30am this morning and I just laid there upset.    Why am I so subconsciously angry?    It definitely gave me a lot to think about today.    Especially after having such a beautifully calm weekend with my best friends.

       Rolling Eyes Emoticon   There are two people in my office today.  My boss and me.  Everyone else is either out on vacation or home sick.  Its quite nice to have absolute silence in the work place, but I have to admit that Im also tremendously bored.  Theres only so much playing a girl can do!  I wasnt going to go out for Mariahs birthday event last night, but at the last minute decided that I had to push myself through it.  I showed up at  urlLink Pop Burger  at 9:30pm and for the next two hours fit in as many conversations with old friends as I could.  It was quite productive as far as catching up with people goes.  If you have never been to Pop Burger before, you must understand that the front of the restaurant looks like an extra hip McDonalds.  The back part is a lounge/bar.  Its totally Metrosexual, which makes me cringe with irritation, but a very chill and laid back crowd overall.  The cheeseburgers are mini-sized and taste like heaven.  Well, if heaven were made of cheeseburgers.    At one point, I am sitting talking to my friend Joanna, when Kelly comes out of nowhere, puts her hands around my throat and shoves me against the wall.  Now, this may seem a little violent to the average reader, but as soon as Kelly did that, I looked at her and said What now?!?! (Knowing that someone or something huge had just happened. - See, Kelly and I communicate via grabbing each other by the throat.  You understand.)    She looks at me with huge eyes and says Ahmad is on a date with a guy in the restaurant next door.  I was like BOH!?  I immediately threw my jacket on, made sure Paul was out of sight, and hightailed it out the front door with her.  Kelly, being the gem that she is, went in to the restaurant and pulled Ahmad from his date.  I talked with him for about 10 minutes, the whole time him saying how SO OVER ME HE IS.  We made tentative dinner plans for the next couple of weeks.  But I still believe that if you have to tell someone that you are over them, you clearly arent.    He did look good.  Very solid and pumped up.  However, I just dont get the fire for him anymore.  He is a sweet kid and always treated me with nothing, but respect.  Yet, I dont feel any sort of chemistry with him any more.  Also, the guy he was on the date with?  YIKERIFF!  When his date looked away, I looked at Ahmad and I go Umno.  Ahmad and I laughed at the fact that he was on a date with a nasty gay boy and then he left with him.  Figures.    I left with Kelly around 11:30pm so that I could get some sleep before the big weekend of Ritas wedding shower.  Mariah walked in to the apartment at 1am and told me that Paul was completely missing.  She and my friend Angie had put him in a cab and paid for his ride home a half hour earlier.   Of course they had to peel his drunk ass off the ground before doing so.  But when she arrived at home and Paul wasnt there, we both started to panic.   He walked in around 3:30am.  When I woke up this morning I asked him where he was all night.    This was our brief conversation:  Me:  Where WERE you all night? Paul:  I have no idea at all. Me:  Did you go back out to another bar by yourself? Paul:  No I walked home when Mariah left. Me:  No you didnt.  You fell on the ground and hit your head and Mariah and Angie put you in a cab and sent you home. Paul:  Then why was I walking for hours? Me:  Thats the whole point.  Why did you get out of the cab and then just walk for hours?  It doesnt make any sense to me.  You went to another bar. Paul:  I have no idea where I was or what happened. Me:  So you are saying that you lost two hours of your life.  You have no way of figuring out what happened between 1-3am? Paul:  I have no idea at all. Me:  You know who else loses hours of their life after falling down and slamming their head on the pavement? Paul:  Who? Me:  Alcoholics.  Then I left for work.  Ill deal with that sorry shit on Sunday.  Im REALLY glad to go to Syracuse this weekend.  I definitely need some time away from this whole scene.  It will feel so good to be in the open fresh air of Suburbia USA!  Nice change of pace.  Get ready Rita!    Im on my way!

       What a Difference a Day Makes   So yesterday when I left work, I was remarking on how things seemed to be going very smoothly in my life. I mean, chaotic as fuck, but no real surprises.  Since everything has been so nuts over the last month or so, I was happy to have a couple weeks without wondering how my apartment burned down or why the cat was speaking English.  You knowno real surprises.  Well, then I got home from work yesterday.  I walked into my brand new, beautiful apartment, to find that my little guy Jimbo wasnt in his cage.  I tore his home apart looking for him and then noticed that one of the tubes that connect to his cage had become dislodged and fallen to the floor.  Jim had escaped.  My heart stopped in my chest and I kept thinking Why?  WHY is this happening?  Jim is the hamster love of my life.  He is so smart and kind and gentle.  He is also very generous with local charities.  Hes the total package really.  Upon noticing that he escaped, I prepared myself for the worst.  I hadnt been home in a couple of days, so I was positive that he was dead. It was only a matter of finding the body.  I lifted up my bed, tore apart my closet, and had a long talk with our cat, Trey.  I was sure that if I couldnt find Jims body, Trey would have stashed his corpse somewhere in Kellys bedroom.  So I looked there for a while too.  Then I just started to get really upset.  Tears started to fill my eyes and I realized that Jim was just gone.  One day there, next day gone.  I lay on my bed with no TV or radio playing and I just thought about where he could be.  THEN!  I heard his little squeaking.  I jumped up and ran over to my dresser.  Underneath, I found little Jim cowering in the corner.  He was shaking and making peep like sounds.  I reached my hand in and he immediately walked into my palm.  THANK GOD!  I noticed too that he had fashioned some sort of makeshift bed under there.  How LONG was he out and running around?  Who knows.  I cuddled him and loved him for hours before putting him back in his cage.  I immediately removed the faulty tube and secured the rest of his cage.  No more disappearing acts.  Im not going to lose ANOTHER hamster due to my irresponsibility.  Now, aside from that, I received a phone call this morning from my friend Mariah.  She was EXTREMELY upset and crying.  I told her to calm down and to tell me the whole story.  Detail by detail.  She explained that her girlfriend of 7 months has been cheating on her with like everyone in the city.  Not only has she been fucking her ex-boyfriend, but just last week she engaged in a threesome with a friend of hers and a random dude.  Um.  AIDS anyone?  Now, the reason why this is SO fucked up is because Mariah was at the hospital a week ago with some unknown virus.  They quarantined both she and her girlfriend and asked them numerous questions about their sexual activity; to gather as much information as possible.  Even as that situation became increasingly more intense, Mariahs girlfriend lied straight to the doctors and said that she hadnt been with anyone other than Mariah.  Fucking liar.  And also, fucking WHAT?  Mariah was SO ill!  In any case, there is a hunt out for the head of Mariahs EX-girlfriend.  It should be easy to track her down, considering that she has fucked everyone in the state of NY.  I cant believe this shit.  Poor Mariah.  And to top it all off, its her birthday today.  Lastly, my boss told us this morning, via email, that he will be leaving our office tomorrow and never returning.  There is a whole lot of shit going on at my job and this kind of move was expected, but not prepared for at all.  There was chaos with everyone running around trying to figure out what to do if he actually does leave.   Turns out, he misspoke in his email and hes not leaving after all.  AH GEEZ!  So much for no surprises, huh?  With this kind of shit swirling around my head, I am SO glad to grab my friend Angie and to head upstate to spend time with my Rita at her wedding shower.    Calgon?    Yeah thats right.  Bitch, take me away.

       What do you get when you cross an archer with a gift-wrapper?   Well,  Ribbon Hood  of course!    Wasnt I surprised when I woke up this morning to find it snowing outside my bedroom window.  UmI thought it was March and that the temperature in NYC on Saturday was 63 degrees.  But ok.  My parents made their annual We must decorate Joes apartment with brand new furniture trip this weekend.  They brought me a new TV stand, a beautiful bookcase, lots of groceries, and many other little trinkets that I needed.  My bedroom is now fully furnished and gorgeous.  They are so generous with their time and their money.  I am very lucky to be a 26 year old kid that still needs his parents to fix up his new pad.      I finally feel like the stress of moving is over.  Do you know how GOOD that feels?  Man, to have two weeks of your life in complete upheavalit makes it SO worth it when all is said and done.  I just love my new place.  So cute and pretty.  Just like me.  Cute and pretty.  This weekend is the wedding shower for my Siamese twin Rita.  I couldnt be more excited.  I am taking my friend Angie up for the visit and I expect to see all of my oldest and greatest friends.  Its going to be a busy and crazy weekend, but it is SURE to be filled with love and fun.  And hopefully with some major card playing.  I am SO overdue for that.  Also, the actual shower is happening in some sort of hall.  Like a room that you rent for big parties.  I just LOVE parties that take place in buildings like this.  Im so used to going to my friends apartments for parties that being able to go to an outside place is super exciting.   I saw some enjoyable movies this weekend.  One was  The Sweetest Thing   with Cameron Diaz.  Im not huge on romantic comedies, but this was one was a bit shocking at times and didnt totally bore me to death.  And I have to admit that I just love that Christina Applegate.  Shes supa good at everything she does.  Especially when the babysitter was dead.  The only thing that I couldnt figure out was how skinny, tiny Justin gets his little penis inside Amazon Woman Cameron.  It took me the whole movie to imagine all their different positions and I still couldnt get a clear picture.  Maybe its because his dick needs to be in my butt.  Huh.  Now THAT makes more sense.  I also saw the movie  Thirteen .  I just love that Holly Hunter.  She is supa sexy and talented.  The teen girls were pretty good too.  Overall I thought that the movie was made out to be more shocking that it really was.  I mean, did anyone see  Kids  or  Bully ?  Now THOSE are some shocking teen movies.  But overall, the story was decent and the acting was pretty good.  And I would definitely watch the first scene of the movie over and over.  I mean.   HIT ME AGAIN.  HARDER!  Booooooooowaaaaaaaaaahahahahahaha!  Yeah, that was fucked up.  So one funny thing that happened this weekend  My friend Angie rolled a huge blunt and brought it over to my place on Saturday night.  My moms eyes grew hugely wide and then she lit it up and smoked it.  Seeing her sitting on my bed with her ghetto lips wrapped around a blunt made me pee all over my new rug.  It was a sight that I will never forget.  Oh momyoure so HARD.  Core that is.  For some reason I miss my Paulie today.  He and I hung out last night, so its not like I havent seen him in a while.  But last night he made me laugh so hard and for so long that as soon as I woke up this morning, I wanted nothing more than to spend the day with him.  I am literally counting the hours until I get to his place tonight.  Its weird that after four years I can still have the same kind of addiction to him as I had when we first got together.  Most times I dont feel it as strongly as I do today.  But when I doit makes me feel all warm inside.    Well, lunch time is around the corner, which means that naptime is around the corner which means that I can get off my lazy ass and do something productive.  Sleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep.  Till tomorrow!

       Being Lucky   Well hello!  The chaos is slowly coming to a halt.  I can breathe again without my chest hurting.  My stomach doesnt feel as though its twisted up in a hundred knots.  And my muscles are finally starting to unkink themselves from carrying box after box after box down four flights of stairs.  The move was a pain in my ass, but it went smoothly and it is OVER.  Who could ask for anything more?  The new pad is looking mighty spiff!  We are in the midst of organizing and decorating and personally, I am loving every second of it.  My parents are coming to visit on Saturday and they are bringing a shit load of new furniture for me.  They even agreed to pay for it all as a housewarming gift.  They are so generous and wonderful to me all the time.  I am so lucky to be their son.  If it werent for them, I would be sleeping on shit covered rags in my brand new apartment.    Last night I chilled with  urlLink Ari  for a bit after work.  When I had to go home, guess what?  I walked!  She and I are now neighbors and I can walk home from her apartment!  WEIRD.  I havent had a neighbor friend since I moved into this city, so its pretty exciting to have one that is such a good friend of mine.  My most favorite part about the new apartment?  My bedroom.  Its very big and spacious and I could roll around naked on the floor all day.  If it werent for my squealing hamsters, I would probably get a good nights sleep as well.  Gonna have to let those little bastards go in the subway I think.  (Just so we are clear, I am not talking about Jim or Poopsie  they are my loves)  Last night I woke up to find Poopsie brutally murdering one of the other bastard hamsters that lives in his cage.  I scolded Pooper and told him to leave the other hammies alone.  He looked at me with the cutest eyes I have ever seen.  How could I resist?  I told him to beat the fuck out of whoever he wants and I will dispose of the body.  He owns me.  My least favorite part about the new apartment?  The fridge.  Its like mini size.  I mean, its a full fridge with a freezer and stuff, but its tiny size.  I tower over it by a good foot.  I didnt even know that they made fridges so baby sized.  Guess Im going to have to walk on my hands and knees all day to get used to it.  Not that Im not on my knees all day to begin with.  I mean please!  I blow everything I see.  But I never swallow.  Hork.  Th e sexiest part about the new apartment?  Well, me.  How could you be so ignorant as to even ask?  The smelliest part about the new apartment?  The litter box for the cat that lives with us.  But of course!  There are a ton of great looking restaurants in our area and I canna wait to try them all!  On our first day in the new pad,  urlLink Ari  ordered a pizza and soda and had it delivered to our place.  I mean, how AMAZING is she?  I ate every slice thinking how lucky I am to have a friend like her.   We also found another pizza place that serves super thin slices.  Its like eating pizza on a cracker except that it tastes like pizza and not crackers.  You understand.  And you love it.    So here we go!    A new apartment, a new lease on life, a new chance at starting over.    Bring it on baby.  Bring.  It.  On.  (its already been  BROUGHTEN !)

       Today for Lunch   Today for lunch, my friend Angie came up to where I work so that we could spend the hour together.  Most days I take a nap during lunch and it has become a time that I look forward to from the moment I wake up.  But today I knew that there was to be no nap.  I had to shove the sleep back into my body and have some fun with Angina.    Once Angie arrived, we went to the local market and got grilled cheese sandwiches.  The weather in NYC today is a tad chilly, but otherwise gorgeous.  I got a diet coke with my sandwich and Angie got a bottled water and  a bag of chips (which were eaten before we even left the store).  We smoked a cigarette and walked a block to local Riverside Park.  We found a comfortable grassy spot on the lawn overlooking the Hudson River.  Luckily there was few to no people at the park today.  Once situated, Angie sparked up her joint and we relaxed and smoked it down.  My stomach has been bothering me all day; I think mostly because of my anxiety and excitement about this weekend.  The J eased up the nausea and we lit up another cigarette to cap off the high.    Once baked, we talked about our lives and our friends and our relationships.  We discussed the wedding in full detail as she and Kelly will be joining Paul and me on the trip.  We just talked and talked with the sun beating down on our faces and the wind blowing a crisp breeze through our hair.  Angie immediately housed her grilled cheese sandwich and I nursed my diet coke.  I noticed a cop car driving through the park, but at this point we were just about finished smoking.  As the cops drove directly in front of us (their necks craning to get a good look at the druggies), Angie stubs the rest of the joint out and opens her bag of pot and puts it inside.   I was a bit stunned that she did this in front of the passing patrol car, but with her confidence and my ability to talk through the experience, we gave the cops no reason to bust our asses.  About 45 minutes into my lunch hour, the two of us smoked one more cigarette together and discussed her birthday.  We all had such an amazing time, regardless of the fact that some lesbians dont know how to handle their booze.  I wish every weekend could be as spontaneous and fun as this last one was.   We then cleaned up our area and walked out of the park.  A block later and I was kissing her on the cheek, saying goodbye.  Another successful lunch with Ange.  Having lunch with Angie today was so much better than taking a nap.  I feel a bit refreshed and my stomach certainly feels calmer.  I might even house that grilled cheese now.    Its been a beautiful day so far.  I can only hope it continues throughout the week.

       Drunken Perspectives   If you want another perspective on how the big Lesbian fight of last Friday went down, visit  urlLink NYC.TwentySomething !    Kelly wrote about the evening as well and it's interesting to see how another drunk person perceived the fight.    Otherwise, go fuck yourself.  No one said you HAD to read it.    Shit.   Some people are so fucking ungrateful.

       The Calm Before the Storm   Soooooooooooooooooooosew.  My best friend, Rita, is getting married on Saturday!  As each day gets closer, the knot of excitement in my stomach gets bigger and tighter.  I cant wait to see her and hug her and say goodbye to her single days.  Although she has only been engaged for a year, it seems as though she has been engaged for a lifetime.  She has been with her fianc for YEARS.  Like 80.  Its time for her to make the commitment and to start having me some babies.  This boy wants to be a Godfather like you wouldnt believe.  Rita is going to look so beautiful in her wedding dress.  She has the most beautiful red hair.  The good kind of red hairnot the transparent/do I even have pubes kind.  She asked me a while back if she should wear it up or down and I dont think she ever told me what she finally decided.  Either way, Im going to be hanging with her all day on Saturday getting ready for the big moment.  I am so happy to be a bridesmaid, its ridiculous.    No, I wont be wearing a dress.  What did youjust start reading this journal today?  This weekend will bring all of my best girls from school together.  As has been talked about numerous times in the past, our group consists of 5 girls and a Joe.  All 6 (notice how I included myself in that) are gorgeous and all 6 have amazing senses of humor.  While that may be the only similarities we all possess, its quite extraordinary that we work so well together.  Having the 56B (our little group nickname  based on our address in college when we lived together) girls together for any event is sure to be a memory filled, mind blowing good time.  Now, in order to go away for this wedding, I have a ton of shit I need to do.  I have a theatre meeting tonight.  I have to pack tomorrow, have dinner with my friend Mariah, make a ton of phone calls and at some point, eat a bagel.  The bagel is more important that it seems upon first reading.  Ok, no its not.  Paul has rented a car for the trip.  At first it was an economy style piece of bullshit.  Now, he has upgraded to a convertible Mustang because he feels that that is the only way that Joe and Paul travel.  While we were in Florida two years ago, we upgraded to a convertible Mustang and he hasnt gotten the taste of it out of his mouth yet.  Whatever makes him happiest.  Its been so nice to see how huge his smile has been lately.  Hes been so wonderfully cute these days.  I couldnt be happier.  Last night Paul asked where we were going on vacation this year.  He has mentioned it a few times in the last couple of months and I always kind of blow him off.  For the last two years I have planned every detail of our trips and on each trip, its been slightly less than good.  So this year I told him that if he wants to go anywhere on a trip, he needs to pick a place and plan it.  Who knows?  Maybe well go and maybe we wont.  But if not, Ive already been propositioned by an old flame of mine to go away for a long weekend at some point in July.  Heh heh heh.  Either way, I gots no money, so it will be a free trip, no matter who I go with.  Just have to wait and see on that one.  In any case, Ritas wedding is almost here!  I think I just blew my load by accident.  Now Im going to have to go to the bathroom and clean my ass up.  Unfortunate really, since I was planning on wearing these jeans to the wedding.  Ah well.    Rita will understand.  She always does.  BESOS!    Y  ABRAZOS!  Y  suck my cock.

       That Bitch Made Me Bleed On Myself!   Last Friday night was my friend Angies birthday.    Kelly, Mariah and I began the night by joining Angies parents for dinner at Carmines in Time Square.  I was very nervous going into the dinner based on past experiences with Angies parents.  Ive known Angie for years, but have never been allowed at her house or out to big events that her family is throwing for her.  Basically, Angies parents used to think that Kelly and I turned Angie gay and got her addicted to pot.  Needless to say, as far as I know, you cant MAKE someone gay.  Trust me, Ive tried.  In any case, Friday was supposed to be the first time that all of us sat down (civilly).    I brought Angies mom a bouquet of flowers to break the ice.  I think she really appreciated that.  We all ate dinner together and talked and talked and talked.  I had such an amazing time and by the end of the dinner I truly felt as though I was accepted by Angies family.  Its been a long time coming, but it has been worth the wait.  After dinner, the four of us (parents went back to their hotel) went over to Angies to open presents and get our drink on!  We left around 11pm to go to a bar called Stingy Lulus.  The bar was empty save for the crazy ass bartender who made shitty drinks with an attitude.  I honestly think she was on massive amounts of drugs, cuz she was a fucking nut case.    After depleting all of the fun out of Lulus, we went over to our regular dive hangout The Hole.  Since it was Friday night, the bar was full of lesbians.  Usually its gay men, but they have one lesbian night just to keep it all fair.  Well, we were drinking and dancing and smoking (yes, you can smoke both pot AND cigs in this bar  regardless of Bloombergs decision to kill the smokers good time) when all of a sudden, WW3 happened.    Paul pulls on my arm and says, We have to go now.  I look over and there is a psycho hosebeast lesbian yelling at Paul about how he bumped into her friend.  I look over at this friend and notice that she is so fucked up she can barely keep her eyes open.  The hosebeast kept screaming at Paul.  Now, usually Paul does cause the problem and we get thrown out because of him, but in this case, I saw most of what happened, and Paul was innocent.    I turned to the hosebeast and I say, Worry about your drunk ass friend and leave my boyfriend alone.  The bitch proceeds to scream and scream about how Paul bumped into her wasted friend.  She then walks over to me and I turn around and push her away from us with my shoulder.  Next thing I know, she launches her drink right in Pauls face.  Now Im fuming.  I turn to her and Im like What the FUCK do you think youre doing you ugly bitch?!  She starts screaming for us to get booted from the bar.  Eventually the bartender comes over and is like Get the fuck out of this bar!    Now Im livid.  I turn to the hosebeast and I call her a number of things.  Ie:  Ugly cunt bag, dyke bitch, fat ass.  Whatever I could think of to make her as angry as she possibly could be.  She then launches her nasty self at me, clawing and scraping at the sky.  I scream and call her names while she claws at my face.  At one point, she connected with my cheek and I turned to belt her in the face.  As I raised my hand to punch her, Kelly swiftly puts her arm around my chest and starts pulling me out of the bar.    We are in a group of 8 or 9 people and everyone starts screaming at this bitch as I am being literally thrown from the bar by Kelly.  As we get to the door, I look down at my hand and its covered in blood.  I turn to Kelly and I say That bitch made me bleed on myself!    Kelly sees the blood and freaks out.  She pushes me out the door and goes back to pound the girls face in.  Unfortunately, security stopped her before she could get to her.  We all stand outside waiting for everyone to catch up.  Im half laughing, half screaming about how much I hate that stupid girl and how much I love Paul for being the sane one for once.  If it werent for my friends, Im sure I would have ended up in jail that night for beating the fuck out of that he-she.  I am not a violent person by nature.  Im really not.  But after Ive been drinking and after some stupid bitch thinks she can get away with whatever she wants, just because shes a girlfuck that.  It would have been a huge mistake to hit herhugebut I should have hocked the biggest fucking loogie in her hair.  If only my initial anger hadnt clouded my otherwise mean and manipulative mean streak.   Dont EVER throw a drink in my boyfriends face.  EVER.  And dont ever call us names and demean us in a bar that WE are regulars at.  Please.  Whatever, it was such an ugly situation and Im so glad that its over and behind us.  The night ended very well.  We all went back to Pauls apartment and had more drinks and fun times, laughing over and over at the bitch that freaked out at the bar.  Overall Angie had a great birthday and Im glad I was able to be there for her.  I think it will be a while before Paul and I go with her to a lesbian bar again though.  Truth be told, lesbians are NASTY to gay men that enter their bar.  Paul and I get kicked out of lezzy bars all the time.  They hate playing second fiddle to us when were with our beautiful girlfriends.  Its easier to remove us from the bar, then to have to watch us hang with someone that they can never get.  And its not like we are going to tolerate any of their shit.  If you are going to step up to us in a barmake sure you get your shot in while you can.  Otherwise    WHATEVER.   Fucking lesbians.  I really gotta get me some gay guy friends.    Hanging out with these girls is going to get me killed.

       The Fall of Jerome   Please, like this post has anything to do with a guy named Jerome.  The title popped into my mind as I was thinking about this entry and I figured I had to use it.  Cuz I meanthe fall of Jerome!  The other day I was watching the news and they did a story on a five legged calf.  Now, this may not seem too strange as we know that nuclear waste can do anything out of the ordinary with just a little prayer and faith.  Anyway, there was this five legged calf and the strange part about it is that the fifth leg was casually tossed over the calfs back.  It was just relaxing there.  A relaxing fifth leg.  Immediately I thought that they should have removed that fifth leg cuz it was so lazy, but the farmers didnt do that.  They laughed and called the newspapers and said Come here and see the funniest thing.  A calf with a lazy fifth leg!  And I laughed.  In other newsas most everyone knows, I have two sets of hamsters.  I have Jimbo, my love, and three other mean and nasty dwarf hamsters.  The dwarfs live in the same cage and are constantly bickering over one thing or another.  I havent cleaned their cage in three weeks and when I got home yesterday, they looked at me with the saddest, most pleading eyes.  Please help us escape our filth!  In any case, I went to pick them up, cuz they looked so cute all covered in shit and piss.  As I cupped one of them in my hand, the other two snarled and latched their teeth on to my thumb.  Two sets of teeth on one thumb.  I yelped in pain, dropped the other hamster, and told them to enjoy their poop and pee dinner.  You want to bite me?  I dont clean you for another day.    Here are words that rhyme with shitbag:  Titbag Cuntbag Dishrag Saggy tits  Bored of that game now.  My best friend Rita is getting married next Friday!  Yahoooooodle!  I get to wear a tux and stay in a hotel and I will be in all the pictures!  I might even get my haircut with the rest of the bridesmaids.  Paul is going to be my date.  It is the first time that we have ever attended a function as gay boyfriends.  I am so proud of him for having the courage to go through with it.  He has been so supportive lately.  I could kiss his face.  Oh yeah, I do kiss his face.  Kissy face.  Kissy face nelson.  Rita and I had a very long talk last night about the upcoming event.  She is doing pretty well and from what I can tell hasnt gotten a severe case of cold feet.  I did tell her, though, that if for any reason she wants to hightail it out of the wedding and drive to Canada to escape, Ill charge up my credit cards and we will slip away!  A true best friend always gives you the out.    Thats about it for me.  Today is my friend Angies birthday.  Celebrating with her tonight.  Tomorrow night Im supposed to go to a roller skating party, but Im sure that I will bail on that one.  I just dont see how its cool to go roller skating at 26.  Especially with a bunch of straight people.  Now thats just uncomfortable.  But then again, if you are a straight guy and you go to a roller skating party, Im not so sure that you are so cool that  I  would feel like a loser.  I dont knowroller skating is for gay babies.  Did this post melt your labias?  Did it blow your nuts right off the sack?    If not, go here:   urlLink Royal TIT watching !  Have great weekends everyone!  Much much love and sex.

       Baby and Daddy  Not Baby Daddy   Last night, Paul and I tucked ourselves in bed after the premiere episode of  Queer As Folk .  We talked for a little while and at about midnight, I drifted off to sleep.    At 1am, my little hamster guy, Jim, started running on his wheel.  I fed him quite a few vegetables yesterday so I think he had tons of restless energy in his body.  He ran on that wheel for hours without reprieve.  Finally at 3am, I had enough of his tireless legs and I removed the wheel from his cage.  I hate doing that to him, but I surely needed some sleep.  I crawled back into bed with Paul and we went back to sleep.  Around 4am, I awoke to little feet walking on my face.  I immediately sat up thinking that there was a mouse running all over my bed.  When I flipped on the light, I saw little Jimbo sitting next to my pillow looking at me.  I was like Whaaaaaaaaaaaaa?    I immediately woke up Paul and we marveled at how Jim had gotten out of his cage, crawled across the carpet, climbed up my comforter and got into bed with me.  Are hamsters that smart?  Did he really want to get into bed with me?  Was he just lonely?  Baby wanted to be with daddy.  I kissed him over and over on his little head and put him back into his cage.  I noticed that one of the attachment pieces on the top of his cage had come undone.  That was how he escaped.  I am still in shock that he made the choice to get in bed with me rather than walk out the crack under my door and into the mouth of our housecat, Trey.  It is very possible that I would have woken up to see Trey making a meal out of my baby hamster.    I have had quite a few scares with this hamster.  I need to be MUCH more careful about keeping him in solitary confinement.    In other news, the weather is amazing.  I had a beautiful weekend with my girls, Kelly and Angie.  Then I read some of my new book  The Poisonwood Bible  (by Barbara Kingsolver) while eating a bagel and sitting by the East River.  It was a truly wonderful hour of my life.    I watched some movies, made Paul and I a great dinner and did my best to maximize my time off from work.    I have a very busy week ahead of me what with theatre rehearsals, birthday dinners, and my parents coming down for brunch.  Then the following weekend is Ritas wedding!  YAY!  Busy busy busy.    Enjoy the weather yall!    We are SO overdue for some sun.

       What a Difference a Day Makes   I woke up this morning feeling much better than I have felt in the last week.  I think my body was ready to give up the depression and allow me to move forward in a more positive light.    Since finding out last Thursday that my brother was going to be staying in Baghdad for at least a few more months, it has been very difficult to even crack a smile.  Ive been so angry and sad and frustrated and worst of all, Ive felt really alone with my feelings.  Sure, my friends in NYC are doing whatever they can to get me out of the apartment, but sometimes you just need to wallow in self-pity for awhile.  I did that and now I may be able to return to my regularly scheduled program.  Its been awhile since something has knocked me on my ass so hard.  As someone who deals with (at times) pretty severe depression, I always get nervous that the one thing to push me over the edge will be the thing that keeps me there forever.  As long as my brother comes home alive, I dont think we will ever have to confront that one thing.  For his first year in military combat, I was pretty confident that my brother would make it through ok.  I was the one telling my parents not to get so worked up.  I felt the presence of God in my body and he told me that I should just have faith; that it wasnt time for me to lose my brother.  When I got the horrible news of his delayed return home last week, I felt all of that built in faith flush out of my system.  Most of the tears I shed were based on the fact that I didnt trust in his safety anymore.   With much prayer, I have slowly found my way back to the place I was before.  My brother may have to stay for a few more months, but he will surely be ok and he will make me even more proud than he has already.  That kidserving our country so bravelywow.  I couldnt love him more than I already do.  And he WILL come home safely and we WILL have a wonderful family reunion when he does.  Only a matter of time.  See how positive I am being now?  SO positive!  I have found solace in my hatred of George W. Bush.  Not really hatred, but complete lack of interest or understanding in anything he does.  Its actually to the point where I burst out laughing in peoples faces when they tell me that they are going to vote for Bush.  I mean, the vote is all about personal belief so I dont begrudge them that.  But at the same timehave we been living in the same country for the past 3 years?  And have you been MY friend during that time?  Not sure that you would still be able to vote for Bush after that, but Ill take that as a sign of intelligence on your part.    HA!  Look at me getting my fire back!    God, I feel so much better.  Thank you.    To all of you that have sent me emails and left comments on my site:  your support has not gone unnoticed.  Rose, your offer of a phone call is incredibly sweet and open hearted.  Thank you.  To the restyour sensitivity to me over the last week is something that will stay with me forever.  I have some really wonderful people in my life, without which I would have surely lost my mind completely.  Here comes Friday!

       Nothing has Changed   I wish I could say that I was coming back to this journal refreshed and ready to go.  Unfortunately, Im still pretty sad and am having a really tough time breaking out of the rut.    I went home this weekend to be with my parents and the visit didnt go as smoothly as I had hoped.  There were a lot of tears and my dad and I got into a couple screaming matches on Friday night.  Im still kind of reeling from that whole experience.  The stress that my family is under right now is almost impossible to describe, yet feels all consuming.    My brother is not doing well at all.  Its too hard to get into it any further.  I feel really lonely and like no one understands.  I feel disconnected from some of my friends and I cant seem to find any sort of joy in either their lives or my own.    I feel completely defeated.  I dont care about the bullshit that was plaguing me before.  I could care less about my acting, my life in NYC, or anything else that used to make me happy.  I know that this will pass.  But it hasnt yet and my nerves are shot.  The only thing I do know is that I hate Bush and I hate this war and I feel like I live in a country that is based on false democracy.  The system doesnt seem to work, so why do I try to be such a big part of it?  Eventually I will get my fire back, but for now, there isnt much else I can say.  Ive been beaten down and its really hard to get back up and fight the good fight.

       Sadness   Last night, as Paul and I were putting on our jackets to go to the grocery store, my phone rang and my dad left a message on our answering machine:  Joe, this is your father.  I have a question I need you to ask your brother when he calls you tomorrow.  Its incredibly important.  My jaw immediately clenched shut as I thought about what my dad was going to say.  I was so shocked by the message that I told Paul that I didnt want to call him back, at least not until after we went grocery shopping.  We finished getting ready and stepped out the front door.  As we walked to the store, Paul handed me the phone and before I could resist any further, he dialed the number to my home.  My dad answered immediately and we had the following conversation:  Dad:  I have some potentially bad news. Me:  Oh no, what is it? Dad:  There is a high chance that Winfield will not be coming home for his May visit.  There has been an uprising in Baghdad that has caused leave cancellation for many different military personnel. Me:  You mean, hes not coming home anymore? Dad:  Its very possible.  (choking on sobs)  Winfield told us that he will call you tomorrow.  He will not be able to tell you details, but you need to ask him one question for us.  Have the plans changed?   Me:  I dont understand.  Hes just not coming home now?   Dad:  That seems to be the case, but we wont know for sure until he calls you tomorrow. Me:  (shocked) Ok.  I will ask him that question when he calls. Dad:  (crying hard) Thanks Joe.  Call me as soon as you know.  Please. Me:  I will.  I hung up the phone and stood in the middle of the street for a minute.  I felt as though my world totally caved in out of nowhere.  Paul was waiting for me on the corner and he asked what was wrong.  I told him what my dad said and he offered to go sit somewhere to discuss it.  I refused and told him that we should continue on with our night as best as we could.    We began walking around the grocery store and when we ended up in the bread isle, I lost it.  The sobs came hard and fast and I felt as though I was going to pass out.  Paul immediately wrapped his arms around me in the store and we both stood there and cried for a couple of minutes; neither of us saying anything.  Just hugging and crying.    Eventually we got ourselves together and finished our shopping.    This morning I woke up at 4am with a pit in my stomach.  I laid there for hours thinking about my brother and how upset he must be.  I didnt know how I could go to work.  I wanted nothing more than to stay home and stare at the wall.  I felt horribly depressed.    When I got to work, my dad called and told me that Winfield had called him at home this morning to tell him that he is definitely not coming home in May.  His tour of duty has been extended for at least another 6 months.  He will be leaving Baghdad as scheduled and will go on a field mission for a while.  As far as I know, he will be unable to contact us during this time.  (For the news story relating to this post,  urlLink click here .)   My brother has been in Iraq for 13 months.  I have not seen nor hugged him in over a year.  Now it seems as though I wont be able to share these moments with him for quite a bit longer.  We had planned his entire visit, reserved hotel rooms, bought theatre tickets, and put our hearts into it.  Now, its just not happening.  Theres not much else I can say about it except that I feel as though my heart has completely broken.  My parents have left work and are sitting at home right now bawling their eyes out.  I am supposed to go home tomorrow to be with them for Easter.  It is sure to be a miserable trip.    I am not angry at the military right now, nor am I angry at anyone.  I just feel defeated.  As I said to my mom this morning There is only so much one family can take.    And now we continue on as we did before

       On a Mini-Break   Due to the wonderful world of Judaism, I am leaving work in about 10 minutes, not to return until Thursday morning.  Passover of my LOVE!  This weekend rocked on a million levels and I feel pretty wiped out.  I have a ton of shit to do this week, so this time off couldn't have come at a better...well...time.  Too much fun makes Joe unable to type a coherent post.  I hope everyone has a great week!    Try no to miss me too much, k?  Cuz I will be sitting at home, masturbating to every inch of your body.    I'll make sure to clean up the spooge.  Promise.  PEACE OUT!

       Free Thought on a Friday   I was sitting here staring at the computer for a solid ten minutes, with complete writers block, when I decided to do a quick and concise entry in the high school style of free thought.  I dont really know what I want to write about, so I thought it might be fun to spend five minutes writing only about the different things that float in and out of my mind.  Hence, wellfree thought.  Today my teeth feel funny.  I dont know why.  Maybe Im still reeling from that nasty nap dream I had yesterday.  Either way, part of me wants to punch my own teeth in so that they stop irritating the fuck out of me.  Last night I sat around and watched all of my programs.   Survivor  was the fucking best!  Im telling you, if you dont watch this show, you dont know whatcher missing.  Rob and Amber?  Mmmm.Rob.  and Amber.   The Apprentice  was great as well and I muchly enjoyed seeing that tool bag fake ass southern boy Troy get the boot.  His accent is like nails on a chalkboard and his hair could definitely use a different kind of gel.  Every time he comes on the TV screen, his spikes poke me in my beautiful browns.   ER  sucked a dick, but I had to watch it based on years of commitment.  Next week may be good though as Carrie Weaver can do no wrong in my eyes.  If the episode is about her, then I will sit there in silence and pay attention to every line.  I love her and her crippled leg.  I had eggs and a hash brown for breakfast.  It took me 2 minutes and 38 seconds to shove it down my gullet.  It wasnt the best breakfast I have ever had.  But then again, the best breakfast I ever had was at Bobbebbins and it was a cheeseburger.    SO!  A friend of mine from college did my taxes the other night.  He was going to do them for free since I offered to reward him with some of the pot.  I was really nervous that I was going to owe a shit load of money this year.  Last year I had to pay the IRS over $800.  However, since I have been putting so much into my retirement package, my taxes are CHEAP this year.  In total, I owe the Federal $36 and the State $48.  Rock out.  Ill take it with a smile.  My tax friend offered me a bunch of deduction options to lower the payments and even receive a refund, but I opted out.  I didnt want to do anything that I felt could be illegal.    But paying my tax guy in pot surely isnt illegal.  You understand the difference.  Also, while I was on the phone with my tax friend, we had this conversation:  Me:  Can I ask you a personal question? Tax Friend:  Sure. Go ahead. Me:  Its a pretty bold question, are you sure you dont mind? Tax Friend:  Not at all.  What is it? Me:  Are you gay?  I mean, I know its a blunt question, but something was telling me that you are gay and I just had to ask. Tax Friend:  HAHAHAHAHA.  Joe, you are too much.  Yes, Im gay.  How did you figure it out? Me:  Let me just say, I have my ways.  Truth is, I knew when I ran into him a couple months back that he could be gay.  I can always tell if a guy is gay or straight by the way they interact with me.  I am a very accessible gay man and sometimes even the straight boys have been known to do a little flirting with me.  All in all I was pretty impressed that I figured out the sexual orientation of my tax friend.    Wowmy free thought theory has actually been a bit more organized than I imagined it to be.  My typos have been few and far between.  Im becoming quite a professional secretary, arent I?    I remember when I was little, I actually WANTED to be a secretary when I grew up.  I thought it would be fun to answer the phone and to take messages.  I should really be thankful.  Cuz if I think about it, my dream has come true.  Not everyone can say that.  I wanted to be a secretary and now I am.  Thank God I dont have any loftier goals.   Alrightpeace out shelly.    Hope everyone has a safe and CRAZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZY weekend!  I hope to!  BOOCHES!

       (Big Breath) FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!   Ever have one of those days when you want to punch someone in the face?    On top of being in a generally bad mood today, I was extremely happy to find out that Paul left my apartment after Kelly this morning and because he doesnt have a set of my new house keys, the door was left unlocked for the day.  Kelly assured me that everything would be ok and if it wasnt for her, I might have cabbed it down to the East Village to scratch Pauls eyes out.  Just one of those days  Anywaylast night I had the pleasure of watching  urlLink Extreme Makeover .  The episode focused on an engaged couple who was having a complete physical overhaul.  The got facial reconstruction, tummy tucks, liposuction, and even new porcelain veneers.  They didnt see each others new looks until they met at the altar at their wedding.  It was highly interesting to watch, although I tend to squirm during the operation scenes.  I mean, can you NOT take a chisel to someones nasal bones on national TV please?  Paul ended up arriving at my house at 10pm.  He had to cater a party at a restaurant near my apartment so he came over after he was finished.  He was fucking wasted and he irritated me almost the entire time.  I hate when he drinks.  He acts like such a fucking tool bag.  He grabs at me and says obnoxious shit.  His face takes on this different lookhis wasted look and it makes me INCREDIBLY uncomfortable.  Needless to say, hanging out with him last night did not do anything to solve the problems that we are having in our relationship.  In fact, I went to bed wanting nothing more than to be sleeping alone.  Whateverits hard to explain and no one seems to understand, so lets just move on.  (can you tell that Im just NOT in the mood today?)  When I was taking my nap at lunch, I had a really bad 30 second dream.    In the dream I was looking in the mirror when all of a sudden my front teeth started to vibrate painfully until they vibrated so much that a chunk of my front tooth cracked out of my mouth and fell into my hand.  There was a stream of blood that followed.  I immediately woke up after it happened and lay on my back rubbing my teeth with my fingers.  Today sucks, even dream wise.  In other news, I am very much looking forward to watching  The Apprentice   and  ER  tonight.  If that doesnt cheer me up, I dont know what will.  I will be especially annoyed if my boy Nicholas gets fired tonight.  Its hard to fall in love with someone, only to find out that they are a failure.  hahahahaha sike.  Ok, not so sike.  I dont know if I mentioned it earlier, but my brother did in fact receive the Bronze Star for his work in Iraq!  750 soldiers were nominated and 12 received the award in a ceremony last week.  My brother was one of these proud 12.  My family couldnt be more in awe of him than we already are.  He is such a superstar and so brave.  I cant believe the greatness that has come out of him.  Its really something else.  I continue to sit here in NYC wallowing my life away with unimportant bullshit.  Im not at all comparing my activities with those of my brother, but I would be lying if I said it didnt cross my mind a lot.   A lot.  Anyways, one more hour and I can escape my job and do something with myself.  I need a change of environment, I think.  Maybe that will cheer me up a bit.  Go outside, smoke a butt, fuck a hot guy, and punch a beggar in the face.    There really is no better way to spend a rainy Thursday evening.

       Today   Today I went to a staff lunch.  We do this lunch thing about once a year and it is always a super boring event.  This time however, I managed to drink 3 glasses of wine during the lunch and ended up walking out in a much better mood than I would have otherwise.  Unfortunately, Ari and I had HIGH hopes to go home after our lunch event, but we were forced to come back to work for the last hour of the work day.  We were MIGHTY pissed at that.  But I realized that drinking wine during a work shift makes me a happier boy than usual.    Ari is ready to kill someone right now.  Time for me to shove some love down her throat before she puts my boss in a headlock.    Thats all I have to say today.   Super interesting post, right?  I know!  I am almost cumming in my pants from the sheer excitement of typing it.    ADIOS MOTHAFUCKA!

       Yes, I Am Still Living   Let me just say that this website is just about the biggest thorn in my side.  It looks like diarrhea and I dont have the time or the energy to fix the detailssuch as the links and recent posts sections.  So basically, I struggle and I struggle and I keep on keeping on.  (okay, get a life Joe.  Its a fucking blogger, not a Pulitzer Prize winning venture.  Ok, yeah it is.)  My hair is wicked out of control today.  So, today when I came into work, I found a forward in my inbox asking me to check out what the Human Rights Campaign has accomplished in their efforts to get Massachusetts lawmakers to allow gay marriages.  I quickly jumped to the site and saw some of the most beautiful pictures I have ever seen.    In front of my eyes were gay people getting married; lesbian couples, young and old, gay males, young and old.  It made my heart burst with excitement and joy.  May 17th will be remembered as the day when gay people all over the nation came together for a small, yet significant victory.  It just takes one to cause change.  Thank you to Massachusetts for being that one.    I needed this uplifting moment to combat the other moment I experienced on my way to work today.  There was a poll in yesterdays AMNew York that asked Do you think that gay people should be allowed to get married?  That was it.  No fluff, no need for details.  Just Do you think that gay people should be allowed to get married?  All last night I kept thinking to myself I wonder how the people of New York will answer this poll.    Now, I understand that its a stupid little poll done by a free daily newspaper, but I was very curious to see how the open-minded world of NYC feels about gays being allowed to get married.  (Now understand that I use the word allowed which makes me unbelievably nauseous as I type this  I mean, I dont remember having to allow straight people to get marriedbut then again Im inferior, I forgot)  As soon as I woke up today I thought, I wonder how the poll will turn out.  When I finally got my hands on the paper, I noticed that the poll wasnt in its usual spot on the front cover.  I desperately tore through the publication trying to find the stupid little quiz that had me up during the night thinking about it.  Finally, I found it tucked away at the bottom of the page.  60% of people in NYC believe that gay people should NOT have the right to get married.  HURL.  I was immediately crushed.  I realize that I live in a fantasy bubble of a world since NYC is one of the few places where everyone has a chance regardless of race, religious beliefs, sexual preference, or the fact that you are an incredibly ridiculous weirdo.  But obviously this is not true.  The MAN will keep you down for as long as he can.    In my heart of gay hearts, I hope that the PEOPLE will band together on this issue.  I dont think that all straight people have to agree on this controversial topic, but I do think that if you disagree, stay out of it.  Dont make my life worse because you have a belief on something that you will never ever understand.  Its like me telling a woman that she cant have an abortion.  I dont particularly believe in abortion as I do think its murder.  However, will you see me EVER vote against a Pro-Choice bill?  Never.  Its not my issue and how dare I make that decision when Ill never carry a baby in my womb?  I think it makes logical sense.  For all of you straight supporters out there, thank you.  Without your voices on this topic, the issue would go nowhere.  Its strange how straight people are the only voices of reason in this whole case.  Gay people speak out and its like Dont listen to him!  He already HAS the disease.  Lets hear from someone who is more objective!  How about you Bobby McNeverHadaDickinhisMouth?

       End of the Week Tidbits   I had the weirdest dream last night.  I was hanging with some friends at a party when all of a sudden I had to take a huge dump.  I went in to the bathroom, pulled down my jeans and sat on the can.  I squeezed and squeezed, but couldnt get any of the shit out.  As I pushed harder and harder, I actually felt like I had to go more.  Eventually I got so frustrated with pushing that I got up and went back to the party.  Shortly after that I woke up and discovered that I was covered in my own shit.  It was random and kind of erotic.  Ok SIKE.  I did not wake up to find my body covered in my own shit.  And if I did, do you REALLY think that I would find that erotic?  Ok, some people do, but definitely not me.  I have my own fetishes and they do not revolve around feces.  They revolve around vomit.  If you have met me in person, you know that I have a very spiky style haircut.  Well, last week, Im sitting on the subway, listening to my headphones, minding my own lame business, when this big black woman walks by me and pushes down my spikes.  Im like huh?  She continues to walk out of the subway and doesnt look back.  I guess it was funny that she patted me on the head, but it was also strange and made me feel a tad ridiculous.  Luckily, I use so much pomade in my hair that it will take her weeks to get it off of her hand.    Last night I went to happy hour with Paul and Kelly.  It was a super good time.  Paul wasnt in a great mood when we got together, but he ended up pulling out of it and I think he totally enjoyed himself.  After a few chocolate martinis, we got into a cab and jetted back to my apartment.  Once there, Kelly and Paul whipped up a feast of barbeque chicken and asparagus.  Angie came over shortly after dinner was made and we all hung out at my new kitchen table for awhile.  We smoked some fatty joints and drank some beers and then it was game time.  Guess what we played?  Wellit was GUESS WHO!    Have you played  urlLink Guess Who?  before?  Its a super easy, super fun game that revolves around figuring out the other persons character based on questions that are asked.  Most people ask questions like Is your person a male?  Or does your person have a bald head?  When WE play together, we ask questions like Is your person a young pedophile or an old pedophile?  I distinctly remember Angie asking Kelly if her character needed some more rouge for their face.  After dying laughing, Kelly said no.   After our game playing, I threw Pauls wasted ass in bed and watched the finale of  ER .  I kept saying that I wanted Ming Na to die in last nights episode.  Fortunately, there was a huge cliff hanger that she was involved in, so hopefully she will bite it in the first episode next year.  Its not that I have anything personal against her.  I just think shes a crap actress that takes up too much screen time  you knownothing personal.  Bring on more of the Abby and the Sam!  For a long time, I wasnt a huge fan of Abbys character, but she has since grown on me tremendously.  I cant wait for her to finally be a doctor next season!  ROCK!  I guess thats it.  I hope everyone has a super really great awesome super weekend.  Do something fun and hug someone you love.  Be back here on Monday!  Peace.

       My Brother Was Supposed to Come Home Today   Ive been dreading this day for weeks.  It could have been such an exciting couple of days for me, but instead, Im doing my best to pretend as though Winfield was scheduled to stay in Iraq all along.  I had a very long talk with him yesterday that resulted in 30 minutes of sobbing.  It was not the way I wanted to end my day.  Winfield is carrying a lot of anger with him these days.  He is furious with the ARMY for extending his leave.  He is furious with the soldiers who tortured the Iraqi prisoners.  He is at his wits end and he is looking to take out this frustration and anger on anyone who crosses his path.  I tried (as best as I could) to diffuse his fury bomb, but there wasnt much I could do.  Eventually I just cried and cried and cried.    The two of us decided that there are two positives that we can look forward to amidst all of this negative.  1)	Winfield is, without a doubt, leaving the service next May.  His time is done.  He has served his country, succeeding in ways that we never thought possible.  He no longer agrees with what the military is doing and he wants no part of it.  He is exhausted and needs a break.  As he said to me yesterday His life has been on hold for far too long.  Its time to pick up where he left off over 3 years ago.  2)	Each day of hell is one day closer to heaven.  We are (VERY tentatively) planning his homecoming for early August.  My family is very cautious about getting any sort of hopes up, since last time it took us weeks to get over the disappointment.  In fact, none of us are fully over that disappointment yet.  Its like an aching that never goes away.  As we got off the phone, my eyes completely swollen, Winfield said I miss you so much Joe.  You are my best friend and I know well pick up where we left off.  I choked on my last remaining tears and told him to Be safe and to call soon.    After that conversation I wanted nothing, but to leave work.  I stuck it out for about an hour more and took off as soon as I could get the chance.    What these soldiers do on a daily basis is something that I will never understand, although it consumes my thoughts throughout each day.  I wish I had the bravery that these men possess.  For the rest of my life I will live with the highest respect for our military and the families and friends that are left behind.    Its an experience that changes lives forever.

      So, I got so frustrated with my fucked up blogger, that I decided to pick a new template and hope that it solved my problems.    Well it did, kind of.  I've lost my links now and the page looks like a literal piece of dog shit, but at least it's not listing the posts backwards anymore.  It was driving me up the fucking wall.  Sorry that the links are gone...I will put them back someday.  Just not today.  Or tomorrow, or maybe ever.  haha.  Some day.  I've had enough of Blogger for today.  And for tomorrow, and maybe forever.   Sike!  Just trying to accept my new dogshit template.

       help me before I develop a vagina and cellulite!   Im super tired today.  I have no idea why.  I surely slept 8 hours last night as well as 12 hours the night before.  I should be so rested, its ridiculous.  But after eating my lunch (consisting of the mandatory two slices of pizza), I crashed hard on my way back to work.  Im sitting here yawning as though I could fall over from sheer exhaustion.  Lets seepretty uneventful weekend overall.  Did a great deal of writing on the script that we are developing for our next theatre production.  Watched a ton of movies, including  Ruthless People ,  The Order ,  Spy Kids 2  (it really wasnt as bad as it seems), and  It Runs in the Family , which is the sequel to  A Christmas Story .  I didnt know there was a sequel either!  It was pretty good too.  Nothing to freak out about, but definitely a must see if you are into that whole Ralphie and his Red Rider BB gun, thing.    I also jerked off 4 times in the matter of 36 hours, but whos counting, really.  Last nights  Survivor  finale was truly the highlight of all of my weekend adventures.  It was three hours of non-stop joy for this Joe CuttheShit.  Congrats Amber(!), although I totally wanted my boy, Rob Mariano, to take away the title.  Ah wellthats what you get for falling in love, eh Rob?  And did that boy look GOOD last night, or twat?  In other news,   I am slowly becoming a magazine whore.  I cant stop buying  People ,  US Weekly , and  In Touch  magazine.  I am fastly turning into a full blown woman.  Someone help!  Is it wrong that after work I am going to go immediately over to Pauls, climb in to bed, turn on the 2 hour presentation of  The Swan  and call it a night?  Ah shitI am FASTLY turning into a woman.  Someone hand me the bon bons and do my nails.  I prefer bright red or pink to match my pumps.  Ever feel like you were going to cry for no reason?  All of a sudden I think I just caught a sob in my throat.  I swallowed it down and sat here a little stunned.  What do  I  have to cry about?  Get a hold of yourself, you menstruating asshole!  I may need to go now.  Its quite possible that the more I type, the more my feminine side takes over.  At this point, Im craving long bubble baths and nights curled up on the phone, chatting with my closest girlfriends.  Anyone up for a movie on Lifetime?  Ill make the popcorn and meet you on the couch with a box of Kleenex.

       A  Friend ly Retraction on a Fabulous Friday    Well, my bad mood has passed, so now I can be totally honest when I say that I LOVED  Friends  last night!  I was being a bitch yesterday and I didnt give the show the absolute credit it deserves.  As the clip show aired, I started to get all sentimental.  Monica, Joey, Phoebe, Rachel, Ross, Chandlerdammit Im REALLY gonna miss those friends of ours.  In my opinion, the finale was done in perfect  Friends  tradition.  There was the suspense of Ross and Rachel, the storyline filler of Joey and Chandlers breaking the fooz ball table, and the crazy Phoebe acting out in ridiculous ways to provide ultimate comic relief.  As the show drew closer to 10pm, I felt really sad inside.  If you were in front of your television last night watching this finale, you were a part of history in the making.    When I woke up this morning, my first thought was  Friends  is truly over now.  No matter how you feel about the show itself, its now off the air.  An era, as we know it, has been completed.  Unless you were in Cancun celebrating your honeymoon, last nights viewing is something that you will remember for the rest of your life.  Where were YOU during the last episode of  Friends ?  In other news, my generous friend, Kelly, bought me the new  urlLink Nelly Furtado  CD,  Folklore .  I cant explain to you how fucking awesome it is.  That girl is a musical genius.  If you dont have it already, and you enjoyed the first album she put out, go and get the new one.  Its much different, but totally top notch.  I am big into most kinds of music as it is, but its very rare that I get a CD thats as exceptional as this one is.  I mean One Trick Pony  is where its at!  So glad its Friday!  Im muchly looking forward to going out in the city tonight for a raging good time.  No lesbian bars thoughId prefer to go home in one piece.  I have a lot of writing to do this weekend as well as sleep to catch up on.  Also, if I go another weekend without seeing  Kill Bill , Im going to cut my dick off.  Ive been dying to see it for years and years and I never get the opportunity.  Well, that all changes this weekend!  Billhere I cum!  That should be it for me!  I hope everyone has a fun filled and relaxing weekend.  I plan on lying around naked for longer than is necessary.  And I plan to finger my cunt feverishly.  Or at least until it bleeds!  Love and hugs and kisses and slaps in the face!  Peace out.

        Friend ly Irritation   So funny.  Ive been in the best mood all day.  Then, I laid down for my daily nap and woke up in an irritated mood.  Maybe its because the security guard in our building was screaming like a fucking banshee throughout the entire hour.  Or maybe its cuz I was just not in the mood to sit back at my desk after the morning was a full bodied beastmaster.  In either case, FUCK!  I gotta shake this mood before I leave here.  My job is not important enough for me to take any of the attitude home with me.  Seriously now.  Tonight is the  Friends  finale.  Big news, eh?  I mean, its all over the newspapers and television channels.  Im super sad its going to be over and I just love those  Friends  characters to death, but enough already!  How many goodbye specials do I have to endure?  Oh yeah, thats right.  Only one more!    In a way, Im pretty excited that  Friends  will be finished.  Its always exciting to me when the Television gets a programming overhaul.  Some of the biggest shows of the decade are ending for good.  Well, that is, if you really CARED that  Frasier  was going off the air.  I thought those old farts kicked the bucket years ago, but I was wrong.  Niles and Daphne and whoever else bores me to death will be finishing their run next week. Tune in and get your last dose of free sleeping pills!  Gathering with some of my OWN friends tonight to watch the finale.  It should be pretty low key and that is fine by me.  I am going to cuddle up with a bottle of wine and sip away as Ross and Rachel fuck each other, yet dont actually get together, for the last time.  Im also going to die laughing when Monica pretends to not have a baby in her OWN stomach as she pulls the baby out of Anna Fariss vagina.  PRETTY hilarious.  And Joeyyeah wellam I the only person in America who is confident that his break out show next fall will bomb miserably?  I have the best wishes for him, but he was always my LEAST favorite character on the show.  Does this mean that Im going to have to watch him be a stupid ass for a FULL half an hour next year?    And what is this with Brad and Jen breaking up?  Can they NOT?  I guess there is no such thing as beauty queens finding true love in each other.   Paul just called me to tell me that he has to work tonight and will not be hanging with us during the finale.  This sucks because now I will be chilling out with the recently broken up/taking it slower Kelly and Jen.  Thats ok, but when you combine it with Mariah and her slutty ex-girlfriend (who I do NOT speak to) as my only other compadres, it makes for a shady evening.  I told myself that if Paul bailed, I would go home and chill at my apartment alone.  But I will probably suck it up and go to the finale thing anyway.  FUCK!  I really wanted him to be there tonight.  I guess thats it.  So much for improving my mood.    Im going to go punch my boss in the dick and nuts.  If anything, THAT should bring a smile to my face.    ENJOY your  Friends  filled evening.

       Dental DAMN!   I was up at 7am this morning with my palms sweating and my heart beating out of my chest.  I had been dreading my 10:30am dentist appointment since I made it.  As the days grew closer, the pit in my stomach got deeper and my nerves began to fray.  More than anything in the world, I am most terrified of going to the dentist.  When I showed up for my appointment, the receptionist (Nelly) could see the look of fear on my face.  She asked if I was ok and if I wanted a drink of water.  I told her that I was just a bit nervous, but that I would be ok.  I sat down and stared at the wall.  Eventually, Nelly got up from around her desk and came out into the waiting room.  She offered me a magazine and reassured me that the appointment wouldnt be as bad as I was anticipating.  I truly felt comforted by her.  I was called in for my appointment and I really felt as though I was going to vomit on the floor.  I took my seat in the chair and the dental hygienist (Anita) came in to talk to me about the cleaning.  I explained that I havent been to a dentist in over two years because of my overwhelming fear.  She told me that that was common and that she would do whatever was in her power to make the visit as painless as possible.  I did my best to relax as she took a full set of X-rays and began picking away at the tartar buildup.  Anita was extremely kind and talked to me throughout the process.  She said that there was an incredible amount of tartar buildup underneath my gums.  She picked at that shit for a half an hour as I squirmed in my seat.  Even with her being as gentle as possible, there were still moments of agony.    Finally we moved on to the cleaning and then it was over!  The actual dentist came in then and I was surprised to see that he was incredibly hot.  He is very young and dressed well and I loved looking in to his eyes as he consulted me on the proper brushing etiquette.  He showed me my X-rays and told me that my teeth are in excellent condition.  I dont have any cavities and they are strong and healthy.  Unfortunately, my gums are showing the beginning signs of subdermal gingivitis.    The dentist explained to me that I would have to come in at the end of the month for a periodontal scraping.  He described this procedure as a deep cleaning of the area underneath my gums.  SICK!  They are going to give me some Novocain type cream and then dig below the surface.  The idea of it is enough to make me pass out, but when I talked to my mom she explained the procedure to me and it doesnt sound too complicated.    After I was finished, I hugged Anita and proceeded to check out with Nelly.  We made our next appointment and I was pleased to find out that I didnt even have to pay a co-pay fee.  It was all covered by my insurance.  Thank the Lord!  As we know, going to the dentist doesnt only hurt your mouth, it hurts your wallet.  I walked out of the office on cloud 9.  Not only do I have teeth in good condition, the appointment is over!  I dont have to deal with this again for at least another couple of monthswell except for that dreaded gum scraping thing.  Blech.    I prayed so hard that this appointment would go well and it surely did.  If you ever think you have a problem that is too small for God, you are wrong.  He is there with you; even when its for something as minute as having a bi-annual cleaning!  Now I can eat my pizza in peace.

       THE Wedding of 2004   Wellity, wellityI am back from the wedding with about a hundred wonderful memories!  The whole weekend was nothing short of amazing.  In fact, it went much more smoothly than I had anticipated.  Rita had put a LOT of work into the planning of her day, but there is always the fear that something will go incredibly wrong and send the whole wedding spiraling into mass confusion.  Fortunately, there were NO scares, at least from what I noticed.  Just people dancing and laughing and hugging and having an overall top notch good time.  I showed up at the wedding rehearsal just in time on Friday.  I had gone tanning the day before and my face and body was noticeably scorched.  Paul rented a fire red convertible Mustang for the drive up, so needless to say, driving with the top down for hours left my face as red as a just ripe tomato.    At the rehearsal, I met the other groomsman and reconnected with my wonderful ladies from college.  The church was beautiful, and Rita looked like she was glowing with pure excitement and joy.  No hitches at the rehearsal and off we went to an amazing sit down rehearsal dinner.  We drank wine and vodka tonics and talked our faces off for a couple of hours.  Upon returning to the hotel, it was much of the same, except for the half an hour Rita and I got to spend just the two of us.  I gave her my special gift and we hugged for about 20 minutes straight.  On Saturday, I had Paul drive me over to the mall so that I could get my tuxedo.  My best girls (and also bridesmaids) from school decided to pull out their selfish bitch natures and refused to drive me to the mall themselves.  Unfortunately, I missed out on Rita getting her hair done, but I did get to help her in to her wedding dress right before the ceremony.  Her sister was there as well and the three of us made sure that she was the most beautiful bride to ever walk down the aisle.  The ceremony itself was an emotional rollercoaster.  There were many tears and I found myself chewing on my trembling lower lip for most of it.  Staring at Rita in her contemporary, yet elegant wedding dress, standing before her unbelievably handsome fianc gave me feelings of joy and sadness that could only be summed up as intense.  Their vows were part sentimental/part hilarious and when they looked in to each others eyes and said I do, the entire crowd swelled with emotion.  The photographer took just about 2 hours of pictures.  I am dying to see them!  I have been told that Ritas mom will be sending us a copy of all of them via email, so I am anxiously waiting for them to come through.  I think I looked good in my tux, although I felt like the jacket and vest they prepared for me was a tad too big.  Makes sense, since the combined weight of the 6 groomsman had to be over 1500 pounds.  You should have seen me standing next to all of the other guys.  I looked like I was a 6 year old waif.    The reception was one of the best times I have ever had in my life.  The food was good, but was only eaten for about 10 minutes.  As soon as the DJ started playing music, the dance floor filled up and didnt empty until the event shut down at midnight.  Unbelievably, it was open bar until the last hour.  We were all shocked by that one.  The amount of money to keep an open bar for 4 hours is extraordinary.  Rita knows how to throw a bash, thats for sure.  Ritas selection of music for the night was just about flawless.  Of course you had your classics, but she made sure to throw in some Justin Timberlake and Humpty Dance as well.  I was able to make some new friends on the dance floor and I also had some very memorable slow dances with some of Ritas family.  The whole night was just perfect.    When we got back to the hotel, everyone got changed and met in the lobby for a few more drinks.  I wiped out around 1am and went back to my hotel room to hang with Paul and the girls.  I have to say, Paul was absolutely incredible through the entire trip.  He barely drank any alcohol, yet managed to make idle conversation and keep a smile on his face throughout the evening.  When I would look over at him, my heart pumped with feelings of love and respect.  He was, without a doubt, the most handsome guy at the wedding, wearing his expensive suit and Versace tie.    Saying goodbye to Rita on Sunday was a bit difficult to do.  I was just about out of tears at that point, but I did make sure to hug her as long as I could.  She is no longer just my Rita.  She is now married and I will forever have to share her with her new husband.  I couldnt ask for a better guy to share such an incredible girl with.  He was so sweet and kind to me throughout the weekend and I truly believe that their wedding and relationship is blessed by God.  There arent two people who are more right for each other.  Rita is now in Cancun on her honeymoon.  I hope she remembers to brush her teeth with bottled water.  Otherwise, shes going to have runny poops all week!  I am muchly looking forward to seeing her again in a couple of weeks.  Now that shes married and all  There have been few weekends in my life that have been filled with so much joy and love.  I still get choked up thinking about it.  I wish I could repeat it every weekend for the rest of my life.  Or at least every weekend until  I  get married.    I love you Rita!  This is just the beginning.  I am so proud of you for taking this step and I am here for you every day for the rest of your life.    Can you have a baby now that I can love and keep as my own?

       GAH!   Work is so crazy today!  I haven't had a free second to do anything, much less play around and write in my journal.    The wedding was incredible.  I couldn't have asked for a more wonderful time.  I have so many things to share about it and will do so tomorrow.    Until then, wish me luck in getting through the rest of my unbelievably hellish day.  SMOOCHES!

       The Things I Need to Tell You   Over the last couple of days, I have dealt with quite a few crazy things.  In no particular order, here is my summary of events:   Lust   I have been completely insatiable when it comes to my lust factor these days.  I am jerking my bean pole at least 2 times a day.  Often, its up in the range of 3 or 4 times a dizzle.  I cant stop thinking about muscle men and how crazy horny they make me.  I find myself whacking off in the strangest of places.  Work, definitely.  Home, of course.  On Pauls couch, while hes sleeping.  In Pauls bed while he is making dinner.  On the floor in my bathroom in Albany.  In the den of my house in Albany. Pretty much, anywhere I can take it out and whack it off, I will surely do so.  Summer gets to me.  Seeing all those bulging biceps stretching the sleeves of those manly t-shirts.  OMG.  I have to jerk right now.  Omg.  OMG.  OMG!  UH UH UH UH Oh NO.  OH YES! OH OH OH OH OH.  HANGING TOUGH! OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHyeaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!   Now Im covered in cum.  great.   Love     Ive been so naturally happy these days.  Most likely cuz of my impending birthday celebration this weekend.  Ive been running myself into the ground by trying to attend every event thats happened over the last month.  So far, the only get together I havent been able to attend was my friend, Staceys, bacherlorette party this weekend.  I was pretty disappointed that I wasnt able to see my Rita this weekend, but I just couldnt make it out of the house.  I woke up on Saturday and felt so burned out and like trashI had to stay home.  But once I got my sleep on, I woke up totally in love with everyone I know.  There isnt one person in my life that Im currently angry at or upset with.  Im just coasting on good fumes and loving every second of it.  Paul and I are doing incredibly well and Im excited to see what he has planned for my birthday on Friday.  I just love everything and everyone right now.  Its a  very  wonderful feeling that only comes around once in a while.   Hate   Of course, I cant totally lie and say that there isnt anything that I hate.  Whats a life without some hatred in it?  Pretty damn boring if you tell me.  Be warned, when discussing hate, I never hold back.  So here is who I hate and why I hate them, in no particular hating order:  1)	The entire cast of  Outback Jack .  TBSfuck you.  JustFUCKyou.  2)	Avril Lavigne.  If you dont choke on your smarm soon, Im going to wrap my girlie hands around your skinny neck and squeeze the fake coolness right out of your ugly Canadian face.  3)	Ashlee Simpson.  Please stop singing.  You CANT and its hurting my ears.  They are bleedy from you singy.  4)	The entire staff at the University Food Market on the Upper West Side of NYC.  You bitches are so rude to me and youre all 18 with latina babies in your stomach.  Its not my fault that you got knocked up and have no education.  Give me my Vitamin water with a smile or Ill rip those babies out of your stomach and hand deliver them to you.  5)	Alfred Molina.  You may win people over with your Dr. Octopus savvy, but you will never EVER be ANY sort of Tevye in  Fiddler on the Roof .  Be more Jewish or get out!  6)	President George W. Bush.  I never did have much respect for you, but now any shred of dignity you had is gone.  You suck.  You do bad things and hurt a lot of people.  Your reign of terror will end and I will dance on your recently booted, shrivled up, close-minded, controlling bastard ass.  7)	 The Day After Tomorrow .  Im still reeling from how much you sucked as a movie.  Even hot ass Jake Gyllenhaal couldnt have saved it with his huge beautiful blue eyes.  I was more excited to see this movie, over everything else this summer.  You suck.  You suck and you hurt my feelings for being so B-A-D.  That spells fucking bad!  8)	 North Shore .  Youre a stupid butthole.  Brooke Burns?  You are the  wrinkle  that surrounds the stupid butthole.  Your acting skillz are SUPER good.  9)	Britney Spears.  Ive never seen a stronger argument for legalizing gay marriage in my life.  10)	J. Loser.  Ditto on the gay marriage statement.  11)	Dick Cheney.  You suck worse than Bush.  You really seriously do.  And I think you drool on yourself.  Vice President of scaring me!  12)	My Alarm Clock.  I worry every day that you wont go off.  You were made in 1972 and if it werent for your sentimental value, I would throw you out my front window.  You are ugly and you are dirty.  Andyou are ugly.  And dirty.  Pudding pies puddin.  13)	Liz Phair.  What happened?  Why do you suck my balls so bad?  Why are you licking and nibbling and sucking my nuts?  You turned your back on your indie fan base and came out with one of the WORST pop albums I done ever heard.  And I am a pop queen, so I know me some poppy.  You havent impressed me more than Hillary Duff.  And shes a blond donut.   Murder   It was a dark and stormy evening when I entered the old haunted house.  In one hand I had a bottle of chloroform, in the other, I had a knife.  I approached you while you were sleeping.  Creeping on tip toes (Im gay, memble?), I inched towards your bed, knife raised high to the ceiling.  With no need for the chloroform, I casually shoved in into your twatty frosting.  You moved slightly, but didnt wake from the pleasant dreams you must have been having.  I raised my knife high above your face and I brought it down with full and complete force.  Once your last breath escaped from your chocolate mouth, I cut you up and gave you to everyone at my birthday party!  You were a hit and everybody loved that your insides were made of ice cream!  Haagen Daaz birthday cake, everyone loved it that you died in my honor!  What?  What.  Did you think I was a real murderer?  Shit.  I have sensibilities.  I only kill for fun.  You know that.  Guess what tomorrow is?   The day before my 27th birthday!    See you then bitches!

       Madonna?  I laugh in your face!   I did it!  I am the first gay man EVER to give up FREE Madonna tickets!  And do you want to hear the best part?  They were VIP tickets and we could have gotten backstage!  HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  I am the devil and you LOVE it!  The thing is, Madonna has always made me snore.  Of course there are certain songs of hers that I can tolerate and even a few I know completely by heart.  But thats because shes a pop icon and I would never begrudge her that.  However, with it being gay pride (and the concert swarming with people that irk me) and with Madonna changing her name to Esther and with everything she does making me want to cringe with overexposure, the idea of sitting in a stadium cheering for her made my insides curl up and die.  I just didnt want to go.    Im kind of proud of myself.  All I hear from my friends is This is a once in a lifetime opportunity!  And my response is For who?  Me or Madonna?    When my kids ask me if Ive ever had the chance to see Madonna in concert I will say I had VIP tickets and decided to go out to dinner with my boyfriend instead.  They will respond But Daddy, couldnt you have gone to dinner with Daddy any other day?  And I will say Babycakes, Daddy was the only gay man ever born that never had an interest in Madonna.  Now, if it was Alicia Keys or Jason Mraz or Nelly Furtado or a piece of shit dangling from a red kabbalah string, I would have gone in a second.  But to have Madonna attached to that piece of string totally ruined it.  Daddy does what daddy wants.  Not what others think he should do.    They will then say Oh Daddywe love you.  We will all hug each other and then we will all take dumps.  Ah.  Gay Pride is slowly winding down.  Im off to lunch today with my friend Mariah.  We will eat in Chelsea and cruise all of the boys while sipping on wine and chowing on some sort of gay themed food product (probably juicy hot dogs slathered in cum).    Tomorrow Im to meet up with my friends from college (56B in da house!) for a bachelorette party.  We will drive around the city in a limo and I will be the only gay man in NYC to attend straight bars during Gay Pride Week.  But Rita will be there, so it will be all worth it.    On Sunday, its off to the big parade!  Then there will be lunch and much much much bar hopping.  I will hang around as long as I can and then its home to bed with me.  I hate going out drinking on Sundays, cuz I need to start my Monday feeling somewhat in control.  And I have a huge week ahead of me.  Two theatre meetings, my birthday and Fourth of July.  YIPES!  My dick almost shriveled into a vagina it got so intimidated by all these plans.    I hope you all enjoy your weekend!    If you see Madonna, tell her Im truly sorry I didnt have the chance to share a carrot stick with her after the show.  I was busy picking nits out of Courtney Loves hair.  She really needed my help.  PEACE OUT!

       I am Eggsausted   Last night we had a very intensive theatre meeting.  Since we always meet in Manhattan, Kelly and I decided that we should be polite and trek out to Brooklyn so that the third member of our group, Meg, didnt have to do ALL of the traveling.  It was such a beautiful night and perfect for the trip.    On the way down to Brooklyn, the trains got fucked up and I ended up standing on some random platform waiting for a new train to rescue me from the clutches of the subway station.  Out of nowhere, I felt someone pull on my bag and I whip around to see Kelly standing behind me.  We traveled separately to the meeting and how she ever found me in the chaos of the NYC transit system, Ill never know.    We ride to our destination and on the walk to Megans apartment, we run into her boyfriend, Jason.  After talking to him for a few moments, we continue to walk and then bump into our friend, Anne.  HUH!?  Brooklyn is a VERY big place and how all of this happened in a matter of 20 minutes Ill never know.  Craziness, I tell ya.  Once at Megans we climbed up to her roof and did the read-thru of the script we wrote.  Sitting up high, glasses of wine in hand, the landscape of Manhattan looming beautifully in the backgroundit was a very surreal and remarkable experience.  It almost made the 60 minute subway ride to get there worth it.  Almost.    We are pretty excited about the headway we have made with this show.  I mean its super good.  And Im not one of those people to toot a horn unless its worthy of being tooted.  Weve worked very hard and it shows.  I just hope it pays off in the end.  Leaving it in Gods hands, as I cant be trusted to leave it in my own.    Last night when Paul got home, he found me eating a dinner consisting of potato chips and BBQ sauce.  I put on a sad face and said Im hungry.  His face fell and he immediately took me to get a nice and healthy Israeli meal at a new restaurant down the street.  I mean, who DOESNT eat falafel at 12:30am?  As we were eating our hummus and pita, Paul mentioned that he received two free Madonna tickets from a friend of his at work.  Joe, we HAVE to go see Madonna tomorrow night.  After I finished vomiting in my mouth, I told Paul that I had very little to no interest in seeing Esther perform her overrated hits.  Its not that I dont respect Madonna for all that she has accomplished...Im just really tired and wanted a low key night; not a night of hanging out with fairy queens and 8 year old girls all screaming about how we are Material Girls for one reason or another.  If it means a lot to Paul, Ill go with him and sit patiently through the concert.  But if it was up to me, I would go immediately home after work, smoke a bowl, make a nice dinner and turn on repeats of  Scrubs  and  ER .  Whatever, Im sure my destiny is to see Madonna and I shouldnt complain.  Many people would kill for this opportunity.  I just wish they would kill me now so I wouldnt have to go.    Why is Alanis Morissette marrying Ryan Reynolds?  If youve seen  National Lampoons Van Wilder  than you know what a toolbox he is.  Its too bad really.  Ive always respected Alanis for her music and sing-song anger laden lyrics.  But now, she is really turning into a big, soft, cornball.  I mean, shes never had great taste in men.  Dave Coulier anyone?  I mean, she went down on him in a movie theater.    CUT	        IT 	        OUT!  Although my thighs say no, my belly says yes.  Pizza, I must run to you today.  I must run and collapse into your arms and be your love slave.  Pizza oh pizza, remember me on this special day.  I decided long ago, never to walk in anyones shadows.  If I fail, if I succeed, pizza knows that I believe. No matter what they take from me, they cant take away my dignity.    Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.  And to pizza.  To pizza and to me.

       Gay Pride continues   For me, last night was the official start to the gay pride week.  We all met at Pauls apartment right after work and had some cocktails while talking and playing loud music.  Luckily the old crotch from upstairs only came down once to tell us to turn the volume down on the stereo.  She sucks, but maybe she had a point.  But maybe she still sucks.  We played a couple of rounds of one my favorite card games, Cops and Robbers.  Its super fun and allows everyone the chance to break the ice with the other people in the room that they dont know very well.  The game went well, but I have to admit that it took me 20 minutes to explain the rules.  I mean, kindergarteners could pick it up faster, but I guess the combination of booze and marijuana made everyone brain dead to begin with.    Paul and I had purchased a bottle of champagne for everyone to share on top of many bottles of liquor and beer.  It was definitely a night for getting blasted and acting like a bunch of jackasses.  But thats what you do on gay pride?  Isnt it?  Eventually we made it out to B-Bar.  Although we got in right away, the place was jam packed with gays of all shapes and sizes.  There were big ones, little ones, red ones and blue ones; all flailing the arms and talking a mile a minute.  The crowd was so intense that we quickly snagged a table on the patio as soon as one opened up.  Since we had been drinking heavily for hours, we all decided that it was time to get some appetizers.  Mariah immediately ordered the chips and salsa and a burrito and Angie shared the Caesar salad and calamari that Paul and I ordered.    At some point during the meal, Pauls phone rang and it was his co-worker and friend, Kimmy.    Now heres why Kimmys presence in our life is funny:  Last Friday on my way home to Albany, Angie and I had a discussion on how we desperately need to have new people in our group of friends.  Unfortunately, we are all so picky about who we let in that its very rare for us to meet someone cool enough to chill with.  Anyway, we decided that it would be best for all of us if we found a heavy-set black lesbian to be our friend.  Since I dont travel in many ethnic circles, I thought it would be impossible for us to ever meet anyone that fit our description.  Then enter Kimmy.  Out of nowhere, Paul suddenly has this new heavy set, black lesbian friend.  HUH!?  And hilarious!  I immediately told him to bring her to the bar.  And that is exactly what he did.    Kimmy showed up kind of late in the evening, but Angie and I were still happy to have found our new girl.  Kims ordered a margarita pizza and I grilled her on all of the importants.  Are you a lesbian?  Where do you live?  When did you come out of the closet?  How does it feel to be one of the only black employees at the restaurant you work for?  Yeah, I let nothing slide ever.  Im a bit too straight forward for some people, but Kimmy took it all with stride and answered every question perfectly.  She passed every one of my little tests.  Eventually Mariah and her (slut) girlfriend had to go home and Angie followed them out (Angies got this new teaching position fellowship thing and she is swamped with work.  But that didnt stop her from rocking out to the best of her ability.  She stumbled home just in time to throw herself into bed).  Paul and I stayed at B-Bar so that Kimmy could finish her pizza and drink.  After some more grilling from me, I invited Kims back to Pauls apartment for a quick smoke.  She gratefully accepted and we made our way home, not forgetting to stop for Big Macs along the way.  Ay yi yi.  We had a great time talking during our smoke and I decided that Kimmy is totally a new friend to have.  She is smart and independent and real.  And did I mention that she is a stand up comic?  HILARIOUS.  She fits every requirement that Angie and I were looking for in a new group member.  Well see how it goes.  Paul walked Kims out and I shoved the rest of my burger in my mouth.  When he got back upstairs, we watched a bit of television and then I threw my drunk ass into bed.  At first I had the ultimate in bed spins and really thought I was going to barf all over Pauls cute face.  But instead I passed out, not waking until Paul rolled out of bed this morning.  What a night.    I was pleased to see that a group of us could go out and not have any drama.  There were no fights, no yelling, no hitting, no nothing.  Just a calm, relaxing evening on a gay pride Tuesday.  Ahhhhvery nice.  Tonight I have an intensive theatre meeting.  We have finished our script and tonight is the first full read through.  YAY!  I cant believe that we are at this point already.  Seeshit really does get done if you stick to deadlines and keep your ass in gear.    Also, thank you to those people who sent me their ideas for the song that plays during the  Summerland  preview.  Unfortunately, I had the show wrong.  The song actually plays during the preview of the new movie  The Notebook .  It goes something like this:  shumma shum shum wanta feel tonight.  Shumma shum for the rest of MYYY life.    Do you know it now?  Im super good at translating songs into written words without music.  You love it and you jizz over it.  Now wipe up your cunty and lets have a good afternoon, shall we?  Time for me to eat my sammich.  Yem.  I love sammiches.

       Tangents and Nell Carter (yes again)   Today is rainy and annoying.  But tonight is the official beginning of Gay Pride week for me!  So on one hand I hate today.  And on the other, I am totally turned on by today.  And with my last hand, I pinch my nipples so hard it feels good.  And milk came out.  And I drank it.  And it tasted good.  As soon as this SLOW fucking day ends, I will go over to Pauls apartment to get ready to go to B-Bar.  I super love B-Bar.  Especially during gay pride week.  Everyone dresses in their finest gay clothes and shows off their finest gay moves.  Its all very trite and wonderful.  Maybe Britney Spears will show up so I can puke on her knee.  Shes been known to stop by there.  If I see her, I will destroy her.  I will destroy her with the puke in mah belly!  When my webpage went (mysteriously) down a couple of weeks ago, I was forced to change my template in order to keep everything I had in my database.  As you can see, it now looks like melted, brown poop.  In any case, I lost my sitemeter in the process and I decided just to leave it off for a few weeks.  To be totally honest, the amount of people that visit my site is really inconsequential to me.  I just like writing bullshit every day and I get a real kick out of the emails I receive.  Anysnoodle, I put the sitemeter back on yesterday afternoon and was VERY surprised to find out that my number of hits Ive been getting has increased exponentially since Ive changed over to my new diarhea colored page.  I didnt realize that the world was filled with people who ENJOY looking at shit all day.  I mean thanks for stopping by, but you may have a problem.  Poop lover.    There are places that accept people like you.  Its called jail.  I watched  The Casino  last night on Fox.  Loved it.  Nuff said.  I heard Ryan Cabreras song last night for the second time.  On both listens, I had hoped he would die.  A horrible rotten death.  SHIT SONG WRITER AND UGLY FUCKER.  He is also dating Ashlee Simpson, who, as we know, is a brilliant artist.  I mean, she writes the most beautiful poetry of BULLSHIT I HAVE EVER FUCKING HEARD!  Ashlee, Jessicas dimwit sister, and her boyfriend, Ryan, are both managed by her father.  And they are both hoping to take their careers to the next level by DYING!  DIE DIE DIE!  Fucking muscial wastepots.  Okin other newslast night I was having my late night cup of tea with my good friend Nell Carter.  She had just finished singing some bluesy, soulful medley of pieces when I realized that it was time to watch  Who Wants to Marry My Dad? .  As I went to change the channel, Nell reminded me that I am not a fucking LOSER who watches the SAME MUNDANE garbage on television every night.  I told her that I thought the show might be good for a laugh and she retorted with Please Joe.  Dont even PRETEND to think its funny.  The show sucks my big black tits.  I hugged her and we went to bed.  While we were making black love, I heard someone outside my window talking to Frankie Muniz.  They were being so loud and it was driving me CRAZZZY!  I reached out the window and squished him with my thumb.  Little fucking know it all prick.  Do NOT interrupt my Nell love making with your  Malcom in the Middle  snore filled hijinks.  I hate you and your little  Cody Banks  smarm.  Nina SkyI love you.  Ill move ya body if you want.    Im sorry, but is  Entertainment Weekly  becoming my new porn?  First Jake Gyllenhaal on the cover and now Christian Bale?  YUMSICLE!  Personally I want to look like Jake and have Christian inside my butt.  I mean, I know Im an anal virgin, but Ill lose it to Chris.  Hes so talented and beautiful.  And the  Batman Begins   movie sounds like the coolest Batman to ever be made.  Im pretty excited.  And horny.  Does anyone know who sings the song that plays on the  Summerland  preview?  I think its  Summerland  that Im talking about, but I dont remember (all those new summer shows suck balls).  If you have any idea what song Im referring to, please send me an email with your thoughts.    I guess thats it.  Time to go be gay!    Enjoy the rest of your day my sweet little gaylords.

       And What a Weekend it Was   Ive now officially had two weekends in a row that netted me 8 hours of sleep in total.  Although this is gay pride week and Im sure to overdue it yet again, I am MUCHLY looking forward to sleeping in my own bed.  It doesnt happen often, so I try to enjoy every second of it when it does.    So!  On Friday, my friend Angie drove us home to Albany.  The trip flew by as we smoked pot and cigarettes and blared music.  It was the fastest drive home Ive ever had.  We pulled into my driveway at 4pm.  My parents werent even home from work yet!  I quickly threw a load of laundry in and made myself a drink.  Once my parents arrived, there were hugs and kisses and a few more drinks and eventually we got our acts together and went out to a local restaurant for dinner.  The weather was beautiful so we were able to sit in the patio area and smoke cigarettes!  We had a bottle of wine, really wonderful food, and non-stop conversations about everything under the sun.  Our waiter, although only 17, had a super amazing hot great awesome body and I flirted with him the whole time.  Im pretty sure he was gayor he just liked the fact that I was drolling all over his arms and chest.  After dinner, we went back to my house so I could open up my birthday presents.  My parents went overboard as usual, giving me cash, the new Simpsons Season 4 DVD, a couple of cds and movies.  You know, the staples to every gay mans collection.  The clothes my mom got me were damn hilarious, so we took those back on Saturday afternoon.  We ended up staying up until about 3:30-4am playing games.  I was pretty wasted and tired by that time.  On Saturday, I went tanning with my mom and shopping for new clothes.  She is so great to chill with.  We laugh and laugh and make fun of everyone else whos not having as much fun as us.  You understand.  We were supposed to go to Saratoga for the harness track races, but since the Phish show was going on, we decided to stay home and play some more games.  Angie arrived around 9 and we had a beer together before heading downtown.  Now, the funny thing about going out to the gay bars in Albany is that you always run into the same people.  There just isnt enough variety.  Anyhizzle, Angie and I ended up going to all three of the major gay bars.  We had drinks at all of them, but only one of them had a substantial crowd.  A bunch of Mariahs friends met up with us and we had a good time dancing and joking around.  Eventually the night left just four of us rocking out.  And of COURSE, I ended up run into a penis that I have sucked in the past.  The penis has a name and its Barry and he lives in Syracuse.  So why was he in Albany at Waterworks on the same night as me!?  Very strange and over the top.  He looked old and ridiculous and I hugged him and pranced out of the bar.  It was super hilarious and man, I am SO glad that I am not still dating him.  Bitch looked like shit.  When I finally got home that night, I surprised myself when I threw up.  Guess I drank more than I had intended.  Ooooooooooops.  I shoved a slice of pizza in my face and went to bed.  6 hours later I woke up and had lunch with my parents for fathers day.  I cant explain how much fun I had with both my mom and dad this weekend.  They are incredible people.  And my dad surely loved the new CD player I got him as a present.  Angie and I took the train home together and had some wine.  We played hangman and talked philosophical about anything and everything.  Eventually we arrived back in NYC and we went our separate ways.  Upon arriving at Pauls apartment, I was overjoyed to find him in a great mood.  He immediately gave me baby kisses and ended up taking me out to one of the best dinners ever!    I eat out in this city at least 4 times a week and there are STILL places that blow my mind.   Inos  was one of those places.  If you are ever in the mood for a bottle of wine and some excellent and creative tapas,  Inos  will be your friend till the end.  You should definitely get best friend necklaces.  You can be Be Fri and  Inos  can be st ends.  It will work best that way.      Finally at 10pm last night, I rolled into bed.  My goodness, my eyes couldnt stay open for a second after that.  I have to admit, I cant WAIT to get into bed tonight.  I dont think Ill emerge at all.  Well unless I have to take a shit.  Then Ill do it on my carpet and clean it up in the morning.  Get sleep now, cuz gay pride begins tomorrow!    YAY GAYS!

       My Birthday has Officially Begun!   I am muchly excited to go home to Albany this weekend.  My parents have planned a weekend of fun for my upcoming birthday.  Since I dont have a free weekend from now until the beginning of August, my parents decided to do an early birthday celebration with me.  They are super cute when it comes to things like this.  Tonight we will have a relaxing cocktail (as my mom called itand she doesnt even drink!) and open up my presents.  After that, we will go out to a classy type dinner.  And then after that we will return to my house to play some card games.  Im pretty psyched about it.  Since my brother wont call us at home until Sunday, I get to sleep in really late tomorrow morning.  I cant explain how badly I need a day like that.  Its been a couple of weeks since I had more than 7 hours of rest in one sitting.  After I awake, my mom and I will go tanning since my body is a shade darker than a bottle of Elmers glue.    We will have a light dinner together and then head up to Saratoga to the harness track!  Last year when we went, one of the horses broke free and ran away from the track.  When it reached the fence, separating the track from the street, it jumped it and smashed the harness that it was carrying behind it.  The crowd gasped and I felt the tears rising in my throat.  (Ive always hated any type of animal crueltyfuck you I still like going to the track)  A few moments later we heard the gun shot and the horse was killed in front of thousands of cheering fans.  Ok sike.  The horse was never shot.  I took it home and made a spot for it in my bedroom.  In any case, the track is always fun when I go with my parents.  We bet like three dollars on each race.  Since none of us know anything about gambling, we always pick the horse that has the best name.  I tend to go for the horse that I think is the gayest one of all of them.  Probably why I never win any money.  I mean, if it was a horse drag show, I would be sure to win lots of dough.  After the track, my parents will drop me off at my friend Mariahs house and I will go trapsing in and out of the Albany gay bars for a couple of hours.  I LOVE going to Albany gay bars.  Even if Im extra fat and covered in teenage acne angst, Im still looked at as fresh meat and the guys will buy me drinks.  Heh heh heh suckers.  At some point I will stumble into my parents house and go to bed.  On Sunday morning, my brother will call us at the house.  After talking to him, I will go to brunch with my moms and dads for Fathers Day.  Im hoping we go to Dennys.  Its not very classy, but at classy places you dont get to order things like Moons Over My Hammy.  Or maybe even the Play it again Slam!  HILARIOUS.  Ill probably get a cheeseburger.  Thats what I ALWAYS get, no matter what restaurant I ever go to.  But if we are at Denny's, I will order it like this:    "Hi waiter.  May I please have a diet kizzle and a cheeseburger in the sky with diamonds?"  The waiter will say:  "What's a cheeseburger in the sky with diamonds?"  Me:  "What's a moon over my hammy?"  The waiter:  "I see.  One cheeseburger in the sky with diamonds coming up."  Me:  "Go fuck yourself."  It will be great!  At 2pm, my friend Angie and I will board the train and head back to NYC.  Im sure we will have a couple glasses of wine on the train.  I mean, its just what you do.  God forbid we ever have a 3 hour period of our lives without shoving booze down our gullets.  I mean, as I said, its just what you do.  Then next week is GAY PRIDE week in NYC!  Then the week after that is my actual birthday (July 2nd)!  Then the week after that I DIE!  It will be a crazy exhausting, but crazy fun couple of weeks.  And it all starts today!   WOO HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!   I mean, yahoo.  Im going to be 27, so I need to start acting like it.  yahoo.

       NELL CARTER IS BACK FROM THE DEAD  FO REAL!   You are never going to believe how hilarious today is for me.    I just opened up the mail at my job and there was a package for me inside of it.  I mean, sure, my birthday is coming up in a couple of weeks, so its not totally out of the ordinary for some special gifts to come in the mail.  In any case, I open up the box to find a cd of Nell Carter singing with the San Francisco Gay Mens Chorus!  Now, if you know me at all, you know that I love and adore Nell Carter.  Her voice, her presence on stage, her overall attitudeit took her dying for me to realize how much I love her. I also found out, post death, that she was a lesbian!  AMAZING.  I just love love love her.    Unfortunately, it doesnt seem as though Nell made any solo cds when she was alive.  However, I mentioned to my mom, two weeks ago, that I really wanted to find a cd that had Nell Carter singing on it.  Today, I received that gift from my mom.  Is she not the BREAST mom ever?  I am elated and thrilled to be in possession of this wonderful treasure.    Ill have to hug my mom extra hard when I go home this weekend.  In other news, last night I drank a bottle of wine, ate a rack of ribs, and split a cheeseburger with some friends at Dallas BBQ.  Needless to say, the pork slathered beef tasted SO good going down.  Unfortunately, it hasnt come out my ass yet, so I am really wondering where it went to?  While we were sitting outside in the patio, sucking down our TEXAS sized margaritas, a huge cockroach went running by and almost jumped on my friend Angies face.  She screamed, I laughed, the cockie roach got away.  Then on the way home, I was crossing the street, all full of ribs and happy, when a menacing Asian woman came flying down the street on a ten speed bicycle.  I jumped out the way just in time and Mariah calls out in the womans face, I STOP FOR NOBODY!  I died laughing and gave her the esteemed award of Joke of the Day.  You really had to see the Asian womans face.  She was unphased by my presence in the street.  She was determined to speed away as fast as Asianly possible.  When we got back to the apartment, Paul surprised us by getting out of work early.  We had one last glass of wine together and then Paul and I stayed up for another hour talking about our plans to move in together.  We are hoping to make this transition in early December.  Until now, he has been fairly hesitant in discussing the details.  But last night, we talked and talked and talked and I finally got him to admit how excited he really is.  Its a big, yet totally necessary step for us in our relationship.  Its time.  And I am thrilled about it.  I figure, if we get a one bedroom apartment, and we both pay what were paying now, we will get a PHATTY AWESOME crib in the best part of Manhattan.  We can spend just about $2,000 a month on a place and that meansREALLY NICE PLACE!  YAY!  I really need to buy myself some summer clothes.  I always move so slow on that shit and I end up having to wear sweaters in this awful NYC heat.  H & M here I come!  Open your vagina and let me in.    I so loving shopping in vaginas.

       Plays and Naps   I am here to say that the play we are writing for the theatre company is just about finished!    We had a wonderful meeting last night and the ideas were flowing like blood out of a womans vagina.  You understand.  After the meeting was over, I wrote the ending of the play.  It was so much fun to do.  Using the character development that Kelly created, I was able to write a pretty cool ending for us using her work as a springboard.  I am very happy with how it all turned out.  This week, Kelly and Megan, will spend time filling in some of the holes and by next Tuesday, the entire script will be finished!  We are hoping to have copies out to our friends by the end of the month and we will use their feedback and comments to fine tune any last minute problems.    I am overwhelmed with pride and joy.  We chose to write our own play, which is so sketchy.  Any time someone tells me that they are writing a book or a screenplay, etc, I am immediately filled with doubt.  However, this play came out really good.  If people dont like it, I would be very surprised.  Its smart, funny, intense, and totally appropriate as a contemporary piece of fiction.  We have acomplished something great here and I cant begin to say how relieved I am.  We are writers afterall!  In other news, I must say that the cast of  The Real World: San Diego  has proven that the series is not dead.  Last nights episode hit some soft spots in my heart.  From Jaqueeses moms speech about forgiveness to Cameron and Robyn throwing themselves into the water to get out of work, I was impressed with how much I can still (at the age of 26) relate to these people.  Lets pretend that  The Real World: Las Vegas  never happened, shall we?  Heres to the hope that the series will continue to focus on the real issues facing the young people of America and not just on sex and booze.    After the show, I made myself a nice dinner and settled in to bed.  Yesterday took a lot out of me.  But oddly enough, the cold thats been resting comfortably in my head for the last two weeks, subsided a bit.    Ive always been of the theory Drink through a sickness.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt.  The theory itself is pretty fucked up, but I have to admit, I feel much better today.  Tonight I have plans to hang out with my friends, Angie and Mariah.  Its been over a week since Ive spent some quality time with either of them and we are long overdue.  June has been so hectic.  There doesnt seem to be much of a reprieve in sight, but Im hoping that I will be able to find a day to sleep in at some point.  If Joe doesnt have some time to himself, he becomes a very bitter girl.  Alright, time for my daily nap.    I dont know how I would survive without having that hour to myself every day.    Lately, it just seems so unbelievably necessary.

       Bits and Tids:  BitsTids   Time to catch everyone up on a few of the bits going on in my life.  Im sure EVERYONE has been waiting in EAGER anticipation to read about my tids.  So many tids, so little time.  1)	Paul has been sick for just about two weeks now.  His cough and sore throat seems to never go away.  At first it was driving me crazy cuz I couldnt sleep with him hacking his face off all night.  Now, its driving me even crazier because I have a permanent cold sitting in MY nose and throat.  Its not horrible, but its not pleasant.  Every morning I must cough up at least 4 gallons of garbage before I can move on with my day.  2)	I (somehow against my better judgement) became a fan of the WBs  Superstar USA .  For the last month or so, Paul and I have watched every episode faithfully.  If you havent seen the show, the premise is this:  thousands of wannabe singers (a la American Idol (snore)) audition for what they think is the next big talent show.  Those who can actually sing get the boot.  Those who embarrass themselves, but also think they possess unbelievable talent, move on to the next round.  Eventually, there were 12 people competing (horribly) for the title of SUPERSTAR.  None of the contestants knew the show was a prank until the final episode last night.  Deep down I felt really horrible for each of these terrible performers.  But it was sort of like watching a train wreck; you know you shouldnt stare, but you just have to.  Last night they crowned Jamie as the countrys worst singer.  Her face hit the floor when she saw clips of how terrible she performed.  But then, against all laws of mankind and after hearing that she won because she sucked, Jamie says I am so excited to begin my career as a pop superstar.  Britney, give me a call so we can put a video together.  HUH?  WHAAAAAAAAAAAA?  It takes a special person to SEE and HEAR that they SUCK (and was part of a huge PRACTICAL JOKE), only to then turn around and demand Britney Spears to call them.  I mean, Britney sucks too, but shes made a living on sucking.  Jamie has done no such thing.  I about puked with joy, although I wish she had cried when she found out she was a loser.  That would have tapped into my sensitive side a little more.  3)	Even though my 27th birthday isnt until July 2nd, I am going home this weekend to celebrate with my parents.  In typical Joe style, my birthday must take place for two full weeks in order for it to be a success.  I have asked for a home entertainment system as well as cash, cash, cash.  My parents spoil me rotten, especially with my brother still being in Iraq, so Im muchly excited to rip into my gifts this weekend.  We have plans to go out to a nice dinner, play a hundred rounds of my favorite card games, and up to the harness track in Saratoga.  I mean, could anyone ask for a better weekend?  The only downside is that my friend, Angie, invited me to see the Phish show at SPAC on Saturday night.  Unfortunately I had to bail so that I could spend the whole time with my parents.  I was never a REAL Phish fan, but now that theyre breaking up, I would so love to be there.  Maybe in the afterlife.  4)	Speaking of afterlife, I have found a way to summon Nell Carter from the dead.  It will take about a pint of my blood and one of the hairs off her head.  I think I can swing that.  Ill do just about anything to get that girl back in my life.  (Winkles!)  5)	I had ANOTHER hamster multiplying dream the other night.  Once again, they began multiplying within their cages and I had to throw them out the window.  This time it was my brother trying to calm me down and help kill the monster hammies.  He was so helpful, even though I was screaming at the top of my lungs out of frustration.  I woke up feeling dirty and gross again, the way I usually feel after this maniacal repeating dream.  6)	I LOVE the  Next Action Star  already.  Last night was a contestant preview and I ate up every second of it.  Im sorry, but any show that has hot guys running around and doing hot things makes me quiver with excitement.  Who cares that none of them can put a sentence together.    7)	Paul and I have a new favorite place to eat.  Its called Bullys.  For the last 6 months, we have ordered delivery from Bullys just about once a week.  I always get the cheeseburger and fries and Paul alternates between the shrimp po boy and the Chicken Parm. Sub.  The food is super good, pretty affordable, and always comes within 45 minutes.  If I didnt want to be an actor so badly, I would SO want to work at Bullys.  You know how it is.  Cuz of cheeseburgers and all.  8)	 Its time to heat up my Lean Cuisine Pizza!  Yem!  And half the fat and calories of a normal slice.  Svelt Joe, here I come!  Ok, yall!  If you have a great day, Ill have a great day.  The weathers beautiful and my mood is good, so Ill do my best to keep up my end of the bargain.

       Friends: They Can Change the World with a Hug   All I can say is that I had the most wonderful weekend of my life.    I spent all of Friday night with my darling friend Rita.  We sat down on her deck, with glasses of wine in our hands, at 6pm and didnt move from our spot (except to get more wine) until midnight.  I would even follow her to the bathroom so we wouldnt miss a single second of talk time.  If thats not a testement to our friendship, I dont know what is.    Rita and I discussed everything from my personal relationships in NY to the upcoming show Im working on to our current favorite movies, music and TV personalities.  In fact, we talked so fiercely and for so long, that we both ended the night with hoarse voices.  I think I finally rolled in to bed sometime around 3:30am.    On Saturday, Rita and I took a VERY long time eating our Taco Bell and watching VH1.  Eventually we got our shit together and drove down to Utica to see our friend, Jessicle!  After a tour of her house, she and her fiance supplied Rita and I with some beer and wedding tasks to complete.  I got to help pick out the songs for the reception (which was so fun!) and I have to admit that I am very happy with the seating arrangements as well.  As Rita and I said in unison As long as she and I are sitting next to each other, it doesnt matter who else is at our table.  Around 6pm, the four of us headed over to Jessicas parents house for a big party.  I have to say, I had the time of my life.  Rita and I were attached at the hip and all of the guests at the party wanted a piece of our action.  We talked a lot about our lives and goals and dreams, and everyone I met was so welcoming and friendly.  Everyone already knew Rita from years of her being friends with Jessicle, so I was able to use her as my springboard when talking to all of these new faces.  We chilled at the party for awhile only leaving to go back to Jessicas place for some cards and more beer!  What was it?  My birthday?!  Rita and I stayed up after Jessica and her fiance went to bed and we talked and giggled some more.  I slept a total of 5 hours this weekend, but every second of the trip was worth it.  The only downside to the entire visit was getting on the train to come back to NY.    I said goodbye to my wonderful friends and as soon as I sat in my seat on the train, tears filled my eyes.    Lately, Ive been dealing with so much nonsense in my personal life while NYC has been weighing heavily on my shoulders.  I dont get to hang with these girls often and I kept saying how happy and fulfilled I felt by being with them.  The old days were so much easier than it is now.  Everyone just seemed to have a lot more respect for eachother back then.  Weird that as I get older, this level of understanding seems to fade away.  But Ill take the peace and quiet, if only for one weekend.  On to another brutal week, but I know I can do it!     Sorry for the personal shout out everyone, but Im sure you dont mind :    Thank you Rita.  You know how badly I needed you this weekend.  Your honesty and support has always been a necessity in my life.  You give it to me straight and you give me the confidence I need when making hard decisions.  I cant think of anyone else in my life that I need as desperately as you.  I wouldnt have been able to come back here if it werent for you.  I know it was hard to let me go, as it was hard for me to leave.  Im counting the days until your next visit.

       Off on a Trip!   Today I leave to go see my bestest friend Rita in Syracuse.  As many of you remember I went to Syracuse on May 1st to be a part of Ritas wedding!  Although its only been 6 weeks since Ive seen her, I have easily shriveled up and died without her presence in my life.  I need to talk to her, to hug her, to LAUGH with her.  Really, one night with her seems to solve any problem I have going on in my life.    Most likely, we will sit on her deck and drink wine and smoke cigarettes and talk about everything thats happened in the last 6 weeks.  I cant wait to see pictures from her honeymoon and wedding.  I cant wait to show her the stuff Ive been working on for the theatre company.  And I cant wait to play games!  Although Rita loves to knit, she fulfills my gaming request every time I roll into Syracuse.  Ok, that made Rita sound like the ultimate granny.  Well, she is 65 so I guess that makes sense.   Tomorrow, Rita and I will drive to Utica to see another one of our friends, Jessica.  Jessica gets married in July and since Im a groomsman, I must get fitted for my tux before its too late.  From what I hear, Jessicas brother is having a birthday party that night, so Rita and I will attend the event with big smiles on our faces and hopefully liquor in our veins.  The last time I saw Jessicas brother he was like 10 years old and 5 feet tall.  Now hes supposed to top 6 ft.  Yipes!  What if I want to do him while Im there?  Overall, Im much in need of getting out of the city.  I love going upstate when the weathers nice.  Everything smells so good and people are in better moods.  Also, the cigarettes cost $4 a pack and for methe trip is worth it just for that.  Well, and also for Rita.  Have great weekends!  Drink a gallon of your favorite beverage and eat at least 4 slices of pizza.  Otherwise, this weekend would be a bomb fo you fo sho!  Ardios!

       My First Career Step   So I did it.  I went to my first big networking party in NYC.  It wasnt as much of an audition as I had hoped, but it was definitely a good chance for me to meet a few agents in this city and to start building my list of contacts.    There were hundreds of people at the event and because I attended by myself, I started to feel a bit uncomfortable, having no one to bullshit with while I was waiting in line.  I mean, not kidding.  Hundreds of people.    I stayed for about an hour and in that time, I connected with five agents, three of whom took my name and info and gave me theirs in return.  Initially, I was nervous that I wasnt going to be able to handle myself in this type of situation.  But, everyone was very nice and helpful.    I explained that I was currently working for a non-profit theater company in NYC.  They asked which one and when they said they hadnt heard of it, I told them all about the mission statement and what we have done over the last year.  The majority of the agents seemed pretty impressed with my desire to work, regardless of not getting paid or accumulating points to enter into the union.    The hightlight of the experience was when a producer for the agency walked up to me and asked if I would be interested in reading for a role for an upcoming independent film.  I immediately said yes and we sat down and talked for a few minutes.  He (Frank) explained that he liked my look and resume and that, in a couple of weeks, he was doing an audition for the lead roles of his low budget movie.    My excitement burned in my stomach as I listend to Frank describe the movie and the parts available.  Then the clincher, they will be filming the movie during the first three weeks of August.  NOOOOOO! Not that its set in stone, but my brother is supposed to come home during the first week of August.  I explained my situation to him and he told me that I should still call him in a couple of weeks about the reading and if I found that I was available, we should definitely get together again and talk.    Overall the party was too much for me.  I felt out of place having no one to talk to during the down time.  But on the flip side, I felt so proud of myself for taking the risk and goingall by myself.  I definitely believe I was one of the best looking guys there.  And although I saw hundreds of gay men, I was one of the few masculine ones.    So, well see.  I submitted my headshot and resume to two more producers for other upcoming roles that I found through Backstage.  And next week Im planning on hitting up another agency for an audition.  At this rate, Ill be on a soap opera in no time!  Thanks for all the emails with well wishes.  You are all so supportive.  When I make it to the big time, I will make sure to tell you who I am, so you can say, I remember when he was cutting the shit five days a week for 2 years!    Its all very wonderful and surreal.

       THE DENTIST: AY AY AY!   This morning I went to see my dentist, as you could probably tell from the title of my post.  I have been terrified all week about going because I was to have a periodontal scraping today; scaling if you will.  Ick.  Even writing those words makes me shudder.    The people in my dentist office are just about the nicest and kindest people on the planet.  Ive become pretty cool with them since my last visit.  The receptionist, Nelly, gave me a huge hug when I walked in the door.  I totally needed that as my hands were shaking like little gay leafs.  They immediately called me into the recesses of the office and had me sit in the chair.  The hygenist said My name is Paris, I will be your hygenist today.  I responded with Hi Paris.  My name is terrified.  I feel like I could pee all over the floor.  She laughed and put her hand on my shoulder.  Oh Joe, Ill take very good care of you.  I sat in the chair for over an hour as Paris scraped and proded all inside my mouth.  She used some sort of hyper-intense spray that removed all the stains on my teeth.  (Ritamember the stains on the inside of my teeth from smoking?  Theyre gone!!!)  After she was done removing the stains, I said Are we almost done?  I dont know how much more of this I can take.  She responded with Oh Joe, we just started.  I have a lot more to do.  Nooooooooooooooooooooo!  I need more novocaine.  Paris kindly obliged and then scraped so far below my gum line that I thought she was going to accidentally pluck every tooth out of my head.  Needless to say, that didnt happen.  Finally, she was finished.  My gums were very swollen, but immediately looked much better.  The dentist came in and said What a remarkable difference.  Your teeth are in excellent shape and if you keep flossing and taking care of your gums, you should be back to normal in no time.  Phew.    Paris gave me a hug as I left (everyone hugs the Joe) and I made another appointment with Nelly for a follow up visit; just to make sure everything is healing appropriately.  I have a cleaning scheduled for October as well and I finally feel like Im on track with my teeth.  And what a smile I have!  Im sure to get a ton of movie roles now.  It will take a day or so for my gums to fully heal.  I mean, you dont dig that low and expect there to be no reprocussions.  But for the most partits all over.  I am so proud of myself for being a big boy and getting this taken care of.  I even went all by myself!  Shit, you should SEE the size of my balls today.  For all of you that prayed and wished me luckthank you.  Why is it that journalers seem to remember big things in my life when no one else in my personal life can?    By tomorrow I hope to have a gleaming, happy smile.    And I owe it all to Paris Hilton and Nelly, the singer.

       I have had ENOUGH   When I woke up this morning, I thought to myself I cant do it.  I cant work another day at my unsatisfying, shit job.  And with that attitude, I got dressed and got on the subway.  Once I sat down in my chair at my desk, I decided that the only person who is going to change my life is me.  I cant sit around anymore and wait to be discovered or wait for God to give me a handout.  I need to be proactive and cause change in my life.  It doesnt happen just because you want it more than anything else in the world.  You have to actually go out there and get it.  I immediately began pouring through various theatre publications trying to find information on how to obtain an agent, what auditions are available to Non-Union actors, and what I need to do to step out of my comfortable little world.  Then I came across a casting notice for an independent horror movie, filming in September.    There are 15 roles available, yet only five of them fit my physical description.  All of the parts are paid and the production should be finished filming by the end of September.  I immediately jumped on it and sent the company an email.  In turn, I received an email back from them telling me that not only are they casting for the horror movie, they are holding a workshop seminar on Wednesday night from 6pm-midnight.  At this seminar, there will be a variety of agents, producers, etc. that will be accepting resumes and headshots for potential actors.    Usually these type of events cost a couple hundred dollars to attend.  This one is free unless you show up after 8pm.  I registered myself and one guest (anyone want to go?) and plan on dressing nice and heading over immediately after work on Wed.    Who knows if anything will come of this?  But at this point, I dont care.  I need SO badly to get out of my hum drum job and to do what I came to this city to do.  The worst thing that could happen is that I meet other people who are involved in the entertainment business.  Coming from a place where I have NO contacts, the worst scenario seems pretty great.    Please say a little prayer for Joe CuttheShit.  He needs to get this acting career rolling in a much more profitable and productive manner.  I have the talent, the look and some decent experience.  All I need now is to accept the fact that rejection will happen and get my ass in gear.    The only person thats going to make this dream come true is me.

       Figures   Last night I went to see  Shrek 2  with my mom and Paul.  It was so nice to have an outing with my favorite woman on the planet and my favorite man on the planet.  The three of us sat together like a teeny happy family.  And I must say that the movie was fucking incredible.    Puss n Boots?  OMG.  I dont remember the last time I laughed so hard at a character in a movie.  He steals the show.  Completely.  Im sorry, but those CUTE LITTLE EYES!  Pure genius.  And that hairball?  That scene brought me back to one of my all time favorite moments in a movie:   National Lampoons Christmas Vacation .  The dog coughing up the chicken bones under the Christmas dinner table?  HILARIOUS!  The movie itself flies by and before you know it, its over.  What an absolute pleasure it was to see a movie of this quality.  Im sure  The Day After Tomorrow  will pale in comparison.  But then again, a tidal wave swallowing up NYC just might be the kick in the balls I need.  After the movie was over, I suddenly started to feel awful.  Paul and I put my mom in a cab and took the subway back to his apartment.  The entire way I started to feel, as Paul would say, fluish.  We got to the apartment, hung out with his roommate for a bit and then climbed into bed.  I laid there wide awake and feeling like garbage until well after 2am.  At one point, I said out loud I cant fucking sleep!  I thought Paul was fast into dreamland, but he responds Me either! and we curled up into the spooning position and lay there quietly.  When I woke up this morning my body felt as though a hundred dirty bricks had fallen on my face.  My stomach was rolling with nausea and my body ached like nothing else.  I slowly crawled into the shower and then slowly got dressed.  I guess Pauls psychosomatic sickness wasnt so psychosomatic after all.  Dont I feel sheepish?  And like shit.  Once I got to work, I started to feel a bit better.  Im doing my best to fight through this beast of a cold/flu/typhoid fever.  I have plans to go out with my friend Angie tonight and I would be MISERABLE if I was too sick to go.  Im thinking a little nap after work and maybe a bottle of vodka will get me where I need to be.  Unless Im vomiting out my ass, Im GOING out tonight.  Come hell or diarrhea water.    I just bought myself a chicken enchilada Lean Cuisine.  That should SURELY make my touchy stomach feel much better.  As Ari said, Ill be gone from work before that food hits your stomach and causes some damage.   The meal itself is pretty good.  Needs salt.  And I dont have any.  I guess thats it for today.    Have super good weekends.  Do something fun and laugh a lot.    Thats what Im hoping to do, so long as I dont puke on myself before I get to that point.

       Tids and Bits: Tidbits   Did you know that I wear two silver rings on my right hand?  Both are gifts from my boyfriend Paul.  But did you know that when I masturbate I have to remove the band on my ring finger and put it on the ring finger on my left hand?   Too much metal on one hand doesnt lead to conductive masturbation.  As though this is of less importance than my masturbation techniquesI received an email from my brother today that gave his TENTATIVE dates for re-deployment in the United States.  God willing, he will be leaving Iraq by July 1st and home with my family by July 22nd.  My heart leapt with joy and I experienced this  moment  of calmness that I havent felt since he left.  Im not getting my hopes upbut LordI know youre out there.  Please let this happen.  Tonight I am going to see  Shrek 2  with my mom and Paul.  First we will head over to Ranch One (for those of you who are not NYers, Ranch One is a fast food chicken sandwich place that is an addiction that my mother and I share).  Afterwards we will head down to see the movie.  I had such a super great time with her last night.  We ended up not going to dinner, but staying in her hotel room from 6-11pm drinking wine, smoking packs of cigarettes and talking about everything under the sun.  And oddly enough, only a few tears were shed (Its hard to talk about my brother with my parents and not lose it as you could imagine).  This has been one of the best visits with my mom that Ive ever had.  I wish she could stay for a week instead of for just a couple of days.  I saw someone wearing a Bart Simpson Underachiever t-shirt yesterday.  Umwhat?  There are so many things wrong with this style choice that I dont even know where to begin.  Please, if you are reading this and you own one of these t-shirts, put it to sleep with your Jams and your Jelly shoes.  Forever and ever Amen.  I was able to rope my friend Angie into seeing The Day After Tomorrow with me.  Of all the plans that I have for this weekend, going to see this movie is by far the highlight.  I love Nelly Furtado.  So much.  Too much.  More than a gay man should.  Id eat her tits if she asked me to.    I went home last night and played with my hammies for an hour or so.  The whole time I kept thinking Please dont multiply and have babies.  I dont want to have to throw you out of my bedroom window.  Luckily nothing like that happened.  But on the flip side, it took me 10 minutes to get my favorite hammie, Jim, to come out of his cage.  He sat upright, with his back turned to me for a long time.  I think he was pissed that Ive been out of my apartment for so long.  But  eventually  he crawled into my hand and we watched TV together for awhile.  He totally loves  Blind Date , so I watched back to back episodes at his request.  Sometimes I am wrong about things.  I do enjoy Jake Gyllenhaals acting, but I have always thought that he was kind of ugly.  Like in aI dont knowugly way.  Anyway, he was on the cover of last weeks Entertainment Weekly promoting his new movie and Im not kiddinghe looked absolutely beautiful.  Hes still not my ideal physical type, but I decided after studying the picture that I want to look exactly like him.  He has great hair and eyes and I think I may have to reconstruct myself to look like him.  Weird how this happens.  One minute I think hes semi-busted, the next minute, Im going on the Swan Pageant to look just like him.   I am in LOVE with the Lean Cuisine French bread Pizza.  It is so super good.  Low fat and calories and its microwavable.  If you are looking for a light lunch that wont go right to your hips and thighs, this is the food to eat.    Ashley Simpson, sister of Jessica Simpson, has a new single out.  It makes me want to hurl with uncreative boredom.  Come ON!  Why are people still signing record contracts with these cheap and overused knock off performers?  Enoughs fucking enough.  I mean, I totally fell into the Vanessa Carlton, Michelle Branch, Avril Lavigne (although I hate that bitch so much) trap.  But I have since grown up into a smarter woman and I refuse to get into Ashleys Pieces of Me bullshit.  Take your rip off and shove it up your sisters dumb ass.  And thats my tids and bits for this Thursday.  Enjoy your day!  I am surely going to try to do the same.

       The Hammies are at it Again!   Last night I went to bed around 11:30pm.  I took a couple sleeping pills since Ive had some trouble falling asleep these days.  It was easy last week when I didnt have to work.  But now that my schedule is all fucked up, Im like wide awake at midnight every night.  Anywaystangent over.  I took my pills and laid my pretty head on my pillow.  Yes, its pretty.  Fuck you for doubting.  I fell asleep pretty quickly and immediately found myself in my apartment.  It was like waking up in a Freddy Krueger nightmare.  (By the way, Microsoft Word corrected the spelling of the word Krueger for me.  I didnt know Bill Gates was such a horror fanatic) I woke up in my dream to find myself standing in my bedroom.  Instead of my usual two hamster cages, I had three.  The third one was broken and it had some sort of water slide attached to it.  It made a lot more sense in the dream.  When I looked further into the broken cage, I realized that my three hamsters had babies.  I mean, theyre all male, but I rationalized for myself that even though they all have penises, animals will find a way to survive.  You understand.  When the baby hamsters started going down the water slide, I began scooping them up and putting them back into their appropriate cages.  They bit me on my fingers the whole time.  As I dropped them into their cages, I noticed that more babies had been born.  As the dream progressed, all three cages began filling up with hamsters and I couldnt scoop them up fast enough.  Next thing I know there are hamsters biting my toes and running everywhere in my apartment.   I remember a distinct feeling of fear.  Some of the older hamsters in the cages were huge.  They looked like they were going to explode with more babies.  I screamed for Kelly to come in and help me.  Finally Kelly arrived and I yelled at her for putting the hamsters in the broken cage.  Now look what has happened!  Kelly laughed and thought it was pretty funny that there were so many pets running around our apartment.  Suddenly there was a knock on our front door and our OLD next door neighbors, Don and Joan, came in and told us that there were hamsters all over the floor of my building.  Were going to call the police if you dont take care of this mess!  I ran back into my apartment to find hundreds of hamsters in my bedroom.  I felt horrible, but I knew that the only way to get rid of them was to throw them out the window.  As I tried to toss them out, they latched on to my fingers with their razor sharp teeth.  I did one of those hand shaking wildly maneuvers, but the little bitches wouldnt let go.  I distinctly remember the pain they were inflicting on my poor gay hand.  I couldnt keep up with the hamsters reproducing and eventually I just sat down on my floor and cried.  Kelly came over to me and told me to quit it.  She called me a baby or something and I just sat there with hamsters biting my toes.  Eventually I woke up and remained awake for the rest of the night.    It was an awful dream and the weirdest part about it?  I had torn skin on my thumb this morning.  Maybe I bit it while I was sleeping?  Maybe the hamsters jumped into my real world a la Freddy Krueger.    In either case, Im going home and killing all of my hammies.

       BACK IN ACTION   Well, I am back from my mini-vacation.  It never is long enough and this time was surely no exception.  I dont know how Im going to get used to getting up when the alarm goes off.  Im so used to sleeping in until noon now.  It feels odd to get up at 7:30am.  I mean, who DOES that?  Oh yeahme.  Had an incredible week.  Got to see  Wicked  for free on Wednesday night.  Hung with a good friend on Thursday and again on Saturday.  Made my rounds as best as I could.  BUT the best part about the week was because of my (always surprising me) boyfriend.    On Saturday night, Paul and I had some drinks with his roommates and then went out to the classiest and best dinner I have ever had in NYC.  We were both a bit toasted from our cocktails, so we wanted to go eat locally.  He had heard that  urlLink Hearth  was a good place and that it was rated two stars, which for NYC restaurants is a HUGE deal.    We each ordered the tasting menu.  We both had 6 courses, including duck, trout, sirloin, and chicken.  We then had this amazing soup and dessert.  Paul ordered one of the most expensive bottles of wine on the menu and we followed it up with a beautiful bottle of dessert wine.  I mean, the kid spoiled me rotten and we had the best time of our life.  The billwell, lets just say that it takes me two weeks to make that kind of money.    Paul is known for spoiling me as well as his friends.  But lately, he and I have been doing so well, that he has taken great liberties in treating me like a true princess.  I mean, honestly, Ive never been happier with him.  He has been sweet and kind and funny as fuck.  I about shit every time he opens his mouth.  The dinner was justextra.  And what an extra it was!  If it werent for Paul, I would never get to see this side of NYC.  You know, the classy side.  Lets seewhat else?  Going into the weekend I hadnt seen  Kill Bill .  Now, Ive seen it three times.  I ADORE Quentin and his movies are like guilty pleasures times a thousand.  I have already asked for the movie for my birthday.  I  mean, I cant rent it EVERY weekend.  This week is hectic as my mom is coming to town!  Once a year she comes to NYC on business and we always have the time of our life.  Tomorrow night we are sure to have dinner togethermeaning we will drink two bottles of wine and call it a night.  On Thursday, Im bringing Paul and maybe a friend of mine to have a REAL dinner.  Time to show her what NYC is REALLY like.  Haha.  You know Im taking her to the gayest restaurants ever.  I mean, my moms a Gaylord, right?  Other than that, its pretty quiet in my world.  Very happy.  Very healthy (although Paul and I got some sort of flu on Sunday).  I am caught up on all my television programs and visits with people.  It feels like I am on top of everything right now and I know that cant be right.  Theres always some sort of drama right around the corner.  So Ill keep you informed as it happens.  It will make for a much better entry.  Cuz reallywhats Cut the Shit without SOME sort of petty drama going on?  I better go take ANOTHER shit now.  You dont eat 6 courses at a fancy dinner and expect to get it all out in one dump!    ENJOY THE DAY MY LOVELIES!

       16 Months Have Led To  This Moment    I'm leaving right now to pick my brother up at the airport.&nbsp; I'm excited, nervous, anxious, and overall...ready.&nbsp; The next two weeks will be crazy and fun and it will be the first time in a year and a half that my family has been all together.&nbsp;   I feel so blessed.&nbsp; Winfield survived his experience in Iraq.&nbsp; Now it's time for him to come home so we can take care of him, rather than him taking care of us.&nbsp;   I'll stop in while I'm away and give an update.&nbsp;   But for now...Ardios!&nbsp;   I gotta go to JFK!  &nbsp;

       I Now Own a Cell Phone    For the last three years, I have been cell phone free.&nbsp; I had one at one point as Paul gave it to me as a gift during our first Christmas together.&nbsp; I ended up going way over my alloted minute usage and he ulitmately had to pay about a thousand dollars in fees.&nbsp; Ooooooooops.&nbsp; It was after he paid that bill that the cell phone was taken away from me.&nbsp; Since then, I havent gotten a new one.   WELL.&nbsp; For my birthday Kelly offered to get me a new cellie.&nbsp; Last night we went to the local wireless provider and I picked out a new phone!&nbsp; It has a camera and text messaging and Instant Messenger and it even plays the radio when I plug in my headset.&nbsp; UM!&nbsp; What is it?&nbsp; The coolest phone ever?&nbsp;   When I woke up this morning I thought Fuck.&nbsp; Another day.&nbsp; And then I remembered!&nbsp; Another day, cept with a cell phone!&nbsp; I jumped out of bed, french kissed it, and got in the shower. &nbsp;I am very pleased.&nbsp; And Im finally and adult!   This weekend begins my life of chaos.&nbsp; Tomorrow is the wedding, Sunday my uncles come, Monday afternoon my brother flies in from Germany.&nbsp; Its hard to explain how I feel about all of this.&nbsp; Obviously Im overwhelmed with excitement.&nbsp; The idea of going home and having my brother there with me is surreal.&nbsp; Ive been visiting home just about once a month for the last year and a half and its never been the same without Winfield there.   On the flip side, Im pretty nervous to confront all of the emotions that have been buried since he left for the war.&nbsp; In order for me to survive the last year and a half, I have had to find a way to block my constant worry and upset.&nbsp; Now that he is safe and coming home, Ive started to realize how deep down Ive put all of this stuff.&nbsp; Its like Im just starting to deal with him being gone now.&nbsp;   Like I said, its hard to explain.   Overall, Im so happy and relieved that this moment has finally arrived.&nbsp; I cant believe that in 3 days, Ill be looking across the kitchen table at my brother.&nbsp; He will be eating his spaghetti and I will be thinking how much I love him and have missed him.&nbsp; For at least two weeks, my brother will be safe and sound.&nbsp; God has been so good to us and I do believe that since we have been so patient throughout this process, we have finally earned the reward of being a family again.   Only  3  more days   &nbsp;

       The Read Thru of Our New Play   &nbsp;  Last night at 7pm, we held the first read thru of our new play!&nbsp; 10 people showed up to be a part of the experience, including a playwright that we hadnt invited.&nbsp; We did our best at making the whole experience as professional, yet informal as we could.&nbsp; We distributed folders with a copy of the script, a ledger pad to take notes, and free pens for all!&nbsp; We also provided wine and beer to get everyone in the mood.  &nbsp;  We were all very nervous to show our work to these hand-selected folks.&nbsp; After two months of working very hard on our play, I think each of us was afraid that the play wouldnt be as mind-blowing as we had hoped.&nbsp; Overall, it went very well, but there were definite moments that made my face flush with embarrassment and frustration.  &nbsp;  First off, the girl who read the stage directions (which happens to be a HUGE part in our play) sucked ass.&nbsp; Ali barreled through the directions just to get them out of the way.&nbsp; Although everyone had a copy of the script in front of them, her lackluster performance caused everyone to tune out when she spoke.&nbsp; Because of that, I feel like they all missed out on some key character development moments.&nbsp; Ali used to work with us in the past, but since she quit the company, I have become so unimpressed with her level of passion and commitment.&nbsp; After last night, Im pretty sure I never want her to do anything for us or with us again.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  In any case, the reading went well.&nbsp; I have such high respect for both Kelly and Meg (the other people who co-wrote the play with me).&nbsp; They were such troopers throughout the whole night and at the end, when they could tell that I was frustrated and a bit upset, they did everything in their power to turn my attitude around.&nbsp; They have made working with them a highly enjoyable experience.  &nbsp;  But Im getting ahead of myself.  &nbsp;  At the end of the reading we held a talk-back session.&nbsp; We received some wonderful compliments as well as some very thought provoking questions.&nbsp; I was extremely pleased with the level of effort everyone put in towards understanding our play.&nbsp; But then, HE spoke, the playwright we hadnt invited in the first place.&nbsp; This is the first thing that came out of his mouth: I really love the concept of your play.&nbsp; However, I took 18 pages of notes that I would like to share with you.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  For about 20 straight minutes (during which I took a bathroom break), HE gave us criticism after criticism.&nbsp; Sure, some of what he said was definitely beneficial to us.&nbsp; But I think I lost all respect for him when he pulled out a piece of paper and said, Im going to teach you guys a very simple lesson on writing.&nbsp; He proceeded to draw a stick figure.&nbsp; Next to it he drew a box.&nbsp; In between the box and the stick figure, he drew a lightning bolt symbol of sorts.&nbsp; In every play you need to have a person, a goal, and a problem.&nbsp; Once you have that, everything else falls into place.  &nbsp;  WHAT?!?&nbsp; WHAT WHAT WHAT?!?&nbsp; I sat there as politely as I could, but who did this kid think he was talking to?&nbsp; Im sorry, did I just pick up a pen yesterday?&nbsp; Did I spend two months working on a script, only to forget that I must have some sort of dilemma within the story?&nbsp; Is the play about 3 people who just sit and stare at each other for an hour?&nbsp; UGH.&nbsp; I was immediately pissed off and furious.&nbsp; WHO did this kid think he was?!?  &nbsp;  With my face beat red from fury, I thanked him for his comments and we closed the meeting.&nbsp; Yes, we surely have more work to do on the script.&nbsp; As we learned last night, there are a few holes and a few things we can expound on.&nbsp; However, I can guarantee you that the protagonist, antagonist, and resolution were so blatantly obvious that all HE did was prove he wasnt paying nearly enough attention.  &nbsp;  Anyhizafter the meeting, Kelly and Meg pulled me from the dredges of my disappointment.&nbsp; I do need to learn how to take constructive criticism better.&nbsp; I also need to lower my exceedingly high expectations of myself.&nbsp; Ive been trained as an actor, not as a writer, so of course there is still a lot I need to learn.&nbsp; I just dont need someone drawing stick figures to explain the mechanics of writing to me.&nbsp; suckmyballs.  &nbsp;  Angie and I hopped into a cab after the meeting and spent the next hour discussing the show.&nbsp; She went through all of her notes with me and we worked out some of the residual issues that I was carrying with me.&nbsp; I eventually ended up drinking a bit too much, shoving my face with chicken nuggets and grilled cheese when Paul got home and collapsed into bed around 2am.&nbsp; I woke up this morning gasping for a glass of water.&nbsp; I guess a pack of cigarettes and a bottle of booze will do that to you.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So, we continue to write and rewrite and we move forward.&nbsp; Im SO glad we did the read thru and I am muchly grateful to everyone for joining us on this special occasion.&nbsp; I think Ill go home tonight, pull out my dolls, and try to teach myself how to be a better writer.  &nbsp;  If Barbie wants to marry Malibu Stacey, what issues will they have to overcome in order for that to happen?&nbsp; No, THINK Joe.&nbsp; You must have an issue for them to resolve.&nbsp; You cant just have them make-out for two hours.&nbsp; THATS not a play!  &nbsp;  For good measure, suck my hairy balls playwright extraordinaire!&nbsp;

       Im Completely Overwhelmed   &nbsp;  God, where do I start?  &nbsp;  In the next five days, I have to do the following things (you tell me if this all seems a bit over the top):  &nbsp;  Tonight is the first read thru of our Theatre Companys original work.&nbsp; After 2 and  months of writing and rewriting, we are finally ready to go forward with a read thru.&nbsp; The three of us who have collaborated on this project are all very nervous.&nbsp; To be an artist, you must be comfortable with risk taking.&nbsp; Tonights read thru is a prime example of that.&nbsp; What if no one likes our show?&nbsp; What if they think its badly written?&nbsp; What if the feedback is mostly negative?&nbsp; I am very proud of the work we have done, but until an outsider reads it, we wont know if its any good.&nbsp; Wish us luck please.&nbsp; This is a big night for the Company.  &nbsp;  As I write this, two friends of mine are crashing in my apartment.&nbsp; I adore these friends and am so happy that Im able to give them a room in Manhattan for a couple of days.&nbsp; However, with everything else I have going on, not being able to be in my bedroom, much less sleeping there, is stressing me out.&nbsp; These friends are not imposing on me at all.&nbsp; The timing is just unideal.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  On Saturday morning, I must get up at the crack of dawn and take a train to Long Island.&nbsp; I have yet ANOTHER wedding to go to this weekend.&nbsp; Luckily Im not in the wedding this time around, so I wont have to take three of hours of wedding party pictures.&nbsp; Since the ceremony is at 11am, I can guarantee you that I will be COMPLETELY plastered by 1pm.&nbsp; Its the only way I will survive, I think.&nbsp; That night, I will crash in a hotel, only to get up bright and early the next day to come back to the city.  &nbsp;  On Sunday, my wonderful gay uncles from California arrive in the city.&nbsp; I have plans to go shopping with them or out to a bar, maybe just walking around SoHo. &nbsp;In any case, that night, Paul and I will take them to dinner and out for yet more drinks.&nbsp; It will be a very fun time for all of us, if I can keep my eyes open during the experience.  &nbsp;  Monday, I work until 1pm and then head over to JFK airport to pick up my brother!&nbsp; He flies in around 3pm and will be greeted by both my parents and myself.&nbsp; We will surely make signs announcing his arrival and be screaming at the top of our lungs as he steps off the plane.&nbsp; Since we havent seen him in 16 months, the visit is SURE to be intensive with laughter and tears pouring out of our bodies at every possible moment.&nbsp; For two weeks I will be making the rounds with my brother; seeing friends and family that have missed him so much while he has been gone.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Although I will be out of work for a good week and , it wont be as much of a vacation as I need.&nbsp; Its not like Ill be sleeping in late and lounging around.&nbsp; There are numerous parties and dinners that I need to go to, etc.&nbsp; Im sure it will be more fun and laid back than Im predicting, but at this point, Im almost ready to throw my hands up in the air and say I cant do any of it.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  My nerves are shot.&nbsp; I feel emotionally unbalanced.&nbsp; Im completely and utterly overwhelmed.&nbsp; How does one person juggle all of these events without having a nervous breakdown?&nbsp; If I dont find a way to have some time to myself over the next two weeks, Im sure to collapse into a very deep depression.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I dont work the way most people do.&nbsp; I love to be busy, but I hate to lose control.&nbsp; With almost every event happening in the next few weeks, I have little to no control over any of it.&nbsp; That makes me nervous and uptight.&nbsp; I want to enjoy myself and I want to smile through the experience.&nbsp; However, in order to do that, I have to find a couple of hours here and there to either sleep, read a book, or stare at the wall.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;I guess thats it.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Keep me in your thoughts and prayers.&nbsp; Im going to need the support.&nbsp;

       Its FINALLY the weekizzle!   &nbsp;  I cant possibly explain to you how badly I need this weekend.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I have had something to do every weekend since June 5th.&nbsp; From birthdays to weddings to gay pride to family visits, I have not had a Saturday or Sunday to myself since before the summer started.&nbsp; I could just about collapse with exhaustion.&nbsp; Tonight I will go out with my friend Angie, after which I will crawl into my bed and not move until Monday morning at 7am when I will get up and come back to work.&nbsp; Its like a fantasy.&nbsp; Could I really sleep for two whole days if I want to?&nbsp; Why yes I can!  &nbsp;  Last night Angie came over.&nbsp; We had plans to go to dinner, but ended up getting trashed in my bedroom.&nbsp; Of course I had to play the new Guster cd for her over and over and over.&nbsp; At one point she said Joe, enoughs clearly enough.&nbsp; Put Guster away and come over here and fuck me.&nbsp; I obliged and she gave birth to the most beautiful baby girl this morning.&nbsp; I put a pink bow in the little hair she has and came to work elated.&nbsp; Im the proud owner of a tiny baby girl!&nbsp; Her name is Cherie.&nbsp; Just like Punky Brewsters black friend who got trapped in the refrigerator during that deadly game of Hide n go seek.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So there is this guy that takes the same bus route home that I do.&nbsp; I first laid eyes on him before I left to go to the wedding last weekend.&nbsp; He is about 6ft, thin, short blond hair styled sensibly but hotly, and deep blue eyes.&nbsp; He was wearing these professional looking glasses and a beautiful suit.&nbsp; Last week, he stared at me throughout the entire ride.&nbsp; I noticed that the bag he was carrying said Miller Thomson.&nbsp; I immediately went home and looked the name of the company up on the internet, but I wasnt able to find any information about him.&nbsp; Sadly, I turned my computer off and thought I had lost him forever.  &nbsp;  Yesterday, I was riding the bus home, as always, and I started to think about him again.&nbsp; What would I do if I saw him?&nbsp; Would I say hi or introduce myself?&nbsp; He didnt SEEM gay, but with the looks he was giving me, how he could not be?&nbsp; As I was mulling this all over, he steps on to the bus, walks to the back and sits next to me.&nbsp; My heart began beating out of my chest and my palms started to sweat.&nbsp; It must be a sign!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I casually looked in his direction and he did the same.&nbsp; Our knees bumped into each other and lingered longer than they would have had he been a straight guy.&nbsp; My right arm and his left arm grazed one another and I thought that I was going into a sexually charged panic attack.&nbsp; We both get off at the same stop, so when it was time, we got up and stood next to each other waiting to be released from the buss clutches.&nbsp; The door opened, we both stepped off, looked in each others eyes one more time and went our opposite ways.  &nbsp;  I exhaled a huge sigh and started to think about why I was so intrigued by this guy.&nbsp; I never go for skinny guysthey have to be muscled monsters.&nbsp; But in this case, I find his look to be so hot.&nbsp; Very professional and dignified and incredibly good looking.&nbsp; He walks like a man and he carries himself with pride. &nbsp;I gave him a part of my heart and he has yet to turn it into the overwhelming love that I know it could be for the both of us.  &nbsp;  Why is it so easy to fall in love with somebody on the bus or train?&nbsp; If its someone that makes that powerful of an impression, why do you spend the next couple of days thinking about them and wondering what could be?&nbsp; (sigh)&nbsp; I dont know.&nbsp; Its not like any of this is realistic, yet sometimes it consumes me.&nbsp; Eh, maybe Im just bored on my bus rides and thats why I need to create these mini-melodramas.&nbsp; Either way, I just love a distinguished gentleman in a suit.  &nbsp;  I guess thats it for today.&nbsp; Im excited to go home and play with my new baby.&nbsp; Ill make sure to give her a kiss from all of you.  &nbsp;  Have fun this weekend!&nbsp;

       I Just Love These Things Six   There are some things in my life that I adore beyond belief.  Here is a small sampling of these things.  These things Six.  Like Six from Blossom.  Or like 666 cuz of the debil.  Or like-Fuck you then.  1)	I adore Miss  urlLink Rita Rudner .  When I am up way too late or if its a Friday and Ive just gotten in from the bars, the first thing I do is turn on Ask Rita.  I find this woman to not only be hilarious, but she is everything that I would want to be as an adult female.  She is professional and classy and I love the way she talks.  She began her career as a dancer.  She had been in numerous Broadway productions before she married her husband and began writing and producing films.  Her talk show is wonderful.  If you find yourself awake at 2am sometime, tune in and check her out.  Shes fabuloso!  And she also reminds me of my friend Rita.  Now you get the WHOLE picture.  2)	It aint macaroni and cheese if its done with anything but Velveeta.  YUMSICLE!  I make THE best macaroni and chizzle.  Its creamy, thick goodness and it has less fat than cheddar cheese!  Have you read the box?  Velveeta tells no lies.  Cook up a pound of pasta, melt in a box of the Velve and you got yourself one extra special good dinner.  It sticks to your ribs with satisfaction!  I also eat a lot of tacos.  Tacos are good.  3)	Back in the day I used to love a band called Guster.  Over time, I forgot about them, much to my embarracksment.  This past weekend, Rita gave me the new Guster cd,  Keeping it Together , as a birthday present.  It is so super great.  I cant stop from playing it over and over and wellover.  So far songs #2 and #9 are my flava flave.  You will love.  And if you dont, then obviously you love pestilence.  You eat it and you love it.  4)	Im sorry, but  The Simple Life 2  is even funnier and more enjoyable than the first.  Paul and I have become addicts, which is nice since we dont usually share the same taste in television.  Anything that comes out of Paris and Nicoles mouths makes me die laughing.  Then, if they are bored, they dont give a fuck, and theyll ruin your life for jokes.  Did you happen to see last nights episode when they were trying to find the two boys some girlfriends?  Every girl bailed on these two guys and out of nowhere, Paris enters and sits a gay guy down at the table.  The two boys looked horrified and had no idea what to say.  I shit with laughter and then I beat my dick off furiously.  What?  I was pissed at my dick.    5)	Paul and I have started to download a shitload of musicload on his computerload.  Each song is 99cents and since Paul has a million 99cents, I can have whatever music I want!  I have been souping up his PC with so much good shit.  I found a Rufus Wainwright cover of Across the Universe that makes me so so happy.  Im about to create the most amazing mix cd.  And then, only then, will I have completed my life goal of burning a cd.  I have a cd burner that I got for a Christmas present, but I have yet to figure out how to use it.  Now Ill just use Pauls computer and let my burner sit quietly in the corner of my bedroom.  Its very pretty when it sits quietly.  6)	I love TV.  Here is my opinion on the most recent shows to debut. 	 	 The Amazing Race 3 ?  The Amazing LOVE!    	 The Ashlee Simpson Show ?  The ashlee I fucking hope you die Show.   	 	 The Next Action Star ?  Eh.  Not as good as I had hoped show.   	 	 Newlyweds ?  Ive had ENUFF!  All Simpsons should go away forevel and evel amen.  	Except for Homer, Marge, Bart, Maggie, and Lisa.  They are the only characters that give clout to the Simpson name.  And theyre cartoons! 	 	 The Ultimate Love Test ?  Oh  urlLink Diego .  OH Diego.  Im not kidding.  I fell in love with you the SECOND I laid eyes on you.  You are sweet and kind and that body!  The show is complete fucking garbage, but Ill stare at you until the day I kidnap you and make you my love slave.  HOT DAYIM!  hot fucking dayim. 	 	 For Love or Money ?  NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO!  Why do I keep watching you? 	 	 Road Rules: Extreme Challenge ?  Why is it that  Road Rules  has gotten SO much 	better than  The Real World ?  Answer: they do challenges which keep them very busy.  	You dont have to watch a half an hour of them getting drunk and fucking each other every week.  And they just booted the gay guy from the show.  GOOD!  I fucking hate homos.   	 	 Who Wants to Marry My Dad ?  Y A W N.  Im sorry, what was that again?  Oh yeah, old ugly bitches trying to win the love of a toolbox.  In all honesty, I feel as though zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. 	 	 Blown Out ? Jonathan Antin makes for GOOD television.  Tune in and see what goes on when he opens a new salon and hires a bunch of primadonnas to run shop.  Oh LORD its damn ridiculous.  But also guilty pleasure supreme! 	 	 Bands on the Run ?  I didnt even LIKE these bands when they were out 	(Kajagoogoowhat?), but watching them try to get together for once last concert is just about the most addicting show out there right now.  VH1, with this and  I Love the 90s , you own me.  MTV can SUCK it.  	 Reno 911 ?  Damn you for being the funniest show on television.  Holy shit you are 	hysterical.  Youre giving my  Simpsons  a run for their money.  Back off or Ill have to break your legs Lt. Dangle.  	 Last Comic Standing ?  Sit down you unfunny assholes.  I HATE unfunny assholes.  I LOVE hairless ones though.  PUKE!    	 JOJOs Get Out ?  Guilty pleasure #104.  I guess thats it for now.  Just had to get my opinion out there.  You understand.  You always understand.  You are thoughtful and kind and your cock is huge.  Stick it in my mouth and lets take care of business.  But if you squirt in my mouth and you dont warn meIm taking a bite out as a keepsake.  That will teach you not to dump in my mouth.  Great Thursday all!

       Snore Me a River   I am honestly in a coma.  Its so figures that at 3am, staying up until 4am didnt sound like such a bad idea.  All I have to do tomorrow is go to work and then go home and sleep!  Lets stay awake forever!  Stupid stupid stupid.  As soon as I woke up this morning, I thought I had accidentally died and woke up in hell.  My head pounded, my stomach churned, and I was NOT happy with the decisions I had made last night.  I had a wonderful dinner with my friend Hans.  I had the salmon, she had the lollipop wings.  I drank a bottle of wine myself, she had a gallon of water herself.  We played some games, caught up on old times, and then I hugged her goodbye.  Hans is moving out of NYC in two weeks, so this was our goodbye for awhile.  Not really sure when I will see her again.  But such is life  After dinner I went home and surprised Mariah at her apartment.  She is leaving today for the Cape and I wanted to be able to spend some quality time with her before the trip.  Spend quality time we did.  We talked and talked and talked until Paul walked in the door at 12:30am.  At that point, things got all sorts of crazy.  We played some loud music, jumped around like lunatics, and ate tons of grilled cheese.  At 2am, I started to get really tired and Paul begged me to stay awake a bit longer with him.    Pauls parents are coming to visit him this weekend.  This is the first time his parents have ever come to visit him that I know of.  Paul and I have been together for over 4 and  years and Ive only even met them once.  Both Pauls mom and dad have no idea that hes gay, so Ive had to move my stuff out of the apartment for the weekend.  Its a bit upsetting to me that he hasnt confronted this issue with them yet, but we can always hope he will this weekend!  And if not, in due time.  I may not see Paul again until Monday night, so he begged me to stay up as late as I could with him.  That turned into a 4am evening for me.  When I got to bed, I was so wired, I just laid there laughing and laughing until I felt the tears start to come.  Clearly I was WIPED out.  When the alarm went off this morning, my life shrivilved up and died.  I clawed the sleep out of my eyes and threw my pimply ass (hork!) in the shower.  I nearly fell down from lack of energy.  Tonight the cable people are coming to fix my cable box.  Fuckers came last Friday when Iwas away and pretended to fix it.  Now Ive had to make ANOTHER appointment for them to fix it for real.  Stupid bastids.  My mom asked me why we have so many problems with our cable while she and my dad have none.  I told her that NYC is just one huge hassle.  She laughed and then I farted.  It was a nice moment.  Im making the nicest dinner tonight.  Im having onion rings and salad and chicken.  It should be pretty good, especially since Ive got nothing else to do.  Maybe Ill play some cards online.  Ive been horribly addicted to Yahoo Games lately.  Im like a Heart playing machizzle.  If I lose, my hand clicks the play again button before my mind can stop it.  At some point I may need someone to stick my hands in a blender to teach them a lesson.   Fucking hands fucking fucker zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.  I gotta go.

       Wedding News and Moore   First offI have officially completed two of the three weddings I was committed to this summer.  Ive got one more in two weeks and then three of my closest friends will be married to their wonderful husbands!  The wedding this weekend was beautiful beyond belief.  It was very intensive as I met so many of the different family members and did it all on about 6 hours of sleep for the entire trip.  The ceremony and the reception were both amazing.  The whole thing was just absolutely perfect, save for the 3 hours of pictures we took after the nuptials.  That was a rough gocuz I wanted to get my drink on!    There was a  Real World  cast member in the wedding with me.  At first, I was floored by the presence of this pseudo-celeb, but by the time Sunday came, the mystique had been destroyed.  He was a nice enough guy, but nothing to write home home to mom about.  So I wont!  My friend Jessica made the most gorgeous bride.  She was gracious and fun and made sure to spend some private time with everyone who joined her on her special day.  At one point, the song More Than Words came on and Jessica pulled me on to the dance floor.  We danced and hugged all throughout our song and it was one of the most precious moments of the entire weekend.  I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  I actually flew to Syracuse this time.  Remind me to do that always.  SO much easier.    I did check in on  urlLink Ari's  site this morning and was surprised to find out that she has stirred up quite a bit of political controversy.  What are her comments at now?  75?  Awesome.  To be honest, nothing of what she has written in either the comment section or the actual post offends me.  And if it did, I find it hardly my place to jump on the bandwagon of angry commenting.  In my opinion,  urlLink Ari's  site is her site, and it should be kept that way. If you would like to enter into a debate with her, by all means.  Otherwise, keep the rude and hurtful comments away.  And theres no need to email me asking me for my opinion on it.  We obviously know who  Im  voting for this election.  And his name doesnt rhyme with tush.  Now, as for  Fahrenheit 9/11  which I was overjoyed to see last week  I have been a fan of Michael Moore since he first released  Roger and Me  years ago.  His movies can definitely be classified as propaganda.  But its GOOD and SMART propaganda and no one asked you to watch it anyway.  Now true, Moore definitely has control over the editing room when putting together this movie, but it wasnt like he falsified anything.  Bush HAS acted like an ignorant fool for the last 4 years and this movie showcased it.  When I saw the video footage of our President sitting in an elementary classroom staring at the floor after he had been told about the first plane crashing into the trade towers, I just shook my head and thought This is the leader WE chose.  The one I (personally) voted for.  It was disgusting and proved how little control this man actually has over his country.  I dont know what I would have done in his position, but then again, I didnt ask to be president.  I think that Moore chooses wonderful imagery to reflect his opinion.  And opinion is what this movie is.  If you didnt know that before, then you are just as ignorant as the star of the movie.  If you are someone who hasnt seen the movie, yet still feel as though you can talk in an educated fashion about it, well then, refer to my last comment.  The truth of the matter is, everyone is entitled to their own views of the last four years.  Moore has just offered his view in the form of a powerful (if not persuasive) essay titled  Fahrenheit 9/11 .    There is one thing we can all agree on and that is the way he chose to open the movie.  Picture thisno visual (a dark screen in a dark theater), just the sounds of the tragedy of September 11th.  I started crying at that moment and dont think I stopped until I walked out of the theatre 2 hours later.  The truth of the matter is, Bush is not to be blamed for what happened on September 11th.  He is a scapegoat just as Saddam was when he entered us into this horribly unnecessary war.  But we stand by our president until we have the chance to oust him.  Im not saying that Kerry is the ticket to success, but I do believe that Bush has had his turn.  Its time for him to step aside and let someone else have a go at it.  Whats the worst he could do?  Start another war?      Whatever happens in this years election, your ONLY responsibility is to vote.  I dont agree with Bush supporters, but I am just happy knowing that these people are out there exercising their democratic right.  If Bush ends up in the office again, the only thing that will disappoint me will be those people who sat at home watching  Maury Povich  on Election Day, rather than at the polls.    If you want change, vote for it.  If you want to debate it, go for it.  But understand that EVERYONE is allowed their opinions and they are MOORE than allowed to express themselves.    Lets keep it a clean fight, shall we?

       Winfield is coming HOME!   On April 20, 2003, my brother, Winfield, was deployed to Baghdad, Iraq.  With tears and frustration in my familys hearts, we said goodbye and resolved ourselves to a life of prayer and faith.  Even with my dads extensive military background, none of us were prepared for what the next year and a half would bring.  My brother was placed in charge of over a hundred men.  It was his job to order supplies, keep team morale alive and to patrol the streets of Iraq, in a sometimes failed effort to keep the peace.  He has had friends die, roommates die, and he has seen things that no one in my family will ever know about.  Because of his incredible work ethic and ability to see projects through to their bitter end, he was promoted twice while there and even netted himself a Bronze Star.    The phone calls home were infrequent.  Most often my parents would hear from Winfield on a weekly basis.  Since he was only allowed 40 minutes a week on the phone, he would spend 20 minutes with his girlfriend and try to alternate the other 20 minutes between my parents and myself.  Once in a while I would receive a letter or an email from him, but more often than not, we have relied heavily on CNN and prayer.  But now, after a 3 month long extension, he is finally in Kuwait out-processing.    My brother called me on my birthday to let me know that he was definitely coming home.  I was with Paul at the time, shopping in SoHo.  I immediately collapsed into the doorway of a nearby store and just cried and cried.  They were tears of joy, tears of exhaustion, and tears of frustration.  But could it be over?  Could he be finally coming home?    On Tuesday morning, my brother called me to let me know that his return home had been pushed off again.  With my parents on vacation, it was up to me to call them and let them know that this may not be happening anymore.  For the last two days, Ive walked around pretty angry and upset.  Its been 15 long months and he was told that hed be there longer??  But this morning, I talked to my parents and its confirmed.  Winfield will arrive in NYC on July 26th.  He will have two weeks here with us before he has to head back to Germany to fulfill his last obligatory year with the United States military.    Its hard to explain how Ive been feeling over the last year.  I think its suffice to say that Ive shed buckets of tears, worn away my insides with worry, and pretty much lost hope that Id ever see my brother alive again.  Weve missed birthdays and Christmas and Thanksgiving.  He hasnt seen a single show Ive done in NYC and I have yet to meet the girl he has been dating for the last two years.  There have been memories that Ive had to make without him and laughs that Ive had to share with him from thousands of miles away.    But now, I can finally relax.  My brother is coming home to be with his family.  He is safe.  He is healthy.  He is ready.  Ive never known anyone that has gone through such a difficult challenge and come out on top.  He has looked death in its ugly eyes and found the will and the strength to survive it.    Not only is my little brother my best friend, he is my hero.      Sure, we could sit here for hours and debate the worthiness of the Iraqi war.  We could discuss the actions of George Bush and we could argue the rights and wrongs of all of his decisions.  But at this point, I just dont care anymore.  Winfield CuttheShit is out of Iraq and coming home.  There isnt a need for me to analyze this shit anymore.  And there isnt a reason for me to continue being angry.  This last year of my life has been (by far) the worst.  With the grace of God, I have been able to keep my head up, despite all of the sadness and fear that has been coursing in my veins.  The tears that I shed now will be out of relief.    I will never stop supporting our troops and I will never forget those men and women that are still stuck in the hell hole that is Iraq.  My prayers will not stop.  They will only change to fit the circumstances.  If anything, Ive certainly learned the reality of being a loved one that is left behind during a time of war.  It hurts and its scary and I will never ever stop supporting our country and its troops.  No matter how difficult it may be.    Thank you to everyone who has stood by me over the last year.  Your constant prayers and emails and well wishes were exactly what I needed to get through this last year of my life.  If there was a way for me to show you how deeply grateful I am, I would.  But youll just have to take my word for it.  But I can say thank you again, so THANKS TO YOU!  Im off to a wedding this weekend.  I wont be back until Tuesday.  Until then, feel free to entertain yourselves.  Or re-read this post over and over so you can actually get a glimpse of how overwhelmed with happiness that I am.  My brother is coming home!

       Non-Stop Birthday!   What a weekend it was.  As you can tell from my lack of posting, I have just crawled out of my hangover today.  I cant begin to explain how little sleep I got this weekend.  Im still in Zombie mode, but at least the wine headache Ive been carrying around as my baby has finally died.  I buried it out back with the other babies Ive killed after the last couple of birthdays.  My birthday began on Thursday evening.  Paul and I decided to eat sushi and attend the 8pm showing of  Farenheit 9/11 .  The sushi was incredibly good and I was in the mood to try new things, so thats what I did.  If they had a mini-birthday cake made out of seaweed and rice, I would have gotten that too, but alas  After dinner, Paul and I walked to the local theatre.  On the way there, I heard someone scream You fucking faggots!  I looked at Paul and said They couldnt have been talking about us.  Were not even walking next to each other.  Paul glanced back and saw the guys who were now screaming louder You fucking faggots!  Get over here!  Two blocks later, I was very upset to see that the scumbags screaming at us had followed us down the street.  I stopped walking just in time to see scumbag number one get out of his child molestor van with a CANE.  He was in his forties, but hobbled his way over to where I was standing.  You motherfucking faggots.  I looked him right in the eye and said Do I know you?  No, so get the fuck away from us.  He became enraged and his friend (Scumbag #2) got out of the van and started approaching us as well.  I grabbed Paul by the arm and told him that we should get away as fast as possible.  As we walked to the movie theatre, I heard this loser scream Faggots over and over and over.   Under Pauls breath he muttered Crippled ass spics.  I told him to shut his mouth and walk faster.    Finally we arrived at the theatre.  Paul and I stood inside and tears filled my eyes.  Paul was so angry and I was just upset.  It never gets easier being called a faggot by a stranger.  The child molester van pulled up outside the theatre and parked.  We had to wait 15 minutes for them to leave.  After they took off, Paul and I walked home.  I was too upset to see the movie.      Eventually Paul got me out of my mood and we saw a different showing of the movie at a different theatre.  The movie itself was one of the most incredible pieces of artwork I have ever seen.  Ill cover that in a different entry.      On Friday, Paul took me to buy a new outfit.  He spent too much money and it shows.  The clothes are beautiful.  We had some drinks together and played some games before heading out to a nice dinner.  I had the swordfish and Paul had the steak.  After dinner, Paul and I had a few more drinks before heading over to  My Big Gay Italian Wedding , this new off-Broadway show.  I had wanted to see the show and was overjoyed when I found out that we had second row seats.  Long story short, the play sucked ASS and we left (along with just about everyone else in the theatre) at intermission.  What a grand old piece of stereotypical garbage the play was.  The only time I laughed is when the guy from  Boy Meets Boy , James Getzalf, tried to act his way out of the cardboard box they placed him in.  SUCK SUCK SUCK.  SUCK.  On Saturday, my friend Angie took me out to brunch and then played a scavenger hunt with me.  She had written up all of these clues and I got to run around the city like a crazy person.  It was so much fun.  At the end, she gave me my presents and we popped a bottle of champagne.  Afterwards, we met up with Mariah and Kelly and walked down to the local Lazer Tag place.  OH MAN LAZER TAG is so LAME and so FUN at the same time.  You arent allowed to run, so we walked hella super fast and shot every little kid we saw.  Of course I was yelled at for speed walking, but I didnt care.  It was my birthday and Ill speed walk if I want to.  After a few rounds of the tag, we all had some drinks and went out to dinner with Paul and a few friends.  The food was great, the drinks were great, the conversation rocked.  It was an amazing dinner.  After THAT, we went back to the apartment, played a few more games (I LOVE games) and went out to Splash bar in NYC.  I think we lasted 30 minutes there until I convinced everyone to go home with me to play a few rounds of ASSHOLE.  I TOLD YOU I LOVE GAMES!  I rolled into bed sometime around 3am.  On the Fourth of July, Kelly, Angie, Paul and I went over to our friend Megans place to grill and watch the fireworks.  I have never seen a more beautiful fireworks display in my life.  From where we sat, atop a rooftop in Brooklyn, I could see all three shows.  I held onto Paul as tight as I could and we watched explosion after explosion.  Being with my boyfriend for the whole weekend was by far the best part of my birthday.    When I got into bed on Sunday night, I collapsed into a coma.  All of the drinking and pot smoking and staying up late definitely took its toll.  Paul and I had a VERY low key Monday and then on Tuesday I went back to work.  PHEW!  I finally got all of it down.    I must thank everyone that made my day so super special.  I have the best friends and boyfriend a guy could ask for.  Now I have to wait 360 days until my next one!  Ah geez.    That is it for today.    Ill be back tomorrow with a funnier and more entertaining post.    For now, this is all you get.  Get it and love it.

       Haikus of Life   For todays post, I have decided to write about some mainstream societal issues that are plaguing our country.  In order to do this effectively, I decided to explain myself in Haiku format.  If you dont know what a haiku is, let me give you a quick tutorial.    The first line must consist of 5 syllables. The second line must consist of 7 syllables. The third line must consist of 5 syllables.    Thats it!  The last rule of haiku is to have fun.  So please enjoy and please follow the rules.  The first issue I will be discussing is that of teenage pregnancy:   Killing babies fast In time to go to the prom No blood on my dress   My next haiku will be on the subject of drug addiction.   Put it up your nose Inject it into your arm A life of bullshit   As we also know, Michael Jackson is in the midst of a mess involving pedophilia.  Its sad really, especially for someone who has accomplished so much in his life as a music superstar.  He will fight and fight to clear his name, but I thought I could share with you how I feel about his innocence.       You did it, did it. Did it did it did it did Did did did did it   With the presidential race looming in the background of our lives, I might as well express my feelings via Haiku.  Heres one about the current douche bag in office and heres one about the future douche bag in office.   George W. Bush Makes poor decisions all day Unemployment calls    John Kerry is nice John Kerry is really nice John Kerry John Kerry nice   Were you wondering what I thought about Paris Hilton and Nicole Ritchie?  Sure you were.  Here gizzles:   Why are you famous? Skinny, drug addled goof balls I miss the Ledings   Saddam Hussein is now on trial for all of the torture he has caused the Iraqi people over the last couple of decades.  It is only fair that I give him his just desserts.   You cleaned up real nice But your heart is black and cold Soon you will die, yay   To make sure that this post is fair and balanced, I should do a very honest and self-effacing haiku about myself.  Here it is, for your viewing pleasure.   Why are you so cute? Funny and Sexy and gay You used to be fat   Tomorrow is my birthday.  I will be 27 years old.  My friends have planned a weekend full of activities and my boyfriend (aside from yelling at me for no reason this morning) will be spending some quality alone time with me.  I hope this haiku describes my birthday to a T.     One year older now You are the boss of your day Hurt someones feelings   Isnt everyone a birthday tyrant?  I hope I can make everyone happy by running my birthday as a dictator.  Dictator Hussein.  Cept that I wont get the CHAIR for my tyranny.  Unless thats the surprise my friends are talking about.  They did tell me to leave out my hair gel and to wet my forehead with a damp cloth before meeting up with them.  Interesting  So finally, I leave you with one last Haikooze.  Ill be back next week with full stories about my weekend.  Until thenfuck you!  ErI mean, fuck me.  I meanah fuck you.   Long weekend starts now I will sleep and jerk my dick Birthday cum tastes sweet   Say Peace Out everybody!  PEACE OUT EVERYBODY!
