      another Saturday . . . another stupid academic thing to do  Hi . . . I'm me.  Andrew Cowan  Student (almost done) at Queen's University Kingston Ontario Canada  I have two citizenships - luckily in the same name.  I play in a band for fun. We're Unibrau - we rock in a garage, we really should stay in the garage kind of way. Luckily I have a lot of friends who book bands at Queen's and they let us play for beer. Yes guy!  I work at a Howard Johnson hotel for money and food, all the while putting up with the most incompetent bunch of owners I've ever met - pity me.  Say what you want, but Masters programs are just excuses to put your life on hold. Moving back home to Toronto after school to work in a hotel and "find a cool job": brillant! It all depends on who you ask though.   obligatory weblog  urlLink link

      Another day, another live viewing of bombs dropping on Iraq.  Incidentally, my computer started playing B.O.B. by Outkast 5 minutes into my military vouyerism . . .   weird  How is one supposed to act in a time of war? Especially when we have no control over it? I have no clue how I feel on it, on one hand I have no wish to see the States subjected to a nuclear or biological weapon's attack and on the other I have no wish to see innocent people lose their lives . . . . . arrrrrgh! Stupid grey areas!   As a politics student, I find the United States is acting the way it needs to act. Just stay with me here, I don't condone what they are  doing at all, but I understand. In realpolitik the USA is doing what it needs to do to maintain its favoured position in the global arena. If it were to act "nice" and not pursue what is in its interests then there would be anarchy in their home country. The citizens of the United States would reach for their guns (which they are entitled to do . . .  I'm not gonna get started on that one) if there was ever a substantial drop in the quality of life that they have been accustomed. Providing meaningful help to other nations that wouldn't doom them as economic vassals of America would reduce the United States quality of life and in a way, the American politicans would be failing their citizens by not providing them with the best possible life. They are elected to better Americans, not other nations.   The international framework is called an arena for a purpose. It implies competition. Humanity is winners and losers and if I think about it anymore I get depressed. I can't believe how lucky I am to live in Canada. It was co-incidence that I was born to the parents that I was and in the area that I was. I could of been an Albanian in Kosovo, I could have been born in a Nairobi gutter.  No wonder I identify with existentialism so much.  it breaks my heart to realise this. If anyone out there has a different opinion please please please tell me. Email me if you want to tell me how wrong I am - I need another opinion because this view just scares me and makes me more cynical.   blargh  ajc

      It's a lovely Thursday night . . . .  My band's gig at Clark hall scheduled for tommorrow night has gotten cancelled due to the fact that the venue decided to double book themselves with the freakin' United Way. I haven't been this mad at a charitable organization since the Make A Wish people decided that strep throat wasn't a life threatening enough to warrant me becoming UN Secretary General For A Day. Imagine how much fun it would be to recognize Kurdistan, declare Norway illegal and park wherever the hell I wanted to in New York City.   A boy can dream.  Last night I had a great dinner with my 4th year politics class at a local restaurant (the class is on Science, Technology and Politics) and espoused my theory on how broken the Canadian University system is when I can fritter away five years of education, do no damn work at all, and still end up with a degree and an average in the high 70's. Honestly, I have dared this university to fail me at every opportunity and  still they insist on judging my little efforts as "acceptable". I spent January in a druken stupor and February wasn't much better.   How the hell have I gotten away with this?   Seriously, I wrote an English paper last year on a borrowed lap top whilst imbibing at a campus pub and still managed to get an 80 on the paper. I though it was impossible to fail high school but this is ridiculous.  I really hope my mom doesn't read this . . . . wait, she and my dad weren't much better in their day. Yup, no parternity test needed here.  blargh  here's to you and yours  ajc  obligatory weblog link urlLink

      So, a presentation is due tommorrow, a twenty page paper on Friday, and I have a date tonight.  I like the date part of the entire equation, but I don't know how much sleep I am going to get in the next three weeks. I have to care about school now, I really do, but the only thing I want to do is curl up into a little guitar-playin'-350-in-overdraft-fun-havin' little ball and  forget everything that I've learned in the past few years.  Who needs education?   I would really like to know when I got to this point of resignation.  i have seen my perfect day. I have watched it fade away. You know I'm fighting to be real.  - I never thought a Matthew Sweet song would be so refreshing.   Arrrgh! Can't be that guy! I'm not going to delve into all that crap about figuring out my life and where it'll all end up because everyone does that at least 12 times a day.  it ends now.   Listen to my friend Stefan's  urlLink radio show  simply because no one plays folk music over the airwaves except the CBC and my mother listens to CBC. Not that I'm knocking Mom or anything, it's just that I would rather that my local radio station would toss on a Dick Gaughan or Battlefield Band track  everyone once in a while rather than repeat the same song five times an hour.  Highlight of my very brief time on this planet? Jumping on a table to play a guitar solo while a stuptified crowd watched why the hell my band and I were playing loud rock music in a campus pub normally acustomed  to acoustic guitars and djembes. It was Rock and Roll Muthafucka!  obligatory weblog  urlLink link

      www.ootp5.com  this game has taken over my life  It is the perfect way to procrastinate.  Speaking of procrastination, I was able to write a 15 page paper on "The Internet and its effects on Mass Media" in about four hours.   3500 words 4 hours  The only thing that school has taught me is how to work the system for maximum benefit. I spent one evening (6 hours in total) grabbing about 14 journal articles off the web and then reading them, and tghen cutting and pasting the relevant  information onto a blank Word document. That was all the research I needed.  The four hours of the actual paper writing process went like this: I first went through the fifteen pages of cut-and-paste web notes and put them into order on to another document so that they could form relevant paragraphs (footnoting all the time so that I'm not kicked out of school for plagirism). This took about an hour and garnered me about nine and a half pages of "written" work. Then I began writing my introduction which took 10 minutes and brought the page count to 10 and a half (I never make my intro less than a page in length - it's just uncivilized). Then it took me another three hours to write five pages of my own work, rewrite a bunch of the direct cut and  pasted material (while still citing it) and putting together up my bibliography. This was worth forty percent of my mark   What is the lesson here? University is a joke.  I don't go to class, I drink like a fish, I play video games, I play guitar in a band and haven't given a fuck about my education since I was accepted to this university in 1998. I have given this place every opportunity to fail me but they keep giving me marks in the 70s despite the effort that would make my mother weep if she knew  Case in point: Last year I had a 12 page English essay due on the Monday of Reading Week and I was leaving for Boca Raton ("Boca Baby! Boca!") on the Sunday. Damned if I was going to work on that thing. So on the Friday night I borrowed a friend's laptop and went to the Queen's Pub (a bar on campus) and proceeded to drink, flirt with a girl who would  become my girlfriend after Reading week, and write my essay. All in that order.  I handed in the worst example of writing since Mein Kampf  Final grade: 82%  Thank you gifted high school education for teaching me how to  write what professors want to read. Such exceptional skills they have imparted upon me.  blargh  ajc

      It's a world gone mad!!!  (To be filed under stupid celebrity stuff) Matchbox 20 has cancelled their European tour due to the war in Iraq.  shock     horror  It's a good thing too . . . I hear Rob Thomas is right up there on the anti-American hit list.  Rob Rob Rob, if you deprive Europe of your crappy music then the terrorists win!  I'm just scared that the enemies of America seem to be targeting the celebrities that I want dead.  Does that mean if I'm not with Matchbox 20 am I with the terrorists?  (Celine Dion cancelled her Hollywood Walk of Fame Star ceremony due to the war)  Although there are probably deeper motivations to this Matchbox 20 cancellation for the simple fact  that America is trying to bring Europe on side with the Coalition Forces. Thus it would make no sense to assault the Europeans with the music "stylings" of the 'box and whichever crap band they'd bring on tour with them.  In all seriousness though, who the hell do Matchbox 20 think they are? What terrorist or foreign power would possibly target them? Would it be a huge moral victory for the Iraqi leadership to silence Rob Thomas forever? It takes a certain amount of pompousity and ego to think that this crap band would ever be subject to attack.  Except . . well . . .  from the critics. But the're on our side!!!!! Yes guy!!!!   blargh  ajc

      o.k., to begin I'm going to try to write this entry so that it won't do the weird wrapping thing that all my entries seem to have. I don't know html. I will learn it this summer so's that I can jazz up this little piece of me- available-to-all-online.   Anyway, right now I'm at work on a Sunday night and there are 15 people in the hotel. I am number 16.   I have been working here at the Kingston Howard Johnson's since last May and I have hated the in-house music system since the first day I started work. It's horrible.  It is actually a Muzak system.  I had never seen one until that moment.   It got to a point where I went out and bought one of those uber mp3 players (of the 10 gig variety) so that I could  hook this little piece of electronic bliss into the music system and pass the hours without wanting to hunt down Dan  Fogelberg and ruin him like he ruined me (in abstentia) this summer.  Well, they've changed the system now and there is a new channel called "Adult Alternative" that plays stuff like Rhett Miller, Ryan Adams, Whiskeytown, Elliott Smith and other such artists.   It makes me feel old and out of touch.  I pride myself on being "in the know"  I have gone to Do Make Say Think and Broken Social Scene concerts. I own the new Interpol and Tahiti 80 albums. I read Exclaim religiously.  - wait, now I'm sounding like one of those people who say phrases like "some of my best friends are (minority of choice)" -    I now really enjoy Muzak's Adult Alternative station. (it's my music at work! how goddamned cheesey!) I am 24. I am Adult Alternative - a Beth Orton song just came on in the lobby -   blargh  ajc

      several things. . . . .   one:  I am done. I only have a few more things to do before I trundle down an aisle in Queen's Jock Harty arena and grab my piece of paper that says I learn stuff  good. My last class of all time was today. I did not attend, besides, I haven't gone to it since the beginning of January so I figured why start now?  Besides, I went out drinking last night and damned if I was getting up for a ten o'clock class.  hotel work countdown: 9 days 'till sweet succulent freedom  To celebrate ending the school year and school career, my housemate and I are having a huge kegger at our apartment. It's going to be so much fun. I'm getting my band together and we're going to do an acoustic set at the  beginning. In a related story, my friend Grant wants Unibrau to play his house party at the end of April. He and his housemates are moving out but have the place until May 1st, so, they are going to have a huge bash in an empty place. We just need to set up our equipment in the living room and rock out until we can rock no more.    two: the Super Friendz have reformed! This is some of the most exciting news that I have come across in a long time. They were a staple band for me in my high school days and continue to bring me great joy as I advance the years. Their first album "Mock Up, Scale Down" is very choice. If you have the means I highly recommend getting yourself a copy wherever you can find one.   three: Everything I seem to touch these past few weeks either turns to Shit or Shitestra(the low-cal, low-fat Shit substitute for a non-sodium diet). I don't know how the cosmic forces have aligned against me but I just hope that  the whim of Providence turns its gaze elsewhere soon. Or I just have to  stop making stupid stupid decisions while out in public.  four: My band played Clark Hall Pub (opening up for a great band called "Horse and Mule" - it was their last show ever and the are far too  talented to let us open for them) on Wednesday night and it was a great show. Sadly there was no table to mount for a Triumphant Guitar Solo of Immense Rock Power (a la the Queen's Pub shows) but I made do by wearing a gaudy hawaiian shirt and a gaudier (sp?) sombrero. You don't mess with a sombrero. That's a rule in my book.  Anyhow, we played loud (and partially good) and there came a point  where I cut my hand on the strings during the third last song. I didn't realise this until the end of the song when I looked down and  saw that there was a lot of blood on my guitar.  Normally this would startle me, but I was so full of adrenaline that  it just fueled the rest of my performance. The free beer they provided to us helped to steady the nerves. Now my guitar has a few extra splashes of red on its pick guard and I have no real intention of cleaning it off for  the time being. I think it looks kinda cool.  It's not often that you can leave a little piece of yourself in a campus pub.  As for the free beer, by the end of the night we had completely taken advantage of the Clark Hall staff's generosity.  The final total of pitchers consumed by Unibrau: 8 Number of members in Unibrau: 4 It was a good time.  The ending of the night was crap, but that can be filed under item three (as seen above)   I just need to bunker down and let the crap times pass.    five: why is it snowing? why why why why why why why?   blargh  ajc

        It's another Sunday night in Kingston . . .  this means that I am at work and unlike previous Sunday night's spent here  at the friendly Howard Johnson I am finding it less soul-sucking than normal.  That's because I gave my two weeks notice tonight!!!  Yay!!! I am finally leaving the job the employers that forced me to work over the Christmas holiday and never paid me overtime despite working six out of  every seven days in the month of August.  The owners are a bunch of mentally challenged children and inspire the type of loyalty rarely seen outside Latin American juntas (wow, a politics joke . . . and not a funny one at that)  well . . . I am at 13 days and counting until I can be free of this place.  blargh  ajc

        Howdy y'all  There's a common myth that I have often heard, but have been hesitant to subscribe to and it goes like this: "If you're in a band you have better chance to attract he opposite sex" or, to be blunt "Guys in bands get girls!"  I am happy to report that this notion has ceased to be classified as a Myth and is now permanently encased in the realm of Fact. Happily so.  Let's just say that I'm going to be playing in a band - ANY band that'll have me - for quite a long time  blargh  ajc

        I now know my exam schedule  I am one step closer to being the perfect student  I have a million more to go  I am going to be the worst parent when it comes to education sample conversation down the line: ("Why try son/daughter name? Have as much fun as you can before you get old. Besides, it doesn't really matter how you do in schoolif you don't fail out. Get your average in the 70s and coast the rest of the way. Want another hit on the bong?")  My first exam is on the 19th  My last exam is on the 26th  I don't even have to hurry this stuff. I am going to be so lazy now! Hell, I be even lazier than Lazy McApathy - the Laziest Man in All  of Scotland! Second only to Lord Dontgivenoshit of Indolence Lake upon Tyne! YES! I am among royalty!  In realted news the weather channel is reporting that there has been a change in the percentage chance of degree attainment for one Andrew Cowan They are predicting a 85% chance of increased belly button contemplation and this has lead to a new prognostication of a 49.3% chance at actual degree attainment. Though his caring factor is remaining strong at 21.2%   Wow. I really beat this school thing to death.  What the hell am I thinking?  blargh  ajc

        once again I post on a Sunday night . . . . hard at work at the hotel. I have an essay that was due last Monday. I'll hand it in sometime. The problem is that I keep getting the urge to go out and enjoy myself and the  precious few days that I have left and this is balanced by a litimtless apathy towards anything scholastical in nature.  I don't even know when my exams are yet . . . .    So I decided to go to the Queen's Formal last night about 14 hours before the doors opened as my friend Em was a wizard in her ability to scrounge me a ticket. (I overexagerate . . . she lives with one of the organizers). I had a great time! My date was fun, her friends were cool, and saw a ton of people that I wanted to. The only akward moment came when I ran in to a girl that I stopped dating (mutually) on Thursday night and it was obvious to her that I was at the Formal as someone's Date. But then my date and I were handed a fistful of drink tickets by the outgoing manager of Clark Hall pub and the momentary cloud over the evening passed with nary a wistful sigh.  I am so braindead now due to i) the time change ii) the fact I've been out for the past week iii) I have twenty odd days left and care only about what house parties my band is going to play at (this week Bob and i are  hosting a kegger in our tiny leeeeeeeettle apartment and Baird - my lead singer - and I are going to do an acoustic set of Unibrau tunes as well as assorted Jayhawks, Weakerthans and Ryan Adams covers - I'm also  going to do a few Death Cab for Cutie songs) iv) I am utterly sick of school and could not care less.  There's a whole lot more going on, but I am just too tired to write it all down. I feel as if I'm failing my loyal reader (hi howie's! You're brothers so i guess I can refer to you both as a psude-single entity)  I have been living these past few days in a slow motion haze trying to cram all the good experiences into my cranium so that I won't forget them in five years or twenty minutes.  My hair growing experiment is coming along nicely . . . . I surmise that in about a week I will officially have a Rock Star Shag - haircut not experience.    It was sunny today when I walked home this morning and was almost killed by falling ice. Sun good. Ice bad.  I've tried to be a Ben Harper fan. I really really have. oh well.  Crap. I have to get myself a permanent email address now that I can no longer rely on 8ajc1@qlink.queensu.ca. I'm so attached to this wonderful little piece of electronic identity that it kind of scares me how sad it will be to give it up, Does anyone have suggestions as to what email i should use?

      Well, I went out last night to the local dance bar . . .  started out at the QP with friends, went to Stages to meet the girl I'm seeing until April 27th  (This is the second time that I've had specific End Dates)  Got there, everything's cool. I was in the midst of a great time and then I saw You,  the girl that I hadn't seen in four years.  The First One from High School . . . . with all of Your friends from high school.  Hell, I hadn't seen any of them in five years.  What were you doing there? I thought you had up and left years ago.  Seeing You there brought me face to face with the 18 year old me, and a sudden, 10 minute half-drunk, time warp conversation with the 18 year old me. Would he like who I am now? Hell, I didn't like me at 18, who does really? I do now, it took a while but I do like who I am and who I think that I am becoming. We're all still becoming something until we die anyway, it's just a matter of if we like the path we take.  You still look really good after half a decade. I do admit there was a tinge of regret. It was the wrong time to see You but I guess that you'll be pleased to know that you caused  this type of thinking.  I don't think you saw me, nor did I want you to - I wanted to avoid a weird scene at all costs. Nor did I want to explain the whole thing to the girl I was with. So I kinda stepped back from life for a half-hour, just digesting past/present/future crap. But then belly-button gazing got old and I went back to having fun with who I am now and left the whiny 18 year old back in the past - I hate it when your own mind tries to spoil a good time.  You didn't leave with anyone (yeah - I checked, I'm a dumb male)  I left with her; does that mean I win? Is there a winning and why do I care about it? It is playoff time - that's a good excuse as any I guess.   We all want to win with the people we've loved, especially those that showed you aspects of love for the first time when you're young, scared and someone says to you "I like who you are, you are attractive to me" for the first time in your life. Then the two of you fumble through the emotional crap for the first time in your lives and then the selfishness takes over, and you get out before you get hurt and hurt them in the process. But we all hope that it's for the best, and I guess it is for the most part. Winding down the long road to happy.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Unibrau plays this Tuesday at the QP It's the "Surprise! We Thought We Had Our Last Show But What The Hell, The QP Wants Us To Play Once More And I Can Play Another Guitar Solo On A Table For The Last Time" If you haven't seen us, come out, I promise a good time and I'll sneak you some of the free beer that they'll be sneaking to me. We want to play every song that we know and some that we don't.  I guarantee Entertainment.    Back to Study Mode   blargh   ajc

        My last Sunday night at the hotel. My last night at the hotel.  The housekeeping ladies threw me a small party with a cake. I had no idea I was so loved . . . as a group they hate the hotel management and I habve never really bothered to hide my contempt for the owners of this place, and as such, they have always appreciated my barbs towards the higher ups.  mad props were thrown all 'round . . . in an almost haphazard, willy-nilly fashion  now there is less than two hours left in my sentence and I can go back to  enjoying my Sunday nights . . . . I have an entire season of Simpsons to catch up on now.    Then, Graduation.  I'm not too sad, but it will hit me when I'm in Toronto and lonely - not so much for the individual people that I'm leaving behind here at Queen's, but for the lifestyle that I have experienced as a 19 to 24 year old.   For instance: last Tuesday, Bob (my housemate) and I threw a kegger. Bob  bought a keg of Keith's and refused to charge admission for it. Free Beer. (Bob works three jobs, two of which are merely titles right now, but he gets paid quite well - it's a long story involving our third housemate who moved out in December and far too boring for this piece of the Internet) Anyway, the beer was just Bob's way of having a good time.  And a good time was had!!!!  We had a ton of people over and drank about a third of the keg (we had a  further get together Friday night for hockey and partially-flat Keith's) and anyone there could not have cared less about the next day. I played an acoustic set of music with my lead singer in the living room and was in heaven for an evening.  It's evenings of the like that I will miss when I'm stuck at home in my parent's house in June. The Complete and Utter Lack of Responsibility. Friends who live - at maximum - ten minutes away and we only need a designated driver if we're going to steal shopping carts from the A&P across the street.  Strangers that become formal dates that become 'sleepover friends' all in the span of an evening.  Walkinbg up to a friend's door unannounced and knowing that a) the door will be unlocked b) you're always welcome c) it's 3 a.m. on a Tuesday and  all their lights are on.   I can't really describe what it has been like going to school here at Queen's, but it really is it's own self-contained community. It gets knocked for that reason yet I have loved just about every moment (well, barring a month here and there) that I've been able to spend at it. It really is a world unto itself and I've been lucky enough to take advantage of so many opportunities that it has thrown my way.  I'm happy I'm here. I'm happy to have been here. I'm going to miss the atmosphere. Just about anything could happen on any given day.  blargh  ajc

      the past few nights I've had a weird recurring dream where I'm not only a CSIS agent, but a very bad one at that. Whenever I try to be a "secret-agenty" I just use a bad Scottish accent - kind of like Sean Connery playing a Russian sub commander - you could hear the fijords of Riga just sing from his voice. Weirder still is that it only really happens when I sleep over at Patti's, and I'm wondering what kind of archetype it  represents . . . . paging Dr. Jung . . . . .

       The best laid plans are often torn asunder by both the weather and that's never better  my housemate feels older and is depressed. This is the first time I've seen him like this and I have no idea what to say to him to make him feel any better. So we've been playing the new Bond PS2 game and I think he feels better but, the whole thing is a mystery to me.    My many many many heartfelt apologies to those who made the trek to see Trumphant Rock Power. Unibrau's Grand Scheme to Rock the QP like a Tropical Depression came to an untimely demise die to a combination of (i) an uber-moody lead singer that - quite honestly - was a downer on the whole band thing. I think that he's lost a lot of  enthusiasm that he once had and the novelty is starting to wear off for him. He wanted to call off the show, but this leads to: (ii) The Queen's Pub a.k.a The Venue in Which We Were to Perform lost its liqour license until the 30th of April - its a  long story that involves stupid people doing stupid things - but what doesn't these days. Now there's a rumour going around that Alfie's is facing the same thing . . . . . .   but it is a beautiful day out there . . . . .   So, my apologies go out to all those (two) who made the trek to K-town . . . . but having a beer with Karen and Howie was amazing. I just wish that there could have been loud rock music mixed into the process.  Toronto bound in three days I get to put letters after my name in two.  blargh  ajc

      To all those friends from mine from high school that are  considering coming to Kingston this week (say, specifically Karen Lee and How-Sen Chong) your presence is both requested and required this TUESDAY night (April 22) as there will be muchos Rock and Roll played in honour of your visit to Kingston. Come out to the Queen's Pub and you'll see a shaggy haired former classmate of yours turn Rock Mode into the Full On position. Then we will drink and forget that we're old and graduating . . . . Howie - bring Sean Court if you can  . . . . if not, then it's his loss.  Booyah!   blargh  ajc

      Well, I went to the last party of my scholastic life on Tuesday night. Then I woke up and cleaned out the rest of my apartment with  Bob and finalised all my packing requirements. I'm now sitting in my parent's basement after catching the 9:15 bus back from K-town.  I walked around the deserted student area one last time about an hour before dusk and became overwhelmed by the entire flood of memories that one smal 10 block by 10 block neighbourhood can contain and felt regret over some of my more recent actions.  I need some serious karma re-adjustment - - - does anyone want to join the Peace Corps with me?  When I wake up this morning I'll begin looking for a job.  Crap.  Then I have to cut my hair.  Crap Crap Crap  Then I have to wait in the hopes that someone accepts my apology  Shit  being an adult means accepting responsibility for your own stupidity  blargh  ajc

        Oh look, you've earned your wings. Are you an angel now? Or a vulture, constantly hovering over waiting for the big mistake?        - The last thing I was thinking as I walked away from my last exam ever  I have letters behind my name and five years of memories to go with them.  The only real regrets I have are moot. In hindsight I would only change things to make a fun time even more fun. My parents came and helped me move out of the apartment yesterday after I said goodbye to Patti for what may be the last time. I miss the lifestyle already.  I woke up today alone in my own bed and immediately began to try to make my Home into  my home. I put a whole bunch of my cds into my parent's stereo and filled the house with comfortable music, but it doesn't really mask the fact that none of my friends live within walking distance, I'm flat broke, and I can't enjoy the life I once had.        aaarrrrrrrrrrrrrgh! I am not going to be sad! I promised myself that I was going to be sad in May.  I'm heading back to Kingston tommorrow to do the final cleanup of the apartment with Bob (we've dubbed it Arageddon Tuesday - it'll be Ragnarock and Roll) If you've ever been in our apartment you could of immediately discerned our level of apathy about either our scholastic pursuits or  our utter lack of respect for our physical bodies . . . mmmmmm take out for two months! After this day long epic, I will be off to the last party that I will ever attend as a student. It's  at a freind's place where they've already moved out, so we're all a gonna party down in an empty house. wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!  Wednesday I'll walk the ghetto one last time and remember far too many good times and  good people, do some final errands, say some goodbyes and see-ya-laters, then leave before my glasses attain a permanent rose-coloured tint.  I hate to quote song lyrics generally (long story there) but I've been singin' this song to myself since Saturday. It's called "Don't Be Sad" by Whiskeytown . . . . GO GET IT RIGHT NOW it's a brillant song.   seen a lot of things that we didn't wanna see  but i'm glad we did  i know a lot of times we fell out of line,  but we fell back in  i think we lost the keys to the kingdom,  before we'd seen them   don't be sad    took a lot time for us to find the words we mean  spent a lot time for our dime runnin nickle beat  i think we lost the keys to the kingdom,  before we'd seen them  don't be sad   cos we dont hafta live this way forever  it's hard to compromise the things we have   don't be sad  don't be sad  talk to one to have faith  money can not erase  be sad     blargh  ajc

        there is both bad and good to being home. On the good side, I get free food and lodging with hardly any bills to speak of.  On the bad side I had to borrow some cash from my mom to go out for a drink last night. That was slightly uncomfortable.  Yet, the evening was amazing. I went to the Tranzac club off Bloor Street to see some free  bluegrass music with my friend Stefan. It was a phenomenal time catching up and watching some very talented musicians play music that you don't get to hear too often, well, anywhere. We told our stories of recent times and walked the streets.  Good people are good.  Beer prices in Toronto are stupid.  I miss the My Bar nine dollar pitchers in K-town   I've been in a kind of shutdown mode for the past week and a bit, but this can be considered somewhat normal seeing as I don't have much contact with the outside world other than the odd outdoor occasion - that and my daily bike rides that make me feel good inside, but my ass hurts on the outside.  I'm still looking for a job, but I surmise the process will take a while.  blargh  ajc

        Hello,  my name is Andrew and I live at home with my parents . . . .   I have an entire country that begs me to go out and explore with the conscience of Youth as its accomplice. There are a million places I could go. The only thing I'm hampered by is a bank account that reads 500 to the negative.  Everything is back to normal after my small wee fuck up. If you're interested I'll tell you the story the next time I see you. We'll share a beer and you can learn from my mistakes. I always find it more rewarding to learn from the mistakes of  others, friends or no . . . . it's that selfishness thing.  I try and go out but I've got no money to do so, thus, self-improvement is the song that I'm singing, to the tune of an hour long bike ride each day. I need to undo the damage that a few years of indolence and apathy have subjected my body to. It wasn't bad when I was on the Queen's Varsity Fencing Team, but I stopped that two years ago and have noticed a bugle where there once was no such thing. Considering that it's been a few years since I went through what medical science refers to as "becoming a man", the appearance of this bulge is not greeted with a general feeling of joy nor a bar mitzvah - just a desire to  hop on the bicycle. Besides, I'm not jewish.  Anyone want to employ me? I'm a good guy who won't steal too much from the workplace.    Scripted and sold, but I won't be decorated  blargh  ajc

       In another life I want to come back as an English soccer commentator.  They have a way of turning the sporting language into something else, and in just brief snippets they can make you a part of the action and make you care as much as they do.  All soccer commentators must be English from now on. Americans should never be allowed near a microphone when it comes to the game.  and for the record, yes, Bob Costas must be eliminated . . . I don't care when and I  don't care how. It must be done.   blargh  ajc

          It was a day full of soccer. My dad got free tickets to the Toronto Lynx game at Centennial Stadium. (the Lynx are a team in the A-League - one step down from the MLS. Don't know what MLS is? It's the highest level professional soccer in Canada - the Lynx are one step below it)   on a side note, the're also owned by the Hartell's, and their son attended high school with me.  Anyway, my dad and I are kinda making a thing about going to Lynx games. We went to their home opener on Sunday against the Montreal Impact. In a Brush-With-D-List-Canadian-Celebrity Moment, we stood in line for tickets behind Holger Osieck.   What is more scary? a) I know who Holger Osieck is b) I can recognize him by sight (I pointed him out to my father) c) I can spell his name correctly d) They made him pay for his ticket   Just for the record, Holger Osieck is the head coach of the Canadian National Men's Soccer team. Yay! The game itself was o.k. - the Lynx sucked ass and so did the soccer pitch. The ball kept bouncing despite the players best efforts.  Anyway, my dad got free tickets for today's game . . it had a noon kickoff - which was good. it had a noon kickoff because it was School Day (hundreds of kids) - which is bad The sun was out - which was good The Lynx sucked again - which was bad  Yet, I was able to get out of the house for a couple of hours in the sunshine. The job search continues.  My dad and I arrived home in time to catch the opening kickoff for the Champions League Semi-Final: Juventus versus Real Madrid. Dad was in absolute heaven.    The Daily Show made me laugh. Stupid Texas lawmakers. Another shining example of why I will never, ever go into politics   blargh  ajc

        I went out for dinner with my family last night in honour of my sister's birthday.  On the menu: "It may be a wait. Our food is prepared order"  Prepared order? Is it fascist food that will yell at me if I put my elbows on the table? Will it attempt to take over the rest of the table under the pretense that it wants to remedy  the table's innefficencies? Will it try to cut my 'dammned-hippy" long hair?  hee hee 'prepared order' hee hee    I am listening to "There There" by Radiohead.  It is such a good song

       Sunday night . . .update time . . .wheeeee!  So it's time to start adjusting to Everything Else and I've been thinking about the friends that I've made at university and how weird it'll be to see them again, even though there are many that I really don't want to.  I'm already starting off on a confusing note.  These past two weeks I've been able to meet up, talk to, and generally interact with a whole lotta friends. Some situations were weird and maybe slightly uncomfortable and some were just downright cool. It's odd to think that for the past five years I've met, interacted and lived with so many different people, but when it comes down to it, there's many that I don't want to see, or they don't want to see me. In some instances, there are people that I thought were really good friends of mine but in hindsight I really won't see much of them as we continue on out lives. Even one or two people that I've shared an apartment with. But that is a two-way street.   I had one friend tell me that whenever she comes across me I have changed my hairstyle, which is something I never thought of (even though I've only had three distinct hair styles - at least from my own choices). To be fair, I've seen her very rarely due to her globe-hopping and my fourth year involvement with AMS, but still . . . .  Now, I'm just talking about people that I've met at university, not those that I've known basically forever and wouldn't get out of my life even if they paid me. Life just happens. I guess I'm just kind of angry that it does, especially when my apathy, or the indifference of others causes me to lose touch with some cool people. But we've all done that.   It's been good seeing friends, but it's been weird seeing them outside of the set environment that I had a control and a handle on.   I promise I'll stop posting about this . . just give me 'till the end of May to get a grip on this whole situation.   I wrote two new songs today . . . do I have words? Hell no. Can I ever think of them? God no. I need people to play with, this is stupid. Plus, how am I ever going to get back on stage as a one-man band. I love playing Billy Bragg tunes but I can't be a one man act as I need someone to do the singing. It's too hard to do both things at once, plus I wouldn't be able to hop around like a freak . . . .  when I'm on stage I need the Rock Star Moves. It's like oxygen. But with a jump at the end of the chorus.   Last thought of the day . . .being poor sucks.   blargh  ajc

        Please excuse language however:  I GOT A FUCKING 'A' IN ONE OF MY CLASSES LAST TERM!!!!! I HAVEN'T GOTTEN AN 'A' SINCE THIRD YEAR!!!!  FUCKING RIGHT!!!!!!   Now, the explanation:  the Queen's Political Studies department does not give out anything higher than an 85. Very rarely doe they give marks that high and that is what we are told when we enter the program. No sweat, you just get used to seeing a whole lotta 70's on your transcript and move on with your life. So, I just checked my marks online just to make sure I hadn't failed any of my courses (As of a week ago I  still had an overdue assignment that I emailed to a prof a week today). Also, upon reading my archives you will notice that I really did not put a whole lot of effort into my last semester of school. In other words: I was at school from January to May? Hunh? I didn't attend a class in February . . . I called it my extended reading week. So, my marks from last semester ranged from 58 to 81 - quite a distance to go.  But its a lot better than I expected!  YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!

        I've been doing a little research on my more than likely potential new home known far and wide as Colebrook, New Hampshire. Now, I'm looking for a smallish city in which to live - something like Kingston, ON from which I recently exited -  you know, nice and quite in the Northwest USA, around 100,000 people.   so the web-surfing begins:  population, that's always a good indicator . . . . well  urlLink it  says here that it has 2,623 people hmmmmm, that seems pretty small. Apparently it is also one of the few populated areas in New Hampshire that is  losing  population  - this according to the recent US Census -  On the plus side, it is right on the border of Quebec and New Hampshire, and Montreal is about two hours away! Cool! I can go visit all my friends in Montreal!   Wait,  urlLink Howie , you're moving away from Montreal . . .  that's o.k., but now my list of friends in that city is suddenly halved . . . .   So basically I'm going to be moving to a really really small town that people are trying to get our of.  On the plus side, I'll probably be working so hard at  urlLink Eckerd  that I'll be content to sleep in on my days off and read a book . . . .  besides, I am going to save soooo much money from this gig. My meals are paid for 5 days a week and the room that I rent for my days off only costs 40 dollars a month. After all of this is said and done, I stand to be in a good position money-wise for a while if I do this for two years or so. Also, I don't have to upgrade my wardrobe (from its current status of Thriftstore Student to the abomidable state of Corporate Adult), all I have to do is just buy some  new boots and some winter gear and I'm set. As for cash, It's my goal to save one hundred dollars a month  for retirement. Besides finally accepting that I have to start being responsible  I can then justify saving two hundred a month so I can take a four month tour of Europe after two years of Eckerd with cash to spare (to use a weird metaphor, I'm like Frosted Mini Wheats: one side gets the 401K savings, the other gets to carouse in Europe).   If you couldn't tell, I've put a whole lotta thought in to this thing. Gotta have a plan, gotta have a plan.   blargh  ajc

       so I'm not off to Alabama  It looks more and more like New Hampshire  I'm heading down to Colebrook NH on June 26th for my final interview thingee. Their theory is that I spend 48 hours at the camp and I get a taste of what goes on and they get a taste of me.  - Hopefully not literally - I have no wish to work in a canabalistic atmosphere, that's why I'm staying out of the corporate world.  As you can see by the poor attempt at humour that I am  bored out of my mind here in Etobicoke.   So, it looks like I'm relocating to New Hampshire in a month  cool   blargh  ajc

        o.k., I'm going to endorse drinking and driving  a bicycle.  I was coming home from my friend Mike McNnair's "I'm going to Australia for grad School for two years so come for free food and beer" party and I was thinking to myself how cool it is to ride a bike while off-your-ass-drunk. The colours of my neighbourhood are pretty and serene. They make me think of neon and everything that I like about youth.  It's an experience let me tell you that.  Anyway, I had a pretty good time tonight. I was disappointed that the girl I was going to hit on was the designated driver for a bunch of her friends (a bad thing for me, probably a good thing for her).  Ever watch a train wreck in slow motion? That's what happens when you're drinking and you try to hit on someone who's sober. I learned this lesson year's ago so, as such, I did not make the same mistake tonight.  Scott Courtice, Mike was disappointed that you didn't make it out on his last night in Canada. Just something he wanted to pass along.   I can't wait to go somewhere new . . .  I can't wait to meet my future.  I'm still somewhat intoxicated so I can write that without shame.  I found out that someone i went to school with for 10 years was a hemaphrodite . . . . .  that's cool but I hope I didn't embarass him when I saw him. (formerly a her, but if my sister can turn out to be a stripper than I guess anything's possible).   I went to the Concert For Toronto. I hate Hip fans. They booed Sarah McLachlan (sp?). She came out for an encore and they booed her even though she had freely given her time and energy to the cause of the concert. I love the band. I hate their Fans. I really do. They have no respect whatsoever.  If you booed you missed the point of the entire event and I feel sorry for you. As Gord Downie said "This is for assholes who throw shit at musicians."  Amen Gord, amen.   and I step down from the soapbox.  I know I belong. I'm sick and I'm wrong. What does that make you?    blargh  ajc

      I'm sorry for the infrequency of my posts. The main reason has been that I just haven't had a lot to say about anything much at all. That being said, I have arranged my exit away from my childhood home and a relocation to the pristine wilderness of Colebrook New Hampshire. I like the fact that I accepted a job in the United States on Canada Day.   Last thursday I woke up at 4 am to board a 6:30 flight to Manchester NH via 3-hour layover in Detroit. An uneventful journey landed me in the middle of an airport that felt like Winnipeg's (small, compact and sweltering) with a vague sense of apprehension.  Random thought to myself: "What the hell am I doing here?"  It was all gravy from there. I was met at the airport by an elderly gentleman who worked for Eckerd named Tom and we drove for three hours up to the camp. The scenery was breathtaking. It really was.  In a good news moment, I found out that New Hampshire is the second lowest state in terms of the level of taxes that it imposes upon its population. Translation: there is no state income tax nor is there a state sales tax. The price is see is the price you pay. I am going to save a bundle of money from this job. Not only that, but the camp provides me with five pairs of pants and five  t-shirts a well as winter gear and a whole whack of other perks that I am just scratching the surface of.   The kicker?   When I first arrived in camp I gazed around at the surroundings and noticed a small area that was enclosed that looked from a distance like large animal pen with solid wood walls. I inquired as to whether they took care of animals and Tom looked at me as if I had overdosed on a healthy handful of goofballs. Apparently what I thought was a farm pen from a distance was in fact a REGULATION OUTDOOR HOCKEY RINK. They play hockey outdoors (and the camp has a full set of gear for two teams - goalies included) from November until the snow leaves.   It almost made this Canadian kid cry.  Needless to say, I had a phenomenal four days up in the wilderness. They offered me a job and I took it. I am off to begin a two year contract on the 16th of July. I have new boots from M.E.C., a smile on my face and a new way to fill in application forms. Instead of being a 'student', I am now a 'theaputic worker' and a soon-to-be-Canadian-ex-patriate.   I can't wait to begin. I hate being here in the city and feeling like I don't belong in this town. I am far too comfortable with the freedom that I had in Kingston and I don't feel it here. Toronto doesn't want me, not in a malicious way, it just has too many other things to be concerned with and I can' be bothered to clamour for its attention. The smog gets in my eyes and makes me turn away to clear my senses. There was a community at Queen's of the like-minded in cahoots against something else. A secret joke that permeated the campus and those around it. I like the community at Eckerd. It's small and warm - it needs to be, the winters get to thirty below - and besides, I can finally get rid of my caffeine habit. I'll miss a lot of new music, but I can get back to it when I need to. Hell I think it's starting to be of lesser importance in my life.                  . . . . . . . .  but let's not get carried away. Music will always be there in my life.  The weather will suck and the kids will abuse me. They really will, I haven't met one counselor yet who doesn't have a story about a child attacking them, but what do I care. I was worried that I'd be a young'un in terms of the staff but my age (24) is right on the median for starting counselors (Thank you OAC and victory lap!). In early August I'll travel down to either Florida or North Carolina for a three week training course in the wilderness there.   The best news: They allow long hair and beards! I have always wanted to see what I'd look like with both or either of these states of appearance and this job will let me do it. My plan is to buzz my hair pretty short for the summer and then start the growth process . . . . I should have a pretty healthy white man's afro by Christmas, so when I get back to T.O. in December you can all go clubbing with me and my Funk Soul Brother hair.   The beard growth begins immediately upon arrival. I hate shaving. I really really do. That was one of my biggest (albeit wussiest) complaints about working at the Hojo. I had to shave everytime I went to work. It was such a hassle.  So I'll give up my dreams of a bohemian cosmopolitan lifestyle here in Canada's largest city for a chance to "get in touch with [my] inner redneck". I'm dropping out of society for a while but I can make it to Montreal on my weekends and I'll be in KIngston for Homecoming. I have to be. I just have to be. I'll have money. There's thirsty undergraduate (and graduate, Hi Geobey!) friends of mine who need free alcohol that only a freshly graduated and employed compatriate can provide them with. Plus, I can help soften the brain drain by dropping a healthy wad of American cash at Clark Hall, QP and Alfies.   Oh the plans that I am formulating. I haven't been this excited in a while.  New Hampshire the State has one quarter of Toronto the City's population.              I heard a voice calling from the wilderness. Calling from the Wilderness.             Not quite a whistle. Not quite a song. Not too short. Not  long.                                                                       - Martin Tielli   why are the Rheostatics so damnned good? why?    blargh  ajc

      O.k., it's late, I've had a lot of caffeine and I have a lot of new music to listen to - this could be a long blog  Well, I have big news!  I met  urlLink B.J. Surhoff  and I have his autograph! Booyah!  My friend Chris Bittle came up to Toronto from the cultural wasteland of Niagara Falls bearing with him a bottle of wine and Blue Jays tickets . . .  so we got together with our mutual friend/Boss of yesteryear Scott Courtice and went to see the Baltimore Orioles down at Skydome. We wanted to get there early to catch batting practice (and hopefully a batting practice home run ball). Unfortunately, they opened the doors at Skydome at 5pm for a 7:05pm first pitch. To kill time before we met Scott at the game, Chris and I walked around downtown and I was able to find a copy of Nick Hornby's "Songbook" which I have been trying to find for the past few months. Thus, armed with my new purchase, we went back to Skydome and were let in to watch the last thirty seconds of the Blue Jays batting practice. Long story short, the 3 of us went to the home run area and it took us around thirty minutes to realise that there were never going to be any home run balls hit our way - seeing as the Orioles, well, suck at just about anything this year . . . .  side note: Their pitcher,  urlLink Sidney Ponson , well he's a knight in Aruba. He is officially Sir  urlLink Sidney Ponson . Why? Because he's a baeball player. That is very stupid.   Anyway, so we head down to field level to check out the 100 level seats we had and we got there just in time to see some dumb-assed teenager (you'll see why I make the judgement in a second) watches a batting practice ball go by his outstretched arm and calls out "Hey  urlLink B.J.  Can I have the ball?"   urlLink B.J. Surhoff , currently involved in stretching blithly ignores him. The dumb-assed teen then yells out "You Suck!" So, this raises the ire of  urlLink Mr. Surhoff  and as he walks over to give some autographs to other fans, the kid says some more things to hime. So they start jawing and soon I am quite impressed by the fact that B.J. (A very very very unfortunate name to have I might add) was basically telling this stupid-assed kid to go and fornicate with himself.   I had to get an autograph. As a result,  urlLink B.J. Surhoff's  autograph now adorns the inside front cover of "Songbook" by Nick Hornby.

      The excitement is building as I count down the days until my re-location to New Hampshire.  ummmm, yeah.      Well, as life is all about lessons, here is what I've recently learned:  * Zach Galifianakis is funny.   * I will never be a rock star or play music for money        - not even on the streets will they pay (I haven't tried, but I assume)  * Most of the songs out there are based around the following three chords G, F, C. Close behind them is E, A, D If you are playing music and are writing songs, please stay away from those 6 chords. Switch to another instrument like the hammered dulcimer or the kantele (it's Finland's national instrument - http://virtual.finland.fi/finfo/english/kantele.html) Just rock out on your kantele, the guitar is soooo last century. How much longer can we keep churning out the same music? I'll just give up and become a DJ  * I am a horrible photographer - I recently got three sets of photos developed and they gave me half of the entire job. Why? Photographer error was the official reason. Jeez, I've dated three 'photographers' . . . you'd think it would of  rubbed off slightly. Apparently I'm the only Cubist photographer I know.  * When you get your hair buzzed, it feels no different. Until you run your hand over your head or look in the mirror.  * I can't get through the day without a bagel and cream cheese.  * They now stock graphic novels at Brentwood Library. Thanks to the assorted ratepayers and taxpayers of Toronto I was able to finally read some Cerebus the Aardvark and I must tell you that a) "High Society" and Church and State" are dammned funny b) the creator is a Canadian and publishes the entire thing out of Kitchener and c) unfortunately the creator - Dave Sim - is apparently a right-wing mysoginist and has gone insane (go here for proof: http://www.tcj.com/232/tangent0.html). I really enjoyed the stuff I read but I found out that only his early stuff in  Cerebus the Aardvark is good, while the rest slowly devovles as Dave starts getting hopped up on goofballs.   * Go see "The Good Thief" starring Nick Nolte. It is stunning. It just is.   * Don't start thinking about how old you are and then comparing where you are in life to where other people were (or are) in and around your same age. It's a vicious circle, especially if you are hypothetically  soon-to-be employed and have a lot of time on your hands.   * The second Bran Van 3000 album is genius. I can still hear the kantele ringing.   life long learning  blargh  ajc

      Well, here I am at Camp E-Toh-Hanee in Colebrook New Hampshire.  It's what I expected it to be, and I have no idea what I am doing most of the time. I think I'm going to like it here.   Who knows what the hell I've gotten myself into.  blargh  ajc

      It's been about two weeks (exactly) since I've made my way down here the United States and I must say that you haven't felt more American than when you and two other people grab some beer, drive 10 minutes to the Colebrook Shooting Range (an abandoned field down the hill on a one lane dirt road), drink the beers while you're in the car, and squeeze off a couple rounds from a 12 gauge shotgun.   Time off is wonderful.   My living arrangements during my timeoff consist of 14 conselors living in one big house - funnily enough named the Time Off House. We drink quite a bit. We drink like fish. Beer out here is dirt cheap. You can fire a pellet gun, set fire to an umbrella and a set of skiies, play Fire Baseball (tennis balls light on fire and then quickly pitched to a person holding a baseball bat), enagage in Beer Pong, and play music till all hours of the morning.  Mindless destruction of our living quarters? Loud Music? Beer at all times of the day? For god sake's, am I back in the Kingston ghetto?   No - reason: no neighbours to call the cops. Yay!!!!!  I'm really fucking tired. I had a great couple of days off.  In other news, I am off to Florida on August 3rd for 3.5 weeks to start my official Eckerd Youth Alternative training, officially dubbed "Catatogas". It's some intensive shit from what I've heard and I am super psyched about the whole thing. Anyway, It's night and I'm fucking tired.   these kids are a goddam handfull. As it was said in a staff meeting a few nights ago, "These are kids that theire parents can't handle, their teachers can't handle and the police can't handle." We have to handle them. That's why we drink. Luckily we only two it two nights a week (tops).        Love all y'all   blargh   ajc   ps, American money . . . . it's all one bloody colour! This is extremely hard to handle at a bar.

      and so I'm back from Florida as off last night.   wow. It was one of the most amazing and wonderful experiences of my life. I've also developed a burning hatred for the Florida climate that borders on homicidal. I spent 24 days in the company of a lot of cool ass people who are now back at their camp's and are going to do the same hard job that I'm up too.  I also receive the biggest paychecks that this poor Canadian has ever seen.  Result: I am now off to go shopping for a videogame system, either an X-Box or PS2 - haven't decided yet. I will update more but for now, I'm back, I had a great time, and everything is how it should be in my life right now.   blargh  ajc

      Adie, I remember a conversation we had way back in second year, looking over Fort Henry on a Hallowe'en morning. You said that it was weird to greet each day without mountains. I'm paraphrasing now now but my constant backdrop has bumps and bruises of stones and clouds and whatever else nature has chosen to do over time. I'm content here in the woods. There's a feeling of comfort in these rocky containers that make up my daily horizon.  I used to feel useless before I went to Catatogas training. Now I'm going to get tested by children that various parents, teachers and authorities couldn't or didn't want to handle. The mountains help. They give me ideas about boundaries and a feeling of safety.  The world can't get in and I can get out into it, I just need to save cash for a car.   Now, Florida was amazing.  Basically, there were 11 new counselors who were sent down to the crappy state of FLA and learn how to be good with the youth by living as the youth. We saw each other every single second of every single day and it was more luck than anything that we didn't end of murdering each other. I ended up hooking up with one of them during our two days off together, which was an added bonus to the entire endeavor. Not only do I have a support group of 10 other people that are doing the same job as me, but I've also made a whole lot of really cool friends. Cheesey, but I don't care.   It is really cool to think that i am finally working at my first job ever. I have very little debt thanks in most part to my parents and in very small part to the fact that schooling in Canada is dirt cheap. This is the first September where I haven't had to think about any type of scholastic messiness and it feels really good. I am now fully independent.   Charlie, how your Cowan get down like that?  To the scant few that read this, please send me your postal addresses to  Chief Andrew Cowan  c/o Camp E-Toh-Anee Route 1, Box 164E Colebrook, NH 03576  so that I can write you letters instead of email. It's much easier to write a letter now, plus it's always fun to get them here at camp.   Anyway, for those addresses that I do have, there are letters in their infancy that are currently gestating, but I never get any time to myself here, so who knows when you'll get it.    I miss all my friends, I really do and I hope everyone who reads this (for anyone that I have told about this small slice of my life is firmly in my "friend" category) is in good health, in good spirits or barring those two, in love.   blargh  ajc

      I'm not with it   I've dealt with so many different emotional issues today that I feel raw.  I've helped other people with crazy shit in the past, but that was with my friends and it was easy to solve with hot cocoa or a hug. How do you deal with someone, who, if they leave camp is going to be homeless? How do I talk to these kids sometimes when I have no real words to say?  To top it all off, I'm in charge of the 9/11 memorial stuff so I've spent the past few days immersed in all of that so I can answer as many questions as possible.  I have emails and half-written letters piling up to people that I miss and I want to tell them all (you all) personally but I'm just worn out after tonight so all I can do is write it here and hope that the right people read it.   Goodnight all   ajc

      Ummmmm, yeah   Well, for those of you who worry about my safety and security while here in the woods, don't worry - it generally takes about 4-5 months before a counselor sees their first restraint.  Unless you're me    Let's just say that September 11 will be memorable for more than just a full day of memorial services that I had to plan.  I never pictured that I'd get in the gut by a kid a couple a times while restraining him. Everything worked out in the end though and I wasn't seriously hurt.  On the good side of the news I think that I'm able to buy a car soon, so that will be cool  . . . . .   I am able to save soooo much of my damn paycheck it's not funny . . .and it's all in American cash!

I have a day off and I am going . . .shall I see you there? email me (andrewcowan@operamail.com)   bought a new car. Well, new in the fact that it is a '91 Cavalier that I bought off of some Polish guy two days before he went back to Europe - no joke. she runs great and only cost me 250 bucks SWEEEEET!  I will be in kingston on the 24th of October for the weekend YAY!!!! I get four days off and I decided to go back home for a few days and spend a lot of my hard earned american cash.  I still can't believe that I am living the life that I currently ihabit. I get alot of reading done. I have more money than I ever thought I'd have in a month. What sucks though is that this has been my first day off in over two weeks. Two of my co-counselors had to go off and do training at other camps, so it just leaves me with one other guy. He's cool, but I've already been by myself with the group for a few days already.  I'm tired and stressed out  I have a beard you wouldn't believe, or you might believe based on my amount of hair in general.   I miss all of you   blargh   ajc

      I'm in the middle of hte JDUC right now in kingston  it's weird, everything is completely different but that's not a bad thing at all.   I drove seven hours to be here and I've enjoyed every single moment of it.  I don't fit in here anymore. Well I do but not in the same way that I used to. I cared about that until I had a late night conversation with Bob that has been on of the year's highlights. Friends are people you learn from while you teach them.   I've realised that life goes on - no matter what it always does and I've second guessed almost everything about my life for the past six months, but I've got great friends who fill my life with Happy.   Chris Bittle, I (finally) sent you a return letter last week. You should get it soon - if the US Postal Serivce can stop massacering each other like Tutsis and Hutus, put down the automatic weapons and deliver de letter de sooner de better. I'll be down to NF to see you in Decemeber around Christmas Time. I miss ya buddy. Greg said hi in a round about McKellar manner.  i hope that everyone is full of Goodness - like caramel or nougat    blargh  ajc

      where to begin . . . .   honestly, do I begin with how I was trapped in Cornwall for a day that ended with trying to pay for gas in Quebec with no money and a speeding ticket  or do I tell how I got my left thumb broken in a restraint with a kid?  choices choices choices choices   Fuck it, we'll do this up chronological like  First off, if you're a friend of mine, I miss you. I miss you all and I wish that I had a normal life so that I could email or call you.     Anyway, Kingston was a fucking blast!!! Bob, thank you so much for letting me crash on your floor and all of your limitless hospitality. Man, you are a great friend. That weekend was everything I needed it to be, especially seeing everyone I wanted to in one form or another. It almost didn't happen though. My car broke down the night before I had to leave and so I borrowed one from my supervisor. It was a great feeling to see that your friends are as happy to see you as you are to see them.  Going home:  I left K-town at 5pm. The car broke down outside Cornwall an hour and a half later. I wasn't able to flag down a truck until 9pm. Crappy Crappy Crappy. I had to stay over in Cornwall for the evening and get up at 7 to make sure that my car was being fixed. So I waited in a Canadian Tire until 2:30 - blargh. When I left I was short on money and I figured that I had just enough to get gas. I was wrong. It was 10 miles from the Vermont border when I found this out. Luckily they let me pay with a post-dated cheque. So I think that everything is fine. . . . . wrong.  20 minutes after I crossed the Vermont border I got pulled over. Shit, that ended up costing me 120 bucks.   Great weekend, horrible travel.  Because I missed the day I had to forgo a day off, which meant that I had to then go on an 11 day stretch without a day off. The last two days were taken up with restraint after restraint - my group is acting like shit - I want to kill every one of them right now. In one of these I end up landing on my thumb wrong, and a day later x-rays  reveal that my left thumb is broken in two places. I am now in a cast for 6 weeks feeling like a cripple. The doctor restricted me to inactive duty, but I still had to be in on 2 restraints yesterday.     Yeah, the job is stressing me out right now, but I'm not unhappy. There are a lot of good things going on right now. I'm becoming a better counselor as the days go on and I'm getting to know the other people here well. I get to go home for American Thanksgiving for a few days soon. I'll be in Toronto from the 27th to the 30th of November, then 3 weeks later I'll be back from the 23rd of December until the 30th or so. Things to look forward to.  I'm sorry if this post is jumbled or short, but I'm tired, stressed and crippled in my dominant hand. Good news? My beard rocks!!! It fuckin does!!!!   keep healthy and stay happy all    blargh   ajc

      Cars, Bah . . . . . or  Life Lessons Learned    yeah, so I was supposed to be in Toronto well, now. And I am not. Bah. There's a perfectly logical explanantion in the fact that whatever force moves the universe does not want me owning a 1991 Chevy Cavalier, at least that is my conclusion.   So it's Thanksgiving here in the redwhiteblur and I had from Wednesday night until Sunday night off due to a camp-wide break (known as Homesdays - they occur at the end of each session - it gives the perps some time back in the real world) and I was going to get my alternator belt fixed in the Cavalier and drive to Toronto for the extended weekend. I picked up the car Wendesday afternoon but on the way back to the TO (time off) house it decided in an uppity fashion that it was too good for a thing known as a transmission. It conked out real good.  So I was stranded here in Colebrook for the weekend but it hasn't been that bad. For one thing it has given me a few days to relax with hardly any distractions at all. I've been ab;e to rent some movies and just do nothing at all. I had as Thanksgiving dinner at the program director's house and today I was able to do something heavenly: go to Montreal. Two counsellors came back early and we decided to day trip it.   Now, Montreal and I normally don't get along to well. Today was an exception. We got in around 11 am and just roamed around the downtown. It felt great to be back in a big urban mess that reminded me of the city that I had left scant months before.  Except almost speaks French, but that's neither here nor there.  So we wandered and had a great time then grabbed some luch. Afterward we went our separate ways so that we could get our individual tasks completed. Mine? Buy hard to find cds that are impossible to get anywhere in New Hampshire . . . . . . .  aka music by (lesser known) Canadian artists.   210 Canadian dollars later I had accomplished my mission with verve and gusto as I stood there with 12 cds in my hand and 2 new Paul Quarrington novels thrown in for good measure.   The list: The Thrills "So Much For The City" Joel Plaskett "Truthfully Truthfully" Young and Sexy "Life Through One Speaker" Jom Bryson " The North Side Benches" Martin Tielli "Operation Infinite Joy" The Stills "Logic Will Break Your Heart" Buck 65 "Talkin Honky Blues" Explosions in the Sky "The Earth is not a Cold Dead Place" The Wrens "In the Meadowlands" Two Minute Miracles "Volume 3" New Pornographers "Electric Version" The Constantines "Shine A Light"   It was amazing to just walk through a downtown core and being there with all the people in a city that has three times the population of the state you came from and 100 times the population of the town you're returning to. It was also a comfort to see faces that weren't lilly white. (New Hampshire isn't diverse? My god who would have thought it!)  On the way back we listened to the CBC. Kid Koala was live in session. I think I'll be back again soon.   blargh  ajc

      Escape  Lately I've been in the habit of spending my time off just borrowing a car or taking my own and just going on jaunts around the New Hampshire countryside ending up wherever I end up. I think its just a need to escape and be among the regular 'normal' population that I can't find at camp or Colebrook (where the unmarried women have kids, beards, or no teeth).   A by-product of this is that I have become a rampant consumer for stuff, for instance I buy cds and DVDs like the're going to save my life. Why? Well I have come up with this theory. 1) I need to be out among the people and I need an excuse to go to all of these towns and cities so . . . . hey, why not grab some cds/books/DVDs? 2) I have a lot of disposable cash as my expenses at camp are next to nothing.   I should be a scientist    blargh  ajc

      December . . .  . . .   it's fuckin' cold   a week ago I awoke at 6 in the morn to light the cook stove and, well, there was FOUR FUCKING FEET OF SNOW ON THE GROUND. I had to jump through snowdrifts the size of retarded 6 year olds to get to the cook stove   Not that there is any height difference between retarded 6 year olds and normal six year olds but I felt that this snowfall warranted a reatrded label.   Hmmmm, not PC . . . bah  That being said, winter has hit with the force of a .44 Magnum slug. This is a good thing as any kid in a huddle up takes responsibility for the crap that they pulled within five minutes of being outside just so that they no longer have to endure our cold weather.   It also means that our outdoor ice rink is ready to go. I have had so much fun being able to skate with these kids and play hockey with them. Many here are pretty good but I've got the veteran savy of palying and watching hockey since I was a wee lad, so it generally evens out in my favour.    Christmas is upon us soon and that means a journey Southward to Toronto. This time I am not taking any bloody chances with automobile transportation.   I'm taking a plane, that way i can't get stuck on the side of the highway . . . and if I do then my family gets a lucrative settlement in a class action lawsuit against the airline.  Either way I hope to be in Toronto the evening of the 23rd and leaving on the evening of the 28th. Far too little time in my home and native land.     I hope to see many of you over the holidays    blargh   ajc

      So this is the New Year . . . .  and I don't feel any different   Well, I would like to astound you all with new and exciting stories of daring do that have occurred up at Camp E-Toh-Anee over the past two months but I can't.   In the positive end of things I have purchased a vehicle. A pretty sweet 2000 Subaru Outback. It's got heated seats, heated mirrors, 4 wheel drive and - the kicker - an in dash 6 cd player. It kicks ass and for only 14,000 dollars. What does this mean? Well, for one thing I have to come up with about 260 dollars each month to pay for the damn thing. It is now officially the largest commitment I have ever made to any one thing. Scary. I have to stay employed or have some kind of steady income for the next 5 years so that I won't go to jail or get bad credit.   This could be seen as a bit of bad timing. Why? Well, for one thing I have been seriously contemplating leaving my job here at Eckerd. Why? Well, it all starts with the fact that I haven't had any fun at work for the past two and a half months. To the point, I wake up and am generally miserable.   The reasons are as follows:  Before December I was in a group called the Sunapees. They were a bunch of little shits - the worst running group on camp property including restraints left, right and centre. Then, the New Hampshire government decides to cut 2 million from its social services budget. This meant that we could only afford three groups on property soooooooooooo goodbye Sunapees! They shipped the worst kids out and split the rest between the remaining three groups.  Happy day! I was going to get a group switch! Huzzah! Life will no longer be shitty. I'll have kids that will want to work on their issues and change as opposed to little fuckheads that want to cause shit and make everyone's lives miserable.  That was my thought process.  Unfortunately, I was placed into the Ammonosucs (Ammos for short) and promptly the group began to fall apart. Placed on top of this is the fact that our new Program Director is trying to make my new co-chief and I be more physical with the kids. Restrain them more instead of talking to them. It's a long discussion that can be noiled down to in this way:  My co-counselor and I get shit on weekly due to the fact that the group is runnuing badly. The kids don;t get to bed until at least 10 pm nightly and since I've been back I haven't had a day when I haven't ahd to hold onto a kid.   I think that I am not suited for this job/lifestlye. I'm tired of having to grab a kid and wrestle with them. I want to be able to deal with real issues without having one of my kids throw a stupid, petty problem.   Example: On Sunday night one of my guys decided to lwet group know that he had been sexual abused twice by a cop when he was growing up - one of the most couragous things I've ever seen and one of the heaviest moments that I have ever had to deal with. He had told me a few hours before and had been crying on my shoulder (and I was crying right back). For the most part the group did very well and gave the guy a ton of support and encouragement. Thirty minutes later all hell had broken loose. I had my arm slammed in a door, had to pull two kids off of another, and had to grab on to two different guys running around campsite.   I am getting tired of this shit. I really am. It sucks having to grab a hold of a guy. It sucks having to wake up thinking "Oh shit, who am I going to deal with today?" It sucks wondering what part of me is going to get hurt today. I've had so many different injuries occur doe to the kids that it is just wearing me down. Added on to that is the fact that I am far away from the wonders of modern living and I hardly get any time to communicate with friends and family - who I dearly miss.  So, I'll probably be out of this job either as early as May or as late as August. But who knows . . . things might get better and I'll wind up staying. It's hard to admit when you can't do something that you want to but I think I am getting close to that stage. If I do leave I'll probably go back to Toronto and try to find temporary work as a hotel clerk while looking for something permanent - if anything just to be able to make my car payments/ car insurance payments monthly.   I think I'll take  urlLink Karen's  advice and carry a horse pendant in my pocket. My luck's gotta change sometime . . . . .     blargh  ajc

      Well, quitting in May or August has been changed . . . .   I'm handing in my two month notice as of Wednesday. I leave this place on the 17th or 18th of April.  What does this mean? Who the fuck knows, I'm getting outta here. I have tried my best and done all that I can but I am just getting fed up with the whole process. Now the plan is to go back to Toronto, get a joe job (a la hotel clerk) and start looking anew. It's going to be a bitch telling my supervisors on Wednesday though - especially since I am supposed to be here for two years. I feel like a big dick just up and leaving only 8 months into the job and I know that the kids arn't going to take this well at all but for the sake of my mental health - and physical health while we're at it - I need to be in a place where I don't wake up juvenile delinquints every morning at 7am.   I need a change and it can't come soon enough

      It's been an eventful month . . . . . .   It's been a busy month . . . . . .   My last day at camp was Thursday the 18th of March. It got to a point where I needed to leave for the sake of my sanity, health and everything else. For one thing i wasn't leaving the camp in a lurch, at least in terms of staffing. We were overstaffed to the point where we had to ship out three counselors a session to other camps, so it wasn't a huge setback to lose me. On the other hand, telling the kids about my last day was pretty tough but it had to be done.  To sum up, it was a very very stressful experience altogether. I was very frustrated by the fact that I was out of touch with the rest of the world and my friends for such an extended period of time.   After my last day I spent a few days at the Time Off house in New Hampshire getting all my stuff packed and getting drunk, often at the same time. We had a big party with a bonfire and a beer pong tournament. It was a good way to go out.  Then, I went skiing with my parents in Maine for a few days as a way to unwind. They were already heading out there so I decided to join them. It was nice and relaxing. On my way back to Toronto (with everything I own piled into my Subaru) I stopped in Kingston just to see who was around. Luckily Bob hadn't left for the weekend and he was kind enough to let me crash on his couch for two nights. It was good to go out with a good friend again, dare I ssay theraputic. There could ahve been a better ending to Saturdauy night, but an example of poor etiqitte (sp?) left me in the lurch.   Now I'm back in Toronto - truly a different world from where I was. I'm still adjusting and trying to figure out how to contact all those I left in the lurch a while ago.   It is good to be back    blargh  ajc

      Setting the record straight . . . . .   Unibrau IS getting back together.   This is a fact.  It is as solid as a Rock.   I spent over five hours over at Tree's place (the Blistering Bass) with Mike (the Sintillating Singer) today, not to mention the four hours Friday night. Rick (The Devastating Drummer) is moving to Kingston in 2 weeks . . . . . .  or so he says.  None the less . . Rock will be had. Promises will be kept. Don't think I don't remember: Karen and Howie.   Damn I had a good time. Tree and I had all of our shit down TIGHT and we came up with several new songs that will melt faces. I'm not fucking around. I could pee myself. We will practice. We will play. All of you who read this will come and be amazed.  Have I mentioned the fact that I wasn't fucking around? Oh, I did.  We are getting to the point wher the name Unibrau is not acceptable. That was the old, not practiced enough us. We will have a new name . . .  we just don't know what it is yet . . . . give me suggestions:      andrewcowan@operamail.com     All in all, an interesting night. I was out with old friends. Or, at least friends, who by accident, made me realize how old I was getting. On the other hand, it's cool to see where people are heading in their lives. It's cool that I am actaully starting to establish one instead of flitting about as I've done for the past while. Ah, Otterdale . . . . . It's going to be a good summer in T.O.      There's too many of my friends getting married. I'm happy and sad at the same time, but more in the sorry for myself vein that a good sleep will cure.  On that note, goodnight and bon nuit.    blargh  ajc

      well, then.  tradeoffs are a bitch . . . . . they ruin your life in a way that is indistinguishable to the first glance that you take and then they come right out to bite you on the ass.  Everyone needs to eat and have fun.  I have so much freedom but I have no way to exercise it without dooming myself to the poor house.  Impending (I only call it that because it only occurs at age 25) adulthood kinda scares the shit out of me. Some decision take on greater weight due to the time remaining in the Sunny Golden Years of Youth. I have friends conquering the world and some letting the world have its way with them and I'm trying the best I can to field an army of my own but it's hard when I've been allergic to sustained work.    So the place I work sucks. I know this. There are a million different things I could do about this and where my life is going. I'm used to relying on geography but there's no god damn map to be found.   Tommorrow I'm spending a good chunk of it looking for a new job. Something that I'll actually enjoy. It'll take a while

      I am in a very bad mood today and I have been trying to figure out why. That's something useful that I learned at my previous camp, namely, when you're feeling shitty find out why and get it out somehow so you don't take it out on other people who don't deserve it. Basically I'm jus frustrated at my lack of success at finding a job I'll enjoy.   One may argue that 'they call it work because it's not supposed to be fun' . . .  true, but I don;t want to settle. I don't want to settle at all.  so the search continues . . . . . . .    blargh  ajc

      why is it that I have wonderful, cohesive thoughts about life and everything in it, but alas they only seem to hit me at work . . . .when I can't write them here . . .   everyone's at lunch, which is why I can do it now.  but they'll be back soon. bastards, quelling my creativity.    O.k., non sequiter: I get angry, really angry, when I watch The Swan. This is sick and disgusting crap. If you feel bad about yourself, go do something natural about it. While you're at it, try to think about why you feel bad about yourself and if it's your appearance. It's shallow and stupid. Besides, most of the population is far from perfect.   Take myself. I've gained quite a bit of weight and now it's time to get off my fat ass and do something about it. I'm not going to surgify it off but find ways to remove it in the correct way, i.e. lift weights, go biking, play soccer, play dodgeball, join a summer hockey or ultimate league and try to eat right. I want to get rid of my stomach and I don't hate myself because of it, but I don't feel too good about it either, so I must harness the willpower that lies dormant in my brain and do it. That and continue to write music.  wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee    blargh  ajc

      it's been a while.  once again I have a new job that I was lucky enough to get three days after I got back from parts known and unknown. I am a Sales Manager at the Ramada hotel that's 10 minutes from my house. It pays pretty well and the best thing of all, it gives me regular hours so that my free time actually coincides with the free time of my friends.   This importance cannot be understated.  Basically, I've gotten over the bitterness of having to work nine to five and have begun to accept the reality that I'm faced with. What keeps me going? Well, three things. (1) the fact that i've been able to reconnect with a lot of cool people and hang out with them. (2) Playing music again. Normally you call the cops when you're locked in a basement over a weekend, but when you're playing loud rock music and writing songs with a bunch of great guys, that goes a long way to recharging the tank. (3) Making money. It's all about the benjamins.   Work make one day feel like three. Work makes a weekend seem like minutes.   I'm going to go look for new work.    blargh  ajc

      For you Queen's kids out there:  Bedouin Soundclash is now a landmark band . . . . . don't believe me? Chart Magazine seems to think so  urlLink here   and the excerpt  "Back in the mid-1990s, Crowe founded Whole Lotta Milka, one the ska acts notorious for paving the way for the influx of artists being produced out of Winnipeg today. After contributing to Stomp Records' All Skanadian Club compilations in 1995 and 1996, Whole Lotta Milka put out their debut album, Got Milka? in 1996, before the then-two year old label was home to such landmark acts as The Kingpins and Bedouin Soundclash.

      a good night last night.  It all started when James Chew came to town and we've been hanging out a few times this week. It was suggested that we get some people together and undertake the simple proposition of heading out to the Madison for a good time and beer. A recipe for success in any cookbook. So, being the crafty man that he is, James grabbed Jim Elson and Mike Rawle, both good Queen's boys in their own right whom I have not seen in a dog's age. We arrive at the Madison and by the end of the evening the cast of characters has increased from four to many. The players: The above mentioned 4, Jill Cuttle, Adrian Rawle, David Lee, Justin Persaud, Scott Johnston, Johnathan Shui, Ramsey Leung,  Anne Braedly, Tanya Wakalut, Kerry Hamilton, Tony Kovacic, Pete LeBlanc and assorted extras in and among the Madison.  holy shit. So it appears that we had turned up on the night that Tony Kovacic was turning 25 and we joined in the celebration. It was an amazing night of catching up and random circumstance that has been sorely missing over the past year all rolled into a psudeo-Martingrove reunion. To top it all off James gave me the sweetest Engrish t-shirt from Japan extolling the virtues of my car. It is a good car. Many good conversations and many good memories with the best part being the randomness of it all.   I am a big fan of random occurrences . . . . .   The one down part to the evening was the fact that I completely fumbled a wingmanning opportunity for Elson, but that was a mistake easily cleared up at the end of the night  . . . . . . my bad. I did take some deserved shit for it though.  Anyway, it's nice to know that there are still some nights when good can become great all by accident.    blargh!  ajc

       So there now . . . .     so, I am sitting here at work trying desperately to find some way of being productive, and it's not working. So I'm not working right now then . . . .    So, how was my weekend? Well, it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be, which was a relief. (I thought it would be bad mainly due to the fact that the previous weekend was amazing and that karma would come to collect what it was due) Actually, the best time came when  urlLink James  and I were able to have an amazingly honest conversation about what's going on in our lives. All on the 401 at 4:00 in the morning. It was the type of conversation that I haven't been able to have in a while - and it was dammned refreshing.   Then there was hockey. Sunday night hockey downtown at an arena by Queen and Jarvis. I was pumped. I was ready. By my third shift I was almost puking. A little out of shape? Damn, I have got to get my legs back under me. All in all I don't think that I embarassed myself to much and I made a great pass to spring my centreman for a breakaway goal. Final tally: 1 point, 1 puke. The puck went in the net . . . the puke went in the can. Need to exercise . . . . so I have indoor soccer tonight.  Last night was a good time. I was able to go see the Apples in Stereo down at the Legendary Horseshoe Tavern, which was organized by my stunningly organized (and  urlLink hipster famous ) friend  urlLink Sofi Papamarko . A good time was had by all, especially the Apple's lead singer who was rambunctiously drunk and highly entertaining - flailing around the stage, asking if the band was ready to launch into a new tune and promptly counting them in without waiting for their response. I think the best thing about their whole performance was that it (a) featured the happiest guitarist in the world and (b) for those of you who have seen him, the Apple's frontman looks like an English folk singer, much less the indie popster that he is. I kept having visions of him covering any one of Dick Gaughan's songs. But I kept that observation/delusion to myself.   Toronto is fun   blargh  ajc

       Balance . . . it's coming together   Well, I was talking to my friend Mark last night and I am realising that for the first time in a long while things are going pretty smoothly. I have a regular 9-5 job where I am guaranteed not to be attacked at. I see my friends with a healthy, non-bran-induced regularity. I get to exercise twice a week with 2 and a half hours of soccer on Tuesdays and an hour and a half of hockey on Sundays - which has lead to a small but encouraging loss of stomach. I get to rhearse with my band and still find time to look for new work to replace the boredom I have now. It's all going pretty well . . . . .    Yes, I realize that I have jinxed myself, but whatever.   Something else, I have decided that if I write song lyrics they are not going to be love songs, mostly due to the fact that there's far too many of them floating out there. Every kind of of metaphor, simile and other literary devices have been used to death to describe being in love, out of love, wondering what love is, blahblahblah. There are much more interesting subjects to explore.   I haven't found them yet, but I am sure that they are out there. Small little stories to be told.   blargh  ajc

       Thoughts on that other passport I hold     America is hate. America is Hate and Fear and Suspicion and the Last Great Hope for Anything at all. There was never anything created here in the Americas  nothing that was truly native to the continent other than that which was tamed. The people, the animals, the hills, the trees. Those that came to colonize were thrown back and have never realized it. Nature has its way with all of us.  America is Hate quantified, calculated and with each newly completed census there is a new diagram of the Dividing Line and the Ties that Bind so that they can be used as a noose to tighten around the necks of those of a lighterdarker hue. It is a country that realises that life is us versus them and me versus you and other End of the World struggles in minutia. Armageddon was a daily occurrence. Armageddon is the history of America. Armageddon is the present America unwrapped daily in the attention bequeathed to it in the headlines, bylines and skylines of the Modern Now. Armageddon is a President who cares more about the afterlife than the lives in his command. And it is a Him.  It is the New. It is the New World. Votes, thats where the key is. Who can get out more of Us to prevent the evil Them? No one has yet to figure out the lock, by yet the door is always open and the line is indefatigable in its enormity - look at the fences meant to constrain it. Look at the words that contain it and keep it from boiling over, albeit without any hope of success. It is a country meant to boil over on to itself, seething and burning, but nothing cleanses better than fire. Thats why Nature burns forests. America is a Constitution but was brought in to this world shouting at the top of its lungs clamouring for attention.   It did not end its first sentence with a period but with an exclamation for its Declaration!  It is the worlds Modern Democracy.  Forget Europe.		 Forget Asia.	       Forget Africa.  This is it baby!   All thrown together with the hating, the bile, the suffering and the imagined idea that yesterdays cotton slave is tomorrows SUV owner. This is the land of Equal and other artificial flavours. It is the land of promises that may be empty, but at least we are given a cup and told: Fill it up boys! Fill it up girls! I dont care what your groin contains! Fill to the brim and if it overflows, Build Another! Build The Biggest One You Can Until It Cracks Under Your Weight! In the history of the Rest of The Word these promises are made, but not with the urgency and the level of earnestness that comes with the voices that trumpet it.  Greece: the germ of the idea, then vaccinated by class and other such educational devices that the Romans juryrigged, be it originated by the Caesars or the Charlemagnes. Where the feud was with the feudal system and the lies brought out with their own crosses to bear. A light quickly snuffed out by the Dark Ages. But oh what a light! The seed in need of a new ground.   Europe: a whitewash of masqueraded intolerance and the only land where Hate is a Final Solution on a plain round the Cape of Good Hope. The Germans were kept in first and they adopted the stiff upper lip. The only Good Indian was a Dead Indian no matter the continent, no matter the god. This is a continent that prints incorrect maps to make itself look bigger. Where nationalism was devised only to legally divide Warring Tribes still at each others throats.  Britain: oh so much of the pomp, but the circumstances vary with names. In America, Lord is a surname at best while England kindly places all of them in one House where they may shout at each other as to where they shall vacation. The United Kingdom is the closest of the Old World to the New, but can only be the sad pathetic dad, aping his childs behaviour to gain the acceptance so desperately needed. Where the promise was given to get men to quench their fires and drop their pitchforks. Democracy makes a horrible release value for the steam of class anger.  America gave the promise and then continued on, extolling her protgs: Make your own fire. Build your own pitchfork.Sell it to the highest bidder! Theres land for us all! Theres hope for us all! Britain saw that these were weapons. America saw that these were tools. What trust!  It is here that the experiment of Trust was undertaken. The trust in the Brain, the trust in the Brawn, and the trust that we can all sort it out together, no matter if Brain is masquerading as Brawn. Many were given that trust  a million times more had to fight for it.   It was a simple trust, one set forth by imperfect men and then captured by women and those once seen as half a man. They fought for it at Bull Run, at Shiloh, in Hells Kitchen, in Brooklyn. Freedom kept on marching in Alabama, in Chicago and in every other undocumented battlefield. The Brain and the Brawn, at war with each other over the ground of the heart. The Hate that consumes no matter what the date, time or place.   Authors and victors, every one of them human, and all of them flawed imperfections of their ancestors. The nation reflecting the limitations but resounding with the call of Hope: a fire that is Abel to Hates Cain. A fire that is able to remain burning here, in the last outpost of humanity, all the while seeking to illuminate Americas tabla rasa.   Hope, Trust, and the Tools to see it forward. That is our gift. The Hate will remain. The world has seen so much Hate. Proof? You can glance at the history books where the words jump out at your eyes: Mongols, Christians, Saracens, Protestants, Balkans. Or one could take a jet over to the dividing line of Palestine. You can stroll through Compton or Rexdale and Ill pay you for each white face we see. The ghettos of Warsaw can be glimpsed in the projects of Chicago.  One Age is not a finality. Everything changes, evolves and metaphorizes. America can take its jazzercise, taebo and transform it because of the tools.   You cant pass each test without lessons. You cant advance each grade without age. America is the student with Nature as its teacher. Humanitys the Class Clown. Nature cries out: Learn the lesson or repeat the grade until you get it right! Horrible, despicable, yet all necessary so as not to repeat it.  Freedom: Barking and yelping at the table then hit on the nose when it begged for scraps. Kicked in the ribs, but then back to fetch the masters slippers.  It has been given the breath of life and cant be undone.  No alteration can be learned without evolution. Now is not a final end, hell it isnt even close. It is a limitless chain stretching to the future with an anchor to the Promises of the Past, put into each mind with each new school day. We continue to create the unknowing lessons so that they may learn.  We are only 130 years removed from a war to make the blacks people and one generation removed from making them People. We are the first colourblind generation and we are in transition  we are a living classroom for those down the line. And when it falls down, who are you going to call now?  Hate was the birthstone of America and it sparkles in the fire of every violent act. It is the heat of the forge and the heat of the anvil upon which the Future is Being Wrought.  A Haven that brings together the Others, but gives them the Tools and the Promise so that one day Hope will be replaced with Now and they will intertwine and create something wonderful.  Amen.     What the hell do I know anyway?

       All Pretty Like, Yessiree!    And my blog looks so much better. It's a wonder what an hour long crash course in html can do to make this thing look good. I have links! I have comments! I need to get out more. And so I did.  So, what have I been up to since last week? The big news of course is finding out about the Cloak and Dagger pub on Queen St. It's a small little hole-in-the-wall bar that was found this Saturday night while I was out on the town with my band and special guest star, Sean Geobey. Not only was the establishment dark and dingy, but it was cramped and the only entrance brought you directly through the stage. It is my new favourite place to go in Toronto. Not only that, but the band that played was fabulous. There were four guys and they called themselves the Stadium Rock Band . . . . . they looked like Rock Stars, had Rock Star moves (the scissor kick, the Townsend windmill, playing face-melting solos in the crowd), and more importantly, kicked our ass with Triumphant Rock Power. How can you go wrong when you open your set with a note pefect Smoke on the Water? They were great musicians (including Tyler Stewart from the Barenaked Ladies on drums) and put on a live show that was second to none. I was in heaven.  ROCK  Things that are making me happy: - the new Streets album "A Grand Don't Come For Free" brillantbrillantbrillantbrillantbrillantbrillant I haven't stopped listening to it - My plans for the weekend  going to a cottage, gonna drink some beer - Hockey in the summer I have missed the feeling of camping out in front of the crease and getting hammered by guys much taller than me.  - Downloading the Jay-Z/Danger Mouse's "The Grey Album" oh, so good - Hard Core Logo The best rock and roll movie ever  Things that make me not so happy - The Iraq torture scandal/the Middle East I get angry to the point of irrationality over (a) the sheer lunacy and inhumanity of it (b) no one is taking the blame    (c) Bush looks like he'll win again and (d) my inability to do anything meaningful about it - The fashions for 12 year olds Ummmm, why are 12 year olds dressing like their 20? Call me a  crotchety old man but it's better than being a dirty old man and ogling them (don't think I didn't see you there Mr. Forty Year Old Wandering Eyes in the Camry by Humber Valley this morning. Shame on you.) - The new Gomez album is $20.99 $20.99 . . . for a new cd? Whatth'fuck! - Looking for a new job Countless applications. No responses. Screw you working world.   However, it is summer and it is tank top weather. Sweet heaven.     blargh  ajc

       Losing my wheels = losing my mind    So, I no longer have the use of my Subaru. I am pretty down about this. It all is due to the fact that Geico, the car insurance provider that I acquired whilst in New Hampshire, does not cover Canada - something to do with fault vs no-fault insurance.  "That's fine" I said to myself and promptly I began to look for another provider . . . . . and then I realised that to get insurance here in Canada I need to legally import the car here to Canada, a prospect that will probably end up costing me in the low thousands of dollars. I can't afford that. So, my car languishes in the driveway, undriveable and lonely. It also somehow managed to acquire a flat tire a few days ago. Blah. So, I am calling the New Hampshire dealership to find out if they'll buy it back, or if it would make more economic sense to just import it and sell it here. In the meantime however this means that I no longer have the freedom that I once did.   I could go anywhere at any time, bound only by the limitations of a 9-5 job. Just hop in the 'Ru and I could go where I please, accompanied by a large selection of cds and a 6 disc changer to bring the sound to me.   Now, I have to share a car with my dad. Not just any car either but a 12 year old Honda that is nearing it's final days. A car that my parents don't trust to go anywhere outside the city.  This bums me out.  ----------------------------------------------   Toronto: The Pathetic Poser City   or, Why I Am Proudly Uncool   So, I was talking to my new Australian friend Evan last weekend and we made plans to get a few people together and go out to a Drum and Bass night so that we could find some good music to dance to.  To DANCE to.  So, Evan, Brent, Jess and I went out to the Gypsy Co-op on Queen St. West for some Drum and Bass dancing. The music itself was pretty cool.   The people there thought they were.  I haven't seen this many people with arms folded staring at one another since a middle school dance. The only thing that prevented me from believing that I hadn't been magically whisked back to the hallowed gym at Islington Junior Middle School was the fact that the guys and girls weren't standing on opposite sides, staring each other down. The four of us decided to get a dance floor going and hopefully everyone else will start. I must point out that at this time it was around midnight, and there should have been a dance floor started by at least 10 o'clock, but then again I am uncool in this city of attitude, so what do I know. Anyway, the four of us are dancing, the rest of the crowd is standing and staring, the d.j. is spinning some pretty cool music and there's this one weird white guy with a microphone turned down really low and is doing what I can only surmise is some kind of Sean-Paul-faux-reggae-shoutouts/what-the-hell-are-you-doing-you-dumb-putz-shut-up-and-dance. You really had to see it, it was hilarious. The bottom line of this rant story is that only about 10 percent of those in the room were dancing, which seemed silly to me because it was too loud in the bar to carry on any kind of sustained conversation, so the only alternative to dancing was to stand there and pose. Way to go everyone.   So, I need to find another place where there is good music to dance to and people will dance to it.  It's a big city    blargh  ajc

       Bold Prediction   I'm playing soccer tonight. It's 32 degrees right now and there's a smog warning in effect. I am going to die.   I had forgotton what polluted air looked like after spending my past three summers in a combination of Kingston/New Hampshire/and (for a month last year) Florida. Here it is a fairly clear day but the air is still gray - man that is sickening.   Belgium would be nice this time of year.

       Fan's On . . . . . shit's flying   And the band plays on . . . . .   unless your band name is/was Unibrau. Then you've got a bass player who now will never play with your drummer again. It's kind of like the Police, when Stuart Copeland would move his cymbals so he couldn't see Sting on stage . . . . well, except that they were more talented, successful and, oh yes, talented. I kid, but I'm pretty bummed out about this. I mean I was having a couple second thoughts about the band, but over the past weeek and a half I've written some exciting new stuff that had the potential to be pretty killer by our standards. Anyway, apparently there was a huge falling out between Tree and Rick this weekend and from what I can see it's been coming for a while. So, there's still crap going on.  dreams of rock psudo-stardom are put on hold    blargh  ajc

       Sometimes It Works . . . Soemtimes It Don't    (Disclaimer . . . . . it's 3 in the morning on a Wednesday and I need to work tommorrow . . . . . errrr today)   Sometimes the most friendly people turn out to be the most fake. Sometimes your instincts are all you have Sometimes it only makes sense in the long run Sometimes triumph can supercede doubt Sometimes it's the other way round Sometimes you wanna run screaming down College St., but you'll know she'll hear you Sometimes you wanna hide in a stairwell telling the world that you don't need it   Sometimes it works Sometimes it don't  Live for the former because more often it's the latter.   When it is the former  . . . . . whoah, look the fuck out, 'cause it's gonna be a doozy.     Try is the operative word . . . . .   why the fuck not? honestly, why the fuck not?   get down with your bad self     ajc

       A Good Weekend Means A Crappy Monday   There was tons of goodness from Thursday on. Tons.  A baseball game was taken in on the Thursday night. The Jays did their best impression of the French army and surrendered in the first inning without any fight. Of course, when you put together an infield of Chris Gomez at third, Chris Woodward at short, Frank Menechino at second (and  leadoff! ), along with special guest star Dave "Double A" Berg at first, you have only yourself to blame. I went with Dave and Jeremy and we snuck in a mickey of vodka, which we promptly used to add spice to our carbonated beverages. Unfortunately we almost got caught as we were filling up in the top row - an usher snuck up on us to give us All Star ballots. Well, there wasn't so much stealth involved in as much as our half-assed attempt to hide the bottle. So, presumably while the usher went to get reinforcements we quickly emptied the contents of the bottle into our drinks and hightailed to the opposite end of the stadium - where we spent 15 minutes filling out All Star ballots with Dave Berg's name. Hey, why not?  The game was good, and so was drinking afterwards.  Work Friday went by in a blur. I did as little work as possible in as much time as possible. Wheeeeeee.  Friday night Brent, his girlfriend Jess and I met up at Dave's condo, and we promptly drank a lot. We drank White Russians on the condo's communal rooftop patio and shuffled off to My Apartment where we met up with Wee Kirsty and Evan. A good time was had despite the sardine nature of the club. Kirsty went out to make a phone call and for reason the bouncers decided not to let her back in, so she went ballistic on them. I wish I had seen it. For one thing I would have loved to see a Scottish girl go off on the bouncers.   I ended up waking up on Dave's couch with a headache that wouldn't go away until later that evening - when I began drinking again. "Bite the dog that bit you" is one of Chris Bittle's favourite sayings, and it proved true in this case. I haven't been this hungover in a while. It wasn't until later that I realised that it wasn't the beer that did it to me, but it was the shots that I had forgotten about . . . . .   So Dave, Kirsty and I made breakfast and ate it up on the roof in glorious sunshine with an increadible view. It was a great morning. The nap later was even better.   Saturday night was more laid back but just as enjoyable. I went to Scott and Megan's for dinner and Emma, Caitlyn (who I haven't seen in over a year) and Megan's friend Jenn all came. We had a great dinner and an even better time at the Madison, where we ran in to  urlLink Eric  and Laura.   To top it all off, Rick came over on Sunday and we were able to polish off a song written a week ago and get a completely new song all figured out and recorded. Bliss.  Now I am sitting here at work, way too tired from the festivities of the weekend to really care about the crappy things I have to do here. Not only that but there's a Subaru sitting forlornly in my garage like a prisoner on death row, waiting for its future to be decided. I don't want to sell it, but it looks like I have to.   Crap.   ajc

       I'm sorry . . . I normally hate politics   I try to stay out of politics, mostly due to the fact that I consider myself not that well informed and also I got sick of it after 5 years at Queen's.   That being said, I don't think that anyone can in good conscience vote for Stephen Harper, or allow him to become Prime Minister. I believe that Canada's recent increasingly liberal attitudes, especially those towards gay marriage, are a positive change for the country. I believe that we should not being moving towards becoming more like the American government both in our tax system and in our medical system. Harper, from what I have read and understand, is a proponent of our neighbours to the south and wants this country to move closer to the United States. He would have sent our troops to the ill-conceived war in Iraq. He would in all  probability  endorse a two tier health care system and make bad decisions for this country. The economic plan concocted by his party makes no sense and does not add up.  I also cannot stand the man.   Now the Liberals are no saints. Their infighting, egos and nepotism prevented them from fully taking advantage of their years in office.   Well, they took advantage alright . . . . .   The Liberals were greedy, duplicitous, and prone to scandal. Who knows what they'll do in office again?   Where the hell does that leave us? I can't vote NDP. I would like to but it is my belief that voting for a candidate that has no chance of winning simply as a way of protest does not work. It is also my belief that people using this way of thinking and voting for Ralph Nader in the last U.S. presidential election helped to give the White House to the least effective president since Coolidge. I get the same goose bumps about Harper that I have about Bush Jr.   That being said, it is my hope that there is a minority Liberal government, with the balance of power being held by the NDP. That way Harper can be prevented from having his fingers all over the selection of Supreme Court Justices and re-opening the debate on a woman's right to choose, among other things. It is my belief and hope that a Liberal minority will be checked sufficiently by their low numbers in the House that there will not be a return to the scandal-plagued past. I am angry with the Liberals over the past few years of mis-management and corruption.   Who loses one billion dollars?    WHO?    HONESTLY?    What were they thinking?  When these scandals were uncovered all they gave the Canadian public in response were arrogant pathetic excuses. Their belief was, "Hey who ya gonna vote for? Two right wing parties? I think not plebian. Now go out there and give me four more years." I am not forgiving nor forgetting these past few years of Liberal waste and in-fighting.  In my little world I am voting Liberal to give them one last chance. I do not want someone in power that will act on an ideology that is alien to my own. The Liberals seem to be the only party that can  form the government , while remaining as close to the values that I find are important to this country.   God help them though if they pull their old crap again.       and for god's sake, go out and vote.    blargh  ajc

       It's been a few days   and so it's time to post.   Mix Tapes: Memos from your past   Since I have lost the use of the Subaru for the foreseeable future, I have been reduced to driving my parent's Honda during my days here. Now, it's not a bad car at all, it's just old and can't be driven anywhere outside of the city limits - running parallel with the fact that you can't take old people out of a nursing home: the outside world scares them so they get crotchety and refuse to do anything. Much like this car.  Anyway, as I had been blessed with a cd player in the 'Ru, I was unused to resorting to the radio, so I did what I only thought was logical: I listened to the CBC religiously. This wasn't any kind of romantic nationalistic sentiment, but merely the fact that I despise all other forms of popular music. I enjoy the CBC a lot, though it makes me feel that I've entered my Carlsberg years quite prematurely. Nonetheless, I made do with this sonic option until I stumbled across a motherlode of old mix tapes that I had made over three and four years ago. They have allowed me to rediscover many songs that I had forgotten. They have also allowed me to realize that I listened to a ton of depressing music. Half these tapes would make wonderful accompainments to funerals. I am so glad that I am much happier these days.     My new diversion   can be found  urlLink here .  I have just taken over as the GM of the Edmonton Oilers and my first task is to put together a roster from a dispersal draft that includes my team and 8 others. What are my preparations like? Well, as my Scottish friend Wee Kirsty has said to me "Andrew, when you become interested in something you gain an encyclopedic knowledge about it."  I have dived right in. I have a spreadsheet that is 3mbs in size. I keep going over it speculating how I can best grab players that would fit the mold of the team I trying to create, namely the three attributes of (a)young (b)fast and (c)cheap. I also have to figure out what my opponents will want and when they will draft these players . . .   But it keeps me off the streets and off the heroin    well, that's it for now, considering that I am posting from work. I've got more and I'll post it when I get the time   Oh yeah, I also turned 25 and wrote a song about it. One I'm actually proud of Wheeeeeeee!     blargh  ajc

       And I was listening to the CBC on my way home from work today:    Apparently there was a study done in Montreal where they concluded that teenagers living on the street have a higher mortality rate than those teenagers who are not.   Earth-frickin'- shattering. That sound you heard was the instant halt to all scientific research being done in the world as there's no more hope for the Nobel prize - it's going to these people for concluding what just about anyone with half a brain could have told you.    Now, I point this out not only to highlight the silliness of the research, but also to highlight my current mindset. I am cynical and bitter - at what? I have no idea. My hypothesis is that I am frustrated with the fact that I still live at home and that the job I work at is as far away from what I'd like to be doing as Pluto is from sustaining life.   In good news, I have begun dating my ex-girlfriend from Queen's, mining engineer Patti Newton. She came down to visit me over the Canada Day long weekend and we were somewhat surprised to find that there was still a spark left over from when we were once together. Now, the bad part about this whole situation is the fact that being a mining engineer, there are precious few jobs in Southern Ontario for that line of work. Where are the jobs? Why, in Sudbury of course, three and a half hours away. I am officially in a long distance relationship.  So far it has been pretty good, we were able to see each other two weeks ago when I went up to Sudbury for the weekend. It was the Sudbury Bluesfest and the town was entertained by the likes of Blue Rodeo, the Dears and the Tragically Hip. Patti and I had a really good time outside in the cold nights listening to some really kick ass music. As with almost all things in my life, I have no idea how long this will last, but right now I feel pretty good about it, so we'll see what happens.    In further good news, the world is being bombarded subtly with good music. You know that Sympatico commercial about the Olympics where everyone is doing the wave? Well, the music in the background is the song "Transatlanticism" by Death Cab for Cutie, one of my favourite bands. Now, this won't cause a sudden rush to buy Death Cab albums, but it gives me a pleasant surprise when the commerical comes on. In fact, when I first started this crazy little thing called a blog, I named it after a Death Cab song . . . . . . . . how original.  There's few feelings that can match hearing a piece of music out in public that you woouldn't normally. For example, I was away this weekend out at Patti's cottage in Bancroft and a few of us were scouring the stores in the town. In the middle of a very preppy and frilly athletic store (can althetic stores be preppy and frilly? When all of the clothes for sale are coloured in variations of sherbert you bet it can) I was surprised to hear a very obscure Ron Sexsmith song come over the in-house PA system. It made me smile to hear that song in a store where the clientele's average age was 13 and a half.    The Master Plan    Earlier I mentioned that, in general, I have no idea what the hell I'm doing from day to day, so I have developed this general guideline for the next year or so: 1)  Get a new, better paying job 2)  Import the wonder of a car that is my Subaru 3)  Move out of the house - preferably into a place around Dundas and Jane 4)  Work for a year until September 2005, saving for 5)  Apply to Hunber College's Radio Broadcasting one-year-with-co-op post grad program 6)  Finish program, find job that I'll enjoy (hopefully at the CBC)   thus is thus is thus  now it all has to come together    blargh   ajc
