BUT she also brought back two friends, one of which is staying in MY room.. so i have to sleep on the ugly brown couch. poop. have you realized that school is almost here? summer has gone by really quickly. i think. and for the school year, i've resolved to be 100% organized and to keep my room clean for the entire 9 months. ugh. i'll probably break the resolution in.. about a week. maybe not the organizing part, though. i'm gonna keep a planner thingamajiggy. what a good plan, ya? later :)

      hey ya'll..  my sister left to go to mexico yesterday. i kinda miss her already, even if she did owe me 15 dollars. :P i've resolved to never eat red meat again. errr.. is that an islamic thing or something? well, anyway, i'm just trying to be more healthy. i've even given up eating brownies! *sigh*.. my tennis instructor laughed when i asked him how to slim my thighs, but after i bugged him more, he said to try water exercises, like running and stuff. i can just imagine the looks people would give me when i start trying to run across the pool in polomares.. maybe it's worth it, though. i cant wait to go back to school shopping! i love buying pens.. i think that it's become an obsession. hey, all my friends that are away.. traveling, i miss you sooo much! except for jessica... j/p.. especially jessica! you're supposed to be here to tease me all the time! :(  weeeellll.. i think i'll end now.

         Okay. I'm finally starting up one of these things and I'm going to stick with it. I'm also going to proofread-look what Ms. Shoptaw has done. I tried a blogger, but that didn't really work. Owieeee.. Milo gave me this big scratch on my ring finger. What is that supposed to mean? I just found it, too. I have to type up this poopie Thanksgiving article for this poopie newsletter for my mother's work. Well, I guess it's my work too, because I'm getting paid for it. Yay. Money. I need lots of it for Christmas shopping. I'm still thinking of what to get people. I do it while I make my beautiful Christmas cards. Yes, I am making cards this year.. opposed to last year's Sanrio store bought funny-looking stationary. It's my way of getting into the holidays. If that's possible.. with all this sunny weather. But then again, my hands are pretty much frozen numb.. except for that scratch. That just hurts. There're also Christmas songs playing on the radio. Yes, I actually listen to them. I think everyone likes them deep down inside, but on the surface lies the "I hate Christmas carols! They are so annoying! I never get to listen to the music I like during the holidays!" Well. For all you Scrooges out there, I will be the first to say.. I love Christmas music. It gives me a warm fuzzy feeling inside (haha Ro). So yesh. That's what's going on now. Now I have to look at this thing on the actual site. Whew.

         Yesss.. I have really strange friends. We were trying to do this start the Secret Santa thing, and so we had everyone write down their "requested gift". Lindsay, Sonali, and Alysia said 'No clothes'.. perhaps they will all run around nekky when the grow up.. Then Ro was being all specific, like 'A long black and white scarf that is approximately two miles long, with one millimeter fringe on the sides, found at Banana Republic for $85.' Hmmm.. I won't even mention mine. Heh. heh. heh. (Hence my mood.) And then there was the whole "Don't tell!" thing. My goodness, who knew that gift giving would be such a hassle? Speaking of gift giving... I can't wait to go Christmas shopping! Yay!

        My. Goodness. Mrs. Cable cancelled our Great Mall trip. Can you believe that? Wow. What nerve. Actually, it was partly the school board's fault. We supposedly don't "meet requirements" to go on such a fieldtrip. I'm simmering. AND, thanks to her impeccable timing, I now have two tests to do tomorrow, whereas, if we had gone, I would have had none. What fun, ya?

       Wheee. I'm back from Las Vegas. I remember one day at school, Ro was like, wouldn't you like to do something bad? And I was like, what? And she was like, like smoking once or something. I was like, ick, no. Now I'd be like, ICK, NO! Oh my goodness- the amount of smoke there is unbearable. Half the time my shirt was over my mouth and nose, and the other time, my whole face was covered so I wouldn't have to see all the slutty people, or as my sister calls them, "ugly people". Now I'm in my seriouso laundry mode. Tomorrow I'm going with Choo for some last minute Christmas shopping at Stoneridge, and then later, we have some caroling to do. I hope I don't freeze over or anything. Hmph. There's so much to do.. but right now, I'm enjoying my own procrastination. Hannah said she might cut her hair... boo. I hope she doesn't. She has, like, the prettiest hair in the world. I can't even imagine her with shoulder length hair. Hmm... finished To Kill a Mockingbird today in the car on the way back. The other three hours I spent giving my other sister little braids all over.. kind of like cornrows.. but not. I did like, all her hair, and then when we got home, she took more than half of them out! Eek! Then, when I opened my screen, there was this advertisement that was like, What do Women Really Want for Christmas? And I was thinking, guys are so insensitive and stupid, they honestly don't seem to care. Weeeeell.. not all.  More text-y stuff for you.  sindyburnburn: she called lyke..a porno audition or something sindyburnburn: and they askedsindyburnburn: "are yoo over 18" "yes" "are yoo shaved?" "excuse me?" "are yoo shaved, becuz a fur pie doesn't sell" sindyburnburn: orr..something lyke that YooRmaIsUnsHynE: haha sindyburnburn: i have lyke..a bug bite on my head sindyburnburn: its weird YooRmaIsUnsHynE: oh dear.. i suppose itchy pies dont sell either sindyburnburn: i gues not

        I watched Chocolat until one last night, and then got up the earliest I have since vacation started to go to Christina's bowling party. It was pretty fun, but my hands were all grimy afterward, even after I washed them. Then, we went to pizza. You know what THAT means. The best part was when we were doing the competitions when we were bowling, because we were all doing these little individual feuds. Mine was with Christina, who kept beating me by one point! But during the last match, I beat her by, like, five or six. It was only because she kept getting gutter balls in the beginning. Gutter balls sounds like some mutated video game.

       I just watched The Sound of Music with my dad. It was pretty good... the last time I saw it, I was like, four. Maria... I forgot her real name, was really pretty, considering the way she looked when she acted in the Princess Diaries. I mean, I guess she's pretty for an old lady.. but she was a lot better looking when she was young.

        Okay. I haven't been posting for a while.. but a coupla things have been going on. Nothing really important, though. Yesterday I went to my piano lesson- the first one after break. And guess what! She was happy with me! She gave me the most compliments I think I've ever gotten from her. I was doing my Certificate of Merit pieces, and when I finished each one, she was like, watch out for dynamics.. make this part smoother, and little things like that, but oh well. She's always picky. Then, when I was done with the four pieces, she asked me which one I liked best, so I told her it was the Bach. She was like, "Oh yes, I believe you have the right touch for that one. Most people have trouble with Bach, but I guess because you like it so much, it sounds very good." I was like, smiling, and I smiled all through my next piece. Like an idiot.

        So. I had my little party yesterday, and it was.. okay, I guess. I was feeling kind of tired, and I think people could tell, but oh well. It was because I watched the Two Towers right before, and I have to think about movies like that after I watch them, and then Jesse came five minutes early, and my hair was wet, and I had to do it in my room.. ugh. The Two Towers was actually.. not as good as everyone said it was, I think. I thought the first one was better. The battle at Helm's Deep was pretty cool, though. A lot of it had changed since the book, especially compared to how accurate the first one was. But still, the whole Pictionary thing was fun, especially with all the obvious word-picture things. I must say, the "bum" thing was pretty awful. Baahhhh.. now I'm doing the December newsletter, and trying to come out with a whole new layout. It's taking up too much mindpower, and I can't concentrate on this. Later..

        My ujournal is wilting. I have neglected it for so long. Goodness, I'm sorry. Things have just been going on. Well, actually, I've once again become obsessed with taking online quizzes, so I take at least one everytime I start up the computer. It's Cissy's fault, mostly. We even take them at her house. It's pretty funny by yourself, but when you've got someone with you, there's, like, side-splitting laughter going on. Even her mom was saying we were being kind of loud. Oops.

        Whew! Chinese New Year today.. so many things happening at my house. Ujournal was down for a while, so I couldn't write, so it's not my fault. Bleah. Not that my life's that interesting anyway. Starting from the beginning. School Friday: Lots of trouble happening. Police. Weed. Car emblems. Felonies. I won't put in details, because I'm not even sure if what I heard was true. Anyway, yesterday night, I went to the concert at Redwood with Jessica. It was pretty good, and the Mongolian chanting thing was my favorite. Jessica kept pointing out things, and we would laugh over them quietly, and this woman with really weird hair kept on turning around and looking at us like we were juvenile delinquents or something. I mean, come on. If she had noticed the things we did, she would be laughing too. I think...

        Okay. Rested. So anyway. I went to San Ramon High School, which is in DANVILLE.. and they had, like, two classrooms for people not yet in highschool taking the SATs. There was like, this seven year old boy taking it! Alright, I'm exaggerating, but he was maybe.. 5th or 6th grade. My goodness... I bet he got a better score than me, too. Oh boy.

        Whew. My feet are dirty. I stayed at Jess's for like, four hours, and we did.. basically nothing. We practiced and recorded our quartet, minus Jane, who left her music in her music folder that was in her cello case that was in the orchestra room that was at school. So we just kind of.. played through it a couple of times. So anyway, both Jane and Arom left, and I didn't want to leave, so we went out to walk with Choco in a library bag to the bottom of Mt. Lassen, where "my house" is supposed to be. I was wearing flip flops, so that's why my feet are dirty. So anyway, when we were walking down, Jessica saw this car, and was like, "Hey Madrianne, look at that weird car." Oh, my goodness. It was a Hummer! After eating her out about how it was probably the awesome-est car in the world, and not weird at all, we took a peek through the tinted windows. It was really, really, really nice. That wasn't all, though. The house was like, not that big, but the yard was really well-furnished, and there was a new Mercedes on the side of the driveway, and an antiqued Impala (she was like, "Hey Madrianne, look at that old car.") next to the Hummer. And then, we saw this dog in their backyard which, as far as we could see beyond the fence, was perfect, and she was like, "Hey Madrianne, look at that cute dog." Then, when we were looking at the dog, four more of the same breed came to the fence! We just stood there for a while in shock, watching them wag their tails at us. Then, when we could stand the wealthiness of the people living there (whom we didn't even see), we huffed and puffed back up. Choco stayed calm the whole time. Jessica and I did not. We were too busy trying to deal with our seething jealousy. Just kidding. We were just a little disgruntled. I haven't updated in a while, so I'll write little summaries of events. Yesh, yesh.Tuesday: -Bounced around with Cissy at her house and made really yummilicious drinks. Mixed by me, by the way. Recipe- 1/4 cup of Tropical Fruit nectar, 1/4 cup of Aloe Farm, and 1/2 cup of Coke. If it looks a pukey brown color, good. It's pretty disgusting-looking, but once you get over it, it's pretty tasty!Wednesday: -Practice, practice, practice and Ro's house. We were pretty rusty at first, but soon, we were getting into it. We weren't together, so we got into this yelling-out-every-five-measures thing, which was hilarious, one, because you had to yell it really, really loud to hear it above the music, and two, because Jane was eating all this candy, and when she yelled out "Ten!", this plum one went flying out of her mouth, and Jessica practically collapsed laughing. We all were pretty much rolling around on the floor. Then, to make it even worse, I really had to pee, because laughing just makes me pee. I burst into the bathroom, but little did I know, Richard, Ro's brother, had come home from school, and was apparently in the bathroom. So there I was, gasping for air, stomach muscles clenched, and shaking uncontrollably from laughing, running in on one of my best friend's brothers in the bathroom. Oh boy. There's more. Jane went home, and Jessica, Ro, and I were left, so we ate half a gallon of banana ice cream and went outside to play with our shadows, during which Jessica told farting stories. Good times.-Piano teacher was upset because I missed seven problems on my theory test, when I could have missed, like, twenty-five and passed. Thursday: -Listened to Anna, Chen, and Jane act out part of their court trial while helping Mr. S. It was really funny, especially as the victim acted as the judge, also, because there were only three people. Guess who was overruled all the time?-Had our own trial in 5°. Michael, one of our defending attorneys, was absent, so Alan, who was actually on the jury, came to help Grant, and ended up winning the case for us. It was pretty weird, because Alan did all the talking, and planned the whole case in about twenty minutes, while Grant sat. Interview went pretty okay. I got crossed examined by Kat, who asked idiotic questions. At the end, we found out that all of the jury had voted against us, except for one person, who convinced all of them that we should have won, and so we did. Friday:- Made a sad attempt to practice with the quartet, which ended up being a duet, because, as I said, Jane left her music at school, and Jessica went out to dinner. So Ro and I just messed around. She ended up spewing food three times (I counted) from laughing so hard. Bleah. She does that at least once every time she comes over. We have resolved to go to the Smoothie and Expresso place. Good stuff.

         urlLink http://theorlandobloomfiles.com/pictures/fellowshipscreencaps/specialedition/fotrspecfeatures37.jpg  I guess it'll never end! Today we worked on our mock trial in Giles. My name is Turd Furgeson (courtesy of Grant) and I witnessed a dark figure influencing Wayne Thompson when I was fishing with my friend.. um.. Whatshisface. Something Weed, or something. I don't think this is going to go well.Picture taking for music classes today. We spent about half an hour waiting for other groups to take their pictures, and then another half an hour to set up. Mrs. Cable spent about twenty minutes of that half-hour trying to get everyone's violins to look exactly the same way, and then the photographer adjusted a little in the middle, and guess what. Everyone moved their violins. It was rather funny. Shopping was.. fun. It passed really quickly. Of course, Jodi kept us amused the whole time.. "I dont' know if I should be buying the shirt! I mean, do I really want it? Do I really, really want it? What about the American Idol one? And then what about the Chicago soundtrack? I can't wait a whole DAY to get it!" Then there was the whole Chen drawing on her hand with eye makeup.. and Cynthia reading her Manga throughout the mall, WITHOUT looking up, and Cissy's obsession with pins. By the time we went home, I think we were all exhausted. Practiced Telemann Concerto today, during lunch. It sounds okay. Better than the other one, anyway. I think this one is easier, or more melodic or something. We had an audience of.. two people. Wow, I know. They liked it. Note to my sister [the nerdy one]: You really are a nerd. You were a semi-nerd, before, but now you've got the smarts to prove it. Ha. I wasn't really complimenting you. *dances away (nimbly) before she brings Gareth and Bill to pound me* You can see my extreme nerdy sister here...  urlLink http://www.ofoto.com/Slideshow2.jsp?UV=312520146936_17118467703&collid=88363184703&amp;photoid=20046215703&refreshkey=1044424225245&amp;state=  and here  urlLink http://www.ofoto.com/Slideshow2.jsp?UV=312520146936_17118467703&collid=88363184703&amp;photoid=80046215703&refreshkey=1044424225245&amp;state=  and here  urlLink http://www.ofoto.com/Slideshow2.jsp?UV=312520146936_17118467703&collid=88363184703&amp;photoid=39936215703&refreshkey=1044424225245&amp;state=  Okay, so what if she's better looking than me? She's still a nerd. And I'm a Turd. Heh. heh. heh. Sorry, dears, no quizzes today. I didn't have time to take them. Off to shower, and remove the pungent stink from myself.

She gets to reuse her Christmas present. Sad, I know. Nothing much happening. We're going to Disneyland fo' sho' now. Or fo' shizzle, my nizzle, according to Derek. I can't wait. We're to go in May, but we've started a fundraiser, kind of sort of. We had to give our brochure things back because they weren't approved, and we're selling Otis Spunkmeyer cookies at the moment for regular school. I guess they didn't want so many monies (moan-eez) going everywhere at once at one time. Chris Chien's birthday today- Jessica was intent on singing Happy Birthday to him, but I stopped the madness. Chapter test in Giles.. it wasn't hard. Played Speed with Jessica afterwards.. I win! I always win! Yeah. As I said, nothing much happening. Bounced around at Cissy's house some more. Mixed more drinks. Went pee, like, twelve times since then. Good stuff.Coming soon: Lindsay may be starting a super-duper journal/blogger/diary too. Is this a trend, or what?

        Alright dears, I'm sorry for the delay! A lot of things have been happening.. Starting with the happy news, today for CMEA, Jane, Ro, Jessica and I got a command performance! The sad thing was, we had been working on this piece for a million years, and this part that we had been getting right forever went all wrong this morning, right before we played. My entrance was being all splotched up, except when I counted out loud, and I was panicking, so when we played in front of the judge, I was shaking (visibly, I'm sure) but then, when my entrance came. I counted really, really loudly in my head, and it came out right! It was.. just really great. I bought a sorry little pin afterwards, and I think it's hideous, but to remember the moments.. I guess it's worth it. Here's a little poem of congratulations from my sister! little foong, you are cool

        Today, my dad sneezed really loud, and although I was in another room, I practically jumped out of my skin. It was scary. And then, at my violin lesson, I told my teacher that playing my piece in the Romantic style was hard, and he told me not to worry. He then went on to say that he thought I was romantic. I snorted and laughed at the same time, and snot kind of shot out of my nose and dripped there. Very, very romantic. I don't think he noticed, though, because he turned around to pick up my notebook, so I wiped it away quickly with the back of my sleeve. Woohoo, the romanic side of me had popped out again. But it's a good thing the snot didn't kind of leak out to where I couldn't feel it, but where other people could see it, because Joe Lee walked in for his lesson, and I was feeling all self-concious about my snot, because he thinks I'm a weirdo as it is, which I guess I am, but oh well. Wow, that was a really awful run-on sentence. Anyway, here's another little poem by my sister.

        Hoo Jeez. Went to take studio pictures today. The guy who took the pictures was really nice. At least I thought so. Jessica had her own opinions, however.. The whole thing was a lot of fun, with Jane blurting out ever five minutes, "Wow, I can't wait to see how beautiful I look in these pictures! I'm going to look so GOOD, Jessica!" and Jessica going, "Oh my gosh, these pictures are going to turn out so bad. I just know they are." and Ro saying, "I wasn't ready for that picture! Do you think my cheeks are too big?" I decided to make it all better by running around and telling Jessica that "I felt so nekkid". Then we went to Newpark and walked around a little while, found out that there were two Claire's there, and I bought a thumb ring. Then we went to American Eagle and a couple of other places. We went back to Excel, picked our pictures, which actually looked pretty good (except for the ones where Ro made me laugh.. heh.), and listened to Jane squeal about how great she looked. Then the rest of it breezed by, and we went to Kumon. Came home afterwards and ate fish and snap peas, but I couldn't taste any of it, due to my new sickness, which Ro classifies as Sars. I, however, think it's just a cold, or hay fever. I made the volleyball team, by the way. Ends up that I'm not the only one that's scared of Eric. I guess "intimidated" is more the word, but that sounds like we're going to battle with him or something. Anyway, I'm looking forward to practices. And games. We filled in all our classes for next year, and I'm checking into clubs and stuff. Whooooeeeeeee.. I have to go work on my I-Search project.

        Oh man. We lost really badly to Creekside in our first volleyball game today. It was really hard to think with everyone yelling all there is to remember on the court at once and trying to pick out which one is meant for you, and then there was Eric, who was getting really upset, and all these other things to think about (like how odd/nasty you really look with too-too-tight spandex shorts on). We also bought another car...   urlLink  http://www.toyota.com/html/shop/vehicles/camry/    It's that one right on that first page. It's the same color and everything. I picked the color, against my mother's choice of this green-black metallic that reminded me of like, duck poop or something. Now we have three Camrys. How silly. Anyway, Star Testing began today, and that was pretty easy, if you don't count repressing the urge to run away while Anna complains twelve times about how she thought that "couplets" in poetry meant groups of four.. Anyway, I-search is coming along, and things are nearing.. my cheh's graduation in North Carolina, where I get to rub Choo's not-so-shaved-anymore head, Disneyland(!!!), graduation and such, and then a nice, long summer. Yippee... Oh, and by the way, check out   urlLink  http://www.zefrank.com/    Look at his instructional/educational videos.. especially "The Predate Confidence Builder" and "How to Act Convincingly". It's funny.

        Okay, there's a couple of things to talk about today. First of all, tomorrow, I'm taking a trip to North Carolina to attend my sister's graduation. We're also going to "celebrate Mother's Day as a family together once again", as my mom says. She's kind of weird. Also, we were supposed to play the School of the Deaf today, but apparently, the game was cancelled without our knowledge of it, and we all trooped there and stood in the wind like a little red-shirted group of lost sheep. My goodness, that sounded really weird. Anyway, I was dumping Milo's litter pan today, so it would be clean before we leave, and I looked around the corner when I was going down the stairs, and there's this huge mosquito hawk on the carpet! Those things are really freaky. They're those really creepy ten-times-bigger-than-regular-mosquitoes-which-are-already-kind-of-creepy mosquitoes. I didn't know what to do with it, and I wasn't sure whether it was alive or not, so I blew it a couple of times, but really gently because I didn't want it to fly up and around. That would be scary. Speaking of gentle, Kristyn says that I should stop being so gentle. Yuck, I just used that word twice in the same sentence. I don't know how to write it otherwise. there'll just be a lot of weird grammatical errors in the entry. Oh, and speaking of Kristyn, me, Jodi, Hannah, Kristyn, and Caroline were in Caroline's car, but it's not a van, so four of us were squishing in the back, and then on the way back, there was a cop right behind us, so Caroline was trying to pretend there were only three people in the back, so she leaned over , and her head didn't fit anywhere, so she stuck them between my legs. It was really uncomfortable, so I told her to put her head back up when we passed the police, so then she did, but she was being all sleepy and was like, face-down on Kristyn and my thighs, and so Kristyn was doing her I-love-to-mess-people's-hair-up rubbing thing, and so Caroline put her head back between my legs for the rest of the trip. And she was tickling my knees the whole time, so I was like jerking around and trying not to laugh, so I let out these little explosions of air once in a while. Yeesh. Anyway, I have to continue packing...

        Wow, I haven't updated in a long time. I mean a looooong time. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Especially to Nick and Lindsay, who actually bugged me about it. Ujournal even updated their site-- now there are these little ads at the bottom of the page. They used to be an independent site. I guess I'll have to put in an overview about these past few.. umm, months? Disneyland: The best thing ever in orchestra. We weren't expecting to go, since we couldn't even go to the mall, but hey, I guess Mrs. Cable pulled it off. It was worth everything we missed at school, and more. Oh man, the places we went! And then, we, the orchestra that everyone almost dropped out of, won first place out of everyone, and received an invitation to Chicago! During the awards ceremony, we were going crazy, and cheering at the top of our lungs. Before the awards ceremony, Jessica, Jane, Ro, Jessie, and Rebecca and I were in a group for Disneyland. Well, at first, it was Jane, Jessica, Ro and me, but then Jessie and Rebecca joined in. We went on Indiana Jones first, and scurried around getting fast passes and candy (for Jane) after that. At the half-point check in, we found out that we could go to California Adventure, so after more scurrying and taking pictures (coming soon), we headed over there. We went on the water ride two or three times in a row, and had tons of fun in A Bug's Land. All of us got soaking wet to the skin in the kiddie water play thing, and took pictures with Flik (coming soon). Then, we went in the virtual plane "California" thing, and Ro lost her glasses. Uh-oh. We looked, but couldn't find them, and finally just decided to go on. I made some yummy-licious strawberry water stuff, that only I found, well, yummy-licious. Jessica said it looked like barf. Then, After the awards ceremony, this freaky guy asked me out. I was like.. umm... no. We got back on the buses, but some people were missing! They had gotten lost in Disneyland after the awards ceremony, and we had to wait about an hour for them. During that time, we were bouncing around, all hyped up from the ceremony. Some people fell asleep, though, and I couldn't stop laughing at one person, who I'll leave anonymous. He was hilarious, because the whole time he was making little snorty noises with his nose while he was sleeping, and every once in a while there would be a bubbly hiss. He was in the back, with us, though, so then only Jessica and I were cracking up, and everyone else was looking at us. Well, actually me, because I was practically having a heart-attack. I took a picture of Nathaniel sleeping (coming soon), and other people were makinf fun of him, too, because David Zvarich had put my Medieval Times hat on him, and he still didn't wake up. That was pretty funny, too. I hung around with Flora, April, Lindsay, and Beth until the lost people came back, and then we headed back to sleep some. It was freezing, though, and I had taken off my shoes because my feet were still soaking and becoming all wrinkly, so I had some frozen feet and couldn't sleep much. I forgot to put in anything about the Medieval Times, which was fun, I guess, but kind of loud. And I couldn't concentrate on the fun parts, because I was too busy looking at the horses, which were being twitchy when they were poking them with their little twine-on-a-wire-to-make-you-do-what-I-want-you-to wands. That's just about all the good things that happened there. Back to School: Then, when we came back to school, we were loaded down with all kinds of work. Worst of all, none of us had done any I-Search work, so we had to finish up our projects in way less time than everyone else. Then, I had the Giles project. Jessica and I each sowed a flag. I did Confederate, and she did Union. I finished a while before her, but hers turned out way better. I just gave it to Ro, who wanted to wear it around her waist, to show it off. I laughed, and told her that she would not be appreciated if she did that in public. Then, in Lefkowitz, Jesse and I did our astrology Power Point. I chose to do Uranus (Yoor-uh-nus), and we had to present. Mr. Lefkowitz said we had the best color scheme. Yay. We had our Geometry final, and we started out in Mr. Hierro's room, and it was really noisy, because at the same time, the locker cleanout was going on. If you've had Mr. Hierro, you'd know that his room is practically padded with lockers, and there were all these seventh grade freaks screaming up and down the halls. Then, we were transfered to the library, and people would come in there speaking in a normal voice, and Ms. Saldinger would come bursting out of her office, yelling at them to keep their voices down, because "There are students taking a Geometry final in here." I will finish this later, because my dad is watching The Fellowship of the Ring and eating mango, and he's calling me. Teehee.. I'll be back soon, my pretties!

        Ohhhhh, my. Paul Walker is unbelievably good looking. Okay, so we went to Cissy's party, yesterday, right? The whole time in the car, I was thinking that I didn't really want to see 2 Fast 2 Furious, because it just didn't seem like a movie I'd like. Well, actually, in the car, we were talking about all kinds of things, like scars and Barbies and falling in the bathtub, and we were squishing four people in the back (that always seems to happen in cars that I'm in...), and we kept passing these cops. I think we passed three that had already pulled over people, one that pulled someone over as we passed, and a few waiting to pull people over. It was fun, but poor Talli had to sit on the floor. Meanwhile, we all were laughing and poking Jieun's "slab of poo". It was pretty gross. So we got to the place, and we were buying all our tickets and stuff, and waiting outside, and then everyone arrives at various times, so we go into Fuddruckers. I ordered a cheesy mushroom burger, and Alysia, Ro, Jane, Jessica, Elaine and I sat next to the window. Yum. Then we had a little while before the movie, and we walked around and got dessert and stuff. Then we headed into the movie, and there was the big poster for Pirates of the Carribean, with Orlando Bloom right in the middle. His head was practically the size of my body, and I was like, whoa, but he didn't look as hot as he did when I first saw him, which was in The Fellowship of the Ring. Okay, back to my point. 2 Fast 2 Furious started about seven minutes after we got into the theater, and it started off with this racing scene. The thing about the movie is that it really pumps you up. It kind of gives you an adrenaline rush, just watching the people race. Then Paul Walker comes in, but I had no idea he was Paul Walker, because I hadn't seen The Fast and the Furious, and I'd only heard his name thrown around a bit. So I'm practically jumping on Ro, who was sitting next to me, and trying to tell her how hot that guy on the screen was (sneakers and all) over the noise of the revving engines. She heard me, and was like, "Duhhh, you weirdo." And that subdued me for a while. I just couldn't stop looking at his face though. He's so amazing! I couldnt' believe he spoke Spanish. I guess that'll be my inspiration for my Spanish elective next year... Anyway, back to reality, summer PE began today, and it's a lot easier than I thought. All we do is bowl for practically the whole period. Then we have a half-hour break, and run, and if there's leftover time, we play softball or something. I have Treglown, who has really skinny legs. He can yell pretty loudly too. The only bad thing is all the construction is going on at the highschool, and it's really stinky. Well, I still have to go to Kumon, and tomorrow, I'm going to a party at Ulka's house. Like amovie-marathon or something.  urlLink http://www.angelfire.com/stars2/WeLovePaulWalker/  Just so the oblivious, like I was, know who Paul Walker is. Hey, I didn't find out until yesterday.  urlLink http://www.angelfire.com/stars2/WeLovePaulWalker/gallery/cosmog.jpg  Cissy: Sizzle, sizzle.

        Okay, and update on my summer life. I'm starting summer school on Friday. I turned in my application for Sulphur Creek volunteering on Tuesday, and my physical checkup form for volleyball tryouts. There's an open gym on June 24, from 6:00-8:00 pm, if anyone wants to go. Jenny Lin began, if I didn't mention that previously. In Shipbuilders, we started our summer Metamorphosis project, and are having a little graduation party at 6:30 on the 27th. Kumon is still going on, and Mrs. Choi wants me to participate in a math competition (yuck.). That's on July 13th. Piano lessons resume on June 25, and I have to get ready for my violin recital, which is also coming up. There's also convention, but I already mentioned that. I'm looking out for a Latin tutor, and maybe a dance class. Discipleship is also going on every Sunday. Ummmm... I think there are a couple missing things. I'm starting to lose track of them. If I remember any more, I'll post them later on. Right now I'm going to head over to Cissy's house, and then a big group of us is going to go to Fuddruckers and then to see 2 Fast 2 Furious. The movie was not my decision. I'd rather see Finding Nemo over again...

        Awww, Ro sent me a comment. hi this is ro, but i didn't kno how to say my name without using the ujournal user thingymabobber. well ne way..great work on your journal entries, they're..really starting to grow on me *wipes tear* see you at jenny lin my sweet. muaz Okay, back to my overviews. They're actually longer than I expected them to be. Anyway, here I go. End of School: So now we're officially "freshies", I guess. It's kind of scary, considering it seems like just yesterday we were just coming to Canyon, and I got maggots in my locker, and we had to Tolkien and all that. So anyway, our advancement was scheduled on the coldest day ever, and all the girls were sitting there freezing their shoulders off because almost all of them were wearing strappy dresses. The superintendent made a really dumb speech about an eagle and and egg or something or other. It was so dumb, I can't really remember it. Then the awards were given out, and stuff, and by the time the Lindsay Forte was done speaking, and my feet were thoroughly frozen, we had to go up to get our Certificate of Advancement(s). The whole affair was rather boring. The most interesting part, I think, was Ms. Shoptaw's singing the National anthem. Oh yeah, and there was the whole thing with Mr. Lefkowitz. He was cutting all the other speakers off when he was saying their names. It was kind of bad, but made the ceremony more bearable, in a way. Well that was the boring part. Before that, we had a concert, and about a million people got the Outstanding Orchestra award thing. Me included. And then there was Great America, which was lots of fun. Jessica, Jane, Flora, Christina and I were together, and we kept running into Yongsoo, for some reason. We persuaded Flora to go on all kinds of rides-- we were with her when she rode her first roller coaster! Yay Flora! Then, on the water ride, I met this guy named Jeff who was really hot. I mean, really hot. Even Flora, who likes her Asian guys, thought he was good-looking. He was. We went twice, and the first time, he was in front of us, and then the second time, I was right next to him. Unfortunately, I got this unsinkable urge to pee, and I was worried I was going to leak during the drop. Fortunately, Jessica helped me through it, and then we ran up to the bridge thing, and both got hit by this wave. We had expected it to be a mist, or at the most a shower, but the water just came up and slapped us. She was wearing a white shirt, so I was trying to make her a toga out of Flora's towel, and then this stampede of guys came, and we were laughing so hard, I almost peed my pants, but no one would have known, because I was already dripping. Christina popped up, after her little ride, and she got all wet too. She was wearing all white, though, so I just kind of walked in front of both of them with my arms outspread, like a giant starfish. Then, Christina, Flora and Jane ran off, and Jessica and I went to Drop Zone. We were both kind of nervous, and to make it worse, we were bumped off by some handicapped people, so we had to wait and watch two groups get off with their hair all fluffed out. But it was a lot of fun. More fun than we expected, after we watched Tsion wobble off, looking really frazzled. Tons of fun. I would have done it again, and I think we're supposed to get together to go again before summer's over. Yay! On the last day of school, before the advancement, it was kind of sad, but I didn't cry that much until after school. Jodi, Ro and I hung around afterwards, in Mr. Maidlow's room, to "help" him. We just wanted to stay, though. I went to the track to empty out his little sand bin, and watched Mr. Croghan's class launch their water balloons. It was kind of sad to witness them doing what we had done a year ago, and just remember all the fun we had. It's like things are coming to an end. April's leaving, and Becca's leaving, and Ally's leaving... And Cissy's really leaving. I guess all good things have to come to an end. What makes me really sad is that I didn't really care for it while it lasted. It was kind of a chore to come to school and wave to people and open my horrible locker ("My locker"), but now I'm going to miss it. Okay, there's my saddest moment in my whole Ujournal. I think. Well, on a happier note, I watched Rat Race yesterday. It was kind of funny. It was also kind of stupid, but I think a lot of people overlooked the stupidity and only told me about the funny parts, so I was expecting a lot more than I saw. I think that guy and that girl looked really cute together... the innocent guy and the helicopter pilot. I can't remember their names. Jenny Lin also started. I liked it better last year, and there were a lot more people, but it's still wonderful. It feels good to be playing in an orchestra over the summer. Oh, and I have a violin recital coming up. I was also accepted for convention, for Certificate of Merit, so I have to go to Santa Clara to play my Bach (Backkkkkhhh) on July 6. There's my musical life for you. It's one o'clock, and I think my dad is taking me running tomorrow, so I'll update on my summer plans next time. Oh, and here's something cute.  urlLink http://INSERT-YOUR-NAME-HERE.youaremyfriend.com/  Dont' click on that. You're not supposed to leave in the INSERT-YOUR-NAME-HERE. Well, I guess you could, but what I really meant was for you to really put your name in. First name, first and last name, whatever. It doesn't really matter.

       I got back from a Cross Country meet today. I mean, I was in it. Who would want to go to one of those things just to watch? It's got to be one of the most boring spectator sports. Actually, I don't think it would even be considered a spectator sport. Well, anyway, it's everyone's first meet, but Navenus and I haven't even gone to a proper practice, because we joined yesterday, when Brewer was rambling on about meet procedures. It ended up not being too bad, or so I think now, because there were a couple of times on the all-in-the-sun course that I thought I would either die of heat exhaustion, or wrinkle up into a human prune. There was a breeze, which was nice, but really unfortunate for me, because my contact popped out and blew away! I mean, it was a matter of like, two seconds. So I ran the thing without a right contact, and I'm going to have to wear glasses for a couple of weeks. I hope the people don't take to long in the making. Ugh, it's going to drive me nuts wearing glasses everywhere. And my contacts are $250.00 per little piece of glass, too. Geez, I hope my parents don't make me pay for the silly thing. School is... a bit boring. I haven't had a good laugh in the longest while. Laughter is essential in life. Maybe I'll just die. Not really, though. Homework isn't bad, classes aren't bad, nothing is really bad. But nothing is good, either. I haven't even found my best gay-guy friend. Boo. That may be a lost cause. I've got lots and lots of homework to do, not to mention a long, refreshing shower to take, so I will see you all later, my pretties.

       School is hard, and life is harder. Navenus and I got cut from the team, while this girl named Sarah made it, and everyone else knew she had never played volleyball before. It's a good thing we didn't break down and cry like some other girl who was sitting out on the benches. I'm thinking about joining cross country, just to keep in shape. Or to get in shape, whatever. I've had a whole weekend to get my life together and out of slight depression, and I think I've done it. I'm looking forward to tomorrow, ya'll. After all, in ten years, I won't care a bit that I didn't make the freshman volleyball team and Sarah did, because I had planned to quit playing sophomore year anyway. There'll be more opportunities to come. Come on you guys, these are the little things. Wait until we all have families, and more. Then we'll really know how to set our priorities straight. School has been okay, not the best, but not the worst. I had a pretty hectic first day, but so much for living in the past. Everything's rushing by, and I'm determined to make the best year I can. Tonight we're having a practice for our quartet. We're performing on the 14th in the Castro Valley Fall Festival in The Village. Hope to see you there. One last thing. I don't think I can keep this journal up, and I refuse to write a bunch of mumbo-jumbo with no punctuation or articulation whatsoever, so I might just have to end it, due to lack of time. This is a maybe. So don't bug me about when I'm going to write my next entry, because I really don't know. Sorry, everyone. Later days.

        Last night, I had a little pistachio-fest. I'm feeling kind of sick. But hey, I'm back. For today, that is. I'll try and sum up what's been going on in school and out in a couple of paragraphs, and from there, I'm not sure when I'll be able to update again. Okay, so here we go! First things first, happy birthday to my one and only Janiberry, and I do believe she did have one, thanks to someone special, plus all of us. Aaaand, on the same day, I found out I was getting an A- rather than a B+ in AFS, which was really nice, and it's only going to go up, because of extra credit Ms. Tierney hasn't put in the gradebook yet. Whew. As for my other grades, piece o' cake. I'm continuing to fall asleep in math, which isn't the best thing to do, as I sit dead center in the front, but I have Katie and Grant on either side of me, and Amanda in back to poke me awake. Not to mention Mr. Weston's unwavering gaze. I think he doesn't really mind, though, because I'm not failing or anything. Cross country is ending next week, but we're still continuing winter running, and I think I'll do that. I've got all these nasty things on my feet, and slashes on my right calf from my shoes. Jon Hui has the same shoes as me, and his calves are twice as big, but he didn't get and cuts. Meanwhile, my metabolism has sped straight up, and I'm taking two dumps a day. It's pretty weird. Oh, and I'll tell you a bit about Mt. SAC. We went to LA last weekend for "The biggest invitational in the world", or so the announcer informed us (more than fifteen times) at Mt. San Antonio College. We just happened to go while the Southern California fire was going on, and our hotel was 6 miles away from it. At night, we would poke our heads out the window and watch the hills burning up, and there was all this ash floating around. I took some pictures, but not that many. We watched continuous movies on the bus, and I slept through a couple of them. Our bus driver had major smoking issues, and Brewer got drunk in the little Italian restaurant we ate in. Apparently he does that every year... Then the Renowitzkys almost got in a fight. Thank goodness for Raoul. The hotel was okay, but there was only one elevator. I watched my first episode of ElimiDate, and some other stuff. People were sneaking around the hotel, and all that. I didn't realize how disciplined we were during last year's Disneyland trip until now. The race was hot and dusty, and it was majorly crowded. We placed third for our race, and that's that. A lot of things happened, but those are what stuck in my mind the most.  urlLink http://www.ofoto.com/ShareLandingSignin.jsp?Uc=cegxtsb.37rs6zwf&amp;Uy=-z3rmr4&Upost_signin=BrowsePhotos.jsp%3FshowSlide%3Dtrue&amp;Ux=1  I missed homecoming because of Mt. SAC, but I heard it wasn't that much fun. We got third, beating the sophomores, but I mean, they're the sophomores. I don't know how their class can be so unspirited. Okay, moving on. I went to a LEO club event a couple of days ago, and we were helping out with the Proctor Halloween Festival thing, and that was fun. I was helping inside one of those jump-house things, and it's really dark inside, I mean dark enough to not really recognize anyone or discern any features, and this little girl climbs up to where I am, and in an apparent desperation to stay inside, because they get kicked out after like five minutes, she's all, "Wow, you're pretty." And I was laughing inside, because she could have been talking to my foot for all I know. It's not like she could see my face anyway. I was like, "Thanks, you are too." Even though I couldn't see what she looked like at all. Then I told her to slide down and get out. Meanwhile, Jieun, who has a major crush on _ c_ t _ _ _ n _ , was flipping out because he was speaking more to me in the car than her. Heehee, what a silly girl. Sometimes I wonder if he'll figure it out anytime soon. I also have been going to all these Spanish events for my scavenger hunt. I don't really have enough time to talk about that stuff, especially as I've got pictures, so here.  urlLink http://www.ofoto.com/ShareLandingSignin.jsp?Uc=cegxtsb.buf84f9b&amp;Uy=-hesyh6&Upost_signin=BrowsePhotos.jsp%3FshowSlide%3Dtrue&amp;Ux=1  Umm... I'm getting loaded down with Kumon and piano theory and struggling to keep up with Mr. Rubin, my violin teacher, while he expects me to practice three hours a day for him. I think I'll manage, though. If I've forgotten something, I don't think it'll ever appear here, so oh well. I'll have more news next time. And I can only hope that it won't be so poorly written, with all these fragments thrown in. Until next time! For old times' sake, Later days.

        Hey, guess what. I actually had a solid A in AFS... I thought I was majorly borderline, but I have the second highest grade in the class! I hope second quarter is equally or less hard. Jieun, Navenus and I realized that we all bought the same pajamas from Costco... so we're going to be triplets tomorrow for practice. They're not the same colors, though. Mine are a puke-sea green. And we have to pick up trash for school spirit or something like that during lunch. Just great. And some guy at our school got in a fight during lunch, was punched, and is now in a coma. Wow. Biggest thing since homecoming, which I didn't even attend. Okay ladies, it's time to go do some Beryllium research, and it's really cold, so bundle up well. The good thing is we don't have to look at butts and boobs and who knows what else at school all the time now. The skanky girls have enough sense to put on a jacket, or at least a gauzy sweater, thank goodness. And, Jieun and I have made it official-- it feels like Christmas! Not only is the cold a nice change, festivity is in the air! We've been spreading the joy around during cross country, and even Brewer admitted that we made him feel happy. Speaking of Brewer, he was telling me that before a race, I need to unleash my inner animal and frighten away the opponents, or intimidate them, at least, and so I was wondering what my inner animal was. I asked him, and he thought for a little while, and finally came up with, "A duck." That sent Jieun, who was listening, into gales of laughter, and then he told her that hers was a gerbil. What a supportive coach. Sometimes I think he recruits people just to make fun of them. Okay, here it is; the news of the century: Cissy is coming back from China for a visit on December 12! Mark your calendars, we're going to have major fun every second she's back. Plus, she's got tons of shopping, eating, and white-guy oogling (ha, ha.) to do. We can't let her down... With that in mind, Later days!

        I've had a couple people ask me about my journal-- my temporarily obsolete journal, so I figured I should find some time to update it. Once again, I was amazed by the fact that people really do read these rambling, gramatically incorrect things. I know that if it were me, I'd have a hard time resisting the urge to grab a red sharpie and make corrections all over the screen. OF course, my father wouldn't be too happy about that one... School has been just dandy. Did I ever mention that I hated highschool? Well, I did, for a miserable period of my life, which was the first month and a half of being a freshman. I can't say that anymore, though. I'm enjoying most of my classes, clubs are fine, my locker hasn't jammed recently, and most amazing yet: I haven't been squashed against a wall during a passing period. It almost did happen once, though. I guess some people just don't see anyone smaller than them, and push their big butts right through the middle of the hall, sashaying and knocking people left and right with their giant backpacks filled with books and, no doubt, food to increase their already-gargantuan size. Bad news. I was boiling sweet beans so I could make bean drinks, and I was working on my science project (which is almost finished!), and I completely forgot about them. My feet started getting cold, or I finally realized that my toes were a little bluish, and so I went upstairs to grab my blue fuzzy slippers, and lo and behold! I smell something funny. Panic alarm went off in my brain. Holy cow! My sweet beans! I ran downstairs, hopping over a reclining Milo, and practically breaking my blue toes in the process (never jump down stairs without looking where you're going to land.), and open the pot. Ugh, my beans were black. What a waste of good beans. They were my last sweet beans, too, so I'll have to go buy some more. Upcoming events: The LEO installment dinner is at 8:00 pm tomorrow at Chevy's near Bayfair Mall. I'm thinking I'll go early and do some shopping before. Some people are going early to see Honey starring Jessica Alba, which looks like it might be an okay movie, but I think it's practically all guys going-- did I mention it's starring Jessica Alba? So I might poke around the mall for a bit... maybe with Tracy? Cross Country Awards Dinner is on Monday to 8th, and Jieun and I are going to make dessert for 40 people. What a feat. We've decided to make an assortment of err... delicacies, and put them on a large plate, hopefully with many garnishes to make it look appetizing. Or at least acceptable. Even edible will do. I'm looking forward to it, though. Making the stuff, that is. I don't really know about the awards thing. The last time I went was for Choo's senior year, and that was majorly boring. I fell asleep, right next to my plate of spaghetti. Thank goodness it wasn't in it. I've done that before. Hopefully it'll be more interesting now that I'll actually know what's going on. Winterball is on the 13th. The whole day has been planned out for me, by Jessica, Jane, Jodi and Ashley, Amanda, and Grant. I really don't think I've made a single decision for myself during these whole two weeks in preparation for it. Oh wait, I chose my dress. But that was it. First, Amanda persuades me to go with Lester, which I am, by the way, although he hasn't asked... whatever that means. Jane insists that I go, when I was thinking about having a peaceful night at home, Jessica doubly insists that I go with a date, no less, and Grant decides the rest of the night with his whole limo plan. Of course, I made a couple of decisions for other people, too. I asked Ed to go with Jessica, after her hees and haws of not wanting to find out that he said no, which he didn't. And I suggested that Sherman ask Talli, which I completely didn't mean to actually happen. But it did. Yeahh, I don't know what to make of that. So the couples I know so far, that I can think of anyway, are: Lester Mopas and Madrianne Wong Josh Mopas and Amanda Wu Grant Lim and Mariko Cavey Edward Chen and Jessica Shin Greg Hanabusa and Jodi Tam Tyler Ong and Jane Yi William Cho and Jane Kim William Chen and Christina Chao Eric Kim and Irene Hong Sherman Yang and Allison Lui Jon Hui and Jieun Choi Rolondo Lee and Steph Kong Elliot Hung and Anita Hegedus That's all I can name off the top of my head, but there are definitely more. This is going to be exciting. The musical opening night was tonight, actually, and it should be continuing on through next weekend. I think I'll attend one of the nights. It sounds like it should be fun. Plus, so many people put a whole lot of hard work and effort into it. Our science experiments are due on Thursday the 18th, and that's the day of our Winter Orchestra Concert, which is in the CVHS Cafetorium at 7:00 pm. Winter break begins on Monday the 22nd, and continues on through Friday the 2nd. Tracy's birthday is on Wednesda, the 31st, and Christina's birthday is on Friday the 2nd. My goodness, Christmas kind of snuck up on us all, there. I was feeling it a couple of months ago, but the feeling died out, and right now, it just feels wet and cold. No warm fuzzy feeling whatsoever. I'm sure it'll come back, though. Meanwhile, I really have to be getting back to church, and violin lessons. Not to mention piano theory and maybe Christmas shopping. There's a starter list for the next couple of weeks. I think those are going to be two of the most hectic weeks of school. In a good way, of course.

        Wow! Christmas is tomorrow! It no longer feels like it, though. That fuzzy feeling has been going on and off, much to my displeasure. Well, it ends up that caroling has been cancelled this year, or was never officially planned by anyone, so we're not going. Poop, I always looked forward to that, too. Instead, I stayed home and made banana squares, except with little ingredient twists by me. Before that, though, I went out to see The Return of the King. I found that kind of sad. Christmas Eve, and I go out and watch a movie in Century 25, and come out with a ridiculously stinky popcorn smell clinging to every inch of my body. What holiday cheer. The movie was very good, though. I must say, Sam had me teary eyed for parts, no, segments, of the film. However, yesterday, my sister informed me that Elijah Wood was gay, and was going out with Dominic Monaghan, no less. That definitely threw me off guard, and I couldn't stop thinking about it as they embraced when the fellowship met up again. I tried to take my mind off of it and savor the happiness of the scene, but it just wouldn't leave my mind. It's definitely a disturbance. And I'm sure, if this is new to you, you'd know exactly what I'm talking about. We're having people over at our house tomorrow, and I guess that's where my banana squares are going to, as a "Welcome, let's begin to stuff ourselves" dish, of which we have many more. From those, we're led to the appetizers, then the main dishes, filling drinks, and then belt-busting dessert. And I really mean belt-busting. There's going to be so much food, we could probably take out an eighth and feed a small family with it. It's a good thing a lot of people are coming... Yesterday, I went to Kumon for the first time in three months with street clothes on. I had always walked there after cross country, or "pre-track", now, and in my sweats or shorts. It's pretty gross, actually. Last time I came in soaking and shivering, and my head was dripping. I just tried my banana squares, and they taste good. On Monday, I went over to Christina's house for our little Christmas party thing, and we watched Pirates of the Carribean, which was pretty good. Then we did the gift exchange, and I watched everyone else play DDR. The end. There are pictures.  urlLink http://www.ofoto.com/ShareLandingSignin.jsp?Uc=cegxtsb.1nnemo1z&amp;Uy=-hlo7qs&Upost_signin=BrowsePhotos.jsp%3FshowSlide%3Dtrue&amp;Ux=1  Here are pictures from Winterball, if you missed them.  urlLink http://www.ofoto.com/ShareLandingSignin.jsp?Uc=cegxtsb.cawd1v3b&amp;Uy=-jb0rr2&Upost_signin=BrowsePhotos.jsp%3FshowSlide%3Dtrue&amp;Ux=1  Okay, so Winterball. It was definitely fun, even if we did get all split up. The girls, that is. I guess we just gave up on trying to stick together, since our dates were all pulling us in every direction and every restaurant. I ended up going to Macaroni Grill, with Lester, of course, as he was my date, Amanda, Josh, Liz, Eric, Grant, Mariko, and Logan. Okay, the night before Winterball, I decide nto to go to Shipbuilders because I know I have to wake up at 6:00 the next morning to get my hair done at Quanina's house. I read a little, set my alarm clock to 5:45, and go to sleep at 10:00. Alls well, until the phone rings and it's Quanina, asking where I am. I look at the clock, and lo and behold! It's 6:30. I must have turned the alarm off in my sleep. I run around, trying to pull on a bra and a shirt, when I realize that I have to wear a button up shirt so I don't muss my hair. I button myself up, then I realize that I have to wear the strapless bra I planned to wear to the dance so I don't muss my hair. I pull it on, button myself up, and off we go. I arrive at Quanina's house at 6:45, and her mom immediately combs out my hair, and begins twisting it up. It's done by 7:15. and my goodness, did I have a head full of bobby pins and saturated with hair finisher. I liked it, though. Not the hair finisher, the feeling of having nice looking hair. I call my dad to come pick me up, and glance at Quanina's CCS yearbooks for about 7 minutes until my dad shows up. I go home, and resist the urge to sleep so I don't muss my hair. Still wearing pajamas and a button up shirt, I toddle around the house with what seems like a giant cinnamon bun on top of my head, and finally my dad gets tired of me and tells me to go do chores. Feeling utterly silly, I clean out Milo's litter pan and throw out the trash with my head looking really nice and the rest of me looking, well, not so nice. I decide to start on my homework, and soon it's 1:00. I grab my dress, throw some make-up into a bag, and go to Jane's house. I'm the first to arrive, and I just sort of lounge around and eat a really big apple. Jodi and Ashley come in about an hour, Jane turns up the music, and the action begins. Jane and Jodi do a simultaneous hair-curling act, while Ashley and I get their back hairs for them (Ashley was a bit more successful with that), and then the make-up breaks out. It's done in no time, and we all glide down the stairs feeling quite a lot more beautiful than how we had come. Jane's mom takes a group picture, and we're officially done. There was actually more to it than that, but it would take to long to write about. Greg comes first, to pick Jodi up, and Jane, Ashley and I are left feeling a little lost. We talk about dinner and dates and limos (Ashley went in a stretch Hummer! I was so jealous.), and before I know it, Lester arrives. Jane's mom opens the door, and Mrs. Mopas pops out with a camera. I feel a little awkward, because it's not even my house in which Lester and I were taking the first of many, many pictures, but I smile anyway, maybe a bit in bewilderment. Then off we go. I really don't know what I would have done if I had gone with who I had wanted to go with, because I would have been so utterly nervous, I probably would have peed my pants. Err, dress. So anyway, I'm pretty at ease with Lester, and we pick up Amanda, then we arrive at school, meeting up with everyone else in our little limo group. More pictures, and a ton more pictures in the cafeteria, half of which I feel extremely silly during, and then we leave in the limo. The whole limo thing was pretty bleh, and not at all as glamorous as I had imagined, as it smelled like smoker's breath and there were two feet marks on the window (major turnoff). Then, the TV popped out right into the back of Eric's neck, and when we stop at the restaurant, the chauffeur immediately goes into repairman-mode and tries to fix it. There was a whole hullabaloo with the reservation thingies, but eventually we make it in, after about five of the following conversations: Hello, dear, may I ask what you're all dressed up for?(Like I could say no)

       We went to the San Francisco Conservatory of Flowers on January 4th. It was beautiful... my pictures do no jstice to the marvels of the plants there. But hey, you can take a look anyway, if you please. And a snowman made of pommelos popped int here too. And by the way, my birthday is tomorrow. Woohoo! Okay, nite boys and girls.

A long time equalling about three months, or even more. I've been avoiding the "online cravings" that have been calling. Come now, if you're a high school student, you know exactly what I'm talking about. Don't deny that you want to sign on to AOL IM every time the computer starts up. So there. I've successfully ignored the little yellow man for a very long time. You will probably see me(yoormaisunshyne) again once the summer starts and my life has calmed to a dull roar. Until then, I guess pictures will have to suffice, and no, I will not take any more interesting personality quizzes, tempting as they are, until I have the time. I promise more updates to happen as my schedule gains stability. Until then!

        Today was the first day of finals. It was pretty easy, the AFS final was not difficult, or at least not as difficult as I had expected, and orchestra, well, it was orchestra. We had a little "party". I think that's the only class where we're going to celebrate the end of the year. But Ms. Tierney did get a little soft on us and said how we were a nice class and all of that (none too sincerely) and gave us bags of her homemade chocolates, which Jieun and I agree are not quite homemade chocolates. I guess I'm going to miss that class, a bit. There really were some memorable moments in Room 714. Last night I stayed at Jieun's house until midnight studying for the unbelievably easy AFS final, and she, Lindsay and I spent almost two hours of that cooking and eating, and scraping onions off the floor (in my case, kicking onions around on the floor), and maybe about three more talking, laughing, and ultimately getting off subject. It was so much fun, we've agreed to hold multiple "study nights" over the summer where we will watch movies and eat flan, New Zealand pudding, and chocolate cake. The day before that, I went to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (opening night!) after school with Jieun, Pearl, Lindsay, Katie, Anita, Cynthia, and Caitlin. It was much better than the first two, and there were a couple of people that dressed up, so that was interesting. Oh, and I've never had to wait in a line like that to get into a movie before-- it was weird. Afterwards, we went to eat at Fuddruckers, where I was tempted to get an ostrich burger, but didn't. I went for turkey instead. Turkeys are kind of like little ostritches, right? Also, yesterday I had a piano recital where I was given a nice Certificate of Merit certificate (how redundant) and I left it on my chair. Hopefully my piano teacher will not eat it. There's still much to be done, especially math stuff, and my writing is not exactly sparkling with wit, so goodbye. Oh, and I forgot, another interesting tidbit: I have a live lobster in my refrigerator. I'm dead serious.

        Milo's gag reflexes got the better of him today-- I spent twenty minutes swiping up a foot of blue yarn (still intact) barf, meanwhile trying to rub away the crystallized salt on my face and collected around my nostrils. I went kayaking for the first time today, and it was very fun! I think my arm muscles may have grown slightly during the four hours at Half Moon Bay, but despite all the soaking-butt, water-up-my-sleeve, splashing-myself-in-the-face-with-my-own-paddle experiences, it was one of the best activities I've done so far this summer. Then, when I got home, I had crusted salt in my eyebrows, hairline, and in the depths of my earlobes. Attractive, isn't it? At first, Katie, who was steering in the back of our two-person kayak, and I were afraid of capsizing, but once we got the hang of paddling and all that in about four and a half minutes, we felt pretty secure. The only troubles we had were going through the dock pillars, because we got caught on a string and had to be untangled by our instructor, and during that time, Katie got attacked by a giant seaweed ball. Being in the front, I couldn't see what was going on, when all of a sudden she started screaming and laughing at the same time. Hoping she hadn't gone hysterical from all the trouble we were having steering while hooked to the string, I turned around, and she has all this slimy green seaweed in her lap. It took her nearly five minutes to get it all out, and meanwhile, I was laughing so hard, I was surprised that my fears of capsizing didn't come to life. More amusing for her, however, was when I managed to collect half the bay in my own lap, or in my "kayak skirt", which is the plastic covering for the hole you sit in so that no water comes in. When we paddled over to the beach for lunch, and I stood up, all the water either went up my stomach or down my pants, and I had a wet seat for the rest of the trip. Definitely fun, though-- I would encourage you to try it just once, and go with a good friend. That's all for today... I'll have more about previous stuff next time. Oh, and I would have pictures for you, but um... my camera.. well, it's not a great idea to take a digital camera along with you when you're kayaking, canoeing, boating, or doing anything where there's more than 10 mL of water. I'm going to need a new one... crap it all.

        I spent a day in San Francisco today, with the one and only lovely Madalyn. We walked along Market, and went into Sephora (where else?), as well as miss sixty (European skank shop), and Rite Aid. By that time, my tummy was a-rumblin', so we took the bus to Ocean Beach for some lunch.    Embarassing moment of the day: On the way to the beach, my bladder decided to fill up, and I had the most irresistable urge to pee. My cross country bladder took over, so we walked for ten minutes, looking for a bathroom, but there wasn't any to be found! Finally, she tells me to just pee in the tall brush that's surrounding the sidewalk-- it's in the middle of the sand and cement, so in an act of desperation, I go. Unfortunately, I'm not trained to pee in a straight line, and she kept making me laugh while squatting, so a leeetle bit was sent off into the grass. I hope it doens't die a painful death.   So we snacked on the dead crabs and rotting jellyfish strewn across the shore (actually, I brought mi sanwich de lechuga and garbanzo beans, and she had Triscuits), and walked around a bit. Then, after we had had enough sea spray, we got back on the bus and walked to the MoMA.   Excellent stuff at the MoMA SF. If you're planning on going, go now before the exhibits change. Unfortunately we didn't have that much time, because I had to hurry back for a piano lesson, but the most memorable: Sculpture of giant spiders. The largest was one and a half my height, and there were four or five slightly smaller ones clustered under its belly. Large forest room. The art was the walls, but there were some abstract and seemingly random things placed strategically around the room. Diego Rivera painting. The title had something about symbolism in it. Loved it. Black painting. A huge canvas with tarred-up newspaper thrown on, and glossed over with black. A little weird close up, but very effective. A huge pencil/charcoal drawing with so many different things in it. One of my favorites, too bad I don't remember the artist. A toilet. Put on display not because it was scuplted, but because it was "chosen" by a famous artist. Ha. Woman with fruits (or fruit hats or something like that). Matisse. The one you've seen everywhere. Okay, if you want more, pick my memory, but I suggest you go see it yourself. See them yourself. All of them. So after that, we ran to the BART station and back home, I fell asleep the whole way back, and then I went to my okay piano lesson. Wheeee.

        I am currently transferring all my Ujournal entries over, because Ujournal is being such a big fat butt right now. I'll consider myself a blogger from now on. I quite like the way Blogger has such simple settings and formats so that complete idiot such as myself can use them without getting completely flustered. We made four trips up to the new house today, each in the van loaded with boxes of Bathroom Stuff, Bedroom Stuff, Office Stuff, but most of all, Useless Stuff. I was entrusted/tortured with the task of throwing out the old shoes that no one wears anymore, so I spent a good half-hour rummaging through the old, disfigured shoes that a family of rats were using as their nest. Two garbage cans were filled with rat poop-filled tennies, sandals, and heels. I'm glad to say that we've made great progress. That's stated as I consume the last of the Spam at the very back of the cabinets and steal the rotten salad away from my sister for dinner. Just kidding. I wouldn't touch Spam unless I was starving, and we still have a reasonable amount of food in our fridge, as well as necessities around the house. But then again, the truth is, our refrigerator and cabinets are usually packed stiff with food, and we must have moved up five or six boxes labeled "Kitchen: Unpack me first" alone. Thank goodness our new house has a pantry, or else all the soy milk my mother stocked up on wouldn't fit. As for the rest of the moving, I would say it's going very well. My arms are thoroughly tired, and my back feels strengthened. I'll be living next to Stephanie Wong, and some Mexican guy on the other side. On Thursday, Lindsay, Jieun and I are finally getting together. I wish we could be all moved in, so they could come over to our house, but instead we're going to Jieun's. Movies I've recently watched: Fifty First Dates Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (again) How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days I hate Adam Sandler movies, in general, but Fifty First Dates was the best one I've seen yet, and I must say, it was pretty good. There was still some of the crude humor that seems to follow him around, but it was bearable, and at times funny, and the story was really catching. It was touching at times, endearing, and I woulnd't mind watching it again. The Return of the King, well, for the fifth time, it was still good. If you haven't watched this, go watch it, you dodohead. Actually, watch the first two and then this one. I'm thinking about having a Lord of the Rings-fest at my house, followed by a sleepover, for "Mr. S's lunchtime crew" minus Cissy (sniff), and maybe with some other people added in. It should happen once we move and settle in... How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days was cute. It wasn't great, especially for a chick flick, but I liked the plot ideas and Matthew McConaughey is just so good looking. Kate Hudson is really cute, too, but at times I got rather annoyed at her, although I knew that she was being purposefully clingy or overly-sensitive or whatever. A rainy day sort of movie.

        Okay, current times, now. My room is not quite finished, but soon will be, and the kitchen is done, I managed to uncover my piano books for my lesson tomorrow (although I haven't practiced at all... is there such thing as "cramming" for a piano lesson?), and my mother forbids us from going down the hill to vacuum the old house, as they are doing construction on the road, and she doesn't want us to... get hit over the head with a power drill? You know, safety precautions like that. Anyhow, I manage to fill up my drawers and part of the closet shelves. Yay!

        Okay, now this is one day in "the future", once again, thanks to the changeable little numbers down at the bottom of the Compose box. We go back down to the other house again, in an attempt to clean up the garage. Our goal is to get all the stuff sorted in piles: "To be donated to the library", "To be given to Salvation Army", and "To be kept". Of course, the "To be kept" pile should be very, very small. I should explain our little situation here, before I get any further.
