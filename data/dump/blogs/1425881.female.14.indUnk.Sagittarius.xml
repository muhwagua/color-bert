         helloziz!! XD i have to turn in a STUPID eulogy about Okonkwo's death (Things fall apart by chinua achebe) for school tomorrow. I HATE POETRY!! at the same time we are reading/studing about chineese culture and   the places in china, we are also doing POETRY in Language arts!! I HATE IT!! it's sooooo borring and stupid. Like i would wanna hear about sone glossed over full of shit view of manhatten the "best city in the world, W. W's city. BLAH!!   i am reading a new book. it is  the first in a series. the book is called The good earth by Pearl Buck. Note***Both The Good Earth, and Things Fall Apart are adult books***  The good earth is about a poor chineese man, who becomes wealthy with of his former slave wife. He becomes wealthy by working hard side by side with his wife then buying land from the very rich house of Hwang, who eventualy grows poor, because of the old woman's thirst for Opeium (i can't spell that), and her five young lord sons who don't know what "running out of money" means, who always buy expensive jewelry to please their young concubines. i'm only up to chapter 8, but it is really good!!   ***also note that i'm sorry if there are type-o's  =(  I gotta go work on my EULOGY of okonkwo's death Bye Bye :D

        I found some REALLY funny BUT TRUE Lawsuits  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  1. A construction worker in Tulsa intentionally cut his hand off with a circular saw. When he was taken to the emergency room, he told doctors not to reattach the hand, saying that it was possessed.  The man is now suing the doctors for not reattaching his hand, claiming that the doctors should have known he was psychotic.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  2. Dorothy Johnson sued Kenmore Inc. for the death of her dog.  After washing the poodle, she placed it in her Kenmore microwave, "just a few minutes, on low," to dry it off.  The case was dismissed.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  3. A Blue Cross-Blue Shield worker sued IBM, claiming that their keyboard's "faulty design" had caused pain in her hand that kept her from working.

         You have a Lost Soul. No one is really sure what that can always mean, because it can be defined in many ways. As Legend goes, lost souls were the spirits of passed away people who are neither in heaven nor hell. They walk the earth, brooding mysteriously, always appearing when you expect it least. So hence, if you have a Lost Soul, then you are probably very insecure and shy. Stuck in your own little box, you watch the world fly by as a loner. You dont know your place. You seemingly dont have a place in society or an interest. You are a very capricious person, and are confused and frustrated about where you belong. You crave for the sense and feeling of home-but have not obtained it yet.    urlLink   What Kind of SOUL do you posses?

XP she dissed AND desmissed John Christopher Depp the Third!! well Billy is uber smexy, BUT he wears TOO MUCH OLD SPICE even though that is THEE hottest fragrence for a guy to wear     *marina agrees and sez: OLDSPICE IS SMEXIER THAN AXE*!!      You have an angry soul! Angry Souls arent always angry, but they cannot easily forgive and hold grudges. You probably often get in fights with your friends and family, and its difficult for you to understand. When someone makes a mistake, you dont let go easily and hold on to those memories. Your very stubborn and your rage is known to everyone. Though you never actually mean it, you can say mean things in a fight and go over board. Many people are sometimes intimidated by your anger. But you have many redeeming qualities and those are that you are quite intelligent and smart. You would make a good businesswoman or lawyer because you know how to prove your point. You cherish the ones around you, and appreciate life, even though you can complain or throw a tantrum now and then. The good things is, you keep your emotions very outspoken, and are normally a very happy person because all your rage is let on the outside. Anger is simply a state, but you, yourself as a person, are great.    urlLink   What Kind of SOUL do you posses?

Your motto is: Its better to burn out than to fade away. You are extremely sensitive person, but dont want to show it in the outside world. May you even didnt realize it in the beginning. There has been a problem in your family and you dont get over it. Its lying like a shadow behind you and you cant see it, because you dont want to turn around. This depression runs after you but you are so long inside that you think you wont come out. You never thought about being popular but you get it because you are very talented .You are a genie, and can reach into the hearts of the people, but there is still this depression. Then you get these stomach problems and take drugs. They make your feelings even more extrem. After some time this satisfaction you felt for your music disappears. Your erratic mood  hasnt got the passion anymore . Then youll kill yourself with a gun, but youll still live in people minds and will forever.    urlLink   ~Which famous suicide would you be?+8 different,long results and pics!!~     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla       LOVING ONE. You need most safety in your relationship. You want to to feel sure in his/her arms, know that he will protect you and can be totally devoted to your other. At this point you are very vulnerable.

SO if you find out that she/he lied to you or played a game this trust is broken. You may try to forgive your other but this will be very difficult.He/She has to be friendly and you have to feel warmth from him/her coming out.

         You are a human shadow.  If a loved one needs you, you are always right at his or her heels! Your deep social connection with human beings produces your qualities of genuine caring and charisma.  However, at times you are naive to the true nature of your loved ones.  Remember that humans' gift of free will does not always lead them in wise directions.  But your essence of love and friendship represent the other precious gifts of humanity. Overall you are a strikingly valuable and innocent being who has a lot to give.(please rate my quiz cuz it took me for freaking ever to create)    urlLink   What Kind of Shadow Are You?

        I'm really happy i'm going to see maggie in a few days. finally summer bordom is going to end! but it's going to be better than reading the "required reading for summer". i have to read "the big mouthed and ugly girl" and 3 other books on the list -_- the high school is so amazingly fucked up! they put together my classes so that i didn't have a fucking math class *sigh* and they put gym as one of my classes, the nerve of them...i can't do PE if my life depended on it...it's not just that  don't like it and don't want to do it, it's that I CAN'T DO GYM! so my counselor tried to fix it and put me down for "IMP2" (which i wanted) and she said "oh your taking a lot of hard classes, are you sure you want that many?" (which BTW is honors world history, world literature, and spanish2) so i responded "well aren't the hard classes i'm taking manditory?, i mean i need math to do my SAT's" AND SHE RESPONDED "YES"! what a dumbass. so now according to her i can't do an elective because it won't fit in my class list if i take math, so now i have 1-2 periods of study hall each say, and i might not be able to take the manditory health class i had been placed in because there isn't enough room for me!..SAME WITH DANCE 1. i'll take prancing around a room on my tippy-toes with a bunch of stupid girls over PE any day!  i got my yearbook DVD yesterday...and I only look normal in 2 pictures, but at least i'm not in the section labeled "bloopers" ^_^ it also has everyone's baby pictures in it and our graduation ceremony. i wonder what happened to james?...his brother is sooo hott. he he.  The graduation party was over a week ago. before then reva (my in-school friend) was really nice. her mom works at the school, and she sometimes fills in for the secretary in her lunch break. i saw her yesterday and i was friends with her before, but all of a sudden she acted so cold to me, and i've done nothing. i'm really confused about that.  hmmn...anything elso to write...i'm swetting like a piggy right now in the 80* weather. i like it in the 60's better.r

       Today between 7th period and 8th period it started to pour heavy rain and a lot of people including many friends of mine got caught by Principal Fitzgerald and were put into "Lockdown" in the cafeteria on the first floor, HEY YOU KNOW WHAT?!

Go me! my math final is this Friday and my Latin final is next Monday, stupid teachers a hellish doom will befall their stupid heads ^_^ OK well today I was all "WOAH" because Evan came back to school! YAY! NOT! Evan is such a jerk *throws darts at picture of him* we are like the best of friends and he can't even have the decency to tell me what's wrong with him! He was moping all day and wouldn't even talk! Grr...I've tried calling him almost 7 times already and everytime I try to talk to him he either hangs up or says "Just go. I'll be fine." which usually means he WON'T be fine. GOD! why won't he just let me comfort him for whatever has happened sometimes he can be such a pain in my ass! ARGH! But I do hope whatever happened, I hope he'll be okay.

       story re done by marina:marina and eve walk out of tosconini's (an icecream parlor where it is said to be the best icecream in the world by the new york times)when they encounter a hobo who is over 6' tall and really dirty  and gross looking! when he stairs at marina and eve and proclaims "beautiful child". with that remark marina and eve turn around and he starts to sing "girls, girls, i like girls...girls, girls, i like girls" with that marina prepares to exclaim "back the fuck off and go find a dirty old smelly hobo woman in central square to do it with you" but marina refrains from saying that because her mom stops her (yes, her mom was there the whole time and was walking behind them)...so all of them walk quicly away.

       Well lets just say the Bell Bash wasn't peaches & cream...I mean getting the year books and having people sign my year book was fun and Saki being there was good too, but besides those two things EVERYTHING else sucked BAD. I wish Rei, Sara, and Kate were there! So much mischief and torment upon people we could've brought like a bloody hellfire! Now I have to go do some stupid sciency packet things! -_- stupid Mr. Liu thinks he's so cool with his power to weild homework upon us poor children :( I shall eat his filthy soul!!

       Well today I am bored which means i'm probably going to make sock puppets later, and I know how much I do lurve my sock puppets. BUT that's not the point I believe the REAL point is WHERE AM I TO GET SOCKS? O well it will be forever a mystery, so I guess I won't be making puppets of socks anytime soon *sadness fills my juicy soul* tomorrow I am going to Gedney Park it is a grande park where the Bell Bash will be! So therfore I'm going to be bored once again, but it shall be good b/c Saki and *i think* Sara will be there! ^_^ I don't know if Rei is going but if she is than i'll do a little dance, the only person I know of that ISN'T going is Kate *shakes fist* now we can't hand out our Fetridge Cult pins until Tuesday! *I Cry* man I feel like such a bitch today, o well it's probably b/c i am. *evil bitchy grin*
