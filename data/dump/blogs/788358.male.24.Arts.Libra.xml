      That's right folks... in true Harry Potter fashion I have transfigured into a large human-esq lobster... 5'11' and all... it's truly amazing.  In short... I have been crippled by the sun.  Ehren and I went to Pacific Beach today... really awesome place, though I made the mistake of using this dark tanning oil stuff and I just burned... as I always do.  So anyway... that's pretty much it on my front.  Tonight we enjoyed some cigars with Jorge on our last night here in San Diego.  I feel really sad to go though because he and his wife have both been so wonderful to us.  I'll have to make it a point of seeing them again once their baby is born... we'll see.  So anyway, I am tired and it kinda hurst to type because even my fingers are burned... so goodnight all.

      Wow.  We've spent three days here at my aunt's and it's been amazing.  We've gone and experienced the seediness that is Tijuana and the craziness at Pacific Beach.  We went surfing with my uncle Jorge and eaten like kings here at the house.  And it's been amazing, relaxing, and just incredible.  They've taken us in and seem to have enjoyed having us here as much as we've enjoyed staying... maybe even more so, if that's possible.  I haven't blogged much in the past few days because I've just been enveloped in being here, in experiencing it with every fiber of my being.  Blogging just didn't fit into that plan too well.  Now I'm back, and I'm sure Kinko's will assist in that regard.  I've rediscovered the wonders of Southern California while I've been here.  The natural beauty and the amazing climate are just perfect.  I am making mental plans to move here when I finish college in two years.  Anyone who is cool and wants in is most welcome.  I'll be damned if I know how I can recreate an artistic niche out here, but I bet I can make it happen.  Life is too short to not follow my dreams, and this is one of them.  Tomorrow, Dan and I set out north up the coast on the Pacific Coast Highway.  We're making a stop in Santa Monica to see some old friends of mine, Dan and Pete.  I'm looking forward to that.  I haven't seen them in at least a year, probably longer.  Then we make for San Francisco, camping up the coast.  The only place that I know of that I want to stop is Big Sur.  Other than that, the sky's the limit.  And we've already shown that lack of planning makes for an awesome trip.    So who knows what's going to happen?  Surely not me.  I can't wait.  San Diego has been the perfect stop after about 3300 miles on the road, and there are many more things ahead of us to enjoy.  Whether camping, hostelling, or crashing with newfound friends, the remainder of the trip is promising to be as good if not better than the first.    It's all about how I perceive it.  And right now, I can't imagine it being anything short of great.  For now, that will do.  Missing you all, but having the time of my life... I'm still  Ehren

      Well, the day started out as normal for us Californians....  surfing in the Pacific amidst stingrays and a beautiful San Diego morning.  Oh man... so much fun.  It was my first time surfing and I actually think I did pretty well considering.  Of course I was never able to really stand up on my board and ride a bodacious wave into the surf.  However, there was a couple of waves that I got and was able to ride on in on my knees.  It was really thrilling... totally exhilarating, especially that moment just before you catch a wave where you're paddling in front of it as hard as you can (really tiring work) and then suddenly you feel the wave pick you up and it just carries you all the way in.  So cool... I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a new experience... now that I'm a professional I'll have to take some of you out.    Anyway, we then had a quick breakfast and some showers and then it was off to Tijuana for the afternoon.  Now, the Tijuana experience was unlike anything I've ever encountered.  Ehren and I parked just about a mile away from the border on the US side and then walked over to Tijuana.  I tell you all honestly, I don't think I've ever been to a city that has presented itself with such thorough repugnance.  It was ridiculous, in every corner, every step down the street, there was a new person accosting me to come into his store.  Or it was some kid coming up to me trying to sell me some little trinket, it was thoroughly annoying.  And lest we forget that it was a total tourist trap... every little peddler that came up to me pushing his "unique" and "well-priced" store, was just another in a long chain of stores selling the same ridiculous crap.  I think at the end I was so fed up with it all that one guy came up to me saying, "Hey amigo, come on check out my store... I give you good prices."  And my reply was, "Oh sorry, I visited your other store down the street."  I know I was probably a little harsh... these guys are just trying to make a living, but man... they were obnoxious.  At one point Ehren and I got roped into going a bar by the guy out front telling us he would give us a free shot of his best tequila...(watered down Cuervo that is) or so we found out.  We went up four flights of stairs to this seedy bar at the top, and immediately were roped into buying two shit beers... albeit for only a buck each... which I can't argue with.  But the part that pissed me off was this guy who kept coming around and what he would do was wrench your head back between his arms and then hold you while he poured tequila down your throat, all the while blowing this whistle.  And then he would stop, slap on the head, and then take you and jiggle you around.  Fucking ridiculous.   And then, after he had done this to me... he would demand that I pay for the tequila... what the fuck!  Not only had he poured nasty tequila down my throat against my will and then asked us to pay for it, but I was promised free tequila...  We were totally ripped off.  Well, anyway, after this happened to both Ehren and I twice, and we had shelled out money for something we didn't want, we decided that we needed to leave before we were roped into spending any more money.  Totally Ridiculous.  So... my vote is a big thumbs down on Tijuana.  If you're 18 or 19 and can't drink in the states, and are stupid and haven't realized that you can get alcohol from pretty much anywhere you want just by asking your good 21 year old friends, then go down to Tijuana... you may slimly get your money's worth.  But otherwise... stay away... it's a toursit trap.  What pissed me off more was that I only went down there to get a couple of Cuban cigars to brink back to some friends, but all the cigar places we went, very nice places surprisingly, all the cigars were so overpriced that I wasn't able to pick up any.  Would you believe $29.00 dollars for a single cigar.  Ridiculous.  Anyway, enough of my tirade... tomorrow Ehren and I are hitting the beaches for another welcomed day of relaxation... besides, I need to work on my California tan... it suprising how many people know you're from the Northeast just by your tan line.  But... anyway, that should be fun... More later..  -dj

      Oh man... what a fun night.  We went out to dinner with Ehren's aunt and uncle to this awesome Italian restaurant.  Then we all came back to their house for som drinks.  Ehren had a martini and now is compltely blitzed walking around.  He says he definately just fell into my jeans in the bathroom.. funny funny. (He also had alot of wine at dinner).  I had a cosmopolitan, probably one of the best cosmopolitans I've ever had... I'm pretty good. Well anyway... we're waking up tomorrow at around 6 am to go surfing, I can't wait... it's gonna be awesome... my first time.  So, I'll talk to you all later... Hope all is well back home.  -Dan

      Well here we are in beautiful San Diego.  We arrived here after one long night at about 3pm yesterday.  We'll probably be here for the next couple of days staying with Ehren's aunt and uncle.  We haven't gotten a chance to do much yet but I'll write more later... we're going surfing tomorrow.  It's really nice to have had a day to just relax and do absolutely nothing...   More later..

      I slept for the past hour or more and woke up in this megalopolis where we've stopped yet again to partake of Kinko's free Internet services.  We've uploaded an assload of pictures for your viewing pleasure... hope you enjoy that.  After a few sandwiches and perhaps another round of energy drinks, it's off for New Mexico.  I'll write more later.  The road beckons.

      6/24/2004 12:12 AM  On the road… getting tired… What was once really amazing country-side has not turned into just dark, long, and boring road… it’s very hard to stay awake when all you’re doing is staring straight ahead for miles upon miles.  However, hopefully we’ll reach El Paso in about three hours… that’ll give us a little break with the Kinko’s run.  Oh man, I cannot wait to post all of the pictures so all you guys can see what we’ve been talking about so much.  However, I guess the one good thing about the night sky, and the fact that we’re in the middle of nowhere, is the stars… When the clouds break up it is a simply beautiful night sky, just stretching for miles, as far as the eye can see.  The moon is really amazing as well, just hanging there, shining bright and crescented.  I wrote this a little while ago on a whim while we were driving through the night the last time.  We went forward into the dark To experience. To suck the marrow out of life. To look into the end of our days and know our limits, And then to stare in the face of those limits with the brightest, fearless of eyes.  Kinda paid my little homage there to Thoreau in the middle… I hope no one thinks me unoriginal… but you can’t beat good lines.    Can I just say right now how much I’m missing Ali.  Every time I think of her, which is pretty much all the time in some fashion, I can’t help but smile.  She smiles at me in my head and I just melt.  Sorry… I don’t mean to get mushy, but how can I help it… you all know how amazing she is.  Okay.. now I’m pretty much just writing cause I can’t really think of anything else to do at the moment. List of Things to Do at the Next Possible Chance: 1: Sleep 2: Download Chicago’s Greatest Hits (Possibly the Greatest of all the 80’s Smushy Love Bands) 3: Post to Blog (I have a feeling there’s gonna be a lot of stuff on this one, pics etc…) 4: Hug my pillow in hopes that it magically turns into Ali 5: Roll over and Hug Ehren after being dejected of human contact after my pillow turns out to not, in fact, be Ali. 6: Take two showers. 7: Take third shower. 8: Create new signs to put on our windows to entice hot truckers… shit, I mean girls. 9: Find Sharpie marker that we bought in San Antonio to make the signs. 10: Pee break. 11: Drink second energy drink. 12: Pee break… you know me… like a tea-cup. 13: Look down and shake my head dejectedly as I ponder the long term affects of travel on my um…. 14: Curse God as Ehren points out to me that there are no longer term affects. 15: Swerve car around armadillo thing in road. 16: Notice the two-hundred miles to El Paso sign and cry out in large voice a great Yelp! 17: Admit that I am tired and that this list is getting stupider. 18: Realize that I am stupid already and that this is just how I operate. 19: Read book because it makes you smot. 20: Realize that Southwestern travel brochures do not qualify as books. 21: Just give up typing.  More Later……

      Well, we decided to change our plans.  Hitting Bryce Canyon and Grand Canyon on the outbound trip is just too far out of the way.  Check it out on a map… it’s much further north than I’d figured.  But we’re going to hit it on the way back across the country on our way to Colorado.  That’s the best part of this road trip – no set itinerary.  So if we decide to drive to California instead of Utah, then it’s just another adventure and no harm done.  Hundreds, if not thousands, of miles of prairie and desert await us and my little Corolla.  I should do an ad for Toyota.  We found a state park in Kerrville, Texas this evening with the intention of camping there and leaving around 4am for Bryce Canyon.  But when we got there, we discovered that the office was closed, they lock the gate at 10pm and don’t open it until 8am… a significant kink in the plans.  So after a bit of brainstorming, we just decided to cook dinner there and use their showers (which were AMAZING by the way, water pressure that would almost knock you over and lots of free hot water), then set out for another long drive that is going to end with us getting to San Diego tomorrow evening around the time Marianne gets out of work.  Dan and I are now road warriors.  In 6 days, we’ve left Connecticut, spent two full days in New Orleans, an afternoon in San Antonio and will reach San Diego, California before sundown on the sixth day… three thousand, two hundred and ninety nine miles later.  Why the hell doesn’t everyone do this?  And often?  Man, to get out and see the world, I thought I needed to travel to exotic foreign lands with a passport.  Turns out all I need is a car and a sense of adventure.  There’s enough foreign lands in this country to teach me for a good long while.

      6/23/2004 7:01 PM  Well, Ehren and I just stopped about an hour ago at Kerrville-Rheiner State Park in Kerrville, Texas. (about an hour west of San Antonio)  Tomorrow, we were originally thinking of starting the long trek up to Bryce Canyon… about 2 days distance North in Utah.  However, we’ve made a slight change deciding that Bryce Canyon was a little too far out of the way right now.  Originally we were planning on shooting through Vegas as well on our way back down to San Diego, but we also decided that neither of us really have enough money to waste on that city… so we nixed it.  Anyway… here comes our new plan:  It’s about 7 pm right now… we leave Kerrville at 8 and just start driving.  It’s about 18 hours to San Diego from here, most likely less, and given the time change we should reach our destination at about 4-ish pm tomorrow… give or take.. who knows… it depends how long we stop along the way and whether or not we need sleep.  So anyway… that’s the plan.  The next major stop is El Paso where we’re hoping to find another Kinko’s to download some blogs and pictures… woo hoo finally.  Well, off to take a shower at this campsite before we take off… more later.

      Hey Everyone,     We just stopped in at the Kinko's to update some blogs. We're in San Antonio..  we are going to try very hard today to find a Walgreens or CVS to try and make a cd of the pictures we've taken, cause the USB port on our computer isn't working.  Hopefully we'll be able to get those up next time we get to a Kinko's, but who knows when that will be next... we're gonna be outside in backwoods New Mexico and Utah... who knows... maybe we'll stop in Albuquerque sp? Anyway, talk to you all later..   -DAN

      6/22/2004 10:26 PM  Oh man… what I would give for one of those cool New England ocean breezes right about now.  Ehren and I are both sitting in a tent sweating our asses off in Palmetto State Park… about 50 miles out of San Antonio, Texas.  So I guess Ehren told you all about our car adventure today with the hot girl… all part of my elusive plan to hook Ehren up with some amazingly hot road trip girl.  But the plan seemed to work pretty well… we’ll see how it goes later on.  Though, it’ll be hard to beat what happened today… funny as all hell.  I’m so looking forward to going to San Antonio tomorrow, Ehren has told me so much about it.  He tells me about a certain River Walk that is supposed to be really beautiful, and I can’t wait to try one of the margaritas down there which both Ehren and Tony have told me are amazing and huge.  Have to try one of those when I get there.  IT’S SO HOT!!!  So anyway, I don’t really have much else to say… I think Ehren just about covered it in his blog.  Tomorrow we’re hoping on getting a really early start so we can make the most out of our day in San Antonio.  Breakfast will be an adventure… tonight was my first attempt at cooking on a camp stove… I think it turned out all right.  We had pasta with a sauce made out of tomato sauce, onions, and some ground beef… all of which we bought at this weird little supermarket down the road from us.  I don’t think I’ve ever gone into a supermarket where one of the categories on those signs telling you what’s down each aisle says, “Religious Candles”…. Very strange.  Anyway, time to read some Harry Potter before hittin’ the hay… talk to you all later.  P.S.-  “meep”- you know what I mean.  :-D

      It’s our first camping experience of the trip.  I’m sitting in our tent, typing this blog entry out to you in the middle of the woods one hour east of San Antonio, Texas.  Technology rocks.  It’s friggin hot.  The campground is empty, and I think I understand why – all the Texans know better than to camp in this heat.  They’re all inside in their air conditioning, probably laughing at all the dumb tourists who want to experience their state (or “country” depending on your view of Texas…)  At least it’s just a place to sleep.  Heat I can deal with, especially when I’m paying $7 per night to stay here, in the wilderness, with a river down a cliff from our site.  I guess I didn’t mention that – our site is riverside, and a muddy river at that.  All the rivers down here seem to be muddy… maybe they pick it up on their way down south or something.  They’re so clear back home.  We forgot the propane.  Dan thinks it might be in his car back in West Haven, but we’re both confused because we thought we had it with us.  We stopped by a mini-mart off the highway and I hit on a hot girl who was working there.  She didn’t have a clue, and Dan informed me on the way out that he thought she was about sixteen.  God damn it.  I hate when that happens.  On Interstate 10 – which we took all the way from New Orleans to here – we passed a hot girl driving next to us.  On Dan’s suggestion, I wrote up a sign which read:   “YOU’RE REALLY HOT!”     He held it up to the window as we passed her, and she just about drove off the road laughing.  After such a favorable reaction, we went in for the kill with sign #2, which read:   “DINNER? SAN ANTONIO”  By this point, she was on her cell phone with what I can only presume to be another of her amazingly hot friends – maybe two.  She liked this sign even more than the first, cracked up laughing again, and started chattering excitedly into her cell phone as she glanced up at us.  Some time passed.  I was about to give up hope despite Dan’s reassurance to keep the faith, when she pulled up alongside us with a big smile on her face and a sign of her own:   “SORRY, I’M GOING TO AUSTIN.  THANKS THOUGH.”  Shot down.  But we now have our shtick ready to go and a sign to get us started.  We have the rest of the trip to perfect it.  Apparently girls like guys who are crazy and make them laugh.  Now we just need to find one with the same destination... and who is as hot as this one.  The search continues!  Dan wants to blog and we’re running off battery power.  Ehren out.

      We’re driving through Beaumont, Texas right now.  Well, Dan is driving – I’m riding, but you get the idea.  Our drive this morning through southern Louisiana was amazing.  The interstate that goes west from New Orleans toward Texas travels for miles and miles through the bayou.  That is, the road is an elevated causeway supported by concrete poles above miles and miles of swamp.  With nowhere to pull off, it was pretty much impossible to take any good pictures… and the ones we took from the road were mostly of the guardrails bounding the road.  There were lonely power lines stretching from nowhere to nowhere through the murk on tall thin poles, and an occasional motored skiff moored to the highway support with a couple people fishing.  Sometimes we would travel through a small piece of land surrounded by swamp with no highway exit, and there were little houses whose only access lay in boats through the bayou.  It’s a different way to live, isolated in an odd way far different from that of northern New England.  When you’re up in the mountains, there is nothing around… no people, no interstates, no passers-by… nothing.  In those places by the highway, people pass by all the time on the interstate, but there is no connection between the cars and the inhabitants of the bayou.  All we can do is look at each other and ruminate what the other’s life is like.  Last night Dan and I went to Preservation Hall in New Orleans, the birthplace of jazz.  Guidebooks would call it quaint and rustic.  In reality, it’s a dump.  But it’s a dump oozing with tradition and history.  The place is a wooden building in a city of brick.  No air conditioning, sweltering heat, wooden planks for benches and old tired cushions on the floor for seating.  If you’re in the back, you stand.  This is a place that’s all about the music.  If you want other niceties, you may as well go somewhere else.  That it’s lasted as long as it has is a miracle in and of itself.  But the music that happens inside each night is nothing short of amazing.  This was without a doubt the best jazz I have ever heard in my life.  The band had seven instruments – piano, bass, banjo, clarinet, trumpet, trombone, and drums.  Each was a master of their instrument, but their real talent was in their ability to play off each other, commenting on each other’s ideas to create a dynamic tapestry of sound unlike anything I’ve ever heard.   Had an odd dream last night about an old crush (actually, my only one ever… I’ve never really been into crushes) that suddenly came back into my life.  We hit it off, and started dating.  I have no idea where she actually is right now… haven’t talked with her in years.  I had a thing for her all through high school but didn’t have the guts to ask her out… she went to a different school, we’d met at music camp… you get the picture.  By the time I finally did develop testicles, she’d met this other guy.  Dammit.  She remains the one who got away.  Whether it would have ever worked, who knows?  But my memories of her are all great, and I’d love to have the chance to find out.  Last I knew she was going to Westminster to study choral conducting and had a boyfriend.  Both of which probably make the dream a moot point.  But it was nice while it lasted.  Tomorrow, San Antonio.  I can’t wait to show Dan some of the stuff I’ve seen there and discover even more.  I want to see the Riverwalk, the Alamo, and some of the old Spanish Missions that stretch south from the city.  My goal is to not get bitten by any fire ants while at the missions (Meg, that one’s for you!)    Is the audioblog working?  I tried to set it up and post, but I think I fucked it up.  I’ll get it eventually.  Picture posting is going to be a no-go for a while because the USB port on my computer is dead, and I need that to link up with the camera.  I guess you’ll all have to wait for them till later.    Heading back to the real world.  Ehren out.

      6/22/2004 1:59 PM Last night, our last night in New Orleans, was simply amazing.  I think I may have seen and heard the best jazz of my life.  We went to the Preservation Hall jazz club in the heart of the Old Quarter of New Orleans.  It really is this little shit hole in the wall, hasn’t changed much in a hundred years…  you walk in and sit on these long wooden benches in a dark, small.. un-airconditioned room.. lit only by two light bulbs over the area where the musicians played.  All around us on the walls were these blackened pictures of old jazz musicians, and it all smelt very musty.  The band started playing at around 8:15 and we stayed for two sets until 9:30.  Awesome.  I don’t know really how to describe the music… it was earthy, it was so real.. alive.  It was the only the music that I can remember that had so much personal character infused into its production.  These guys were good... they all knew all the traditional requests that were made by the people, and they played them all so well, each having a 1 or 2 minute solo in the the middle.  Just Awesome.  So anyway, after that we went out onto Bourbon street to have some fun on our last night in town.  We started by just hitting some bars, each one having a different type of music playing.  There was even a karaoke bar which Ehren and I entertained the possibility of performing in a little later on in the night.  We then went to this bar to try one of Bourbon streets famous “Hand Grenades” – “New Orleans most powerful drink.”  We tried it… it was good.. Ehren got drunk-ish, I was happy too.  After we hung out at that place for a while we were pretty much tired out.  We walked around Bourbon street for a while and then finally made it back to the hostile at around 1 am.  Another great night.    That city was entirely too much fun.  I really hope I’ll make it back there some day.. we need to bring all our friends there some time  because it would be an awesome place to party.    So… now we’re on the road again heading for San Antonio, Texas.  We’re just about at the border of Louisianna and Texas now having driven for four hours.  Texas, although we are breaking it up with some camping excursions, is going to a long state to drive through… it’s already getting flat and boring.  I can’t wait to get up to the deserts of New Mexico and Utah… and Bryce Canyon, it’s supposedly beautiful land out there.    Oh… I forgot to mention…  we went to this Old Quarter French market during the day yesterday and bought Loki this awesome toy.  One of those weevle balls with a tail.  He is gonna go ape over it.  Well anyway, we’re about to stop at a rest stop just over the Texas border..  More will come later..    P.S.-  I miss you Ali.  Love you.  –Dan

      Well, this is our secodn day in New Orleans and all I can say is wow.  Rarely have I been to a city with so much history coursing through it.  We've been spending most of our time in the Old Quarter, pretty much just walking around.  We went to the New Orleans Voodoo museum yesterday, that was pretty cool.  I learned alot about something of which I had really no knowledge.    The great thing about this road trip is that it's so free.  There are no plans whatsoever.  For instance we had originally planned to stay only until today, but we liked it so much that we decided to stay an extra night.  We didn't get an oppurtunity to go to Preservation Hall last night to hear some jazz, so hopefully we'll get back to that place sometime tonight and check it out.  Preservation Hall is the funniest little place.  All it is this run-down shack of a building in the middle of the old quarter, that every night just has amazing jazz musicians coming through it.  This place truly pulses with music, everywhere your turn it's around you.  Just walking through the Old Quarter yesterday I think we must have seen at least 6 street musicians/bands just playing: including this one Hill-billy mountain music band with this sick Banjo player..  we got a couple of photos of them and will display later.  These musicians, along with the people who were actually playing in bars etc., made it so that literally every corner you turned, there was a different type of music around you.  Next stop is San Antonio, where we'll probably only end up staying a night.  I really want to get up to Bryce Canyon by Thurs night so we can get some camping in. Anyway through.. more will come later.. but for now, my stomach is calling.

      Dan and I have been here for two days now.  This city is amazing... we are definitely coming back with friends for some serious fun.  I was completely unprepared for Bourbon Street and everything that came with it.  If you've been here, you know what I'm talking about... if not, well, then you'll just have to come back with us!  We got in on Saturday night around 11:30pm... 25 hours after our departure from New Haven, CT.  We drove the whole way through without stopping through some long-ass states like Virginia and Alabama. The speed limit became 70 when we got further south, too... very cool.  Yesterday was spent walking around in the French Quarter, stopping in shops, listening to street musicians, eating great food and the like.  We hit an IMAX showing of Harry Potter, and in general just enjoyed being in what is turning out to be the greatest city of all time.  For now, that's the news.  Stay tuned.

      I just finished a five-hour stint of driving, which brought us from Connecticut through New York, New Jersey, and Delaware to Maryland around exit 93 on I-95.  Already, we have had some serious adventures.    Our map program is not as infallible as we thought.  Going through New York City, it snaked us down the east side into Queens on 295.  The highway ended on us abruptly, confusing me a whole hell of a lot.  On the bright side, we needed gas anyway and it spit us out right in front of a Mobil station.  On the down side, the only was out of New York was through – straight through.  I had the driving adventure of a lifetime.  Sometime around midnight we ended up in Lower Manhattan in the Bowery.  Our goal: the Holland Tunnel to take us to Jersey.  Dan’s navigational skills and my amazing driving brought us through without a hitch, which was just freaking cool.  I learned something about driving in New York… it’s a lot like driving in Boston, except a lot more so.  He who hesitates is dead, so to speak.  So you just GO, you just drive with an exacting blend of reckless abandon and steely-eyed precision, with a bit of a balls-out attitude toward it all.  If there’s a spot, you jam on the gas pedal and make it yours, because nobody is going to give it to you.  In some ways, it’s like a high-stakes game of chicken.  It was exhilarating.  It was a blast.  It took all my concentration and then some.  But we emerged without a scratch and without any close calls at all.    It’s 3:58am and I am not really tired.  A bit out of it, yes, but driving for 5 hours will do that to you.  At this point, my excitement for the whole trip and adrenaline are keeping me going.  I think it’s the same for Dan.  And while it lasts, we’re banging out as many miles as we can.  Road weariness will set in eventually, and we’ll sleep when we need to.  But for now, it’s full speed ahead.

      The trip is over.&nbsp; I'm back in Connecticut, though still "on the road" in some aspects due to the fact that I don't have a home yet.&nbsp; That problem, thankfully, will be remedied tomorrow when Dan and I move into our new place in Vernon. &nbsp; This will be my last post in this blog.&nbsp; It's time I get back to my normal one and jumpstart it with a vengeance.&nbsp;  &nbsp; The last post I made left us somewhere in Boulder, Colorado... leaving a whole lot of blank space between there and here.&nbsp; I'll try and fill some of that in now.&nbsp; We left Boulder on a Monday morning after spending three nights there with Roz and Johnny McClellan for Liberty, Missouri -- just outside of Kansas City, Missouri -- to stay with Jay and Melissa Carter.&nbsp; To get there, we had to drive through the state of Kansas, which is an awful, awful place.&nbsp; It's long and flat and barren and useless and hot and just a boring place. &nbsp; Of course, I was brought up on mountains and oceans.&nbsp; Kansas has neither, which might be why I hated it so much.&nbsp; But then, Dan hated it more.&nbsp; Avoid the place if you can. &nbsp; Staying in Liberty with Jay and Melissa was a great time.&nbsp; The first night, we went to hang out on the campus of William Jewell College... for the uninformed, the alma mater of Jay, Melissa, Mark and Kristen Singleton, and Dave Pettyjohn.&nbsp; It was beautiful place... I can see why some people prefer private schools.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Overall, Missouri was HOT.&nbsp; Not just hot in the way we're all used to it.&nbsp; It was oppresively humidly hot, with a heat index of about 110 degrees on Tuesday.&nbsp; This is why I didn't post from Liberty -- in my immortal words, it was too hot to shit, and certainly too hot to write.&nbsp; Tuesday night we went out to the Ameristar casino, where I discovered the wonders of playing casino blackjack and not just sticking to video poker machines.&nbsp; I los about $40 by the time all was said and done but played for hours... but Dan won $30!&nbsp; He was making all sorts of crazy bets like doubling down to a seventeen and pulling it off by drawing a four to make twenty-one.&nbsp; It was a great night. &nbsp; Wednesday found us leaving Liberty for Fort Wayne, Indiana to stay with Jenny Williamson's dad, Earnie.&nbsp; Jenny was in Vermont and her mother in Texas during our one-night stay, but Earnie took Dan and I out for an amazing rib dinner and put us up for the night.&nbsp; We left the next morning for Pittsburgh and what turned out to be an amazing concert with Guster, Rufus Wainwright, and Ben Folds at the Chevy Amphitheatre down by the water... anyone from ACDA Pittsburgh will remember crossing the bridge on foot to go up the hillside elevator... it was right there at the elevator's base.&nbsp; The concert ended around 11pm and Dan and I jumped back in the car for the final leg of our journey.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eight and one-half hours later, we pulled into his driveway in West Haven, CT. &nbsp; Three years I tried to take this road trip, with different people at different times.&nbsp; Finally, I pulled it off.&nbsp; I can't think of a better person I could have gone with.&nbsp; I think I probably would have killed most other people after spending a month straight with them in a Corolla.&nbsp; Dan and I worked out really well and got to see more parts of the country than I ever knew existed.&nbsp; Tomorrow, we move into our new apartment in the Springville Mill in Vernon.&nbsp; And I'm stoked.&nbsp; I have tons of pictures that you can all see when you come visit... the ones posted here are only a fraction of all the ones I took.&nbsp; Thanks for reading this thing&nbsp;the whole trip... seeing comments in here was really cool and kept us from missing you all quite so much... it was like you were all here.&nbsp; But not here.&nbsp; But here.&nbsp; It's good to be back.&nbsp; But I can see now, more clearly than ever, that my days in this state are numbered.&nbsp; Its redeeming factor is my friends.&nbsp; And that, for now, is plenty.&nbsp; When I get out of grad school, then I'll start convincing you all to move somewhere else with me. &nbsp; But for now, I'm still Ehren

      Well... here we are.  Ehren is in the shower at the moment, so I thought I'd take a few to write a bit.  Our time in Boulder was everything that serenity can encompass.  The McClellan's, my sister's boyfriend's parents, have a beautiful house in the mtns. outside of Boulder, just to the east of the Rockies and the Continental Divide.  The view is stunning.  Maybe I'm a little biased, but I have to say that this is one of my most favorite stops of this trip.  I had never been out here before and all that I had heard was through my sister... who in her somewhat cavalier way, never truly described how beautiful it was.  The McClellans have the cutest cat... clearly she rules superior throughout the house... currently she's right in front of me while I'm trying to type, demanding attention..  Hold on...  ..  The house is perched between mtns. in a valley just by what the McClellans call Twin Sisters Peak.  Ehren and I hiked this mtn. with them a few days ago and were stunned by the amazing 360 degree view of CO at the time.  Also... it was amazing to hear how quiet it was out there... and at the cabin as well.  In CT, even when you're hiking through the forest (what forest?) you always have the sense that civilization is just looming around every corner.  Here, however, is a total escape.  It takes two dirt roads and one that goes up a mtn to visit the cabin... civilization is left far behind.  And thus, it's just peaceful... the cares of the world seem to float away up here and you are left to enjoy the natural beauty that is all around us, but that we never notice.   Last night I think I saw the most amazing, star-filled sky that I have ever seen.  We were having a cookout with the McClellans at their second cabin, about two miles away.  While the main cabing has all the modern conveniances of any New York house... the smaller cabin is just a cabin... with well-water and no electricity, save for a little battery attached to a solar-panel (like something that Thoreau could have written about, only with probably nalied boards)... but it is here that one can truly find a natural sanctuary.  Left without all the distractions of the world, one really realizes how many singular thoughts race through one's head.  We joked and talked about politics, philosophy, and all sorts of subjects... we sang around the campfire on Ros's old classical guitar... it was a great night.  And the food was awesome too.  Ehren and I had bought these garlic and roasted pepper sausages that were really really good,  and we roasted corn inside tin foil in the hot coals of the fire... really tasty, we'll have to do it up in vt next time.  But anyway... the stars were exquisite.  I saw constellations surrounding other constellations that I never even knew existed... and the big dipper... probably the only thing I can really recognize... was ginormous... like it had been strung into the site by a giant lasso... simply amazing.   Well, anyway, I could go on forever talking about every little detail that I found amazing about this place.  It is beautiful, and I feel honored to have had the McClellans share it with me for a while.  It is their perfection.    More later... time to shower...

      I just found this writing on  urlLink Meaghan's blog .  Thought it was so amazing I had to post it here, too.  Enjoy.  DESERATA  Go placidly amid the noise and haste, & remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly & clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and ignorant; they too have their story.  Avoid loud & agressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain & bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many people strive for high ideals; Be yourself.   Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity & disenchantment it transcends time and space. Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.   Nurture strength of Spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome disipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees & the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.   Therfore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive God to be, and whatever your labors & aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. With all its shame, drudgery & broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be Careful. Take Care. Strive to be Happy.  (Found in old St. Pauls Church in Baltimore circa. 1692 -- Writer unknown)

      I don’t know what I expected of this place.  Maybe nothing at all – an experience with no preconceived notions, I don’t know.  But however I got here, this place is a mixture of nature and nirvana.  It’s what you would expect if you put Montgomery, Vermont in some real mountains instead of those rolling hills that Vermont has to offer.    I’m just east of the Continental Divide right now, in a cabin owned by Dan’s sister’s boyfriend’s parents.  They’re extremely nice folks, salt of the earth type.  I guess you have to be to live out here, so isolated from people.  Their property is smack in the middle of the Roosevelt and Arapaho National Forests, so there’s no worries about anyone ever spoiling the scenery with big houses or other development.  The setting begs for reflection and spiritual contemplation.  Being such an integral part of nature out here also serves to provide some much-needed perspective into many things.  The silence is deafening, until you open your ears and hear all the sounds of the woods around you.  We drove up Mt. Evans today.  At 14,260 feet tall, it’s the highest I’ve ever been in my life – and certainly the highest my little car has ever ventured.  Up until this trip, the highest she’d ever traveled was 6,280 feet up the Mt. Washington Auto Road.  We got snowed on today on the top of this mountain.  Yes, snow.  In July.  That’s what fourteen thousand feet will do to you, I guess.  I also got high today… from the altitude and lack of oxygen on top of the mountain.  It was curious how the air just seemed to be thin, and completely useless where breathing was concerned.  It just wasn’t enough for my system.  I got dizzy and couldn’t talk or think straight.  A very curious experience altogether, and one I’d recommend if you get the chance just to see what it feels like.  Just don’t drive off the edge of the road on the way up – there are no guard rails, just steep cliffs to tumble over.  This evening, Dan and I went into Boulder and found this “mall” that is basically like a really clean and artsy Fanueil Hall from Boston.  Lots of street performers and cool stores characterize this area of the downtown that’s been set aside solely for pedestrian traffic.  We later found a dueling piano bar called The Reef and hung out there for a few hours.  Connecticut needs a place like that.    Oh, and fans of The Onion will be interested to know that it’s published here.  Well, here and in Denver.  It’s available in print for free on the street.  How cool is that?  Sleep is calling.  I plan on picking up and having a nice long conversation.  Hope everyone is well.  Sleep loose.

      Well, I pretty much thinhk that Ehren summed at least the details of our trip the past couple of days.  I remember fondly a billboard that Ehren and I saw while in San Fran it read.  "The reason settlers came to the east first was because if they came to California, they never would have left."  (Or something like that)  But how true it is.  Everytime I go to California I can't help bu feel an overwhelming sense of serenity... I don't really know why.  It's just beautiful.  Driving up the coast and seeing the beauty of ocean meeting land... whether it be by way of cliff or beach, to the bold beauty of the Yosemite Valley.  All of these places are different... but yet all in California.  Any preconception or judgement I had made about the physical beauty of the earth was totally blasted away and redefined by this one state.    I came down the trail... a long trail, too tired at the moment to really care what I was about to see, but then it hit... the largest living thing on the earth, and who would have thought it'd be a tree.  It's so simple... trees have such simple lives... most of them anyway.  They live, grow, and then at some point die... most likely from weather changes.  But these trees were different, soaring into the air, their barked charred in some places from past forest fires.  These trees were older than Christ.  Almost 3500 years old.  The forest in which they lived far from being explored by anyone.  Amazing... huge and amazing.    Anyway, the Giant Sequioa in Yosemite was definately a highlight for me.  In fact all of Yosemite was amazing... I just never imagined that anything could be so... big.  I know I'm not describing it so well...  I can't, I'm speechless...  Everyone needs to see it to know.  Ansel Adams is the only person who has ever come close to capturing the simple, yet bombastic beauty of the place.  And learning a little bit more about him through the Ansel Adams museum in Yosemite was definately something I really appreciated.  It made me wish that I had brought my own camera... only because I know how it works so well.  I'm still getting use to Ehren's new digital, and so is he... but I really think we're gonna come home with some good shots.  We'll see...    Anyway, Bryce Canyon was our next stop... another amazing feat of nature... that you just can't describe.  And in all the pictures that I've seen it always looks so small. You never really get the open air feel of all those caverns and crevices.  Hopefull our pictures will convince me otherwise, we'll see...  But just amazing.    Well that's enough of me saying amazing and beautiful.  Next stop is Boulder, CO, to stay with my sister's boyfriend's parents... awesome people and I can't wait to see them.  Talk later... missing everyone... especially the one.  Random Ehren quote:  "New Orleans was awesome, it made Spring Weekend look like a teletubbies show."   He's a strange guy... but he loves his teletubbies.

      Man, it’s been a long time since the last blog from the Hyatt in San Francisco.  It seems an age ago.  And yet it’s been what, four days?  Let’s start where I left off -- with the trip east from San Francisco toward Yosemite.  We stopped in the desert town of Oakdale, California for some Taco Bell, an oil change, and some provisions.  The guys who changed our oil (one young, one old) were easily the nicest and most useful mechanics I’ve ever met.  I think that our plates said Connecticut broke the ice pretty quickly.  Their oil change service included vacuuming and washing of our windows – inside AND out.  Okay, on to Yosemite.  Yosemite National Park was unbelievable.  I have tons of pictures, which I’ll post as soon as I can, but this trip into the wilderness was amazing.  Our campground was off the path.  Way off.  We drove down a 3 mile switchback road that said simply “ROUGH ROAD”.  What an understatement.  It was like driving an obstacle course.  At one time the road had been paved, but ever since it had been left to its own devices.  Washouts and deep potholes were everywhere.  Often it was easier and safer to drive on the dirt shoulder – when there was one!  Other times the road dropped off on the side.  Once we made it down, the campground was isolated and beautiful, just the way I like it.  We were almost the only people there, save two other families who had braved the trip down that road.  The following day, Dan and I explored Yosemite Valley.  We soon found a waterfall, Bridalveil Falls, parked the car, and hiked up in to the base of the falls.  I soon found all my rock-climbing skills honed in Maine and northern New Hampshire in demand as we scrambled up and over boulders and around rocks to get closer than the path brought us and to get away from the legions of tourists who seemed unable to leave the path.  Later on, we found another waterfall, Yosemite Falls, which is apparently the fifth tallest waterfall in the world at something around 2700 feet.  We did the hike and scramble thing again, but at the base of this one we found a huge pool for swimming that had been carved into the rock by eons of water erosion.  So we went swimming – Dan in his khakis, me in my shorts.  Man, was it cold.  But being able to swim and really move around warmed me up.  For a bit, at least.  Eventually my feet started going numb and my joints started getting that stupid feeling, so I headed for the rocks.  The next day – July seventh, if I’ve got the dates right – we headed east through the upper part of the park on the Tioga Road, through cliffs (literally!), around boulders, past subalpine meadows, and all the other beautiful things that make up the Sierra Nevada Mountains.  I can see why John Muir loved this place so much.  As we left the park, we crossed Tioga Pass at an altitude of 9,945 feet – the highest I’ve been to date and certainly the highest my car has ever driven.  This will all be remedied tomorrow as we drive through the Rocky Mountains and cross the Continental Divide en route to Boulder, Colorado.  But I’m getting ahead of myself.  Today, we explored Bryce Canyon National Park in southwestern Utah.  I now understand why everyone kept telling me that I just had to go there.  The place is awe-inspiring in every sense of the phrase.  The land is a combination of limestone and sandstone.  They erode at different speeds, creating the dramatic landscape of steep dropoffs and columns of rock called hoodoos that are tenacious remnants of old land masses.  Everything simply eroded around them, leaving these strange-shaped things I can only describe as stalagmites, except they’re not in a cave.  So you might just have to wait for the pictures on this one.  We took a hike down into the canyon and walked in and around and under and through all these things.  I kept forgetting about the high altitude of the place – about 7,000 feet – and continually wondered why I got so tired so quickly.  Typical me, I guess…  And now we are in the car just west of Grand Junction, Colorado, where we plan to stop for a break.  There’s no Kinko’s here, but we’re going to try and fake it.  Either we’ll find some other place to connect to the Internet, or we’ll cruise the residential streets of Grand Junction in hopes of finding some Net-dummy who can’t lock down their wireless network and surf from the street.   Or we’ll just fail on all attempts and connect in Boulder.  We’ll see.  Hey, the trip’s all about adventure, right?

      Happy fricking Fourth of July.  The day we celebrate blowing shit up and killing people.    Yay us.  Wait -- yay US.  Dan and I went down to the water to watch the fireworks tonight.  It was a lazy day after the bullshit of getting rained on last night, so neither of us felt like braving the madness down at Pier 39.  So we found a long pier somewhere around 15 or 20 or so with a whole mass of other people and went out to the end and waited.  Had a great view.  Or so we thought.  Fate had other ideas.  The fog that makes San Francisco so famous rolled in around 8pm.  Fireworks were due to start around 9pm.  9 came and went.  The breeze kicked up and chilled us down but good.  Eventually, we had a distant show of Oakland's fireworks show going on across the bay.  Looked like a good one, too... just really small and far off.  People set off firecrackers here and there.  There was also the occasional firework set off from within the city -- a huge no-no, I'm sure, but fun to watch.  Finally, around 9:30, we heard booms from the area of Pier 39.  And lights began to flash from behind the long building in front of us.    And that was all we would get.  For some reason, fireworks shows out here take place awfully low to the ground.  To hear some residents talking, this was very unusual -- usually they could see the show from where we were.  But tonight?  No dice.  I don't know if it was the wind, or the fog, or what, but the show was just too damn low to see.    On the way out was the best part of the show.  Some kid my age tossed an M80 in the water next to us as we were leaving the pier, which went off with a boom like a car bomb.  Scared the piss out of me.  But I actually enjoyed it.  Needed something to explode after the letdown San Fran put on for us.  Still, though -- it was a great day and evening, despite the cocktease of a fireworks display.  Dan and I bummed around the city and hotel, and generally had a grand time doing not much at all.  Tomorrow, we're off for Yosemite.  I'm going to miss California and the Pacific.  I need to live here after grad school.  Two more years.  Maybe we should all buy a house out here and get like 8 or 10 people in on it.  Shoot our own Real World or something.  Hey, I can dream, can't I?

      Came across these passages while looking through my journal today.  The first was written while en route to Block Island back in May with Leila:    Beliefs and such  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; truths I hold dear   the interconnectedness of all things   emotions as energy which does not die, but resonates in eternity   the potential for good in all people   society as a stifling hierarchy designed to enfranchise the weak   the perfection of nature   the genius and stupidity of man     The next is a reflection on the cyclical nature of life:  Everything comes around again. Anyone who says "You pass this way but once" is missing half the point/ Sure, you only experience things once... live once... but our lives aren't linear -- they spiral. Two steps forward, one step back As we circle back on what we have been We gain perspective into how to be the person We most want to be.  And the last is a philosophy-of-life-in-progress:  Balls out, into the world -- no worries.  Let the chips fall where they please.  And I will create my own destiny -- not from skill or wisdom, but through sheer will.  Sure, it's all kind of existential.  But it's 1:19am -- what do you want from me?  This is what I think about at one in the morning.

      It's Day 2 in San Francisco for us and last night was bullshit.  It was our second night at the state park in Marin County north of the city, but last night the fog came in with a vengeance.  So much so, in fact, that it condensed on all the trees around our site and then the trees started raining on us.  No rain in the parking lot, rain under the trees.  What the fuck.  So I woke up around 6:30 to an empty tent, which was dripping wet.  Dan had headed for the car to sleep because he was cold just before the trees began to piss on us.  Add to that the fact that I hadn't put on the rain fly due to the beautiful weather... and you pretty much get the picture.  Rain was dripping in on me, and had been for some time, evidently.  The tent was drenched, although I wasn't for some reason.  So I packed up the tent in the rain and stuffed all the wet stuff in the trunk.  Tonight we're staying at a Hyatt on the Embarcadero so that we can enjoy the city for the Fourth.  I also need a break from the rain.  And a shower.  Should be fun :).  Off for more adenvtures.  Ehren out.

      Hello Everyone,     Here we are in San Francisco... the weather has been kinda crappy but Ehren and I have been staying in an awesome campsite on top of mt. tamalpais, outside mill valley.  We're in the city at the moment... Happy 4th of July... Fireworks tonight over the bay... should be awesome, as well as a welcomed stay in a hotel tonight.  We both seriously need to shower.  Last night was wet too, so we woke up early and got the hell out of our campsite quick and very early.  So here we are looking to enjoy the day... hopefully we can shower soon.  More Later...  :-D

      Getting a bit philosophical lately... anyone know any good poetry I could read?  I seem to be getting into T.S. Eliot a lot.  Let me know.  Classes are great.  Looking forward to an awesome semester... the LAST one of classes at UConn!  that seems weird, it feels like I've been here forever.  My new church job is going really well.  VERY excited about that, I got to hire a new bass section leader to replace Brett... what a power trip, I can deal with this being in charge thing...  Keep smiling, watch your ass, always make new mistakes and don't ever forget to LIVE!

      What?  You mean I'm not just here to march around on the field while blowing my face off on a mellophone?  Yup, you guessed it... marching band preseason is over and I am now reacquainting myself with the real world that is UConn and classes and other stuff.  I'm gonna miss it... as much work as it is, there's something incredible about working your ass off besides a couple hundred other people... you bond really quickly having shared those experiences.  Classes this semester... senioritis, anyone?  I am searching for motivation to kick ass and not just get by, and I'm not sure I have it.  Hope it comes from somewhere!  Tomorrow's my first day of work at the church as a choral director!  Wish me luck.  I'm psyched...  ...at last, blissful slumber.  Sleep loose, all.

      Well, apparently somebody's reading this thing... had a friend tell me that I hadn't updated enough lately.  Here you go...:)  Another year... the LAST year of college for EB.  This has already proved to be a year of many firsts... from marching band to new roommates, it's been great.  I'm psyched, and think this year's going to be the best yet.  Hell, it can't be worse than last year!  Why does life have to be confusing?  Wouldn't it be easier if things came in easily-definable and recognizable packages?  Wouldn't it be better without all the gray areas?  Wouldn't...?  Or maybe it's that very gray area that makes life worth living... exciting... challenging... different and fresh.  Annoying and frustrating as it can be, I will take a life full of vitality and excitement any day over one that is unchanging.    What to do in the meantime, while things are still indeterminate?  keep on keepin' on, and don't act based on events that have not yet happened... no what ifs...   it's 1:11 and I have one more day of marching band preseason tomorrow... time to pass out.  send happy thoughts.  ehren confused...

      Goodbye summer, I will miss you...  today, the semester basically starts... marching band preseason begins in 45 minutes... i'm playing horn!  go figure, should be a fun experience (I hope!)  but this means that the freedom of summer has passed... for my part, this has been the best i can remember... too many people to thank, but i had so many great times... things just kept getting crazier and more random... I love it!  So, off to be absorbed into the UCMB collective and blow my face off.  Give a call and leave a message or something so I know you're all still out there.  I miss you all!  Not long now till we're all back together...

      Alright, I need to make a confession... I actually like to clean.  Now before you go flip out and tell everyone about this... hear me out.  I have to be in the right mood, and I need to have the time to do it.  The trouble is that neither of the above happen very often.  I'm a neat freak with a procrastinator streak, and the two are kind of a self-defeating combination... I want things clean, but have no motivation to keep it that way... sigh.  At any rate, most of today was spent inside here cleaning things up, taking out six bags of trash (more to come, I'm sure) and goign to church to start picking music for September for my new job!  So all is not lost.    Time for dinner.  Rehearsal at 7pm.  SC - I miss you guys.  Get your asses back to Storrs, ya hear?

      Bah.  Cleaning sucks... trying to put this apartment back together before I get sucked into the vortex of UCMB preseason next week.  I'm getting really sick of Pine-Sol and Tilex... and Tony, what the hell did you leave on your carpet?  This choco-caramelly goodness you left me as a goodbye present on the floor doesn't really set well... :)  At any rate, it seems to be coming out okay...  I'm still blown away by the craziness of what I did last weekend.  And I love it.  Need to keep that sort of thing in my repertoire...  ...back to work.  Rehearsal later tonight.

      I can't think of a better way to end a summer... this is what being young is all about... our random road trip to Indiana was the best thing I could have possibly done.  Jenny's family is apparently now an extension of mine (at least that's what they told me!), they treated Lauren and I like royalty... from random trips to Wal-Mart in evening attire to an evening of hair-dyeing (or was that all the same night??), I had the time of my life and have so many people to thank for it...  Jenny... how is it that we've spent God knows how many hours in the same choir and only got to know each other a week ago? explain that one to me???  I'm glad that trend finally stopped... you're the best!  the Williamson family for providing the most relaxing, most fun, most off-the-wall incredible time... thanks Mom and Dad!  Lauren, my roadtripping partner extraordinare... couldn't have done it without you, even if I thought I could...  we did it and we're still talking, 1800 miles later.  That's gotta count for something...  to  urlLink Krispy Kreme  for providing what Guster rightly termed "the doughnuts of the gods", and for deciding to  urlLink open a franchise in Newington, CT  in FALL 2002 (bet you didn't know that!!)...   to the city of Fort Wayne for somehow moving Coney Island to Indiana... go figure!  to the   ROOM  ... (if you were there, you know)...  thank you, Science Central!  to Joe, for reminding me that the untravelled road can be so much better...   to the FujiFilm FinePix A201 for letting us accumulate a grand total of 682 pictures without a single roll of film...  ...even the drive back was the best... swam in Lake Erie in Erie, PA... went to Niagara Falls... slept in my car in a rest area on the New York Thruway in Oneida, NY (pretty damn comfortable too, I rule!)... seven hundred or so pictures later, i'm back...  have never been so excited to be 150 miles from Boston in my life!  I could go on for hours, but I won't... here's to old friends rediscovered, new friends recently discovered, and endless possibilities with both.  I love you all.  Good night.  Sleep loose.   ...this message has been brought to you by Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto no. 2.  try it, you'll like it... ;)

      heh heh heh... well, we made it.  Lauren and I drove the 13.75213864 hours to Fort Wayne, indiana to see the best Jenny in the world and are having the time of our lives... who said Indiana was boring, anyway??  So for all of you who had to "work" and "couldn't take time off" and "would love to come but can't, so have a great time"... HAHAHAHAHA.... you should have been irresponsible.  You'll learn next time...:)  hey, it's summer, right?  You're young, right?  You've got the rest of your life to be responsible!!  well, I'm here and you're not and I'm having the time of my life and you're at home being "RESPONSIBLE" and working like the rest of the societally-brainwashed proles out there...heehehe... gotta remember to live... later all, out for more fun.  wish y'all were here!

      All right, all of you... I'm going to Indiana and you're not!  and I'm going to have fun and bring back all sorts of cool pictures and do all sorts of stuff.  and you'll all be jealous. :)  So excited... lookin forward to the biggest road trip i've EVER been on... pretty much literally bouncing off walls... if anyone has a last-minute acquisition of a sense of ADVENTURE, I'm leaving at noon tomorrow.  Email or call me asap, cause I'm kicking off as soon as I get out of work at noon.  But if all goes as i think it will, it's me and Lauren taking to the road... send out word for everyone to get the hell out of the way. :)  Keep your fingers crossed for my car, she's doing fine, but if there's ever a time for mechanical failure this is probably it.  Send on the good karma, and I'll see you all when I get back!

      I just realized that some of you may not know what that last post yesterday was referring to... it's a Sam Clemens quote.  Here it is:   Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbour. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. - Mark Twain [Samuel Langhorne Clemens] (1835-1910)

      Life is simply too short to waste.   Society tells us that things are important.  They're not. Society tells us that things don't matter.  They do. They tell us that we need this car or that brand of pants... that we can measure our worth by buying the wares that they are trying to hock. It's a load of shit. The most important thing I've got is myself.  Without that, I'm nothing. But my friends are a close second.  Maybe even a tie. Making sure I am wearing the latest in Gap fashions?  Somewhere near the bottom of page 5 on the list. But having close friends?  People I can trust?  That's worth far more than anything I could ever own. Because I don't own my friends.  I can't.  And I wouldn't want to. They're my friends because they want to be.  And that's one of the most precious things in the world. Anyone who tells you different is trying to sell you something. And they're either lying... or they really do think that our worth comes from our possessions. The question is, which is worse?    If you need me, I'll be looking for my copy of Thoreau.

      My buddy Dan introduced me to a poet a while back named Pablo Neruda.  His imagery is incredible... if I could write about why I am an artist... why I am a musician... this would be it.   POETRY  Pablo Neruda  And it was at that age...Poetry arrived in search of me. I don't know, I don't know where it came from, from winter or a river. I don't know how or when, no, they were not voices, they were not  words, nor silence, but from a street I was summoned, from the branches of night, abruptly from the others, among violent fires or returning alone, there I was without a face and it touched me.  I did not know what to say, my mouth had no way with names my eyes were blind, and something started in my soul, fever or forgotten wings, and I made my own way, deciphering that fire and I wrote the first faint line, faint, without substance, pure nonsense, pure wisdom of someone who knows nothing, and suddenly I saw the heavens unfastened and open, planets, palpitating plantations, shadow perforated, riddled with arrows, fire and flowers, the winding night, the universe.  And I, infinitesimal being, drunk with the great starry void, likeness, image of mystery, I felt myself a pure part of the abyss, I wheeled with the stars, my heart broke loose on the wind.  Dan has a blog too... check it out at  urlLink codjol.blogspot.com .

      Wow.  What an amazing birthday I had yesterday.  Made me think about some things.    Students are not some lower form of life.  We're not subhuman.  We have thoughts of our own, and ideas of our own, both of which have the potential to be on par with or better than any "adult" out there.  We make mistakes, but so do lots of people.  Never underestimate the power and ability of determined young people to get something done, frequently better and faster than "adults"... the "adults" just don't want to admit that they might not be right.    So set your ideas and visions free.  Try things.  See if they work.  Betcha you won't fall on your face as often as you think, and even if you do, you'll have friends there to pick you up.  Let art live.

      ...and the maelstrom has gotten the better of me... well, at least for today.  I'm bushed.  I feel like... well, I'm just tired.  I need to get more sleep, more regularly.  That should do the trick, right?    .......  Still not sure yet whether I will stay in class tomorrow, or just hand in the paper and leave.  I'm sick of having my time wasted in school.  Seems it's been happening my whole life, and dammit, I'm sick of it!  Teach me something useful, something interesting, something I can sink my teeth into.  I've had enough of your pedantic bullshit.  Be interesting or cancel your fucking class and give me my diploma.  I sound elitist.  I'm not.  I am just sick of waiting for something to spark me.  Sick of doing it 'their' way because they somehow know best while I waste twenty-three years of my life waiting for myself to know best.  Well, here I am.  I know me.  I may not be an expert on many things, but I know myself.  I know what I need.  Challenge me... but challenge me in something I love, and place it in the zone of proximal development (hello, Vygotsky!) so it's reachable.  And why does a school of EDUCATION not place more emphasis on hiring faculty who can actually TEACH well?  With the exception of Sally Reis, I have yet to have a single Neag (r) professor who can teach worth a damn (music ed faculty not included...).  You'd think they'd place paramount importance on wanting to lead new teachers by example, hiring and encouraging only the best pedagogues in the country... oops.  Some eminent researchers are among us.  Whoopty-friggin-doo.  What is it: "Those who can, do... those who can't, teach... those who can't even do that, do research"...?  Somebody give me a reason I should have an ounce of respect for this school of education.  I'd love one.

      Life is a maelstrom, as usual.  The difference is that this time around I seem to be not only surfing the wave... but I AM the wave.  I'm making my own opportunities and things are falling into place.    Case in point:  I got asked to be the assistant conductor of the Vernon Chorale!  What an incredible opportunity.  I'm psyched for this... it's a great choir, and I can learn a lot.    My birthday is Saturday.  I'm going to be twenty-three years old.  Somehow, I still don't feel it.  Is it possible to feel seventeen and three and twenty-five all at the same time?  Well, I do.  So either I'm doing the impossible or I'm in the same boat with everyone else...  As usual, on the run again... at least I'm being productive!  I finished a paper for my "stupid class".  I figure I should at least do that, considering it's 1/3 of my final grade, and I don't plan on returning to class after tomorrow... :)  ..off for more 'stuff'... come for a ride with me in my whirlwind, this shit's fun!

      You cannot escape your past.  It always seems to keep coming back around to you.  After all, you're a result of everything you've ever encountered, right?  Why fight it?  Lately I've been trying to ignore some problems, hoping they'd just go away.  But they keep popping up in my face, and frankly I'm sick of this ostrich approach.  I need to just try to fix things head-on.  I hope that works.    I miss my best friend.  I have no idea what happened, or why we're at odds, or even what's going on right now at all.  I'd love to patch things back together, but we're two of the most stubborn people I know.  I hope we can both yank our heads out of our asses long enough to talk like civilized human beings.  If we can do that, then there's hope.  Till then, I'm still Ehren

      y'know, one of these days i'm going to come up with a good way to start a blog entry... don't have one yet, though...  been really philosophical lately... wish there was a good bookstore around that i didn't have to drive forever and a day to get to... no, the co-op does not count... just been in a poetry-reading, contemplative, introspective, love life, hate stupid people sort of mood.  it's been nice.  though i keep wanting to find stuff to read and when i have the time, i can't think of anywhere to get it, and when i come up with the ideas, i don't have the time.  self-defeating bullshit... makes me laugh when i sit back and think about it.  feeling a bit better about teaching.  still not really okay about society, but am back into the mindset where i can ignore that and get on with life.  not really sure if that's an improvement or a loss, but there you go...  this semester makes me laugh... it's been a series of 'what instrument is ehren playing today'... i've gone from playing tuba to saxophone to recorder in less than 24 hours, with some guitar and horn in there as well... not to mention the singing thing that is my major...   talked to a friend of mine today... meggie, this one's for you... she was talking about how we always talk wistfully about how we're going to do this 'when i'm older', or 'i can't wait until i can'... well, she pointed out that today is now and now is the time, and that all those things we always waited for can happen now.  it's exciting.  so sieze the day with excess and get out there and live.  life's not a spectator sport, but if it was, this would be the time for audience participation...  these thoughts have been brought to you by the society to abolish the shift key... i'm sure you can figure out why.

      The mighty Neag School of Education is a pain in my ass.  They give us countless lectures on good instructional and assessment techniques, then condones professors who follow neither.  Save one Neag professor (Sally Reis), they've all been a waste of my time.  Classes focusing on redundant and useless material, quizzes that are about memorizing facts, not actually UNDERSTANDING the concepts (God forbid we should THINK!)... and they give us these classes at 8am!  I think I'm going to start attending British Literature so that my Tuesday and Thursday mornings don't continue to be a waste of my life.  ...are our schools really this bad?  Society's okay with this?  What did I miss?  Somebody save me.  I'm becoming jaded.

      Well, one week of school down, and I think it's gonna be a good year.  It's amazing what a fresh outlook and a good relaxing, grounding summer can do to change perspective on the school year.  I would recommend being irresponsible and carefree to anyone during break.  It's what recharges us.  I mean, REALLY... we're young!  Why shouldn't we act it?  Everyone's in such a friggin hurry to grow up, but we've got the rest of our lives to be old... so act your ages, all of you!  You hear me?  Yes, there's a time and place to act responsible.  But we shouldn't get so wrapped up in our own self-importance that we forget to sample the opposite extremes.  Anyone with me on this?

      The Callipygenics have arrived... five voices, countless overtones :)  Lauren, Dan, RJ, Teresa... you're all absolutely amazing to sing with.  I cannot believe how tight we sound.  I'm looking forward to Saturday to sing with you all.  Oh, my cold's finally gone... yay!!!  Now if I could just remember how to sing...:) yeah, that would be nice.  It's nice... I finally feel like I am on top of the maelstrom, commanding the winds... probably won't last for long, but it's nice right now!  I got a letter today from the Honors Program, informing me that I would "be returned to the regular program on October 31 UNLESS [they hear] OTHERWISE BY 12:00 NOON ON OCTOBER 31".  I thought that their form letter was nice.  Here's what I wrote back.  Sent it to pretty much everyone I could email in the Honors Program, from the director on down to the office assistants.  My letter follows:    Dear Patty, Roberta, and Marlene,  Thanks so much for your email.  I appreciate your taking the time to write to me.  Actually, if you check your records carefully, I took a graduate level class last semester, EPSY 302, which adressed the socal and emotional needs of gifted students in education.  Also, I filled out the paperwork to withdraw from the program over a year ago, but apparently that never took effect.  But that's neither here nor there.  I haven't really ever been involved with the honors program, though I did benefit from a few honors and graduate-level classes, including one English 250 my freshman year taught by a Professor Philips.  As an aside, I thoroughly enjoyed the class. Intriguingly, however, it actually did fit the mold that the Daily Campus portrayed for the Honors Program, which is to say that I received an A- for showing up to class, reading occasionally, and tossing in bits of dialogue when I saw fit.  Also, the 'required' freshman reading that year, "Amistad", was never included in the class, though it was an excellent read.  I found the program extremely inaccessible to me as a freshman music major.  The advisor you assigned me, Professor Glenn Stanley, was nice enough, but was not very well-informed about advising or the honors program.  Being from out-of-state, and a wide-eyed 'newbie' to college, I desperately needed some guidance.  The honors program gave me none.  As a result, I became disenchanted with the program in general and sought elsewhere for my guidance and inspiration.  Perhaps this is a flaw in the advising system in general, and not your fault.  At any rate, I feel you should know about the schism between the music department and the honors program.  I've never voiced this until now, so I take partial responsibility for that not changing.  I can't place blame elsewhere if I haven't tried to fix it.  I'm now at the point where I'm trying to see beyond myself, thinking that maybe I can change things for future classes... for the better.  That's why I'm writing you this letter.  In closing, I offer my hope that the honors program will reach out to all majors, and bring in minds from the School of Fine Arts as much as, say, the School of Engineering.  I feel that there's a void in research among musicians, and I know that we've got some wonderful minds here.  Please give them a haven in which they can learn, grow, and question the very precepts they've come to accept.  You never know, we might just have the next Nobel Prize winner here under our noses.  As for me, I'm doing fine.  I've simply found my enrichment elsewhere out of necessity.  I wish you all the best for the possibilities of the future.  Thanks.  Ehren Brown Music Education UConn Class of 2003  PS: Roberta or Patty, if I didn't make this clear, go ahead and take me out of the Honors Program.  I'm sure I've missed some essential criteria somewhere critical to remaining in 'good standing'.  Thanks.   ---------- I'm so witty.  Fuckers.    I leave you with this thought.

      Here's hoping my aunt Mari-Anne doesn't have some strange immunity to this that I don't... the latest in my efforts to sleep: combining Robitussin with Codeine with a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon.  She said that it knocked her out and that she slept like a baby.  I hope this works.  Otherwise I may start crying.  G'night all, I hope...

      I can't take it anymore.  Not even narcotics have helped.  I still can't sleep, and i still can't lie down without coughing.  it's taking all my restraint to not just chug this bottle of codeine-laced robitussin, reminding myself that that might just make things MUCH worse.  but i don't know what to do.  I cannot take this any more.  I'm going mad.

      Well, here goes... if this Robitussin with codeine doesn't take care of my lack of sleep problem, I may seriously need to consider finding an unscrupulous anaesthesiologist to take care of my needs.  I have taken my prescribed 2 teaspoons and cannot report any odd feelings yet.  I hope that changes.  Had a wonderful night over here at Lauren's jamming on guitar with a bunch of people... wish I could sing again!  'Twill come back soon enough, I suppose.  It's nice being in her world for a change instead of always having her in mine.    Would that my body would relax enough to let me breathe and sleep and NOT cough.  I would be forever grateful.  This entire week has blipped by faster than I could keep track of... I can barely remember much of it at all.  I miss my life.  I'd like it back, please.  I wonder how long codeine takes to kick in?

      I'm feeling run down - the direct result of barely sleeping for two nights in a row.  The problem is that whenever I get near a horizontal position (generally considered to be the best position for sleeping by 9 out of 10 sleepers) I start coughing.  I'll spare you the details, but it's sure hard to sleep with all that going on.  Maybe I should find some ether.

I may, however, have the beginnings of a sinus infection, which I need to get checked out tomorrow.  Or I may just have a nasty cold.  More details as the story develops.

      I'm really getting tired of being sick.  Thank God for Lauren... she's been taking care of me these last few nights while I stay up coughing and hacking.  I have vague recollections of getting my back rubbed or being brought to the shower at 2am, all of which is basically a blur.  But the one thing I remember through all of it is her being there, trying somehow to make it all better.  So, thanks, Laur... more than I can express.  You've made me feel loved and cared for.  It's a nice thing to feel when you feel like crap.  I don't know what I'd do without you.

      This damn cold.... still hanging on tenaciously, like a drunk freshman co-ed to a frat boy on a saturday night.  I wish I could just shake it.  It's messing up everything, and I have to run double-time just to keep up.  Camping was amazing, though.  Cold as hell, but the rain held off!  While the rest of New England was expecting to see an ark sail by, some hurricane down south messed up the weather pattern enough to blow out the rain for the most part.  So the trip was not in vain!  My new tent held out well, too.  Not very warm, but for October in Downeast Maine I think it did pretty well.  ...oh, and a big hearty "pbbtthhhhhh!" to professors who think that they don't have to be personable to their students... that's right, kiddies, you know who I'm talkin' bout... didn't your mamma tell you to be nice to people smaller than you?

Going camping this weekend in Maine at Acadia... such wonderful weather for it!  ...Right.  I'm sure it's wonderful for a cold too... Keep your fingers crossed, and pray for a leakproof tent!  This is my first trip out with my new one. I wonder how it will fare?

      Hey, so it's been a while since I last wrote.  Things are going well, at breakneck speed as usual.  No broken necks yet though... :)    I am in seven (7) choral ensembles this semester.  Wow.  What an incredible time I'm having.  I'm enjoying this last semester of classes, gleaning what I can and what I want to from classes and extracurriculars alike... in fact I have been redefining my personal concepts of "class" and extracurricular activity"... I am finding that I get equal benefits from each.  One intertwines with the other.  What I do in class is reinforced in an ensemble, and ensemble experiences and techniques are expounded upon and honed in class.  It's a nice combo.  Krispy Kreme is open in Newington.  The day has arrived.  I'm making a road trip with Mark after choir... hope the line's not too long!  I'm gonna miss this college sheeat... I wonder how all my graduated pals are doing out in the real world right now?  Oh well.  It'll all come soon enough.  Right now I can't think of a single place I'd rather be or a single thing I'd rather be doing.  I'm among my best friends making some of the most amazing music of my life.  What more could I possibly ask for?  I'll come back with more stories soon.  Till then, I'm still ehren

      Thanksgiving break is upon us, and Storrs looks like a ghost town.  You'd think I'd be used to that after this summer.  Oh well.  Taking Lauren to St. Mary's Hospital in Waterbury tomorrow to get her IV thingy in her arm.  God willing, this will kick her Lyme disease in the rear once and for all.  I wish I could help in some other way.  My heart goes out to her, and I know there's no way I can help.  I'm just glad I can get her to someone who can.  Time for sleep.  Mom and Dad are coming tomorrow!  Then Thanksgiving dinner here on Thursday and on to New York City for the weekend.  I'm psyched.

I'm in that in-between state where I don't want to sleep but don't really have the energy to do much else.  Lauren's back!  I'm so happy about that.  I wish I had the energy to match her zest for life right now.  Today I'm just tired.  Early music club tonight at Paul's at 8pm.  Come one, come all...

      Yet again, another wonderfully relaxing night.  Played Trivial Pursuit Genus 5 (did you even know they had made that many editions?!?)  Drank slowly but surely starting around 4 when I got home from my last Praxis exam - my buddy Mark Erskine always said they knew how to drink better in the South than we damn Yankees... I think he's right.  None of this binge drinking crap - just a nice slow buzz, exactly what I needed after a friggin day of testing that felt like someone sucked all my brainpower out of my head through my forehead.    Yet something's still missing.  I haven't seen Lauren in almost a week.  So hard.  I'm glad she's coming back today!  On the run - need to get ready for church.  Yay Sundays...

      You heard it here first:  The PRAXIS: Professional Assessments for Beginning Teachers are a joke.  My morning of testing was actually quite fun, and I'm looking forward to going back at 2:15 to kick the second part's ass as well.  It's all in how you look at it, and I stand by my tried-and-true method of simply laughing at testing in general.  It's a lot more fun, and you're pretty much guaranteed to perform better on that exam.  Why?  Because you're relaxed.  Last night was wonderful, just what I've needed after a long week... and especially the night before a "big" test.  I relaxed here at the apartment with Chris, Dan, Leila, Natalie, and Justin.  Fran and Emily were here but were holed up in Fran's room.  We had a few drinks, listened to good music, and told stories.  Boring, you say?  Quite the opposite.  I spend so much time rushing through life, that I sometimes forget to just slow down and reflect on everything.  And reflect I did last night.  I think I wrote to Lauren at least three times last night, and talked to her on the phone once or twice (can't remember which).  Not bad for one evening.  Was it exciting?  Maybe not.  But it was just what I needed.  Sometimes I feel like the luckest guy in the world.  I have a whole lot of friends, as well as several of those whom I would consider "close" friends... I have a loving and supportive family... I am poised to start a career teaching and making music - my first love... I have an amazing girlfriend in Lauren, who shares several of my passions and opens me up to new ones, helps me to see the world through different eyes, and is always there for me... and although I still have so much to learn (thank God!), I am good at what I do, and people are starting to notice and recognize this.  So even though I might gripe and moan about things sometimes, when I really think about it, I've got it pretty good.  So, I feel lucky.  And to all those of you who have helped me get where I am today, thank you.  I would not be where I am, or who I am, without your presence in my life.    ...time to relax the brain before the next stint of testing.  ehren out.

      It is now Friday night.  And what am I doing?  Not hanging out with friends.  Not partying with CDN.  No, I'm in my room, winding down from a long week because... WHY?  I have not one, but TWO (count em) exams tomorrow.  And not just any exams, no no no no.  These tell the state of Connecticut whether I'm competent enough to teach music to their promising youth.  Which we all know is a load of horse shit.  Of course you can know how competent someone is by a test.  Fuckers.  And I haven't studied a whit.  And don't plan to.  Unless you count the last five years I've spent here learning exactly what it is that they have the audiacity to ask me if I can actually do.  You think they take the time to come really see who I am?  Hell no.  I think your exam's a farce, and I'm going to twist it upside down until you think I'm the best friggin music teacher you've ever seen in your stupid little lives.  And I'm going to do it all laughing, with a smile on my face.  Whaddaya think of that, hm?  Lauren's still sick - I wish I could help.  At least she's in good (albeit odd for me) hands... I know she'll want for nothing.  Relaxation, good doctor, all happy stuff.  I think she's going to get the pick line in her arm so she can kick this ol' Lyme Disease (Yay, Connecticut!) in the ass right out of her body once and for all.  I hope.  I miss her.  Hope she comes home soon.  That's all for now.  Ehren out.

      I just had my last concert with the University of Connecticut Festival Chorus.  It was an amazing experience, and one I will remember for a long time to come.  I have many things to say to many people, but here is not the place.  If you're in that choir, though... know that I will miss you all terribly next semester and that I expect to not lose touch with you all!  I'm still reeling.  Amazing doesn't even begin to describe it.  Thank you, Festival Chorus.  Thank you, UConn.  And thank you, Dr. Bagley.  The chorus has been the one constant in 5 years of transition.  You've always been there, and I'm not really certain what I'll do when I'm gone.

      Well, it's Saturday night.  I've slept all afternoon after a choir dress rehearsal that was far too early for a Saturday (ie. 9am...) and have accomplished next to nothing, though I have cleaned my room and honed my skills on Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.     urlLink CDN  had an amazing concert last night.  Rubyfruit opened for us and was nothing short of sensational, as usual.  The concert was in one of the new reading rooms (room 109) in Wilbur Cross last night, an untapped (till now) venue for performing.  I am certain it will not be the last after last night, though.  The room was amazing, the guys sang their hearts out, and I left with chills.  Watching the guys last night made me realize for the first time that CDN will indeed continue on after I graduate.  I've never been certain of that till now, and it's really a nice feeling - knowing that I helped start a group like this, and wondering what lies in store for the new guys after I've left the scene.  I'll be watching you all... :)  Going to go finish (FINALLY!) watching "Amelie" with Lauren.  Church and a choir concert tomorrow.  Ehren out.

      Well now... and I thought my travel bug was gone after all the places I went this summer... but no!  So I'm off on another trip: Lauren and I are heading to San Diego to visit my aunt.  Yay Southwest Airlines and their cheap fares...:)  We're going over winter break in mid-January.  Should be a blast -- though I don't know what the weather will be like, it's pretty much guaranteed to be warmer than here!  Well, off to class.  I should probably wake up too and put on some decent clothes instead of this towel.

      2 days of driving later, and we finally made it.  More people this time, and we're all at Jenny's in Fort Wayne, Indiana... !!!  There's 8 of us: myself, Lauren, Dan, Leila, Teresa, Clayton, Ali, and Tony.  Stayed in a Holiday Inn last night in Clearfield, PA - all sorts of randomness thus far...  I'm sure there will be more to come.  But for now, I'm out.

      And another update - I'm done with classes, exams, recital hearings... just one more easy paper to write and it's all past me.  It's nice to be able to relax.  My recital hearing went well, if anyone's wondering.  I'll find out at 5pm how I did, but I'll be shocked if this crashes and burns now.

      This just in - over the CMEA wire.  Some serious food for thought, I think... ----------------------------   Legislation won't make children learn     By David Finley   Dec. 10, 2002   Educators know the truth but are afraid to say it: All children cannot learn.  I am an educator, and in my profession it is a mortal sin to say that all children cannot learn. Now that I have said it publicly, I will probably lose my job and be excommunicated from my profession. At the very least I am certain it will give Arizona's state superintendent of public instruction a bad case of heartburn.   Perhaps I can redeem myself by rephrasing the statement: All children can learn but all children cannot learn as much as all other children. And all children cannot learn to some preset state or federal standard, as is currently mandated by the No Child Left Behind Act and Arizona Learns legislation.   I am principal of a school the state has labeled "underperforming." Does this embarrass me? Not in the least. The label is a misnomer. Schools are simply brick and mortar. They do not perform, over or under. The label really means that the school's instructional staff is underperforming. Since I know that the teachers at my school are effective, dedicated professionals who are actually "overperforming," I am not the least bit embarrassed by being mislabeled as a result of this ridiculous legislation.   Color me defensive if you must, but I believe labeling schools is nothing more than name-calling, something most of us learned not to do in kindergarten. Labeling schools will not improve them and actually runs counter to the intended purpose.   The goal of the law is admirable and sounds great to voters. Schools will be held accountable to ensure that all children learn and succeed; the achievement gap between poor and rich kids will magically disappear; and no child will be left behind. The only phrase missing is that everyone will live happily ever after.   Like the emperor in the classic fairy tale, the No Child Left Behind Act has no clothes, but no one is saying so. The punitive nature of the legislation is forcing teachers to teach to a test instead of teaching children; consequently, there may be a superficial rise in test scores. However, for solving the problem of low achievement by at-risk children, it is tantamount to putting a Band-Aid on a headache.   Saying that "all" children must achieve to a predetermined standard on a test is like saying that all children in physical education classes must run a six-minute mile on a physical fitness exam. And saying that all children must show one year's academic growth for one year in school is like saying that all children in the school lunch program must gain 10 pounds and grow 2 inches in one year.  Children are not created equal in athletic ability or physical characteristics. Neither are they created equal in their ability to learn. Any first-year teacher knows this; apparently politicians do not. They have created a law that is focused on fixing the schools and just possibly the schools aren't broken.   I am not saying the schools are perfect or that we cannot improve. And I firmly believe that the education profession must be held accountable for what it does. But this is true of every profession, including law and medicine.   The professional educator, however, seems to be at the bottom of the food chain. Unlike any other profession, we are constantly asked to do more with less. And politicians, who say things that are politically expedient but not educationally realistic, relentlessly criticize us. Doctors and lawyers are never subject to such political philandering and shortsighted legislation.   Doctors are not required by law to cure all their patients. It is acknowledged that there are circumstances with each patient that are unique. Some patients will not follow their doctor's instructions; some simply have illnesses that cannot be cured.   Lawyers are not required by law to win all their cases. It is recognized that every client has a unique set of circumstances that will directly affect their attorney's ability to bring them success in court.   Teachers, on the other hand, do not fare so well with lawmakers. The law ignores the fact that schools in the low-income areas serving predominantly at-risk children have much higher percentages of children with special "medical problems and legal circumstances." Under the threat of a "failing label" teachers must cure every child irrespective of his or her illness; win every case in the courthouse of the classroom no matter the legal circumstance of the child.   In the Emperor's New Clothes, it takes a small child to tell the truth and bring the adults to their senses. Maybe our legislators need to come into the "underperforming" schools. They might learn some things they did not know before. Perhaps this would bring about some responsible legislation aimed at solving some of our problems instead of creating new ones, such as an exodus of quality teachers from the at-risk schools, where they are needed most.   Fairy tales usually have a happy ending, but I fear not with this one.  --------------------------- What do you think?  Send thoughts to  urlLink ehrenbrown@letterboxes.org

      Yikes - the week's finally over.  This past week has been a long month.  It's the end of semester, end of college classes, and I've got a nasty case of senioritis.  I just want to get through all this crap and be done and relax.  Plus, I'm in enough concerts in the next week to choke a horse.  Which, by the way, I saw last night.  Went sledding after the Rubyfruit Invitational, which didn't turn out to be an invitational at all.  Their guest group cancelled on account of snow, and CDN stepped in on short notice.  We had a blast and presented two very loose and informal sets.  I swore like a sailor on stage, for some reason.  But we all had fun.  And that's what it's all about.  So, the sledding.  It was the first time I've ever gone sledding on this campus in the 5 years I've been here.  Can you believe that?  I went out with Lauren, Leila, Dan, Meaghan, and Pat.  We went out to Horsebarn Hill and found a hill with horses.  They ambled out of the way when we went down, and came back to socialize when we were stopped at the bottom.  So, I touched them and patted them and talked to them and sang to them.  I think they just hoped I had an apple.  But we had fun, the horses and the sledding and I.  I am tired.  Mentally and physically, I'm beat.  I suppose we all are, at this point.  But I don't think any of us can possibly be at our best when we're all feeling like this, can we?    If anybody needs me, I'll still be searching for a pause button.  Come to think of it, I may need some seriously stronger batteries for my remote.  Ehren out.

      I think that this article is absolutely on the mark - so much so that most people will vehemently deny its validity because of the chance that all the ideas they hold true might collapse in one burst of enlightenment.  Read it and decide for yourself.    U.S. continues war against common sense  By Joshua Levinson - Daily Campus, University of Connecticut     "This is Stacey. This is the dime bag that Stacey bought. This is the dealer who sold the dime bag that Stacey bought. This is the supplier that smuggled the pot to the dealer who sold the dime bag that Stacey bought. And this is Carla, who was hit by a stray bullet from Stacey's supplier and paralyzed for life. Drug money supports terrible things. If you buy drugs, you might too."  This is just one example of a new wave of drug commercials by the Office of Drug Control Policy (ODCP) that prey on the fear of terrorism. Aside from being misleading and dishonest, some of the commercials are so lacking in any sort of common sense or factual information that one can only wonder why they were created at all.  In another commercial, we see two men sitting at a table, discussing how drug money supports terrorism. One of them, clearly the sensible one (you can tell he's smart because he's wearing glasses), says that drug money supports terror: it's a fact. The other one, clearly lacking in moral fiber, says, "Let's say I buy some dope. Now how much of my money actually makes it into the bad guy's hands? A couple of bucks. Peanuts." The first man (remember, he knows what he's talking about) replies, "So what you're saying is that it's okay to support terrorism... a little."  Now, let's say for a minute that we forget that even the ODCP itself admits that marijuana comes primarily from Mexico and, in some lesser extent, Canada and the United States itself (we are assuming that by drugs, they mean marijuana, since it's the only drug they seem to have commercials about anymore).  You want some real facts on funding terrorism? In 1982, Iraq had just been removed from the list of states supporting terrorism, despite evidence that this wasn't true. The Reagan administration then proceeded to give Iraq billions of dollars and military intelligence so that they could win the war with Iran. "CIA Director Casey personally spearheaded the effort to ensure that Iraq had sufficient military weapons, ammunition and vehicles to avoid losing the Iran-Iraq war."  Am I making this up? Unfortunately, no. This information is all from a sworn affidavit of Howard Teicher, a member of Reagan's National Security Council at the time.  In other words, the United States provided the weaponry and intelligence that Iraq used to win the war with Iran, subsequently, to invade Kuwait, which lead to fighting and the killing of American soldiers.  So, who supports terrorism? Our government. I've got a new idea for a commercial: "This is Josh. Josh pays his taxes. This is the IRS, where a percentage of funds are taken from Josh's taxes and given to the government. This is the government, who gave Iraq billions of dollars in aid and military intelligence in order to win the Iran-Iraq war. This is Saddam Hussein, who used the aid in order to kill American soldiers in the Persian Gulf War. Tax money supports terrible things. If you pay taxes, you might too."  Does this sound outlandish? It shouldn't, because, sadly, it contains far more truth then the commercials branding people who smoke marijuana as terrorists. Worse yet, another wave of commercials depicts "potheads" in different scenarios, each playing out a different tragedy.   In one, a car full of people smoking marijuana at a drive-thru, order food they can't afford. (And just who, exactly, is stupid enough to do this in broad daylight?) They realize they don't have any money and freak out, subsequently peeling out and driving over an innocent little girl.  In another commercial, two kids are smoking marijuana in one of their parents' rooms. One of the kids pulls out a gun, but says it isn't loaded. Whoops! Looks like somebody got shot in the face. Yet another death avoidable if only they hadn't gotten high, right?  Finally, we have a couple of teenage kids sitting on a sofa. The girl hands the boy a joint and seemingly passes out. Then, he decides to lean over and sexually assault her (grab her breast, in this case). In each of these cases, the camera fades out to the word "Harmless?"  Now, as much as we all know that "potheads" are a bunch of date-raping, child-murdering, friend-shooting, terrorist-funding communists who spend their spare time overthrowing the government, I'm beginning to wonder where, exactly, these ideas came from. If the U.S. government must insist on pouring billions of dollars into a "war" that will never be won, no matter how much they sit around and make things up about marijuana, then at least have the decency to use a little thing we call "facts."  Nobody ever said marijuana was harmless. But you don't see any commercials with drunk drivers running over little girls, do you? Of course not. Yet this is an infinitely more likely scenario. So what happens when people begin to realize that none of these scenarios are based on anything even remotely resembling a fact? What happens when kids begin to realize that they know people who smoke marijuana and it doesn't make them bad people? When they realize people who smoke pot don't fund terrorism, or rape girls, or shoot their friends in the face?  We should no longer tolerate this flood misinformation and dishonesty from our government. They give Iraq and Afghanistan billions of dollars in aid and then act like it's a bunch of hippies' fault? C'mon, give us a little more credit than that. The next time the ODCP tells you that everytime someone buys a dime bag, they are supporting terrorism, who are you going to believe?

      It's late January, almost time for my last semester of classes at UConn.  It's time for student teaching, and all the fun that comes with that.    And it's also time to ask myself: why the hell would I want to live somewhere that gets so damn cold during the winter?    I just got back from an amazing trip to San Diego with Lauren.  The weather was beautiful, hovering around 70 degrees the entire trip.  Palm trees everywhere.  Short sleeves and sandals.  In JANUARY.  It's the answer to my dreams.  So it's time for Ehren to do some homework.  I need to figure out if moving there would be feasible.  And also if I could get a job in a school system that wouldn't just fire me in 6 months because of the budget crunch.  But I figure that I've always been able to do pretty much whatever I want to, if I keep at it.  Why stop now?  More info as this story develops.  Ehren out.

      Thoughts to ponder from the late choral master, Robert Shaw:  "In a world of political, economic, and personal disintegration, music is not a luxury but a necessity, not simply because it is therapeutic nor because it is the "universal language," but because it is the persistent focus of man's intelligence, aspiration, and good will."

      All my travels are done, at least for another week.  From more Christmases than I can count to an amazing formal (and catered!) New Years' party at Meaghan's place in Madison, and a 14-hour road trip to Fort Wayne, Indiana somewhere in between... well, I'm just plumb tuckered out.  It's nice to sit at home and just waste time.  I don't think I can remember the last time I stayed up this late!  Life is wonderful.  I look around and see so much love, so much life... and realize how much opportunity and potential I have.  I can literally do anything I want with my life.  I'm excited by that.  California in less than a week!  I'm psyched for sun and warmth for a change... AND not having to drive to get there!  Thank you, Southwest Airlines.  Lauren and I are doing great.  Really great.  She's a pain in my ass sometimes, and I'm a pain in hers, and somehow we make each others' lives better just by being there with each other, and also by doing and saying a million other little things that nobody can count or measure... but without which life just isn't the same.  So, Laur, for that I thank you.  You know what I mean.

      Man, this is scary...  I dyed my hair back to its original color of dark brown.  Well, as close as you can get, I think.  I think it came out a little darker than it was.  Though the whole thing is odd to me - it's been a year and a half with blond hair on top.    In fact, I'm sure it's darker.  Fuuuuuck...  Well, I guess there's nothing I can do about it now.  Laur says it looks good.  I wonder if she's just being nice?  I hope not.  Meeting with Mark tomorrow at 11am to discuss Vernon Chorale stuff.  I'm conducting one piece with the large choir, and three (!) with the smaller chamber group he's about to create.  Plus, I'm running the entire rehearsal on Tuesday night.  By myself.  I'm stoked.  And more than a little bit nervous.  Man, I need to plan so I don't waste these people's time...  Off and running again.  But for now, I'm going to relax enjoy the rest of the evening with my Lauren.  I'll worry tomorrow.

      What a beautiful day.  I napped for several hours this morning on Lauren's bed in a warm sunbeam, then walked home across campus.  I don't think my anti-winter views will change much, but it's sure nice to have such a beautiful day.  I'm headed out for now.    King's Singers are on campus - performing a convocation at 2 and a concert at Jorgensen at 7:30 tonight.  Hot Seat tickets are $5 for students.  Don't miss them if you can possibly help it.  You'll thank me later.

      Lauren and I share what is perhaps the most wonderful and the oddest relationship I have ever been in.  Sometimes we just don't communicate well.  And then sometimes everything just falls into place, like it did tonight.  Dinner plans fell through, so we each did our own things.  And it was fine.  That's the kind of independence I need sometimes.  Today was great.  I think that's all I have to say for now.

       urlLink from Rilke - Letters to a Young Poet - Letter 7   We know little, but that we must trust in what is difficult is a certainty that will never abandon us; it is good to be solitary, for solitude is difficult; that something is difficult must be one more reason for us to do it.   It is also good to love: because love is difficult. For one human being to love another human being: that is perhaps the most difficult task that has been entrusted to us, the ultimate task, the final test and proof, the work for which all other work is merely preparation. That is why young people, who are beginners in everything, are not yet capable of love: it is something they must learn. With their whole being, with all their forces, gathered around their solitary, anxious, upward-beating heart, they must learn to love.

      I don't want to talk to anyone - and I want everyone to come over.  Life can be a self-contradicting bastard like that.  I feel like shutting out the world and not coming out until June.  If you see me in the next few days and I seem listless or depressed, at least you'll be expecting it.  I'll find my way out eventually.  And I'm pretty much convinced that the events of the past 24 hours occurred as they had to occur.  But damn.  Sometimes everything is perfect and you still lose.  I'll never figure that out.  I think it fits into the cosmic scheme somewhere with all those people in third world countries working in sweatshops for pennies a day being exploited by Western business.  I don't understand why that is allowed to happen, either.  And nobody ever will.  If anyone wants me, I'll be searching desperately for my mind.

      So today was my first snow day as a teacher... and what did I do?  I slept until 2pm or so, then sat around the apartment and have done pretty much nothing all day.  I love it.  I'm still planning my post-graduation trip to Hawaii.  Right now it's looking like it will be about a month long, and I will be staying primarily in hostels using public transportation and the like to get around.  Some people seem to advocate hitchhiking throughout the islands... I'm not sure how I feel about that.  There's this whole stigma that comes with it that we get planted in us from the time we're young:  it's dangerous, dumb, definitely not safe, you can get kidnapped... and there may very well be a lot of truth in that.  I'll play it as it goes, I think.  I am going to need a good pack for the trip.  The hiking boots I have should hold up for the trip, so I shouldn't need much else.  Lauren went home for the weekend.  So I get to do lots more of nothing tomorrow and get some guy time.  My roommates are the best.  People just showed up at the apartment.  I think I'm going to go be social.  Ehren out.

      Joshua Levinson is my new hero.  Read on, friends...     U.S. Empire wages unjust war  By Joshua Levinson - Daily Campus, University of Connecticut     I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of Tyranny.  I'm sure you've heard all the arguments. You've heard that Saddam Hussein refuses to cooperate with the United Nations. You've heard that there are purported links between the al-Qaida terrorist organization and Hussein's regime. You've heard Bush telling you that, regardless of the U.N.'s final decision, we will use aggression as necessary. So when, exactly, did America stop being a crusader of freedom and start becoming a tyrannical empire?  First of all, why is it that we're about to go to war with Iraq while North Korea recently reactivated their nuclear reactor, which is more than capable of creating nuclear weapons in a matter of months? North Korea already has a much larger, better-armed military than Iraq, with biological and chemical weapons, not to mention their admitted nuclear development program (which, I remind you, is in direct violation of their treaty with the U.S.). On top of this, reports from former political prisoners in North Korea's work camps speak of torture, genocide and even infanticide in detail.  But why should we care about North Korea, right? It's not like they've got a bunch of oil under there. Not only is this foreign policy hypocritical, almost all of the evidence I've found indicates that our own government is a far more dangerous regime than Saddam Hussein's. For instance, George W. himself has stated that any country that harbors, aids or trains terrorists is a terrorist state itself. Of course, this excludes America, home to Fort Benning, Georgia's Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation (WHISC), known as the School of Americas (SOA) up until two years ago. The SOA is a military training facility for Latin Americans which has graduated over 60,000 soldiers and policemen.  Among the graduates: Manuel Noriaga (former Panamanian Colonel who was on the payroll of the CIA and Pentagon, as well as indicted on drug trafficking, racketeering and money laundering), Byron Lima Estrada (Guatemalan Colonel convicted of killing Bishop Juan Gerardi, who helped write a report on Guatemala's D-2 Intelligent Agency, which annihilated 448 Mayan villages and killed tens of thousands of their own people), Colonel Pablo Belmar (implicated in the torture and murder of U.N. official Carmelo Soria), General Hernan Jose Guzman Rodriguez (aided Colombian death squad "MAS", which was responsible for at least 149 deaths), and General Hector Gramajo (created genocidal policies that included rape, murder, torture and displacement of hundreds of thousands of people in Guatemala).  Although the WHISC claims that all ties with the SOA have been cut, just two years ago a Colombian SOA graduate was convicted of complicity in the torture and killing of 30 citizens. After the civil war in El Salvador, after 75,000 people were killed, the U.N. Truth Commission came out with a list of the soldiers who had committed the worst atrocities: two-thirds of them were SOA graduates.  This is all just the tip of the iceberg, as the SOA Watch (http://www.soaw.org/new) points out. In fact, after immense pressure, in 1996 the government released just seven of their training manuals for the SOA, which "recommended blackmail, torture, execution and the arrest of witnesses' relatives."  What I'm basically saying is that the U.S. is responsible for educating and training terrorists. So don't tell me that Hussein has purported "connections" with the al-Qaida while we train people who go on to run death squads and annihilate thousands of innocent people every year.  For the past 10 years, we have continued air strikes on Iraq for violating U.N. sanctions, which cripple their economy on a daily basis. According to UNICEF, the U.N.'s Children's Fund, over 4,000 children are dying every month in Iraq because of sanctions imposed by the U.N. How, exactly, does killing little children qualify as disarming Saddam Hussein? Do you think Hussein's "evil regime" is feeling the effects in their palaces? It just reinforces their hatred for us. Why should the people of Iraq support us when we continually deny them food and medicine?  Furthermore, documents in the Defense Intelligence Agency show that the U.S., despite the Geneva Convention, intentionally destroyed Iraq's water supply, which would, of course, kill more civilians including children. Sanctions put on chemicals keep Iraqis from being able to purify their water, and because of it, innocent people die every day.  Iraqis aren't the only ones who are suffering. In Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the U.S. houses a prison that holds 620 terrorist suspects from over 40 countries.  Unfortunately for them, because we captured them during peacetime, the U.S. won't declare them prisoners of war and entitle them to the rights of the Geneva Convention.  Despite Amnesty International and other "watchdog" groups pressuring the government to charge them or let them go, the U.S. seemingly has no plans of doing such a thing. The prisoners' futures remains uncertain.   The more I think about it, the more ashamed I've become to call myself American. Not because of our hypocritical foreign policy, or even the atrocities that our government commits, but because when I look around, I see so many blind nationalists so prepared to wage a war they know nothing about. This war isn't about liberals or Democrats. It's not about chemical or nuclear weapons. It's not even about fundamental human rights. It's about the same thing every war is about: politics.  The really sad part is, after Bush goes ahead, attacks Iraq and overthrows Saddam Hussein, the American people are going to mindlessly re-elect him to another term so he can finish waging the war against terrorism. Maybe if we're looking for terrorism, we're looking in the wrong place.

      Dan Allison's 4 Rule System for Helping Men Survive Menstration  1) Never discuss anything complicated.  Keep conversation to friendly banter and/or the weather. 2) Never indicate that you yourself are upset or suffering in any way, shape, or form.  This tends to set the woman off about how lucky you have it. 3) Always agree.  If she says your mother is a whore and you should have your balls squeezed in a vice and massaged with a cactus, agree whole-heartedly.  It's far better than arguing, because you'll lose. 4) If you find yourself in any serious trouble, the best thing to do is to stop talking altogether, responding with head nods, or "mmm hmmm"s.  If possible, leave.

      It's Monday morning - and I'm heading to King Philip Middle School in West Hartford today to see Marc Kaplan again.  I am a bit apathetic about this week right now, though I am sure that will fade in an hour or two.  Right now I am just tired.    CDN sang a gig last night at Rome Ballroom in South Campus.  Those guys always amaze me with our ability to bond together and make music at a level beyond what we ever did in rehearsal.  This semester has been a nasty one - people have left, one new guy has decided not to show up at rehearsals and not tell us anything about it, one old guy has been missing quite a few rehearsals as well... and the music went on.  We're stronger for it.  But this crap is ridiculous.  We need to cut our losses and jettison anyone holding us back.  Just who fits into that category remains to be seen.  I suppose that's all the thought I have energy for at the moment.  I'm still kicking - anyone know of any jobs that will be open in the fall?

      Nobody should have to put musical notation into Microsoft Word.  Or someone should make an easier way to do it.  There's got to be a better way to make a general music worksheet.  It should not take an hour to set it up so it looks good.  What a pain in the ass.

      The unthinkable has happened... a pause in my maelstrom.  Such a cool word, maelstrom.  It's Thursday, 5pm - and I've been here for two hours.  Two more to go as well before CDN tonight.  I can't believe my good fortune.    I feel a lot better than I did a week or two ago.  Though I am very run down, much more frequently than I would like.  I have no idea how I'm still achieving everything that I am.  Apparently the "sheer will" approach is a bit more effective than I ever thought possible.  Student teaching is really going well... I'm working harder than I ever have in my life, and as a result those kids don't know what's hit them.  I'm not giving most of them a chance to talk or act out... as a result things are really working out for me.  There's so much more going on, but I'm just not in a blogging mood apparently.  I'll get back into this soon, I think.

      Lauren's having such a bad night.  I feel pretty bad myself, but not like this.  I wish I could help.  Laur, if you read this, know someone's thinking of you, ok?  I'll be on my end of campus trying to keep myself from hacking up a lung - all the while knowing that if the blasted thing DOES come hurtling up, you'll somehow materialize to catch it before it lands unceremoniously on the floor.  Now THAT'S love.  And it goes both ways.  Sleep loose, LJ.  Sleep loose.

      Okay - I'm going to make it.  But damn, am I busy.  Sunday is mine.  What's that, you say?  It's the Sabbath and it belongs to the Lord?  Not this week it doesn't.  Sunday belongs to me.  And I'm going to be in my apartment after church gets over putting my life back in order.    I need to stop booking things in like this.  I may cancel my dentist appointment for March 15th just so I can have that weekend to unwind.  I'm sick of traveling everywhere all the time.  I never thought I would say that - ever.  But it's not so much the doing as it is the lack of time for anything else.  I think if you do anything for too long with nothing else, it gets old and frustrating.  That's what's happening here.    Lauren's been great through all of this.  She's been getting a little frustrated with me having no time, but she knows where I'm coming from.  I think it helps that both of us see an end to this madness.  I don't think I would be doing as well as I am without her to make me feel better when I need it.  I miss my apartment and my roommates.  I miss Lauren.  I miss Lauren being here.  And I miss those times I could just be here with time to kill.  If this is what growing up's all about, I may need to reconsider.  Student teaching is going well.  I feel a bit out in left field sometimes, with me running choirs and no Joe in there to catch me or assist with problems.  Like today - choir 7-1 was horrible with their behavior, and I don't really know yet what I can and cannot do for punishment.  I suppose I will figure it out.  It went okay.  Lots of snow outside.  I wish it would just keep on snowing through tomorrow morning.  I could really use a real day off.    But like I said, I'm a long way from being defeated.  Takes a lot to lay me on my ass, and I'll keep on fighting till I can't push any more.  I just wish I wasn't always so tired.  If you can spare a minute, send a quick email to Lauren at wildefrost@yahoo.com and tell her how great she is.  Oh, and tell her I told you to do that, too.  :)

      a few brief words before i retire to my bed-haven...  student teaching is going very well.  my teacher, joe, is very demanding, and very good.  and he's giving me lots of time to make mistakes, which i am making, but i'm also making a lot of progress, and doing well.  and the kids seem to like me, and they will work for me.  all of which is very good for ehren.  i am sure i will post more to this in days to come, my days at school have a lot of free time.  vernon chorale went well tonight.  finally got a chance to start work on my piece, two love songs, by robert young.  beautiful music.  i am very excited.  lauren and i are doing splendiforously.  we think as one mind.  quite cool when you think about it.  sometimes i'm a typical guy and that freaks me out.  usually it's just the best thing in the world.  what, me, a typical commitment-fearing guy?  well, apparently even i am not immune.  all will work itself out.  love conquers most.  and this will be no exception.  who knows what the future holds?  i think only dreams and possibility.  what a wonderful time in my life.  for the first time in a long while, this blogger entry has been brought to you by the society to abolish the shift key.  it's been a long time waiting for its return.  the society members will be happy.

      So Bob McGray from Lebanon Middle School is coming to observe me on Wednesday at Sedgwick.  I'm getting a vibe at this point that he really likes me, and have consequently been wondering if Lebanon Middle School is the place for me.  I'm starting to think that it just might work really well.  It's really exciting to have someone want to hire me.  I just wish Ellington and West Hartford would interview me for their respective jobs as well.  I'd like options if possible, and I'm still not convinced that I wouldn't just love to have a high school job, however much I enjoy middle school.  Things will work out as they see fit, I suppose, and everything happens for a reason, I know.  This waiting is just nerve-wracking.

      Here's another old thought for me, first picked up during my first trip to San Francisco two years ago.  Jack London has become sort of a hero for me, with his sprit of adventure and need to live life to the fullest.  Below is what people have termed his 'credo'.  It's become mine as well, in some ways.  I would rather be ashes than dust! I would rather that my spark should burn out in a brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dry-rot. I would rather be a superb meteor, every atom of me in magnificent  glow, than a sleepy and permanent planet. The proper function of man is to live, not to exist. I will not waste my days trying to prolong them. I will use my time.

Read outside overlooking Mansfield Hollow Lake sitting on top of my car for about an hour, had a nice heart-to-heart with Lauren later on, and I got my copy of F-Zero that I ordered from EBay.  I am considering applying for a passport really soon in case I can travel abroad, though I'm still unsure what the hell to do on that account.  This summer is so up in the air!  Sooooo frustrating...  Somebody give me a job!  I want to goof off.  Night all.

      This from the archives... pretty much explains how I'm feeling right now with regard to my disaster-area room:   Alright, I need to make a confession... I actually like to clean. Now before you go flip out and tell everyone about this... hear me out. I have to be in the right mood, and I need to have the time to do it. The trouble is that neither of the above happen very often. I'm a neat freak with a procrastinator streak, and the two are kind of a self-defeating combination... I want things clean, but have no motivation to keep it that way... sigh.   urlLink click here for the entire post   I'm going to give the room a brief clean so I can pretend it's not as bad as it is, then head out to go shopping with Lauren.  I need a maid.

      Well, CDN gave one kick-ass concert on Thursday night.  It was one for the books - and one that was really special for me too, being my last one.  The guys sent me off in style, resurrecting "Longest Time" like a phoenix for one more go.  People had missed the song.  I had, too.  And Lauren got serenaded, FINALLY, after hearing so much about it.  The whole thing was just amazing, and I can't thank those guys enough.  The party afterward was a little smaller than I thought it would be, but still pretty wild.  It's funny how we've set a standard for ourselves with parties now: by most people's standards, last night would have been a huge and amazing party, but for us it was subpar.  So, I suppose we just need to throw another one before the end of the year to go out in style. :)  Works for me!  Another interview was scheduled today - for a middle school choir position in Westport!  In case you're like me and don't know where it is, I think it's somewhere down near NYC, bout 1.5 hours from here.  I have the interview on Friday.  I can't say I'm terribly interested in moving to that part of the state, but I figure at worst it will be good interview practice for me, and at best they'll make me an offer I can't refuse.  So, whatever... but woohoo for Ehren!  People want to hire me, or at least think I'm a good potential candidate.  Lebanon - principal wants to visit me at Sedgwick this week to watch me teach. Ellington - no update, they're still in the process of doing whatever it is they're doing.  Oh, I hope Ellington works out...  Had some friends over this evening to chill out and watch a movie - Sorority Boys.  What a great dumb movie.  I mean that sincerely.  Watch it, you'll understand.  It's worth your time.  Vernon Chorale is singing a concert next Saturday night at Vernon Congregational Church.  Tickets at something like $6 - and there's an orchestra on period instruments playing Mozart and Bach!  And Stella Roden is a soloist!  And Philip Cave!  And I'm conducting two pieces!  Oh, and there's a choir, too.  Come on, you know you want to come.  Let me know if you wan t me to get you a ticket - show me the money!  ...and a resounding "HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA" to all the members of the UConn choirs who have rehearsal tomorrow morning at 8:30!  On Spring Weekend!  I wonder if Bagley's finally lost it?  Can you imagine leading a choir of hung-over college students at 8:30 in the morning on the biggest party weekend of the year?  Damn, I'm glad I'm not in his shoes.  Happy singing, all.  I'll be thinking of you when I'm asleep and you're not.  See you all at your concert on Sunday.

      It's here... my last big concert with  urlLink CDN  is tonight at St. Mark's at 7pm.  I'm psyched beyond belief, and so proud of these guys.  It's going to be one for the books.  And if you're not coming, you're just plain stupid.   urlLink Rubyfruit  is singing, so you get two great groups for  US $0.00 .  That's right, kids, it's free.  So come on out and hear what great music sounds like.  And then come to the party at my apartment following the concert.  With the amount of people who've been invited, this is going to be one for the books.  It's Spring Weekend, Kill-A-Keg is lame anyway, the Rape Trail is scary, and Ehren's place is jumpin' with beautiful women and great music.  What more incentive do you need?    Oh right, Chris is running a bar.  Bring cash.  See you there.

      "Teaching is a moral and sacred act. I think the characteristics of a good teacher begin with genuine respect for the student's mind. That respect conveys to students that they can take themselves seriously. Next to that, I think, is a real love for the young and joy in seeing them grow and develop. Next to that is a passion for the discipline, but if you lack respect for the young mind and the love of young people, you won't be able to communicate it very well. We can teach people to be good teachers up to a relatively high degree, but I think teaching is also a talent. The really great teachers have this kind of X-ray vision that allows them to look at a young person and see right into that important intersection of emotion and intellect and see how to harness that emotional energy and intellectual effort and bring it to fruition. And that is a kind of X-ray vision that can't be taught. You either have it or you don't."   -Jil Ker Conway (author/historian), "In Praise of Our Teachers"

       Saturday  (  sat -er-day )  noun : A day of rest in an otherwise psychotic schedule.  See also  blessing .  Today was amazing.  I ended up with a free day.  I have no idea how this happened, or how I missed that it was coming.  But I needed it, badly.  It's been a week for the books.  Here, there and everywhere, with occasional breaks for food and sleep.  But I made it.  And I've only got two more weeks left of student teaching.  Who knew it would end this soon?  My interview on Thursday at Lebanon Middle School went much better than expected.  As my first ever, I figured it wouldn't go terribly well.  I was wrong.  Mr. Robert McGray, principal, kept me there for an hour chatting with me and showing me around.  The interview ended by asking me if I would be willing to teach a sample lesson/rehearsal to the choir and telling me that he would definitely be in touch.  So, I'd say it went quite well.  Now if Ellington and West Hartford would get off their asses, I would have some other options as well.  I think I'm going to substitute teach after UConn gets out until the end of the school year to rack up some extra cash.  Then, I plan on being as fiscally unproductive as possible.  I think I've earned it.  More as the mood hits.  For now, I'm still  Ehren

      It's a cheesy song from an unknown musical,  Starlight Express , and it was even worse when we sang it in choir in high school, but the damn song is so catchy that it comes back into my head from time to time when these thoughts show up.  So for now, I'll share with you the chorus of this song, which pretty much sums up how I feel about the time from now until graduation.   But there's a light at the end of the tunnel There's a light at the end of the tunnel The inside might be as black as the night But at the end of the tunnel there's a light   Find a recording if you can.  And laugh heartily.  It's worth every heartbeat spent.

      Hello, philosophical...  It's just been a good day.  I co-taught a workshop in New Hampshire for  urlLink NHMEA  with Dr. Neelly and Katrina Armando on childhood music and quality singing and a reading session for elementary and middle school.  And it was just great.  Fifty people showed up!  And they seemed to like me!  And... wow.  It's just nice to relax and reflect.    I'm a bit nervous about the next part of my life.  I'm getting interviews and trying to get a job teaching choir... all the while hoping that I'm not following the wrong path.  I have this drive to travel and see the world.  Part of me thinks I should join  urlLink Peace Corps .  Another part thinks I should just move to Southern California because the weather's so damn nice - but that is the same part that hates this weather we've had for the past several weeks.  Another part thinks that maybe teaching music overseas wouldn't be such a bad idea.  And then there's the stay-in-Connecticut-and-teach-music voice, which is the one I've been listening to lately.  I'm just not sure!  I suppose that I just need to follow whatever path is right for me, right now... and not worry quite so much about the ramifications.  Some people wouldn't agree with that, I know.  Those are the people who don't agree with my "values" or the "way I live my life".    To hell with them.    I think I'm doing quite well right now, thank you.  I've got a lot of things going for me.  And unless I've unwittingly managed to deceive countless friends and acquaintances - and MYSELF - I just might be that nice, caring, understanding person that everyone (including me) seems to think that I am.    --------  I want to see the world.  I want to be everywhere and do everything.  And I'm just me, with one set of indivisible legs and feet, capable of doing only one thing at a time.  And I stress over that as though I can change it by stressing.  --------  I tend to think that everyone I come into contact with is capable of achieving greatness.  Sometimes I even think that everyone IS greatness.  I wonder if that's good teaching philosophy... or if I'm just deluded.  Am I making any sense?  And what about all those "stupid people" that I hate: the ones who drive like assholes... the ones who think the world's out to get them... the ones who are out to get the world... the ones who just don't get the 'big picture'... the people who choose hate instead of love... the people who are 'devout' Christians and then can't even comprehend "love thy neighbor", or even more: "love thy enemy"...  Are these people capable of greatness?  Much of government and powerful people fall into this "stupid people" category.  Are they really great?  Or are they just powerful fucks who got there by beating down other people just so they could be taller by standing on their carcasses?  --------  It's going to be one of those nights.  But I think, this time, it's a good thing.  Oh yes, and I'm in love.  That goes without saying, but some things bear repeating.  Hurrah for contradictory notions in the same sentence.

      Hallo!  It's been a while.  I've done a bit since I last wrote.  Lauren and I went camping in Acadia with my parents last week(end) for 5-6 days or so.  Remember that massive rainstorm that lasted a week and a half?  Yeah, it was raining up there too.  Cold, wet, rainy... not the best combo for a camping trip.  But my parents took us out to eat and to movies a lot, so it became much more bearable.  Plus it was cool hanging out with them and being outside and all that stuff.  I have a job!!!  I am the new choir director at Lebanon Middle School.  And I am excited.  I have choir grades 5-8 and general music grades 5-7.  It's a small school with a huge choir program.  And the community really supports the choirs too!  And Lauren and I have a place to live now!  It's in Manchester, in a converted mill.  Seems I can't escape from towns with the name Manchester.  See her  urlLink blog  to find a link to some pictures of the place.  I've been substituting in West Hartford.  It's nice to get paid for teaching - if you can call it that right now.  Sometimes it feels more like crowd control.  But whatever.  I'm older and bigger and I get my way whether they like it or not.  Nyahh.  Life's good.  Ran into Emma from Neag today.  It was nice to see her.  Chatted with her while Lauren and I were out for a walk around campus.  We're off to Tom's to watch "Evita" and drink some beers.  Good combo, I think.

      Graduation has come and gone.  I am now officially a UConn alumnus.  And I really don't feel too much differently than I did last week.  This summer is looking up.  I find there's solace in doing.  So when I get down, I keep busy.  And that seems to take care of most things.  I miss old friends.  I wish things could be mended between us.  Maybe I'm just too much of an idealist that way.  But I suppose it's their choice.  (and their loss!)  Today is absolutely beautiful out.  I can't even express how much I've wanted this weather to come back.  And it has.  And I'm sitting here at the computer?  Later!

      I feel numb.  Graduation is 3 days away.  And a huge void is sitting on the other side, ready to engulf me whether I want it to or not.    I'm petrified.  I try to keep myself busy.  That helps sometimes.  Other times, Lauren's there ready with a hug, kind words, or whatever else she can muster.  And that helps too.  I wouldn't be doing as well as I am without her here beside me.  But still, I'm paralyzed at times.  If you're graduating this weekend, you know how I feel.  If you still have a few years to go, you will when your time comes.  But I'm frozen somewhere between running headon into the unknown and freezing like a deer in headlights.  I think it's time for bed.  Thanks to all who have helped me through everything thus far.    The future lies beyond;

      I'm done.  I'm actually done.  I made it.  I've completed every single requirement for fulfillment of my two bachelor's degrees.  And I'll be graduating one week from tomorrow.  Today was my last day of student teaching at Sedgwick.  It's been a blast, and today was great.  Lots of cool things happened.  For starters, John Bennett, the orchestra teacher, decided to call many of his friends in other districts (left several messages to call him back, actually - it WAS in the middle of the school day) to tell them they should hire me because I'm just a great teacher.  One of the people he called (and an old friend of his) is none other than Sal Cicciarella, of Ellington High School!  How bout that.  And I thought that lead was dead.  So John wants to talk to Sal about me this weekend, and I also have in two messages to people in the Board of Education office in Ellington checking status of my application.  I'm trying to stir up as many irons as I have to give myself options for a job.    The next cool thing happened when I called the Arts office in West Hartford.  The conversation went something like this:   Me: "Hi Debbie, this is Ehren Brown over at Sedgwick.  I'm calling to check on the status of my application for the middle school/high school choral position you have open?" Debbie:  "Oh, Ehren!  I'm glad you called!  I've been trying to get in touch with you.  Are you available to come in for an interview next Thursday?"   Needless to say, I was psyched.  Goes to show how being assertive and proactive can really help a guy out.  I've got an interview there on Thursday at 2:30 after I sub for Joe all day.  And the best part is that Joe is going to be one of the people who is interviewing me!  I love it...  Then, I got home to find an email from Bob McGray (principal of Lebanon Middle School) that read as follows:   Hello Ehren, Dr. Doyen enjoyed her visit with you.  We would like to have you return and be able to spend a little time with Alesia Gagnon, our band director and Department Chair, who I believe you met.  Our Director of curriculum, Bonnie Hanna (a former music teacher)  would also like to meet you.  My secretary, Debbie Saucier, will contact you on Monday to arrange a mutually convenient time.   If you have any questions feel free to call me at xxx-xxxx.  Have a great weekend. Bob McGray   So, to summarize:  I'm done with UConn.  I'm done with student teaching.  I have people making connections for me trying to get me as many interviews as they can.  My teacher's interviewing me for a position in West Hartford.  Lebanon wants me back AGAIN (making this my third trip there with one additional observation Bob did with me at Sedgwick).  And Ellington just might come through with something after all.  Life is good.  Now to get that passport...

      Another from the archives - this is a letter I stole that was posted on a bulletin board at SYMS music camp at the University of New Hampshire in the summer of 1997.  It resonated with me then, and it continues to do so now.  Turns out this guy was a piano professor at Eastman at the time. ---------------------------------------- Forwarded message Wed. 30 April 1997   Hello all,  Ive been thinking a lot about fear, love, and things of that nature.  Or put another way, is there any way to be off the path?  It seems to me that there are the things that really touch our hearts and stir our souls, and there are things that dont.  Somehow, we have been taught that what touched us most deeply isnt the way our lives should go.. Isnt that the thing we should follow Isnt that what we should build our lives onIsnt  When we sit at many of our performances, when we play at many of our juries, when we sit through many of our classes, we feel the emptiness in our souls.  We are bored.  We are tired.  This doesnt make me feel good.  This doesnt make me feel.  At the same time we feel a kind of safety in that.  We feel our desire to be purified by our discipline.  This must be good for me to feel this bad.  And on and on.  So what Ive been thinking is that the problem is not in the person/student, the problem is on the interpretation of the person/students growth patterns.  The problem isnt in feeling bad, or confused, or lost, but rather in interpreting that confusion as dysfunction or pathology.  The fact is growth hurts does it not?  Doesnt the bone grow back stronger after the break?  Do you put your hand on a hot burner more than once?  How can anyone seriously expect to study music, in all its unfathomable mystery, without confusion and pain?  Its obviously soul work and can only be related to on that level.  Or, we can speak on the other side of the same con.  How can anyone look into their own heart without confusion and pain?  Of course great beauty and joy go along with all this but Im assuming that everyone realizes this.  Anyways, heres the rub, theres no choice.  Your soul knows what song its supposed to sing, and either sing it with joy and love and suffer those consequences, or be burdened by the weight of turning from your own heart.  It seems that the only thing more frightening than pain is joy.  In the Hindu tradition of chakras and the movement of spiritual energy there is the beautiful concept of finally arriving at level 6 out of the 7 chakras.  At this point you behold God and it is the most beautiful sight ever imaginable but check it out, theres another level.  To achieve it you must let go or abandon the most beautiful thing you have ever seen, Gods image, so that you may merge with it and have no consciousness of it but rather are it.  Which actually brings you back to level one, the most basic level.  Musically speaking, I think we all realize that Jazz is dead, or at least whats passed off as it nowadays.  Or you could say its as alive as the Minuet if you call that living.  The question is can you let go of your image of Jazz that everybody shoves down your throat and find the energy behind it, continually being renewed in every generation.  Physics tells us that energy just transfers, connect with that and see where it takes you.  That may be a book, a TV show, a porn mag, Beavis, a friend, and if youre lucky, MUSIC.  And, if youre very lucky, then your own soul.  Follow what touches you deeply no matter what.  Believe in its own rightness no matter how seemingly crazy  Crazy is an external interpretation put on creativity by those living in fear and pain.  Your natural design should be your key and guide.  Learn from everything around you but always place your inner voice at the highest.  Can I get a witness?  Hhmm.  A little preachy.  A few other quick thoughts.  Im beginning to think that maybe you guys are the early generation of another 60s type shift in consciousness.  Ive seen wisdom and depth in you folks (students) that seem to be more than just smarter.  I sometimes think its a quantum type of shift akin to the conservatism of the 50s and early 60s against the love culture of the late 60s and early 70s.  For you guys there seems to be a coming together of a lot of things in one mind with a spiritual dimension that seems beyond the clich dogma of our religious institutions.  If you are our future, Ill take it.  One of my many lessons at McCurdys is that there is no such thing as crazy.  I just get paid for my insanity where they get locked up.  To feel fear and not show it, to feel anger and not show it, to feel love and be too afraid to say it, to feel sad and be unable to share it,  There is no way to be off the path, you dont need to feel frustration or worry, or pain at learning music.  Thats crazy.  Make music and allow yourself to be swept up in its stream and it can take you to a place beyond fear.  And for the love of all thats holy, do not take on anyone elses pain about music.  If they are bitter, let them practice making music without joy.  Play what feels right, always.  You dont have to play any better, because there is no better.  Joy is not better than joy.  OK, have to run.  More shenanigans (sp?) to come.  Earnest Borgnine, is anyone with me on this?

      Written today around 10am:  Standing on the brink of a precipice with no way to see beyond. The valley below is not visible, not blurred, not hazy. It's as if it never was.  A void. My future is uncertain.  And I'm about ten mouse clicks away (give or take) from hopping on the next plane. I feel an uncontrollable urge to go somewhere - anywhere - as far away as possible. Thailand sounds nice. And, for once, I don't really care to examine why. I just want to escape.  Rejoice in the madness, revel in the insanity.

      Our last dress rehearsal with the  urlLink Vernon Chorale  went amazingly tonight.  Our concert tomorrow night in Vernon is going to be incredible.  We're doing music Mozart and Bach with an orchestra made up of period instruments!  Everyone involved is just great, the choir's finally hitting its stride, and I couldn't be more excited.  So, tomorrow night, 7:30pm, Vernon Congregational Church, $6.  Come on by.  I promise you won't be disappointed.

      Update on the interview:  Date has been changed to Wednesday at 3pm.  I got a call from Sally Doyen, the superintendent of Lebanon Public Schools, telling me that Bob had made the interview on Monday without realizing she was already booked.  So she called me to reschedule the interview.  We decided on Wednesday, which may give me some great news when I meet my ed class at 5pm at Margarita's that day for a 'goodbye UConn' dinner.    That's all for now.

I now have an interview with him, the curriculum supervisor, and the superintendent on Monday after school!  I so have this job.  I'll be kinda interested to see what happens Monday.  For now, though, it's gonna be a great weekend.  I'm in a great mood now, though my head hurts from last night.  I think I'm going to go drink some water.

      I'm at school - almost noon on a Thursday.  I've got ten minutes before I am teaching two 7th grade general music classes and then one 6th grade general music class.  I did one 6th grade class earlier and I almost killed them all.  Or at least beat most of them into a bloody, unrecognizable mess.  Fortunately, I have self-control and professional decorum.  So I just kept these thoughts in my head.  Sigh.  I'm so sick of being here.  I wish I wasn't - I'm just starting to feel like I know what I'm doing and get comfortable with everything and everyone.  But I just can't take much more.  Thank God the weekend starts in about two hours.  I don't think I could deal with coming in tomorrow.  I hope I'll feel better next week.  I'm supposed to finish out next week - at least that's what I told Joe - but if I still feel like this next week, I don't know what I'll do.    Like I said, burned out... tired of the same grind.  It's senioritis at its finest, and I'm supposed to grow and produce and teach and inspire in the midst of it.  And deep down, I just don't care.  I will later, I know.  I am still pretty sure I'm in the right profession.  Most of the time, I love it.  But I need summer in the worst way.  And a job.  Oooohhh, do I need a job.  Any takers?  It's nice that they unblocked blogger.com.  Most good websites are blocked here at school to protect young minds and goofing off, I suppose.  Yay censorship.  Am I bitter?  Maybe.  But if so, it's the senioritis talking.

      Well, this is it:  We start our move tomorrow to Manchester.  Somehow, I have a feeling that we have no idea what we're in for.  At any rate, Lauren and I will likely be out of touch with most of you (that is to say, no Internet) until the beginning of next week.  Phone service at the new place won't be up until Saturday.  So if you'd like to find us, try my cell phone at (603) 591-0181.  And if you'd like to help us move, I'll provide free pizza and beer to anyone interested!  See you all on the flip side...

      Lauren was reading emails from last summer a moment ago... everyone's thoughts after the big Vermont trip, how we felt, how it changed us and the like.  It got me thinking.  Today was my first day at Lebanon with all the teachers, as a colleague.  It was great.  I was excited.  I am excited.  And yet I worry.  I worry that I'm forsaking dreams for practicality, and that scares me.  I worry that I'm going to become just another person in the system.  I feel like I'm already becoming it, even as I fight tooth and nail with my soul.  Lauren's somehow managed to avoid this, or at least it seems on the surface.  She stays true to who she is, regardless of what happens.  It's one of the reasons I'm madly in love with her.  And things fall out for her somehow.  They always do.  And they always have for me, too... as long as I trust myself and hold fast to that which is RIGHT.  Am I following my own well-trodden example now?  I don't know.  Is this...  culturation ... happening to everyone, everywhere?  Perhaps.  But it scares the piss out of me.  The idea of becoming a downtrodden drone is more than I can bear.  And it scares me enough to do something rash.  Heroes can be a funny thing, you know.  The man I thought was mine - Jack London - turned out to be not such a good role model after all.  Well, maybe he still is a hero, albeit one I now take with a grain of salt.  You see, Jack lived hard.  And he also died hard, and died far too young.  The man took needless risks, put needless substances into his body, and in general asked for what he got.  And yet his 'credo' (that hasn't even been proven to have been his words, after all the stock I've put into it!) still rings true for me:    I would rather be ashes than dust! I would rather that my spark should burn out &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspin a brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dry-rot.  I would rather be a superb meteor, every atom &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspof me in magnificent glow, than a sleepy and  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsppermanent planet.  The function of man is to live, not to exist.  I shall not waste my days trying to prolong them.  I shall use my time.    I'm still so young.  And I can see LIFE itself coming at me with all of its excitement.  And I feel like I'm turning from the path of LIFE to the path of safety.  I hope I'm wrong.  At any rate, I'm only tied down for a year.  A lot can happen in that time.  In a year, my lease and contract will be up for renewal.  And you never know what might happen then.  I don't have to sign.  Then again, maybe I'll still want to.  Maybe right now, this is LIFE.    Time will tell.

      I went on a motorcycle ride today!  Woohoo!  What a rush.  Perhaps there will have to be a bike purchase in Ehren's future... if not this summer then maybe next.  It's really quite the rush and so exhilarating... I highly recommend it to anyone who never has before.  Went back to the pool today with Lauren and Carrie-Lynn, plus Dave Ripley and Katya.  Dave shaved his head!  Seriously.  It's almost all gone.  Apparently his hair was donated to be used for wigs for kids who need it.  What a cool thing to do.  Reminds me of a story I read this week about a minister at a congregational church in Southbury.  He bet his youth group that they couldn't reach a certain fund-raising goal - and promised to shave his head if they did!  You can guess what happened next.  The kids surpassed their goal, and the preacher kept up his end of the bargain by shaving his head.  This is the same guy who has a "Dunk the Preacher" dunk tank every year at the summer Strawberry Festival.  Sounds like a cool guy to me.  Okay in my book.  My head hurts a bit from the bike ride - either the helmet was too tight or it's just rougher than I thought going over all those bumps in the road.  Either way, I'm going to go read more Lord of the Rings.  I am rereading the third book - Return of the King - because I feel like it.  So there... :)  Later...

      It's a lazy summer Monday night relaxing with my Lauren.  Listening to Liz Reed, chatting with Lauren's mom online (deemodonnell if you're so inclined), and in general just trying to enjoy doing as little as possible - and doing it pretty well.  We went to the pool at Walden apartments today with Carrie-Lynn and laid outside for hours reading, sunning, and eventually jumping in the pool, where Lauren and Carrie-lynn decided it would be fun to teach me how to float on my back.  They eventually realized what many swimming instructors realized long ago: that I don't do that too well.  In fact, I can't.  Somehow, I don't really care. :)    So, my future is open right about now.  I'm considering getting a job to fill up the time and perhaps pick up some more money.  I'm also not really convinced that I want or need to do such a rash thing.  So, for all you adventure seekers out there looking for someone to do something with, give me a fucking call, will you?  Or an email or SOMETHING.  I know you're out there.  Let's go do something random and fun.  ehren out.  maybe there's some adventure to be had here... ;)

      It's late night, Sunday, 11:15 pm.  I'm typing on the laptop that I never thought would amount to anything.  Turns out I was wrong.  Just finished watching "Boiler Room" on USA.  What a great movie.  I never get tired of watching it.  I think, from time to time.  Keeps the brain in good working order.  It's been a nice weekend.  Rainy friggin weather, but a nice weekend.  I finally managed to clean my room.  It was one hell of a job, but it's clean - well, except for my desk.  I am currently sitting on the floor next to the bed - again, something that would have been impossible yesterday.  I feel like myself... calmer... more at ease... philosophical?  I feel like I can relax in my room once more.    And now I can actually get other things done.  Like the thank you notes I should have written right when I got the graduation cards.  But they're done now.  I have nice relatives who give nice graduation presents.  Let's leave it at that.  Lauren's in bed next to me, coughing herself awake from time to time, and otherwise tossing and turning a whole lot.  She's heading to her ENT tomorrow in Manchester to try and drain cysts in her ears or something like that.  She/we also think she might have allergies, although she seems to be allergic to just about every medicine Ive thought to try, except for the one that doesn't do anything with regard to her symptoms.  I get worried about her - I feel like she just gets sick easily and I can't do anything about it.  I hope she gets better.  I think I need to get back to work and get some more money as soon as I can.  I'm worried about being able to make the payments we're going to need to make in order to move into our new place.  Grrrr...  anyone need a substitute teacher?  Maybe I should check out some temp work as well.  Oh, and I think I may have managed to remove most (if not all) of the mildew-like stink in my computer chair.  In case you were losing sleep over that or something.  Ehren's back, all.  Now to get a handle on whether or not I actually DO have a money crisis... ha!

      Here it is, late on a Thursday night.  I'm finally done with ALL of my obligations for student teaching.  Tonight was the 7th grade concert at Sedgwick, and the 8th grade concert was Monday night.  All went quite well, much went better than it ever had before.  Such is the nature of a concert situation, I think - the kids always reach beyond themselves as the pressure hits.    Life's good.  I've not worked much this week.  Did a lot of reading, searched for auto insurance... I bought some cheap used books, which is proving to be a great and cost-effective way to feed my appetite for new reading material.  I fixed my computer (knock on wood) from its unexplained bouts of crashing - I think it was overheating.  A new heatsink and several new fans later, it's running much cooler with no problems thus far.  I think Lauren and I are settling out.  It's as if we're forming some unspoken, unconscious covenant that addresses both our needs and wants  - most of the time! :)  - and for the most part, we're learning how to get what we need and want without causing undue stress on the other.  We've had our ups and downs, but she's just the best.  And she's understanding, and loving.  And I can call her a poophead without fear of major retribution (read: lasting scars).  Oh, I'm in love.  We got a $15 coffee table from Salvation Army.  I bet if we keep stalking those stores around here, we'll get most of what we need.  Salvation Army and Goodwill have become my newest friends.  Lots of good stuff to be had.  Lauren's sister got a decent guitar there for $10!!  Between Salvation Army, Goodwill, and all the friends and family that keep trying to give us furniture, we're going to have a lot of what we need.  To hell with buying stuff... we'll be your spring cleaners.  Anybody else need some furniture taken off your hands?  Email responses to  urlLink ehrenbrown@letterboxes.org .

      Dear God in heaven.  I just deleted all my contacts, all my notes, everything, in my Palm.  I have no idea how to find any of you.  If you read this, please take pity on me and send me an email (the link is on the right side of the screen) that lets me know all the ways to find you.  On the bright side, my computer no longer takes 6 minutes to boot up, and my Palm now has fresh batteries.  Maybe I should try that philosophy...

      Courtesy of Mr. RJ Panda...    I fuckin' hate UConn.  There are stupid ass football players here on scholarship who beat their mothers and run away from the scene of their own drunk driving accident.  Yet IIIIIIIIII have to PAY to be here.  That's fuckin' bullshit that's what it is...  Fuck UConn and fuck its entire family...  I'm playin' guitar to relax...    Sometimes other people say it better than I can.  Ah, the bureaucracy of higher education...

      Grrrrrrrrrr.  I hate it when I can't do something.  Let me clarify and explain.  I just took Lauren's new Jetta out to do a few errands.  I thought I could handle it.    Oops.  The car's fine.  Nothing happened to it, nothing happened to me except a lot of ego-bruising.  Maybe it was good for me.  I stalled out hard-core in the middle of Main Street in downtown Manchester at the top of the hill by our church.  For those who don't know the area, it's a pretty friggin major intersection.  Go me.  Y'know, I suppose it sort of fits into my personality: Never do anything by halves.  Always go full out.    Well, if I was trying to plug up traffic, then damn! I did a great job of it.  People were honking while stuck behind me, although I ask you: If there's a car ahead of you with its 4-way flashers on, would you pull up behind it, really close, then get confused as to why it's not moving, then get pissed off?  Shouldn't you be banging your head against your steering wheel for having so little foresight?  Shouldn't you just be sodomized by rabid wildebeasts just for being so damned stupid?  I recall three such people clearly who did just that.  I also remember delaying both the public bus and the U.S. Postal Service, likely keeping both from reaching their destinations on time...   So, wow.  A brief 3-part errand that should have taken 15 minutes took 45 minutes.  Sometimes it's just not my day.  The silver lining:  When I got back, I drove around the lot for 15 minutes or so and finally almost got the hang of starts and stops with a stick shift.  So I'm not a  complete  and utter moron.  Just in the remedial class today, folks...  That's right.  This guy's teaching the future leaders of America...  Keep smiling...

      I'm having a full-blown identity crisis.  Or at least it seems so at 10:25 at night when it's far too easy to ruminate on such things.  It's been a long day.  I seriously need to get out of this apartment tomorrow and DO something, or else invite someone over, or perhaps a combination of both.  Or maybe I just need a hug.  If you are up for either or both, give me a call tomorrow.  Far too much about today has just been crummy.  I just feel like nobody understand me.  I'm glad I get to start over tomorrow.

      Going through old pictures can be dangerous.    I need to weed some out, I think.  I look back at things I've done, and people I've spent my time with... and I think "Dumbass!  Why didn't you see how bad an idea that was?"  It's easy to beat yourself up over things you did in the past.  I wish I could stop doing that.    I just feel like I'm having a minor mid-life crisis at age twenty-three.  I know it all goes with graduating from UConn, getting a job, and having bills.  I just wish I could get a handle on it all.  Sometimes I can, and life seems to drop into place, and it all makes sense.  But then there are times like right now, when it's just a big unknown.  I should follow my own advice, right?  Big unknown=big adventure.  That should be exactly what I want.  And it is.  And it's not.  All at the same time.  How confusing.  Spending too much time here at home alone is sending me into this mindset.  I should go do something about it.  A shower, some food, and something to do will help immensely.    That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.

      The fire alarm went off in our building an hour ago.  Yes, that's right.  A fire alarm.  Somehow I thought I'd escape this when I moved away from a college campus.  Maybe I was wrong.  Lauren and I ended up going to Shaw's to buy an air freshener for her new car.  We talked with the firemen (and firelady!) coming out of the building when we got back and found out that the cause was unknown, and they suspected a problem with the fire alarm system itself.  Well, better it going off randomly than not at all, I suppose... anyway, the management people were coming over to fix it soon.  All should be well soon.  Lauren's doing an awesome job driving stick, considering she's barely ever done it before.  Everyone tell her that I said so.  She gets scared easily but wants to drive stick very badly.    My girlfriend drives stick.  That sounds so hot.

      Update #2:  My phone DOES work better.  Maybe the dorks aren't so dumb after all.  Maybe I should just chill out.  Either way, it's time for bed.  Lack of sleep makes Ehren cranky.

      Speaking of technology that doesn't work the way it should... why is it that a cordless phone can interfere so well with wireless internet?  I mean, REALLY... who actually has a cordless phone AND wireless internet, right?  I can just see the dorks who thought that one up.  Hey guys... you fucked up.  Now fix it.    Sheesh.  Maybe my cordless phone will work better than Lauren's.  I hope.

      We're here.  We're in.  The new apartment rocks.  Our utilities are on.  Lauren's bought a new car - a '96 VW Jetta, black, stick shift, with a sunroof.  Man, am I jealous.  We have boxes and stuff just strewn everywhere around this apartment.  I think tomorrow will be spent making some sense of this mess.  It's getting to be a pain not knowing where things are.  Got renters' insurance today and new CT car insurance, so I can convert all the license plate and registration good stuff to my name before the end of the month.  Oh, and so I can get a CT drivers license, too.  Who says my life's not cool?  Oh, and there's a neat park nearby.  And a pool, too.  I bet a lot of kids pee in it.  Who cares?  It's summer.  And rain is on the way.  Fucking weather satellites.  You'd think they should be able to change the weather with all the technology we've poured trillions of dollars into.  I think they should pay ME to change the weather.  Hell, for a couple trillion dollars, I'd sure FIGURE OUT how to do it.  Wouldn't you?  Mike from 117 downstairs invited me over earlier.  What a cool guy.  Lives alone, makes/paints fantasy characters for games I completely don't understand, going to school part-time... I love people.  Life rules.

        The first day is over...   I made it.  The first day of school at Lebanon Middle School has come and gone.  I'm official now.  And for the most part, I think the day was a success.  I had minor problems here and there, I still feel underplanned (possibly because I AM), but things are off to a good start.    Today I saw the 5th and 6th grade chorus -- a group of about 120 students -- all at once.  Man, did they not want to settle down.  I see them last period, too.  Heh.  I suppose it can't be helped.  Quite the 'spirited' bunch, there.    Mostly, I'm just friggin' tired.  I could barely keep my eyes open on the drive home today.  I'm going to bed now, and it's 9:30pm.  I can't wait...  ...for bed... AND the weekend.  Just two more days!

      I've been told I need to blog.  I suppose writing will fill that request. :)  The past few days have been an emotional roller coaster.  I'm still trying to get my mind around the fact that I am a teacher, and I start Friday.  The kids are coming back on Wednesday.  Wow.  The cool part is that I'm starting to get excited about it, instead of just freaking out.  My planning for general music isn't going to be as hard as I thought.  Now if I could just pick repertoire for the choirs, I'd really be all set!  UConn has fucked me once again.  Just when I thought, "There! I've graduated, now I won't have to deal with the UConn beaurocracy any more," WHAM!  there it goes and shoves a dick in my ass.  No, really.  I hate the Neag School of Education.  They were no use to me as a student because they didn't understand music ed students or our program, and now they just don't care.  They fucked up my certification, lost my Praxis II scores AND my Praxis I waiver, and simply didn't send the paperwork to the state AND didn't call me to tell me.  Oh, it gets better.  After far too many phone calls today to the state Department of Education (who was surprisingly VERY helpful) and Kathy Ivey in the Neag office (who was astoundingly unhelpful), the story boiled down to this conversation:    Me:   Hi Kathy, it's Ehren Brown again.  I just got off the phone with Julie Gottlieb over at the Connecticut State Department of Education.  I found my test scores!  She says that all they need from you is this form off their website that just says that I did indeed complete a Connecticut-approved teacher certification program, and they'll take care of the rest of it.  Kathy:   That's not how we do things here.  We don't send out anything until we have those test scores.  Me:   But they told me that they have the scores there, and all they need to process my certification is that form.  Kathy:   I know for a fact the dean won't sign anything without all the paperwork here, in your file.  Me:   But the form that you'd be signing has nothing to do with the Praxis scores at all.  It just states that I graduated from your program.  Kathy:   That's right.  Me:   So you're telling me that you won't send out the form, even though all it says is that I did graduate from UConn, which is true, and even though it says nothing about the Praxis scores?  Kathy:   That's just our policy.  Not much else followed this.  Can you believe the beaurocratic bullshit?  Now, instead of a matter of days, it will be a matter of weeks until I am officially certified.  They need to wait for ETS to send them my Praxis II scores AGAIN (which cost $30!) and then for the waiver from the state (which they're just going to send back to the state!), and THEN they will send my paperwork to me, which I can then fill out and bring to Hartford.  And I start work on Friday.  I hope I still have a job before this is all over.    This is obscene.  I hope I get a chance to warn other people about what Neag's really like.  The education's great, sure, but damned if you don't need to watch out for yourself every step of the way.  They sure don't help you out.  Now if only they were all like Deb Trahan.  If you know her, you understand.  Early music party here Friday night.  Round up the geeks!

        Tonight, the part of Ehren will be played by Prince Charming   Today Lauren got really, really sick.  We're talking painful, can't relax, food poisoning kind of sick.  So I got to put on all that shining armor that I keep for special occasions and take care of her.  I think she really appreciated it.  I did kind of want to go to Tom and Liz's place tonight -- but I suppose Lauren's worth it :).  On another note... is anyone reading this thing besides me?  ::ahem::  Leave love so I don't feel like I'm writing into a vaccuum here...

        The wisdom of the alders    I wrote this in Vermont on Friday afternoon.  It's my first poetry in years.  Hope you enjoy it.   The sanctity of the woods surrounds me. Their solitude supports me. Their stillness speaks to me.      They are saying Relax.  Be not afraid. We have not come to scare you. We are not here to build you up. We are.                Unabashed in our stoicism, We simply exist.  And we will Share our secrets with you. If you would only stop to listen! For as long as you come here      bearing the scepter of your world,      you can never understand.  Foolish human!  When will you see That your world, as you know it, is Misguided and deluded? That your values are misplaced? That your anthrocentric views are wrong? How can we make you understand That our stoicism you hold so dear, That draws you to us, Is a faade? You see what you expect to see. If you would open your eyes to yourself, You would soon realize that We are always changing. Is this so difficult to grasp? Nothing is ever the same --      and you cannot change that fact. So it is with us. And so it is with you as well. You think you can control your world,      bend it to your whim --      you are wrong. You think people are static things --      you are wrong. You think you know what will happen tomorrow --      you are wrong.  Only in this one thing may you trust --    that you do not understand the world.  It's OK.  We don't either. The difference is that we enjoy it that way.  We may not know what will happen tomorrow, But we can choose how to face it. All you need do, every dawn, Is convince yourself that  today , you will succeed. And it will be so. For when you are faced with adventure or adversity, (Which are really two sides of the same coin) Simply remove all options of failure And make whatever you are given work.  .......  What, human?  You crave more? There is no more. You now possess the extent of our secrets. What you do now is up to you. Let's see if you are up to the task.

        Me, a teacher?   The new school year is coming, whether any of us like it or not.  The summer is fast disappearing, and with it all the freedom and spontanaeity it embodied.  Responsibility and hard work is looming just around the corner.  Especially for me.  This 'teacher' thing has me scared.  I've chosen not to deal with it until now, but given the lack of time between now and my first day of school on Friday, August 22nd, that's no longer an option.  I am now responsible for the musical education of literally hundreds of middle schoolers in choirs and in the classroom.    It's daunting.  It's what I've been studying for all these years.  I am pretty sure I'm up to the challenge, but the simple fact remains that I have no idea what's about to hit me.  I still haven't started planning in earnest -- typical me -- but I do have some basic ideas sketched out in my head.  Will I be a good teacher?  I hope so.  But I've gotta tell you, I'm scared out of my mind.  And yet, I'm still going to get in there and do the best job I can.  I just hope it's good enough.  The kids deserve it.

        What lies ahead in Vermont?   It's almost here.  In a few short hours I will be packing the car and heading to northern Vermont with Lauren and god knows who else to begin my escape from the world and technology and all its trivialities. This year, I am very likely heading into a week of sitting inside the cabin because of all the rain that is kicking New England's ass.    I think I'm excited.  For those who understand, you know there's a bit of a -- how to put it? -- odd situation regarding certain personages at my destination. Most of that has been put to rest over time.  Nothing will "go down" or explode, and yet sometimes there's an underlying quirkiness to the whole situation.  One of these days, I'll get a handle on it.  Or so I hope.  I don't know what to expect this year.  Several attendees are the same as last year.  Others have cancelled, for various reasons -- some due to family obligations, some to poor planning, others because they just don't want to go.  It's just a different ball game than it was last year.  We were coming off the high of the Storrs Chorale trip to San Francisco, thanks to Mark Singleton.  We bonded in ways we never thought we would.  Hell, I just showed up at the end because they needed another bass.  Me, an asset to a bass section?  Somehow it all worked.  And we needed to do it again.    Enter Lauren, with everything I've come to love about her.  She offered up Vermont as a retreat for us all.  And we pounced on it.  We even tried to pay Jenny's airfare (now how many of you remember that?) from Fort Wayne.  The trip was amazing, and all of us were changed.  Some things have not changed.  There's still a core of people going who understand what it's all about.  We still have a guest flying in, though this time it's Brie from Kentucky.  Some people have grown closer over the past year, others further apart.  I suppose that's what time does.  I should know...  So, I have mixed emotions about this trip.  I think I'm scared to get too excited about it because of the huge unknown that awaits us.  Recreating an experience can be disaster sometimes, and I'm hoping that's not what awaits us.    ....Fuck it.  Who am I kidding?  I am so excited about this trip.  You'd all better just come and make it kick.  I've procrastinated long enough this morning with packing and everything -- time to get running.  Damn, I'm weird lately.  I think I've spent too much time with this computer and not enough out with people.  Well, this week will definitely give me a overdose of the other side of that spectrum.  I'll be out of touch till Tuesday.  Hold all my calls.

        Who am I?   This might just be more pointless than usual.  My goal is to find a point, thereby justifying this entire post.  Summer depression seems to have set in.  I feel like I have so many things that I'm supposed to be doing, and yet can't seem to convince myself to do any of them.  I feel lonely, yet I have company often.  I know myself, yet can't explain simple things I do.  I search for meaning in my life from many angles, yet never answer the questions fully or adequately.  Sometimes I think that I, myself, am the meaning of my life -- that I must find motivation within.  Other times I search for it in spirituality or "God" or the church.  I think that my problem is that I ask too many questions to be at ease with much.  An inquisitive nature is wonderful for finding stuff out, but it runs counteractive to the Zen-like state I crave right now.   Richard Shindell is an amazing musician.  His cd "Courier" is playing right now in the background, which I cannot recommend heartily enough.   I look around my new apartment and I think "Damn, I have it made."  I've got all sorts of stuff -- more than I know what to do with, and certainly more than I have places for.  But stuff doesn't really mean much in the end.  I have a beautiful, wonderful, compassionate, understanding, loving, and caring girlfriend in Lauren.  I have a great job that I'm fairly sure I can enjoy and do well in, but that I know is not where I can stay for a long time.  None of  these things really seems to sink in at times like this.  It's like I've got up this shell that blocks out everything -- good stuff, bad, indifferent.  It doesn't matter.  It's all crap.  But it's not crap.  And I know that too.  I think I'm scared on a lot of fronts.  I don't feel like I know myself, not substantially anyway.  Do any of us really know ourselves?  Or each other, for that matter?  Can we?  Is it even possible?  I am inclined to say YES to all of those questions.  I know that people  do   know themselves, and that people can know other people.  I wonder how those people do it.  I wonder what I'm missing sometimes... why I can't do it, I mean.  Seems like self-knowledge shouldn't be that difficult a thing to do.  Lauren walks downstairs and hangs from the beam that crosses the bottom of the stairs.  I am struck by how amazingly nonchalantly breathtaking she is.  She spins across the room with hands in the air, dancing to music nobody else hears.  She pauses at the fish tank to kiss it and commune for a moment, then decides that I might need some company and plunks herself down next to me, where she lies down and nuzzles up persistently under my elbow.  Oh, I'm in love.  Sounds like somebody knows who I am -- and what I need -- after all.  There's hope for us all.  Guess I found my point.

      Well, for anyone who's been wondering, I am better than I was last week.  Still not totally okay yet, but definitely much better.  It's strange how I'm just not in the mood to share much -- and plus, I'm tired.  But good tired.  This weekend was awesome.   For details on everything, visit  urlLink Lauren's blog .  She's stolen my muse, it seems.  But for now, this is all I can muster.  I'm going back to being happy now.

      Got To Begin Again Billy Joel (Cold Spring Harbor)  Well so here I am at the end of the road  Where do I go from here?  I always figured it would be like this  Still nothing seems to be quite clear   All the words have been spoken and the prophecy fulfilled  But I just can't decide where to go  Yes, it's been quite a day and I should go to sleep  But tomorrow I will wake up and I'll know   That I've got to begin again  Though I don't know how start  Yes, I've got to begin again  And it's hard   Well it's been quite a while since I lifted my head  And I'm sure the light will hurt my eyes  I see the way that I been spendin' my days  And reality has caught me by surprise   I was dreamin' of tomorrow so I sacrificed today  And it sure was a grand waste of time  And despite all the truth that's been thrown in my face  I just can't get you out of my mind   That I've got to begin again  Though I don't know how start Yes, I've got to begin again  And it's hard

      I wrote part of a blog a minute ago about how I feel right now.  But I don't really feel like publishing it.  It's too personal.  I just can't wait to see Lauren tonight.  She will understand.  I wish I could see where I am going.

        Tales from School   Man, am I ever busy lately.  I wish I had more time to breathe and just remember life's simplicities.  Apparently, it is not to be right now.  School is a constant surge of ups and downs.  Sometimes things are good, other times horrible.  I alternate between loving my students and doing research for different graduate schools because I want to leave.  The thing is that it's not that I don't like teaching.  In fact, I love teaching.  It's all the crap that I have to sift through before I get to teach -- that's what I hate.  But middle school kids are fun, and it's all a game... that's what I keep telling myself.  Just had probably the best chorus rehearsal to date with the girls form 7th and 8th grade.  Man, they still like to talk a lot.  I need better planning, and I need to weed out a few talkative souls.  But they're going to be really great.  I just need to take everything one day at a time.  That's all I can do, anyway.  Everything will work out in the end.  I just need to do a good job in the meantime!  It's lonely teaching and living away from campus.  I miss my friends, and Lauren is even busier than I am.  Sometimes I think that Rich has the right idea, living off his labor and the land in the Northern Kingdom of Vermont.  Or maybe I should partner up with Dan Jeanette and buy a vineyard in Italy.  Yeah, right...

Listen,  you never have heard such song. What stone gave back&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tibi  it gave ten times over:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Domini  pleas demanding                               attention no god could ignore, no grave could not be moved by. Where sunlight knelt down that song rose.  It was right that the amsel ignored us. Over our heads she fluted back and forth with food, her nest high on the saint's carved crown. Her chicks filled out rests with their drone.  And it could have seemed that day out of time the rest of the world was elsewhere: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quam olim Abrahae  missiles arriving hours from us were not waiting burial, peace&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; promisisti  talks were not breaking down,  riding back on the bus thinking next year the amsel will nest, this choir will sing somewhere else. Stones will once again keep their silence. Sunlight will kneel in grave silence. This is what I must say I believe.   III     "After silence, that which comes next to               expressing the inexpressible is music."                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aldous Huxley                            Three months without sun, his mission locked in Antarctic ice, my Chilean cousin  survived hearing Mozart, the only composer he found  really sane, the only to balance promise and  memory -- Requiem wordless this  region of ice and clouds, Abraham's mountain, admitting our own  helplessness once again we begin.   "Puedo escribir los versos mas tristes esta noche, "  my cousin quoted Neruda  driving to mining camps, fishmg towns, children not knowing sacrifice by not  knowing anything else, the name  "Allende" red on walls around schools, banks, private  gardens hidden below jagged glass set in cement.   IV                  "For poetry makes nothing happen: it survives               In the valley of its saying . . .; it survives,               A way of happening, a mouth."                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;W.H. Auden                            Yes, I can be tempted and some days I say  All right, art is not after all moral, this Requiem  as we sing it has nothing to do with the world we in our distances try  to imagine: threat in the hands of Victor Jara  voice of Garcia Lorca still Chile and Spain remember: as though  silence were not also loudly political and this Requiem  no common eulogy in this time  in this twentieth century this inexorable push to a common extinction  the tests of courage placed on us the tests we place on ourselves.   V                  "In the midst of winter I found               within my heart an invinable summer."                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert Camus                            As far beyond definition as beauty, beauty profound as grief  these are not words we use easily, shields for defense, these melodies circling towards a moment where every  note balances time and our knowledge of time  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Benedictus         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my father eighty, for whom each day is a blessing &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my mother already surviving all those back home  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Benedictus         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the child I was I can only begin to remember not needing ever to know what it is we should live for  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Qui venit         this autumn without rain each day a few more leaves  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lux aeterna         turning until every tree in town celebrates sunlight we hardly feel we deserve  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Requiem   holding our breath  each leaf on each tree poised for the least wind.

        Money!   I just got my first real paycheck ever!  Man, I definitely didn't grasp this whole "getting paid" thing.  For some reason, I keep thinking that I'm doing this teaching thing for free, like I always have.  Guess I've just been a student for too long.  Getting paid sure sweetens the deal, and also helps me put up with a whole lot more crap...  Woo-hoo!  Maybe I can start getting OUT of debt now...

        I get paid tomorrow!   What a horrible day teaching.  However, there is a good side to the job... I get my first real paycheck tomorrow!  I am stoked.  But for now, I've given the day just about all I have to give... and it's just shat on me left and right.  A few messages to people in my thoughts:  CDN:  I hope your auditions kicked ass.  Heard not too many guys showed up -- but you guys'd be fine without taking anyone anyway.  Once you all get your feet on the ground running with whatever lineup you have, it'd be nice to stop by sometime and say hello.  Lauren:  I know you rocked the Fruits' world tonight.  Glad things went well.  Love you babe.  ...that's about all for now.  I'm gone.

        Bad teacher!  Bad!   Wow.  I was a horrible chorus teacher today for my 5th and 6th grade chorus.  Man, some of those kids are just not going to make it out of the semester in that group.  I did not have control.  We didn't do much of any usefulness today, in case you're wondering.  Just couldn't happen with the way some kids were acting.  One kid actually put another in a headlock on the risers!  I mean, what was going on?  I DO have a significant number of the kids sold, though.  Most of them DO want to be there and they know I do, too.  I just need to step on the troublemakers fast and hard to remind them that it's my class and not theirs.  Sigh... nobody's perfect.  Not even me.  On the bright side, my general music classes are shaping up all right.  I'm actually looking forward to those far more than chorus right now.  My 5th graders are the best people in the world.  I think everyone should be a fifth grader.  Maybe even me.  I need to seriously mellow out right now.  I can do this, I know I can.  I just need a better plan of attack.  And it is an attack, believe me.  Check out a middle school chorus sometime -- you'll understand.

      In the doldrums a bit.  Not quite the apocalypse things have been anymore, thank you very much.  I'm grateful for that.  But not quite as nice as I'd like, either.  Things are just kind of stagnating.    Teaching is such an up-and-down ride.  It's exhilarating and heartbreaking, sometimes both within the time frame of 5 minutes.  Just when you think you have something figured out, **POOF**!  You're wrong.  Figuring out who belongs to which personality is bad enough, but realizing that kids' personalities can change by the minute is sometimes enough to want to throw in the towel.    My sixth graders, as a class, are a trying bunch.  It would be easier if I could just write them off and not care at all.  But there are always some good kids in the bad bunch.  I guess that's good -- keeps me coming back for them, if nothing else.  Lauren and I are on the mend.  The trouble is that the seamstress is blind.  So, whether the mending creates a blanket, shirt, or pair of pants remains to be seen.  However, a sewn and mended SOMETHING has to be better than a torn and hewn ANYTHING, right?  I think so.  I am still at school.  4:15pm.  And I'll be here till 6pm today.  Select Chorus starts today.  I hope it turns out okay.  I don't think I can deal with another group I'd rather avoid.  Which reminds me -- I think I have more work to do.  I'm still here.  Give a call, come visit sometime.  It would be nice to see you.

      I ask you this:  why would I, a person who is self-declaredly reasonably happy in his life, spend so much time looking at travel information?  As if I am trying to escape something?  I have no idea why this is so.  I don't know what I'm trying to do.  But I do know that I have the travel bug.  I've had it for a while.  And it seems to be getting stronger.  I want to take ME back.  Reclaim myself for me in a sort of neo-Odyssean quest.  Or more likely something much less poetic, if still personally meaningful.  I don't know where to start.  Or even WHEN to start.  Or if I should.  Have I mentioned to anyone that I could very well be a modern-day reincarnation of Hamlet?  We'll just overlook for a moment that he was a work of fiction and pretend that he actually lived.  His indecision seems to speak from my lips.  I hate when I try to make sense of myself or my world or anything and it all just bumbles up into some unintelligible blob of crap that makes no sense at all.  What to do... what to do?

      It gets kind of lonely when you live with one other person and they get so tired at work and class that all they want to do is sleep when they get home.  Yes, I think it is.  Sigh.  Sometimes I hate evenings.  Especially when I have too much time to think.  I suppose things could be worse.  My job is starting to take off... although I still don't quite get how to teach a chorus that doesn't care.  I'm too damn nice.  Maybe I should swear more.  And wear chains.

       in search of inspiration I'm feeling uninspired... as though I am not using my talents enough... like I'm stuck in a cage, unable to stretch my muscles.  I don't know what to do.    All the usual thoughts are coming back to me.  I'm flooded with visions of moving to San Diego, California (which for some reason is the land of opportunity for me -- or maybe just change? the weather is DEFINITELY a large reason), leaving my job at the end of the year, grad school, Peace Corps, teaching English in a foreign land, or just becoming a professional musician -- maybe joining a pro vocal band or something.  This can't be all that life is, can it?  Opportunity is out there.  I know that.  The trouble is that I'm such a gregarious person.  If I'm going to embark on a new phase in life, I want a friend there.  So I either need to find someone who will do that, or just get over it and do it myself.  Or perhaps I should just settle like everyone else.  Stay where I am, doing what I do, never trying to do anything else.  To the last, I say: Fuck that.  I refuse to stagnate, I refuse to burn out, I refuse to lose passion and love for life.  I just don't know what's the next step for me.  Anyone up for an adventure?  Give me a call, I just might do anything.

       Another week... Monday has come and almost gone, and with it the dawn of another week.  I think this one's going to be different.  I've stopped acting like the world's victim and am taking things into my own hands with responsibility and all that stuff.  Right.  Lots of stuff going on... got new glasses yesterday which are just the best.  I took April with me for advice to make sure I didn't walk out with nasty ugly frames.  I think I did good.  You'll have to judge for yourself.  It's nice to have glasses that are strong enough to be usable instead of the old ones I had with out-of-date prescriptions... blurry... caused headaches... ya, they're gone now.  School tomorrow.  Then a half day on Wednesday, and Thanksgiving on Thursday with Lauren's family.  Apparently lots of alcohol and jamming and food will happen in Hebron.  I hope so.  Sounds like fun.  Then I'm going home for the rest of the weekend.  I hope my parents and I can just enjoy each other's company.  That would be nice -- to be able to relax in my own house.  It's been a while.  Feeling good -- it's alright. (name that tune!)

       Much needed solitude Tonight was an unexpected gift.  I spent most of the afternoon wishing I had other people to hang out with tonight and trying unsuccessfully to make plans.  After all my options were exhausted, I finally settled in and had a really nice evening here by myself relaxing and getting back in touch with myself.  Things with me and my mental health are still going really well for the most part, but it's nice to just be me here alone for a little while so I can hear myself think.  This weekend is supposed to be absolutely beautiful for weather.  And I have no ideas on what to do, and nobody to share it with.  Poop.  I just want to be outside and enjoy what's left of nature before it all goes kaput for the winter.  And somehow it's always better to share it with someone than to traipse around the woods by myself.  Anyone else feel the same way?  I think some guitar playing is in order.  I feel inspired.  Who cares that it's 3am?  And I'm not lonely.

       Some old words by Whitman This is what you shall do: Love the earth and sun and the animals, despise riches, give alms to every one that asks, stand up for the stupid and crazy, devote your income and labor to others, hate tyrants, argue not concerning God, have patience and indulgence toward the people, take off your hat to nothing known or unknown or to any man or number of men, go freely with powerful uneducated persons and with the young and with the mothers of families, read these leaves in the open air every season of every year of your life, re- examine all you have been told at school or church or in any book, dismiss whatever insults your own soul, and your very flesh shall be a great poem and have the richest fluency not only in its words but in the silent lines of its lips and face and between the lashes of your eyes and in every motion and joint of your body. . . . . . .    Walt Whitman, Leaves of Grass

       Fun with Myers-Briggs I took an online Myers-Briggs personality test tonight at  urlLink http://similarminds.com/  and wasn't terribly surprised by the results.  The interesting part was that the description I found of my personality type (ENFP) was very accurate.  I pasted it below.  Give a quick read and tell me what you think.    The Inspirer   As an ENFP, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you take things in primarily via your intuition. Your secondary mode is internal, where you deal with things according to how you feel about them, or how they fit in with your personal value system.   ENFPs are warm, enthusiastic people, typically very bright and full of potential. They live in the world of possibilities, and can become very passionate and excited about things. Their enthusiasm lends them the ability to inspire and motivate others, more so than we see in other types. They can talk their way in or out of anything. They love life, seeing it as a special gift, and strive to make the most out of it.   ENFPs have an unusually broad range of skills and talents. They are good at most things which interest them. Project-oriented, they may go through several different careers during their lifetime. To onlookers, the ENFP may seem directionless and without purpose, but ENFPs are actually quite consistent, in that they have a strong sense of values which they live with throughout their lives. Everything that they do must be in line with their values. An ENFP needs to feel that they are living their lives as their true Self, walking in step with what they believe is right. They see meaning in everything, and are on a continuous quest to adapt their lives and values to achieve inner peace. They're constantly aware and somewhat fearful of losing touch with themselves. Since emotional excitement is usually an important part of the ENFP's life, and because they are focused on keeping "centered", the ENFP is usually an intense individual, with highly evolved values.   An ENFP needs to focus on following through with their projects. This can be a problem area for some of these individuals. Unlike other Extraverted types, ENFPs need time alone to center themselves, and make sure they are moving in a direction which is in sync with their values. ENFPs who remain centered will usually be quite successful at their endeavors. Others may fall into the habit of dropping a project when they become excited about a new possibility, and thus they never achieve the great accomplishments which they are capable of achieving.   Most ENFPs have great people skills. They are genuinely warm and interested in people, and place great importance on their inter-personal relationships. ENFPs almost always have a strong need to be liked. Sometimes, especially at a younger age, an ENFP will tend to be "gushy" and insincere, and generally "overdo" in an effort to win acceptance. However, once an ENFP has learned to balance their need to be true to themselves with their need for acceptance, they excel at bringing out the best in others, and are typically well-liked. They have an exceptional ability to intuitively understand a person after a very short period of time, and use their intuition and flexibility to relate to others on their own level.   Because ENFPs live in the world of exciting possibilities, the details of everyday life are seen as trivial drudgery. They place no importance on detailed, maintenance-type tasks, and will frequently remain oblivous to these types of concerns. When they do have to perform these tasks, they do not enjoy themselves. This is a challenging area of life for most ENFPs, and can be frustrating for ENFP's family members.   An ENFP who has "gone wrong" may be quite manipulative - and very good it. The gift of gab which they are blessed with makes it naturally easy for them to get what they want. Most ENFPs will not abuse their abilities, because that would not jive with their value systems.   ENFPs sometimes make serious errors in judgment. They have an amazing ability to intuitively perceive the truth about a person or situation, but when they apply judgment to their perception, they may jump to the wrong conclusions.   ENFPs who have not learned to follow through may have a difficult time remaining happy in marital relationships. Always seeing the possibilities of what could be, they may become bored with what actually is. The strong sense of values will keep many ENFPs dedicated to their relationships. However, ENFPs like a little excitement in their lives, and are best matched with individuals who are comfortable with change and new experiences.   Having an ENFP parent can be a fun-filled experience, but may be stressful at times for children with strong Sensing or Judging tendancies. Such children may see the ENFP parent as inconsistent and difficult to understand, as the children are pulled along in the whirlwind life of the ENFP. Sometimes the ENFP will want to be their child's best friend, and at other times they will play the parental authoritarian. But ENFPs are always consistent in their value systems, which they will impress on their children above all else, along with a basic joy of living.   ENFPs are basically happy people. They may become unhappy when they are confined to strict schedules or mundane tasks. Consequently, ENFPs work best in situations where they have a lot of flexibility, and where they can work with people and ideas. Many go into business for themselves. They have the ability to be quite productive with little supervision, as long as they are excited about what they're doing.   Because they are so alert and sensitive, constantly scanning their environments, ENFPs often suffer from muscle tension. They have a strong need to be independent, and resist being controlled or labelled. They need to maintain control over themselves, but they do not believe in controlling others. Their dislike of dependence and suppression extends to others as well as to themselves.   ENFPs are charming, ingenuous, risk-taking, sensitive, people-oriented individuals with capabilities ranging across a broad spectrum. They have many gifts which they will use to fulfill themselves and those near them, if they are able to remain centered and master the ability of following through.

       New template... again! Well, it's another template for the blog.  I just couldn't deal with the last one - too avant-garde and not functional enough for me.  So I went with the generic Blogger thing.  At least it doesn't get in the way of my writing now.

       Love -- er, logic -- conquers all I'm in a rush, as usual.  I'm going to Worcester to see Mom and Dad for lunch.  But it's been a while since I wrote and I thought I would post an update.  Things are better... much better.  I'm myself again.  Lauren and I are through.  We both agreed that we're horrible for each other and would never work in the long run, for many reasons.  But right now we're great friends.  So she's still living here.  For the time being, that's working out just fine and dandy.  If anything will mess it up, it will be either me or her finding someone else and dating them.  I'm not sure our living arrangement will survive that.  So, for now, things are great.  I'm in the healthiest state of mind I've had in months.  So I'm going with it.  But this time, my eyes are open.  And if it doesn't work, I'll deal with it then.

       Some poetry  The Tide Rises, The Tide Falls   Henry Wadsworth Longfellow   The tide rises, the tide falls, The twilight darkens, the curlew calls; Along the sea-sands damp and brown The traveler hastens toward the town, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnd the tide rises, the tide falls.  Darkness settles on roofs and walls, But the sea, the sea in darkness calls; The little waves, with their soft, white hands Efface the footprints in the sands, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnd the tide rises, the tide falls.  The morning breaks; the steeds in their stalls Stamp and neigh, as the hostler calls; The day returns, but nevermore Returns the traveler to the shore. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnd the tide rises, the tide falls.

       An old friend revisited I know now what my problem is.  Well, I already knew, but I think I can deal with the first part now.  Baby steps.  But baby steps in the right direction, for once.  I went to Anagha's tonight and hung out with her and Ros and Tony.  If you had told me three days ago that I'd be sitting in the same room with them and enjoying it, I would have laughed at you.  Man, was I wrong.  And, it turned out -- scared.  I wish I had realized that sooner and not wasted all this time being unplugged from people I have missed for a long time.  I don't feel like trivializing the events and conversations here, so I won't.  But suffice to say that we're back on the right track to friendship.  I couldn't be more glad about that.  It's been far too long, for too many meaningless reasons.  The prodigal son returns?  I don't know what I meant by that.  But it seemed to make sense.  Maybe you'll get it.

       Unrest I feel much better than I have in a week, even though I didn't get what I asked for and thought I wanted.  Lauren's gone to UConn for the night with Rubyfruit, and I'm here by myself.  For the first time in God knows how long, I'm relaxed and not depressed.  I guess that can't be a bad thing, right?  I just hope that this isn't a false sense of peace and that I did the right thing.  For now, I am just grateful to be feeling more like my old self again than I have in a long, long time.

       Tensions to their breaking point I just asked Lauren to move out.  Things have spiralled out of control.  She's now upstairs playing guitar and singing, and it sounds like she's crying as well.  I sit here listening, not knowing what to do.  I know she can't afford her own place.  She can't even afford this place.  But having her live here keeps me suspended between the dream I still have and the reality I know exists.  My heart feels as if it's being torn from my chest.  I know that I must move on, but don't see the way.  Please help.

       Some cryptic philosophising to avoid speaking the truth Knowledge creates understanding.  Understanding dissolves mystery.  Clarity of vision cannot then be avoided.  But it doesn't make that next step any easier to take.  Or does it?  Some of you know what I'm talking about.  For others, well, I just don't feel like posting it all on here yet.  Give me a call if you're that curious.  Off to school.

       Laughter, the best medicine? "Don't take like too seriously.  You will never get out of it alive."  Everything is better when taken with a good dose of humor.  But laughing can't replace facing reality.  If you can truly stare your worst visions in the face and still find something to laugh about... well, then, that's just about the best there is.  To find a smile in the darkest times is really what my outlook on life is all about.  I should remember that more often.  If only it wasn't so hard to do.

       Carmina Burana Here's the latest: I found a song that I can listen to!  It's an old favorite that I haven't listened to in years.  Here is the first stanza from  Carmina Burana , by Carl Orff.    O Fortuna    O Fortuna velut luna statu variabilis, semper crescis aut decrescis;                     vita detestabilis nunc obdurat et tunc curat ludo mentis aciem, egestatem, potestatem dissolvit ut glaciem.   O Fortune, like the moon you are changeable, ever waxing and waning; hateful life first oppresses and then soothes as fancy takes it; poverty and power it melts them like ice.

      I know that the best way out of adversity is perseverance.  I know that giving up does nothing but prolong the inevitable.  I know all of this.  I just don't care.  I want to curl into a ball and wait for it all to go away, like it's a bad dream or something.  Except it's not a dream, it's real, and it's not going to go away unless I do something.  Logic would say that I should pull my head out of my ass and keep moving forward.  If only it was that easy.  I can't seem to get the energy to do much of anything.  And my trusty confidante is the last person who can help me right now.    So what the hell do I do?  What do you do when everything you know is wrong?  When everything you used to do to comfort yourself, to center yourself, to move on and get over things no longer works?  When your feelgood songs annoy you?  When your sources of inspiration just make things worse?  When you feel cut off and distant from the very friends who want to help -- the only people who can help?  What the fuck happens then?

       Thoughts before the big trip Tomorrow is almost here - the day I thought would NEVER come.  Lauren and I hop a plane tomorrow to go to San Diego for Christmas.  I cannot wait... I need this so much.  School has been great and horrible... but mostly there's just been far too much of it.  I need a break badly.  So, Christmas in San Diego.  Walking on the beach, surfing if possible...!?!?  Wild Animal Park and various other funness will ensue.  Then... THEN...  THEN ... a red-eye to Miami on the 27th, landing the morning of Sunday the 28th... where we take a cruise out of Miami into the Caribbean Sea.  Stopping at Grand Cayman, Jamaica, Costa Maya and Cozumel.  The vacation of vacations.  At least until the next one.  I cannot wait to step on that plane tomorrow.  So, if you're trying to get a hold of me, do it before the 28th.  It would be nice to hear from you all.  Or else wait a week.   I don't think my cell phone will work in the Caribbean, and I don't plan on finding out... it's time to check out of reality for a little while.    The warmest wishes to you and yours.  May you evade the commercialism of the season to discover something far more important.

       Another reason why I love Guster "OK, so sometimes people throw ping pong balls...sometimes people throw little notes.  But tonight, this is the first time that anyone's thrown a used condom up on stage.  Now, a large part of me is completely disgusted because some boy's semen is like, five feet from me.  But part of me is very proud of you for practicing safe sex." -Ryan Miller,  Guster

       O Christmas, Where Art Thou? Christmas can't come fast enough.  I'm in the winter doldrums right now - my concert at school is done, Mostly Baroque is done, Collegium is done (thank GOD.) and the only thing left is Vernon Chorale on the 20th (which should be absolutely AWESOME... you MUST go!).    I am feeling burned out at school.  I care about the kids individually.  There's a lot to like about many of them.  But the large groups as a whole?  I don't know what to do.  I need to pick music for next semester and I can't quite psych myself up enough to do it.  So it's post-concert with no new stuff to learn.  A bad situation.  I need to remember what I like about my job.  In ten days, I will be in San Diego, California.  My aunt and uncle will be waiting, and my parents joining us the following day.  Mark my words: I will live there someday.  I just need that to happen.  Maybe it's my Mecca.  Maybe I just need a dream.  Who cares what the reason... I'm going to make it happen.  Church tomorrow.  Then only one more full week of school.  I feel like a marathon runner in the last part of the Boston Marathon approaching Heartbreak Hill.  I've come so far, but the last part is the worst of all.  I won't give up.  I just don't want to keep on sometimes.  Sometimes I love teaching.  Sometimes I feel like I've made a horrible mistake.  I wish I knew which was true.  Maybe they both are.  December 23rd can't come fast enough.

       New and Improved   The blog finally is off the generic Blogger templates.  It took far longer than it should have, but I had to teach myself about style sheets (CSS) in the process.  So I guess you do learn something new every day.    It's been a nice lazy day holed up inside.  The snow looks pretty deep.  I haven't set foot outside since I got home from school yesterday.  It's been great.  Dinner tonight is being delivered... thanks to Leila for re-awakening my love for chinese food!  I did laundry and a little bit of cleaning, but it's hard to get up the ambition to do too much considering I live here by myself!  The kitten search is on.  I think I'm almost convinced.  I just need to find one I can bond with... no small task!

       Stupid New Hampshire people   For a state that I love so much as New Hampshire, the voters sure are stupid.  John Kerry just won the primary election -- although it's still a "predicted" victory, with only 37% of all votes reported -- and our ex-governor Jeanne Shaheen is gloating with him at his headquarters somewhere in Manchester.  How can people be so blind?  How can they possibly think that a career politician like John Kerry, a man who's spent his lifetime testing the direction of the wind before ever taking a position, is the best man for the job?  His credentials are farcified, (yes, that's now a word) and I can't trust a word he says because of his history of changing his mind and switching positions faster than most people change underwear.  Dean, keep fighting.  Someone's got to beat this joke of a leader at his own game, and nobody else can do it.  But the fact is that Kerry won Iowa  and  New Hampshire, and he needs to be stopped.  Quickly.  I'm going to go breathe now.

       Dean for America   The snow is falling.  I'm sitting at home, watching MSNBC's coverage of the New Hampshire primary as the final fifteen minutes tick down to the close of voting.  They've set up headquarters at McIntyre Ski Area, the place where I learned how to ski -- right around the corner from my house where I grew up!  It's exciting to see something so publicized happening literally two minutes from my house.  I have no idea where my political interest has come from.  I've never cared at all about anything political... I guess I've never seen anyone -- or anyTHING -- that I felt like I should or  could  believe in.  For me, right now, Howard Dean is that person.  I have no idea what's about to happen in the next few minutes... whether or not  Dean will win the primary election... whether his campaign will maintain its momentum through to the Democratic nomination... and whether, if that happens, he can defeat our asshole president from Texas.  All I know is that this guy's given me a reason to care.  For the first time, I feel like someone is addressing things I care about.  I just believe he can do it... and if he does make it to the White House, that he really can change things in this country.  I have to.  I need something to believe in where our country is concerned.  I have no use for anything it stands for right now.  Whether it's troops overseas in a war we shouldn't be fighting, our president trying to pass legislation banning gay marriage and abortion, or the abandonment of the people for the money of corporate America, our country isn't worth the paper our trillions of dollars worth of debt is written on.    We're in trouble.  If things don't change soon, I am seriously considering becoming an expatriate.  If I was living abroad in a foreign country, I'd still be an American citizen, but at least I could deny it.    I'm embarassed to be an American.  And, until recently, I had no reason to ever think that would change.  Howard Dean is that reason.  Anyone with that kind of vision, that kind of passion for his beliefs, and that willingness to speak what he knows is right despite conventional advice -- well, that's my kind of guy.  That's the kind of person I can believe in.  But, perhaps more importantly right now, that's the kind of person I will vote for.  Visit  urlLink deanforamerica.com  to find out more.

       Settling in   I'm here at home in Manchester, Connecticut -- relaxing and trying to wrap my head around the fact that it's over.  And yet it's not an end, but a beginning.  Don't worry.  All is well.  Lauren moved out.  I'm here on a Monday evening, thinking of my friends in collegium at UConn and realizing that for the first time that I can remember, I'm absolutely comfortable in my own apartment.  For whatever reason, in its simplest form, Lauren and I living together was no longer a good thing for me.  And that's that.  Whether there was a valid reason for it or not, I had pretty much gotten to the point where home was not a refuge -- it was another source of stress in my already overstressed life, something I did not need at all.    It is odd being here by myself, but I feel my old instincts kicking in, honed from a lifetime of being an only child.  I can be fine by myself here.  I did this for years.  I have more practice than I care to admit in finding things to do, topics to think about, and ways to occupy my time.  The only thing I can't seem to do is work up the energy to clean this place once and for all.  Despite the face that there's far less stuff here than there was a week or two ago, there's still an awful lot of clutter.    I'm making the place my own, mentally and physically.  I got a new shower curtain, shower head (rain shower, anyone?), and bath mat - cosmetic changes, yes -- but still more relections of my current self than echoes of the past.  I am considering getting a kitten -- which is a topic for which advice and ideas are welcome, considering I have no experience with furry animals at all.  My friends have really helped me out lately, and to you, I say: thank you.  Tom, Liz, Leila, Anagha, Tony, Dan, Clayton, Ali, Bea, Mark, Dan, Dave -- well, you're just the best, and that's all there is to it.  I am still weighing the question of whether or not to return to Lebanon next year.  Teaching middle school has its downsides, that's for sure... but sometimes, just sometimes, something (or, more likely, some one ) comes along that makes it all worth it.  I have no idea what I would do if I did not go back.  There are many, many alternate options that I just don't need to decide on right now.  Right now, I am content in not knowing what lies ahead.    urlLink Rilke  would be proud.  I see new beginnings, where I would have once seen endings.  I see a wonderful person where I would have once seen a stressor and an exiled thorn.  My job is quickly becoming a surmountable obstacle, where I once only saw hopelessness.   So I'm on the upward swing.    But being on the upward swing means, logically, that I am currently not where I want to be, or need to be.  That will take time.  The journey takes time.  I spend so much energy into figuring out where that journey is supposed to take me... what I'm supposed to be... what I am meant to do... that I lose sight sometimes that life is passing me by every moment.  This IS my life.  I've made it, I'm living it... and if I don't pay attention, it will pass before I realize it was ever here.  I bought a t-shirt on the island of St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands a couple years back when I went on a cruise with Linnea.  The shirt, on the back, has the tagline "The journey is the destination."  I love that shirt, partly because of the memories of that beautiful island that it brings me.  But I suspect that I mainly love it so much because of that thought.  The journey  is  the destination.  Sing on, brothers.  Sing on.

       What a pain I "updated" my blog template tonight.  I'm still not convinced it was worth the effort, but it's different.  At least that horrible orange color is gone - I was getting really sick of that.  Anagha and Tony came over today to chill with me and help me start putting this house back together so it looks like mine again.  I have really good friends.  Bedtime - I used all my energy revamping the blog template...

       Words from other people's mouths My first thought to share is the one that's been with me the longest.  I came across this about three years ago in Oakland, CA on a plaque enshrined to Jack London.  He called it his "Credo": I would rather be ashes than dust! I would rather that my spark should burn out      in a brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dry-rot.  I would rather be a superb meteor, every atom      of me in magnificent glow, than a sleepy and       permanent planet.  The function of man is to live, not to exist.  I shall not waste my days trying to prolong them.  I shall use my time. Next is from T.S. Eliot's poem  Four Quartets .  These passages are from the fourth quartet, "Little Gidding": What we call the beginning is often the end And to make and end is to make a beginning. The end is where we start from.  [...]  We shall not cease from exploration And the end of all our exploring Will be to arrive where we started And know the place for the first time. Come to think of it, this next quote has been in my presence even longer than Jack London's credo.  It's scrawled in my quote book from February of my junior year at UConn.  This thought from Mark Twain - or, more accurately, Samuel Clemens - is most appropriate as I struggle with what to do with the rest of my life, in all aspects: Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. I'll write more in a bit.  For now, this is enough.

       Friends are key I had a party last night.  A bunch of my friends showed up and we had a blast.    My parties have changed, though.  Maybe that's normal.  They used to be humongous drunken raves in my apartment in Hilltop.  Now, it's different.  People have to make an effort to get out here.  So it's not just the "let's do this tonight" thing that it used to be.  And I think I like it that way.  Things haven't really toned down all that much, but anyone who's here is one of my really good friends.  That's a difference.  Blogs are a weird thing.  I have a love/hate relationship with mine lately.  I have all these thoughts and feelings that I want to write down, but then I think: do I  really  want the entire Internet to be able to read all this stuff?  Do I want everyone to know what I'm really thinking?  Because I've been burned.  I've let it happen to me far too many times.  And it's left me in a situation where I'm not sure which way is right.  Part of me wants to just shut off, becoming untrusting, cloaked, secretive.  And I know that will never work.  I refuse to become bitter, I refuse to shut down, and I refuse to let my past cloud my potential for happiness.  That's exactly what I'd be doing if I did that.    Bullshit.  But how much sharing is too much?  When does a blog turn into an advertisement of weakness?  Do I really want everyone knowing when things are shitty?  Then there's the other side: if I write what I actually think, it could hurt people.  I don't pretend to always have the nicest thoughts.  I know that we all have nasties sometimes, those dark little thoughts that we sweep under the rug.  I'm not convinced my blog is the place for slandering other people.  So that's why my blog hasn't been updated recently as frequently as I (and some of you) would like.  I just don't want all my thoughts published out there in cyberspace.  I can stay open.  I just can't trust blindly.  Trust in God, but lock your car.  Let art win.

       How clueless is Ehren in the morning? He's so clueless that he had to check the weather on weather.com to find out that it was snowing.    Man, I'm useless when I wake up.  But snow?  More freakin snow?  I'm not sure I'm okay with this.  I wonder what I will be doing at this time next year.  With any luck, it won't be waking up to snow.  Wouldn't it be nice to live somewhere where the weather was so nice that you wound up taking it for granted?  Everyone portrays that as a bad thing in New England.  I think it's more of a defense mechanism to keep the entire population of the Northeast from committing suicide over the bleak, unending winters.  Or maybe I should just go get some coffee.  Off to church.

       Inspiration is returning Well, this morning I did something I haven't done in really long time - I broke out the guitar and played.  Then, as if that wasn't enough, I made a decent recording of my latest favorite song.  It's "Calling The Moon" written by Dar Williams, though I like the recording by Richard Shindell much better.    My mic from my minidisc works like a charm for recording direct to PC, and Cool Edit Pro is an awesome multitrack recording program with effects like reverb and other things that make recording really easy.  Today: Hanging around, cleaning and relaxing.  Give a call if you're bored, or if you want an mp3 of this morning's efforts.

       Tennyson  Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho' We are not now that strength which in old days Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are; One equal temper of heroic hearts, Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.  This inspirational quote has been brought to you by Dr. Dexter Otis Green (a la profile), Lauren Wright (quote queen extraordinaire), Paul Halley (for setting it to music), and Tennyson himself, for writing the damn thing.

       Cleaning the house It isn't just a physical act.  Today it was a metaphor for something far more important than a tidy abode.  Today I told Lauren that she either needs to contribute to the bills or not live here anymore.  I'm tired of paying for everything and getting nothing in return.  I'm tired of hanging on tenaciously to a relationship that not only isn't what I want it to be, it doesn't exist.  I live with a stranger, basically.  A stranger who doesn't pay any bills and is occasionally nice to me.  The rest of the time, she's either not here or in a bad mood, taking it out on me.  I'm very aware that this step will cost me a friend.  But the way I see it is: what do I have to lose?  I don't even have that friend now, though I've been convincing myself I did for months now.  Will people think I'm an asshole?  I doubt it.  Any friends who matter will stand by me and know what is really going on.    I need to move on.  And it won't happen with her here.  Or all her stuff.  If she can pay rent and bills, fine.  Her name IS on the lease.  I can't very well ask a contributing co-signer to leave an apartment she's paying for.  But if not?  Then I can spread out, remove all the reminders, and set to the task of keeping on keeping on.  Without Lauren.    Harsh?  Probably.  Overdue?  Definitely.  In my best interest?  Without a question.  I can't even begin to imagine what is going to happen in the next few weeks.  I bet it will be messier than I could ever conceive.  But I'll take it head on.  I've found strength of will and determination I never thought I had through teaching middle school kids for the past 4 months.    This, too, will pass.    But I could use some help.

       From the archives   Monday, August 11, 2003: Another year, another tumultuous weekend of crazy choristers.  And now most are gone (soon to be all) - and nothing has changed here.  I suppose it's the magic of the mountains, but it changes anyone who will listen to their call.  Everything drops into perspective.  I suppose my greatest fear is that I'll lose that perspective yet again, swapping it for the BS the rest of the world guzzles as fuel.  Or maybe it's that I worrry over how long it will be before I can find that perspective again.  For now, everything fits.  And the best part is that I can be friends with the unknown, not enemies with it.  For now, I am centered.  And tomorrow will have to wait its turn.  Till next time, I'm   Ehren Anybody who was there knows exactly what I was talking about. I wish it wasn't so easy to slip.

       Never and other forgotten promises     For every apparent blessing contains the seeds of danger - every area of trouble gives out a ray of hope - and the one unchangeable certainty is that nothing is certain or unchangeable.   John Fitzgerald Kennedy  urlLink State of the Union address, 1962  Nothing ever turns out the way we think it will.  We live our lives and make our plans for the future, all the while deceiving ourselves that we do not have utter control over our slippery destinies.  Relationships -- of all kinds -- originate in the oddest of places.  People we once thought we would never talk to again, didn't want to see again, and didn't even want to think about again just fall back into our lives, forcing us to redefine our relationship from what was, but shaped by what we now are.  And then there's that word that the English language distilled from many distinct emotions into one ambiguous saccharine package: love.  But let's save that part for later.  This has happened to me very recently.  I never thought I would talk to Lauren again.  Well, most of me did, anyway.  Hoped for it, wished for it, tried my best to ignore that anything had happened and just cut myself off.  I think part of me needed that, and I did an okay job for a while.  Things were going well.  Then -- surprise -- after several chance encounters where I was able to deal quickly and leave, I found myself in a quandary.  I got a call from Lauren saying that Rubyfruit wants to learn the song  Northern Cross  and she didn't know all the parts and would I please come teach it to them?  What a battle.  She couldn't have known -- could she? -- that this would put me in a problem with no satisfactory solution.  I'd been avoiding her.  She must have known.  The answer might have been simple: no, thanks.  But she asked this at a time when I was craving music on a higher level, when I needed to be around and make music with people who just get it.  Add to that the fact that I am friends with several people in the group, and that I hadn't seen them in a while, and the decision became harder.  In the end, I ended up deciding that she'd been really nice about it, that I really wanted to make music, that I love the song, and that I should just get the fuck over it and go.  I didn't expect to leave feeling any different towards her, but I figured I could make it out all right -- that I'd been scratched up before, and that any negative possibilities were just dwarfed by the positives.  So I said sure, why not.  Seeing her wasn't the roller coaster I'd worried it would be, though it wasn't without its twists.  I wasn't able to eat dinner that night, wondering what would happen, despite Tony and Anagha's best efforts to chill me the fuck out.  So I went off to the music building hungry, on edge, and curious.  Eventually, Lauren showed up after I'd been talking with a couple Fruits for a bit.  People say that whatever doesn't kill us makes us stronger, and I think I'd like to add that it makes us wiser, too.  She walked in and at first we barely acknowledged each other, said hi, kept talking, the usual charade as of late.  But eventually we locked eyes, and there she was.  The eyes don't lie.  They're the barometer of the soul.  And I'd like to think that what we both saw there was someone who'd been hurt badly and was cautious to try it again, but also someone who wanted to very much.   Let me pause for a moment to bitch at the English language for its oversimplification of the word "love".  The Chinese have 11 different words that mean love, such as the love between friends, the love between family, or the love of a possession.  Most other languages have several variants, but at least more than one all-purpose Wal*Mart of a word our language offers like LOVE.  So when I use the word here, my meaning is different than Hallmark and Cupid and all that other commercial crap.   What I saw there was love.  Sometimes I think that love is like matter -- it can't be created or destroyed, but it can change states or phases to something different.  What I saw in her eyes said more than words could.  They spoke of past romance, good times and bad, and how that was past now.  But I also saw how it had changed, never really died, into something else.  We understand each other, Lauren and I.  We can annoy the hell out of each other and can probably never have the same kind of relationship we did before because of all we've been through.  But with all that time spent comes a bond, an exchange of a bit of self.  I feel it with everyone I've ever been close with, even people I haven't talked with in years.  Those are the people I remember, the stuff of memories.  And they're impossible to erase, even if you try real hard.  Part of them is part of you, and somewhere in the middle you change each other.  That can't be undone.  So we're just kind of looking at each other, and although all of this happens in a second or two, it's unmistakable.  We're stuck.  Because we've been to hell and back and lived to talk about it.  For better or for worse, we're in this for the long haul.  In whatever form the universe has chosen to bestow, what I see there is love.  I mean something to her.  And her to me.  And we'll never be what we were.  And that's okay.    One of the things that drew me to her, way back, was how we clicked better -- musically -- than I ever had with anyone.  That hadn't changed on Sunday, as I found out.  We split the group into two, and taught the parts we knew best.  Then we combined, and I did what I do best (better than her, I suppose?) -- teach vocal music to an a cappella group.  And it was everything I needed.  I had a great evening.  We made plans to meet the next evening in the music building and play guitar and sing.  I drove in on Monday around 4:45 and after we ran around for a bit, we went downstairs and played and sang.  Still cautious, I had brought printouts of several songs I like that I knew she liked, too, as a peace offering of sorts.  The walls were still up a little but the connection had been made the night before.  So we sang, for an hour or so.  Shaky at first, opening up a bit here, untrusting there, feeling out the other person, but at the end of the hour letting loose with real true music.  And it was perfect.  I'm still on my guard a little with Lauren.  I probably will be for a while.  There is a lot of hurt on both sides to get over.  But the eyes don't lie.  And there is music still unsung.

           Today was a good day.  One of my students started a petition to keep general music at the middle school -- it's been cut for next year as of now.  This sixth grader is just one of the coolest people around.  And I didn't even suggest it -- it's all his idea.  How great is that?  Another student today asked for a picture of me because I'm "the best chorus teacher we've ever had".  Of course, I think this is one of the same students who has a crush on me (oy...) but the sentiment was still nice.  We had yearbook pictures taken in the gym first period during chorus... after which I was supposed to get the girls back on track and run what amounted to a 20-minute rehearsal.  Much to my surprise, I pulled it off.  They sound good.  Not great yet, but they're getting there.  My seventh grade class is producing some great Powerpoint presentations on rock of the 1960's.  They're really getting into it.  My sixth grade class wrote their very own blues lyrics, which they "persuaded" me to sing at the end of the class.  They wrote some great stuff, and we had fun.  My fifth grade class learned two new songs today, quite well, and learned a bit about Chopin as well and what a concerto is.  Last period chorus, the fifth and sixth graders from hell, was another adventure, but a productive one.  I was on fire today and a bunch of the kids didn't know what hit them.  We actually managed to be quiet before singing today, and also stand without bursting into conversation -- a huge accomplishment for this group.  Then, after school, we had a musical rehearsal where the kids finally started singing their heads off.  For once, they were really putting themselves into it.  And they sounded great.  I was sweating my balls off trying to get them to do it, but it was worth it, I think.  Today was a good day.  Fuck *people* who don't seem to think I can do a good job at this.  Fuck them all.  Today, I kicked ass.  And I was an amazing teacher.

       In which I take control   I am almost certain that I cannot teach middle school next year.  This means that the job in Lebanon isn't an option because it involves middle school.  I just don't think I'm cut out for teaching middle school.  I just can't seem to understand kids who don't care -- and thus, I can't teach them effectively.  I need to start looking for another job, either with kids who don't have to be there (high school) or kids who haven't yet become jaded (elementary school, preferably instrumental music).  East Lyme is hiring a full-time high school teacher next year -- involving Choral Music, Theory and Composition, and AP Music -- which I am DEFINITELY applying for.  I feel badly for all the kids at my school who DO love music, or who are at least just happy people.  They're the ones that keep me going back day after day to put up with the rest of them.  But I'm going out of my mind, and I'm starting to believe that there are some things that I just shouldn't do.  Maybe middle school is one of them.  Loki is all about climbing on me and sticking his face in mine as I am trying to write this.  I've been down all evening, and now I come home to this cat with the "Love me!  Now!"  attitude, and it's exactly what I need.  I know that, no matter what's going on, I will get through it.  I just need the right outlook.  I'm going to go play with my cat.  And maybe update my resume.

       music -- my addiction   I am wasting my life.  Or at least it seems that way.  Teaching young children is a noble calling and can be great fun -- but it is absolutely not what I want or need to do with my life.  I need to make music.  And I'm not doing that right now.  I need to be creative, to be around people who will sing and play instruments and create something beautiful.  I want to dedicate my life to pursuing art and music and beauty.  And I don't know where to start.  Right now I have a job that is isolating and does none of these things.  I need to connect with people who want and need the same things I do.    I don't know what kind of music I want to create -- it could be anything that I think I can do well.  Choirs and guitar and singing come to mind.  Anything, or all three, would be good, I think.  I feel like my creativity is stagnating and I'm being suffocated under a pile of irrelevant bullshit -- that is, my life.  I sound depressed.  I guess I am  I do know there is an out.  I don't think my life is a dead end.  I just think that I'm headed in that direction, if I don't change anything for the better.  So I guess I need to do that.  But how?  Does this mean artistic supplements to my teaching?  Does it mean throwing teaching out the window and becoming a professional musician, working shit jobs to pay the rent?  Is one better than the other?  Or does it really matter?    Man, do I need to get my head straightened out.  Or maybe that's the way I got here in the first place...

       Advice for self and others   Keep traveling and seeking adventures.  Climb mountains.  Go new places and find fresh aspects of old favorites.  Live.  Breathe.  Discover.  Love life.  Marvel at beauty.  If you find yourself getting stuck in a rut, change it: a new approach, a new path, new people or surroundings can have amazing results.  But change something -- anything! -- or you risk everything you have come to live for.  Don't whine -- change your reality.  You are never without choice.

       from a refrigerator magnet    For a long time it seemed to me that life was about to begin  real life.  But there was always some obstacle in the way, something to be gotten through first,  some unfinished business, time still to be served, a debt to be paid.  At last it dawned on me that these obstacles were my life.  This perspective has helped me to see there is no way to happiness.  Happiness is the way.  So treasure every moment you have and remember that time waits for no one.  Happiness is a journey, not a destination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Father Alfred D'Souza

       Home sweet home   So I decided: what the hell.  Why not?  I'm at home in New Hampshire visiting with my parents, watching "Remember the Titans" on the Disney Channel.  Ah, saccharin morals.  It's all so easy if you do it the Disney way.  No problem is unsolvable, no hopeless situation unsalvageable.  Enough.  Vacation is turning out to be exactly what I needed.  I don't have to worry about all the crap at school and can concentrate on some of the things that really matter, like friends and philosophy.  I've had some time to do reading and writing.  I've played video games and fought off the Soviet invasion of the United States.  But mostly, I'm enjoying finding me.  I'm going back to the movie.  Cheesy or not, it's good fun.

       Night   Trying to figure out whether to go home for a few days, take a little road trip, or just stay put.  I want to be able to relax and explore and just enjoy life.  Trouble is that I think it's supposed to get REALLY cold the next few days, which sucks big time.  If it was warmer, I'd go somewhere in a snap.  But somehow, walking around some city in below freezing temperatures just isn't my idea of a good time.    Damn this New England winter.  Give me one good prospect, and I'm gone.  Not even New Englanders like cold.  That's why they invented things like hot cocoa and baked beans.  I bet that most people are lying when they say that they'd miss the seasons, just to give themselves a good reason for not either leaving or going nuts.  Nobody would miss having their balls frozen off.  Oh, that's quaint, right?  Fuck that.  So, if you want to hang out, go on a short trip, or move to a warmer climate, I'm your guy -- give me a call.  If not, I might still be your guy, so give me a call anyway to find out.  In fact, just call. :)

       The Voices in Our Heads   Saturday, February 14, 2004 2:48 PM Starbucks  Near Buckland Hills Mall Manchester, CT   (This was one of those times that I started writing without knowing what I was going to say.  I planned on editing it later to make it more cogent, but ended up liking the rambling rant I ended up concocting.  If you're looking for a well-written five paragraph essay, this isn't it.  If you're interested in my search for truth, you've found it.  Either way, you've been warned.)   Ah, Valentines Day.  The day of love and romance.  And inspired by the murder or stoning of a priest thousands of years ago.  Or something like that.  Interesting that love and romance are two separate things.  Ive been in a relationship for more Valentines Days than I care to count.  Its been a while since I was single on February 14th.  Im not really sure what bearing this has on anything, but I just feel like talking.    I am alone in the commercial sense of the word.  I am not buying Valentines Day jewelry or Valentines Day roses or Valentines Day lingerie (not that I ever did!) or anything else that we are supposed to hold so dear on this one day.  My wallet is considerably fuller than it has ever been on this day in the past.  And I still feel fulfilled.    I think that for the first time in my life, Im enjoying creating my own personality.    I have a natural tendency to please.  Add that to a long string of relationships, one right after the other, and you get one confused and lost Ehren.  Somewhere in the middle of it all, I lost my way.  In some ways, for all my bravado, I never had to think for myself.   (I wonder how much of this is crap.  Have I really just been a puppet for years?  Somehow I doubt it.  But regardless  this is interesting.  Lets see where it goes.)   Being in a relationship make certain things easy.  Who will I hang out with?  Right, I have a girlfriend.  Problem solved.  Who should I ask to go on vacation with?  Whoops, forgot  girlfriend!  Who should I try to have sex with tonight?  Well, Im a horrible player, and anyway, I have a girlfriend.    So many decisions become easy as a result of having a girlfriend that its been easy to lose sense of ME in the midst of all the US that occurs.  The development of the US becomes so important  which, in all honesty, it must, to actually create a loving relationship  that the ME either ceases development and goes into stasis, or just takes a permanent vacation.  Its the second part that I am now famous for, and am now spending energy to examine.  Im great at US things: talking, understanding, giving, receiving, just doing nothing together but its the continued development of the ME that I historically have ignored.  Sometimes I think I need remedial classes in myself.    This is, of course, hogwash.  Im the best expert on ME there could possibly be.  Nobody else has lived with ME for quite so long as I have, so I know the idiosyncrasies of ME impeccably well.  I even hear my voice  or to be more correct, voices  trying to tell ME what is really going on in my head and what I should do about it.   Voices, you say?  In my head?  Hes nuts!  People dont have voices in their heads telling them what to do.  Not normal, everyday, good people like us.    Yes, you do.  We all do.  Each facet of our self  our personality  our ME  has a voice.  And it talks to us.  Not about things like aliens invading our mattress or conspiracy theories involving our pet rat (well, not usually), but about the decisions we face everyday.  They talk to us and tell us what they would do and what we should do and pretty much try to run our lives.  As long as you realize that theyre merely parts of ME and not individual entities, theyre perfectly healthy.  Its called self-awareness.  Its called listening to your heart.  Its called following your dreams.  Theyre all our concept of the voices.  So we all have voices in our heads.  And they talk to us.  But I dont always hear them.  And that is the problem so many of us face.  We ignore the voices.  Whether we pretend they dont exist, or get so good at ignoring them that we manage to shut them out altogether, the outcome is the same.  We deny the voices the right to speak.  And in doing so, we cut ourselves off from the one thing that can show us how to bring fulfillment into our lives  the ME.    Your ME knows what you need.  It gets it, understands it all.  By ignoring it, youre ignoring your own true feelings, needs and wants.  Why would you do that?  Maybe youre scared of what might actually happen if you follow your dreams.  Dream-chasing can be a dangerous business.  What if you fail, and your dreams go up in dust?  Can you handle that?  Better to just keep your head down and not try.  But you know, deep down, that you cant do that.  Because youve been doing it, and look where you are.  Youre unhappy because youre ignoring your voices  and they dont lie.  But they can be misunderstood.  You see, they dont always speak plainly.  Sometimes they talk to you in riddles, sometimes in Greek.  And sometimes they dont talk at all, but simply exude intent that youre just supposed to get.  Hell, its hard to understand.  But theyre part of you.  If you dont figure out how to hear them, who will?  And what will become of you if you dont figure out how to listen to yourself?  Im somewhere in the middle of this journey right now.  Im realizing that I have ignored my voices for a long time, and am trying to get back in tune with my ME.  But I dont really understand yet what its trying to say.  Its speaking in languages I dont yet understand, but will someday.  I know that something is not right, but cant see far enough yet to figure out what IS right.  Its a nebulous place Im in.  I could fight it, just go do something,  anything , but what good would that do me?  I really need to just be still and listen.  Give myself time to filter out the static.  And the understanding will come.    I cant bear the thought of wasting my life on useless endeavours.  I wonder if thats possible.  But for now I need to stay in gentle motion, while quieting my heart.  Once I can do that, then I will begin to understand what the voices are telling me.  And this thing called life will start to make sense.  Im not angry at Valentines Day.  Im not sure I ever was.  But I almost feel sorry for myself, for the way I used to feel it was all so  necessary  to be complete.  Because loves not about one day.  Thats called lust.  I know that now.  Love is something far different.  It requires the continued development of the ME while pursuing the US.  Its a balancing act between the two that takes time, patience, and commitment.  And I will find it again.  Maybe this time, Ill be ready for it.

       Zen   It's finally school vacation week.  I never thought I would make it.    I'm off in search of zen and recentering.  A nice, artsy, funky coffeeshop would be perfect... I need a place to relax, read, and write some.  Sadly, this is Manchester and I'm not sure anything like that exists around here.  I suppose Starbucks will have to suffice.    Maybe I should spend a day in New York over break this week -- anyone interested?  Ehren out.

       Whatever   So my blog is turning into a place to whine?  I'm not sure I'm okay with that.  My job sucks, yes.  I hate it, this is true.  Maybe I should deal or do something about it.  But damn, some of these kids just need to be smacked.  And I've never been one for using force to solve problems.  Wire some electrodes to those kids' behinds and zap when they get out of line....  "Ow!" "Hurt like hell, didn't it?  Aren't going to do that again, are you?"  I can dream.  I have to.  Reality blows.

       Vernon Chorale as a symbol... but of what?   I walked into Vernon Center Middle School tonight at 7:30pm exactly for the weekly rehearsal of the Vernon Chorale.  Warm-ups started about ten seconds later.  The usual, nothing exotic, just unison hums and oohs and five-note scales.  And I was moved to tears.  Fortunately, I kept it under control -- what a mess THAT would have caused.  Tears?  Me?  For warm-ups?  I guess I was just struck by the music... the sound of forty voices joining their talents at one time, in one place, together for music.  I don't get that at middle school.  Too many of those kids don't give a fuck about singing at all to ever unite the group in ANYTHING, let alone music or voices or...  Why do I do it?  Would teaching high school be any different?  Would it be any different in the town I teach in?  Do I really want to put myself through this for another year?  And that begs the question:  If not teaching, then what?  What would I do?  Maybe what CAN'T I do is a better question.  I do have a lot of options that I could pursue.  I thought I could do this for a while.  But it's tearing me up.  I wonder if there's another reason that is behind this, but I can't see it.    ............  In other news, I saw Rufus Wainwright last night at Toad's Place in New Haven with Anagha.  GREAT concert -- we were in the front row!  It's about time I pull that off for a concert.  He was close enough to touch when he was playing guitar, and put on an amazing show.  I bought his latest CD, "Want One", which is awesome.  Check it out sometime.

       Why oh why   Why -- the question of my life.  I always ask it, and rarely answer it.  I really hate my job right now.  I don't enjoy teaching.  Well, I don't enjoy it enough to justify doing it.  I like parts of it, but there's just so much... crap.  I feel run-down.  Thanks to my guitar -- I've been into playing lately, and it helps.    Vernon Chorale tonight.  Not terribly excited about that.  Oh, and Loki has been missing for almost two days.  I'm sure he's hiding somewhere, but wherever he is, it's a good spot.

       Relaxation   I'm typing this while sitting on the couch with my little kitten curled up on my lap.  He's doing fine.  Let me say that again, for those of you who didn't know: HE'S doing fine.    Yup, I took Karma to an immunization clinic yesterday, where the vet kindly informed me that she is a he, and only 10 weeks old rather than the four months I had been told.  Surprise!  So the name Karma doesn't really fit anymore -- it just has a female ring to it.  Karma has therefore been renamed Loki, after the Norse god of trickery and sneaky things.  It seems to fit... :)  This cat has really taken to people over the past few days.  He really seems to enjoy meeting new people, as long as they will scratch his head and belly.  He's just still not too fond of wide open places yet -- he likes dark and enclosed spaces better.  But for all I know, that's normal for all kittens!  It's been a good weekend.  Laundry, guitar, relaxation, thought, refocusing, visiting friends (right -- I went to Dan and Clayton's last night), it's all been just what I need.  But I am still convinced that I need more -- that I AM more -- than I am now.  I know that I will figure it all out in due time, and that there is no need to worry or stress about any of this now... but that only makes it a little easier and doesn't fix the problem.  If I'm learning anything about how to look at myself and life, it's that I just need to sit back and chill out.  I think Loki will help me figure that out.  Cats have it made.  They eat and sleep and get scratched and rubbed and massaged... and that's about it.  I need to think more like a cat.  They're on to something.  More later, maybe.  I'll be around.  Give a call if you want to talk.  Dinner and a movie sounds like a plan.

       Ruminating   Back to bed didn't so much happen.  I made it INTO bed, only to have my mind start philosophizing... so blogging it is.  There are times in our lives when everything slows down... when we can toss off our cares and routines to just breathe a little slower and think a little more clearly.  Today seems to be one of those days for me.    I can hear people tromphing around in the apartments next to me.  Considering it's 6:23am, I can only assume that they're getting their souls ready for work or school or whatever it is that they do each day.    And I am here in bed, listening to it all.  The noise they make isn't much... in fact, sometimes it dies down completely.  But I know that in my little space I call home, there are at least two people who are not thinking the same way I am right now.  How can they?  How can someone follow their morning routine, coaxing their body into one more day, while stepping back from the whole thing to just think?  They'd be late to work.  Or they wouldn't go at all.  It's an interesting concept.  Why do we go to work at all?  The easiest answer is "to make money".  But I'm not sure of that.  Seems like, if I really wanted to, I could save enough money so that I wouldn't have to work all the time.  We spend so many hours a week putting up with crap -- for what? So that we can have a more expensive car?  A bigger house?     "We clutter the earth with our inventions, never dreaming that possibly they are unnecessary -- or disadvantageous. We devise astounding means of communication, but do we communicate with one another? We move our bodies to and fro and incredible speeds, but do we really leave the spot we started from? Mentally, morally, spiritually, we are fettered. What have we achieved in mowing down mountain ranges, harnessing the energy of mighty rivers, or moving whole populations about like chess pieces, if we ourselves remain the same restless, miserable, frustrated creatures we were before? To call such activity progress is utter delusion. We may succeed in altering the face of the earth until it is unrecognizable even to the Creator, but if we are unaffected wherein lies the meaning?" &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp-Henry Miller Am I making my point?  Why do we hold things so dear that mean nothing at all when you change from a zoom to a panoramic lens?  The big picture is everything.  Or at least it should be.  I just can't help but feel that we've lost our way.  And I don't think I'm the only one.    Is anyone with me on this?

       So impatient   I need to chill out.  And so does this cat.    She wants nothing to do with me right now... unless she's in her kitty carrier, in which case she'll let me do pretty much anything, like scratch her ears, rub her belly, you name it.  But she does NOT want to leave that thing.    Sure it's safe for her.  I get that.  But to NEVER leave?  I think my kitten needs counseling or shock therapy.  She's got to leave sometime, right?  I mean, what the hell?  Everything I read says that I should play with her and handle her several times a day from the beginning so she gets used to it.  It also says I should let her come out on her own terms.  This, of course, assumes she comes out at all.  Cat experts, leave your advice?

       Kitten training   This kitten is smart.  Karma used the litter box her first try.  I woke up this morning and poof!  I never thought I would be so excited to scoop kitten poop out of a litter box.  Other than that, training a cat is like training a woman.  They just don't do what you tell them and you make an ass out of yourself trying to do it.  Sometimes she seems to like me.  Other times, she's got no use for me at all.  But there's a flip side: if I figure her out, my next relationship should be a snap.  Come visit!

       Weekend   Ah... the weekend.  It's been a good one.  I've seen a lot of Tony, which has been great.  It's been far too long since he and I have hung out.  My house is my own again, and most everything has a place.  The only things left sitting around are just clutter, but everything major is taken care of and put away.  What a great feeling.  I spent far too much time editing web code this weekend.  I should start up a part-time web design business on the side.  I bet I could make a pantload of money.  I also hung out with Anagha on Friday and hit the gym today.  Super Bowl tomorrow still needs plans - so I need ideas, people.  I'm feeling pensive.  But it's not a bad thing anymore.  More like personal reflection for self-growth.  Sometimes I think that thinking is what I do best.  Even if it's not, I sure do it a lot.  I feel like writing poetry or reading literature or maybe just sitting and staring at the wall.  But I have church tomorrow.  Good thing they pay me money, or I'd be one frequently truant bastard.  Getting up early on a Sunday morning should be illegal.  The sad part is that I get up LATER for church than I do during the week.  It used to be the other way around.  I can't believe I leave the house by 6:30am for school.  The kids don't focus well that early in the morning, and neither do I.    It's a bummer that they pay me to do just that!  So I've become a coffee addict, like so many other scores of teachers everywhere.  And now I know how they got that way!  I'm typing this from my laptop in bed while chatting with friends on IM.  It's great - just like all my friends are in bed with me!  Well, not exactly like that, I guess.  But it's great that I can do this.  Wireless networking is the shit.  I feel like I am wise beyond my years sometimes... like I just feel things differently.  Sometimes I think I've been on this earth for far longer than my 24 years.  I consider the ideas of i  ...  Well, that settles it.  I just fell asleep while blogging.  I suppose all good things will have to wait  until tomorrow.  I am seeing a kitten tomorow... can't wait!  for now, I'm drifting off to sleep already...

       "Wanting Memories" - Ysaye Maria Barnwell   I am sitting here wanting memories to teach meto see the beauty in the world through my eyes.  I am sitting here wanting memories to teach meto see the beauty in the world through my own eyes.  You used to rock me in the cradle of your arms. You said you'd hold me till the pains of life were gone. You said you'd comfort me in times like theseand now I need you. Now I need you, and you are gone.  I am sitting here wanting memories to teach meto see the beauty in the world through my eyes.  I am sitting here wanting memories to teach meto see the beauty in the world through my own eyes.  Now the world outside is such a cold and bitter place. Here inside I have few things that will console. And when I try to hear your voice above the storms of life, then I remember all the things that I was told.  I think on the things that made me feel so wonderful when I was young; I think on the things that made me laugh, made me dance, made me sing. I think on the things that made me grow into a being full of pride. I think on these things, for they are truth.  I know a please, a thank you, and a smile will take me far. I know that I am you and you are me and we are one. I know that who I am is numbered in each grain of sand. I know that I've been blessed again and over again.  I am sitting here wanting memories to teach meto see the beauty in the world through my eyes.  I am sitting here wanting memories to teach meto see the beauty in the world through my own eyes.

       Fighting a cold   Heading to bed even earlier than last week - it's before 9.  But I felt like shit today... was suspended on a cloud of drugs somwhere between the caffeine from my coffee and the downers that are in Robitussin.  And I tried to teach like that.  What a joke.  I have drugs now and am preparing for slumber.    Feeling good about myself tonight.  I think I helped a friend.  It's a nice feeling.  If I could only get through this week...

       Great weekend   Things are interesting.  I've spent the afternoon and evening here at home by myself, and as usual, things are getting cerebral.     The CMEA conference on Friday was exactly what I needed, in many ways I wasn't aware of.  It was good to see people from my graduating class from UConn.  It was great to be around other music teachers.  And my seminar was... well, it was really good.  I was proud of it.  I was nervous, but got off to a good start.  My personality came through even when I wasn't the smoothest of talkers, and some of the 25(!!!) people there really seemed to enjoy it.  I wonder if I can take my own advice?  I sure had a lot of good stuff to say on Friday.  Stuff about not burning out and the like.  Man, it felt good to do that... even if I did it on my own instead of with people.  Actually, especially because I did it on my own.    I very much need to start calling parents.  I just hate confrontation.  I don't like to call parents and tell them that their pride and joy is being a pain in my rear end.  But my sanity may depend on it.  April and May could become reeeeally long.  Plus, there might be other consequences too, that I can't discuss here.  But they wouldn't be good.  I need to start calling parents right after school.  Even though I have rehearsal until 5pm.  Gah.  Had a great weekend.  Partied two nights in a row.  Man, it's been a long time since I did that.  My attitude today has been just kind of mellow as a result.  Paychecks are nice.  Going to go think too much again.

       So tired   It's been a while since I last wrote.  Life is in the Spring Sprint right now.    The musical at school is in full swing.  I'm working ten-hour days right now and will be until the end of next week.  I can't wait for Monday, April 5th -- I will actually leave school at 2:30!  Man, I can't even remember the last time I did that.  I've been seeing a lot of my friends lately.  It's good for me.  I have amazing friends.  My CMEA presentation is Friday.  It's definitely still in the building stages.  Typical me.  My cat has started pushing his food/water dish around the bathroom.  I have no idea why.  I didn't really say this would be an interesting entry.  But I was out till midnight last night drinking with people from the Vernon Chorale, and I must needs sleep.   I think I'm going to push myself to go crash out now.  Party on Friday in Willimantic.  Free this weekend -- who's up for hanging out?  All you college kids are probably laughing at me, heading to bed at 9:55.  I have but three words for you:  Just you wait.

       Sitting   For a brief while, I sit.  The world whooshes by.  Things are not always what they seem.  I don't need to be everything to everyone.  I only need to be myself to me.  My sense of self has developed a case of wanderlust lately, leaving to wander as it sees fit.  Occasionally it graces me with its presence.  For a brief while, I sit.  Understanding fills the void.  I understand that dreams are crucial to survival.  I know now that not even lemmings follow each other blindly where they're told (a common misconception started by Disney), and human beings certainly should be no different.  Sadly, this is not the case.  People are lemmings more than lemmings are lemmings.  For a brief while, I sit.  Jazz wafts to my ears.  Many things are important.  Not every desire can be fulfilled.  But I need to be me.  And I'm finally beginning to understand the implications of what that means.    For a brief while, I sit.    Everything begins to focus.

       Poetry   I'm in a rare mood.  Optimistic, content, contemplative.  The kind I used to have quite often before this year reared its ugly head.  I miss feeling like this.  I plan on enjoying it.    Poetry is Cassandra's voice.  I don't read enough of it.  There are tons of great websites with countless poems I've never read or heard of before.  An old, well-loved poem is a great friend, but fresh voices with new spins on the world are most welcome.  Try  urlLink Poetry 180 , a website dedicated to getting high school students into poetry.  There's 180 poems... one for each school day of the year.  If I was a high school English teacher -- maybe in another life -- I would be drooling over this site.  As it is, I just love roaming and reading things I've never read before.  Check it out.

       March 5th   Another excerpt from the middle school festival in Groton.  This one's eerily similar to something I wrote in Vermont.  Or somewhere.  Maybe Diana's Pool?  I know I've used the Guster quote before.   The past has passed and we cannot take it back.  But we also cannot relive it or resurrect it.  Its not a phoenix.  And what was, was, and is not now.  What is, is.  What is comes from what was, but it is not what was any more than what is determines what will be.  What a cool argument that was.  I think I baked my brain.

       From March 6th   This story was written by Leila and I on March 6th at Fitch High School in Groton, CT.  I got this idea from Meaghan and Erik and modified it -- on the ACDA trip to San Antonio, we rotated writing sentences; here, each of us took turns writing paragraphs.  If you know us, it's pretty easy to figure out who wrote what.  I don't think it'll be submitted for publication anytime soon, but it's worth a read.  Have fun -- we did :).  Once upon a time, a cat sat on my head.  It kept me awake all night.  And I yelled at it.  But not too loud.  By the way, the cats name was Keegan OMalley.  As you would expect, he was from Greece.  His owner used to call him her little Greek olive.  He didnt like the nickname (as it made him look like a sissy), so he hopped the first boat to the old country.  Thats Poland to you.  So Keegan, being a trilingual refugee, decided to eat pork for dinner.  While in Poland, Keegan discovered the wide world of Catholicism.  The polack kind.  And at Christmas, little girls would wear wreaths on their heads, with candles in them.  Keegan had adopted a little girl to be his person, and he was shocked and dismayed when she fell asleep in her candle crown.  Keegan barely made it out in time.  The girl was not so lucky.  But staring at the beauty of the flames, Keegan realized that his true calling was as an arsonist.  He met his first obstacle when he tried to strike a match.  Drat humans and their opposable thumbs!  He tried cigarette lighters and flint and steel, all to no avail.  He was about to give up the arson idea completely when he finally came up with a way to ignite his glorious blazes.  On a pondering-type walk through a park one twilit evening, Keegan fell asleep and dreamed.  In the dream, he saw a shape smokifying around in the shadows.  He meowed out, and who should appear but the cloven-footed darling of the underworld?  With a very hazy middle, Keegan remembered vaguely wishing he could start fires, a brief mention about something to do with souls, and suddenly, with a start, he awoke!  The wet grass tickled his nose, and with a sneeze, the nearest tree ignited.  Toxic boogers are cool.  The fire jumped from the first tree to another, and another, and still again, swiftly turning the dry forest tinder into a raging inferno.  Keegan leapt to his hind legs and danced a whirling dervish as he rushed toward town, away from the hellfire he had sneezed into being.  Traveling by boat became a problem, but Keegan kept lots of benadryl handy and eventually made it all over the world.  Given that the devil had him in thrall, he lived a very long time.  He lived, in fact, until the end of the world.  And when Jesus came down with his flaming sword..poor Jesus.  Keegan had a cold.  The end.

       Toad the Wet Sprocket   Lyrics for your reading pleasure, from one of the best bands of all time:   Walk On The Ocean   We spotted the ocean at the head of the trail Where are we going, so far away And somebody told me that this is the place Where everythings better, everythings safe  Walk on the ocean Step on the stones Flesh becomes water Wood becomes bone  And half an hour later we packed up our things We said wed send letters and all those little things And they knew we were lying but they smiled just the same It seemed theyd already forgotten wed came  Walk on the ocean Step on the stones Flesh becomes water Wood becomes bone  Now we're back at the homestead where the air makes you choke And people dont know you and trust is a joke We dont even have pictures, just memories to hold That grow sweeter each season as we slowly grow old   Something to Say  (a lesser-known song)  Hes got a thing about losing control Carries it a mile just to see how far hell go And he brushes up his chops as he tries to fake a smile A friend indeed but what I needs someone wholl stay a while Someone to stay a while  You can bend my ear We will talk all day Just make sure Im around When youve finally got something to say  He drops hints but he wont tell you whats really on his mind But I know if I look that its easy to find And hes got a way with his anger and the way he lets it show Like the smoldering smoke when the fires left the coals When the fire has left the coals  You can take me down To show me your home Not the place where you live But the place where you belong You can bend my ear We will talk all day Just make sure Im around When youve finally got something to say  And what are you meaning by I dont deserve this life?   His door is always open and hes always got the time To give a little something even though he gets behind And your trips become his and your lives are intertwined But like the horse with the junkie its all in your mind Its all in your mind  You can take me down To show me your home Not the place where you live But the place where you belong You can bend my ear We will talk all day Just make sure youre around When Ive finally got something to say

       On the mend   It's been a good weekend.  I think I should mention a bit about that so people don't freak out too much.  I managed to see friends several times this weekend despite the fact that I was fighting a nasty cold -- which kept me from sleeping much on Friday night.  I visited my cousin Jen and her husband John in Wilmington, Vermont, after the ski club's trip to Mount Snow on Friday.  It was good to see her, and her mom Jean, who just happened to be visiting for the day.  Had a good conversation with Mark on Saturday, then Ali, Dan, and Leila came over later on to hang out.  Sunday was recovery day, where I relaxed, slept in, ate when I could and watched some movies.  I also did taxes.  Yay for getting a bunch of money back, especially after my IRS ass-pillaging last year to the tune of owing about $300.    So there are things to be thankful for.  My two-year plan is going into effect, with grad school on the horizon for Fall 2005.  My search starts soon.  So there's still another year that I'll be around here with everything that's become home.  Home.  What a great feeling.  All my experiences here, good and bad, have made this place feel like home.  I belong.  I think I can deal with that.  For further details, give me a call.  We'll get a beer and I'll tell you all you want to know.  :)  Sleep loose, all...  ......  This blog is going out to a friend who has learned today the importance of not missing a flight.  I'm sure Lauren now knows the intricacies of the Memphis airport better than most people alive today.  Enjoy the Radisson and keep smiling.

       Evenings   Lots to write about.  No ambition to do so.  Having a great time.  Wish I could just stay happy more often.  I'm pretty damn tired of the rollercoaster.  Evenings suck.  My job sucks.  My cat is hyper and pissing me off.  Man, do I need sleep.  And a vacation.  And a new job.    GodDAMN it.  Life is not bad.  Then why can I, like the media, only focus on the negatives?

       In search of an outlet   Tomorrow is Friday.  The weekend is here.  And nothing's really different.  I have a festival to attend this weekend for a couple of my students, which will take up Friday until 9pm and Saturday morning and afternoon until dinnertime.  Church on Sunday morning will follow.  Then Monday comes around again.  Things don't change.  The routine is dragging.  Or do they?  Someone said that the unexamined life is not worth living.  If that's true, then mine is worth a small fortune, with all the thinking I do.  I sure do have plenty of time here to do it.  I'm feeling a bit like I should kick my own ass right about now.  I can't seem to be happy with my living situation no matter what it is.  Lauren and I weren't getting along, so I wanted to live alone.  And now living alone is... well, it's not what I thought it would be.  Surely Lauren and I getting space was the best thing for the both of us.  I think I can understand at least a part of why she felt smothered - I really do feel unplugged here.  Unplugged from my friends, from my music, and from my past.  That must have manifested itself in much the same way it does now.    I'm thinking about getting a roommate, which is very dependent on where I work next year.  Dan Jeanette wants to move into an apartment here in the mills in Manchester, which would work if I stayed in the area.  Tony wants me to move in with him, which would be great if my job moved west a bit.  Then again, there's the ubiquitous DOOR #3, much like Pandora's Box with all of the unknowns it contains.  Who knows?  Time will tell on that one.  I need to plug back in with a vengeance.  And soon.  Because I am sick of my own mood swings.  And spring is coming fast.  And life is just too damn short to sulk.

       Twenty Thousand Hearts (Eddie From Ohio)   First we lived in India In winter it rains there everyday We were younger then We were children in India There were signs and people Wed never understand You said Hold my hand And I held your hand  There is one of me And one of you Two of us And one hundred questions And two thousand reasons But tens a perfect number We are twenty thousand hearts full of hunger Twenty thousand hearts  Then were dancing in Geneva Its New Years Eve And all the Americans were there They said, Its still last year in New York City. You said, New York, where? I said, New York City, its three thousand miles away. You said, Whats a mile? I said, Its far away.  There is one of me And one of you Two of us And one hundred questions And two thousand reasons But tens a perfect number We are twenty thousand hearts full of hunger Twenty thousand hearts  Now you ask me to explain myself And I tell you I need distance You say, To hell with distance, remember who youre talking to. I say, Closeness is too much for me. And dismiss you with a smile You say, Wish away your closeness, and imagine its a mile.  There is one of me And one of you Two of us And one hundred questions And two thousand reasons But tens a perfect number We are twenty thousand hearts full of hunger Twenty thousand hearts Twenty thousand hearts full of hunger Twenty thousand hearts

           I'm sitting at home trying to be inspired by something.  Anything.  My day was fine - dressed up as the Cat in the Hat, and had a ball doing it.  And so what?  Why am I like this right now?  I don't enjoy being here by myself.  Loki is great, but does not compensate for real people.  I am thinking that some open mics may be in my near future.  Or something - anything.  I want to be passionate about something again.  Something real.  Something true.  And the Vernon Chorale rehearsal I'm supposed to be at tonight isn't doing it.  And I don't know why.    This is ridiculous.  I need to do something crazy and break out of this shell.

       What the fuck?   I really don't hate my job.  Not most of it, anyway.  Even the middle school kids aren't the problem.  Sometimes they're fun.  In fact, they're often fun.    But I've said this before: I have no use for students who just don't give a shit about anything.  I don't care about motivating them, I'd rather have them just get out of the way so that the kids who DO care can have every opportunity to do their absolute best.  I want to help any child succeed who wants to.    Public schools suck.  Maybe we should just drown the rest of the kids.  The ones who are apathetic about everything, the ones we try to motivate, to inspire to do their best. It would save us all a whole lot of trouble.  Would solve the overpopulation problem, too.  Did I just suggest that?  I must be one sick bastard.  I don't think I meant it.    But I can dream.  Missing friends and the like.  Living alone has its downfalls.  Leila seems to love it.  I'm not so sure.

       Freewrites   Here below, in no particular order, are some freewrites I've done lately that I feel like sharing.  Happy reading.  T.S. Eliot.  brilliant man, phenomenal poet. He makes me want to be smarter So I can understand What he has to say. I hope that by Glimpsing inside his soul Through his words, I might better understand My own -- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;both my soul &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my words. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Everything comes around again. Anyone who says "You pass this way but once"  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is missing half the point. Sure, you experience things once... live once...  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but our lives aren't linear -- they spiral. Two steps forward, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one step back As we circle back on what we have been We gain perspective into how to be the person We most want to be. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - "Simple" just doesn't seem to be good enough for our world.  I wonder if it ever was. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  And my personal favorite: a note I wrote to myself back in February.  I might have published this before, but some things bear repeating.   Keep traveling and seeking adventures.  Climb mountains.  Go new places and find fresh aspects of old favorites.  Live.  Breathe.  Discover.  Love life.  Marvel at beauty.  If you find yourself getting stuck in a rut, change it: a new approach, a new path, new people or surroundings, but change something -- anything! -- or you risk everything you have come to live for.  Don't whine -- change your reality.  You are never without choice.

       Rain?   Not looking forward to today.  We had beautiful weather almost all of last week, which contributed greatly to my good mood.  And now it's back to crap with crap weather while God pisses on us again.  God, I'm getting tired of being pissed on.  Could you just hold it for a while?

       The final stretch   NOT looking forward to going back to work tomorrow. for the final push to summer vacation.  But away I will trot, ready to inspire some more munchkins, all the while pretending that I am fulfilling my every dream by doing so.  Were it only so.  Seeing happy people or helping people fix relationships make me think.  Maybe too much.  I think back to good times and different people and places and wonder why things never worked out.  I only seem to remember the good things and far less of the bad.  Is that a bad thing?  I don't know.  It's nice to be able to share ideas and things that worked for me with my friends and see their relationships blossom.  I just wish I could get it right myself for once.  I am being undeniably cryptic here today.  I realize this.  But hey -- this is my blog and I get to do what I want here.  Sometimes I just don't feel like putting it out there.  This is one of those nights.  The walls have ears, and some things should remain silent.  Maybe if you ask me and I'm in the right mood, I will talk.  But until then, I lurk.  Sleep loose, all.  Ehren out.  Tomorrow's gonna be a long one.

       Just had the oddest dream   I was home, apparently, in Manchester, NH, giving a clinic I had no information about.  After a bit, it turned out to be a marching band clinic.  And I was a trumpeter.  Or I was supposed to be -- my chops had not improved from real life.  The trouble was that I had no idea what I was supposed to teach these people.  All three high school bands were there, plus a US Army band.  Man, I think I'm glad I woke up before anything bad happened.  Still, it was cool getting introduced back home as someone to listen to, someone who had something to say.  Too bad I had no clue what I was doing.  I wonder what it meant?  It was a fun dream.  I haven't had one in a while, period, and it's been even longer since I had one that I wanted to stay in bed to continue... one that was THAT vivid.  How cool.  Time to pack.  Going home to Manchester in 1 hour.

       Thinkin'   Philosophizing about tons of stuff.  Life is good.  Vacation is much needed, though I am not sure my view has changed on what I'm taking the vacation  from .  But regardless... I guess I'll be more charged up for the final push to June.    I'm trying my damndest to take charge of my life.  I've been whining too long... even I have been getting annoyed by it.  It's been a shit of a year, and it's time I do something about it to make sure I don't let it happen again.  Bagley seems to want me to stay where I am.  I wish he could see inside my head, because I don't feel like he really knows what's going on there.  Although...  I value his opinion so much that it still makes me reconsider leaving.  This week has been great so far.  Yesterday I started writing my first song ever on the guitar.  I'm psyched.  The lyrics actually don't suck for once, and it's going well.  I don't know where my inspiration has come from, but I'm going with it.  Been hanging out with friends a LOT lately, which is awesome.  I miss them a lot.  Dan and I checked out apartments again today, reinforcing why I'm stoked to move in with him.  I think that's going to work out really well.  I think I have been drunk almost every night this week.  I love vacation.  I think it should happen more often.  Like all the time.  No, really.  I think I will start my own country based on that.  It will be called Vacationland.  Wait, that's Maine.  Well, back to the drawing board.  Ehren out.

       Found this on Bootsnall.com... worth a read   WAG THE WORLD  3rd Night News 4th issue  You are being seduced people. We are all being actively seduced. Much like in a movie or a play when you dont know how it is going to turn out, Youre being seduced into paying attention to what is on the stage and nothing else. What was going on with the camera men, director and producers, back stage, you never even guessed. Your curiosity had you by the frontal lobes people. You were seduced. For entertainment value that is fine but what is going on now, is for our very lives. I am fairly certain that you are familiar with the term Wag the Dog. What is going on right now, right in our faces is Wag the World. Take this election coming up for example. The polls (conducted and paid for by who knows who?) say that this race is neck and neck. Too close to call, a cliff hanger and most of the public does not know how this is going to turn out. This is seductive isnt it? Curiosity asks, Who will win? Will it be Skull and Bones Bush, or Skull and Bones Kerry? With all voting machines owned by republicans and with no paper trail, I guess it would pretty much be a toss up of who comes out on top. So why do the drama?  The only reason is to deeply involve the public in a partisan conflict whos out come has no more effect than an NFL, NBA, NHL, Baseball game or NASCAR race. You understand that all those leagues are businesses dedicated to enlisting your allegiance and emotion so that you will pay attention and your dollar$ to see how it comes out. Right? And what difference does that out come produce? Unless you had Bet the farm on the game or on the season not all that much, huh? Sure was exiting though wasnt it? A close game or a close race makes people pay attention and gets us even more involved. Get out there and vote people! Be proud to participate in this great democracy where Every Vote Counts! (As long as it is for whom we, the powers that BE appointed as our stooges.) I wonder how come the New England Patriots football team has been in every Superbowl since September 11th 2001? How do you hide a conspiracy? Make it so big that no one can imagine it. Does 9/11ring a bell for anyone?  What good is having all the POWER if you dont go ahead and use it? And if you already have all of the money and natural resources of the planet what would you be hungry for? Yes the powers that be, the international corporations, insurance companies and banks do own everything including the air that you are breathing. So what do They want? They want the only stuff that you have ever really had, Your Time and Attention. All of your supposed possessions or your varied relationships you only have for a Time and then only as long as you are paying Attention to them and that includes your body. Your total Time and Attention is what They want and They are doing a bang up job of getting what They want arent they?  What is going on here are actions to divide the people to the maximum degree, by small degrees at a time, as in a seduction. You know this people, if you rush too fast in a seduction it will have to be aborted or it becomes a rape. Now rape is resisted and in the past many leaders were caught, taken out and murdered for the rape of the people and the national treasuries. In this case the treasuries are already secured so the reach is for the absolute enslavement of your Time and attention, your emotions and your passion. Really, stinkin sneaky isnt it?   Slowly at first, around 1755 or so, Power started its creepy plan. Ever since, stage by stage, there have been more and more issues brought out to shock the public to cause them to rise in outrage and to divide the public while unifying power.  Divide and Conquer, divide to the MAX for total victory. All of this is being done very methodically. Each step is taken to the degree that you the public can understand the reasoning whether you agree with the action or not you certainly can understand why they would propose such actions. If they were to do too radical a departure, the seduction would be over and the public would revolt too early, so they have to build this slowly. They have to raise your emotions and passions slowly by degree, either for or against something. What is coming you see, when you care enough, when your emotions of anger or fear have been evoked strongly enough, when your passions have been whipped into frenzy, when you are willing to kill for your beliefs, They (Republican and or Democrat corporate media puppets) will have finished their job and can kick back and enjoy the fruits of ruling a slave population on planet earth. What a Party! Can you imagine all the Power!?? They can.   I have an admission to make. For the last 15 years or so I have been a news addict. I have watched, read and or listened to all of the shit that has rolled down hill and have built some big ass calluses. Believe me you need em to sit through it all. I understand why you would not want to. Some body had to do it. Through it all there has appeared a definite pattern that is designed to slowly turn up the outrage factor. Like a toad is a warm bucket of water, we are sitting there as the heat rises to boiling and all the toadies get cooked.  Those of you who are reading this and the earlier 3rd Night News have a very special advantage. We know how all of this eventually turns out Ethics over Power and a smoother ride from the 4th Day (2005) onward. What this means is that we do not have to become seduced by the drama. Have your ever watched a movie like 4 or 5 times? What happened to the dramatic effect? It went limp didnt it?  You did get to see a lot more of went into the movie as you watched it over and over though didnt you? Like camera angles, lighting, costume details and innuendos sprinkled all over for you to discover. This is because you now know how it turns out So now with the Mayan calendar cycles we can see when and how, this is all going to turn out and the big production drama being put on for us has very little effect. In fact the performance sort of looks clownish and frankly there are some very poor actors in bit parts out there.   But the big show of the 2004 election is going to make WWWF look like the Amateur Hour. This will end up being actually physically bloody politics towards the end. Along the way the general public will be leaked the information (by various whistle blowers) that George Bush and Cheney did do 9/11. This will be used as a Kerry, last ditch campaign ploy to get out the votes against Bush. It makes sense that if they were really desperate that they would do that right? Thats very important, because this all has to be done in degrees. It has to feel natural not too sudden or the seduction is aborted. They are right now working it, enflaming every cultural, economic, religious or ethnic conflict that they can find!  They busy are turning up the heat and off the lights!  All of this is being done by the way, on the part of consciousness that it is really running this show on a very particular schedule. (The Galactic Cycle is all about discernment.) This schedule is a repeating cycle that ascends in a spiral path described by the Mayan calendar. What we know of what will probably occur in our near future, is from the past, and from historical records of what consciousness has gone through during the same energies in previous cycles.  We also know that the best two men for the job of Pres and Vise Pres are the only two Democrats that got totally ignored so far. (If you dont know who I am talking about, the media blackout worked on you) So we have Scull and Bones Kerry as the corporate appointed Democrat nominee and these two other guys who are running on the Consciousness/light & laughter platform. The latter platform is to be the dominating consciousness base of 2005 or the 4th Day, on the Mayan calendar.   How does someone get picked to be a presidential candidate? Who would the power elite be able to trust concerning the 100s of trillions of dollars that they control world wide? Not just anybody thats for sure. And not anyone who stands up for the citizens, they might spend some of that money on the people! Oh my God No! So what is the process? It starts in school, some law school or Ivy League special club type institution. It starts with an invitation offered because of your lineage, because of your connections and desire to become powerful. Favors are offered as a reward for joining these even more special clubs and secret societies. To begin with the favors involve grades, drugs, alcohol and sex. All the memberships begin with a ceremony or initiation that binds the person to secrecy. How do you do that for sure? By photographing the new member doing things sexually that would instantly ruin their lives if it was ever revealed.  Now you are in and not ever going to tell anything about the workings of the group. Later, when a member is approached by the club for a return favor, that member had better perform or he will not progress up the power ladder. These favors start small and only slightly illegal but are rewarded with lavish gifts of sex, money connections and prestige. The next favors are more involved as a test of the members resourcefulness and the strength of desire to gain money, power, and sexual escapades. Rewards of these favors lead into the area of witnessing ceremonies of taboo and torturous sex. (Regular sex orgies having lost their kick by now on the up and coming member.) Once a member desires public office or a ready made business success these rituals become a mandatory attendance. (All on film of course.) Once in the office or head of the corporation the member will be expected to personally perform the ritual torture and or killing of the victim(s). After the member has demonstrated his or her willingness to personally torture and murder on command he or she rises to the, not so short list, of leadership potential. How would you make sure that someone was willing to kill 10s of thousands or millions of persons for the sole benefit of your powerful friends? Through duly witnessed and photographed demonstrations of their total lack of regard for human suffering or loss of life. Now the member has become someone nominatable for Pres. or Prime minister of what ever country they happen to be lurking in. Dont think so? Cant happen here?  Where do 150,000 + kids disappear to each year in this country alone? And you thought it was only pretty little white girls advertised on TV that go missing? Check out what is happening in the Belgium courts right now over the pedophile sex ring charges and the numbers of suicides among government leaders and policemen all across Europe.  Have you heard of the Amber Alert Bill? Do you know how and why and what that bill does? Do you know why it was rushed through to be signed with rider bills attached? Now there is a system to alert everyone on the road of any vehicles make, color and license plate # in which everyone believes there is a stolen kid. No matter why the police want this car and driver, everyone thinks that it is a kidnapping. Welcome to the US Public Police Force, you are now deputized with the blessings of the state.  Night Clubs in your area shutting down? As a rider to the Amber Alert bill there is a law that any club owner or venue renter, be it he or she, is guilty of the possession of all the controlled substances found in the possession of patrons at their club or venue. This will stop people from gathering at any place other than Christian revival meetings, football games, stockcar races or any other corporate endorsed events. No drug checks there huh?   So, hows it going to go from how bad it is now, to how it should be in 2005? VERY QUICKLY is the answer to that question. Very quickly indeed. The storm will rise. The storm will rage and the storm will pass leaving a cleaner environment for renewed growth. During each 4th Day the newest consciousness in this case, ETHICS overcomes the previous consciousness, POWER and new foundations are laid for the new consciousness to develop along its evolutionary path toward the next evolutionary jump. The next jump being the consciousness of Conscious Co-Creation. As you are already seeing in your lives today, there are more and more synchronicities, and random telepathic experiences happening. We are stepping into our roles of Being creators right now. And in fact creating your own survival during the coming changes will be only way to survive. This is an evolution after all. Evolution is a fabulously effective tool. Look how far weve come from cellular ooze in just 820 million years. But Evolution has no mercy. This does have to be tough on a Creator, just on victims. Got it?  We know how it comes out, with light, love and laughter prevailing.  In service, Ian Xel Lungold

       Almost... there...   Well, for better or for worse, I've almost made it through this week.  Tomorrow is just the last sprint before that wonderful week most people call April Vacation.  I don't think I could have made it much longer.  I can tell you this: one of the main things that kept me from seriously considering dropping my job as soon as possible is the fact that if I don't, I will get paychecks through the summer.  And believe you me, I have fucking  earned  those paychecks.  Sheesh.  Went to Tony's tonight in New Britain.  I didn't want to go at first because I was in a crappy mood -- again -- but Tony is persistent, and managed to convince me with food to come visit.  Man, am I glad I did.  I brought Loki and he had his "first" experience outside... quotes because he WAS a barn cat for the first 4 months of his life.  But he sure hasn't been outside for a while now, and he was freaking out, trying to scramble back into the same carrier I had to almost force him into to get there.  Cats.  Heading to bed soon.  Jamming with Liz tomorrow night.  I need a vacation.  Oh wait, I've got one.  Piping hot and ready to eat.  Or something like that.  How does one eat a vacation?

       Why I don't want to be a teacher   I was going to save this tirade for another time, but it needs out.  So here goes.    Our educational "system".  It's this noble thing, education.  Priming the young minds of today so they can become the leaders of tomorrow.  Work hard, be a good person, and life will hand you bliss on a silver platter.  It just ain't so.  To get to the core of the problem, we need to go back to why public schools -- or compulsory education, for that matter -- began in the first place.  It all goes back to child labor laws.  Until 1938, children could pretty much work any job they wanted, for as many hours as they wanted.  And they did.  Large families were in vogue.  More children meant more laborers, which equaled more money for the family and -- usually -- more food on the table.  Nobody gave this a second thought.  School was something for the rich upper class, and everyone else when they could fit it in between work.    Enter the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938.  Suddenly, there was a societal push to "protect" our children.  And yes, this was a new concept.  Until then, the concept of childhood as we know it simply did not exist.  Children were not coddled or protected, they were introduced into the world quite early and expected to adapt.  Life was hard.  Someone, somewhere decided this simply could not do, and that our youth needed to not be exposed to these (admittedly) severely harsh conditions of factory work and the like, as well as working the long weeks that had been common.  Children everywhere were probably grateful.  Working conditions were pretty bad, and to get out of them must have seemed like a great idea.  This raised, however, the pressing question of what to do with all these recently liberated youth --  who were now roaming the streets and getting into all sorts of mischief, as idle children are wont to do.    Somebody came up with the idea of creating schools, great centers of learning, where the children would be taught.  "Yes, that's it!" they must have said.  The idea was embraced.  Unfortunately, most humans suffer from a lack of vision and truly original thought.  This being the Industrial Revolution, the schools were modeled after the only system most people knew: the factory.  And thus schools were damned before they even started.   What do we teach our students?  Some say languages and sciences, others would say arts and philosophy.  The sad truth is that these disciplines -- and I use that word purposefully,  disciplines  -- are little more than vehicles to teach our children the one true task: to conform.  Oh, we make it look good.  Most of us even manage to believe otherwise.   "Oh, my schools weren't like  that ," you say.  "We were encouraged to think freely and be our own person."    Really?  Remember elementary school?  Those early formative years?  What happened to you when you got out of line because you wanted to?  What happened when you just had to share the latest gossip during a math lesson?  Or consider this: when did you plan your own day at school?  Did you ever get to decide what you would do?  I mean, really decide, not just decide given a certain set of choices.  The choiceless choice is the teacher's best weapon against student unrest.  "Look," they say.  "You can choose what you're going to do." Bullshit.  They've already decided for you.  They created the choices, and whatever you pick will still fit into their agenda.  It's all about control.    Perhaps you've heard it under a different name: citizenship.  To be a good citizen...  now that's certainly something I remember learning about in school.  Remember the Pledge of Allegiance?  Do you remember reciting it every day in school with everyone else in eerie unison without questioning why?  Did you ever have a Jehovah's Witness in your classroom who remained sitting during the Pledge?  Did you think he/she was different because they didn't conform?  Why are you not saying the Pledge?  How could you NOT pledge allegiance to the flag or the President or Allah or whoever?  Children are taught to follow directions and not speak out of turn.  Creative divergent thinkers, or disruptive students as teachers call them, are squashed as quickly as possible.  These are ideal traits for factory workers, who perform mundane tasks every day without question or thought.  They are not ideal for today's world.  Can you imagine a world with leaders who are truly divergent thinkers?  People who weren't afraid to try something radically different?  People who could see the bigger picture?  Maybe someone who could actually see that war begets more war and nothing else.  But I am forgetting that our children are created by the system.  A system with centuries of history that is bent on perpetuating itself.  Creating original, divergent thinkers would be counterproductive to the goal.  And so we are stuck in a cyclical paradox, unable to extricate ourselves from the loop.  I don't know how much longer I can rail against this bullshit.  Being part of this system makes me sick.  It's like the Borg.  The best I can figure is that I will either give in and become assimilated or become an El-Aurian of sorts who resists successfully but who is forever outside the world that most people know.  Open your eyes, people.  I don't care if you think it's bad or good.  But I don't think you can shoot a hole in my logic about the reality I'm describing.  If you can, please do -- I could use a better outlook.

       When it rains, it pours...   ...literally and figuratively.  This rain has got to stop.    But that's not what I'm writing about.  I just found out that my church is having a budget crunch (surprise!), and that my job as the director of the bell choir is in jeopardy.  Most likely, it's going to be cut.  And with it, there goes my solid financial base for next year.    So it's back to the planning stages.  Maybe I should vote Communist in November.  Yeah, that's it.

       Quick thoughts   A few quick thoughts before I fall into bed:  VC tonight was amazing.  My stint of being in charge until June has begun, and it is going better than I ever imagined.  This is what I need to do.  I could go on forever on that, but I think that's enough for now.  Hence, I am realizing that I could be a great teacher in the public schools.  I have it in me.  But I'm not sure I really want to do that.  I don't want to learn how to be a more effective beat-downer of students so they will conform and listen and do what I want.  Somebody's got to do it, I guess.  But I shouldn't be the one to do it, because I resent them every day for it, at least the ones who cause the problem.  Some of them are amazing people.  The rest need to leave.    You know how college isn't for everyone?  Most people understand that.  Maybe all of public school should be the same way.  If you don't want to be there, fine.  Then leave.  And get the hell out of the way for the rest of us who want to learn what we're learning.    So many problems with today's schools.  And I don't want to help fix them.  I want out.  Well, time for bed.  I'm committed until June.  May as well continue making a difference to the few who care.  They deserve my best.  I just wish they (and I) could actually LEARN.  Man, the things we could do.    Night all.  Leave love.

       From Ulysses   I need to use this somewhere:   if only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds and it were necessary only to seperate them from the rest of us and destroy them.  But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.

       Love and other forgotten promises(?)   Had a great night here in Manchester.  An impromptu party sprung up, thanks to Lauren and her inviting everyone she knew.  It was nice having her here, and a bit surreal... I think this is the first time she's hung out here since she moved out.  Her and I have so many bonds, and at the same time so much pent-up frustration, that it makes for an interesting relationship.  I think that both of us want to make things work between us, but old crap just gets in the way sometimes.  In the same way, though, we have some great times still, where both of us understand each other.    Things didn't go well between us, I suppose.  Seems a shame sometimes, with the good times we shared and the ones that we still share.  The world is funny like that.  Everything happens for a reason, but I haven't yet figured out why the cosmos jinxed us.   I don't have all the answers, but I do know that it's really good to have her back in my life, even if it's a little odd sometimes.  Intriguing.   "I beg youto have patience with everything unresolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves as if they were locked rooms or books written in a very foreign language. Dont search for the answers, which could not be given you now, because you would not be able to live them. And the point is, to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps then, someday far in the future, you will gradually, without ever noticing it, live your way into the answer" - Rainer Maria Rilke   Lauren, if you're reading this -- as messed up as our relationship has been, I wouldn't trade it for anything.  We both hurt each other, and for some reason keep coming back for more... and I know it's not a moth to a flame sort of thing.  In whatever form this... this  thing  takes with us, I know that though I will be careful and guarded at times, I will still be open to making many more great memories.  Keep on kicking... we've been to hell and back now, and are still talking.  I'm proud to call you my friend.

       Monday - again?   I'm thinking that being a full-time substitute teacher next year might be a decent idea.  I'm not sure I can deal with much more of this middle school garbage.  Had an okay rehearsal today with my 5th and 6th graders, but they are making me hate choir.  And I love it.  I don't think I can deal with anyone who makes me hate something I love so much.  I got home today all rared up to analyze scores for my Vernon Chorale concert coming up -- we start rehearsals next week -- and I couldn't bring myself to do it.  Those kids just zapped my spark.  And I want it back.  Then again, it's been a pretty decent afternoon relaxing here at home.  I left school before 3 for the first time in months.  It was sunny today and didn't snow as predicted, though it was DAMN cold.  And the sun just set ten minutes ago, at 7:30.  I can deal with that.  I am feeling my power over my own destiny.  The throttle is idling.  Now where to drive this puppy?

I have lots of words to describe it... some in my journal, others in my head... but it's going to take a bit to get it all down.  For now -- here are some pictures to keep you going.

      Finally figured out some plans for the rest of the weekend.  Leila and I are heading to Block Island.  Last time we tried this we didn't actually have enough time to pull it off, but this time it looks like we're all set.  Wish the weather was supposed to be warmer, but I'll deal.  If I was looking for tropical weather I guess I wouldn't go to Rhode Island!  Can't wait to drive a moped again.  I wonder how much they charge?  Tonight: Off to see Liz Reed and Marc Douglas Berardo play at the Vanilla Bean.  Plus I get to see Tom -- who I haven't seen in almost a month.  Cheers all around!

      I made it.  Memorial Day Weekend.  There are three weeks left of school, and only one is a full 5-day week. That makes for 13.5 days until I am done with the kids.  Man, am I stoked.  But for now, I have three days of time to fill with anything I want.  The weather is beautiful, the sun is shining, and all is well.  I spent last night in Willimantic for one last evening at Dan and Clayton's house.  Far mellower than most nights I've had there, it was exactly what I needed: an evening of friends, fun, good conversation, bad jokes, beer, food... you know what I mean.  Went to bed around 1am and woke up at 11:30 to Clayton's mom banging on the front door.    Still trying to figure out what to do today.  Heading to the movies tonight to watch the world get destroyed in "The Day After Tomorrow".  Have a good weekend, all.  Give a ring if you want me.

So while you often seem worthless, without you, everything would just not work.

      Chalk another one up to Ehren needing to focus more on real-life issues.  I learned the following today.  Don't go the gym and then skip dinner.  And if you do, don't run a choir rehearsal afterward.  And if you do that, you should really eat when you get home.  That's right, kiddies.  I did it all.  And I am feeling tired and stupid and cranky and I have a headache.  All because I was a moron.  Sigh.  Bed.

      It's been a good weekend.  This morning was spent singing "You Raise Me Up" at church a la Josh Groban, except he's rich and I can sing better.  No, really.  I kicked ass.  I don't say that easily.  Susan was in tears and came over to give me a hug afterward.  An aside: isn't it irritating how Christians usurp culture toward their own ends?  I guarantee that "You Raise Me Up" was not written as an epistle to God, but rather as a love song.  And yet it's so easily turned.  They're good at stuff like that.  I wish they would just leave other peoples' culture alone and stop bastardizing what isn't theirs.  Okay, done.  My parents came down to hear me sing this morning, then took Dan and I out to Rein's for lunch.  Afterward, Dan and I came back here and I slept for two hours.  Ali came over and dinner ensued at Boston Market - 20 bucks for a 3 person meal.  Food from the gods.  Then we caught a showing of "Troy" and watched Brad Pitt kick some serious ass with his jump/twist/stab-you-in-the-neck move.  He had some serious badass tricks built into his character, almost enough to give Legolas a run for his money.  Almost.  You just can't beat an elf.  Too bad that Orlando Bloom played a pansy like Paris in this movie.  Although he did manage to almost make him likeable...  I tried to change my blog template today too.  But I couldn't find anything that I liked as well as this one.  They all look pretty cool but they're not me.  I think I'll stick with this one for now.  I am very relaxed right now.  Mellowness is coursing through my body -- whatever that means.  I'm somewhere between the first and second wind, and so I will be falling asleep soon before that second one hits.  And I will snooze delightfully all night until the evil buzzer rouses me from my slumber.

      Wednesdays suck.  And I made it, again.  They're such long days... a full day of school, then select chorus from 3:30-5, then church from 6:30-9:30... now here to attempt a blog post while Loki tries his damndest to get my attention.  His problem is that he can't toss me if I annoy him.    Heeheehee...  Well, one of us has to be the alpha male in this relationship.  And it is sure as fuck not going to be my cat.  I love him and he knows that.  But life here is on my terms, not the terms of a 7 month old cat.    I have so much to be thankful for.  That this is my largest problem right now?  I just received a letter from the UConn Graduate School saying that my application had been received and sent to the School of Music.  Doesn't tell me much, but it's nice to get an official letter, even if it is only a form.  I'm waiting for the final paperwork before I celebrate.  I wonder when that will be?

      The past week of partying nonstop is catching up with me.  Dan and I checked out the Ribbon Mill after school, which pretty much was less apartment for more money.  I don't think so.  Ali and Lauren came over after Dan and I got back and Dan cooked up some terriyaki fajitas.  Very tasty.  But I'm still tired.  I conked out for two hours while a movie was on from 7-9, and I need more.  These late nights have caught up with me, I think.  But damn, has it been fun.    Loki is tearing around the house, batting everything around.  I just want some peace and quiet.  Maybe he'll get tired eventually and stop.  I hope so.  He's getting my nerves tonight.  If I didn't love that cat so much I would kick his ass...  An aside: is the font in this blog too small?  Leave a comment and let me know if it is or not.  Thanks!

      It is Sunday.  I have had one hell of an amazing week.    And I feel like I can take on the world.    I have the most amazing friends anyone could ask for.  I feel fulfilled in so many ways.  I feel like I am finally getting taken seriously in ways that I care about.  I'm getting out of the public schools.  Only 23 school days left until I leave on my road trip.  Yeah... things are good.  I went to the beach yesterday in Madison with Dan, Ali, Lauren, and Meaghan.  It was a wonderfully relaxing day in the sun, walking the beach, and shopping at the Clinton outlets for cheap stuff.  I wrote in my journal a bit, something I'm trying to get back into doing more... it helps me think things out to see the thoughts on paper, makes them real somehow.  Dan and I are hoping to sign our lease on Tuesday for our new apartment that we're moving into in late July when we get back from the road trip.    I just feel like my life is moving forward in a positive direction -- something I haven't felt in a long time.  Possibly since I left college.  I learned a lot this year, sure.  And I wouldn't be the same person right now had I not had those experiences.  But man, did a lot of them suck.  I will not make those mistakes again if I can possibly help it.  New mistakes all the way for Ehren C. Brown, that's my plan.  My frozen pizza from XtraMart is almost done, and people are coming over soon for a listening party.  My apartment has become a new Mecca.  And I love it.  I have missed seeing my friends so often this year.  I am glad that situation seems to be drawing to a close.  For now, I am centered.  I am me.  I am okay with myself, okay with being single, okay with where my life is and where it's going.  And for once, I didn't have to run off to Acadia or the mountains of New Hampshire or Vermont to find myself.  I was here all along.  It's a nice feeling.  As always, I'm still  Ehren

      I can't believe it.  My head is still spinning.  Vernon Chorale last night rocked.  I was on, they were on, we accomplished a LOT.  And Dr. Bagley showed up to see it.  I later found out why he was there.  It was my audition.  For UConn.  Without my knowledge.  And I'm in.  Dr. Bagley asked me to be his next master's candidate in choral conducting for Fall 2004.    I accepted.  Now I just need to get my application in tomorrow.  Isn't that messed up?  I got accepted, then I found out I was in the running, now I have to apply.  Life is funny like that.  So all my wondering and philosophizing hasn't been for naught.  I am going to get to chase my dreams, and prevent myself from burning out at the hands of the public schools.  If I never teach in them again after June 18th, I think I might be okay with that.  And B.E.S.T. can bite me.  Is this really happening?  Somebody pinch me.  ...ouch...  I have SO much work ahead of me.  And I can't wait to start.

      It's early May and it's 88 degrees outside.  Man, was today a great day for the beach.    Right now I'm in the process of cooking dinner before we take off for VC rehearsal.  ("We" being myself, Clayton, Dan, and Bea.)  Took a mental health day today, and relaxed in the sun trying to refocus on stuff.  I have started leaning toward returning to my current district next year because they've offered me the high school chorus position.  Of course, this is all tentative until the budget passes, but assuming things are going as well as I think they are, there shouldn't be much of a problem securing the job.  I can't believe that the year is almost over.  As much hell as it's been, I look back on the year and it seems like it just... disappeared.  A year of my life, spent.. and not spent as well as I might have liked.  I'm very thankful that there have been many good points to counteract the bad ones, and even the ones that started bad have not all stayed so.  Such is the way of my life, and (I surmise) all things under the sun as well.    Life is lumpy, I read once.  Nothing is perfect, and if you think it should be so then you are being unrealistic.  Lumps are a pain in our backside, but we're still standing after them.  Often we are changed as a result, and this is a good thing as well -- we grow through our crap into something better and wiser.  Kind of like a phoenix, except without the whole fire thing.  I wish I could have more conversations with people about life and philosophy and why things are the way they are and what we understand and what we don't and so many other things.  But people don't seem to think that way every day... or at least don't talk about it if they do.  I analyze things - it's who I am.  Anyone out there want to bounce rhetoric around?  Look me up.    Back to dinner and more tangible things that need my immediate attention.  Ehren out.

       Saturday   It's Saturday.  I actually made it through the week.  Not that I am actually  that  surprised over this, I suppose.  I didn't expect to pass away or anything.  But the beginning of the week was so shitty that I just couldn't see past it to conceiving of anything else.  And here I am, gasping for breath like one who just finished the marathon.    I'm considering so many things for next year, and I don't have answers to most of them.  Somehow, this is okay with me now, because I'm on top of making things better.    Vague?  Yes.  But I'm okay with that... and plus, I don't have more specifics anyway.   The weather is beautiful today.  Summer is finally on the way.  I didn't think the cold weather and rain would ever leave this year.  Seems I needed it more than ever.  The days are finally here when the outdoors isn't so harsh and cold and barren.  I live for this time of year.  Would it become less special if I lived somewhere where it was like this all year round?  I can't imagine it.  Someday, I'll work it out.  One more year in Connecticut, then grad school... and the sky's the limit.    Choir banquet tonight with Lauren.  Who would have thought?  Life really does spiral back on itself.  Looking forward to a great time.  See you all there.

      I finally made it.  The last day of school.  Yesterday was the last day with the kids here, which basically amounted to nothing.  I sat around till 10am in the air-conditioned library doing grades, then sat through two assemblies in the hotter-than-balls gymnasium with hundreds of other smelly sweaty people.  Great fun.  Today is an "in-service" day with nothing scheduled for the majority of the teachers, which means that we're all just sitting around watching TV, talking, and generally wasting time.  It would be a blast if I didn't have stuff to do at home... but it can't be helped.  It's nice to be relaxed around here.  That hasn't happened in a long, long time.  There are still a few things to be moved out of my apartment, but not much at this point.  My friends have been amazing in helping with the move.  Huge thank yous go out to Dan, Tony, Mark, Ali, Anagha, Tom, Liz, Leila, and most of all my parents who behaved like saints (as usual) in driving from New Hampshire to move for a day and watch me conduct a concert.  I couldn't have done this without all of you.  Thank you to all.  Dan and I leave tonight on our road trip for New Orleans.  Three times attempted, twice failed, and this time I'm actually going.  It's going to be crazy, tiring, long, and an amazing experience that I cannot possibly comprehend yet.  Life is for living, not for gathering dust.  So I'm headed out across the country to see as much as I can, for the joy of the open road, but most of all to live my life to the fullest by grasping it by the husk and running away with it.  So much of this trip is unplanned, with cell phones and a road atlas to give assistance when necessary.  It's a completely new experience for me to travel this way -- without plans, that is -- and I am totally looking forward to it.  Dan and I are up to the adventures and the challenges thay lie ahead.    We've started a trip blog at  urlLink roundin30.blogspot.com .  Bookmark it, check it when you can.  We're planning on getting near Internet whenever possible to jot off some ruminations on the trip as we see it.  Pictures may also be included too.    That's all for now.  I'm going to wander through the school right now to talk with some of the faculty... for the last time!  Tomorrow, the open road.

      Feeling better - thanks to Anagha and Leila (and Tony, who helped even though he didn't even know there was a problem!)  Instant messenger is a wonderful thing.  I think bed is in order soon.  G'night all.  Sleep loose.

      Moving sucks.  This we all know.  But I routinely forget just how much it sucks.  I guess it's just an out of sight, out of mind sort of thing.  Or maybe a repressal of a traumatic memory?  I feel cranky, tired, hot, and stressed out.  Oh, and whiny too.  If I was watching myself I would either be annoyed or highly amused at my inability to handle this right now.  I have school every day this week and things going on every night.  And lots of shit to do on Thursday afternoon as well.  And I'm supposed to leave on Friday around 5:30.  I don't know if I'm going to make it.  School is stupid.  I'm stressed about things that don't matter.  Like how and when I'm going to set up the sound system for Thursday.  And how I'm going to finish grades.  Or if I'm going to bother.  Maybe they all just get A's.  There's going to be an amazing concert tomorrow night.  8pm at Immanuel Congregational Church in Hartford.  Connecticut Chamber Singers.  Be there or be out of the loop.  Great singers, great music, should just be a phenomenal evening of beautiful music.  But it's another thing to do in a week when I would rather have the time to get other things done.  I wish I had the time to enjoy it more.  I hate it when I get like this.  Usually I can pull myself out of anything.  But right now I would just love to curl up into a ball and wait for it all to go away.  Whatever "IT" is.    Would somebody stop the world, please?  I'd like to get off.

      I'm lying in "bed" right now about to fall asleep so I can start my last week of school.  "Bed" consists of a sleeping bag and pad on the floor due to all my furniture being in storage in Vernon.  My possessions are strewn about my floor everywhere, waiting to be boxed up and moved.  I have a rehearsal or concert every night this week.  It's going to be a long but amazing week.    I can't wait for Friday to come.  I just wish there weren't so much work to do before I get there.

      Spent today moving out all my furniture from my apartment.  Then conducted my debut conducting thing performance concert with the Vernon Chorale... amazing.  I am now tired and drunk.  Should probably not have driven home... two drinks only, but on an empty stomach and overtired... takes its toll.    Sleep calls from the floor of my apartment to me as I camp out with Dan and Ali.  Must sleep.  Night, all. EB

      A plea to all:  If you are available tomorrow morning (Saturday), please consider coming by my place to help me move out!  I am picking up the truck at 7am, and trying to push it out as soon as possible.  Whether you can come for a while or the duration, your help would be SO much appreciated.  I will compensate in food or beer.  And that's all the time I have for now.  I'll write more come Sunday when I have time to breathe.

      Today is great.  It's 73 degrees out.  My house is approaching clean.  I am more relaxed than an addict on Valium.  Summer vacation is almost here.  The end is in sight.  And already my brain is shifting out of work mode.  Man, did I earn it this year...  Ali and Dan came over last night.  We hung out here, then at Center Springs Park, then back here.  I'm glad I get along with them so well, considering the amount of time I'm going to be spending with them this year.     I fell asleep talking to myself last night.  It went something like this: "Cast off.  Paddle away from the shores you know in search of greater adventures in the seas that you don't."  And then a lot of variants of the same.  Reminds me of a Sam Clemens quote:   "Twenty years from now you'll be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbour. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover."  - Mark Twain/Samuel Clemens  I guess what I'm saying is that things are going well.  I use the word "zen" often.  I'm not sure I know what it means.  But who cares?  I use it to mean that place where all is well... where I'm grounded in who I am and where I'm from... where I'm comfortable in my own skin... where all is still - or active - or anything else, and I can roll with it, because I know myself, and I know that I can handle it.  The day is calling.  I will answer.  Call if you want to be part of the wonder.

      I am completely zenned out.  Today has been amazing -- and it's only noon!  We sang "The Creation" in church today.  It's a rock cantata from 1970 based on the text from Genesis.  The performance today was complete with piano, bass and drums and was just amazing.  It's 1970's gospel rock at its finest.  The interesting part is that, from a technical perspective, it wasn't perfect.  Not by a long shot.  There were holes, voices sticking out, stuff like that.  But we all came together for a whole that was more than the sum of its parts.  Twice, I almost lost it because I got chills and everything was just washing over me.  This music isn't classical.  Not by a long shot.  Several of my purist friends would shun it (and already have -- though without ever hearing it...) based on this fact alone.  I can understand their viewpoint.  There's a lot of music in this genre that is crap.  It's too bad that people oversimplify things and say "I don't like ________".  We miss out on so many gems that get overlooked because of the cheesy "Yay God" Christian pop music that people associate with the genre.  Music is music.  Beauty is just that.  And it can be found in the unlikeliest of places.  Places where all else is dark or ugly.  Or maybe we just perceive it so.  And the beauty is there, perhaps on the surface for all to see, maybe buried under layers of dust, maybe tucked in behind some things we don't like all that much.  This is as much a tirade to myself as it is to everyone else, I guess.  I wish I could just move above all the petty bullshit that drives the world and really,  really  see the beauty and good in all things.  Sometimes I get it right.    But as far as I'm concerned, sometimes isn't often enough.  Perfection is worth striving for, in this case as well as others.  I've got to believe in people.  If not, I might just lose faith in everything.  And that's a world I don't want to be a part of.

      Today is nice: no class until 10:06am.  Waking up gradually rocks.  Just found an awesome website called  urlLink World Hum .  I'm going to add it to my links when I get a chance, but until then, you should go check it out.  It has links to all sorts of sites on world travel.  Specifically, there is a weblog that pulls from sources all over the world -- news sites, personal blogs, the works.  Anyone who's into travel and finding out things about the world should run, not walk, to World Hum.    And now, off to other things.

      Hey guys -- I want to plan a weeklong camping trip the second week of August leading into Vermont Weekend.  We'd spend the first half of the week on the Maine coast in Acadia National Park, the second half of the week in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, then just drive a couple hours west to get to Montgomery and meet up with everyone else.  Come for part or all of the trip... but who's interested?  These are places that rival Vermont for natural beauty, and I think even Lauren (Vermont freak extraordinare) would agree with me.  Let me know if you want in and we can sketch things out.

      This week has been a drag.  Literally.  I have been struggling to get out of my own way this week.  I'm sure that it was started off by getting insufficient sleep in the beginning of the week on Monday and Tuesday nights.  But it seems to be more than that.  I think it's a nasty combination of insufficient sleep, mold growing in the carpet in my classroom, and me not eating as frequently as I should.    But is that really it?  I've been doing that all year.  But this week when I leave school I just feel like crap, like passing out, like nasty allergies... what gives?  I've tried to blog this week several times and just given up in the middle because I couldn't focus on making any kind of point.  Much worse than normal.  Wish I could figure it out.  But -- on the flip side -- there are nine and one-half days left of school.  Single digits, baby.  I can put up with just about anything for that long.  Chorus has turned into a waiting game for me... I put on a video and wait for the end of the period.  I am so checked out mentally from that class now.    I can't believe I leave on my road trip in 16 days!  Dan and I are stoked to get this thing started.  First stop is New Orleans, then we shoot west.  I can't wait.  We're going to try and post from the road if we can.  I'm told that I can bring my laptop into any Kinko's and get free Internet access.  I'm about to find out if that is correct... but if it is, then we are fricking SET.    Anyone with a Verizon phone having issues with digital service tonight?  Mine is completely gone, leaving me only with analog, which sucks balls.  I hope it's not my phone.  Let me know if yours are working or not.  Getting that glazed and stupid feeling again.  Damn this week.  Later on, all.

       And still it rains. Water falls on water. For forty days, No sun, no moon.  It seems like it's been raining for weeks.    Until today, the rains have dampened my spirit as surely as my skin.  But today I found a window back to a place I used to visit... a place where rain can be relaxing and even comforting.  Maybe it's summer approaching, with the relaxation and freedom it brings.  Maybe it's the warmer rains that come with the change in the seasons.  Whatever the reason, the rain tonight was relaxing.  I walked out of church at into a dark drizzle when it had been sunny and clear a few hours earlier.  My immediate reaction was "Come  on  now, I'm so sick of the rain!"  But as I dampened on the walk to my car, I found myself relaxing... accepting... almost enjoying the wetness as it hit my skin.  There's something equalizing about getting wet by the rain, as though it brings a sense of solidarity to all who are touched by it.  Nobody can escape it or buy their way dry.  If you are out, you get wet.  Period.    Being able to hole up somewhere during a big storm is very cozy, just as wandering in a downpour is freeing to the soul.  I would do well to remember that side of rain, instead of considering only how the rains mean that there is no sun.    The sun will be back.  In the meantime, I still have much to learn from the water.

      Another day down, one day closer to the end of the year and the beginning of a month on the roads of America.  Unfortunately, every day down is also another day closer to moving out of my place in Manchester... something I am definitely not looking forward to.  I've felt like crap for the past two days upon departure from school.  I chalk it up to a nasty combination of lack of sleep, poor eating schedule, and carpet mold in my classroom.  Fortunately, after a salad and some chicken, I am feeling much better and ready for yet another day tomorrow.  So many things to take care of before I move out on the 12th, and before I leave for New Orleans on the 18th.  Packing is the most pressing concern.  Anyone have boxes I could get my hands on?  I could use them... let me know.

      Urgh... Don't know exactly how much sleep I got last night, but it's in the vicinity of 4-5 hours, tops.  Great night, great friends.  Didn't even get drunk.  But it was worth it.  Now to school to pretend teach for the day.  Ah, June. 10.5 days of school left.

      The blog is back on Blogspot.com -- my cable is getting disconnected when I move out of here on the 18th, and with it my webspace at cox.net.  So it's back to the banner ad at the top of the page, although the URL will be much easier to remember now.  Let's see if the ad pisses me off as much as it used to.  Drunk Tuesday is underway.  Quite glad everyone is here.  Wish I could bring myself to call in sick tomorrow.  But there's a concert on Thursday night and the 4th graders need their lessons... some of them badly.  Maybe Friday, if I'm in the mood.  Life is good.  My friends are the best anyone could ask for.   Back to the party.

      One week later, and my new place finally feels like home.&nbsp; There's still clutter all over the place, but it's rapidly disappearing, and I'm just settling in.&nbsp; It's nice to have a home again.&nbsp; Loki has adjusted faster than I ever thought possible.&nbsp; I think my "roll with it" philosophy of life might have rubbed off on him or something, because he's turning into one cool cat.&nbsp;   Today I am going to go check out the Rockville Library.&nbsp; I'm jealous of Leila and Anagha hitting their libraries and getting all sorts of cool stuff.&nbsp; I just need to be more responsible than I was in Manchester... I racked up a $50 fine because I kept stuff for months after it was due.&nbsp;  All in all, life is good.&nbsp; I'm relaxed, mellow, and loving it.&nbsp; I'll write more when I can put words together.

      Tomorrow I move into my new apartment with Dan in Vernon, Connecticut.&nbsp; And I'm excited about it.&nbsp; The place is great, I couldn't possibly have a better roommate, and it's marking the beginning of a new chapter in my life. &nbsp; But in another way, it's a downer.&nbsp; And the source of this feeling is contained within Daniel's Mini-Storage on Main Street... most of Dan's and my possessions. &nbsp; Let me explain.&nbsp; I'm not irritated because I have to move.&nbsp; Well, I am, but THAT I could deal with on its own.&nbsp; Mine is a different feeling, cultivated by a month on the road... a month with no home... a month with nothing holding me back.&nbsp; I'm now about to move back into reality.&nbsp; I suppose it's inevitable.&nbsp; But my possessions seem far more like a weight around the ankle than a blessing to be thankful for.&nbsp; I find myself in a position where I am thinking about selling&nbsp;or giving my stuff away.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I am tired of having so much  stuff...  stuff with no purpose... stuff that just collects dust.&nbsp; I'm a packrat by nature, which makes it worse.&nbsp; Being on the road and wearing about three sets of clothes for a month... and being completely fine with it!... makes me really not quite so happy about reclaiming my possessions because that means I need to deal with them.&nbsp;   It's just an encumbrance I don't need or want right now.&nbsp; Some of them I value enough to deal with the encumbrance.&nbsp; Others I don't.&nbsp; I feel a little hypocritical right now because I'm not sure exactly how far I want to take this.&nbsp; Something... anything... needs to be done about this, though I'm not sure what that is yet. &nbsp; So when you see me freaking out over having too much stuff, you'll know what's going through my head.&nbsp; Maybe I might even give you something.

      "Often I feel I go to some distant region of the world to be reminded of who I really am. There is no mystery about why this should be so. Stripped of your ordinary surroundings, your friends, your daily routines, your refrigerator full of your food, your closet full of your clothes -- with all this taken away, you are forced into direct experience. Such direct experience inevitably makes you aware of who it is that is having the experience. That's not always comfortable, but it is always invigorating.   "I eventually realized that direct experience is the most valuable experience I can have. Western man is so surrounded by ideas, so bombarded with opinions, concepts, and information structures of all sorts, that is becomes difficult to experience anything without the intervening filter of these structures. And the natural world -- our traditional source of direct insights -- is rapidly disappearing. Modern city-dwellers cannot even see the stars at night. This humbling reminder of man's place in the greater scheme of things, which human beings formerly saw once every twenty-four hours, is denied to them. It's no wonder that people lose their bearings, that they lose track of who they really are, and what their lives are really about."  --Michael Crichton, Travels (1988)

      It's been just over a week since the last post.  Oh, how things can change in such a short time...  I'll not expose all here.  I'm not in the habit of writing bare-it-all blog entries, and certainly not about to change now.  But I think I should tell those of y'all that have been living in a cave (or perhaps not in my apartment) a bit of a -- how do you say? -- clue.  The news is simply this:  I'm dating again.  For those of you who know, I've known Leila for a few years now, and been close friends with her for one.  Dating a close friend is a situation I vowed I'd never get tangled up in again, and here I am.  And it's great.  Maybe dating friends is my fate.  Whatever.   I'm feeling very veiled about the whole thing right now, presumably because it's so new.  There's something mystical and very fragile about a new relationship, very similar to a newborn child, that can either grow and flourish or be snuffed out by one stupid action.  In many ways, that's true of us right now, and I'm trying not to be the dumbass who leaves the baby unattended in the tub and later wonders why the damn thing drowned.  Does this make sense?  A little, at least?  I hope so.  I'm still making sense of it myself.  It's wild and wonderful and terribly exciting.  I've got so many walls up from being hurt that pulling them down is a little like walking through a minefield: an errant step in an innocuous-looking direction, and BOOM! shrapnel flies everywhere that had absolutely nothing to do with the trigger.  Yet there it is, flying everywhere, cutting, making you bleed... and the only two things you can do is run back the way you came, the only way you are  positive  is safe, back under cover... or you can doctor yourself up, bandage things the best you can because you know you will heal, and try to step more carefully next time even though you know it will happen again.  But you keep on because you believe that maybe she might be the person with a map.  A map to finally show you the way out of this godforsaken war-torn place.  A map to get you the fuck out of here into that other place that you've only ever heard spoken of in whispers.  The place that, after all these years, you're not even sure exists anymore, but that you believe in just the same because to stop believing means that you are giving up on all that is good and real and truthful and pure.  And that's just not an option, because to give up on those things, the things that have been your compass all these years, means that you may as well just give up on life.  And that's certainly not a fucking option.  So, in the end, you patch yourself up and keep going... not because you're so depserate to find a way out that you're willing to hurt yourself needlessly, far from it.  But you do it because you believe, deep down, that this girl just might be the guide and confidante and mate (in every sense of the word) that you've just  known  was out there all along.  I'm terrified.  But I'm also so amazingly excited that I can't not try.  Something like this can't feel so right and be completely wrong, can it?  I've always maintained that no matter the cost, I would always be willing to strap my heart back onto my sleeve and try again if I thought there was a chance that I might find what I've not yet found.  If I didn't think there was a chance to make this work, I'd never even try.  But I do.  So I am.  And it's worth it, all of it, because who knows?  She just might be the one.  And how could I live with myself if I found out later in life that I had let the love of my life get away because I was too scared to fucking do something about it?  That's not how I live my life.   So here I am, in this delicious place between true friendship and the certainty of love, and I can tell you right now that there's no other place I'd rather be.  .................  I guess I could also just tell you that Leila and I are dating, and that it's amazing, and that I'm incredibly excited and scared at the same time.  But that wouldn't be nearly as telling.  Nor as interesting, I daresay.  But you write your way and I'll write in mine.  Give a call and chat or come by and hang out and I'll tell you more if you like.   For now, I think this is enough.  Maybe more than enough.  But post I shall.
