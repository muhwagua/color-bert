      To prevent boredom setting in from seeing the same people, same four walls of my flat and same, erm, sitting around doing nothing, I've got a  uni friend comming up to visit.  We'll all (7 of us) heading out to Manchester for the night so it should be fun!  Might have some photos too if it all works out.

      It's some sort of dodgy low-budget comedy horror movie. Probably heading straight for cable TV/video/DVD by the looks of it.  By the end of the movie it was apparant that the idea is very much like the Scream trilogy, just set on an island instead.  The murders are not very inventive and pretty much run-of-the-mill stabbings. At least they show the blood and open flesh wounds.  Don't pay to watch this. Required little thinking so was good to have on whilst browsing the 'net. I wouldn't watch it again.  IMDB:  urlLink Club Dread

      Spent the last few hours browsing the IT job websites and being very specific about the work I'm interested in; basically using only the keyword "PHP".  I was actually suprised at how much there is out there in the £30,000+ wage bracket! It's tempting to apply, they only want 2-3 years minimum experience, but I've not made the most of my free time yet.  At the same time I contacted a few people on  urlLink freelancers.net  regarding some small contract work. Will see how it goes with them, a few of the ads were a little old now.  Just realised I've only had one meal today - a pizza! Not that hungry at the moment either. A great way to save some pennies if ever there was one I guess.

      A friend just pointed out  urlLink this  appropriate article over at the BBC.  I can honestly say I'm currently happy being part of the 1.4 million un-employed; and even better - part of the 876,300 actually claiming what benefits are rightly mine!  I liked the definition of an unemployed person in the article, "Low skills, young, lone mothers, no qualifications..." Damn. I need to become a mother some how? Or maybe if I just go hang out somewhere lame I might find myself one? Who knows.  All I can say is that the new series of "Big Brother" is nearly upon us. I need e4 so I can sit watching it all day in my pants.

      The website to spank Google Ads clicking is finally on its own hosting, and coupled with a shiny new domain name too.   urlLink www.spamfo.co.uk  will contain all the info you need on spam scams, news, how to stop spam in your inbox, tracing the spammers and software to clean yourself up.  The name "spamfo" came about from the fuzing of the words info and spam, seeing as that is what the website offers. Magic eh?  Help a doley like myself by visiting the site every date and clicking on a nice banner found down the right hand side of the page. Please? Please-please?

      The afternoon drifted by quite nicely today.  After a spot of tidying up and putting yet more washing on I settled down for a brew and some surfing of the internet sorting out tickets to Gatecrasher: Tiesto in Manchester and Godskitchen: Global Gathering.  Had a visit from a friend too.  I took some time to chase up where my Orange SPV mobile phone had got to with the repairs it went in for. Seems they can't fix it - and even better - after 28 days they have to replace it with a new handset, or if they cannot replace it, with vouchers for me to go and pick up something new from The Link. Great! I can grab a brand new phone and sell it on eBay. Cash in hand. I like it, I like it.

      So far its been two blokes sitting in some sort of Motel room drinking beer and talking about a break-up with a girl. It seems dull. Not sure I'll manage to watch much more of it. I'm bored... but not this bored.  Update: 2:05 PM and the movie has just finished. I was obviously too lazy to not bother turning it off. It didn't really appeal too much. Two guys arguing about a girl, she appears in the Motel room (Uma Thurman) and she messes them about a bit. The end. At least it wasn't too long.

      After ignoring the noises being made by my mobile and landline phones all morning, I finally dragged myself out of the bed.  4 messages and 7 missed-calls. None of which were important - more the morning wake-up call variety.  My Dad ended up telling my mum about the redundancy because I never got around to calling her all week. So not quite sure how she reacted.  I think I found a new bit of possible revenue too: tax back from the Inland Revenue. One of the phone calls this morning was to tell me a letter from the IR had arrived back at my parents. Surely they can't be that efficient?

      A visit to the pub for a pint turned in to a night in pubs. I managed to control spending though, by only taking limited money with me. Clever thinking you see!  At the bar in the first pub money was traded with a group of (what looked like 16 year old) girls in order to buy their beer vouchers off them.  It was the good deed of the day. We got beer, they got their wine.  My horoscope in the paper claimed that Friday might bring me in to money of some description. More benefits maybe? Or an idea that will bring in some cash. Who knows.  I've been told to "Get a proper job" a number of times now. It's an age old gag used for the people in our group of friends who are too slack to have a proper salaried job. I guess that's me right now, but I'm not wanting to change that just now.  Anyway, the after the pub the old idea of tee-shirts sparked up again, except this time it might just be the right point to make this idea a reality. A bit of brain storming with a friend in to the night has left a number of questions left open.  It's getting late, or early, depends how you look at it I guess! Outside it's getting light already, the birds are making their noise and I'm sat on the couch absorbing Ricki Lake show on TV.  I'm really not tired either, it's bad. I must sleep soon so I can get up at a respectable time like 10:30am. There isn't much on the menu for tomorrow, not much of an incentive to go to sleep and get up again.  Infact, that's it - I'm going to bed anyway.

      Staring out of my living room window earlier I noticed how the birds around here must be on a bad diet at the moment. They've covered my dark blue car with so much dirt from their bottoms, it's just wrong.  However, I can't complain as it's just kept me busy for the past 40 minutes giving the car a scrub down with a sponge and bucket. Spending money at a garage for a car wash just isn't sensible without an income  Whilst outside I checked my postbox, my P45 has arrived, along with other documentation regarding the liquidation. The paper work looks a bit dry to be reading right now;plus I've got a date with the local pub in 20 minutes!

      ...but somebody has to sleep all day!  Well my morning kind of went missing. It's comming up to mid-afternoon now and I need to sort out what my plan is for the day.  The shelf of Gamecube titles catch my eye and before I know it I'm settling down for a session   on "Prince of Persia". Finally I've got time to actually play all the games I've bought over the year. I can see myself losing a number of days on the Gamecube over the coming weeks!

      These late night hours are starting to creep in to my daily pattern. It feels good! It's weird that others in the UK are still awake and online too - all have one thing in common, they're students!  I'm living the dream! I'm a student again, just without the assignments and messy house sharing issues.  I really should get some sleep though, otherwise I'll be getting up in the evening like a weirdo.

      Well, it's late, but the website project I'm working on is in a good state and just needs content adding before it can be launched and indexed by Google - ready for the adverts.  The adverts account application is being processed for next Monday so everything needs to be in place on a web host and domain name. A name for the site is still an issue though.

      Tonight I set to making sure I got something set up and ready to go off and hopefully bring in some money (however small) without me having to do anything.  The plan was spawned to make a little revenue from Google advert clicks. The idea works by taking content from many places, gathering it in an archive, then placing context sensitive adverts on the page so that they relate to the articles. Hopefully if Google picks up on the  content it should help it get indexed better and slowly bring people in to the site to click on the adverts.  It's a long shot - but it's also a free set-up and running process, so i've not really got much to lose.  I'm going to aim to get this finished before Friday, this week.

      I've made my first move towards getting what I'm owed.  Had a short introduction chat with the Job Centre regarding my application for jobseekers allowance. They took down a few details to record the fact that I am now unemployed, redundant, and looking for work (ahem). Sadly it's not that quick. I'm told I've got to have a further phone call interview with some other guy next Monday (17th May) at the earliest.  God knows when I'm likely to find some money appearing in my bank account.  Next call was to the local Council regarding applying for excemption from paying Council Tax. This should save me a good £65 a month too.  Hmm, these benefits could be good for me. I hear housing benefit is available for people renting accommodation too. That's next on my hit list!

      Well, my new career has started. Bring on the life of a student once more: sitting in my pants, bacon bagel in hand, watching the joys that are - "This Morning" on ITV.  Its changed quite a bit since I last saw it. Obviously different presenters too. Nothing muchh of interest is on the show, but it passes away the morning I spose.  It feels too early to be doing anything practical on the computer. Plus there's a few odd jobs to sort out.

      Whilst playing with my phone, in a moment of boredom, I discovered why I never got a reply from my mate in Manchester when I was trying to get home in a drunken state.  It seems the text message I spent ages tapping out on my phone was in fact entered as a calendar entry for today. How useful of me!

      All the equipment remaining in the office got priced up today in order to sell off to pay the creditors (of which I am one!).  From what I was told they really didn't take down much detail of all the items. No brand names or specifications, just things like "a flat screen", "a printer". The best bit was all the spares in the server room - it was just classed as "graveyard stock", nothing recorded!

      The work mate I was out in Manchester with last night just arrived at my door. Up, dressed and ready for the day ahead already!  My body feels knackered still and not ready for any action.  Today is an opportunity to meet with the liquidators at the office to ask any questions about our redundancy which may have risen from the booklet we were given at the meeting yesterday. Having not even taken that booklet out of my bag yet I was a bit lost as to what should be asked.  Best pop some clothes on and get down to the office. A shower can wait, I need to start smelling like an unemployed lazy bum.

      So yesterday afternoon (Monday) brought about a bit of a turn-around for my working week. The company I worked for decided to place itself in to "Creditors Voluntary Liquidation".  The whole event was nicely done though. The staff got taken to a local hotel to have a meeting, and ultimately hear the bad news about the companies state.  So there it was - some were in shock at hearing the news, others stayed quiet. For some reason I had a grin inside me, but I wasn't sure why. Maybe it was the feeling that this could be the opportunity I needed to get some time to put other plans in to motion at long last. No work in the way. No tiredness. No excuses. I'll see how this goes as the days go on.  After the hotel meeting was over a few of us met up in the local pub for a drink and a chat. After most people had left, and a few more beers, the crazy idea of going out on the beers in the city centre of Manchester was on the cards.  A phone call later and two of us were on our way to the city centre. The route taken was Manchester Met. Student Union -> Fab Cafe -> 5th Avenue. Wow, cheap drinks in 5th Avenue still, 75p! Just what the unemployed need.  I was truely battered because I hardly remember a thing.  After stopping off at Monsoons kebab house on Oxford Road a bus was caught to somewhere. I was racking my brain to remember where a friend lived outside of Manchester; looking back I'm not really sure why I wanted to get there! After catching a random bus I set about hammering out a text message to him to find out where I should be heading. "Benchhill" seemed to be in my head for some reason?  We ended up in Parrswood outside the 24hour Tesco with the bus driver telling us to get off as it was the end of the journey.  Lost and without an idea of how to get home I led us to the supermarket for inspiration.  After a wonder around the shop, and buying a copy of this months Mixmag, I found a button on the wall to summon a taxi. A genius idea for the drunken clientel of Tesco. No phone dialing, no confusion of explaining where you are: it just works!  An expensive £25 taxi ride back home ended the night at about 3:30am. I still feel rough and shakey this morning for some reason. I must have been really drunk!

      My new 0% for 9 months credit card arrived in the post today. "Great" I thought. Can shift the outstanding balance on my Halifax/iPoints and RBS credit cards whilst I don't have an income to pay them off.  However, the balance transfers for Bank of Scotland/Halifax group credit cards are a bit lame. You cannot transfer the balance from an existing card from any bank within the group!  This is probably in the fine print somewhere but they don't bother telling people when they brag about their balance transfers!  On the same theme of credit cards here's a tip for dole bludgers who are wanting to hide/not-declare their savings.  Get a credit card which has a nice £0 balance. Maybe one you don'y use anymore. Then pay your current savings to the ccard sothat your account becomes positive. Might be a bit odd, but bare with me...  So all your savings are now on your credit card, nice and same. Okay, they wont be earing more interest, but they are out of the way of the nosy Benefits agency. You can start saving more now, just keep it under the £3000 mark.  The good thing about putting your money on the ccard is that when filling out the initial claim form they ask for details and current balance of all your bank accounts 9current and savings) as well as information about shares, national savings, bonds etc. The only thing they don't care about (and I doubled checked this in my meeting) is credit cards. They assume they will always be negative, and all they care about is what positive balances you have to off-weigh what money they will give you in benefits. Damn bastards.  To get at your money you just need to call your credit card company and ask for a cheque to be sent out for the in-credit balance on your card -or- just spend the money via your credit card as needed.  This is why its best to do it on an un-used card, so that you don't go silly and waste all your savings on day-to-day items.  Hope that info will help somebody out.

      It's only been a day or so since the Google Ads went on to the Spam Information ( urlLink www.spamfo.co.uk ) website; it's already looking pretty promising though!  A pile of clicks giving a nice $20 so far.  For doing nothing extra, other than updating content now and then, it seems pretty good. At the very least it's beer money, isn't it?  Will post updates on how the revenue performs whilst I'm unemployed. It'll be interesting to see if it's sustained throughout the month.

      I've just spent the last five hours working on updating some code for a product sold by a company I no longer work for. Am I mad? Yes I think after so many wasted hours I am.  I guess I'm just trying to ensure everything stays good - but working with this old messy program code is doing my head in. Going to take a break now I think, go for a walk to the postbox, make breakfast and play a bit of "Prince Of Persia" on my Gamecube.

      Whilst playing "Prince Of Persia" throughout the night on the Gamecube I recieved a rather exciting sounding email.  A warehouse rave to be held in manchester. All I've got is a mobile phone number to call on the night of June 5th. Bring your own booze, free entry (donations accepted). From the email:  "Six Arenas, capacity of thousands, Big name DJs!  Hardcore, Techno, Psychedelic Trance, Gabba, Oldskool, DnB, Reggae, Oldskool Hardcore, Chill Out, Hip Hop, etc.  Outdoor chill-out, full toilet facilities, canteen, fire jugglers, friendly atmosphere, lots of random madness!"  Sounds like an experience I couldn't say no to really! if you know me and want the info about this, send me an email.  On a more dull note, the Google ads are finally live on the Spam website - so advert clicks can be money at long last!

      Hey, hey, hey!  One CV submission and I get an offer of being put forward for the interview. Seems easy this job application lark. Not sure if I want to go ahead with it yet though.  Job wage was £30k->£35k. So a tidy little packet.  Seemed dead easy too, writing scripts to extract data from places and generate various reports in HTML. Superb!  UPDATE: I actually bothered to look on the map for where Birkenhead is. It's bloody miles away from my place. So I've contacted the job agency and said thanks, but no thanks.

      Popped back to the old office this afternoon for a catch up with the old team.  I was hoping it might be more concrete details of possible future employment; however at this moment it's all about the creditors and stuff.  Nothing much really happened except for valuing equipment remaining int he office to see if it was worth buying back for a lump sum. Most of it is a bit old these days anyway.

      Can't sleep. Must have been that cheeky cuppa coffee earlier. Well, I've not even tried to sleep.  Was at a loose end so tweaked my CV a little with the latest buzz-words that were relevant to me. Was reading  urlLink a random job site  about what they look for in CVs these days. Before I knew what was going on I had searched for jobs, found one which appears to be in Manchester and submitted my CV.  Bam! Just like that. Well, it's only a larf, innit?

      I'm currently at a loose end at this hour. Fancied something different to the Internet after slavin away on the WarChild site (mentioned in previous post). I've now spammed FHM and  urlLink B3ta.com  to see if there is any interest in featuring my new web-baby.  Anyway, back to my experiment. I found a "Twinings Infusions: Camomile & Spiced Apple" tea bag in my cupboard. One of them trial ones. Gonna give it a whirl, it's weird, strictly no milk to be put in the cup. I've never had tea without milk!  Verdict: It stinks like your mums bubble bath smellies. It tastes, however, of nothing more than warm apple juice. The smell is quite off putting: nearly making my stomach turn. But the taste is okay. Not worth buying though - what's the point in it?  EDIT: The teabag is disgusting, I tipped the rest away. Had to make a fresh cuppa coffee to get rid of the taste. I blame the camomile - whatever it is!

      As a treat for putting up with the boring jobseekers chatting all afternoon I've decided that my first weeks allowance is going to pay for my ticket to the  urlLink Godskitchen Global Gathering 2004  festival!  I picked up the tickets in HMV, 5 of them for myself and friends. The total was about £260, the guy behind the counter seemed a little shocked - but then said "Oh but it's for the whole weekend innit?" I had to break the news to him that it was just the one day/night. Heh.  Still something to look forward too - AFTER - Ibiza holiday.  The summer is going to be good.

      Having just returned from a round trip to the job centre I'm glad to be home.  The job centre - full of  urlLink chavs  with their trousers tucked in their socks, and young single mums. Stereotyped - but all present and correct, scrounging just like me!  After the 50 minute telephone conversation at lunch time I thought it would be a quick pop in and chat. Oh no, their shiny new(ish) computer system was still having teething problems so they could not access all the information I had given earlier on the phone. AND - because i had managed to get an appointment the same day, I didn't have the printed copy of it that is sent to me in the post. So, to cut a long boring chat short, I had to fill out the same form - again.  I made the desk gimp copy the contents of my housing benefits form insteaqd of me speaking because I was a little annoyed with the whole broken system.  After having my documents all duplicated I got moved to another desk where a rather nice young lady perched. She was going to help me finding a new job. ahem.  She asked what kind of work I wanted to do - so i just gave the spec of my previous job to her, including wage expectations. She was a bit amazed it seemed at the wage I said. Then began rattling on about how she recently got a virus on her PC (she seemed like the dippy sort that would open an attachment from a random person) and called the helpline, only to find she got charged £1 a minute for 15+ minutes on the phone. I said nothing, except noted how stupid women are.  So I signed a load of declarations and got my signing on book. Every two weeks I have to go in and have a chat about work. For the first 13 weeks I get contribution-based job seekers allowance, based on the national insurance payments i've made from my previous job. Seems fair that I'm getting something back, from what I've paid in.  I also found out that if you're 25 year old or more you get increased benefits for both jobseeking and housing. Yeay for me! 24 year olds and below are expected to be able to live in a 1 bedroom studio/bedsit/grot pad it seems.  My exact money has not yet been specified. I'll reveal all when it turns up in my bank account.

      Just had a 50 minute phone call from the Job Centre about my seekers allowance claim. They kindly rolled in the housing/council tax benefit claim too. Which kind of annoyed me as I wasted Saturday morning filling out the seperate book for them - now that's void!  The [old] lady on the phone, a friendly scouser, seemed nice enough and had a joke around too - especially when I was put on hold and made to listen to nasty violin noise.  I knew she was old because she said her son was about to go to Uni.  Question after pointless question started to wear me out. Stupidest question I remember was "How many living rooms are there in the building?"  - why-o-why-o-why is that relevant to me??  I've got my appointment at the jobcentre at 2:20pm so need to climb out of my pants and in to some jeans.

      I awoke this morning at 5am on the couch (again). The couch has some strange properties - at one end, it makes you sleepy if sitting on it for too long in the evening. But the plus point is you wake up on it early and refreshed!  I was so awake this morning that, after breakfast, I got changed and legged it out the flat for a jog down the  urlLink Transpennine trail  and back up the Waterbridge canal! What's going on?!? Took 40 minutes, although I did walk a bit on the way back due to a slight problem. I wont go in to that here, for your sake.  The day ahead has a few things to do. Feeling a little sleepy now so might take a nap for a couple of hours before my jobseekers phone interview session at midday.

      Weather is great outdoors today! I've opened all the windows in the flat to freshen the place up.  Was out in Manchester last night, drinking away the money I don't have. Had a pretty action packed evening covering quite a few bars before ending in the club "M2" (at least I think it was called that this week) in Manchester city centre. It was awful, R&B does my head in.  Not much happening at the moment. Might commence my next project after I've had a shower.

      Been having real difficulty going to bed, and then getting out of bed the next day. I just cannot seem to break out of the nodding back off to sleep phase! Argh! it's starting to annoy myself now.  Today I forced myself out at about 1pm and just started cleaning the flat to wake me up, washing up, window sills, bathroom, hoovering the whole place. Seemed to work at least!  I've spent the afternoon chasing up loose ends too.  * Benefits payment has still not arrived in to my account. Upon checking up with my local office I'm told the first payment always arrives as a Giro in the post. I've not had anything though. Maybe one of them buggers at the sort office has robbed it? I found that I will be eligable for £55.65 per week.  * My council tax benefit (excemption from paying it) hadn't been flagged yet so they were wanting money out of me still. Had to set them straight. I was told it will take up to six weeks to process my housing benefit claim too. What a wait!  Being productive today feels good.  I've been so slack over the past couple of days. It might be the weather today thats got me active, it's raining, I like it.

      I rolled out of my bed at 8:20pm tonight. Managed a whole night and day lying there! Do I win a prize? Probably not...  I did find time to lie there and watch a couple of movies though.  "The Scarecrow" was a little bit of a dodgy movie. The acting often came across as cardboard and the script a tad shakey. The idea revolved around a teenager who got picked on at school, and eventually a Scarecrow that seeks revenge on the bullies. The film has a very B-movie feel to it, and even names  urlLink Troma  in the end credits which might explain a bit.  " urlLink The Bone Snatcher " (2003) which was actually not that bad to watch. A nice idea for a scary terror monster lurking out there and some decent enough effects on a, what seems to be, low budget film.

      Last night was  urlLink Gatecrasher at The Academy in Manchester .  Tiesto paid a visit and the whole night was quality. A lot of people stopped and asked me for drugs though, I didn't think I looked like somebody who would be peddling! One guy asked me what I would swap with him for his Playstation, completely lost me what he was on about initially - just kept asking him what the hell he was on about. Then it clicked, and I sent him on his way.  Am still fairly battered this afternoon. Just mongin' out on the couch watching the Manchester Run on TV for some reason.

      My trip to the job centre was a success. After filling out the form about never recieving my giro I was issued a new one. Cashed it, and am now £87-odd better off.  I didn't even have to show any ID when cashing the giro at the Post-Office; Yet, the three chavs at the counter next to me got turned away because the only ID they had was a scruffy letter. Hah.  Whilst hanging about in the job centre waiting for my turn to grumble about my giro I did a job search on their terminals.  Found one "web programmer" job in the UK, and it just happened to be at one of my prefered destinations for my plans of a "Benefits Tour 2004": Exeter, Devon!  The jobs wage is very low, and to me not worth getting out of bed for. However they require exactly what I have on my CV (HTML, PHP, Networking knowledge and other noddy tasks) so it should allow me to at least get an interview and (fingers crossed) free transport down there thanks to benefits. More on how this works later...

      Last Tuesday (25th May) I signed on for the first time down at the job centre. Great, let the allowance roll in to my bank account.  By Friday I still hadn't recieved my back pay from May 11th when I put in the application. I phoned the job centre, only to be told that the initial payment is made by a Giro which is sent to me in the post. Oh joy, I have to stand in a que at the Post Office and get my money. Proper doley scum!  Saturday came and went, nothing arrived in the post. Of course, it was bank holiday yesterday so nothing again. Today, nothing in the post except more wasted money from the RSPB - and a free pen made out of paper.  I called the job centre and my Giro is now to be classed as cancelled and I must go in to the job centre to fill out yet more forms to declare it lost and cancelled. I've delayed going in to the job centre until tomorrow lunch time - hoping my Giro will arrive in the post in the morning. Please, please?  On another follow-up. I chased up the location of my Orange SPV mobile phone which I returned to Mastercare as it was broken. I have a new mobile now but am hoping to get the SPV fixed and on ebay to generate some income to live on - whilst playing the benefits game. It has been away for 6 weeks now, and finally been declared knackered so I'm getting a replacement in the next 5-7 days. We'll see how smoothly that goes, without me having to badger them on the phone. Idiots.  Argh, why can't anything be easy for a change?

      What a joke the jobcentre benefits service is. Today was signing on day again and I discovered that once again my payment is messed up. This time it's not going in to my bank as originally instructed, instead it's being mailed out to me as a damn Giro cheque - again!  Even better, I am unable to give the correct bank details over ther phone; I  must  travel all the way back to the damn job centre to fill out yet another form.  I just hope the Giro doesn't go missing again in the post this week.  A little piece of extra info I gleamed today; when going to a job interview my travel expenses will be paid for by the job centre, to the sum of 25p per mile if using my own car. Better than nowt - but it's only available for jobs outside of Warrington, this includes Manchester, Liverpool and beyond!

      Last night was something a little different. Rather than spending the night in a string of pubs, bars and a club at the end I took a risk. A couple of mates and myself went on the search for an illegal Warehouse party being held in Manchester.  I found out about it last month via email from a Hardcore mailing list. You can join the mailing list at the  urlLink Hardcore Mission  website.  We were led from Oxford Road, around a housing estate to the venue, a dis-used Timber yard with numerous buildings on the site. It looked like an ideal place for the event, dirty - piles of rubble around etc. The main "arena" looked like it had been used for similar events in the past, the back wall had an array of speaker boxes graffiti along the back wall.  We were part of the first group to arrive on site so everything was just being set up. Padlocks being hack sawed off to let vans full of equipment in, lights being enabled etc. All quite exciting stuff - but they certainly took their time getting everything rolling. We must have been standing around for an hour.  For free, the event was more than good enough. Pitty we didn't have more time to get drunk earlier in the evening. It all happened a bit last minute for us.

      Just as I was about to leave the car park in town (from visiting the jobcentre etc.) I got a phone call from the guy who interviewed me yesterday. I've been offered the job, on a 12 month contract basis with an initial 1 month trial. It'll be working with a company called  urlLink Co-ord Limited .  So is this the beginning of the end for my benefit diary? I don't know just yet; I'm still owed back payments for housing benefit at least, and I'm going to make sure I get something from the slackers at Warrington Borough Council.  The next challenge is: self-employed, along with the joys of tax returns, or full employment by the company. Decisions. But as I heard on TV - if you think about the risks in everything you'll never get anywhere, so maybe I should just jump in and set myself up as self-employed?

      I've not slept yet - since getting up at 9am on Wednesday. I decided to stay up and get in to town to visit the jobcentre and council offices to tie up some loose ends with claims.  Over at the job centre I put in my claim for travel to the interview yesterday. Forms, forms, forms. Duplicating the same data over and over (name, address, national insurance number, date of birth blah blah blaaaaaah).  I was getting more and more tired but keeping calm and laid back.  I then went to another desk to finally put and end to my benefit payment method - and hand in my bank details. Argh, more forms again - why can they not just enter it in to the computer system? I commented to the woman that I'd given these bank details twice before, and she said it would not surprise her as there is a black hole that a lot of things "fall into". Now that started annoying me. She just gave the impression that she really couldn't give a flying f&*k.  Does the local council have to employ plebs and retards to do the jobs in these social services? They really do a good job and driving you to a point where you just want to get a job and get away from having to visit the place!  I then trotted round to the council offices to sort out the long lost housing benefit I applied for on the 12th May. I had to take in the 'evidence' requested from the letter I received the other day. I was getting a bit more irritated from lack of sleep by this point, so decided to ask the lady taking copies what had happened to the other set that were taken back on May 12th. She said that if they weren't done by her, at her reception desk, then they will probably have gotten lost. What a bunch of incompetent, slow, useless, fools.  It will be another 3 weeks until I hear anything about housing benefits.  Now I'm real mad. Think I need to consider sleep soon.

      Received a letter this afternoon from the Housing Benefits department at Warrington Borough Council.  Back when I went for my initial Jobseekers interview I also handed over all the forms for my Housing Benefit (Council Tax etc) claim. They took copies of my tenancy Agreement, ID etc.  The letter today said they had finally (!) received my application (the jobcentre and housing offices are in separate buildings in the town centre) and they could not process my claim until I go to their office and produce ID, tenancy Agreement amongst a list of other requirements.  Are these people working in the offices retarded? Maybe that's where I'd be placed If I failed to get a job for over 52 weeks. It's scary. Not to mention bloody annoying now. Fuckers. FUCK FUCK FUCK. Grrr. That's the first time I've typed a swear word in this diary. Fuckers.

      I don't think today could have got much worse when I tried to get to my job interview in Liverpool city centre.  I left early to ensure and hic-ups didn't delay me. I packed a newspaper to read when I arrived early too. Huh, or so I thought I would be early.  The interview was as 2:30pm, I left at 1pm - a whole one and a half hours of time to play with before the meeting at the  urlLink FACT  building down some small side street in Liverpool.  I got as far as the slip road leading on to the M6 from my home. The traffic was parked up all up the sliproad; looking over on to the M6 it was all stopped too. The afternoon was not looking good - thank god for my car air-conditioning. I was near enough stopped at the entrance to the slip road: ideas floated through my head about reversing a little and getting back on to the round about to find a quicker way via Warrington town centre. Then the National Express coach rolled up and blocked me in.  45 minutes later I'd gotten down the M6 and off on to the M62. Turns out it was an accident in the same direction I was heading. A van has mashed itself up on the bridge above the Manchester Ship Canal. Not much to see really.  The directions to the FACT building from the M62 weren't too hot either - or at least I never saw a sign which pointed out the metropolitan cathedral, all the other cathedrals had their signs! So from that problem I got lost amongst the streets of Liverpool, cruising around reading road signs. Luckily I managed to locate a street I recognised.  I pulled up in a car-park (piece of waste land amongst warehouses). I asked the attendant where I could park as it was pretty packed. He said "Park where you want mate, makes no difference" (in a scouse accent). Was a bit wary of leaving my car there but choices were limited, and I was now late for my interview.  Then a shock. My wallet. Where was it? No where to be seen in the car that's for sure, I started wondering how I was going to pay for the car-park charge upon my return. I must have left my wallet at home, I thought. Luckily digging about in the car pockets and various holes - I found a pound coin, exactly what I needed. Phew!  Then the mobile rings, the guy is wondering where i am. Five minutes later and I stroll in to the cafe area of the building. Slightly breaking in to a sweat - the sun was very hot today.  An hour later. The interview went well, he basically said that "I don't want to get your hopes up, but I think you're ideal for the job". I'll get contacted next Tuesday to confirm it. I've now got to decide if I want to be employed by them, or operate as a freelance and do my taxes myself (that should be an experience).  Getting home wasn't so bad, although I think I went round the houses in Liverpool looking for the M62 sign. Glad to be out of there!  Upon arriving home I ran round the place looking for my wallet. It was nowhere to be seen. Then I started wondering if I'd dopped it whilst in the village earlier today. I went back to search the back seats of the car.. and there it was, wedged down the front passenger side door! Argh.

      I got a few more details about how and what you can claim from the jobcentre for travelling to  job interviews.  * The job must be at least 16 hours a week * The job should last for at least 3 months * If driving, the car mileage must be measured, and it will then be compared to some RAC route planner software in the jobcentre. They pay 25p per mile. * If paying for car parking, you must get a receipt if the ticket itself does not have the cost printed on it. * Proof of interview confirmation (hard copy of an email for example)  Oh and usually you must go in and organise the claim before the interview, unless the interview was organised last minute.

      I've got the possibility of starting a new job this coming wednesday. However, just been doing the maths and it doesn't seem so great after all!  The hourly rate appears to be coming out at £9.13 per hour! This is for a 3 day a week role. Comparing this with the current dole wage. Is it worth it at all? On top of this hourly rate I have to pay for all my own expenses (electricity, broadband, internet etc.) plus the other stuff I currently get on benefits - rent and council tax contributions.

So I'll do it next week on the day I would normally be signing on. &nbsp; I also checked up with the housing benefits place - to make sure i'll still get all my back dated pay from them. It appears i will. I cannot believe how long they can make Housing Benefit application take - it's now well in to the third month!

      Popped along to a company on Deansgate in Manchester late this afternoon. I've been holding out for an interview at this place for about two weeks now and finally I got a time and date for the interview. &nbsp; The place was quite cool.&nbsp; A basement studio where the marketing and developers all lived in a single room. Was a little dark due to no natural light, but it had a bit of a .com feel to it - trendy looking. &nbsp; I'm now awaiting a programming test to be emailed to me. I then have to return to the office next week to go over the result and talk to one of their other developers. &nbsp; However, after the initial interview I'm not sure if I want to do the work. It all sounded a little samey - content management systems (CMS) for bespoke marketing websites. And that was about the whole thing. &nbsp; They hadn't offered a salary, so told them I wouldn't&nbsp;get out of bed&nbsp;for anything less than £25k - they obviously asked me what wage i was looking for first! &nbsp; I'll see what happens. But I can't say I'm  too  fussed about getting this job.

      So I wondered in to the Job Centre this afternoon. Sat around waiting for 25 minutes because the fools got my name on the list mixed up, and i added it 2 more times after they appeared to "miss" me the first time.  Anyway, put in my final claim for travel expenses to Manchester - and then handed in the cardboard form from my sign-on book.  Yeah, that's it - i handed in the "i've got full time employment" form! Which offically ends my life as a dole scrubber ... for now!  So what's going on with me? Well I have the 3 days a week of work at Co-ord Limited (working from home). It's not much, but will pay the rent for now.  Then I have plans to set up business with a mate doing what we know best, and hopefully making it big time on our own ... rather than for others. So will see how it goes.  Goodbye!

      Yesterday I received a letter regarding my "Jobseeker's Allowance". It basically covered the ending of my allowance, however there was a little sparkle of info in the text:   "If you are not going to get any money at the end of your first week's work, you can apply for money from the Social Fund until you get your first earnings."   Oooh! Free money I thought... I tried calling as soon as I read the letter (Yesterday) but the lazy people at the Job Centres across the UK were on some sort of  urlLink industrial action . I think it's  urlLink  ridiculous that staff at the Job Centre think they deserve the right to slack off work and mess about like kids; they do jack all work in there and shuffle paper about slowly to keep themseves employed! It's a joke.  Anyway, finally spoke to somebody in the know today and it turns out this "Social Fund" is only a 0% loan until you get your first earnings. To get it you need a letter from your employer saying that they are not intending to pay you in advance for the first months wages.  To me it all sounded like a lot of work for nothing. So have scrapped the idea - it's not worth it.

      As a special gift from the Warrington Housing Authority I finally recieved my housing benefit - AFTER stopping my benefits.  It was back payment for two months, rather than the 3 months I was nearly unemployed for. I got a total of £89.75 a week towards my rent (totalling £807.75). This is calculated on a personal basis so wont be the same for others - especially if you are under 25 years old.  My monthly Council Tax also got reduced to a nice £5 a month - instead of £61. However, now that I am employed again all this is pretty useless to know. Oh well :-(

      I decided to not let the Housing Authority get away with stealing nearly a months worth of my money. Because they lost my claim I originally put in via the Job Centre it all got a little messy - and I had to re-submit all my claim again, after I had called them to find out where it was up to.  Today I called them to complain and ask where my 20 days worth of housing benefit it.  I got told that the first part of my claim is being reviewed agaisnt some "strict government guidelines" and may or may not be paid up to me!  There isn't even an estimated time scale for how long this could take. Pretty pathetic, they sure know how to stretch something out.

       Argh. The firt headache of setting up a business - thinking of a name. it#s impossible (or almost) and has been going on now for about a month!  It's not even just a case of finding a free name over at  urlLink Companies House  anymore. Every good business has a matching  urlLink website domain name , or at least a domain close to the business name - to help customers remember!  To add to the problem you then want to get at least a majority response from friends and family that the name is good.  So far we've not succeeded with anything. The name is a real show stopper too - its needed for the business plan before you can go to the bank, needs to go on any letters sent to potential clients when looking for business, business cards, loads of things.  It's a royal pain.
