      The silence is deafening! It is like going back to the days when I used to study late into the night...Everything come to a standstill. Having the the chance to meet the inner-self. Do some reflection. One more time, going down memory lane. It used to be living the teenage days in memory lane. All those wild time in uniforms. Nowadays, it is just about the months from March to June.   I miss those time in the sofa, late in the night, alone, in darkness, staring into space. Enticipating for the morning, to be greeted with cheerful smiles, bright sunshine, cool morning air. You take a step back, relax and fall into the bed to cuddle the cool blanket.  Prepare the food in the later morning... see those eggs being cooked, smell the boiling soup... Cool showers for waking up in the afternoon and the day begins.... at 5pm. Words of love... calls for encouragemen...  Just 6 months and the world changes. Expectation and more expectations. Why the change? I miss those sweet evenings  The silence is deafening! It is like going back to the days when I used to study late into the night... but its different now.

      A simple chat or sharing that frustrating moment of the day are all that is needed to end the day happily. A hug or a kiss after the chat will make it even better. Life has too many expectation, even more when external factors are taken into consideration. Simplicity is often the most profound in many people's eye. How can someone be looking up to you at one moment and despise your attitude at the other?  I am just a simple guy, standing in front of you asking you to tell me you love me... asking you to hug me to appreaciate my presence... asking you to kiss me for the extra mile to go... asking you to support me in whatever I do...  and asking... Will you walk that tough journey with me?

      Last night, I finally got confirmation of the kiss... It hurts... but at least it is real. No longer wondering on why the not telling... not truthfully sharing. I rather know and drop everything.....  Many times I wonder, if he is really forcing her, she din like it, why then she still goes out with him? Somewhere along the line, there has to be some testing on whether he is the correct one. Well... perhaps if he did not reveal all these, she might be with him now. Cant deny that he  is a good pick... wondering about what she feels when she is out with him... during then... holding hands... walking down shops... well, she din like it now.  Memories of that fine Wednesday kept flooding my mind, out with him the earlier part of the day and meeting me in the evening. I felt so love then... walking her home....... but how was she feeling when she met him in the morning and me at night.... miserable? glad to meet me? prefer me to him.... or just "Phew".  How long was her life away without me? How was she expecting me to take all these? How did she want me to go with this relationship during that period of time. Is this a test of relationship? I know I can take a kiss... some fondles... but never beyond that. A kiss and fondle can be forced... but do you necessary have to go out again and again if it is being forced? Especially if she is one whereby I will do what I like.. you cant control me. So does she like him more than me....... for that period? I wonder again and again.  What is a relationship if you cannot say out loud what you do not like about your partner? What is a relationship when you do not share your troubles, share your time, keeping aware of what each other is doing..... at least generally. What is a relationship if you hurt the other so much...  Do people stay together just because they are afriad of lonelines? Do people stay together because there is some underlying benefits?  Do people stay together because the partner is the one to love me most therefore you will be happy?  Saying I love you is not the words I want to hear from you. its not that I want to, not to say but if you only knew, How easy, it would be to show me how you feel, more than words,  its all you have to do to make it real then you wouldnt have to say that you love me cos I already know.  MOre than words. Sometimes it is just more than words. I think I need a sign........

      I came here so that I can write down what marks my life for the past month. It has not been easy to know that you are lying.... you are with someone.. knowing what you have done and pretending things to be fine. Trying to do some mental debate on whether things are actually fine on all those sleepless nights. It has been tiring to debate with my inner self.  My heart race away everytime I imagine about the nights you are happily chatting away, picturing your outings and all other things... but not with me. I wonder how we have drifted in this short span of time. It was beating so fast that it aches to just think about how things have been going. It fits so well to the phrase " Love till it aches".  I came to realise that my life is coming apart just sitting here waiting.... waiting for a change in the current situation. I just have to take ownership of how things have become and how I can change it back to how things were. It has been a struggle. I have to decide on whether I should call people to ask about you. I have to decide on letting you know that I do know what is going on. I have to decide on whether all this is worth while. I have to decide on what to change in my lifestyle so that you know that my life revolves around yours. Most importantly, I have to deciede if I still want you.  Just like you, I have forgiven but I cannot forget... at least not in the near future. I have to show my love even more..... as with you showing me your love. We have to let each other know that we have each other to be the center of our lives. It hurts to know that love is not as intense as before... but we know that we can build this up again. We have been there, done that. We need to do this together... with love.  I have learn from the NLP that your thinking dictates your outer actions. I am trying to change my mindset on how things have been... I hope you do too. Give ourselves some time to build this up again... I love you.

      Life is so fragile. One moment you are here and the other you might just be gone. Live life to the fullest so that you enjoy every moment as if this is the last day of your life. Dun be sad... be happy. Then wat the heck am I doing in office? Should tell Sabby that....  Minds and thoughts are such complicated stuff that you never know how one is thinking. Some fickle minded, some strong minded, others are just plainly without any thoughts of their own. If it is so easy to change thinking about something, who will ever coiled the phrase " old habits die hard"? Trying to take some stuff of the mind, cant do so...  "Ultimately, Enjoy!"  I think I am enjoying the moment I have back in the memory lane... so I guess I am still fine.  I am stressed... stressed by all the unnecessary stuff in my life. Stressed by those stuff which to other meant nothing. So why am I still thinking and trying to make good?  I need a Drink!

      I figured what happened. Thats coz I was staying in the past all the while. Thinking of that sweet smile, that loving look.  Just remember that night, the distance felt and the disgusted look from her... Sigh... never the same again. Still she make my head turn when I see her.  Remembering that time when I was going to call her to look at some pretty gal and realised that she is the one... ha!  Have to start thinking or self talk tat she hates me, she hates me..... Yet, I dun mind being hated, just being here is enough. What contradiction!   The dilematic me now... is there even this word?

      I wonder how much of a memory lane I am going to walk down before I decide to track a different path. Sometimes it is just difficult and pictures just float into my mind. No one says it was easy to forget someone that you love. The question is do I really want to forget about her and pretend nothing has happened?  Why people always do not know how to treasure what they have. It always have to be at the moment when they lost it that they are whinning about it. So I am just common after all, taking things for granted. Does she knows that I even love her even when I am not around, working, wondering how she is doing?  Communication is everything in any relationship. You know that you are gone when two are not able to communicate and talk over things like adults. Was I even given the chance to talk or was I just so insensitive about everything?  Work, by itself,  often has no meaning if you do not have any targets to look forward to, no one to share the joy of accomplishment and agony of some stupid colleagues that backstab you to look good for herself. She has to listen thru some of these stuff, but at times with all her troubles you wonder if you should boke her down with all the unhappy moments in the office. Next time, ask then share...  Feelings. There is nothing in this world call I know you so well that I can predict what you are going to do. Utimately, I dun know that she remains upset and she din know that I still love her despite all the arguments.  Base line for everything... GET A GOOD HANDPHONE THAT WILL NOT DIE ON YOU WHEN IT IS CRITICAL FOR YOU TO TALK. A good relationship that you treasure might just be lost like that... coz you are not able to get her at the time that matters most.  Well... if she comes back... take her back anyday. For how long....?

      Found the solution to the headache. Its either Heniken, Daiquri, peanuts or just speed driving.  Drove around just now. Ya, I think I enjoy the 160 in loud music. Shall do that again sometime. Doing without her...  Dun think I dare to do with her around on this... would not want her to get worried. Then again... she dun care now.  Sunday just is not the same anymore. Time seems so slow. When she was around, I always managed to sleep late, wake up for late lunch, watch TV and go shopping with mum. So easy to pass Sunday then. Now it was like....  Well.... drive drive drive.

      Those little panadol pills dun help anymore. The hang over is all time bad. Wonder how much I drank last night. Damn the headaches. The bright side is that I got some sleep...  So this is the way it is going to be. Not replying so as to let me know there is no chance. Hate those sleepless nights. Somehow, I really hope that she will be back after sometime. Give us a chance to see this thru... let me be a better bf. She can go if I am not good enough. But I haven done my best... she has no idea. Yet, I know she will not be back coz I have been such a lousy guy to her. If we cant even communicate, how am I going to get her back?  I know I want her to be happy, want to let her go. I just dun know how to face myself... I hate who I am, am how I have been  Argh... pain. Later

      I am not crying and I am not drunk. But I cant sleep... Guess I might as well pen stuff down.  It has just came to the point for her. I was at point A, trying to work to have a better career, earning more so that I can provide more. She was at point B, needed someone to accompany. being there just being there, even when that person cant provide. Different phase of lives brought the love away from her. She has always been the one that I care for and love thru these time. But enough is enough for her... hou sum fan sau. She just wants to let me go coz she cant see the future with me? I tried too hard wanting to give her a good life. I think too much in material wealth for her... she dun need those....   Regrets in live...  This relationship is definitely a good one in my life. There are so many things I wanted to do with her... for her.  But I never told her so.  There are so many moments that I was frustrated with her yet I still love her, always love her... for who she is But I never told her so.  There are times that I left her alone, so that she can grow and not depend too much on me, for fear that if accidents do happen, how she is going to cope. Never once I wanted to leave her. But I never told her so.  Wanted to give her a surprise birthday treat at the hilltop with the bonus, but I never told her... how can I tell her if it is going to be a surprise?  So much things untold, so many things not yet done, so much love remains. But I never told her so.  That branch ring....  I made a promise to be with her and make her happy. She promise to be with me no matter what. "I'll take it that you have proposed" what happened?  Wondering if Clarissa might be surprise to know that she no longer have to be utterly disappointed by me anymore, not by my dun-care-ness, not able to hurt her again and again.... was I that bad? what she din know was that at the back of my mind while I work is all her... well, reasons are reasons, excuses are excuses, no point mentioning after she left. I just wasnt up to her standard.  After 2 years, Wenlong still harps on Clarice. Miao is now at her 3rd now.. still thinking of him. How long will I take? Till someone comes along.. when it happens, it happens.... and it happened for her. As long as she is happy.... how long can I continue to tell myself that? Cant take it that way.... felt so pathetic for myself... felt so lost without her... so many of my stuff already revolve around her...   Wondering where is her ID tag key chain now... wondering where is the my valentine stick that used to be in her car... wondering where are the gifts now... Wondering where are our pictures... Wondering where is that big pillow... wondering if she is still wearing the pendant.... wondering....  All inside that box, stuff into one corner.. never to be seen again and only to show the new guy what useless this guy has been.  I miss those times when she's at my place... Miss those times that she whines... Miss those times when she suggest to go away... Miss hugging her, kissing her..  Miss those times that I was sitting next to her to watch her sleep. Miss her yellow car.... miss those sessions in the cars.... miss her.....  Wonder why she dun reply the sms. So as to make clear that I have got no chance again? Coz she really for disgusted by me? So that her new guy cant see? so..... what?  How can she be so heartless???  Shit. Just got scared by my own reflection in the mirror... sigh... headache, need a break. Try try try.....

      Illusions. all illusions.  Vomit and kept vomiting. All I want is her standing beside me, give me a tap and say that all things are fine. Seeing her with that expression, giving me a hug, letting me know that she is there and everything will be fine. and she disappearsthe moment I reach out...  Still illusions.  I miss her so much...

      So lost...  First night without any alcohol and I kept dreaming about her. I thimk I prefer those times when I am dead drunk. I rather take the headache the next day then to keep waking up in the middle of the night by her. The racing heart never stops... takes centuries to go back to sleep only to be waken again be her telling me that it is all over.  I just have to be better so that shang can stop looking at me as a lesser being. Yet, it is so difficult. Smiling and telling him that everything is fine... Am I any better if the frequency increases? I just cant stop it. Wanted to be there so much for her... be next to her, accompany her thru this tough time. Just to tell her to breathe, dun freeze. Just too many pple are telling me that I am in depression. Have to buck up and show them that I am not.... or am I? So begin my path as the King of denial. Will I get better if she is back to my side? Maybe... at least she is here, someone to hold, touch and love...  The 2 dates that I have waiting for is coming closer by the day, yet knowing that she has all her programs planned left me in space again

      They were saying to go Holland V for lunch today… part of me wanted to go, get a chance to see her. The other part hesitated… will Marcus be there? They be loving together? Sometimes it is about letting the unknown be unknown…. Still love her.  Sad… so useless for a guy.  Cant stop smoking. Keep thinking of her. Dun think she ever thinks of me…  Escape! I am still escaping. I do not need this to carry on in my life... Hate what I am doing.  my little lamp bit me....

       I was with her the entire day.   When she was in the car, looking down the memory lane... I was there. When she walked up the slope, feeling tired... I was there. When she was agonised by the books... I was there. When she shuts the world by putting on the ear piece... I was there. When she poured some life into herself... I was also there. When she walks out that door... I was still there. Then it came to a halt. Does loving her from far needs to be there? She dun need me, someone else is by her side. Sighing... the other path is still waiting for me.

      Lies.. all lies. All these times, there are only lies. What is the truth? Who should I listen to? Listen to my heart? It aches so much that it shuts from within.  No one really knows what happened. There are so many versions being told. Thinking about it just kills more braincells.  How drunk are you? It is a matter of brain cells. Everytime you drink, you kill a million brain cells, dun worry you have zillions more. First, you kill all the unhappy cells... so you will have a real big smile. Next, you kill all the stupid cells... so whatever you say will be real smart. the quiet cells comes after... so everything you say is going to be real loud. Then the memory cells... those are the ones that you have to learn how to deal with... So how drunk is drunk?

       Brilliant words… or just things to pretend things are fine?    Sabrina:  You are just too strong in too many things, being superior than her.  Why dun you tell her that you are trying to learn how to blade, bringing her along, watch you fall, let her see your vulnerable side?  It is because Mu showed me his vulnerable side that I know he is not good in everything, he needs me too. You wanted to be perfect for her in everything and that will make her feel that she can demand more, and for this one time when you cannot give to her, she will just walk away, knowing that you are no good……   Sassy Gal:  …. You think she will feel pity for you? No.. It is easy to forget sadness. After sometime, you will not matter anymore….   Grace:  Just be there for her, go after her like how you went after me once, even when Alvin was there. Sometimes, knowing that you really did try to love… later love from afar… it will be more than enough. Someone better is out there waiting for you.   Weiliang:  At that time, you really sucks, really dun like you. Now can see how much you love her… too late, you never showed her enough… learn from your mistakes. Even if she is back, do you think she will return that love as much as last time? Love her from far… Heaven knows, if she comes back, you will know she is yours. So when can I see you stop smoking and drinking?   Jia Jia:  LIFE GOES ON! CHEERS!     MOst hurtful???   I was never happy with you for the past 2 years.   left him wondering about the times at his place, outings, chinese gardens and movies.... so many happy moments yet nothing to her?     Most sad   We are no longer a couple. Thank you for the time, but I am really beyond trying. Please be happy.   Shock him, stun for a moment.... dun know how to reply. Beg her? Plead with her? what? how to be happy?

      It is sad when someone you love does not love you in return. Sometimes you wonder if love needs any return if you have truly loved. Being loved is always something wonderful. So wonderful that people drift into a state of bliss and take it for granted at times. When it disappears, it will just be gone, suddenly, forever… and you will never recover from the lost.  This is the time you take whatever of the wonderful memories you had, picture that the person you loved will be smiling happily, the same smile that you have always love, knowing that she will be happy in that state without you… and you let her go. Waiting… patiently… hoping that she will once again remember who you are and come back to your side.   Chances are, she will not remember you because it is easier to forget the sad and unhappy moments. With you, it was sad for her… tiring. Like her, someday, you will forget that you have once been hurt. Live on! Remember those happy moments in the memory lane with her. And your heart stays with her till then……

        The Conversations:     her: I have written all our good moments in this book, so that one day if you decide to go back to her, I will show you what wonderful moments we had, I will ask you to stay. I cannot live without you.  Him: ... ... ... ...  Her (sad that he never reply): will you stay with me when I show you the book? (Showing concerns)  Him: ... ... ... ...  Her (Smiling and hug him): I know you will stay with me... you must... I cannot live without you. (Kiss)   she din know he dun have to pass him the book coz he will love her no matter whats. Even when times are tough, when there are lots of quarrels, when he is being selfish... he loves her, and she din know      Is this happening?   Him: what happened between you and your ex?  Her: nothing... just that he makes me cry nights after nights, not being there when I needed him, took me for granted.  Him: Do you still love him or miss him?  Her: Nay... you are the only one now... with him? we are not fated to be a couple. I will never go back to him... no matter what. So... you ar.. lucky one(tickling him), better learn how to treasure me.  Him (Laughing): Yes, love you forever... (hugs... kiss)  Him: Do you think he wants you back?  Her: I dun care... I only care about you now. I want him to leave me alone. I hope he can find someone he likes...  Hiim: Haha.. pity the next gal who is going to get mistreated, taken for granted...  Her (Laughing): eh... you are so bad. Whatever it is, I love you now, dun leave me. (HUg tightly, eyes closed and feeling loved)    The one that has taken place    After listening to him,   she: Cant you see that you really love her that much? He:  ... ... ... ... she: why dun you try hard and win her back?  he: There will never be this chance. She has been giving me too many, and I wasted all these moments. She say we will never be together again.  she: you took a long time to be with me when Alvin was there, why dun you just try? Just being there for her, you never know when she needs someone to be there.  he: I cant. She dun pick up my call, dun reply to the SMS, dun read the emails.... I dun know what else I can do.  she: just carry on... please dun be like that.. you are being unfair to everyone who loves you.  he: who cares anyway.... I dun..... all I want is her by my side now.  she(crying) : You know when you are doing this, you are not the person that I know, loved and care about? you dun deserve that love that I once given so much... all bcoz she is not there? If you love her.. stay there and wait for her.. be there when she needs someone. If you cannot be with her then learn to love her from afar... knowing that she is happy. Dun be like that please....  (after a long moment) he: Yah, I really loved her more than I was with you... sorry.... she: ya, I know... continue to love her... but you dun have to harm yourself. This is so sad when everyone knows... you dun have to be this...   he: I am sorry I disappointed you.... but I really love her... and it is very difficult to live without her. (pause) you dun have to listen to all these.... but I am trying.... just leave me alone for a moment.... dun tell me what to do, will appreciate if you are just here to listen to me as a friend. Just know that I love her a lot....  she: I know... (silence for a long time). Just be the normal self when she once love you... only then you can have the chance to be with her again.  he: thanks for being here all these year.... I know you dun want to listen to all these, I have been giving you enough problems. I need to be alone and scream once in a while.  she: k... please dun think of death.... it dun worth her love... friends love.... and you still have your mum to take care of.  he: sigh.... I really wanted her to be my wife... what happened? (Screams!!!!!!)

      This is the first night I am not out being drunk. Think I really love her... let her be happy. Dun let her see me like that...  So I really finish spending that bonus. I can actually drink for one whole month with that sum. Cant really but that ring for her now... wonder if she will even know that... well.... So the last thing that I wanted to buy is even beyond reach now. Should have told her long ago, why the surprises?  She dun like surprises yet I want to give her...  Love her not enough to share? Love her too much to hate? Just plainly love her... not being there, silence... She can be happy with him.  Watching Sassy gal... Cannon never seems so close. Dun know how to treasure it when the song is in the inbox... Dun know how to give her the flowers... walking into the class. Dun know how to spend time with her  Work work friends friends, in the end, they have their lives, achievement is something pple forgets. who matters is the one being with you, supporting you, buying you clothes when you are fat and ugly, getting you self baked cakes during anniversaries, buying you a pen when you dun have a presentable one, hugging you when you faced problems, smiling at you when you see her, being happy with you... trying to act happy even when she is sad...  Crying is often a better emotion outburst then drinking... I miss her but I will live a better life... becoz of her, of her love once....

      Dun dare to sleep, dun want to dream the same dream. Dun want to think, dun like that memory from that night.  I walk but I fear to walk into her with her love. I drive and I stop to look at the familiar cars to look at her passenger. I drink to escape and keep in memory of her. I smoke to calm the broken heart. I eat because I have to. I work only to remind myself how hard I have work her away.  I still love her... it still hurts.... it hurts so much... yet I cannot relieve this pain by being there. No more shit list.... my life is coming apart. Who is there to save me?  Going back 2 years to live her life. I dun like my life. Who cares what I do anyway?

      Wow... never knew that long I have been away. In fact, surprise that I still remember the password.  So, Shell has left me. Today marks one month of the break. Still feels that stupidity outside the camp the other day. Should not have just raise my voice at her... wondering if I will be kissing her on the forehead today. Did she leave coz I was really that lousy?  I think I also have enough of the depression. Counting back, wonder how many drunk sessions I had over the past month. K, today will be the last packet of smoke. Have to listen to the doc, wonder if it is really so serious as what he says. What do I do when I think of her now? Where to escape to?  So, I really love her so deeply... sad to know this when break ups occurs. What happen to me? I never take her for granted... but she always feels so...  Think I droppped in too deep of wanting to be with her... sigh.... all those visions of being together can vanish just like that.  Never know, cannot understand why she writes on line all those times... NOW I KNOW!

      The dinner ends really late. The last time I went for a wedding dinner I was busy SMS Shell at Fullerton. Flashes of what I always wanted to do during our wedding pops in. If she were to plan together with me, I think ours will be better then tonight, going by what I have in mind. Well... she's not around liao lah.  Too many weddings at Marina till I know how it is like. SUPER boring place, will NEVER hold my wedding there. I actually miss those times when we were going around collecting the wedding packages to compare... looking for a good place for our wedding. The only other stuff taht we din do was to try out the food at those restaurants... would want to do that again... The table makes up of interesting pple... all the couples plus 4 single guys. The 4 of us just kept talking about cars, proposing techniques and others lame stuff. Sigh... phone is not ringing the whole day again.  Coughing blood again just now. Cant breathe well, suffering throughout the wedding. There is just no air...  Should I take MC tml? Dun like being alone at home... haha... go to office and slack again. Very very tired now... just cant sleep, keep waking with flash back again. wonder if the number that I dreamt of last night will come out in 4D.  Sleep.... just need sleep...

      So, I have return... Being alone, no one to share the thoughts will bring to internet. Once again, I visit the few URL that I always visit. I guess Except for Shang, no one reads this now.  Yesterday was the wedding... Alone, lonely, never felt so dispair before in a wedding. So envious of being with the one that you love and say " I do"  Was at lost for words when they asked me about Shell last night. They have heard much about her yet she is no longer around. Smile and told them that we broke up was all I can offer.  Pats on the shoulder, words of consolation. I cant be sad... cant show them that I really treasure her, cant show them that I still miss her.... cant show them. In the mids of all the arguments that we had, those times that I have made her wait for me... I wanted to tell her how much I love her but I never did and yet today, she is with another guy. I have not showed her enough love, have not been the bf that I wanted myself to be...She hated it when she lives in Grace's shadow. I should have told her that it is her that matters and what has passed is the past. I still love her... still want to hug her close, be there for her, yet all she wants is for me to go back to Grace. All I want is to be with her...   This little ordeal has changed the 3 of us... Grace, hurt by me, finding strength in God, moving on with life again, encouraging me to go after Shell, so that I can be with her, being happy with the one I love, get out of my depression, even now she still says I am in depression, perhaps I am but I am not going to stay there long, in fact, I am getting out today. Me, hurt by Shell, finding the courage to live on with life, seeing her in every part of the path that I takes, thinking how nice it would have been if I have  a better bf for better for her, witnessing some of the stuff that has been going on wishing that we are the ones that are going through it, missing her in the nights... Shell, the only one who is happy as she has found that true happiness that she mentioned so many times.   Today, Shell neglected my calls and SMSes. Wanted to get angry with her... the outburst... the disappointment. A small voice rang and say... she is no longer your gf and is happy with the other guy. A sense of guilt came over me... if I wanted her to be happy, is this the way I approach her? I wanted to show her about Navy... wanted to share something with her again.  Ya, I guess she is right.. I have not got over her and I still love her. Someday, I will wake up and say that I dun miss her that much anymore as Shang puts it. Get out of it and continue to live life coz you are so much more than who you are rather then dwelling in self pity, Grace mentioned. Please live on with life, she might have come into your life and hurts you somewhat, know that the scar will never go away, know that you will no longer be the same person, know that loving her is not about possessing her, know that a lot of time is needed for healing but please dun hurt someone else in return just coz you are lonely, be a better man you know you are. If loving her from far is what you can offer then do it and be glad that she is happy, she will be happy that you have truely love her and that you are doing all you can to make her so... when she gets older, and she will appreciates you for who you are... who knows someday, she might just return... Joo Peng.  If this is what it is like when you are living without the love of your life, how have I mistreated Shell for this period. She said she never did love me all this time... but I did. I really did... I hope she will come into my arm someday, yet deep down I know that I am dreaming. Today, I will start to learn how to control my thoughts about her... smile and be better for her when she returns.  All the emotion roller coaster, in the end I am still alone... without Shell, without love.  The only handicap in life is the mental and emotional one that prevents you from participating in life ~ John Fobbes.

      Cant sleep last night, so I pen it down, guess might as well be here... somewhere I can return to in time to come.  It din go very well.... as expected.  Those words ring "Even after break up you are still doing this to me", "If I dun hate you then, I hate you now" She uses all sort of methods to make me take back the present. "Keep the present, if one day I am back to you, you can give it back to me". Deep inside, we both know that it takes a lot to be back where we were, it might never happen. Somehow, I just can bear to see those looks in her eyes and took it back... even I know that all those are just lies and emotion manipulation so that she can get me to do what she wants... What she din know was that every single pieces of it is full of memories, painstakingly putting it together, thinking of how life will be wonderful if we are there together. All I wanted was to give her a surprise, hiding it from her and that causes all the situation we are in today.  "The feeling is just different" " when you really love someone, you dun have to do anything, dun have to talk every night, just sitting with the person you will feel so happy, you wouldnt know the feeling" I din answer her, actually I do, else why am I just happy when she is just around me, without the need to do anything and always telling her that all we need to do is being here for each other? Why do I enjoy hugging her in front of the mirror... just want to hug her when she sleeps and be around when she wakes, the orange juice to accompany that sweet smile.  With one hug today, she lifted my spirit and brings me back to where I was 2 years ago, it is so nice to hug her... With the same hug, she brings me down to earth, feels that she is restricting herself and not wanting to give me another way to go about this.   With the present, I rather she throw it away... then to leave it as a memory for me... those sweet ones espicially. She gives me this little hope that she will be back... a coincidence was to hear the song "hao xin fen shou" as I walked passed my neighbour's home with the present. Bad omen! I guess sometime later, she is coming back to me and tell me, sorry, no way togehter...  I dun know what to do. I miss her... so much. All I hope for was that she gives me this opportunity to be with her again... give me another chance to shower her with love and receive hers in return... but reality hurts. Out the entire night, Felicia has her prob with Ben Ben, Yifang has hers with hubby. As I drift away in thoughts I imagine that Shell is beside me, beach was nice, breeze was cool, finished my pack, I should stop everything... Yet, she din know and feel how much I love and miss her all this while... maybe she knows yet... determined...  I Just love her... wanting her by my side... as long as she comes back and try.. sigh.  Guess I am trying very hard to accept... Stop blogging then...

      Judgement day is the last day stated in the Bible.  I always wonder how my funeral is going to be like, how many people is going to attend as a testimonial to my life. I wanted it be such that friends, whom I have touched along the way, will be there, each saying a statement or two about me, having soft rock, retro music with free flow of drinks. Coming to the end,everyone will raise their glasses and toast to me... for who I am. For what happened over the past months... I wonder how many would think it is worthwhile to see me for the last time.  Going to meet Shell later to pass her the present that I cherish much over the past month. Her birthday present. Guess might as well pass to her since she will not have any other slots free on her Bday. There was so much anticipation for this day. I was hoping that she would have been back as she had promised to play till her birthday, back to me after that. Yet, her love is long gone... Yesterday, she seems more interested in getting Grace by my side. She still din understand after all this while...  She states her life in the last entry. Missing out details of her love lives. She has been connecting to strangers, making more friends and enjoying life recently. I wonder if those are superficial, how much more she will go through before she finds something meaningful in life.  In Shell's format, some cherish moments to share...  16 years ago...  I took up Tae Kwon Do, Music appreciation (does not seems obvious now) Became class monitor, prefect, top my class, role model.  14 years ago... Know my first crush Got my black belt Head Prefect and Student Leader, school representation for various events Ace my PSLE, got into Victoria which I always wanted.  10 years ago... Became Council President. Went into international competition in TKD, dislocated my wrist by some Malaysia guy. Play for entire 2 years in SR. One of the 2 phrases of life I enjoy most.  7 years ago... Nearly died in Taiwan during Army training. #10 in Company during BMT, #6 in Company during BSLC, OCS interviews Top the class in ASLC, announced posting to OCS. 2nd of the class in Platoon Sergeant's course, announced posting to OCS Never really did cross over all this while...one of the regrets in life Still wondering what actually happened...   5 years ago... Retook "A"s and chose to go into Stansfield instead of NUS Arts. One of the bold choices I made to move away from the mainstream.  2 years ago... Got to know Shell, transformed my life forever. Graduated. Got lucky, went into HP, selected to be CSM in Army. The second happy phrase of my life. Everything seems to went great then... after the initial ordeal.  2 months ago... Darkest period of my entire 26 years of life. Everything that I have came to own disappears... It has been so since then.  2 days ago... Made a determined pact to live better. I can choose to miss her but never again in those ways.  Yesterday, Shell kept asking me to go back to Grace...  Today, I am going to pass Shell the last item that associates to our relationship. If it goes well, sparks might fly, else...   Tomorrow... in the time to come. Be the same old Chee Keong... be focus about life again. The world dun owe me anything.  I will try to stop blogging. Came here because I miss her... wanted to share a bit of my thoughts. Going back to the good old days when I peek into her life. Time and again, I can only think of her. Blog again when I can write about my life rather than her... else as Weiliang puts it, her blog is so interesting, abt her life, intro and everything. Yours only laments on how life is unfair and how much you want her back... GET A LIFE.  Getting one now....  THanks Shang, Sab and Weiliang... for the moments I need someone here. Pray that all goes well later. Cross fingers.

      Everyone hears what you say. Friends listen to what you say. Best friends listen to what you dun say.  I have lots to say, much more was not mentioned over the past 2 months. Million thanks to those who hears and listens to me.  Althought there are only 3 person in this world who knows my blog, 1 of the 3 reads it regularly, I would still want to thank all those people out there. Not very good with thanks and mushy stuff... so have to hush hush thank them here. haha  Found out that Shell is also reading this blog besides Shang. "when you start reading it? thought you cant remember my blog URL the last time I ask..." Now I know how come Shell gets to read my blog... coz Shang put it in his link. Hmm... went back to read what I have posted... wonder what I wrote back then.  Anyway, some missing jigsaw fell in place.  Shell got a new sony phone... hmm... guess should be T630. Getting better with life already, well, thats her.  When will my phone come? stupid services so slow... Should have just go down to their office nad make lots of noise. Services in Singapore ar.... hopeless...

      I am so tempted to pick up one more stick now. Wonder why I bother looking at her site anymore. Everytime I associate life with her, the heart race again. Meaningless life indeed.  Clubbing and pubbing seems meaningless one more time. It is like living through 20 one more time. When was the last time we club hop like this? Newsroom... The drinks are never going to get any better. Mdm Wong... crowded and boring music, meet lots of friends at least. Chinablack is still the same... MOS, the live band is somewhat better. Gui Pin, I am just too young being there. At times I amazed myself, just like tonight. Think I down more than 2 bottles just now. Wonder which idiot was it that keep opening new bottles. At least knowing the right people gets us in without the cover...  The loud music from those places managed to bring away some pain... lets in some joy... burning pockets. hahaha  I am still quite awake. Yet, I am searching for something. I need inner peace from within. Maybe I haven drink enough...

      There and many data and information in the heartdisk. WIth the new virus in the system, many of them are infected.  Do I format it so that I can start using the system again? Or do I live with what I have, ignore those virus prompt, and keep those precious information?  I should have maintain it with updated versions of virus definitions but I did not, coz it is costly and time consuming. Lots of regrets now that the system is going to crash anytime soon and those information are going to be gone forever.  Every single day, as and when I can, I am downloading and backing up the precious moments here. How much of it can I save before it crashes?  There are more and more virus every time I open the port connection. Should stop those connections so that there will not be additions to it... yet I cant help going there. It hurts more and more to see the hearware being infected with more virus threatening the OS, too many bad sectors that I cannot access.  Perhaps I should just change the heartdisk and get the information to load all over again... so many of the applications that I have to change, hassle. I still miss using the old ones... it might be slow, boring but at least it was customised.  Regrets... some cant even say that they have any regrets in their lives. I regret... coz I truely enjoy those moments with this system...

      Doubts about how I feel now.  Wondering if I should harness on the anger and disappointment to get it out of my life forever. There has definitely got to be more in life than to strive for short term high.  Wendy mentioned that she derives enjoyment from the challenge of getting someone to love her entirely. After she has obtained that love, with the novelty gone, she would want others to woo her, enjoying the moments of being a little princess. All to worship her, treating her nice. The sad thing is that most of the time, all these are superficial.  Yes, she did enjoy those superficial moments. When true loves comes, she doubts again. Not wanting to commit, not wanting to get hurt, not wanting to give it all... yet she hopes. Constantly telling herself, bad things dun happen twice.  Self talk again. The names and faces changes when each new relationship comes along but it is still the same person... until you change yourself. She changed... and that might be better for her.

      Sensed the hatred and annoyance in the message.  "Stop following me around la... just remember that I will not be with you with or without a bf, I rather be alone"  Nothing is clearer than this of being very determine. It was the same when I was going away from Wendy.  but wtf, it would have been justified if I am stalking her, following her around. Trying to let her live her life and just watching from afar... Like that also cannot? Cant talk?  I choose to hold on to my loving feeling.... but is that stupid?

      I think she enjoys where she is now. Esp when he is giving her surprises by showing up unexpectedly. Wonder what happens if I show up unexpectedly...  Dreamt of her for the past few nights. Remembering the nice time she was lying on top of me. Miss those cuddles and hugs. Flash back and more flash back... the images seems so real. As if she is right here with me now.  How do I get myself out of where I am now? Dun feel like working... hope to see her and chat like before. Ar.... I am just dreaming.  Should pack my life with many things such that I cant dream anymore.  Still dun like it the way it is now... Will she be back by her birthday?? haha... still dreaming. Dreamland and memory lane seems nice at the moment. King of denial... as shang affectionately put it.

      So... this is what it is like when you lose your ticket home. I am not coming home this weekend, shit, gonna miss the big walk and the chance to win that car.  Literally, when the organiser is gone, the first thing that I thought about was "what the heck was the program tomorrow? Shit.. all my contacts in India are in that book" The next thing on my mind was those stuff that I wrote and the dates to remember by... 800 days... 10th June... 100 days after break... Scare myself for a while, after which, I figured that I still remember all those dates even without the organiser... hmm.. inprint in me eh, most sad are the pictures in it... sigh... might be a good thing after all to lose them.  Wonder how she is now... never update her blog, stupid gal never pick up my phone. Must be busy with work and boy boy lah... How much is the phone bill going to be when I get home? Haha.. money again... wat a loser.  Can forget about meeting this week with her... next week going away... can forget again... before you know it, 10th June... shit.  OKie... guess going to cheong again this evening. At least I know I can hold my alcohol better than Moses... I can wake up this morning! haha...  Cant be quiet... think of her the moment there is nothing to do... kok Fi has to send me to more places... I wonder where else I can go...

      There are always reports on certain products being a good prevention for some diseases. My favourite is that wine, beer, liquor and chocolate helps to thin the blood and reduce heart attack. Does it when you are taking it in excess?  Too much of anything is not good for anyone. There is a need for moderation   Food aside, too much of thinking about something, someone causes health issues too. The notion of thoughts shaping a person is so true. It is not that I do not think about life, about relationships, about the present and the future. I guess I got stuck so deep in it that I am not moving in life.  I just need to learn the principle of moderation, thats all.

      Raca. What a word…. Another one of those being intoxicated by the exuberance of the verbosity things.  I wonder how many times I have been saying let go let God to myself Yet I am not able to do so.  I was waked by a nightmare this morning. I was there looking at her, holding her hands, asking her not to go. She pushed me off and ran over to him in her wedding dress. “I had enough, I am happy, why can’t you let go off me? What have I done to deserve this? Don’t you know you are very irritating?”, She was shouting at me. Have not been dreaming about her for sometime now. I wonder why I started dreaming about her again this morning. Subconscious? It got worse looking at her website, knowing that she is talking about marriage, kissing him endlessly.  Mind over matters! Be careful of what you inject into your mind, you mind affects your emotions, emotions dictates your actions and your actions is what others see and determine how big a man you are, how big is your heart.  I should stop everything that is associated with her. Stop thinking and my emotions and actions will change. Thought I have given up and let go over the past week. Being alone has somewhat brought me back to her. I hate being alone!  I heard this comment about me being someone who holds the past very close to the heart. Others look forward and I look back in time. Somehow or rather I always treasure the process rather than the results. It used to be a balance as I am always very clear about where I am going in life. Now I have been dwelling too much in the past that I am not moving forward. Wonder how much of it is true. It was really a lovely process with her but the results hurts too much  Headaches and more headaches. Not very happy with where I am without her. Learning to let go… I should when she don’t care. In a stage of overcoming now…  Few more hours to go… not really looking forward to traveling. I should be in US… or just being here where I am close...

Should I still change to corporate line?   5th Mar – Sabrina – 2321h Sometimes, its not abt who treat who badly.. relationship is abt give and take.. from an outsider view.. both of you are rather stubborn.. waiting for one another to give in.. up to you to believe wat I say.. giving in make things easier.  11th Mar – Dear Dear – 0148h I’m sorry… really sorry for all that has happened.

      Her mum came home first... standing outside the gate, waiting... Follow by her ... passed me in her little yellow car. Parked beside that bus which is always there. Carrying her loads of books, she walked pass me. She is in black T shirt and jeans. Stopping at the gate to fiddle with her keys. She finally found it and struggle with her books to open the gate. She stopped to wash her hands and shoes. Why is that? That was never her habit to do so...  I was there... taking a look. I should stop, stop thinking of her, stop everything and start living a life...

NOthing,,,,  Just want her to be back... then again, she is not happy with me,,,, that kind of a hatred for me... and she loves him... being with him....

      Aha... I found it. The kind of irritation that she feels when I starts calling her. Witness of a crazy fight this evening. Wonder how can someone throw their lives away like that. Then again, the pot calling the kettle black  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ You never close your eyes anymore when i kiss your lips. There's no tenderness like before in your finger tips. YOu're trying hard not to show it, baby. But baby, baby I know it.  You've lost that loving feeling... oh.. that loving feeling You've lost that loving feeling and now it's gone, gone, gone.... oh~  baby, baby, I beg you please... please.. I need your love... I need your love... Bring it on back... bring it on back. Bring back that loving feeling.. oh.. that loving feeling. Bring back that loving feeling.. oh .. that loving feeling ~~

      Dead Drunk last night, slept at the road side for God knows how long... Super hang over today... vomit and more vomit. Basically stone in the office the whole day.  Was I trying to prove anything? Should I live on with a better life and tell shell that I am still fine. The fact is she brought awaY A piece of my heart and pretend that nothing has happened.  Months or years down the road as I read these logs, I might be laughing at the stupidity. I might still be crying. I might never be here. Yet, I do know I really love her and she really broke my heart for it. So Charissa has said it, I am glad that both you and me are happy... happy and feeling contented.  Sigh, she can have this kind of a mentality whereby she is not hopiong for much, why cant she sticks around when things are finally showing the bright sunshine down our path?  I  should really be sleeping, but I cant... what should I do? I turn around I see her.. I close my eyes I see her. I dun show it. To others they see that I am recovering but deep down, who can I go to? Shell never understands this.... she's is the best I have got now... I wanted her so much.

       An old Cherokee is teaching his grandson about life. "A fight is going on inside me," he said to the boy. "It is a terrible fight between two wolves.  "One is evil - he is anger, envy, sorrow, greed, regret, lies, self-pity, arrogance, guilt, resentment, inferiority, false pride, superiority and ego.  "The other is good - he is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion and faith.  "This same fight is going on inside you -- and inside every other person, too."  The grandson thought for a minute and then asked his grandfather, "Which wolf will win?"  The old Cherokee replied, "The one you feed."   Which one are you guys feeding? I guess I am feeding the one which tells me to love Michelle. Surprising for me, coz sometime ago I really set down my mind and say "hey! it's over! WAKE UP!" I never really got over... I think another year may do the work. Might be faster if someone nice loves me lots. Hey, introduce gals to me! Sounds like a big desperate rebound... haha

      You mind, the Unlimited Power. You have the choice to choose the state you are in. Becoming successful is simply about modeling those who are already successful, depending on what you deem is success in life. Knowing what is in the person’s mind, the self talk and the actions taken is a basis of modeling after him. Cast out the negativity in you by gaining awareness of you own self talk and the image of the goals you want.  The images are either associated or disassociated. An associated image is what one which you experience it thru your own eyes as if you are actually there in person. A disassociated image is one which is like watching a movie of yourself. Which is a more intense experience?  Initially when I was with Shell, the images of us being together were mostly disassociated. I was there… directing and hoping how things will turn out. I always manage to change my response to her in these images and   As we progress in the relationship, I was thinking about marrying her, the images of our wedding were all associated. I was right there and then… proposing to her, seeing her smiles, looking at her as she walks down the isle… picturing the life we would be having. Always wake up with a smile, hoping and praying that time will fly faster, she will get older and we can go thru it soon… so wonderful.  When the break-up came, the images were also associated. She was there saying “NO NO NO” cant sleep, racing heart, feeling out of breathe.  As time past, the images came to disassociated, that she was with her new boyfriend, watching them doing the things that I wanted to do with her… those images I had before. Always manipulating the images. Hoping that she will be back by my side somehow.  By now, should have figure that associated images are more intense. It is more real. Yesterday, I gain the awareness that images can be tune to associated to gain power and strength to reach you goals.  Thru series of exercises, I know that I am still in love with Shell… the images about her recently are all associated. Sometimes I wonder if this is the way love is… perhaps it is just lust, infatuation or plain regrets. Love should be happy. Love is a feeling.  Tune my images and perhaps life will be better.

      Read this off a post card and copy it down today.   The Times I have with you is Very Special To Reach out To you and Know you'll Be there -  That means the world to me.  My Heart is with you wherever you go, my love is yours no matter what. When you smile at me, I know it's from your Heart.  I know you'll do for me what no one else would do. And if I don't tell you I love you As often as I should.... It's because I Hope that, Deep Down Inside, You know I Do.   This came a bit too late... I think it probably might have work somehow. Well... this words still stands. if only... Who ever came up with ideas to print all those words on postcards and posters? Should have just do it earlier since I have got all those qoutes all the while. Procastinating!  Laughed at myself for being me after I read it and think about how it would have been   - Zero Romance and creativity -   Thats what makes me special. Brainless... Lolz.

      bLOGging has become a mini part of my life. This is a place where I can connect and scream.. complain and everything else. It used to be paper and pen... perhaps being online can allow me to retreive easily knowing that one day system might crash, everything will be erase and life can begin again.  Close friends managed to take a look at how I am, emotionally, feelings, inner thoughts. A good get away from reality at times, knowing that you cant share everything to everyone... yet, you wish that someone close, who cares, hears what you do not say and be there for you.  Over this past few months, I peek into people's life, watched how they overcome the obstacles in their lives, sharing part of their joy... love lives, family, little thoughts and others. A part of me feel so close to them, yet I do not know who they are. Someday, opportunity might present itself for us to connect, someday...  Chrissa, Dionne, Xinwen, Peixi, Shuxin and Shang were there on the list all the time... there are also others who pop in once in a while. Realised that aqua-aura has gone all the while to the bottom listing now. It is one thing knowing how things are, people being happy. It is another knowing about their intimate sexual lives... I dun need to know all those, too painful just knowing that they are... I think couples gotta get physically intimate eventually in order to move on into next phrase of relationship... sad... the heart just start to race. One of these days, I am bound to get heart attack going by this rate.  Ever felt the bounding of the heart, chest tight, difficult in breathing, hands turn cold? Shall stop vouyering... I think can still look into Shang's page. He is the only one who post events and frustrating moments. SOmetimes, provocative topics which are worth discussions. So Shang, if you are reading this... better feel honoured over the compliments... coz I know you are the one of the 3 person who are reading my blog today. The other 2 will just nag me off the drinking sessions. So guys, grab me out for a drink... think I need one now. Sigh... and I thought life is getting better, sometimes, something just never fades away.

      "What you fear is often the most worthwhile experience that you will ever have" I fear... and I know. Hiding too long in the fear. Coming out of it since the window of opportunity has passed. Fear is False Elusion Appears Real Matter of mind over other things. If only opportunity presents itself again...    On my own, I feel so all alone... though I know it's true I'm still in love with you. I need a miracle, I wanna be your gal, give me a chance to see that you are made for me. I need a miracle, please let me be your gal, one day you'll see it can happen to me, It can happen to me....   And it rings and rings.... Dun want to work this evening. What I need is another short term high.

      Wow... it hit again.  Saw her pic change right before my eyes. Guess she is online now. Must have been a great birthday for her. Should be the one that she is with her boyfriend. Nice cake. Overnight at chalet? Memories and more memories.  God, she look so beautiful. Why am I not the one? Argh.. and it hits again. Miss her so much.  What the heck am I doing? Wish her luck and move......

      Been crazy these few days. Work, drink, sleep... and work again. Crazy days!  Thought I saw Shell at Starlight. Nay.. should be the wrong person, as long as I am able to walk away I am fine. So many couples... maybe should not have taken up the job in the first place. Well... 3 more weeks to go.  It is nice to have the WRX. Quite a ride. And I thought I am the only crazy one to drive fast. What should I do with the money clocked in? Should get a new car?.. hmm.. perhaps should really get one WRX? Should just go for the tour that I wanted for so long...   I hate to remember those dreams nowadays, those life long wishes, every single picture has her in it. Everytime I see her, that image just came back. Hate to do mental talk. Everyone has got to move on sometime... Am I the one destroying my own life or is she the one destroying me? No matter what, I allowed the thoughts to do so... always going back to the basic in learning, knowing is one thing, doing it is another.   How is it possible that after what she has done I still have feelings for her... I hope one day I can start to hate her... hate her for being selfish... hate for for going off... hate her for breaking all those promises... Yet, that is so childish. Dun think I can ever hate her... just gotta let time heal. Jia Jia finally came to the stage where she dun want to marry him, not that she dun love him, just waiting for him to be ready... 3 years she said. Would love in absence last more than that? Will I still miss her after 3 years? Well... as long as I am out of her presence in every part of her life, she is happy... do it!  So tired... should take a break from starlight tml. With hundreds and thousand changing hands every single night from Euro... no wonder people stop work to analyse football. With that little winning... temping to continue. Jia Jia is correct... I am no longer that same Chee Keong that I was 3 months ago... neither is she.  It is so good learning to be bad... living a wrong life before this. I need more than just a short term high. It is just a new beginning...

      " In my perspective, Leadership is from the heart - reading books are for reinforcement. many people are given the title of people manager but they are not ready. Are you ready? "   A question I never expected... pondering, does it mean that I am not good enough for the job or opening a new opportunity for me. I wonder... The structure keeps changing, people keep moving, roles keep getting bigger... managing 2 teams is already there for me. Perhaps I need a change of enviornment. Get out of HP to take a look elsewhere... since there are already so many changes, whats one more change in my life?  Dun know where I am heading... lost of vision. Where's the end point? Envision too much about having a family... Career goal? being encircle by that big vision of family...  Think better settle my thinking and thoughts first. Definitely not now....   Change

      Going to part time at movie-in-the-park again. Being there so many times, there was only one time that I was there with her... wat show was that? How to lose a guy in 10 days? Sweet…. Sigh, some people can overcome all sort of adversity and move towards the path of living together. Some just break up for the smallest tiff… long build ups, I guess.   The best thing out of part-timing is having something to do, get money & T shirts, watch free movies and maybe I’ll get to know some pretty gals who share the same interest. Then again… which idiot pays $12 to watch movie in park alone? Open mind…. God says seek and you shall find… let’s see who can find me. The bad thing is that it is another of those little memories... nay, control your thoughts and your actions will being you through. Will definitely enjoy the company of the gang again, hopefully it will be so pack that no chance to think... must have lots of pretty gals.   These 2 days just stuck into so many things. I think I am still far away from being a manager... was never sensitive to the numbers. Look at those blue, black and red. Wonder how I ever ace my accounts... I need more subordinates to deligate the workload.  Be, Do, Have... why do I always forget about the simple stuff. Sigh...

How many of them did you share With opportunity and date Again where you so often missed?  We do not find you on the list of Makers Good Explain the Fact! Ah, no 'twas no the chance you lacked As usual - YOU FAIL TO ACT!  Wonder how the most amazing note appear before you when you are thinking of one? Fail to act... many thing happened this year and its not even the end of June yet. Need time machine to go back to 1st March 2002 or 4th March 2004... its a sliding door.

      Weekend was spend in hospital. Darn those doctors... think they are just thinking of earning more cash asking me to stay there.  Must have shock people when vomit blood and pass out just like that. Din really pass out... I can hear the people, I just cant response. Spots in the vision. Suspect on minor concussion. Think that was from the accident, never did remember I hit my head. CT scan, pills, rest and stay for observation... 2 more days MC. So... thats what having a concussion feels like. Never know it can affect after 1 day.. thought the effect is usually immediate. Hate wearing bandage on the head, look like Rambo initially, after a while, it is plain hassle.  Passed the 100th-day break-up on the bed. 12th June... 10th June... all in June. Kept thinking about her.. about that night. Thats why it is bad to be alone. It really seems like an out of body experience looking at her talking to him. Living in the past again... She scream, cry, sad, angry, smile, cajole and happy again. Seeing her go through the emotional roller coaster, wanted so much to hug her and tell her it is ok, it is fine.... So Real! It was like looking at her talking to me... last time. Ah.. so she never did really change. It is still the same her in this relationship.  I think he is going through what I went through back then... the questioning.. the struggle between love and being there. I guess the whole lot of difference between me and him was that I am working and was still spending time with friends in such that I never really had a lot of time with her. Being with her is always home home home... anyone would be sick of it. He on other hand make the effort of being with her.. make her feel love. Was his love any different from mine? I guess none... The root cause? We started on the wrong footing with me, her and Grace. BIG LESSON!  The secondary cause is the willingness to give... I think I was holding back too much. As I am ready to give, she is no longer willing to take. Planning to much for the future, thinking too much about the past, missing out the present. BIG LESSON 2!  Lastly, proactiveness. She is always waiting for me to do this... waiting for me to do that. Different point of focus. Again, too self centered. Wanted to complete a bit more in career before I can give her a ring... well... love needs to be consistent showering of care, ACTIONs... BIG ONE AGAIN>>  Dun know how long she will stay with him. Going by how much I have heard on Sat, I think things will go a big circle and come back to where both of us went through... that is if she dun change certain behaviour. For her, boyfriends come and go, they wear different clothes, have different names, the faces are different but it is always the same person coz she never change. She projects her expecatation onto her boyfriends and eventually they turn out to be the same person. He is so like me back then... the diff? Feelings... but the ending point? SAME.  Wenlong asked, after what happened that night... do I still feel the same? I din answer then but I know it deep down. I dun know...and I dun dare. I think a part of me went dead when she did that. As Grace put it... she will always be that unique gal in you.   Gotta move on... Need to think about Bills. All those darn bills... sigh. What happens when lying on the bed listening to people moaning... your imagination runs wild. Nay... I'll just hold those memories close to heart and smile...

      Yesterday was the most eventful day in my entire life. First was the episode at St Nick.. early in the day. How it turn out to be... Beyond description. There is definitely a better way to communicate. Else there can be a mature way in handling of the matter. Either way, that was the way she chose to present the affection towards him, the irritation that I am presenting. A bit dramatic. The whole drama was like watching her talking to me in the past... so familiar and loving. I would need to learn to control my emotions and temper. No emotions now... love, yet not that intense. Hate, yet cant bear to. Sad, yet too tiring. Just been too long...  Really thought I am dead when the car flipped. It seems like there are so many things in my mind. Not exactly the entire life flash by, a lot of the flash back of what she said to me over the 2 years, what we have done, those happy moments, sad one... everything. It just flash by... I guess what people always mention about when you are going to die, the so called "life" that appears before you is what you have been thinking about for a long time. We both have changed. Would need to find time to do a full check up, still hurts. What is more painful is the car payment. Sigh... in debt one more time. Wonder how much the insurance is going to pay.   Bugis shopping in the evening was like going back to the past. Althought would really like to do it in another method... nevertheless, surprise to meet all the old friends. So many pple are settling down. I guess I am still me, able to meet someone, somewhere as long as I am inside the shopping center.   The gathering with the ASLC group was less than the initial excitement. Not as many people as I thought it to be, still, it was fun to see them. When was the last time we met? Since the posting at Pasir Laba? Everyone grew fat... many with the characteristics that will never change. A bit on the surprise side when the group always remember me as the best trainee... and expected me to do well in life. I guess when someone excels at one point of his life, others will expect him to be smooth sailing all the way... So many people broke up with the gf they had back in SISPEC. Part and parcel of life... if someone like Poh can survive without Jessie, I would be doing as well as him.  Experiencing a bit of the single life that I so wanted when I was attached. Always hoping for that little breather space so that I can still do what I want... alone... with some peace and not to worry about gf. Now that I have it... feels weird that there is no one to share that kind of excitment when I see something nice. Shopping has always been of buying something for her... thinking how it would be nice... yet I can hold on and not buy anything during then. Nowadays can just spend without thinking. I have been thinking and planning to much for the future that I miss out the present. Need to curb spending again... sigh... hate it when I have to watch my spending.  Mindset determines EVERYTHING. I think... therefore I am. Today, is the changing point in my life.

      Yesterday was the limit of the build up. Cant stand it anymore, SMS her again. Ya, she is ignoring me.. TOTALLY.  Got a tight slap from Wenlong... He took years to overcome Claris, but I've only reached my 100 days. He was at her place watching her for 9 months, I've managed to control it within 1. He kept calling her for 1 year, I'm only doing it for 2 months. He drinks and get drunk till today, I've only just begun. He drives and get away at 190kph, I'm only doing it at 160. He wasted away 4 years waiting for her to come back... begin to feel a bit endless. He went around and sex with countless gals, I am still holding on to her image...  For all that he went thru, he slam me against that stupid wall. Everything that he talked about, I only registed what happened to his sis and him letting go...  " Disappear from her life so that she can live one. Let her be without you and be happy. Should you suffer in the process just let it be... coz keeping in mind that she is happy... If she does return one day, she is really yours. If she dun, there are still chance as friends. Else, how afraid she will be... of you. BUt face it, GUoxian's relationship are not like ours. When it happens, they will not be back... accept it. If she does... you have my blessings. "  hmm.... haven I disappear now? She didnt see me, she's happy with her bf, she is living a life... I just seeking some sort of a small comfort, for that my head still hurts till now? Shit!

      Stupid Gio went around started asking pple if they are still virgin. I think she is getting high on finally able to have a piece of paper to state that it is alright to have wild sex.  No matter how you answer, you are stuck. Worse when Shell's pic is on my table... haha Well... a little memories here and there.  Lance being the most innocent within the group gave the most obvious answer. While not wanting to state anything, he did get snook when being questioned on the last time he was doing it with gf. No wonder he is the only one who do not front the customers in the entire dept, cant handle impromtu.  This is what happens when Boss is not around. Sex talks openly in office... everyone so hype up about it. Whats with virginity nowadays... as if you can still get some virgin out there. Too many pple too early ar... only old pple like us care to talk about it. lol  Cold and rainy morning. Miss those times in bed.... I need a hug... cuddle and cacoon.  Nice weather to slack...

      3 months ago...  ~I was obsessed with money making. ~Working hard with 2 part time jobs. ~Reading shares and investments. ~Read Money in Straits Time. ~Super busy, late nights, long days. ~Sleep real easy. ~Past time is to clean up the house, keep things in place, watch movie/TV. ~Listen to investment and Self improvement CD on bus trips. ~Easily excited about Army and reservist. ~planning for future and stuff to do at the end of the year with Shell. ~Happy being with Michelle, totally contented, and loving her the most.  3 months later... TODAY.  ~Money dun mean much, except as a means of what you want to do. No money? dun do it... ~Only working in HP. ~Read.. nothing for a long time. Pick up a lifestyle book over the week end.. suppose I will still read it. ~Lost touch with the world for a long time, forget about the newspapers. ~Loads of time... nothing to do. ~Past time now, pubs and clubs. ~Listen to the Shell special that represented us for a long time. Today is the only day without any earphones in my ears... Cannon in D just drifted in. Wonder why that rythme ever pop in when I have not been listening to it even when Shell was around... brings memories. ~Army? whatever lah... ~Planning? Whats there to plan anyway... things just foul up. When you fail to plan, you plan to fail? Nay.. Either way, Murphy Committee will be there for me. ~Michelle, no longer around. Yet ya... still love her but slightly different from that moment of passionately wild. Not really contented with where I am, think lots of regrets...  I thought that Shell leaves me at the time when I love her the most. Then again, when you lost someone, is there any extension on how much you love a person? It is that I have been loving her enough throughout the relationship. The willingness to give everything from me came too late for her... Life simply came apart without her... became a bit dependent on her, never did realise.  For a long time, I was thinking about if she comes back... then how nice it would be... what we can do... I would want to show her this, show her that.. give her this, give her that... can be here, there, everywhere. Tell others how happy we can be... EVERY SINGLE TIME, reality hits hard. Well... if she did come back. 2 more days to her birthday...  "*-*)/

      An interesting lunch discussion. It started off with me not having a gf and they were "guiding" me on the places to go. So if it comes, it comes... I dun seek. Just seeking that gal for the moment.  I wonder how that ever veered off to Singapore men. "hopeless", "not global", "bounded by rules", "MCP" Wow... so most gals are not even considering Singapore guys. Sadly, I am in the number. So they say, I am still fine as a friend... no idea how I would be like when I am a bf... no one is interested to try anyway. Talk about dichotomy.  Need some self reflection should I seek someone as partner now. For the moment, Shell still lingers here and there. Cant sleep this morning. Today's dream seems more real than any others. I should live life, sit back, relax and enjoy. Treasure the past and enjoy those moments that we had... there are so many things that I have not done yet. Next time shall not picture life with gf... you think about too many things that you have flash backs everywhere. DArn....  Like Willy... if you get sex, you do... if you dun get sex, try soccer. Typical Singapore men. Thank Willy for making their point. Stupid Discussion~!

      Simply No MOOD TO WORK.  I think I am being overloaded. Not enough sleep. Going into sleep deprivation. Brains not working. How to look at those figures? Who compiles 2 years reports into trends data? Top it all, that stupid gal never reply. She changed number or plain ignoring? Either way... I CAN CHOOSE TO LIVE A BETTER LIFE!  Need a break... Need a Drink... Need to overcome... Need to let go... Need to persevere... Need to strike TOTO...  Want my Car... Want my Shell... Hmm... I think these 2 enough to make me very happy liao. I want to watch Harry Potter with her... want to bring her out for a nice dinner... want to spend time with her all in my White Lancer.  It is by going through a crisis thats when you really discover what kind of a person you really are. True love is hard to find ar...

      Everything that can go wrong will go wrong, often at the worst moment. Everything went wrong for me today. Got lots of scolding this morning…  With 300 plus mails to clear, mostly needed attention, wonder why pple needed my approval to do so many things. Dun they have brains on what to do? As if I haven had enough problems. Stressed by idiots. Haven do this, haven do that… Needed someone to talk to… wanted to love and cuddle Shell.   She din reply to my invite, the only short opportunity to look at her is thru the MSN when she comes online. At her lovely, smiling pic… Someday, it is going to change to the bf and her…Yah, She is here now, online, yet so distant. Can control not to type her any stuff… not when she is still trying to get the love of her life… She will be going off soon, soon to her work. And another day for me again.  Love is interesting. You can come to all sorts of extend to take any nonsense or pain there is just coz you love the person. Sometime ago, read that love is about …. The last few lines are about the kind of love. Paraphrasing it, the best kind of love are those which are reciprocal. The worst are those that the person you love does not love you. Either way, enjoy the process of love, whether it is lovely or painful because love might never come again in that kind of magnitude.  Today, I can stop msg her… I can smile by having a make believe that she is happy with the guy… Yah, I should be alright. Enjoying loving her, even when it is not like before. She is right, the feeling is not the same anymore, so no point being together. Still, I love her, from a different sense.  Thinking of her elevates a moment of agony from the idiots at work, insensitive ungrateful people. Makes me smile a moment from memory lane. She is no longer around. Perhaps I should just place her pic back onto my desk and smile till one day when she is back or another gal pop into my life.  Stressed…. At work… at home… with myself… with Shell. Life just came apart the moment she is gone. Sigh… regrets!

      Yesterday was boring. Sitting at the booth finding things to do. Time pass by so slow... went late night again. So, drinking does brinks her back once in a while. Should stop going to pubs... as if I am so rich, even with the amount of cash on hand now, one day it is going to dry up again. Hmmm.... wonder who I puke on.  Today, was nice. Althought with the hang over, work is still nice. Busy Busy Busy... I beginning to believe that I am actually a workaholic... I need things to occupy my life, pack it so tight that I have no time to think of other things but what is there right then.  It was nice to drink with Sab and Mu just now. This Mu kept touching Sab... doesnt he knows that I am all alone now??? Hahaha... It was still good to see both of them so loving, was that was Shell wanted? Nay, I am not Mu, cant be so physical in public, a little hug and kiss is fine with others around but not the stuns of touching here and there like Mu. >_  Why am I up now? Coz she fades into my mind again... Mu asked, will you still take her back? Yah, if she is willing... he shakes his head and smile. What was that suppose to mean? Sab was saying that I just love her too much... Is it really that? I didnt want to show them that. More of wanted to show the me which has moved on... the me which is better... the me which enjoys work and has a life even when I am alone. There are many things to do, to be better, if she did come back.  Sab did mention that I look as if I can face the fact now. I did. I am at "letting it go". At least I know she is happy and so long she is happy. The article keep coming back about there are 4 person you will meet... You, The person who love you most, The person who you love most and the one you are going to marry. Yah, Seldom the person you love most is the one you are going to marry.. quite sad. Should always marry the person you love most... sigh.... time will heal all wounds, someday, I will stop dreaming about her.. someday, I will think of her as a very nice experience to have... someday.  Realised I still love her but somehow it is not the same kind of love that I had before. Not wanting her to be around all the time or knowing her every move... somedays I imagine that she is still my gal and she is out with her friends, happy, laughing and enjoying. That little moment feels to good and smiles... Yah, I love her but I can let her go now... can let her have all the things that she wants when she is happy. Amazed at how fast this changes the moment you set your mind to do it. So I did title this page correctly, Power of the mind, If you think you can... YOU CAN!   I have too many things to rattle today, have not talk enough, one bad thing of being alone is having no one to share your thoughts, no one to tell the story to, no one to live your life with you. So... who is the next in my life to go thru this? Have to start praying about it... Have this little urge to go to church, listen to Hymns, feel peaceful again. The training starts in less than 4 hours... think I am going to sleep thru the lectures again...   I have to sleep the entire day and not think of anything, speculating too much. Should I start looking at the shares again? Still feel like vomit now, think I ate too much at the fair. Can feel the headache coming... maybe its this stupid notebook. How to earn more money now, haha, actually feel the need for money so that I can go to pubs and relax for a while... Still dun really like my life but at least I can sleep a bit now... Yawnz,,, should try and not dream of her. Haha.... Living a life now, Happier that she is happy.

      Why is it that love is usually associated with Heart since it is the mind that perceive love?  I know why people always mention about being heartbroken, heartaches... You think of the person whom you love, think about some of the stuff that person has done or is going to do which you hope did not and your heart race away at an amazing speed. It comes to a stage where you actually feels the pain in your chest... at your heart..   You take a break... breathe in deeply... control your thoughts... things might come back normal, sometimes it dun. Yet, the pain never goes away coz your heart has been pounding so hard for so long that you can hear it... feeling the pain. Ouch! Hate those dreams...

      Today... I realised that I have come to another stage of my life.  Success is a process. You decide on what you want, analyse the cost that you are willing to pay to get to there, pay the price and move towards it. I was not willing to pay any price when I was with her...thinking that all of our path is suppose to be mutual, that she is understanding to know the condition I was going through... I paid my price! The other way, walking the other path. Knowing that she will not be here anymore. Somehow this sinks in better now... I am willing to pay my price now, so long she comes home. (-_-) Nah... she's too stubborn...  Shrek was nice. Sweet. Loving. Would haVe been better if I am watching it with the correct person. Shop alone after the show... some memory lane to pass. The book was right. If you do not overcome your inner self, you are very unlikely to move on with life, experiencing the joy of other things that might there.   Totally no mood to shop today... Stepped into MPH. Somehow, with those books, it brought me back to the time I was alone again... browsing, reading, enjoy a moment of peace. A part of me drifted away... Yet there was a need to make consious effort to stay focus everytime I find something interesting... wanting to share.  The evening was rather enjoyable with Sabrina and Kevin. Cant say the same about the food. She thought I have gotten over Shell... He is still harping over Luana. Haha... what the batch of 84 has done to us. She was wondering how long will Shell stay happy without me... hehe... rather long I guess, without the need to cry and wait. People change when love changes... Change is the only constant in life.  Will see the gang tml. Hmm... I wonder if I should join the guys for the drink tml night. Else get them away from Introbar, wonder why pple like to hang around there. I would, if I'm with gf, but not a bunch of fat old guys... Still very sick, those antibiotics are not working. Shall go complain to the doc in the morning.  Tomorrow will begin another phrase of life...  Must sleep. The stupid Bio clock going wild now.

      I CANT SLEEP!!!  Either I slept too much in the day or its those thoughts that are bothering me. Racing heart... cold limbs. Why am I returning to this time and again? I so desperately need to move on and get some sleep.  Nothing on TV, Fingers numb from the Guitar, Radio dun sound nice, cant do anything that is loud, no one to talk to... I can only come to this space to breathe a bit more.  Surely there are more things to do then to lie in bed and dream.  Hmm... lets try some stuff more lame now..  The wants:  Digital Cam, Canon F75. Been looking at it since God knows when.  CAR!! I want my Mitsubishi... Evo, Subaru WRX. Else it will be Honda Civics Type R.  House, always wanted to have a landed property. Nay, since been with SHell wanted something simple, 5 Rm executive with walk in woredrop would be nice...  NEW HANDPHONE.. this stupid handphone that indirectly causes my break up.. coz no communications.. when is M1 delivering my new phone? SUPER SLOW SERVICE.  Track Shoes, ran too much recently, some sort of a get away, so much that the shoe is coming apart, need shoes to run.  NEW PC, these laptops are slow... Broadband, can download things a bit faster, but wonder if I really needed that since I spend more time in office now.  Endless cash so that I can go out constantly.. dun like home now, not when there is no one to talk to at night.  Some new clothes...   TOUR... I want to go London...  sigh.. too many parts of my life is being planned with SHell in it... maybe I dun really want to go London, at least not alone...  I still want to sleep.... peacefully... without the need from medication... no need to wake up in the middle of the night from nightmares... I want to sleep and wake up with smiles... even I know things are not the same.... I just want to sleep peacefully... how???

      784533...  Fate: It has to be a feeling whereby it is mutual. It would not be fate if the two dun love each other.   It is worse when only one party is in love. The one in love tries to hold on tight to whatever it is, the other terrified and irritated to be there... this is what they call pain.  Love is.... a kind of feeling. Some came from nowhere and they found each other. Others can be right in front of you and the connection is just not there.  I hope there will no longer be any pains in this world. Let those who dare to love receive their love in return.  In pain...

      Have not been lying in bed for so long now... Cant even remember the last time I was sleeping in my bed, been bunking too long in the living room, dazing on how life would have been... self denials and things like that. Bed is nice, but it brings memories back... as soon as I am sober, I have to get out from it.  Those antibiotics are killing me. Which doc actully prescibe 3 types of antibiotics? Either my lungs are failing me or I am suffering from love sick till I cant breathe. Feel so choke... Need Air...  Went out to pub last night. Glad to see the whole gang there again after the wedding. So, everyone wants to hear wat happens bet me and Shell. I think I have been telling the story so many times that in sinks into me that she is not coming back... Guan commented that I dun look as charming as before... haha... even challenge me to get the number from those gals. Was dead drunk by 4, I guess... I can remember getting into the cab. But cant remember who paid for all the drinks. Must have cost a bomb, think we down a bottle each. Good thing I wasnt driving last night. My alcohol intake level seems to have drop drastically, used to be able to take a lot more than just that one bottle... neat.  Had some sweet dreams for these 2 days while sick. Weird dreams actually... I actually dream of how our marriage was like. Shell was just stunning in the wedding gown. Another was us shopping together, and I was buying her stuff, expensive ones (Cant imagine I do that), The best one was buying her a ring at Steffany's... she was grinning and really happy.  Hmm... wonder why all the sad dreams has suddenly change to all these. Well, perhaps I am facing the fact and coming to face a part of what I have always wanted to do for her, with her...  Very bad hang over... wonder was it the drinks or the medicine. No one to call when being awake... Wonder how she is doing now. Must have gone out with boyfriend on this holiday...   Going to watch Shrek2 tml... company sponsored. Quite useless to have all the tickets and no one that I can invite. Which idoit company gives tickets on a weekday noon to watch the show?    Hate the cigrette smell now... taste blood when coughing. Many times I was saying that I should quit yet I wasnt able... not when I am still thinking of her. I should be able to do so now that I dun like it... now that health became an issue... now that the feeling is lost... now that I start dreaming good stuff abt her... Wonder how the X ray turns out this time.

       I'll make you smile whenever you're sad.    Carry you around when your arteritis is bad.    All I wanna do is grow old with you.     &nbsp;   I'll get your medicine when your tummy aches.    Build you a fire if the furnace breaks.    It could be so nice, growing old with you.     &nbsp;   I'll miss you, kiss you,    give you my coat when you are cold    need you, feed you,    even let you hold the remote control.     &nbsp;   So, let me do the dishes in our kitchen sink,    which would have been when you had too much to drink.    Oh, I could be the man who grows old with you...    I wanna grow old with you.     &nbsp;  All I want is to grow old with you...

      I was ecstatic when I saw your name on the sms. I thought you are getting back to me on those questions that I have been asking. I wanted to follow up with you on the laptop, drinks and such. I thought we can talk, chat or go out again. Never did I expect the outburst from you.  I cannot understand why the outburst when I am updating my blog. There are not many readers, at least I know none of your friends are reading them. Why are you concern?  I cannot understand why you are not willing to declare that you are with Marcus. Why hide the relationship when you happy with him? If you said that it is not him… why not declare it even more?  I cannot understand why you’d rather die than to talk to me again. I can understand about being uncomfortable, but die? At least I know you will not commit suicide, you are not that type. And this is not a challenge, so dun even bother.  I cannot understand why you are upset when someone is in love with you. You have your choice not to love me but as you said love is a feeling…  How do you stop someone from loving you?  I dun understand what I have done to cause the hatred. Hate me for loving you? Hate me for putting my little thoughts on the blog?  Hate me for talking to Sabrina and Kelvin when I cant even remember when was the last time we talked about you? It was so long ago…   There are so many things I dun understand.  You are right, beggers cant be chooser. But I know I followed my heart. It is stupid but I choose the path that I am taking. Watching you being with Marcus… Being Stupid! But I did try… you remember when you had your regrets during that moment in the case of Eugene and praise that you are with someone better? Why not let me have my chance? At least I hope that he treats you well… I thought that he hurt you by leaving… again. Hoping that comforting might be useful.  At times, I wonder what are those complains that you have told him about me, about us… about the waiting and crying.  I cherish the times when we were together. I really enjoy those 2 years even when we have our ups and downs. I was seriously thinking about being with you… together in life and such… even after we break up. I was thinking, perhaps later, when you are alone and single, we might connect and have the chance again. Then I can get to know you all over… if we even click... But why the hatred?  You mentioned about all the wrongs I did 2 years ago…  Why did I do 2 years ago to cause you this hatred? Just by being there? I know about the irritation recently… but I never did get an understanding on why you left. Especially when 2 days before you left me, we are still talking about waking up in the morning so that you will send me to camp in your yellow Getz. I was loving you when you choose to leave. I dun know what happened…. you drop me from so high, when I was feeling great being with you. No idea at all….  After what happened yesterday, I was trying to find a reason to be upset but I cant. The vision of us being together is too strong to be upset. Yet somehow, there was this big wonder on the rights for you to delete those 2 entries. Missing out those 2 days is like...  If you are really upset over my blog and want to get away… why are you reading it in the first place? Delete this blog if you want… you got the password.  Love… as you said is a feeling. Love … is also a commitment. Being there in health or sickness, for richer or poorer…. Just 2 person! Maybe someday… things might click. Knowing you. You know that I still love you… and I do. Go be with him.

      I cant understand where the serenity came from. For a moment, there was really peace from within. And the love for her came in the simplest form. I want to capture this feeling at this moment... I wish everything can come to a halt so that I can continue to enjoy this moment I have with her.  I always wonder how far we will go when we started off. She did come out of a relationship not too long ago... commitment? seriously, I was scare to give it all, afraid that she leaves one day and there will be nothing left for me. Overtime, through series of arguments, found that I love her even more. Willingness to give it all... now.  She was my dream and everything. I love kissing her and hugging her. I enjoy the moment that we had at the mirror, our little moment. I like the way she looked at me and the way love was expressed. I feel blessed when she sleeps in my arm, cuddled. I like the way she smiles, 9 different kinds of smiles in all -  She has a smile for the times when she is being polite. A smile for those times when she finds the confidence to do what she wants. A smile when she is with her good friends. A smile when she experience something new and exciting. A smile when she finds peace within. A smile when she is uncomfortable. A smile when she wants to console someone. A smile when she talked about her love... and one last special smile when she was with me, when I was her boyfriend...   We actually grew up together somewhat. We share the same lifestyle, grew up with the same songs and music. Had that same bit of dysfunctional family experience. Enjoys the peaceful moments. Being cultured yet releasing that little wildness once in a while. Likes staying still for a moment with a nice cocktail and some live music.  We had our fair share of arguements, perhaps more than other couples. I thought that overcoming ostacles is a part of growing in a relationship, seeing that nice rainbow after the storm will enhance it even more. It proofs that too many storms will take away the novelty of seeing the same rainbow.  Michelle is not perfect, neither am I. She has her temper and I have mine. But she is the gal I want to grow old with, to watch her get having grey hair, live life together, enjoy that her little scolding and crying, through all the times, in simplicity, love in its most simple form. These images become clearer by the day, it is so real that I practically experience it and walking the life that I hope we did.   The images forms a part of the peace. Never felt so loved by her ever since 4th March. I hope that she is here now, I hope all these are real. Smiles on these images, just being there with her. There are only 3 more words which means lots to say. My jian dan xing fu... never again jian dan. *smile*

Lets meet up later to pledge our lives again… ‘We, members of the NCC’ ”. Those were the times. Lolz.  Not promoted this year... maybe the next? hehe...

      Satisfied on simplity. It was nice being able to chat her again. Double O was loud but wasn’t really dancing. Portugal won the game, wasn’t really ecstatic abt it.  Just cant sleep last night. Done with another bottle of Chivas. Just one more left… Another drunken night. Wonder how I manage to wake up this morning The only good thing happened to me was being able to drive again. Felt nice even when it was rented. I need the speed.  I hope to go back to the past, hope to call her on the phone. Back to the feeling when I was calling her after “Black Hawk Down”. Hope to chat her till late nights… talking senseless stuff, share some mind talk. Being simple. Going back to being friends. Starting to know her all over again. Perhaps… perhaps… perhaps… Penny?

      Came into office feeling indifferent. Series of event changes that mood.  Wondering if I have been destroying pple's life all these while. I might really be a negative influence after all. With loads of stuff directed to me, wondering if I am really capable to take up the challenges. Watching people loading more to themselves and things not going well... Love being a burden, history repeating itself.  Love is suppose to be sweet... memorable... and ever lasting. Be it for someone special, for friends or for the task you are doing. Why is it that it becomes painful after sometime? Something gotta change for the situation to change, they gotta change. I hope things work out for everyone... be it love, friends or career. I am attracting negative forces into me which I should not be doing. Especially in this case... yet I love it all. I should start telling pple how they matter in my life.  Trying hard to calm down now. Trying to find the serenity that was once present. Following the past, caring too much is becoming too heavy to bear now. A moment ago, decided to go for the cat class, perhaps some peace can be found from within... in the mids of the vibration.  *thinking too much, heavy heart with a pint of Lucifer in me*  Our Father in heaven, hallow be thy name, thy kingdom comes, thy will be done.... sigh... Praying for peace for everyone, especially in that case.

      I was going to gripe about how I got lectured the whole day... along with other junks.  Everything ended nicely when Pheobe got married... Ross with that smelly dog. Oh, suddenly the song "smelly cat" came into my mind... lolz.
