      Ahoj! Everyone,   Well week 2 was interesting here in the Czech Republic.     * Monday was my first offical day of work.  For those of you who don't know I work for an auto company called Auto Heller (www.autoheller.cz) that sells Volkswagon, Audi, Seat, and of course Skoda.  I market for the Skoda division.  I work from 8am until 3:30 pm. I have to wake up at like 5:30 am because I have to take a train at 7 am from Karvina (the city I live in) to Ostrava (city I work in)....only 30 minute train ride then a 15 minute trolley bus ride.  I spent the morning relearning everyone's names.  My boss (Mrs. Iveta Grafova Hellerova) decided that it would good for me to write a two page paper about Auto Heller's competitors....true good idea but she already printed out all the information I needed about their competitors.  So all I had to do was write the paper which only took like an hour. The rest of the day I just sat around and surfed the internet.   *Tuesday was the big promotion of the newest model of Skoda called Octavia. I arrived at work at noon as my boss wanted me to attend the promotion for the evening without having to go back to Karvina and then to Ostrava.  I spent the afternoon helping on a small task of stuffing promo bags with brochures on Octavia and small bottles of wine....after that I surfed the web.  But when 7 pm rolled around that was when the action started to happen.  I've never been to a car unveiling so everything was new to me.  To start things off about 150 people came...from avid car buyers to major business clients.  The program started with a fashion show of scantily clad women who were skinny, tall, and sexy...try standing next to one of them...feelings of inadequacies come to mind.  Anyway they modelled in see through dresses, evening gowns, and mod 60's fashion.  Then there was this cheesy famous Czech guy, who used to sing on cruise ships, singing songs from Frank Sinatra...picture if you will, a czech accent and the song "New York, New York!"  Yeah I was laughing so hard I had to pee....sorry for that image! Then there was this Czech band called the "Jumping Drums" who get this....only play the drums.  They were awesome!  Then finally the car was unveiled as yet again 2 scantily clad models and the one buff man paraded out and pulled the sheet off the car where they used some stage magic of smoke and fireworks.  Overall it was an awesome experience...oh yeah and tons of food!  Not to worry b/c I took photos and some video of the singer singing so you can all enjoy the experience as well.   urlLink Check out the photos!!!   *Wednesday another quiet day at work where once again I surfed the web and got to sit in on the company's English classes for the employees.  They all had to ask me questions in English from the stuff they've learned since they started back in January.  I was quite impressed with them.  However, it reminded me of when I was in the 4th grade and we were just learning how to speak French and the frustration on everyones faces as they tried to think of the word and the proper grammar to use.  Yeah exciting stuff! That night I stayed in Ostrava for a party with some AIESECers who have finished their work terms here in CR (Czech Republic). They all live in this hotel with accomodations that slightly resembled my own in the dorms of Karvina.  One guy is from England his name is Andy (very hot...and the accent made him hotter), Babu from USA (East Indian American), and Ildi from Hungary.  They said their goodbye speeches and there was crying...then came the drinks.  We did shots of Hungarian liquor and drank Czech beer  (Radegast and Gambrinus).  Then for some light conversation we headed to the Havanna pub on Stodolní street.  Yeah I ended up staying in Ostrava for the night...this morning I went to work smelling like a bar wearing the exact same clothes the day before and looking like a zombie.   *Thursday, today, I found out that I no longer have to use the laptop at work and that as of Friday I will be receiving a computer to pass the time away to surf the web .  And my boss has gotten me a mobile phone and I too will be receiving that on Friday (everyone in the CR uses mobiles for everything...instant messaging is very popular).  She will only charge me 1,000 czech crowns a month...so not bad!  Mrs. Grafova has also invited me for dinner next Thursday at her home...so again pretty cool.  And I might be going to Budapest, Hungary by car with 9 other trainees from Ostrava for the weekend. However, there is a small charity thing that Auto Heller is hosting for children on Saturday ("Children's Day).  And a chance to test drive the new Octavia with my work colleagues.  So tonight I sit here and ponder what to do????? Who knows!!!!  Oh and another cool thing my boss offered that the next time my friends and I want to do a road trip she will give me cars to use b/c Auto Heller also rents cars.  And tomorrow I actually get some work to do.  I am meeting with the web designer and helping to make the english version to the current website.  Yeah I was like jumping off the wall when I heard that!!!   So overall my week has been great.  I'm in the process of developing a webpage for everyone to view my experiences which, will make communication a whole lot easier and less annoying and no more unwanted long emails from me...also you will be able to see my pictures.  I love when I receive email me from everyone so keep it coming!     Love and Hugs,   Simone

      Ahoj vsichni!!! (Hello Everyone)   It's Czech-In time!!!     Saturday June 19- Was a day jam packed with activity!  I spent the morning having breakfast with the Ostrava trainees...omlettes with bread!!  Those of you who really know me, know that I don't eat eggs unless they are magically prepared so that I can't see or taste them... so I just had the bread!  After breakfast we all went to the Ostrava zoo where we had beers and took pictures of the animals.  I flock to my faves...monkeys and tigers!!!  Then we hurried to the train station to pick up Ostrava's newest trainee from India, Sangursh.  Nice fella, excited to be here...first thing he wanted to do was prepare an authentic Indian dinner.  However, we opted to go to a Italian restaurant.  I guess the following day he made the dinner but I stayed in Karvina.  Of course we made our way to Stodolni street for some dancing later that night.  But as usual Gina and I had to wait for the train at 4:30 in the morning.  So we had to stay at the bar where as usual I got unwanted attention...the men here seem to find very exotic women attractive because they just wouldn't leave me alone always wanting to talk to me and buy drinks for me!!! Oh well we survived and made it back to Karvina at 5:00 am and went straight to bed.   Sunday June 20- I did not spend the entire day sleeping in fact I got up at 11:00 am and Gina and I decided to play some card games.   Tuesday June 22- At work they had an event planned for handicapped children.  So they removed the Skoda vehicles from the showroom and put chairs and a stage in.  There was a pop singer named Kobersky who sang (popular with the young girls...didn't get his autograph but I did get his promo photo from him...oh and I have video of him performing).  There was also a group of young girls who danced to some hip hop, a belly dancer, wild birds like owls and eagles, a mini carnival of games in the parking lot, and the police did a demonstration with the police dogs.  I was not told about this event so I was lucky I had my camera that day with me.  It was fun and my boss was amazed when I told her that the car dealerships in Canada don't do this kind of thing!!!   Wednesday June 23- Had a goodbye drink with the Finnish guys, Tony and Artu (pronounced like the Star Wars robot R2D2).  They were doing a international job exchange with the university here (not AIESEC involved but they lived on my floor of the dorms).  They were interesting because I learned so much about the Finnish culture like they play ice tennis, the sun doesn't set in the summer, and almost every home has a sauna (little cottages on the side of the house that is like a steam room or almost like a Turkish bath but Finnish).  I will miss them but not the fact that they always smoked!!!!   And this weekend marks when I say goodbye to Gina.  She leaves for Germany on Sunday to spend the month with her boyfriend in Germany and then in August she will go back to Mexico.  I plan on visiting her in July in Germany and then we are going to tour around Germay for a week.  And she wants me to come to Mexico when my traineeship is done.  So I guess in a way I'm not saying goodbye.  And even though I say goodbye to one friend I will probably make more this weekend because it is the MC Takeover Party.  So trainees, alumni, AIESEC execs and members from all over the Czech Republic will be partying in Protivanov just outside of Olomoucs.  And the Australian girl, Ayeesha arrives so I will not be all alone in Karvina.  One thing I have learned is really how to pack for these kind of small weekend trips.  I find that I don't bring makeup and typically wear the same clothes most of the weekend and one pair of shoes...so I'm becoming thrifty!!!!! So my adventure continues...Czech-In with you all next week!!!!   Hugs, Kisses, and Love   Simone    P.S. I have created a web blogger and it has all my updates on there.  So I think I might just post my updates on there instead of emailing everybody and bugging you all with my stories...this way you have the choice of whether of not you want to read about my experiences!!!! My blogger can be found at http://simonel_ca.blogspot.com/  I'm trying to figure out how to post pictures on there so bare with me!!! Later!

      Well Hello Everyone!!!   How are you all?  How's the weather?  Hope all is good!  As you know it's that time of the week again where I get to unload all the experiences I've had over the course of the week.  But first I would like to mention that no one told me that: (1) the Calgary Flames lost in the Stanley Cup Finals; and (2) that both Ronald Regan and Ray Charles past away.  I suppose I didn't hear about this because none of you know that I don't have a TV...Just a radio and other news mediums that are all in Czech!  Well you're forgiven!  Most of the news I hear, I actually have to read on MSN Canada.   Saturday June 12th - I really did nothing but cleaned my dorm room.  You know vaccum the floor, tidied my closet, and cleaned out my fridge.  I even hand washed my bras...sorry to the males who have to read about that!    Sunday June 13th - Sunday afternonn went to Poland!  It is only 20 minutes away by train from Karvina  and a 5 minute walk to the Polish border.  I went with Gina...she wanted to show me this place that serves great tea and cakes. It was funny trying to cross the border because we forgot to bring the border crossing papers.  So the passport control, who were all really nice and funny, held us up for like 20 minutes just observing our passports over and over again wondering why a Canadian and a Mexican were on that side of the world!  Eventually we got through and had our tea.  That night I finally spoke to my Mom on my mobile...it was great to hear her voice but knowing the limits of technology my phone decided that I was out of credit and the battery died just 15 minutes into our conversation.  No worries though because we now have a calling schedule to avoid things like that!   Monday June 14th - Went to a Congo Bongo concert in the tea room here in Karvina.  It was great but after an hour of hearing almost the exact same stuff you get kinda bored!  One of the bongo drummers was really into his music that at times it looked as if he was going through some great, erotic pleasure!!!....ah lets face we are all adults...he looked like he having an orgasm!!   Tuesaday June 15th - Finally got paid a portion of my salary...enough for about 2 weeks as I am so poor dinner this week has been cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, and water. Luckily, I get the rest on the 27th.  I also bought my train ticket with great success.  With the few words I knew in Czech I was able to communicate that I needed a return monthly pass from Karvina to Ostrava, Ostrava to Karvina.  Yes I gave myself the biggest hug and kiss ever!!! And I don't think I've mentionned this but since I've arrived here in the Czech Republic I've had the worst allergies.  There have these big pollen cotton ball things flying through the air that literally play havoc with my body.  Because Tuesday it was like a storm of these things and my nose was on nasal drip 24/7.  That's right I had to have kleenex on me at all times.  I sneezed, my nose was runny, my eyes were teary, and all I wanted to do was hide.  Tuesday was the worst I've been since I've been here.   Food this week was intersting at work.  Wednesday was the supposedly authentic Czech meal.  Which turned out that I've actually had before...roast beef covered in a thick creamy  mushroom sauce and 5 thick slabs of lemon bread.  I really hate this meal because it really makes me use the toilet!    Thursday was the meat dumplings with authentic sauerkraut.  Sauerkraut was awesome... the meat dumplings not so good.  And today it was sauerkraut soup with bits of potatoes and smoked sausage.  That was good!   And this week I heard the funniest song on the radio.  Here are some of the lyrics I caught: "Would you like to come to a menage-a-trois?  There's room for one more body in our boudoire.  Would you like to try a little un, deux, trois...everybody has a chance to be a star!"  It was so funny when I heard this...I swear the people in the office must have thought that there was something wrong with me!   Well that is all for now.  I tried to keep the stories short because I know in the past they were quite long.  I also have my pictures up.  And to cause further problems my digital camera won't download the pictures off it....have no fear I'll think of something.  Have a great weekend.  Maybe go out and enjoy some rugby...Churchill Cup at Commonwealth should be real fun!!!   Love, Hugs, and Kisses!   Simone

      Well folks it's that time of the week again where you get to hear about all the happenings here in the good ol' Czech Republic!  Do you know that I've been here for 1 month...well officially on Saturday June 12th marks my anniversary....feel free to have some champagne and toast my success thus far!!!!   This week has been a slow week for me.  It was mostly spent recovering from the party last weekend in  urlLink Vienna .  But now that it is Friday I'm feeling much better!     WARNING THIS UPDATE IS QUITE BORING SO I UNDERSTAND IF YOU JUST SKIP RIGHT TO THE END WHERE I SAY GOODBYE....REALLY NO HARM DONE!    I finally called home after being here for a month...on my mobile!  I spoke to Desiree and we chatted for 30 minutes and it costed me about 260 CZK or 13.50 CAD.  Not bad!  She made me realize that I hadn't talked about the city of Karvina, the food, the dress, or my work.  So that is basically the main focus of this update.   Work is interesting I am currently translating the AUTO Heller s.r.o website from Czech to English which is proving to  be a real frustrating task.  The web guy, Petr, speaks English and I thought they would get him to translate and me to correct the grammar, structure, etc.  However, that is not the case.  The translation is all up to me but Petr gave me a website where I can translate some text...which when translated makes no sense at all.  So I've gotten a plan.  The contact information is pretty simple to do as well as the operational hours.  I've also managed to figure out how to get the description of cars...I simply go to all the English websites for those cars and rewrite the information.  When it comes to translating the company info I will probably get my boss Mrs. Iveta Grafova or someone to help.  Other than that work is good.  Today I helped Mrs. Elen Grafova (my boss' sister, manager of marketing dept), with some corrections to an English document and I helped Sylvie (an administrator) with her English lesson assignment...which made me realize that I don't pay attention to things like past tenses and present tense and superlatives, etc....now I know why I they say English is a hard language to learn....well not as hard as the Czech language!   The food!!! Well as you all know that I've gained some extra weight (but as of this week I've manged to go running 3 times for 20 minutes!).  You know that saying "a moment on the lips is a lifetime on the hips!"  Well they trully mean that!  Like I've said in pass emails the food is very rich.  You will find potatoes, bread, rice, beef, pork meat, and chicken among the top selections.  And most of the time you eat this midday and you eat lighter in the mornings and the evenings.  At work I eat in the cafeteria and the food has been okay.  I really love the soups.  For example, this week I had a chicken broth soup with sliced onions and carrots; chicken broth with flour dumplings; and today was the tomato soup with rice and sliced carrots floating in it.  And the main course, boiled potatoes with a chicken steak aka chicken with bread crumbs.  Really good!  I haven't really had a authentic Czech dish yet.  But I heard Wednesday's dish will be...so we'll see!   The dress!! If you are a young person up to the age of 15 or 16 chances are your parents are the ones with the money and thus they buy the clothes....hence that is why they dress them straight from an old flashback of the 80's.  If you're my age you dress decent.  But I've notice that the women here like to wear high heels all the time, short skirts/shorts, and see through shirts.  I think in Prague the style of dress is much more modern but in my little town the style of the 80's is very much present...including the stylin' mullets!!!!   What else????  Oh on Thursday we had another big car promotion this time for SEAT's new Altea.  Because the brand is from Spain they had a mariachi band (all three were Czech of course but sounded straight out of Mexico), flamenco dancers, a swimsuit fashion show, and lots of food and drink.  Don't worry I took pictures and video of the flamenco dancers.  The owner of AUTO Heller was there and kept approaching me asking me in Czech if I like the show.  All I could say was Dobré (good).  And then he kept telling me to get something to drink as they had tons of free beer and wine.  Well I couldn't hurt the man's feelings so I drank 3 glasses of wine (1 white and 2 red). Cheers!  urlLink Photos of SEAT Promotion!!   So that is all for now.  I plan on doing some exploring of my city of Karvina this weekend as I can not afford to travel around this time.  So next week you will get an insight on what kind of train I take, the major square, the shops, my dorm, the bus, the people, the food, etc.  Well that's all folks!  urlLink Photos of Karvina!!    Hugs, Kisses, and Love,   Simone

      Ahoj vsichni! (Hello Everyone)  Well I haven't written in awhile because I've been travelling, working, and sleeping a whole lot. Last weekend I had the great opportunity of going to Budapest, Hungary. It was so much fun except for the 6 hour drive in the smallest car possible the Škoda Felicia. There were ten of us so 5 to each car. It must have looked very strange for the border patrol when they checked our passports because there were people from Germany, Hungary, America, Czech Republic, and Canada. It was very international. The only trouble we encountered in Budapest was when the car I was in, was trying to catch up to the other car and we ran a red light at like 2 in the morning. We got pulled over by the police but they didn't speak English, German or any Czech. Luckily though our Hungarian girl, Ildi, told them the situation and let us go. Other than that Budapest is a beautiful city filled with castles, monumental bridges, parks, labrinyths, and spa baths. We also ate fresh fish and drank Hungarian beer along the Danube River. It was so amazing. And later that night we danced to the wee hours of the morning in this crowded sweaty bar. There was also this couple who decided to "get it on" right behind me. Yeah I didn't know how to say in Hungarian find a room!  urlLink Check out the photos!!   Oh and I am now the proud owner of 2 mobiles. How you ask? Well I went with Lucie, one of the AIESEC members here, and she took me to a place that had mobiles for good prices. So I ended up buying one for 2000 CZK with a 300 CZK credit (so like 100 CAD). Unlike the cell phone places in Canada I don't have to purchase the plan and be trapped in the contract for like 2 years. Here I can just buy the phone, the SIM card (which allows me to make calls in Europe), and then I just purchase a phone card thing and add the credit to my phone by dialing it in. The other phone I received the next day from my boss. That phone is a company phone and is completely free for me. I am given a 1,000 CZK credit for it each month by the company and once I exceed that limit in the month that would be the time I would pay. Pretty cool, eh?!   What else....I tried this neat snack the other day it was a slice of french bread with potato salad layered on it then a slice of ham with pickles. It was surprisingly good! And another story about food and this one is actually pretty funny. I believe that I have started to understand and master some things in Czech so I felt confident enough to order a hamburger. Well I got a hamburger but it wasn't your traditional beef patty...no I got a slab of ham. You the know the kind you eat around Christmas. It was a hamburger with lettuce, tomatoes, and cheese. Yeah I know, funny!!!  Oh yes and this past weekend I went to another beautiful country. I went to Vienna, Austria. It is a very beautiful. Gina (the Mexican trainee) had a friend there whose friends were hosting a party. So Friday night I decided I would go. We went by train on Saturday morning and it only took 3 hours. We toured around and looked at all the buildings and churches. They have some amazing shops from Gucci, Prada, Chanel, and many other major designers. They drive a lot of nice cars there too. In particular, cabs were typically Mercedes Benz's and BMW's. The weather was great as well. And there are people of many different cultures there from Africa to India to Turkey. Their metro stations are also very easy to understand even though it is all in German. I want to go back to Vienna sometime because you really can't do everything in one day.  urlLink Check out the photos!!    Oh I do have some bad news though. On Friday, Gina and I wanted to go shopping in Ostrava after I had finished work for the day. We were on a tram and these three dodgy looking men came on the tram and surrounded us. I knew something was up but our stop was the next one and once we got off we noticed that both our bags were opened. I looked through my bag to make sure that I still had my wallet, money, and both mobiles...and I did. However Gina was not so lucky...her mobile was stolen. We were so angry. I called her mobile and the guys who stole it picked up and was like "ahoj!" We were like speak english and return the phone. They hung up and that was the end of that. We were angry and just moments before Gina was telling me how safe she felt in Ostrava. Well after that episode we now are more aware of our belongings. Gina's phone was broken anyhow. In fact the antenna was broken and the buttons were always stuck.   Well I should go as I'm at work right now and I should be working but I wanted to update everyone on what has been going on over here. Take care!  Love n' Hugs! Simone :0)

      Hello Everyone,   Usually when I check in it is about my experiences and the "going-on's" here in the Czech Republic.&nbsp; Well this time it is something different.&nbsp; This article is made to make you think about things that are happening around the world everyday of our lives.   Since my very first day here I notice that many times the AIESECers and other Czech/Slovak citizens would warn me don't talk to the gypsies.&nbsp; Or don't go down that road there are gypsies living there.&nbsp; Or, even&nbsp;make jokes like "if you throw a coin into a fountain don't expect it to stay there long because&nbsp;the gypsies will take it!"&nbsp; For so long I wanted to ask what is this almost "hatred" towards gypsies because I don't understand it.&nbsp; Well I finally asked and the response I received did not satisfy my curiosity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Here many Czech/Slovak people consider the&nbsp;"Roma"&nbsp;or "gypsies"&nbsp;lazy, irresponsible, not hard working, and are criminals.&nbsp; When democratic policies and practices were introduced in the early 1990s the economic instability&nbsp;that accompanied&nbsp;saw an increase in unemployment and an increase in crime rate among the&nbsp;Roma peoples.&nbsp; I was told by one person that the government has tried to help the gypsies by providing them with affordable housing units but the gypsies simply burned the buildings down.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I still don't understand this natural feeling towards the gypsies.&nbsp; Yes, there are many gypsies who are poor and even appear to be violent to unsuspecting passerbys like myself.&nbsp; I have seen young children who tease gypsie children.&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet, many of the people I spoke to don't consider themselves racist.&nbsp; I have found that as a result of me&nbsp;hearing the constant things I do about these people I do find that I do my best to avoid them and that I try not talk to them...I believe I have learned this behaviour from those around me.&nbsp; This made me think "hate is not born but is truly learned."   I hope I was able to drive some discussion amongst yourselves because even now I still find myself confused and wanting to ask more questions about&nbsp;this issue.&nbsp; I know in August I plan on going to Auschewitz in Poland to see the concentration camps....very scary but to learn and to see&nbsp;what hate can lead too will open my mind and my heart!    -"He who&nbsp;saves one life, saves the world entire."   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schindler's List, Steven Spielberg, 1993 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Good Morning, Afternoon, or Evening to you All!!!   I've had such an eventful week that I might as well go straight into my week-in-review!   July 24- Guess what?&nbsp; The Stanley Cup made it's way to Ostrava.&nbsp; Pavel Kubina was here with the cup as part of the&nbsp;Stanley Cup Tour for the winning team, Tampa Bay Lightning.&nbsp; So Saturday morning I made my way to Futurum (big shopping center in Ostrava) where there were tons of people.&nbsp; There was no official line up, just cram yourself up along one side of the stage and try to breathe.&nbsp; Well after about 40 minutes struggling to make my way to the front I got to Pavel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He asked me where I was from and I said "Edmonton, Alberta, Canada."&nbsp; He said "that is close to Calgary, isn't it?"&nbsp;&nbsp;We both&nbsp;laughed and I said "yes it is."&nbsp; I took my picture with him and congratulated him.&nbsp; Pretty cool, eh?!&nbsp; And the host of the event just happened to be the host of one of AUTO Heller's events and he remembered me and took me picture for me.&nbsp; And Saturday was also the arrival of Karvina's newest trainee Gerd, from Austria.&nbsp; Really cool and intelligent guy.&nbsp; We took him straight from the train station to a pub to try the Czech beer and food.&nbsp; We also got to have some Q&A with him.&nbsp; No brothers or sisters, no pets, has travelled to various places around Europe like Norway and Spain.&nbsp; And was recently in the Dominican Republic.&nbsp; He is 25 and has graduated with 2 degrees in Marketing/Management and&nbsp;Economics/Finance.&nbsp; And he hates cheese...can you believe that especially since I'm a cheese lover!!!   July 25- I did the unimaginable and went running with Moni (president of AIESEC Karvina) for 1 whole hour.&nbsp; I know I shocked myself.&nbsp; Although she was always ahead of me by a good 200 metres I made only&nbsp;3 stops.&nbsp; Later that morning we headed to Drahotuse (near Prerov and Hranice&nbsp;na Morave)&nbsp;for Ann's Fair.&nbsp; Had a great time rode on all the scary&nbsp;rides, tried this salty string cheese, had a Czech slush, got video taped by a TV camera, ate a sausage called piviny pes (smelly cheese, onions, bread, spices...really quite disgusting but I&nbsp;now can say that I tried it!!!  Then we went to&nbsp;the Helfstyn&nbsp;castle in Lipnika nad Becvou...walked about 800meteres...don't ask me how much that is in&nbsp;kilometres because everyone in Europe seems to use metres to describe distance...but all I can say is that my feet were sore and so&nbsp;were my legs...I could really use a pedicure and a massage!!!!   July 26- Had a house warming dinner at the flat....us ladies (Moni, Ayesha, Lucie, and myself) prepared dinner for our two lone men (Gerd and Milan).&nbsp; We had pasta with olives, green onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, and tuna.&nbsp; It was delicious.&nbsp; I also announced that I will be moving to the flat by the weekend.&nbsp; It will be different but a welcomed change.   July 27- One of the girls from AIESEC Karvina is organizing the national conference for the Czech Republic and had met with my boss, Mrs. Grafova to see if they could lend cars for the conference.&nbsp; And knowing my boss I knew she would say yes.&nbsp; In addition, I asked to see if we could borrow a car for next weekend as we are making our way to Poprad Tatry, Slovakia for a music festival.&nbsp; And of course, Mrs. Grafova said I could have a car...looks like either the Skoda Fabia (small but good) or the Octavia (roomy, bigger, and comfortable ride).&nbsp; Went running again with Moni and Gerd came along this time.&nbsp; And although they left me in the dust I only made 2 stops.&nbsp; The more I run this route the better I will become.&nbsp;   July 29- We had Gerd's official welcome party.&nbsp; Well the AIESECers decided it would be fun to have a trivia game about the Czech Republic and about themselves.&nbsp; The catch was that if we got the question wrong we would get a plate full of whip cream to the face.&nbsp; I am happy to say that I got creamed 3 times because I answered wrong to such questions&nbsp;like the year&nbsp;Czech and Slovakia separated (1993) and the word for chair in Czech (zidle) wrong.&nbsp; But anyway it was the trainees who came out victorious "creaming" (sorry about the pun) the AIESECers.&nbsp; Oh and I went running again but this time I did it in the rain by myself and I did it in 45 minutes as compared to my 60 minutes.   Well that's my week in a nutshell.&nbsp; This weekend should be intersting because I move into the flat Saturday.&nbsp; I've already moved some of my things to it but still have way more to go.&nbsp; And Elnara from the Ukraine arrives early Sunday morning.&nbsp; Can't wait to meet her!!!&nbsp;   Love and Big Fat Sloppy Wet Kisses,  Simone&nbsp;   P.S.

      Hello Everyone,   This week I was host to a guest in my room.&nbsp; He was aways bugging me and drinking lots.&nbsp; Yes that's right folks I played host to a mosquito.&nbsp; And when I finally squished him in between my hands last night I got the best night's sleep all week long.&nbsp; I also have the biggest bites as a result.&nbsp; They look like extra limbs.&nbsp; And to complain just a bit more the weather has been extremely hot...we've been topping at 30 degrees since Saturday.&nbsp; I can honestly say I've gotten a couple of&nbsp;shades darker.&nbsp;   July 16/04- took Ayesha to meet Ostrava trainees and to introduce her to Stodolni Street.&nbsp; Everyone was so quiet and tired that I felt bad that Ayesha didn't get a good impression of them.&nbsp; They really are a great bunch of people.&nbsp; We did however go to Stodolni but with only 2 of the 10 trainees.&nbsp; And by the end of the night Ayesha was making out with Rene (Dutch).&nbsp;   July 17/04- went to Cesky Tesin (Czech side) and crossed the border to Cieszyn (Polish side).&nbsp; Ayesha and I walked around went into this amazing church...looked like a abandoned building from the outside but turned out to be so beautiful in the inside....see looks are deceiving!!&nbsp; They had paintings and statues throughout the church.&nbsp; I wanted to take a picture but I would feel so bad especially since there were people and nuns in the corner&nbsp;having some sort of&nbsp;prayer service.&nbsp; After that we ventured to this cute little bakery and had coconut macaroons and other cookies.&nbsp; We then went to this viewing spot of Cieszyn.&nbsp; Since Cieszyn is so small (we saw everything in the city within 2 hours) we headed back to Karvina to watch a movie.&nbsp; Yes we saw Shrek 2.&nbsp; It was great and it looked funny...looked funny??!&nbsp; Unlike the previous movies I've seen this one&nbsp;was not in English with Czech subtitles but it&nbsp;was dubbed in Czech.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So when I get home I want to see it in English.&nbsp; I felt bad, however, because this was the first movie Ayesha saw in the Czech Republic and it was in Czech!!!&nbsp; Oh well I did learn&nbsp;for next time that I&nbsp;need to&nbsp;ask&nbsp;&nbsp;"cesky dabing".   July 21/04- Work has been good.&nbsp; Mrs. Grafova gave me a new task of coming up with ideas for a marketing event for SEAT.&nbsp; As the SEAT showroom has only been adveraging 6 cars per month whereas Skoda, VW, Audi do about 60-80 or more in one month each.&nbsp; So after I asked her some questions I found out the cars&nbsp;are&nbsp;targeted to families but it is&nbsp;very expensive and has a small trunk.&nbsp; So with that information I came up with some ideas and Tuesaday I presented them but somehow I felt it wasn't quite what she wanted.&nbsp; She said they were good ideas but the look on her face seemed disappointed...it's like she had higher expectations for her English speaker from Canada with her university marketing degree.&nbsp; So feeling sad and upset I went back to Karvina and took a bus and sat on it and rode around the city....which turned out to be a good idea because I got to see areas of Karvina I didn't know about like there's outdoor swimming pool and another place to do grocery shopping.   July 21/04- My boss Mrs. Iveta Grafova, Mrs. Elen Grafova (bosses sister and marketing director at Auto Heller), and Ivo Horinek (bosses assistant) headed to view a potential area to host the family event for SEAT.&nbsp; It was actually pretty cool with miniature buildings from various EU countries like Italy's leaning tower of Pisa, London's Big Ben, Rome's Coliseum, etc.&nbsp; And the manager there spoke perfect English and just had a ball talking to me and translating the entire meeting.&nbsp; Mrs. Iveta Grafova found&nbsp;it funny that he said "par-dee"...a very southern American accent of saying "party."&nbsp; Turns out he goes to Orlando, Florida once every year.&nbsp; Check out the website for  urlLink www.miniuni.cz  and is available in English as well.   July 22/04- Funny thing happen when I went running on this day.&nbsp; Lately whenever I go there are these young children (about 9-12 years of age) who are always yelling things at me in Czech.&nbsp; I've always thought these kids are so rude yelling at someone they don't know.&nbsp; Well this time they were following me back to the dorms and waving.&nbsp; And it turns out they were yelling "Marion Jonesova, Marion Jonesova!"&nbsp; They think I'm Marion Jones running in their neighbourhood.&nbsp; So I'm a celebrity...pretty funny, eh?!&nbsp; And later that night we went for dinner at this Mexican restaurant and Alenka (MC team) was there.&nbsp; After a delicious Mexican meal we headed for some bowling where I was the two time champion.&nbsp; And then&nbsp;it was trainees against AIESECers, and guess who won...that's right trainees!!!&nbsp; And even though I thought the night was over by time we got&nbsp;back to the dorms we ended up eating cake, reading magazines, and drinking wine.&nbsp; It was a great evening!!!&nbsp;Check out the  urlLink pictures !!!  And I think I will move into the trainee flat in Karvina.&nbsp; I finally found out that the rent will be 2,000 -Kc which is the same amount I am paying now at the dorms but Milanko told me that in the fall it will increase to 2,600 -Kc.&nbsp; See how things are starting to make sense.&nbsp; However, I am still looking into moving to the Ostrava hotel with the trainees that are there.&nbsp; They pay 1, 800 -Kc per month, have access to a kitchen, and free laundry services.&nbsp; It would also cut down on my travelling costs if I move there.&nbsp; So I have Lucie looking into finding out if there are any available rooms there.&nbsp; Keep your fingers crossed!!  Well that concludes this weeks update but stayed tuned for next week Gerd's, the Austrain trainee, arrival to Karvina and the Ann's Fair that we are all attending on Sunday July 25, 2004.  Kisses,  Simone

      Ahoj Family and Friends,  &nbsp;  Czeching-In on this cool Friday morning....looks like it's going to rain!&nbsp; Speaking of rain and weather, in general, sorry to hear about the terrible storm you had last weekend.&nbsp; I saw some of the photos that various people sent me and I can't believe it.&nbsp; Well I hope that everyone is okay and that there was minimal or no damage done to your homes and vehicles.  &nbsp;  As you all know I spent last weekend in Prague with Lisa and her Mom.&nbsp; We had a great time!&nbsp; I stayed with them&nbsp;at their hostel (of which we had our own private shower and toilet).&nbsp; Spent the weekend shopping and sightseeing....and Lisa and I even made our way to the Sex Museum....interesting stuff?!&nbsp; We saw Charles Bridge,&nbsp; paddled down the Vlatava River, Old Town Square....funny there were so many men celebrating their stags in Prague from the UK.&nbsp; Saturday night we hit the discos and danced on the chairs.&nbsp; Met some really nice guys from Scotland and London....yes I even kissed the Brit!!!&nbsp; Sunday did some speed shopping and boarded my train back to Karvina.&nbsp; It took me 7 hours to get back to the dorms because I missed my direct connection to Karvina because the train came across some construction work along the rail line.  &nbsp;  Wednesday my boss took me to the newest location of AUTO Heller in Opava (about 30 minutes by car from Ostrava).&nbsp; There we met with the director and he showed us around the new location.&nbsp; And as they spoke Czech&nbsp;I took pictures, being the little shutter bug that I am.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the way back Mrs. Grafova told me that depending on the outcome of the English website I could be getting a raise...isn't that cool!!!&nbsp; She also mentionned that she has offered AIESEC Karvina the use of some cars for the national conference that we're hosting in September...so another bonus!!&nbsp; And then she told me that maybe next week I could come over for dinner with her family.&nbsp; She also wanted to know how long I plan on staying in the Czech Republic.&nbsp; I told her I want to extend my visa to mid November...so just a few weeks longer than intended!&nbsp; And I have the new task of trying to find some way to market the line of SEAT vehicles to families.&nbsp; As in the last month they have only averaged 6 cars whereas Skoda can sell 60-80 in a month.&nbsp; So finally some real marketing work!!  &nbsp;  Thursday I took Ayesha to the tea room in the square.&nbsp; There we chatted and got to know each other better.&nbsp; On the way back to the dorms she showed me the new flat that we trainees are to move into.&nbsp; Yes, apparently AIESEC Karvina found us trainees a flat to live in.&nbsp; They will purchase all our furniture and appliances.&nbsp; They are doing this because rent supposedly is to increase to 2,600 -Kc but this week when I paid rent I spent only 2,000 -Kc...not bad considering that when Gina was here she was paying 1,800 -Kc.&nbsp;&nbsp;The flat&nbsp;is actually located in a nice, quiet neighbourhood and about 10 minutes walk away from the train station.&nbsp; But if it's money they want to save me I might as well&nbsp;just move to Ostrava with the trainees there...I would save&nbsp;about 800 -Kc per month on transportation alone.&nbsp; And I would also be about 20 minutes walk away from my work.&nbsp; So I have a lot to think about in the next few days as we are to move by the end of the month.&nbsp; I will update you all on that situation when I make my decision.  &nbsp;  Unfortunately not going&nbsp;anywhere this weekend.&nbsp; However, I will take Ayesha to meet the Ostrava trainees tonight and go to Stodolni Street to party it up!!&nbsp; Then tomorrow I want to take her around Ostrava for some light shopping and sight seeing!  &nbsp;  Well everyone take care and keep in touch!!  &nbsp;  Love and Kisses,  Simone :0)  &nbsp;

      Hello everyone,  I usually don't do weekend updates but I had such an amazing weekend I couldn't wait for Friday to write about it.    As some of you might know Lisa and her Mom have been travelling through Europe for the past month.  And they made their way to Prague this past week.  So on Friday afternoon I took the 4 1/2 hour train ride from Ostrava to Prague.  The train ride down was actually pretty good especially because I got a train compartment all to myself.  I arrived in Prague at 8:30 pm where Lisa and her Mom met up with me.  It was so wonderful to see their smiling faces and give them both big hugs and kisses.  Immediately they took me to Old Town Square with all the cobble stone streets and hoards of tourists shopping, eating, and drinking.  There were tons of stags from the UK....men wearing kilts and t-shirts boasting about the next available man being taken by the ol' ball and chain.  And so many people spoke English that I did not have to use the small amount of Czech language I know to get by.  They also took me across to Charles bridge filled with buskers and people drawing and selling all kinds of merchandise.  And since it was already around 9 pm we went for dinner at this little place near the Vlatava River.  Soon it was 1 am and we headed back to their penzion, where they changed rooms so that there were 3 beds in the room and a private washroom....that was so sweet!!  Saturday morning we got up pretty late that we almost missed breakfast...baguette, butter,  ham, cheese and tomatoes.  After our light meal we headed back to Old Town Square where we spent the entire day shopping...well they did most of the shopping as I conveniently left my money and credit card back at the penzion.  Lisa and I even went to this Sex Museum where we looked back at the earliest forms of sexual activity even porn films from the early 1920s.  Interesting stuff!?!  And later that night we went dancing at this club called Double Trouble.  The guy to girl ratio was huge....I never seen that many men just hanging out in a dance club.  At first we thought maybe this was a gay club but no... men in Europe just like to dance, drink and have fun!  So with us crowded around guys from London and Scotland we danced with them on the chairs even though they tried their hardest to get us to dance on the tables.    And Sunday was pretty rushed as both Lisa and her Mom had to pack up all their things and check out of the penzion by 10 am.  So after breakfast (bread, butter, spreadable cheese) we headed back to the square did a little bit more shopping and we even went on a paddle boat ride down the Vlatava river...so much fun!!  Soon they escorted me back to the train station...they almost brought me to tears when I rode back on the train.  It was nice to see some familiar faces and to share both our experiences here in Europe first-hand.  I had such an amazing time and they saved me so much money because they let me stay with them for free and bought my meals for me.  They were fantastic!  Today they should be in Cologne, Germany and by mid-week they should be in Frankfurt.  And on Friday they head back home to Edmonton full of experiences and culture!  So the moral of the story is I am having a great time here in the Czech Republic but I wouldn't mind visitors!!!  Take care and keep in touch!!!  Love and Kisses, Simone   P.S. You can view photos of Prague  urlLink here !!  It is my 2 month anniversary here in the Czech Republic...so far so good!!

      Ahoj family and friends!!!  It's Czech-In time!!! Today in Ostrava and Karvina the sun is shinning brightly and so far I am having a relaxful good day because I finally finished translating the AUTO Heller website. And I also had a wonderful conversation with the garbage men in my neighbourhood this morning. After saying good morning and hello these past few weeks they finally asked me where I was from. They said Africa but I think I disappointed them by saying I was from Canada. Like I said before Eastern Europeans are fascinated with exotic looking women! Maybe one day I will ask them if we can take a picture together and I will show you who they are!  July 2 - celebrated Canada Day with a BBQ with the Ostrava trainees. It was more a gathering of friends than anything to do with Canada but at least Albert and I were able to silently reminisce about Canada. We ate sausages and drank beer. I even prepared that flag cake and I'm glad to say it was finished within seconds.   July 3 - Made my way to Liptovský Mikuláš, Slovakia. Beautiful mountain town. The train ride sucked because it was so crowded that I ended up standing for 2.5 hrs of the 3.5 hr ride...not fun! It was just me, Ayesha, Monika (AIESEC Karvina's LCP), and Martina (Monika's friend). We stayed at Monika's home which was beautiful with the flower garden and fire pit. And with a view from her backyard you can see a nesting spot for storks...yes storks! They have this saying there that if the stork lands on the roof of your home someone is going to be having a baby soon!! Sunday we did a 5 km hike up the low Tatra mountains (10km b/c we had to come down)...it was beautiful however my body truly felt the burn of sore muscles the next day!! And of course I took  urlLink pictures . Monday we went to Aquapark Tatralandia. This place is better than those mineral springs in Banff, Jasper, etc...because not only did they have mineral springs but also water slides, a mini area to play beach volleyball, water massage pipes, and little restaurants inside. We had an amazing time!! Then later that night we made our way back to Karvina.  July 6 - I've made a big accomplishment this week....I made pancakes!! They were so good!! I've been having cravings for pancakes with maple syrup and bacon for awhile and Tuesday I made them. I shared them with Ayesha who also enjoyed them. Then I took her to the square of Karvina to go to the tea room but it was closed for the holidays. So instead I took her to this cute little cafe where we drank tea and coffee.  July 8 - Had a goodbye party for Gerald, German trainee in Ostrava. Super nice guy and I will miss him. However, we all got invitations to come and visit him during the International Conference in Hanover...he promised we could all stay at his flat...and I already claimed the couch!! Pictures can be viewed  urlLink here !!  And guess what??? I managed to lose my work mobile (721 270 176). I had it charging in my room before I left for Slovakia but at the last minute I decided to leave it as it has really bad reception and poor roaming capibilities in other countries. It's turned off so I can't call it. So I tore my room apart looking for it and it's possible that I had it on me and may have dropped it on the bus or the train. So it is gone and I have yet to let my boss know that it is lost...although fearing the consequences I might just say it was stolen...we'll see!! So my other phone, the nice one I bought, I still have it and I am keeping constant tabs on it to make sure that I always have it.  Some more interesting news it seems that rent at the dorms will be increasing to a whopping 2,600 Kc. So without my knowledge AIESEC Karvina went and found us trainees a flat to live in. We are to move out by the end of July and it is closer to the train station but it is completely unfurnished which means spending money on buying furniture like beds and tables. I'm unsure if the price will increase to that amount as I haven't paid for my accomodation for last month yet...I will pay on Monday when I get paid so I will find out then. I might not move into the flat...I like having my own room and the dorm staff are wonderful. Whether I move or not all depends on, of course, if accomodations at the dorms is truly 2,600 Kc and the new rent that I will apparently be paying for at the flat. I may even just move to Ostrava and save myself the money on train tickets and buying new furniture. But I still need more information and I will let you all know as soon as possible of what is going on.  And this weekend I will meet up with Lisa and her Mom in Prague, who are currently travelling through Europe. I leave immediately after work on a 4 hr train ride. I will stay with them and do a little sight-seeing. It will be nice to see some familiar faces!!!!!  Until next week folks take care and keep in touch!!  Kisses, Simone

      Well hello everyone,  This week's update will be a little short as I am super busy running errands, finishing up the English version of the website, and getting things together for my long weekend!   June 25-27- Was a wild wild wild weekend at the MC Takeover Party!  Friday night was the arrivals of everyone to Protivanov...basically a camp site with these tiny cottages with 2 sets of bunk beds in them.  There was a lake but after getting reports from others that they saw 4 dead birds and 1 fish belly up I decided against going in the water.  I arrived Friday evening and met tons of AIESECers and trainees from around the Czech Republic and danced up a storm.  I do have to mention that the AIESECers here know all the dance moves for just about any S Club 7 song!  Saturday people were still arriving...which meant more people for me to meet.  For breakfast they gave us 2 small baguettes, butter, and 2 slices of tomatoes...so I was starving until lunch came around (Garlic cheese soup, fried cauliflower and boiled potatoes).  But during that time I managed to play a little football (that's soccer to all you non-Europeans) with a bunch of guys.  Really fun because I think my rugby instincts kicked in and I started to be a little rough and managed to push the biggest guy over hurting his knee...he was fine by time nightfall came!  I also managed to squeeze in a game of volleyball.  Then in the evening we ate the pig that had been slow roasting in the fire pit all day long.  They put beer and seasonings on the pig as it roasted. It was so good!   Even though it was good I had the worst case of traveller's diarhhea over the course of this week.  And as nightfall progressed the fun continued.  I played a real interesting game called Mafia....basically like playing clue or a murder mystery but instead you are trying to discover who in the group is the Mafia and who are the innocents.  This was when Gina my dorm neighbour left.  She took off when I was playing and didn't want to make a big stir when she was leaving and so she went silently, making sure to give someone my mobile.  I'm going to miss her!!!  However, Friday night Ayesha had arrived from Australia and she is pretty darn cool.  She even gave me a stuffed koala bear for all my helpful and informative emails on Karvina before she came.    Later that night I was approached by the MC to chair their Takeover initiations.  They all said I seem to have a lot of energy and that I'm fun.  Well little did I know that chairing meant to chair Topalky otherwise known as boat races.  My job was to start the races by consuming my beer and then giving everyone the okay to start the actual race.  My rugby friends know that I can't chugged beer for the life of me so I knew I was getting myself into trouble.  I got soooooo drunk!!! I'm not too sure how many races I started and re-started but it was a lot.  Everyone told me they thought I was so entertaining and funny and had a really good time. I'm surprised that I got up in time to catch the bus back to Karvina at 9:00 a.m. I was approached later to do Topalky at the National Conference in September I've opted to decline the position, giving the throne to the next unassuming trainee.    Well not much more happened.  This past week at work my boss went on vacation so things were pretty slack at work.  Traveller's diarhhea.  Watched the semi-final football match between Czech Republic and Greece at a local pub.  Czech Republic lost in overtime.  It sucked because they had so many shots on goal.  Oh well I had fun anyway chanting "Cesky" with all the bar patrons to cheer on their team.    Tonight is the Canada Day BBQ and then Saturday I'm off to spend the long weekend in Slovakia.  So I'm still keeping busy!!!   I guess this wasn't such a short update after all!!!  Take Care and keep in touch!!!!  Love and Kisses, Simone  View my blog at http://simonel_ca.blogspot.com/

       Well Happy Canada Day Everyone!!!!   Today I am spending Canada's Birthday working.  But I promise myself that I would work and spend limited time surfing the net and emailing everyone...so we'll see how that works! :0)    And tonight the AIESECers and I will watch the Euro Cup b/c the Czech football team (soccer) are in the semi-finals and will play against Greece.  Should be exciting!  My actual celebration of Canada Day will not happen until tomorrow when most people are available for major partying.  So Albert (Canadian trainee in Ostrava) and I will co-host a BBQ and hand out various Canadiana that we both have.  I plan on making a Canada Day Flag Cake that I found on the Food Network website....so wish me luck that all goes well.  Anyway just wishing everyone a Happy Birthday in Canada and celebrate it with pride!   urlLink I AM Canadian rant ...it brings warm fuzzy feelings of home!   urlLink Variations of the rant !  Love and Kisses, Simone :0)   I AM CANADIAN RANT   (clears throat)   Hey. I'm not a lumberjack, or a fur trader... and I don't live in an igloo or eat blubber, or own a dogsled... and I don't know Jimmy, Sally or Suzy from Canada, although I'm certain they're really, really nice.   I have a Prime Minister, not a President. I speak English and French, NOT American. and I pronouce it ABOUT, NOT A BOOT.   I can proudly sew my country's flag on my backpack. I believe in peace keeping, NOT policing. DIVERSITY, NOT assimilation, AND THAT THE BEAVER IS A TRULY PROUD AND NOBLE ANIMAL. A TOQUE IS A HAT, A CHESTERFIELD IS A COUCH, AND IT IS PRONOUCED 'ZED' NOT 'ZEE', 'ZED'!   CANADA IS THE SECOND LARGEST LANDMASS! THE FIRST NATION OF HOCKEY! AND THE BEST PART OF NORTH AMERICA!

      Hello Hello Hello!!!!  Interesting things to update you all on!!  July 30/04- Gerd made dinner for the whole AIESEC crew. He brought different sausages and this really cool tomato herb spread from Austria. Surprisingly the man can cook as well because on Sunday he made a great pasta dinner!!!!  July 31/04- I moved into the new trainee flat. And I realized that I brought a lot of things. It took me over the course of 3 days to bring my things over in batches to the flat. The dorm secretary gave me a hug and told me in Czech to visit and of course I will. In the flat, I chose the room with the most light. I have no closet space but 2 small cupboards to place my things. So I was livin' large in the dorms and now I'm livin' small. The flat is within walking distance to most things like the grocery stores, the square, and the train station...so that means no money spent on bus rides in Karvina. We went to Stodolni that night because Elnara (Ukrainian) was arriving very late  at 2:30 am but in Ostrava.  Stodolni was a blast as usual.  I managed to negotiate with a bartender to reduce the price of some cocktail from 100 -Kc to 50 -Kc.  I also got a drink for free for Ayesha aka I stole it when the bartender didn't notice.  And after almost 3 months I now can finally say that I kissed a Czech man.  Spoke little English but we locked lips for just a second.  And may I say he had soft lips.   August 1/04- Took Elnara grocery shopping and then to the tea room. She is a very skinny and small. She is also very very quiet. Her accent is so thick that I have troubles understanding her. But so far I find I don't get along with her....yes I said I don't get along with her. She makes these little comments every once in a while that tend to be rude. I know cultural understanding but I don't have to take it. For example, one day she was making soup but wanted a ladle to serve the soup. I told her that we only had the little spoons and told her to use a cup or something to take it out. And you know what she said..."You must not cook often!!" Ouch, eh?! All I did was make a suggestion!!! Anyway, we had a welcome dinner for Elnara at the flat and Ayesha and I got scolded for talking to people in the bar the night before by the AIESECers....don't quite understand it as we talked to them in the bar not on the street or in the train station where there are more dodgy looking people. They told us that it is not safe to talk to strange people because they will take advantage of the English speakers. And we were also told again not to speak to the gypsies. I'm actually quite annoyed with this but I can do whatever I like and make my own judgement about whether I feel safe or not. I realize they know more about their own country but telling me not to talk to someone...I think not!!!  August 4/04- I got to help out with the advance English class instead of the beginners at work. I talked about Edmonton and they got to ask me questions...it was fun because they are much more confident in their skills!! And just before that my boss invited me to go shopping with her because she needed to buy a birthday gift for her husband. I had to decline as it was roast chicken day and saukerkraut soup for lunch. Later in the night we all went to see Dirty Dancing 2. It was okay especially because it was in English with czech subtitles...the AIESECers laughed when I bought my ticket because I asked the ticket lady if the movie was czech...I had to practice the asking with my new czech phrase!! I just have to mention that Patrick Swayze makes an appearance in the movie which adds the "cheese" factor to the movie!!  August 5/04- I met up with Albert (Canadian trainee in Ostrava) to take over his English teaching lessons. I will teach 3-5 women from an accounting firm all of which are beginners. I met with the boss to discuss payment and the date/time of the lessons. So next week will be the true test of my skills in teaching my native language.  Whatelse...still have no work to do. Had a talk with my boss about work again and she wasn't sure what she wanted me to do either. I suggested to get me involved in more in the marketing activities in the company, so we'll see what happens....especially since on Monday Kirsten (Germany) arrives and she will work in my company as well. And although I would love to extend my traineeship I am doing nothing so I might still come home in October. After the talk I showed Mrs. Grafova the book I brought about Edmonton. I think she enjoyed it because she had many questions!  That's all this week....a little boring...none of my usual wit and charisma in the writing today as I'm very tired. Next week the last two trainees arrive...one from Germany and one from Russia.  Love and Kisses, Simone
