       Yesterday, I spoke to a man who claimed to be a professor at UCLA....within his rants, and his superior speech I heard a desperate individual, who just needed some help. Why do we feel the need to mask ourselves in thrifty words, and exaggerated punctuation?      "I remember waiting for you to come  Remember waiting for you to call  Remember waiting there to find nothing at all  I remember waiting for you to come  Remember waiting for you to call  Waiting there to find nothing at all  Maybe someday  You`ll really get to know me  Not just from letters read to you  I pray I get the chance  To make it up to you  We gotta lot of catching up to do"   ~ The Saddest Song (Ataris)

        Today I listened to the frantic ravings of several distraught individuals. Those whose products are a pile of shite, and those who cannot figure out how to do anything for themselves. It would appear to me, that those who are completely capable in life, use those who aren't as capable to do their dirty work, so that they can sit and gripe about all of the effort they are NOT putting into their lives on a daily basis.   Go Figure. I almost burped into the ear of one individual who told me " YOU have to do this for me, you owe me." Well...to owe someone first of all I would have needed to have utilized them in some manner previously to become ever-so-indebted. Which in this case, I did not, nor will ever. After a gentle reminder that I am just the cruddy middle-woman, I have no lee-way. I am just a corporate lemming, they decided to start with the vulgar language. Which to tell you the truth, I find hysterical.... and to be completely honest  prodded and plucked at the person a li'l bit more for my own personal enjoyment and gain. Yes, I know, I'm a horrible example of the decent person.   urlLink    Sue Me.        Here is how I feel today.....Perturbed, blazee, and exasperated.    Unsealed, on a porch a letter sat  Then you said, 'I wanna leave it again'  Once I saw her on a beach of weathered sand  And on the sand I wanna leave it again, yeah...  On a weekend, I wanna wish it all away, yeah...  And they called and I said that I want what I said...  And then I call out again...  And the reason, oughta' leave her calm, I know  I said, 'I know what I wear, not a box or the bag'  Ah yeah...can you see them?  Out on the porch, yeah, but they don't wave  I see them, round the front way, yeah...  And I know and I know I don't want to stay  Make me cry...   ~ Eddie Vedder ( Pearl Jam) Yellow Ledbetter

       I want to give you something.  Will you accept it, no questions asked?  Either way, here it is....        "There are books lined, row by row.  Each filled with words, like these  But words are but meanings  and chains that tie us, bind us to this place  We are organized, compulsively by index, by pain  Some of our pages are torn out, posted and framed  Others are strewn about, soiled, and ripped in two."     Now it's up to you, take it and make what you will. I only wrote these words to give more meaning. I only speak these words to those with feelings. It's nice to be safe within my hole.   C

      I feel incoherent, alone. The lapse of voice and everything in between seems surreal to me. I feel heavy, as I witness the world encircle me, and race me into it's vast quarters.   Somewhere between here and there I lost my willpower, I am not blossuming, and fear I never will. I will myself to learn, to seek, to strive, but I drag myself along as if it were to painful. I am neurotic, yet I am content.    I don't want clever conversation, I never want to work that hard. I just want someone that I can talk to...."   C

         Dear gawd....make the pain stop.    I cannot digest anymore gummie bears, or I'll burst. Bet you thought I was going to say something pretentious and whiney eh? Christ I'm bored. I'm so bored that I need a new hobby. Counting the amount of hairs each of my cats lose a week does not thrill and excite me as it should. Go figure?! It's time to do some remodeling to this place. I signed a lease one year ago this week. And the only thing that has accumulated is dust. Oh, and dead air. I need to locate my chequebook :    In honor of my commitment to one year in one place, I'm going to give....a little song from Dido to you :)          I haven't ever really found a place that I call home  I never stick around quite long enough to make it  I apologize that once again I'm not in love  But it's not as if I mind  that your heart ain't exactly breaking   It's just a thought, only a thought   But if my life is for rent and I don't learn to buy  Well I deserve nothing more than I get  Cos nothing I have is truly mine   I've always thought  that I would love to live by the sea  To travel the world alone  and live more simply  I have no idea what's happened to that dream  As there's really nothing left here to stop me   It's just a thought, only a thought   But if my life is for rent and I don't learn to buy  Well I deserve nothing more than I get  Cos nothing I have is truly mine   While my heart is a shield and I won't let it down  While I am so afraid to fail so I won't even try  Well how can I say I'm alive   If my life is for rent…

       urlLink  The Covers Project          And that's a bit of how I feel about society today. Have I mentioned lately that I am cronically deranged? Or that I deserve a nice white rubber room in a very quiet sterile serene setting?   But this is not news. Ah...I have sought counsel. No, I haven't been greeted by dancing babies, or Tom Jone's jingles, but close. It's been more to the liking of revelations of life. Instead of living in a constant world of denial, I have run into a massive granite wall of my own emotional bliss. In other words I'm crying, and there's not corks big enough to stop the water from running out consistantly. The doctor classifies this as depression, I refer to this as a massive pain in my ass.   In praise to my sudden mental utopia I giveth thee this:        Stand up  You've got to manage  I won't sympathize  Anymore   And if you complain once more  You'll meet an army of me   You're alright  There's nothing wrong  Self-sufficience please!  And get to work   And if you complain once more  You'll meet an army of me   You're on your own now  We won't save you  Your rescue-squad  Is too exhausted   And if you complain once more  You'll meet an army of me

         I taught you to play guitar last night.  We've been sick for days, and we were stuck inside.  And I held your arm as you hit the string.  I pressed your fingers down and started to sing.  And our heater was shaking cause the city was cold.  And my favourite guitar was between us to hold.  And I held your arm as you hit the strings.  I pressed your fingers down and started to sing, sing.     Last weekend I listened to the sounds of your average cover band,  reciting the lyrics to an old Billy Joel song. I wonder how many times since  1985 that song has be re-versed.         I am bored with life. I'm bored with most things,  I remember a time when I was excited about the day, eagerly anticipated tomorrow.  I have been lost again.  I hauled myself to the drug-dealer, told him my woes,  He wrote down on paper, the perfect fix.  She comes in a small pink round capsule.  But the pain she's given me is amidst.  I linger, I cry, I hurt, I yearn, I lie.    Hmm...that was very irresponsible. I'm getting weary again. Must go pretend to be happy   toodles for now   Char-lala

       Unaware. Uninterested. Unintrigued.  They are all focused, clear who speak around me.   I want to bleed them of their vast knowledge.  But then again, It must be even more frustrating. It must infuriate them, that I get quiet.  I just cannot find the strength to apologize, I just go on silently telling grey lies.  I am monotone. Maybe that infuriates me. I am slightly perturbed. I want to be the one who "knows".   I keep embarking on new things. Do I finish, is there an end result, am I brave, and strong?   And now they speak of "taking it up the ass".   I must go clean my eyes.        I think I understand  Fear is like a wilderland  Stepping stones or sinking sand     Joni Mitchell...is a queen

        Still falling     Breathless and on again     Inside today     Beside me today     A round broken in two     Til your eyes shed      Into dust     Like two strangers     Turning into dust     'Till my hand shook with the way      I fearI could possibly be fading     Or have something more to gain     I could feel myself growing colder     I could feel myself under your fate     Under your fateIt was you breathless and tall     I could feel my eyes turning into dust     And two strangers turning into dust     Turning into dust       &nbsp;   ~ Mazzy Starr "Into Dust, from Tonite that I Might See"       &nbsp;   &nbsp;    I have this extrodinary tendancy to completely over-react to the silliest of things.&nbsp; I wonder if this is a strictly feminine thing? Constantly noticing these irrelevant pieces of information, and extending them so that they become almost statuesque. Since is my last post for a bit, I thought I'd make it a good one.&nbsp; I found myself wondering today, what happened to time. I suddenly feel like the past ten years have been a blur. Like I closed my eyes and one day awoke to find myself staring at this person I barely know.&nbsp; I miss whatever niavety I had as a youth.&nbsp; I thought I knew so much then....ah yes, she is wise and all-knowing. I wish that no other individual would come to me seeking advice of any sort.&nbsp; My mind plays tricks with me.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I want to trust my emotions.      &nbsp;    How is it you see me       Do the colors change, fade,       Obscure the view?   &nbsp;    Do you speak to me of clarity,       when perhaps I am nothing but solid and strange?       She is complicated,        layers of cloth ripped in two.        If you were to peer close enough       Trace each line with your fingertips,       What is it that you would feel?       Bumps and valleys       Places where time has taken her tender toil.        Please have patience with her.        She is not wise in the ways of love.       Just wrap her in your arms.       Make us believe.        C.e.S. (27/07/04)          &nbsp;       &nbsp;

        What did I give to you, what did you give to me     A nothing trail of silences that warp in the rain     You said I don’t really know the reason, it’s just not the same     Oh what a vacant breath when you say my name     Do you know the weight I’m under     When everything revolves around you     Soon the shoulder falls....     All forgotten handshakes names like falling leaves     Apathy will spread like wildfire, take you away from me     I’m leaning out the window gonna catch the August rain     I’m gonna fill your mouth up, make you live again     Do you know the weight I’m under     When everything revolves around you     Do you know the weight I’m under     When everything revolves around you     Soon the shoulder falls......      Sarah Slean ~ Weight....      08/24/04 ~      I'm starting this b/c I no longer know how to express...everything inside of me is glowing.&nbsp; I hear children laughing outside of my window. I feel the summer breeze. I wonder....do they know?&nbsp; Do they grasp the relevence in this joy?&nbsp; The are so much more naive than we were as youth.&nbsp; Their tiny heads filled with USELESS knowledge.....the many words that are supposed to empower them, give them freedom of thought.&nbsp; Just another way of molding society? They are so unaware, so fearless. My heart aches just thinking.....    Could it be that I've been swept over by bitter rain? I want to crash into happiness. Revel in the magic of not worrying.&nbsp; I keep hearing the voices, seeing the pain, and being surrounded by this grief.&nbsp; I feel so selfish. To be groping at this keyboard, being allotted the joy and time given to me.&nbsp; I feel selfish for being so full of tears. So angry for being so un-appreciative of what the world has had to offer me.&nbsp; Time has made me grief stricken, I keep seeing the apathy that keeps growing around me. Perturbed at wanting happiness, for craving bliss....when by every divine right I should be.....content.       You want to change the world. We all have such large hopes, grand dreams. The simplicity in speaking such....and the complacent way to which you weild your tools.&nbsp; Of tongue, of pen, of type, and of blood.&nbsp; I envy those who speak with their hands.&nbsp; For they take the time to listen with their eyes. Instead of leaping from word to word with ease and rush. &nbsp;       I'm just tired. Ignore my ramblings, go get a beautiful song.....     Armies and ice and dirty green     Newspapers shovels sand on the breeze     I think of Eliot when I smell the street     And it’s sometimes wise just to shut your eyes     Workers and lovers make their living space neat     Bent out of shape over what to eat     I dream of Eliot but I am discrete     Cause its sometimes wise just to shut your eyes     How sure how right     Can anyone be on sight?     I said I had hope     I lied     The city in winter, the sewage the steam     You fill buildings with people     And they rip at the seams     And somebody’s suffering infected my dreams     And don’t they know?     It’s just my old soul     How sure how right     Can anyone be on sight?     I said I had hope     I lied     So calm so wise     Give him the Nobel prize     He said he had hope     He lied       Sarah Slean

          Today, I went outside, floated on the streets, amidst a tapdance of the clouds tears.....all along the way, I hummed this melody....       "Snow can wait I forgot my mittens      Wipe my nose      Get my new boots on      I get a little warm in my heart      When I think of winter      I put my hand in my father's glove      I run off where the drifts get deeper      Sleeping beauty trips me with a frown      I hear a voice      You must learn to stand up for yourself      Cause I can't always be around, He says      When you gonna make up your mind      When you gonna love you as much as I do      When you gonna make up your mind      Cause things are gonna change....so fast      All the white horses are still in bed      I tell you that I'll always want you near      You say that things change my dear"      Winter ~ Tori Amos     Sometimes it hurts, remembering.&nbsp; So you scrap what little thoughts you keep stored away, and start anew.&nbsp; This year I start over... I reach into a new bag of shiny jewels, and set them all in a twisted intricate pattern, that only I have control over.&nbsp; This year I will twinkle and gleam, as brightly as  'W'  did when she still wandered around my dreams and days.&nbsp; Occasionally I smell her.&nbsp; The mixture of pink  Oil of Olay   & Honey tea. &nbsp; Then, there are days where she enters my movements, my speech.&nbsp; I love those days, I positively feel blessed to have been cared for by such a beautiful spirit.&nbsp; I used to feel so guilty, for not showing her how much I loved her, how much she meant to me.&nbsp; I remember the day I asked her what I could do....and she replied  "Can you take away my pain? Can you make the pain stop, make it all end?" &nbsp; I couldn't make her stop hurting, I couldn't&nbsp; release her from all that took over, every fearful dream, every shattering memory.     Oh,  'W' &nbsp; I want to be brave.&nbsp; I want to show this world what is inside of me what I have to give, what I possess that is useful, that is miraculous.&nbsp; But where do I begin?     Yours forever      Charmaine

       urlLink     Heehee...:) When lack of sleep comes, I hastily resort to this wonderful blogger, go me :)    My Invitation       You are what they call the human season  You are all the alphabet in one  You are every colour of confusion  You are all the silence I've become   Love me for  Stupid reasons  I like those most   Wide-eyed but  Worth believing  God knows   Damn the angry voice that keeps us quiet  The editor whose work is never done  Keeping pretty words between my teeth and  Sweet confessions underneath my tongue   Drowsy contemplation  Do I let you in  This is my invitation  But how do I begin?   She has such an awful lot of soldiers  Quite a lovely army all her own  Night and day they stand before the fortress  Very safe but very all alone     It's easier to express this way, than to talk these days...to leave the trace of others words, to define something totally different, than what they perhaps initially intended. Wow, that was rather wordy.   Anywho. Did I mention I hate packing, and weddings...both generally cause me to go to tears, may they be of absolute bliss, or complete and utter anxiety. :  Someone once told me that I needed to exhale. Perhaps this is what I am doing...:)   Little Soldiers  September 17 2001 at 4:26 PM   CESmith   They line up against the door of blackened cast iron,  Marching two by two, their tiny feet making the sounds  which are only heard in a room of glassy silence.   Making an about turn, stomping one foot,  They stand guard around the black box,  All stiff and,almost doll-like.   The starless box pulsates, it ignites into luminous facade,  Trying to grasp at what is beyond the thick walls.   At once it appears, trying to elude the barriers the tiny men have built around it.  It pushes them out of the way...row, after row, the small soldiers fall down.   The door creaks open, the two embrace into one resonating, mangled ball of light Encompassing all of which dwells in it's perimeter.   Then the brilliance fades to grey, merging together, and wasting away.  I wonder if I have lost it, that which I have yet to find?   :) From me....g'nite

        Tiger, Tiger, burning bright  In the forests of the night,  What immortal hand or eye  Could frame thy fearful symmetry?   In what distant deeps or skies  Burnt the fire of thine eyes?  On what wings dare he aspire?  What the hand dare seize the fire?   And what shoulder and what art  Could twist the sinews of thy heart?  And when thy heart began to beat,  What dread hand and what dread feet?   What the hammer? What the chain?  In what furnace was thy brain?  What the anvil? What dread grasp  Dare it's deadly terrors clasp?   When the stars threw down their spears,  And water'd heaven with their tears,  Did he smile His work to see?  Did he who made the lamb make thee?   Tiger, tiger, burning bright  In the forests for the night,  What immortal hand or eye  Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?    Blake makes me swoon. I hate working on national holidays. It's so quiet here, so dead, so boring. I need to get home, pack like it's nobody's business, then crash for the night. I woke at 8:45am today, not so wide eyed...and rarely bushy tailed. Instead, I rolled over, stared at the wall, then at my cat, and then crawled out of my bed. Today was an "I'm awake, shut up, and now I'm walking" kinda morning. Where everything looks grey, and tired, and smells fragrant and alive.   Gotta go back to my redundant job now.....

        you give me that look that's like laughing with liquid in your mouth like you're choosing between choking and spitting it all out like you're trying to fight gravity on a planet that insists that love is like falling and falling is like this feels like reckless driving when we're talking it's fun while it lasts, and it's faster than walking but no one's going to sympathize when we crash they'll say "you hit what you head for, you get what you ask" and we'll say we didn't know, we didn't even try one minute there was road beneath us, the next just sky i'm sorry i can't help you, i cannot keep you safe i'm sorry i can't help myself, so don't look at me that way we can't fight gravity on a planet that insists that love is like falling and falling is like this.       The other night I was wrapped in those arms. I felt so secure, so safe. Then like wildfire, the arms rushed away, and in came the fear again.  I keep telling myself the only one who can save me from this nightmare, is me. I tell myself to shut up, to flick the off switch, like I can control when and why these occurances happen.  It's so funny how I feel the need to make apologies for this behavior, this hurt I feel.   Today, I made no apologies, today I feel whole. I feel embraced in grace and cheer. Even tho I am akward, and incredibly silly.  Today people see me. Bee told me the other day that I've come a long way. She reminded me as I sniffled and sobbed, that a couple of months ago there were "WEEKS" where I didn't make it to work. It warms my heart to think I'm advancing. But these set-backs. They scare me more than the weeks in bed did.  I want to breathe easy, be fully completely Char-lala.  Not just most of the time. All of the time. I'm tired of bitching and whining about something that is beyond my control.                I also cannot promise this to others. That frightens me. That I cannot be this happy all of the time. That there is inconsistency in my cheer.   I think that is what has held me back from having meaningful relationships with others. The fear of showing them my weakness.  Which in itself is a weakness.  Am I ever rambling today.              how can i go home with nothing to say i know you're going to look at me that way and say what did you do out there and what did you decide you said you needed time and you had time you are a china shop and i am a bull you are really good food and i am full i guess everything is timing i guess everything's been said so i am coming home with an empty head you'll say did they love you or what i'll say they love what i do the only one who really loves me is you and you'll say girl did you kick some butt and i'll say i don't really remember but my fingers are sore and my voice is too you'll say it's really good to see you you'll say i missed you horribly you'll say let me carry that give that to me and you will take the heavy stuff and you will drive the car and i'll look out the window and make jokes about the way things are how can i go home with nothing to say i know you're going to look at me that way and say what did you do out there and what did you decide you said you needed time and you had time          Ani Difranco "You Had Time" "Falling Is Like This"           Night all :)       Char-lala
