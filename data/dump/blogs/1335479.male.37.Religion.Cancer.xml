      Just finished moving Tomoko.  Lots of help (Justin, Mark and Naoto) and we succeeded in getting everything done in one trip with three vehicles.  Pray for Tomoko and her daughter Momoko to adjust to living with her parents and for Tomoko to be healed.

      Steve Poppert was the leader of the construction ministry team that first came over two years ago to build our church.  He is currently in  urlLink Hermosillo, Mexico  building houses for the poor.  Steve wrote me today.    Jonathan,  As I sit here in Mexico looking at what the Lord has done in Ome, tears of joy come . To see the  urlLink  children   with masks on working on their classroom is awesome.To realize the truth of Jeremiah 29:11 A future and a hope,is beyond words.  Who would of thought that 2 years ago God knew the very children and families that would call Grace Christian Fellowship their church, and that they would need to be apart of building it.  Oh Lord You are to wonderful to Imagine.  Dios De Bendiga mi Pastor  Steve

      Just had a good prayer meeting.  Devotions on 1 Corinthians 13 and the more excellent way of love and then prayed as the Spirit led for more love and more power in our church and lives.

      The second thing I am working on is our 2nd year anniversary party.  No I am not cooking up dinner!  I am cooking up videos and slideshows of all that God has done here the last two years.  You can get a taste of some of this on our urlLink  AV page  .  I have had a blast with iMovie and iPhoto making lots of little documentaries.  In a bilingual setting a picture (or movie!) can truly be worth a thousand words.

      Two things I am working on today.  The first is get copies of all of our coursework here at Grace in order so that anybody who teaches it can get it.  So far we have five courses in English and Japanese.     A New Beginning  	Matthew 5-7  Sermon on the Mount 	Basic Relationship with Christ and Discipleship   Following Christ	  	Matthew 10-13  Sending out the Twelve        Learning More About Our Lord   Ministry    	John 13-17  Upper Room Discourse 	Ministry Fundamentals   Power   	Acts 1-12 	Spirit Filled Church   Mission    (In Progress) 	Acts 13-20 	Spirit Led Missions

      Every Thursday is my day to write the  urlLink  prayer update  .  Actually what I do is pray about what we need prayer about.  I also choose a Bible verse out of the passage that we will study on Sunday and use it as a brief devotion.    Ministry in Japan is a lot like trying to walk through waist-high mud.  You don't get anywhere fast!  Nothing works unless the way is prepared by prayer.  I have seen many well-meaning people come and go with the next great idea to reach Japan.  They are often met with the words, "That might have worked in America, but it won't work here."  And sure enough, it doesn't!  But the fault is not with these ideas -- it is with the lack of prayer.  Without prayer anything we do is doomed to fail.  With prayer even our worst ideas are made effective by God's grace.

      Next project is to put Yoshiko's excellent Bible verse  urlLink  graphics   up on the corresponding prayer update pages.  Yoshiko is also a Christian cartoonist who has her work published monthly in  urlLink Gospel for the Millions  and also has a number of  urlLink books  on Christian life. She has just finished a new book about Christianity as seen through the movies. It should be coming out soon!

      Working today on the story of Balaam and Balak -- incredible story!  I especially like how Balaam tells the envoys from Balak how he won't go with them, not even if they offer him a whole house full of silver and gold. (hint, hint)    I have also been thinking about our children's ministry.  We now have four classes and the baby room but they are all full.  There is room for one more class in the library by the stage but it would need to be a quiet group -- maybe jr-highers?  It also might be possible to divide one of the rooms upstairs into two.  But I think even more than space the real issue is getting more teachers and translators.  Pray for wisdom!

      Mission 1  Spent most of today plotting out the 12 week course on missions, and writing the first lesson.  It is good to be working with new material again.    Finished teaching the first class, went well.  Taught about the first missionaries, Barnabas, Paul and John Mark who went to Cyprus.

      My daughter Gracie is here with me today after I picked her up from pre-school as mommy went to visit an old friend.  Gracie is drawing pictures of flowers and horsies and butterflies while I work.  Yasuko Fleming also dropped by and we worked on four new Japanese translations for worship.  "Forever", "Here I Am To Worship", "Draw Me Close", and "Jesus, Lover of My Soul"  We are getting to be a good team!

      Rie and I have been living in Ome for the last 14 years.  We took a brief jaunt over to Higashi-Kurume for a couple years back when Keita, our son, started school.  But we returned to Ome in 2000 and ended up planting Grace Christian Fellowship in 2001.  I grew up in Jacksonville, Oregon in a town that was surrounded by hills and forests where everyone knew everyone else.  Ome has a bit of that kind of flavor although it is much larger.  It is surrounded by hills on three sides so I am able to take morning walks through some really beautiful scenery.    Much of what is on the web about Ome is in Japanese of course, but today I scoured the web trying to find everything out there in English that I could! Let's start it out with a very general site about  urlLink  Ome City   and some pictures like these ones of the  urlLink  Fireworks Festival   and a local Japanese man's site with  urlLink  lots of Ome stuff  .  Japanese are crazy for trains so here is the   urlLink  Ome Line Train Stations Guide   and some pictures from the  urlLink  Ome Train Park  .  One of the weirder stories I came across was about  urlLink  Super Pigs   that researchers are breeding right here under my nose at the Ome agricultural research farm.  Who knew?  But porkers aside, it is so nice to be out here in the country, even though it is Tokyo!  One of best things about Ome is the  urlLink  Tama River!    Here is a cool  urlLink  movie   of a guy going down the rapids.  If you like to  urlLink  Hiking   and getting  urlLink  outdoors   like me, Ome is great.  While you are up there be sure to drop in and see  urlLink  Okutama Bible Chalet.    Near Ome station is an area that wasn't bombed during the war and escaped any real development afterwards as well.  It is a kind of old town and has a lot of old 30's or "Showa" movie posters.  It has a very  urlLink  "retro"   feel to it that is pretty cool.  If you get the chance you can also take in the  urlLink  Kimono Museum   or go see a Canadian I met yesterday who does  urlLink Japanese woodcut printing.   This guy is a real craftsman!  There is a whole lot more to do like the things put together in this  urlLink  Travelog    So now you have a little better idea of Ome where we live and minister.  Pray for this little city and its people!

      Last night I went to visit a group of merchants from near Ome-station.  They are trying to promote business in the downtown area of Ome which is a kind of "old" town.  Yayoi from our church is one of these merchants and has an import and craft shop called  urlLink  "Marylou"    In the shop there are a couple of tables where customers can sit and have a cup of tea, look at some magazines or sit and talk.  Rie, my wife, holds a Bible study here twice a month and Yayoi has one of our posters up on the wall.  Last year Yoshiko decided to come to Grace after seeing that poster at Marylou.

      Last night I taught on missions focussing in on Paul and Barnabas' ministry in Iconium.  What impressed me most was their willingness to preach the gospel boldly in the face of opposition.  They did not take a step back after the opposition in Antioch of Pisidia and try to reevaluate and modify their method or message so that it would be less offensive.  Let's pray for boldness to preach despite persecution or threats of violence.

      I need to confess that one of the casualties of the war in Iraq has been my devotional life.  It have been turning on the tv or radio to check the latest reports rather than turning them off to check the latest from the Lord.  This morning I took a prayer walk up in the mountains behind my house where the cherry trees are in bloom.  It felt really good!  I need that time with the Lord much more than I need to know what is going on in Iraq.

      Tonight we remember what Jesus did for us on the cross.  I am planning on doing a traditional service with worship and reading of the seven words spoken by Jesus on the cross.  After each word is spoken we will extinguish one of seven lights until there is only one light left.  With the last light we will all quietly leave the church and close the doors and await the joyous news of Jesus' resurrection on Sunday morning.    Those of you from a liturgical or "high" church background will recognize footwashing and Tennebrea.  Those of you from a more free and casual church background will wonder what we are up to with these "rituals".  When rituals occur year after year without explanation they can become old and stale and meaningless.  But when they are used afresh they can be very powerful ways of communicating essential truths.  In our context of Japan, there is always something lost in the translation.  So acting out God's truth is a powerful way for people to know Him.

      Tonight we will have a footwashing service here at Grace.  I simply love the awesome symbolism of this act, that the Lord of all creation would stoop down to wash His disciples feet.  Jesus then said to His disciples that if He washed their feet then they ought to wash one another's feet.  What does it mean?  It means that if you can't forgive people then you can't serve them.  There will always be a reason not to serve.  They "need" to learn to do it for themselves, they should respect their elders, they haven't served like they should, it is not your ministry, it is not your job -- the excuses go on and on.  But Jesus didn't give any excuses, He simply gave us His example.  Let's follow His example.

      I am really enjoying this little book by Joseph L. Cannon a missionary in Japan about a generation ago.  It is called "For Missionaries Only" and is full of wonderful nuggets.  Here is an excerpt entitled   Jack of All Trades, Master of None      What is a missionary?  What is he supposed to do?  I have never met a missionary that wasn't  an astute juggler of many balls, a switch hitter who played all the positions, a chameleon called upon to reflect every situation, a variety store, a mulligan stew, a strange mixture of heaven and earth.  think of what a missionary is called upon to do, and what he does.  he is a financier, a public relations man, a fund raiser.  He must be an educator, a personnel director, an able administrator.  he must be a linguist, a translator, interpreter, author, and publisher.  He must be a practicing physician, nurse and first aid man, a counselor, anthropologist, and sociologist.  he is expected to be an English language expert, an ambassador of his country, to have a keen insight inot national and international politics, and alwasy be able to take the right position on any problem that arises.  He is a philanthropist, organizer and operator of benevolent institutions, a lecturer, orator, and teacher of many things.  We might add that he preaches the gospel once in a while, too!   We have a saying, "Circumstances alter cases," and this aptly applies to the role of the missionary.  The missionary's own background, education and inclination effect his role.  What a missionary does and can do is determined, also, by how old he is, how long he has been on the field, the education level of a people, the climate of the country, the economic level of its society and the political stability of an area.  All are factors that influence the work of a missionary.     A changing world can mean a changing role for the missionary.  But there is one trade the missionary must be master of to deserve the name.  I want to emphasize that the missionary is primarily a gospel preacher, a bearer of good news.  His work is to save souls.  There should be only one mission for his life, one role that must supersede all others, in order to be worthy of the name "missionary."  This is the unchanging role assigned by the Great Commission, "Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel..."     In too many cases, the missionary becomes a Martha, troubled and worried about many things.  He needs to hear the Lord when He says, "Only one thing is needful," and like Mary, choose the better part.  Though he may be busy doing many good things, if he fails to proclaim the gospel, he will see fruit without a tree, light without a sun, water will blow and nothing will remain.  His field of many labors will be a valley of dry bones.  He will have failed because, among the accumulated wares of a life with many roles, he will have left dust-covered, and neglected, the most important role of all -- his mission to seek and save the lost.        Oh Lord, that I would stay focussed on the one mission that supersedes all the rest!

      Went with the family to the twice annual Thrift Shop at Christian Academy in Japan (CAJ).  This is an IMPORTANT missionary function on a number of levels.  First of all it allows you to get rid of all the junk you have accumulated, outgrown, grown bored of, or just want to get rid of!  We loaded up the van!  Oh man I love getting rid of stuff.    The next aspect of this is that you get to sift through everyone elses junk and find a few treasures, which for me means books.  Here is what I got.  Watchman Nee:   The Spiritual Man  Changed into His Likeness The Messenger of the Cross  Operation Japan K.P. Yohannan:  Revolution in World Missions Will Roger's World Roland Allen:   Missionary Methods: St. Pauls or Ours? The Spontaneous Expansion of the Church  Kenneth Dale:  Coping With Culture: The Current Struggle of the Japanese Church F.B. Meyer: 1 Peter Myths about Missions Carson:  Collosians and Philemon Morris: 1 & 2 Thessalonians Stott:  Galatians Swindoll: Galatians Biography of Dawson Trotman of the Navigators C.S. Lewis and Francis Schaeffer For Missionaries Only  And finally, the best part is that you get to catch up with all the other missionaries and see what they have been up to.   urlLink  Talo   and  urlLink  Rod   are pastoring two new happening churches downtown.  It was good to talk to Ken and Paul as well, they are on the very edge of something great, but we will have to wait until they get a website up.  (Come on guys!)

      Very interesting thought about  urlLink  Christian Art   and its major and minor themes.  Let's continue to major on the majors!  There are a lot of minor points out there but they are simply the shadows and dissonance that serve to make the great truths of God's grace shine more brightly.

      Art!!!  Oh we need more of this stuff.  Here is a set of really great teaching on art for Christians.  Go and check this out.  I found this on  urlLink Bob Bennett's website  by the way.  For those of you who don't know Bob has one of the best voices around and a real heart for God.     At  urlLink Capo Beach Calvary , Pastor Chuck Smith, Jr. has just completed a series on "Christianity & the Arts".  There have been teachings on film, photography, architecture, sculpture, etc.  And there were four teachings on the subject of music.  The final two music sessions were on December 5th and 12th, 2002 and I assisted in the latter part of those evenings.  The church website has also posted some of my  urlLink commentary  about music we listened to.  As of this writing (December 18, 2002), most of these messages are available online:     urlLink Art and the Christian Faith  (May 30, 2002)  The Role of Literature in Christian Thinking (June 13, 2002)   urlLink Narrative  (June 20, 2002)   urlLink Poetry  (June 27, 2002)   urlLink Visual Arts  (August 8, 2002)   urlLink Portrait of Jesus  (August 15, 2002)   urlLink Spiritual Benefits of Visual Arts  (August 22, 2002)   urlLink Discerning Art  (August 29, 2002)   urlLink Icons  (September 12, 2002)   urlLink Film  (September 26, 2002)   urlLink Movies  (October 3, 2002)   urlLink Architecture  (October 10, 2002)   urlLink Architecture - 2  (November 7, 2002)   urlLink Music  (November 14, 2002)   urlLink Music - 2  (November 21, 2002)   urlLink Music - 3  (December 5, 2002)   urlLink Music - 4  (December 12, 2002)

      Oh man, I went into the local fast food Chinese restaurant "Bamiyan" and at the counter on the way out I noticed a little display of cross necklaces.  They were made of a kind of translucent plastic and came in a number of colors.  As I looked closer I noticed that each color was supposed to have a meaning and realized that they had one for money, another for good luck, and another for love.  Of course this is exactly the way that charms are sold at the temples and shrines with a particular charm for each thing.  Aargh!!!  We have a hard enough time already getting people to understand the cross without people making things like this.

      We got some free tickets that were about to expire so on Monday we got Keita, Gracie, Grandma, Grandpa, Rie and myself all packed into the car and headed off for  urlLink  DisneySea  .  DisneySea is Disney's new theme park next to Tokyo Disneyland.    It is a long drive from Ome to the other side of Tokyo so we left the house at 6:00!  We got on the expressway and wondered how our friends Mark and Renee were doing as they needed to drive to Narita Airport to pick up Mark's parents, missionaries from Africa.  Rie got on the cell phone and told them that we had just passed the 11.4 kilometer mark.  Renee called back that they had just passed the 11.2 kilometer mark.  They were only about 10 cars in front of us.  So we soon caught up with them and went through the downtown traffic jam together.    It was a drizzly morning but by afternoon the weather had turned really nice.  We started off with a  urlLink  gondolier   ride, then wandered over to hop the electric train in the American Waterfront to Port Discovery.  At Port Discovery we were going to ride the Aquatopia but they had it down for a bit, I think because of the rain.  So we ended up going to  urlLink  Ariel's Mermaid Lagoon.    This was great because it is all underground (or underwater!).  Grandpa and Gracie went for a Jellyfish ride, we all got some food and enjoyed Ariel's playground.  We also saw the show at the Theater.  Very cool show with excellent puppet work for most of the characters and Ariel flying around (swimming) for most of it.  The big Ursula Octopus is a bit over the top for some of the younger kids though.    The next stop was  urlLink  the Arabian Coast.    Here they have a "Magic Lamp Theater" but it is different than the one at Anaheim Disneyland.  The one in California is more of a comedy routine with audience participation for the little kids.  This one is a 3-D glasses movie with a stage performance built into it.  There are also a few surprises thrown in for kicks.  Of course it is all in Japanese but my son liked some of the one-liners.  After the show, we hopped over to see Sinbads voyage.  This is like "It's a small world" with lots of dolls, but the detail is really well done.  Next was the carousel.  This is Gracie's favorite and because of the rain and going on a monday both Gracie and Keita got to ride on the Genie.  There are two levels and four genie's on each level.  When they open the gate of course everybody wants to ride one of the genies so you have to run quick!  Gracie rode the pink one and Keita got the traditional blue.    About this time we were getting pretty hungry so we headed over to the American Waterfront and dined in the S.S. Columbia's dining room.  The food was ok, but the atmosphere is what is cool.  We were seated right by the pianist in his white tuxedo so I requested "When You Wish Upon a Star" for my little lady.  That was pretty fun to get a song played just for her.  Well we did a lot more but will write back later!

      Easter was awesome in many ways.  We did get rained out on the picnic, but had a great time as a love feast instead.  It is really hard to do a recap on something like worship.  It is one of those "you had to be there" kind of things.  I could tell you the logistics of how it went but that is just the surface level.  Suffice it to say that God showed up in the music, the testimonies, the kid's message, the worship dance, the message, the fellowship, even in just who He brought that day.  I really love serving a risen, living Lord!

       Technology just keeps on racing along at breakneck speeds changing the nature of what we are doing.  If you think back 150 years it is incredible how technology has brought the mission field closer.    1.  Travel  -- physically getting there is easier. 2.  Medicine -- staying physically well is easier. 3.  English -- English has become the 2nd language of the world, making being understood easier. 4.  Communication --  urlLink  Video  , Radio and the Internet have all made getting the word out easier.   Even in the last 15 years there have been significant changes in Japan that my life as a missionary.  When I first got here getting foods from my home country was next to impossible for somebody on a missionary budget.  On the rare occasion that we would go to a foreign specialty shop downtown and try to purchase something American we would go through sticker shock first.  Now there is a Costco only a half hour away!  Ditto for other products such as electronics with English language manuals or books and materials in English.  These days it is as easy as ordering something online.    Communication with home is as simple as starting up my computer.  If mom and dad are online I get them on the instant messaging and we can "chat" in real time.  The other day we even set up a web-cam and traded pictures back and forth.  When I first got here calling home meant that the telephone bill was going to be huge that month.   All of this means that it is easier for us missionaries to live here without getting as isolated and homesick as we used to.  But at the same time, it is easier to wrap ourselves in a "foreign" cocoon and never really become part of this community that we have come to reach for Christ.

Starting from scratch, not building on another's foundation.  Bringing souls to Christ who have never heard of Him before.  Reaching people with the gospel who never had a chance before.  Sharing to a little degree the ambition of the apostle Paul.  This is the missionary spirit!  This is the spirit of adventuring by faith!   What a great adventure it was for Christ to leave heaven and come to earth.  What challenges to His soul!  What a life of new and unforgettable experiences!  How worthwhile it was!  What happiness was brought to millions.  In missionary life, you go by faith into the unknown.  You bet your life on the promises and providence of God.  You are willing to take risks for the sake of the gospel.  Away with the life of self-centered coddling!  Away with the comforts of home!  Away with the false security of this world, and forward into the real security of dependence on God.  This missionary pushes  his frail bark into unknown seas.  This fool of Christ risks all, yet gains all.  What a joy to this happy pioneer to arrive in strange places, and find Christ is there.  To find Christ in the happy eyes of those who obey the preached gospel.  To teach songless hearts to sing, and see hopeless hearts begin to hope.  To go where there is no church of Christ and see born before your very eyes the kingdom of God.  This is what I like about the missionary life.     This too is what I like about the missionary life.  I went on my first missionary trip with the high school youth group when I was 16.  I came back from that trip to Mexico knowing that this was the life for me.

      Here is another excerpt from "For Missionaries Only"     The expert looked me in the eye and said, "What do you suggest we do to reach the missionary's goal of establishing indigenous churches?"  I didn't mean to be rude, but I answered, "That's not this missionaries goal."  My friend stiffened a little at this for he was of the persuasion that "the responsibility of the missionary on the field is to build self-governing, self-propagating, and self-supporting native churches."  I don't want to be contrary, but I have always thought of my goal and responsibility as a missionary in a different light.  With Paul, I feel like my responsibility is "to preach the gospel" and establish Christ-minded, Christ-loving, Christ-supporting Christians.  After all you can have self-governing, etc. churches that are selfish, not willing to love and help others.  It is possible to have a church of self-propagating devils.  You can have self-supporting, sectarian, and anti-every-good-work churches.     Here is another bit,     In the New Testament the whole church is described as one united body, with every one depending on the other, and local churches depending on each other, as per the text of this section (Eph 4:15-16).  Independence can mean isolation, and isolation death.  Interdependence can mean "bodily growth... up-building itself in love.     There is nothing that I want to see more as a missionary than the church to take off in Japan like a wildfire that spreads into every city and town.  For that to happen surely they will have to be Japanese (not missionary) churches.  But if I start trying to design for that to happen by putting artificial restrictions on the gospel then I am misguided.  If I say that I will only preach to Japanese, or only allow Japanese in my church, or only train up Japanese then I will be missing out on the other people that God wants to bring into His kingdom and wants to use to help bring in the Japanese.

      Got up this morning to walk and pray and it was raining.  It was not enough of a rain to keep me from walking but enough to give me an excuse not to.  I chose to walk.  The Lord gave me a verse on the walk that I feel is pregnant with meaning, it is a keeper.  I don't know yet what God wants to do in me with this one, but I feel that it is from Him.    "For as the earth brings forth its bud, as the garden causes the things sown in it to spring forth, so the Lord God will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations."  Isaiah 61:11    Pray that God would work understanding of this promise into my heart and life.

      I am reading a biography of Dawson Trotman, the founder of the Navigators and am having a hard time putting it down.  In many ways he reminds me of myself, a little guy full of energy and faith and a burden for lost souls.  But in other ways I am humbled as I see how this burden and his faith led him to increased prayer and discipline in his life.  Pray for me that I can learn much from this man.

      I am working today on an Equippers seminar to train people to study the bible on their own and to teach others. Ephesians tells us that God gives some gifts so that they can equip the saints for the work of the ministry and build up the body of Christ and 2 Timothy tells us that it is the scriptures that are to be used to equip us for every good work.  We are going to hold the first seminar this month on the 23rd and 24th.  My plan is to teach inductive bible study, actually how I study God's word so that they can dig out teachings of their own that are both scriptural and also fresh and real because they found it for themselves.  How I study the bible is first to  observe  what is really written there.  The trick is to get past what I think is written, what somebody else told me was written and what might be hidden by either language or culture that I might have missed.  The second part of my study is to  interpret  what is written.  Usually this means that I start asking questions -- how does this square with another passage dealing with the same topic?  What does this have to do with Jesus' example in the gospels?  What about the Old Testament?  I always let the Bible explain the Bible first.  Finally, I need to make the jump between knowledge about Scripture to  application  of it to my life.  The question I usually ask here is "So what?"  What difference does it make to my life that Paul didn't want Titus to get circumcised?  Usually this is the most difficult part of the process and requires the most prayer.  I chug through observation and interpretation like a steam train, slowly but surely it will all make sense.  But the application part is where I have to listen to God and allow Him to shape my heart and life.  It is also the part where all of my study can have the most impact for God's kingdom both in my life and also in the lives of those that I teach.

      Praise the Lord!  Renee is coming back tomorrow.  You never appreciate having a receptionist as much as when they are not there.  Renee has been hosting her in-laws these past two weeks and I will be very glad to have her back.  Today I think I have felt it the most.  I have been working on the missions course for this evening and no sooner do I get started on it but the phone rings or one of the YWAM team members has a question.  Don't get me wrong, the phone ringing is a very good thing.  It means that there is life in the church!  But it is great to be able to ignore it!

      I think one of the things that strikes me about the book I am reading about Dawson Trotman is how God orchestrates the entrance of people into our lives at the appropriate times.  And how when they first appear on the stage we don't really know what kind of role they are going to play.  This impresses upon me the great need to give people grace when they first appear and to treat each new relationship as something that is potentialy extremely valuable.  Imagine if I had not welcomed this person, or not given that person my time at the beginning of the relationship.  I am praying that God would make me more sensitive to the value He puts on people.

      Yesterday Rie and I left the kids with the grandparents and headed to Tachikawa to take care of visa and driver's license things.  We first headed to the police station to get the licenses but we didn't get there before they closed up for lunch at 11:30.  So we went out for lunch and enjoyed a wonderful peaceful time together.  After lunch we decided to go by the immigration office first as it was closer to the restaurant.  Who did we meet at the immigration office but Paul and Nancy Nethercott (missionairies with TEAM).  So during the wait we got to fellowship with them and then give them a ride back to the station.  God's timing is truly wonderful!

      Another idea that I had yesterday came under the heading of "Riding on Public Transportation".  I thought that if I wanted to go to Shinjuku, I would not try to create my own road or my own way of going there but I would ride on the train or go on the road just like everybody else.  When the Apostle Paul travelled around the world preaching the gospel he did not create a new way, but followed the roads that the Romans had so ingeniously built.     So if I want to reach a certain community with the gospel it would only make sense to use the routes that already exist.  If I want to reach university students it makes no sense to create a new organization that then has to find a way in.  Instead we need to send Christians into the organizations that already exist -- not to change those organizations but to serve them.  But at the same time to serve Christ and lift up his name in that community.  We need to ride on public transportation.    Do we go to the head office of JR (Japan Railways) and ask permission to use the railways throughout Japan to spread the gospel?  No, we pay the fare and hop on just like millions of other people who are using it to get to work, or go to school or wherever.  We are just using it to get to our place of ministry.  Of course we have to abide by their rules and keep from inconveniencing other passengers but there is no reason why we cannot quietly share Jesus with the person sitting next to us.  In the same way we can be Christian members of a million different communities in our towns and cities, paying our fare, pulling our weight and playing by the rules of that community but at the same time sharing Christ by our words, actions and attitudes!    I can create a new community which I then try to pull people into, or I can go out into the communities that already exist find hundreds to share Christ with.  What communities are you a part of?  How can you be a better witness to Christ in that community?

      One of my biggest frustrations with doing ministry in Tokyo was that it was so big that I never felt like I was making a difference.  It seemed that I could lead someone to Christ on the train, or talk to someone about Jesus in a coffeeshop but then that person would live far away in Chiba or Saitama and we could never follow them up and help them to grow in Christ so that they could be a witness in their circles.  Ministry in Ome has been much better in this respect as here we are able to meet people again and again and follow them up.  The community is key.  Now there are communities like "Yotsuya Mura" all over Tokyo where people do know each other and there is opportunity for deeper ministry it is just that we need to find where those communities are.

      Yesterday Bryan Smith (YWAM Japan) and I went down to Shinjuku to pick up some futons that were being donated.  We had a good time of fellowship along the way and were able to get enough bedding to replace most of their worn out futons at the YWAM base.  The place we went to was a fugu (puffer fish) restaurant owned by one of our members' mother.  It used  to be a kind of Japanese inn so they offered to give us their futons.  Interesting that the neighborhood is one of very tiny streets and tiny shops and restaurants squeezed in between the office buildings and thoroughfares of Shinjuku.  The locals call this "Yotsuya Mura" or Yotsuya village because everybody knows everybody.  Bryan mentioned that over 4 million people pass through Shinjuku station a day, more than the population of his native New Zealand and yet there are pockets of community all over the city if we know where to find them.

      Rie and I, the kids and the grandparents are all in Jacksonville, Oregon.  We rented a minivan and drove from LA up to Santa Barbara and stopped by my college, Westmont, and then went to the pier and had crab sandwiches.  Rie has always loved those ever since we went to school there.  One day she went with a friend to that restaurant and asked for a "crab'' sandwich only to receive a "club" sandwich!  She was so disappointed but was too shy to say anything!  Well she is not too shy anymore.  From there we drove up to Solvang -- a little Danish town, where we had taken Rie's parents about 13 years before.  It was very "natsukashii'', or nostalgic.  The next day we drove along the coast to San Simeon and toured Hearst Castle.  Pretty amazing -- and also a great example of what happens to all the wealth that you amass in this life that you can never take with you when you die.  After San Simeon we drove up through Big Sur and some very gorgeous scenery along the coast of California and ended up in Monterey which has one of the best aquariums that I have seen anywhere and some pretty good clam chowder.  The third day we drove the rest of the way to Oregon and ended up in Jacksonville around 10pm.  It is amazing in America how far you can drive without finding anywhere to stop and rest. Grandma suddenly needed to stop as she was getting carsick, but there was really nowhere!  Not only was there no gas station or restaurant, but not even a bush or a tree to hide behind.  After three days in Oregon we are very relaxed and really enjoying it.  It was really great to go to church today and not have to do ANYTHING.

      "So I answered them, and said to them, "The God of heaven Himself will prosper us; therefore we His servants will arise and build, but you have no heritage or right or memorial in Jerusalem."  (Nehemiah 2:20)  Thank you Lord for prospering me, for setting me free from sin by the grace of Jesus Christ.  The enemy has no more hold upon me, no heritage, no right, not even a memorial that I might look back upon the "bad old days" with some sort of sick nostalgia.  I am through with being stuck in the mud and building with stubble and hay, I will arise by your grace and build with the everlasting gold and silver of heaven.

      I finished reading the biography of Dawson Trotman this morning.  I think there were four main values that this man of God inspires me to emulate.  1.  Personal Discipline -- Trotman planted the word of God in his heart, constantly memorizing scripture.  The results of this planting are evident in the vast impact that the man had on so many Christian leaders of his generation.  2.  Follow-Up -- Trotman went for years leading people to Christ only to see so many of them fall away.  His breakthrough came when he stressed personal discipleship of each person won for Christ.  God opened the door wide for this through the Billy Graham crusades.  3.  Working with Others -- Trotman never hesitated to work alongside other groups such as Graham, YFC, Young Life, Wycliffe and others.  He wasn't about making a name for himself or the Navigators, but about seeing the kingdom of God grow.    4.  Concentrating on a Few -- Trotman experienced working with multitudes and working with a few in a concentrated manner and found that the latter produced more long-lasting fruit.

      "O Lord, I pray, please let Your ear be attentive to the prayer of Your servant, and to the prayer of Your servants who desire to fear Your name; and let Your servant prosper this day, I pray, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man."  For I was the king's cupbearer."  (Nehemiah 1:11)   Lord, let me be a servant who is about Your business, who is concerned about the things about which You are concerned.  Lord, let me prosper today in Your sight and in the sight of men in so much as I am serving You.

      I got back last night with Grandma and Grandpa.  Rie and the kids are staying in Oregon for another month so as to spend time with my parents and learn more English.  I am very jet-lagged but doing good.  I drove straight through from Oregon to LAX, hopped on the plane, slept most of the way and then drove the three hours from Narita back to Ome.  It is rainy season here and you can tell the difference from Oregon from the moment you exit the plane.  You don't even have to see or hear anything Japanese, you can feel the difference!  I will write more when I am more awake.

      I have been steadily gaining weight ever since we started planting the new church two years ago.  I think there are four culprits involved.  1.  I live about 5 minutes by car from the church so I don't have to ride the train, and ride my bicycle to the station like before.  2.  Costco opened up a store nearby  3.  Air Force people keep bringing me goodies. 4.  Age.  So whereas my optimum weight is about 65 kg, last week I was closing in on 75 kg.  Not good.    So my plan is to get back into the 65 range by the time my wife and kids come back from the US.  So far it has been working pretty well.  I am down to 72 kg and I'm already starting to feel better. (I don't know anything about looking better yet.)  So how am I dieting?  Well the main thing is to cut out the snacks and pop, limit myself to regular meals, drink lots of water to keep my stomach full and increase exercise.  So far this has been working pretty well.  I played raquetball for the first time in 15 years last night and almost died!  Walked to church this morning and will go swimming tomorrow.  Just to keep me honest I am going to give a running count of my weight and exercise until my wife comes home on the blog.  Nothing like a little accountability to help with the old will power.

      "Every one of the builders had his sword girded at his side as he built. And the one who sounded the trumpet was beside me."  (Nehemiah 4:18)  It is easy to think that there are some who are trained "swordsmen" and some who are trained "builders" but the truth is that we don't have that luxury.  Each of us needs to have the sword of the Spirit, God's word, constantly at our side so that we don't become vulnerable to the attack of the enemy.  Those who are skilled at the use of the sword need to pass along that knowledge so that many can fight, rather than keeping it to themselves so that their position is secure.  Lord, help us to become a church that to the man is skilled with the use of the sword and to the man is willing to build for your kingdom.

      "And next to them Melatiah the Gibeonite, Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon and Mizpah, repaired the residence of the governor of the region beyond the River."  (Nehemiah 3:7)  In the midst of chapter 3 of Nehemiah where everyone is working on repairing the walls and rebuilding the gates, here are a few guys who are working on the house of the Persian regional governor.  This would probably just be the house that he would stay in when he was in town, but the fact that it needed repair meant that it had been pretty much ignored until then.  Sometimes even when the physical building is in full swing we still need to spend time and resources to build up and restore key relationships as well.    Lord, help me not to overlook key relationships.  Help us to keep the ones we have fully maintained and give us favor with those over us.

      "Then I sent to him, saying, "No such things as you say are being done, but you invent them in your own heart."  Nehemiah 6:8  The next trick Nehemiah's enemies thought up was to spread lies about what Nehemiah was trying to do.  Especially they wanted to make it appear as if he was disloyal to the King of Persia.  Actually this was really a threat to try to make them fearful so that they wouldn't complete the work.    When people lie about us it is not up to us to prove that they are lying, it is not up to us to defend ourselves.  We can trust that God will strengthen our hands and that He will defend our case.  We might think that people are believing their lies and that our situation is worsened, but in the long run all lies are exposed and it is those who spread lies who are the losers.

      "But they thought to do me harm."  Nehemiah 6:2b  By this time the work on the wall was almost complete, so the enemies of Israel turn their attacks toward Nehemiah himself.  One way these enemies worked was through distraction.  They wanted to meet together with him.  Nehemiah said, "Why should the work cease while I leave it and go down to you?"  Who should we meet with and why?  If we want to "ride public transportation" we need to make relationships with the gatekeepers of these organizations.  Nehemiah had a key relationship with the King of Persia and he was rebuilding the house of the Governor beyond the river.  So it is important to meet with these people.  It is also important to meet with our friends in the work.  There was a huge amount of coordination and cooperation that needed to take place and so Nehemiah needed to meet with the leaders of each group.  But Nehemiah didn't bother to go meet with his enemies because he knew that if he went "down" to their level he would get stuck in the muck and the work would suffer.

      Ok, went swimming on Saturday and tried to work out by walking against the current in the river pool.  After about 5 laps both legs cramped up on me.  They still hurt!  Pizza after swimming wasn't so bad as I limited myself to only 2 pieces.  Sunday was the marathon as usual with services, counseling and teaching.  But what is most interesting is the amount of food I consumed!  Curry rice for lunch -- pretty heavy stuff.  Then took a visitor out for dinner -- Nagoya style eel, very yummy, but also a big meal.  Then after the evening service I got back home and needed to think through all the stuff that happened during the day.  So I opened up a bag of chips, salsa and cheese dip and proceeded to polish it off.  So when I hopped on the scale on Monday it was not much of a surprise to find myself back up at 74 kg!    On Monday I had a little fruit with my mother-in-law for breakfast, and then went to the hot springs to relax (good day off) until evening when I cruised up to Okutama Bible Chalet to be the speaker for the Jr. High Camp.  Had a bagel for dinner with some cream cheese.  Woke up this morning and weighed in at 72.5 kg and then went back up to the camp to speak again.  I am going to be speaking at the camp twice a day for the rest of the week on "Vision".

      Some people were having a hard time seeing the pictures in our prayer updates, so I sent out a little mailing about it.  I got lots of nice responses back including this one from Singapore.  (We really love to get mail like this!)   Dear Jonathan,  Yup, I can see the pictures that you send to me each week with any probs. I have been printing out these emails for yours which you sent to me faithfully every week and bringing them to my cell group and we always without fail pray for you, your family and your ministry in Japan.  It's always very encouraging to hear the testimonies and to hear God working in the lives of the Japanese people and yourself.  I always look forward to receiving your updates and find joy in praying for your ministry.  I'm so blessed to know that at least there are people who care for the Japanese and who find joy in ministering to them.  Thank you so much for sending me these regular updates, I really really do hope to make a trip down to Japan one day to visit you and your family. Waiting eagerly for your next prayer update!!!  With Blessings and His Love Karen Tan

      "And they stood up in their place and read from the Book of the Law of the Lord their God for one-fourth of the day; and for another fourth they confessed and worshiped the Lord their God."  Nehemiah 9:3  I don't feel like our worship services are so long anymore!    Actually, this all day Scripture and worship-fest did something really important for these people.  They finally got the big picture.  They looked back at God's track record, how even though they had done wickedly, He continues to deal faithfully.    Lord, help me to see your big picture and not get lost in the midst of all my little problems.  Help me to worship well, to daily put you in the highest place in my life.

      "So they read distinctly from the book, in the Law of God; and they gave the sense, and helped them to understand the meaning."  Nehemiah 8:8  It is not enough that I give a witty, relevant message based on Biblical themes and principles -- I must read distinctly from the Book.  People need to know that the God's word for them is contained in the book.  They need to know where to go to find the words of life.  I also need to protect people from somehow thinking that I am wise or I have the answers.    Much of the Bible is difficult for people to understand because of the gaps of language, culture and time.  This was just as much true for Nehemiah and Ezra as for us.  They had just as hard of a time understanding what Moses wrote as we have "getting" Shakespeare.  I need to help people make sense of what they are reading.    People also need to know how this old story applies to their lives.  What is the meaning of it for today?  I cannot apply it to every life, only the Holy Spirit can do that.  But I can show by example how it is applied to my life.  How the Spirit has been teaching me through it.  Hopefully through this example the people will be inspired to let the Spirit lead them as well.  Lord, help me to teach your word and not to stray from it.  Help me to help others make sense out of the difficult passages and understand a little more of the meaning that you have packed into it for their lives.

      "Then my God put it into my heart..."  Nehemiah 7:5a  Nehemiah had finished the work that God had put upon his heart, but at the completion of that task he was open to getting the next word from the Lord.    Wise God, help me to be ready for the next thing that you have.  Help me not to be so focussed on what we have already done that I miss what You want to do next.

      "Then it was, when the wall was built and I had hung the doors, when the gatekeepers, the singers, and the Levites had been appointed, that I gave the charge of Jerusalem to my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the leader of the citadel, for he was a faithful man and feared God more than many."  Nehemiah 7:1-2  As we were working last week putting the floor in for the storage room, I could see the end of construction in sight.  There are only a few more projects left to do (upstairs bathroom, one more classroom and stairway) until the building is done.  But I can see a few things here in Nehemiah.  First of all the purpose of having the walls is not to have nice walls!  It is so that God's people can have a place to worship Him.  A place where they are protected from the enemy and can grow in His grace.  Just as important as building the church is raising up those with the heart to serve and lead.  Nehemiah gave charge over important areas to specific men who he trusted.  One was his brother Hanani, who had originally given him the report about the plight of the Jews in Jerusalem back in chapter 1.  The other was Hananiah, already a leader who was a faithful man and feared God more than many.    Merciful Lord, raise up servants whose hearts will be for your people and for the lost here in Japan. Raise up brothers who are of the same heart, who are faithful and fear You more than others.

      Weighed in at 71kg this morning.  Been doing pretty good with exercise and self-control with food.  On Saturday I went hiking with the VanDruffs in the mountains behind Ome and ended up in a hot spring.  Good stuff.  Sunday was awesome with a baptism and lots of ministry.  Yesterday I biked 10k in the morning and did it again this morning as well.  Been enjoying the new Steven Curtis Chapman cd that Rie got.  It is a love album to his wife and she wrote the liner notes which is very cool.  It is neat to get a glimpse into the personal life of a couple that is very obviously ministry centered and who have been married just a little longer than we have.  I also was really happy that he did a cover of one of my favorite songs, "500 miles" by the Proclaimers.  Rie and the kids will be in Oregon till the end of July and Gracie just had her 5th birthday so I am missing them pretty ferociously about now.

      "And the people blessed all the men who willingly offered themselves to dwell at Jerusalem."  (Nehemiah 11:2)   I have been so blessed by the people who have willingly offered themselves to be a part of Grace these last two years.  Jerusalem in the time of Nehemiah was a mess of destroyed buildings and crumbling ruins.  With heroic effort and faith they had built the walls but it would take longer to make it into a real city.  The first ones had to deal with hardships and lack that those who came later knew nothing about.  It is hard to believe now how little there was in the beginning, but what a blessing it was to be standing with brothers and sisters who were willing to sacrifice a little because they believed in a lot.  Lord, I pray that You would continue to raise up those who would willingly offer themselves for your gospel in Japan.

      hmm, woke up this morning at 70kg.  So far I have lost about 5kg or 11 lbs.  Getting there -- but my raquetball partners are all leaving on vacation and I broke the exercise bike.  Guess I need to go back to good old fashioned walking.  Now if only it would stop raining.

      Bob Bastable and I laid carpet in my office today.  Went well and we were able to have some good fellowship.  Office looks a lot nicer.  Now if I could only clean my desk...  Been a pretty kick back day.  Hiromi popped by to meet the Russian team and take them out for sushi.  Shawn and her little nephew came by to help clean the church and we got our work done.  And it was actually hot today.  Nice after all the rain.

      Last Sunday reminded me of our first summer two years ago.  That summer we had so very few regulars but it seemed that there were always people in the church on Sunday.  It just was never the same people.  Well yesterday many of our regular families were gone but as usual the church was packed.  We had a 18 member gospel choir from Virginia, a team from the Lake Baikal region of Russia, a woman from Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa who stayed at the church that night, and then a bunch of counselors from the Okutama Bible Camp showed up right before the service.  Add to that some new families and it was full... go figure.

      I am holding steady at 70kg, but I really need to exercise.  Wish it would stop raining... Usually I am happy when the rainy season here is long.  Because that means it won't be so terribly hot.  But this year the rainy season has been so long that I am actually looking forward to some hot sunny days.  Imagine that!

      Just looking at my calendar and there is a lot happening around Tokyo in the near future.    One event called  urlLink  YouthAlive  will be held on the 4th, 5th, and 6th of August.  Yep, that is next week!  It is being put on by our Aussie friends over at  urlLink  Jesus Life House  with the help of some folks from  urlLink Planet Shakers   Then the 12-15 is the  urlLink  "Send Me" Youth Missions Conference   being held down at Aoyama Gakuen.  It is billed as a Japanese "Urbana" kind of conference.  One of our girls, Momoko, will be singing and dancing with the Young Continentals for this and I am expecting to tag along as well.      On the 15th through the 17th Grace will be having our summer retreat up at Japan Bible Home.  Rich and Candice Rose, missionaries from Hawaii at Tokorozawa Calvary Chapel will come and share with us there.    Then I just heard today from Talo who pastors  urlLink  New Hope   that Wayne Cordeiro will be coming over to do a leadership development seminar from the 18th to the 19th.  More good stuff.    Finally sometime in September, Calvary Chapel will have its Japanese Pastor's Conference.  So lots of good things going on this month and next.  Throw in a bunch of Korean outreach teams, starting our third Sunday service, and new home fellowships and this looks like a fun next couple of months!

      Yesterday, Graham and I went down to Shinjuku to be at seminar on youth work and music put on by Youth Alive and PlanetShakers.  Good stuff.  I tend to be a logical thinker and Graham is more of a visual person.  (Check out some of his artwork at  urlLink  Gramskrit )  During the seminar Graham was taking notes, which for him means drawing in a sketch pad.  The first point was not to be upset if your leader suddenly moves the goal.  The second point was to be a bridge between where you think your leader should be and where he is, and the last point was to be your leader's biggest fan.  All of this became very  interesting and visual on Graham's pad.  He got the points but in a unique way.  This is why we need art here in Japan!  There are many people who even though we preach boldly and clearly in their heart language will never really get it until they "see" it in another way.  Along the same lines, recently I have gotten to know a missionary named Mark Penner who is in the process of translating the Bible into another heart language here in Japan that I never knew about.  It is Japanese Sign Language.  For many deaf, their true heart language is sign and written Japanese is just like learning a foreign language that they have never heard before.

      10 Cities Around Ome  Our city of Ome is nestled up against the mountains on the far western edge of Tokyo.  Over the mountains to the north is Hanno, and over the mountains to the south is Akirunoshi and Hinodemachi.  If you go up into the mountains directly to the west there is the small village of Okutamamachi.  If you follow the Tama river downstream you come to the cities of Hamura, Fussa and Akishima and if you follow the Ome Kaido (The main highway that leads from Ome down to Shinjuku in the center of Tokyo) you come to the cities of Mizuho and Iruma.    10 Cities around Ome  	 81,989	      Hanno			 147,909 	Iruma	 32,892   	Mizuho	 56,779  	Hamura		 62,316 	      Fussa		 78,351  	Akirunoshi	 16,631 	      Hinodemachi	 7,575 	      Okutamamachi	 106,532 	Akishima	 141,394	Ome	 Total Population:  738,300  Altogether with Ome these 10 cities are home to three quarters of a million people.  It is not much compared to the 26 million that live in the entire Tokyo metropolitan area, but still a lot.  Considering that only about 1% have any faith in Christ at all, there is also a lot of work to do.  Each of these cities have existing churches, however there are not enough churches even to care for the 1% that supposedly have faith!  The result is that many people who have at one time made a confession of faith, or have been baptized, no longer attend church or fellowship with a body of believers.  The reality of this is that these Christians are weak and demoralized and are not living in victory or making a difference for the kingdom of God.  Similar conditions exist all over Tokyo and indeed the situation only gets worse as you go farther away from the capital into the countryside of Japan.  How can we expect the church to advance for the kingdom of God, when we are not even taking care of those who have already received Christ?  Jesus said, "Well done, good servant, because you were faithful in a very little, have authority over ten cities." (Luke 19:17)  If we want to see many come to Christ we need to be faithful in the very little that has been entrusted to us.

      Yoshiko just published another book!  "Nandedaro America"  It is a collection of comic strips and essays of her Minami Nanami character as she was studying art abroad in America (at Biola).  In her wonderful quirky way she gives her perspective as a Japanese Christian on how things are in America.  Some of the chapter titles are, "Morning Chapel", "How to Read the Bible", "Worship Music", "Drama", "TV and Newspapers", "Spreading the Gospel by All Means", "American Jews", "Islam", "Cults", "Christians in America".  I learned something new!   Way to go, Yoshiko!

      10 Communities in Ome  There are forty-one communities in Ome, but these are the largest and closest ones to Grace.   If you look the populations of these communities you can see that each one is the size of a small town in itself.  But only five of these communities have a church and the largest Shinmachi still doesn't have one.  Shinmachi 17,417   Kabemachi 15,760 (Grace Christian Fellowship) Nagabuchi 9,662  Higashi Ome 9,011 Chigase 7,187 Imai 7,105 Nogamicho 6,563 Morooka 4886 Imadera 4,053 Daimon  4,374 (Youth With A Mission)  We are praying that each of these communities could have at least a home fellowship and that every person would have the chance to hear the gospel.

      We were blessed yesterday to visit with Roger and Jean Fleming who are with the Navigators.  They shared with our Tuesday night Bible study but they weren't really here for ministry.  Rather they came out from Colorado to meet their newest grandson, Billy.  One of the things that I enjoy so much about being around mature Christians is that even when they are not "on", they still minister simply by being who they are.

      Here is something interesting that I noticed over at Paul Shew's page  http://homepage.mac.com/paulshew/research/xty.jpn/BasicFacts-XtyJpn.html#table1  urlLink  Statistical Variences of Religion in Japan    According to the official statistics put out by the Japanese government the Japanese are some of the most religious people in the world, with the majority of them regarding themselves as members of not one but two religions and not a single atheist in the bunch!  In such a crowded field of religions it is no wonder that Christianity has not been widely accepted!    However the official statistics are wholly innacurate.  Most Japanese whom I meet are hardly devout followers of either Buddha or Shinto, they might participate in a ceremony or festival occasionally because they are Japanese but very few know the doctrines or follow the practices of these religions.    The independant results are probably much more accurate to what I have noticed in my 14 years here in Japan.        &nbsp; 		  			  				   Statistical Variences of Religion Affiliation in Japan    			  			  				   				  					  						Official Membership Statistics  				  				  					  						Independent Survey Results  				  			  			  				 Shinto  				 94.%  				 2-3%  			  			  				 Buddhists  				 72.%  				 20%  			  			  				 Other/New  				 9.%  				 10%  			  			  				 Christian  				 1.2%  				 1-3%  			  			  				 None  				 (65.%)  				 65%  			  			  				  Total   				 241.%  				 100%  			  			  				  *Official statistics do not include &quot;None,&quot; but some accounting must be made of these people.  					*Independent surveys here indicate those which ask people which religion they belong to. &quot;None&quot; in this case means non-religious, non-spriritual, or atheist.

      A lot of new things happening around here.  As I mentioned before, we will start up three services from this Sunday.  Children's ministry is starting up fresh as well and we will have about 20 volunteers sharing their faith with the kids.  This is a real answer to prayer as there will be six different rooms going with children!  Six new home fellowships will be starting over the next couple of months and will give us lots of flexibility and opportunity to both grow as a family and reach out to the neighborhoods.  Finally, also starting up this fall will be a new singles ministry.    Three of the new home fellowships will be located at Yokota Air Force Base in Fussa.  One will be in Ome near Higashi Ome station, another will be in Akirunoshi near Higashi Akiru Station and one more will be in Hamura.

      Books on church planting... (Skip past the movies) I have not read most of these.  But would love to hear from anyone who has and their thoughts on them.   urlLink Top Ten Books For Church Planters   I think the only one I have read is "The Purpose Driven Church" by Rick Warren.  It has been a while since I read it... At the time I liked the first three or four chapters but then it got very "American".  I was reading and thinking, "Yeah, that would probably work in California, but not in Japan."  This is the big problem with books on how to plant churches.  They work if your ministry is exactly like the person's who wrote it.... but of course your ministry is never exactly like theirs.    What is essential is not technique but tenacity, not fresh ideas but faithful integrity to be odedient to what God is calling you to do in your ministry and your situation.  I think it is hard to write a whole book about that though... So when I read people's books on how to plant churches I try to look for the essentials that are reproducible and not the ideas or techniques that might have worked in their particular circumstance.

      Interesting.  The author gives 6 reasons why a failure might not be such a failure after all.  -- I usually don't like to think in terms of failure or success but in terms of faithfulness to what God has called you to do.  These are some reasons why God might have called you into a ministry where success does not seem likely.  urlLink Sakamuyo :: View topic - 4 out of 5 Church Plants Fail

      Acts 2:43-47  Four Results of Home Fellowships  "Then fear came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles.  Now all who believed were together, and had all things in common, and sold their possessions and goods, and divided them among all, as anyone had need.  So continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they ate their food with gladness and simplicity of heart, praising God and having favor with all the people.  And the Lord added to the church daily those who were being saved."  1.  Then fear came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles.  Every Sunday during the services I give people a chance to share testimony about what God is doing in their lives.  The result of these testimonies is that the whole body is encouraged in their faith and they begin to expect that God will work in their lives as well.  But of course not everybody gets to share on Sunday.  Usually it is only one or two.  What would happen if everyone got to share every week, not just about the big things but the little things as well?  We would find that the whole body would be expecting God to do wonders!  2.  All who believed were together and had all things in common.  In the large church context it becomes difficult to love one another in practical ways.  Although there are needs and plenty of resources to meet those needs it is hard to connect the two together.  Usually any attempt to do so becomes something stiff and institutional.  However, in a home fellowship when there is a need it is obvious and those who can meet that need have a heart to do so.  Through these small groups loving one another becomes very natural.  3.  So continuing daily with one accord in the temple... with gladness and simplicity of heart, praising God and having favor with all the people.  One of the biggest turnoffs about the church is when we bicker and argue with each other.  The reason why they were in one accord was because their needs were being met as they broke bread from house to house.  There was no need for envy or strife between them but just gladness and simplicity of heart.  4.  And the Lord added to the church daily those who were being saved.  Right now the normal pattern for people being saved at Grace is to talk with me after the service and make a confession for Christ.  In this way there are a number of people being saved each month.  But with home fellowships there will be many more "doorways" for people to enter through.

      Acts 2:47  "Four Functions of Home Fellowships"  "And they continued steadfastly in the apostle's doctrine and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers."    At last weekend's Equippers Seminar we talked and shared a lot about how these four things happen in the home fellowships and how it is different from what typically takes place in a Sunday worship service.    1.  They continued steadfastly in the apostle's doctrine  I think what is key here is that we are not just to be hearers of the word but also doers, or as it is phrased here, "continuers".  During the sermons on Sunday and Tuesday night Bible studies I teach the word in a rather general fashion.  I paint the picture with broad brush strokes and pray that the Holy Spirit will fill in the details as to how the truth applies to each individual life.  It is not really possible at that time for someone to interrupt and ask whether they are understanding the Spirit correctly.  This is where the home fellowship can be really helpful -- in encouraging one another to apply this general teaching more specifically to life.  The idea then is not so much to introduce new content, but to help each other apply and continue on in the teaching that you have already received.  2.  They continued steadfastly in fellowship  It is quite possible for someone to come to a worship service and never feel as if they are part of the family.  Masachika and Yuki shared how at their home fellowship Kaoru prayed for their daughter's upcoming piano recital.  These "little" things are some of the most important ways that we can love each other.  3.  They continued steadfastly in the breaking of bread  Not only with communion but with any meal shared together, there is a real acceptance and unity that takes place.  Karla sent me an e-mail from back in the U.S. about how meaningful our weekly curry lunch after the service was to her, because it gave her a chance to get to know people.    4.  They continued steadfastly in prayer  There are prayer needs (and praise reports) that will never make it to the big stage.  They aren't really important enough to ask the whole church to pray or to tell the whole church about.  But in the home fellowship setting there is nothing too small to share and to pray about together.

      Many Japanese who met Jesus while studying abroad are suprised when they come back home and attend a Japanese church.  I was reading some testimonies of these Christians on the  urlLink JCFN   site and read this:     I moved to the USA six months after my baptism.     My life and my walk with Christ in the USA for five and a half     years was a great experience. For the first two weeks since I     had returned to Japan, I kept asking myself, "Why is Japan     this way?" I had the same feeling towards the churches in     Japan. One day, a pastor spoke about our 'Foundation of Faith'     in his message. He asked us what our foundation was. The Bible     says that the foundation of our faith is indeed Christ (Eph.     2:20). At that moment I realized that I was searching for the     American church which I used to go to and grew in faith in, in     Japan. The church which I went to in the USA was a big church     with 5,000 people. I thought to myself that maybe the foundation     of my faith was being in the choir, the worship style, and all     the other things of the church in the USA, and not Christ Himself.     The most important thing in Christianity is Jesus Christ. And     Jesus Christ who is the author and the perfector of our faith     does not change from culture to culture. When I realized this     truth, I learned a very important lesson, I thought. (By Yo Matsumoto)

      There seems to be quite a number of excellent blogs that feature photography of Japan.  I am no photographer so I will leave that to them, but will try to point the way to a few of them that you might find interesting.  Pictures of Japan don't just fit into one pattern, even as pictures of America wouldn't.  National Geographic Magazine has been running a feature for a few years where they pick one American zip code and do a photo essay on it.  The results are as varied as there are zip codes in the U.S. and so too are these blogs.  Enjoy!

      The Amateurisation of Ministry...?  I was reading yesterday on a blog about   urlLink plasticbag.org | weblog | (Weblogs and) The Mass Amateurisation of (Nearly) Everything...   It was talking specifically about weblogs, but more generally about how publishing, journalism and many other things like photo processing and making movies are being taken out of the professionals office or studio and into the home for any Joe with a computer.    I am a beneficiary of this for sure.  I use iPhoto, iMovie and blogger to roll my own movies and slideshows and keep people informed about what is happening in the ministry here in Japan.  The article above reasoned that this is mainly because equipment and information is now readily available where before it wasn't. The cost of entry has come down so low that anyone can get involved.   The upshot is that where a missionary/church in the past could not afford to produce a movie documenting their ministry, I am producing movies regularly to do everything from promoting the next retreat to showing people what our church is about.  Where it would have been impossible for us to produce (and mail) a magazine even yearly with color photos to all of our supporters, we can now provide them with daily updates at minimal cost.  This amateurization not only lowers the cost of creating things, but actually allows a vast larger of things to be created that never would have been created before.  Now hold on a moment.  Shouldn't some things remain professional?  Last week in the prayer update devotional,   urlLink "Signal to Noise Ratio"  I mentioned that we need to consider the quality of the source when we look at information which is why the Bible tells us to "Set your mind on things above, not on things on the earth."  With now millions of people all logging on with their thoughts and ideas about everything, how do you know what is true?  How do you know what is quality?  This is where we turn to the professionals.  If some piece of news shows up on a few blogs it is interesting but if the same things starts showing up on CNN then it has more weight.  But this isn't the only meaning of the word "professional."  We are used to thinking in terms of a professional being someone who gets paid and exhibits a higher quality of work.  But there is a deeper meaning that we should not forget.  A profession is not just a career but also a statement of faith or belief.      The word "professional" comes from the idea of "professing" something.  The original professions were all paths of life that required their practitioners to make a profession or oath.  Examples of this would be the medical profession and the legal profession.  They are called professions because they swear to uphold an oath.  This is different from tradesmen or artisans who are seeking to increase wealth by buying and selling or creating a  product.  The professions serve a higher purpose that is supposed to be above simply seeking after personal gain.  Ministers are also one of the classical professions because they are called into the ministry and serve God rather than man.    The question then becomes, do we want to amateurize the professions? Do we want to sell kits to do plastic surgery at home?  Should there be one-click litigation available online?  Actually, I don't think that is what is going to happen.  The mass amateurization we are beginning to see online is one of craft and not of profession.  Many of the things that were once done by skilled craftsmen and artisans with expensive tools and equipment are now being accomplished by people like me with little skill and a computer.  But the professions require more than just skill and equipment.  They require belief in something higher, whether that be health, law, or God.  Now one of the main tenents of the Protestant Reformation was the "Priesthood of all Believers", the idea that we do not need a priest to stand between us and God because Jesus has closed the gap.  Recently, there has been renewed interest in the church in making less of a distinction between clergy and laity, and many sermons have been preached urging people to get out of the pew and into the world to minister unto the lost.  This is right and good as the church had become something of a spectator sport rather than a participatory one.  But where should we draw the line between professional and amateur?  If everyone is a minister then who should I listen to when my "ministers" all say different things?    There are some who would seek to disperse the church, do away with the paid minister, and have the body minister unto itself.  They think that this would solve the problems.  They are correct in that there is ordained ministry that is amateurish and immature.  There is also ministry that is unordained and yet of extremely high quality.  But the New Testament example is that while every part of the body has a role to play and is essential for the whole, there is a need for some to be called; to go, to speak out, to proclaim, to pastor and to teach.  There is a need for those who will trust God to make them sufficient to the ministry and not seek commendation from men.  There is a need for those who will not be swept to and fro by every opinion poll or passing fad, but will seek first the things above.  There is a need today for professional ministry.  For us to profess our faith in God and serve Him by serving the flock that He has put into our care.

        Well we did it, we updated our pictures.  The old one of my family is from 3 years ago when we were just starting the church.  In this new and improved picture I look much more like I do now.  Rie on the other hand looks exactly the same as she always does.  In fact I was looking through old pictures of our wedding 15 years ago and she still looks exactly the same.  I looked like a little boy, but she looks as beautiful as ever.  My wife does not seem to age at the same rate that I do.    Oh yeah, as you can tell we are kind of in to the cowboy theme right now.  Maybe I am embracing my Western heritage or maybe i just like it.

       urlLink Nippon Goro Goro  posted a report from the BBC on the new Al Qaeda tape that mentions Japan by name as a possible terrorist target.  During the first Gulf War I was riding the train and caught the eye of two Pakistanis.  As they were getting off the train one of them bumped into me a little harder than was necessary and gave me quite a look.  Afterwards the thought occurred to me that he could have easily knifed me or done much worse and disappeared into the night.  In times like these we really have to trust in God and do our best to love our enemies because it would be very easy to start treating everyone with suspicion.

      Japan is becoming a much more diverse country racially.  According to this report  urlLink Gen Kanai weblog: Japan Marriage Trends  as much as 5% of all marriages in Japan are international and as many as 6% of all children in Japan were biracial.  One reason is that biracial couples seem to have more children than Japanese couples.    There is a huge difference between when I first came to Japan 14 years ago and today in the attitude towards foreigners.  When I first came I got lots of stares and special treatment everywhere I went.  Nowadays I am taken for granted.  In the city there are foreigners everywhere and in the countryside there are more and more.  Not every foreigner is caucasion though, there are many Asians, South Americans and Africans as well.    Tomorrow I am going to speak to a group of jr. high school students at a local school.  Most of these kids are returnees and some of them are biracial.  They face a unique situation growing up in a country like Japan but are also I believe the start of this country truly opening up to the rest of the world and hopefully also to the gospel.

       urlLink Amnesty International Looks Inside Japanese Prisons   This is really a scary thought, that Amnesty has never been allowed a look into Japanese prisons before.  One of the ripples of more foreigners coming into Japan will be more foreigners incarcerated in Japanese prisons. (This is not to say that there is a higher percentage of crime being perpetrated by foreigners than Japanese -- like the Japanese government and media are so fond of saying.) Jesus said, "for I was hungry and you gave Me food; I was thirsty and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in; I was naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me." I don't think I know of one Christian prison ministry in Japan and certainly don't know of anyone ministering to foreigners who are in Japanese prisons.

       urlLink Gen Kanai weblog: Yoko Haruka: Hybrid Woman & Kekkon Shimasen!    In Hybrid Woman, she advises women tired of swimming against   the tide to play cute rather than to challenge male superiorityto trick men   into thinking they need empathy and protection. Let sympathetic men fight your battles with male hostility, she says.   A hybrid woman knows how to use those around her to achieve happiness. Men,   company, marriage...these are things you can use to achieve your goal,   but if they are of no use, discard them, she writes. Dont blame men,   or depend on them. . . . Dont live for your husband, much less for your   company. Live only for yourself. Who can blame an aspiring Japanese woman   for doing what it takes to find success and happiness in a system that would   otherwise deny her them?   Indeed, men and women in Japan these days are going their separate ways, interacting   and understanding each other less. More and more young women organize their   livespreparing careers and buying condos for themselvesaround the principle   that theyll never marry. Though the increase in the number of divorces among   those in their 20s and 30s has slowed, its mainly because fewer of them now   marry in the first place. In contrast, the divorce figures among couples married   for 30 years or more are climbing at double-digit rates. In a country that   tops the world in life expectancy for women, increasing numbers of middle-aged   women refuse to spend their long retirements with self-centered spouses.    Read the entire article and you will start to understand some of the issues that face Japanese women.  But Yoko Haruka's solution, while popular, is really irresponsible.  I think many women read her books and long for a different life and wish they could be like this successful television personality.  But the reality is that this is not really an option for most people.  It is escapist fantasy at best and at worst encourages divorce and broken families.  What we really need are books that help people to have better marriages.

      The author of  urlLink The Blog From Another Dimension: Crime and Foreigners in Japan refers to being stopped by the police for "bicycling while foreign."  For those of you who need this explained (i.e. don't live in Japan) the police here find it perfectly reasonable to stop any foreigner at night who happens to be riding a bicycle.  The problem seems to be that there are people stealing bicycles and of course this is not something that a Japanese person would ever dream of doing!  So it must be the foreigners.  I have actually seen a man (who happened to be Japanese) drive up in front of a train station in the middle of the night and start loading bicycles into the back of a white truck.  It was a lonely place and I doubt that he saw me, and I doubt that the city hauls away bicycles in the middle of the night.    The Bible is full of warnings from God not to mistreat those who are less fortunate.   Deuteronomy 14:29 And the Levite, because he has no portion nor inheritance with you, and the stranger and the fatherless and the widow who are within your gates, may come and eat and be satisfied, that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hand which you do."    The similarity between the foreigner, widow, and fatherless is that they do not have anyone to stand up for them -- no larger social context.  So they are easy to take advantage of.  When media and government blame higher crime rates on foreigners they are shamefully taking advantage of a group that has no power to defend itself.

      Japan is coming to grips with an increasingly diverse population.  The question is whether it will choose racism and politicians will profit from fueling racial strife.  This is not an issue that is going to go away.  Part of our job here is to help Japanese understand that foreigners are people too.  I think the best way to do that is to get out of our comfort zone and make Japanese friends.

      I have noticed a sharp rise in the number of houses in Ome that have Christmas decorations.  I really wonder what is causing this -- Is it a fad?  Do these people have some kind of Christian background?  Have they lived overseas and returned?  Is this a sign of the increase of foreigners?  Is it just that Christmas decorations are easier to get now?  "Illumination" or Christmas light displays have been very popular in Japan for a long time, but usually always downtown at large shopping places.  This trend towards having your own personal display is intriguing.   urlLink The Blog From Another Dimension: Christmas in Japan

      Two weeks ago a group of us guys took a two day hike up Mt. Kumotori (Cloudgrabber!) Here are some pictures.  We had a great time but were exhausted by the end of it.    We started out at Okutama lake and left my little car down by the end of the trail where we hoped to come out.  We didn't really even get onto the trail until around 3 in the afternoon as most of the guys had to work and Jonathan was moving in the morning.  So by the time we got on the trail it was already starting to get dark.  The first stretch of trail was the steepest, as usual!  What made it really rough was that my pack was heavy.  I usually go on day hikes so there was quite a bit of difference in the weight.  By the end of the trail I was going really slow and it was pitch black -- but we were hiking with headlamps so we were able to see.  I was the last of the group to make it to the expected campsite but when I got there it turned out that we were to be charged 400 each and we would not be permitted to build a fire!  You have to understand, it was VERY COLD.  So for the next half an hour I climbed to the top of the ridge on sheer indignation!    The making of fire became quite an ordeal as most of the wood around was very wet and there was a lot of wind as well.  By the time someone remembered that we had napkins that we could use to get it started we had spend about an hour messing around with it.  But in the end we got hot dogs roasting and with a little food in my stomach I was ready for bed.    The next problem was that we had forgotten to bring one of the tents.  So we had six guys in one four man tent.  This meant that while it was warm enough inside no one was really able to stretch out enough to get the kinks out of their legs.  Mark was kind enough to let me use his sleeping pad so I did pretty well.  Actually once I got stretched out on it I was hurting so bad that he didn't have the heart to tell me to get off!      The next morning we got up bright and early to see Mt. Fuji -- what an awesome view!  The stars the night before weren't bad either.  We hiked along the ridge to the top of Mt. Kumotori, the highest peak in Tokyo.  Mark came up with a great idea, that we could leave all the gear at the tent until we came back down, so I travelled light and did great until we got back.     The trail down from our camp was just about vertical and didn't seem to ever end. It was relentless.  When we finally hit the road we thought our troubles were over, but in reality they had just begun.  The road stretched for another 5 kilos mostly steep downhill before it reached my car.  Needless to say we were some very tired hikers by the time we got down.  But I did get up and preach three times the next day!

      This story in the Yomiuri Shimbun tells of a group of visually handicapped tourists who wanted to visit a hot-spring but were turned away because they had guide-dogs with them.  urlLink Guide dog users turned away by inn   The Japanese inn turned them away because they "considered that it would be difficult to safely evacuate guests with guide dogs in the event of a fire or other disasters."  Likely they were concerned that the dogs would make a mess or disturb other guests.  But usually in Japan, if there is no precedent or there is doubt, the answer is always "No". This became news because of a new law that went into effect in October a year ago for government buildings and for public places this year.  In Japan most people with handicaps are considered to be bothersome to others and the general attitude seems to be that if these troublemakers would just stay home then they wouldn't make problems for the rest of us.    Christians need to remember that our Lord Jesus spent a disproportionate amount with the blind, lame and sick and didn't seem to consider them a distraction away from His ministry but rather the object of His love and mercy.  Love always requires sacrifice.  Whether it be a disruption of our normal way of doing things, extra work or cost on our part, or simply a willingness to look at things a new way.

      This is another news story that hilights some of the issues that Japan is going to face concerning immigration. urlLink VOANews.com   The story reports,  "According to United Nations estimates, to maintain even minimal economic growth Japan needs about 600,000 new foreign workers every year. But this is a country with little experience with immigrants. Only one out of every 500 people in Japan are foreign born. That compares with about one of every five in such countries as Australia and the United States."

      This is a good article in the New York Times about being homeless in Japan.   urlLink For Japan's New Homeless, There's Disdain and Danger   Japanese society places a high degree of importance on conformity.  This conformity is enforced in many ways but one way that has been enforced is through "ijime" or bullying.  The weak, oddball is picked on at school and routinely beat up by those who are considered normal.    Children are very clear about what is right and wrong and have a strong sense of justice.  (They also know how to lie and manipulate as well...) But if children see someone else doing something that their parents told them not to do they see no problem in pointing out their fault or even going so far as to punish them for it.  So in a conformist society like Japan, the homeless become targets for youth.  I think it is an extension of the whole "ijime" problem.  Why is there such a homeless problem in a country as rich as Japan?  The same conformity issue is to blame.  When workers such as those described in this story come up against problems they don't know how to find a creative solution.  Their whole lives they have simply been part of the system.  So when the system fails they don't know what to do.  Nowadays, with more homeless people being seen, it becomes easier to choose "homelessness" as a legitimate alternative when other options don't work.  In other words, like everything else in Japan, if there is a group of homeless people that you can join then it is alright.    I think there are quite a few young men who have found an easy way out and should not really be homeless.  These men need guidance and opportunity before they get too used to the homeless life.

      YEAR IN REVIEW 2003 Praise the Lord! 2003 was a big year for us and for Grace Christian Fellowship. Some of the most significant things are hard to see in the monthly overviews but are real blessings from God. Over the last 2 years over 60 people have received Christ through this ministry, but whereas in 2002 most people prayed with me to receive Christ, in 2003 there were many who came to salvation through others in the body. Pray that more and more people in the church would experience the joy of leading someone to Jesus! Another huge leap forward has been the growing numbers of people who are willing to serve and take leadership of ministries. Most of the events of this last year were not planned or put on by me, none of the home fellowships are led by me, and I am no longer leading worship for any of the three services (except in a pinch). Pray that God would raise up more worship leaders, Bible teachers, home fellowship leaders, children's ministry leaders and evangelists!  January * God provided carpet, chairs and tile for the upstairs * The Korean Kings kids ministered at Keimei and a local preschool, opening doors. * Grace started publishing bilingual Japanese/English sermons on the internet.   February * God brought Satoko through Justin and Etsu to receive salvation. * Grace held its first Valentine's day party * God brought Hideto and Ayako to receive salvation * We were able to finish construction on two new classrooms upstairs. * Grace hosted two teams, one from Inchon and the other from YWAM   March * God brought Nona to receive salvation * God brought Tomomi's customer, Yoshiko's friend, and Shiori, Kotomi and Mizuki to receive salvation. * New Sunday school classes started upstairs   April * God brought Yoshiko's friends' mother to salvation * God brought an 80 year old woman to salvation through Tomomi. * God brought Carlos and Ikumi to receive salvation. * God brought Miyabi and Hiromi to receive salvation.   May * Grace hosted two YWAM teams from Florida and New Zealand * God brought Hatsue to receive Christ through Eva. * God brought Akiko to receive Christ through Yoshiko * God brought a friend of Tomomi to receive Christ. * God brought Aya to receive Christ. * God brought Minako to receive Christ through Shawn * God brought Etsuko to receive Christ * Grace held the first Equipper seminar to train bible leaders   June * God brought Fujie to receive salvation * God brought Carlos' mother to salvation * God provided air-conditioning for the sanctuary * Grace did soccer ministry in Ome with the Seahorses.   July * God provided for the completion of the upstairs storage room. * God brought Shawn to get baptized. * God brought Domini, Yukiko, Hiromi, Carlos and Ikumi to be baptized. * Grace hosted a black gospel choir that ministered at Keimei   August * God brought Major and Kelly to receive salvation * God brought Kanako to receive salvation * God answered our prayers for 20 children's workers and 6 translators * Grace hosted an evangelism team of Koreans   September * God brought Masaaki through a brain aneurism * Grace started its first home fellowship groups * Grace started holding three services on Sundays * God brought Seiko to receive salvation * God healed Joshua of muscular dystrophy * God opened doors to minister regularly at local schools through the Covenant Players   October * Grace started a singles ministry * Grace held its first harvest festival attended by over 100 children and parents. * God brought Masami to receive salvation   November * Grace held its third Thanksgiving feast with 160 in attendance of which half were unbelievers. * Grace took part in the Ome Arts Festival with music, crafts and the gospel * Grace hosted a Japanese YWAM team who helped with events and evangelism   December * God brought Fan, Taiyo and Yosuke to receive salvation * Grace held its first women's Christmas Tea

      Ohisashiburi!  (It has been a while)  We just got back from California where we attended the Calvary Chapel Missions Conference.  I think it was the best one that we have been to so far.  The theme was "For Such a Time as This" and I truly believe that we are closing in on the time for God to work mightily through us on the world stage.  Robertson McQuilken shared three times and spoke powerfully of the need for us to have a greater committment to sending incarnational (career) missionaries.  Could you imagine what would happen in this world if Calvary Chapel sent a tenth of its members into missions!    Romans 10 spells it out for me very clearly!   For "whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved."  How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed?  And how shall they believe in Him of whomthey have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher?  And how shall they preach unless they are sent?    On the last night of the conference, an invitation was given for those who wanted to make first time commitments to become missionaries and around 40-50 stood up to answer the call.  These are but a handful but pray that many more would follow after them!

      7 Biblical Ways To Pray For the World  Surprisingly there is no biblical model of Jesus, the Apostles, or the early church praying for the world.  God's heart is clear though (1 Tim 2:4), Jesus command is clear (Matthew 28:19), and the Spirit clearly led the early church into the world in the book of Acts.  So how should we pray for the world that God loves?  1.  Pray for yourself. -- Matthew 6:9  Is God's name honored and God's will being accomplished in your life?  Are you well fed, forgiven and fortified against the attacks of the enemy?  2.  Pray for one another. -- James 5:16 How about the brothers and sisters in your church?  Are they growing in their walk with the Lord?  Is there unity in the body?  3.  Pray for your enemies. -- Matthew 5:44 God must love these people because He has brought them to you and then explicitly commanded you to pray for them!  4.  Pray for us. -- 1 Thessalonians 5:25  Pray for Christian workers, those who have been sent.  5.  Pray for more workers to be sent. -- Matthew 9:38  Pray that the Lord of the harvest would send more laborers into the harvest fields.  6.  Pray for those who have believed. -- Colossians 1:9 Pray that those who have responded to the gospel would also be growing in their walk with the Lord.  7.  Pray for all men, but especially those in positions of authority. -- 1 Timothy 2:1-4  Pray that God would soften the hearts of those people who can close and open doors.  Pray that God would protect His people from persecution.    So next time you are led to pray for Japan, don't just put your hand on the map and pray "Lord, save the Japanese!"  Pray that your life would be used to reach the Japanese.  Pray that your church would be used to reach the Japanese.  Pray for your enemies.  Pray for missionaries and pastors in Japan.  Pray for more workers to be sent to Japan.  Pray for Japanese Christians.  And pray for the rulers and authorities in Japan that a great and effective door could be opened for the gospel.

       urlLink Japan's First Shelter For Children    Although there are shelters for female victims of domestic violence, there is no shelter for children seeking refuge.  In an unprecedented move, Carillon Kodomo no Ie (house for children), which will be operated by a nonprofit organization to be established by the lawyers and others, will let children who wish to stay in the shelter do so.  Schools and child consultation offices have been criticized for their slow reaction to the rising number of child abuse cases.  A house will be renovated to accommodate about 10 children. To protect their safety, the address will not be disclosed.  Lawyer Setsuko Tsuboi, who is in charge of the project, plans to accept children who run away from home or welfare facilities because they were abused, people who have no place to stay after leaving children's institutions and children who committed minor crimes and were sent to detention centers because they had no guardian.   Pray for this lawyer that they could get this shelter off the ground.  It could provide a model for Christians to follow in meeting a need that is very large in Japan.

      R-Scale:    One of the concepts that is thrown around a lot in missions is that of the "unreached".  However, it is a difficult thing to define.  The point of course is that in strategic thinking we want to know where we should send new missions and where those missions will be most effective.  The idea is that cross-cultural missions should be sent to those areas that are as yet unreached, while the indigenous churches of each nation that has been reached can handle the continuing evangelization of that country.  This concept of the "unreached" and also "people groups" has led to wide-spread popularization of the "10-40 Window", meaning the portion of the earth's surface that has the most unreached people for Christ.    I have a hard time with the term "unreached" because it is very vague.  At what point should a nation be considered "reached".  Everyone knows that even though the average town in America is very "reached" there is still plenty of evangelism and ministry that needs to happen.  So how can we decide that one area is more needy than another? Some rough guidelines have been talked about.  One way of doing it is dividing the world up into A, B, and C regions depending on how reached or unreached they are.  But this still doesn't answer the question, "How do we decide which of these groups a given region should be in?"  If a church has been established is it now reached?  What about the health of that church?  What about the density of churches to population?  What about percentage of Christians to the general population?  I think all of these need to be factored in to find if a nation is truly reached or unreached.      I have been playing around with some ideas about how to measure the relative effectiveness of the gospel in certain region.  The key factors that I think are important for a given locality are,   X = number of Christians Y = number of Churches Pop = general population  a simple formula that gives us a relative scale of "Reachedness" then would be,   (Pop/x * Pop/y) / 1,000,000 = R (higher number means greater unreachedness)  For example, my town of Ome, Japan would be a 4.48 on the R-Scale according to this calculation.  The higher the number the more needy for the gospel a place would be.  One benefit of this kind of calculation is that it allows us to compare geographic areas of different size in a meaningful way.  Here is a chart of various locations in Japan on the R-Scale.  Tokyo Prefecture 	pop/y = 12,286 	pop/x = 107 	R = 1.31  Ome City (In Tokyo)     	pop/y = 17,500 per 1 church 	pop/x = 256 per 1 Christian 	R = 4.48  Hokkaido Prefecture 	pop/y = 14,000 per 1 church 	pop/x = 254 per 1 Christian 	R = 3.5  Toyama Prefecture 	pop/y = 27,400 	pop/x = 686 	R = 18.7  Okinawa 	pop/y = 6,161 	pop/x = 94 	R = 0.5    Saga Prefecture 	pop/y = 30,368 	pop/x = 550 	R = 16.7  Takushi ( a town in Saga Prefecture) 	pop/y = 24,000 	pop/x = 3,000 	R = 72 (adding one more church of 12 would drop it down to 14)  All this does is give us a meaningful number of relative reachedness for comparing regions beyond just the percentage of population that is Christian or the number of churches in an area.  At some point it should be possible for the indigenous church in an area to effectively reach their area (and indeed send missions to other areas) without undue support from the outside.  What that number would be is yet to be seen.    These numbers might be most useful simply in comparing one area of the same region to another rather than comparing different countries.  An R of "1" in one setting might mean a thriving local church that is experiencing revival while an R of "1" in another setting might mean a church in decline that needs to be revived.  But this would be a start in making useful comparisons in determining how far we have to go in completing the task that Jesus has set before us.

      Right before the Super Bowl the NFL commissioner gave a stern warning about inappropriate behavior on the field.  urlLink End-zone celebrations draw Tagliabue flag    It seems that the NFL should be fining the half-time entertainers and networks that hired them instead of the players for antics during this year's Super Bowl.    According to Timberlake, Jackson, CBS and MTV the "wardrobe malfunction" was unintentional -- nudge, nudge, wink, wink.  Who is fooling who?  It might have been unrehearsed but it certainly was not unintentional.    Who loses?  Certainly not the entertainers.  Jackson and Timberlake just got a huge amount of publicity which for them is like money in the bank.  MTV and CBS will not lose much either.  The big losers are the NFL and the public.  The NFL lost a lot of credibility with the public who will think twice before letting their children watch another half-time show.  The public loses even more as our children will grow up thinking that it is perfectly acceptable to humiliate women in public and treat them as sex objects.  Don't be surprised to find the scene at the end of the half-time show repeated dozens of times in local highschools by teens who think that what they just saw was somehow "cool".  In my opinion, the NFL should hold the networks and performers responsible and sue.  The public should hold them responsible as well.

      Yesterday, I watched my first Super Bowl in years.  Football is not really very popular in Japan and so it is almost impossible to watch the big game on Japanese TV.  But this year some Americans in the church invited me over to watch the game with them on the base.    Wow!  What a game!  That was one of the best games I have seen in a long time.  (Which is not saying much since I haven't seen a Super Bowl in probably over 10 years!)  But this was a knock-down drag-out slug-fest of a game.  In my opinion it was a contest between a team that opitomizes discipline and skill (Patriots) and a team that has incredible drive and the ability to make very clutch plays. (Panthers)  It made for an extremely exciting and close game with the victory ultimately going to the Patriots in the final seconds.    I am probably more of a Panther than a Patriot, when it comes right down to it.  I am not that well disciplined and my skills still need a lot of work.  But I really, really want to be in this game!  I want to be here when the Lord calls Japan into His kingdom.  I want to risk everything and all that I have because I believe that it can happen.

      Near many train stations in Japan there is a back street where you can find a club that advertises "Western Women".  Many of these women are from eastern Europe and have been brought in with very different expectations that what they discovered when they arrived.  These clubs used to feature mostly Asian women but the landscape is once again changing.  This article,  urlLink Laws provide little help for sex slaves  explains that part of the problem is that laws do not treat these women as victims but as criminals themselves.   Keiko Otsu, the director of  urlLink HELP  women's shelter, said: "The police have begun to make real efforts toward combating this problem. However, there needs to be a system where the victims are protected rather than treated as criminals."  In most cases, women who were in such a situation and reported it to the police have been arrested for visa violations, and deported to their country of origin, often at their own expense.  There also are no specific laws in Japan that deal with human trafficking and those convicted of human trafficking are usually only fined or given the equivalent of a slap on the wrist under the relevant laws.  In response, the U.S. State Department listed Japan as a country that did not sufficiently comply with antitrafficking guidelines in their  urlLink Trafficking in Persons Report 2003.   The report stated: "The Japanese government does not aggressively prosecute and punish the criminal organizations involved in trafficking. It does not provide adequate protection for victims."    Pray for Christians to respond to the plight of these women and to reach out to meet the needs that they have.  Pray for the government of Japan to do deal justly and fairly with this issue.

      The science section of the New York Times reports,   urlLink New Data Shows Mysterious Force in Universe, as Einstein Said     In 1917 Einstein predicted that an unseen engergy permeating space is pushing the universe apart.  This is a good thing because otherwise the gravitational pull of all those billions of stars and galaxies would cause the universe to collapse in on itself in a "big crunch".    Einstein named this force "The cosmological constant" but recent theorists seeking to explain the mysterious force have suggested that it could become stronger or weaker over time -- either tearing the universe apart or allowing it to collapse in on itself.    Well, good news!  Einstein was right in calling it a "constant" because new data from the Hubble Space Telescope measuring the push of this force on supernovas shows that even over extremely long periods of time there is no variation.  Kind of reminds me of James 1:17, "Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning."    Perhaps there is some connection between the mysterious force that holds the nucleus of an atom together and the mysterious force that keeps the universe from crashing in or ripping itself apart.  It seems that the Creator loves us in many more ways than we have yet discovered and His love is indeed constant.

      This is an op-ed from the NY Times that is more pointed and accurate than most of the media hype about "Passion" urlLink Op-Ed Contributor: Do You Recognize This Jesus?   Watching "The Passion of the Christ," Mel Gibson's new movie, I kept thinking the following: it is Christians, not Jews, who should be shocked by this film.  Mr. Gibson's raw images invade our religious comfort zone, which has long since been cleansed of the Gospels' harsher edges. Most Americans worship in churches where the bloodied body of Jesus is absent from sanctuary crosses or else styled in ways so abstract that there is no hint of suffering. In sermons, too, the emphasis all too often is on the smoothly therapeutic: what Jesus can do for me.  More than 60 years ago, H. Richard Neibuhr summarized the creed of an easygoing American Christianity that has in our time triumphantly come to pass: "A God without wrath brought men without sin into a kingdom without judgment though the ministrations of a Christ without a cross." Despite its muscular excess, Mr. Gibson's symbol-laden film is a welcome repudiation of all that."     I haven't seen this movie yet of course.  But I am wondering what the reaction of the Japanese will be to this film when it comes to Tokyo in May.  I think it will be a good correction to the view that many have of Jesus as a good teacher and of the cross as some kind of good luck charm.

       urlLink New Law To Tackle Child Abuse in Japan    A draft bill compiled by a Liberal Democratic Party panel to enable police to enter a house in which child abuse is suspected--even without permission from the child's parents--is believed to be a key step toward the elimination of child abuse.   Recently child abuse has been big news in Japan.  A father and his common-law wife in Kishiwada made headlines when their 15 year old son fell into a coma weighing only 24 kilograms because they had been purposely starving him.  Traditionally Japan has been very non-confrontational and what happens within the family has been off-limits to government and extremely private anyway.  Recent changes in the laws have resulted in huge jumps in the number of reported cases, overwhelming the governments facilities to deal with them.  But these are still just the tip of an iceberg that is largely hidden below the surface.

      Pfizer spent a whole lot of money to find out what is "blindingly obvious" when they failed to prove that Viagra works in the same way for women as it does for men.  urlLink Sex - it's mostly in a woman's mind :    "Anne Atkins, the broadcaster and commentator on moral and ethical issues, agreed the Pfizer findings were 'blindingly obvious'. 'I'm surprised we needed scientists to tell us this,' she says. 'Women have always known that men are turned on in a very straightforward way.'  Atkins added that she believed a female Viagra was possible, but that the invention of such a drug would be a 'retrograde' step.  'It would be one more instance of trying to turn women into surrogate men, in much the same way as the sexual revolution made us more promiscuous,' she says. 'Buying us a bunch of red roses is far more likely to work and is far healthier for all of us.'"   I don't think it will stop Pfizer from trying though as they are making about 1 billion dollars a year off Viagra!  When you are making billions what is a few million here or there just to confirm what we already knew.

      Recent news about the effectiveness of abstinence programs in the US are reporting things in a really one-sided manner.  Here is a better angle on the story.   urlLink Abstinence Programs Proven Effective, But Not Foolproof    Abstinence Programs Proven Effective, But Not Foolproof  If you ever want to see an egregious example of press spin, not to mention shallow science reporting, just read the New York Times and glance through the headlines on any given day. The latest example is a headline reading "Study Finds That Teenage Virginity Pledges Are Rarely Kept."  Although I have a bone to pick with cultural conservatives, I'll get to them later. Now I'm going to pick on the left-leaning bias of the press, and slipshod reporting when it comes to matters of science.  I've scanned several news sources, and all pretty much ape the New York Times' coverage of this story, some nearly word-for-word: 88% of teens who take a pledge not to have premarital sex wind up breaking it, and those kids have almost (almost) as much risk for developing STDs. Therefore, the press suggests, the study "challenges the assumptions underlying the Bush administration's promotion of abstinence programs."  Pfaugh! If you ever needed proof that reporters are, for the most part, completely ignorant about science, and tend to be reactionary about conservative ideals, you can look no further. Not only is the negative spin ridiculous, but they don't see fit to name the study or where you can go to read a copy of the original. Most of the press accounts haven't bothered to point out that these abstinence programs were first brought to the national scene by the Clinton administration, either. The Bushies have only continued what the Clintonistas created.   But let's look at what the press accounts tell us, when you ignore the spin and look at the (rather measly) data they've actually reported about the study:  1) 12% of the kids keep their pledge and never have sex before marriage. If I told you I could reduce the rate of heart disease or cancer by 10% with a certain program, almost any doctor on the planet would consider that exciting news.  Indeed, just this week, physicians everywhere were excited to learn that certain drugs reduce risk of heart disease by 16%, and as high as 26% in some cases. So it seems to me that if we can confidently state that abstinence programs reduce teen sexual activity by more than 10%, they cannot rationally be called a failure. The numbers could be better, but then again, these programs are in their infancy and might well be modified to improve those odds.  2) All the press accounts say that the kids who take the abstinence pledge wind up contracting STDs at almost--almost!--the same rate as kids who don't take it. Implication: there's probably a minor reduction.  3) The press accounts all acknowledge that kids who took the pledge delayed onset of sexual activity by an average of 18 months. This is a huge reduction.  4) Mysteriously, not a single one of the press accounts mentions pregnancy. But why is it that I find it impossible to believe that kids who delay having sex by an average of 18 months, with 12% of them never having sex at all before marriage, are likely to be a group of kids who have a lower overall unwed teen pregnancy rate? Why is this not in the reporting?  5) The press accounts all acknowledge that the kids who took the pledge are more likely to get married. They also say the kids who take the pledge and break it "wind up having sex before marriage," but what percentage of those are kids who have sex with their fiance/fiancee? They don't bother saying.

      This just in from Mark Penner and the ViBi (Visual Bible for Japanese Deaf) project.    Webcam sessions with our translator in Japan are going well. Long distance communication is sometimes frustrating, not to be able to point to a word in his Hebrew interlinear, draw a map or write out a character, but we're making good progress nontheless. Last night, we finished our first draft through Genesis 15. I work evening/night hours to adjust to Japan time, and try to catch up on sleep in the mornings.   One big challenge we face is making or finding Sign Language place names for the many towns, cities, and countries in the Bible. For the genealogical lists and passages like Genesis 10's "List of Nations", we will run the names across the screen in Japanese, but where place names are not part of a list, we need sign names.   Names of people are sometimes a problem too. Deaf people make names for each other based on prominent physical characteristics or events in their lives. As long as we know something about the person, we can usually find a way to make a viable sign name, but when we know nothing at all, we have a problem (as in Adah and Zillah in Genesis 4:19-23).  Perhaps someone is looking for a way to help our project. If you are willing to look through the whole Bible for non-list people with no information about them in the text, that would help us prepare. If this sounds like something you'd like to try, drop me a line. Thanks.    Anybody want to take him up on that?

      It took me a while to get to the bottom of this, but it seems that there is something happening in regards to teaching evolution in the classroom.  Of course this is a subject that won't be reported fairly.  Here is what sparked my interest,  urlLink CNN.com - Ohioevolution lesson plan irks science groups - Mar 10, 2004  "Critics say the lessons contain elements of a theory called intelligent design, which states a higher power must have been involved in the creation of life."  So I thought it might be good to figure out what this "Intelligent Design" theory might be.  I found this article that is a presentation from some of the proponents of "ID" and rebuttals from evolutionary scientists.    urlLink Intelligent Design? A Special Report from Natural History Magazine     The main arguments that these guys seem to be proposing are,  1.  Irreducible Complexity, and 2.  Specified Complexity  "Irreducible Complexity" takes into account that at the molecular level "every cell contains many ultrasophisticated molecular machines."  The problem that this makes for evolutionary theory is that if you take away any one part of these machines the whole thing ceases to work.  Therefore it would have been impossible for these things to evolve but needed to be designed as a whole.    "Specified Complexity" uses statistical theory and mathematics to  determine whether something is occurring randomly or was designed by some intelligence.  Similar methods are used in hard sciences like archaeology and forensics for determining whether there was human involvement and in looking at radio waves coming from space looking for some kind of intelligent communication.  "ID" applies this same theory to human biology and "show that undirected natural processes like the Darwinian mechanism are incapable of generating the specified complexity that exists in biological organisms. It follows that chance and necessity are insufficient for the natural sciences and that the natural sciences need to leave room for design."  The evolutionary scientists and the Natural History journal shoot both of these down rather precursorily by lobbing shots at the examples that the "ID" proponents used in their explanations.  Looking at the  urlLink Discovery Institute   website I found that each of the proponents make a pretty good defense of their arguments.   Ok, now back to Ohio, and the CNN article that got my attention in the first place.  Well it turns out that the "ID" proponents already tried to get into the curriculum and failed. In this editorial in a Cincinatti newspaper,  urlLink  Don't let dogma censor teaching  it comes to light what people in Ohio already know.  This is not some religious coup over the science curriculum but the implementation of the state's science standards which requires students to know "how scientists continue to investigate and critically analyze aspects of evolutionary theory."  They are not even using the ID theory material.  But this is typical of an instance where science is overshadowed by political and philosophical debate.  The decision by the Ohio school board is not opening the door to religion being taught in the science classroom, it is not even knocking on that door.  The uproar is about whether evolution will even be allowed to be questioned any more!  But what is purpose of science if not to question?    My take on this whole thing is that the Discovery Institute is basically a few oddball scientists who are banding together to make their views heard because there is no other way the scientific community will listen to them.  What makes them a bit more potent is that there are some political and philosophical groups that stand to gain from their ideas.  I wonder what their motivations are?  If they are truly motivated by science and truth then I would encourage them to do some hard scientific work.  The examples that were given are really quite good, but they need to find 1000's of them.  The problem of course is that requires funding, and then there wouldn't be any scientific journal that would publish their findings.  Getting the scientific community to admit to an intelligent designer will be impossible.  But perhaps true scientific work in this direction could poke a few more holes in their Darwinian infallibility field.

      Japan is a famously insular society that is trying to adjust to the modern global society.  Things like this new website from the Justice Ministry don't help.   urlLink 'Fink-on-a-foreigner' Web site hit as xenophobic, faces review       Visitors to the site, launched Feb. 16, can enter the name, address or workplace of any suspicious foreigners. The report is then automatically sent to regional immigration bureaus, which have jurisdiction over workplaces where foreigners are employed.  Informants are asked to select a motive for reporting a foreigner from a list on the site. The reasons a foreigner can be reported include "causing a nuisance in the neighborhood" and "causing anxiety."   This is a throwback to the neighborhood "goningumi" of the Edo period that were for mutual help but were also used for surveillance and religious persecution.  The idea is that good Japanese citizens can keep an eye out for illegal aliens but what it will result in is harassment of anyone who has a neighbor who dislikes foreigners.

        urlLink CNN.com - U.S. missionaries knew the risks of helping Iraqis - Mar 16, 2004      This is part of the missionary life that people would like to forget, but in a very real way these missionaries laid down their lives long before they were gunned down by those they came to help.  David and Carrie McDonnall could have spent their first years of marriage getting ahead but chose to sacrifice the "American Dream" and lay down their lives for the Iraquis.  Larry and Jean Elliott had already given their lives for over 20 years in Honduras and when they could have settled down for a well-deserved retirement they chose to go to Iraq instead.  Karen Watson quit her job with California's Kern County Sherrif's Department to become a missionary.     Every missionary gives up a life that they could have led.  They give up seeing friends and family.  I think one of the hardest things for me is not getting to know new family members back home, not seeing children until they are almost grown, finding my parents have gotten older each time I go back to visit.    A missionary call is a call to go and die.  The Apostle Paul said "I die daily!"  Every single day I could choose to hang it up and go home and live for myself.  Every day that these missionaries worked in Iraq, they could have said, "No more, I can't take the fear and the strain and the thankless work -- I am going home."  But they chose to stay because of God's great love.  God has taken them home where there is no fear and no strain and much reward.  Pray that their sacrifice would not be in vain, but that many Iraqis would see their unselfish love and many more missionaries would be inspired to give their lives - daily.

      CHRISTIAN ARRESTED, TORTURED IN SAUDI ARABIA  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  International Christian Concern 2020 Pennsylvania Ave. NW #941  Washington DC 20006-1846, USA Email: icc@persecution.org   RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA (ANS) -- The Washington-DC based human rights group, International Christian Concern (ICC) www.persecution.org, has just become aware that on Thursday, March 25th, 2004, Mr. Brian O'Connor, a Christian ex-pat Indian national, was arrested by the Muttawa (religious police) on the streets of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. ICC is being told from a highly reputable source that the Muttawa abducted, imprisoned, and tortured him in a Mosque. Mr. OConnor is presently being held at the Olaya police station in Riyadh.   Mr. OConnor has received visitors and has communicated that his legs were chained and he was hung upside down and they played football with me. The Muttawa came in turns of fours and kicked me in the chest and rib area, and this continued up to 2 AM on Friday morning. He also says that he was whipped on his back and the soles of his feet by electrical wires and is in much pain as he walks. He also reports that he is in intense pain, and thinks that a rib may be broken.   The police at the Olaya police station state that he is being held on account of preaching Christianity, drug related charges, and for selling liquor. They went on to add that these charges were brought up by the Muttawa, and they have no direct proof of the claims made by them. It is typical for charges of drug dealing to be leveled at Christians suspected of spreading the Gospel. The Police also stated that the Muttawa were the ones who interrogated him and not the Police themselves. The Muttawas have informed Brian that he is to be formally charged on these 3 points and will be taken to court where the case would take about 6 to 7 months before a verdict is issued.  Brian OConnor is known to be an upstanding citizen in the community and is a Christian. It is not known yet if the Muttawa have forced him to sign documents of admission to the crimes he is charged with. It has been common practice in Saudi that during torture, the Muttawas force Christians to sign documents in Arabic, which they were told are release papers. Later, they find out that they signed documents admitting to crimes of drug trafficking, etc  ICC is very concerned that the Saudis, who claim to be the United States partners in the war on terror, have continued to imprison, torture and deport expatriate Christians workers in Saudi Arabia. We are asking that the United States take serious action in demanding not only the release of Brian, but a formal apology be made, and the immediate reinstatement to his position with Saudi Airlines. We are also very concerned about his present physical condition and are asking for an immediate report on his health, confirmed by a doctor.

      CHRISTIAN CHILDREN FORCED TO BECOME NOVICE BUDDHIST MONKS BY BURMESE REGIME  From: Christian Solidarity Worldwide  For Immediate Release  BURMA/INDIA (ANS) -- Children from Christian families in Burma between the ages of five and ten have been lured from their homes and placed in Buddhist monasteries. Once taken in, their heads have been shaved and they have been trained as novice monks, never to see their parents again.   In a visit to Chin and Kachin refugees in New Delhi and Mizoram State, India, earlier this month, CSW heard accounts of cultural genocide and religious persecution and discrimination. The Burmese regime's forces offer incentives to impoverished villagers to convert from Christianity to Buddhism in Chin state, an area which is 90 percent Christian.  Mountain top crosses have been destroyed and villagers forced to build Buddhist pagodas in their place, often having to contribute finances and labor.   Christians are required to obtain permits for special events, and for any renovation or construction work. No permission for new church buildings has been given since 1994. Christians in the civil service are discriminated against, and no Christian can rise beyond the rank of Major in the regime's army.   In addition to overt religious persecution, the Burmese junta, the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) has adopted a deliberate policy of introducing crude alcohol to Chin State. The Chin culture forbids alcohol, but the SPDC has brought in large quantities of methylated spirits/industrial alcohol, which it sells cheaply on the streets to teenagers and young parents, especially on Sundays when people go to church. The medical effects include addiction, jaundice, toxic liver failure and damage to brain cells, in some cases leading ultimately to death. One Chin Christian told the CSW delegation, "It causes the breakdown of body, mind, spirit and society."  Forced labor, a serious human rights violation, occurs "on a daily basis," often disrupting church and community activities. CSW received a copy of a recent letter from an SPDC commander to a village headman dated December 13 2003 demanding 40 porters from one village and 30 from another. In another area of Chin State, villagers were forced to porter from December 20 2003 until January 19 2004, and were therefore unable to celebrate Christmas and New Year in their communities.  The visit was conducted jointly by CSW-UK and CSW-Australia. CSW is one of only a handful of international organizations to visit the Chin and Kachin. One Chin refugee told the delegation: "Many foreigners go to Burma's eastern border in Thailand, but until now no one has come to us. We used to pray for foreign NGOs to come to the western borders, and we used to weep when no one came." A Kachin refugee said: "It is true that we feel we are known by no one." The Chairman of the Chin National Front said: "Your coming here is a God-send."  CSW is calling on the international community to respond to these reports of human rights violations in western Burma, which add to the catalogue of evidence of atrocities perpetrated throughout the country by the junta.   "The forgotten Chin and Kachin peoples of Burma urgently need their voice to be heard," said Baroness Cox, a deputy speaker of the British House of Lords and CSW-UK's Honorary President, who led the delegation to India. "We appeal to the international community to increase pressure on the regime to stop its policies of ethnic cleansing, religious persecution, cultural genocide, forced labour and torture. We also urge other international Non-Governmental Organizations currently providing humanitarian assistance on the Thai-Burmese border to consider taking up the plight of the refugees and Internally Displaced People in the western regions of Burma too."  For more information or a copy of the report, please contact Richard Chilvers, communications manager, CSW on +44 (0) 20 8329 0045 or email richard.chilvers@csw.org.uk or visit www.csw.org.uk.

      Wednesday, March 31, 2004   ITALIAN MISSIONARY WORKER KILLED IN UGANDA Murder comes less than two weeks after Americans were shot   By: Stefan J. Bos Special Correspondent, ASSIST News Service   KAMPALA, UGANDA (ANS) -- A 76-year-old Italian missionary has been killed in northern Uganda, less than two weeks after an American missionary couple was murdered in the troubled East African nation. Comboni missionary Father Luciano Fulvi was found dead in his room in the Layibi mission, outside Gulu, 360 kilometers (225 miles) north of the capital Kampala, the Missionary News Service Agency (Misna) reported Wednesday, March 31.  Misna said the killing may have been carried out by bandits who apparently climbed over the walls surrounding the missionary compound, where people often seek refuge to escape attacks by rebels of the feared Lord's Resistance Army.   On March 18 American missionary workers Warren and Donna Pett and student Isaac were also killed by money seeking gunmen who raided their Esther Evangelical School of Technology in the village of Aringa, about 496 kilometers (310 miles) northwest of Kampala, Africa Inland Mission said.   Father Fulvi was originally from the Italian diocese of Pescia, in the province of Lucca. Misna said that a fellow priest at the mission noticed the Father Fulvi's door was open after he went to bed on Tuesday night. The colleague called out to him, but getting no response thought he was asleep and shut the door.   POOL OF BLOOD  It was only the next day after Father Fulvi did not show up for mass and that neither his bicycle nor car had been touched, that this colleagues went to his room and found him lying in a pool of blood, Misna said.   Father Fulvi first arrived Uganda in 1956 and stayed until 1964 before continuing his work in England and Scotland. He returned to Uganda 1990 and stayed there to carry out pastoral services and teach young people, Misna said.   The priest lived through difficult times, including the outbreak in his region of the deadly Ebola virus in 2000 which killed scores of people.   "OPEN FOR EVERYONE"  However "he was extremely open and had a smile for everyone. He never feared the difficulties presented by missionary life, particularly in the dramatic context of North Uganda, said MISNA editor-in-chief Father Giulio Albanese, who met him in the Layibi mission around three weeks ago, along with a journalist.   With the death of Father Fulvi, 14 Comboni missionary Fathers and one Sister have been killed in the past twenty years in various circumstances in Uganda, Misna reported. Up to 4,000 priests and lay people are active for the Comboni Missionaries, an international Catholic group dedicated to spread the Gospel "and serving the poor, and working for the Reign of God."  The Comboni Missionaries were founded in 1867, by missionary priest Daniel Comboni (1831-1881), who was born in the small town of Limone sul Garda (Brescia, Italy). He struggled against the slave trade in Central Africa, set up centers for the education and training of Africans, and became the first bishop of Khartoum (Sudan), the organization said

      UN OFFICIAL IN CHINA AS CHURCH LEADER IS TORTURED FOR LEADING PEOPLE TO CHRIST  Visit aimed at monitoring human rights abuses  By: Stefan J. Bos Special Correspondent, ASSIST News Service   BEIJING / NEW YORK (ANS) -- The United Nations said Wednesday, March 31, its special rapporteur on torture, Dutchman Theo van Boven, is heading to China, amid fresh reports that Christians are suffering abuse in jails and prison camps. China Aid Association (CAA), a religious rights watchdog, said it had learned that 72-year old Mr. Chen Jingmao, a South China Church leader from Yunyang County, Chongqing City, was recently beaten and crippled in his prison as a punishment "for leading 50 prison inmates to the Christian Faith."  Citing un unidentified "reliable source in the prison" the organization claimed that on February 6, 2004 Chens legs were broken "in a beating he received by the prison guards." CAA said that Chen must now "be carried by fellow believers to go to the toilet, and to eat." The source was quoted as saying that during Chens beating the guards said that his action, of bringing others to Christianity, had brought shame upon the Communist Party."

      I am going to see "The Passion of the Christ" tonight.  Perhaps the only thing that bothers people more than the cross is the idea of the judgment of God on those who disobey Him.  Here is an article on Hell from Richard J. Foster.   urlLink TheOOZE - A Letter About Hell:  Richard J. Foster    In setting forth their case Universalists inevitably make the person and teaching of Jesus the center of their appeal. Jesus love and grace and compassion, and his assurance to us of Gods unconditional love and grace-filled acceptance. All true realities, to be sure. But, and here is the fatal flaw in all Universalist teaching,  this Jesus to whom they appeal so ardently is the very one who teaches more emphatically about hell than anyone else in the entire Bible.  This is a reality we simply cannot get around. Jesusthe compassionate Jesus, the forgiving and accepting Jesusnever flinches when it comes to the subject of eternity.   Jesus' Authoritative Witness  Throughout his preaching Jesus holds forth twoand only twopossibilities for human existence: everlasting happiness in the presence of God or everlasting torment in the absence of God. In the judgment of the nations recorded in Matthew where we hear those famous lines, I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you gave me clothing, I was sick and you took care of me, I was in prison and you visited me we also read that the Son of Man welcomes the righteous into the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world and says to the wicked you that are accursed, depart from me into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. And Jesus final summation to this story: And these (the wicked) will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life (Matt. 25:31-46). Now, we can legitimately argue about whether the eternal fire is literal or metaphorical, but we cannot argue over whether or not Jesus is intending to teach us that there are two final possibilities for human existence. He did not leave that matter open for debate.  This fact is reinforced in the Gospel of John which, although it actually says very little about hell, does record Jesus words, the hour is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice and will come out-those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of condemnation (John 5:28-29). We simply cannot sneak around the fact that Jesus teaches that there are two outcomes to human destiny: the resurrection of life . . . the resurrection of condemnation.  Jesus word about the reality of hell is unambiguous. In the story about the rich man and Lazarus, the rich man, after death, is described as In Hades, where he was being tormented and later in the story this place is described as this place of torment. Im sorry, I wish I could make the story sound better. Or have a happier ending. You remember, Im sure, how the rich man pleads with Father Abraham to have mercy on me and is told that this is not now possible and that between you and us a great chasm has been fixed (Luke 16:19-31).  Equally unambiguous is Jesus word that not all will enter the Kingdom life which, of course, includes heaven as its natural outcome. When a fearful disciple asks the Master, Lord, will only a few be saved? Jesus replies, Strive to enter through the narrow door; for many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able (Luke 13:23-24, see also Matt. 7:13-14). As if this exchange were not enough Jesus next adds, go away from me, all you evildoers! There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrown out (Luke 13: 27-28).  I could go on, but perhaps these sample passages make sufficiently clear Jesus teaching on the matter. The epistles only reinforce Jesus outlook. Paul says that those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. . . . will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction, separated from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might. (2 Thess. 1:8-9). And Johns Apocalypse simply seconds and thirds the teaching: the devil . . . was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever, and then adds, as for the cowardly, the faithless, the polluted, the murderers, the fornicators, the sorcerers, the idolaters, and all liars, their place will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death (Rev. 20:10, 21:8).

      This just in from Mark Penner, working on the visual sign language bible for the Japanese deaf.  This really gives you an idea of the complexity of the work that he is doing.  It is fascinating!    Thanks for praying. My trip to Japan is almost over--I return to the U.S. today. Mostly I was working with Yoshi on the meaning check. For those who are new, a meaning check is when we show a draft of the translation to a signer unfamiliar with the Bible, and have them tell us what it says. It's amazing what you discover when you do this. Parts of the translation that seemed perfectly clear turn out to be saying something other than we thought, or arent understandable at all. Needless to say, this takes a lot of time. You want to ask questions that draw out what the listener understood without clueing them in to the right answer.  What else takes time? Any number of things. Just now, we were going over Gen. 1:8 God called the expanse heaven. Yoshi and his translation helper spent a good 10 minutes discussing whether to end the sentence with a fingerpoint, with its called, with a single strong head nod, or a multiple firm head nod. And yes, though any one of the options were valid, it did make a difference in the flavor of the translation. Sign language operates in a completely different realm than spoken languages!  Weve also spent hours on the transition between Gen 1:1 and 1:2, trying to render the text accurately in a way that leaves room for the many alternate interpretations (just as the original language text does and as printed language Bibles do). Of course, Gen 1 is the hardest part of the whole Bible for Sign Language translations, since it is so far outside the scope of anything anyone in the Deaf community has experienced, yet needs to be portrayed with a certain degree of visuality in order to communicate. Translation has gotten easier as weve gotten into the Noah and Abraham passages.  Do keep praying. Mark and Mary Esther leave for Kansas the day after Mark gets back from Japan. Pray for a good time of reconnecting with their church there.  Mark

      Pray for our brothers and sisters in China!  Monday, April 5, 2004   TORTURED CHINESE HOUSE CHURCH LEADERS TESTIFY FOR FIRST TIME AT U.N. Meeting reveals torture and sexual abuse on large scale, human rights group claims   By Stefan J. Bos Special Correspondent, ASSIST News Service   GENEVA / BUDAPEST (ANS) -- Persecuted Chinese House Church leaders, including tortured and sexually abused women, have for the first time testified at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights amid claims that the Beijing government is increasing pressure on unregistered churches and active believers, ASSIST News Service (ANS) learned Monday April 5.  The Christian Aid Association (CAA), which investigates the plight of persecuted Christians, said a two-hour hearing held Friday, April 2, at the 60th annual meeting of the U.N. Commission in Geneva was aimed at showing the suffering of some of at least 8,903 Chinese believers who it claims were arrested and detained in the last 10 years.  Armed with documents and a video recording of recently released female prisoners, the CAA painted a grim picture of Communist China's attitude towards active Christians. As an example CAA President Bob Fu said that feared Chinese security forces used torture as a weapon to gather "false evidence" against a pastor of the rapidly growing evangelical South China Church.   "At least three believers were tortured to death, many men and women believers were tortured and many, especially women, were sexually abused and molested during their interrogation to obtain false evidence against Pastor Gong, he told the U.N. Commission, according to a transcript obtained by the ANS Central and Eastern Europe Bureau in Budapest.  "MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARED"  He said that Pastor Gong Shengliang was accused of having raped 15 female members of his church, but that in a retrial the "so-called rape victims" were reduced to four unnamed persons. In addition the so-called "hard" evidence against the pastor "mysteriously disappeared," he added.   The U.N. Commission was shown a video containing testimonies from the recently released women prisoners, which the CAA said "shows more evidence of how coerced confessions were taken from these female members in extreme and inhuman torture including numerous cases of sexual abuse."  Three South China Church officials, who were among 15 women originally interrogated, claimed in video interviews that they were forced into accusing the pastor of false rape charges.   "They questioned me for about a month. When I didnt answer them, they would use different kinds of ways to torture me. For instance, they hung my two hands up on the door frame, and my feet couldnt touch the floor," said one of them, identified as 35-year old Cao Hongmei, who was jailed from August 2001 till August 2003 on charges of "intentionally harming others."   BAMBOO STICK  "My hands and shoulder became numb. They used a sharpened bamboo stick to beat my hands and shoulder. I couldnt bear this tremendous pain any more so I began to scream, but they didnt allow me to do so. They threatened me, "If you keep on shouting, we will stuff your mouth and make you shut up," she added, according to a video transcript obtained by ANS.   "Every time they hung me, it would last at least half an hour, sometimes even one hour. All together, they have hung me about a whole day," she recalled. "They also threatened me, saying, "We can beat you to death, and throw you into the Han River, or dig a hole somewhere to bury you. Who will question us about that? You count for nothing. They went on to say, Dont you know? A South China Church believer has been beaten to death by the police in Zhong Xiang, just because she kept silent and didnt confess. After her death, nobody has come to us asking for an account. So we also can beat you to death, because you little believers count for nothing.  "All they wanted from me was a false testimony. They said, "If you just confess according to what we tell you, I will release you and let you go." Because she kept silent, the Chinese security forces soon used other torture techniques, she claimed.   "They used handcuffs to pound my fingers. One of them would hold my elbow, and the other one used a pair of handcuffs to hammer my fingers. My fingers began to bleed and my fingernails began to break but they were not fully satisfied. Then they used a cigarette lighter to burn my fingers. All my fingernails had been burned, and you still can see the scars here. My middle fingernail was totally broken, and this is the newly grown one. Not only did they burn my fingernails, they also use the lighter to burn my ears, my face, and my lips. They used all these tortures forcing me to confess that I had (a) sexual relationship with Pastor Gong Shengliang."  "EVIL CULT"  Another South China Church leader, 33-year old Liu Xianzhi, was jailed and in a labor camp from May, 2001 till February this year on charges "organizing and using evil cult organization to obstruct the implementation of the law,." CAA said. She recalled the horrors of sexual abuse and torture in the video presentation shown to the U.N. Commission.  On one occasion she was "taken to Zhongxiang Police Training Center (where) six or seven male policemen started to question me in their dormitory. One asked me, "Do you know why we arrest you?" I said, "Because I believe in Jesus." He slapped my face when he heard this. He said, "Do you know what age we are in today? And you still believe in Jesus?" I didnt answer him back."  The young woman added she was "put in shackles and the policemen" and that they ordered her to walk before them in the room. "The shackles were heavy; after a little while I had to slow down, but they wouldnt let me. They pushed me from this side to the other side while laughing at me. I was so exhausted and ended up laying on the ground. The shackles also cut deeply into my flesh, and my ankle began to bleed. You can see the scar here," she showed, according to a video transcript.  DEATH THREATS  "They also picked me up by my hair, so the weight of my whole body was held up by my hair. I could hardly breathe, then they put me down, but kept on pressuring me to confess I had sexual relationship with Pastor Gong. When I told them I didnt have any improper relationship with him, they pulled my hair again, later I lost my consciousness. When I refused to read the confession that they had prepared for me beforehand, they threatened me by saying, "Now, I can beat you to death, and pull you out and bury you somewhere, that even your family wouldnt know where you are. Now your South China Church is in our hands, including your pastor. He was also arrested!"  When she told the police she had no sexual relationship with Pastor Gong "they used an electrical rod" to beat her. She said the police beat her on her head, her breast, and buttock. "I was knocked to the floor, then they pulled me up and tore my clothes open. They even pulled my bra, and I cried." Her South China Church colleague, 29 year old Meng Xicun was arrested in May 2001 and only released in February from a labor camp after being charged with "organizing and using evil cult organization to obstruct the implementation of the law" and undergoing torture sessions.  She recalled how when was initially forced to stand five days and five nights and that when she was tired and fell asleep police would beat her. They allegedly also insulted the young woman. "They flicked their cigarette ash into my collar. Later they untied my shirt, and flicked the cigarette ash to my breast. I felt so humiliated, I didnt understand why they treated me like this."  LOSING CONSCIOUSNESS  Meng Xicun said that often several men took turns to beat her and that her body became bruised and later started beating her with a high- voltage electrical rod.   When she still refused to accuses her pastor of rape "several policemen came in" and pushed her to the ground. "They dragged me around in the room by pulling my hair. One police kicked me on my stomach and my waist. Even today I still feel the pain. I lost my consciousness seven times. One time when I re-gained consciousness, I heard one police talking to another saying, "Dont waste our time. After all, the South China Church is in our hands, we will make sure Gong Shengliang gets a death sentence. Why dont we just get her fingerprint now? "But the other police said, "This wont work. Lets use cold water to wake her up."  When that did not work and she refused to sign "a written testimony by themselves" a policeman reportedly said: "You have tasted the good treatment minutes ago, now we will have better ones for you." Then "they started another round of torturing me. This time, they tore my clothes and bra, using electrical rod to touch my breast and jab my other private place. I couldnt bear this kind of humiliation. How could I? I could bear other kind of tortures, but not this one, I felt like I had broken down."  Police officials allegedly told her that she would "die in vain, because nobody knows where you are, and we can just bury you somewhere, even your family wont know. You know, we can just make you disappear, and we dont have to take any responsibility for that. At the end her "hands were trembling at their dictation." And "my heart was struggling, because I knew this would be the so called evidence which the police would use to accuse Pastor Gong Shengliang. Its not fair to him at all, " she said.   INNOCENT MAN  "But I had no other choice in that situation, I kept on writing down what the police instructed me. When I finished, I couldnt stand still, I lost consciousness. It was too painful for me to accuse an innocent man, because Pastor Gong is a good man, he has never done such a thing... But the police were determined to put him to death as a rapist based on the coerced testimony. After I finished, I had no desire for life any more. I felt like I had already died by doing this. But it is too late, the police had already got what they wanted to accuse Pastor Gong.  The revelations of the young women came as the U.N. prepared to investigate torture in China. CAA said it hopes the investigations will help the estimated 80 million members of house church groups and churches across China. CAA claimed it has a document from China's Religious Affairs Bureau, of Qingdao City, Shandong province showing that the Chinese government intensified a campaign against innocent, unregistered churches and their believers since the end of 2002. It suggests that "Those who are deeply affected by self-proclaimed preachers, oppose patriotic religious bodies and defy the governments administration shall be "educated" and "transformed through compulsory study of the governments religious policy and regulations."  The founder of China's largest Christian movement, Pastor Peter Xu Yongze and dubbed the Billy Graham of China, was arrested and imprisoned five times for over seven years in China and experienced severe torture and persecution. He told the U.N. gathering in Geneva that "Christians in China desire to live respectful and law abiding lives. Christians have been recognized as being a force for social stability and respect fort the law. Yet they continue to be persecuted for simply adhering to their faith according to their consciences. We do not seek confrontation and we are patriotic to our nation. All we ask is to be able to practice our faith freely. "  RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION  Pastor Peter Xu urged the Chinese government to stop all kinds of religious persecution for all believers and to release all prisoners of conscience including the Chinese House Church historian Mr. Zhang Yinan. Zhang was arrested on September 26, 2003 and sentenced for two-year re-education through labor on October 27, 2003 by the authority of Pingdingshan City, Henan province on charges of an attempt to subvert the national government."   The latest crackdown on especially evangelical Christians have been linked to concern among Communist authorities about the growing number of Christians in China, which analysts say is experiencing the fastest church growth in the world. There was no official reaction on the latest reports, but the Chinese government has said it is only acting against "dangerous cults."  Friday's U.N. meeting was chaired by Lord Chan of Oxton, Member of the British Parliament, House of Lords, Chairman of Chinese in Britain National Forum and Chairman of the Chinese Overseas Christian Mission, CAA said Among other speakers were renowned human rights campaigner Harry Wu, a Catholic, also spoke on the issue of religious persecution in China.

       urlLink Bandits Attack Christian Churches in Osaka    OSAKA -- Masked bandits raided and robbed two Christian churches in Osaka Prefecture on the weekend, leaving a reverend injured after they hurled acid onto his face, police said.  The 54-year-old reverend from the Hirano Evangelical Church in Osaka's Hirano-ku sustained only minor injuries in the Sunday botched burglary and is expected to make a full recovery.  His church fared a little better, with the robbers leaving empty handed even though they broke a window to get in, but were soon discovered by the man of the cloth who had been alerted by a burglar alarm.  A day earlier, the same three bandits forced their way into another Christian church in nearby Sakai, stealing 3,000 yen in cash and a personal computer.  Investigators believe the two cases are linked because they were both carried out by a group of three men wearing the same sort of full face masks.

      Daylight Savings   urlLink The Blog From Another Dimension: Daylight Savings     For Americans living in Japan, please note that DST took effect yesterday in the U.S., so the times have shifted. Remember to add that extra hour when you translate times--or to subtract the hour if you count backwards when you translate.  I don't like using the "count backwards" 16- or 17-hour (west coast, PST) subtraction method of figuring out the time difference between here and there; 16 and 17 hours is a bigger number to subtract, and more often you cross day lines and it gets confusing, making errors that can wake your relatives up at unfortunate hours.  I prefer to add 7 or 8 hours (again, PST), then subtract a day. Two steps, separate, a lot easier to do. So right now, it's 11:40 am on Monday in Japan. Add 8 hours (now that DST has kicked in; last week, it was 7 hours), making the time there 7:40 pm--and that by itself is often enough, the day of the week is not important, in my family at least. But if necessary, just subtract a day, and you get 7:40 pm Sunday in San Francisco.  I suppose it is less of an issue if the people you're calling are on the east coast, and the difference is to add 11 hours or subtract 13 (10 and 14 when DST is not in action). But I still prefer the addition method.  Speaking of which, when is Japan going to get DST? The sun comes up at 4:30 am in the summer, way earlier than most people need. Great for the farmers, who had a controlling block of votes many years back (I wonder if they still do?), but lousy for the rest of us as it means early darkness and wasted sunlight. And I'm a late owl, and on my late-late nights I go to sleep as the sun rises, which feels strange. I remember on my visit to Spain last April, they not only had DST ("summer time" in Europe), but Spain was on the west edge of a wide time zone--the sun set at about 9 pm. Maybe not great for early risers, but I thought it was terrific.

      It would seem that a couple of Japanese journalists are now missing in Iraq and might have been abducted.   urlLink  Yahoo! News - Report: 2 More Japanese Abducted in Iraq    This kind of thing reminds me of a couple of reporters who got killed a few years back covering the eruption of Mt. Unzen in southern Japan.  There is something wrong with the media (and those who watch -- that would be us) needing to have an eye-witness report of something that is clearly dangerous.  The reporters covering the volcanic eruption were going toward the volcano to get the story when everyone else was running away to save their lives.    Another example of this is during typhoon season when there is a mandatory shot of a reporter standing out in the winds and rain near the shore telling everyone at home that because of the typhoon they shouldn't go near there.  We have all seen a typhoon now (if you live in Japan) and we will take your word for it, you don't have to stand out there like an idiot!  Japan is a very safe country, (if you don't count the typhoons, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and sarin gas attacks by cultists in the subway, and occasional romps by Godzilla through Tokyo!)  so Japanese travelling to foreign countries are really quite vulnerable.  They just can't imagine that someone would actually want to hurt them.  This is a country where in a city of 24 million a woman can walk alone at night and be unconcerned about being harmed.  I have left a briefcase on a train, had it travel across the city and actually got it back!  When you are used to this kind of environment no wonder we have Japanese running into warzones and expecting to come through unscathed.

      Over at the mediatinker.com blog, another expat shares his frustration with trying to learn Japanese in this post,    urlLink Never Ending Study .  I thought I would share with you all the advice that I gave him.  This is the way I describe language learning.  Think of concentric or nested cups. The smallest cup in the middle is listening. Once you fill your listening cup then it will naturally overflow into the speaking cup. Likewise, when the speaking cup starts to overflow it will naturally go into the reading cup. Finally when the reading cup is full it is only natural to start writing.  Now is it possible to write when your listening cup is only half full? Of course, but it requires great effort. It doesn't flow.  My advice for the language learner. Find out where it is flowing and spend your time there. Don't be afraid of new challenges, but if it requires extreme effort, it probably is not helping you to become better at the language.  Of course none of this makes any sense at all unless there is a steady of stream being poured into the first listening cup. Even if you quit classes, make sure that you are still receiving steady Japanese input.  Good luck.  Jonathan

      Tuesday, April 13, 2004   HUNDREDS OF VIETNAMESE CHRISTIANS KILLED OVER EASTER WEEKEND  By Michael Ireland Chief Correspondent, ASSIST News Service   VIETNAM (ANS) -- An estimated 400 Christians have been killed in brutal repression of peaceful and prayerful demonstrations by Montagnard Christians in the Central Highlands of Vietnam, according to the Barnabas Fund, quoting information from The Montagnard Foundation.  The report states that on Saturday April 10 up to 400,000 Vietnamese Christians, from the Degar people, gathered in several Vietnamese cities to demonstrate against the governments refusal to allow them to follow the Christian faith freely.   "The demonstrators in the cities, which included the Central Highland city of Buonmathuot, were attacked by soldiers, police and other Vietnamese civilians. The Christians were shot at, beaten with electric batons and bombarded with rocks and stones. Hundreds were killed (400 according to one report) and many others have suffered broken bones," the Barnabas Fund said.  A press release on April 9 from the Montagnard Foundation, an organization representing the largely Christian Degar people, drew attention to the planned demonstrations, which were to include a specific call for the Vietnamese government to lift the embargo on international human rights monitoring in the Central Highlands area.   In a word of warning concerning the demonstrations the Foundation cautioned that Without the direct intervention of law abiding states, the UN and the European Commission, the repression against the Montagnards will be bloody.   The Montagnard Foundation believes this incident may spark a refugee crisis, with thousands likely to head for the Cambodian border. To add to the woes of these people, the Cambodians have closed this border to refugees.  In a statement issued after the demonstrations had begun, Kok Ksor, the President of the Montagnard Foundation said that no attempt was made by the Christians to use  violence. He also stated that the Christians are not seeking independence, merely the right to worship freely.  The Foundation has said, Our people cannot continue suffering this way as the Vietnamese government continues to arrest, electric shock torture, and kill our peaceful hill tribe people for being Christian or for trying to save our ancestral land from being confiscated.

      On the flight down to Nicaragua I sat next to a businessman who helped a telecom company train their managers there.  He had been to Nicaragua many times so I asked him what to expect.  He was pretty upbeat and said that the situation had improved a lot.  I said if there is one word that sums up the future of a nation it is "hope" and asked whether the Nicaraguans had it or not.  He said that he thought they did and then told me that he was also a Christian.  When I led a mission team to Cambodia back in the 90's there was very little hope in that country.  The people simply tried their best to hang on but many didn't make it.  In contrast when I went to Vladisvostok, Russia a few years later, it was obvious that people were hopeful about the future even though their lives were still very hard.  Calvary Chapel Managua is located in a very poor neighborhood "The Arbolito" but I could see a lot of hope on the faces there and I am sure that their ministry is having a lot to do with it.     urlLink       urlLink      We also found out that old school buses never die... they get sent to Nicaragua where they are used as city buses.   urlLink

      Well it took me a while to catch up with all my work... but now I can post a few stories about the mission trip to Mexico and Nicaragua and some pictures.  But first I want to share about our next big project.  We are going to start an international school here at Grace in September.      urlLink Announcing Grace International Christian School    I have recently seen a need for Christian education in Ome, and have been praying about what we should and can do to meet this need.  As I have prayed, I have been struck with the need not only for a Christian school in English that would affordably meet the needs of missionary and bicultural children, but also for similar Christian education to be available in Japanese.  I believe that God is leading us to open a Christian school here at Grace Christian Fellowship, beginning with an international school with instruction in English from September 2004 and continuing in the future with a sister school with similar instruction in Japanese.    Historically, one of the great missionary works in Japan has been the opening of schools and universities.  Many of the most well-known schools in Japan are "mission" schools.  Unfortunately, over the years, many of these schools have lost their commitment to educating students in Christ, and though they are very prestigious and expensive they have few Christian teachers or students.  It is time to start again from the foundation and make the Jesus the center.    Public education in Japan is also going through crisis, with large numbers of students who drop-out or simply refuse to go to school because they feel like failures or are bullied by their peers.  The numbers of these students has been increasing yearly.  If we were able to provide these children with a safe, loving environment in which to learn, it would be a tremendous witness of the love of Christ in Japan.  Another large trend in Japan is the increasing numbers of bicultural families, whether Japanese who have married a foreigner, Japanese who have lived overseas and are returning with children who must adjust to a country that seems foreign to them, or foreigners who are making a new life for themselves in Japan.  The Japanese school system was never designed to meet the needs of these families.  I am convinced that this presents us with a great opportunity to love them in a very practical way.    The needs are great and the opportunities for the gospel are great.  Please pray with us as we begin this new ministry.  Specifically, pray for the following,  	  Pray that we would be bold to trust God and wise not to get ahead of Him. 	  Pray that God would draw in the right students for the first school year.   	  Pray that God would provide teachers and helpers for the first school year. 	  Pray for favor with local officials and with the community.  God Bless You,  Jonathan

      Awesome ballet.  Just beautiful.  I was suprised at how much my heart was lifted up watching them dance and listening to the music.  Good for the soul.  We were also able to raise over $600 for the children in Nicaragua.  Praise God!

      This is a long piece but well worth the read.  It is really one more reason why it is imperative for Christian education to be reestablished in Japan.  WATCHING SHINTO NATIONALISM IN JAPAN   By Elizabeth Kendal World Evangelical Alliance Religious Liberty Commission (WEA RLC) Special to ASSIST News Service   AUSTRALIA (ANS) -- On 1 July, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported, "Education officials in southern Japan have defended their decision to monitor how loudly students and teachers sang the national anthem at recent school entrance and graduation ceremonies." ("Patriotism exam hits wrong note in Japan", by Julian Ryall in Tokyo for SCMP, 1 June 2004)  According to the SCMP report, members of the Board of Education for the city of Kurume visited 40 elementary and junior high schools, to monitor the degree to which students and teachers sang the national anthem, Kimigayo, with passion and gusto. The monitors categorised participation as "quiet", "medium" or "loud". The officials were also required to verify that the schools were displaying the Hinomaru (Rising Sun) national flag at the front of school halls. Apparently six schools failed to satisfy the Ministry of Education's patriotism monitors.  On 31 March, a total of 171 school teachers were reprimanded by the Tokyo board of education for refusing to follow their principal's orders to stand and sing the Kimigayo national anthem at commencement ceremonies held earlier that month at high schools run by the metropolitan government. (Japan Today. http://www.japantoday.com/ 1 April 2004 )  To understand why this issue threatens Japan's Christians and instils fear into Japanese Christian leaders and missions, we need to look at Japanese Christian history and see how Japanese Shinto nationalism has correlated with persecution of Japanese Christians and foreign missionaries in Japan over the centuries. Today only 1.5% of Japanese are Christian, and only about 0.4% are evangelical.   SHINTO JAPAN  Pure Shinto is an animist religion that focuses on supernatural spiritual forces inherent in nature. Shinto practice is centred around shrines where a "kami" is believed to reside in an object such as a stone. Local shamans represent the kami and avert evil spirits.  After Buddhism entered Japan in the 6th century, Shinto practice blended with Buddhism and Confucianism and Taoism and became more organised and structured. However, over the centuries a movement developed dedicated to the restoration of pure Shinto as the unique and original Japanese religion.  THE EMPEROR IS DIVINE AND TO BE WORSHIPPED  Inherent to Shinto is the belief that the gods exist in various ranks and the highest god of all, holding the supreme position, is the sun goddess, also known as the Ruler of Heaven, whose name is Amaterasu-o-mi-kami.  It is believed that Jimmu, Japan's first emperor who ascended to the throne in 660 B.C., was the grandson of the sun goddess, and was sent to earth to rule it. Since Jimmu, the emperors of Japan have therefore been said to be divine, functioning both as the high priest and the object of worship. (It was actually in 712 A.D. that the imperial court had this Shinto "history" written down in order to secure its dynasty.)  From this brief summary alone, it is easy to see why Japanese Christians consider the Japanese Hinomaru (Rising Sun) flag and the Kimigayo anthem which glorifies the emperor, to be idolatrous. The Hinomaru flag has also become a symbol of Japanese militarism (which is driven by Japanese Shinto belief).  HISTORY OF PERSECUTION - RELATED TO POWER AND JAPANESE NATIONALISM  The first known Christian missionary to Japan was Francis Xavier who arrived in 1549. Christian activity was concentrated around Nagasaki. At this time, Japan was ruled by "shoguns", or military dictators, who monopolised power whilst maintaining a faade of obedience to the emperor. Aiming to stop the spread of Christianity, Shogun Toyotomi Hideyoshi had 26 foreign and Japanese national Christians crucified in Nagasaki on 5 February 1597.  Shogun Tokugasa Ieyasu ruled Japan from 1600. Through the 1600-1700s there was severe persecution of Christians - primarily for political and power reasons - after an edict was declared to crush Christianity.  "The Kirishitan (Christian) band have come to Japan, not only sending their merchant vessels to exchange commodities, but also longing to disseminate an evil law, to overthrow true doctrine, so that they may change the government of the country and obtain possession of this land. This is the germ of great disaster, and must be crushed." (1603 edict: footnote 1)  In 1622, 51 Christians were executed at Nagasaki, and two years later 50 were burned alive in Edo (Tokyo). In 1633 some 30 missionaries were executed. During these years many Christians recanted to escape persecution while some 3,000 were executed and others died in prisons or in exile.  In 1865, communities that together totalled some 60,000 Kakure Kirishitan ("hidden Christians") were discovered in the Nagasaki area. These Christian communities had perpetuated the faith in hiding for two centuries.  PERSECUTION AND AGGRESSIVE EXPANSION - RELATED TO SHINTO NATIONALISM  In 1853, Japan opened its doors to Western trade. Then in 1868, after a brief civil war and palace coup, the shogunate was overthrown and the power of the emperor was restored. This incident is known historically as the "Meiji Restoration". Emperor Meiji instigated revolutionary changes that ushered in sweeping industrialisation, a restoration of Shinto nationalism, and Japanese expansionism, which was fuelled by the belief that Japan was endowed with a unique and divine ruler.  Emperor Meiji founded Japan's Yasukuni Shrine in 1869, which was dedicated to the "souls" of all the Japanese soldiers who would fall in conquest. Japan went to war against China in 1894 (with victory in nine months), against Russia in 1904 (with victory in 1905), and against Korea in 1907 (annexing Korea in 1910).  In the 1890's Shintoism was declared non-religious - that is, not a religious option, but the civic duty of all Japanese, and that included emperor worship.  Extreme nationalism exploded in Japan in the late 1920s and through the 1930s. Shinto was the official religion of Japan and Christians who refused to participate in Shinto ceremonies were accused of lacking patriotism and loyalty. In May 1932, Christian students created a mini-national crisis when they refused to bow in the Yasukuni Shrine. Authorities compromised, urging attendance at Shinto shrines as a non-religious civil manifestation of loyalty.  Shinto-based nationalism permeated every level of Japanese society. State Shinto became a powerful weapon in the hands of militarists keen to justify and glorify their policy of aggressive expansionism.  Japan's defeat in World War 2 precipitated a new constitution (1947) the included freedom of religion and the disestablishment of state Shinto, even disavowing the emperor's divinity. Yet there have always been those keen to revive the former ways, especially now, when Japan is searching for national identity and solutions to its moral problems.  Because of the demonic, spiritist, idolatrous nature of Shinto, Christians of conscience cannot participate in it. As such, Shinto nationalism has always produced discrimination against and persecution of Christians in Japan. Hence any revival of Shinto nationalism today will deeply disturb and threaten Japanese Christians.  MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND RESURGENT SHINTO NATIONALISM  When nationalism exploded in the 1930s, the government promoted Shinto nationalism initially and primarily through the Ministry of Education.  Could history be repeating itself?  In October 2003, the Ministry of Education instructed schools to fly the Hinomaru (Rising Sun) flag at enrolment and graduation ceremonies. It also said teachers and school staff must stand and sing the Kimigayo national anthem. According to the "Asahi Shimbun", about 250 teachers and staff have since been disciplined for failing or refusing to comply. These symbols only became legal again in August 1999. The school campaign is spearheaded by nationalist Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara, and implemented by the Tokyo Metropolitan Board of Education. (Link 1)  Today, teachers are being penalised for exercising their right to freedom of conscience in refusing to honour the Hinomaru flag or sing the Kimigayo anthem. Schools are being monitored by patriotism police who grade the gusto with which students and teachers sing the anthem, to see if they pass the patriotism test. (Link 2)  Japan has also been re-writing its history textbooks, redefining its aggressive expansionism as liberation, much to the horror of its Asian neighbours.  After World War 2, the Allied Command stripped the Yasukuni Shrine of its national identity and it became just another of Japan's religious institutions. Today however, the Yasukuni Shrine, which now harbours the "souls" of several convicted war criminals, is once again enjoying the patronage of Japan's political leaders.

       urlLink The Japan FAQ: Japanese Manners and Etiquette   This has a lot of suggestions for eating, taking your shoes off, bathing, and other things that Japanese do differently.  Some are more for formal occasions (think like "Miss Manners") and can be disregarded amongst friends.  Others are not just good manners but deeper parts of the culture and will result in acute embarassment either for you, or for your hosts.  One example of a faux pas happened when we had a team over from America.  One of the guys on the team had a birthday and so some of the girls got him a cake and went out to look for some candles to put on it.  They came back proudly with a box of short thick white candles which they lighted on top of his cake.  All the Americans were blissfully unaware but a ripple of shock went around the Japanese as they brought out the cake singing "Happy Birthday"  The candles were votive candles that are customarily lit on altars for the dead!  Of course the Japanese (and myself) all looked at each other and decided silently that what they didn't know wouldn't hurt them and we went on with the birthday party.

      President Bush gave a little history lesson recently that needs to be heard.   urlLink Remarks by the President at the United States Air Force Academy Graduation Ceremony : "In the years immediately after World War II ended, our nation faced more adversity and danger with the rise of imperial communism. In 1947, communist forces were pressing a civil war in Greece, and threatening Turkey. More than two years after the Nazi surrender, there was still starvation in Germany, reconstruction seemed to be faltering, and the Marshall Plan had not yet begun. In 1948, Berlin was blockaded on the orders of Josef Stalin. In 1949, the Soviet Union exploded a nuclear weapon, and communists in China won their revolution.  All of this took place in the first four years of the Cold War. If that generation of Americans had lost its nerve, there would have been no 'long twilight struggle,' only a long twilight. But the United States and our allies kept faith with captive peoples, and stayed true to the vision of a democratic Europe. And that perseverance gave all the world a lesson in the power of liberty."

      Rie and I watched "The Last Samurai" the other night and it was really a beautiful movie and very well done in many ways.  But at the end of the last battle there is a scene where Katsumoto as the last Samurai commits ritual suicide.  At the same time Rie and I looked at each other and said, "So what is Tom Cruise going to do?"  Without missing a beat I said, "He is American, he'll go back and get the girl."  And that is exactly what he did.  So much for the Samurai spirit.

      Here is another one from Mayumix   urlLink Ayamari Samurai : "Buzz phrase in our (typical Japanese) office lately is 'Ayamari Samurai', that is Ayamari means to apologize and Samurai is Samurai.  How this phrase is used is, for example, in an office meeting discussing for some trouble. At some point of discussion where people gave up for good solution idea, guys suddenly turns their face to younger one and says in very playful tone ' You've got to be Ayamari zamurai' One chosen is younger but enough experienced to understand what he must do. He immediately reply in playful tone ' OK, I would be Ayamari zamurai' then this guy make an appointment to the customer to report trouble, apologize about it and discuss alternative solution. And work continues.  No idea where this phrase comes from, could be from some Manga? Anyway I like to hear this phrase in the office. It sounds comical yet implies very message that in business there is occasion that some one has to take unpleasant role for further business regardless of any fault of them or not. Taking such business role for fight in the business war, Samurai is such a warrior who never loses his pride and self-dignity. And turning trouble to further business is a good opportunity to show his ability. Samurai spirit is still surviving."

       urlLink Mayumix  wrote this on her blog and got me thinking about marriage.  Condition of Ideal husband for young Japanese women used to be described as 3 highs ( high education, high height and high income). Nowadays young women request not only 3 highs but also plus 3 lows (low conceit, low risk, low dependence) Yees, lady-first and self-managed are essential for modern men!!  If my memory is correct, days when 3 highs condition of ideal husband became popular?was Japans bubble age when money was everything. Seeing 3 highs in detail, these 3 highs never ask personal quality. And apart from height, other 2 high were achievable with " work hard anyway" theory. I can now see how much 3 highs reflected?"getting rich is everything" mode of these days.  Then it's 21 century now and we are still walking hard time of extension of lost 10 years.. So there comes a new concept of 3 lows for measuring men. In a new concept, two out of three is about personal quality. A sense of value like conceit level and personality like dependency level are quite essential scales for both men and women making a good match! Grad that such a personal qualities are now spotlighted. I wonder is it too early to please that Japanese social scale comes to gain humanity ?? (I disagree with low risk bit though)    I think that what women really want in a man is a person that they can respect.  And who loves them unselfishly.    As for the three highs, well none of them guarantee that that guy will treat you well or stay with you.    Let's see about the three lows.  Low conceit can mean that he thinks more about you than about himself, and doesn't expect you to serve him.  That might mean that he loves you.  Like the last comment I don't really get what this means.  If it means that he makes wise decisions for the family rather than chasing after rainbows then that might be someone you can respect.  Low-dependance is a little harder.  I am afraid that women might take this to mean that he won't need anything from you.  But then why get married?  The woman is going to be part of this relationship too after all.  A marriage will take 100% from both if it is going to work.  If it is 50%-50% then you don't have a marriage, you have a business contract.

      Last month Japan was shocked by the murder of an elementary school girl by her 11-year-old classmate.  One of the things that makes it very difficult here is that there really is no pastoral care given to these children or their teachers.  The only thing that Japan has to offer is psychological counseling.  There is no chaplaincy for the Japanese police, fire departments, or military either when they deal with trauma.  This is a huge need in Japanese society!    Many students still traumatized by girl's murder    Yomiuri Shimbun  Psychologists have concluded that about half of the children who received counseling after an 11-year-old girl allegedly killed her classmate with a box cutter early this month require continued treatment, The Yomiuri Shimbun learned Tuesday.  Teachers at Okubo Primary School in Sasebo, Nagasaki Prefecture, also have been emotionally strained by the killing, with some confiding that they felt distressed when appearing in public. In some cases, their symptoms worsened as time passed, and the Sasebo Municipal Board of Education is concerned that the teachers may be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.  Three clinical psychologists were appointed immediately after Mitarai was killed to provide counseling to the school's pupils and teachers. About half of the 71 children who sought treatment for trauma have reported feeling better since they received counseling, but the remainder reportedly require continued psychological care.  In a questionnaire conducted by the psychologists, many pupils wrote they were friends of the girls, and that they were upset over the incident.  Over half of the about 20 teachers who received psychological counseling said they felt pangs of guilt over the killing, and that the incident had adversely affected their health. "The teachers' psychological condition seems to be more acute than that of the pupils," an education board official said.

Researchers from York University in Canada carried out tests on 104 people between the ages of 30 and 88.  They found that those who were fluent in two languages rather than just one were sharper mentally.  Writing in the journal of Psychology and Ageing, they said being bilingual may protect against mental decline in old age.  Previous studies have shown that keeping the brain active can protect against senile dementia.  Research has shown that people who play musical instruments, dance or read regularly may be less likely to develop the condition.  Other activities like doing crosswords or playing board games may also help."

       urlLink Sapporo starts daylight saving time experiment   Interesting article on an experiment going on up in Hokkaido.  But instead of having everyone set their clocks an hour ahead, they just tell all the employees to come to work an hour earlier!  The sun rises here around 4:30 am and sets around 6:00.  Studies have been done that suggest that because sunset is during the evening traffic rush, thousands of accidents a year could be prevented if Japan went to daylights savings time.  But the main reason why they don't have daylights saving time is because the farmers are afraid it will mess up the cows milk!      Even though daylight saving time is applied in about 70 countries, attempts to introduce the system in Japan have not taken root.  The system was introduced in 1948, but abolished four years later. In 1999, a suprapartisan group of House of Councillors members tried to set up a law to introduce the system, but the effort did not succeed. The government is considering introducing the system, according to a 2002 guideline to counter global warming. In 2003, the Shiga prefectural government held an experiment similar to Sapporo's attempt.

       urlLink Achikochi: Tokyo, The World's Most Expensive City?    There we go again: The U.S. consulting firm Mercer Human Resource Consulting has published his yearly Cost of Living Survey. "Tokyo kept its number one spot as the world's most expensive city", according to Mercer's press release (June 13th).  Umbrellas for 100 yen, hamburgers for 59 yen and 1,000 yen haircuts - Tokyo offer them all. And yet can Tokyo be the most expensive city in the world? The answer is: No, absolutely not!  The Cost of Living Survey is designed to help companies decide the remuneration for executives posted overseas. It is thus weighted in favor of rented accommodation in well-heeled neighborhoods and items such as a Burberry-style raincoat that costs 70,000 yen (600 USD) in a Tokyo chain store but only 189 USD at an equivalent outlet in New York. The survey also emphasizes Western tastes in its basket of goods and services. Rice is not included, but white bread is, costing almost twice as much in Tokyo as in New York.  This survey is not the "Cost of Living Survey", but the "Expatriate Executive's Expensive Life Style Cost of Living Survey"   True, true!  There is a bubble down in Minato ward where the expats are where everything is expensive.  Come out to Ome and things get a lot cheaper.  The reason?  Land is cheaper.  Therefore rent is cheaper and it keeps trickling down.  The rent for an apartment downtown is easily 3 times as much, but then the commute from here is over an hour.

      Got a parking ticket today...    One of the facts of life in Japan is that there is never enough parking.  This week we have been shuttling cars over to Wakakusa park but they don't open their parking lot until 9:00am, exactly when the VBS program starts.  So I grab everyone's keys and move each car into the parking lot when it opens.  However, when I got back to the church our lot was full so I parked out on the street.  I intended to move it back in but forgot.  So around 11 or so I noticed the parking police out front and ran out to save one of the cars from getting a ticket.  The meter maid then asked me, "Do you have any cars in back?" and I said, "Nope, got them all parked over at Wakakusa."  Except I forgot about my own car!  Ouch!  I talked with the police for quite a while about where we could park for events.  There really isn't any.  Many churches in America will borrow parking from schools or businesses that aren't open on weekends, but even the schools here don't have parking and most businesses are open on the weekends.
