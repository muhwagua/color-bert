      but I'm only exceeding in making myself annoyed.  Ah, finally...   I am Ganon; I enjoy running around looking for the object known as the triforce. It's always around that time that it breaks into three pieces, and I'm stuck with just the triforce of power..   urlLink Which RPG villain are you?    Ugh, that was retarded. Who the heck is Ganon? O.o   Lemmie try to remedy that with this one...     My #1 result for the SelectSmart.com selector,  urlLink  Final Fantasy Dating Game  , is  Vincent      Ooooo... that's better n.n

      Especially when they bear a startling resemblance to zombies.  Just finished the short story by Richard Matheson titled 'I am legend'. Pretty scary if you ask me. Course I was reading it at midnight, while it was thunderstorming, with my bedroom door open. >.> Towards the end I was even afraid to have my feet uncovered.  Which brings me to my next thought. Why the heck would I be afraid to have my feet uncovered? As if that would be the first thing a vampire/zombie/werewolf/evil person would go after. It makes absolutely NO sense. Not to mention the fact that I'm lying under an unmagical blanket and sheet. The blanket could not even remotely save me from uncertain demise and for crying out loud, it's not like I sleep with my head under the blanket.  I make no sense.

      I'm avoiding my work.  First I read the entire history of manga and anime, explainations of expressions, hair colors, and why subbings suck. Next comes japanese culture history... perhaps I'll read that monday. Papers continue to pile up while I refuse to proof my work. See, the problem is I really need to proof my work, which makes it priority #1. Because I refuse to proof, I can't proceed to priority #2, editing the errors found during my proofs.  Ben ran off to Ohio to hang with Chad and Derek. He's hoping to see presidential hopeful John Kerry and sidekick John Edwards. Apparently John Glen's going to be there too. For some odd reason Ben Affleck is speaking--I guess he doesn't realize that his name isn't 'John.' Twit.  Oh, wait. I need to make copies for the morning meeting on Monday...  ::runs off:: (hear copying sounds in the background) ::returns::  Maybe I'll watch Secret Window tonight--or was it called Secret Garden. Bastards should have just left it with the short story title 'Secret Garden, Secret Window' so my head wouldn't ache so much.  I don't think Ben'd be too pissy at me for watching it... maybe. O.o  I think I can watch it twice. >.>  Yeah, that's a good idea.

      Yay! Time for Stupid Coworkers, starring: Debby, Katy, Karol! (names have been changed to save my ass)   Katy's computer blues:    Specs: Katy is a late 40's ex-lawyer. Colormist is a mid-twenties graphic designer.   Katy pops her head into the marketing office. Looks around for someone to make eye contact. Being the naïve person I am, I look up.  Colormist: Hi!  Katy: Hey, I'm having a problem with that PDF file of the brochure.  Colormist: Uh-huh?  Katy: It's coming in upside down. I can't send it to the guy upside down.  Colormist (who is in no way, shape, or form an IT person): Oh yeah! Sometimes it does that and we don't know why. All you do is at the top of the Acrobat viewer there will be this little icon of a document sideways and a document vertical. Just keep clicking that button until it turns right-side-up. :smiles:  Katy: Oh, okay...  Katy turns to leave and Colormist yells at her: But you have to save it before you send it to him. Don't forget to save!  Katy leaves and returns five minutes later sounding frantic and talking very quickly.  Katy: I pushed save! I saved it multiple times! It isn't working! Can you fix it?  Colormist (again, I remind you that she is NOT an IT person): Aside from doing that, I don't know what else you could do. If you email it to him upside down, he can just print it out and easily turn the paper right-side up. :makes turning motions, pantomiming turning a paper right-side up:  Katy: But I can't email it to him upside down! I can't email him a pdf upside down.  (didn't I just tell her she COULD do that?)  Colormist: Well I don't know how to fix it. Sometimes they just come out like that and I don't see the option on my distiller that's making it come out that way. You'll just have to talk to the IT department and see if they can fix it.  Katy storms out of Colormist's office and runs to her supervisor to tattle on her. Katy's supervisor then contacts Colormist's supervisor with a VERY-VERY nasty email about me not doing my job (again, not in the IT department and I don't know how to fix the problem). Apparently it's too nasty for Colormist to even read and the supervisor just says she handled the situation.  I now have another mortal enemy. Katy's going down and she's going down hard.  ----   Karol & Debby disapprove of crawling.   Specs: Karol has been working for her current employer for 15 years, Debby is her assistant. Karol is second in command of the company and has agreed to allow the marketing department to purchase some organizational materials to make the office more efficient. The first thing on our list is a pair of 3-foot-tall literature organizer (MSRP $300). We actually wanted the 4-foot-tall literature organizers, but they cost $400 each.  Karol and Debby have a discussion about our literature organizers. They want to purchase some tables for us to set the literature organizers on so we don't have to stoop down to get to the bottom cubby holes.  Debby: Karol is concerned that you'll be crawling around to get into the bottom cubby holes of this organizer. Do you want some tables to set them on.  Clark: Oh no! We've talked this over. They're fine on the floor. We won't use the bottom holes.  Debby: No, you don't understand. You'll have to crawl on the floor to get to the bottom cubbies.  Clark: Well we have to get down on the floor now to dig through the boxes we have right now.  Debby: NO! You don't Understand. You'll have to LAY on the FLOOR. You'll be LAYING on the FLOOR to get to the bottom ones. You don't want to LAY on the floor to get to them.  Clark is now looking at Debby like she's crazy. Who the hell has to lay on the floor to get something off the floor?  Clark: Uh... okay. Um, I'll go talk to the department about it.  We end up having a brief discussion about it and agree to get the 4-foot tall literature organizers so that we won't have to use the bottom cubbies. Apparently that satisfies both Debby and Karol.  Hell, if they WANT to spend more money on us then let 'em.  Karol (the lady who first intoned the idea that we'd be laying on the floor) is also the woman who thinks nobody pays for education. Mmmmhmmmmm....

       So I totally psyched myself up to see Alien vs. Predator. I went and downloaded an Extreme Desktop (interactive and very cool) and followed my desktop countdown until it finally came to theatres. Every morning I'd give my coworkers an update on how much time was left.  I was so psyched up that when I saw the poor reviews on rotten tomato (  urlLink  http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/alien_vs_predator/   ), I kinda skirted away from watching it. Ugh, it even has a worse rating than Resident Evil and Final Fantasy, which I enjoyed. Even better than the Punisher, which I hated. But I still had this spectacular buildup inside. I was so obsessed with watching the movie, that when I didn't actually see the blooming thing my brain decided to make it's own version in one of my dreams.  So here it is,     Alien vs. Predator (version Colormist)         Opening scene: For some god awful reason, I'm in a group of people that decide to explore this abandoned pyramid under a glacier. Graphic Designers don't explore pyramids--but maybe there's some background I'm missing. I must have came in and missed the intro. We're checking out this odd room and I know were not supposed to be in there because I've seen the previews. Why is it that I've seen the previews, yet I don't have a weapon of sorts? Does that make any sense.      I walk into this very dark, blackish-blue room that looks very art nouveau. My colleagues are archaeologists, army personnel, and scientists. I must have been called forth to document the structure in art form--that's the only use I have--and I'm very interested in the surrounding walls, floor, and ceiling.  I know it's a trap. Those damn Predators are always using humans for fun. So, trying to warn my colleagues (of course, they pay no attention to me) I walk into the center of the room. It's kinda like a hall that has a ceiling three stories tall. I can tell it's three stories tall because there are two levels of open walkways and doorways (? they look more like large holes) that lead into darkness going up the walls. No sound. Everything is very damp. I'm hoping I don't get dirty or taken hostage by an alien. Somehow I feel the Predators are on my side more than the alien's side.  Something flits beyond my vision. I flip out and try to point it out to my colleagues, but it's already gone. An alien, of course. Bastards are fast and excellent at hiding--in fact, isn't that what the walls are made out of? Aliens--everywhere.  Okay, maybe I'm just freaking myself out.   (time elapse here)   Next thing I know the room is swarming with activity. Predators and aliens all around. My group backs up to the center of the hall--right into the trap I was warning you about earlier. So who's the bigger idiot? Me, who knew about the trap, tried to warn people, but didn't GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE. Or the people who I tried to warn that thought I was psycho?  Yeah, I think this one is all me.  So, in the center of the hall there's a boobytrap. The floor falls out, leads my colleagues and I down a tube and into a chamber below. I jump up--it looks startlingly like the room above, except smaller and more damp. In fact, I think the floor is about a foot of water.  I scurry away and run to the side of the room in an attempt to escape down a hall (now I don't know if this would have been a good idea or not, but I knew the chamber we fell into was NOT a good idea). Fortunately (or unfortunately) a wall slides down, locking me and my spuds into the chamber.   (time elapse here)    Enter the face huggers.   So I'm somebody else now (blonde, short hair, glasses, chick--looks like the sciency type) and I'm all wrapped up in some sort of goo. My former REAL self somehow managed to escape and is yelling at my current sciency self to get the heck out of there. My sciency self begins scrambling to escape the face huggers that are advancing.  Sciency self escapes the wrath of the face huggers and kills remaining huggers a few others also managed to escape, but a lot of them were implanted and we ended their lives (somehow) or maybe they just disappeared... hmm.   (time elapse here)   Turns out that the chamber we were dumped into was a space ship full of Aliens. Woohoo! Lucky us! We're now in space, stuck with a Predator or two (abandoned guys apparently). Aliens are all over, we're trying to wake up the Predator guy and stay out of the reach of the Aliens. I'm back in my old body again, sciency girl is her own self again.  Dumbasses that we are, we elevate the Predator onto a table--which is apparently a bad thing because it gives him super powers. The Aliens curse us for being so stupid (yes, on special occasions Aliens can talk) and the Predator does everything but fly around the room like Neo. He turns black & white (reminds me of Megaman) and has a special invisible forcefield. Eventually, after wiping out nearly all the Aliens on the ship (they reappear at random like those weird shadow monsters on Kingdom Hearts), one Alien manages to knock him back on the ground--thus, removing his special powers.  Now, the Predator didn't DO anything to us humans, so I don't know why the Aliens cursed us for elevating him. We end up 'accidentally' elevating the Predator a few times as the Aliens reappear. It was always an accident because we couldn't really trust the Predator to NOT kill us when he was in B&amp;W mode. However, it always seemed when he was in his B&W mode that the Aliens were the ones doing the saving--as in saving our asses from the B&amp;W Predator.   The city of aliens   Eventually the space ship, which had been hovering earth, lands again in a city (on Earth) and the scattered survivors of the pyramid inspection walk out in disbelief. Apparently the Aliens have completely taken over Earth. The city looks like it's partially abandoned (crumbling buildings, graffiti, dirty, dusty, ratty), but a few stragglers are wandering around. We interrogate the stragglers and learn to NOT visit specific buildings. One of which is right across the road from where our building sized ship has landed.  The building in question is flashy with graffiti. Most of it proclaims nude dancers inside, drinks, food, that the building is safe, open late, come inside, it's lots of fun! The stragglers also tell us to lock ourselves up at night. We take heed and lock ourselves up when dusk falls.  The Predator has left us (only one left now of the few that went on the shuttle with us) and we huddle in our ship. An alien gets inside and we have to off'em. Apparently the sketchy building across the road is a haven of Aliens. They put up the signs outside to lure people inside during the day. At night the Aliens roam freely and collect food &amp; hosts.   Adaptive aliens   We've been back on earth for many years now. All my colleagues have moved and found their own homes--or at least I did. I decide to go back and visit them and discover their door slightly ajar to the shuttle. I walk inside and see the blonde sciency chick freaking out. She's got a gun and is shaking. I walk on down to another little open cubicle-ish room. The guy is gutted and covered in Alien nesting crap. Not cool. It's daylight outside.  Next cube is more disgusting stuff. Disemboweled, dismembered, beheaded. Only a scant few are left alive. I walk back to sciency girl and she's partially in a cocoon. Why didn't I notice this earlier? Apparently the Alien is still in the building. They started hunting during wee morning hours now, hiding in shadows in order to break into buildings.  The Alien appears moments later, there's a brief tussle where I try to escape and then my hero shows up. The Predator kills the Alien (he never talks) and disappears again. I'm relieved and also spazzed. If the Aliens are developing to withstand some sunlight, why couldn't they develop further.   (time elapse here--alarm clock)   Aliens begin developing remarkably fast. They've learned to bond with humans and have begun implanting the remaining humans to turn them into Aliens. They kinda look twisted--like on Alien 4. They swarm the cities during the day and night to gather every last remaining human for their latest development.   (time elapse here--alarm clock, I'll wake up eventually)   Worst part of my whole dream now. The Aliens now resemble humans completely except in their manner of talking. Everything about the humanized Aliens is eerie. I try to mimic them so they don't convert me. I'm socializing with them at a social luncheon. They've completely turned the planet back to mirror middleclass America. It's sick. I've never liked middleclass America to begin with and the fact that everyone is an Alien now is just enough to make me want to spew or hang myself.  It doesn't work. One pretends to accept my facade and draws me in close. He moves to inject me with a serum to turn me into an Alien and is distracted by movement outside the house. Predators again. Hundreds of them. They're shooting all the humanized Aliens...   Alarm clock again. I decide to wake up or I'm going to be late for work.         So I'm thinking, are these psuedo humans really just my view on suburbia? Do I view middle class, better than the johnsons, SUV drivin' soccer moms as an alien species? Is that why I immediately despise all spoiled yuppie people? Am I actually THAT afraid of becoming one of them...

      Ugh. Who knew that purchasing a house took so much money?? $6,000 for a downpayment, $3,000 for closing costs, $500 for building & sewage inspection, $900 for homeowner's insurance, $1,000 for Earnest... And that's not even counting all the utilities, appliances, and furniture we're going to have to purchase. And then all the updates that'll have to happen over the next year... *cries* And my credit cards, car payment, insurance...  ;_;  It wouldn't be so bad if my BuWang was actually employed full-time over the past couple of years, but with the current economic conditions *sigh* It took us three years to find a job after we moved up here. Evil-evil economy.  Ugh.  We can't get a kitty now until we establish ourselves in our home--which I guess isn't a bad thing, but I'm really going to be pining for a kitten. At least I have my fuzzies (aka Ferrets) to cuddle with--so long as they remember to use the litter box.  ::shoots dagger-eyes at Ted::  Yesterday I went through all the boxes stored in my sister-in-law's basement. Or rather, all MY boxes stored in my sister-in-law's basement--I didn't go through her boxes. I threw a buncha crap into the donate pile which needs to go to Goodwill. My husband will be so proud.  Also consolidated my pony boxes into three tupperwares and a few miscellaneous boxes. Need to trek some of the boxes back down to Ohio and stash them in my Mom's basement. Hopefully they'll be okay there if I store them in the top of the closet. >.> *crosses fingers*  While I'm down there (I'm going down this weekend to throw my sister a baby shower n.n) I'll have to load up on stored wedding presents. I'm sure Mom'll be happy to at LEAST get a part of her room back. :ha-ha:

      So, last weekend was pretty much a doozy. I went to look at houses with my husband and sister-in-law. The first house was pretty dreamy. Half-acre, 800sqft upstairs, 600sqft finished basement, beautiful landscaping, 30 minutes from work, and low taxes. The asking price was 124k and we offered 120k. It was just about the cheapest house we could find on the market that was in such wonderful condition and close to work. The sellers accepted our offer!  So, 60 days from now I will officially own a home--providing that the inspection goes well. *crosses fingers*  I had my parents drive up (five hours) to look at it with us. My father agreed that it was nice--just far more expensive than he was used to. So we got the green flag from them!  Still trying to figure out where to keep the ferrets. Hmmmm....  Now I need to repack all my boxes (which is a good thing, cause I'm still missing stuff I was supposed to mail to people) and organize. Thankfully we'll be moved in by October. Just in time for Halloween!! Granted, there probably won't be many kids our way... but I don't mind.  So excited!!!   Edit: Alright, I only actually applied a portion of that title to my blog. >.  So, briefly to relate, my husband now has be addicted to coffe. I literally crave it in the morning. My teeth shall never be the same again. u_u And, well, what's more American than owning your own home, drinking coffee, and watching the Olympics.   Ummm... okay, so maybe lots of countries do that. Shiite. But the matter remains that I'm feeling very regular now. More stable, capable, healthy.   No more Colormist the Nomad. No more changing my damn cell and home phone every five months, and most of all NO MORE BOXES!!!   MWAHAHAAAAHAAA!!!!

      You know, I always tell my husband that he's going to become attached to his bean bag chair if he continues to play Madden '05 like he's been doing. Now, I really didn't think that was true, but apparently you can become attached to furniture if you sit in it too long.  Linkage:  urlLink http://www.shortnews.com/shownews.cfm?id=15558&amp;u_id=3806   So, the moral of the story is, don't sit on your ass for 3-5 years and weigh 600 lbs or you'll actually grow into the fabric of the couch.  This would be adapation at it's finest. :D

      Okay, so I don't really think hell would be boring. Seriously traumatizing, scary as leatherface, and demented--but not all that boring.   I'm stuck at work for the next 30 odd minutes. Not much to do aside from complain about it all. I guess I could start cleaning out my hard drive or my desk--but where's the fun in that?   You're right. I do find that entertaining, don't I? Curse my habitual organization tendencies.   Ah yes, and I could post some pictures of Futurama up around my desk. If I'm going to be here for a couple of years, might as well make my surroundings enjoyable. n.n   Hmmm...  Blasted local theater is closed on Wednesdays. What the heck is up with that? Don't they know I WANT TO WATCH a movie on Wednesday? It's like my mid-week break, man! Not that I could drag Buwang away from his beanbag chair and Madden '05 anyway.   Stupid football.   I, Robot would have been slick too.   :[

      I think I sleepwalk--or at least I relate my surroundings into my dreams all too well. This morning I was having a dream about Hasbro screwing me over on a mailorder purchase from them. The sent me the wrong item and it was already something I had. Needless to say, Hasbro's on my hit-list now for implanting such a tramatic dream (see Futurama, episode #1-2)  Also, for some odd reason my alarm clock always becomes something else in my dreams. Sometimes it's a telephone or an army wake-up call (no, I've never even set foot on a training camp) or a siren... I don't even remember what it was this morning but I do recall that I was thinking how clever it was of them to disguise my alarm clock as that noise.   Don't ask me who 'them' is. 'Them' are always in my half-awake dreams, manipulating my surroundings to fit their needs. Bastards.  One morning a few years ago, my teddy bear (who's not capable of talking as far as I am aware of) told me to answer the alarm clock--er, phone/alarm clock. I picked up the alarm clock and said, "Hello?... Hello?... HELLO?" Slam the phone--er, alarm clock down and mutter, "Fine, don't answer me." My brother walked in my room in time to see me slamming down the alarm clock and hear me mutter something.  So maybe 'them' might be working through my Teddy Bear--that's why he's tucked away in a tupperware right now. Sneaky spying bastard. Don't ever trust a Teddy Bear that tells you to answer your alarm clock.  He's lying.

      Still looking for houses. Found some cheap ones in Clinton, few in Dundee... just have to look-see.   Also went to the used bookstore (Dawn Treader) and Bead Gallery this afternoon. Bought a couple-a Anne McCaffery books and about $20 worth of expensive-ass beads. WHY do beads have to cost so damn much? Hmm???   Fine. Don't answer me.  Anyway, got some mother-of-pearl, Hematite, misc bluish green beads. A few earring heebie-jeebies and some clasps. Still trying to figure out where my money went to. o_O  And yes, purple & green go very well together. Don't let anyone ever tell you otherwise.   Unless of course, you're talking about nasty pale purple and lime green. Then I'd have to disagree with you. But I don't think that's technically possible in the fall anyway.   I was half-expecting it to rain this afternoon while on my 4-mile walk up and back from downtown. I need to get a brain and purchase better shoes. Sandals aren't good for such hikes--neither are cheap shoe-ies.

      I'm back! I know you missed me! Yes?   Of course you did.  Traffic hasn't gotten any better, but I think I found an alternate route that gets me home by 5:50. Not too shabby considering Mapquest says it takes 46 minutes to get from my home to work. I need to move closer.  On that note, Buwang & I are still looking for houses. We fell in love with an adorable one in Milan (I pronounce it like the cookie 'Milano' except without the 'o', but yokels pronounce it 'My-lan'. I think it sounds better like 'Mí-lan'). Stupid retards snatched it out from under our noses. Offered full-price. Bastards. I think it was the owner of the rental next door. Meh. It had only been on the market a whole whopping 5 days.   So now we're considering Milan, Dundee (home of Cabella's monster dead animal store), Clinton, and at the way-way bottom of the list Ypsilanti (Ip-see-lawn-tee). Ypsi can be pretty scary in parts, so we're trying to avoid it. Sad thing is, we only are alotted a max of 175k to buy a house--and that doesn't lead to a lot of choices around here. We're talking 2 bedroom under 1k square feet. :(  I need to get out of my sister-in-law's home before November. October 31st being our cutoff date, and I'd like to get in sooner than that so I could pass out candy. n_n  Anyway, more updates later. I've actually got work to do today.

      --well, actually I AM busy, I'm just not choosing to be busy. n.n   My plan of attack #2 didn't work yesterday because I had to go to the bank. I can't rightly clock myself if I make pit stops. So this morning I went my usual route into work and noticed that the road they SAID was going to be closed on 8/2 wasn't closed.   Big fakers.  In other news, I'm trying to figure out how the heck to add links to my blog. I can't find the page to save myself. Must be some secret hidden button that I'm not finding. Ya know the kind, take up half the page, obnoxious, bright--I never can find the obvious ones.   hmmmm...  Looking at a house in Milan (south of Ann Arbor). Nice neighborhood, about 100K, needs some work on it--but it's ADORABLE.    urlLink Linkage    Three bedroom, only one bathroom though. I think I could handle that so long as it was of a decent size. Looks like it was previously owned by a little old couple. n.n tee-hee!  Okay, I'm beginning to wonder it if is technically possible to drink coffee in a travel mug WITHOUT spilling it all down the front of my work clothes. This is the second mug I've tried and it still spills. Maybe it's because I'm drinking the coffee when it's cold? Expansion of plastics and all that jazz?   AH HA! Found the links. No, it wasn't a large obscurely obnoxious button with large blinking lights and arrows. It was actually nestled into the code. *rolls eyes* I  should  have found it  there ...

      Yeah... that didn't work.  My most recent attempt to escape Ann Arbor didn't work either. If you'll kindly note a comparison between yesterday's plan of attack and todays:     My new route ran into additional construction when I discovered that Textile road was under construction and closed to traffic (or at least I /think/ it was Textile road). The alternate route for traffic took me into even more backups as I turned onto Ellsworth. Then, once I escaped traffic, I ran into a block of unpaved (dirt) road riddled with potholes. Sadly I did not realize how bad the potholes were until I hit the first gigantic one at the end of the paved road. My poor-poor new car. >.  So scratch that idea. I also hit traffic again a few minutes back on the main path. Ugh.   So my new plan of attack #2 is to take the highlighted blue road. (starting destination noted by the purple blob and I'm heading in the direction denoted by the purple arrow). I'm going to ditch my way in line for the first construction area and then I'm thinking that the little red zone that I'll be heading through (which the signs SAY is a closed road) is actually just a 'closed for thru traffic' road. We'll see. I'll probably just end up getting lost in a housing district again. :( Then I'm still going to get stuck in a couple of traffic jams, but at least they're more like 5-minute traffic jams and not the 10-15 minute traffic jams.

      it's good right? Means my body is using up stored carbs and fatty cells? Yes? Please?...  GAWD MY STOMACH IS EATING ITSELF ALIVE!!!!  :glares at offending cookies and rice cakes:   Of course one's loaded with enough sugar to make me puke if I consume another and I'd have to eat the entire bag of the latter mentioned product.   Soup sounds good.  Nice yummy chicken noodle with extra noodles and crackers! Carb-o-licious!   Dammit! I still have another hour yet of torture by paper. These people have NO design skills! Why do they have anything to say in what I produce? Don't they understand they're eating away at my soul??  ... or maybe they do understand ...  Damn soul-eaters.   Gah! My stomach!!

      but it does. I swear MDOT is watching my travelling routes from the street cameras and closing roads at random. Slowly all the roads that I've been using as alternate routes home are either under construction or closed for repairs for a few months. Ugh.   So, just so you have a picture:      The red scribbles are where the road is either closed or under so much construction the traffic backups fairly well qualify it as being closed. The orange scribbles are where the traffic is backed up for at least ten minutes. The green lines are alternate routes I've been trying out in order to get home before 6pm.   The blue line is my most recent plan of attack. I'm crossing my fingers on this one. Apparently there has been construction on the vertical blue line, but it *might* be finished by now. I think I just need to move closer. >.

      At work again.   Not too happy by the sight of piled up work on my desk, so I'm goofing off online instead. Oh wait, it's not called goofing off. It's called, constructive creative development. Getting ideas for my muse... yeah...  So, I'm trying to figure out what this artist's name is so I can add them to my launchcast radio station. Popular in 1998-2000, kinda reminds me of Blink 182 and Bloodhound Gang--but funnier. I could have sworn one of their songs was about being a loser, or stupid, or something... my brain can't seem to develop the lyrics while the Violent Femmes plays in the background.   Hopefully I'll think of it eventually. If you have any guesses, feel free to post them.   EDIT: Ah-HA! The Offspring: Pretty Fly (for a white guy). Don't know why my brain wasn't working. >.>   Nice to see Cherrie is misbehaving at work too n.n
