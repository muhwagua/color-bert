      Today I went to Joe's house and played on PS2, a cool game called SOCOM where its like Counter Strike but and you can go online and you have a headset and it's so realistic. The whole time I just played on Joe's Mom's laptop and relized one of my friends from Great Hollow smokes pot! After Joe's, my mom and I went to get a car wash and we got to go through the washer swiper thingies, it was awesome! I haven't done that in like 7 years. Then we went to La Famiglia to set up a party for my sister's communion.Nothing else happened... just another boring day and then I relized, school makes the day something to talk about. Woah, I didn't just say that!

      Ok, that math mid term was probably the most easy test I've ever took that counts so much. After the test I made a sick video on Windows Movie Maker 2... this took like 2 hours, you can im me if you want it. All day I just lumped around playing gamecube and going on the computer. When Pat, Chris and Jimmy came over we just lumped around laughing and screaming listening to Chris's awesome underground techno music... and U2. Chris said "gay load", it was the funny of the day. Ya... thats all that happened. I think I might go neighborhood terrorizing late tonight!

      Today, I took the Global History Mid term... the multiple choice were retarded but everything else was easy. It's because my teacher never tought us any of the stuff like little Sanchez or King Tecknuttoo... ya know the meaningless shit the this horrible world feeds us teens just so we could get pissed off. Mr. Madeiras teaches us governments and basic, things to help you in life. I saw some African questions on the test, I was like WTF? Paul Stoltz drove me and Erin Sills home which was really funny when Paul said that the Gambacks and that other freak never talked to each other yet they never seperate. Then Mrs. Stoltz said "They Just Go"... I dunno you had to be there. The day sucked, all I did was play Gamecube and go to Pat's and Dan's. Walking home from Dan's, 3 dogs started barking a beat so I stayed there dancing in the road and the lady just stared at me for the longest time until I ran home in zig zags singing in dog language. Now I'm studying for math and then straight to bed!

      Yesterday, January 26th of 2003, was the day of the superbowl. It started off with me going to Dan's house and hurtling a box in his fence opening and me not seeing the hanging rope, jumped into it. Not knowing what happened I got up finding out my whole body had be flung back by a rope and the rope hit my mouth so now I have a cut there that looks like chocolate. Then me and Dan left to Pat's and waited for Eric to come over.then took Pat to "THE SUMP". The sump is an awesome sump with ice and a secret ice rink. Dan brought his camera so we recorded us falling all over the ice and us riding bikes on the ice and falling. Then me and Pat had an idea... a brilliant idea... that was actually retarded. We went into a sump manhole and crawled throughout the pipes of our neighborhood. Well, only about 50 ft. of crawling but it was fun. We were actually underneath the road and all we could hear was Eric screaming and soft pounds. We recorded all of what we did so I'm sure Dan... the film man, will make a video that will prove to you all we actually did it. He makes these movies and puts them online! He also made the jackbutt movies I'm sure you all know what they are. When me and Pat crawled out of the pipe and ran yelling at and recording Andrew English, an asshole 6th grader who beat up a kid with a heart thingy, was playing hockey with a kid who we all thought was Keith Buckheit. After that we went back to Pat's and after 10 minutes I finally discovered there was a walkie talkie under my ass (my walkie talkie) and it was rumbling from the voices. We listened to these two guys talk about Jerry M and a ROLADEX and a EXTERMINATOR? We must of jotted down like 10 phone numbers they told each other over the radio. Then Eric finally relized he jotted down the phone numbers on Lindsay, Pat's sister's phone list. He goes "oops" and shows us the paper which was by far the funniest thing of all day. Then the day was ending and I had to leave them to go to my cousin's where I was playing gamecube nonstop with Chris, my 10 year old cousin. We started playing Star Wars: Clone Wars and the YUB YUB music came on. Now I've loved this song since I was... what... 6? So I haven't heard it in so long, I was so excited and me and him started dancing to the song like crazy. Sure enough everyone in my family was watching us cracking up. I also beat Mario Party 4 for Chris which was incredibly easy, Bowser is an asshole! We also played Super Mario Sunshine where we heard Bowser's voice... pretty cool. Thanks to Chris I downloaded that song and listen to it more than any song I've ever listened to. The football game was great because one side of my family was rooted for the Raiders and the other including me for the bucs! Oh god that was the most exciting game ever.

      Ok today was just plain awesome. On the bus Pat threw like 3 quarters and dimes at me so I chucked them full speed back and it ricochets off of the windows and awesome hit Kayla K and Laura C in the head. I would of gotten a double head shot! SCORE 2-0! Ok, so I get off the bus and drop my backpack and slide across the snow because its all hard and solid. For like 20 minutes I was doing it and people passing by must of thought I had some crazy disease. They see a small boy with a huge fluffy black jacket jumping on his stomach like a penguin and SLIDING AWAY! Then, I finished my homework quickly and basically played drums the rest of the day. After dinner, I went online to find out there's these clubs... Black Hawk Down and White Hawk Up? So I'm all confused and all these different people are like BE BLACK, BE WHITE, BE PINK, BE MACARONI ORANGE! And I'm like shizzle that, I'm making my own group with Keith Barbara Buckheit. Ok, that group just didn't work out so... screw these things. If I wanted I can corrupt the whole school and brainwash you all to bow down to me and the flying squirrels. Ya that's right Tommy Goo is your dictator. So... what's this group stuff for anyways? Popularity? Women? Food? Whatever it is, I know I'm out for good because once you get involved, it's like drinking Snapple's Kiwi Strawberry, one sip... nah you gotta have the whole thing! And I ain't taking responsibility for the fall of the Macaroni Orange Hawk Downs!

      School was weird. I saw my dad in school, it was freaky. I don't know what else made my school day so weird but it was. When I got home all I did was damn homework and practice drums. My legs hurt, I think I'm going to bed around 9 just to catch up on Ms. Giambrone's Health Class. Wink!

      Yesterday, I went to Genna's with Amanda and Matt. We watched The Exorcist. I gotta tell you, that movie was the shiz yo. All those special affects made it an awesome movie. It was really funny also. Like when she stabs her ****** and shoves her mom into the bloody you know what. Also, when the girl throws up all over the priest and the best part was when she made her head spin all the way around. Genna and Amanda were freaking out, Matt and I were laughing. The only freaky part is when she rises from the bed with her blue eyes when the priests keep yelling "THE POWER OF CHRIST COMPELLS YOU!"... you should of seen the young priest. They must of said that over 20 times, I saw the young priests face. He was completly sick of chanting out meaningless crap. Oh well, it was fun. After Genna's, Matt and I went to my cousin's for his birthday party. We played a few games and stuff. Well, the next thing I knew I watching Howard Stern and waking up to the sound of Tom (Matt's Brother) yelling out "DAM DAM DAM" to the Super Smash Brothers game. Thomas was Kirby and he defeated me, how miserable. Ya you like it Justin, Kirby's puffed up cheeks. Yes, good old times. Later on we went on the computer and saw this scary thing where you watch all these optical illusions and in the last one, it kind of looks like the shape of a head and out of no where comes a demon YELLING! Haha it was funny yet spooky. When I came home... I relized, the vacation is over. No more home. Homework and school. Misery. Ah wtf we have 1 more day! Let's all make the best of it!

      I haven't wrote in a while so here I go now. Yesterday I went to Amanda's with Paul. We had a snowball fight and ate some awesome dinner. I found secret pictures of Maria and Amanda. Tee hee. I watched Amanda own Paul in NBA Street. We also watched MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING... it was... strange. Greeks use Windex on everything. Ok, so after Amanda's we went to my cousin's house who lives right near her and it's funny my cousins go to Sachem. We watched my cousin play Final Fantasy and he fought a huge hairy guy. It was the good guy's dad. During the movie the little Japanese guy with blond hair goes... "Dad". Dad - "Ya?" Chinese Guy - "I hate you." I don't know it sounded funny coming out of the Japanese guy's mouth. Seriously, go watch DragonBall Z, those Japanese cartoons are hilarious. Today I played in the snow with Jimmy and Pat. We tunnels in the snow and when a car would come by we'd dive backwards into the snow like scuba people. The best part was when Pat and I were like IMAGINE IF YOU WERE IN THE TUNNEL AND OUT OF NO WHERE CAME A FOOT! So... Jimmy made a ridiculously big tunnel and Pat was in the tunnel and sure enough my foot went right into the tunnel. HOW WEIRD. Ok, these things aren't funny to you but if you were there, man you'd die from laughter. Well... no band practice yet! How sad, I wonder what's going on tomorrow?

      Today I went to the dentist... really annoying. After that I went to Pat's and saw his awesome chicken that screams. We drowned it in his sink and made him gargle, hilarious! Pat pretending to be all like... "TELL US WHERE HE IS, OK YOU WONT TELL, YOUR GONNA PAY!". We all went to my house... when I mean WE I mean THE GANG. Duh Duh DUUUHHH! We had a huge gang fight in my room and recorded it. I forgot to tell you all yesterday I got so excited I punched my desk and the draw flew off... and in health, James Buchmann wore make up and I captured it on A CAMERA! Ok... back to today, I went to the movies with Amanda, Toni, Amanda's friend Genna, Paul, Matt, Andrew C and JJ... oh ya Amanda's sister also. Cool Night. I Love You Amanda!

      Today in Science, once again, I almost literally died from laughing so hard. Joe M doesn't stop making Cristina M manly orgasms. Everytime he does it, my whole face turns red and tears fly out of my eyeballs! STOP JOE! Elisa - Um... excuse me, wolfman? lol We saw a jazz show today, pretty cool. Rob's buddy icon is scary... it's a picture of him all evil and tough and Mr. Cool Big Monster. I forgot to mention the other day in lunch, this kid Mark walked around the whole cafeteria without knowing where he was going. He even asked the Etheopian custodian for directions! I miss Charlie, he isn't in our lunch period anymore. Maybe he got fired for promoting us to throw out the red plastic lunch trays. In SS, we spent the whole class talking about Mr. Madeiras' wife. On the bus ride home, I said bye to the bitch Amanda H who should seriously burn in hell for being unhappy and evil. There's two kinds of people that suck, the people that are always sad and evil AND the people that are NONSTOP happy even if you burn their house down... their still happy... stupid Canadians. Who the hell's Canadian in this country anyways? So anways, I said bye to Amanda and this guy behind her gave me a light brush on the neck and said "Don't fucking say anything!" I think he was gay... he kind of gave me a gay stroke. )= I think he thought... woah I sound like the fat dude from Mickey's Christmas Carol, I think he thought I was Chris B, the kid who hugged her and got yelled at by her. Our new bus driver is cool... at first I thought he was really old smoking women but then I heard his low voice so I relized it was Ms. Thiele! I think he was a hippy. I got home, didn't get what I wanted. So... I just did nothing the rest of the night. Well... I talked to Amanda G's sister... is that considered doing something? Oh ya, I played Nintendo non-stop.

      I got lots of hugs on the bus today, and embarassed Chantel by screaming out "It's Chantel's Birthday!" The whole bus sang her a birthday song! I don't think she likes me... than again she said she wasn't social and always rejects people when they go for the high five or a hug. I got a few high fives but never any hugs. Then there's this girl named Amanda in 10th grade who got hugged by Chris Barone on the way off the bus. She flipped out right in front of the bus driver saying "You freakin asshole, don't fucking do that again!" and it occured to me... who the hell uses freakin and fucking in the same sentence? I slapped Paul alot today, I don't know why. I got my report card, 3.64... yeeeaaa bitch. Only thing is I got an incomplete in Band because Santa Keyes forgot to put my damn grade in the book! He looks like Santa yet he's Jewish? WTF? Hope there's no school tomorrow! GENERALS IS OUT TOMORROW!!!

      Next day I went Matt's house and played Gamecube until it was time to go to the movies. We went with Angelica and Gina to see Darkness Falls. They're in 8th... anyways we begged Keith and Steve to come and they said they wouldn't but ended up coming with us. Angelica kept making excuses that she was scared... ya know. I took a piece of food and threw it at this little 7th grade girl who wouldn't stop screaming. I threw it behind me, then I hear AHHH! MY EYE! I think her name was Gabby from Dawnwood, says Angelica. After the movies we went to Friendly's but they were too crowded and had to wait about an hour to get a seat so we went to Mcdonald's. I ate alot... fries were thrown... ya. I went back to Matt's and Keith and Steve had to go home. We watched Born Identity which is pretty good, ok how does Matt Damon survive in the water so long? Maybe he's a robot. Matt's brother, Tom had his friend sleep over also. We watched skating videos and played Metroid and 007 Nightfire. We also snowboarded outside and went into war with each other. Bryan kept acting like JFK... pretty funny. Ok these journal things are pointless!

      Today was AWESOME! Snow Day and I went to Keith's along with Steve A, and Tom and Matt K. First we tried to build an igloo but we gave up. We played HALO, pretty sick game, with the trucks. After that we went up to the High School and played football... for like 2 seconds. It got too cold so we went back inside, then went out into the neighborhood and shoveled 2 driveways and each of us got $20 each. When I took my glove off, my thumb was all black and I was going crazy thinking I had frost bite. Ended up being the snow seaping the leather black color through the glove and into my skin. When I got home I had to babysit my younger sister Alison. The whole thing was pretty annoying... I'm not gonna' mention why but I have to thank a couple of people for bringing me out of what happened. You know who you are. Ok, I'm STARVING! good night... ANGELICA WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU!!!!

      The other day I was at my locker and I heard BLA BLA BLA DAH DAH DAH and I turn around to see some 80's dude with long dirty hair pretending to play the guitar while going BLA BLA BLA DAH DAH DAH! It was funny. Today nothing good happened except for when Joe M in science while Paul Joe and I were taking the test, Joe goes EUUUUUUUH... _fart_! Definetly the most funniest thing that ever happened in school... well Mr. Rippert's UHHG KABOOM! was pretty good but this was great. I was laughing so hard I was crying like crazy. We were taking the test in the central science lab. Oh ya in English our sub was Mr. Baumgarden and we spent the period throwing books everywhere. Great Day Of School.

      Today was a rough day of school and a long night of homework. To piss me off, my dad thought I was smoking pot and bought a drug test for me... I took it and proved him wrong! HA! I think he's in the CIA. He thought I smelt like smoke but it was probably from an asshole in my math class who smokes all the time. He sits next to me. After the drug test my dad recieved his new computer and isn't using it yet so he gave me the monitor to use for a little while. Right now it's 7 and I'm still doing dam homework all the way from when I got home. Oh ya and half my bus never found my bus today and we saw our bus number and went in. I was the first one on and the bus driver said "Swim team?" and I said "Yes!" thinking he was joking. Finally some guy in a tight swim suit came on saying this is the swim team bus... it was so confusing but our bus finally came with some asshole who all we understood from his mouth was... WA WAAA WAAA WAAA WAAWA. I don't think he's from around hea yo. Jesus today's log just went completly backwards! Back to 7 PM, I'm working on an essay for SS and not having any time of the night to enjoy watching TV or something.

      "I know you're out there, I can feel you know. I know that you're afraid, you're afraid of us, you're afraid of change. I don't know the future. I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how it's going to begin. I'm going to hang up this phone, and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see. I'm going to show them a world... without you. A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries. A world where anything is possible. Where we go from there, is a choice I leave to you."  Today, school was fine but I found out some disturbing information from my cousin which was spread around about me, it wasn't true. I can't say what it was. Track was hard. Tomorrow morning I have the meet so I have to eat alot of pasta tonight. I'm playing basketball with Matt and Paul and then going to the talent show with Matt, Mike and James... our band. Our band definetly owns.

      Sick today, still went to school and track though. There's a huge ache in my leg but I still manage to crush Paul. After school I had like no homework so I did a good favor for Dave and made him his dirtbike movie with music and everything, its' great. Ask me for it. The ending is hilarious. http://www.theviralfactory.com/gallery.htm Click there for funny videos... of course their fake. Basically that's all I did, was make the movie and play Zelda... then I went to sleep. Good Night.

      On the bus, we had a chance to experience jumping out of the back of the bus for some safety drill. I felt all cool like I was in the marines or something. Just a normal day, I don't know why but I payed good attention in school today. In track, I had to run 2 miles from SHS to Jeroke and back and after that I had to run 5 800's (2.5 miles). It was a long practice until 5:10. I took the bus home with Pat and Paul and other people and Paul was upset because there was no ice cream in my ice to make milk shakes. The poor child was looking foward to it all day. "Tom make sure the ice cream is kosher." Damnit, how do you spell that word? I got the new Zelda game, it's pretty cool, who cares if it's cartoon, the game is good. Link is funny looking. Most of you haven't a clue what I'm talking about... but that's ok, you're only missing out on the best games ever... besides for first person shooters. I had no homework, it was awesome. Now I gotta put a bunch of songs onto my MD (portable mp3) so I can listen to Linkin Park's new songs on the bus tomorrow. By the way, Linkin Park's new cd, Meteora was released in stores today. Ok, goodnight.

      This morning on the bus, we listened to the Ronkonkoma High School's radio so it was such random music. First it started with like Luis Armstrong or like Frank Sinatra singing all melon collie and it started to fade into some fast loud punk song. Then there was two hot sounding girls on the radio talking about Hakuna Matata and when it came on, Paul and I were singing to it.Today was nothing but good stuff... I think. Well, not really, math was shitful like usual. Ms. Boccio is definetly the biggest asshole on this planet. So anyways, track was good because I pushed myself. When I got home from track with Paul, I went to the orthodontist to get more braces put on and replaced on the bottom. Then I went to get a haircut, now I look like a marine... it's pretty cool, but the peak is still there for all you ladies, don't worry! I went to get Zelda for Gamecube but I found out it comes out tomorrow, but that didn't put me down. When I got home, I downloaded like every song I know for some odd reason. Lately, I've been listening to so much music from 92.3 K Rock, the best radio station. Music makes me very happy. After finishing my homework at Paul's and checking out his Sports Illustrated Magazine (*SWIMSUIT EDITION*), I went home... typed this and now I'm going to play the drums... ouch these freakin braces hurt!

This world is full of fucked up people killing one another. We should be all washed away. You think we're peaceful? That's why we bombed their asses. Damn bombs dropping like raindrops onto their heads burning their children in front of their very own eyes. Death surrounding them and for what, for one man who didn't listen to the bully of the world, The US. I mean come on what the fuck, he's been threatening us since the gulf, the guy's all talk. This world is a shithole, you are a slave of them. Listen to me, we can escape this. We can all live in a world, with no rules, no boundaries or borders, a world without them. A world with peace. A world with true life. A world without fear. A world where anything is possible.  Sorry about that, it's my religion. I don't know where I am. Am I in the real... or am I dreaming? If I'm dreaming, I just want to wake up, if I'm real, I want to stop the Rennaisance... I cannot. Unless I have followers to this religion. There will come a time... trust me. I will be the reason we will be saved from them, and if we are dreaming, I can only posess ourselves into believing we're slaves. That's all for I am not the chosen one.  I'm really expressed my deep thoughts. Ok, today I had the gay track invitational in Amityville but I kept going to 711, I bought a alot of food and kept stealing slurpees. After track I went to Angelica's with Steve A and we basically just jumped around the trampoline the whole time... fun! Yea, the day sucked... the night was awesome. Tomorrow I'm having non stop fun with the neighbors.

      Kaiser slept over. Matt, Mike and I all had our very first band practice. We never came up with a band name though. We played alot and had fun, we made up a song and tried to play Toxicity and Everlong. We were all alone with know adults and we heard footsteps from upstairs, I had a work out bar, Matt had a 2x4 wooden plank and Mike had a huge broom. We searched the house... no bad guy. After they left, I got excited for the storm... IT NEVER FUCKIN CAME!!! What, two lightening bolts? Big deal, I wanted alot of storm... A BIG STORM! Well, I have no clue what I'm doing tonight... maybe going to the bball game at SMS, or just sitting home like a little good boy I am. No... now I edited it. I definetly didn't go to the gay basketball game that Bono wanted me to go to just to watch him beat Paul's team. Pat came over, then we went to Pat's house and attacked all these 6th graders. It was Pat's little sister's bday and she had all the "MONKEYS" over so we played football with them. This one time I had the ball... I think 20 little girls molested me.  Pat jumped on me almost stopping my lungs from working.The girls were fuckin slapping me and kicking me, this one girl grabbed... well forget that. Another time the same thing happened to Pat, and I was in the brawl laughing in his face. It was mucho fun. Pat came back to my house again and the next thing I knew I was dead on the couch 2 in the morning with Apollo 13 on. TRACK INVITATIONAL TOMORROW IT SUCKS!!!!!

      Woah. Today Paul and I ran the 5K (around 3.5 miles) run in Smithtown along with around 400 other competitors. I came in 46th beating Paul by 1 second. I completely sprinted at the end to the goal where a million people were roaring loud. It was the coolest feeling. But think, 46th overall of every age group from 1 - 100 years old. I came in 46th out of 400 people! There was the kid 1 mile fun run and the really big guy from our track team did it. He got up on stage with all the other little kids. Unfortunetly he never won anything.)= After the race I had a tooth pulled and a couple of teeth sealed by the Navy Seals. Ok, after this, must of been the most boring day of my life. Well... not really I went to the parade. Saw Mattia and Buchmann skating on the train tracks in St. James, screamed out their names but they didn't hear me because of the loud trucks. You guys are fuckin awesome. I was with my cousin Kate. We went to drop her off at her house when we found out Britt had been home alone with her 3 boyfriends!!! They're all ghetto fags. We saw one standing in the middle of the road when a car came by beeping, when the short little punk screams out fuck you to the car. I've talked to this gay kid on the phone before at my cousin's house just to make sure he's cool and shit, he's got the highest voice. He's from GH, I don't like the 8th graders at all. You little shits better watch out lol. You see just like yesterday, there's all these little gay punks who think they can take on anyone, even authority. So back to the rest of the day. Yea, thanks to Pat being Mr. Poop and being gone all day and thanks to Dan staying at J Lo's house all day, I did didley sqwat... well I slept all day. I woke up at night, ate french fries and apple sauce and decided to boggle Amanda G's mind by explaining THE MATRIX to her and how I believe it's true. That was fun. It's official, Amanda and I are running away together... we just don't no where yet. Hey Kate G, whats up with the away message, I know you look up to me and all but your away message, it was like if I typed it or something. Maybe we have the same minds. Wow.

      Today was sick. In science I got a quarter down Elisa's shirt and kept it! haha. I'm putting it on a plaque and mounting it somewhere in my room! I also got my seat permanently changed to the front because I made the whole class crack up when I randomly decided to turn my face purple by holding my breath. At lunch, Nick R got escorted to the office by like 20 security guys. I'm not gonna mention any thing that specifically happened. Other great shit happened today, I just can't remember... ah cant be that great if I can't remember it. I have a 5k race tomorrow with Paul. I ate a shit load of spaghetti. I was at the Sp's rink and I was skating the wrong way so a 9 year old just came up out of no where and duffed me right in the jaw. You know what. It felt good. It felt good knowing I resisted to assault, I held in my anger, then again I knew if I had touched the kid, he probably would of needed to be rushed to the hospital. And I would of been sewed. Seriously, he was a little over 4 feet and his punch was like a flower landing on your face or something. I laughed in his face though so he must of felt like an asshole. Later on I went up to his friends and I said "That was brave of you to give me a punch" and all the other kids were like "we have nothing to do with this, dont hurt us, he shouldnt of punched you, he's got a disease"... they were like old Mafia men shitting their pants. So I just told them why don't you guys teach your retarded friend a lesson and I left, see no trouble. Wow, I handled that pretty well... I like little kids, I would never be able to hurt that kid, he was so small and weak. Well he still is a big punk/faggit/orangatang. Ok cya later. Buchmann the night was good. Oh yea, I convinced over half the people at the rink I had turrets, terrets, tirrets, George Foreman? How ever you spell it.

      Afraid the society will judge you? Think about it.  Everyone, everybody goes by the society around them and doesn't allow themselves to act and appear in certain ways because of the people around them. My advice to you. We're in a society that demands profection of race, sexuality (ok that should be straight), religion, weight, height, dress, and more. Think what you want, dress what you want, do what you want.   Woah, have I been listening to Mr. Shelley? Well, it's true. I put on a head band to prevent myself from sweating when I run. Everyone says "Stop It Grimaldi Your White!". I just don't get it. I wear something to protect my face from sweat and people take it into a racial matter. Let me tell you something. Black people didn't invent clothes. They invent what we invent. We are them. They are us. We are one nation. Other stuff happens too.  Ok, shut up. Well today in track, we ran all the way to Jeroke and back. Fun for 4 miles! That's about it... yea. Angelica you better not make plans for Saturday.

      Damnit I lost my SHS ID Card! Ah what the hell. Ok, today was weird. Oh, I didn't get in trouble from the bus driver. After school I went to Sports Plus to skate with Buchmann, Schreck, Buchmann's friend, Alan A, Eric... and Anthony T. So Buchmann almost got hooked up with this girl Stephanie from Centereach. She did a cool belly thing. Woah. This is boring. They ended up DOING NOTHING. Well... either did I. I hung out with Britt H but thats it. All these 8th graders were there from GH. I finally met Abby P after a year of talking online to her and making fun of her. She calls me an asshole because I did but why does it matter, I never even met the girl. I don't know bout you Justin but I talk to people online that I KNOW... cough indiana cough. It's cool now though, because I met them and now I don't make fun of them. ITS HOW I AM! Early bedtime for early meeting for track tomorrow morning. G nite

Guess fucking what! IT ALMOST HIT THE BUS DRIVER! I hope he doesn't report me or something... Well wtf my life sucks... I'm in the LIFE SUCKS club in Jared's profile. Check it out!

      For all that are against the war and the education effort. You like to have good books? If so, would you like terrorists to hold our school hostage and snipe each student that walks by? Our money is going towards protection from terrorism and to me, that is way more important than having Grade A textbooks and Chess Clubs. Ok, so you have good stuff in school. Next minute your skeleton dust is imprinted on the wall by a 500 megaton A-Bomb. Our money goes to The FBI, CIA, SWAT, NYPD, MARINES, ARMY, NAVY, AIRFORCE, UN and alot more so we can keep this country free from terrorists and threatening dictators such as Saddam Hussein. Before you blame our government, blame the horrible criminals who force us to spend money on United States Defense.  My dad told me this. At first I didn't want the war and didn't want our school losing special programs such as after school sports and other events for fun. I wanted a good quality school. Unfortunetly, we can't afford these things. It's not the state's fault nor the White House's. Don't blame Bush. Blame those assholes for brainwashing their people into thinking of the Islamic religion as a self righteous suicide such as in 911. Saddam is corrupting regular people like you and me and turning them into terrorists who think they will get a great life after they die on Earth. That's not what the Islamic religion is. The Islamic religion is peaceful and it's made for people who think of great reincarnation only for good people who achieve greatness in life. Not for people who commit suicide and killing others. Don't hate certain races because I guarantee if Saddam was in charge of this country, we'd be brainwashed also. Terrorists are in every country. It's a shame we can't somehow kill them all. There will always be terrorists because this world is sick and they will always have their little groups but never again will America allow these groups to take action. That's why we need to spend our money on protection. Saying you want money spent on books, is as good as saying you being attacked by terrorists.  My dad can teach me pretty cool things. Ya... he was a cop, now he's a LIMO driver. Pretty cool, he gets payed a shit load of tips. Ok, track is awesome again. Kaiser and I ran with the track team around the school outside about 5 times in 30 minutes. I love running, and I love singing James Brown just to make people lose their breath when they laugh. Today was normal. I'm now going out with Angelica, no not in our grade. And... the protest took place today. Ya... pretty much what my whole SPEACH is on. OK BYE

      I have a great feeling tomorrow is going to be a crazy day. We have some gay protest where... well I think you all know what it's about. This country is fucked up. Today, another boring day. Just like every other school day, I can't fuckin do my homework. I think my brain is decreasing in size. Shut up Paul. Track was pretty fun. I saw Dan and Pat doing silly walks in Badminton. That's a cool sport, I should of tried it. Well, today in track I ran with Matt K the whole time and we were doing pretty good... RIGHT MATT! We had to run inside the border of the high school around 15 times. It was funny listening to Matt's silly breathing and my SECRET EATING! Oh ya, as you all know my ex girlfriend is now going out with someone she doesn't like at all. It's very strange. I don't think people want me telling other people these things but what the hell! I just have to say Maria, you are a brave one to stand up against war tomorrow even when getting put down as a cut. God speed. You made a great decision. I would make that decision but I'm retarded and could care less on how our money is spent. I'm gaining back my talent at drums for anyone who wants me for a band. I play drumset even though I have a band, we just never started. Ok, GanGstA GoO iS OuT, PaYcE

      Woah, Mr. Goo forgot to write in his Bloggy Journal! Uhhh... I got braces Friday morning and got to miss most of school. After everyone got home from school, I played with Pat, Eric and Jim and then went to Keith's. We threw snowballs at Mike Chen's house and Donyall aka MR. HOLEEM. Shit, that Islam food kicks ass! We went to Sports Plus and played Lasertron. I was on a team with a bunch of awesome little pack of black boys that kept holding the gun to my head sideways (G STYLE). One little kid's eyes were glowing. Forget that, Jess M's teeth were glowing! So... we lost but we tried. It was me, Mike W, Jess M and the little boys vs Crystal F, Keith B, Michelle F and John D with some tall guy who knew what he was doing so obviously that's why we lost. So, we told the little kids to get the boy with the red shirt ( John D)  Sure enough, the little boys beat the crap out of John and John got penalized! I also smashed into Jess on a corner. After Lasertron we went skating. Ok, I haven't skated since I got 50 stitches in my chin in 6th grade. First I fell back on my head and flew foward landing on my chin. They had to close the rink because of the blood... sorry too much detail. So, I faced my worst fear and started running out there, not skating, running and every time Crystal would push me I'd freak out like a little girl. I saw Justin S there so I was all good. wERd. He helped me tie my shoes and Justin and I met up with two girls, Krystal and Dorothy (cousins) who knew Justin. Those girls must of thought I was crazy flopping around on the ice but it was funny because I'd go up to random girls and start dancing with them. I got two of the Sports Plus girls on the ice to fall on the ground laughing because I passed them rubbing my chest and stuff... ya know. Today I went to my cousin's for my cousin's 11th birthday and that's it. Came home. Bye.

Came home, did nothing, played Zelda... didn't played drums, had an huge IMAGINATION conversation with Pat about how Erics attacked us all and I took the rest into my own fantasy world of imagination. Mad Pat's night of sillyness. Nothing else happened... just confused on what's happening Friday. Boing. Good Night Fred.

      Spoon boy: Do not try and bend the spoon. That's impossible. Instead... only try to realize the truth.  Neo: What truth?  Spoon boy: There is no spoon.  Neo: There is no spoon?  Spoon boy: Then you'll see, that it is not the spoon that bends, it is only yourself.    www.ebaumsworld.com... I have come to the conclusion of all the illusions that we see online and mathmatical equations that lead to your number you had picked and have figured them all out. Everyone of them, it's made by professionals, nothing is bending but your mind, and your mind allows yourself to believe in it all. But it is not what you think.   So... today in track I ran 10 laps or so, maybe more, maybe 11, in the rain in 15 minutes... not bad. Then I came home and played drums for about an hour and a half. I'm awesome. Then I watched Pamela Anderson on Scooby Doo, then went upstairs on this computer, told everyone 50 Cent had his head blown off by the raging Christina Aguilara and her 9mm, then my sister who's 7 directed me to www.ebaumsworld.com This all is sick shit you gotta check it out, then I went to bed.

      Mommy's birthday, I had an easy track practice without Holtzman and after track me and Paul had a traditional sleeping bag fight. As you previously read with me and Chris, it has been our fighting game since WAY BACK IN THE DAY and now for the first time, Paul and I fought. We started off by closing our eyes and spinning a million times around, then someone called Fight! Of course I wasn't trying the whole time or else I would of gone crazy ass raged on Paul. I went easy... except for the end where my dad broke it up because we were creating an earthquake. We both took some good falls and at one point in the match, I actually thought Paul was the chair so i jumped on it and Paul being all stealth and silent, didn't say a word so I figured... WHEREVER PAUL IS HE DEFINETLY ISN'T UNDER ME! Paul threw me off the bed, I threw him into the bed corner and the Goo's Money Jug... I'm poor... it's got a few quarters, dimes and nickels... AND PENNIES! Ok so nobody won the competition because my Dad came in and broke it up but if there was an end, Thomas Joseph Cornelius Grimaldi would have defeated old Paul Lucipher Ludwig Mozzletoff Stoltz. Then we decided it would be great if there was a few girls in this game, that way we wouldn't have to worry about the awkward positions... and maybe bring along a few of our friends that we are superior of... I won't mention any names. We need weaker people to show off of course and make us look good. Ok, so after that, my family and I, Tiara (sister's friend) and Grandma all went to Milano Grill on Jeriko Turnpike. It was good, we had a great amount of laughs and I ate some hELLa good cheese cake. Then I came home, danced on my bed and went to bed. HAPPY BUFFDAY MOMMY!!!

      Woooo hooo! Saturday - Went to the movies with Keith and Steve, Bulletproof Monk... ok movie. Sunday - Alison's ( my sister ) communion. At church, the priest was talking about all we need is faith and then some asshole came up talking about how the church needs money. Yea, Catholicism sucks. That's why I'm converting to Judiusm. But I'm still celebrating the Catholic holidays, like Christmas and Easter... basically taking advantage of them both. That's the only thing I thank Jesus for, for being born and for dying which both made these two wonderful holidays. After church, we went to La Famiglia where we yelled at the waiters. A magician guy came who cut me in half with a real saw! My blood was all over the floor, it was awesome. Then he lit the blanket on fire that was above me and I started cracking up. I gave the guy the finger as he left. Fucking asshole tried to trick me with his tricks, I knew it all along, the bunnies and piggens were in his pockets and sleeves. Then everyone came back to my house. We played outside and Chris pissed on random places in my yard. Then I played basketball, Me and Paul vs Dan (my cousin) and Ricky... we never got to finish the game but I'm guessing me and Paul would of won after the major come back we had at the end. Sad thing is we never ended up getting Chinese food. Everyone left, I played drums, then Zelda, then bed.

      Yesterday, Ashley is no more my girlfriend. It lasted one day. If you want details on what happened im me, "Everyone's doing it", lol MAtt! Having fun in Florida, oh yea you too Jared! Last night Chris Michaelis slept over. This morning Chris told me that last night he was talking to Renegade something (Dave D) and he asked me what he should say to him and me being half asleep, half awake, actually it was more like 3/4 sleeping... anyways I told him "In a million years from now, you'll be in good hands, cheddar cheese." So Chris decided to put the away message as 'Nacho Cheese....' and of course everyone was all like WHAT?! In the morning Chris and I had a huge sleeping bag war and I won! I got him pinned like 20 times. The game is you go in a sleeping bag headfirst so you can't see anything. Then you attack one another, yea it was dangerous, I fell down the steps. Right, so I had a track invitational at home from 3 pm to 9:30 pm, INSANE but luckily it was home. I came home, helped my mom walk the neighbors dog (Pepper) just in the backyard for like 2 seconds and then back in, went online, laughed, jumped on my bed, and did a dance. Oh yea, I also found out who Domokun is from some people, this brown awesome dude.

I went to Keith's today and watched The Ring and then Steve's mom brought me home, and brought Keith and Steve to the little league baseball game to ump but it was cancelled (good news). So Keith and I met Ashley and Val at Dave and Buster's and we hung out and shit. Ashley I Love You! I came home, watched the end of Mothman Prophecies and went to bed. Ok, so that's all folks, stay tuned for another BLOG tomorrow!

      Today was great. First I went out with my dad, Alison and her friend, Tiara. We went all the way to Lindenhurst again to get Alison's new lamp at the Bedroom Source which is where I recently bought my room's new furniture (the first day of vacation). Again, we passed our old house which is beautiful compared to most of the other houses. It was like driving through memory lane, so many memories, everything I recognized. We went to All American Burgers and Franks in Massepequa. This has been my dad's and my favorite burger place. It took us 30 minutes to get the food because it's so crowded. After the food, I went to GameStop and bought the Zelda:Wind Waker Player's Guide. I beat the game but now I need to get all the extra shit. After that all, I went to Sports Plus with Keith and Steve hoping I'd see The Used. I also had some left over tokens from the last time I went with Dave (gangster encounter) so I decided, might as well use them. Some 10 year olds liked me and they were following me around, it was freaky. We met 3 cool girls, Ashley, Valerie (Beth!), and Sammy. I managed to see The Used from the back entrance. They were awesome, they were going all out crazy. I gotta go to one of those concerts one day so I can unleash some craziness (the real Tom). Ok, so after everything, I came home, drank a huge can of Arizona, fought with a wanksta from GH and scared him shitless, wrote my blog, played Zelda and went sleepy.

      Today was good... ya know because of easter and all. I got a three stooges dvd, pretty cool. I went to my cousin's house all night, saw Jackass the movie, that movie is hilarious. Kate, Britt, Dan, Chris and I were playing with the spongebob blow up kickball in the road and Britt kicks it up from the across the street neighbor's house and BOOM! It hits the top of an old man and women's 1980's maroon shit mobile. The man gets out blabberin and cussin and we're cracking up. I told the man it was a racoon and Kate said it was a bird but he didn't fall for it so I said it was a run by fruiting by an unknown man who seemed to have escaped the crime scene by jumping the fence of the neighbor's yard. He started to approach me and that's when I started to freak out. Imagine this, an old Mafia man approaching you with a cane. Yes, it was horrifying and gross. But... luckily he turned around, checked for any dents and right before he entered the car he said, "Was that a stone?" Ok, you had to hear how he said it. So they drove away and the parents of course think its me. YES, IT WASN'T ME FOR ONCE! We also  went to the park near my cousin's house and my sister started histerically crying just because she was bored, it was the weirdest thing ever. Then we avoided Kate and her dum gangster friends who all smoke. So basically everything the whole day was great until track fucking came up. My fuckin mom had to fuckin mention that I had track 7 in the morning just to get me started. Just to fuckin piss me off, to ruin my whole night because that's what her fuckin mom does also. She has to get that little fuckin thing in that gets Dad started on it and saying how you SHOULD MAKE A COMMITMENT TO THE FUCKING TEAM... ya know what, I'll do what I want and since this a free fuckin country, I'll make my commitment when I want, not over the fuckin vacation but during school, and coach can go suck my dick. So because of my mom mentioning track, my dad yells at me, and now he's fuckin not taking me out tomorrow to get clothes. And to top it all off, the first message on the fuckin answering machine is the Almighty and Great Paulsome with the "Hey.. uhh.. tom...I was wondering if you were...uh...going to...track." Of course Paul had told me in school he had soccer and couldn't make any of the track practices so that's what I told my parents. But of course Paul changes his mind and decides to go to track and that leads to my parents thinking IM FUCKING LYING TO THEM! So you know what? I can't take this shit anymore, I feel like I can't do what I want to do. And that's exactly what it is. So for now on, fuck you if you think you can change me. Fuck you if you wanna change me. For now on, I'm me and I'll do whatever I want, and for now on, I don't care if it's the wrong thing and nobody else is agreeing with it, I choose for myself. If I want to moon my coach, I'll do it. If I want to burn down a few trees, I'll do it. Good night... don't worry tomorrow I'll be all better.  "Fuck it all, fuck this world, fuck everything that you stand for. Don't belong, don't exist, don't give a shit. Don't ever judge me." - Corey Taylor from Slipknot

      Ok, yesterday nothing happened in the day. It was time for Paul's bday party and Jared went to his house and Paul wasn't home so Jared came over my house and we told Matt to come and that we were putting up picket signs in front of Paul's house. Mine said "We Want Paul!"... Jared's said "No Paul, Party At Tom's! --->" with the arrow facing my house, and I made Matt's saying "We Want Food... And A Party!" On our way to Paul's we saw Mrs. Stoltz drive towards Ricky's house which told us she would be back in about 10 seconds with Paul, Ricky and the Easter Bunny Cake. Second time Mrs. Stoltz passes by, Jared chases her and then she turns around and chases Jared to Paul's. Matt arrived first and Matt comes out of his car telling us him mom thought we were assholes. It's true though. Then Paul finally arrived with Ricky. Mrs. Stoltz loved the picket signs so much she planted them in her garden along with her OWN picket sign... "It's A Boy!!!"... ya know, the thing from when Paul was born. Then I said, "There's a new device in your garden everyday," pointing out the awesome alien looking device sprouting out of the garden. Ok so everyone was there now, Jared S, Matt K, me, Nolan P, Ricky H, Shaun K, John R, Paul, Gabe W, Erin S, Emily G, Heather S, and Shapiro finally arrived... some time. We all played some basketball until everyone decided to stick me to a tree, get bungy cords and rap me to the tree and have those little monkies next door to Paul to beat the shit out of me. Seriously I have like 20 cuts and bruises now thanks to Paul and those little shits. Seriously, next time I see them, I will slice their heads off with my Papa's chainsaw. haha ok maybe not but I'll probably tie them to trees and start poking them with sticks. After torture, we played football. Erin took me down after me thinking she wouldn't tackle me so I ran right into her. Yea, I got stuffed by a girl, I admit it, she took me down hard also, my ass bone is broken. I think my team won, I made 2 touchdowns or 1, I'm not sure if the second one with Erin was one because we stopped after I was dead. It was still a fun game. Then we played soccer, something I can not do. I just sat around waiting for the ball to come to me and when it finally did I kicked it into the post and it flew back through Ricky's legs and came to me where I kicked it again and it went all the way out of bounds. For me, that was something to be proud of, I don't think I've ever scored an actual gole before. If I did, I'd probably get an orgasm. After the huge soccer game, we played more soccer (WORLD CUP) and everyone had fun playing soccer except for me... I had fun playing on the swingset. I kept going on the top of the monkey bars and singing Japanese mantras and saying Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and doing that thing where your right foot steps ahead but you step on your toes, I was so Japanese at that moment, I felt so awesome. Yea, it was all fun until Shapiro broke the dam wood swingset, then it was hilarious. He was on the swing and all the sudden... CRACK! BOOM! He took a hard fall onto the ground on his ass. Ouch! Then, we played some capture the flag which wasn't so great concidering I fell right into the swan in the garden. My pancreas is killing me now. The swan is alright and that's all that matters. After CTF, we ate some pizza... and some Matza pizza. We played more World Cup and then I sat behind the gole and had everyone take a huge shot at my ass. Unfortunetly, Ricky smashed my head. Then we went inside, had the Easter Bunny cake and then I went home to my mailbox to get Paul's present where I had hid it. It was a huge bag of pennies with a nice card of two black kids on the front, of course it was me and Paul. NO, don't think I'm that cheap, I gave him a 20 also. But I sware, Shaun is a true jew, he smelt the pennies before the bag was opened and of course all the jewish people at the party went crazy and started ripping the bag to find the pennies scattered all over the room. Paul opened all the rest of the presents and then me and Nolan played volleyball with pennies and balloons. It works! Finally, we played manhunt which was a shit load of fun. I ran and ran and ran from everyone and nobody could catch me! I had to hop fences, dive under bushes, hide in pots, hide behind cars, crawl 100 feet, create distractions, run around the neighborhood and direct my teammates to certain places. It was the greatest time ever. I can't explain everything in detail, if you want to hear it, ask me sometime. Finally we played DARE, not truth, truth is retarded. The first dare was for Ricky to run around the house with boxers, he did it. Then I humped the Petro truck, I did it. Then Erin had to take off her shirt and hug Paul, she did it... too bad it was dark out. Then Matt had to make out with Emily, HOLY SHIT MATT MADE OUT!!! GO MATT GO MATT GO MATT! Seriously, Matt deserves an applause for that. I mean, come on, it's Matt!!! GO MATT GO MATT! GO GO GO MATT! Then everyone left, I went sleepy, the end. Now finally to today Joe T came over, and I went to the movies with Paul, Ricky and Erin and a 10th grader, Tori. We saw Malibu's Most Wanted... funny movie.

      Ok, The Day After, our band is definetly the best. We got down two songs in two practices. Today's Paul's birthday so I want everyone to know it's his birthday, he wants to keep it secret. Ok... vacation, it sucks because coach has to be gay and all and make practices and meets during the vacation. I hate track, I shuda never joined, wow I havent blogged in a while. Well I don't know what I'm doing this vacation, I'm gonna be bored alot. I bought my room furniture today but rug I didn't get to yet. Then at night, I went to the movies with Jared, Toni and Jackie. We saw The Core... weird movie. Some of it seems a little farfetched. Ok Bye.

      I'm going to be brief about the last few days because of my computer that is shit. Yesterday, Friday, Paul pranked me, I went out to dinner with Paul, and then to the movies with Paul Matt and Ricky. Next day... today, band practice. We nailed down When I Come Around by Green Day perfectly. I just came back from my cousin's house, her birthday. That's all folks.

      You know what's so great... trying to figure what the hell Taking Back Sunday says in "Cute Without The E"... here's my results... meet faced down across your lawn, I thought that was the funniest line but there's more. I need Daniel to help tell me what the real words are. I got barely any sleep, track was hard, school was easy... me and Paul convinced alot of people in track that we were really fighting when it was a whole setup... WOOPS! I meen, Paul's a gay fag who likes to lick Yarmulkes and sing Hebrew songs and ties his shoes to the sound of Bahmitzfah music. LOL, we had Matt going for a while... well it was pretty believable. Then Paul missed the 3:50 and I made it... HA! I went home, went out to dinner to Panino's with my famiglia and then practiced drums and went to bed. BORING LIFE.   Dan can be very funny at times...Weerez8702: How to eat David Sunflower Seeds. Crack the shell with your teeth, eat the seed and spit the shell. Experienced seeders pop a handful of seeds in their mouth and store them in one cheek, then transfer a seed over to the other side with their tounge, crack it, then eat the seed and spit out the shell.

      I forgot to mention yesterday, my dad said the most funnies thing ever. He's always making fun of me and Paul and how we're always forgetting everything everywhere. Of course on our way home from getting the shoes he said the inevitable "If your head wasn't attached to your head, you'd forget it." So I said "Ok Dad, your not funny." Until he said "Just imagine you coming home without your head and then we have to go back and get it and when we find you in the locker room it's just your head on the bench with headphones on knodding your head to the beat really fast while screaming. Meanwhile Paul's looking around with only his head and he's next to you going 'What... What?' The two heads on the bench not even relizing their not on their bodies." That was the funnies thting my dad has ever said. Seriously, can you imagine that? Well you must have a good IMAGINATION!!!! Ok... to me that was important, today nothing new except I had to actually rewrite a whole summary on "Theseus." That was annoying, let's see, what else happened. Track, easy. Oh yes, my cousin Kate and her friend Patrice saw me run and they were cheering me on so it gave me some motivation to smoke Paul, AJ and Matt in the sprinting straight away. Science pretty much sucked without Joe. If you haven't noticed, I love science, no I don't love the science class, I love laughing in science. Oh, and the most craziest thing that happened today was I was hit in the balls by 2 different Jared S's. First in gym, after trying to hard and almost throwing up my sandwich I was standing behind Jared Solenstein when he fell back and elbowed me in the nuts. Yea yea yea, go ahead Crystal and Julia LAUGH WHILE IM DYING!!! lol Then at the end of the day I'm at my locker and Jared comes with Toni and their doing the usual, Toni closes my locker, Jared attacks me. This time, Jared used his track bag WITH HIS RUNNING SHOES!!!! Ok, he hits me 4 times in the back but then I go crazy, turn around and BOOM! This one hurt even more. 2 in 1 day! I fell to the ground but then I thought of EVIL and DEATH and SCREAMING CRAZY VOICES FROM SLIPKNOT and I got up, grabbed Jared and threw him into the science labs. Haha, ok so what really happened was I got up limping and I decided not to hurt Jared because what Matt said, "He's so cute and small, he's like a teddy bear!" lol I can never hurt Jared, it would hurt me to hurt Jared, instead I kick the shit out of Matt and Paul and team up with Jared!!! MWUAHAHAHA! So nothing else really happened. I got home, did homework, played drums all night. The End.

      Nothing happened today... nothing special... well actually a few things happened. In global, my group presented a project on the Mayans and practically failed it because our leader couldn't organize everything. In math, I'm getting a B for the 3rd quarter which is great because I was originally getting an F... the last major test, I got a 94 which raised my grade alot. I think the test counted like 5x. Lunch, everyone loved the smell of my chicken cutlet w/ sweet and hot peppers on fresh Italian bread sandwich. I have to say science was the funniest since a long time. Today Mr. Benzinger turned off the lights to show us some thing about the angle of the sun with a flashlight and I hear "Thomas" in Joe's hilarious voice. I turn my head quickly to the right to see Joe's face all smooshed together. I thought I was going to die of laughter, don't you hate when you know if you laugh, you'll get in trouble... that only makes you laugh harder and it takes breath away from you when you have to keep the laugh silent. Joe you really did look like the predator. Of course he added in his famous old man orgasms... actually there someone's orgasms, I'm not going to mention who. In track, we had to run inside which is molto fun. Thank god it snowed, I hate running on that fuckin track over and over again. We'll probably run inside tomorrow also. As soon as the 3:50 bus left from the school, I relized I forgot my track shoes. Well I went back 8 at night, got my shoes and Paul's along with all of Jake's clothes mistaking them for Paul's. But let's rewind to when I got home. I went to Paul's, we made milk shakes, we talked about the eclipse and how we're both going on Friday, and did our science homework. Paul has been punished for a very long time because his average for the 2nd quarter was a D! So we told "OUR" parents (WOBIN and MIKE) simutaneously that Paul, my brother, got an 96.3 average in science to make them all happy. This is true! Unfortunetly, I got in trouble when they found out Paul lost his cell phone. You see I'm responsible for everything Paul owns. That's right Paul, if it wasn't for me, you'd be like jello! Ok, enough about Paul, I got home, did my homework which I'm still not done with, and read another greek myth story called "Theseus." Personally, I think it's pretty good shit. You gotta read it for yourself, I like that minotaur and labyrinth crap, it's pretty fascinating. Ok, so then I ate some cool dinner with spicy chicken, green beans and curley fries... or "CURLY Q'S!!!" - As Curly would say in The Three Stooges. Which makes me want to watch it now. What else did I do, I went to get the shoes and I listened to alot of music. I don't know why I'm telling so much information but whatever, I just type away and you read... well I don't think many people actually read this but ok! Claudia Schiffer, she's a babe! Shaaaaaaaawing. Gooooooood Night.

      Today was so weird. There was snow in April?! Oh well, no track but we were one of the only schools not closed. All the schools around us were closed. At least we'll get a longer vacation in a couple of weeks. Nothing really happened today except my computer was acting all bitchy. I did homework, read some greek mythology with a labyrinth and a dude flies and his wings melt and he falls into the ocean, watched Men In Tights, played drums, talked online, listened to music, ate ice cream in a waffle bowl and then fell asleep... well I'm doing that now. Good Night. Oh yes, people remind me tomorrow to use my Linkin Park cd to check out the web site maker. Thanks and Good Night.

      Today I had neighborhood fun with the neighbors and Dave. We went in the woods and spent the whole time chucking sticks at each other. Then kidney stones came up in our conversation along with Tom Hanks and him having a kidney stone in the movie "The Green Mile." Well, we're saying you can get kidney stones out by radiation and Eric goes "Or you can just have that big black guy suck it out." We were all disgusted and then started cracking up when Eric says "No no no, I ment he uses his power to suck the the kidney stones out of him." And then we started cracking up. He didn't relize it sounded wrong. We got back to my house, Dave left and now we're all watching the Matrix. Also, Pat buried himself in Sports Plus tokens. What will happen tonight? I have no clue, I didn't have any homework this whole weekend because it's the end of the quarter. Well, I had to buy oaktag for my social studies group for some project we're doing but that's all. I guess I'm just going to sit around doing nothing the rest of the night. Good Bye.  Wait! Wait! Don't Go! One more thing, "NYC" in capitals in the font Wingdings are 3 symbols. First is a skull and bones, then the star of david which resembles jewish and lastly, a thumbs up. I've known this for a long time, I just never told anyone. The meaning of it is Jewish people dying is good. Also, type "Q33" in capitals with only the Q capitalized, leave the 3's and put it in wingdings font. Spooky isn't it?

      The scariest night of my life. Nothing good happened in the day. Track... I didn't even get to run because my relay team was too late and we missed our event so I basically woke up early in the morning to go in the freezing cold for 4 hours FOR NOTHING! The night was good but scary. Sorry Toni, next time we'll hang out. Dave and I went to Sports Plus and met up with the normal skating crew... Alan Alfano, Anthony Taormina and Brian. Eric wasn't there. Then Chris Post and Mike Harris showed up so it was all good. Anthony and Brian were pimpin with these nasty girls. Everyone left and Dave and I were sittin down. I went up to a girl and said she was good looking and all the sudden a bunch of pothead gangsters came up to me and started yelling at me and Dave. There was a huge circle around us and then these girls pushed them away and told us to walk away. So we walked into the rink and they followed us but we told the guard they were after us and he wouldn't let them in. We met up with Dave's friend, Chris Constantino and his mom, told them the story and jolted across 347 to borders and hid from the stupid wanksters. We called my mom to pick us up. Then we saw Mike, Chris and Alan and Mike had bought a play boy dvd. It was so funny. So the whole fact that these gangsters wanted to kill us was horrifying. Ok, Dave's sleeping over and now I'm leaving. Good Bye.

      Hey Everybody. No matter what important events happen in school, I can never remember what happens. All I remember is I got an F on the scales test and yelled at Mr. Keyes. It was fun. Track, we had to sprint a mile. Then I had to practice the relays with Ron York, Robert Ball and Kevin McLoughlin. We were running the 4x100 along with Shawn Kreiger, how ever you spell that, Nolan Porker, some dude that doesn't talk much and Chris Fletcher. Obviously they won. Kevin and I just stopped to find out they had already finished while I hadn't even gotten the hand off yet. That was gay. Oh, I forgot to say Mr. Shelley loved my bullying essay on somebody. IM me if you wanna know who it is. I got home today, got that new Linkin Park CD, Meteora... then copied it onto my computer for Joe Tringali. I played alot of drums today, gotta stay good for the band. One more thing, I made a milk shake.  For now on, I want everyone to know, I'm not going to explain the quotes I put on. I'll leave that up to you. Most of them are self explanatory and vague... ya you'll understand   most of them but some of them are hard!           ONE MORE THING, I'm obsessive compulsive so I must repeat this everytime. For now on, new subjects won't skip a whole line, for now on, I'll just hit enter and hit spacebar 10 times (tab) to be in paragraph form. Right now here comes the bus to school! CRAP! Later Pe...

      Some of the chain things that are sent throughout everyone with AIM or AOL are hilarious. Here's one...  KissableKerry69: Omg Omg...On This very day a Little girl named Katlyn Joshkaboki died at 7:01 on this very day ...age 2...ever since then on her anniversi of the day she dies Katlyn comes back to haunt everyone who gets this chain letter...at 7:01 TONIGHT you must send this to 13 pplz on ur buddy list...if u choose not to do this...u will be haunted by Little Katlyn 4 the restz of ur life...you may not think this is true but seeing a lil red headed girl with dark brown eyes that glow at night 4 the rest ok of ur life is maddddd scary...she has a gun nd a pocket nife she comes  to haunt u.... you better send this THIS IS NO JOKE...nd 1 more thing NO SEND BACKS TJG569: HAHAHAHHAHHAAHAHHAHAHAHAHA TJG569: she's 2  I got another of a 5 year old killing you and that was before the 2 year old one, maybe the next one will be a haunting fetus with a machine gun that will shoot me everyday and some how I won't die. Seriously, some people have no life... like whoever made that 2 year old baby should be shot... no seriously. I'd shoot him/her if  I  had a gun. This country is so funny and pathetic. People are actually so superstitious they believe a little 2 year old infant is gonna crawl around with a gun haunting you for the rest of their life.  Today nothing really, except I didn't go to track meet because I was sick. Sucks for everyone who went! HA! Holy shit, at 7:59 PM I was playing with my stereo and dvd's arranging everything to look cool (because my dvd's are stacked along my stereo on my entertainment system) and I just thought of Pee Wee Herman so I yelled said Pee Wee Herman in a funny voice quietly. Nobody else was near me, I guarantee it would be impossible for anyone to hear me say it. My sister runs upstairs saying "Dad we're watching Pee Wee Herman." It was freaky.  "I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your species. I realized that you're not actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment, but you humans do not. You move to an area, and you multiply, and multiply, until every natural resource is consumed. The only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet, you are a plague, and we are the cure."

      Wow, I haven't used this thing in 6 days... well there's nothing to write about except for today in school, I took Mr. Keye's scale test for the percussion section and actually didn't fail. I was amazed and happy as a pig in mud. Today in band, we had Mr. Andreas... ya remember him from the middle school? Tomorrow we have Mr. Kolar!!! I haven't seen him for a year so this is gonna be cool. He acts like a kid so that's why he's so cool. I forgot to mention the other day some dude had me play some huge hub cap with big mallet thingies and it was so much fun. Ya, all these teachers are trying out to take after Mr. Keye's spot on the job. He's retiring, RIGHT WHEN I GET THERE! WHAT LUCK I HAVE )=... I'm kinda depressed because I'm looking over all the rudaments and other crap I learned a while ago, and I can barely play them now, I'm a failure. Don't worry, I'll get my skill back in one day, things are like that with me, it takes me 2 seconds to learn something but then I forget it if I don't keep it fresh in my mind... or hands in this matter. Well, not having anything to write about went to a decent amount of music to talk about. Now me and my dad are going to watch The Matrix because he never saw it and wants to know what happens because he saw Reloaded. Ok bye.

      Nothing happened in school, except for some weird question on the health test, which one of these doesn't fit in, Frosty, Rudolph or Easter Bunny? I choose Frosty because the other two live and have organs such as a penis or vagina for those who believe Rudolph and the "Easter Bunny" exist. So Matt came home on the bus and Paul Matt and I all went to see our middle school teachers. Unfortunetly I NEVER SAW IURKA!  But I did meet fucking DOLAN! And in a bad way... you see we were all looking around not knowing you needed to call the school for permission before you came. We met three cool girls and hung out with them for a while and some security guard yelled at us for being in the school. So Dolan met up with us, I said I was Jake, of course being the one who lies, Matt and Paul told the truth. Mrs. Stoltz came to pick us up pretending I was Jake and that she didn't know me. I wish he was dead... seriously he is such a retard. He actually said "What if the roof caved in?" Matt replied in his head... "What if it didn't you fucker." That guy is the biggest orthodox homo. He makes the biggest fuss over the stupidest things that have no purpose in repremanding over. Ok, now I'm going to the movies "MATRIX RELOADED" with Matt. BUT OF COURSE WE NEVER FUCKING SAW IT, WE GOT THE GOD DAM TICKETS BUT LITTLE GOTH GIRL WOULDNT LET US IN. This country blows "nuggets" - Nick C... seriously, what the fuck, this country needs more free rights. Like kids are allowed to see a rated R movie if they have the ticket. Ok, so we saw Paul, Steve, James and Chad. Me and Matt got picked up at Sports Plus and with our remaining money, Matt bought LP Meteora and I gave my money to James for his birthday. Matt crossed 347 and almost got smooshed. I crossed the smart way, not at the intersection. When we got home, we watched all movies possible, then shot a few gangstaZ. End.

      Uh, everything has been all quiet and normal... nothing exciting, things fun should happen this vacation. Like I'm having a huge party with all types of species... come if you want. Ok, there's seriously nothing to write about except for I beat Enter The Matrix game and saw the Revolutions trailer they show after you beat it. Wow, I suck, everything is so boring. Ok bye..... WAIT! I REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED! I was jumping on the bed doing flips and matrix moves and I gashed my foot on my furniture. It hurt, I gritted my teeth, yelled out loud, then limped to the computer pretending like it didn't happen. My sister told my parents, my parent replied with "That's nice"... yes fun... Ok bye.

      Yesterday, I played alot of Enter The Matrix, my dad bought me my own lawn mower... beat that Shapiro! I mowed the lawn, that was a lot of fun. Then I talked to Kaiser for plans to see the Matrix Reloaded with Paul and other people but Paul got grounded when his parents saw his progress report (English and Math) so he got mad, punched his garage and me and him went running to Jenna M's. We talked and hung out at her house for about 30 minutes and then ran back home. I think it was a total of 8 miles or something. But before I ran I told Matt that we can go to the movies without Paul and with Jared and I said I'd be back around 7 and I WOULD CALL HIM if I could go. So, I'm returning home along Brooksite when my mom pulls up because my parents got worried where I was. My mom goes "Dad's been at our house for over an hour!"... so I said "So... doesn't Dad live in our house?" But ended up she was saying "MATT HAS BEEN AT OUR HOUSE FOR OVER AN HOUR." Right at this point, I was never more confused in my life besides for seeing the Matrix Reloaded. Matt being Matt, for some fucked up reason, came to my house at 7, stayed in my room until 8:30 and watched Gladiator pretending Russell Crow was killing a bunch of big people with Thomas heads on them. It was Matt's fault because I told him I would call him when I was ready. Matt, I don't understand you. So today... I played Enter The Matrix and finally reached the amazing part of the game where you have to stab a bunch of vampires with wooden sticks and kill that fuckin French Canadian asshole with the hot wife. I saved Niobe and now I'm up to this part where you must escape the two albino twins on the highway. Awesome. Then I did my homework while watching Lord of The Rings, then went to my cousins house for Kate's birthday. No more track but I still have the uniform, where do I bring it? Oh well, track is over, thank god.

      Today was hilarious. I don't know why, I guess Kevin at Jame's house made it funny. We had practice without Matt because he was running in track. I basically quit the last day to go to band practice. Chad and I played some free style along with James but we never had an official practice because Paul kept running off with Steve into town. Ok, Kevin is this man in his 20's who bikes around everywhere and has mental disabilities. Well, he's not that dum, he only thinks he goes 122 mph on his bike and everything including his daily fee for his cell phone costs $2200. Oh god, we were crackin. Then I came home, played the totally insane Enter The Matrix, then listened to Matt cry. GOoD Night.

      The movie was amazing, seriously, I can't tell you anything about it. You must see it for your self! Wow, the band concert was tonight, we were awesome, especially the ending Star and Stripes. I went to Carvel. After school, I couldn't go to track because of the concert and how much homework I had. I finished my homework and played a little bit of the new game I got, Enter The Matrix. That's awesome too. Now that I didn't go to track today, I can't attend the Fresh/Soph meet tomorrow... YES!!! Meno Male... or is it Mica Male... Thank god? Which one!?! Ok, you must see the matrix... go now, so see it before your life gets too boring. Nice hot black girls dancing  naked . Yesh, yesh, that wush shza fun pot. Ok goodnight.

      One hell of a day. I lost my 100 dollar calculator so I was going crazy all day looking for it. I didn't relize I lost it until yesterday (Sunday) and today after many questioning of everyone, I finally found out Elisa gave it to Mr. Benzinger, Mr. Benzinger gave it to this cool kid Tom D who claimed it was his but it wasn't. When I ended up getting it back by telling the main office to call him down, I was so happy so when I went to gym I went phsyco on Chris Michaelis and those cool cats. It was hilarious because as I was leaving the main office with Tom, the lady said Happy New Years and I said you too not relizing what she had said until I walked out and after I said you too. Track was too easy except for the two 11th graders who know I'm Kate Murphy's cousin, so they decided to take all my stuff out of my locker and throw it all over the locker room but it was funny when I found one of my shoes dangling from a window sill. I played a bit of Ultimate Frisbee, wow Shaun is amazing. Ok, so anyways Matt Kaiser brought me and Paul home, then the day ended. Everything done... I just can't wait to see The Matrix, I fucking hate Mr. Keyes, he made the god damn concert the night The Matrix comes out, maybe I'll skip school to see it, I'm not sure. All I know is, if I go on Friday, fuck the track meet, I'm seeing The Matrix with reserved tickets in advance at Loews.

      Yesterday was amazing, all out band practice, we finally had Paul come to our practice, he came up with an awesome original. We're not done with it yet but we will be soon, it sounds amazing. Then Paul had to go home and James, Mike and Matt slept over. We played James' amazing game... rolling gays where you basically roll around the floor beating the shit out of each other. It was hilarious at first until Heaton sqooshed me and James into the floor. We watched Signs, Austin Powers, the very end of The Fly II where they show the mutated golden retriever all sad and gross, and we watched Freddy Krouger but not all of it because Kaiser was complaining and wining about how it was too scary. I started falling asleep and Freddy was in my dream dancing with lepracauns. So Freddy isn't that bad after all. So we all fell asleep in the den and in the morning, played more music. It was an ultimate band practice. Then today, I bought my rug for my room and went to Pat's. Dan, Eric and Gavin were there. Yes. Now I'm preparing to be bored shitless because tonight I must babysit my sister because my parents are going bowling. Well fortunetly, tomorrow I'm going to my cousins for Mother's Day! w00t! ....Chigoom **door slammed**  One more thing... Kaiser is improving at guitar (= good job

      Nothing happened today, of course it's a normal boring school day along with a horrible cold and miserable loss to Longwood in our track meet today after school. It was fun though when AJ and Kaiser were around my side saying the funniest things. Randomly AJ says, "I  hate  fat people, I just wanna pop 'em." He said other funny stuff but there was one part where he blew the horn in my ear and I got pissed so I took it and pressed it and the whole school could probably hear it. Then I yelled... "AJ!! STOP PLAYING WITH THE SIREN!" Thank god we didn't get in trouble for disrupting a shitty track meet, what was the score 68 to 24? Longwood is incredible but at least I got my personal best in the 800... it's not good at all but it's kinda good for me... 2:36. Then I brought Dan and Paul home, ate sloppy joe's and did a shitload of homework along with Mr. Hennessy's lovely essays. )=

      We invented them. We used them as slaves and for our great life. Inevitably, they formed their own reformation and decided to take over our world. And we scorched the sky, thinking they needed solar power for life but not knowing instead of the sun they used, they would instead defeat us and use us for their own power. After our defeat, they discovered the power we held and duplicated us to an infinite amount. With this endless power source, they created a new world for us where we could let off our power throughout a dream for their benefit. That is what The Matrix is.

Let's see all the special things that happened, I went to Carvel, Paul announced he's not fuckin having a party after all so I can't perform with my concert for an actual audience. Have fun in Boston...)= Well, my band is still having a band practice tomorrow and maybe I'll sleep at Michaelis' tomorrow. Nothing good happened today, damnit... well I played drums for like 2 hours that's good but everything else sucked.  "Fuck this shit, I'm sick of it. You're going down, this is a war."

      Yesterday I had the garage sale, didn't work out too good, Jimmy and I searched around for other junk at other houses. We found two vending machines, we were going to buy them but our dads both disagreed. I got a cool issue of Nintendo Power yesterday, shows all the cool games coming up, there's a new James Bond coming out only it's third person view. Jimmy also showed me this thing in Montauk called "Camp Hero" which was a US Air Force Base but supposedly had to do with the same matters of Area 51... ya know, aliens, mind controlling, super mutated freaks, shit like that. Then I basically relaxed the rest of the night, this punishment turned out not so bad after all. Today I'm going to my cousins for my cousin Jenna's graduation party. I'm punished today also but it doesn't really count because I'm going to be gone at my cousins all day anyways. So I just say my punishment ended yesterday to make myself feel better. Right now it's it's 3:00 AM. Uh... I stayed up until 2:30 AM watching good movies, especially "Don't Say A Word." Good morals and shit. It's worse to watch a crime and do nothing then to commit the crime. What other movies... uh... I watched some MTV2 and Fuse, Wet Hot American Summer, and Livewire or something with aliens destroying our world.  Ok people, the party was awesome, hilarious and Dan's friends are cool. (Dan's my cousin) We talked alot about the Matrix. Ya, we set off a few car alarms, did matrix moves to each other in the pool, played Marco Polo (Chris Columbus) and basketball... and we had a shit load of laughter and fun. Ok later.  Oh yes... you see these little girls have been calling lately asking for Jessy... well they think they're pranking me... I ended up pranking them with special soundboards and I bet they won't call again which is kind of dissapointing because it's alot of fun, so whoever you are, keep calling, it keeps me happy. (= By the way, pranking is a man's job... not for girls at all, especially if they have annoying an voice of a 4 year old.

      Today... uh... I mowed the lawn, played drums, broke the bass drum head )= and basically sat around the house doing nothing because I'm punished. Said good bye to Paul and uh... ya that's it, hopefully tomorrow will be something good... but I'm still punished tomorrow. I got punished for sleeping over Paul's the other night without asking. Ah, who the hell who cares. It's fun doing nothing.

      Slept at Paul's with Ricky. Before that me and Paul spent the night biking around Smithtown. We saw Kate G and said our farewell for a while. We watched The Hot Chick, really funny... Hi my name is Grandma Fuck Y'all... fuck y'all if ya nasty darling. L to tha I to tha N to tha G... Ling Ling, you forgot your bling bling! Nigga please. Oh god, that was hilarious. Ok, so then we all went to Ricky's house for pool fun. Ricky chased us with a remote controlled jet ski around the pool. That was fun. Uh... then we had to go, Ricky had soccer, we went back to my house and basically did nothing. Then went to Jared's party. We had to pick up Crystal and Nolan. At the party, it was all crazy. I mean in my eyes it was, I was running around psycho. It was fun, but I was the only one going crazy. Kind of boring group of people. Except for a couple of guys who went along with me. Jason, Clement, Kaiser and Stoltz were the only ones going all out. It was still fun though. I mean we had food and shit. That was good. Like brownies, Toni rubbed all the brownies on me. I made a smiley face on myself and named it George. Then I made some mouth music (beat boxing?) for the bball playazzz'zzz entertainment. Then I became an Indian with Crystal, Jackie and Toni, I don't think they realized they were Indians though... sitting Indian Style. Then... uh... I played some game but played too rough and hurt a few girls by accident. It was sad, but then Toni smashed my head with the volleyball so then it was even. So after a hard core party at Jared's, I brought Crystal home, then went home, talked to a few people, played The Sims, went to bed.

      Crap, I can't remember a dam thing that happened yesterday. Today... nothing happened. I basically hung out with Matt, Paul and Heaton the whole two days but now I'm going to check up on the orthodontist... well he's checking me up... or out... or or in... upside down? Then, basically I'm going out to dinner with my family and relatives for my cousin's middle school graduation. I love it, my family celebrates everything, and I'm reeping all the benefits! Mwuahahahaa, beer pong. All I remember was CAPS LOCK. I've come to a conclusion that this blogger helps me remember what I've done in the past days of my life. I'm like my grandma, suffering short term memory loss, succeeding in remembering what I did when I was 2. It's so ironic, I just want to go Poof! Ya... like the new template? I thought you would. Now I rememeber, I just rode my bike, drummed, got a strawberry icee just before, and yesterday played band with "them" and went to Ricky's and played this awesome game on the tramp. I miss tramp ball. Good old days with boys older and stronger than me. I loved getting whipped by almighty powerful Eric. His slaps would make me so happy, it made me feel loved. Ok enough of this, BUT I CAN'T WAIT FOR SIX FLAGS IN AUGUST! I wonder what I'm going to do this summer for my birthday. Ok gg cya people later. SHWOOOF!

      Now that I think of it, that was the first time I ever used a ? at the end of a blog. Well, congratulations THOMAS! If that's even how you congratulator. Yesterday, I did came home from Pat's, went to Paul's to hang out with him and Heaton. We watched Harry Potter... I hate those damn movies, they don't have a bit of revenge. It's just so dumb how Harry in the first and the second movie, kills the bad guy by either stabbing a book or giving him a face lift. It's so lame, if I were to make Harry Potter, there would be guns and explosions. There would be heads flying in the air, and bullets soaring through people's bodies. AND JESUS CHRIST, Robert Weasley's little sister was killed and the boy has Harry avenge her death for him. If I was Robert, I would pull off the matrix on that mother fuckin snake. Also, I'd stop using magic. It's so lame, it makes kids think they're so cool and magical. Well... anything to get kids away from gangsta clothing. Now little kids dress as wizards, not wankstas. Ok, so after watching Shitty Shitter: The Shitter of Shitlets, we went to Heatons and if you read Heaton's blogger, IT IS ALL WRONG. We watched The Animatrix and all of 9 cartoons were awesome. Maybe it's because I'm a Matrix fanatic so it amplifies how much I like something that has the word MATRIX on it, by about 10x. I kicked Paul's ass in Tony Hawk 3. I didn't want to go in the pool because I hate pools and it was freezing and I didn't have a bathing suit. Also, Paul and I weren't humping each other, I was kicking his ass once again. Mike's brother Billy brought us home and I was bored the rest of the night.  I must know. Is this a real world where some time in the future we will fall into the hands of our own creation... or am I actually dreaming right now and the future has already occured. I must know because if I am dreaming, I can believe and belief is fate, fate is the truth, and the truth leads to the ability to awaken oneself.

      Well....yesterday I went to my aunt and uncle's rewedding. It was funny, especially Jabba The Hut in the choir. Yes, I made a few fake farts in the church along with a few giggles. Also, the priest... I mean I said mozzletoff, he said WRONG! Back at my cousin's house, the priest came to visit there to so we couldn't cuss or wear our yamakas. Then my cousin pissed across the street. Uh, today lots of fun at Kaiser's. First Matt and I rode bikes around to Chris Michaelis' house where Matt cried because he was lost. Then he got more lost so cried so more. When I say cry, I mean whining and fussing, not literally crying. Don't worry Matt if you cried I wouldn't tell the whole 3 people who actually read this. Ok, so Matt tried to get me lost but it didn't work because I'm MISTER NAVIGATION. then we went to the mansion AND THEN!!! we split into two different ways eeeh haii. Yes, I biked all the way to Huntington and Matt went back to his neighborhood. It was awesome, I crossed Sunken Meadow Parkway and everything. I was so confused. I had to ask an ice cream man to find my way back. It was so silly yet so fun. Then some lady flew in front of me and I flipped over the handle bars while laughing because the dog barked in a funny way. I got up thinking I was fine, I started biking away and realized there was a cut below my knee almost down to the bone. I choose not to get stitches because their a big bitch. Instead I sped back to Matt's, he treated me like a little baby, put the Sesame Street bandade on me with the cream stuff, fed me my yogurt and tucked me into bed. Then the big boys came over, and I'm talking one year older than us... that's right, the 10th graders. Pat, Dan, Ahmad, Chris and many others were there. We played Ultimate Frisbee for a very long time, my team won both times. We also played manhunt, then walked around the block where I found a bag of bread where Bryan threw it all over me. I got over excited and celebrated with moldy bread all over me. Now I'm sleeping at Patrick Olsen's where I will have molto fun. Good Bye?

      Well... I'm sick of this "Tommy Goo's Life"... it's a waste of time and nobody reads it. I don't really want to explain what happened in the past few days because it's not like you care. I mean come on, I don't expect you to, maybe if I was a celebrity you'd care but I'm a normal teenager like everyone else. This thing just tells people boring stuff about others and I'm not going to write in this anymore unless you IM me saying "Write more, we all read your journal." I know one person that reads it, Paul... and that's it. Hey, funny thing is I can reveal my true secrets and nobody will know because NOBODY READS THIS!!! One more Science Regents and summer officially starts and school is officially over until September. YES! LADIES! BEACHES! ANGELINA JOLIE!!!! Oh wait... I forgot who I was, well I'll dream about GIRLS AND BEACHES but dreams are dreams and and these dreams seperate me from the real girls... poor Thomas. Hey, maybe I'll have some chance with a hot girl when I'm older... I'm talking 67.  Tom's Secret of The Day - Tom has only 1 1/2 friends. Chris Michaelis and his half cousin.

      Wow, I haven't written in 4 days or so because the end of school has been so cool. You see, I completely hate school along with books, words, and chalk. I completely hate all the teachers except Ms. Lazarus and unfortunetly I have some tests tomorrow, Tuesday and Thursday. Ok so what happened on Friday you ask...Matt, Paul and I went to Jill's house because Shapiro was there along with another hot girl that was in my Italian class in the beginning of the year. Then Shapiro, Matt and I went into town and Paul had to go to his sister's dance recital to hump pillows. We flew to Subway's and then when we went to Cornet, Shapiro went bye bye. We saw Laura C, Stephanie G and Annabel W there. Matt joined in on their little guitar pow wow. It was funny because Matt was picking up all these expensive guitars and the guy probably wanted to knock his head off. Me on the other hand took a different approach... THE BONGOS. Then Matt and I left to Incredible Ices and I got a strawberry. By the way, Matt got good at guitar... playing Stairway To Heaven, well it isn't the hardest song to play. It is mine and my father's favorite Led Zep song though. Sounds sort of like a mid evil enchanted story book song in the beginning. Then Matt and I went to my house, Paul couldn't sleep over because he failed Math and was punished all Summer. He told the news to us on the phone, but I wasn't a bit surprised... "Is that kid smoking pot?" - My Papa. Ok, so he comes over SAYING FOOLED YOU!!! That was a relief. Then Dan came over to play some guitar and then when we showed him Jesus on the computer screen, he started freaking out slapping himself trying to get Jesus out of his head. Then we played Ding Dong Ditch and I rang the Mofia's house!!! Holy shit, me and Dan were pissin our pants running. The guy came out cursing in Italian while we tried to catch up with the two pussies, Paul and Matt, who were afraid to ring any house. Especially Matt... his excuse was there was no where to hide but when we brought him to a house with a million hiding spots, he hid from us! Ok, so yesterday... Paul, Matt and I biked to Country Kitchen, me and Matt took the 111 route and beat Paul! He took the Main St. route (actually back alley of the stores). Paul and Matt were being babies and they spilt their orange juice. Jared's sister served us. And... that's basically it for the rest of the day. Except we went to the big 97.5 WALK bear on Main St. and took a million stickers and sponsored the station by putting the stickers on a million people. I gave one to this lady in a car, and she freaked out thinking I wanted to rape her. We also saw Steve F. Ok, so Matt and Paul had to go, I ran around the neighborhood and saw Louis Amato and Ryan G... and Cody C (not with Ryan and Louis)... actually it should be Louis and Ryan, alphabetically OH GOD I HATE THIS OCD!!! Then I watched the lightening. I babysat my sister at night while watching Peter Pan for Crystal. Then I watched Ice Age and passed out. Today, I gave my dad an awesome Father's Day Card and I'm gonna see my cousins!

      One major important announcement to make - Christina Aguilara and Pamela Anderson both look putrid and repulsive without make up on. FACT!!!  I think I will cry because tomorrow is our last day of school, Friday the 13th, the seniors are gonna end up doing some fucked up shit like last year. Only bad luck lurks around the halls... hense the date... FRIDAY THE 13TH!!! Matt Kaiser is gonna get attacked by Freddy Krooger or maybe Donkey Kong. Ya, sometimes Donkey Kong can be the man... if he tries hard enough. I mean Jesus Christ Mario, you can never reach the top without DK beating the shit out of you just by throwing barels at you. Which reminds me, Donkey Kong Country... amazing game. So anyways, today was gay. I took a test in every god dam class but did good on them all, I think? I saw that 80's Porno security guard again, ya he freaks the shit out of me. Him and his tight 80's clothes... god it's like we wants to be brutally whipped with chains, belts and vanilla flying saucers. Oh, I was reading my sister's magazine "Twist" and it was so funny... you see, this dude, Adith from Florida said every single guy measures their dick every day. I think he's a foreigner from his looks and attempt to act "cool". COME ON JESUS CHRIST, 1st of all I don't use rulers, they don't make them big enough. Second of all, who has the time to measure each day, and is it from back bottom to top or front bottom to top... ok nevermind this penis conversation that I'm having with myself... and the blogger. Let's talk about how crazy ass awesome tomorrow is going to be. Come on, I had no homework tonight and tomorrow all we're going to do is party! I think I might celebrate Santa's birthday. It's like June 29th or something like that. I'll bring in a yarmulke (yamacha, no not yamaha) to show my love for Christians. You know right now I'm just talking diddly squat jibberish British mumble... take Heaton for instance. "So Tom, wiriwj roj3yh ridjow jfoih wfg, with the reindeer name bane shun il il water way?" I think he was talking about a reindeer named Bane who fell off a roof and into a river... but beats me, he's Heaton and he's Heaton. Oh god, remember the time when I was talking about Donkey Kong on my blogger? Memories are sweet. So is revenge. That band I have, yes The Day After isn't working out too good with James and Heaton fighting like little pussy clams. Which makes you think... wtf, I mean, WTF IS A PUSSY CLAM!? It can be something like a hat, or a baseball mit.

Ok so this is what I did...  - Track Party... "pizzer and soder" - Mrs. Feltman - Accidently pissed off Kaiser - Went to Shapiro's with Matt and Paul - Matt went to mall so Matt, Paul and I went to Brady to play basketball - I brought Matt to Paul's house to get picked up and he got really scared when he realized his backpack was still in Shapiro's locked house. (Big Trouble Matthew) - Went back to park, Paul and I went to get ices, we got our picture taken, said happy birthday to King Icee, went to Walgreens for a card for Paul's mom, then bought The Ring for Paul's mom (It's her buffday) - Went home, got some sleep, played drums, went on compy, sent the TDA 1st original "Behind My Back" song to all of you hard core TDA fans... that means everyone...

      Well... I played drums for 2 hours straight again and now my hands are destroyed and full of blisters. Uh, I finally found out what really happens in the Matrix Reloaded. You see at first I thought one door led to the destruction of the matrix along with Trinity and the robots but saved Zion and the other door led to the destruction of Zion but the saving of Trinity and the Matrix, and 23 people would be able to restart Zion. Now I know, the door Neo didn't choose was the door all the other ones chose, the door to the restart of Zion and the Matrix and 23 people from the Matrix to restart Zion. All the ones had to deal with love but never loved their love as much as Neo did and Neo believed that he could save Trinity along with Zion if he picked the other door. So he picks the door which leads to the complete destruction of the human race but saving Trinity. This would also lead to the destruction of all robots because without humans or sun, the robots cannot survive. Then again the architect did say there are other means of survival for AI. Neo picked the door not traveled because he had faith that he was Jesus, you saw him in the real world, he destroyed the sentinals in the real world which doesn't prove there's "a matrix in a matrix" for all you assholes out there, it proves Neo is Jesus and that he can save Zion and destroy every robot.   General Summary   - The First door leads to the destruction of Zion and restart of the Matrix, 23 people from the Matrix to restart Zion (not including Trinity and she dies in the Matrix)          This door was chosen by the last 5 "Ones" - The Second door leads to the total extinction of the human being which leads to the end of AI (Architect said there's other ways for AI to survive)          Neo picks this door - Neo is the only one who picks the second door because he was the only one who loved someone so much and had so much faith (He's Jesus) - Neo kicks ass in real world too... which obviously means destruction of robots, saving the world - The dude in the end of Reloaded on the table was Agent Smith inside Bane (Dun Dun Dun!) - Neo and the rest of Zion now have 24 hours in Revolutions to wipe out the attack on Zion and shut down the matrix... screw all the people living in it!  Wow, ok I got that out of my system. That's what really happened. Now I'm done.

      Ah yes, Smithtown Day. I went with Matt, so many people... and scared the shit out of Angelica at Mamma Sbarro's or whatever it's called now. I bought these cool Agent Smith sunglasses and that's how I scared her... just popped out of nowhere. We met Jared there after looking for him in the moonbounces. We bought sugary popcorn, a churro and Jared got himself a tube full of sugar? Ok, so after it all, Jared left, me and Matt saw Ryan G and watched him kick ass at the pitching game. He won a prize... a baseball that is attached to a string and flies back at you, breaking your nose. So basically, it's $3 to impossibly get over the high speed of your age, and when you do get it, all you get is a broken nose from the bounce back baseball. It was so dum, the guy must of been retarded... he had 13-15 yo must throw 60 and then 16 and up must throw 80. How is that possible? One year from 15 to 16, getting a 20 mph pitch difference. The wife heard me call the guy insane and gave me a look. Then sprayed Bryan Rankee with ass. It's a can of ass. Well it's called Fart Spray but it literally smells like an actual asshole. I had it on my finger and I wiped it on Matt, we didn't lose the ass smell until an hour later. Then we arrived at Paul's house after a very long walk. Matt went home because he didn't want to see Ricky make out with Erin while Paul makes out with Emily. It didn't bother me so I stayed. It was so funny, Matt called his mom to pick him up and some how, literally 20 seconds later, his mom came! So I watched 2 movies, Old School and Billy Madison (3/4 of Billy). It was very funny watching them all make out. One day I'll be in Ricky or Paul's spot fucking hot girls... some day... I think. Ok, so until next time. Keep reading my blogger and I'll keep laughing at you.

      Today there was an ultra band practice/recording session. We got our first original, "Behind My Back", on the site, check it out. Then nothing else happened except I got a double bass drum peddle, a Matrix Reloaded and Linkin Park poster and new furniture and a rug. Wow, I am spoiled. Thanks to my dad, I love the guy. Then Jimmy came over for a bit to see some stuff (furniture) and he showed me his burnt illegal Matrix Reloaded on DVD. Then I heard the Jamaican music, thought it was the tabernacle across the street but it was only a little party blasting music. I went to go see it and when I finally saw it the music stopped, you know what that means! The girls stopped dancing! Ok... I'm going back to see it because the music started again and I wanna see girls dance... because I have no life... and I'm desperate... and I use spoons, not forks. JESUS! THIS MUSIC IS SO AWESOME!

      More and more I feel I'm growing too weak to type in this "blog"...my bones are fragile and I have little time to live. Yesterday and today we had a band practice, took a bunch of pictures and completly nailed down our original "Behind My Back". Basically everything has been band time lately... we want to go places and become famous! It's sad because Matt's out and now he hates me. So I lost another friend because he thinks I hate him and that I can only be his friend if he's in my band and I'm the one that allowed him to come in in the first place. haha, I just relized it, I've been losing all my friends, I don't know how. I think it's because I don't hang out with anyone anymore. All life is for me is band. band. band. Ok Bye  Wait... please for me... DOWNLOAD GEORGE GERSHWIN'S "Rhapsody in Blue" it is the most beautiful song in history. Especially the part that sounds like the ending to Mission To Mars. I sware it made me cry. Beautiful... beautiful. You think I'm joking, it is god.

      This weekend I went to Kerry G's to play manhunt w/ Paul, Ricky, Matt, Emily, Kerry and other people. Ah! I just saw a...AH! THERE IT IS AGAIN! a white huge ferret just crossed the road. Ok so where was I, ah yes... we played manhunt, it was fun. Then we went home, Mrs. Haley was mad because we had her drive us home at 12. My mom was supposed to originally but she was high and didn't know how to drive... well she wasn't high, but she was pretty tired. So, Matt slept over. Then the next night I slept at Chris'... that was hilarious. There was a senior party across the street and we kept yelling random shit out the window and they heard us and laughed all drunk and crap. Ya, I didn't fall asleep until late... but I fell asleep right away with Matt, which proves Matt is boring and can't keep me awake unlike all my other friends. Chris did this by yelling and making me laugh to the point of bladder explosion. Matt, you gotta try making me laugh, it takes the sleepyness out of me. Oh, and the time I fell asleep under Dan's computer desk, those were the days. So what else happened, ah yes, I got that Gamecube/Gameboy hooker upper... and Tingle makes me laugh hard... I mean really hard. I got mad at my dad today because he was being a homo, I forget why but he was. My sister pissed me off also, she was talking all advanced and mature so I asked her how to catch a pokemon and she replied with "I have no clue." WHICH PROVES I AM SMARTER!!! Come on! Everyone knows how to catch a pokemon, let alone HAVE POKEMON RED! That game and Zelda are the greatest... well Pokemon used to be fun, it sucks now. It got too boring. Ok, now I'm not concentrating on that dum ferret anymore so I'm gonna go sleepy. Bye

      Yesterday, I slept at Keith's...then went to my Aunt's. Went in her pool, hung out with Peter and his cool friend Eric. We saw Final Destination 2. That movie was awesome. Then my aunt put me through misery and pain by popping a blackhead, she's obsessed with looks. The thing wasn't even big...she said girls care so I allowed her to do it. THEN, I forced my mom to bring me to blockbuster because I was in pain. Haha slave mommy...kinda like clone baby. Don't ask why I capitalized THEN, I don't even know why I did that. Ya, the King's Park blockbuster is alot better than Smithtown's. Splinter Cell wasn't at Smithtown's but it was at King's Park and King's Park has a million more games and it looks alot nicer. Ya anyways Splinter Cell kicks ass. Today I hung out with Mike and Matt, went into town, saw the Cuccinellos, had pizza and Italian ices, saw that same gay little 10 year old and he again started with us, we ignored him. But if he does it again, I'm going to smash his fucking head in. I hate little kids who think their so tough and cool. Well I hate anyone who thinks their tough and cool. Heaton bought a Darth Maul figure...I don't know why. So we went back to my house, they watched me play Splinter Cell, Mike left because he biked to my house and had to get back before dark...he made it by a few hours IDIOT!!! and I gave Matt drum lessons until his momma came.Ok I'm bouncin'...piece foo.  Please take time to read this.  Last night I was stayed up till 4 playing Splinter Cell and chatting on the computer, I couldn't last any longer and I passed out on my bed. In my dream I could barely keep my eyes open and I was extremely tired, and I felt it. I felt it all. I felt it just as I felt it before and after dreaming. In my dream, I was laying on a couch calling out for Neo who was sitting on the coach across from me, a coffee table seperating us. I was holding a book, kinda like a comic book or magazine and it had a green flashing eye on it. I dropped the book, stopped calling out for Neo and fell asleep on the couch in my dream. That's all I can remember but as Tool said "I'm slipping into a dream within a dream." Lately I've been having weird dreams of either nuclear wars (with funny random endings RIGHT CRYSTAL HAHA, waking up and thanking god to see a blue sky, green grass and a guy mowing the lawn), robots killing us all, or us taking them over. I saw it all, I was a slave in one dream, I lost my family in all of them, the tragedy was to its fullest. Either way I saw it all, the death, the innocent flesh scattered throughout our world in red. Our world at its greatest doom. It's almost like it's inevitable to happen. These dreams might scare you but accept the fact, it just might be our future. Don't laugh, don't make fun. Know you're dreams are your best friend. Listen to them, they might help you.

      Ok sorry these last 4 days have been exciting and fun...but...I forgot everything that happened, except for last night. Party at Abby's, Matt Kaiser made out!!! Woo!!! I'm so good, I forced him to with Abby. Unfortunetly, it was after everyone left so me and Jared never got anything. It was cool, I tried to get Keith to come but he couldnt. Ray H was there. I also remember I slept at Jared's with Matt the other night. God, my memory is shot.

      Yesterday hung out with Matt, then Matt and Mike slept over. Today we to Mike's for his pool...and money hehe and then went into town to get pizza. But it was funny because before we got there, we were at Cornet and the guy yelled at Matt for playing too much with the guitar and amp... he said to Matt, "Ok, are we shopping or rehearsing?" It was funny because last time all the girls came to play and they didn't get yelled at and Mrs. Kaiser goes there and the guy's nice to her. Once again, I'm sick of adults hating teenage boys. Ok, so we ate pizza and on the way there we passed this guy that was listening to music and probably didn't realize he was out loud rapping. Dumb gangsta. Then as we entered KB Toys I yelled out "Oh goody KB TOYS!" and this little punk next to his bike around the age of 11 repeated what I said. Little fuck was lucky I was in one of my good moods, or else I would of sent Heaton to sit on him and steal his bike. So Mike and I got free Nintendo booklets with all the new cool games, "WOW!" Some of the games there kick ass on price, their like $20 for like Mary Kate and Ashley...man that game is on my THINGS I NEED list. No but seriously, they had cool extremely discounted games like Turok, Timesplitters 2, some sport games, and the best of all, Piglet's Big Game. I really want those Matrix figurines. They look real like my grandma's fluffy blonde hair is real. Which reminds me Dan's little brother Nick - "Why are your pants all fluffy?" Funny funny Nicholas. NICHOLA! Oh... I mean Ricola. Yes now where was I? Oh yes, in KB Toys Matt found those huge hulk hands and when I wasn't looking just punched me and I almost fell into the display. For me that was the funniest part of the day, Matt with huge green hands and when I turned around to see what the hell hit me I see him all innocent and happy. So I punched him in the stomache, woops. Then we were walking back to my house, and...uh...nothing happened? Ok, saw a spider in my room, me and Mike got all freaked out. I stepped on it after Mike stabbed it off the roof with a meat knife. Yes, sorry, but this is a big thing to me! I HAVE ARACHNOPHOBIA! And that's basically it, they both left, well Mike ate over. I told Mike I was going to bed early but...eh...uh...screw that, I can't fall asleep early. - Just incase you haven't a clue who's typing all these journal entries of useless junk... - Thomas H...and let's just leave it at that.  Holy Crap...I mean HOLY CRAP!!! if you click on sport games...it freaking brings you to a freaking sports website...now I would know if I freaking put that there and I didn't...compy 386, my computer is pretty damn smart to put that useless crap advertisements for sports on my SPORT GAMES!!! It's like...woah wait...I wonder if I type sports it'll be underlined... OH !!!! haha sorry people for confusing you, it's only for people who have Text Lookup that comes with Imesh. OK NEVERMIND EVERYTHING IN THIS PARAGRAPH!!!!!!!!

      Well...uh...what should I talk about...for the past 5 days I've been in Montauk. If you didn't know already, every year I go to Montauk with my cousins. So, on our way there, we stopped in some market place near the Hamptons and I acted like I was from England with Kate and Brittany. Then we arrived in Montauk, went to this little restaurant for lunch and I asked the waitress about Camp Hero (which I saw the last day of Montauk) and asked about all the secret shit going on around there and she denied it... but she said it does exist. Then we arrived at Wavecrest where we got our rooms and unpacked. The first day was boring and we didn't really do anything but sit around. Britt and I went to the beach for a few minutes, I jumped in the ocean with my clothes on...couldn't resist, those waves kick BUTTOX! The second day was normal... except for the raging seagulls which made Britt and I die of laughter. Well you see we were eating in the morning (what the hell, who says that???...breakfast) at my place, and there's a picture on the wall of a seagull screaming into the sky with its wings back in the air. So I show it to Britt and explain that the seagull did that earlier in the morning when I fed it whoppers. We both turn around and see the seagull charge up its roar by putting its head between its legs and then it throws its head up in the sky and opens its huge mouth and yelps and then walks away yelping. WA WA WA! WAWA WA!!! That was the funniest part of Montauk for me. The next day, Thursday, the Troianos (my other cousins) came and I hung out with awesome Dan and Chris the whole day making fun of everyone around us (obviously behind their back). Last year we messed with the spanish cleaning ladies with walkie talkies but their frequency this year is 69 and ours don't go that high. But we got alot of funny people that talked to us, like one boy who spotted me on the beach and said "You're the one in the red" and it was freaky knowing he knew where I was. I never found out who that kid was but this other dude came in out of nowhere and said "Room 666" when Alison asked Jennifer (really Britt) what room number she was. Ok so back to the making fun of people. There was this one lady that looked like a toad because she was old and huge and she floated in the middle of the pool with gloves on her hands and feet. She was really nice though so we were kind to her and the next day we unbelievably saw her at a restaurant "Navy Road" the next night. Ok then there was this other group of retards who were either black or spanish. They were all young and their parents were white and old, obviously an adoption clinic thingy magiggy. Gettin' jiggy with it? They all freakin followed me, especially this girl Hana who was around 7 and trying to teach me safety rules of the pool, I'll get back to that later. But Dan, Chris and I made fun of this black girl with huge tits and looked like Michael Jackson. I was dared to crash into her tits but ya know, that would be cruel. Then there were these old lesbians that we named Tortous and Toad The Second. Toad II pissed us off my giving us the stink eye and running across the pool with a cruel face. I think she didn't like us because she heard our perverted mouths. Us 3 boyyzzz walked down the beach, and Dan you never went into the WATER!!! )= This annoying kid that's friends with the Murphy's (my cousins) named Joe annoyed the shit outa us 3 boys. Ya and since there was so many people, 4 families (Ralphi and Matthew also {even know their awesome})... we couldn't go out to dinner. Bullshit! That pissed everyone off. Uh...bonfire at night...marshmallows, Troianos left ***ULTRA )=*** and I stayed up till 1 watching the fire with Billy, Andrea (Billy's girlfriend), Kate and Britt. I think it was 1...who knows. The next day was depressing concidering it was just us and the Murphy's again but it's still cool, Britt and Kate are fun, just that it's more fun when there's more cousins than just 2. Well this day was definetly torture, concidering that damn retard Hana freaking kept following me again. She even tried to make friends with my mom. Then her little brother who looks like Sally's creator in the wheel chair from Nightmare before Christmas, attacked me and said "Gotcha!" He did the same to Britt also... uh... ya annoying as hell, so we tried to avoid them as much as possible. Ok so on Friday night, we went to Navy Road and that's when we saw Toad with her husband. Billy kept saying "That's a HUGE BITCH!" it was great, and we'd keep replacing bitch with other words. I put asparagus in my teeth and asked everyone if there was anything in my teeth. Um...what else, I made silly faces to make Kate and Brittany crack up...uh... damnit what else was funny, I dunno but the damn mozzerella sticks shot hot juice all over me and weren't even completely filled with cheese, RATED 0 STARS BY THOMAS H GRIMALDI. Then when leaving, I yelled out "THATS A HUGE BITCH" into the kitchen. This was the same restaurant as last year's when the gay owner asked my dad if he needed assistance on urinating. 0=!!! Then we all watched Superstar back at Grandma's. Finally today, Saturday we packed up, went to the beach and pool for the last time, said goodbye to great legendary pool keeper for the 6th time??? and then went to Gosman's to shop. That was fun, we ate and shopped, but forgot shopping, the eating part was the fun part. Ice cream and hamburgers with zippers. My grammy bought me a Montauk t-shirt and right now I have no clue where it is, hope grandma doesn't still have it, wait no I put it in my mom's bag!!! A few years ago the Murphy's lost like $200 worth of clothing at Montauk...very dissapointing and very odd. Oh yes, and grammy this year was very depressed and didn't have any fun at all, she's sad because she's old and not able to do certain things she used to be able to do... such as be the best runner on her block. YA RIGHT!!! PSH!!! OK FINALLY, we stopped at John's Homemade place with we ate these overated hamburgers. This guy on my dad's softball team told him they were great and that he used to go there like every day after work or something, so my dad decided to take his advice and get some, hamburgers are hamburgers...they were normal...nothing amazing. Then we arrived back home (= and hopefully next year we will go somewhere better than Wavecrest, we're planning something like a cruise or Florida or a house in Virginia...we don't know yet. JESUS THAT WAS FREAKING LONG!!! Ok that's all, now I gotta sign up for this Long Island Drum Center Giveaway contest. Also, I'm watching my sister as my parents party for Nick A's bday down the road... OK BYE!!!

Ok that's all. Well I'm watching Saving Private Ryan, and it sickens me. It's a great movie though...but it gets me a little too excited!!!

      Oh swoof! Haven't typed in a while. Uh all I remember is a few days ago on the 8th where I went to the movies with Kaiser and Jay H... we saw Sinbad, woah I explained this already. Yes, then Friendly's. Next day, the 9th. I went to the movies with Jay H, Joe T, Nicole I, Laura C, Annabel W, and this other girl Jamie. We saw Pirates of The Carribean... Annabel and Jamie didn't sit with us because they didn't want to sit so close to the screen. We got there late so there weren't many seats left available. Well, good seats at least because two idiots decided to take up a row we needed. Nicole and I were cracking up at all the people randomly laughing in the movie. This one part, the person said "He's French" and this lady behind us starts cracking up. I thought he said "He flinched" which would definetly not make any sense to laugh at but I can see why someone would laugh at someone's nationality, especially French. But she must of been embaressed after everyone stared at her wondering what species she was. Oh well, there's always somebody that laughs at the French, god damnit I mean GOD I HATE IT ALL!!!! THAT COUNTRY!!! THE ART!!! THE GAY!!! THE LANGUAGE!!! THE ACCENTS!!!! THE HATS!!!! EVERYTHING!!! It's so horrible, it makes me tear sometimes. Ok then after the movies, I slept at Joe's. On the 10th, in the morning, I watched him play with his remote control car and he made me lay down and put a ramp next to me and flew the car right off the ramp soaring above my face. It was scary yet hilarious. This thing was loud and took gas, and it costed a lot of money. So I got to try it, and I'm a born driver... for remote control cars. I turned and stuff, oh it was great you had to be there. I think I hit a tire once or twice. Maybe a stop sign? Ok, so Joe let me borrow T2 so I know what the hell is going on in the third one which I must see very soon.  I left Joe's, then hung out with Laura. Then went to Keith's, played with him, Mike and Donyell??? I'll just say Doop. So me, Keith, Mike and Doop played Wiffel Ball... oh screw this I'll say Don. Then Mike had to go. Us 3 went in the hot tub, played 4 corners and bullshit. I won Bullshit amazingly without ever having to take the BS pile. My last 2 cards were a 5 and 8 and there was 3 of us so obviously that worked out good for me. After a million rounds of 4 corners, Keith and I decided, let's trick Don so we hid behind the tub, when he came up from the water he was like "GUYS? GUYS? UH...WHERE'D YOU GO"... when me and Keith bounced up on the count of 3 and screamed, he opened his eyes really quickly, didn't look at us, looked between us and screamed, it was hilarious. We also went in the pool and then back into the hot tub, the first time was orgasmic. In the pool it was hilarious because we played Around The World and Don was kicking ass. Then another funny thing, I versed Keith in Slugfest and my center fielder ran my himself to the backwall and just kept running into it. Keith slept at my house, we watched T2. On the 11th, today... well yesterday concidering I'm writing this 2 in the morning about. We went back to Keith's, hung out with Steve A. Then I went home because Keith had baseball practice. Then at night Keith and I, without Steve )= (because "he the rat") went to Sports Plus to hang out with some girls. Keith's girls, hehe I sat back, played arcades and got a huge audience by pounding the drums... it was exciting. I think everyone was just so relieved from the guy that played before me, he was old and he played like a 2 year old. He kept hitting the toms and the cymbals. I'm upset because they fucking took away my favorite song, Korn - Blind... well that was the only good song on the thing... or that I know. I sort of know Twisted Sister, I think from Justin but I forget what song they sing. 80's Rock... ok? ACDC, Guns N Roses, good but nothing beats Tool. Ok, so Keith brought me home, I watched the second half of Lord of The Rings with my mom and then I went to bed...well sort of... I wrote in this which took me about 40 minutes. Yep... that's it, the whole 4 days. Tomorrow who knows what I'm doing, some graduation parties, then Ashley's at night?

      Yesterday I hung out with Heaton. Today I got my bass drum head, it's black yo. I also got a three way plug for my light, ac and clock all in one switch which doesn't apply to anyone but me... hehe. I went to the movies with Matt and Jay H. We saw Sinbad... Nicole I was supposed to come but she wasn't allowed to. Then we went to Friendly's, lots of laughs... I wanted to be Santa by paying for my shake and then running away without grabbing the shake but the shake looked too good to be Santa. Woof... I just realized Santa sort of is like Satan... just switch around the N, T and A. This is very general because I have short term memory loss and I can barely remember things I did the day before or even the same day! I'm shot. Tomorrow I'm hangin out with Laura M if she feels better so feel better Laura! haha ok goodnight.

      Woooaaawoooh! Today, I went to the mall, bought the Disturbed CD 'Believe', a Tool shirt along with a disturbing Tool poster with I think Maynard coming out of the water staring up into the sky. I didn't figure out what it was until 3 days after I bought it. So obviously this sentence is an update on this day... I'm actually writing this on the 12th but everything else in this blog is on the 6th except for all the Tool/Matrix shit below, that's just that. Before these 3 days I thought the neck was its messed up face or something... weird. Ok, back to the 6th, when I came home from shopping, Heaton came over, he's still over now and Kaiser is comin' soon. James was gonna' come but he was at Dan B's. Ok, they all left... I'm by myself listening to Tool and reading these lyrics which relate completely to the matrix. One song actually ACTUALLY SAYS "THEY'RE MAKING A DREAM FOR YOU AND ME"... this song was covered by Tool originally by Led Zeppelin...so I think the Wachowski Bros. (Makers of The Matrix) listen to all this great music and put it all together to make on giant bubble of thought and belief.  PLEASE TAKE TIME TO READ THESE (I've made italic of the important shit)   ---Tool - Third Eye (Aenima Album Version) -Bill Hicks: See I think, drugs have some done good things for us. I really do. And if you don't believe drugs have done good things for us. Do me a favor, go home tonight, take all your albums, all your tapes, and all your CDs, and burn them. 'Cause you know what? The musicians who made all that great music that's enhanced your lives throughout the years? Reeeeeeeal fucking high on drugs. Today young men on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration, that we are all one conciousness experiencing itself subjectively,  there is no such thing as death, life is only dream, and we're the imagination of ourselves . Here's Tom with the weather. It's not a war on drugs, it's a war on personal freedom is what it is, okay?. Keep that in mind at all times, thank you.   Dreaming  of that face again.  It's bright and blue and shimmering.  Grinning wide and comforting me with it's three warm and wild eyes.  On my back and  tumbling  down that hole  and back again  rising up and wiping the webs and the dew from my withered eye.   ---Tool - Sweat -  Seems like I've been here before. Seems so familiar. Seems like I'm slipping into a dream within a dream . It's the way you whisper. It drags me under and takes me home.  (I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE = DEJA VU = THE MATRIX.... DREAM WITHIN A DREAM = THE MATRIX   ---Tool - No Quarter (Cover of Led Zep) - Lock the door, kill the light. No one's coming home tonight. The sun beats down and don't you know? All our lives are growing cold, oh... They bring news that must get through.  To build a dream for me and you , oh.  (REAL WORLD WAR, HIDE FROM ROBOTS, THE SUN IS GONE FROM OPERATION DARK STORM, WE WILL DIE OF FROST, THE ROBOTS WILL MAKE THE MATRIX FOR US) I'm sure Led Zeppelin had a completely different meaning for these words but Tool saw it in the same way I see it... related to The Matrix. (=   ---Tool - Spasm - As you stare into the water, are you scared you'll be forgotten? As you stare into the water.  This one made me think for a while and I finally came up with something, it's the last people in the real world seeking true nature and having fear that nature and them won't be with history any longer, for fate is for AI for the rest of Earth's future.   ---Parabola - see the lyrics yourself, they're so intertwined with The Matrix. Also check the lyrics for all the other "Lateralus" songs but definetly check Ticks and Leeches and Lateralus. Ticks and Leeches supposedly speaks about killing the robots. "YOU CHOKE!!!"All these songs are by Tool.  Then there's one song called 'Faaip De Oiad' where some former employee of Area 51 claims aliens are invading and the government knows about it, yet ceases to do anything and to save the people into secret hiding spots but he says the govt. wants the aliens who are "extradimensional" to destroy the major cities so that the govt. has an easier way of controlling very few areas. I believe this is a real transmission from a very frightened man.

       FULL METAL JACKET   Gunnery Sgt Hartman: Where the hell you from anyway private!?   Soldier: Sir! Texas! Sir! General: Texas!? Holy dog shit! Only steers and queers come from Texas, Private Cowboy and you sure don't look like a steer to me, so that kinda narrows it down. General: How tall are you private?   Soldier: Sir! 5 foot 9! Sir! General: 5 foot 9! I didn't know they stacked shit that high, you trying to squeeze an inch on me somewhere huh!?!   Soldier: Sir! No! Sir! General: Are you a Peter Puffer?   Soldier: Sir! No! Sir! General: Bullshit! You can probably suck a golf ball out of a garden hose... Do you suck dicks!?  Soldier: Sir! No! Sir! General: Are you shook up, are you nervous!?   Soldier: Sir! Yes I am! Sir! General: Do I make you nervous!?   Soldier: Sir! General (immediatly after the soldier said 'Sir!'): Sir what!? Were you about to call me an asshole!?   **General Hartman punches Private Cowboy in the stomache**  Oh god, that movie is hilarious. I forgot to mention Chris slept over two nights ago and we watched Full Metal Jacket, I've seen that movie so many times, it gets funnier and funnier each time! The wedding today was boring. And I missed the party in Cornwall...this is definetly the shittiest summer ever.

      July 4th, 2003. A day which will live in infam...woops wrong date. Today was possibly the worst July 4th I've ever experienced. I had to deal with going to my aunt's fiancee's parent's house. Boring as hell so I hung out with my dad. Then I went to my cousins... what a relief. Then again, it wasn't that good either. Katie was all dissapointed because someone died on that date that she knew. It was 8 years ago today, but I think she shouldn't dwell on the past. There's no reason to, live happy for the future. Britt also fought with Katie and the little baby shits were following me around. Especially John John, when I hid in Katie's room to cheer up her and Keeri (don't know how to spell), by popping out of the bed when she told everyone to leave... JOHN JOHN TOLD THEM I WAS HIDING AFTER I TOLD HIM NOT TO!!! So I suffocated the 4 year old. The pool was fun though, especially going under water with goggles while holding a water gun shooting at your cousin heading straight for you, pretending your in the matrix...hehe. Alright now I have to go to bed and pretend to enjoy the worst day ever... tomorrow. My aunt's wedding...it's the same day of the best party of the year. My parent's friend's house upstate, I sware to god it's the best party ever, there's girls, contests, fun.... and a shit load of fun, and girls... and hot girls. AND WE CAN'T GO!!!!! )= Ah wtf, I'll make the best of tomorrow's party concidering IM GOING TO BE THE ONLY ONE THERE MY AGE!!! Everyone is either babies, children or adults.   Oh, getting your father drunk is great, he claimed he layed at 17 year old girl he didn't even know when he was 14. Haha, damn health people didn't find out about STD's yet!!!

      I haven't wrote in a while but I've been around... places, yesterday and today with Matt. We went to his cousin's pool yesterday and he slept over my house, this time, ironically, I was the one that couldn't fall asleep. Today we pranked a few people, fun. I'm so used to going to bed 3 in the morning. Well tonight I'm going to bed in 5 minutes which is 12. Early for me... uh... just before I was at my sister's dance recital. I sat next to my cousin Alexa by ourselves because tickets next to our parents were already sold and we decided to go later on after they purchased the tickets. It was funny, Alexa was so loud, everyone around us was probably so mad at us both. It was so funny though, we were barely paying any attention to the recital the whole time. Oh yea, today me and Kaiser went around the neighborhood with walkie talkies for no good reason and met up at Cheyanne's house. We were going to plan an attack but decided to stay out of trouble. On Monday, I don't think I did anything. Probably hangin out with Keith B tomorrow. Ok Goodnight.

      Today I went to the beach with my cousins, the Troianos. It was crazy fun. What made it so crazy and not so fun was the nudest colony part. We went to the nude beach next to Robert Moses and JESUS THAT WAS GROSS! We were hoping there'd be hot naked GIRL AS IN FUCKING FEMALE teens there but all there were was ugly and fat naked women along with a shit load of gay old men. Good part was we got Chris to get naked for a second and moon the nudests. Ya, so the beach was good, waves sucked though. Then I got home, bought Lord of The Rings: The Two Towers which I'm now watching. Good BYE.

      Well! I'm back from Kentucky...no really. Montauk was ok...it wasn't that exciting because I'm pretty much sick of it, especially the little surfer wankers with the long blonde hair. I kicked some ass in Puff N' Putt Mini Golf. Ya, so the whole time I hung out with Peter. These people have a house, my mom's friend family. So Pete and I met some hot girls the first day, of course me doing all the talking. But we ditched them, well we couldn't hang out with them because we weren't allowed to go into town which was where they were and where we were supposed to meet them. On the last day we met some girl named Kealy, she was cool but we once again never met up again with her but we got her sn! Woot! Ok screw this Montauk talk. Let's talk about Six Flags! Six Flags was crazy, us guys (fathers, my cousin dan and I) were online for All American Scream Machine and right as we were about to go, the whole park shut down. BLACK OUT! Black dudes were cussin' and sewin'...my cousin Jenna's boyfriend Matt was stuck on the ride. Everyone was evacuated, just imagine the people that had to sit in a car for an hour on the top of the crank on Nitro and on a loop on Superman. Ya well many people left but a million people still stayed including us. It sucked because I wasn't feeling good because the day before I ran around 10 miles with Keith without eating anything healthy. 711's SLURPEE MACHINE WAS OUT OF ORDER!!! I was pissed. Ok, so back to Six Flags, we saw this Matrix Lemonade dude...it all started when I decided to ask if the lemonade was real (like homemade) and he said "No the Matrix is telling you it's real" and I said "Hey Dan, he's a believer" and he said, "Psh! Belief"...then he's like..."uh...well...you see...oh god im so random...i just think everyone here hates me....god...its not fair..." Britt, Dan and I are cracking up and he mumbles "i just want somebody to love me." Obviously this guy had major issues. He yelled at Britt for laughing at him. Then he dropped the $5 and he got mad. Then I asked where the straws were and he was like "BOX!" Yea...Nitro definetly was the best ride, nothing beats it. Superman was alright. Ok, enough Six Flags. When I got home from Montauk I hung out with Dan, Pat and Jimmy since forever. We smashed a pink toilet in the sump. Then went to Pat's, watched a bit of Family Guy, then Dan had to go. Jimmy, Pat and I decided to go swimming in the boat on the Nissequage...Keith remember? But it was gone. Thank god it was gone because if it wasn't gone I wouldn't of made contact with my dad and I would of been left home while my parents went to my cousins and I just realized this now. Ok, so we walked to the part thats naked in my neighborhood, getting all ready for new houses, and we checked out the Lion King Tree...and jumped on a huge pile of mulch. Then we went back to my house and saw THE SOPHEMORES...that how you spell it? Ya wait a second, I'm a sophmore...oh well. OK! Paul it would be nice if you stop wearing those gay wife beaters. Well we saw the whole crew, it was Paul, Ricky, their soccer friend, Justin and Shapiro...wanting me to play Ultimate Frisbee but I couldn't because I had to go to my cousins. So I showed Pat and Jimmy the GI Joe thing and a few other things including my new room and TV. After they left, I went to my cousins (the Murphy's)...there we had plain old fun. My dad had to drive out to Amityville just to get his phone back from this black lady who held it on reward...my dad ironically payed to get it back and took it out the easy and nice way. Usually he'd say "DIE NIGGER" and shoot the lady dead smack in the middle of her forehead, then continue to fight off all the other gangstas that come in his way. BACK TO THE COUSINS...ya we washed Katie's car and we all got soaked and in trouble haha. Britt and I also attempted to brush Vinny's (the dog) teeth but he kept biting us and the mitten protection still didn't work. Now I'm home and tired as hell and I'm catching up to all the updates I've missed on all the funny websites. Also talking to people like Heaton...well he's the only person I've had a chance to talk to yet...but I need to talk to a few other people...ANGELICA! haha oh well read me tomorrow night...I think?

      Ok everyone, let's see what I did on the 18th. I basically did nothing in the morning, around 6, I went to Keith's and then we went to Sports Plus which was completely boring because there was nobody there. We saw Garrett Berger, jesus he changed...if you ever see him again because he said he's coming back in 11th, you'll see how he changed. Ok, then I slept at Keith's, I beat Keith up. Hah! Then we woke up obviously...haha I spelt woke up like whoke up but I corrected it. I'm so dumb, either that or my hand slipped. I don't think when I type, my hands go on their own. Anyways, we played Halo, well I played Halo alot, we had some bagels, went in the pool and invented the coolest pool game ever with pool floats, then went in the hot tub. Then the rest was torture as we walked and ran about 10 miles. Originally our destination was Ashley's house from Hauppauge but we had no time because I had to go at 4. We went to 711 (KEITH YOU WON THE BET!) I bet Keith there wasn't a 711 on Jeriko, but I was talking one that was close by, this one was a million miles away but we finally got there. THERE WERE NO DAMN SLURPEES! haha I spelt damn, damb. I'm thinking of dumb...oh god I'm confused. Ok, so we had to go all the way back another way and by the end I was dead. My stomache was killing me. I don't know why, I'm so out of shape these days. We finally arrived back at Keith's and in perfect timing, my mom came a few minutes after we got there. Then I bought the new Alien Ant Farm CD, and then went to the Ducks Game as a family. We had to leave early because tomorrow is SIX FLAGS with my awesome cousins! Then, the next two days I'll be in Montauk with my mom's friend and her family. I'll be back Saturday night probably. And on Sunday I'll probably be hanging out with Pat and Dan since a long time. Good times...I hope it starts again. Ok visitors of this lame site...I have to play with the matrix.com and hack into secret binary hexagramic codes to see secret not yet released trailers of The Matrix Relovutions...ok bye!

      I guess more people read this thingy than I thought concidering people were complaining about me not updating it at all.  Sorry folks for now on I'll try to update it everyday but all I remember is on the 15th I went to Splish Splash with Jared, Paul and Vinny. Mrs. Stahl brought us, then I slept over Jared's. Splish Splash was fucking hilarious. At Jared's, Matt Margraf came over for a bit, and that kid's pretty hilarious. I worked out with Jared's weights. Wait I forgot to mention at Splish Splash how I screwed the tube, ran and surfed town the slides while people yelled "My lord that child is running on the slide!" Oh god, it was so funny. Paul and Jared met some lifeguard, got her number and now their taking a step out of reality. They think their gonna see her again. I guarantee they will never see each other again. Oh well, Vinny and I were dying laughing and doing all this crazy shit at Splish Splash. At night we took a walk, played Knockout and I actually did good, Vinny and I talked about morons of the grade below me, then we all watched Scary Movie 2 and in the morning, Father of The Bride but I didn't get to watch it all because I had to go to my cousin's. I got a haircut, then arrived at my cousin's out east. My 1st cousin and I (Chris) played hide and go seek to hide from our 2nd cousins...or 3rd cousins who aren't even allowed to watch Spongebob. As we were running to hide Chris ran right through the screen door and OH GOD IT WAS THE FUNNIEST THING EVER!!!! Ok I can't fucking wait for Wednesday, I'm going to Six Flags with my kick ass cousins. Today I shopped with momma, then Kaiser and Ravin came over but then Ravin had to go, then we went to Matt's, ate dinner there and I met his cousins. We took 2 bike rides and I showed Matt the 2 new GI Joes on www.ebaumsworld.com. Nothing special, I came home and that's all.  And I'd like to dedicate this blog to very special Amanda Greco who influenced me to write this blog and get me back into the daily typing of this blogger. If it wasn't for you, my life would be a crumbled leaf...or something similiar....crumb cake?

      Last night Paul and Mike slept over. Today we went into town with Ricky. Stuff happened. Paul kept thinking he was a woman god and kept stepping away from reality by trying to "do stuff" with random 18 year old girls. We went back to Ricky's and played Halo. Then everyone seperated. Now I'm tired and I'm just hanging around my house by myself and going to bed early to catch up on a shit load of sleep. Later.

      August 7th and 8th - Painted my room doors, I got my birthday present, A TV! WOO! Along with Minority Report.  August 9th - Wow amazing day. My birthday. There was a block party and my family came over for my birthday, god it was amazing. I hung out with Kate, Britt and Dan the whole time. We went to the block party and made fools of ourselves, or maybe I just did. We went in the moon bounce maze thingy. We beat the crap out of all the kids and Dan Conklin and Gavin got in trouble and kicked out for wrestling in the bounce. The lady said they could of broke the children. Thank you, and they are humans, not machines, or toys for that matter. Anyways, lemme just sum up what happened at the block party, I joined in all the activities and made my cousins laugh by making fun of any wankstas. I made fun of Chris across the street from me who's a wanksta and he said you have no penis. He's going into 8th and he said that. I laughed in his face and slapped up his bitch fo shizzle. My coucins kept laughing at everything I did...it wasn't that funny. Then this bitch yelled at me for joining in the game so I blew the whistle in her ear. Tehe. Ya I blew my cousin's lifeguard whistle a million times. Then I helped out scavenger hunt with the little boys, Lindsay Olsen, Dan Olsen, Nick Conklin and some other girl. Ya, but we didn't win and I had to keep running back and forth. But back at my house, things were really funny...here are some lines.  "Woof Gonzo" and "Cactapuss" - Dan  I'm talking to my sister about blocking the sides of the road with cones and I say "But we don't have cones, that's the problem" and my sister replies with "Well we got ice cream cones?"  "Grandma, if you were to be a superhero, who would you be?" - My Dad under the influence of us kids "Sausage" - Grandma thinking my dad ment a hero you can eat Us dying laughing, I go inside and ask her the real question again... "No but seriously Grandma who would you be?" - Me "Emilia Eirheart" - Grandma    (the first women to fly across the world i think)  Ya it was really funny, we were going to rent Ringu (Japanese version of The Ring, I think Ringu was the original) but we couldn't because adults suck. Ok cya everybody and happy birthday to me!

      August 2nd - Can't remember, I told you I suffer from amnesia...if that's how you spell it. Wait I do remember, Chris slept over and stuff. Fun stuff. We had fun. So it was all fun. Fuck I forgot what happened. All I remember is Chris making me crack up like usual. Good old Christopher.  August 3rd - Paul came home early and fucking surprised me while I was sleeping in my room. Then we biked to Heaton's to do the same. Then we went to Matt's but he wasn't home, he was at his cousins and I'm such an ass I forgot he told me 90 times. Us 3 went to Ricky's and hung out with him all day, played Halo. Paul slept on Ricky's couch because he hadn't slept in 2 days. Mike and Paul slept over. We made a kickass movie, Paul should be putting it online soon...right Paul!?  August 4th - I recorded some funny stuff of me and my sister dead smack in the morning way before Paul and Mike woke up. When everyone woke up, we finished making the movie, Heaton went home without telling us...well he told Paul but not me because I was doing Jackass stunts (crashing into the curb on my scooter and flipping over and smashing my head on the floor) in front of cars down the block to make cars stop and ask if I needed help. Then Paul and I got Ricky to come over and surprise Matt. It worked successfully with Matt confusedly saying "You're home?!" Not any where near reaction as mine...I slapped my face a million times and screamed. Ok, so back to surprising Matt...jesus I almost forgot how to spell surprise. So, Matt could only stay for like an hour, then he had to go to soccer. Then Paul and I hung out with Erin and Courtney at the beach. Erin sat on Paul and Erin started elevated...hmmm I wonder why? Paul put a happy face on my back with sun tan lotion but Erin smudged it all in an hour later! ERIN!!! Haha, ya then Paul and I ate my Dad's kick ass Chili...(Paul and I were beafing up the night) and we slept at Matt's. It was crazy, Matt's older brother Tom had his friend Bryan sleep over. At first it sucked because we had to watch skateboarding movies but then it was great because we watched the Family Guy Season 1 and 2 DVD. Then Paul, Bryan and I couldn't fall asleep until 4. Paul kept saying random words that made Bryan and I crack up. Especially Grandpa Benson or something.   August 5th - We all took a jog...well Thomas, PJ (Baby Kaiser or as Paul says "Germy") and Bryan rode bikes. We all went to 711. Then we got back to Matt's and my back like ripped. Paul kept showing Matt and I Stacy's Mom video from Fountain of Wayne and claiming it the best video ever...so I showed him Zebrahead's Playmate of The Year video. I remember seeing FoW in concert a long time ago with my cousin as an intro to The Smashing Pumpkins. Paul had showed this video to me from the first day he got home. Anyways, my back hurt alot, ruined my day. We all went home. Matt got in big trouble for something that doesn't make any sense or have any relevance to Matt. I feel you Matt, I feel you. I had a fight with my whole family at night over dumb 13 Ghosts about how the guy jumped LONG, not HIGH. I was right, they were wrong. Their so dumb. Oh well...everything's cool now...well now it is the night of the 6th.  August 6th - My back felt the same in the morning but out of nowhere it healed instantly while chatting on the computer. I listened to a shitload of music today. Mowed the lawn without my parents having to tell me. I mowed before they came home and I wore a gas mask for giggles. Tehe...they were all proud of me. Then I beat Splinter Cell before I had to return it. I took a bike ride, drummed a bit, went to Carvel, returned Splinter Cell, went to Baskin Robbins for my sister's ice cream, came home. And that's it. I got a Carvel shake, but their not as good as they used to be. Depressing how teens can't make anything good. We suck haha. Maybe it's just us lazy American teens. At Baskin Robbins my dad parked in the back alley, so I hid under the car seat to hide from any wankstas, god I hate this generation. You can't trust anyone. )= Ah shut up Tom.

      The Revolution hits us 11.05.03  The greatest day of your life, freedom in another world without control. Your world comes crumbling down. Every fortification you ever knew, every mountain, ocean, building, house you knew all fall down. Everyone you know changes appearance, all existence of land itself, gone and a new world awaits. The world will be shut off. It will be something like a huge atomic bomb dropping on us. Get Ready. November 5th, armaggedon as some say it. Be prepared, be prepared for the best. Then after a flash, you will find yourself fighting a revolution in another world and feeling the sweetness of victory and true liberty. You'll understand what this means when the day comes.  Ok, that was corny...in other words NOVEMBER 5TH MATRIX REVOLUTIONS HITS THEATRES!!!  Oh yes, download Story of The Year - Until The Day I Die  It is amazing!

      Jesus, no time for blogger, ok, I gotta start writing in this guy again. Going to Pennsylvania with Paul was awesome. We went white water rafting but before that we camped out at a trailer camp ground. It sucked, no girls...too many spiders. We had a couple of funnies here and there such as...Paul and I were husking the corn and I said "Hey Paul, look I'm corn husk!" and did some random face/pose. You gotta see me do it to understand what it is. Then we tried eating all the marshmallows and I was stuffed with marshmallows and Paul couldn't understand anything I said but "I feel like an oldman...FIRE HYDRANT!" Then there was this device in Paul's trailer that looked just like Mario. At night, we froze to death outside in a tent trying to sleep. We also watched Miss America, god those girls are nasty! Fuck inner beauty, America needs outer physical beauty, but no, soon they'll have 1000 pound women on that show that have the greatest personalities. Sickens me. Phonies. Haha, I'm like Holden from Catcher In The Rye. Their all phonies, life is a big phony. Holden, is gay and whines about everything and cries and "RANTS" (as heaton says) about everything, he's obviously a depressed homosexual. Woah, a little off I got, next morning, Sunday...we had pancakes, then got ready for white water rafting on the Delaware River. On the bus ride there, there were a million kids screaming and yelling...and it made me depressed thinking of the great times of the youth. How awesome was everything when you were around 6. Life couldn't get better, everything was good and you weren't exposed to the FUCKING SHIT WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN! Anyways, back to the water rafting, Paul and I went by ourselves and talked about basically everything you can think of concidering we were in a raft going down a river for about 3 or so hours. Well, we stopped for a few things. First, the funniest thing ever...Paul had to pee, so we took a confidential detour off the path and Paul got up and started peeing standing on the raft...so I thought of the perfect idea who I bet anyone else would of thought of doing...crashing into the side of the river. So I did, and down came Paul, one leg in, one leg out and he pissed all over. Yes, funny...ok so the river reminded me of the Lord of The Rings:Two Towers when the Uruk-Hai are near that river thingy...and the first one I guess. It was cool. Then we met up with Paul's parents and Paul's sister and friend Vicky who came along also. They all went together in one raft. The maximum is 8, minimum obviously being 2 unless you're one of those crazy caiyackers. We saw some, their amazing...and Paul said his 60 year old aunt has lots of form and can go really fast, I thought that was awesome. I think it's because Jewish people live longer. Oh, yes and I forgot to mention I converted to Jeudeisusism...Jewish. We figured my dad was adopted and all, and his real last name is Polish/Yiddish which obviously leads to a path of Jewishness...and plus Jesus is gay...no he's cool and all, I literally mean he's gay, you guys see the paintings of him, he stands like a grade A flamer. Ya so I'm Jewish, all I need is Paul's yamaha...I mean yarmulke...and I'm still celebrating the Catholic holidays. Woohoo! I love taking advantage of Catholisism. SISM...SCHISM! Ok, so where was I...ah yes...lunch, we set out for the river again and this time we found a rope so I decided to fly on it...unfortunetly I ended up head under the water with all my clothes on and Paul dying of laughter in the raft. I did it about 4 times and the last time I jumped into the raft right into Paul. It was great...ok so, that's all basically except we found a $5 at the beginning/end? On the way home, my ego starting going up, because I wasn't near any spiders that were gonna make fun of me. I finished my English essay in the RV, and we went to Wendy's in Syosset...then to friends of the Stoltzes. They were moving and giving everything away so I took a 1970's turntable! WOO! Then depressed again to see my parents and my...old land of greatness, well not really mine, but my parents even though I used to always go there when I used to live in Lindenhurst concidering the very short distance. Uh..ya..good old Plainview, Smithtown sucks, Plainview owns. Nassau owns. Suffolk sucks. Well except the most western part of Suffolk such as LINDENHURST!!! When I arrived home, the weirdest thing ever...there was a bunny in my house caged in my kitchen. My sister's bday present even though she's not turning 8 till the 27th. Oh well, that was a cool suprise. Nothing else, went to bed. NEXT DAY...today, school, nothing except good old AP Euro teacher, Mr. Ferrante gave us an example of a feared ruler in Machiavelli's eyes, so he opens thedoor and screams "AND DON'T COME BACK UNTIL YOU FINISH YOUR HOMEWORK!!!" Now this guy sounded serious it wasn't even funny...well it was hilarious, you know what I mean, but he screamed so that the whole school can hear him. So he comes back in and then a teacher comes in confused when seeing us all crack up along with Mr. Ferrante. It's always great to see AJ's face...he can make your day a happy one. Then home, nothing but drumming, petting rabbit, homework, tv, counter-strike, and working out at Paul's. OK! SO THAT'S ALL FOLKS! GOD DAM THAT WAS LONG...

      Thursday, nothing really happened...just school of course. Yesterday was great. At lunch, James spotted Amro walking by so he sang his "SN" anthem. If you can't figure out what sn stands for, good, because it's very racial. BUT HILARIOUS. So, when I got home from school, I went out with my mom to buy the AEnima cd (Tool) which I had broken my old one WHICH IS ANCIENT! AND IT'S MY FAVORITE CD! Ok, so it took us 3 stores considering the one we went to the other day (Borders) after eating at Outback. Anyways, I finally found it in Circuit City. It was so great, in FYE, the guy pronounced it ONEMA...oh god I wanted to laugh in his face and then spit on him. Ok, so at night I went to Keith's and we had fun in this base he made, fort, base, whateva! God I'm dying to be Jewish, Mel Brooks is my Jewish hero. Then at the game and I hung out with numerous amount of people. Then I got slapped by this kid Tyler in 9th because I was wearing a ripped open kick ball on my head pretending to be Davy Crockett. Little wankster, if I see him again I'll probably fight him. Thing is, he might have his friends and shit and knifes, you know wankstas, they're pussies. Well the 9th graders are. I know alot of cool sophmore wankstas, so I guess their not wankstas...they're just people. Well what is the true definition of wanksta? Are wankstas the cool ghetto kids or gay ones? OR BOTH!? To me wankstas are the fags/pussies. Anyways, I really didn't wanna fight because I would have crushed this kid in two seconds and he backed away from me. Everyone was egging me on, but you know, I just couldn't. I would of gotten in trouble and shit...ya know. And he would have gotten his older brother (so I hear he has) after me...complete gayness. So screw it, next time, he does shit like that to me again, his face will be on the ground, against the concrete, out for the night. Ok, then I watched the game with other people. Then I went to the Murphy's, my cousins. Hung out with Britt, played THPS4. My sister claimed she can ride faster by pressing start and then continue...haha that's definetly going to help. Today, I got new tom heads for my drum set. Then, I worked out with Paul, great work out. Then around 8, Chris M came over and is sleeping over. Right now we're both watching Austin Powers...and it's 2:30 PM so goodnight.

      Yes, lunch detention. I love it...if it wasn't me. )= I got lunch detention from Ms. Kalabza for whispering to Brendan yesterday ABOUT MUSIC and NOBODY COULD HEAR ME! She just saw my mouth move. Wow, anyways lunch detention wasn't that bad because we got to, yes we, many people get it every day. Actually only one person got it today. Anyways, we got to watch all the saxists audition and they were all like comedians except Paul, he was the only serious one. Rob Haber said "My mom is a cheap Jew, she buys these $1 reeds right to Ms. Kalabza's face! AND HE DOESN'T GET IT TROUBLE!? I quit life. It's too confusing. Oh, well...at least it's over with. Rob also farted alot, he even told Ms. Kalabza he farts when he's nervous. Uh, yea school sucked today. Wait, no, scratch that...English was a killer...for your mouth and stomache, the whole class was dying laughing. There was a sub, and he used a potium and we got to get our textbooks and when we came back he put on some dvd that taught kids how to eat lunch properly. The movie was from like 1930 something, it was crazy. We were all dying of laughter, not knowing what the hell it was for, not even the teacher knew. Turns out he didn't read the part of the note from Ms. B that said we were supposed to watch a different thing on the dvd. We all that it was Ms. B's punishment to us for making fun of Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails...NIN, NINE...moon ninny? That was in my dad's hand held dictionary. I remember all the funny words we looked at when I was around 5, oh good times. The tape had this puppet named Mr. Bungle that was doing all the wrong things and the guy must of said a million times, PHIL SURE ISN'T A MR. BUNGLE. Phil was this little kid that did everything right and used a gallon of soap to wash his hands. God, it was pretty torturous yet hilarious. Ok, enough school, what happened after school? NOTHING. Just went to Cornett, and I broke my favorite cd, my Tool AEnima cd but I'm going out soon to get a new one with my babysitting money! w00t. Also, I'm going out to dinner, and I have to work out with Paul, and I haven't even started my homework yet, well a bit of math but that's it. I'm doomed! Mwuahahaha. Bye.

      Today, nothing happened except English we watched some shit on Nine Inch Nails and for hw we have to do a report about them, it's so confusing! Lunch, James made me spit out my drink by making a funny face. Today I babysat Mike and Chris. Easy. I just realized my journal entries keep getting shorter as school progresses, maybe because it's THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN. Wow, 9 months, I've been doing this thing, I can't wait for the 1 year anniversary! Paul was going to come over but I had too much homework. Ok read me tomorrow!

      Welcome everyone...absolutely nothing happened today. Except I made my lunch table throw up their food because they needed to laugh at what I said. We make fun of James' girlfriend because she looks like she's 2 so people are saying "Where is she?," and James says "She takes 10 minutes to get here." Then I replied with "That's because she has to come all the way from Smithtown Elementary. Paul almost spit out everything in his mouth. The whole table loves how I laugh different ways, all the different variations of laughter. You probably all think, stop talking so much about yourself...what do you think this is for? To talk about other's lifes? Nine! MINE! Ok, well I'm gonna work out tonight with Paul, and drum...well I drum everyday. Later.

      Bush shouldn't have to address our nation at least 3 times every year. It's all about the negatives, you never hear any positive events in the newspaper. It seems the only good news is the sports section or the memorials and recoveries of past horrible events such as 9/11. I'm sick of war, but not only in the fields, but in the streets also, upon ourselves. Damnit you wanksters, save your money, leave those clothes you wear to act cool for the fools who are in the real gangs, the ones to be shot by cops until their brains are spattered all over the roads, blood fill our cities. Mothers killing children. Drive by shootings, terrorism just keeps flowing, innocent people are victims of these random murders. Does any of it make any sense? You have to ask yourself, "where is the love?"

      Ok Blurty didn't work out, it's a piece of shit. So I'm paisting all the recent Blurty's onto here...here it goes.   Sunday, September 7th, 2003  Subject: Homework. Time: 2:47 pm. Mood:  bored. Music: POD - Set Your Eyes To Zion.  All today was was a bunch of homework. PERIOD. Just homework, eating. BORING. Yep, its 2:33 right now, tonight I have to work out with Paul, don't laugh! That picture of me is me not flexing, soon I'll have a pic of me FLEXING! I'm so skinny so I look like I'm Arnold Shwartzeneiger. My muscles pop out big time, you gotta see it. As soon as Paul sends the pic to me you all will see Mr. Muscoli! Ok, forget about the muscles, god I'm so depressed it's Sunday and tomorrow there's school again. I hate school, more than anyone else because I like being free and not held captive in a shithole such as school where it takes 5 fuckin days for you to change a class because the office has a bunch of retards that can't do anything right! That's all, later everyone. Oh wait no! I got a job! I get to babysit every Tuesday and Thursday at my sort of neighbor's house, the Dimotsis'. Their house occupies two little wankers at the age of I think 9 and 10. But their insanely wild, but I'm friends with them so it shouldn't be hard. I get payed about 7 bucks an hour, well I will get payed, so it's pretty awesome. I finally am making some MONEY! Ok later.    Saturday, September 6th, 2003  Subject: Good Old Aflac Time: 10:54 pm. Mood:  cheerful. Music: Limp Bizkit - Eat You Alive.  Oh good old Aflac to finish off the night. But first let me explain what happened yesterday in school. In English, Mcloughlin and I were dying the whole class. This teacher gets funnier and funnier every day, not her, her voice. She sounds so nervous. It's so great. Then she made us get into groups and have one person describe a picture to 2 other people and the people had to draw what it was without seeing the picture, only by me telling them what to draw. But she said no body language so I did a pelvic thrust in my seat when she wasn't looking, heh funny? Then Kevin and I were dying laughing when this one kid drew a star who's face was all stoned looking, his eyes were like horizontal lines and same with his mouth, it was so great. Ya English is awesome. There's alot of quiet people in my classes, it's so fuckin' depressing. Then in AP Euro, Ferrante had to get all our names right and the only name he remembered right off the bat was O'CONNOR! He called Ruby, Rubystone. Also, he said Jack Geiger, ah yes, Geiger Counter. Some girls told Mr. Ferrante to remember Grimaldi by mold, which depressed me...I don't want to be mold. But eh, what the hell? I might be better off decomposed. Of course the grand of the day, lunch. Where we all died of laughter again. This time it was more laughing than ever and Ryan G made me spit out my Yoo-Hoo. Their objective is to make me laugh and spit out my drink. I have a feeling I'm going to be spitting out alot this year. Uh...nothing else in school really. At night, I worked out with Paul, and Kaiser and Joe Bennett was there. Then I was supposed to go to the movies with Jay Hoffman but no girls could go. Then Keith invited me over to sleep over. We played Ghost Recon: Island Thunder non stop. Game is off thaaa hook. Then next day we basically rode into town, bought a shit load of Red Bull and it seriously doesn't work. We saw these dudes, those little kids I told you are punks that like starting fights, one of them had a low rider bike thingy that's in the gay good charlotte video. Notice I don't capitalize good charlotte, they're not good enough for capitals, only God is or Jesus, and Tool. Like you mention Jesus, you say, What a great man He was. Haha it was so funny, Keith goes, "Tom this bridge can only hold up to 10 tons, Tom you can't come on this bridge." around 4 where Steve, Keith, Mike and I went to the field hockey game. Keith met Rachel there. They did stuff together. I ignored them the whole time and played with those wacky 11th grade boys, ya know, my crew...Pat and Dan and Jimmy and Eric, and Chris Corby and his French friend named Cuntan but I liked crueton better so I called him crueton. Gavin and some other kid was there too. We played ultimate frisbee. It was so great Chris goes, "Is that Eric? Wait, no...that's 3 women." Then the boys had to go, and I was alone with Keith and his girls...and Mike too. Not that hanging with Keith and Mike is bad. Just it was boring as hell. But it was good because I watched Mike float in mid air and he taught me how to float sideways against poles. It's so cool. Ok, then I went back to Keith's, then home, then nothing, back to Aflac, Brian from Boston reminded me of him. Oh yes, he's close to god. Ok later.    Thursday, September 4th, 2003  Subject: Damn Bus! Time: 6:43 pm. Mood:  pessimistic. Music: Tool - Hush and Alien Ant Farm - These Days.  Ok this sucks, I miss the bus the second day of school because the old fucker comes 20 minutes early. I'm ready to blow this guy's head off with a shotgun, Ryan C and I both wanna kill him. He's crazy and doesn't know what the hell he's doing and looks like Nigel Powers from the side. Anyways, my mom drove me and the whole day went by so slow. I'm so damn exausted and it's only the second day of school. I'm sick of it, I hate it, I wanna be free! Fuck this all, what's the fuckin' sense of school, so we can grow up being smart geeks so we can build machines that will one day conquer us? I mean seriously, all this shit we learn is useless, except war class, Dan C told me about it, I'm definetly doing that next year. I'm just so sick of it, why is school the law? And what the hell, how do people expect others to figure out how to work this fucker. God damnit they even said send us something sexy! Gay homos on their knees beggin' for more. I have this dumb map I gotta completely detailize for AP Euro. I think I should drop out with Tim R. Lunch was the only great part of the day, oh yea checking out that Maggio girl in Math is great too. In lunch I sat with Heaton, Paul, Kyle M, and Ryan G. We basically made each other die of laughter the whole time. I made James spit out his drink right next to his girlfriend. I said go make out with your flanket. Flanket, came from me thinking James said flanket when he really said wanket. Don't ask wtf it means. I can't wait for tomorrow's lunch. I miss the times with Joe Mattia, Nick C and Paul in science. It's all gone...but our best years are yet to come...I hope. Another thing, what the hell's the sense of school if you grow up and you're rich but you have an impossible job and your miserable the rest of your life. Think about it, what's the sense of school, it's basically blinding us from the best years of our lives. After school, nothing's fun anymore and your just living. Right now, I want to set a couple of C4 charges in every high school in the US!!! Wow...I just typed a shitload of cruel stuff...but I deleted it, it might have offended many people's beliefs so I decided to get rid of it. But the main subject was, fuck authority, fuck god, fuck superiority, why the hell are we here, and who is in control of us? I don't believe it's god, there's a superior race living in a world completely different, with obvious answers, where maybe time doesn't even exist. Where freedom rains upon them all. We are rats in a jail, and there's nothing anyone can do about it. Sorry if I depressed you, my mood is pessimistic so I'm insulting and critizing everything. Ok tomorrow I'll probably be back to happy, I mean right now I'm not depressed, just too into thought like usual. Ok bye.    Wednesday, September 3rd, 2003  Subject: First Day of School Time: 4:04 pm. Mood:  happy. Music: Billy Talent - Try Honesty.  Ok, it wasn't at bad as I thought it would be. In fact, I sort of liked it, ya know seeing all these faces and stuff. Much more exciting than the summer in some ways. In other ways, no. Oh well, there's nothing we can do about it, we just have to deal with school whether we like it or not. So first things first, if you wanna read my past journal go to www.tommygoo.blogspot.com. That's where the old stuff is at. Now back to school. Jesus christ the bus was packed to the very last seat. I sat with Jason Chierchi (right spelling?) and Paul sat with Laura Jean. It sucked how many freshman were invading our bus. So we got to school, in the homeroom, nothing special happened. 1st period, awesome Italian teacher, Mrs. Tifi...something. Anyways she's awesome. 2nd period, I have Ms. Baino or something, she looks like she's from The Simpsons and it's her first year here so she sweats and sounds really nervous when she talks to the point where she sounds like she's about to burst out crying. 3rd period, I have AP Euro with Matthew Kaizor, some teacher named Mr. Ferrante, Jimmy Smith told me he was awesome so I guess I'm set. O'Connor was raising the roof in that class. Who else, ah yes, Hunsucker and Geiger. 4th period sucked, I had to go to the FC for Studio In Media Arts, this class looks ok but I'd rather do Film Making and Chef's Choice II which I think I'm gonna change to tonight if I can. Plus, there's all these freshman I don't know in that class. 5th period and 6th, Biology with Mrs. Laird, she's awesome. Then the day starts to get good as I enter the G Cafe at 7th period with Paul Stoltz, Mike Heaton, James Desimone, John Donlan, Chris Fletcher, Keith Buckheit and Steve Asti. Tomorrow I'll be sitting with the jock dudes, where Keith and Steve are sitting. Thank god Paul, Heaton, Keith and Steve are there. This lunch should be interesting. Plus, we're all gonna hop around to different cafes. Now this is the best period of the day besides lunch, 8th period, Math, Mr. Lynch. I got Schreck, some hot girls including Nicole Indelicato and Marissa Porcello, AJ ZENNY, Stevo but then I got two seats away from me...the scariest thing ever...Keith Fitzgibbons. Thank you Mr. Lynch, haha I heard this teacher is awesome so I'm going to show alot of respect for this guy. See teachers don't understand if they want respect, they gotta be nice to their kids. All of my teachers are nice so far...let's see how it turns out in a few months. Finally I have Ms. Kallabza for 9th period Concert Band. I saw Nelson for the first time since last year, that was pretty cool. I also saw Winksi. Uh...and Paul and Matt I basically hung out with. Bus ride home was cool, not many people thanks to sports. And uh...now I'm here, finishing all these papers, going to the store soon for school supplies of course, and then I'm gonna make some kick ass homemade cookies with my mom. Hopefully I can get her to get me a different class than Studio In Media Arts. My social life is starting again, as goes for many others. In the summer, there's nothing to talk about and nobody is talking, now everyone is talking, it's cool and makes me happy. I'm a happy boy. I'm very happy. Watch 2 days from now, I HATE SCHOOL!!! Haha hopefully school treats me good. Ok later. Oh and since the current music doesn't give you much space to put anything, I've been listening to alot of Rush, then I listen to Thin Lizzy - The Boys Are Back In Town, Mr. Roboto and Renegade by Styx thanks to Dan, a shit load of Led Zeppelin, you know all the rock there is basically. But of course I've been listening to TOOL the most.

      Went to Angelica's in the morning, I'm confused...last night she said she dumped Rocco, now she said she didn't. I'm fucking confused. I hate this. I'm sick of it, life's so confusing, I just wanna throw a girl onto a trampoline or something...because that's ultimate torture...right. Ya I quit girls, well no I'm not turning gay, I'm just saying they're too complicated and confusing and I can't handle it, so whatever happens happens, I'm sick of them all, they never make plans with you, they never care, they just sit around like lazy bums...mwuahahaha! Guys are awesome. Ok so some girls aren't lazy and don't LIE all the time saying their gonna dump someone for you and then never do it. Try being true to your word! hahaha holy crap so I rode all that way and I don't even get a kiss. Ok, then I had to leave because her brother was about to find out I was there so out I went through the window, oh ya nobody tell anyone or my parents I did this because my dad thought I was just "biking" so I went out the window and ran for it, dodging lassy as he bit my leg. Then on my way home I found Paul and his mom at the post office. So that was my excuse for being out so long, which contributes to the whole "I NEED A CELLPHONE DAD" issue. Yea I'm getting one soon so my parents don't always have to worry. The ride there was long, the ride back was hilariously short, for now on I'm taking the mainroads, it's so much faster...so this dude on the way there was crossing 347 while I was thank god, I would be so scared doing it on my own. Maybe it was god disguised in a mexican biker suit. Ya maybe if he wasn't there, I would have died! Yes! So, I hung out with Paul and went to Supercuts, saw Crystal at Country Kitchen, saw Mrs. Michaelis and the girls at Eckerd and on the way home, people sat on the seat while I biked...yes very gay but time benefits as well. God, it was so scary knowing that if I backed my butt just an inch, I would have been officially raped by Paul. Then Paul and I ate at my house, then went to Paul's where Paul had to go to soccer so I spent my time talking to Mrs. Stoltz, World's #1 Therapist, no really, she's awesome. It was about my whole "OCD" and "ADD" problems. Ya, I think I think it helped alot. So I'm home now, and I'm shakin' my tail leaf...or whatever it's called. My cousin just gave me news that Angelica doesn't like me and that it's a whole fuckin' lie. Who knows, you know what! I DON'T CARE! It's just to confusing to deal with so I'm just ignoring it and pretending she likes me because she's basically the hottest I can get. You heard of chick magnets right? well I'm Mr. Chick Repeller...comes with free washing detergent with your second purchase of Mr. Chick Repeller (Made by The Man Himself {Copyrighted 1923}). Oh goody my dad's home now so I'm gonna be on my way of enjoying the last night of freedom before school and uh...I'll be making cookies with Paul, isn't that fucking sweet, you gotta add the fucking, sorry I'm really hyper right now! WOOHOO! Woof Biff! Haha nobody knows what that means except Dan, Pat, Jimmy, and I. Silly sister of mine. Ok, so cooking cookies and that's it, oh I gotta drum now. Later BOOOYYYZZZZ, see ya'll in the s to the c to the h to the double o...you know what screw that, too long, cya people in school. Good luck to all Freshman on your first year in the bighouse...well smallhouse for now, next year starts bighouse. Goodluck Britt and Kate, study hard, get great grades because these are the grades that depend on where you go in the future!  Yes let's all say goodbye to this dumb Blogger V2.0 and introduce the new Blurty XL 6200...or just Blurty. But don't worry, I'll still have this site's link on my blurty page. I figured, new school year, cooler and better and newer journal hizouse. Ok bye.

      For the past few days I've been going to the carnival lately. I hung out with Chris M. Mostly Paul and Heaton though, a little bit of Matt. Yesterday I hung out with Paul, Heaton and Ricky. We played home run derby all day. Paul and I hit it over the fence! Woo! I hit it over twice, he did it 3 times, then Paul pitched it to me and I hit the ball only holding the bat with one arm, and it was close to a homerun, it hit the fence! I should hit with one hand for now on. Then we went to the carnival in the day and Ricky and I wore the Stan (South Park) mask and everyone was laughing, except the babies, they were crying. Ricky and also danced on the dance floor with it on. Then we went to Ricky's where I was immitating James in order to piss of Heaton to the point where he started throwing Paul across the room just to get to me. He did Paul more damage than he did to me, in fact he did NO DAMAGE to me. (= Lucky Thomas. We all played Halo with Xbox Live and we all sucked ass. Well we won one game but that's it, all those people are GAME FREAKS! Then at night, Ricky, Paul and I went to the carnival. When Paul and I saw this dumb girl that used to be on our bus, and if you have been a GOO BLOGGER READER for a time now, you'll know Amanda Hacket. When she passed by with her friend, I screamed "AMANDA HACKET!!!" in the "Buddy Wacket Chris Farley voice." It was so great, she turned around and stared at nothing like a stoned retard even though I didn't see her turn around, Paul did, if I turned around she would have known it was me. Maybe she thought it was Paul...oh well. We saw some girls including Erin and Courtney (Did I spell that right?)...haha funny I just wrote write instead of right in the Did I spell that right? thingy. But I fixed it, silly me. Oh, anyways, I spent most my time spying on Ricky and Erin who were smoochin in the woods. Then they found me under the truck and Erin screamed, "THOMAS I HATE YOU!"...god it was hilarious. Then I snuck back and found them again! I showed them Erin's frog Paul and I had decapitated the head from pulling and tugging. Courtney and I had asked the dude at the shooting range if he could post the frog on the line so we could shoot it. He said no obviously, dam gypsies. They're so damn good at taking your money, but that doesn't work with me, I scream out in a funny voice, I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY! and that's all there is too it. Then you wave your arm at them meaning like FUCK OFF and you go ARRRFF. Ok, so anyways, Sorry Erin, your frog will forever be remembered in our hearts and butts. Ok, then finally Courtney, Paul and I went to find them and they werent there so Erin called Courtney and that's how we found them. Then they kissed again in the public for one last great kiss but short, tehe. Ok, so we all said our goodbyes and went our different ways...no that sounds too depressing, we all went home. On our walk home (Ricky, Paul and I) took all the stuffing out of the frog. Then I was going to sleep at Ricky's but my dad wouldn't let me. OK, next day, today...I did nothing because I cancelled all my plans for Angelica but in the end we couldn't even hang out)= so I'm seeing her tomorrow. I love you Angelica, ya we're going out now....ULTRA (=!!! And does anyone realize my proper English? Ya that's from listening to my grandma. She taught me the someone, someone and I thing. And one more thing, when school starts, I'll be updating this foo every day. Hey what's Foo Fighters mean? Like Fool Fighters??? I just thought of that, oh well the world may never know. OK BYE.

      Big band practice today. It was fun, check out the band's site on my profile to see what happened. Basically it was just the band and Jimmy and Chris. Nobody else came, but it was lots of fun and we finally made an original. Can't Stop is so much fun to play, we all love it. After band practice, I went out to dinner with my family and grandma to Iorio's in Hauppauge which is right near my Grandma's home. Iorio's sucks, it used to be Giordano's which was awesome. The waitress forgot to get me another coke. My cousins live like half a mile away from my grandma and it's weird, they live in Hauppauge yet they go to SHS. Weirded out. Now I'm home, with homework done, and I'm watching some TV, then sleepin. ZZ Top Goodnight.  Take a break.exe... enter, ahhh hello my winged friend...I'm gonna go watch that Take A Brake program, you know you can download it on the site, Heaton taught me how, it's actually really relaxing. If you haven't a clue what I'm talking about, just friggin' im me.

      Today I hung out with Heaton all day basically doing nothing but watching The Matrix. Then at night, I went to the Hauppauge football game with paul because Kate made me go. It was actually really funny having Ashley massage me in the middle of the field (not the football field) with me on the ground and her giving me orgasms...ok that's enough. It was fun. I basically screwed Paul, Kira, Jess and some other girls and hung out with Ashley, Kate and Marissa. We just roamed around basically and all...and when I got home, my Chris my cousin was over (well he was here before I left to the game also) and we watched the Yankees lose. )= Then played some Star Wars on gamecube...the new game called Rebel Strike and then I asked out Ashley. She said yes! Woo! I love you Ashley. Ok that's it bye.

      I reserved tickets for The Matrix Revolutions...and um...Yanks aren't doing too good, and I had to play a drum solo in front of the whole band and I got an A! Awesome. Today was probably the most funniest yet scariest (drum solo) day of my life. In AP Euro, Jared Liggin sits in a desk which completely collapses on him. It was right in the beginning of the period before the 2nd bell rang and nobody really saw the whole thing but me. It was amazing, he went down slowly and was like "aaah" in a really calm relaxed voice. Then he was on the ground smiling with all lady teachers asking if he was ok. It was probably Mr. Ferrante (our AP Euro teacher) who took the bolts out and wasn't in class that day. I had a shitload of tests today but over the weekend...no homework! YEA! After school I watched Weird Science with Paul. Then Heaton, Paul and I went to Smithtown Idol hoping to laugh at all the people but they were too good to laugh at. Heaton and I got bored so we went to the back of the auditorium and ran up and down the stairs. Now Heaton's sleeping over and we're gonna watch The Matrix Reloaded again. All night Heaton and I have been saying "stack em to the heavens" and "what more could they want!" That was hilarious, that and...seeing Red Dragon half way through having no clue what the hell it's about, and all the sudden seeing an old man fly down a road in a wheel chair completely engulfed in flames. I haven't seen Heaton laugh that hard before. He was on the ground laughing. Ah yes, Bin Bin Chi = BBC! LATEX.

      Today...I had to babysit, I made an agreement that I only have to work 1 day a week now so that's alot better and I still get paid, just not as much. After babysitting I finished my homework, one assignment was to read the newspaper, that was torture, especially reading about the people who died, that was just horrible...you know the "oBITCHaries" or whatever. Then I had to go the orthodontist where I found out my braces are coming off the 24th!(=...of November.)= Eh, just a month away. Jesus I can't wait to see Matrix Revolutions, it's gonna be grand, there's one part where some city gets engulfed in a huge waterful explosion nuclear bomb thing. It's beautiful. Chinese food for dinner, that was good stuff, then I drummed for a few hours, now I'm here...now I'm here, look around around around around...you don't see you don't see, now im here, now im there. Great song. Queen. Ok the new homestar malloween isn't working on my computer. That's upsetting. I listened to a lot of Rush today. That's basically it, the game was rained out. Bye.

      Nothing today really, just spent half the afternoon making the SSM website...and uh in school my pens were stolen again, but this time in gym. I wanna put a gun thingy in my backpack so every time someone tries to steal something from it, they'll find their head across the room. Uh...damnit this afternoon sucked. I spent most of it drumming also. I didn't do so good today because I'm so god damn tired from going to hell everyday. They should rename school to SHIT or HELL or PLACE THAT SUCKS ASS...PTSA...haha PSAT...nevermind. Now I'm studing AP Euro, fun, lots of fun. I know it all, it's too easy. Ok later people.

      Yesterday I had to cancel a quadrillion plans because I had to go to the dentist, then haircut, then all these other places, including a costume store, then home for a while. I then had to mow the entire front and back. Then I went to my cousin's to watch the game. Today was the Spooner Street Mafia's 3rd band practice. It was awesome. We played Can't Stop from Red Hot Chili Peppers. It turned out great. We also attempted to play Real Big Fish - Take On me but it didn't work out too well. After the practice, I basically just ate dinner, played more drums, did homework, watched The Matrix Reloaded special features, actually played Gamecube, I'm sick of that system, then checked the Yankees score... 4-0..woop! Then...well now I'm reading "A Seperate Piece." What a horrible book! Uh...ya that's all. Life is too boring, I wanna get older so I can drink beer all the time like my dad does, get a tattoo, and get a girlfriend...well I can get one now, it's just, I'm ugly now...I'm guesing I'll get good looking when I'm an adult because they always say the ugly people in your high school end up being the super sexy models! I hope it's true for my case. LATUH.     >helpme.exe

      Yesterday...I babysat and got Mike's soccer ball stuck in his tree so I hope I get fired now. Please, PRAY TO GOD. I hate babysitting, it's for women, not for guys, we guys don't know how to watch kids and tell them what to do. Holy shit, the yankee game was amazing. Thank god for Aaron Boone or as the retarded comentator said, "Congradulations for Brett Boone!" Asshole. Today I hung out with Heaton. Today in school, in band lessons I got an A+ on some site reading shit when everyone else failed...amazing. I was shocked. Ms. Kalabza probably was impressed. Hopefully I make it to SYMPHONIC BAND!!! Anyways, I got Matrix Reloaded today in the mail, Heaton and I watched it. Heaton just left like 20 minutes ago. That's it basically, I was gonna go to the game but my dad didn't let me. OK bye.

      Um...let's see nothing really. I should be getting my Matrix Reloaded DVD soon. And uh...that's it. Gotta get new binders concidering my 1" floppy binders are breaking on me. I was supposed to get a haircut but had no time, there's always tomorrow but tomorrow I gotta watch the damn wankstas. Oh how I hate to babysit, it's definetly not a man's job. I want to quit, I already got like $100, I don't need anymore. It's not worth it, it's a pain in the ass. Anyways, the god damn Yankees lost, they were so close to winning until the end. God, I hate Red Sox, I hope Paul Stoltz gets shot in the leg or something tomorrow because he says he's gonna wear all Red Sox clothes. What a fagget Jew. Ok, Yanks better win tomorrow night or else...or else...I'm bombing Paul...with elephants...wearing skii masks...in the dark. Bye.

      This weekend was awesome. Yesterday, Dan, Pat, Jim and I were in town to fix Pat's bass at Cornet, then passing the new Chinese painting antique shop when a voice came out of no where. We thought it was the Chinese guy but it was... AHMAD! Then on our walk home we found Malerie and Gavin. We went back to Pat's, then to Chris' and Quentan was the only one home so we bbq'd and watched funny stuff on the computer like Farting Preacher, FARTY MARTY II, FART HARDER. We also painted over Jimmy's name on Chris' steps. When Jimmy found out we all hid. I came down to see and Jimmy was just standing there breathing very hard with the most serious face, staring at the stairs. Then I said "Why did they do that?" Then Jimmy said "I dunno...maybe because I'm annoying." Then Jimmy left so I started painting over it...hehe. Then Ahmad and I forgot who else popped out of no where and was hiding. They held in their laughs watching Jimmy breath hard for 5 minutes. Then Mrs. Corby came home and everyone hid except for Gavin, Malerie, and me. Then when she came in the room again, we switched. Then I was hiding behind the door and when she came to it, I got all weird feeling and...EWWW YOUR WEIRD. Then we left Chris' and went back to my house. Eric, Ahmad and Jimmy had to go. Pat's sister and her cousin and Dan's brother Nicky came to see our Spooner Street Mafia practice. It was fun. We played many a song. At night, Chris slept over while I babysat Mike and Chris D, and Dan and Gavin snuck over. Alison thought Gavin's name was Captain. We beat up Mike and he started histerically crying and going psycho and he attempted to leave so we stole his key. Then we were nice to him so he forgot all about it and by the end of the night they didn't want to leave. Today, same thing, SSM was over. We jammed and Chris Corby came over with his sax and we started jammin with some Reel Big Fish - Take On Me...but it didn't work too good. After that we beet up Pat in a million layers of clothing, unfortunetly Eric had to leave early and missed it. You see, last year as a tradition, Eric and I have to wrap Pat in 100 layers of clothing and then beat the shit out of him. At night I went to a gay haunted house thing at Sports Plus with Keith, Matt and Hauppaugian girls name Jess, Kira, Nicole, and...uh...some other girl. The haunted house was lame, so I'm too lame to talk about it. Except for construction worker and the jail guy behind bars were both black...subliminal messaging through the haunted house. Then I started conversation with this dude with a hunch back and I said "I like you man," and he said "Woman." Yes...I'm starting to talk about it now so let's stop. I saw Angelica there, and my cousin's friend Lupo. That's an awesome name. I think I mentioned him a long time ago in this blogger. Some time in the summer I think it was. Why don't you go check. God damn, I miss the summer so badly. Fuckin school, I'm gonna keep "Fuck School" on my profile all throughout the school year. Oh yes, Mike, the kid I was babysitting said he knows a huge kid in his grade (6th grade) that's name is Jake Smith. That was an awesome shock. Ok, it's done now. Leave...I just got home from my cousin's house (Murphy's), the game was cancelled...it's done now. Done now. Now. Bye.

      Yep, it was definetly OConnor. I asked him if he gave a shit if I had bad stuff in my blogger and he said "No I'm sure whoever reported Heaton doesn't care." What a load of bullshit, I'm 100% sure it was him. Ok this morning I didn't wake up until 7:30 because there was the pep rally and school didn't start until 8:15 or something, Dan C drove me. In English I got an F on a quiz for accidently calling out. Woops. I had a huge headache today starting at the end of 7th period. Then I started saying "gay" and "fag" alot and Heaton told me to stop saying it concidering the Gay Alliance will beat the shit outa you... I stood up and screamed "COME ON, BRING EM TO ME, BRING ME A WHOLE GAY ARMY, I'LL TAKE THEM ON SINGLE HANDED, HEADSTRONG I'LL TAKE GAYS ON!" I think my head starting hurting because I yelled alot, but I always do that in lunch, maybe it was something I ate. THE SPICEY CHICKEN IS DEADLY. "The spicey chicken is pretty good." - Huge lunch lady that has a extremely low voice. Ryan G always cracks up when I do that impression of her. Nothing else happened in school. Now I'm home, relaxing, reading a bit of Nintendo Power, chatting on the compy, and I have no clue what's going on tonight. My mom and sister just left for a night and morning Brownies trip to sleep at the aquarium...don't ask, I wouldn't be surprised if the tanks broke and they drowned. Ok, that's basically everything, bye.

      Well Thomas is back and kickin! Ok...uh...Today was very depressing. Dealing with the gay/lesbian orientation was a pain in the ass. Learning Jesus' last name isn't Christ, that's just his "Holy Position." Haha Amanda. Lunch, I found out someone had told the principal on Heaton for having bad stuff in his blogger. Originally this blog was full of evil stuff but for now on, I'm going to be nice in my blogger, until I find out who this reporter is and ask him if he cares if I have bad stuff in my blogger. Heaton didn't actually get in trouble because it's not really a school matter but his mom and him had a meeting with the 10th grade principal. That lady scares me, when I received detention from her, she shoved her face in mine and started yelling, then some dude said SIGN THIS! God damnit, I really want to say some horrible and cruel things but I can't, god it's so hard to hold back all these emotions against all the retarded things and people in life. I feel really bad for Heaton. Heaton always makes fun of me for hating authority, but now I know he probably feels the same. Ok, I'll tell you the actual story, Heaton said in his blogger that Jason OConnor should die. Then someone reported him, I believe it's OConnor and the principal told OConnor to say it was someone else who reported Heaton, so nothing bad starts to break out. I can almost guarantee it was Heaton because when I was with Jason alone, he kept saying how Heaton was a psycho and belongs in a mental home and he sounded threatened by Heaton. And I quote... James "Tom, Heaton got reported...By Oconnor." Me - "OConnor did you really?" OConnor - "Yes." When Heaton showed up, he denied it. But just in case it isn't OConnor who reported Heaton, I'm keeping my blogger nice and happy until I'm 100% sure it was Oconnor. Come on, it's obviously OConnor, why would anyone else report Heaton, unless they have a gigantic grudge on Heaton. But as everyone knows, Heaton is loved by all...Except OConnor which allows me to come to my conclusion, OConnor is the reporter. If it's you big JO, I'll just have to say, that is very sad. Back to my real life, I babysat today, pain in the royal ass, and uh...Now I'm doing homework and watching the Yankee game with it's spectacular Star Wars intro. Ok bye, and hopefully I'll know by tomorrow who reported Heaton. As you can see, I really enjoy defending Heaton. Wait, if Heaton didn't actually get detention, he only had his parents find out...Then what am I afraid of? MY PARENTS CAN CARE LESS! THEY'RE WORSE THAN ME! (= Ok, so here's how it goes. The Gay/Lesbian orientation...WAS AMAZINGLY HORRIBLE! I feel like Holden Caulfield criticizing everything but it's fun doing this. The Gay/Lesbian orientation, I tried so damn hard not to laugh, I let out a snort. Then the girl said "Daddy Fucker" while reading a poem a gay kid wrote. That's when my face turned beat red because I was holding in the laughs. Wow, why should people be complaining how gay people be harassed and stressed out, why not complain how school sucks 10' dick, that's right, 10 feet, not inches. People should be complaining and revolting about the government, about our liberal rights, about all the gay laws, about how school is giving us fucking too much work and no freedom! WHY DO WE NEED TO GO TO SCHOOL! Life sucks. Period. No, there's no exceptions to that, life sucks unless you're rich and don't have to take shit from nobody. Here's my real opinion on the kid who reported Heaton. We're in high school you god damn duckweed! Are you that immature and retarded? You suck so much, you should leave Earth. That is all. Oh yes, gay people are called faggets because a fagget is a bundle of sticks and in the holocaust, they used to burn gay people alive on bundles of sticks. Horrible, I don't wanna use that word anymore but I guarantee I will use it again. Probably about 20 times tomorrow. Ok, now I really gotta stop procrastinating and do my homework. Goodbye everyone and get ready for another randy dandy blog for tomorrow.

Formed a band with Paul Cozzolino and Steve Giampetro called The Natives. Yesterday I went to my grandma's with my cousin Kate and we had her specialty dinner...IRISH SPAGHETTI! or as I at first called it, meatball chicken! Ok...uh...ya we played Wheel of Fortune and we finally went there, we've planned this since forever basically. Well beginning of school but it never worked out because I babysit now for money...gay job. But now it finally worked out hurray. Ok that's all...except...Heaton got a bunny also and named it Churchill and I hate school! Ok, right now I'm updating this update with more stuff...it's 9:35 PM now and I just wanted to say I drummed for 4 1/2 hours like crazy, the end I flipped out on the drums thinking of all the poor momma mice that seperate from their babies that are fed to snakes...and thinking of that...I SMASHED THE DRUMS LIKE I NEVER SMASHED!!! Oh, Dan started up his life again...that's great to hear, it's great to see friends recovering from the Great Depression. Ok, I'm sounding retarded right now so cy'all later.

      Great 4 day vacation. Last night, I went out to dinner with my cousins and all for my cousin and my grandma's birthday, both tomorrow, December 1st. They came back to my house. We played Mario Party 5 again, laughing our asses off. That game is hilarious and fun. Today, band practice, good one, funny one, we made a happy song that's silly and another song that's heavy and personally my favorite. Ok that's all. Bye.

      Every dream just consumes my real life. This one, I learned kung fu, beat up some Asian dude that attempted to kill me and steal my money, the fight went from the movies all the way to Grand Union. We fought long and hard. Then my sister was stolen because she had vital information about the government, my dad was too lazy to go save her and so was I, and she finally came home at the end of the dream. Mr. Tringali had saved the world from rapid rising temperatures by digging a hole near my house (Thrush and Cygnet), dug it 5 feet down and 5 feet to the right and came to a valve at the origin of Earth (0,0). This doesn't make any sense but dreams just shoot at you random feedback from days before, I had a test in Math the other day on locuses and circles on graphs so that explains it. So with a great deal of mathmatical precision, Mr. Tringali had turned the valve and saved this world once again! Crazy dreams. Yesterday was Thanksgiving, not Turkey Day, you fools. I went to my cousins. It was awesome. Lots of food throwing and flinging, watching Dan play Silent Hill 3 where dogs with no heads and Montazumas come out to eat you, and to top it all all, playing Mario Party 5 for about 3 hours and laughing our asses off to things that aren't even funny. I also kung fued everyone which leads into my crazy dream. Well that's all, so bye bye folks...I mean that's all folks!

      I'll tell you what happened. Another band practice, not much accomplished. We slacked the whole time. We hung out until about 11. We watched Revolutions with Gavin's bootleg at Jimmy's awesome theatrical den. We also played Mario Kart on Dan's fucking projector. It's amazing. That's about it. I'm too god damn tired to type so I'm going now. Happy Thanksgiving, which is tomorrow. I'm going to my cousin's. Donkey Kong.

      Today was awesome. First a band practice without Chris, but it was awesome and we made a new song called Always. It's the best song so far. We found out this kid Justin can sign us and get us popular and stuff. After practice my mom's long lasting friend and her son Chris came over. I haven't seen Chris in a while so I was excited. The kid's awesome, and he's got all these awesome things like the new Ngage cell phone and all these great Gamecube games. The whole time we just glued our eyes to the tv or computer screens, playing games and watching movies. Chris started playing this game on my computer I didn't even know I had. Then I started to play this game called Freedom Fighters which is "What happens if the Soviets won the Cold War?" Commies take over New York, you lead a resistance of revolutionaries to crush the Soviet Union. It really makes you love America and want to nuke Russia. After I think of it, America is a great country compared to every where else. Even though the government is all shaky and I'm always saying OH THE GOVERNMENT SUCKS, LAWS SUCK, THERE'S NO FREEDOM, WHY DO WE HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL, this and that. All the other countries are much harsher and now that I really think about it, I would be honored to fight for my country. Especially in an awesome situation in the game where Brooklyn and Manhattan have been taken over completely but here comes along you, with all this revenge in your blood, sniping all those commie bastards and torching them to see them run in flames regretting they ever stepped foot on American soil. There's this really anying commie female news reporter and I want to kill her even if she's just a bunch of codes on a gamecube disc. Anyways, that's basically it. Oh and I'm cutting down on all the bad stuff I'm always saying in here. People will start thinking I'm really a psycho, it's just that I like to talk meaningless crap to waste my time, mostly procrastination, I hate doing homework. As does everyone else. Something positive, Christmas, god I can't wait. It's definetly the best time of the year. Toilet Bowl. I'm making my dad a bday card with a picture of him, well it's a cartoon guy supposed to be him, on a statue thing, it's lame and horrible. Actually I'm going to change it, I hate making bday cards. Ok later everyone.

      It's great how my previous blogger made Heaton think I was crazy. If you don't know who Heaton is by now, he's this friend of mine who's really tall and moved here from England a year ago but only for 3 years, he originally lived in Sachem area...anyways Heaton takes things too seriously. He goes crazy calling me a psycho because of my previous blogger. Well guess what, my previous blogger is true, I AM A PSYCHO! Anyways, enough of that. In the past couple of school days weird things happened. On Tuesday or Wednesday, I forget, the band got in trouble when a sub (Mr. Paster aka Mr. Potter) that has no intelligence of music, egged us on to play crazy stuff and the next day half the band gets 3 days of detention, plus we had to write an apology letter to Mrs. Kalabza and Mr. Paster, why Mr. Paster? I have no clue, he deserves shit so Paul typed his and copied one for me and I wrote mine to Mrs. Kalabza's. Alot of people typed it, which most kids don't know is very disrespectful, so I wrote it, a page long and very sincere. Thank god the next day she decided to be kick ass awesome and slim it down to 2 days of detention so I didn't have detention on Friday (yesterday). Also, on Wednesday on the after school bus Jason C and this other kid Jamie made fun of the gay kids and Jamie pissed in a bottle. Paul and I were dying of laughter, everyone was dying. I think we were bombed with laughing gas. Anyways the gay people were like YO YOU DONT KNOW WHAT SHIT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH IN THE PAST HOUR. Bullshit, they're "shit" is an illusion. They supress it upon themselves. I saw gay guys kiss, that made Paul and I scarred for life. Yesterday, I can't remember what happened. Oh yea! Heaton kicked me down the G stairs and it was fun, and Chris Michaelis came over and we did stuff. Highlights of the day. Today nothing happened, I spent the day alone. Which brings me to my conclusion. My life is getting darker, smaller, compact into a ball I can't break out of, it's becoming more lonely. The sad part is I've inflicted this pain upon myself by certain thoughts, you know the thoughts. I talk about it so much, there's no way you can't figure out what I'm talking about. I can't stop thinking, is it just a fake movie.

      I hate this world, I hate it all, I hate school, I just wish it would all go away, god damnit please somebody just destroy it all, flush it all away, make it the way it belongs. I hate my life, I hate my god damn english teacher. She gives me detention for no reason and now I'm punished for a week, given to me from my dad...I hate them all. I hate not having control of what I want to do. I don't want to listen to the bullshitting dike phony teachers or the cops, or the superior authority. I don't want parents, elders or peers to listen to, I want to listen to myself, I want to make choices in a world where anything is fucking possible without god dam communist fuckers coming into my life and start telling me what to do. I hate going to detention and having some 100 year old lady tell me what to do, I can't even fucking rest my neck and my neck is injured. I hate getting in trouble for laughing in Italian. I hate getting my seat switched because I talk too much. I hate teachers asking you where the fuck you're going every inch you step. I hate everything aspect of school and life. I just want to hang out with friends and have a decent job that doesn't take brains to get and live happily and normal. God damnit, I can even become a professional drummer and make millions, and I don't need to even go to school. I hate no being able to say "gay" and the fact the gay people alliance come in and have this gay orientation with all the classes and the gay guy says all the stereotypes are fake meanwhile he's doing all of them while he's speaking. I can't wait until I'm out of this shithole, let's just hope this shithole explodes. I hope armaggedon comes so people like me can be put out of their misery. The sad part about it all is I don't stand up for anything. I hold it all in, one day I'm going to snap. If you're reading this, do not tell anyone, especially adults. But if they do see this, go ahead, let them put me in a mental home, but that isn't possible. I will be gone, far far gone away from this land before they can catch me, or I'll be dead. Sorry if this is disturbing you but as you can see my day is horrible and now I'm admitting all the things horrible with my life. That's why I've been inflicting my pain on some people, sorry Heaton, if you're reading this, this is the explanation. I can't stand my life anymore even though chances are in a week I'll be fine again but deep inside I'll have the inevitable feeling of disgust and pity of the world, thinking everything isn't fair in life. I wish I could say "For now on, I'm doing anything I want to do, and nobody can stop me," but I'm afraid. Control scares me. Oh goody, the new Matrix Online site has finally launched! haha, screw all the shit I just said, I'll be swimming in money when I become a pro drummer so why worry about school!

      Today...amazing band practice, Pat couldn't make it though because he was on vacation somewhere. We finished Forgetting To Remember, it is definetly the best song ever. I hope we succeed and get places, and eventually get to record and make some cd's. How do you do that? say cd's or cds...tell me how...or tell me why aint nothin but a heart beat. Nothing else happened, I'm just really lazy, and I have to do my homework. I also have to frickin go to the library before school tomorrow to finish some AP Euro project. Life sucks. Bye. Actually, no bye. I just thought of an excellent idea. When I'm finally done doing this blogger thing which won't be for a while, I shall print it all out and make a book out of it for good old memories and keep it forever. Hurray.

      Yesterday was my mom's antique party and my house...pain in the ass. But I spent the whole time in my room making a christmas list. Today, something crazy happened. In Studio in Media Arts, this freshman Travis and I were throwing our tests in the air and predicted where they'd land...well I threw mine and it landed on the ground standing up on its side. Concidering it was extremely windy outside and the window was creaked open and the paper is very light, the chances of that happening are 1/10000...well I threw it again. It did it again! It stood up again! Then after the second time I heard an annoying beep in my ear. Then I tried it again and it wouldn't do it anymore. They fixed it. There was a glitch in that area, the gravity was fucked up in that spot. Maybe the wind messed up a computer source somewhere changing little things, and then they fixed it. That's what the beeping sound is. The point is, I won't stop looking for clues, until I find the truth. Wow, this new Puddle of Mudd song is godlike. AJ and I talked about how book worms are going to turn into computer worms and the expression "Don't judge a book by its cover" will turn into "Don't judge a computer by its modem." Other stuff happened but I'm too lazy, nothing exciting except Matt Kaiser got in trouble by the security guard for throwing stuff and Jay in the commons. I was so happy to hear it, the first time Kaiser gets in trouble. This day was pretty boring. Well, so long everyone.

      Awesome band practice today. What else happened, 2 very odd things. While I was sleeping my cell phone rang 3 times with these weird phone numbers. Later in the day I was washing my hands when the phone rang, and I thought to myself if I dry them I won't make it in time to answer the phone. I made my choice, dry my hands, then I ran to the phone and as soon as I picked up, click, they hung up. The problem is choice. I think I can see the future. If I picked up the phone, something would have changed. Maybe the entire day would be different. Maybe I'd be out of this world, but the thing is, no matter what happens, you must not stop looking for the clues. The changes, dejavu...there was a change. Which brings me to my next coincidence. Just before as I was putting on Return of The Jedi on the vcr, I pressed play and didn't realize the TV wasn't on video. What came up on the screen was Episode II, the very dramatic scene where Anakin and Senator Amadala discuss their romantic issues. I thought someone had changed my Return of The Jedi to Episode II until I then realized, "Ooooh, this is on tv!" and I changed the channel, and sure enough it was on Starz or something. Well, I put the TV on video and put on Return of The Jedi and it was at the once again very dramatic scene where Luke tells Leah they're brother and sister. Dejavu, a change...cause and effect...causality. The cause was last night watching Return of The Jedi and falling asleep half way through, effect being realizing this weird coincidence and being aware of something truely confidential and special. These thoughts to not make any sense to most of you but I must express them to the public. Be the person who hates to live a lie, and searches for clues wherever that person is. That is all.

      "If we are to give our lives, we'll give em' hell before we do!!!" - Captain Mifune  That line jumps me every time. Oh, Kaiser and Jason are coming over soon I think and um...that's all, no school tomorrow, woo! Right now I'm blasting music so the whole neighborhood can hear it and reading articles about how the Revolution isn't over, there is more to come.

      I'm just getting too lazy to do this blogger thing. It's almost been a year that I've used this, it's been since January and this January will be a year celebration. Goo's Blogger 1st Anniversary! Wow, this year went slow now that I think of it. In the past couple of days I hung out with Jay, Matt, Heaton and Paul. At least that's all the people I remember hanging out with. Friday after school I hung out with Paul and then Heaton came over. Then Heaton and I went into town without Paul because he was too lazy. In town, Heaton and I got some pizza, went to Cornet (Heaton bought guitar strings) and Heaton lost his phone on the bike ride there so we had to find it, it was at Smithtown Elem. At Matt's house, Jay and I took Matt's been bags and rode them down his stairs. We also jumped from the upstairs balcony across the stairs and onto the otherside...that was fun but scary. Then I slept at Heaton's that night, we were at the movies with Matt and Jay but then decided Heaton and I didn't want to see Scary Movie 3 again and there was nobody there worth talking to so we left. Yesterday Heaton, Matt and I jammed, it was fun, we made some song...Right. Last night Heaton was going to sleep over (a second night of sleep overness!) but he decided not to because of the much much work he had today. Instead we just hung out and watched Star Wars Episode II, BORING! I had to watch my sister that night because my parents were bowling... fortunetly the boys didn't have to come over, god their insane. So Paul came over and we watched Reloaded. He never saw it before and was dying to see it. I think Paul's organization skills and attention span are rising. Normally he'd forget he was coming over, but he didn't forget. He even set out a time for himself to come over. Good boy Paul, turning into me. I also found out Heaton was always jealous of my organization skills and that's why he made fun of me! "EEEEEEEASY BIG FELLA!" I fell asleep half way through the movie concidering it was 12 at night and I've seen Reloaded over 1200 times. Then Paul woke me up and asked me a million questions and I gave him all the answers but was barely thinking because I was so tired. Then Paul left, I went to bed, next day...here I am now with NO HOMEWORK THIS WEEKEND!!! WOO!!! No band practice today, instead Dan Pat Eric and I reunited Jackbutt. It was awesome but wasn't good until the end when we slid down wooden step railings on our asses and fell on the next rail hurting our you know who's! Pat did some good damage with a little help from me giving him a boost. We also jumped from the top of Jimmy's trailer to his shed roof, that was scary. Dan jumped back from the shed to the trailer which is alot harder concidering the trailer is higher. Dan also jumped a little bridge creek thing and if he missed he'd fall into the lake or stream thing. Dan also got this awesome projector that projects onto his basement wall, we watched Finding Nemo on DVD on it, it was like watching Jesus on a wall. After all the fun, I came back home, ate dinner, actually played drums since like a week, and now I'm doing nothing. Well that's all for today. 10-4 Over and out.

      I'm sorry people, I don't have much time to say what happened so let me sum it up. Last night, the opening night of Revolutions, there was a black out 5 minutes into the movie so I got free tickets for tonight. Last night it stopped right when Seraph was about to get shot but he really doesn't. Tonight, I finally saw it and half the theatre cheered when the movie had passed round 2 after the Seraph scene because there wasn't another black out. Funny it was raining again, it will keep raining until Revolutions leaves the theatre...my dumb theory. Ok, I'm in a huge debate right now on which Matrix was the best. I think it was the 1st one but then again the Reloaded/Revolutions was awesome. Damnit, I can't decide...anyhow Revolutions had an ironic and most unpredictable ending twisting ending so go see it for yourself. Ok goodnight.

      Oh my fucking lord, 1 day left. 1 DAY!!! Tomorrow night will be the best night of my life!!! REVOLUTIONS HITS THE THEATRES AND I HAVE TICKETS FOR 7 PM! I'm going to arrive about 2 hours early just in case everyone decides to arrive early like me. This is the climax of my life, if the humans win, I'll be happy forever, if the humans lose, then I'll end up going on a  massacre killing everyone I see, and then commiting suicide. It's obvious the humans will win. It was weird, some random FBI thing popped up on my computer screen just before, it shows maps and pictures and shows the training scores of some Agent Castle and he's inhuman, his physical activities are way above normal, he's a machine. Agents! THE MATRIX IS REAL! Oh god, that's all I care about right now is the god damn Revolutions. I won't be able to pay attention in school tomorrow, haha. Ok lemme say what happened today. No school, election day or something? Fun band practice, Chris R, Matt B and Bill came over to play frisbee but we were jammin so they just listened to us. Pat got dressed in a million layers of clothing and then we beat the shit out of him and now my hamper is filled higher than my furniture, it's awesome. Actually, it reaches the window. We came up with an original and invited Matt Kaiser into our band because we need a back-up basic tune, yal meeen? I got the new POD cd, it's awesome and it comes with a PS2 game thingy but unfortunetly I don't have PS2. But most of you guys do so I'll use you all. Oh god, Neo's gonna die. I know it. He's gonna, they even freakin show it in the trailers! I'm afraid of what's going to happen. After the movie, life is gonna suck because there's no more, it's all over, there's no matrix's coming out after this. This is it, hence the slogan "Everything That Has An End, Has A Beginning." There's no more thinking of WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN NEXT? But at least I'll be able to live my life in peace not worrying about what happens. What I'll be dying to see next is The Lord of The Rings: Return of The King and...Star Wars Episode III, that's going to be insane. It's going to connect the old to the new movies. It'll be tough for Lucas to do it but it's coming out in 2005 so I guess it wasn't that hard. Ok right now I'm procrastinating so I don't have to do my god damn AP Euro that's extremily boring and is on gay Louis XIV and absolutism. Who the fuck cares, I shouldn't have done AP...it's too hard and stressful. Ok, I gotta do it now, later...and next time I'm writing in this blogger, I'll be a changed man...a changed man...a changed man.

      Wow I haven't done this in an entire week. I really don't want to explain everything that happened in the week. For halloween I dressed as Neo from The Matrix, everyone said I looked like Keannu Reeves. After school, the shittiest halloween ever. It was horrible because Paul made it that way. He made us play football. Then he went into town to buy eggs and practically didn't come back until night time. Then we went to Jared's where we planned on having fun running around egging things until Paul meets up with Crystal and John. So Ravin, I and Nolan just left a few times and stayed as far away from the gayness as possible. I cut my lip wrestling Paul and Ravin. Then at like 9, we decided to officially leave, it was Matt, Ravin, Nolan, Jason and me. We walked all the way to Stony Brook because we had no damn clue where we were. I almost got hit by a train. God damnit if we walked the railroad tracks we would have gotten to St. James alot quicker. We finally reached St. James town and ate at Rocco's pizza where the dude there was awesome giving us free drinks and shit. Good ol' Italians, they're so happy and peaceful. Then on our way out we say some dude in the car who was cursing randomly like he had terrets. He definetly was high and drunk. He's like NEO! And I'm like WHAT! and he's like IVE GOT A PROPHECY FOR YOU, IM THE ORACLE! and I'm like WHATS YOUR PROPHECY! and he's like IM GONNA BREAK YO FACE! It was hilarious. Then he started screaming Trinity. Then Nolan's dad picked us up and brought us back to Jared's where Jared and Paul claimed they had an awesome time doing shit with girls and they made a packed...how do you spell packed...packd...pact...anyways they made a pact and that's just horrible. I hate them. Everyone hated them that night. In fact on our walk we were talking about murdering Jared and Paul. Who makes a pact like that, they don't even know the girls it doesn't fuckin matter. Then I got picked up, thank heavens! I went straight to bed, then yesterday I hung out with Dan, Pat, Gavin and Ahmad. Dan drove me to Gavin's, I was so excited. We watched Gavin and his cousin do professional wrestling on Gavin's mattress and outside. Jesus they looked like they were killing each other but half the things didn't hurt because it was mostly fake. They kept bashing each other with cooking sheets, chairs and steal garbage lids. Gavin beat the shit out of his cousin and his cousin beat the shit out of him but the best move I saw was either Gavin's 3 kicker sending his cousin across the room or his cousin springing Gavin off his legs behind his bed frame, against the wall and then down to the ground. It was godlike. Then here comes the worst yet most fun part of the day. The rest of us decided to wrestle on camera but I hurt my neck and ouch. Then we went to Chris Corby's but he wasn't home so we got Mr. Olsen to pick us up and bring us back to Pat's. Then I had to go home and go to my cousin's to see my cousin Mike who came home from college. That was fun, Britt and I watched History of The World Part I. Then home again, then bed, now today the family is going to the Jets/Giant game and Kate and Britt will be coming over randomly today and Grandma is here to watch Alison. Yes, that's it, ok bye. Oh yes, Revolutions comes out in 2 days!

      Hurray it's Christmas Eve. I can't wait for tomorrow. In today's blogger I will discuss the horrible gay people.   Jesus H Christ, what's with the principal actually allowing a GAY-STRAIGHT ALLIANCE? It's hurting many people like me. No, I'm not gay. It's hurting me because everywhere I go, gay is everywhere, and it's disgusting. Can't you fags keep it all to yourselves and stop fucking with us? We want to live in peace and be restful, meanwhile all you ass fuckers make us think about is you and the gross ways that you dress, act, and live about your lives. I have to put up with seeing two guys make out. What the fucking shit? I can't stand this. DO IT SOMEWHERE PRIVATE!!! It's like you guys do it just to piss us off. You want us to have the image stuck in our heads. It's disgusting. I hope someone else feels the same as I do because I wanna revolt. Throw the Gay Straight Alliance club to the ground. Throw them all to the ground. They don't even realize their purpose. They try to make us stop, but it's not us that's being bad. It's them. Gay people should not act the way they do in public. Acting that way will result in being made of fun. We make fun of you gays because you're immature, primitave, and ignorant. Grow up you fags, be gay in private, not around everyone else. I FUCKING HATE THIS WORLD!      I'm so sick of you all. Get your putrid ways out of our lives. You get made fun of because you're all inflicting us with your disgusting ways. You put the pain upon yourselves. Suprising the school puts up with your propaganda shit, the authority allows you all because this country is "free." Just choke and die. STOP POISONING AMERICA YOU FAGS!   I'm sick of gays, I'm sick of school, I'm sick of it all. I just want to live my life without school and fags being the cause of me having a stroke at a younger age. IT'S NOT FAIR WHY SHOULD FUCKING ADULTS WHO ARE ABOUT READY TO DROP DEAD TELL US WHAT TO DO? WE ARE THE FUCKING FUTURE. I SEE A FUTURE WORLD WHERE EVERYTHING IS BACK TO OLDERN DAYS. DAYS BEFORE THIS WHERE SCHOOL WAS EASY AND GAYS DIDN'T ROAM FREE FUCKING EACH OTHER IN PUBLIC!!! I SEE PROVIDENCE IN THE FUTURE, BUT I KNOW IT'S NOT TRUE. OUR FUTURE GENERATION IS GOING TO HAVE A HARDER SCHOOL AND MORE GAYS. THAT'S WHY IT'S UP TO US TO STOP IT ALL. WHY IS EVERYONE SO GOD DAMN NIEVE?  And TV makes it even worse setting up a better reason to be gay. Every god damn show or movie, there's something about someone being gay. For crying out fuck, there's even some gay sex! You can't say fuck on tv yet you can show two men kissing. Why can't people drill it through their fucking steel head? YOU ARE ALL THE CAUSE OF THE INEVITABLE SOCIETY CRASH IN OUR FUTURE!!!

      Sorry about not writing anything in the past 8 days but it's been too exciting waiting for Christmas. Tomorrow's Christmas Eve. After Christmas, I'll write a shitload about everything. Basically all I did this vacation so far was hang out with Dan (having spooky fun at the tabernacle), Eric, Matt and Tom, Paul, Heaton, see Return of The King, go to Lincoln Center to see the Philharmonic Canadian Brass, and go to Old St. Pub with my cousins and have a shitload of laughter. We fulfilled our tradition of throwing the pickles onto the glass wall like they do in Billy Madison. Ok well, talk to you after the best day of the year.

      The weekend, let's see I hung and with Pat and Dan on Saturday. At night Dan and I hung out, Pat had to babysit. We found $20 at the tabernacle across the street from me. Oh, I forgot Friday. On Friday, I went to Acoustic cafe and it was good except the gay guy saying his poem about having gay sex, which should not be allowed god damnit. He's grossing people out first of all, second of all looking at him makes me want to kill him, third of all gays shouldn't announce their gayness to the world because it's just gross, and fourth of all it's called "Acoustic Cafe" for a reason. Not "Gay People Poet Lounge." Wow, Sunday...I saw my cousins perform their annual St. Pat's Christmas Show. This year is Kate's last year because she's a senior, we'll miss your great jokes on stage Kate, especially the Shrek, Superstar and History of The World jokes influenced by me and my mom. Today, I, what did I do. Nothing. I had barely any homework. I just sat around like a lazy bum, ate, talked online (that's a first) and watched The Time Machine. I think I'm going to have to watch it a few times before I completely understand it. I have to write an essay for English on it as I explained on Thursday. 10 Days Left. I'm so excited, it hurts. I can't stand waiting any longer. I just want the vacation...I can picture it right now, 2 weeks of friends, cousins, jamming with bands (and my cousin on Christmas Eve), watching adults drunk and they end up provoking me to drink because they're so drunk they probably think I'm Martha Stewart, video games, toys, movies, lots of food, great fun, games, the Cop party on Friday where I shall play for all the cops my dearest drumming, CHRISTMAS, seeing everyone I wasn't able to see during this busy year. Oh it's going to be awesome!!! Tomorrow night I have my band concert. We're gonna kick some can, Jupiter sounds awesome. As you can see I'm in a pretty good mood and will be for the next couple of months. This is the best time of the year. Ok bye!

      Sorry, yesterday was actually the 7th, Sunday. You see I wrote it 12:00 at night so technically I wrote it on the 8th but it's about the 7th. Today was weird. I don't remember a thing. I was doing my AP Euro and all the sudden I end up in my bed. I don't even remember how I got there. I slept for about 2 hours and when I woke up I felt like I came home from school at 8 at night. Dinner had been long ready, and now I can't drum because it's too late. I can't even type right now. This is so weird. What happened!!! It's confusing, today was a complete blur and allI remember was the fire truck and Mr. Michaelis coming to my neighbor's house. Now I'm acting all crazy. Everything's green! GREEN EVERYWHERE! AHHHH!! MUCUS!!! Where's tomorrow when you need it? Come on tomorrow, come to me and overthrow this weirded out day of mine!

      Today was very nice. I went to the city to see my uncle and Chris and Dan play in Tuba Christmas. It was good but very cold. Man, Manhattan is insanely crowded, especially this retarded American Girl building I was dragged into. After the performance, we met at TGIF in Islandia. We had fun singing and then my aunt brought up the matrix and you know what that means...yes, I'm gonna keep talking about it. All you need is one little "matrix" and I'm going forever. My dad kept arguing with me that the place at the end (sunrise park w/ the bench dedicated to Thomas Anderson) of Revolutions was the real world, my dad's a retard but I guess he's cool for a dad concidering he likes stuff I like, and most dads I know don't like anything his son likes except women. I got home to do my homework and I got caught up in writing all these very intelligent matrix analogies which relate to religion and philosophy, if you want to see it, just ask me or ask me online and I'll tell you what it was about. I'm too tired (not a surprise) to write it in this. It's freaking 12:07 and I have school tomorrow! Ok bye.

      TWO WORDS. MORE SNOW! Today was awesome. I'm too tired to type everything that happened so I'm gonna generalize it all...here it goes. We went to Eric's, then down his hills, then back to Eric's, then more people came grrrr, then we went to Dan's, we played Mario Kart, then I went home, then back to Dan's. Jimmy came also. We had some fun playing more gamecube, we were too tired to go to Pat's and play in the snow. Overall the day was great. Especially playing war with Eric's toy soldiers and his big baboon statue. Yes. Fun day. Well, goodnight folks...or forks, whatever you prefer. Right now there's a ghost watching me. I can tell. It's Eric. You ever get that feeling sub conciously that someone is watching you but that person is an invisible ghost? Well I have that feeling right now, and that ghost is grabbing my legs from under my desk. Oh...stop that, that tickles....oh...ooooh...oh yes.

      I was really confused, curious, and angry when I thought of this, so it's very strange.   Understand This World  by Tom Grimaldi  I hate the news, all bad news, never good. One boy had no chance for dodge, he was pinned between a car and fence, chances are by an angry teen. Girls find themselves all paranoid in that one spot, where the stalker waits. My cousin almost gets killed by a car, because a gay drunk lunatic was speeding. People killing people over race. Injustice for anybody, freedom isn't free, Shall we ever meet peace between these foreigns and our own kind? I think not. Damn the cops, damn the president, damn the teachers and fuck all authority. Shall people be sentenced to life in bars, I choose death over that. Nobody should be jailed, only exiled to a land where nobody can be harmed by oneself. Why should anyone listen to anyone? Why should I have to listen to you? Why should I have to listen to the people who claim power? These questions are asked by the very minds of the people who are nothing but primative cerebriums attempting to understand the world we live today such as myself. Democracy is defined through Dictating laws and irony spreads throughout the nation as hipocratic leaders send out their bullshit to the convinced people who are a minority to "knowledge." I'm sick of people like me who complain about this world, but it shouldn't be this way. It wasn't ment to be. Humans cannot live without suffering and war, eternal peace being inevitably impossible. Why are secrets held from us every day while others only by illusion are stronger, know of these confidential matters? I know certain people hate these complaints, but now I'm giving in. I'm reaching the source and understanding it all, it's pain and to vanquish it all, to eradicate this fate, would be improbable because the superiority needs to survive. Now save the cops, save the president, save the authority, because now you realise they keep this world under control and to continue the fate, and that the evil is unknown to every human on this planet. Somewhere outside you think, somewhere outside this universe, outside the spiral, I'm reaching out. You strive to figure out who it is you want to blame, but nothing appears, no signs. Nothing but black space with white stars, and the gaseous galaxies far into the distance that aren't even there, they are only printed onto a wall of no memory, no existance, it's only a painting. Eventually you conclude that long ago outside of this illusion, after falling sun and flesh, led by the rise of this once named minority, that a renessaince, no a revolution has occured but then you say, "It's too late." Too late too choose, too late to change. Sad that evolution has killed the true mind, and brought in the superiority of those who don't feel our emotions, and that minorities have claimed the throne, are now the absolute majorities. Not fair you say. You don't even understand this writing, poem, whatever the hell you want to call it. I don't either. The truth is I don't understand this poem either because it is truth and fiction, real and illusionary.  I'm sick of this life. I'm sick of being such a dumb species. I'm sick of humans needing religion in order to live under control. I'm sick of people not being able to accept a realistic truth.  The matter of this opinion is, I don't even know if I'm right. Nobody does, no matter how long humans exist, we will never know anything but that we are using our mind to think. One day I spend just staring around, relaxing, pretending I know, but I don't, and I have to forget about it all because I may just never know until I die. Relax, forget about reasoning and beliefs, just relax and have a load of fun before you're life is gone. Hopefully when we die, the truth is revealed and we experience the first day of our real lives. "To other worlds, aliens see our world as an actual hell." - The man I think is my father. Humans are primitave and imperfect, but maybe we're the smartest out there along with being the only ones out there. Many beliefs are made. I have many theories. None can be proved now. But if this world is...    One more soldier reports to heaven, he's served his time in hell.

      I just don't understand. Why is it when we make fun of gay people, they can get us in trouble but when they start calling us straight, it is impossible for us to get them in trouble. What, you all think gay people are special just because their gay? NO! It's just a sexual preferance, and I'm sick of this whole fucking world feeling bad for the gay people being picked on, happens to us straight people too you know you disgusting worthless ignorant gay straight alliance. It's not fair, we can say one thing to gay people such as..."Your breathe smells like shit!" and they'd be like "Oh my gawd I'm reporting you!" Then I'd get in trouble but if it was visa versa..."Your breathe smells like cocky!" - Gay guy. And I reported him for some crazy ass reason, he would not get in trouble! NOT FAIR AT ALL! Ok, just wanted to share that analogy I came up with today...or last night while sleeping? No, this morning? I'm not sure when I thought of it but it's the greatest thing I've ever came up with. Nothing extraudinary occured today, and nothing great has occured in the past few days. Boring, I can't until Christmas. Two sweatshirts and a beanie came today, I couldn't wait for Xmas so I opened the POD one w/ the beanie. Now for some odd reason I'm going to run now...I'll be out of breath in no time. I haven't ran since the Spring! Ok that's it. Oh yea, I got Tony Hawk Underground (THUG) and it's awesome. You can run around, skate (obviously) and drive many types of vehicles. Also, just another month or so until my 1 year anniversary for this baby blogger. Woohoo! I'm going to celebrate and give my computer a cupcake... I'll smoosh it into the cd rom drive or just throw it at the monitor screen. Ok that's all.

      So...today Chris and I made pancakes. We screamed out the window to Hoobastank - Out of Control...then Dan came over. We hung out the rest of the day and learned Smells Like Teen Spirit. I have to drum and sing. Gavin sings also but I have to sing the chorus because it's a high voice. We kicked ass at it and we're gonna perform it tomorrow at our mini show. Then we saw this video of this lady falling down this hole thing behind a cash register, the funniest thing I've ever seen. urlLink Click here!  So Dan's mom drove over to bring my Nintendo magazine I had left there and Usual Suspects which we were going to watch but Dan went to this kid Bryan's house, already had plans for it. So I went to play Lasertron with Paul, Jay, Jared, Rebecca, Emily...and other girls. Then my dad picked me up, got home, I showed him the lady falling video and now I'm learning the actual lyrics for Teen Spirit considering at first all I did was scream random words. Cy'all later. Tomorrow's SUPER BOWL SUNDAY AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO'S IN IT!!!

Anyways, it's a cool phone...I took some pics, actually sorry their pix! I took some pix and I set it so my friends faces pop up on the phone when they call me, that's the best part about the phone. Also that I put some Rush songs onto it and now it kicks major ass. Yesterday, I got the phone. Today was Friday, is Friday and will be Friday for another hour. I went to school. Came home. Came home again. Hung out with the band and the boys without Pat because he was working. Then I went bowling with Amanda and Chris and JJ, Steve, Erica, Michelle and Danielle. Cool people ya know, they're cool. Right now, I'm ultra tired so I'm making any senz. fo weel. I'm now having a Grimaldi/Michaelis sleep over. Peace Foo.

      There was alot of snow today. It was a snow day today but it didn't matter for me because there wasn't school for me anyways. It's regents week and I already took my math regents and my euro midterm. Now I'm free for these two days. Then there's school on Friday. How lame is that? So, today it was Dan, Jimmy, Mal, Eric, Gavin, Tom and me. We went sleigh riding but it didn't work out. Gavin, Mal and Eric deserted us while we were sledding so we went to Jimmy's and told them to come. We hung out there for a while. I played Super Nintendo alot, Super Adventure Island. It's this game Jim has that I've loved since the day I moved into Smithtown. Oh, it was orgasmic. You see, as a child, I could never beat Mr. Octopus but today I did and I got up to world 4 but then I died. It was then a sudden state of depression. So you know, we just chilled and then Eric, Gavin, Tom and Mal went home. Then Jimmy, Dan and I went to what we thought would be huge hills at the tabernacle but we saw the hills were gone. We were gonna make a huge star of david in the field but we were way too tired. Hey, 3 w's in a row..."we were way." Nevermind. Anyways, then we walked to Dan's house through the tabernacle and past the Pope's house and then Dan went home, and Jimmy and I walked home talking about our economy, weird. Then I came home, ate dinner and found out I'm getting a cell phone. It's the same one Paul Stoltz has. It's an LG Verizon Flip Camera Phone, and I'm going to have the ring for Unloco - Bruises or some other Matrix song. It's gonna kick butt. Maybe I can put on something from the Spooner Street Mafia. Or Dan's Hey Jude ending is awesome. Or Hey Ya, datz eh gewd wun. I hope mine has angel farts on it. Ok, now Pat's coming to get my calculator for his test tomorrow, which I don't have any of. HAHAHA. Tomorrow is a day of band practicing. Bye. I'm gonna go drum now. Bye.

      Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds = LSD...says my dad "They were all trippin' cept for Ringo, he was sorta straight."  HURRAY! TODAY'S THE BLOGGER'S BIRTHDAY! HAPPY BIRTHDAY BLOGGER!!! Ok, that was boring. The AP Euro test was a fucking killer, it was too long and too hard. I definetly failed it, but who gives a shit. Today, what's going on today? I don't know, I'm just lumpin around my house, playing games, eating foods, and doing the usual slimety shlam dance. Tomorrow and the next day are days of lazyness and fun. Being by myself, living off the fat of the land. Peace and quiet. That's how I like it, with an occasional human here and there. That is all.

      Well the Math A Regents was incredibly easy. Now I'm studying for tomorrow's AP Euro midterm. Then I'm done for the week with tests. Paul came over before to study but of course the study party turned into Mario Party. Then online just 10 minutes ago me and Heaton had a great and fun argument as we usually do only this one was the biggest. At the end, I told him I enjoyed it when he says I suck at drums because it motivates me so now I turned Heaton into a Tom drummer pesemist. Woah! 1 hour and my blogger will be a year old! Baby blogger is now a 1 year old...tomorrow I'll have a huge celebration thing for it. Ok, goodnight.

      Yesterday was cool, Jim, Dan, Paul and I hung out around my house. My parents went to a party New Jersey. We jammed alot, with Dan's new kick ass song. It's the best song ever, not even joking. We ordered Dominos, did some other fun things. We checked out this back masking website. Really freaky. We started getting afraid of the monsters in my house. It was great fun. I slept at Paul's. We watched Waterboy and this morning we went to Quiznos. Then we went back to my house and my parents came home. We played some Mario Party and now he's teaching me math for tomorrow's regents. I hope I don't fail. I'm really tired, and I'm sick of school. I'm sick of the hardness, and how hard all the gay tests are. I'm sick of the snow. I'm sick of the cold. I'm sick of the same fucking routine and seeing the same boring people everyday. I'm sick of the teachers teaching me things I'm bound to forget in a day, I'm sick of the rules. I want the summer, paradise. I want to ride into town with friends every day, play a bunch of fun sports, perform with my band. Not this fucking hell. I fucking hate all of you for this world you've all created. I want freedom.

      Today after a 1 hour delay, and after school, James, Kaiser, Paul and Heaton came over. We jammed. Then Paul left so we took over the blue sticker on his phone which he goes crazy not to take it off. Why, who the fuck knows. So we jammed and all, didn't do much. Then later on I went to Kaiser's, did some diddly, ate some pizza, saw Gavin kick Tom video, amazing. Especially the expression on Dan's face. Gavin you could crush Agent Smith, go for it. Ok, so nothing really amazing, just average fun for today. Now Tringali's coming over 11:40 at night so cya guys later.

      Oh god, only a couple of weeks left until the blogger's birthday! Anyways, I haven't been writing in this thing alot lately so I think I'm going to get back into the groove. Today was awesome, it was a snowday. I woke up and my dad made me get in the shower and I tried to convince him that there was no school but he didn't believe me and right when I got out of the shower, he said NO SCHOOL, that bastard. But the hot shower actually made me fall asleep even faster and I had a great 11 hour sleep, waking up at 10:30. I watched "Look Who's Talking," then got THE CALL from Pat saying I'd get the HAND UP THE ASS CALL from Jimmy, and sure enough, I got that call also, and boy was I exilerated, fullclemped, flamboyant, flam tap also. You know what, I have no idea what the hell I'm talking about. I went snow funning with Dan, Pat, Jimmy, Eric, Mal, Gavin, Matt, Chris, and I think that was it. We went to the sump, played tag on the ice, attempted to go in the manhole sump thingy but it was all water in it and we got soaked, had snowball wars, killed each other masterbate but then got reancarnated just in time for fun at Jimmy's. We played air hockey, Super Nintendo and Nintendo 64!!! It was a shitload of fun. The whole day was on the whole, a blast! So kids, get your funits today for all boys and toys. Made by Patrick Olsen, corperations aren't for sale, see details on box, munchos aren't included. You ever wonder what the hell those little shits are saying at the end of commercials? Me too. I don't want to go to school tomorrow, I'm gonna be all tired and sleepy until lunch, then I get hyper. What will happen this weekend, nobody knows. But one things for sure, I must attend my homework now. Wait...this Just In (Schreck or Timberlake), right now, my sister is running around the house in circles screaming, so I must do my job, neutralize the threat. 143 bffl xoxoxo ox...horns. PEACE OUT

      If you can't figure out what this song is about, knowing me (hint), you need to watch that certain movie a couple of times. You all know what it is, and you all know what it's about because you all know me. Read carefully.  "Pet" by A Perfect Circle  "Don't fret precious I'm here, step away from the window  Go back to sleep   Lay your head down child  I won't let the boogeyman come   Counting bodies like sheep  To the rhythm of the war drums   Pay no mind to the rabble  Pay no mind to the rabble   Head down, go to sleep  To the rhythm of the war drums   Pay no mind what other voices say  They don't care about you, like I do, like I do  Safe from pain and truth and choice and other poison devils,  See, they don't give a fuck about you, like I do.   Just stay with me, safe and ignorant,  Go back to sleep  Go back to sleep   Lay your head down child  I won't let the boogeyman come  Count the bodies like sheep  To the rhythm of the war drums   Pay no mind to the rabble  Pay no mind to the rabble   Head down, go to sleep to the rhythm of the war drums   I'll be the one to protect you from  Your enemies and all your demons   I'll be the one to protect you from  A will to survive and a voice of reason   I'll be the one to protect you from  Your enemies and your choices son  They're one in the same  I must isolate you  Isolate and save you from yourself   Swayin to the rhythm of the new world order and  Count the bodies like sheep to the rhythm of the war drum   The boogeymen are coming  The boogeymen are coming   Keep your head down, go to sleep, to the rhythm of a war drum   Stay with me  Safe and ignorant  Just stay with me  Hold you and protect you from the other one  The evil ones  Don't love you son,  Go back to sleep"  Analysis - Evil ones, boogeymen are people such as Morpheus, This is the Matrix and Agents talking in this song, or an actual father reaching out to his son hoping he'll stay and sway in this "new world order" with him, because no adult can exit the matrix without going mentally insane and dying. Whoever it is, he wants this child, to stay ignorant and stay within fate (matrix), away from choice (real world). Counting bodies like sheep, this pretty much means in the matrix, not literally but metaphorically speaking, dreams are of counting the humans instead of sheep, in the endless fields of vats. The window is an exit, the sleep is staying in the matrix. Pay no mind to the rabble (rumors of Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus). Protect you from yourself. = Stay away from your real body. A will to survive and a voice of reason. In Zion, your as good as dead and you don't have any say or reason in life, your liberty is poor, it's a shithole and you spend your entire life eating crap and fighting off sentinals as opposed to the matrix, you can become anything if it's your desire, any proffesion. But the question is, would you stay ignorant, oblivious of the truth and keep your fate and hault this so called evolution from one species to another? Or are you going to give your life to pain and suffering but have the ability of choice, fighting a war that one day will be one, for the future of humanity. Not them. Not them at all. You see. They can't last forever. They don't even live. They only exist. They need to be terminated. Send the Electricity Reaper. Save ourselves.

      First day back to school, the vacation went too fast. I can't get back into this routine, it fucking sucks. It was funny, today I drumming air drumming with my pen and it took me about 5 minutes to realize I had blown up the pen and gotten ink all over me and on my books and furniture. I'm listening to all the cds I got for Christmas, and later I'm going to drum and play some games, then sleep. Yea, I'm happy I'm back in the drumming routine. My New Years Resolution is 800x600...no I'm acting more mature, responsible, adult-like...shit like that. And no more dumb negative shit on this blogger that has nothing to do with the blogger. Speaking of blogger, it's almost been a year. I cannot wait for Goo's Blogger's Birthday! It's going to be so happy, joyful, and gay. Yea bitch, I bet you didn't see that one coming. Ok, well I better get going, gotta finish up Euro homework. This really sucks, but I'm gonna be a good boy about it because I'm growing up and becoming a more responsible and mature man...I hope. Cya.

      Well nothing seems to be updating around this time of year, Homestar hasn't been updated since the 15th and I haven't updated this since the 26th. Nobody's updating ebaumsworld, but my band has been getting lots of progression. It's granderful. We finished this really awesome song called The Man In The Middle. For Christmas, I got a bike, some video games (Mario Kart, Mario Party 5, Star Wars Rebel Strike and Medal of Honor Rising Sun), lots of cd's (A Perfect Circle, Korn, Puddle of Mudd, Limp Bizkit, Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions) and some movies. I also got a cd player that has 3 green, shiny nipple thingies on it. Santa treated me good, real good this year. I also bought a few new Matrix figures, the Smith and Neo Super Burly Brawl Scene (my favorite) and Morpheus sitting in his red chair next to the phone. And ya know, just other little things. Santa kicks ass. So let's see, basically nothing else happened. I saw my cousins alot this vacation. Now this is the end of the vacation and it's all depressing. Going back to school, oh god. I fucking hate school. Why is it the fucking law. I hate you school, I hate you laws. But I've said this millions of times so this is the last time I'm going to say it. This country sucks. But it's a new year so think positive. This country kicks ass. Bye.

      AH! I got 10 minutes to write this shizazz or else it'll be considered tomorrow. It's 11:50 PM now. Today, I had a mini band practice with James and Heaton. We played Fortune Faded perfectly. Some other songs. I think we're forming a band. Then later on, Heaton had to go out to dinner. Oh, I'm too tired to explain everything about Xbox controllers and the funnyness. Ok, I'll explain. We had to go get Heaton's xbox controllers at Dan's because he was crying for them so we got em. Then he left and forgot em but we forgot about em too. As Matt and I were eating pizza my mom just plopped the xbox controllers in front of our plates...we laughed. Funny. I'm so fucking tired. The computer gets me tired. Just strains your eyes and shit. Ok so later on Dan and Jimmy came over. And Paul and John and Pat came over out of no where. It was awesome. We played Guesstures. It's like Sharades only it comes in a board game box. It was fun in a barrel. Crap 3 minutes left. So we had fun. I couldn't go to Kate's. Girl's got mad at me. I'm now alone and everyone left. HEY GUYS YOU GOTTA GO. 2 minutes left so this is Johnny Gomez saying good fight, good night. BOOM. Lookin down the barrel of a loaded Thnikkaman.

       Friday Feb 27, 2004   Ok today is really the 27th...but I'm typing this late at night. I manually put that bold date up there if you haven't noticed. Nothing special in school today, just a normal happy day. You know if you take The Dark Side of The Moon album (Pink Floyd) and match it up with Wizard of Oz, playing them simultaeneously, the cd goes to the movie. So I hear. Pretty cool. However,  urlLink this  is what pissed me off when I got home. WARNING: IF YOU CANNOT HANDLE AN ALIVE GUY GETTING HIS HEAD CHOPPED OFF, DO NOT CLICK ON THAT. It was some unknown russian soldier. I guessed it was Russian/Afghani war where the Afghani's completely obliterated the Russians. Then violently murdered the POWs. Or maybe it's a bunch of fucking crazy ass cannibals as Paul believes. Well I got so mad I screamed just about every curse that exists. Then I hit my Arizona can and it hit the shelf, bounced off and hit the wall and was eradicated biotch. Then I kept trying to fit something horrible in my profile that would shock everyone that read it because I was so pissed off. Man, if I ever got one of those guys information, I would hunt them down, first kill their friends, then family, then them. Or maybe that Russian deserved it, nah I doubt it. Russians kick ass. Yea Christian! Anyways, I went to Jared's for his "birthday party" and I had an awesome time. Laughed alot. Danced in strobe lights and did this popping out face at someone that Paul thought was top 3 or so funniest things he's ever seen. I did it to Dan and Pat and Jimmy and Eric and them all last year in the pool. I'm play dead or something and then I open my eyes and scream and throw my head towards them. Eerie but hilarious. This time I was first impersonating The House of Haunted Hill dude when he spazzes out. What am I talking about? Oh right, the party was fun. It was Paul, Matt, Jay, obviously Jared, Erin, Kayla and Rebecca. We ended up playing  SPIN THE BOTTLE  but I don't wanna get into details except at the end I ended up with only boxers on. Then Jared flagged me, it must have been a horrible site for the guys, the girls didn't see. Then on the ride home some dude kept tailgating my dad so he kept stopping short and he kept telling Paul retarded stories of retarded me and Paul would do that UHHUUAAAAA UHHUAYAAAA UHYAAAA UUUHAAA laugh. With the U and Y. Weird distinct Paul Stoltz laugh. Wow, it's 1:17, I haven't stayed up this late in...a long time. Maybe I should try sleeping. Dat'll do donkeh, Dat'll do. Yea shut up kid.

      My dad bought tickets for this drum show that's going on at 5 Towns College in a week or so. It's gonna be awesome. I was playing the drums today like better than I ever had and I made up a bunch of cool beats and shit, and I realized, no instrument beats drums. It really lets you exert your stress out of your body. It's my life. I'm determined to become one of the best drummers in history. It can happen. Watch me. Don't say I'm bragging, it's called a positive attitudes you selfish little bastards. Haha just joking keepin the peace, conserve water, recycle, word. Anyways...I saw  urlLink this  today and it made me all rowdy and excited. Is that how you spell rowdy or is it roudy. Whutevur. I don't think anything special happened today, just studying for some tests I got tomorrow. 3 of them! Would you believe that? Oh the annoyance of teachers, giving us tests. Sheez. Ok I'm supposed to mention Amanda...Amanda something, I forgot her last name so I'm gonna make up her last name and say Amanda Greco is cool. That would be funny if that was her real last name but I think it's Genitals or something...confused wreck. MSG'D!!! Oh...that wraps on a good blogger very well, for now on I'll homestar my way out of this damn blogger. So here it goes...MSG'D!!!  'hi, my name is annie, i am a little girl, i died five years ago tonight, i was murdered by man who minute went crazy and stabbed me five times, that man was my father, i have posessed the person who is typing this for me, if you don't send this to 20 people in 10 minutes, to tell people about my story, then the next time u look into your doorway i will be there with the knife i was killed with, or i will crawl into your bed tonight with the knife, i have long black hair and red eyes, i am wearing a dress'...I admire the little children to put their effort into making this. Especially the end "i am wearing a dress"...coudn't have ended it any better than that. Let's see James' response to this calamity. s14z: i dont know if this is weird or not s14z: but i jacked off to it

      Today was weird. There was this assembly from 3rd to 5th where Kaiser and I talked about band issues the whole time and occasionally Galentucchi would come in with his hilarious things he says. This lady was talking about her people being called tootsies so he said I call my dad tootsie pop and when we dance it's called the tootsie roll. That kept me laughing for 20 minutes or so. They caught Adam and James on camera because we're going to be on "Today's Show" in march or something. Well they kept erotically shooting Adam with their camera. Adam must have been freaked out. I got extra credit for coming to science because half the class never showed up because of the assembly going 40 minutes into the 5th period. Then I had gym. This is when things got weird. We were playing AP Euro Handball, that's what I call it now, and I was passed the ball but Tim R came out of nowhere and deflected it but fell right over me and smacked his face on the ground. It looked like I tripped him and he went to the nurse and now I'm gonna get my ass kicked by him tomorrow, woopie goldberg. But hey, I always have the almighty Zortek, I mean Joe to back me up. He's this awesome senior that's in Black Magic, he's in my gym class. Voodoo on you bitch. Ok so the rest of the day, nothing weird. Drum lessons after school, then I drummed for like 3 hours and didn't even mean too. I mostly practiced with my hands and got my skill back and made it even better than it was before the vacation. Now I'm ultra quicky, Nestle style. YEEEEEHAAAAAAA THAT'S A HUUUUUUUGE BITCH! ANYWAYS, I haven't even started my homework yet and it's almost 8:30 so I'm screwed considering I have a shitload of hw. Ok I'm gonna bounce and juggle around. Bye

      Holy crap, back from Florida. If you people didn't know, I went with my cousins. First day, monday...Sea World. Busloads of fun. Journey To Atlantis got me soaked. Kraken was the best roller coaster in the entire trip and the animals there were hilarious and intelligent. I also got sprayed with Dolphin ooz. Tuesday was Universal Studios. Terminator was fun, Shrek was fun, Earthquake was great, and Back To The Future kicked ass! I kept pressing all the buttons and calling out random command words like MOVE INTO ATTACK POSITION! or BOOSTERS RUNNING NOW! and when the big jump came I yelled at HYPERJUMP NOW!...I got carried away. For the people who don't know, Back To The Future is a simulator car that takes you through time and has a bunch of buttons for show that you can press but it's awesome because it even shows the year on the car at the current year your in in the movie. Wednesday was MGM. One ride made my entire trip. Tower of Terror. I mean Star Tours, Indiana Jones show and Rockin Roller Coaster were good, but this ride was the most fun ride I've ever been on, well besides Nitro. You're in this elevator and the guy goes WELCOME TO THE TWILIGHT ZONE and VOOOM! you drop a million and fly back up and so on. Thursday was Epcot. Things were fun, the Italian restaraunt made me happy. Mission Space was so good I got a shirt from it, in fact I'm wearing it to school tomorrow. This ride takes you from Earth to Mars, it's so damn real. I went on it twice and almost puked. Well I did puke...I mean...not yet. Friday was lay back at Vistana Resort day. Then hell came forth...when I ate at Zimmie's...just that name makes me wanna puke. I had Zimmie's (it's a restaurant in my resort) for lunch and at night right before bed I wasn't feeling too good. Turns out 3 in the morning, I puked out half of my body. My dad didn't feel good along with mostly everyone else who ate at Zimmie's. My dad and I stayed up until 5:30 watching this movie called The Funhouse. It's supposed to be scary but it's funny because it's old and lame. Ask your parents about it, they might know it. I'm too lazy to explain what it is, or just im me...you know what, I'm gonna tell you. It's this haunted house carnival gypsy land where these 4 teens get off in the middle of the ride and have sex in the haunted house and stay there but find out there's some monster in it. It kills them all except the 1 brunette girly who kills it by electrifying it. I think the monster was made when this man fucked a sheep or something. Weird. Then Saturday was nothing but rough. Animal Kingdom, I could barely walk around because I was tired as hell and barfing killed all my muscles and popped all the blood vessels around my eyes so I kept my eyes closed and walked behind mommy. Haha, no I'm joking but I did keep my eyes dimmed and shades on. I look like a murderer with sunglasses and a hood, so Ima gonna keep wearing em. It makes me feel good. I'm tired, I'm going to bed in a few minutes but first I gotta finish writing, I mean typing. God damnit I forgot all about this damn writing lab report I have to do. Ah fuck it. I have so much shit to catch up on tomorrow. I need sleep, I need to drum, double homework (todays and tomorrows) and drum lessons. And uh...other stuff that keeps my self esteem happy. Well homework doesn't make me happy. But drums do so I don't stop drumming. Ok anyways back to Saturday, Animal Kingdom was ok. We didn't spend much time in it. The Lion King show was magnifecent, I fell for Pochohantaus and the Dinosaur Travel Through Time Ride kicked major wung ho. At night it was Magic Kingdom and I finally went on Splash Mountain, haven't gone on it since I was 5. Didn't go on it 3 years ago because it was broken down. Also the new Mickey 3D movie is awesome. You can even smell the apple pie. Well, then it was time to hit the rode. Back home, woohoo! I was glad, I missed Smithtown and all my friends but definetly not school. Pretty soon I'm gonna be wishing I was on vacation again. On the way home I saw a truck for VIRGINIALINEN (www.virginialinen.com) and I first saw it as VIRGIN ALIEN. Take out the 3rd I in Virginia and the first N in Linen. So you get VIRGIN ALIEN IN and IN can stand for International or something so it's INTERNATION VIRGIN ALIENS. Good band name...not! Oh boy somebody kill me my life is pointless. I can't stand pretending I'm enjoying it. Do I even know what I'm talking about? I'm a humongous skitzo. I got home and people start giving me bad news. People down south sure are friendly. Kyle Moronvinsky's house smells good, he watched my bunny, now my bunny smells good. I'm home now. Happy? I'm not sure. I dont wanna go back to school. I hate it all. I hate it. Fuck this all, does this, any of this that we're doing have any purpose? Why do we live the way we live? We made ourselves believe this is the way to live, but it might not be. It just might not be. School is for dummies. Irony? Yes? No? Perhaps with 1 tsp. of sugar? "Tsp, whats a tsp?"..."TEASPOON!" Sleep Beauty Everybody...no shit. Has somebody been giving me nose candy in my sleep?

      Ok, well its 10 at night and in a few hours, well about 6, I'll be on the way to Florida driving. I'm going 3 am. Jesus, it's gonna be fun though, my cousins and I. It'll be great. I'm gonna try and stay up as long as I can. See how long I can stay up. I'm hoping I can go from this morning 5 44 am to tomorrow night. That will be about 40 hours. Nice...hope I do it. Wish me luck with my lady fans down in Florida. They're all waiting for me down there, or so I extremely desire and wish...and other words. So I'm gonna miss everyone and I'm gonna miss James moving into his new house. Today I hung with Matt and Paul at Paul's. First it was me and Matt and my house but my dad kicked us out because I was NAUUUGHTY. Then I hung out with Dan for a while. Then I was gonna go to the movies but Amanda messed up the plans so I stayed home and finished my hw. Now I have to go to the bathroom really badly, then I'm off to Pat's to get my Matrix Comics. Bye everyone, type in this thing when I get back from paradise!  Every great band loves Satan. Funny, I like the backwards version alot better, and notice the forwards lyrics, "yes there are two paths"...forwards and backwards. and backwards it says "whos little path will make you sad...coincidence? nope. http://www2.memlane.com/jmilner/stairwaybackwards.htm

      IM JUST THINKING HOW THIS SUMMER IS GOING TO OWN ALL ASPECTS OF LIFE. Before I get into the summer talk, let me say that I'll be pimpin Floridian ladies in 5 days. I'm gonna be gone the whole vacation so kiss me now...did I say that? Anyways, it's gonna suck though because I'm gonna miss James' new move into his new house near the Kaiser residence which brings me into the summer conversation. This summer it's gonna be Kaiser, Desimone, Paul, Heaton, Keith, Adam, Rich and I guess some other people, like Steve, Ravin (Kaiser's hood people)...umm...and then there'll be the friends that I'm only friends with. But that's gonna be the group. It's gonna kick so much ass. James house, James' new neighbor who I hear from Paul, she's a great "cocktease". And James, Heaton, and maybe Corey...and me, our band is gonna kick ass too. And the Spooner Street Mafia, I think by the summer time, you'll start to see a rise in our band. Things will start getting wackety. It's going all uphill from here brutha.

      Ok, really this post should be the 7th but I'm writing it 12 at night so...let's see. Friday I hung out with James and Heaton. James slept over. We made some pancakes. We sang to Queen and such. Then when James left, I went to sleep. Then Jay came over and we just hung out and stuff. Now I'm tired as hell and Amanda reminded me to write this. Today, well the 8th, I will be probably waking up around 1, doing my homework and then going out to dinner with my cousins. I don't think I can have a band practice but we'll see. That's all. 5 more days until Florida.

      Today. One step closer to being that "killer monster drummer" as David, my drum instructor labels the best with that name. I went all out on my drums and went crazy playing all the rudaments. My hands are like gods now. I'm also starting to grow black callasses, yummy. Anyways today was a great day where I showed everyone my nude ladies on my picture phone. So today was a happy day. I'm no longer depressed and Corey might be the new guitarist for our band. YES! Tomorrow, James and I are going all out for real, lady! Ok, I'm not making sense to anyone right now but James. So 25 hundred goodbyes to y'all. Tomorrow's freaking Friday! No not Freaky Friday. Lindsay Lohann hit the spot. 123, shoot.

      Today I played Mario Party 5 volleyball with Paul and we finally beat the hard computers after many tries. We celebrated our victory by screaming like women. We also made chips ahoy milkshakes, farely decent. Today I just slacked off, I'm no where near done with my homework and I haven't once talked to my love in the entire day. YAY! She just responded. Anyways, I was playing this pong game where if you win, you get a new nude lady. It's the best game since parcheezy. Ok so I've decided, tomorrow I'm gonna watch all my Winnie The Pooh movies including Winnie The Pooh's Grand Adventure. It brings me back to the good old days. Today I also looked at my old photo album. God, the memories, the looks on all the little children's faces. So Winnie The Pooh it is, and Matt just informed me he doesn't watch Winnie The Pooh. What a fuckin loser. Anyways, I gotta bounce outa this site to finish up my homeworkizzle. Cya Dudes...and notorious chicks. Notorious HUGE?

      I don't know what's happening to me but I'm getting more and more depressed. I think it's because every time I get a lesson from my teacher I feel like crap because I sound like shit compared to him but in a way it's good. I'm improving alot, and in time, I may be as good. Also Heaton posted flyers for guitar needed for our band and nobody called but prankers. So this sucks, my life sucks. It'll get better I suppose. Either James, Heaton or I will find a guitarist and do it the way we always wanted to. I think I'm gonna pray tonight that we find a guitarist. That's it, I'm gonna pray because I haven't done that in years. I'm gonna pray to god. I'm gonna look like one of those boys kneeling on his bed with the moonlight shining in from the window on the cover of Catholic books. So I'm gonna pray, that my dream to be a successful classic rock/heavy modern rock band works out. And if not I'll just have to wait a year or so until SSM's guitarist (Dan) and bassist (Pat) get kick ass awesome. Well they already are, but they'll be even better with more time, and more experience. Oh the possibilities, the choices, what does my future bring me? I worry about it everyday. I'm interested in only one thing, the future of me. Oh god, I need therapy. My brain is flipping everywhere. Everyone I know, I feel as if they're all fading away from me. I feel isolated from everything. Where is my mind? Where did I go? What the fuck is happening to me? I need some lemonade.

      Super bowl + cousin's house + Janet Jackson's tit = kick ass fun. Yesterday, was the band's first little show at Dan's. We did good. Then after that I went to my cousins for the super bowl. That was loads of fun. I played with my cell phone the whole time but it was fun. Basically I had no preferred team but after a while I chose the Patriots considering they won the year before or whenever and were seeming to do better than the Panthers. Today was nothing great except for lunch which sucked...because there's now a million people that idolize me and my friends, haha no it's just that they're friends with us but there's too many of them. I guess I'm saying I have alot of friends. It's true. I'm a friend magnet. No, really I don't know why they're sitting at my table. Actually I like em all, it's just this Billy Davorak that pisses me off. First off he stole our seat, where James is supposed to sit which screwed James which screwed Heaton. So we revolted and kicked him out to the other side of the table. So now Gallentucci is gone (sobbing moment) and it's now Heaton, James, Adam, Matt Kaiser (NEW!!!), and Rich. And on the other side of the table it's Nolan, John, Paul, Billy, Jason... and Jared left. Also Keith and Michelle stand up next to us and just randomly discuss. It's funny but I like it. Please, persist. Ok so nothing else happened today. Now I'm doing the little amount of homework I have and listening to Korn!!!! AAAAAAHH!! RAGEE!!!! Haha B. Anyways, soon I'm gonna drum for a few hours and go all out because I have lessons tomorrow. Blue or pink?

      Today was a happy day. Everything was fine, nothing went wrong. Except Justin at the end of the day getting in trouble for something he didn't do. People were throwing pieces of paper at this gay floutist and the sub thought it was Schreck so now he's getting 2 days detention. But I was a witness and he's gonna have his parents call up. Damn school. I'm sick of adults trying to tell us what to do and how to run our lives. All these fucking punishments and all, and some are after school. They expect us to stay after, after we spent 6 hours in school and just because they feel bitchy. If I ever got in trouble, and had like detention after school or anything, I wouldn't go. Because think about it, they can't force you into coming. You just go home. Next day they ask you why you didn't come. You say because after 1:52 or whatever, every weekday during the school year, you are not in control of me, in fact you're never in control of me. Then they suspend you and you get to stay home! Ha! See punishments are bliss. See that's how I love my life so much. I do what I want to do and I'm not going to let others, no matter how old, tell me what to do. That's why my life isn't a suicidal whore house. Believe it or not much of suicide is caused by adults. And what's with New York being such a hard education, ease off us. I just pity the ones who allow adults to tell them what to do. The only people that can tell you what to do are your parents and the cops, and your parents are only a guide. Listen to them. They're smarter then you think. They've been through life already. Take their advice and hopefully make good use of it. As for the po-po, respect them and try your hardest to avoid conflict with them. But also do remember, they are no more powerful than you. We are all equal, none being superior and inferior in this world, and cops are just like us so don't let them shove you around for no reason. If a cop demands something from you, you have the right to question, to know why he demands. My dad's a cop. His cop parties are insane. They get waisted and pass out and they run around the block with only underwear on, yea talk about ironic. Like I said, they are us, we are them, so don't think just because they're cops, they're here to make examples out of you. But also respect them. What the hell am I talking about anyways, all of these morals, am I high on crack? My point is there is by chance, only one life you live, have the best of it, don't get shoved around, seek the truth, question authority. That's my moral of life. OK, I'm done for the day. Good Bye. Wait, it's me again only it's 8 at night now. You know what kicks ass? Making a movie with Dan and Pat for a school project where Pat is filmed jerking off but they only show the shoulders up and I'm recorded with a =-O disgusted face. Then Pat eases back and I throw milk on him so it looks like ya know. Then Dan records it the controller and the glass of milk, he was playing a video game, not jerking off! Just did that today, lots of fun. My bathroom is also almost done. All it needs is the lights, the mirror casing, the side wall painted and the shower door. Up, Mark the bathroom guy is here again so I gotta let him in and then continue with my drumming.

      Nothing extradinary happened this week. Dan got a new kick ass amp. He sounds awesome with it. The SSM ain't goin nowhere but uphill from hea bizhatch. OH MY GAWD, 136 days left until the RUSH CONCERT!!! Seriously, that's all I'm looking forward to, well that and a few other things...turning 16 (sex?) and driving will be nice. And uh having the freedom, and riding my new bike, but I'm already doing that on the nice Spring days. Ah and hopefully getting a job at THE GAME. Oh girl yes. Friday I hung out with Schreck, Kaiser, Heaton and Chris at night and we went to hang out with Carolyn and her friends, my next door neighbor. Weird...Saturday, I went to Joe Zerbo's with Justin (the singer) to see Captive Honor. Man was Joe's set awesome. When I get a job mines gonna be awesome like his. At night I went to the movies with Keith and his girlfriend Heather and her friend Alyssa. It was fun, we saw Walking Tall. It was a great movie but it was too short, not even an hour and a half. The Rock is the man. Anyways, after that we walked tall around the area and went to McDonald's where we played with quarters to make our knuckles bleed and I kept throwing fries dipped in melted ice cream at the girls. It was fun once again. Then when Keith brought me back home I did that thing, with the bed. Well first I did a dance. Today, Dan and I had a practice with his new amp and we made a new kick ass song. It's really good so far. My grandma came over for dinner just before. I didn't get to practice drums this weekend really, I was busy hanging out with all the people I hadn't hung out with in a while. So this weekend really kicked some tail. Just 10 minutes ago, while finding the secret on Homestar.com of homestar puppet playing tennis and listening to their old christmas everybody song, I was touched. And it makes me wanna write about the great things in life. About how great it feels in the Winter. Christmas time. And having fun in the summer, with freedom. Life is awesome. For all you people that are depressed out of their mind, cheer up...wait my last post I was a pecemist and now I'm all optomistic. I enjoy being optomistic. This world kicks ass. At least Smithtown does. I love my drums. I love my family. I love my friends. I love my life I love titties. Haha, it's funny because I said I love my drums...what was I thinking, I love titties belongs first. And man booz as well. The End.

      Yea, this thing sucks. It gets boring after you can't find the ultimate guitarist for a band (hopefully Mike's brother soon) and you can't get any girls to like you. So I'm just gonna randomly update this when something exciting happens. Chris is coming over. That's exciting. One more week till mother fucking Easter break so I can get mah Rush in Rio DVD. I always get a little something for Easter. It's funny, because I'm an athiest bastard yet I get a present for Easter. Yea I also realized that there's always high school and college parties in movies, but my life is far from a movie. I'll be lucky to go to 1 party in my entire sex life...which ends after your married. Then your life is boring. Is today National Pecemist Day?

      I'm slacking off on the job. Not updating this mo-fo. (Mono-follicle encryptor) So nothing happened during this fast week of school. Yesterday I hung out with Keith Buckheit! I haven't hung out with him in years...or months but still it seemed long considering we used to hang out all the time. We played football, basketball and Halo. It was Keith, Matt K and B, and some other kid I forget who's name. Then Donnyell joined along for a bit. Nothing else at night. Matt came back to my house. He went home at 10. Today I've been hanging out with awesome Christian. He's my mom's long everlasting friend's son and we've known each other since Day 1. We've been playing video games and such all day. Just hanging around my room. What a relaxing weekend. Tomorrow's probably band practice. Uh, Amanda told me to update this so I'm guessing I should say something about Amanda. Uh, she had a dream the other night. There that's very special. She's a cool hot gal with lots of friends. Can anyone guess her name? Does anyone read this thing? That's what I thought. Biotch!

LmAO rOfl, Iz wuz LiKE JoRDan, KisS mY rUmpdIDDy!@#$#%$ bFFL AFF. uuurrrrrhhhhh...WHY DON'T YOU FUCKING JUST SPEAK JAPANESE FOR CRYING OUT LOUD. It's hilarious check these links out, the true faggots of the worlds, only to collect what everyone minorly does and calls it cool and compacts into a gigantic epitome of dick.  urlLink This girl  has got to belong to the dumbest species in this Universe.  urlLink This girl  is from the south and enjoys fucking her brother and also cannot talk right.  urlLink This girl  fucked her boyfriend the first time they went out.  urlLink This girl  talks like a retard but when it comes to the word hole, she adds the w proving that she doesn't know how to spell, and goes to boot camp. Ah, it's so funny. How dumb humans can be. Or are they...aliems. Anyways. Thursday night I had a band practice with Matt and Heaton, that's all I can remember. Friday all I remember is I went to Matt's and then to Pat's. I got to meet Nathan, Tom's girlfriend, one awesome girl and Matt's cousin Alex who I already met. They're both girls. Hahaha uhh... We watched School of Rock at Pat's. Big Party. Party ended when parents came home. Joe Tringali slept over. Dan came over but left shortly. Joe left. I went to Dan's, Gavin, Kristin and Pat were there also. I came home for dinner, then I don't recall doing anything at night, ah yes, babysitting my sister so I couldn't go out. Then yesterday there was no band practice. My dad took me driving in some parking lot. It's harder than I thought but lots of fun. Then later on I went to the mall with Matt, Matt's girlfriend Danielle and Amanda. It was the worst thing ever. We just walked around, never doing it again. It was funny because Matt and Danielle starting making out in the mall. How lame. Very funny though. Uh what else. So that's basically it. Nothing special today. Just boring school. Yep. Ok I've been putting in too many periods so I'm gonna go, bye. Screw this Homestar quote at the end of every blog, that's for nanny's. And I'm only in the blues. Woopdy Dee! Have a bowl of me!

      It's been 4 days since I looked at you. Since I wrote in the blogger. The blogger said it was sorry. this weekend has been fun so far, tomorrow's Sunday and the same thing happens every Sunday. It started off with me and Heaton going to Kaiser's. Tom had a bunch of his friends over. We all...um... hung. William Hung. Sound the same eh? Checked out James' new crib. It's l33t. Played his piece of shit drumset that's made by little tykes or something. Then Heaton slept over my house. We started to watch Monty Python but I passed out. Sorry Mike. The movie just didn't catch my type of humor. Anyways, today was band practice with James, Matt and Heaton. Dan came and helped out with back up guitar and hung out with us. We made an original, well they already had it, I added a drum part to it. Ok so everyone went home except Dan. He ate over and at night we went to Paul's. We ate fluffernutter sandwiches. Then watched some William Hung videos. Then we watched the end of Amityville Horror and then the beginning of Amityville Horror 2. Back to back. They left. I'm extremely tired so that's why if you're wondering why I'm being so vague. Is that how you spell vague? Oh well. The Jumbles man, the Jumbles.

      Holy crap. I practiced drums today for more than 4 hours! NEEEEEEW RECOOOOORD! - Mrs. Mario Party. Nothing special in school. Today was boring. Fortunetly I barely had any homework, so that's why I drummed so long and now I'm gonna watch a movie on the new downstairs dvd player with my papa. I can do it. I can do it 9 times. Told you I'd put a homestar quote at the end of every blogger entry...wait it's not at the end... I can do it. I can do it 9 times.

      I was at James' house today with Matt...we tried to figure out which song we'd play for Acoustic Cafe but it didn't work out. That's all that happened today. I don't get the opposing forces in my head. One says to nuke the arab sons of a bitches after seeing many videos of how they kill each other (plant bombs on people and boom) and the other side says god damnit humanity is a clump of foolish primitive morons that fight useless wars mostly over retarded religions. I don't get why people bother with religion it's hopeless and fake. I'm sick of this world, I'm gonna take my anger out on the drums.

      My mom's birthday today. I'm listening to Hands Down by Dashboard Confessional because I haven't heard it in a long time and it's a pretty good song for the emo category. Anyways, my mom's birthday today. I got her Tower of Power Live CD. Uh, What Is Hip? Today in band I had to play my NYSSMA solo in front of the band, scary as hell, I went too fast also. So for dinner I went out to Butterfields with my family and grandma. It was great, my mom and I laughed at grandma alot and I tried to convince my grandma that communism isn't bad, it's just that Stalin changed it to a totalitarian regime. But it's near impossible to convince someone who lived the Red Scare that communism isn't bad. Uh, I got Kaiser pissed off by trying to convince to him I wouldn't insult him if I was the drummer for his group for acoustic cafe. He's a good guitarist, he just can't do originals and that's why it didn't work before but now it can because we're doing covers which he has the ability to do, but Matt didn't listen, broke out in an emotional breakdown and started raping 3rd graders in his neighborhood. I don't blame him. 3rd graders are when girls are in full bloom. Whatever that means. Hey it's cool how the paragraph makes stairs of spaces going down leftwards down the page...nevermind you guys don't know what I'm talking about. Happy Birthday mom. I haven't drummed on my set since Monday, I'm gonna freak out. A certain tint of olive. I think I'm gonna make a website that's gonna have my book on it. I'm gonna make a book. It'll be updated like every couple of days or week or so and it'll be a continueing story, still thinking about what...AH HA GOT IT!

      Right now it's 2:12 in the morning and I'm been reading my blogger entries since 12:30...very odd. It's crazy the transition of who I was to who I am now. Yet, good memories. All started when I had to do this English memoir on 2 important events but I need you guys to help me figure out what the best day of my life was. You guys have better memory than me. Screw that I'm gonna go play some CS while listening to Rush. That's become a recent habit at night for me when I'm alone. Rush just keeps pleasing my sole more and more. This Rush concert is gonna be a concert for Gods. I've said this already. Yesterday (the 24th) I hung out with Dan, Matt, Heaton and Jimmy and we played some homerun derby. Then went to my house. I gave Heaton one of my army hats and $10 bucks for his birthday. Matt and Heaton went to Quiznos for a bit. Dan and I jammed to this new song we're making that's gonna be long and have lyrics that has a story in it. LIKE RUSH! I'm obsessing over them. I dressed up in my old thug clothes and wore some rosary beads I found and this necklace that can now fit my wrist, I grew(=. Right now I'm listening to Since I've Been Loving You By Zep, great shit. I'm staying up late because last night I got 10 hours of sleep and if I sleep too much during the weekend I can't fall asleep Sunday night. So we all had another baseball catch, then everyone went home and I biked with Heaton to his house because he couldn't carry his model he bought so I did. I came back then went to Friendly's with my cousins and our parents went out to dinner. I hung out with Britt, her friend Danielle and Alison and watched Panic Room. Now I sit here. Half asleep. Retarded. Still wondering if I should play CS...Nah. I'll play tomorrow. I mean tonight. Ok, now it's 6:24 PM and I'm updating today's entry. Band practice, sorta...we didn't get anything done but instead hung out at Pat's. We watched The Fairly Oddparents Movie, it was funny, especially the muffins guy walking up the hill asking if anyone wanted muffins in his funny voice. When I got home which was like 2 hours ago, I just finished my English homework which is a memoir about Jackbutt...I think I already said that in thsi blog but I'm not sure. Anyways, I'm digest from the pizza while CS'ing and then drum. Dag.

      Ok before I talk about the usual Salvador Dali dream I have everynight, I just wanna say yesterday was great, I saw Alyssa at Keith's. We watched Dragonfly, then Children of the Corn (which is the cause for the cornfield setting in my dream and this movie is also a song by Korn only it's spelt Children of The...and I guarantee you all know how they spelt corn.) Damn that was a long parenthasis. Then watched some pimp my ride. Then we all went home. I was gonna sleep over but I couldn't because I had to babysit my sister in the morning, but it was more like being home and sleeping while she exists in the house. My dad took me to Wendy's 12 at night. Good night, I mean my night was good. Now I'm gonna talk about my dream. My dreams are really weird. This is what happened. I went to a Splish Splash in Florida, and I think I've already been here in a way previous dream. So, that's not important, we went to someone's house. I think it was my parents friends or something. I think Bobby Perdue was there. So we went into a cornfield and we're walking down the street/cornfield and all of the sudden I here BOOM and a plane is flying down from the sky and crashes like 20 feet away from us. It was a little red one person plane. I somehow carried the pilot area home (it weighs what, 500 pounds?) but it became miniature when I held it. Then guy was falling from the sky and he put his parachute on and landed on the ground on his neck. Then a random news report came from the sky saying a man had landed on his neck but he was fine because he went through a new break through technology surgery. Ladies, I strongly advice you do not read on from here. The surgery was they cut off big guys heads (no not the head above your neck, the one above the shaft) and took the skin and put it on people's actual skull like a helmet for your skull. They even showed the operation and the guy was screaming of torture...god this is sick. So anyways. We meet some ladies. And I do my Rick James voice and say ya know, "Ladies, come over here and have sex with Charlie Murphy" which was really Bobby. But then I saw the big 2 guys and I said, "You know, I don't have a family, it would be nice to hang out with you people." He just grunted. Confusing as hell. If your still reading this, congradulations, you're a moron. I spelt 'gradulations wrong. ANAWYAS, it was just this girl and I. And she just started touching me. But before anything happened I woke up because the phone rang DAMNIT I ENJOY MY PSYCHO SALVADOR DALI DREAMS! If you really wanna hear more dreams and if you're STILL reading this being the major moron you are ask me personally. You'll be freaked. I think I have another world in my dreams. Yes, another universe, it all makes sense now.

      Forget school, today was a long day, it didn't feel like a school day. School went by in matter of minutes it seemed except for the mile I had to run in gym, 6:29? Fairly decent, good considering I haven't ran since the summer when I pulled my back and I didn't stretch before I ran today. Ok so school went by, and after school no drums...I went to play some homerun derby with Heaton and my brother Paul behind Paul's at the tabernacle. Of course Paul won. Then to Quiznos. It was Heaton's birthday and I'm just plain old special so Paul bought us Quiznos. On the way home Paul and I discussed elementary memories (songs we sang in chorus and plays) and how awesome the summer is gonna be. Today was a reflection of the greatness of this summer. Damn I can't wait. This time I'll actually go to the beach more than 3 times. Ok this day really kicked ass. My dad's all happy again because I showed him my 3.75 average on my report card, told him about me getting picked in AP Euro to debate over this Soviet Union thing, and I played my NYSSMA solo for them and they were both shocked. I love my life sometimes. Also I was watching the end of Grease. My sister has been watching it everyday ever since she bought it the other day on dvd, such a random movie especially for her age...8 years old. Her friend has it so she's gotta too. That movie can make anyone happy. It's like what Mr. Ferrante said, the time of Detante, when people acted all happy go nutz with their happy movies and happy days in the ol neighborhood to ignore the Cold War. Man, I sometimes wish I lived long back then. Back then there were no people walking around worshipping Satan with spikes coming out of their backpacks and no wannabe gangsters, if you were a gangster, you were a true gangster. Now today wankstas just confuse our society by pretending their in gangs. Yea what's their gang, SUPERSOAKER GANG. Full of millions of wankstas who act all tough and then hold their mom's hand when there's no friends around. Well, my life kicks ass. I'm me. I'm myself. Nobody can change that.

      I thought of the most awesome and violent game. You'd be a prisoner in the Holocaust, a jew at Auschwitz. You witness all the families being separated, children and wives being killed, and you flip out. When on the way to your working post, you knock out one of the Nazi guards, take his clothes and gun and infiltrate deep within the core of Auschwitz. Your objectives are to free as many Jews as possible and slaughter as many Nazis as possible. When I mean slaughter I mean you get to pin them on walls and slowly kill them. You can also regain your health by getting it on with the women Nazis and then killing them. As for food, you're not gonna take the Jews extremely small ration of bread so you have to either take the Nazis food or eat the Nazis, I did say violent. I think many would enjoy this game because it's all about revenge which is one of the most powerful emotions a human can hold. Ah yes, and you can bake Nazis alive in ovens, and they're completely awake and alive, not knocked out like the Jews were when they were burnt alive. You can watch the Nazis scream and melt. Here comes the best part. Once you save all the Jews and kill all the Nazis in Auschwitz, you drive a tank into a nearby German bunker where Hitler is...the government doesn't want people to think Hitler killed himself but you did it. The big boss. Adolf Hitler. You gun and melee fight him, he grabs you and attempts to crush you under an incoming tank but you flip him over and hold him there stabbing his stomache so he doesn't have the strength to get up. Here comes the American tank...and off with the lower half of the body. He is still alive. Remember this is Hitler, you want to torture him before you kill him. You drag his half body (him yelling and crying for help) into a random pool of this acid shit that rips his skin away. Then a random belt sander, sand his remains of flesh, then cut his nose and ears off, and staple his mouth shut, and keep his eyes so he can watch the magnificent site as you blast him off in a cannon into the sky...him disappearing and landing who knows where. This game would have to run on an upcoming gaming system for its intense and extreme graphics and would be rated MATURE. They should make more games like this, such as Stalin, Bin Laden, Hussein...but unfortunetly the arabs would go crazy ass on us and bomb us again. So stick to the Hitler one...and the Stalin one.

      Every day draws closer to that one night, one stadium, one band, a shit load of Rush fans. 30th Year Anniversary...is this real? I mean this is gonna be like watching god. I don't care about my birthday coming, I care about this concert. Covering 30 years of their greatest hits...wondering if they play in chronilogical order. I hope not I want them to mix it up that way it's random and more exciting. I'm just praying that Geddy, Alex or Neil don't have a seizure or something, they're old people. I'm praying to god also that I live to see this concert. That's all I want. Please god, make this dream come true. Reality...at Jones Beach. Oh yea and Paul Stoltz' birthday party was fun, I stripped naked and ran down my road. The ladies rated my ass #1? Whoda knewn.

      Holocaust day today in school. Made one day school day seem like a year. Oh the boredom. After school I got a haircut, went to the orthodontist and he got mad because I stopped wearing my retainer and now it doesn't fit my teeth. But I don't care my teeth are fine I don't want to go through the trouble of braces to get perfect white teeth. Turns up I'm getting more fucking braces. Not for a while though. Maybe college...or next year, well that's a major difference. 2 years, actually it's not, well for braces it is...or not. I'm sitting down in that damn chair while a little girl sits next to me. The orthondist says my baby teeth should be all out before 15, "He's never seen anything like this"...bullshit. Or maybe not. Maybe I'm just deformed. "If you got a deformed hand, close the window. Nobody wants to see that  urlLink shit ." I'm my old music on my computer...for instance right now I'm listening to CKY. Attached At The Hip. Ok I'm attached to RUSH so I'm gonna go watch some RUSH IN RIO! Woo! Cya.

      Wow, school tomorrow. Eh? Kinda joyed that we're going back to an organized schedule in life but vacation is so free...but confusing. Ok last night was great, I asked out Alyssa (Keith's girlfriend, Heather's friend) and we're going out. I love you Alyssa. Nothing else besides Alyssa...Alyssa...Alyssa...Alyssa...yea you get the point. Today I was gone all day, god knows where I don't even remember. All I remember was alot of drumming. Oh yea Easter was great. My mom makes so spoiled though, she got me and dvd and a game! That's like 60 bucks! Hey not my fault I'm spoiled. I got Metal Gear Solid Twin Snakes and RUSH IN  RIO! Jesus that's the best concert I've ever seen. I'm too obsessed with them but they are so good, so unique, all their songs so catchy, it's crazy. Ok so that's it. Bed time...then school. Bye.   Check  urlLink this  out, it makes you think, the superior is watching us. The Matrix...or something similiar to it. Also saw some really funny pics with that pic all of you have seen with the tourist guy on top of the twin tower with the plane coming...well he was basically in the picture of every human disaster dating back to Hindenburg and Titanic...and the matrix!  urlLink This  is awesome also...remember that huge black out we had?   "A quantum leap forward in time and in space. The universe learned to expand." - Rush You know what's great about Rush, Neil Peart writes the lyrics and Geddy sings them, Alex too. Neil is a scientific genius, who has a dramatic life, and writes lyrics about weird stories and science and all. He's also one of my idols.

I woke up at 9 and Chris woke up at 12. I got no sleep. I went to Guitar Center and bought some sticks, bass drum pads and A COWBELL! I know how awesome is that. I played some drums with the cowbell it sounded so cool. I'm really tired. Bye.

      It's been 4 days and a shit load has happened. I don't want to mention what I did the other day but I was a naughty boy, if you wanna know personally im me. It involved an...well no I can't say. It involved the po-po. And Eric walking from the crime scene, and us video taping it, the glory of Jimmy laughing while running from the crime scene. Dan was there too. Ok, that day kicked ass, Christian my across the street neighbor (who we believe has a part of his brain missing) tried to attack us with bats and lacrosse sticks but we shoved bowling balls up their asses...what? OK. Anyways. this vacation is kicking ass, band practice is fun. We're trying to make a long story song but it's not working out too well but it was good anyways. Last night I went to the mall with Heaton to buy Revolutions on DVD but mainly to meet Keith and Steve at Friday's where they told the waitress it was my birthday and they brought out the apple crisp on me. It was dandy. We slept in a tent at Keith's, I froze my ass off. The next day we helped transport their secret fort up in the woods with Matt Butera aka mole. Then I left, the rest of the day just drummed my ass off. From like 3 to 8:30. Yea. I'm insane. Insanely stupid that is. Then I watched part of Sandlot and Old School with papa. Now I'm tired and I'm going to bed.

      YES! THE SPRING BREAK! Ok, I'll sum of what happened during the week. My drum teacher never came and never called back. Odd. I finally got the AP Euro project done with Matt and the rest of my group. Oh this is Saturday night but because its after 12, it's considered Sunday. It's also Day Light Savings Time. Yea...so Friday (yesterday) I hung out with Justin and Matt and slept over Matt's. Then the next day Jay came to Matt's and we spent a good time going down his steps on bean bags. Damn what fun, but it hurt. Tom (Matt's brother) had gone down and hit his head against the railing and then the ground and then when he was on the ground in pain and Callie (their dog) comes over and starts humping him. I hadn't laughed that hard in a while. I laughed so hard I almost fainted literally, I started fading out but then I caught my breath. Funny because I told Matt I'd stop laughing forever because I'd gain weight if I did. Laughing makes you lose weight? Oh yea, earlier in the day Matt's brother, PJ, and I threw the bean bags over ourselves and Callie humped us. It was good fun at the Kaiser's. I went home, took a shower, drummed for a good amount of time and was amazed at some of the things I was doing, then went to see HellBoy with Jay, Jared and Matt. Horrible. Just horrible. But it was fun. Right now I'm close to fainting, so tired. Tomorrow, well today, I think the band is gonna do some hard practicing to prepare for the recording we supposedly doing this vacation. Well, it's time for my departure. Many combulations Elizegurth.

      "I push my fingers into my eyes  It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache  But it's made of all the thing I have to take  Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside  If the pain goes on I'm not gonna make it." - Slipknot  I love that song so much. That's a song you can keep listening to without getting sick of. Ok, so today, nothing in school. Just hurt my back a little moving the wrong way, yea I'm weak and old. I think it's because of the heavy backpacks we have to carry around. Also because I never exercise, well I do...just rarely but if drums count that means I'm always exercising. I took a nap after school. Later I drummed, had Chinese food and watched Finding Nemo with my mom. It would be better watching it with my dad. It's kind of a movie to make dad and son love each other. Not that I don't already. But it's a happy movie and I see me as Nemo and father fish as my dad and then I think I should listen to my Dad more often and respect him more. I try my hard. I should try my hardest. Ok that's all. As James says, "BAI."

      This true story made me mad at the mean teachers. Don't listen to everything your teacher tells you. Keep your phone on vibrate and when it rings and it's your mom or dad or relative, answer it. Screw what the teacher says. And if they try to take it from you. Throw a pen at their eye...here it is.  "Last Friday in English class, this kid's cell phone rang. My school's strict about cell phones so my English teacher went over to him right away. My English teacher told the kid to take it out, so he did, but he answered it too. All he said was "Hello?" because my English teacher grabbed it out of his hand. So whoever was calling kept doing it for a while until my teacher turned the phone off. So on Monday when everyone went back to school, we found out the kid's dad died and it was him who called him during class asking his son where his heart pills were."  Ok, so besides for the gay chunkling of 2 weeks left of school, this weekend was fun. Saturday was a band practice with Paul, James and Heaton. We got down All Downhill From Here (New Found Glory) perfectly. Sounds really good. We also tried to do Carousel but it's hard to here the singing and we don't really know the complete order and it's very fast. We're gonna do Message In A Bottle (Police) and some other good songs and hopefully we can perform in Battle of The Bands coming in August I think. Then Sunday I hung out with Heaton and played Metal Gear Solid all day. Today, nothing.

      Holy shit tonight was awesome. But first I have to mention yesterday in gym this kid threw a water bottle at a goose and it fell on the ground and layed there for like 10 seconds and then ran away all weird. It was the funniest gym experience ever. Ok so back to this night. BANDS OF THE BULL. I only watched a few bands. It was very annoying when Aftermath came on and little freshman faggets were standing up talking and not caring. Alot of girls in my grade too. So I stood up and said SHUT UP AND LISTEN TO THE MUSIC OR GET THE HELL OUT. I hate them. The freshman are just annoying freshman, they can't help it but the girls in my grade, GOD! They completely ignores the band and talks standing up in the middle of the row. Why are they there you ask? Because their lives are pointless. Anyone who doesn't have music in their life has pretty much a pointless life. Music or sports which is why do drums, it's music and it's athletic...sort of. So...I performed for Black Magic when they sang Come Together I sang the chorus. Then Justin Schreck never showed up for Aftermath which has an incredible singer. Candice, she's a goddess and so much power in her voice, she should do American Idol. Anyways, Justin didn't show up to sing Enter Sandman by Metallica with her so she just yelled at for anyone to come up and sing with her. So I ran up and people followed me and I grabbed the mic. It was godlike. Being on stage is awesome. Candice sang this one song that sounded so professional it was unbelievable. And also there was a random drum ensemble and I played a recyclying bin with a mallet and at the end they hit a huge gong. I hung out with Heaton, James, Paul, Steve, Rob, Dan and other people. Tomorrow should be awesome. It's gonna be me, Heaton James and Paul tomorrow night in our new band. YES.

      I don't feel like saying goodbye today in this blog, just remember that so you're not like WHAT THE SHIT, WHERE'S THE GOODBYE? WHERE'S THE GOODYEAR BLIMP? Not funny. Those blimps, I love seeing them at Yankee Stadium. When I say Yankee I really mean Shea because I've been to Shea like 10 times and Yankees once yet I like the Yankees alot more. Yep all the news is, bad news bad news, death, violence, war. You know what I think, I starting to think that my former life or soul was bad in his world which is a heaven compared to this world and when I died my soul drifted into hell. This is hell. No just joking. But maybe I believe it symbolically, not literally...ANYWAYS. Besides for the fact that I keep seeing war on the news (Israel drops bombs killing children?) I have only one, well two things to say about today. No homework. 5 hours of drums. Greatness. That was three, does greatness count? I think so because it's one of those adjective nouns. Yea so that's it. I play like a German now. I learned how to play drums like a German, no joke...it's all in the hand formation. Just walk up to me and say GERMAN FORMATION and I'll Germanly Formanize entertainment for anybody's pleasure. In other words, I'll show you the German hand formation, alot better for bouncing the stick. Uh...what else, ah yes also learned difficult beats with the high hat hit on the quarter note up beats, yea it's hard. Try it. Count 1+2+3+4+ and keep counting and then tap your right hand on the +s and your left hand on the 2 and 4. Now go crazy with your right foot (NO DON'T JUST WIGGLE IT TAP YOUR FOOT AGAINST THE FLOOR WITH MUCH VARIETY). Drumming indeed takes much coordination. All together 6 body parts if you count the brain and your voice if your singing at the same time. 6 body parts coordinated all together! Remember what I said, read the first sentence of the blog. That's right you arshole.

      LONG ISLAND DRUM CENTER NIGHT OF DRUMMING PART II KICKED ASS!!! I almost caught the drummer from Ozzy, Whitesnake and Aerosmith's drum stick but it flew over my head and one landed the seat in front...and the raffles seemed to be the numbers around mine, so I'm the bad luck in the middle...but I got plenty of souvineers. Ya know, a LIDC hat, Zildian and Yamaha stickers, Sonny Emory and JR posters. All cool. But JR is scary looking so I'm not hanging him up. I hung Sonny up next to my drums because he was awesome. He was my favorite out of all three. He's from Earth Wind, and Fire and Steely Dan. This guy was amazing and since today some drummer like Elvon or something died he dedicated his life with this wackly sick ass drum solo that was like 20 minutes long. He was great. All funky and fast, the way I like em. So that's it for today. Can't wait for Friday, Bands of The Bull...it's gonna be fun helping the drummers set up, playing on all their equipment "to test if it's working" and hopefully you'll all see me perform. Certain people aren't sure if we're doing it yet but if we do I think it's gonna be during intermission. Ok, so until tomorrow, this is Wolf Four News...I am so lame.

      Today, the band came over and we invited Matthew into our band. Schreck came over also. We finally finished the long song which has no name yet because Gavin has to write the lyrics because he needed to the hear the song first to write it. It's gonna be a story song. There's alot transitions and I think it's a mix of Tool/Korn/Rush/Coheed. Oh yea Jimmy came over too. Don't worry Heaton and James and whoever else...we still exist. I still can't wait for Heaton's brother to come home because Heaton said he's amazing and it's always fun to jam with amazing guitarists. Paul is really good too. Maybe he'll end up joining that band. 2 bands...very confusing and now with Matt in SSM, it's very odd. Not sure if it'll last but for now it's good. Ok, so nothing new, drummed my ass off today, really tired now, goodnight.

      Yesterday I hung out with James, Paul C and Kaiser and we ended up going to my house and jamming. Paul's an awesome guitarist. Then I went to James' house and slept there. We were gonna see The Day After Tomorrow but then we found out it isn't coming out till the 28th, silly me. Heaton loves destruction and so do I, I'm not sure about James but this movie is gonna be a real treat..who says that. Today I mowed the lawn. Got shorts at Macy's. Drummed for a while, had alot of fun too for some reason. There's days where I'm in the mood and others when I'm not. Well tonight I was and now I'm gonna be all ready for tomorrow's band practice. Whooping. Which reminds me, entensity.net made fun of the decapitation video by making it all Mortal Kombat like with SUB ZERO WINS and WHOOPING, the funny part is it actually fits, the masked Iraqi holding the guys head...ok that's sick, different subject. Ah yes, I came up with a good idea today. I want to either make one war movie with the beginning sad and evil and the end all happy or two movies one being pro war and one being anti war and posting them both on a website and putting Rush's quoted below them both saying about 2 sides that can't be decided on which one to stick with, which one seems better, Republican and Democratic because now the difference between them both is mainly pro and anti war. I don't want the war. Yet I also wanna kill some of those Iraqis after seeing that decapitation video and of course that only fueled some of the sick thoughts I had about killing those "aliens." But I guess we're aliens too. We're not acting human. Or maybe we are because mankind loves war it seems. Maybe aliens are the good ones, yea that's probably it. Anyways I want to put the song "Cygnus X-1: Book II Hemispheres" by Rush in the video I'm making (collecting a bunch of movies and pics from the internet) because this song is all warlike at first and everything is corrupt and human keeps debating over love or reason and then the god of balance comes (Cygnus) and makes the world happy.  "We can walk our road together If our goals are all the same We can run alone and free If we pursue a different aim Let the truth of love be lighted Let the love of truth shine clear Sensibility Armed with sense and liberty With the heart and mind united in a single Perfect Sphere"  Overall, I think war is not the solution. We can pull ourselves together can't we? AH LIGHTNING OUTSIDE!!!!!!! I LOVE STORMS!!!

      Today was happy, a recovery from crappy yesterday. Teachers were nice today, that freshman class I have, I actually got something done and I'll be all caught up by tomorrow. I had a little bit of homework so basically this day has been very happy. I'm gonna play CS now and then drums. Tomorrow night I think I'm going to see The Day After Tomorrow with James, Heaton and Rich and anyone else who wants to come. It's cool because we're seeing it and The Day After just reunited...I think I'm the only one that wants to keep it called The Day After. Actually I'm thinking of different names but according to James, Paul C would play guitar for us with Matt backup. We'll see what goes on. We're all a tremendous amount better than last year. Especially me. I sucked last year because I hadn't play drums alot and then I got back into it, an average 5 days a week, and between 2 and 8 hours a day. I pulled off 8 on a weekend once. Crazy. Speaking of averages I'm gonna be posting in here alot more, hopefully daily because I want the average posts a week to increase. I don't know why. Bye.

      Today really sucked. Here's why. School. I withstood another day of 4th period with that retarded freshman art class where I had to make a fuckin clay panda but it didnt work so my teacher was bitching to me and if my gpa lowers because I can't build things out of clay I'll march into the school with that clay...along with a few wires (C4). Bastards. I'm so sick of school. It's almost done. The hapiness during the summer. The relaxation. The ability to go in my cousin's pool like twice a week, go to the beach, go into town, hang out with friends non-stop and play drums non-stop. I have a busy and fun schedule this summer. It's gonna kick some ass, actually no, it's gonna kick all of the ass. Not just one cheek. So ignoring the fact that I fantasized about the summer all day, this day also sucked because of seeing the American civilian decapitation FULL VIDEO (Yes the one that made front page) with those disgusting sand crawlers speaking out of their ass as they read an anti american text right before they killed him. The result, I screamed out my window "FUCK THIS WORLD" and starting attacking my mom. Well not really but I was pissed. My mom was telling me to calm down and all and I kept punching the walls and jumping up and down because seeing that really makes you wanna march into Iraq and set off a nuke because after we bomb their ass, there's no more threat but of course after this whole thing is over some other war will occur. Adults really suck, they're the ones being immature and fighting this pointless war and they tell us how to behave. So this world will never have real peace because our primitive cerebrums just cannot understand the human body yet. Maybe one day according to Karl Marx, history will stop, no events will occur and life will be the same thing over and over again. Why? Because one day after so much history, people will learn and understand the mind. Who knows. I think that's retarded but if there is one day total peace it will be set by future technology I think. Ah this is all stuff I've already explained so I'm gonna stop and just pity all of you for not being like me. Well I'm sure there's alot of peacemakers out there, not the bomb, the person. I mean most of this state is Democratic peacemakers because we're very well educated and alot of us New Yorkers are athiests including myself. The south is a different story. That's why there's war! RELIGION! Maybe it would be good if Jesus were to come right now to prove the Muslims wrong but of course Jesus isn't real so that can't happen. Well some fuckin god should show up and prove everyone's religion wrong and make everyone love each other and there'd be one religion. Anyways, I pity the people who can't keep peace, who seems to need war, to love war for some very strange reason, why? I don't understand the world at all. Maybe I should ignore it all and realize I'm going to fucking deep into this shit and I shouldn't worry because this is America, I'm safe and happy here where people are civilized. I must realize, that country is filled with beings that were once human. They aren't anymore. They used to be when they weren't filled with hate and death. Now they're aliens, disgusting scum of the earth. OK SO FORGETTING ABOUT THE WAR, I'm also mad because today I didn't have time to drum because I spent too much time playing with my record player trying to play Stairway to Heaven backwards, couldn't get it. I was playing around with it today listening to old Led Zep record such as "Houses of The Holy" and "Zoso" or whatever (Stairway To Heaven album). Fun. Now I'm clueless and can't figure out what to do. Perhaps Counter-Strike or Metal Gear Solid. Haven't played that game in a while. Or maybe just cruise the e3 on www.nintendo.com for more awesome new games. Goldeneye 2?! Awesome.

       urlLink Zelda ...I don't believe it. All this time, we've been waiting. All the way since Nintendo 64, the thought of Zelda with cutting edge GCN graphics instead of Wind Waker's cell shaded toon graphics. I didn't believe it at first until I saw the video and pictures and heard Mr. Nintendo officially announce the title at e3 this year. Just like Ocarina of Time, this will probably end up being the best game of the console. I'm so excited. Now I can't wait for the Rush concert and the release for this game. Not only the next Zelda but also Metroid Prime 2:Echoes, Resident Evil 4, multiple Donkey Kong games, another gameboy Zelda game (Minish Cap), Star Fox and a new hand held system called Nintendo DS with graphics better than N64...here's the e3 site.  urlLink CLICK!  Ok so besides e3 excitement, nothing else happened today. Well I took a really hard math test today and an extremely easy Italian test. I have to catch up in English with The Glass Menagerie but I don't want to, I hate plays, I hate books! So I'm just gonna get answers from someone tomorrow. Drum lessons were fun. I watched The Hulk, pretty good movie. Just not enough action but there was too much thinking involved. When I got home I also found this game called AIR STRIKE, it's free and it kicks ass, if you want it im me. Ok I'm gonna pass out soon so I need to sleep. Goodbye.

      Hey I'm liking how they updated this blogger thing and now I have a much bigger selection of looks for the site. Cool. Uh...yesterday was Mother's Day. My cousins came over. We played outside with this long table cloth jumping through it and going under this gigantic construction cone and when cars come I'd walk across the street but all they saw is a moving cone. And perhaps a few feet. That's right bet you didn't see that one comin, I'm a real life pokemon. Then I was completely wrapped in table cloth and I looked like one of Osama's ladies. Very grand. We watched some Three Stooges, then everyone left. Today, I don't remember, nothing good, fell asleep I think 4 times in school today and then I got home and passed out. Didn't get to practice my drums today but I will all day tomorrow along with lessons. Ok bye.

      I am so happy. The AP Euro exam is over though I did bad on it, I'm so glad it's done with and so is NYSSMA so the rest of the year is a breeze except stupid regents which will be easy compared to this exam I took which I didn't even get to finish the multiple choice questions...80 questions in 55 minutes?! BULLSHIT! This fucking world expects too much from us. Ya well you can thank the Asians. The Asian youth is rapidly and since the Asians are hella smart, they make school harder. Maybe I enjoy being ignorant, ok? Damnit I want to be Asian. Oh yea, the other day's post of that song, at the end everything becomes all happy and peaceful, WHICH SHOULD OCCUR IN THIS WORLD! Hopefully with our future technology it will. Anyways, I'm glad the stress is done with and now I can go back to the regular school routine. School, homework, drums, sleep, and again and again and again until the summer when I'm gonna have drums, friends and a job. But maybe without the job, considering I want this summer to be relaxed and free. Maybe I'll work with Mike caddying. Or perhaps Brooksite pizza place down the street or maybe at Stop and Shop or Walbaums. I need to turn 16 also. And I also need to become a professional drummer. Yea, that's all, this weekend should be good. Now here are some great links.  The  urlLink British  can help you with your homework. Ring Ring Ring Ring Ring  urlLink Banana Phone  WARNING: WILL NOT LEAVE YOUR HEAD ONCE YOU HEAR IT!  urlLink Arnold  and Asians, YES! If you have my kind of stupid humor, you'll love the  urlLink clay .

      "Cygnus X-1, Book II: Hemispheres" by Rush  [I. Prelude]  When our weary world was young The struggle of the ancients first began The gods of love and reason Sought alone to rule the fate of man  They battled through the ages But still neither force would yield The people were divided Every soul a battlefield  [II. Apollo / Dionysus]  [Apollo: Bringer Of Wisdom] 'I bring truth and understanding I bring wit and wisdom fair Precious gifts beyond compare We can build a world of wonder I can make you all aware I will find you food and shelter Show you fire to keep you warm Through the endless winter storm You can live in grace and comfort In the world that you transform'  The people were delighted Coming forth to claim their prize They ran to build their cities And converse among the wise But one day the streets fell silent Yet they knew not what was wrong The urge to build these fine things Seemed not to be so strong The wise men were consulted And the Bridge of Death was crossed In quest of Dionysus To find out what they had lost  [Dionysus: Bringer Of Love] 'I bring love to give you solace In the darkness of the night In the Heart's eternal light You need only trust your feelings Only love can steer you right I bring laughter, I bring music I bring joy and I bring tears I will soothe your primal fears Throw off those chains of reason And your prison disappears'  The cities were abandoned And the forests echoed song They danced and lived as brothers They knew love could not be wrong Food and wine they had aplenty And they slept beneath the stars The people were contented And the gods watched from afar But the winter fell upon them And it caught them unprepared Bringing wolves and cold starvation And the hearts of men despaired  [III. Armageddon: The Battle Of Heart and Mind]  The universe divided As the heart and mind collided With the people left unguided For so many troubled years In a cloud of doubts and fears Their world was torn asunder into hollow Hemispheres  Some fought themselves, some fought each other Most just followed one another Lost and aimless like their brothers For their hearts were so unclear And the truth could not appear Their spirits were divided into blinded Hemispheres  Some who did not fight Brought tales of old to light 'My Rocinante sailed by night On her final flight' To the heart of Cygnus' fearsome force We set our course Spiralled through that timeless space To this immortal place  [IV. Cygnus: Bringer Of Balance]  I have memory and awareness But I have no shape or form As a disembodied spirit I am dead and yet unborn I have passed into Olympus As was told in tales of old To the city of Immortals Marble white and purest gold...  I see the gods in battle rage on high... Thunderbolts across the sky... I cannot move, I cannot hide... I feel a silent scream begin inside...  Then all at once the chaos ceased A stillness fell, a sudden peace The warriors felt my silent cry And stayed their struggle, mystified  Apollo was atonished Dionysus thought me mad But they heard my story further And they wondered, and were sad  Looking down from Olympus On a world of doubt and fear Its surface splintered Into sorry Hemispheres  They sat a while in silence Then they turned at last to me 'We will call you Cygnus The god of Balance you shall be'  [V. The Sphere: A Kind Of Dream]  We can walk our road together If our goals are all the same We can run alone and free If we pursue a different aim Let the truth of love be lighted Let the love of truth shine clear Sensibility Armed with sense and liberty With the heart and mind united in a single Perfect Sphere  That's all I have to say. Oh, I got a 96 on NYSSMA, and my first drumset lesson was yesterday, somehow today I played like a god. Maybe the little practice sheets he gave me. Hmmm... Oh yea in the summer, fuck you all, I'm hanging out with my drums. The drums...outside...goody. Uh, what else...AP Euro Exam Friday, haven't started studying yet so that's gonna be my day tomorrow. CRAP. Well the hard work will soon be over. (=

      Friday, well sorta yesterday...once again typing late at night so it's really tomorrow...well Sunday but it's Saturday. Friday I did nothing. Just hung out with my drums. Saturday from 8:30 to 3:50 I had NYSSMA, working and then my solo at 3:45 and then at night I went to my cousins for my cousin's birthday. We had some fun. Went to the park, played some softball, played with Katie's ferrets, Dan threw toads at the park and at night we watched Disney's sing along tapes I haven't seen since I was like 5. And we watched Blair Witch Project. That movie sucks. I'm pissed after seeing  urlLink this  and  urlLink this .  urlLink This  was good though. I'm just sick of the retarded war. It's completely pointless. And if there's a draft I'll spit on the people who think they can bark orders at me. What am I fighting for? Religion, to prove a point? What because of 911? BIG FUCKING DEAL. So two towers fall down...that happens everyday in the middle-east. And you can thank the government for making Al-Queda do that to us. And the military goes in to justify, "TO MAKE THEIR COUNTRY A BETTER PLACE" That's not the real reason why. The reason is pure revenge, don't give in to Bush's bullshit. Give me a fucking break. Things were better when Saddam was there. People and buildings weren't getting blown up everyday until we came. We're making things worse, and of course the military and govt doesn't care, they want it because of sweet revenge. So to prove a point that we're the most powerful? To represent the bald eage? The stars and stripes? George Washington? Big deal. Nationalism can suck my dick. Why can't we just live normal and stop fighting each other for power. Why can't this world live where every country is happy and equal and there doesn't have to be military. War is pointless and alot of you morons have too much of a primitive brain like the government to figure out that war is completely POINTLESS AND RETARDED! We're fighting over nothing. Ah, there isn't gonna be a draft, I mean look at the force we put against the Iraqi people in those websites. It's horrible. There will be a time in the future where kids will learn the US to be the evil empire in their textbooks. Horrible, just horrible. Drafts are the most crazy thing ever. WHAT RIGHT DOES A GROUP OF MEN, OH IM SO SORRY I FORGOT YOUR THE GOVERNMENT! YOU MUST BE THE NEXT THING TO GOD. MORONS. THE GOVERNMENT IS FILLED WITH PEOPLE, NORMAL PEOPLE JUST LIKE US. You have freedom. A right to stand against the government. Don't let the government do what they did in our past wars. Don't let them destroy our society's emotions by taking away our loved ones and ruining families. War doesn't hurt us, but it hurts Iraqi families over there also, I used to not care but after seeing these pictures it makes me think, these people are people just like us. We're killing them all, the kids, the women, the men. This world seems to be falling apart yet it has always been like this. There will never be peace on earth. Unless...machines, they're perfect. Maybe we can be perfect if we have machines. Robots. Technology to keep peace. To maintain world order.

      What the fuck, we gave up Saddam? God damn I'm so confused. Give us Clinton back, and don't say he wasn't a good president, for all you homos out there that hate him just because of Monica, big fucking deal, it's called hormones and yes even the president has them. I mean for crying out loud look at Hillary, and you'll stop wondering why he had sex with Monica. Better that bush. Bush's face is turning more and more into a monkey. Anyways, yesterday was awesome. I slept at Mike's with James and Matt. We put shaving cream on Matt and humped him to death. He ended up going crazy on me and James. He tried to kill me but I put him down in a cop hold with his arms bent behind his back. This morning we persisted to tease him but I started to feel bad especially with that cute face so I stopped, and so did James...sort of. At around 2:30 we went to my house and got Paul, Ricky, Jon R and Jay H to play baseball at Brady park with us. After that, Jay, Jon and Heaton all went home and the rest of us went to Quiznos. Saw Arthus and he told me something so crazy "sicknasty" that if I told you, I'd have to kill you. It's confidential. Also saw Tom Kaiser, and Paul bought me a cookie and made it all cooked and he told the spanish guy to put a pickle in it and he goes "Pickle!? Ok!... Yea I like that shit too!" Haha, he's a funny spanyard. Then I went home. Went to the mall with my mom, got the new Rush FEEDBACK CD and my mom bought the new Aerosmith HONKIN ON BOBO CD with this free harmonica key chain. The price for it was messed up and it was cheaper than the normal version and we got it for 12.99 because they had to because that's what the label said...HA! Mamma also bought me a cinnamon pretzel and we also went to Carvel. Mommy is awesome. Oh yea we also went to Hot Topic and I got a Quagmire shirt and bought my dad an Orange County Choppers shirt for a late Father's Day gift. Ok bye.

      Today...drum lessons and then I drummed all day. Then watched Bruce Almighty with my dad. Jennifer Aniston is so beautiful, she makes me want to become an adult and have a wife and experience true love. I wish I can find someone like Jennifer and love now but I think it's impossible. Or maybe it isn't, I don't know...I just haven't found the ONE. I'm dying to find her. Damnit GROW UP THOMAS!

      Played bass drum with my band in this morning's Senior Graduation Ceremony...it sucked. Then I went to my cousin's house for her graduation. We went in the pool, I talked to Matt (my cousin's boyfriend) about drums (he drums too) and how he did YYZ with his friends for the talent show...I have to do that definetly. Ok and uh...what else...oh yea I looked at the year book and watched the Yankee game. Ate some cake, was raped by my 22 year old cousin and watched him set off fireworks and then I jumped into the fireworks and dodged them and rolled like an agent...my family cheered with joy and said I should become a stunt double. That's right. Bye.

      Mowed the lawn, bike rode with my dad who's on a new diet!, then drums for a while (learned an extremely hard Latin beat called Cassara), then hung out with Schreck and Kaiser. Schreck burnt me all the Metallica cds and let me borrow the Metallica & San Francisco Orchestra DVD (AWESOME THANK YOU JUSTIN!!!) and then we biked around. The end. Well now I'm gonna go hang out with my papa. TV time.

      In the summer, there's plenty of time to write a shitload in this thing but who would want to when the summer should be spent else where besides the blasted computer. Ok, today. I went to Alex's house with Tom and Matt. Then we picked up this girl Michelle, then we went to the mall. Then back to Alex's. Then to Nate's. Then back to Alex's. Had pizza. Came home. Fun day. Got home around 8:30 I think. Then I chirped out my window and Ahmad and Mal greeted me over to Jim's. The gang was there with a poker night and the fish were fresh out of the sea. Six tea biscuits settle down on go. Jimmy has a girlfriend, awesome. She's in my grade, I forget her name. Yea, we decided to reunite Capture the Flag on roller blades at St. Andrew's and football. If this is true, this summer will truely kick some cheek pads.

      Oh man Tower of Power is fun to listen to...soul funk is fun. Today was good, first full day of summer. Oh...fuck I'm writing too late again, ok, it's actually the 23rd because once again I'm writing after midnight. Band practice outside today, it was awesome. We played Slither from Velvet Revolver and that's about it. Uh...what else, after band practice, Matt and I just rode bikes around and listened to Aerosmith. Damnit I definetly wanna go see them next year. Now here's Tom with war views.    urlLink Look  at the second picture down. War shouldn't exist. No son should be held from his father, but that's the way we roll our bones. I tear when I see that picture. I'm sick of it all, I'm sick of all the humans in the world that turn this world bad. Why are we fighting? Why are the Iraqis killing hostages? Why are there dictators? Why was America seduced into an Arms Race? Why are there conflicts? Fuck it all, you know what keeps me happy...THE FUNK AND SOUL...I STILL BE DIGGIN ON JAMES BROWN!!!

      Things That Are Gonna Make This Summer Kick Ass 1 - Rush concert 2 - Band Performances, especially the block party and BoTB 3 - Driving 4 - The Softball League 5 - Traditional homerun derby and town cruisin' 6 - Montauk, Robert Moses, other beaches 7 - Partying with friends and cousins 8 - Reunited Capture The Flag  NICE, well the last test was today..Italian Regents, crap. I drummed after that. Then I went to my cousin's house, the Maclay's and took my aunt and my cousin Ryan with my mom to the pizza place, got some pizza and then headed over to Jones Beach to see AEROSMITH!!! Man that was a great concert. Gets you pumped and all, especially Love In An Elevator. Oh and Steve Tyler and Joe Perry are feminine skinny make up 60 year old men. It's crazy how they look like they're 40 or even 30 and the make up and hair makes em look so much younger. They have like skinny girl bodies, it's freaky but they're awesome. And the confetti and lights were great. The Cheap Trick band that opened for them wasn't that good...the weather turned out being great. Thunderstorms my eye. After the concert Ryan and I just basically discussed the upcoming Jones Beach shows and bands and stuff, then we dropped em off at their house, and then my mom and I went to 711. I got a Kiwi-Strawberry Slurpee and a Chicken Faquita or something...something Mexican. Now I'm adapting to the calm silence in my house compared to the Aerosmith concert. Now I have to go to the bathroom...goodbye.

      Ok, today is really the 20th but I'm writing this at midnight so it's technically the 21st but in reality, it's the 20th. Father's Day today. Went to the Troiano's...that's my cousin's last name. We did stuff. You know, stuff. Watched Family Guy. And when Jenna's boyfriend came over he brought his tape of him and some other dude in a Jazz Ensemble drum-off and Matt owned the other kid. It was cool. Gets me psyched for next year if I ever compete in a drum-off. Jazz Ensemble I shall do next year. So, uh...what else. That's basically it for the Father's Day. Oh, my dad got a cooler. I forgot what happened yesterday. I don't remember much. Well I'm sick of the news always having shit about the hostages. Oh man, I'm sick of these towel covered bastards, why doesn't America stop being so cuddly and nice, find those mother fucking pussies, and torture them all to death and tape it and show everyone. I mean, what's with the covered faces, they're the biggest pussies ever, they can't show their faces to America. I mean if we're there in Iraq, for godsake do it for a better cause, stop bombing innocent towns and go find some of those hostage holding pussy inbred son of a bitch monkey sucking ball tapping bastards and kill em.......did I say ball tapping?

      Wow, the tests have all been very easy so far, except math, that was kind of hard but I think I got a B, maybe C...I'll be happy with a C. Majorly happy with a B. English was hilarious, Global Regents was a joke, Bio Regents was easy, took that today. All I got left is my Italian Regents. Bad news. Yesterday I got my braces on and I look like a fool. I've already had bottom braces a while back but now I have them on top and bottom and it kills and my lips and gums are all cut up. I also have to eat rice pudding for the next day or two. After I got my braces on, I hung out with Paul, Matt, Ricky, Crystal, Nicole L, Alyssa something and Ray H. I also got this Jew Camp thing in the mail and on the cover was a few jews I know water rafting...Jake, Jeff and Shawn. I showed it to everyone, especially Paul, loved it. I also had a great introduction for Matt as I dressed as Neo and stood in the middle of the raining foggy road to re-enact the Revolutions SUPER BURLY BRAWL. It was fun. Then I wrestled Matt with him wearing a South Park (Stan) mask and Michelle Downing drives by and gives us the finger, *shivers*...creepy. Girls and ray went home. I was depressed because the girls made Crystal come with them and she was gonna play Twister and I was all ready for a really fun game. Then we went to my house for a bit. Then it was just Heaton and I, and we watched parts of Signs but then his brother came so I watched T3 with my parents and then Paul came to study for BIO with me. I have never laughed this hard in my life. I was tearing like crazy. Paul and I have never laughed this hard. Paul told me about how Anthony Calandrino was chosen to answer a multiple choice in Mrs. Laird's Bio class. Anthony goes, "The answer is B...Sausage." Part of why it was so funny was the way Paul said it and the time it was at night. Ok, so after laughter to the heavens, Paul went home. Today after the Bio Regents, I hung out with James and Paul and jammed with them for a bit. Then went to Boyz Day with Matt and Jon, it was ok...I think we missed the good part of it all but last year definetly was better. Kao drove us around, it was awesome. Jon, Matt and I also went into town for some ices. When Jon went home, Matt and I went to James' where I recorded with Paul New Found Glory - All Downhill From Here. No singing because it was late at night at James' voice was raspy. Then I left, oh and I forgot to mention it was raining pianos and bricks at like 7, it was awesome. It reminded me of the time when Pat, Dan, Jimmy and I went outside when it was the hardest rain down pour ever and we ran to Eric's. Oh, another god damn beheading in Iraq. I'm so sick of those fucking assholes. I was thinking about writing a book about a soldier who loses his mind in war, kills a bunch of boys and girls and just kills his way through a innocent town of Iraqis. Then he finally reaches the real Al-Qaeda and tears em apart. That would sell like crazy, but if I made it, someone might report it to the school or cops or something and knowing this gay ass soft country, certain people will think I need to seek guidance. Well fuck that. That's not the reason I'm not writing it though. Personally, I'm not afraid to say Hail Hitler and say I'm gonna blow up the school because it's only words, and I'd hope the school saw it just so it scares those bastards. The reason I'm not writing the book is because I'm too fucking lazy. But why am I talking about blowing up the school, the school is a god compared to Iraq. Let's nuke em! Just think about the man who was beheaded had a wife and kids. Just imagine if that happened to your dad. Oh man, OOOOOH FUCKING MAN. I'd work out to be the strongest man in the world. Fight my way through a huge American arsenal building. Load up on weapons and get a small nuke and get my ass to Iraq and kill as many people as I could. The kids, the women, the men. Kill every one of them. Then Boom! Set off the nuke. But that's if my dad was beheaded and the only person I know that has a chance of getting capture and beheaded is my cousin who might be going to Iraq (Marine). NO, no way in hell he can get captured, what are the chances? Oh fuck this. Why am I talking about war again? I thought I was through with this shit. Ah, one more easy Regents on Tuesday, then summer is a callin! THIS SUMMER IS GONNA KICK SO MUCH ASS!  "All that we can do is just survive All that we can do to help ourselves is stay alive  Ragged lines of ragged grey Skeletons, they shuffle away Shouting guards and smoking guns Will cut down the unlucky ones  I clutch the wire fence until my fingers bleed A wound that will not heal A heart that cannot feel Hoping that the horror will recede Hoping that tomorrow we'll all be freed  Sickness to insanity Prayer to profanity Days and weeks and months go by Don't feel the hunger  Too weak to cry  I hear the sound of gunfire at the prison gate Are the liberators here? Do I hope or do I fear? For my father and my brother, it's too late But I must help my mother stand up straight  Are we the last ones left alive? Are we the only human beings to survive?" - Rush

      Woah haven't updated this in a few days. Ok, so Monday is the last weekend of school. Right now it's 12 at night so I'm typing this really in my mind Saturday but technically it's Sunday. Ok let's update the things that have happened the past few days. Friday, Mr. Ferrante let us watch Family Guy. I cleaned out my entire locker because the custodians are locked them all up after school. Friday, well sorta last night, I hung out with Heaton and James and Heaton's brother Bill who's awesome. We just did random things like play football with this really soaking wet water absorbent ball. Mike got a new computer. I played with his rabbit alot. We watched some Monty Python. I got to shoot his paintball gun. All these things I'm saying sound very weird. I played with his rabbit and got to shoot his paintball gun, oh I'm naughty. "Sex in the city, and I don't mean the show! Oh I'm just naughty, somebody spank me!" If I messed that quote up please tell me and I'll fix it. Haven't seen that episode in a while. I need to get the Family Guy DVDs. So last night was ok. Let's talk about Saturday, crazy day. Performed at Molly Blooms with Aftermath, we were great. My first show, there were like 5 people there so it wasn't very psyching but hell of fun. I love that band, they're all great people and so devoted. That's one of the few musically inclined bands in this school. Ok so after the show, Matt and I cruised around town on bikes and went to the pizza place on the corner of Brooksite and Main St., I think Schreck wants a job there too, if I get the job I'm gonna get Schreck in too. Then we biked to Matt's and just hung out there for a while. Then we went to his cousin Alex's. It was fun. What else, uh...yea that's basically it. Ok, for today...now I'm updating the post at 9 at night Sunday...today kicked ass. Smithtown Day. Pat, Mal, Eric and I went to Smithtown Day. We met Ahmad there and we all walked around together, got some Mr. Softee, Pat bought a Jesus watch and Mal bought some other watch. The highlight of the day was definetly watching this little kid dance next to this orchestra that played next to the library. He was like marching and dancing in place and making a "GET OVER HERE" gesture with his hand to some other kid. I saw little PJ with Linsday and her cousin (I think?) Also saw Matt with Ryan Monahan, haven't seen that kid since 7th grade. He moved. What a shame. That kid used to bounce off the walls, kinda like me. And uh...yea. So Matt had to unlock my bike from the chains at Quiznos because I left it at his house last night and he rode it into Smithtown Day. Who else did I see, Erin, JAMES, Ryan and his friend Dan from Sachem. Ok yea so we went back to Pat's house after Smithtown Day and watched Scary Movie 3. The deleted scenes are hilarious. You gotta see it. The Hulk shitting out an alien head and all the ring girls attacking Trinity and the midget ring girl gets kicked in the air. Some of the deleted things they definetly should have kept. Michael Jackson's laugh...ahhh. But I have to say the most uplifting part of the day was Ahmad teaching me Schism on the bass. I was so excited when I got the beginning down. Then I went home, drums for 4 hours or so...now I'm here. GETTING READY FOR THE LAST FULL DAY OF SCHOOL!!! YES!!!!!!!!!

      Ok, listening to alot of Aerosmith today. They're new song is awesome. Finally fixed my Windows Media Player. Got home from normal day of school, drummed my heart out. Then McDonalds, then dentist. Then back home and did some math homework. Nothing special, you know just another boring day except for the drums. Drums were fun. They never get boring. Tomorrow I'm going to Cory's for Aftermath practice to get ready for Saturday's show. Yes, this is my first show ever. I have never performed with SSM except for some adults at Dan's and besides that I've never performed. I'm excited, it's at Molly Bloom's, Saturday at 2. We got a good setlist and I think I'm prepared for it all, the rest of the band is. Funny, the first performance I ever do isn't even with my band. I'm replacing their drummer Ryan because he's on vacation somewhere. Well after this performance, the summer is near and my band should kick it up a notch along with other side bands I'll be playing in. I can't wait, I finally get to play in front of people, well besides my friends and family that have already heard me. I wonder if SSM will have alot of shows this summer, cough cough. We're all lazy and never plan any shows but this summer I'll get us some shows with the help from Schreck. (= Well for sure, I'm playing at Battle of The Bands, there's no way I'm missing that performance. If my band doesn't wanna do it, I'll do it with other people, I'm not missing this event. Also, I hear Matt C is having a crazy party with the guitarist from Dream Theater...at his house. Awesome. I guess I'm going, I think Schreck said to come because his band and all so if so I'll go. I wanna see this guitarist, I hear he's amazing and for everyone who doesn't know who Dream Theater is, it's a famous metal band but not that famous. They're f'ing weird, they do alot of Rush covers and all their songs are like 10 minutes of weird odd unexpected random things. Personally it doesn't catch my ears but it does have alot of talent. Ok well that's all for the musical lecture of today. Goodbye teacups.

      Today was just a normal day. Lunch detention with Ms. Baione, she gave me a bunch of papers to put in alphabetical order and when I finished she let me go! Wow so nice. I guess she's not that bad, I mean I guess I complained too much about her the other day. For crying out loud our homework is to bring in lyrics to our favorite song, how fun and easy. Band was fun, sitting in the chorus room and seeing if Kate G would go out with Anthony L (Frank Sinatra) but it didn't work. He thought he had her, haha. Anyways, Paul was being the typical horny deushbag and he told Kate he'd give her a dollar if she could get me a boner. So, Kate and I kinda ignored him considering we're practically best friends, I mean we are best friends. So yea she kinda just tapped that shit but not enough to bonerize me, perhaps semi boner...what am I talking about? Oh yea I forgot to mention that my parents bedroom, stairs, upstairs hallway and the attic are being redone and some dude fell through my attic and into my room, I wish I saw it. I was told his legs were dangling out of the hole so he didn't fall all the way through. My mom said my uncle did that once and needed help to get out, haha that makes me giggle. Yea so my parents room is all weird and tall, the ceiling is high up and slanted, it's weird. They're almost done with my parents room, then they gotta do everything else. Ah and drum lessons today. We spent time doing reading and playing on the pad. He gave me this crazy exercise that seems easy. It's called "Two to Fifty." It's for wrist development and concentration. Just play full quarter notes 2 measures left hand and then 2 measure right hand, then 4 and 4, then 6 and 6, then 8 and 8, then 10 and 10...all the way to 50 and 50 and the whole exercise takes about 40-50 minutes and if you mess up, back to the beginning. Trust me it seems easy but the counting is hard to stick with for all that time. Ok, that's all. Bye.

      Ok, the weekend was good. Uh, Spooner Street Mafia band practice on Sunday. That's all I remember. I hung out with Paul and Matt I think. Nothing special. Monday night. Tonight. Tonight was the concert and there ain't no cure for the summertime blues...can't wait for Rush's Feedback album to come out with all their 60's covers, yes. Anyways, personally I thought we could have done better but it was good. Someone stole my go-go bells (I call em go-go boots) so I had to use 2 different cowbells, sounded like crap or as Matt M says, "SOUNDS LIKE FUCK!" Haha. Anyways, yea so I played cowbells in Evita and cymbals in Finlandia (For The Russians!) Rich's girlfriend, Kira from Hauppauge was there. Bunches of other happy people. Bryan Retus is a good drummer. My ego shot up today but I think it's bullshit. My mom met Mrs. Kalabza today and she told my mom Mr. Caserta said I was the best drummer he ever heard (in Smithtown School Discrict I'm guessing). Yea ok...he was my private teacher a few years back but then I didn't know how to do squat. I wonder if what he said is true, what his reaction will be when he hears my present day drumming. Eh, I'm not that great. I mean I'm good. But nothing special. Maybe I'm like in top 20 drummers of Smithtown High School. Yea in fact I suck at drums. In fact I don't know what I'm talking about. But I'm gonna do jazz ensemble next year, I wanna play one of those jazzy solos...Buddy Rich style. So yea it was a good concert. Bryan Retus also played a little set for the orchestra's "Bohemian Rhapsody" which was pretty good. Pirates of The Carribean was great also and they played a song from Platoon but I don't know which one, my mom said it was from Platoon. Saw it a long time ago, all I remembered is it made me wanna kill an American soldier when he starts beating to death, a poor innocent Vietnamese kid with his rifle. Horrible, but sadly close to the Vietnam truth. I went to Carvel after it all. Uh, that's it. I'm thinking too much about joining the Jazz Ensemble next year, seeing Aerosmith and seeing RUSH!!! I saw the setlist, it might change for each show, lets hope they add Freewill when I see them. They're gods. Bye.

      Today English teacher was a bitch. You see there was this game for extra credit for the grammar test coming up. 2 teams, she had a bunch of cards with words on them. The team to make the most sentences with the cards wins. Mike's sentence was "The cats rode the spiders to fluffy." She accepts. Mine is "Two eggs of Talula quickly rode a shoe." She doesn't accept. Both of them are gramatically correct. Neither make sense in real life but that's not the point. She didn't give my sentence any points so I started to object her. And I kept nagging her to give me an answer to why mine was wrong. By the way I asked another English teacher if it was gramatically correct and it was. So my teacher just said drop it and wouldn't give me an answer so I said I'm right. Then she said everyone sit down I have to check these sentences. I sat down, turned around and starting talking to Bono and she yells at me saying DID I SAY YOU COULD TALK? WTF?! She never said I couldn't talk. That's not the end of it though, listen to this. She then goes just shut up. So it's all quiet, some people are talking but not out loud (either was I to Bono) and I call out to her, "Ms. Baione, who's Edmund Harrison?" (which I saw on the board) and she says "THAT'S IT! AFTER SCHOOL DETENTION MONDAY!" Two words. Bull. Shit. I'll talk her out of it and if she doesn't accept I'm going to the office to complain. There's no fucking way I can get in trouble for asking a teacher that question. There's no way I'm going to after school detention on Monday, she better either forget about it or change it to lunch detention, fucking dike. Then after school, I'm walking around and I see Schreck and Matt Mcdonough so I bang 4 times against the locker (Slayer song that grabs Schreck's attention) and then some teacher comes out and starts bitching to me. It's after school, who the fuck cares, is anyone working hard enough that they can't hear a couple of bangs on the lockers? Unless their in nerd club for after school where you do school work for fun after school which I don't think even exists. So this lady asks me what grade I'm in...what the fuck does that matter? Fucking retard teacher I wanted to spit on her. The lady teachers are just bitching. I fucking hate the school. Except Mr. Ferrante, he's god. But besides for him school blows. In a couple of weeks it'll all be done. I can't believe it. Summer is here. In a week school is over and testing begins which is no problem. The tests this year I can care less about. I don't care much about my grades anymore. Studying and trying hard isn't worth it, at least it's not for me. I enjoy drumming, and doing stuff with friends free from labor. Maybe I should drop out of school. Who knows, we'll see...maybe I won't even go to college. My dad didn't, but today without college, you can't get anything, this world sucks. School sucks. Why should teachers tell us what to do, it's not in their control, we're there to succeed to make livings, not to be repremanded, those bitches. Eh, why am I bitching, it'll be over soon and for 2 months the dreams I have at night about schools blowing up won't occur anymore because school won't be in my head. Freedom is the summer. Summer is freedom. Jesus I'm talking alot about nothing, so I'm just gonna cut down what I did today. Why do I always give these lectures in my journal, I'm supposed to explain what happens in my life, not what I hate. Hmmm...well it helps release my inner anger. Anyways, I'm cutting it down. Kaiser and I hung out today. Went to Quiznos to see Paul. Bumped into Eric, Luis and other people...that's all. "Bai."

      Ok, baseball during the summer. I guess I'm in. Lots of ladies doing it and I'm the master macker of the crue so I think I'm gonna do it for the ladies. If James doesn't do it, I probably won't. I'm not supposed to talk too much about this baseball League because it's sorta confidential for the people who weren't invited. Ah what the hell, it's stupid. It's just a bunch of Paul and Jared's best friends on a baseball team, woooo big secret. Anyways, excited that I'm going to see Aerosmith the 22nd (last day of testing) and I've been listening to alot of them lately, they're awesome. I took the speaking for Italian Regents yesterday and got a 23 out of 24. So happy it's over. That scared me but yet she's very nice when it's just you and her. And one of the things was we had to figure out a way how to get into Tom Cruise's pad while he was filming a movie. What else, uh...I learned awesome Brazilian Samba on my set. It took a half an hour or so do get down the fucking beat because its so complicated but it's fun when you get it down, just pop in a Ricky Martin cassette and bam, you're a pro. You know what I hate, scientist experiments on bunnies. Oh and look at the white bunny with a block dot, damn scientists and their bunny ice pack experiments. Scientists are cruel to bunnies, I wish I could stick a gigantic ice pack on a scientists pack and watch him/her get gangrene. Normally I don't care for animals except bunnies and penguins and some other things...some dogs. Every bunny deserves to live a happy nourished life in fields of wheat. Without gay ass cats that live across the street from you start attacking them. I wish I had a bb gun...oh Jared...Oh yea my nose just started randomly gushing blood today in English which was awesome and exciting and I started getting all jumpity because I never get a bloody nose and I never knew how much fun it is. First of all bloody noses don't hurt and second of all the blood just oozes out like your some kind of jellyman. The bad part was my teacher made me go to the nurse. I insisted I was fine. Jesus just a little bit of blood and that teacher freaks out. WEIRDED OUT. I'm freaking myself out because now I'm reading this over and I can't believe what I wrote. I'm a psycho. This summer is gonna kick ass. I really don't wanna get a job so besides job this is the line up...BASEBALL, DRUMS, FRIENDS. Good day to you too.

      Ok  urlLink this  is probably one of the funniest Homestars I've seen ever. And my favorite, I love Cheat Commandos and having Marshy in it just made me wet my pants a bit. What else...ah yes remember the clay guys that spilt the water? The same voices remake  urlLink Reloaded . Here's their  urlLink site ! So today, I got plenty of sleep and wasn't tired at all the whole day. I just made up a bunch of quizes and stuff because I was absent Thursday and Friday. Memorial Day was good, went to my cousins. Tomorrow I have to take the Italian speaking for the Regents, oh god I'm so screwed. My teacher is gonna make me piss my pants. But ah what the hell, 15 minutes of hell isn't that bad. That is all.

      Thursday was a crap band practice attempt. It didn't work. And this time it wasn't because of me. It was just because nobody enjoyed it. Nobody wanted to do it but me. Anyways, then Matt's brother stole everyone from my house except me and Heaton and so there was 2 sleep overs. One here and one at Matt's. I was told Paul kicked the shit out of Matt at Matt's. Awesome. In the morning Jay came to my house and us 3 (Heaton Jay and I) just hung out and I discovered that my old Creed cd (My Own Prison) which I ever barely listened to when I got it is awesome!!! I love it. It's exactly like Pearl Jam. Download "Sister." Best song ever. Oh and Jay showed me some 12 Stones. And Jay and I realized we're the same and know all the same songs and love the same music but the only disagreement we had was with girls. I don't know how it came up but I said Amanda Greco was extremely hot and he said no but Amanda if you read this don't get mad and kill Jay because he also said Avril Lavigne wasn't hot. Oh and Heaton went home and then Jay and I hung out with Dina Mullingbrook and this other girl Melissa...I don't why. Jay set it up. It was very funny. Too lazy to explain. Yea but, uh, we hung out at Starbucks and around town. I got my mom a coffee. She was happy. It was some weird cold coffee, the weirdest thing I've ever seen. A cold coffee. It looked like Pepsi but then I took a sip and I barfed. Well not really. Anyways!!!!...then Jay and I went to Paul's and then we went to my house and played some MARIO PARTY 5! Then everyone went home. TODAY, I went to my cousin Ryan's graduation party and got to ride a mini dirtbike around a huge field. It kicked ass. I want one so badly but they're expensive. And if I did get one, I'd have to take time away from my drumming. After Ryan's party we went to my cousin Katie's graduation party but didn't hang out with Britt or Kate at all because they had certain people in my grade over that I don't like...I'm not sure anyone likes em. So I hung out with Danny and Chris the whole time in the pool and ended up somehow enjoying throwing little children into the pool. They asked me to, but I enjoyed it. Another stress reliever. Well that's all of it. And it's August 1st...well this blog is being typed on August 1st but I changed the date to the 31st because really August 1st is now but I haven't gone through the day yet. I think I'm gonna go to bed now because I'm trying to wake up early so I have more of the summer days and less of summer nights. Ok, good bye and till tomorrow night or perhaps the next, or the next.

      I just gotta complain about the music companies again and shit for being bitches. Stand against those  urlLink RIAA  bastards! Why should we let a few big record labels start sueing us and take away our musical influence?! This is bullshit. Music should be free. Anyone that thinks different can die a long painful death for being so fuckin ignorant.&nbsp;  Ok now that that's out of the way...let's see what I did. I forget what I did this weekend. But Monday (yesterday) all I remember is I slept at Matt's at night and today had a&nbsp;softball game. We lost. Of course. The only 3 games I go to and it's against the college team, what a unprofessional recreation.&nbsp;Then Baja&nbsp;Grill and then a little tiny party at&nbsp;Matt's. Now I'm here, alone, depressed, worried that August&nbsp;is gonna fly by.)=&nbsp;

      Well yesterday was awesome. Started off with Matt and James coming over and then Heaton and then Paul and J came over and then we all walked to Maple and played baseball in the dark. There were 13 year olds we started to it on, major fun. We stopped playing when Paul being a stupid jackass threw the ball from outfield to home to get James out but the ball smacked him in the ear. Turns out he needs antibiotics and hurt his ear and crap. What are the chances but I said that was gonna happen. I said it in the beginning, and I knew it would happen when someone was running home. It was Heaton James and I and we crushed them. Heaton made an astonishing hit to outfield, good job ol chap. After the game Matt Paul and I slept at Hoffman's. Poor James couldn't because of his ear and he had to go to his mom's in the morning and poor poor Heaton was really sad he couldn't come because his mom was paranoid and didn't know who Jason was. We all felt really bad for Heaton. He was walking all slouched over and sad. )= But anyways, the night was awesome. We played on Jay's Guns N Roses Pinball machine which is addicting and so much fun. And we all talked about mackin Jay's sister to piss him off only I'd really mack it fo weel. We watched part of Apocolypse Now and I pointed out Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) is very skinny 20 year old in the movie and everyone was like OMG. We watched alot of late night porn shit that Jay gets on his tv, lucky bastard. Then the Ring. We also wrestled. I actually took down Paul! Then we&nbsp;stayed up until 4 in the morning crying of laughter.&nbsp;Next day, today...we just hung out and Matt and Paul went home and then&nbsp;Jay and I hung out and at night saw&nbsp;Born Identity&nbsp;with&nbsp;Jared and Ryan. It was fun. I&nbsp;saw Mrs.&nbsp;Kalabza. Now I'm tired and I'm gonna catch up on sleep considering last night I got 5&nbsp;hours. Tomorrow Kaiser's&nbsp;beach party? Yea I don't think so...nobodies going and the weather sucks. Wutevur, we'll see, bye.&nbsp;  AH I HAVE THE GUNS N ROSES PINBALL SOUNDS STUCK IN MY HEAD! FREIGHT TRAIN!...OF ALL THE BANDS IN THE WORLD, THIS IS DEFINETLY ONE OF THEM!

      I guess the show must go on. Asshole Americans don't give up. 911 happened 3 years ago, it's now time to move on and forget about how we could have fucking avoided it. What's the sense of doing all this investigation and court shit if it already happened. Just leave it alone America. Fucking let it be. What is there to do, arrest metal detector people? Exactly, they can't do that. They can't do anything about it. Even if they find someone's mistake for being held responsible for 911, it doesn't matter. It was everyone's mistake, us humans make mistakes. Ours was overestimating our security and letting things slide. I just hate people making all this fuss about it just so America has non-stop bad news going on because that's all everyone wants to fuckin hear these days. It's always bad news. How bout talking about the beauty of flowers and the sun or something or how to lose weight or something that makes people happy. Talk about little Johnny who was saved from a burning down building. Please, I'm fed up with depressing news in this fucked up world. Oh yes, and I new religion is that this whole world is mine. I own it all. My mind runs it all. You're all fake and imaginary and part of my mind. Only I am real existing in an outside world (similiar to the matrix) and all of everything else is fake. The only real thing is my mind. Fuck you all you simulators that don't even know you're simulators! YOU ALL THINK YOU'RE REAL!!! Haha, oh man its fun to piss people off. I bet everyone of you that's reading this is getting pissed off right now. But seriously I'm sick of bad news, not serious about the mind thing but bad news must stop. Everyone just fucking behave. haha...right. ANYWAYS, today I hung out with Paul and Ricky playing Homerun Derby and then went for some ices. Then I went out to dinner for my aunt's birthday to a gay restaurant that was pretty good. Indigo it's called and the 2 guys that own it used to own my aunt's house. I don't hate gay people anymore. In fact, they're very good people. They're very stylish and jesus they make houses so nice. I mean for my ocd, they're perfect people. They're all neat and good and stylish. But the clothes gotta go, but for a house design, I'm getting a gay guy to&nbsp;choose.&nbsp;The house my aunt lives in is so awesomely designed. And the restaurant too and the food was great. So thumbs up for gay people not being on my hate list anymore. Now I'm home listening to Under Pressure by Queen...love that damn song.

      I haven't been paying much attention to much of the Rush news lately but now I just found out Alex Lifeson (guitarist from Rush) is being put to court and could be sentenced 15 years at the most for aggravating violation of a police officer. You know what I think of that? Fuck the court, fuck the law, fuck the police, fuck the government, fuck all authority, help save Alex Lifeson from going to jail, make a stand against the "powerful." That's fucking bullshit. Oh big deal, so what did he do, push the cop? Alex wouldn't do anything lethal, he's a great and funny guy. So what, push a cop and get 15 years.&nbsp;But if he&nbsp;punched out some random bum, it would just be a fight...that's it, no penalties. What makes a cop so much more powerful, they have&nbsp;more rights that us? What if you attack a cop&nbsp;you get in more trouble? That's bullshit. Just because he's trying to justify the law,&nbsp;don't give me that bullshit.&nbsp;The cop Alex touched was not&nbsp;justifying any law.&nbsp;And maybe it's not even the cops fault. Maybe it's the pussy ass government&nbsp;we have that has a law&nbsp;for everything.&nbsp;I bet Alex was having fun in some house getting drunk on New Years and then the cops&nbsp;crashed the party so Alex&nbsp;did something. Who fucking cares. You gonna give a man 15 years for being drunk and messing around with a cop. What the fuck is with this world. We need some NEW WORLD ORDER!!! That's right you heard me.&nbsp;If some school principal or government figure saw this, I'd be screwed because we&nbsp;truely don't&nbsp;have the right to say things&nbsp;like this.&nbsp;We are told we have the rights. But we don't. Well I'm making my own fucking rights and life. Look at Martin Luther King, he sure&nbsp;had the&nbsp;right.&nbsp;Of course it's our right for freedom of speech&nbsp;but everyone knows there's major consequences. What's so free about that? I'm sick of hearing about law and order from dick heads that are only human just like you and me.&nbsp;SO RISE WITH ME! SOMEONE TAKE A STAND WITH ME! AND GET RID OF THIS FUCKING WORLD AND CREATE A NEW....WORLD.....ORDER!!!!!!!!!!!! &nbsp;Does anyone hear me!? Rise my people. RISE!&nbsp;Get rid of our fuckin government and create a government that is REALLY FREE. THIS COUNTRY IS NOT FREE. WE HAVE LAWS OVER EVERY FUCKING ASPECT OF LIFE. Someone get Queer Eye For The Straight Guy gay guys to go over to the whitehouse and ass rape every stupid politician including Mr. Monkey himself, Bush. Ok that was fun. I'm done ripping on our country.

      Ok, so...nothing much today. I mowed the lawn but before that I had drum lessons! I have this lesson and then an hour long lesson (as opposed to the normal 30 minute lesson) next Monday or sometime so he can give me a shitload of stuff to work on during the August break. I'm sure gonna miss lessons. Well&nbsp;he'll be back in September. Great lesson today, I learned how to read sixteenth rests and&nbsp;my reading is well improving because&nbsp;I'm going through alot of reading with all these books.&nbsp;All I need to do is get reading down, which is hard for me because I'm an idiot. I just figured out a good method...count 1 e&nbsp;+&nbsp;a 2 e + a 3 e + a 4 e + a...HAHA I'M AN&nbsp;IDIOT. But it's hard count while playing, I&nbsp;gotta practice that.&nbsp;Fortunetly with the drums I&nbsp;just play whatever&nbsp;and it comes&nbsp;natural.&nbsp;Besides for reading, today I practiced alot of open handed&nbsp;beats which is opposite of crossed, instead of right hand on hi-hat and left hand on snare,&nbsp;I have my left hand on the hi-hat and my right hand on&nbsp;snare. I'm hoping to by&nbsp;next week have open and&nbsp;cross hand about equal, it's amazing how it took me...what, a year to get down playing beats really good but&nbsp;now only a&nbsp;day or so&nbsp;just to switch it up with my hands which as all drummers know is&nbsp;some what of a challenge,&nbsp;gotta have lots of coordination. I have plenty. (= But that's the only skill&nbsp;I have. I also realized I've been using&nbsp;certain small sticks that really don't pleasure&nbsp;me as much as the ROCK sticks that are bigger and I was&nbsp;going crazy like a pro today on the set with these sticks. I've&nbsp;come to a point where drums&nbsp;is the only thing that matters in my life. Oh yea, I&nbsp;don't think I mentioned at Montauk I got a shirt that has a&nbsp;drumset on it and says IT'S ALL ABOUT DRUMS. That's my shirt. That's made for me. I&nbsp;bet somewhere on the tag it  says only for Tom Grimaldi  .&nbsp;So that's all today.&nbsp;Tomorrow Matt and Paul come back from Vermont and&nbsp;my&nbsp;first&nbsp;softball game,&nbsp;I've missed&nbsp;8 games but Crystal won't&nbsp;be back from Portugal until the end of July and she&nbsp;only makes it for the playoffs.&nbsp;But for me 8 is still alot missed so I gotta go to every game...ok bye.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp; oh yea, check this bullshit out... urlLink http://www.kevinalexanderclark.com/  Yea what a great fuckin drummer. Costs money? Star wars fan club doesn't even cost money. Oh let me waste 10 bucks on a baby drummer who everyone thinks is amazing but doesn't even care about drums!!! It's not fair little shits like this get places when they don't even have talent and people like me practice, the most 9 hours a day, COME ON!

      Well, I haven't been on this thing since last week. Montauk was crazy. Monday sucked, crappy weather. Tuesday sucked even more because it was even worse weather. So this is my "sicknasty" Tuesday. We go to East Hamptons. I go to this library. I notice a sign on the window that says "Hello, I'm James, please don't tap on me, thank you." And on the window was a fly. So I assumed the fly was James (and not the window) and started tapping on the window attempting to get James to come outside. Why did I not say trying and say attempting, am I trying to act smart, though attempting is a 2nd grade vocabulary word. ANYWAYS, I started tapping and then the lady was like CUT THAT OUT, I could see her through the window so I went inside and told her that James was misbehaving. Then we bought tickets to The Terminal at the movie theater. The craziest thing happened. My cousin Kate and Britt are about to receive their food that they payed for when the cops dart in the place saying everyone get out of the theater. This theater was a two floor theater&nbsp;and our movie was on top floor so I was&nbsp;on the steps on the way up when the cops came in. "HEY KID GET DOWN HERE."&nbsp;- Cop...."SCREW YOU!!!" - me. hehe. I ran up&nbsp;quickly and&nbsp;calmly said&nbsp;"Everybody evacuate the theater." My dad knew the voice and immedietly told my Aunt to stay, that's my son.&nbsp;"JAMIE JAMIE WHERE ARE YOU?! JAMIE!!!! HAVE YOU SEEN MY SON!?!? YOU BASTARD PIGS, GET OUT OF MY WAY I NEED TO GET MY SON!.....JAMIE THERE YOU ARE!!!&nbsp;*SLAPPED!*"&nbsp;and now everyone is waiting outside the theater wondering what&nbsp;in the hell is going on.&nbsp;Some cop&nbsp;told us the&nbsp;roof was caving in because of the bad storm that day and we got our tickets back but that wasn't the end&nbsp;of it. Remember I said my cousins were about to receive their&nbsp;food, well we didn't and I&nbsp;made the cops get the girl that worked the&nbsp;register to give us back&nbsp;$25...little did they know that they&nbsp;handed off&nbsp;the drinks and the Starbursts&nbsp;and really all they owed us was $10&nbsp;for popcorn. So out of all this deboggle, came a profit. Hurray. So we thought&nbsp;that was all the bad luck for the day when suddenly we got&nbsp;lost and ended up on GAY ROAD!!!! Ok, there couldn't be anymore. To make ourselves happy I'd&nbsp;do the&nbsp;Ostridge walk Kevin M taught me a long time ago and that made&nbsp;everyone crack up and&nbsp;happy and&nbsp;forget about the bad luck.&nbsp;So we go to Luigi's, some random second class restaurant and turns out&nbsp;there's no&nbsp;more room and the lady was a bitch about it, and a&nbsp;HUGE BITCH&nbsp;I might add.&nbsp;We go to Luigi's every year and this was the first year that&nbsp;we couldn't get a table. So we go to&nbsp;this&nbsp;place called Oyster Pond where a huge&nbsp;flood in the road existed which I called Oyster Pond and I decided to jump in it. Then when we were seated,&nbsp;dust started falling all over our table from the&nbsp;vents above.&nbsp;This day&nbsp;was truely the most bad luck&nbsp;day I have ever experienced. So the day ends and the rest of the&nbsp;vacation was great with great weather. I got lots of color.&nbsp;John the Jamaican at the&nbsp;pool at WaveCrest which is where we stay was keeping cool like usual, hard to understand his heavy accent. And he laughs so jollyful. Thursday was good,&nbsp;the Troianos (more cousins of mine) came out&nbsp;with Danny and Chris the boys kickin up some beach fun. What the hell am I talking about. Well&nbsp;Danny&nbsp;didn't go in the water, that was deppressing but the day still kicked ass. Did&nbsp;I&nbsp;mention I got really tan. Wow, I'm looking over all the things that happened last Montauk and it makes this Montauk look like shit.&nbsp;Go read it, it's July 19th, 2003. Saw alot of&nbsp;hot girls but didn't bother, I was too lazy.&nbsp;Saturday I came home and the&nbsp;upstairs floor was&nbsp;redone and now we're not getting a railing for another 5 months so we have to have this lethal dresser that prevents peoople&nbsp;from falling off the steps, but if someone pushes that off&nbsp;on someone, they'd probably die. Ok well today I drummed from 12:30 to 8:30 and I think that's 9 hours. Yea, I'm a loser. Shoot me. I&nbsp;want Paul and Matt to come&nbsp;home, I guarantee they're both bored out of they're minds, what the hell is there that's good in Vermont. Ok that's all. Bye.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Friday, aftermath practice then Paul came home from Villa Nova and I hung out with him. Saturday was awesome. Performed with Aftermath and Captive Honor performed too at Molly Blooms II in Amityville. I made 10 bucks woo! That show wasn't that great, day show and not many people. But the night show at Molly Blooms here in Smithtown probably had about 100 people. It was awesome. Alot of people shook my hand and said great job, I was so happy. People kick ass. OH YEA, and this band called Cast of Shadows came on after us, they sounded pro. I wouldn't be surprised if they make it. Everyone in the band was amazing. They played A Certain Shade of Green by Incubus PERFECTLY. The drummer was going nuts, his hair was flying everywhere. It was awesome. Slept like a baby last night, all that drumming. This morning I hung out with Paul and went into town with him, said our last final goodbyes. We decided we're gonna perform on the Smithtown Elem roof. Haha no, but we're gonna go up there like Ricky and I thought of doing last summer but never did. We were gonna for the big Mars that was supposed to be big but it wasn't, damn retarded scientists. They made such a big deal out of it and I remember it looked like a star, big fucking deal. So Paul and I are gonna rap and sing Time and Time Again by Chronic Future at Kaiser's bday party. Originally his party was this Saturday comin but I'm just coming home from Montauk that night (going to Battle of The Bands at night) and Paul's gonna be in Vermont so we made him change it to next next Saturday, the 24th. Everyone's invited. Bring boos and cake as Eric would say. WOAH I just figured out how to make this post a few hours back so it doesn't show up as Monday when I'm really typing Sunday, well technically it's Monday but it's past midnight...k let me click on More Post Options. Wala! Back to Sunday. Anyways back to today, after Paul, I mowed the lawn then drummed my last drum, pretty good too. Then watched When Harry Met Sally with my papa. Now it's now and I still haven't packed and I'm leaving for Montauk tomorrow morning. Goodbye everyone.

      Well last night was awesome, traditional Tringali/Michaelis sleep over. Haven't had one since 5th grade. You see in 5th grade we slept in the den watching HBO porn 2 in the morning and Joe made some kick ass buttery popcorn. Last night I forced them to ride bikes to Ralph's ices. Today we attacked each other with eggs and hoses. Joe got a new motor car, it doesn't work, haha! Oh and yesterday I had an Aftermath band practice and I went to Circuit City with Joe (Joe bought a PS2 because his was broken and he wants to use it on his trip and then return it when he gets back) and then I bought these headphones to protect my ears and give out good sound when I drum but they suck and I'm returning them. The idiot didn't know what the hell he was talking about. There were even ones for Studio shit there but he's like nah get these, turns out they were airplane headphones. Bastard. I'm gonna return them tomorrow. Hopefully Guitar Center, well I know they know what they're talking about. They're the pros. Tomorrow I also have another Aftermath practice and Saturday is the show at Molly Blooms 2 in Amityville. Yea so I dont know what the fuck is going on with this softball league. I pay 20 bucks for nothing. I haven't gone to any of the games so far and next week I'll miss all the game because of Montauk and I'll only end up going to the last game and the playoffs. But now I have to pay extra $8 for a god damn shirt, I wanna plant a bomb on Smithtown Rec and watch them all melt to death and laugh hard. NO I'M ONLY JOKING EASY THERE YOU FAGGOTS WHO HACK INTO THIS BLOGGER AND TELL GEORGE BUSH. But I'm gonna go to the game after Montauk and have a blast, strip naked and make my own shirt that says JACK FUCKING RABBITS and on the back it says GOO with the number 9. Awesome. Yea, so that's basically it, tomorrow I'm all full of things to do like Aftermath and drums and I think at night I'm jammin with Cozz and Stevo. The Almighty James - "BAI!"

      Oh god this summer is starting off slow and boring. I've become too lazy to pick up the phone and call people and make plans with people. So please make plans with me, I'm too lazy to make plans with you. Anyways, yesterday I drummed all day and my drum teacher gave me Interstate Love Song from STP and he showed me the beginning of Dyer Maker and a hard bass drum part to Good Times Bad Times. Also showed me some Latin Cha-Cha. At night I had a sleep over with Heaton and were supposed to with Paul but we found out he went to some basketball camp in Pennsylvania. WTF? Everyone's away, everyone's dead. Or maybe I'm just too lazy to call the people that are home and alive. Today nothing is happening. I'm just existing in my room. Tonight I'm gonna work for Tiara's uncle moving rocks on her lawn and I'm getting payed! w00t. Oh, Tool fans, check this out.  "Adam, Justin and Danny have been keeping to their rigorous schedule, writing and arranging material for the next Tool CD, this despite the Lakers being in the NBA play-offs, a fact of life which occupies a couple of the band members' nights (rehearsal/writing sessions go from noon 'till six). In a couple of weeks, when he's finished touring with APC, Maynard will join in on the ghastly fun (although he's already been quite involved), and hopefully, another web-cast can be arranged once more of the new songs begin to take shape. In the meantime, while talking to Danny the other night as the new Skinny Puppy release exploded from his living room speakers, he began to describe for me the complex time signatures of one of the new Tool songs, adding, after another sip of a Saint Pauli Girl (the German beer), that it was probably the best piece of music he'd ever been involved with. And this after only a half of a bier."

      Well, today was good. I went to the tabernacle with Ricky and Paul because there was a big festival, too lazy to explain. I also got a better cowbell and a new hi hat stand from Guitar Center. Later on, fireworks at my cousin Murphy's house. Fun, fun, funny, fun. Happy New Years.

      Damnit I need to reformat my computer, some virus keeps making my comp freeze...either that or it's the problem of me consistently kicking my computer. Anyways, yesterday was Friday and I hung out with Heaton and his brother and went to Guitar Center. Played the electric drum set, fun! Today I hung out with Ricky and Paul in the morning, then went to to Cory's for an Aftermath band practice, then went to my cousin's (Troianos) house. It was grand. We found some bird that couldn't fly good so we helped it fly. It flew. We also found Mr. Softee, what a delight, milk shakes for all. Mr. Softee is the best ice cream on Planet Earth. Remember when we were kids and we used to say Planet Earth. Good times I tell ya. The fireworks and cop sirens were swarming the peaceful quiet sounds of the atmosphere. It was fun watching all the explosions all around us. Princess meets Officer Friendly. Woo I actually made this blog before midnight, go me. Yea uh...that's all. Tomorrow should be a good traditional go to the cousin Murphy's fourth of a July. Billy bought some crackaz and the guys down the street have good ones too. It shall be extruvious. Oh yea, report cards came today. I did awesome. Since the colleges only look at final averages, regents and finals I lucked out. I got all A's and B's for final averages, mostly A's. Regents, Math A - 94, Living Environment - 85, Global - 97, Italian - 91. How awesome is that. I'm set for life. But I am pissed because my fucking Studio In Media Arts teacher gave me a C for the quarter because I couldn't make a panda. I tried hard and worked hard to make it and that's all that counts. It's not my fault I don't have good artistic skills, you're not allowed to grade someone on their artistic skills that's fucking bullshit. Ah who the fuck cares, art's for either homos, depressed emo faggets, or just normal kids who kick ass at art...and I'm none of them. And she put needs to participate more, more effort needed. BULLSHIT!!! That teacher's gonna get fired and that class is being taken out. The principal kept monitoring the class and I bet he realized the class has no educational value. So bye bye Mrs. McManus, YOU'RE FIRED!!! Ok, so besides Studio In Media Arts which doesn't matter because my final grade was a B+, everything on my report card was woopty doo! That's all, goodbye.

      Ok, I gotta type quick because I'm holding a melting ice pop in my mouth as I type. Ok, today drummed from 12 to 5, then went to Jon Ravin's, hung out with Jay, James and Jon, then went to see Spiderman 2 (AWESOME MOVIE, CAN'T WAIT FOR 3!)and met up with Matt. That's all. Goodbye. Oh yes, I owe Jon 10 bucks, I need a job...job searching tomorrow. Ok, bye.

      For all you war lovers out there, think about it. And read this  "Affirmative may be justified Take from one give to another The goal is to be unified Take my hand be my brother The payment silenced the masses Sanctified by oppression Unity took a backseat Sliding further in regression One, oh one, The only way is one I feel angry I feel helpless Want to change the world ya I feel violent I feel alone Don't try and change my mind no Society blind by color Why hold down one to raise another Discrimination now on both sides Seeds of hate blossom further The world is heading for mutiny When all we want is unity We may rise and fall But in the end we meet our fate together"  - The beginnings of Creed
