      SURPRISE PARTY! "why do you have a camera?..oh my g-d!!!!" 
yeah, so tonight i had the biggest surprise of my life i think...my mom and staci threw me a surprise 16th  birthday party, about a month late. they said they have been planning it all summer. 

so i went to the mall with marc and sarah(my big bro and his g/f) and i got the the blue swede shoes i had wanted before but didn't have my size in. they are so cool! we shopped and walked around for a while. we went home and i was planning on taking a nap so that i would be energized when i went to go babysit tonight. i walk through the kitchen door and see my dad stading in the corner with his digatle camera (it's his newish toy, so he plays with it often.) so i say "why do you have a camera?" walk in a little bit more to put my bag down on the table, and BAM! the word "SURPRISE!!!!" came out of my friends mouths who were stanind in the family room. i yelled "oh my g-d!" in shock. i couldn't believe it. i really had no clue. 

i was so happy for more then one reason, first off that they did this for me, second b/c my mom kept a secret.....this is a surprise in it self, she is horable at keeping secrets. i really have never had such a big secret kept from me all the way.

       SHABBAT SHALOME  to all my fellow jews, and others who know what that means. "challah back youngen', jew jew!"...mhh, challah...::drool::
polarREL: shabbat shalome!
polarREL: i am such a good jew
DNEWMANX: shabbat shalomie my homie
greg rocks my world.

today i just had to keep telling myself that it is finally Friday, and soon enough i will be home. the day seemed to take forever! but eventualy staci and i were at my house watching sex in the city (only 3 more episodes left! soon they will all be re-runs!) after shabbat dinner we went to TC to see Sweet Home Alabama, total chick flick. [it was quite cute, and quite predictable, but thats what made it so good]. while purchasing our tickest we had a blast from the past, we saw conrad and nikkil. i haven't seen conrad since 8th grade and i haven't seen nikkil since 6th. they both look exactly the same...normaly i think i would have been excited to see them, but today/tonight i was just in a blahh mood, where nothing was really effected me. i think it is just b/c i am so tired. anyway, after the movie, which was packed, we saw shaundra, susan and stephanie sitting outside. we chatted for a while and were real loud to the people passing bye. ::shrug:: "THEY DON'T KNOW ME!" 
when i got home my big brother marc and his girlie-friend were already here. after our hellos, i showed them my new room, and that was about the extent of our conversation...whatever, he is here for the whole weekend. eehh, can't you sense the sibling to sibling love?? 
although my whole day was kinda blahh, two things did bring me happiness...1)we used our scetck books for the first time in art today!! and 2) i talked to Jonathan. golly-ge-wiz i miss that boy. 
scratch that, 3 things made me happy today, the 3rd....talking to miss ashley....
Punkyelhsa: fart fart so funnay
Punkyelhsa: hahahahaha i'm just laughign thinking of it
Punkyelhsa: fart
Punkyelhsa: hahahahahahahahaha!
Punkyelhsa: so funny!
polarREL: lol
Punkyelhsa: hahahahahaha oh man! FART!
LOL!

      i forgot my lunch, i forgot my DAB....you would think that i would have had a bad day, but nope! i had a quite nice day, very low-key. government, CHEM IS TRY., lunch[i got mad at one of the lunch ladies who wouldn't give me salad dressing, whats up with that?] art and algebra where i now sit next to the teachers desk =). 
when i got home i found a package for me in the mail, i was so excited. it was a mix cd and letter from Jonathan! i listened to the mix after i got back from taking the blue beast out for a small spin. it is the most random mix i have ever listened to, i guess that if the point of a mix though. it has pop, rock, punk, hebrew songs and some other idunnowhat on it. like i said, a real mix. 
i was talking to my brobro Ethan today on line and he brought some good ol' child hood memories.....
 EZgolfer84: "mom, ethan is pinching me!!!!!"...meanwhile ethan is in a different room....
EZgolfer84: "ETHAN, STOP THAT"
polarREL: hahaha
EZgolfer84: you suck
it is so true, i was a bad little sister, and for that i was beat up....endless cycle. 
i also cleaned up more of my new room, i had some boxes of stuff that i hadn't gotten to unpack, and now there is so much more space. my mom walks in and was like "wow this room is big, you could have a whole party in here." i responded "uhh duhhh!" 

last night i had two very nifty long distance calls, first one was with jonathan. =) he is such a cutie and is coming down to see me soon, i am so excited!!!!! and the second was from Ashley. she talked to me about Gillmore Girls and i told her about my new black light, we talked for over an hour. she tucked me in too. i miss getting to she her and talk with her everyday, she really was/still is such a big part of my life, it is hard being so far apart.

       "when they call for me i'll be sitting at my desk with a gun in my hand wearing a bullet proof vest, singing 'my my my, how the time does fly when you know your going to die by the end of the night' HEY!"  -finallay! i have been trying to remember the words to that song for three days now, i ended up just listening to it! now i can actually sing it to patrick and ian at lunch! 
i was so sleepy today, i need to go to bed earlier i think...i fell asleep in english, while people were doing presentations. ::shrug:: nothing important. in health i fell asleep too, we were learning how  not  to have a baby, fun stuff. i am still confussed by the whole diaphragm thing, {'any questions about the movie?'..."uh yeah..how do you get one of those up there?"....' you just put it in.'...."but HOW!?!?!" nicely done staci}. 
ok, so who is the stupidest person alive?? uh that would have to be me! today i had a spanish vocab quiz, i got an amazing 3 out of 10 right! wow, i stink at spanish...most people in my class got 3 wrong....oh man. tonight it parent teacher confrences....this should be interesting. 
after school staci and i walked over to ian's house. we watched Monsters Inc. such a cute movie! we gave Staci her present, she was pretty shocked, it was quite amussing. [glow in the dark and water proof! very high quality]  and i got my belated birthday present from ian, a black light! it is so super coolios! i love it, it makes my stars extra glowy and my teeth glow which is just super rad to say the least. 
i found out that my brother adam is coming for thanksgiving, which made me so happy, and my brother marc is coming down this weekend to see my new room [well, not really to see my room, but that sounds like a good reason].

       "i want to make love  on  you"  i just spent the night with Miss Ashley!!!! 
ok, so lets start at the begining [meaning friday].....friday was a happy day just b/c it was friday. i had espanol and i actually didn't want to shrivle up and die that class period! {hey, miracles can happen} ian and i went home with staci and chillied at her casa for a while. we watched office space, a very funny movie. later we watched save the last dance, such a chick flick, ian wanted to shoot himself in the foot, but soon enough we got distracted and went and played in staci's mom's gym. (gym..whats a gym?{walks in} ohhh a gym!) we tried to teach ian how to dance [any kind of dancing] but we was just way too white in his farmer jack plad shirt. staci ordered pizza, and while she did so ian and i chased her around the house making sex sounds. it t'was a fun evening.
saturday i went over to steven n.'s house to work on the wheels video, which is going to be so cool. hillary joined us a little later. i got to see other peoples pictures and all i could do was smile. it was so cool how all these moments are like ingraved into my head and i can see them perfectly, i can even remember a lot of the roads we drove along in the middle of nowheres vill. i miss wheels, i think it just went by way too fast. 
after going through countless pictures i went to the mall with ian to get a gift for another friend. it was quite the trip; ian didn't want to actually purchase the gift, so he gave me money to do so. i bought it, but as soon as the guy gave me change i made sure to hand it back to ian and say in a loud voice "heres your change!" it was quite amussing, maybe you had to be there....maybe you had to know what this said gift is...shhh! i can't tell! 
ian came home with me and soon enough ashley came over!!! we all layed in my room and looked at all my stars that are ohh so pretty. after ian went home ashley and i debated whether or not to bake cookies. we started to watch forset gump(one of my favorite movies) and at around 12 we desided that now would be a good time to bake cookies. we kinda ate half the batter..::mhh, batter...raw eggs...mmhhh:: the cookied came out kinda,well, bad, but that is just cause we didn't put the rack up high enough so the bottum of all the cookies burned a little. they are lightly 'browned'. 
i love the nights i spend with ashley, we may go to bed at 1 but we lay in bed talking until around 3. we talk about anything and everything, it is just to relaxing and comforting. 
my daddy was supose to take me driving this weekend but i dunno if we are going to find time. =( i really need to start driving more often, i have had my permitt since february. i can get my lisence next month except for the fact that i have no where near enough driving hours, i haven't taken drivers ed. [can't take it until second quarter, which is a blower] and i have to take behind the wheel, which i can't take until i am in drivers ed. so i actually won't be getting it until sometime during winter. =P it is weird, my parents wondered why i don't ask to go out and drive more often and the only reason i could think of was that i just forget that i can. if that makes sence...i just forget that i am allowed to drive, that i am able to do so. it is also kinda scarey getting behind the wheel, i get nervous that i am going to mess up, i also get frustrated that i'm not just able to do everything, b/c when watching someone else it really does just look easy, and until you do it enough, it really isn't all  that  easy.

       ‘say who is that man walking down the street, he's so fine he's got the beat!'  ahh, that one is going on  Jew Jams , Peter gets %20 for thinking of the name. I am in a very jewish-song-sing-a-long mood right now, dunno why. 
Picture day! Not really a happy thing, but we got to get out of class to get them taken. I hate these pictures. The people who take them just seem like they hate their job and wish they were somewhere else. Meaning that they really don't care what your picture ends up looking like, might i add, the picture that goes in the yearbook. So you sit there, they place your head in some unnatural position, tell you to smile, take a few moments to adjust the camera and 1..pause....2.3! your picture is taken and you start to wonder how bad it really is. Fake smiles never look the same...Today actually went by kinda fast, i fell asleep in chemistry..i dunno if that was a bad thing or not. The teacher is so boring, she is one of those teachers who likes to talk and talk about nothing for long periods of time, then she slips in something that actually matters, but you are so zoned out by that point that you miss it. or at least thats what happens to me. 
In art i feel that i am finally opening up to new ideas and have stopped dwelling on the fact that i stink at realistic drawing. I am having quite a bit of fun with the materials, especially charcoal, which is also just fun to put on Ian. In math i feel like i am falling a little behind, not so good. It really isn't hard stuff we are doing, it is just that i don't remember, i need a few refreshers on algebra. 
Right after i got home my mommy took me to the mall!! And i got a new pair of pretty red sneekers, they are quite comfy. I'm not quite sure when it happened, but somewhere between the ages of 14 and 16 i began to think of shoes are collectibles. They are fun to buy, i like having them, and there is no real reason for having all of them, the true characteristics of a collection. I almost got two pairs, but they didn't have my size, which was a real bummer, i almost got blue swede shoes! Oh they were pretty, maybe next time. 
Tonight after a nice two hour nap i started on my homework. I started with spanish, did some other stuff then somehow i ended up with just as much spanish as i started with. I know i complain about it all the time, but i really do hate it. i want to take the class pass/fail, but i dunno if my parental units will let me. [pass/fail meaning you take the class and as long as you get above a D+ all quarters you pass the class, and the class is omitted from your GPA. So i would get credit for doing it, just no real grade.] i think it would take off a lot of the stress. I really don't know if i can pull threw this class.

       all questions answered ..i talked to Jonathan on the phone for over an hour tonight, it was wonderful. it is amazing how much he can make me smile. i really miss him.
why is school moving soooo slowly? maybe i am watching the clock too much. 
today someone said the most politically incorrect thing to me "you have a jew nose." i took offence to it, but i really don't think he knew the full extent of what he was saying. then from the same person in an attemp to make things better he says "you have nice knee caps." what in the world??? thats like saying 'wow, you have nice...eye sockets..' RANDOM!
anywho, MG came home with me today, and i let her spill her guts about everything that is going on in her life. the odd part was that she had trouble putting things into words and actually talking, this is not normal MG. she can talk and talk and never really  say  anything, today she couldn't even talk. whatever. we went ot the vollyball game at the school and cheered on the team, i wish i was on, but not, b/c i was away during tryouts. they lost, no big surprise for a SL team of any sport, but hey, it's all good. 
i talked to my spanish teacher who i am officially scared of and got a new spanish text book. she just makes me feel like i am ...i dunno what, but not a good feeling. not many people have that power over me like that. 
which reminds me, i need to go study....=P

        'what are we?'   can be the worst question for someone to hear when they are in a relationship, for me it was...
i still don't know the anwser...does it even matter? why do people need titles? does that make the relationship better or last longer if you know that you are boyfriend and girlfriend? can a long distance relationship ever work out when you are in high school? 
every single question is racing through my mind in order to find the ultimate answer to the worst question.. 'what are we?'  
am i being stupid taking so much thought on to a simple question? should i wake up and see the truth around me,..that just b/c you want something so bad doesn't mean you are going to get it. 
i have said it to other people, it has been said to me  :"no guy is worth crying over, and the one that is, won't make you cry."  i am starting to wonder if there really is such a guy...it is quite hard to believe, after all what do teenagers know about love? harsh statement, but true...is it possible for teens to feel love, i am talking about true love, at such a young age? what if it is, but just b/c of  age things don't work out....will you find another love just the same? 

 being a teenager is exhausting!

      this whole only child thing is so cool! sure, i miss my brothers, but not enough to ask them to move back in, well maybe Adam. anyway, my mom took me out today after school and we went to the post office to mail a few things then to BAM(Books A Million) picked up a book and she bought me my Beatles calender! (so none of you have to anymore) then we went to Michaels and she bought me more picture frames! i have like 30 now. then into Fresh Fields where i got yummy sushi(oh so good) and some peach lemonade stuff, that i am still drinking right now.  
well Ian was wrong, today was not picture day...oh well. all my classes today seemed way to long and quite boring. i think my art teacher thinks i am a little crazy, but thats ok, some of the best art came from crazy people, and no, i am not planning on cutting off my ear and sending it to my boyfriend. that would be kinda icky. but hey, i don't think crazy people are really crazy, i mean, they all have their reasons. 
there is a boy in my math class who i absolutly would not mind if someone beat him senseless. he is the most annoying kid ever, with one heck of a temper. today he was trying to break a glass bottle on the desk during class...how dumb can you get?!? 
well my spanish book is officially lost. which kinda stinks, a lot. now i either have to buy a new one or steal one, just like Peter suggested.lol. but i know as soon as i pay for a new one my old one will turn up somewhere. i can't believe i lost it , i have never ever lost a text book before, and this is only the third week of school! eepp, they are like $50, craziness!! 
i am going to see my spanish tutor in a little while...it is so scary there too. she is the nicest person, but i just feel so stupid when doing anything involved with spanish, i really do hate it.

      today was a fun filled day of praying and not eating! weee!
  story time!  so today in services hillary brought pictures of encampment that i had not seen, and she had doubles made so i could take some of them for myself. well, there was one picture that was of me and Jonathan kissing and i took both copies b/c i didn't want hillary to put them in her scrap book or anything and have everyone see them. so i was holding the pictures i wanted in my hand and hillarys mom wanted to see them. she took them out of my hand before i could take out the last two (the two of us kissing). i tried to take them but she wouldn't let me. so she finally gets to them and i just put my head in my hands and hillary is laughing all the while. her mom just stops and stares for some time. and is like "who is that?!?" in complete shock and Danielle's mom who knows everything for some reason goes "oh thats Jonathan." hillary and i are just laughing, me kinda embaressed. she kept looking at it, like it was a horable thing i did. and i said " you think just b/c there are no pictures of hillary doing that means it didn't happen?" lol....it just went on with hillary and i laughing. later her mom tells my mom and my mom gets confused b/c her mom said we were 'deep throating' (which is usually used as a term for a blow job) so later when i go to sit with my mom she is like "i hear you have some pictures" and i show her and she was like big deal. hillary's mom just way over reacted. 
anyway, Danielle came over after services and piged out, so much for fasting.....we watched sex in the city (i am down to my last tape!!) and i complained about how much i miss Jonathan. 
i am still trying to do some h/w that i should have done a while ago but i have put off until this last moment, i am smaawrt!

today consisted of cleaning and moving more stuff. my room only has one bed in it now, and it is all mine! i love it.

       it's my room!  finally, it is mine! my bed and computer are now in my new room. it is almost all set up, just a few more little things, but i will be sleeping here tonight! i am so excited! i love it, it looks kinda funny b/c none of the furnature matches, light wood, dark wood, white wood. but it is set up just how i want it, besideds the extra bed!!! uurrggh, hopefully it will be moved soon enough. 
all i did today was clean. pretty boring but we made a lot of progress. Staci came over around 5:30 and we went to Town Center and just hung out. we went into the book store and   she   had a great time looking through sex books...she is such a perv! lol, but it is funny. i almost bought a calender, it had the Beatles on it, but i didn't have enough money with me, so if anyone wants to buy me a gift, get me a Beatles calender! =) there are so many books i want to buy, for myself and other people. i love books!! 
we came back to my house and just hung out for a while, in my new room!!!!!!!!

                                        I HATE PIMPLES!!!!

       all i can say is thank goodness it is finally friday!   i was so tired today, i am so ready for this weekend, even though i have almost no plans. 
today went by kinda slow, but it is over now, so it's ok. in art i had a long talk to my teacher once again about how i can't draw realistic thing, and she understands. now i don't feel so bad, she said that my old teacher wouldn't have skipped me unless i was ready for it. 
on my short walk home from the bus stop i thought about Jonathan a lot, and how much i miss him, then i got home and there was a letter from him. i picked it up and as i was opening it i smelled it. he sprayed it with his smelly stuff that he wears (nicole miller for men). it is pretty strong stuff, but it reminds me so much of him. it was another poem. he said that he doesn't know how to use his own words to express how he feels so he uses other peoples. =) i got online and he was on! we talked for a while and had a good conversation and made me miss him even more.  i left the letter on my bed, and my fan was on, so my room smells like him now. lol. 
i was also talking to Mandy, i forgot how much fun she is....Cricket1817: howd u kiddes meet polarREL: jew camp. 
or my favorite...after seeing a picture of Ian...Cricket1817: i just wanna squeeze his cheeks  Cricket1817: but not in a sexual way. 

after Jonathan left i also got off, i desided to take a nap b/c i was so tired. i ended up sleeping from about 4 to 9:30ish, a good 5 hour nap. i really needed it though. but i feel as if i wasted my whole friday night..oh well. 

i got so mad at my parents tonight. so i have finally finished my new room, all i needed to do was take one of the beds out and put in my computer. well they discovered that there is no longer going to be enough room (for family to come and stay over) if i do that, therefore i have to have two beds in my room. which they had said i didn't need to do early. [i know this all sounds silly and childish, an extra bed, big whop, but i have been planning this 'dream room' of mine for over a year, and i have to do almost all the work by myself. the only thing my parents have done is drive me to get paint. old farts!] so i call my big brother Adam who always has the right thing to say,....tonight he didn't, but yet he did at the same time. he mainly told me that i was being a 'whinnie bitch' and that, 'that isn't me at all, so stop doing it.' and that 'even though it may be my room it is still their house.' which is all true, and i knew i was being silly and stupid, but i really did work hard on this. after a while of silence and a few angry thoughts about my parents he told me a few ideas about how i could do the beds. after talking with him i moved the beds and i still hate it but it may be ok for now. i hate being closeminded and childish, the worst part about it is when i know i am doing it, and how stupid it really is. 
ashley helped too..
Punkyelhsa: childish and stupid means you're feeling passionately.
Punkyelhsa: that's understandable, babe!
Punkyelhsa: you worked hard
Punkyelhsa: and it's your room
only if everyone thought like that!
i am still kinda upset about it, but i know i will get over it. 
one thing i did get out of it is the tv, i told my mom that if i had to have two beds then i get ot keep the tv in there, and before she could say anything my dad said fine. heh heh heh. 

i feel like i am swimming in a sea of Jonathan...his smell has taken over my room! but it's alright, it is quite comforting.

       being optimistic just makes life better.  really, looking back on my day, it wasn't all that great, but i was happy the whole day. in english i got an 'unaccepted' on my summer reading assignment, which was kinda pooie, but i can rehand it in. the part that does stink about that is that you can see remnants of old writing that said 'accepted' which my english teacher so kindly erased...erasable pens are stupid! in health which actauly turns out to be FLE (family life education/ sex ed.) i relearned all the boy and girl private parts, which is always interesting in it's own way. it amazes me that there are kids in my class that still laugh nervously when they hear a sexual word. 
at lunch Patrick helped me out with my spanish diagnostic test that i didn't complete. i seriously dred going to spanish. i am scared of being in that room, i feel so stupid when there. i hate it. i did so bad on the test thing-a-ma-jig, but so did a lot of other people....i still feel inadequate in that room. 
Patrick came home with me, which was quite enjoyable. i want to marry that boy, just b/c he can so effortlessly put a smile on my face. he knows how to make me happy, like today he knew how excited i am/was about my new room and it's color. after i showed him, every once in a while he would say how pretty it is....he is such a sweety. except when he tickles me in one place that only he knows about...powerful enough to make me fall out of my chair durning history class! ohhh the good old days. 
i also got a letter from Jonathan today in the mail, all it had in it was a poem by Percy Byssne Shelley entitled 'lover's philosophy' it made me jump up and down with excitement.
this evening while working on algebra i desided to take a break and talk with Ronya on the phone, which was so cool. it is awesome how we can just call each other without talking for over two weeks (or over a month and a half since we have had a real convo) and just pick up right where we left off. we are both so excited for international, which is going to be amazing, i can't wait!

      SHE CALLED! Ashley that is! i was trying out my awesome new water color paint brushes when i got a call from Miss Ashley! we talked about so much, and she read me many quotes from this book that i want to buy, but Ashley says she is buying for me, sometime...meaning not any time soon. all the while i was gluing (yes gluing, with actaul glue) over 200 sum glow in the dark stars to my new rooms ceiling. it looks amazing. it reminds me of the night we(BUSA) stayed in Arizona and got to stay up and look at the stars. it was one of the most beautiful things i have ever seen. the sky was so clear and so black that you could see so many stars, really was remarkable. anyway, while gluing we talked about how today is a whole year since 9/11. which we find to be quite odd, just b/c it seems like it was just a few months ago as aposed to a whole year. we talked about how you don't need to be extra sad today (and as Shoshi said) extra sadness is only for 'those who base their emotions around a calender'.  it's true, the nation has been greeving this whole year, and yes what happend was/still is horable, i won't deny that, it's just stupid that we should only be sad today b/c it is a year since it happend. and (as Jordana said) things such as that happen every time you turn around in Israel, hundereds of people die, there is no memorial service put on for them by the nation every year. whatever, i say let people feel how they want to feel, that is one thing in life that is yours to deside, and i don't want to take that away from anyone. 
anyway, Ashley and i also talked about religion, which is always interesting, and both of us talk as if we are walking on glass sometimes as to not insult or mock the others beliefes while on this subject. i think it is pretty nifty how she believes so strongly in her religion. it is a trate that i wish i had, but at the same time i am glad i don't. i don't feel like getting into it, but in short i don't like the fact that people go by whatever it says in an old book. i think you should do whats best for you and live life so that you are happy, but i don't feel that religion can do that for me, she does, and thats what makes her Ashley. silly moron!
today i took THE government test that i have been stressing over for the past week, and i think i did okay, it really wasn't that bad. then in chemistry he got candy! yum. i desided to broaden my horizon by doing extra trials that were not part of the experiment...my teacher got kinda upset with me, b/c "it may not be a big deal this time, but it could be next time. blah blah blah", either way it was cool, we (my group and i) watched the colors of a green skittle separate into yellow and blue. 
in art i didn't feel like drawing, infact i didn't feel like doing anything, so i hardly worked on my drawing at all, i did have a nice conversation with Natalya though. then to math, where just b/c the teacher knows me i get in trouble for other people talking. it's weird and annoying, but i don't really mind. i was just upset that i had to move away from Peter. he is such a cool dude, i had two classes with him today, i haven't had a single class with him since 6th grade! i talked to him on the phone for about two hours last night, which we haven't done in a long time, but it was quite enjoyable. 
now i have to go work on death, i mean....spanish. i have to do this diagnostic test to show her how stupid i really am....

       HE CALLED!!!!!! =)  Jonathan called me this afternoon. it was the bestest best part of my day, and it will probably end up being the best part of my whole week! i was sitting in the family room with my mom and Staci watching TV, the phone rings and my mom gets up to get it. she says "Ariel, it's for you" i ask her who it is and she just says "some gentleman." i had a small inkling that it was him, but really had no idea. i pick up the phone "hello?..." as soon as he replies with a 'hi' i knew it was him, there is no other voice like his. ahhh, i couldn't think straight, i was too excited, i must have said 'hi' at least 4 times after him. we talked for about 15 minutes, i guess, i really don't know, i lost all concept of time while i was talking to him. talking with him made me want to see him even more! it is going to drive me crazy. he kept saying how he had to get off, but he would keep talking, then he told me to hang-up b/c he couldn't do it, it was so hard to do. oh man oh man i miss him so much. hopefully i will get to see him sometime soon when he comes down to see some other people in MD, or maybe i'll go up there! =)

now for the only bad part of my day...spanish...need i say more? i feel like an idiot in that class. i know nothing, and my teacher speeks only in spanish, i just sit there with a stupified look on my face, like ::huh?....:: oh gosh i am going to fail! but thank goodness it is my last year, if i pass it that is.  

the rest of my day was filled with happy things. like today in art i was talking to my teacher and after i told her how much i hated my drawing and how much i stink at realism, she then pointed out all the things i did well, and told me how good it was. even if she was lieing, which i think she might have been, it still felt good to hear. and why is it people who can draw don't think they can? i look over at Ian's after he told me how bad his was and it was amazing, there is no way i could ever draw like that. uurgghh.  i had a snickers ice cream bar at lunch, that was good. lol. then Staci and Ian came home with me and we finished painting my room. it looks so good, i love it, i can't wait to move the rest of my stuff in there and make it mine. everyone is telling me i should paint a mural on one of the walls, but i have no idea what i would do...what would i want on my wall for the next three years i am in there? and what if i mess up? hmm, i'll have to think about it. if you have a cool idea let me hear it, i need some inspiration. we put glow in the dark stickers all over my ceiling; Staci and Ian even wrote their names on two stars over where i am going to put my bed, so that they are the first thing i think about when i wake up and the last when i fall asleep. i love my friends! 
Ian had to leave early so Staci and i cleaned up then watched Sex in the City, and thats when he called!!! 
i still have the same doppy smile from when he called on my face....i hope it stays for a while, i quite like it.

      hey look at that, another amazing conversation with Ian tonight. it didn't break our record of like 6 hours, but it was up there. it is amazing that i can talk to him on the phone for so long, we talk about nothing yet still talk about something. but it doesn't matter; it's not what we are are talking about it is who i am talking about it with. 

painting the rest of my room tomorrow!!!!! PURPLE ROOM!!!!!!!!!YAY!!! maybe i will actually be living in there by the end of the week, i mean i have only been living out of the closet in there for the past two weeks, and just using my old room to sleep and talk online. EEEEEE!!!!! so exciting.....now have to go learn 40 names and what their place in congress is....stupid government!

      pretty good day today. there was nothing special about it, it was just a normal day, which made it better than the past few days i have had. i got so much, infact too much homework today, and had to carry home 4 huge text books, and my mom still wonders why i don't stand up straight! 
oh, and one of the best things happend last night!  i had a dream!   that might seem like a small accomplishment to most people but this is the first time in a long time that i have had a rememorable dream (i think i just made that word up, eehh.) it was such an awesome dream too, about Jonathan =). it is kinda weird that i had a dream the same night i was talking about how i hadn't had one in a really long time, i guess i just wanted one bad enough! 'if you build it, it will come".....more like 'if you want one bad enought, it will happen." lol,  i am such a weirdo!... and i love it!

      services for 4 hours once again, wahoo! once again sat in the lobby talking to friends. 
there is someone i am supose to call, but i dunno if i want to. i don't know what or how i am going to say what needs to be said. it is really bothering me, but i really have no idea if it is the right thing to do. 
 is there such a thing as worring too much about your friends? before i would have said no, but now i'm not sure. sometime i think you just have to pull back, and keep to yourself, but others you need to be there. how do you figure out when to do which? aarrgghh!  man this whole 'growing up' thing blows.  i don't want to grow up, i'm a toys R us kid!!
i feel kinda empty today, i dunno if it is b/c i am bored or what, i just feel like something is missing.

       ROSH HASHANANAAA!!!  =P  apples and honey...best part of the whole holiday. YUMMY!

 lalala!  today was a good day all in all. i had to go to services for four hours which was so boring, but i got to hang out with Hillary, Danielle and Steven C, which is always fun. when i got home i slept, which was so awesome, i haven't had enough sleep recently. i love being able to wake up when you feel like it and in your own time. no one yelling at you to get out of bed, or in a rush to go anywhere. i woke up and just layed in my bed for some time, just thinking about all sorts of things, mostly friends and Jonathan. i spent the rest of the day downloading songs, making cds and writing letters to friends who live far away. 
i kept thinking about how Staci, Ian and Kirby are all at Six Flags, i wish i could have gone, today would have been a great day to go, perfect whether. i hope they had a good time.
i watched the first episode to Sex and the City(Staci gave me the whole 3rd season on tape for my birthday) which was pretty funny, makes me kinda glad i don't have cable. i know that sounds weird, but i think if i did have it i wouldn't be able to stop watching tv, ever. 
that was my day, and i enjoyed it, as unproductive as it may have been it was quite relaxing.

bOOtyshaker605: awww!!! you are soo cool!!

        well, i have concluded that Ashley whether 10 miles away or 100 can always brighten my day! (i think i knew this before, but i just rediscovered it) she is the prettiest thing ever! she does not need to look like a clone or have a pound of make-up to do so either, she carries with her, her own style and grace, even if she is an attention whore. =) when i talk to her all my problems/other people problems drift away, she makes me laugh and giggles like a little school girl, i remember why life is so good when i talk with her. i want to be just like her when i don't grow up!
Punkyelhsa: Do you know what you remind me of/reminds me of you?
polarREL: whats that?
Punkyelhsa: A sunflower. 
Punkyelhsa: No, make that a field of sunflowers.
Punkyelhsa: A whole planet where the land is covered with them.
polarREL: YAY!
Punkyelhsa: Tho, I don't think they'd be as pretty. But they try, little sunflowers, they try.
  ::happiness!::   > i love that girl!  

another thing that saved my no good horable day was a lovely letter from Jonathan. he said he likes to dream about me. it is cool to know someone is dreaming about you. i can't say that i have ever dreamed of him though, but then again i haven't had a dream in a really long time, which is sad. i do think about him all the time and daydream about him, if that counts....

       craptacular day!  today fuffillied the true sense of the word shity. 
i mainly had a breakdown, i had to leave art class to fetch out Staci at lunch so i could let it out to someone, b/c i couldn't talk with the person(s) next to me, for more reasons then one. i felt like such a dope standing there in the main hallway crying to Staci. after a few moments i wiped my tears and had to go back to art. where i feel i don't belong at this point; we are drawing self portrates...i suck at realistic drawing, i hate doing it. my teacher must be wondering why my last teacher skiped me into this class. 
anyway, as if my day couldn't get any worse, some jackass threw an opened packet of katchup, and of course it hit me. at first it was no biggie, then Patrick pointed out the fact that it was open...and yes of course there was bright red across my back! and of course i was wearing one of my favorite shirts that i got on wheels. 

i spent the afternoon at Stacis and it is always good to talk with her. i am now trapped in my house for the next two days b/c of jewish holidays, which i can't stand! 

sometimes it is hard to have such good friends, b/c when there is something wrong with them it makes you worry. i would do anything for my friends, but sometimes it is so emotionaly draining to worry about someone elses problems. like i have said before, i don't have my own problems, i have my friends.

       meehh 
i'm still not sure about today. i guess it hasn't had enough time to sink in. lately i have been having a hard time trying to figure out my own feelings, and that in it self is a weird feeling. 

today at school was alright. something is up with Ian, he isn't himself, and i don't know why, and he won't tell me. it worries me. 
i thought a lot about Ashley today, more so than usual, i miss her so much, she just seemed to make everything alright. we were a good balance for eachother. 
when i got home there were two more pieces of mail for me that normal (two pluse zero is a lot when speaking about mail.) one was a post card from when Peter had been in Germany, about 2 weeks ago. he drew a turkey on my arm today in government, his name is Norm and he likes to dance. it's so cool having a class with Peter, i haven't had one with him since 6th grade! he is going to get me in to so much trouble though, he can make me laugh about anything, at anytime. we were pokeing each other and someone behind us said "stop flirting!!" i found that coment to me rather amusing....Peter and i used to go out, in 7th grade, and we are even better friends now then we were then. he is a sweet guy, but i would never go out with him again, he is too much like a brother now. 
my other piece of mail was from someone who i wouldn't mind going out with, too bad he lives in PA!! Jonathan has not left my mind once in tha past three weeks. i love him, and he makes me feel oh so very special. i sent him a really rad letter with amazing doodles, but of course i addressed it wrong and some person in PA must have it.  i want to more then anything to see him soon, i dunno if i can wait until december. 

Staci needs to get a meddle for being such an awesome friend. she listens to me, and i know she is actually listening b/c she wants to, not just b/c she has to.

       the second first day....  wasn't all that bad, but don't get me wrong, it is still school.
I love the feeling of getting into a hot steamy shower on cold mornings such as today. it is so refreshing. especially when you go to bed at 12 and only get six hours of sleep. 
english went well, my teacher is only going to grade two of the five english essays, which is kinda poopy, i worked pretty hard and long on all of them! oh well, at least there wasn't a test, like the other class had, haha!
pe was so delicous, i sat with Patrick in the bleechers and talked, then Fiad joined us, a boy who i had previously never talked to but was never really nice to me. we talked about so much stuff, i can't say the time flew by, but it was cool to just hang out. 
lunch was another odd time, i have no friends that are girls in my lunch (although Natalya and i are starting not to be so scared that the we secretly hate each other), which doesn't really bother me, but i feel like i have to entertain the boys almost, they won't bring up a topic to talk about or start a convo. it's all on me, yippee....
spanish, oy. thank goodness this is my last year! the teacher seems cool, but has trouble controling the volume of her voice... 

after my afternoon nap, which was so refreshing, i went out and got some school supplies and a new scetch book! which i am in love with, it is so pretty and it's just paper in a black book, but it is no ordianry black book, it's mine. =) 
this whole homework 'thing' is really starting to get on my nerves! =P

      what a way to end my day....i just talk to my bestest of best friends Hillary, who was on the phone in tears, one of her friends and his brother were both killed in a car crash today. as she told me what happend inbetween sobs i was speechless, i searched for words but nothing came out, all i could think about is all my friends. i immediately told her how much i love her and had the need to tel all my friends the same thing. all i wanted to do was hold her in my arms. 
someone once told me that everything in life happens for a reason, but i am starting to disagree with that theory more and more.....
 if you are reading this, then i love you, please  know  that and  remember  it.

       THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL!!!! .....was eewwy to say the least. 
i really don't know, but i do know that i hate it there. it is such a dark and misrable place. it was very odd walking through the same halls and seeing the same faces all over again, just as last year. i feel as if summer didn't really happen, more that it was just an extended break of sorts. another weird thing was that when i was walking up the ramp to the blue subschool(my new home) my hand was shaking...i have no idea why, i still can't figure it out. i had no reason to be nervous, but i was... i saw so many people that i hadn't seen since the end of the last school year, most of them looking the same. there were a few people that have changed and most for the good. i'm still not used to Sam M's haircut even though it looks great! (i have been telling him to cut it like that for years!) then there is Kirk, who when i heard he was coming to SL this year was exstatic, today he hardly even said hi to me in the hallway...whatever. 
all my classes were fine, but lunch kinda sucks. i have A lunch, everyone else has B lunch. although the few people that do have it with me are some of my favorite people, but they don't seem to mesh well... i dunno, maybe it just needs time. Ian and Patrick stuck with me like glue and Peter went off with Natalya who still thinks i hate her, but honestly i have nothing against her and i would really like to be her friend. but thats my lunch...we sat on the sidewalk out side in the nice warm sun, cause it is so freezing inside the school, i was smuggling some serious tic-tacs in chem class. 

i think the best part of school was when it was over, that overwhelming sense of joy hits you that the day is finally over, it is what you have been waiting for since 7 in the morning. Ian and Staci came over to help me paint my room, we got one half of it done. and thank goodness Ian was there,  Mr.Propainter , without him Staci and i would have been lost. I LOVE THE COLOR OF MY NEW ROOM! even though it's not completly done and i'm not living in there yet, it brightens my day and it doesn't even look like an easter egg, Staci says it looks more like a kindergarden classroom....i am taking that as a good thing. 

tomorrow will be yet another first day b/c of block schedule, hopefully it will be a little happier than the first first day. 
it's interesting how even though she has been gone for a while, i still think Ashley is going to pop up behind a locker or something greeting me with her beautiful smile, but no such luck. 

last night i once again wanted to run over to Ian's house and give him a gaint hug. he posted a note on his online journal and it was one of the nicest thing he has ever said to me, or about me :' i realized that Ariel and I have such a
                                                                                            strong friendship that we can be talking about the most
                                                                                                boring things in the world and i will stil be entertained
                                                                                                     because i'm discussing it with her.'
aaawww!!!!!! so sweet, and as shaundra would say: 
super pink ducky: AW
super pink ducky: IM GOING TO DIE BECUS THIS IS TOO SWEET

so i guess overall my day wasn't  that  bad, but it is always hard to get back into the swing of things as my mom would say. oh, and speepking of my mom, today she informed me that i wasn't allowed to keep the TV that is in my new room in there, she said that since i have lived without one this long than i can keep on living without one. whats that all about? i just said whatever and desided that if i really want it i will just move it in there some night when she is asleep, she probably wouldn't notice anyway.

      .....there is a certain boy who i dred seeing, i am not going to mention his name b/c that would be mean(don't worry ian, it's not you). we used to be good friends, then all of a sudden i kinda have the urge to hurt him....i don't know why, he changed somehow, not that change is bad, but...i don't like this kind of change, it is something with his personality, i can't pinpoint it either. i don't know how i am going to keep pretending to like him, and i just found out i have a class with him.... :-/

      once again today i was woken up to the sound of drilling, fun times on the last day of summer! my dad took me to get paint for my room, i got the color i wanted, my only concern is that my room is going to look like a giant easter egg....oh well. i did my english report today! it took me a little while, but i did it and i think i did an ok job, i just hope it doesn't count as a test grade, which i know some teachers would do and that is just stupid. 
staci came over, i love talking with her, she the keeper of all my secrets, sometimes i think she knows more about me than i do. i would trust her with my life, just not my walls...she is only allowed to do the first coat. 
most of the days topics on the ariel and staci talk fest were about boys, whats new? my 'problem' is with my boy being so far away and how much that sucks, and her 'problem' being that she doesn't have a boy. our conversations seem to go in circles, hitting the same topic over and over again, yet each time it is a whole new conversation. odd how it works. 

i am so lucky, i have so many awesome friends, i think i need to be more appreciative. but what can i do? once i figure it out i will do it...

today i told Patrick that i think i knew him in a past life...polarREL: patrick sometimes i think i knew you in a past life or something. not that i believe in reincarnation or anything (if i did then in my next life i am going to be a billy goat) but i feel like i have known you for a long time. PeLo LoCo87: that makes me happy
i really do feel that way.... 
another reason i love this boy:
PeLo LoCo87: I was thinking of you, Ariel
polarREL: lol, yay
polarREL: i like being thought of
PeLo LoCo87: good
PeLo LoCo87: so be happy
polarREL: =)!!!!!!
PeLo LoCo87: :-D
PeLo LoCo87: that's my goal in life, ya know 
PeLo LoCo87: making you happy

and he does, he does it very well.

people keep telling me how much they don't want to go to school, and up until this moment i felt the same way...but right now i have come to see that i can't stop this thing we call school, infact it seems to grow stronger each year, sucking you in, choking you until you think you are about to die, then releasing just so you can get one breath only to take hold again...thats my feeling about that at this moment, it is sure to change in a little while
so, i was thinking....after school is over, and i mean over after the next 3 years, what then?......college, ok, then what.....work......why does life seem to suck so much!?! it is hard to smile when these thought come to my mind. all of a sudden i am in a very disruntled mood, aka: angry teenager mode. humpf!

      i just had the best conversation with Ian ever. i wanted to run over to his house and give him a giant hug, even though he hates my hugs, and my hair cut, and my homecoming dress and my purple walls. dispite all of the things he hates about me, i love him more than anything, and i have no idea what i would do with out him, his guess is that i'd die. he is the best friend that one could ever have, i am truely thankful to Hillary for telling me to find this boy. "i have a picture of you on my wall!"[best pick up line ever! and yes i will wash your eyes out after you get pepper spary in the face while we are clubing] i only hope that we stay such good friends through the next 3 years and even after that. for now i know there is always someone there for me and always someone willing to hang out with me in art classroom during lunch. i wouldn't trade his friendship for the world or even purple walls. [there still going to be purple, and he is going to help me paint them!]

aahhh i have to go to school tomorrow! ::dred::

spirit013: cause emus are tough!
polarREL: oh yeah! tough like beef jerky!
polarREL: is that tough? i have never had it
polarREL: but it looks to be tough
polarREL: it's not kosher....
polarREL: :-\
spirit013: ohhh thats cause theres beef genitals in eat
spirit013: Do you like cow genatals?
polarREL: not particually
polarREL: i've never had them
polarREL: they could be quite good
spirit013: hmm well i guess you just missing out 
polarREL: but the thought of them makes me want to hurl
spirit013: maybe the idea of them molding and with flies would make the picture better
polarREL: ahhh yes, almost as good as some one trying to eat their own faeces
spirit013: ewwy
polarREL: yeah
spirit013: that was not called for miss zimman
polarREL: you were talking about private parts of a cow!
polarREL: yeah! ha! your just as icky as me

spirit013: step right up see the weird girl write her english assignment
polarREL: hey!
polarREL: i prefer the word strange
polarREL: not weird

      today was a day that felt more like ten. i was woken by the sound of drilling in the room next to me, not a sound i recomend waking up to on your second to last day of summer. after eating some maypo that was way to mushy i went to the bookstore with my family {which now consists of my mom, my dad and myself, Ethan is now a big boy living his life at F&M college, in amish town} there is something about the bookstore that just brings a smile to my face. there are just so many possiblities, i guess that is why. there is so much to learn and oh so very little time. i bought one book, i found it in the self-help row, i'll leave it at that. at the check out line there was a boy working there, he had a startiling resmblance to Josh Harnett. i wanted to say something but i couldn't find the words, i now regret it, but maybe i will see him again and i will be sure to tell him.  
once home i started working on the stupid summer reading assignment. which i find to be an oximoron, there is no school work in the description of summer, in fact i think it actually states that there should be none, at least in my deffinition. whatever, i got distracted by a phone call from my big brother Marc, who told me i should move my stuff in to the front bebroom and not wait for my parents, who tend to put anything that has to do with cleaning off. it sparked a light in me and i was off cleaning and moving furnature by myself while my parents were out. in result i got a lot of junk out of the front bedroom and only did about a paragraph of my assignment. oppss. there is still tomorrow. 
a lot got done and i am happy with how things are going, i just wish i had started sooner. my dad said he would take me out to buy paint tomorrow. i desided on the color, finally; it's name is Heather Mist, a light purple.oh so pretty, i can't wait!

tonight on-line i talked to some of my most favoritest people. 
my one and only Ashy, who brightens my day with two words:Punkyelhsa: Hi darling! 

someone who i am falling even more in love with everyday, whether i want to or not(but i mostly do want to) Jonathan: i like being with u, i just hold u in my arm and all my cares seem to fall away from me

and my bestest bud spirit013: Sorry but my house is scared, you have to bathe in the nile, wear pointed shoes, and sing swidish hip hop to enter...think you can handle all that?

talking to all of them puts a smile on my face unlike anyother. it is a smile you can only have when you know how good it is to be alive b/c of the people around you. i only hope that each one of them knows how much i love him or her.

      today for dinner i was sitting in my big red chair eating a bag of chex mix and a can of peaches {directly out of the can of course} and some how i thought of Ashley and how she had such an awesome way of expressing her feeling in words and how she privledged me to read them. i desided i wanted to do the same. so here i am, a little confused and a little nervous about what i say. 
i guess i made this just b/c i want to let other people have a sneek peek at my inner feelings.

      just when i think i know what i am talking about i find something that proves i am completly wrong, in this case, i am glad that i was utterly wrong....  "Art is an expression of the very core of our selves. It holds the power to express that which sometimes can not be entirely expressed in words. Sometimes it has the power to bring us together, to make many minds one."-  Daniel G. Long II   i needed to hear/read that.

       i am mad at art!  i have no artistic inspiration anymore, and i don't like my teacher(she is a fine person, just not as MY art teacher) it is just so annoying, b/c i have always loved going to art class, and wish i never had to leave, now i hate going and can't wait until the period is over. humff....
this weekend was spent babysitting a 2 year old little boy who loves to push buttuns and talk on a telephone to a dial tone....but he is quite cute, even when he has a temper tantrum ever 30 seconds. hey, he's two. man, i must have watched Monsters Inc. at least 6 times in the 48 hour time period.
today i got so happy, just b/c ian was happy. i dunno what came over me, i talked to him for like 2 minutes the whole time he had a big grin on his face and somehow it just rubed off on me! 
after my mommy let me drive home from my spanish tutor, i found a letter from jonathan sitting in my place! i love getting real mail, not the junk stuff. the good stuff from someone you actually know. 

staci makes me giggle, without even tring....today she sent me the link to a web page for people who did excersise to make their penises bigger...it is a pretty funny page, but beware, there are quite graphic pictures....here are tid-bits of our convo about this page and penises in general...i cut out some of the parts that were just way too icky.

      today seemed like the  never ending day , like everything was moving in slow motion. 
my english teacher didn't come to class today; we were supose to have a sub., the sub never came...we had almost the whole 90 minutes to our self, then in the last 15 minutes mr.buthead [ooppss, typo...butler] came in and made us do work. it really wasn't that bad, we had almost the whole period to sit and talk.
i'm playing table tenis [aka ping pong] in PE, it's fun when my partner (staci) doesn't wack the ball as hard is she can and blame it on reflexs. lol, nah, it is still fun even then. but this frenchy-scotish kid, whatever he is, he was a jerk, and i want him to choke on his own spittle from all his 'chas'...
i had a sub in spanish too! which was good and bad. good b/c my spanish teacher can be a total bitch, and bad b/c now i still have no idea what to do on this stupid project. oooh well

 JONATHAN COMES TOMORROW!!!!!!! AHHH!!!!! I AM SO EXCITED!!!!!!!

      this stupid spanish project makes no sense. first off i don't even really know what to do b/c the directions are in spanish and my teacher went over it, in spanish. i did the work my group told me to do, and now i have to write a paper, in spanish about what i found out. turns out that the paper has to be all my groups info and mine combined, too bad my group has only met once and the first draft is due tomorrow. i am screwed. i hate this project, even my dad thinks it is retarded. i also hate how whenever we have spanish my teacher is all pissed off about something, most likely the class before us, so she is all super bitchy and blah. 

me: guess what?!?!
person: ....jonathan is coming in 2 days....
me: yeah,...... but guess what?!?!
person: what?!?
me: JONATHAN IS COMING IN 2 DAYS!!!!  haha, sucker!

      i love the smell of just washed clothing; ones that just came out of the dryer and they are still warm. b/c everyone knows once the garment has reached room temp. it no longer contains the fuzzy smell of  just washed clean .  maybe it is the fabric sheets my mommy uses, i dunno, whatever it is i quite enjoy the smell of it. if you don't know what i am talking about let me know and you can come over on laundry day.

Gray skies are gonna to clear up
Put on a happy face
Brush off the clouds and cheer up
Put on a happy face


Take off that gloomy mask of tragedy, it's not your style
You'd look so good that you'd be glad you decided to smile

Pick out a pleasant outlook
Stick out that noble chin
Wipe off that full of doubt look
Slap on a happy grin

And spread sunshine all over the place
Just, put on a happy face

Put on a happy face
Put on a happy face

And if you're feeling cross and bickerish
Don't sit and whine
Think of banana splits and licorice
And you'll feel fine

I knew a girl so gloomy
She'd never laugh or sing
She wouldn't listen to me
Now she's a mean ol' thing

So spread sunshine all over the place
Just, put on a happy face

      well, leave it to a test to make me feel dumb as a box of rocks. i took the PSATs today, and it wasn't easy, at all infact. it had all these big words that i could hardly read little loan know what they actually ment. but i hate those people who come out after taking it and are like "that was so easy," its kinda like a slap in the face. whatever, i get like 500 points for writing my name. 
i want to thank columbus for killing all those indians so i can have a day off of school yesterday, it was a very nice day. (TRASH CAN DAY!) i went over to stevens house to help work on the busA wheels video, which is going to be so cool! when i got home i started IMing people to tell them to buy one, and it turns out about half the people don't even get the group mail so they have no clue about anything....so i told them! =) 
since we got out at 11 today i went home with staci, along with ian. we watched the sweetist thing, which i found rather boring and not funny at all. it was a really bad chick flick. at 4 i came home and slept. i am so tired! 

guess what!?!......3 DAYS!!!!!!!!

       THREE DAY WEEKEND!!!! WAHOO!!! 
yesterday in art we got a new assignment; write about three life changing events. well, i really couldn't/can't think of three events that changed my life, in a good way or a bad way. one person i spoke to about the whole thing had a good point, he told me that maybe i don't need to have life changing events. meaning i have no reason or need for my life to be changed, so it doesn't. it makes sense kinda, but there has to be something. but i am still so young, it is hard to look back and pick out three things, it is hard to look back on 16 years and see a significant change in my life. anyway, i am still thinking about it, one thing is deffinatly going to be wheels or the grand canyon. 
ian and i were talking about it also, he told me that if he dies then that can be one of the events. it made me so sad, and i was like "noooooooo!!!!!" he was joking but still....so we joked about it the rest of the day that if one of us dies the other can use it as their art project. he walked me to my bus in the rain and we were talking about how he is going away this weekend and with all that has been happening with this phyco shooting people for no reason. so we desided that if he dies i am going to go to his funeral and bring a triple layer fudge cake. lol, i know it sounds so bad, but i guess you had to be there for all of it. 
staci came home with me, we watched charlies angels and just hung around. i must of told her like a million times about jonathan coming in 7 days!i am so excited! anyway, we have a three (and a half day-PSAT testing on wed.) weekend! 
tomorrow i think i might go shopping! wheee! 

 7 days!  thats like a week! {30 days....thats like a whole month!-joe-BUSA!!!!!}

       such a sleepy day!  i fell asleep in chemistry and algebra today, i had two very nice little naps. i don't remember much of anything today, just that i was tired. and that ian let me hold his arm as he walked me to the bus. normaly we(anyone really) isn't allowed to touch him....he is spaztic, so this made me happy.... spirit013: i liked that it was like a strool in the park on a peaceful afternoon spirit013: i got to catch up on the ariel info of the day polarREL: :-) thats so much happiness
when i got home, mom and i went out to Marshells and i got a pretty black dress....not for any real event, but it was cheep, it looks good, and i like it, pluse you can never have too many black dresses. i'll wear it to a wedding i have to go to soon, or something. we went to Baja Fresh for take out dinner. i got the veggi wrap thingie, it was so good. i love it there, i have never had a bad meal there. after eating an early dinner, i took a 2 hour nap before i had to go to spanish tutor. fun fun fun! i hate spanish! 
when i got home i had a fun conversation with Ian online. we switched places(i was him, he was me), yes i know we are weird, but hey, we have fun.....here are a few tid-bits from the convo....
spirit013: if your name was ian and mine was ariel the world would be backwards...

spirit013: i have curly hair
polarREL: hehe, yes you do, i have nuget colored curlyish hair
spirit013: i was thinking of straighting it all the time
spirit013: wasting like a hour everyday
polarREL: burning your scalp??
spirit013: yeah i like the feeling
polarREL: don't you love the smell of burnt hair??

spirit013: shmuck!
spirit013: haha i'm jewish
spirit013: thats weird
polarREL: haha, say something in hebrew, while i poke you with a stick, ha ha!

spirit013: haha yes
spirit013: i'm a bitch
spirit013: but you still love me

Auto response from polarREL: if i am Ian and Ian is me, how come i still can't pee standing up??

spirit013: thats what i think 
spirit013: but my vision on reality is always blurred
polarREL: oh?
spirit013: causse of those blue contacts i wear

spirit013: okay good night ian
polarREL: PEACE

i desided that Ian is one of the people i want to know for at least the rest of my life.

      'monday, monday, g-d bless this day!..." {i don't know anymore of the song, but it's a good one!}
today i can safely say, i DID NOT have a case of the mondays! i think it had something to do with that mocca frapp i had first period that made me so hyper i couldn't sit still! it was crazy! i deprive myself of any caffine on a regular basis, so when i do have it, it has like a triple effect on me. so anywho, i had it in government and by the last half hour i was starting to feel it, and when my group got up to present i had 'rock the casba' stuck in my head, and stood up there singing it to myself as my group memebers went. and i never realized how much fun a shnapping bottle top can be! i couldn't stop clicking it. i went hyperly to chemistry, then the teacher informed us that "today isn't really going to be a doing day, it is going to be an absorbing info. day" i was just like wonderful! i really couldn't sit still, i even danced with my bottle cap for the whole class. during class i hardly paid attention, but hey, whats new there? i i had random fits of playing with the sink and every once in a while i would stand up like i needed to get something, but then once up just stand there. i then played pong on Kirby's cell phone and got the all time hight score! go me! 
after chem in the hallway, megan had bubble rap! needless to say it was soon taken away by mr.butler. going to lunch i read the animai flyer for jon, ian and patrick. ian tried to kill me. during lunch i calmed down a considerable bit. then when we got to art, somehow ian had become the hyper one. he painted on me, so i put glue on his arm and tried to wax his hair off...didn't really work. math was coolios, i got a test back and i got a 93% on it, which is pretty awesome. then when i got home i had to see a math tutor "to catch up" but it really did help. i really understand whats going on in the class now. 
now all i have to do for the night is pull myself away from the computer to do my spanish, which i still dred doing. 
HAHAHAHA! peter dumped mg! not that they were ever going out, but she doesn't deserve him as a friend. dissed and dissmised!

i miss Ashley, since staci is my anti-drug, ashley has become my anti-sex....
polarREL: staci is my anti-drug,...you want to be my anti-sex?
Punkyelhsa: yes!
Punkyelhsa: i want to be your anti-sex
polarREL: wahoo!
Punkyelhsa: yay!
polarREL: side note though{wasn't planning on having sex for a long time anyway}
polarREL: but yay!
Punkyelhsa: good
Punkyelhsa: yay for chastity!
polarREL: yippee!
Punkyelhsa: hurray!
Punkyelhsa: Ashley, Ariel's living chasity belt, campaigning for a fetus-free Ariel!

i love her train of thought....
Punkyelhsa: i think i'm gonna make you a CD tonight
Auto response from polarREL
Punkyelhsa: and i'll try and send it tomorrow
Punkyelhsa: hehehehe i love you so much
Punkyelhsa: it'll be a seductive mix.
Punkyelhsa: so i'm kinda my own worst enemy.
Punkyelhsa: wait. jonathan is.
Punkyelhsa: but close enough!
Punkyelhsa: him and his impregnating abilities.
Punkyelhsa: no fair.
Punkyelhsa: I want to give you your present!
Punkyelhsa: i want a boy.

she is such a cutie!

       what a dandy weekend!   saturday i did nothing but anticipate the dance, which was pretty cool. it started out kinda slow, but picked up after the LTI people finally got there. i got to see a whole bunch of people who i haven't seen since encampment. and one girl from my wheels bus was down visiting her sister who lives here, that was cool. 
i hung out wioth Jacob, who is a total sweet heart, and Marc, who is so quite, but so nice. i danced quite a bit with Marc's friend Mike, who looks a lot like Ben Jennings, but shorter, anyway, i meet him before, but never really talked to him. he is a nice kid, but when i was dancing with him, he kept on stairing at me....::shrug:: whatever. 
today i slept...and slept, and around 1 i got up and my dad took me out driving for some time. it was pretty scary in the begining, i always think the people behind me are mad at me b/c i got the speed limit. but i did fine and later i drove to hebrew school too. 

i miss wheels!
Benallen39: gimme an R! R! gimme an E! E! gimme an L! L!
Benallen39: wat does that spell?!

      " SATURDAY!  CAN YOU FEEL THE THRILL OF IT?!  SATURDAY!  NEVER GET MY FILL OF IT!  SATURDAY!  THE BEST DAY ALL WEEK LOOOONNNGGGG!" wow, thats a blast from the past [sixth grade, to be exact].
last night ian came over and we watched american pie, well he watched it, i fell asleep threw most of it.  we then played around with all my 'sexy lights' [as staci would say] and labled a whole bunch of stuff in my room. we named my never-going-to-die-plastic-fish: Dametree, Shmuck and Karpernicus. i also got to straighten his hair and put pretty clips in it. he looked so funny, i couldn't look at him without laughing. we had dinner then ate jellybellys for awhile and hung up more glow stars on my ceiling. we watched an episode of sex in the city, which was "eehh"{ians words}. we sat outside on the newish swing and talked about randomness, what we are best at, and i had a strawberry popcilcle and ian ate more jellybellys. we later found out what boobs are really for...holding a bowl of jellybellys along with your legs...[guess you had to see it]. t'was a fun night. just me and my ian! =)

tonight is the seaboard USY dance!!!!!!!!!!! wahooo! i can't wait!

aww, poor little previrted staci...
bOOtyshaker605: do u have an ashy penis?  is jacking off painful?  then you should buy genital chapstick.  its a jumbo stick that u roll over your penis.  poof! no more ash!  not only does it remove ash, but rolling it across your penis is pleasurable.  so dont wait, get rid of that ashy penis pronto!
bOOtyshaker605: kirby and i were talking aobut naked skydiving
bOOtyshaker605: and how your penis would get ashy
bOOtyshaker605: and then i made the infomercial

       the week is almost over!  thank goodness, it has been so boring, honestly, nothing interesting has happend at all this week. i have been spending my time counting down the days until Jonathan comes down...(16) 
ian had a good point today in art, he said that the reason we are both producing crud this year in art is b/c we don't have a semi-crazy teacher such as mrs.briggs [who isn't all with it], we have a teacher who seems like she want you to do what she thinks will look best, not what you want to do. i agree with him on that, i feel like the thing i am doing i am doing only to make her happy, not b/c it just seemed to 'go'. whatever, i am sure as the year goes i will find my "groove". 
i am getting a B+ in Spanish!!!!!!!!! this is an amazing thing, i didn't think it was possible, and i am sure by the time we get report cards i won't have that grade. 
arrgghh, i don't want to go to school tomorrow! 
i might play laser tag tomorrow night, which would be so coolios. and USY DANCE ON SATURDAY NIGHT!!!!! i love USY!!!!!

      seeing drunk college kids was fun, they have problems controlling the volume of their voice, quite funny. other then that i college just seems like summer camp for big kids. 

i don't really care any more....but here are other peoples reactions>>>> 
ROXY142244: well lets c....
maybe if he took that keyboard he was using to type such bitch things abotu u.... and stuck it up his ass...... maybe.. JUST MAYBE.... he would find some pleasure in life and leave u the fuck alone
ROXY142244: what a jerk
ROXY142244: ariel, there are some unhappy people out there. and unfortunately, this "ben" guy is one of them. i dont know how religious you are... but i say that you should pray for him that he can find happiness in his life so that he doesnt have to rain on everyone else's parade
polarREL: i love you clare

i have moved on to new problems. i dunno what to do about jonathan and it is tearing me apart on the inside. i did get one good piece of advice from Alex>>>alexs10586: so cut his balls off and he will be a grlfriend.
lol, i wish, actually, no,...no i don't wish that.

      talking about 'ben' with my cuzzz3; shoshi. she is awesome at possitive insight. the glass is always half full in shoshi-land! 

polarREL: i just want to know who it is now
TheShoShiNaTer: why?  then it won't be fun anymore
polarREL: for him
TheShoShiNaTer: no, for you
polarREL: .....?
TheShoShiNaTer: you should be complemented that someone with poor self confidence went out of the way to try to piss you off...by letting it bother you, he is winning.  laugh it off, i bet you he has no friends and that's why he actually has time to go online and insult other people just so he can feel better about himself

i dunno if that is true, but i'd like too think so for a while.

      who the hell is this kid?? i know like 20 bens....but none i know are this rude and mean hearted. he signed my guest book again and now my guest book is a on going argument between my friends and this jerk-face 'ben'. this is what he said this time...
From: ben 	Date: 23-Nov-2002 21:08
hahah too bad i GO TO SOUTH LAKES stupid ass 
and i STILL think ariel zimman is one fat ass ugly kid who needs to lose some weight before she thinks she's damn sexy. its called a treadmill! its not that hard of a concept! 

why would some one say things like that about me on my own web site?? write me a letter, e-mail me, throw something at me in school, i don't care... but at least let me know who you are!  
the other thing is i never said or thought i was 'damn sexy'.....this jerk face is reallt getting on my nerves.  i know like a million bens, but only 3 at my school, and i don't/didn't think that any of them were that mean.



on a lighter note, i am sitting in my bro bro's dorm room here in PA, just chillen, i dunno where he went but it is reallt cold in here. i had a really fun time at battle of the bands last night, even though they didn't cover over the ice as my friend had said they were going to do. i saw so many people i knew last night! 
before we [becky, chris, megan and i] went to leedos to get some din din and to say bye to natalya who is going to disney world! {i get a post card! wheee!} dinner was full of laughter, mainly at chris who fell off the bench and spilled water all over him self. it was lots of fun just to chillio with them and watch megan somehow eat a whole plate of pasta with a whole jar of powder cheese.

      i like the color purple, sometimes a little too much. i snap my gum. i itch bug bites. i can't spell. i crack my nuckles. i am sometimes too blunt. sometimes little things upset me. i do not take complements well. i fall asleep during movies. sometimes i wear the same pair of pants multiple times before i wash them. i wait until last minute to do my homework. i like maccaroni and pizza better cold then hot. i sleep in class. i cry during sad movies. sometimes i rather be someone/anyone other then myself. i have a hard time talking to other people about my feelings. i have random twitches. i don't know how to dance, but i try anyways. i think my nose is too big. i do care what other people think even though i shouldn't. i know a lot of people but have few close friends. i hate reading out loud. i do not like my body. i don't like it when people use the word 'gay' as an insult. i am scared of driving....and people still love me, odd how that works.

      i have such mixed emotions right now, i don't know aht to think. i guess one thing at a time...first off, the other day Ian made me laugh so hard, it felt good. it was one of those deep laughs, down to your bones. 
spirit013: JAMIE KENNEDY IS COMING ON!!!! WATCH IT !!!! SOOOOOO FUNNY!!!
polarREL: will and grace is on...
spirit013: eh
spirit013: oh well then
spirit013: haha you could be a grace
spirit013: jewish
spirit013: frugale
spirit013: strange
spirit013: you'll just need to get a guy and turn him gay
spirit013: i think you could do it
spirit013: i have faith in ya
polarREL: i pick you!
spirit013: yeah thanks
spirit013: great friend you are
thats not what he said to  make my bones laugh, but funny none the less. 

on to my next feeling: Ashley came last night, to visit with her daddy. she came to the football game with us, that was fun, i remembered how much fun we had last year and in 8th grade going to football games and never actually watching football. staci and ashlye came back to my house and we watched charlies angels, after staci left i took her seat on the sofa and fell asleep. somehow i got upstairs and into bed while ashley talked on line. i woke up with a note by my side reading "good morning sunshine! and have a bright yellow day" it put a smile on my face. we built a fort aka a blanket held up by a few chairs and a fan. we laid under it together talking about different things, mostly about how we don't want to grow up, and how we are not really going to, ever. i miss having her around all the time, to bring that needed sunshine into my life, to remind me of how simple everything is.  she soon had to leave, the worst part of her coming...watching her go. 

then to go from happiness to sheer anger: i talked with hillary and i wanted to go to her house on a white horse and be her knight in shinning armor to rescue her from her life. she don't deserve the way her mom treats her and the things she says to her, she is better then that. i so wish i could save her, it makes me angry that i can't. 

while searching for my little black purse i found an old journal of my brothers on the top shelf in my closet. i opened it just wondering what it was and as i read i felt his emotions and thought falling off the page. he writes such beatiful poems, limerics really. once you look past his horable handwriting you see the little rhymes and references only he can make. there are some that are about subjects that i ponder now; life, love, purpose of anything and everything, death. when he was a teenager i was a little kid, i had no idea or concept of any of these feelings, many of which i have now felt. and i only wish i could have truely known him as he was then. one of his shorter works: 
Everything i seem to do
I start to think of you
I just can't stop the way 
I'm feeling
Can't help to seem from reeling,
Over you. 

now with all those things running through my mind how am i supose to feel? 
tired.

      cause i feeellll like dancing! {it's better when Natalya sings it} i think i am going to Steven's homecoming, as friends. i still feel bad for not going with him last year b/c i went to mine. a few weeks ago i didn't feel like going to homecoming, i still don't...but it's not mine, so hopefully it won't suck. i know that i am going to be bored and the shy side of me is going to come out b/c i don't know anyone, i'll try my best to be my usual social self, but it always happens to me. i lock up, words leave me and i seem like a quite simpleton. meehh, at least hillary will be there, with a junior! GO HILLARY! 
i am tired, just tired of being awake. it is the kind of tired that can't even be cured by obscene amounts of sleep...or at least i don't think so, i wouldn't really know considering i don't have the time to find out.

      things i hate....pimples, compolsive art teachers, homework, always having cold hands, being far away from people you love, fights with friends, the stinging feeling in your eye from cutting onions,....thats all i can think of right now. not to make you think i had a bad day..i had a perfectly fine day. OMG! the kid on the Bob Evens comercail is so cute! anyhoodles, as one of my favorite people would say, my art teacher is yet again driving me insane. i think she seriously dislikes me, or at least the way i do things. 
i need to go write a stupid creation story...i am so bad at writing fiction sometimes, i always think what i am writing sounds silly b/c it is so made up. eehh.

      today was such a cool day, i spent the morning trying to learn the words to my momentary new favorite song Cleaning Out My Closet by Eminem....i know i know, i never thought i would go so low as to like rap, but i have to admitt, it is kinda catchy. later i went and hung out with my best bud Hillary and we had a really awesome convo together. then went to scotts party thingie, which was a lot of fun even though there weren't too many people there. it's all good, no matter how many jews there are it is fun!

polarREL: ::strokes nonexistant beard:: interesting
wut the fop: ::strokes nonexistant chesthair:: indeed

      so, i blow dryed my hair tonight, just b/c i hadn't in a long time and i wanted to see how long it really is[it is kinda hard to tell how long your hair is when it culrs up two inches]. i like the feeling of it on my neck and shoulders, soft and light. i like being able to run my hands threw my hair and not have my fingers get stuck in a mass of curls, meanwhile turning into a fro-ish mess. sometimes i wish that i had naturaly straight hair, that i could just wash my hair and go, not worry about frizzing or fro-ing, but what fun would that be? my curls are me, no matter how hard i try to get rid of them, they are always going to be there, hiding behind globs of hair products that weigh my hair down. conclusion...i like my hair just the way it is, although sometimes i like to remind myself what i don't have, then i get my hair wet again and i remember what i do have and what many others don't.

      today while i was spacing out in math i was looking around the room and i saw some of the posters around the room which i had never really paid any attention to, it said something to the effect of 'tips for solving maths problems'. i started off on one of my random wanderings of thought and wondered why there can't be a simple little poster that has 'tips for solving lifes problems'. i dunno where i am going with this, i guess it is just un unresolved thought. aahh! unresolved! i hate that word! i hate it when my art teacher has to use that word whenever she talks about my art work. anyway, i was snapped out of my little trans by this boy {who i have a hard time not smaking up side the head} who was humming. it slowly became the only thing i could hear. why is it that when you hear something you rather not hear it become the point of your focus?it is as if it becomes the only thing you can hear no matter how hard you try to ignore it. if you have no idea what i am rambling on about, here is an example: just image yourself lying in bed, trying to fall asleep, all of a sudden you hear a faint ringing noise, for the next hour or so you lay awake listening and focusing on the sound, you can't ignore it or block it our b/c you are trying to. whatever, maybe it's just me. 

in chemistry {CHEM IS TRY} we were having a laid back class period and my teacher some how got on the topic of non-verbal gestures. 
 she asked the class :whats a non-verbal gesture?
 i answered [withough raising my hand of course]: a wink!
 the teacher asked: what can/does a wink mean?
 i answered not realising what was coming out of my mouth: 'hey there sexy!'
 it was so funny, i really hadn't thought about what i was saying. everyone laughed for quite some time, my face got that on fire feeling, and i knew i had turned bright red. i can't control it and i dunno why it happens...i really wasn't embarassed of what had happend or what i had said, so why was my face red?

       i love bookstores and oldies music  {insert laughter here}. tonight i went to Barns & Noble with my dad, one of our favorite places to go, together or apart. i must have inhereted my love of bookstores from him. i find it a feeling like none other, standing in a huge store looking at shelves and shelves of books, many of which i wish i owned. it is so calming and relaxing, deffinatly my quite place{ever seen 40 days and 40 nights}. when it was time to go [i was about to write 'when we were done' but there is never a 'done' in a book store for us] we drove home. the long way...if there is such a thing from TC to my house. the whole while we were listning to oldies, and singing as if we both knew all the words. it was nice...and so is my new book =)

       SUCH A COOLIOS WEEKEND!  friday after school we drove to PA, it took about four hours rather then the two it is suppose to take, it's all good though, i got to sleep! mommy & daddy left me with Ashley! who i haven't seen in forever and a day. shortly after my parents left we got all bundled up and went to Kyle's(her brobro) foosball game. it was soooo cold! after about and hour we went and sat in the car with the heat on, to thaw out. after a little while ashley's over active bladder kicked in and we were out in the cold again to find a potty. when we spotted one she was off in a mad dash and some boy yelled "haha that girl has to piss!" t'was quite funny, i couldn't stop laughing. on the way home we stoped and picked up a movie; Mr.Deeds. kinda funny...we went to bed and the next morning we woke up around 9ish and layed together on her bed just talking and looking at prettiness. after a while we made blueberry pancakes which were....kinda not good, at all. we went to this wonderful used book store that i didn't ever want to leave, although there was like no heating. ashley got several old books and i got two beatles posters! (so cool!) we then went and got fnger paints! we went back to her house, had lunch, chillied, then when the time was right we sat on the kitchen floor and finger painted two beautiful posters. we splashed and smushed the paint on to the paper. by the end we each had paint speckled faces from all the splashes. that night we watched Brave Heart, which such an awesome movie that i haven't seen in a long time, i think i need to buy it. 
next morning we woke up and got dressed to go to church. this is the first time i have ever been to church, and i took it as a learning experiance. i found it quite interesting actually. it's all so different from what i am used to and even what i thought it would be like. when we got home we had lunch then decorated ashys room with pretty. soon i had to go home, which really didn't want to do. =( the whole ride home i slept, and listened to the cd ashley made me for my belated birthday gift(which also included a really nice set of water colors and water color paper!) until my cd players batteries died **shakes fist** [shake it hard boy, keep shaking...] 
a while after i got home Ian came over and we watched 'The New Guy', it was pretty funny. he is such a cool kid, i know i say it all the time, but he really is, i am lucky to have him as a friend. 
spirit013: your a special lady
polarREL: whys that?
spirit013: u just are
so much happiness! even more happiness in the fact that i don't have schoo for the next two days! wahoo! thank goodness for teacher work days!

       SUCH AN AMAZING WEEK AT INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION IN 2OrlandO2! YAY JEWS! 
wow i have lots to say, so sit back and enjoy!

so, i went to the air port bright and early at around 5 am. i met all my seaboard friends there and even made a new friend; Irina! after standing in line for quite sometime we got on the plane and we were off to sunny FL.  i sat next to Irina and we became instant friends, very cool. when we got to the hotel we had some free time were i got to see all my wheels friends and some other kids from other regions. and then we had opening cerimonies, which is like my favoritest part of the whole convention, b/c everyone is so excited and energized to be there and full of ruach! i love ruach! {oh we are the seaboard region and we've got ruuuaaacchhh!!!!!}  after all that excitement we had dinner and i sat with some kids from texas, yee-haw! after dinner we had our busA reunion, which was so cool. it was so weird yet so right to all be in the same rom again. although it wasn't everyone it felt just like old times. it was amazing how it really felt like i had just seen them the other day, not 5 months ago. the reunion went by way too fast and i wanted to stay there all night with them. we found out some of the staff's little secrets and just other little things that looking back on are just funny. after the reunion i went to the regional t-shirt sale. i got a sweat shirt that says 'canada EH!' and two other t-shirts. soon it was time for us to go up to outr rooms, and at that point i still didn't know who my room mates were. turns out to preppy freshman and a quiet sophmore. luckfully my room joined to hillary and danilles, who are some how always roomed together. 
monday was an interesting day. started out with me waking up hillary by running anf jumping on her and sining "rise and shine" to her. during the day we had a lot of free time. we went to downtown dinesy which is like a total tourest trap. it is just all shops and stores filled with over priced dinsey pooh. i had a great chat with hillary, benji and alex outside next to the ppol. the weather was sooo nice! later in the day sarah and asher came to visit, which was so much fun. he went down to visit her for the week and then they came to visit us. i miss sarah so much, i forgot how amazing of a person she is. after spending a while catching up with them we had dinner then a nice preforance from a group of isreali teenage dancers and singer. we got front row seats and it was a great show, even if they were lip singing. 
tuesday we went to disney world were we met sarah and asher again. we had so much fun catching up. it was raining on and off during the day. it was amusing seeing people run for shelter when it started pooring, even the people who paid for those stupid mickey mouse ponchoes for like 6 bucks. while we all stood out side and let the rain soak us. i even took hillarys hand and started to dance with her. the rain even inproved one of the rides. it made it like ten times cooler. it was hard saying bye to asher and sarah, the day just went by so fast. when we got back to the hotel we just had study groups and what not. 
christmas is so much fun! {not very often you hear a jew say that} but being there with 1500 other jews makes you realize that not everyone is celebrating xmas. you really forget that it is even a special day. there were elections in the afternoon for international board, which i can't even vote for. so i just stayed for the presedential elecetion which everyone has to stay for then left after i found out our new president is from canada! i spent most of my free time hanging out with ronya which was fun. she got pushed in the pool! haha! that night was the dance, which was followed by the indoction of the new board, which seemed to take FOREVER! the dance was cool, except for the fact that the dance floor was sooo small. i was having a great time until i got some not so great news and all of a suden i didn't feel like dancing much anymore. so i ended up talking with zach s. for the next two hours. it was such a great conversation. it ranged from boys to love, music to sex, art to family. it was just what i needed. 
thursday we had closing cerimonies and then it was time to say goodbye. it didn't seem as hard this time as it did at the end of wheels, not sure why, but it was a lot easier. after all the goodbyes and a few tears we got on a bus and went to MGM for the day. it was cool going there, but nothing that great. the tower of terror is always fun. danielle and i went off on our own and got fake tatoos and then proceded to get very confused. we thought the meeting point was somewhere where is wasn't. we ended up having to call the staff and run out to the buses. it all turned out fine and nobody besideds the staff knew that we were the ones that held up the buses. the next 3 hours were spent on a bus going to ft. lauderdale, where out post convention was. when we got there we got out stuff and were split up and went to out host family homes then straight to bed. i was grouped with 3 other girls, while hillary and danielle were together at some other house, as always. it is weird how all the houses there are only one level, but whatever. the house we stayed in was fine, besideds away too annoying jewish mother. "you hungry?!" "you sure you don't want anything to eat?!" "you hungry?!"  aarrgghh, she got on my nervse. anyway, friday we went to the beach which was so nice. i love going to the beach. even though it was a little chilli (still nicer then here) and a little breezie it was still great. paul drew a picture of me and i flew a kite. =) i love beaches, just the whole vibe they have; the crashing water, the sand on your feet, the hot sun warming you and the sky, which looks like it never ends. soon we had to leave the beach and go get ready for shabbos. we had shabat services and 2 whole hours of ruach! 
saturday we had services then had some free time, i sat with irina and danielle and got a little sun before we had to get back into our nice clothing and say goodbye to shabat. after sundown we went an got changed for the dance which a few other regions attended aswell. it was at an I-MAX which was cool. there were a whole bunch of animals and such there too, and i ran away from the snakes like a little school girl, quite funny, but i still get the chills just thinking about them, growdy! the dance was a lot of fun though, a lot of sluty booty dancing. but i got to see a few of my wheels friends again, which was fun. 
sunday we said goodbye to all the ft. lauderdale kids and went to this mall that was over a mile long and a whole bunch of outlet stores. i just got a ron jons surf shop t-shirt. we went into a tv store and got suckered in to watching a demo for some sound system which was a total waste of time. i have no idea why they asked us (6 teenage kids) to go see it, it's not like any of us could afford it. anyway after two hours in the huge mall we wen to the airport. i got searched at the security! mehh, it was b/c of my belt but they had to use the little metal detector thingie. we spent like 3 hours at the air port which was quite boring but we just layed around talking. first we flew to atlanta on this huge plane then from atalanta to dulles. 
i got off the plane and i realized how much i really didn't want to go home. yeah i wanted to see my family and friends, but i had such a great time away i just wanted it to keep going. i was talking with danielle and we desided that USY trips aren't real life. everything about them feels so fake, in a good way. the time just kinda blurs together and you never sleep but you are always having fun so it doesn't matter. you are with some of the greatest people and there is just nothing else like it. you don't have to worry about anything really. i love it, and only wish everyone could know the feeling. 


monday i slept until 1ish which was nice considering i had been running on an average of about 5 hours of sleep a night. i went over to staci's and told her all my little stories. we watched legally blond and caught up. then out to TC to bum around. i got a new pair of jeans that i am in love with! and after i went back to her house and slept over. when i came home this morning i went out to price club and got stuff with my daddy and dropped off two of my three rolls of film from the past week. then home to watch something about marry. now i am waiting until 8 when staci and ian come over for new years. they are both sleeping over and i have nothing planned, so this should be interesting. ::shrug:: we always find ways to keep ourselves busy. 

i desided not to have a new years resolution and just to go with the flow. there is nothing i really want to change in my life at the moment and when there is, i will change it. i am pretty happy right now, i dunno if it is b/c i am not in school or what, but i will try my best to stay this happy for a while.  HAPPY NEW YEAR TO EVERYONE!  I LOVE YOU ALL!

      thank goodness for ashley. i don't know what i would do without her, really, with out her number on my wall i would be sulking on my bed, stairing at the ceiling wondering why my life sucks so much. you know how some people have there 'quiet place' to go and reflect on their thoughts and to just be alone, well i have ashley. when i want to talk to someone about feelings and just hear happy things, i call her. i only wish that she was an 8 and a half minute car ride away as apposed to a long distanance phone call away. she reminds me that it is alright to feel upset or mad, but at the same time tells me that there is hardly a point. why dwell on something, it only makes it worse. and it is so true, although i do still feel mildly upset. i think it is the book i am reading; the perks of being a wall flower. it is really having an effact on me. i am not sure why, i but i really feel as if i know this 'charlie' and that he is my friend. or maybe it is just a sad story that you don't want to be true for anyone. it is a wonderful book, but who knew it could make me feel oh so many different emotions?....
last night at 1am when i couldn't sleep, i wrote jonathan a letter, after all he was the reason i couldn't fall asleep. it took me a while to write it, and it was pretty short too, but i kept on pausing inbetween sentanctes, trying to clear my thoughs, it never worked and my mind would stumble on to something else. after i finished the letter i put in in an envelope and sealed it, with out reading over it i put his address on it and a stamp and first thing this morning i put it in the mailbox not even thinking about it. but now i am...i can't quite recall everything i said, after all it was 1 in the morning. i wish i hadn't sent it already though, i am sure it isn't that bad, but it is pretty emotional and i just don't like to play the part of an overly emotional teenage girl who can't handle herself. it really bothers me when i see other people like that, and it makes me even more upset when i start to see myself acting like that. but sometimes i really can't help it. i am starting to think it really is just part of being a teenager. i have noticed that sometimes i think irrationaly, when really i shouldn't, i mean the world isn't going to come to an end b/c i failed a test, but sometimes at the 'point of impact' it really feels as if it is going to. 
i like to think of myself as a happy person. i don't have any desire to be 'dark' or 'mysterious' like i see many of my other friends trying to accomplish. but i think in the end you really just need to be yourself, and every once in a while you are allowed that 'off day' or even week, where everything can suck, even if it really doesn't. you need those times to show you how wonderful your happy times are. it might be cliqué but it is so true.

      as i sit here at 11:51 pm listening to Matt Pond PA after a great day with friends, i can't help but feel a little empty inside. i am not sure why that is. i really can't put my finger on what is missing from inside me. it just feels like an ache, one that no one else can fill. as if i have to fill it myself, only if i knew how....

i spent my whole snow day yesterday in my pjs talking to people online and uploading pictures to my website. i watched out my window as snow fell and it made me want to hold someones hand and take a walk all the while feel as if there was nothing at all to worry about in the world. insted i watched the mailman skid and slide on the ice. not exactly what i wanted at the time, but i guess a close second.
i stayed up until 3 last night talking to an old friend, one who i hadn't talk to in all too long. this morning at 12 ian called to wake me up and tell me he was coming over. so i had to get up and get dressed. took me a while to really wake up. we played a few rounds of scatogories until he started to hate it, then watched austen powers 3. quite funny, especially the deleted scenes, where they keep throwing up! somehow we kept ourself entertained for those few other hours. then we took a walk, and took pictures of the sun setting and the moon. it was so cold out [it was the first i have been outside in two days]. he once again told me he hated everything i was wearing, including the scarf i made! although he said he didn't entirely hate my pants; jeans. on the way back home i slipped and fell on my knees, it hurt a little, ian just laughed. thats ok cause i made him walk me back home, that way if i fell again he would go down with me. hehehe ::devilish grin:: when we got back home we started to plant the chia seeds on Gill (my chiapet-elephant) when shaundra came over. they watched me put the seeds on Gill and then we brought him to his new home where my mom will now take care of him. we played 'you don't know jack' and soon ian had to go. shaundra and i continued to play until patrick got here. while downstairs we were talking with my mom, who desided to stab me in the butt with a fork! b/c i insulted her cooking, weirdo! then we played scatogories until staci got here. then we ate! we played some more after finishing the pizza and lackas as well as two bottles of sparkling apple cyder, we played MORE scatogorgies. it is suprising how much staci and i think alike! and how bad patrick is at such a simple game....we went to hang out in my room for a while and i cut patricks feather hair. i did a pretty good job, better then one of those non-english speeking people who take off like 4 inches when you say 'just a trim'. we watched sex in the city as well as a tickle fest. staci soon left and the three of us listened to radio head {oh so dreamy} and just talked. soon the two of them had to go, and here i am now,...feeling just a little empy inside and a little sleepy on the out.

i like the color purple, sometimes a little too much.  i snap my gum . i itch bug bites.  i can't spell . i crack my nuckles.  i am sometime too blunt . sometimes little things upset me.  i fall asleep during movies . sometimes i wear the same pair of pants multiple times before i wash them.  i wait until last minute to do my homework . i like maccaroni and pizza better cold then hot . i sleep in class . i cry during sad movies.  i have a hard time talking to other people about my feelings . i have random twitches.  i don't know how to dance, but i try anyways . i think my nose is too big.  i do care what other people think even though i shouldn't . i know a lot of people but have few close friends.  i hate reading out loud . i don't like it when people use the word 'gay' as an insult.  i am scared of driving ....and people still love me, odd how that works.

      so now i have another mean person signing me guestbook...
From: chris s.  Date: 30-Nov-2002 20:30 
whatever you guys are retarted that ben guy (whoever the hell he is) is kinda right i mean....ariel....you're nice but kinda really overweight and chubby in the face, you'd be hot if you weren't though because u have a nice personality 

well then, now i'm not just fat i am 'kinda really overweight' oh and 'chubby in the face' but HEY! i have 'a nice personality'. jerkface!

do these people enjoy making me feel like a little pebble that can just be flicked to the side, cause hey, i have no feelings what so ever. infact i enjoy people telling me how fat and ugly i am. great for my self esteem and all. 
goodness, i just want to be left alone, life is sucking enough as is right now, i don't need people i don't even know making me feel worse. 
why is it that the bad stuff is always easier to believe?

      long weekends always go bye way too fast. 
thanksgiving was fun, all i had was mashed potatos, broccoli, fruit, and pie+cool whip. 
chanuka started out good too, i usually never get presents, but last night i did! ethan gave me the White album, which i have wanted forever! Pretty Woman on DVD, which is good considering that my tape copy is wearing out from so much use and a jew shirt from college, very cute. and my parents totally surprised me with a book i had really wanted and forgotten about. =)
today adam and i threw on my wheel, i think that was the best part of my whole weekend. alone time with adam. i love him so much, i miss him so much too. he is really my hero and my best drinking buddy, oh yeah, this weekend i found out that mikes hard cranberry juice is very good. and that two bottles will not make me drunk. 

i guess my bluntness rubs off on others...

      staci is just the best friend i could ever ask for. she continually says nice things to me/about me without me even saying something to her first. it is always when i least expect it and it just makes me oh so 'mega-super-duper happy'. 
bOOtyshaker605: i wrote about you in my blog today, well not jsut you but yeah
polarREL: what did you say about me?
 bOOtyshaker605: "ariel is so comforting. she's one of those people u could sit and do nothing with forever and have a blast, you can talk to for hours, and you just know that she'll always be there. she's just so refreshingly pure." 
polarREL: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
polarREL: that makes me smile so much!
bOOtyshaker605: yay, i'm glad
bOOtyshaker605: cuz i was listening to that "body is a wonderland" song, and i decided that everyone has the right to be felt that way by someone
bOOtyshaker605: so then i started talking bout all my friends, and how cool they are and how they deserve to have someone who thinks they they are wonderful
polarREL: aaww, you are the coolest ever!
bOOtyshaker605: thank you
polarREL: you are!
polarREL: you are always doing things to make other people happy
bOOtyshaker605: i revel in other peoples happiness
bOOtyshaker605: when everyone else is happy i am happy
polarREL: well you should ber like super happy, b/c i am like mega-super-duper happy
bOOtyshaker605: yay, i am happy

      said it once, said it twice and i'll say it again...WEEKEND ARE TOO SHORT!

friday night i went to Peters for his birthday, and i got a gift too! (late chanukah gift) it was so much fun, we went ice skatting and i didn't fall once! at first i was a little causes, but after a few laps around i was speeding along. i want to go more often, i forgot how much fun it is, i also forgot how much it hurts your feet! 
saturday we drove to New Jersey, and i stayed with greg. my parents went to visit my big bro marc in NY. and i went to lindsay's sweet 16 party, which was a lot of fun just b/c of the people there. it's weird how whenever i see kids from my bus besideds new hair cuts and different clothing, everything is the same, we truely are like a family. it's not so much that i miss wheels it self, i miss the people more.  
sunday we drove home, and it was so weird, like something out of the bradey bunch...octopus's garden came on, and mom, dad and i all started singing to it, we might have all been off tune, but it was so perfect all the same. 
once i got home and online i was confronted by this strange character, don't know who it is, if you do let me know, just wondering...
like33mike: bitch
polarREL: well hello to you too
like33mike: ur gunna die
polarREL: eventually, yes
so yeah...always love hate mail..., but i love, love mail even more! 
Punkyelhsa: darling i miss you
Punkyelhsa: everything about you-face, hair, smell, willingness to love and amazing ability to make me feel like everything will be okay, despite how much of a mess it is at the time. 
Punkyelhsa: you make me feel like dancing and laughing and smiling and growing younger, all at the same time.

i was talking to my big brobro adam, and he asked me if everything is going alright, i had to stop and think for a minute, and itold him that there really isn't anything wrong right now in my life. but the more i think about it, the more empty i feel. there is something missing, what it is i am not sure. it would be very helpful for someone to just let me know so i can stop thinking about it.  thanks.

anyway, i had the weirdest dream last night! it wasn't bad, but weird. i was with dan katz, who is a senior who i have met like 3 times last year when we drove him to school, i doubt he even knows who i am, let alone my name. anyway, i was all kissy kissy with him and walking around on a golf course with him holding hands. SO WEIRD! 

anyhoodles, how is it guys are sooo clueless about everything? it is quite pathetic infact. 
InvisibleM00se: If I knew how to work the thing in the kitchen I would make a pie everyday

 InvisibleM00se: I had a crazy thought
polarREL: ???

ashley came down this weekend and even though i only got to spend a few hours with her, i still feel like some of her beautifulness rubbed off on me! she made me the most gorgeuos collage for my wall, reading "all you need is love" which is now hanging over my bed. i love her so much, i only wish she could have stayed longer.

      i think the number one reason i love the begining of each new year (and month for that matter) is b/c you get a new calender! mine is  the beatles!  which makes me oh so happy every time i look at my dreamy music idols, scratch that, legends. yumm. 


When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide
And I stop and I turn and I go for a ride
And I get to the bottom and I see you again
Well do you, don't you want me to break you

You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer.

some boys just suck my tush!

 I'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink
I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink

I'm so tired i don't know what to do
I'm so tired my mind is set on you
I wonder should i call you but I know what you'd do

You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know i can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got for a little peace of mind

I'm so tired, I'm feeling so upset

      today i sat around and mainly did nothing, honsetly. i did a little homework, but thats about it. 
last night i had to babysit, which is always fun...until their dog barfs and i have to clean it up! it was sooo growdy! i usually love dogs, but this one just gets on my nerves. it is a lab, which are usually like the best, this one just barks all the time, and when you walk in the door it jumps on you, and i really dislike that. makes me very nervous. and it also randomly barfs! eewwy. 
anyway, today i was so happy it snowed. all day i sat at my desk and just watched the snow fall. i love how my room is set up. how my desk if right up agaisnt the window. and there is like this added depth b/c there are some tree branches pretty close and then another tree a little further away. it is very cool. at one point when the sun was going down everything looked pink. it was so cool (thank you polution!)

now i have to go do my chemistry project even though there might now even be school tomorrow, which would be nice, even a delay would be great.

      alright, so snow came and got me all off track with everything, which is fine. so now i am getting my license tomorrow, which i am so excited about, i am just trying to figure out where will i go first? today during behind the wheel while we were driving around beside having everyone look at us b/c of the huge cheese-wedge-sign on top of the car; we saw an accident, complete with paramedics and all. my instructure started talking about it, all i could think about was the fact that it could happen any time, and it doesn't even have to be b/c of me. it is fricken scary. 
it's also another step in growing up, which is just about as scary. i am getting letters from different collages, telling me why i should apply to their school. i don't even want to think about it. it just leads to me thinking about what i am going to do after college...and AHHH! just makes me want to scream, curl up into a ball and stay in my moms arms forever. at the same time i want to experiance all that life has to offer me, i want to go out into the world and live my life as best as i can, but it is just so scary and coming so fast. it's so true what they say, 'when your young, you want to be older. when your old you want to be younger.' well i when i was little i couldn't wait for the day i would have my license, it really is a big turning point in ones life, at least mine. when i was little time used to go by so slowly. all i wanted was to be a cool 16 year old who could drive around, go to parties and have a million friends. now i am 16 and i feel like the same little kid, just with longer legs. when i was younger i guess i thought some amazing transformation would take place when you get to be in your teens, but really you are the same person, just with a few more complex thoughts. and i can't for the life of me figure out how i got from there to here in what seems like so little time. 
well, thats enough rambling about not wanting to grow up. i guess i better get used to the idea. 

just hope after school activities aren't cancelled tomorrow..otherwise i dunno when i will get my license....

      spirit013: yeah i was thinking would be so perfect if humans like something as much as they did the first time everytime
spirit013: so every sunny day, every bite of ice cream, every picture you see is as amazing as it ever could be
polarREL: that would be glorious, wouldn't it?
spirit013: you know what i mean
polarREL: yeah
polarREL: but it wouldn't be the same without the bad
spirit013: like for mac and cheese for instance, the first time i had it it was like an orgy in my mouth and now its same old same old
spirit013: yes, but wouldnt it be cool too if every good thing was just that much better
polarREL: sorry, maybe someday after having really crappy mac and cheese you will have the most amazing mac and cheese and rediscover
spirit013: and also every death is as awful as the first death you knew
spirit013: not because you want to hurt
polarREL: but b/c you have to?
spirit013: just because it makes life sooooooo much more valuable
spirit013: where as now, people die everyday and most of the time it just doesnt set in that we arn't invincable
spirit013: sorry i'm done now
spirit013: that was just on my mind and you set it off with your blog
spirit013: good job
spirit013: star for you

      well, today was a pretty crappy day. i was in the worse mood ever. every little thing was making me so upset. things that would normaly roll off me like a drop of water were pissing me off to no end. and i have no idea why, which made me even more upset. but it turned out ok in the end. i went out with staci and eric after school and we went to get me some art supplies and fooled around at the plaza. we made mean/rude comments to the people smoking, but it was ok b/c "THEY DON"T KNOW ME!" as staci would say, pluse they are the ones poluting my air. anyway, it made me feel a lot better to hang out with them, even if it was just for an hour or so. 

i was watching the news, and i hate the fact that bad things happen, i am a semi-believer in things happening for a reason. and i have come to think something really bad has to happen every once in a while to show you how good the good things are and to remind you how presious life is. just like 9/11 and the space shuttle...after something like that happens everyone stops and takes a look around, sees their life as it really is, and slowy, yet surely their life slips back into the normal mode..and yet again something happens to slow them down. the thing i am wondering is, does it always have to be such a horable event to make people realise how lucky they are? just with my bad day, it makes me appreciate how wonderful my good days are. 

today i started weight training in PE, and realised how incredably weak i am...quite sad, but i don't realluy care. tomorrow i start pottery which makes me oh so happy! i have been waiting for this day for a long time, almost as exciting as getting my license! (which is happening this month too!)

      well surprisingly enough today was a good day, even though i had 5 tests and only 3 core classes.....yeah. 2 in government, one in chemistry, one during lunch for math, then one in math. fun stuff....not really, not at all. 
but the day turned out fine when ian came home with me and we dyed his BRIGHT orange jacket what was supose to be black but what is now brown. it actually looks pretty good. that whole process took a while and in the ends my hands were a few shades darker then they should be, still are, but it's all good. while the jacket was being dyed we found a tape and listned to it,...it was soooo bad. i dunno why anyone would want to listen to that crap let alone own the tape. but it is did have a cool name something to the effect of "the day the penguins flew" well, i thought it was cool, then there was ian who hates penguins, so he hated the tape before i even put it in. it was so much fun trying to dye his arm and watching him clean my sink with oxyclean that doesn't work (stupid infomercials that lie!!) when i was driving him home i kinda almost killed us...but not really. i cut some one off and in my panic of him beeping at me(for what seemed like a minute, but was more like 10 seconds) i turned ly head and started going onto the curb, ian had to yell "ariel get back on the road!" before i knew what had happend. t'was quite scary, but as staci would say "everyones still alive!"
tonight my neighbor came by with her nefue who is my age and is ooohhh soooo dreamy. very hot, very sexy, very hunky, and very short! but umm yeah, he is very yummy, i like to stare.
ian also told me that one of my favorite songs is about LSD!  L ucy in the  S ky with  D iamonds, i never thought about it i guess, it was a tad depressing, but i still like the song either way. "a girl with calidascope eyes!!!!!" 
time to study for a few more tests!!!

        teenage life   
it pretty much sucks as a whole. everyday you come home feeling like your life is insignificant, there is not point to your existance,  your fat and ugly, your stupid, no one is ever going to love you for you, no one really knows the REAL you, and that no one else in the entire world understands and knows how you are feeling. oh, and don't forget the age old question of 'why/how are we here?' well, i wish i could be one of the first teenager to say i haven't thought any of those things, but the fact is i have thought all of them, i still do sometimes. so right now my mind set is: just try and be as happy as you can, if this time is going to suck you might aswell try and get a few good days out of it. 
i was talking to my big bro adam who i really inspire to be like. he really loves life. and i was asking him if it was just me and the people i know that are feeling this way, and mainly he told me that it's not just me and my friends, it's more like my whole school and every other high school for that matter. but you really just have to remember that when life gives you lemons you have to make orange juice. =) [think about it for a while]. 
i know sooooo many/too many people who are depressed and just think life isn't going to get any better and that it has nothing to offer them. number one i want to give all of them a giant hug then try and show them that life is such a gift, and they shouldn't throw it away with drugs, alcohol, depression and doubt that there is no one who loves you. i really do believe that every single person is truely loved by at least one other, whether they know it or not. 
i know everyone has their bad days (sometimes bad weeks or months even) but there has to be a reason for you to be here, so what if you never find out what that reason is. advice for all you unhappy with your  crappy teenager life: go kick yourself in the head for being such a dumbass! life is the best, i mean, without life you wouldn't even know you are unhappy. and if you think you are unhappy why don't you go and try and change it and become happy, and if you can't change it then find a way around it, cause no matter what no one or thing has the right to take away your happiness.

      woah-hey!
natalie and kirby are both going to prom (kirby's going with pipen!) and at first i thought i was jealous, but then i realized i'm really not. i have no desire to go and get all dressed up and dance with 11th and 12th graders. but whateve...i kinda feel jealous for staci. since she hangs out with them a lot more then i do, and i am sure they are going to be talking about it a lot. uugghh, i am still kinda mad at them for what they were saying about weight, and how they really don't get what fat is and the value of a pound. ggrr. 

funny story about random man in art supply store (i named him Jarry...with an A!)
THE GYRATOR: do anything fun today?
polarREL: pottery, then micheals where i saw this really good looking guy (not like overly hot, like super model gorgous, but pretty attractive i think for a regular person. i dunno why, but just caught my eye as not a regular, everyother guy kinda look.) and i wasn't smart enough to start a conversation with him. so, insted i followed him for a little while then asked him if there were are spyrographs in the store.
THE GYRATOR: well when u go back u should be bold, and just be like, hi im ariel and i just found u intriguing
THE GYRATOR: and strike up a convo
polarREL: ......or.......i can run and hide behind the tall plants
polarREL: watch him with banoculars
polarREL: he wasn't wearing a name tag....and i dunno when he works, so i have no idea if i will ever see him again
THE GYRATOR: thats why u go there tomorrow and stay there from opening to closing and take note of his schedule
polarREL: hahahaha, eeww, i'm not eric
THE GYRATOR: sorry sorry, its rubbed off
THE GYRATOR: get the crazy off of me
THE GYRATOR: ERICS PASSED IT ON, GET IT OFF
THE GYRATOR: DONT CATCH IT

i got little kidie paints today! (after i watched Jarry for awhile) they were cheeper then the big kid stuff and i got more, so take that society!....i dunno, just smile and nod...

      best part of today by far....(besideds talking to ashley)....today at lunch i had THE BEST CHOCOLATE MILK, EVER! ian kept saying it was the same as the stuff that some in those dinky cartons, but i knew it tased different. and finally, after more then half the bottle was gone, i realized that it was different...b/c it was made with WHOLE MILK! thats like fat in a jar, but it was soooooo worth the 215 calories! mmhh ::drools thinking about the creaminess of it:: 
mustafa is being a jerk face again and saying stuff about ian behind his back and it is just getter really annoying, and arrgghh. 
i love shopping in my dads closet! a lot of my t-shirts are my dads old shirt. i love them unlike any other mainly b/c no one else has them and b/c they are just that cool, and and b/c they don't cost me anything. so today i was going out to price club (b/c my family enjoys living there) and i needed a jacket so i just grabed the first one i saw. it turned out to be a jacket that was once my grandfathers, now my dad and now might be my favorite article of clothing! it is a off white (unbrushed-tooth) color, 70's style wind breaker...no swishy material like the 90's ones. but i am very much enjoying it, and only upset that i didn't find it sooner, although it is quite perfect for springs chilli nights!

polarREL: hahahaha
polarREL: it's miss usa, not america

      oh my goodness, i am so mad right now. but i need to write about my good weekend which was just destroyed by eric. i am going to push that as far away as i can right now....
friday i saw veiw from the top with staci. it was funny, mike myers was about the only good part of it. ian was there too with one of his other friends. we went home pretty early only b/c it was soooo foggy outside and i was and thrilled about driving in it.it was actually pretty scary driving init by myself. 
saturday i got a phone call from ian saying "let's go do stuff!" so we did. first we went over to staci's...but she wasn't there, good thing we used his cell phone to call her house while we were standing on the front porch! we briefly went back to my house just so ian could see my new sofa, then we decided to go to wal-mart! just for fun. he is a bad direction giver...tends to tell you when to turn a little too late...but we got there and went through all the on-sale bins. he taught me what a teddy is, and not the stuffed bear kind. then we went over to rugged ware house, which i had never been to, and is much like a marshalls, in the whole idea of 'name brands for less'. i got a t-shirt and a skirt. he got a pair of mt. dew pants (who new a soda company made clothing?) he also got a BRIGHT bright orange jacket; it looks like a hunting jacket, but light weight. he got it for 6 bucks and we are hping it will work if we dye itblack or a dark color. we shall see....when we went back to my house we ate ice cream and crackers on my kitchen floor "b/c there is nothing on tv" so we staired at the refridgerator...fun stuff. we also just talked there for a while, until i had to take him home. 
later i got picked up by peter to go to becky's b-day party. we went to the ultra-zone to play lazer tag, which was quite some fun. it was more fn just being with everyone though, cause we really didn't get to play all that long. why does everyone smoke? doesn't anyone have anything better to have their money on? anyway, after lazertag we went back to beckys and she opened presents, she got lots of fun random things. i opted not to spend the night just cause i like my own bed. 
today i did almost nothing. homework, mope around the house, say bye to ethan, go to jew school, thats really about it. i talked to ian and had a nifty little conversation with him on the phone, then got off and had a huge mood swing of madness directed at eric. i hope i never see him again, truely. i and i finally told him that. before i had no reason to, and tonight he gave me one. uugghh, crreeeppppy!
now back to school for another week,...hopefully i can get through this one without a mental break down again.

      it's on every channel, you can't get away from it if you try. i realized today that when i am older and have kids of my own i can say i was alive during a war....it's a sad fate that both my parents and grandparents (and even great-grandparents, if they were still around)  were all able to say the same, even before today. what is wrong with this picture? is peace really that hard a concept in any languege? i hope that my kids will never be able to say the same words "i lived during a war."

      on war. from maganda.org, i couldn't have said it better if i tried...

i don't know how to describe it but maybe you know
                                how it is i feel. the clearest picture i can paint is a
                                mother's empty arms as she mourns her only child.
                                then, i multiply it times 250,000 and that is only a
                                fraction of the fear, grief and panic that fills my
                                heart.

      i stayed home today, just b/c if i didn't i think i would have had a mental break down. i slept for over 15 hours. i layed in my bed staring into space for at least another hour, then got off my lazy bum and had some lucky charms and watched forrest gump. ian and staci called me after school was over, worried about how i was. it was nice of them to call, i really apprechate them doing so. 
meehh, i have to go to school tomorrow, and i know it is going to take forever to end. at least it is a friday.

      somedays you just start to wonder why. why things are the way they are, and a thousand other whys. once again i feel as if i am five asking my mom over and over 'why?' most days i don't care why, i avoid the subject infact, b/c it spins me flying into a ditch of negative thoughts. and even more not fun moods. i don't get how it all works. how one day everything is fine and dandy, and the next you just wish that there were no days at all. wouldn't it all be easier if there just wasn't anything. i hate it some much! i sound like i am going to kill myself or just really pmsy, which by the way i am neither. but right now i just really don't want to be HERE. where would i rather be?...no where. just the absence of me. a break from everything and everyone. 
every little thing is just making it worse. i try to pull my self out of this 'funk' but it's not working and i don't know what it will take. 
last night when i was talking to ian he made a good point 'have to have the bad times to recognize the better times.'  yeah thats nice and all, but why am i having a bad time!? i don't even know what is wrong, i don't know why i don't feel like myself. ughhh, i just want to fall asleep and never wake up again, i want to stay in my dreams, where nothing makes sence and none of it is real. this whole 'real world' thing is sucking butt right now.

Sábado, Março 15, 2003  
I don't even know if i can even explan correctly how awesome the past two days/nights have been. I spent Friday afternoon with Ariel. It was perfect. We went to target, Michaels, and McDonalds. Just being able to go to McDoanlds with her was the best thing ever. I love doing things with her and now we can do those little insignificant things that are so much better when done with friends. Her freedow still scares me a little because if my friends are starting to grow up then that means i have to and that just freaks the hell out of me. Ariel and i looked at our new beads as she complained about her minty milk shake. "I'll show you mint!"   
Today was almost the exact same thing, but even though it was a re-run it was still the greatest. Ariel came over and helped me rake the leaves out of my yard. Stupid parents. Then we went to town center to do randomness. WE-nt back to her house and watched "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" which i enjoyied, probably because i'm Ian and am a vegetarian... CRAZY!!! Ariel went to the playground and just talked, and talked. there probably isn't a subject that i didn't talk about today. Seriously. Then from there Ariel dropped me off at Stacis again. I love being so comfortable with people that you are able to sit and talk for such long periods of time. ITS THE GREATEST!!!

      I LOVE IAN CAMPBELL.
the past two days were so much fun, we spent so much time together and with the extra freedom of me having a car it is the best. we got to just hang out one on one and there was not one second were i wasn't having fun. we went to michaels (so many beads!), starbucks, target (ugly shirt! and oh so many cards!), his house (racked leaves with a comb) my house, mcdonalds (this tastes like mint!!), staci's house (i love her too), to an elementry school playground. oh man it was great, we had such an awesome conversation while lying on twin plastic red slides stairing up at the sky. watching the cluds mask the moon and bright blue sky. we talked about life, why we are here, what does it all mean. one of those conversations where there is more shared silence of thinking then actual speeking. 

I LOVE STACI BARTON.
she makes my day go round. never a day where i don't think of her and her smile. we have done a lot in the past few days aswell working on avoiding a certain someone...who i might add is hopefully taken care of. we talk so much and never run out of things to say. she helps me though troubled times (OH MY GOD! WHAT DO I DO!? WHAT DO I DO!?! I AM GOING TO HIT THE CAR!!!!!!....it's ok, no one is dead).

      AAHHH!!! not a very fun day. besideds singing songs from chicago with clare in english. in pe i yelled at some kid who was really getting on my nervse, i went almost the whole period without saying anything to him, then he said something to me and it set me off. and my last mean comment was "go learn english then come back" it was really mean, but meerr. in spanish we had an oral test and i failed it, i felt so stupid. and after school i had math tutor which was just icky. i think i'll go run...

      and of course, how could i forget!....IAN COMES BACK TO SCHOOL TOMORROW!!!! i miss him so much. this weekend i went over to his house to hang out with my bestest bud. we watched the second half of brave heart, such a wonderful movie, i want it ::hint hint:: we talked and looked at his beatles albums, lucky little duckling! i hope he is ok tomorrow in school, i mean saturday he got short-breathed by walking up the stairs...poor ian. 
i love him oh so much, unlike someone who is getting on my nervse! he is always there and i don't know how to get rid of him. i don't want to say his name cause that would just be cruel, but really he is just annoying me. ::sigh::

oh! also natalyas surprise party was so much fun! we watched the ring, which i did not want to do. it was pretty scary, but not nearly as scary  as it would have been in a dark theater, of course there was peter sitting beside me scaring me by pinching me! meanie head. but patrick was on the other side to hold my hand. 
sleepy time for ariel...such a long day.

      ohhh goodness, what a long day. 
first period in english we had a sub, which is usually a good thing, too bad it was a sub. who wanted to play teacher. to say the least i spent at least 15 minutes arguing with him. 
in spanish some junior boys came into my class from their class for whatever reason and were told to sit behind me and gillian. it started out with them just talking loudly. then came the little notes. one reading "give me a call ###-####, or give me your number" i just laughed and shook my head, not knowing what to think. i was flattered, but at the same time i didn't believe it was anything more then a joke. so insted of writing back or saying anything i just smiled and shook my head. then came the next note "do you have a b/f?" i didn't say anything to that one either. then we took a test, and all during it they desided to play the 'penis game' who can say penis the loudest in ariel's ear basically. every once in a while they would throw in a few other words aswell as some sex sounds! fun times! don't know how good i did on that test....i really hope i wasn't just the brunt of a mean joke, i am sure i was, why would anyone ask for my number?...thats what i thought. everyone kept telling me that i should call the number he gave me, just to see if it is his number, but what in the world am i supose to say? 
after spanish class i had spanish tutor which was pretty boring, then i walked over to pottery. and i am still kinda bitter about that. first off my teacher combined the high school and middle school class so it would be easier to have all of us on one day. needless to say they get on my nervse; pottery has always been a place form eo t come and let go, relax and just release. with all the chatter and annoying conversations going on around me it was annoying. second some girl took the wheel i have been using for the past 5 years! i ALWAYS use the same wheel, that is just how it is and meehh, habit. i'll get over it, but it just bothered me. 
i did bring my appilacion springs application into the store today and hopefully i will be getting a possitive call back some time soon. i think it would be really cool to get to work there. then my mom took me to penara bread for dinner and sat and talked, it was great.AND later on my dad gave me a sheet of bubble rab! which just made my day! =)

      alright, so i got my license!!whhheeeeee!!!! it is one of the best feelings i have ever had! really, driving and no one sitting next to you, just complete silance, i have never felt so alone and yet at the same time so free. it really is something i have wanted since i was really little, and it was well worth the imagining. each time i get behind the wheel it feels like it is just so natural, but yet so weird. i have been enjoying going where i need to and just going places i want to go.
well the last week has been kinda hard. monday, the same day i got my license, ian went to the hospital for a colapsed lung(the right one). monday at school i could tell something was wrong b/c ian never misses school. it wasn't until around 9 o'clock at night after i had called his house and cell phone about 5 times each, that he called me. i almost broke down in tears when he was telling me what happend. it is just so scary how it happend so randomly. at the time he was a little loopy from all the pain killers and meds he was on, so i found him repeating him self a lot and just kinda trailing off. i was so scared, and although he said he was fine and he didn't want any visiters, it was hard to believe since he had a tube sticking out his side helping him breath. 
so even though he didn't want any one to see him, staci, my mom and i went to see him on tuesday. you could not ever imagine the look of utter discust on his face when we  poked our heads in the room. he let us in and we stayed with him for about an hour just talking. even though he didn't say so i know he was glad to see us, and to get the jelly bellys i brought for him.     
he had to stay in the hospital until tuesday night, needless to say i haven't slept very well this week b/c i have been worring about him. even though i say him, talked to him everyday, i still had that little unsureness in me. 
TIME FOR HILLARYS BIRTHDAY DINNER!!

Punkyelhsa: are you okay?
polarREL: yeah i guess
polarREL: just sleepy and such
Punkyelhsa: Okie dokie. =) Do you know what?
polarREL: what my loverly?
Punkyelhsa: I idolize you, in every way. I dont' think there's a single other person I know that can make me feel quite the way that you do. You're a magnifescent girl, and you're going to be a wonderful adult, as much as that terrifies you. Let time take its course, and try and rest in the passage of time through and in the universe.
Punkyelhsa: Because you don't have anything to be afraid of, not being who you are.
Punkyelhsa: Not being so wonderful.
polarREL: oh ashey, i love you so much
Punkyelhsa: Oh, ariel, I love you so much

polarREL: i love you. you make my days sun shinny yellow and bright
Punkyelhsa: I like the sun. =)
Punkyelhsa: And I like you. Therefore, that was a pretty hefty compliment
polarREL: like the trash bags?
Punkyelhsa: Much like.

i wish she lived closer to me....

      PROM WAS AWESOME! i really had a great time. there were a lot of people there i knew and it was just a lot of fun. 
the whole night i was thinking about staci though, who now has a boyfriend!!!!! SO HAPPY! 
saturday i went over to peters to work on a project then to staci's where natalie and kirby already were. so we talked and hung out for a while, then anissa came over and we watched 8 mile; crappy movie, i thought, everyone else just kept saying how hot eminme is...i don't agree. after the movie i thought i would go home and sleep, but once i got home i was bored and didn't want to be home alone (my parents were in new york for the day). so i drove on over to ledos to visit shaundra and natalya at work. i hung out there for a while just talking with them, then on my way home i stoped by ians house. i became creepy stalked friend when i called him on my cell and said "come outside..." we spent 3 hours talking in my car. listening to music and just chilling. it was so awesome, i love just spening time with him. i really needed just to spned alone time with him; i haven't in a while and i missed just chilling with him. i don't even remember half of what we talked about, but it doesn't matter, just being with him is awesome. 
i got home at like 11 and just went to bed, i was so tired.

      "back to school, back to school, to prove to dadda my not a fool. i've got my lunch packed up, my boots tied tight, i hope i don't get in a fight, ooohhh back to school."  good old billy boy

today was alright, started off a little shaky...i was supose to get a ride from drew,...he never came. i dunno which is worse, worried that something happend and a really good reason he couldn't come or the feeling of being forgotten. oh well, i'm over it now, i am just going to laugh if he shows up to my door tomorrow morning. school was alright, nothing new really. went to the career center in english and learned that i only need about a 2.5-3.0 to get into some of the arts schools i want to go to, so i was all like SCORE! then in PE staci and i kinda said screw it to the mile and just waled three laps with patrick (yes a mile is 4, but by the time we finished out 3rd they had stopped timing). that was actually a lot of fun. i found out that patrick wants to be a pyrotecnichain (aka making fireworks and settin' stuff on fire for a living) which is aesome, b/c i am paranoid that he is going to be like 30 and still living at home with his parents....that is until we become tug boats! in art i had a very nice little talk with my teacher about what she does, i never knew that she was into sculpture. amazing what you can learning by talking to people! THEN is the class of death...spanish...we got new seats, which is really the least of my worries, but i still hate where i am sitting. i got a 37 out of 60 on a test!!! good thing i see a tutor once a week! 

i came home and all i have done is talk online and to ashley on the phone! 
some great conversations!

wellroundedwolf: ill  speak to ya later ariel zimmerman
polarREL: zimman!!!!!! no man!
wellroundedwolf: in my mind its zimmerman
wellroundedwolf: because that sounds soooo much cooler
wellroundedwolf: you know it does
wellroundedwolf: zimman? thats like somthing you eat on passover...zimmerman...thats like a race car driver

after coolios convo with him. he has got to be the sweetest guy in the world. he loves becky soooo much!
Elementsk8er513: you have the cooles laugh, its great :-D
polarREL: =) thanks....
polarREL: why is it so cool?
Elementsk8er513: i dont know! its just bitchin!

      i think i might have new monentary favorite song....'three ways " by the wallflowers. i just like the sound of it. (not that anyone is going to read this, but here are the lyrics...)

 There’s three ways out of every box
Fall out the bottom
Or you crawl out the top 
There’s three ways
Out of every, every box
But if you can’t find your way out
Then you just burn it
To the ground
Then you’ll disappear
Like smoke
Into the clouds

There’s three ways off a merry-go-round
You either jump
Or you let it slow down
There’s three ways
Off a merry-go, merry-go round
But if you can’t put your foot down
Then you just burn it
To the ground
Then you walk away
Real slow
Back into the crowd

There’s always somebody there for a laugh
Then you’re the only one
That’s left
Now that’s what you get
Left behind in the wreck

There’s three ways off a burning bridge
You pray for rain
Or you learn how to swim
There’s three ways off of every
Burning bridge
But if you can’t find strength
And you quit
Then you can just burn up
And sink
Then you’ll drift away
Real slow
Down into the ground

i just like it lots. 
-----------------------------------------
today was so much fun. i hung out with staci and ian. i missed them, i never realize how much i miss them until i hang out with them again, they are the best. i took them out to get custard b/c i really wanted them to try it. then we went and rented the movie jackass, which was amussing in some parts and other you just feel bad that there are people THAT dumb in this world. i like triger happy tv better and the british guy with his larger then a midget cell phone scareing people "HELLO!!? NO! I'M RUNNING!! WHAT!?! I'M ON THE CELL!!!" aahh, get me laughing each time...anyway, we drove around a lot too, that was fun. then we took ian home and staci and i went to mcdonalds for dinner, there was a piece of bark in my salad, i should have sued...oh well. now i am kinda dreding going to school tomorrow, cause not only are the days going to FEEL longer, but they WILL be longer! such crap. oh well.

      more beachy weather today, wahoo! and boo for passover tonight. passover has got to be my least favorite jewish holiday ever. it truely is a stupid holiday. yeah sure i love coming up here and spending time with my family and such, but the holiday it self is lame. i mean, the whole point of it (for you heathans out there) is to feel somewhat of how moses and the israelites felt out there in the desert with out bread. well i got news for ya (or for who ever will listen) we are now a free people, we should be celebrating what moses did for us, not depriving ourselves. they did those things so we now wouldn't have to live in salvery, there for we should not be trying to sympathise with them, but thank them. and i truely think moses and all his peeps wouldn't want us to be sad or "suffer" and deprive ourself of anything, but insted rejoice in what we do have. ok, enough passover crapolah for now.

ok, so today i:
 * read over a hundered pages in Holes, before i gave it to ian, even though i have read it 3 times before (only book i have ever read more then once, just cause it's soooo good, the movie is going to mess it up!)
 * watched staci disfigure my face in the paint program on the computer. she only laughed for like 3 hours about that.
 * got invited to prom by one of my friends! (so radnom, still in shock, can't stop smiling about the fact that he would invite ME!)
 * saw anger management, with what seemed like the rest of my school! 
 * hung around TC with everyone, learned about one of jon's and patricks interesting religions...i know a spell to raise the dead, betta watch out!
 * knocked over yellow "caution:wet floor sign" a few times in starbucks and blamed it on ian, who was being so much fun tonight.
those were the highlights of my day, no matter how dim they might be. =) 

tomorrow i drive to PA to visit my brobro ethan for the day and watch him sing, and hopefully go shopping! wheeee, then on sunday off to Mass. to spend the week with family and celebrate the worst jewish holiday ever...passover.  no beach for ariel...i think it snowed there the other day.

      today was an alright day. i ate way too much, telling myself that it's alright, even though i now i will regret it for the rest of the month.
ian was being a poohy head in art today, i don't even think he knew he was doing it. first he started off by insulting a picture i had been working on, and something that i really liked. i don't mind people cretiquing my work, but for some reason the way he said it and what he said it just really felt like he was telling me i suck and mainly i just can't do any better. i am sure he didn't mean it like that, but thats how i took it. then he desided to bring up something he and karen had talked about; how natalya and i are nagative and ruin the environment, or something like that. i wasn't as upset about this as natalya was, she took it more personal then i did i think. then it seemed when she got upset enough ian shifted the blame on to me. i was trying my best to ignore him, but he went off about how i wanted to say the word 'whatever' to dismiss him, which he hates. when really it was the last thing i was thinking about. honestly i was still hurt that he called my picture 'cartoonie.' it just really didn't feel like he was saying it in a friendly helping way i guess, more of a put down. oh well. the picture i drew in art today was an example of what i drew in my scetch book the night before, which i really like, a lot. it was really inspired by a conversation i had with staci some time ago. i had writen down in my journal a few things she had said about how everyone deserves to be loved. i liked it a lot at the time, hense why i wrote it down. i didn't know it would ever turn into something, but i really think those words are very powerful. anyway, last night i couldn't sleep so i turned on my black light and for a while i sat on my bed stairing at it. and i know your own art isn't supose to have an effect on you, but i felt like this girl i drew was pulling me in threw her eyes, these big, sad melting eyes. it was like someone calling out to me, maybe i was just tired and delutional, but it had an effect on me. maybe another reason why it hurt so much when ian said something mean about a picture that was just like it.

      only one more week, only one more week. i keep telling myself that. but i know that spring break is going to zoom by and soon enough we are going to be back in school for what is going to see like forever since there is 30 more minutes on each day. and our teacher are going to be stuffing information down our throats in order to 'prepare' us for the SOLs, which are a piece of shit all in them selves. then finals, something that that is possoble just as bad as the SOLs just a lot easier to study for and then end up cheating on. it's kinda sad to say, and i know i should feel bad about it, but i really don't, nor do a lot of other people. almost every single person i know in my classes, cheats. it is like a way of life, no one even gives a second thought to it. and i have thought about it before, but the over ridding emotion of the dred of getting a bad grade wipes that guilt away. i really don't feel bad when i cheat with a friend or two, it is actually something we have all been taught to do from an early age, i think; ya know, when a friend is in need you help them out. no one considerers cheating a bad thing, it is really helping a friend out. also if there wasn't so much presure from parents, teachers and just society in gerneral to get good grades so you can get into good colleges, then i really don't think people would cheat as much. i mean, i am in all the smart people clases (not bragging, just making a point) and there is just an insane amount of work. it really is too much to handle at this age. when i cheat on something i really don't think of it as being dishonest or demeaning myself at all, it is more like a 'screw you society', if that makes any sence. *sigh* the sadder part is that cheating really is everywhere, not only in schools (and the fact that i just used the word 'sadder').  and i know for a fact that my parents at my age did not have nearly as much work as i have now, and they are fine, got into good schools and yadda yadda yadda. i know i repeat myself a lot on this issue of society, but it is just one that seems to keep making me stay at home on weekends and pretending to do work.

      when i think about it today was a pretty horrable day, but i am still in a good mood. nothing good happend today, had math SOL which not so sure i passed, staci slapped me at lunch over a bite of a sandwich, got bad news about a wheels friend, and just nothing good happend. although when i was in the plaza america parking-lot it started to rain. as everyone else ran for cover, i started to walk slower and let the pouring rain soak me from head to toe. it felt so good and i even started to laugh a little at all the other people running for cover and walking under umbrellas; just b/c it's rain! water! it won't hurt you, and yet society tells us to flee from it! it is the stupidest thing ever. 

i hate stupid people. no, i take that back, i hate people who have the ability to be intellegant, but just act stupid. i pisses the hell out of me.

      well this weekend all my brothers were home and we had a "meet kate party". so on sunday there were a whole bunch of people over for munchies. i saw bruce all mighty with adam and kate on saturday beofre i had to go to work. where i found out that the other kid i work with (Sean) goes to my school. he is a junior and said he saw me there on friday...i told him that i had never seen him before in my whole life....work is going surprisingly well, it don't dred or hate it by any means and it gives me something to do. last night staci slept over, we had a really good conversation, about boys, what else? her talking about her boyfriend and me talking about feelings i still have for a certain someone. best line of the night  "i am going to shoot myself with a hammer" -staci , i don't remember what she was talking about but it was quite amussing. almost as good as the other day, what her driving teacher said to me....
**sitting in the back on my van waiting for staci's driving teacher to pick her up...he gets there, we get out and i close the doors, as he says**
dude:do you live in this neighborhood?
me:does this car looks like it belongs to someone who lives in this neighborhood?
dude:no,....it looks like someones car who smokes a lot of weed.

staci and i also discovered the fun of peep-holes...

tomorrow i have my chemistry SOL, which i am sure i am going to fail, i know nothing. and i have to give a presentation on Kenya,...fun fun fun! 

ian called me last night (after he tried to call staci!) and we talked for quite some time while he was lying on a sex stained bed near the beach. sometimes even though he isn't that far away or even if i have seen him a few days ago, i start to miss him. 

i don't think i have anything else importnat to say. i just feel so...blah.

       SPRING CONVENTION 2003 
RAIN, RAIN, RAIN, RAIN, RAIN. Thats all it did the whole weekend, but i still had a blast. 
On Thursday after ethan took me to see the matrix {which was amazing} i came home, packed and went off to get on the bus to be taken to a sleep away camp in west VA. On the way up we watched Fight Club and i did danielle's hair. Before i knew it we were there and getting our stuff off the bus. We got our name tags and it made my day that mine had a yellow ribbon on it reading "ASK ME". It was so that people who were interested in going on wheels could ask me questions, too bad no one did, but hey, i had a ribbon! while getting my new seaboard scrubs, which are like 10 sizes too big, two other people could fit in them with me...we shall have to try that later, i was greeted by mike, who was then forced into helping danielle and i carry our stuff back to our bunk. I was in the same bunk as danielle...and thats it. none of my other friends were in the same bunk as us. And yes half the reason of USY is to meet new people, but i hardly get to see the people i already know, and that really is one of the main reason i go to so much USY stuff. Anyway, after dropping my stuff off i got to see a bunch of people i haven't seen in the longest time. That night we did ice breakers, which i think most of the time are ather pointless, but this time it was fun, especially since danny wise decided to single me out in this ‘moo game' it's not a hard game, the point is to get an unsuspecting person to yell ‘moo' very loudly, i was that lucky person who ended up in the fetal position in the corner after turning bright red and realizing i was yelling ‘moo' to the whole room. After games i don't really remember what we did but i know i was unhappy about going back to my bunk, where i could not fall asleep. 
I tried my best throughout the weekend to spread my SARS on to others...by the end of the week many had SARS like symptoms such as myself...mwahaha!
Friday was election day. a very stressful time for some and a rather boring time for others. I was caught in the middle, seeing as who a few of my closest friends were running for regional board which is a tremendous job. First up matt welik won president which is pretty awesome considering he is only a senior and was running against a junior. Shiri won SA/TO easily against the drop down candidate. Then jacob wolf with a very cute ‘do you believe in magic?' speech won, he looked so adorable in his tux, top hat and white gloves. Steven won communications and i am so proud of him, he really deserves to be it. and even with a kickass nomination song written by danielle and myself which was in perfect time i might add, unfortunately hillary did not win, but i am still proud f her for having the guts to run in the first place, i am sure she is upset, but she will over come it and she still has another year where she can run! Before shabbos came we had some free time. I just hung out with some friends and tried not to get too wet out in the rain. We had some boring study groups and some speeches. Saturday got up about ten minutes before we had to be at services, i just put a skirt on over my pjs and went off for the ‘mind' services which was suppose to get us to meditate, it was relaxing to sit there with my eyes closed. During free time i talked with jacob who let me have his extra camera b/c i forgot to remember to bring mine, such a sweety, and told steven that if he doesn't get his first kiss before he turns 18 then i would kiss him. Oohh poor steven, as long as he doesn't get so desperate and try to do stuff with morgan. I also spent time with zach. He is such an awesome guy to hang out with. Our relationship is completely plutonic, even though just about anyone else would think otherwise. He is just a touchy-feely person, but he makes my day so wonderful and i never stop laughing when i am with him. I met his friend noah at services that night, he is a pretty interesting guy, he and i both like eye liner and eye shadow, and he has the same shade nail polish as me! There was a speeker who told like 5 stories, none of which i listened to....ehh. after dinner was the dance. I danced a little, but got bored and just didn't feel like dancing so i ended up going in to watch zoolander, which is such a funny movie. After the movie i went back to the dance and got my promised dance from marc. And we watched a slide show of pictures from throughout the year. When we were told to all go back to our bunks, i went with hillary and allison to the boys bunk until got kicked out. We spent the next few hours peeking out the window, waiting for the conclers to go away so we could go back into the boys bunk. I ended up sleeping with hillary and was the best sleep i had the whole time i was there, so warm and comfy! Sunday i got out of hillarys and wearing the same thing i had on since the night before went to services and then breakfast, where we sat for a few hours listening to ravid, installing the new board and just other people talking. Then we had to say our goodbyes and get on the bus to go home. I got two seats to myself, put my head phones on, curled up in a ball and slept the whole time. 
When i got home and was talking to staci, who had called me for all the juicy detail of my weekend i realized how much i really love USY! I forget when i go so long without seeing some of these people. people who are so nice and caring, and willing to talk. People who would do anything for you in a heart beat, and put a smile on your face. People with so much ruach and spirt that it makes you want to get up and dance. People who you feel like you have known forever even if you haven't see them for ages. People who are so comfortable that they can come up and double hump you![don't ask] I really just love being with these people, it is as simple as that. Time always flies when with them and i wouldn't trade these events for anything. I feel sorry that not all my other nonjewish friends can't take part in these event and even if they are in a youth group, i truely don't think there is anything like USY. Maybe a biased opinion, but oh well. 
Anyway, i had a blast and can't wait until encampment in August, until then thankfully i have my license and a car and i hope to see these people a lot more often over this summer.  
if i forgot anything, sorry to all of you who where there and feel forgotten, i am extremly tired and can hardly remember how to type.

P.S.- i got a job! at CVS. this past week i had my first two days, both went alright and i actually don't mind going there to work. tadah! growing up! so scarey!

everyone just wants a piece of the pie!

today i threw 13 pots for my brothers wedding. {incase i haven't said before,...adam asked if i could make vases for his wedding this summer, about 25ish. so of course i said yes, i have been slaking off for say ohh about the last 5 months....today i went to two sessions of pottery b/c i was making one up. so all i did was sit there and throw, and throw and throw...so i threw 13 vases, pluse another bowl just for the heck of it!} my arms are so sore from centering about 40lbs. of clay [13 vases, each at least 3lbs. of clay..you do the math] as i told someone earlier about my class..."polarREL: i don't know anyone else who goes there, so i don't talk to anyone except the teacher. i am off in my own little world, and since i have been doing it for like 5 years i am pretty good at it (not being cocky, just stating the truth, pluse it's like the only thing i am good at and better then other people at) so people are always like "wow, thats awesome" or just complementing my stuff, and well i like it....is that bad? it's like a need to feel better then other people..." i guess if you don't understand that then either you are just good at everything or a bigger person then i and don't need to feel like you are better at something. 

this is the last week of extended days! thatnk goodness, it was really getting annoying, 30 minutes does nothing, just 10 more minutes to talk in each class, seriously. gov., chem., lunch (almost saw a bitch fight in the hallway, but it got broken up...shame), art, and math, pretty boring day. then i had spanish tutor where i felt like a nincompoop b/c i couldn't remember anything! but then over to pottery. and even though i dislike some of the kids in my class (little 8th graders, who never shut up! i really hope i wasn't that annoying when i was in in middle school) i had a good time. then home, where i called and said  HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO RONYA  's answering machine. and got some bad/horrable news about another wheels friends who isn't doing so hot. but then off to pottery again. where is there were a bunch of beginer adults. so they were all in awe of my skillz. and it was so much more plesant in that class. no annoying gossip about how likes who, or which teacher is mean. i wish i could go to the adult class always. 
well thats my day, take it or leave it....it's your fault you read all of these ramblings.....

      HAPPY MOTHERS DAY!!
well, ethan is back home and i just realized how much i enjoy being the only one at home. it's really not that bad...yet. 
friday staci, ian and i went to see singing in the rain at school. it was pretty good. i wasn't sure how they were going to make it rain, but for a high school play they made it work pretty well. sam is the most adorable thing of my life, so energetic and expressive. 
saturday ian and i went out to target and got pressents for our moms. then watched part of harry potter 2, his DVD player messed up and we couldn't finish it all. then i had to babysit which was easy. 
sunday i slept, and slept, got up ate some ceral, then slept some more. i watched catch me if you can with my mom, which was pretty good. then ethan took us out to dinner. (p.s. if you go to ruby tuesdays, don't get the spinach and artichoke dip stuff, made me want to puke when i got home.)

      today i woke up at the unearthly (on a sunday) hour of 7 o'clock to work in the synagogue kitchen, fun times....or not. then i came home and slept while my parents ganked my car to go get some of ethans stuff at college. i was upset with them for taking my car so i went on ebay and bid on a wicked cool pair of doc martin boots. i dunno if i will get them, depends if anyone else out bids me, hopefully not though, i'll know on friday. then i had jew school where i sat around for a while then got my picture taken.

      today was pretty awesome. went to car wash for a few momentos, didn't let them wash my car though. it would have cost more for them to wash my car then money i had for donations. i picked up ian and alex and waited around at my house for other people. then walked over to the field and  played KICKBALL!!!! !!! it was awesome! 11 people, 1 bright yellow ball from CVS, 7 inings, 28 to 26, my team won! afterwards some people came back to my house and we just chilled until it was time for them to go home. right before it was time for jon, patrick and ian to go we had a conversation about the world, and life and all that crazy stuff which i will never have the answers to. it makes you think in circles and just makes me feel sick. but it is so interesting to here what other people think and feel. we also talked about religion and fears we have, not small ones like passing a class, but big ones like death and being accepted; i couldn't think of what mine was....
also my great aunt died today. it is sad but not shocking, she has been sick for some time. she was 79 years old and alone. i think that is one of my biggest fears....being alone. 

last night i saw x-men2 with ian and it was fricken awesome! not even half way through the movie i leaned over to ian and told him i want to buy the movie. it was so amazing. i think it was better then the first one, and i thought the first one was pretty darn good. i will probably see this one a few more times in the theater, only problem is paying for it. AND! we saw a preview for the next matrix, which made me so happy almost peed my pants, not really, but it looks amazing. after the movie we went and chilled with a whole bunch of other people who were there, some of which were pretty fucked up. but it amussed me how much these two gils were hitting on ian. "you have nice teeth!"

oh man, i am so tired! and i have to be up so early tomorrow to work! BAH!

      BLAH! just thought i would get that out of my system.
english tutor, always fun. watched Freida, which was very good, especially since i already knew everything about her life since i have learned about her since 7th grade. went over to blockbuster and returned one movie and got the next sex in the city, which i will have to watch without staci since she left today for 3 WEEKS! i miss her already. i read for a while at the south lakes lake, until some people came and sat behind me and started talking real loud. then patty-cake called me and i picked him up and we watched momento, which was really good just a little confuesing, but all movies patrick owns are confuesing. then we went over to jons and hung around there for a whil, playing with his sound system and just talking, then i got a craving for some ice cream. we desided on malwakee custard, which is the best stuff. jon said he knew how to get there from his house, and i trusted him and his little way until he didn't know where we were and almost went to dulles airport! i saved us and got us there only to find out that it closed at 10, so off to 7-11, where we got some food and ate in the back on my car yet again looking like druggies who got the munchies late at night. oh well. took the both of them and now here i st, wishing i had the new skippy in a squeeze tube!
best part of the night....
me::singing french song::"ala-wetta jutah ala-wetta..."
jon: "...you know what that song is about?"
me:"no...?"
jon:"a russian whore"

      slept till 1 today, quite nice, felt good. did everything i had on my 'to do list' (yes i actually made a list) except read. oh well i'll put it off for yet another day. saw charles angels with staci and ian. it pretty much sucked compared to the first one, too much unbelievalbe stuff and too much slow motion effects. and a lot more booty. although i must say the dude with the mohawk and the surfer guy had it going on. and what was the kid from Holes doing in it?!? anyway, afterwards we hung around TC with patrick and jon. some man staired at patrick a lot...and we watched a kid get his groove thing on in the middle of the dance floor. tomorrow i work all day and staci leaves for 3 weeks. =(

      spent the day with shaundra, just talking and hanging out. it was quite nice. later i roamed around with ian. went to the bookstore, stalked staci while trying to be 'stelth' and then chocolate milkshakes!

__________from yesterday night while blogger was down....wrote in wordperfect and posting it now________________
Tonight I realized how much music really does set the mood, and I know myself along with many others tend to listen to music to fit their present mood. Well right now I am burning a candle and sitting in my dark room and have just the perfect music to go along with it, the wallflowers. 
Today was a blast, staci slept over and we just stayed up late talking online to people. slept in late and then went to the pool and just hung out. Until we got MORE sex in the city and watch 6 episodes...yes we are obsessed. That show is so awesome though. It makes me feel so many different things, it just connects with me on some level. Makes me feel good about life for the most part and just wish ever more that I had a narrator for my life, someone to say whats going on and my thoughts....that would be a little weird though I guess....someone following you around watching you and talking in a low voice about what is going on....oh well. Took staci home and the mad dash began...had to trim some pots, take a shower, pick up staci, drop off pots to be fired, meet peter and the rest of the gang at restaurant in herndon....needless to say we were a little late getting to the restaurant. But it was all good, sat is a crazy booth where the window hurt my eyes. Had some bad cake and then went home. Now just sitting here pondering. Feeling yet again a little empty inside. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just had an amazing conversation with shaundra. One unlike I have ever had before with anyone, just so personalized. It was amazing and really felt good to get so much off my mind. It is hard to find someone who will listen long enough for me to get my own thought coherent enough for words.  shanasavestheday: yeah i know what you mean. Those few words although simple, ment so much.

      oh goodness i LOVE SUMMER!
went to target with staci and tried on some granny-panties bathingsuit bottums, until i found one that didn't come above my bellybottun. then we got ian and went to natalyas and watched donie darko and played DDR. well i completly dominated the game so i desided to sit a few rounds out and watch them try their best to out do me...didn't happen, but they still have time to learn my skills. we took staci home then off to chipotle, the buritto place that i hooked ian on a few days ago. after eating dinner (i ate a whole one today and it didn't even make me want to throw-up from being so full!) we went over to his house were we just chilled. he showed me how he morffed people together on his computer, a little creepy but kinda cool too. we talked, he showed me his mint tin collection, took a picture out of my back pocket forcing him to touch my butt, he let me wear a tie and almost chilled me by pulling it, he gave me a great big purple candle in return for his mini diaphram, we rapped ourself in a giant roll of plastic rap (which was so awesome, one of the funniest thing ever, so much lauging.) even though we didn't do much, there was still no other place i rather be then right there with him. 
i got home and went to my sanctuary to throw some pots for my brothers wedding, got four done while watching jay leno. where cameran diez was about to fall out of her top and a british comic made me laugh...."if we'er all goods children,...whats so specail about jesus?" aahh, ::sigh:: jesus is a petifile!

went to mike's b-day party, fun times there getting to see maryland people.
then to staci's to watch first episode of sex in the city which left us wanting more, so over to blockbuster we went and rented the first DVD of the 4th season. also in to safeway, not sure if it was really open or not....listened to god song on the overhead, a little creepy...he is watching you! then saranading staci while she paid for goldfish. "your the meaning of my life, your my inspiration ::grabs flower::" so much laughing, people MUST have thought we were drunk or high, but all in good fun. i still think the two of us could fit in that mail box, now only to find a locksmith.....

      alright so miss ashley informed me chugsy is a fraud! the stuff he said was from a song! a word hole by denis leary. oh well. 
i had a kinda rough night, talked to jonathan on the phone for about two hours, which i haven't done since before international, which was over 6 months ago. it was really great, or at least some parts, others i don't feel like discussing at the moment. but mainly i was picked back up by my new friend noah who i talked to for about the same length of time. and he is just an awesome guy. also with staci's kind words my night wasn't completly shattered.

THE GYRATOR: you are so awesome u dont even understand what a sunny cololful person you are.  like and cant tell you enough how many of my days you have brightened by just being you.  so for someone to want to experience that is not crazy at all.  you just one of thoes people that makes others feel good about themselves.  you are one of the most positve and pleasent people i know
polarREL: =) i love you so much staci
polarREL: more then i could ever love any boy!
polarREL: hehe (sounds wrong, but i think you know what i mean)
THE GYRATOR: me too!
THE GYRATOR: haha i do
THE GYRATOR: but seriously, u are so awesome.  like the day you brought me that flower.  i was like yay i feel loved.  u make people feel loved
polarREL: i just want everyone to be happy
THE GYRATOR: and that is so awesome.  and hopefully you are making yourself happy in the proces
THE GYRATOR: i love you ariel mira zimman, all of you

ROXY142244: let me count the ways

wellroundedwolf: i had to make some kind of art to represent a story i wrote
wellroundedwolf: so i made a diarama only using things found in the kithen
wellroundedwolf: charectors=spoons, bed=cereal box, etc


or what truely made my day...
1) megan running up the hallway steps to squeeze tally's sides, then falling flat on her face. ohh goodness, funniest thing of my life
2) me having the PERFECT LINE to a rude comment made by mrs.stowe.....
me:are we going to see our grades today?
her:no, tomorrow. why? are you worried?
me: not really, should i be?
her: you should alwasy be worried...
me, without a moments hesitation: no, i disagree. i think worring is a lot like a rocking chair, it gives you something to do, but never gets you anywhere! ::walks away. looks back and sees human tub of lard, smiling in and laughing, not completly understanding what just happend::
gotta love using quotes from movies to make your teachers feel stupid!

      most politcally incorrect thing ever from complete stranger/my new friend 'chugsy'......
Lashmar123: you know what I'm going do? I'm gonna get myself a 1967 Cadillac Eldorado convertable - hot pink with whaleskin hubcaps and all-leather interior and big brown baby seal eyes for the headlights. I'm gonna drive around in that baby at 115mph, getting one mile per gallon, sucking down Quarter Pounder cheeseburgers from McDonald's in the old-fashioned nonbiodegradable containers. When I'm done suckin' down those greaseball burgers, I'm gonna toss the Styrofoam container right out the side and there ain't a goddamned thing anybody can do about it. You know why? Because we got the bombs, that's why. Two words nuclear fuckin weapons, okay? Russia, Czechslovakia, Romania - they can have all the democracy they want, have a big democracy cakewalk walk through the middle of Tianamen Square and it won't make a lick of difference because we've got the bombs, okay?!

The purpose of life is just to live it as best as you can.' i think it sounds alright...

      today was fine, pottery was cool, made a huge bowl. but for some reason i feel alone, yet again. like i don't have any friends....i know it is crazy, but for some reason i just feel that way. i know that there are people out there who love me and i love them equally as much, but when it comes to just hanging out with people, it seems i have no one sometimes. =/
i'm not saying i need/want any more friends, just that i feel detatched from the ones i have already...? i dunno...maybe i should just stop writing now before i offend people...

      i worked in my synagogues kitchen, then came home slept and off to CVS, where i got to hang up sale signs! wahoo! I actually don't mind working there. Although the lady, Maggie, who was my manager is leaving to have a baby, and i really got along with her, we would just have cool conversations and she would always help me out, but now she is gone. This kid i work with, sean, who is in the 11th grade (who i had never seen at school before in my entire life, i see all the time now) but he is a big druggie and always out of it. the other night he asked me what my name was.....i have been there for almost 3 weeks now and i wear a name tag....oh! I got my first pay check from there, i was so proud of myself, i was like wow....money! Anyway, when i got home i was so wired so i went into the basement and threw a few things on my wheel. Sunday slept late then went to DSW shoe place where i was suppose to look for dyeable shoes for the wedding. I didn't like the few that they had and they were all really expensive. My mom got a pair which i really dislike and i think they make her feet look like barbie feet. I dunno why but it really pissed me off how much everything in there cost. When i got home i worked on my RGB essay and application, which Steven and Hillary convinced me to apply for on Saturday. After jew school where we practiced our confirmation speech thing, we had USY chapter board elections. I WON MEM/KAD!! Yes i did run unopposed, but it still is cool! Hillary is president again and i think out board kinda really sucks, i doubt we will get much done, but hopefully i will be wrong about that.

      my big brother adam got married! so weird, and yet at the same time, so very normal. i had a great time in cali and of course the whole trip just flew bye. the wedding was wonderful, everything went pretty smoothly. the best part of the whole night was when i danced with adam, to swing music. he and kate took lessions a while ago, and all i knew how to do was the 7th grade version of the jitterbug. but with adam it was all so easy, we had the whole dance floor to our selves and it felt like everyone there was watching us, and for the first time i think ever in my life, i was happy to have people watching me. i felt so wonderful dancing with him, it was just a perfect moment in time that i hope to keep with me forever. and as adam said to me "doesn't matter how bad you are at something, as long as you smile while doing it." and thats why i love him so much, in a nutshell. ("help, i'm in a nut shell!"- watched austin powers 1 with my cousin this week, hadn't seen it in all too long) all my pots that i made for the wedding turned out nicely and everyone was happy to take one home with them. 

we drove up to lake tahoe for a day. it was a beautiful drive, but would have been better if i wasn't squished in the back of a black leather interior car with my mom and bubi for 3 hours. i wanted to go jetsking, but ethan didn't want to, so we didn't, which sucks b/c that is deffenetly one of the things on my 'things to do before i turn 21 list' so pooh on ethan for being a wuss. but i think i got some really good pictures of the mountains and lake. (lake tahoe has enough water in it to supply the whole US for up to 5 years-little tid-bit about the lake that is quite large)

i had a pretty crappy flight home, it was a redeye so it is known that you are ment to be quite so people can sleep....so why was there a baby on the flight? i honestly didn't know a baby could cry that long with out passing out or something, luckfuelly, my cd player can get pretty loud. so now i am home, and it is 7 in the morning here and about 4 in the morning in cali. and i am not tired at all, but i know i will be later. 
one thing i am not looking forward to...seeing when i have to work this week. i just know since i was gone for a whole week they are going to be giving me a crappy schedual for the next few weeks. like 8 hour days and ony one day off, if any, a week. pooh on them! and god bless encampment!

and a happy late birthday to miss ashely who is now 16 years old as of july 25th. and happy 16th brithday to marc today. 
hope you guys got my cards. 

and then theres me...who turns 17 in less then a month! so creepy!

      i walked into CVS today and almost had a melt down. to my dismay the seasonal section which had been, for the past few weeks, summer goodies; suntan lotion, beach toys, ratfts, flip-flops, ect. was converted to back-to-school items. it's july, and already school items are being sold...whats up with that? all the left over summer stuff was spread throughout the store, tucked away with everyday items. just as soon summer will be over and all summer memories and stuff will be put to the back of our minds and deep into our closets. 

there is a new girl at work. she is 18 and seems a little, well....not to bright to sum it up. but today was just her first day and i am sure she was nervous. 

looked at cars today, might be getting my newly used car soon.

i miss everyone, especially ian, who i haven't even talked to in at least 2 weeks. staci will be home for a day tomorrow. and i dunno when i will get to see miss ashley. 

i got some jawsome pictures back, go look at them!  urlLink here

      i like the way it feels when the sun beats donw on my skin and i can almost feel each ray being absorbed by my skin. how it warms my body, in a way unlike any other lite. 

i realized the other day that  i want to see something pretty everyday . it sounds like a hard task, but i think if i keep it on my mind it is possible to see the beauty in places i wouldn't expect it. like the other day i went to this womans garden (she lives in herndon and has sold flowers from her garden for over 20 years) and i thought the flowers were amazing, but even more beautiful the woman who made it all possible. she was a little old lady with a southern accent and a straw hat, oh so happy that i came to take pictures of her flowers.

      yay! today was so happy. after my brobros left i went out with kirby on a quest for pretty things. i was inspired by an amazing quote that i was given to think about by my art teacher:
 THERE IS A VITALITY.
A LIFE FORCE.
AN ENERGY.
A QUICKENING THAT IS 
TRANSLATED THROUGH
YOU INTO ACTION.
AND BECAUSE THERE
IS ONLY ONE OF YOU IN 
ALL OF TIME. THIS EXPRESSION
IS UNIQUE. AND IF YOU 
BLOCK IT, IT WILL NEVER
EXIST THROUGH ANY
OTHER MEDIUM AND WILL
BE LOST.

we went all around taking pictures of the sky and clouds, trees and flowers and anything else that was particularly interesting. some man pulled off the the road to ask if he could buy my car which was a first...we are talking about MY CAR!
we got some dinner and ate ontop of a parking garage. got some starbucks where there are dircetions on how to wash your hands in the bathroom, we got drinks and on the way out some dude was like 'nice hair'....my hair was up in a ponytail...mehh. we watched an awesome sunset on the top of a parking garage, almost to the very end when we were asked to leave b/c it was private property,,,my ass. it was absolutely beautiful. we talked about how amazing the world we live in is. and just that fact the there is only one sun. 
it was a superwonderful day!

      yesterday i went out with kirby, patrick and jon to get custard, then 7-11. it was fun wasting away the afternoon with them in the back of my van, just hanging out.
then i had to go home and get ready to go out to eat with my family. {my two older brothers came home for adam's batclor party that his friends here are throwing him, and my parents 30th wedding annerversry is in a few weeks so we went out to dinner} to this little french place that was very nice and very expensive. it was a nice little dinner, actually there was nothing little about it at all, there were 5 courses and i am sure the bill was more money then i would earn in a year. but it was all very nice.
today i do nothing...i work from 5-10...too lazy to do anything before that.

      he hung up on me again. i wrote him a letter and brought it to his house, now all he needs to do is read it, not sure if that will even happen. 
i don't feel like dong anything. i don't want to watch TV, i don't want to read or eat, i don't want to go out or stay in, all i want to do is to know if he is ok. 
my hands were shaking and still are when i brouhgt him that letter, i want to know if he has anything to say, but i don't know how he is going to react. 

gosh, what the fudge!?! i just want him to be happy, but what if he is happy without me??...can i be happy without him?...answer... NO.

      what do you want to be known as? i'm talking about what parts of you do you want your personalitly and aperance to effect people enough to call you by it. like today i was reffered to as 'the curly haired girl who is always laughing' and the more i thought about it the happier it made me. it made me happy that those to atrabutes stand out enough for someone to call me by them. as opposed to say "that annoying fat girl who never smiles". i am glad that is the impression i leave on people, and if that is all they remember about me, that is fine with me.

today i worked from 12-7. i set up a whole diplay by myself and it only took me a good 3 hours, i was so proud of myself and the part that sucks is i know it is never going to look that nice again. 
after work i got patrick and we got chinese, which i had been craving since the nght before. thwen back to my house, we started to watch gladiator, but i couldn't focuss on it so we switched to something a little lighter, the bird cage. oh so funny. 
we watched the lightening and after he left it started to really poor. the sky lit up so much and i watched out my window. the sky reminded me of a dieing lightbulb, one that flashes on and off. very cool.

      lots of things make me happy, and lots of things in enthrall me for long periods of time, lots of things make me want to live life to the fullest, and lots of things make me just smile with delight, well one of the things that make me do all of the above is  urlLink this site . it is lovely and i get jealous that i didn't think of it first, thats how amazing it is. ashley and christa have loved this site forever, and i look at it every once in a while, but tonight i REALLY looked at it and read things, and they just hit so close to home. the way she uses words, it is truely an art.

i always meet the right boy at the wrong time. 

by the time i meet Him, he knows so much about the world and love and life, and he's found The One with whom he wants to spend the rest of his days and nights. 

and i am just This Girl. this sweet, intelligent, passionate girl who deserves more. more than he can offer me. 

More, they always say it like everyone knows what it is, like it's this object i can grab hold of anytime i pleased. 


i love it so much!

      aahh, so refreshing, kinda like a shower but without so much water...i talked to ashley on the phone for well over 2 hours, about the usual random stuff, boys, friends, stupid people, a small spider they she dubbed "Larry" whom she is affraid of and much more; and when our phones both died we continued online for a while past 3 in the morning. it's just the best talking with her. i love listening to what she has to say, so possitive and refreshing, a different view. and ohh goodness is she funny, even when she isn't trying to be, and sometimes when she is trying to be i don't get it and feel slow so i laugh anyway 
'snuffleupiguess and a hoggie...something about a pine tree...umm yeah..." ....shhh don't tell.

from ashey's blog...yay! stayed up on the phone with ariel till all hours of the night being hooligans talking about kids today and what's with their rock and roll music and how crazy is it that we have the same brain.
i love my friend.

from convo online...

Punkyelhsa : haha i make so many racial slurs it's not funny. except when it is. which is most of the time.

Punkyelhsa: haha exactly
Punkyelhsa: and how power rangers was racist
Punkyelhsa: yellow ranger was asian....ahem.

polarREL: i think the black ranger was black too
Punkyelhsa: and the black ranger was african-american.
Punkyelhsa: haha
Punkyelhsa: i so beat you.
polarREL: i desided that it is more politcally correct to say black person, cause honestly how many black americans have ever been to africa?
polarREL: not many!
Punkyelhsa: haha i just always said black...
Punkyelhsa: haha
Punkyelhsa: and how many of us have actually been to caucasia?
polarREL: i sure haven't

polarREL: he was mad that gay people stole the rainbow
Punkyelhsa: i am too!
Punkyelhsa: that's like my favorite thing ever!
polarREL: i know, why does it have to be 'gay' to draw a rainbow
polarREL: i don't get it
Punkyelhsa: and everyone thinks i'm gay just because i have a shirt that says "i'm not gay but my girlfriend is" and it has a rainbow that says gay pride on the back

Punkyelhsa: i think i just drowned in my own spit.
polarREL: mmhhh saliva
polarREL: sometime i think i forget to swallow, so i just get a build up of saliva in my mouth sometimes causeing me to drool
Punkyelhsa: hahahahaha oh good
polarREL: i am thinking of getting a little man to follow me around and remind me to swallow everyonce and again.....or i could just get a bib
Punkyelhsa: i didn't even crack a smile when i read that. but i thought it was soo funny.
Punkyelhsa: i vote for bib
polarREL: i wasn't even joking about the first part...thats the sad thing
Punkyelhsa: haha

Punkyelhsa: my eyeballs hurt

       It's no wonder the breast is the target point for all men. And men are grotesque. I'm not talking about the little habits we have, like cleaning our ears with our car keys. We're grotesque to the core. Look at the penis. It looks like God took the extra skin from the elbow and slapped it in our groin. The penis is the first to shrivel when it's cold. It's the first to shrink in fear. The penis is a coward. It's a cowardly flap of leftover elbow flesh. -Matt from 100 Girls

      last night i watched gangs of new york with patrick and jonny, it was a good 3 and a half hour long movie. afterwards we played foosball, patrick and i against jon...we won, but only b/c we started off with 5 points...we slahs i was really horable at that game. we watched some spanish music videos and chilled and then i took patrick home. 
today is the first day i haven't had to work in about two weeks, and man oh man it feels good. i slept until 12 and just took my good old time getting out of bed. went to target with mommy and ethan who bought me a DVD player for my room, as my early birthday present! and then got some lunch. perfect timeing when i got home staci called, who i miss so much, we talked for about an hour. gosh i need her! my mom asked me today if she was /is truely my best friend. and ya know what, I CAN'T ANSWER THAT! why can't i have more then one best friend!?! but yes, she truely is one of the dearest friends i have, no question. but she is having a good time and sounds like she is meeting a bunch of new people and just having a dandy old time. 
then i went over to megan and just chilled wither for a while before she had to go to lifegaurding stuff. then as i was pulling out of her driveway i say shaundra and went over to her house for a quick second to pick up my yearbook. 
sometime soo i think i have to go and get my bridesmaids dress altered...(the hideous 'sea-foam' green abomanation...with matching shoes!) fun times right there, but the wedding is coming up and i get to go to cali for a week!

      i hate this new blog with a passion.


one thing that did bering a smile to my face today at work...this old lady came in, she could hardly stand up straight, and she was wearing this little denim hat and all this costume jewlery; rings and braclets mostly, things you would see people my age wearing. and as she put each thing up on the counter she told me how much it was going to be, and following the price she would say "right dear?" you would think it would get annoying, but it didn't just the way she did it was great, it just made me smile a lot.

      i am so tired, i have been tired for the past 3 days.
monday i worked from 10-5, then went with ian to the mall to show off his new do. very nice little mohawk action he has going on, very hot. 
tuesday worked from 10-5 again, then after work went to see the italian job with clare. good movie, except we got placed in one of those rinky-dink movie theaters since the movie has been out for a while. 
wednesday worked from 11-7 then went to pottery for an hour.
and today was the day from hell, worked 10-6 (8 fricken hours!). this morning i started out unpacking boxes of shapmoo. now the boxes they come in are in no particular order (different bands and things in each box, real pain in the arss) and the boxes are kinda like crates with lids, and have slits at the bottum and are ment to be stackable. so, i open the one on top and notice there is an open shapmoo, not the first time this has happen, so i wipe everything up and move on to the next box to find that that shampoo had dripped to that one as well. turned out that it dripped through 6 boxes, meaning i had to clean off each and every thing in each of those 6 boxes, but hey I did get the added pluse of smelling like shampoo.
arrgg, i have got to figure out what i am doing tomorrow for the 4th, that is after i work from 9-2! i hate this whole work thing, it blows major chunks. 

i miss staci, everyday after work i feel the need to see or talk to someone, cause i can't stand not getting to see my friends almost everyday. and normaly i would just go over to staci's, walk and say hey, im here and end up spending the next few hours with her. but she is gone for the next 3 weeks, and everyone else is busy, or i have to call before i just pop in. i like to pop...no popage allowed with anyone else.

      dixie!!! chh chh....NNNNOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!! 
oh wow, encampment was a blast, i won't lie though, it wasn't as good as last year, but it was still great to see eveyone and just get away. it went by like woah and i want to go back. so much happens in such a short amount of time. 
most of the week was spent laying on the grass stairing at the blank blue sky, rolling down the hill, taking regional pictures, talking about sex, making a fool of myself, doing stand-up comedy in the shower, watching stupid boys play 'nut ball', talking with friends and just having fun.  lots of inside jokes were made and moments in time which i will remember forever, such as marc jumping over yoni, and yoni telling me we should go find some bamboo.....crazy kids.  

the rest of the week at my grandma's was great. staci and i spent a lot of time with adam and kate and wetn shopping lots as well as eating a lot of good food.

      alright, so seems like i fell off the face of the world, when really, i was just being my lazy ass self and not writing. well, maybe i should give mysef more credit then that (screw you, i'm gorgues!) i have been working everyday and still tring to have a social life, and always coming home very late and very tired. but for the next three weels i am on break, from everything. took off from work, and now they hate me, oh well. but i am now in Mass. with staci visiting my grandma, who lives a hop-skip-and a jump away from an awesome beach, although sometimes it smells like farts....but hey, its better then a pool. we just got here today and are leaving monday, then i go to a week of jews, at encampment, which i am hoping will be a blast. 

best line of the day by my grandpa while at dinner, with staci, myself and one of my cousins...
waitress:how'd you end up with three beautiful ladies?!
grandpa: i'm rich.
it was classic. and quite amussing at the time.

      fun times with staci, ian and kirby. costco, chipotel, outside chipotel, stacis neighborhood doing donuts in car, my house, 7-11. so fun. now on suger high from coke and sobe slurpee. we are getting to be very chummy with the 7-11 dude. he is a nice guy, very pateint while we pay in change. tonight i paide with a golftoken, insted of a quarter..shhh...he didn't notice. good times, i don't think there is such a thing as not having a good time with them. 
i mean theres staci who cracks me up for hours on end with her hand motions, facail expressions and just wonderful self. i could spend my whole life with her and never get bored slash i don't know what i would do without her. 
mr.ian who is so wonderfully sweet (unless we are playing cards and he slaps my hand really hard) and his superb dancing and singing skills. oh so white. 
kirby, heh, i just kinda giggle when i think of her, in a good way. her laugh rocks my world and oh so glad i have gotten to know her better the last few weeks. 

oh goodness, the new age of romance....
Saber50000: it sucks sooo much when youre hitting on girls when you're me....cause i really can't tell the difference between stalker/creepy and romantic...
Saber50000: cause i think stalkers are one of the most romantic things ever
polarREL: hahahaha
polarREL: ::sigh:: there is no romance like the romance of a stalkers voice from behind a bush
Saber50000: seriously!!
polarREL: lol, yeah. why have a romeo when you can have a rapest
Saber50000: lol!
Saber50000: no no...but romeo! he was a stalker!
polarREL: yeah really
Saber50000: hiding outside her window and stuff!
polarREL: yeah,really
polarREL: pff, everyone messes that story up and tries to make his stalker actions to be romantic
Saber50000: lol
polarREL: oh well, what can you do
Saber50000: god damn me....loving stlkaers..
polarREL: are you creeped out by girl stalkers? if you have ever had one that is
Saber50000: i haven't....if i did i'd probalby fall in love....stlakers are so cool!
polarREL: haha, i had one! i wanted him to drop dead
Saber50000: fun...
polarREL: we were friends, all of a sudden he was in love with me, and writing me poems and GAH! every 10 secdonds was like, what are you doing? who are you with? wanna hang out? he was so creepy
polarREL: thank god he went away for college
Saber50000: yay! so cute!
polarREL: so that wasn't a good stalker experiance
polarREL: i have stalked people, never in as a romantic gesture though
Saber50000: how so?
polarREL: example one....
polarREL: in target with staci, i think i see this guy who was in our 6th grade class, but i couldn't tell. so we we ducking around the stuff to see if it was him. we followed him for about 15 minutes, then lost him. 
Saber50000: that's always fun...
polarREL: yeah
polarREL: i have done a few of those
Saber50000: fun fun fun..
polarREL: fun stuff
polarREL: I KNOW!
polarREL: OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you know how i just told you about the stalker boy i had who went off to college..he just IMed me on a different s/n...and being me i was talking to him for like 20 minutes before i asked who it was. GAH!
Saber50000: lol!
polarREL: ick, get the stalkerness off!
polarREL: alright, well have a good time plotting(or 'planning' if you will) your next stalker-esque romantic move on some lucky lady
Saber50000: later

      i love green days and substitute teachers in physics! going to ruby tuesdays with shaundra and just talking for 2 hours. 
i dislike my mom being way over protective and not wanting me to go hang out for an hour with some friends at ledos simply b/c "it's a school night." fcuk that, i never go out on school nights, this is one time and it's not like i am planning to do something 'bad'. just chill with a few people, enjoy one anothers company.

      polarREL: can i ask you a semi-serious question just for general knowledge?
***: yes, shoot
polarREL: ok, if you had the choise to go back and erase stuff you have done or do it differently, do you think you would take away the first time you did drugs?
***: yes. but more importantly i would tell myself that things were not so bleak. and i would tell myself that i am okay. 
***: i would want to erase the need to do something to escape.
polarREL: but what about the wonder of what it is like?
polarREL: the curiosity
***: i mean i guess the very first time i smoked i was curious
***: but its not worth it.

::sigh:: i worry too much, it is a complex and i should have it checked out, tested i supose.

      went over to jonnys, then patrick came over and we went to chipotle to find out that they were closed today cause of bad water, so we went to pottbellys and patrick did my english work for me, GO TEAM ZIMMAGE! the perfect student! then to best buy where jon bought me a birhtday presnt..just a little late, but still awesome...braveheart! then we went back to his house and watched a documentry called "bowling for columbine" it was very good, and about guns. and the fact that the US has the most death b/c of guns. even though people in canada onw more guns then we do and only have a few death a year b/c of those guns, but the US has somewhere around 11,500 a year! craziness, the NRA is so stupid, a bunch of old white dudes thinking every black person out there is after their money and family, and that it is their right to have as many guns as they want, jackasses, why don;t you spend a little less money on fricken guns and a little more on some education! 
anyway, came home and cooled down by rereading some of 'the perks of being a wallflower' such an excellent book. then went and got alex and brought him to the lamest USY event ever. i feel bad that his first experience with USY was such a crappy one, and then i had to go cause Noah was sitting waiting for me on my front pourch, needless to say if there had been a cop on the way home from alexs i would have had a BIG fine. when i got home he was sitting on our pourch swing and then i gave him a tour of my house and we watched a little of 'a fish called wanda' and some monty python skits while eating jelly bellys. it was a quite enjoyable night, i just need to not plan so much for one time. there is just so much i want to do, and people i want to see!

      had a fun day hanging with FAT MAN, ian, natalie and kirby, until i had to go home for "family dinner" and had to take ian home. and well i guess i'm not important enough to wait an hour for, so they went over to natalies b/f's house who i don't know at all. but thats ok, i'm not bitter. not like i sat at home calling everyone i knew to see if they were busy, and then after a while went out to barns and noble by myself and talked to people who are as much of a loser as i am myself. no, that didn't happen at all....pff
so at barns and noble i talked to alex and evan for an hour, then took evan to 7-11 and then home....surprisingly it wasn't occward at all even though i  have talked to him like 5 times in my whole life and i haven't even seen him since last year in government.

      staci and i are going to market confidence pills that are falvored and only sell them to people with low self confidence so people can get layed.

this weekend was meeh, went to Zack's toga party, fun times, i was of course the only one wearing patterned sheets and felt like a dink. oh well, the story of my life.
there was a snake in my yard and now i am super paranoid that there are more all around my yard and will not walk in the grass for that reason. i would not get out of my car saturday night until i called my house from the driveway to make sure my dad had gotten rid of it. it was so grose, it was brow and looked like a pile of poop cause it was all curled up. yuck, gives me the willies just thinking about it.

oh yeah, school started, and well it feels like we never left for more then a week. nothing feels different except the fact that we are juniors. even all my classes feel kinda the same, i think it is b/c no one really changed this summer, or at least as dramatic of a change as last summer when everyone grew and such. also i think i am just used to the whole reutine of going to school and classes. 
once again i have a hard day and an easy day. so mainly a day of back-breaking by caring so many text books and then a day of relaxation in the art hall for two straight periods. i love mrs.monroe already, she is just such an awesome person. and really understands the whole 'everyones art is different and shouldn't be compared to any one elses.'

and on sunday, staci and i went to potbellys which was very yummy, then to Andrews were we just chilaxed in his room and played with his new bass, and i downloaded like 30 songs, such hits as 'it's raining men' 'YMCA' 'midnight train to georga' a few by the spice girls, ace of bass and TLC. and that is to just name a few. he got a call from mustfa who then asked if "  the dirty israeli  " was over too. made me so upset by this. i mean my friends joke about that kind of stuff all the time, but never anything as darogitory as that, and he isn't even a good enough friend to say something like that jokingly. but i am pretty positive he was completly serious. arrggh, his ignerance annoys me.

i got my parking pass today! wahoo, i love my new car so much!

      letter from the one and only Ethan Zimman to my english teacher Mrs.Alspaugh (better known as the asian she devil)....
EZgolfer84: Based on reports of my younger sister's grade on a paper in your class i have determined that you are a moron and could not teach your way out of a paper bag. I personally assisted Ariel in re-writing the paper after you ignorantly refused to read it past the first paragraph. It is very elementary to judge a work of writing on such a small fragment of the whole. I consider myself a decent writer as a English major which consistently does not get below a B in college english courses, and to hear that i contributed to a 74 is complete and utter horse shit. The whole idea about not using the verb 'to be' is ignorant. If you have a teaching degree i would suggest not only re-certification but trying to gain a decent bachelor's degree. I don't know what you consider good writing but based on reports i would guess things along the lines of fortune cookies and billboards are pulitzer prize worthy.

EZgolfer84: it's not done yet...but i doubt you'd want to hand that to her....you'd get in a lot of trouble i bet
EZgolfer84: but, after being accepted to college i think you could afford the day of detention
EZgolfer84: but make sure you have the detention on a day you have english
EZgolfer84: so, you think that's a good start?
polarREL: yes
EZgolfer84: cool, i'll keep adding when mean thoughts occur to me
polarREL: awesome
EZgolfer84: any suggestions of why she sucks donkey balls?

      this month just gets worse and worse. although i am excited about my 4 day weekend and the fact that my brother Adam will be home for the next week! 

today i went to yet another college fair, and found more of the same CRAP "you need to be able to draw and have good grades to get into our college..oh so you like pottery, thats nice, too bad we have nothing to offer you, why don't you just go curl up in a ball and die? alright, thanks for stoping at our table, move along." 
i want to go to school and study what i love, and get in b/c of my talent, not b/c of my grades. i want to go to school and just be me, and not try and draw and spend everyday comparing to myself to someone who can. i just want to go to school and learn about what interests me, and not the rest of the 'art comunity'. screw em all! 
best new word i have made up (another to add to the list) VOOT!
insidethelines15: voot voot
polarREL: voot yourself
polarREL: i am bitter at the moment
insidethelines15: don't voot me like that
insidethelines15: you can voot fall convention and just come to my house
marc isn't coming to fall convention..i miss marc and his jokes...
polarREL: shut it roberTOE!
insidethelines15: haha
polarREL: i use that joke like everyday
polarREL: not kidding at all
insidethelines15: shut up cinderblock
polarREL: and natcho-cheese

      PSATs...yeah, didn't do too well on those...
went and got brunch with ian, then went into DC to hear Ann Hamilton (an artist) speak at the Hirshorn, too bad we got there a little too late and the audotorium was full and they were not allowing any more people in, which kinda sucked, a lot. so we roamed the muesum spotting newly arrived pieces of art and taking lots of pointless pictures in the paper room. we 'met' (slash saw and heard) kids from scotland and ian got jealous that thats not where he is from. some day buddy, some day....
we walked and talked all the way to the metro station where we sat in the first car! just b/c. we played at the metro station while waiting for my mom to pick us up and discovered that matching underwear is enough to make us smile. the bridge over pass thing-a-ma-bob would be a good place to see an accident b/c we would have surround sound and full overhead view. 
a bee tried to follow us home b/c of spilled snapple and once home had some very yummy brownies. we talked and just chilaxed for a while, watched some homestar runner which is so funny, i had no idea what i was missing all this time. when that stoped working we went over to michaels art store and found out one of ians least favorite target employees works there too. we marveled at the beautiful art supplies that we can not afford, then i took him home.
it was a lovely afternoon and i can't imagine spending it with anyone else.

tonight all i did was work on this stupid english essay which i pulled out of my butt. and it's not even going to be possible for me to get a good gread b/c i didn't make the word limit of 1000 words, missed it by 76 words. bah humbug! oh well tamatoes tamatoes...hey when i say it it sounds different, but i spell them they are the same! CRAZY!

i talked to Benji for a little bit which i haven't done in all too long and realized how much i mss a lot of people from my wheels bus. i need to keep in better touch with them.

      just another way to procrastinate from writing my english essay which i don't even have a thesis statement for and is due tomorow! fun fun! the blank page is soo scary i can't even handle it, so insted i'll write about my weekend.
friday was the best b/c i spent it with two of my best friends, which i haven't done in all too long. after an "ugghh" day of school ian and i went over to price club to get my pictures developed then to dulles mall and bought some cloths, i got a new belt! then got my pictures and picked up staci. we went to chipotle, the best place on earth! then to marshalls cause ian has never been and i found that to be a problem. we roamed around for a few hours in the store trying on cloths and making fools of our selves for everyone else to see, but the laughter was too loud for us to see their glares. they left me alone in the shoe part for a little too long and i ended up getting 2 news pairs of sneekers..i admit i have an addiction, i need help! ian tried on a million hats an almost made staci and i pee our pants out of laughter as well as when he put stacis sweater on and he couldn't have looked any gayer without wearing pleather pants and a purple shirt. 
we went back to stacis and i layed on the floor in pain for a while with ian by my side to figure out how many periods i will have in my life time, the grand total was 420, minus 1. and then the whole having kids thing, if i have about 3 kids i will be pregant for over 2 years of my life...
we watched some sex in the city and made fun of one of ians admires that kept called him. rwad some cosmo allowed and learned it is incredibly sexy for a girl to show up at a her b/f's with his favorite 6-pack of beer, seeing as to how ian would know from experiance...or not at all. 
we took ian home and staci slept over so that saturday morning we could leave real early for new york city. 4 hour drive there to see marc for lunch and eat at a place called the hungry pig, then got lost for a while then saw the ansil adams exibit at the MoMA, wonderful pictures. then went home. it was a fun little trip. 
today i woke up bright and early to see mrs.zylka for PSAT tutor then have been doing everything in my power not to work on this english essay. went to starbucks, went to safeway, went to penn camera, talked online for a long time, went for a walk and took pictures, ate, now i am back here and still don't even have a thesis statement. FCUK!

      what ever happend to waiting to have sex? waiting until you are mentally, emotionaly and physically ready? until you have a conection with a person that is so strong even with out a physical relationship? do some people really think they are really ready? or are they just courious and a little too horny for their own good? is it a right of passage for some? or maybe just something check off on their list of things to do?
well good luck to you all, i hope you find happiness in your hormones.

      well the brits are gone..tear...not. laura the whora can go back to having cyber sex on her own computer and stop drooling over all my friends. alice was chill though.
homecoming was a jolly old time. staci and i went together even though she really didn't want to go at all, she went for me, awww. went to MG's house for pictures and then to outback steak house where natalie was completly high on pain killers. we had a REALLY hot waiter, his name was 'chase' he is 23 and just moved here from chicago. i invited him to go to the dance with us, too bad he thought i was joking....=P we were complete teenagers, made a mess, were loud, annoyed people around us and somehow didn't have the right amount of money. but it all worked out. i drove chris and natalie to the dance but parked on the wrong side of the school b/c chris thought there wouldn't be any parking on the student side, how wrong he was. and of course we had to walk all the way around b/c the front of the school wasn't open. oh well. at least i had my kichass kangaROOS on, so i didn't have to wory about walking in heals and killing myself, such as high natalie who chris and i had to hold up. the dance was alright, we only stayed for about an hour. megan was princess again and oh so beautiful. it was funny to see how many people had the same dresses and how many people just looked butt ugly in them. (i already know i'm going to hell, so i can talk about people as much as i want!) after about an hour we went back to MG's and stayed there for the night. 
saturday i went to dulles mall with the brits then took them to the air port to send them on their way. slept for a few hours then got chinese food with patrick and watched the end of a pretty sunset on top of TC parking garage then did a little star gazing before we went back to my house where he helped me with some PSAT crap then watched the first half of braveheart. such a good movie! 
today did crappy physics project with peter tim and staci and thats pretty much it. now i have a shit load of alspaugh work to do that i have a feeling i will never get done, but hey! what can ya do. 

from jareds song that i like a lot...
 Each star in the midnight sky
Will have its chance to shine
And like each star above my head
i swear that i'll have mine

       the other day in services we said a preyer for all those israelis who have been killed b/c of palistinian terrorism. and i was like that is SO one sided. what about all those inoccent palistinians who were killed by israelis?? they are still people, don't they deserve to be preyed for aswell? and i turned to a friend and said how this bothered me and her response was "it's their fault, isrealis wouldn't have to kill them if they didn't attack us." and my mouth just dropped at the sheer blindness in her statement and just thought about how sheltered and biast she is b/c of media and the things she has been taught. yes i think there are evil people in this world, and yes to some extent i believe the palstinians started it, but to honestly say that one persons life is more important then anothers? and that israelis should be guilt free of this b/c we are 'the good guys," not all israelis are the good guys, iff this were so then what would be the purpose of having law and rule and courts in israel? how can you put a price on a persons death, especially in inossens; no mater their faith. how can you put a price on that persons family who is left behind to morn for their brother, mother or child?

i love history class, i know i said that i was going to hate it soooo much, and that it was going to be so boring. but it is actually very interesting and all we do is watch movies and i feel smart cause i know stuff. and when i don't know it patrick does..then i say it allowed and i get extra points...sounds like a crappy deal for him, but team ZIMMAGE all works out in the end. and when i don't feel like watching the movie i can always fall asleep for a little nap and not get in trouble at all. quite a wonderful class, and i look forward to it each blue day. 
 i want an easel.  a real big kid one, like we have in the art room. i want to pretend i can draw and create paintings, but all in the comfort of my own room. today i was mighty jealous of some of the kids in my extended day art class, most of which are seniors, but can draw quite well. i have seen some of their stuff, and it is quite amazing. and it just frustrates me b/c i can so see things like that in my head, but when it could to drawing or painting it, it just doesn't work out. it truelly is a gift, but one that i wish i had. every college i look at they require some sort of drawing, a self portrait, a land scape, a object out of life ect...and i am just mortified that that will be a determaning factor of me getting into an art school. hopefully they will see my love for clay, and what my hands can create with it. 
today i had to tell my maneger that i can only work 1 night a week and one weekend night, cause my parents said so. and i thought he was going to eat me for it, but he was actually very ok with it, which was good cause i really didn't want to loose my job all together...i like my 30 bucks a week. 
tomorrow i get to develope my first role of black and white film! i am so excited, and been looking forward to it all week long. i can't wait for the magical process of it.

      i want to know what i am thinking about when i'm not consiouse of my own thought. those moments where i laps out of reality into my own little world surrounded by no more then my own thoughts. the lapses don't usually last more then a few moments, but when ever i snap out of them i feel like i just woke up and forget everything i had been dreaming of. i feel like i am missed out by not knowing my own mind and what is going on in it....maybe it's really nothing and it turely is a moment of nothingness; a complete jumble of thoughts and feeling, indeciferalbe in any way.  
i wish i could understand myself, maybe that way i could start to understand other people....

i hate being jealous, and i hate the fact that i can't control it at all. i know i am and try to avoid it, but it's always there whether i say anything or not. maybe it is just one of those inevitalbe traits that is unavoidable to any woman?...well i'll hope not; if not for myself then for others.

      i want to be loved the way i see other people loved. i want a movie romance with all the cheesie lines and actions. i want someone to come over to my house while i am out and set up a bubble bath for me. i want to reseave love letters in my locker when i am having a bad day. i want someone to bring me flowers on specail occations, or just b/c he loves me. i want some one to flirt with me endlessly. i want some one to complement me for me. someone to look into my eyes and feel something so profound that it is unexplainable. i want the ideal man who preforms the ideal actions of love and i supose it will only happen in an ideal world....aka, never going to happen to someone so un-ideal; like me.

      "I’m happy to be where I am, my body constantly in motion, my mind set to music. My life designed to share the lessons I learn and sing out of love and good times. Hopefully making the world a little bit keener to romance and friendliness. Encouraging kids of all ages to think creative and stay forever young. I think it’s working. I see thousands of smiling faces everyday. It’s like sunshine at times, so bright and energizing. People ask me where I got my tan lines. I wear a silly grin and shrug. I think it’s the combination of smiles by day and my supportive moon by night. My head is stronger than it’s ever been. My body and mind are working in perfect harmony. It’s a great time to sit down and write some new songs… tomorrow. I should sleep now.

Good night moon."

      fall convention was so much fun, i dunno why everyone was so against it. the hotel was right on the beach and we all had ocean front room. it was so beautiful. there happend to also be a ti-kwan-duw convention at the same hotel as us, so every morning we were woken up to yells from the beach of "YA!....HI_YA!....UH!...YA!" quite delightful....

now it is thanksgiving which is such a sham of a holiday, but hey, gives me a reason to sleep in and see family, then i won't complain...too much.

      i want to go out dancing, not booty dancing or tango, but dancing close to some one who i feel safe next to and have no concept of time with. i want to have that feeling that you never want that night, that moment to end. 

today i failed my math test, then went home and slept, which felt soooo good; better then the sleep i would have had in spanish. then had to bye to adam ans sit in the car with my parents and grandma for what seemed like 100 hours to drive up too see ethan for family weekend thing. we went to dinner at this place where there 'thing' were flimingos, needless to say my mom was in love. then went to ethans little concert, it was nice. and now i am hanging around with ethan in his dorm. his room mate is pretty funny, he never stops talking.

 ....then finals, something that that is possoble just as bad as the SOLs just a lot easier to study for and then end up cheating on. it's kinda sad to say, and i know i should feel bad about it, but i really don't, nor do a lot of other people. almost every single person i know in my classes, cheats. it is like a way of life, no one even gives a second thought to it. and i have thought about it before, but  the over ridding emotion of the dred of getting a bad grade wipes that guilt away.  i really don't feel bad when i cheat with a friend or two, it is actually something we have all been taught to do from an early age, i think; ya know, when a friend is in need you help them out. no one considerers cheating a bad thing, it is really helping a friend out. also  if there wasn't so much presure from parents, teachers and just society in gerneral to get good grades so you can get into good colleges, then i really don't think people would cheat as much.  i mean, i am in all the smart people clases (not bragging, just making a point) and there is just an insane amount of work. it really is too much to handle at this age. when i cheat on something i really don't think of it as being dishonest or demeaning myself at all, it is more like a 'screw you society', if that makes any sence. *sigh* the sadder part is that cheating really is everywhere, not only in schools (and the fact that i just used the word 'sadder'). and i know for a fact that my parents at my age did not have nearly as much work as i have now, and they are fine, got into good schools and yadda yadda yadda. i know i repeat myself a lot on this issue of society, but it is just one that seems to keep making me stay at home on weekends and pretending to do work.

ta-da! same feeling as before, just re-published. 

i wish there was more that i could do for you.

       C...is for CAT LIKE!  

my past two days have been quite great, and to not be totally snobish...i think i desvered them after my month of hell. 
sunday i did the tutor thing, then worked for a few hours b/c they were short people. but mainly all i did was stalk the shelves with x-mas crap. then i took a little journey to bethesda to visit noah. we chilled and watched part of HELP, the beatles movie. his mommy is a big fan too. i felt like such a big kid when i road the metro all by myself, of course i was constantly checking the map to make sure i didn't miss the stop or get on the wrong train. which i did too, just got on the wrong color one and had to go back and turn around, but it all worked out fine in the end, i got to read lots of my new, very interesting book. the best thing i saw was an old man sitting at the bus stop (while i was waiting for noah to pcik me up from the metro station) petting a blue golf ball. after i got home i went over to peters, where he was heavily sadated after his arm was broken in half, literaly, during a hocky game.  poor guy, the season is just starting. after that shindig, went over to stacis house and told her my life story while sitting outside under the stars. then we watched maid in manhatten, just cause.  i slept until 1 in the morning and then we went to the mall. more specifially H&M. we both got loads of stuff. then to target to get s slip for stacis new skirt and a quick visit with ian...
went back to stacis house and listend to outcast and jumped around her room half dressed. nothing made me smile more, well maybe the laugh staci had in target, which could be heard half way across the store.
we rented another sex in the city dvd, and watched all the episodes on it, which left us wanting boys of our own and frech fries.

      went to peters house for halloween party, got there early and helped clean! then went to ledos to pick up some pizza and this woman started petting my arm...at first i was thinking 'oh crap, am i supose to know who this is, maybe it is one of my moms friends...' so finally i said 'do i know you?' and she handed me a slip of paper, i unfolded it and it read "i am a deaf mute from mars. my sex organs are in my fingers, you are now getting laid." it was quite amussing. 
a few people came over to peters and we watched red dragon witch was good, a little creepy. 
today i had to work for 8 and a half hours, it wasn't so bad, i was visited by natalya and neil a few times as well as staci a few times. 
tomorrow i have to go to SAT tutor for an hour and a half! wahooo! slash i haven't even completed the work she gave me last weekend.

      IC 03!!!!!!
wow, so much fun, i am still in toronto, which is by the way so cool. people actually say EH? and crazy other little things like that. 
we left really early on sunday morning out of BWI and flew to buffilo and then drove to toronto. opening cerimony was alright, not as good as last year, but still, any time you have 1,200 jewish teeneagers in a room there is nothing but sheer exciment. 
i love being able to make a new best friend in a matter of minutes without even knowing their name.  and the fact that we all play 'jewish geography' how you play....
person #1: i'm from (pick any place) FL
person #2: OH MY GOSH! do you know, (spurts off any person that they once knew, parents might have known or have some sort of distant relationship to)
person #1: either "I KNOW THEM" and continue to talk to them aout that person for a monent. reaction two "THAT NAME RINGS A BELL!" continue to talk abour how you know them, and finally the not so fun players of the game "no...." 

first day (sunday) we just chilled and caught up with some old wheels buddies and met some new people.

day two (monday) we went to an old people home and danced with them! it was actually really fun. i re-met a kid i had met on wheels from busC. we (all 1200 of us) helped recond a song for a young girl who has cancer. it was actually quite catchy and has been stuck in all of our heads since then....EVERYONES TALKEN' ABOUT SILENA HAUKENS! we had some free time and i went ice skating with andrew and only fell once and got some nice big bruses on my knews! wahoo! 

day three (tuesday) we had a fun talent show with a quite amussing jewish comidian and before that we had elections.

and then day four (wednesday) we had lots of free time and a dance. i walked around their mall which is 18 miles long.

day five (thursday)had to say bye to the rest of the regions. saw saw the CN tower and the sky dome thingie and got ice cream. it snowed a little but didn't stick. we went to this pretty crappy place that was what appeared to be an old wearhouse that was now the home of sand volleyball courts. we were there for like 5 hours. WHATS A JEW TO DO ON XMAS!?! then to our host famliy homes and for once hillary & danielle and i are all in the same house! 

day six (friday) went to a pretty cool sciecne muesum and played around with lots of neato stuff. then we watched an IMAX movie which was awesome but made me really sleepy. 

ok, now i am exhsted and need tshuve hillary over so i can ge into bed and danielle will be up for at least another hour talking to her new boy toy.

       Even without the shadow that partially obscures the child's face,
 it would be difficult to read much into his full anonymous curves. 
The sun is directly overhead, 
so that the cap's brim shadows most of his face. 
Only the eyebrows,
 cheeks,
 and the nose catch the sun directly, 
making them appear touched with dead white of clowns paint.
 This, 
in turn,
 may lead us to see more sadness in the eyes than is really there, 
as though they have been baffled witnesses to some violent tableau. 
The chin is tucked downward so that the eyes must glance up to greet the camera, 
giving to the entire figure a quality of uncertainty, 
of barely contained fear,
 even the timorous lip-trembling half-smile contributes to this effect.
 But perhaps he is only uncomfortable...
...At any rate, 
he seems uncomfortable and shy, 
with feet pigeon-toed awkwardly together. 

.this made me think of you my little tugboat.

      so this week is like the movie groundhog day. i feel like each day is a never ending replay of the day before, when all i want is for it to be winter break! 
so canada..yeah...i'm going there and i have no idea what to expect about anything at convention, but i hopeing for the best and i am excited.

today i was enrico fermi for newton fest! it was fun all we did was sit around and eat cupcakes and cookies. tomorrow i have to sing this little carol that tally wrote for me, too bad i don't know the tone of "i'm dreaming of a white christmas" past the first line!

i also have 3 tests tomorrow. math, spanish, and history. all of which i don't plan on doing very well on. YAY FOR BAD GRADES! 

i really want friday. staci and i are going to continue our tradition of decoration her x-mas tree together. i think this is the best part of everyone else christmas for me. i feel as though the holiday happiness is a little bit of mine. it is just an awesome memory from year to year. where each orniment goes, the sun setting early casting a shadow in her house, her fake fireplace, and just being together. (it is just aboput the only time i don't want to rip my ears off when santa songs are being played) i know it probably dosn't mean as much to anyone else, but it does to me.  oh gosh i love staci. 
PS-the song is all wrong...yes staci's mom has got it going on, but STACI is all i want after sch o oo o ol.

"do you need a tutor? do you need to stay after more often? do you need to sit closer to the front? what do you plan on doing? you know this is the grade that is sent to colleges." AHHHHH!!!!!! i just want tp punch them! i know they care and thanks, but it is not what i need right now.

      i love snow. even if it is only 2 inches and doesn't get me out of school. this morning i woke up hating it, thinking to myself how annoying it is that dandruff from the sky can ruen my weekend plans. but the more i think about, i realize that i always complain that i just never have time. time to sit and just reflect. sit and just be. just be calm and peaceful. so today that is my goal....but honestly, if i had to do this for more then today i think i would start to pull out my hair. alone time is nice, but only in small doases...i dunno how other people can stand me, i can hardly stand myself for 24 hours. 

well last night was fun. we drove out to rockville for a concert dance thing. the drive wasn't that bad, we only had one minor mishap and that was solved with a big illegal U-turn. we got there right on time, but then left again with jacob. we went to his house in his boat of a car and hung around his house and got directions to yonis. {i love jewish moms. in the past few weeks i have been over to 4 different USYers houses, and after meeting their moms the first thing all of them have ask "you want something to eat?" then procedes to tell us how they have some great pie or cake. i dunno if this is with any mom in general, but i like it.} we went over to yoni's house and put him into shock, by showing up randomly. we got him to come with us, but not before hillary had a little fun with him while the rest of us waited. (haha, that sounds dirty than it was supose to be) we went back to the JCC and the concert was over. i spent the rest of the night there hanging out with marc, mike and a new found friend, josh. we played piong-pong and compared to 3 people who play tenis like everyday...i suck big time. but it was all in fun. i spent a lot of time thinking of weather or not a certain someone was even going to talk to me...he didn't. but i had a wonderful time despite him. when it was time they kicked up out the of JCC and we all went over to yoni's to just hang out for a little bit. then the journey home was rather simple and rather fast seeing as to how i was going 90mph....mehh, there was no one on the road. 
all in all it was a fun night and i really wish i got to see those MD people more often, but like i told marc, now that i know how to get there and how easy it really is, i will not be so hesitant to journey over the river. 

i have rekindled my love for the beatles. and they are truly wonderful. 

last night i realized why i like tall boys. i was talking with people that i was like towering over, and i just felt like my legs were entirely too long. but when i am with other tall people, especially those people who like tower over me, i feel so comfortable. as if i am the short one. i dunno maybe it is hard to explain, but i feel safer with people who are taller then me....all just stop now...

      .my faith in the human race has just about been deminished.

i know that not everyone can see my way, and it wouldn't be free choise if everyone had to think the same thing. but sometimes it just really pisses me off that people are so closed minded and take the bible or 'the word of god' so seriously. sometimes i just want to grab them and shake them until they have this thought of a devine being fall out of their mixed up head and crash to the floor where they can look at it, and realize that it is-- all horse shit. so many people waste their lives devoting themselve to something they have no proof of. i know i don't have all, or infact any of the answers to lifes little mysteries. but at least i am questioning them, not obaying as i am told, believeing things just b/c thats what a book says. it's just like reading something on the internet, how reliable is that source anyway??? the bible..ooohh, big stinken deal, i mean honestly. so maybe it is 'the word of god' but i am pretty positive that god himself did not sit down and write it, infact i am sure that it even says it was writen by man. man...gods creation....selfish, lieing, unworthy man. what i am getting at..how true can you really believe this book is? it is all a story, just like any other childs book. one with a silver linning and moral behind every story, and just a rule book for the common code of life. so why is it taken so seriously to some people? 
beileve what you want, go for it, but don't try to inflict your beliefes on me. don't try to save me, i'm not worth it anyway.



.falling, and hard.

today i had a little disscution with my art teacher, who i enjoy very much. but i just don't think today was the best day to talk, but then again, when would be the right time....she told me i am too self critical. well maybe so, but how can i not be? even when i think my work is good, there is someone out there who will be better. and those stupid people with their natural drawing ability, uugghh, i want to shoot them ans somehow steal their gift. i want to be able to sit down and draw what i see. i want to sketch a few lines and have people consider it a masterpiece. i think i would give up all if any of my other artistic abilities just to draw. draw anything, real life, my dream life and the inbetween. 
no matter what anyone tells me i will always have that once of doubt in my bones telling me that my work will never be good enough, for myself or the world.

      .personal revolation.

the other night we had some family friends over and my mom was showing off my pottery; as the motherly thing to do. and i got a great many complements which were a nice boost in slef-esteme, then i got the question of "is this what you want to do for a living?" my usual answer of "no, it;s just for fun, not money, it is more of a stress releafe then anything else." now at this point all other people have said something to the efect of 'oh, thats good, glad you have a hobby.' and they have left it at that. this woman who seems to be of the pushy yet nice type continued in a series of questions of " why don;t you do it as your career? your good at it and you enjoy it? you could make a lot of money doing this. why do you want to go to art school, if thats not even what you are going to do? you should just have it be our career since you are good at it and enjoy it so much, it makes you happy..." and so on. and i pretty much just wrote it off as complements until now, and i have started to wonder why it is i have told myself that i don't want to be an artist as a career. sure there have been many times where i have doubted myself in the feild, but pottery is my strong point as well as my favorite, why not do it for my career? sure there are a million reasons not too, but there are a million and one to. i always talk about doing what makes you happy, and the fact that you only have one life and you should do whatever it is that fills your soul with delight. well, why don;t i go on that basis? oh right, b/c i don;t want to die poor and alone in a small shack while sitting at my pottery wheel trying to finish some big order for some rich bastards.

      THE GYRATOR: jesus christos
it makes me mad that boys have such an effect on me. but i know it's not just me, it is all teenage girls out there. and i don't think it is fair that i could careless of what a boy thinks about anything, except for me. how i look. it sounds like the most shallow thing of all time. but it one of those things that no matter how much you tell your self it should not effect you, it does, a lot. 

THE GYRATOR: thats why when i get a compliament from a guy i'm happy for 5 years
THE GYRATOR: its sad but true

THE GYRATOR: boys are stupid

THE GYRATOR: i wish i were a boy so that i could tell you how beautiful i think you are and shower you with love and flowers and spoon with you lots so that you would have high self-esteem and feel pretty like you deserve

SEE! WHY CAN'T THAT BE ENOUGH?! I LOVE STACI MORE THEN ANYTHING, WHY CAN'T HER WORDS MEAN THE SAME TO ME, OR MORE, AS THEY WOULD COMING OUT OF JUST ABOUT ANYTHING WITH A PENIS!?!

      i went outside on my deck to take a picture of the snow ridden trees, and ended up staying out side for another 25 minutes. i felt like a child, kicking the snow and seeing how large of a piece of ice i could pick up without it breaking, only to through it off the side to hear the shattering sounds, such as glass makes. there was a layer of ice on top of the snow, and when you walk it, it would crack, as if breaking into a creme brule. 
it was a truely wonderful moment. the only thing that drew me inside was the fact that i had rampaged the entire deck and there was no more crispy crust to break.

today i went to my first JYPI meeting, which is mainly a jewish teen thelanthripy organization. we each give money and it is matched and then we deside who gets it. it really made me feel like a grown up getting to deside such an important dessision. but i feel bad, i want everyone to have the money who am i to say which orginization is better when all of them are devoted to helping people?

      AH HA! I recieved in the mail my FIRST OFFICAL TAX FORM! This is the biggest step towards being a man since my testicals decended...
---.....ian....that was wonderful


rube goldberg project didn't work, but at least it looked damn good! i have more english homework then time left on this planet. had a delightful afternoon with ian. we saw miniature me at priceclub...what a weird kid i was...get a brush! french fries, pizza and pictures work together nicely. and staci came into the mix a little later. we shall see if my nails grow FASTER! and i will continue to make my eye lashes uber long with the wierd white goo. ohh gosh i love staci and ian, i swear i could spend the rest of my days just sitting with them. 
although the weirdest part of my night was talking to ian about people whome i have hooked up with, he was almost offended that i don't talk to him about stuff like that...i just thought he didn;t want to hear about it...but apparently it is worse to avoid it all together. lession learned. 
tomorrow i take the SATs for the first time and even though my parents said i could take them a few times, so this is really a base score, i am kinda really scared...i just need to calm down and breath...breathings good.

::talking to co-worker about expensive new make-up line in the front of the store::
ariel:i don't get why it's so expensive...?
(pause)
random woman: (said with a quite deffinate tone in her voice) oh, i bet it;s b/c it is a swedish company. 


almost had mini break down today, then i remembered it is ok not to care sometimes. breath deep and let life go on. 

today while we were taking a physics test i had the weirdest dream. i drempt i was in physics class and peter came over and poked me right in the stomach, then i actually julted awake. but it didn't really happen, it just felt so real that i actually woke up in time to finish the test. 
well maybe you had to be there, or just be me.

      STOMP was the greatest ever. it was better then i expected. it was creative, and expressive and made me want to have a talent full of bursting energy. it also made ian, staci, kirby, natalie and i want to be in the show. the best part of the night, besideds the show it self was coming out of the metro station, when we all went hoping and bopping down the hall making our own version of a beat. that is a moment i want to store in a bottle on my dresser and whenever i feel a little glum, open it and remember how wonderful i felt in that moment with my friends, acting like a fool and not caring at all, b/c i was with them. 
got in a little trouble with my ma and pa cause i didn't call home, and well made them worry, which made me feel gulty, but hey, whatcha going to do. my punichment is having to write my summer program essay by the end of the week. hehe. gotta love them for trying.
saturday morning i left with staci and her family for Homestead. a 5 star ritzy-ditzy hotel and skiing resort to go skiing. (for the first time ever!) when we got there after the 3 hour ride we had lunch and then went snow tubing. which was like sledding with out the work. they pull you up the hill, then you slide back down, so fun. that night we had plans for dancing the night away, until we foundout that it was only for those 21 and over. pooh on only being 17! we watched american pie 3 and got all rested up for the day ahead. we had a yummy breakfast with anything you could ever ask for and then went and got skis and had a little beginners lession. surprisingly i caught on after a little while and out of any sport i have every tried to learn, this one i have to say has been the best match. after a few trial runs on the learners course i went onto the bunny slope and had a the wonderful rush of the wind in my face and the thrill of speading down a mountin. our lessions were over and staci desided to go back to the gynormouse hotel, and i kept skiing. but i wasn't alone for long. as i was getting on the lift i heard someone behind me ask to get on with me so he did and we started talking. and his name (or his middle name, which he goes by) is Banning, and he has been skiing and snowboarding for over 7 years, so he was uber good. he wanted me to go to the top with him, and i said no b/c it was about my third time going down at all, but maybe next time. so i went down, then he got on the lift with me again and i said what the heck and went to the top with him and tried my hardest to go down the blue slope...tried being the key word, after getting about half way down by falling, i took off my skis and he took them down to the bunny slopes as i took the walk of shame. it all good i laughed each time i fell, needless to say i spent a lot of time laughing. i spent the rest of the afternoon just going down the bunny slope laughing my head off having a great time. it was really a lot of fun. banning helped me out a lot and was good company. after he left i went back to the hotel and had afternoon tea! but no crumpets...but little sandwiches with out the crusts. then staci and i played two games of bowling in this palce called a 'hotel' but i tend to think of it as a whole city. then we had sherly temples and popcorn at a bar and played pool and darts.  staci owes me her first born child.  we went back to the room b/c i was pooped. got a surprise call from banning and had a few more laughs. took a minor nap then had a loverly room service dinner, then watched some TV and fell asleep. we got up the next morning and drove home. i am a little sore, but it was worth it. surprisingly my arms hurt more then my legs, i am guessing from when i was on flat ground and tried to use my polls to pull me along. meeh. i had a great time and i can't wait to go skiing again! 

natalya and i made some SPANISH chiros and chocolate sause. we hall see how senior fuck face likes those.

      today had it's ups and downs. i went to school late b/c i was almost possitive we would have at least a two hour delay, and we didn't, at all, not even any frost on the car. damned weather people getting my hopes up and my alarm clock off. in spanish we got our grades on our projects and senor fuck-face gave me a C+. which was so not what i deserved at all. and i am being completly honest about this. i did every part of the assignment and even brought in not one, but two posters, wrote a whole page with my spanish tutor and tried my best to read it allowed. he said i got the grade i did b/c of pronounceasion and grammer. too bad i am dyslexic and can hardly read allowed with out messing up in english. there is no way he can drop me down two letter grades (assuming every project starts with an A) just b/c i have no spanish accent.  it just really pissed the hell out of me, especially since others who had less then i did, got better scores then me. so i told him my grade was crap. i dunno if he will change it or not, it doesn't even really matter i supose, i am taking the class pass/ fail, but it still bugs me. i could have done a lot less work and gotten the same grade. 

but on to the happy parts of my day...stacis birthday. i brought her flowers and as soon as the bell rang i made a mad dash to my car, went over to her house, got into the garge and tied balloons to the door. i just wanted to make sure she knows how much i love her and how truely beautiful and wonderful she is.
then after an afternoon of doodling in extended day art, i came home and got to do what i have been waiting to do for a while;paint. so i did, i spent about 3 hours sitting on my floor and just painted what i felt. it was wonderful to just go with my hand and not over think the piece, and to my surprise it came out quite nicely. i made staci come over to get an honest oppinion (parents are biest b/c they gave you life) and i have a hard time desiding if i like my own work, b/c it is mine and i have staired at it since the begining. but staci said she liked it, and hopefully my teacher will too, or at least enough to think it is what i did over winter break....

      i went to the mall today to buy a few presents for the outragous amount of birthdays there are the next few months. and i was looking for a certain something, for a certain someone, and that thing could only befound in one of those hoidy-toidy yuppi stores that i so utterly dred the sight of. where a plane white t-shirt cost more then everything in my closet. but for the sake of a good gift i forced myself into the first one, abercronbie...now i have only been in this store once before, and i was pratically dragged in. but today i decided to be brave and walk in with my head high. so i did...and about the same amount of time it took me to walk in, i was out of there walking as fast as my legs could move. i felt so overwhelmingly self-consious, like everyone in there was looking at me. not to mention feeling so out of place with my dark curly hair, and far from perfect body type. it was like everyone in there got their hair professionaly done this morning, but only after they had throw-up all of their guts to be a perfect size zero, b/c god forbid you have curves. so i went in to the next one, american eagle, not much better.....was out of there in about 2 minutes flat. well to bring this dicusting story to a close, i found the gift, in neither of those places, and i feel stupid that i let those kind of people make me feel bad about myself.

      i wish i had wheels. today at lunch there was a rolly thinger which i so bravely decided to play with and have patrick pull me on until i fell off. it was fun, and i wish i had one of my own roller thingers...oh wait, a car.....meeh

long day, and internal assesment tomorrow. and for those of you who don't IB that means a 10-15 minute oral, which is worth 200 points. ALSPAUGH...DUN DUN DUHHH!

so tomorrow night i think i am going to sit home alone and sulk, sounds like a plan! go me!

      i feel funny all over. it might be from my lack of sleep, or maybe just anxiety from life. who knows, but it's not a good feeling, no matter how much i mask it over. 

i brought home the mural that i painted (on a large pieve of fabric). i brought it home just cause i wanted to see it in a different light and show the parents i guess. but i can never believe their coments, especially the good ones, they seem so forced. and maybe they are, and maybe they think thats the right thing to do. only a few times have i heard my mom say she doesn't like something i have made, and my dad is open to most everything, but some part of me wants them to fall desperatly in love with each piece i make. it is sad, but i think i need that glory from them, b/c i am missing something else. but i know it is unrealistic for them to like everything i do. and even if they said they did i wouldn't believe them. SO WHAT THE HELL DO I WANT!?....good question...i wish i knew. 

i might keep saying leave me alone, but all i really mean is hug me tighter.

      ok, so i won the boots! WAHOO for me and my first ebay purchase. but now i found these OTHER boots, and unfortuatly i think i like them more, and they are way cheaper then the ones i got. so maybe ariel will have to have two pairs of red doc marten boots, that wouldn't be so bad i supose. 
oh it's great how kirby and i sit online for long periods of time, just searching ebay for boots. we send pictures of said boot back and forth, and at times ever 'babysit' each others boots, while the other is out to eat. it is a fun and amusing little relationship we have. 

i decided today that there is absolutly no point in me being in my math class. there is no purpose for my being there. i have learned nothing and i just don't care, nor will i care. it is a waste of my life.

      did a lot of jew stuff today. had my second JYPI meeting (the young thelanthripy group i am in) and we heard from a group called Yachad, who helps renivate homes for the poor (to sum it up) and it was probably the best presentation we have gotten thus far, and my guess is that is where our money will be going. 
then i had my little rabbis rap. i found it humerous how i think i am the only jew who does not run on jew time. the class was set for 7, i show up at five till, and some how i am early. 
it was a very interesting class though. we talked about jesus and the christain faith. and i am glad my rabbi taught it in the most unbiast way i think possible, coming from someone who is a devoute jew. and we disscused this new movie which makes me kinda want to stab mel gibson and never watch brave heart again (that would be a cruel joke on myself tho). this movie {no matter how historically corect or incorrect} it is not what the world needs. there is already so much hate and anti-semitism, why increase it with this movie? though some say it is meant to tell a story, it will have the effect of more then just a story on many people. planting seeds of haterred, for something that happend thousands of years ago, which was not even recoreded until after the event! i just fear that history can repeat itself. and i know i joke with my friends about being jewish, but i fear my life as a jew sometime. which i am sure sounds irrational and stupid to some. but i think it is a completly rational fear. never under-estimate the power of stupid people in large groups, i.e. Nazis. 

then to improve the night times ten, i rushed over to watch the final episode of sex in the city. OH SO GOOD. wow! i don't think i could have planned it better myself. there is nothing else i need, or want to know (though i do wish there would be more shows) i am completly satififed with how they ended it. it is kinda sad how attached to them i have become. they are infact, JUST TV CHARACTERS! but who cares, i got into it, and it was great!  JOHN!

      i'm so damn bored i'm going blind. 
infact the opposite, i am so busy my eyes fall shut without me even noticing. i sleep in almost all of my classes. i don't even hear my alarm clock any more, making me late to school for the past week. i can't seem to get to be before 12, and it is killing me. 

i broke down today in front of my parents, and i think it scares them. they don't know what to do, and i don't know what to do either. i just can't handle all this crap. and it isn't even real life, it is high school life. it shouldn't matter so damned much. when after college is anyone going to ask me my high school GPA or SAT scores? NEVER! 
i am like a fricken walking vombee.
i hate everything right now. 
i hate school (not something new).
i hate work.
i hate waking up in the morning.
i hate art.
i hate learning.
i hate being somewhere that makes me so unhappy.

this is all so frustrating, b/c i know it will all pass. but so many other people make me feel like i am in a life or death situation. which i am so not at all, so why is there so much pressure placed on me? 'lets see how long it takes until ariel looses it and cracks open!!! YAY FOR IMPLOSION!!!!' 

i need a break from this life. i need to do what makes me happy, and not waist so much of my time doing what makes other people happy. sounds slefish, but who isn't?

      i wish i had an audotory journal of my thoughs, b/c sometimes they sound so much more poetic in my head then on this crazy machine or paper. 

today in after school art i desided to write about my painting instead of working on my painting. as some of you might know i have been experimenting with painting on preprinted fabric, mostly old sheets. it is a lot of fun and makes me feel impotant to be working on such a big piece out in the hallway. i like hearing peoples coments as they pas by, not knowing that is it my work they are either complementing or ofending. the piece that is up now i have come to like a lot. it started out with a simple mind set of just attacking the canvas, just GO! and i did, then it became a thought process, but has developed into a character of it's own. and i truely like it (for now) i might change my mind tomorrow. but right now, i like it for what it is, my own creation. it is a part of me and hopefully reflects me as i am.  it is hard for me to say, b/c i think in order to say completly truthfully, the spectator must be indifferent. such as a person who does not know me, or know what went into the piece, such as the passerbyers in the hallway. 

i want to scotch tape my face.

 ONE OF THE GREATEST JOKES EVER....

x NFGeek x: but it is funny
x NFGeek x: haha just thought id clear that up
CruzinFerrari: dumb non jews

      this made me smile. as few of you all know, two of my uncle are gay, and one of them has lived with his significant other for many years and i have come to love him as my uncle too. but tonight i recieved this eamil:
Hi all!


As you may have seen in the news today, the City and County of San Francisco decided to issue California marriage licenses to gay couples this morning.  The first couple wed was Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin, a couple of lesbian activists now in their 70s/80s who have been together 51 years.  The last couple married of the day was Ken Ruebush and Jeff Zimman.  We apologize for not inviting you to the ceremony.  We were not certain how long it might be before a court intervened, so we took the opportunity while it presented itself.  It was not what we expected we would be doing this afternoon (even as late as 2pm this afternoon).

My brother Jon (who tipped us off as to the news) and Ken’s sister Susan were witnesses.  The ceremony was performed in the Rotunda at City Hall by our friend Mark Leno who is the State Assemblyman for our district.  We are off to Chile in the morning for our honeymoon.  More when we get back.

Love,
 
Jeff (and Ken too!) 

 I LOVE IT!  i love that they are happy and living their lives, and they know there is nothing wrong with that! i respect and admire them for everything they have done and gone through.

      right now i am having one of those moments where i feel like i'm going nowhere fast. my life is going to be over if i don't "shape-up", one of those "everything sucks", a feeling of "I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!" and it is a horable tingling inside that i feel i can't share with anyone. there is no one person who knows EVERYTHING there is to know about me. sure there are those people who know most everything, but i wish there was one person who knew EVERYTHING. and i wish that person where here right now to comfort me, and hug me and just tell me everything is going to be ok. i need that false hope, of everything will be ok. who knows what is going to happen tomorrow, but it will be ok, b/c that person told me so. 
my day started off with a bang of seld-loathing when i found out my SAT scores. i really hate myself for not being smarter. i know that is no use, but it's there, that feeling. it is just so frustrateing and i feel like no one can relate. when i look at the math on that test i can hoestly not remember how to do it, even if i was taught it just 2 years ago. it is so urrgg, i hate blaming things on my "disability" but right now it is the reason. it is the reason that i am going no where and fast. i know this was just the first of many times that i will be taking the SATs, but what if i never do any better? what college will want me then?
then i went to noahs graduation. which was long, and no too boring, but still a little bit of a waste of a sunday afternoon. but i could tell he was glad i was there. but while he was minggling with all his peers i couldn't help but feel useless. i wanted him to come over grab me by the hand and drag me around to meet all of his friends instead of sitting in the corner looking very out of place. but i know how hard that would have been for him, and i didn't expcet it from him, it just would have been nice. 
i am going to miss him, a lot. not just b/c i have emotions for him, but b/c he is such a good friend. i talk to him at least once a week on the phone if not more, he is always interested in my day, in my life, in me. and if he really isn't, he is damn good at pretending. he is my vent to person. the person i turn to after all my school friends have had enough of me. and he is going away for 3 months to israel. which i feel like is worse then him just going off to college, b/c at least that will be in the states and there is a slite hope, if any of me speaking to him on a regular bassis or even seeing him. and i know he is coming back, but 3 months of not talking to someone is just a long time, especially if you talk to them everyday. it is just going to suck when i need someone else to turn to. and as far as our more then friends relationship goes, i feel like that had to end before it even really began. 
i don't know what i am going to do next year. when it is my time to graduate. besideds the fear of where i will be going, i fear not seeing people again. not my close friends, i know i will see them again. but what about those people who are strictly my 'school friends' those people whome we all have. the people who we say "we should hang out" but you never do. those people who we talk to in class and are quite friendly with, but never see outside of school. who knows when or if i will see half of them again. 
then there was the long ride home. i spent an hour and a half in traffic on 495. the trip home from noahs usually only take about 30 minutes. it was just so boring. there was nothing for me to do but listen to music. i hate being by myself. i am bad at entertaining myself and keeping my mind busy, especially in a situation like that. 
i did however spew to adam about everything in my life. i like talking to him, but tonight it didn't seem to help as much as it usually does. i dunno why, i don't want to say that we are drifty, b/c i think that would be a false assumption, but i don't feel as connected to him as i usually do. 
and i just have a lot of work to do, but i can't fucuse on anything. i need to clean so badly. i need to read house of spirit, which i haven't even started by tuesday or something, i need to work on my oral, and write a paper for english. pluse i am sure i have a thousand other things i am forgetting. and it is just all piling up and i don't know how to dig myself out of it. my walls are caving in! 

i just need a hug, i need someone to twll me it will be OK, i need someone to just sit and listen to me without expecting anything in return but my graditude, i need to feel loved right now.

      well my day went quite well. it started out with a surprise trip to the airport launching ground with peter. i love spending time with that boy. i always tell him to take me somewhere and surprise me, and he always does. so today he took me to this mucho coolios spot where the airplane fly right over your head. but it was so cold and windy out. so we went on an adventure to get some hot chocolate. i have no idea how he didn't care at all that we kept getting lost. or at least he didn't show it at all. if it were me i would have been freaking out, especially since we were in DC.  soon he took me home and i got ready for FESTIVE night! i got all dressied up and picked up ian and went to the melting pot, where it would have been a 4 hour wait, so we went off to big bowl instead, where it was only a 2 hour wait. to pass the time we went over to barns and noble, staci kirby and i sat in the sex ed. section reading random things out loud and making older men, and ian, feel uncomfortable about being in that section. then we had some dinner and listened to the tables next to us have their conversation b/c we were all lacking out own.  then back to my house for a few moments of reminising about childhood days. 
that was my day of festiveness.

      somethimes i wish i could be the girl who lets words poor from her heart onto the page in an ever so graceful manner, instead of my short choppie incomplete thoughts that mean nothing to anyone else. i wish i could be the girl in which other see a picture of and think to themselves what kind of person i am, how my mind works and whether i have a date saturday night. i wish i was that girl who everyone admires and dreams to be somewhat like, even if the only thing they want to be like is her smile. i wish that i could be that girl who can wear white without spilling on it. and mostly i wish i could be that imaginary girl who appears timid on the outside, but is ever so confident of herself and abilities on the inside.

      (in anouncer voice): NOW ENTERING THE RING!... THE ZIMMANATOR!!!! 

 I LOVE IAN. 

i spent my afternoon with none other then ian, i just wish it didn't have to end.
the 5 minutes i had in the car with him today made up for any time he ever hurt me, made me cry or otherwise did not leave me in a good mood. the ora which he has just makes me want to cry tears of happy. i love being around him, and just listening to him, and watching him. he makes me want to create, and play, and dream, and just be everything i could ever want to be. he doesn't even realize he does it. he has no idea that he means so much to me, even when i tell him.
there is no way to describe or explain our friendship, only those who truely know ian, know what it is like to be friends with him, (and if you have gotten to that point and he still doesn't think you hate him, then i congratulate you, i know it was a hard road,) only those can semi-understand our relationship. ian is just the kind of person you can't have too much of. he is ever changing and growing, always has something interesting to say, and if he is all out of words you can be comfortable with his silence, b/c that too, is glorious.  his deep brown eyes that give off a mysterious gaze until he raises just one eyebrow and you can't help but smile. his tremendous smile, which just exspells cheerfulness, you can't help but get sucked in. and that hair! that hair that i could run my finger through for hours on end (and i have) much to his delight; and if you are to take your hand away, he will be sure to place it back on his head, so that you will continue petting him. 
he is truely my girlfriend, herioc sidekick, partner in crime, mad lover and forever soul mate, and i love him for it all.

      JoePetro21: AND don't tell him WE think you're going to have sex. It will freak him out.
good advice from the all mighty ian.
unfortunatly no JEW SEX took place the other night when i slept over at noah's. 
i drove the beltway all by myself without getting lost!! YAY! 
it is weird how jews function. being at his house was like entering the twilight zone. my life at age 8 was replayed in a manner. i couldn't stop smiling b/c i just felt so comfortable with people i hardly know. it was great, i love jewish moms....my fait is sealed i supose. 
so we had a lovely birthday/graduation/shabbat dinner for noah. then we watched the first tape of 'the godfather' b/c suposedly it was a horrid thing that i had never seen it. too bad i knew what was going to happen from watching the movie 'mafia' a long time ago with staci, which a complete spoof of the godfather. meeh. then we watched forest gump, and fell asleep, until we went to bed. twas a fun night in his VERY cold house.

today i went to a craft fair with my parents, which was actually very nice. the only thing i hate is that they ask me questions, get distracted, then i never get to finish. and i don;t think it is b/c they dont care, i just think they forget. well anyway, i got a super cool mobile thinger, a photograph of stars and a real ring. by REAL ring i mean one thats not like under 20 bucks. it it silver with a garnet stone (thats the deep red stone). 
then i worked with kenny on our english oral powerpoint. it is going to be sooo horable. i am supose to talk for 7 minutes..i have like 3 things to say, and i am sure they are all wrong! this sucks! 
after that turture i went out with peter and got some soup. then we called tally and went over to her house to play 'cranium' with her and her big sister liz. it was quite fun, i had never played the game before. then petey took me home and now i am all sniffles b/c i have no more cold medicine. =(

tomorrow should be fun!....NOT! i have english tutor, then have to do and complete an entire science fair project in a few hours. then somehow take a whole roll of film. and possibly make an apperance at the USY superbowl party....

      i don't even remember today happening. 

i am really enjoying this whole go to the gym everyday after school thing i got goin on...not so much for the exersize part (that comes in handy too) but i love watching people. people watching, a trait i think i enherated from my momma. just sitting, or in the gym case, cycling and watching people. how they move, how they look and act to certain things. 

ok so the OC....the show my peers are in love with...watched it for the first time tonight....sucks to the max, never really want to see it again. i hate the way they protray jews, it is like text book jew. i dunno about other peoples families, but no one acts like that.  just thought i would get that out of all your heads. 

the six flags comercial makes me smile.

      today i felt like i was disntigrating. 
there is so much presure i put on myself to feel different than how i feel.
TO BE MORE....
~happy and joyous
~complete
~free
...all for the satisfaction of those around me.
sometimes i feel i am cast into the shadows because i'm not acting and feeling right. happy or sad enough for the people around me to embrace me in that moment.
sometimes i break. 
  i feel lonely in my own body.  

p o l a r REL: i feel...useless
CruzinFerrari: i love feeling useless
p o l a r REL: i hate it
p o l a r REL: it is a very unsettling feeling
CruzinFerrari: for me sitting back doing nothing and talking to people is great
p o l a r REL: no, i'm not talking about relaxing and just having no worries
p o l a r REL: i am talking useless. like there is no point to you. like if you weren't around no one would notice
CruzinFerrari: never have that feeling
well aren't you lucky.... 

all i want is for you to love me the way i love you. i don't understand why you can't show me one iota of love. i feel as thought i could write pages about the ways and reasons why i love you, where as i think you would have a hard time filling a post-it note with the same thing about me. sometimes a surprise slurpee and a car ride just aren't enough.
-why?
~yes or no.
-why?
~why won't you just answer the question
-ariel. these conversations are stupid.   give up.

1.) not having a math test this morning
2.)watching a movie in spanish
3.)sleeping all through history
4.)developing a whole roll of film with just my picture on it (seeing as to how i have a phobia of being in most pictures)
5.)arriving home and haveing dafidills greet me on the driver side of the car, right next to the driveway. i swear that their only purpose is to make me smile.
6.) strawberry jello
7.) CruzinFerrari: Vous êtes très beau
p o l a r REL: =/  .....?
p o l a r REL: tres in spanish is 3!
CruzinFerrari: you are beautiful
8.)an email from my knew "keyboared pal" my favorite line...i would start off all my entries with dear diary - because i think i read thats how you are suppose to start all diary entries. i didnt like using dear diary though, so i named my diary. it was called toni. short for antonett. 
9.)NOW SOFT TACOS FOR DINNER! 
how could this day possibly get any better?

      tonight while i was babysitting i had a lot of thinking time while i lay on the floor waiting for the chitlen to fall asleep. and i re-remembered something, and i realized i don't ever want to forget it....
my dad and i at services, bored out of my mind i would sway into him, and he would bump me back and it became a game, usually resulting in me about to fall over. 

might not sound that exciting, but it was just a happy memory that i stumbled upon and don't want to loose it.

      well let today go down in the history book as the first day ariel took an interest in her health and went to the gym! go me. 

i had such a good day yesterday. i smiled a lot. i like smiling, the REAL thing. where you don't think about it, it just happens, and it feels good. feels right. 
yesterday ben bought us jewish bagles in art, just b/c, and it was so yumm. 
then when i stayed after to take a math test i turned on my calculater and behold! a message from someone, i dunno who, but it said "ARIEL IS WONDERFUL". i have no clue who wrote it, or when. but it made me smile a real smile, as i sat there thinking to myself how much i love my friends and random acts of kindness. 
it gets better...i was walking out to my car and behold! another note from my beloved friends on my windsheild. just made my day complete. 
after a trip to trader joes (I'M ALLERGIC TO CRANBERRYS!!!) and some tapioca, i went to bed at 8 o'clock! i have no idea the last time i did that. but man it felt good. 
that was my smile-rific day.
and also! i didn't have to work, i don't know why, but they didn't scedual me for this week. then when i went in today to buy something i checked and found out i'm not working next week either! i think they are trying to fire me, but without telling me. which is cool, b/c i really want to quit anyway. SO HA!

      Dear Marilyn, Bob, Marc, Ethan and Ariel,

I realize our sudden decision to move to California has thrown you all for a loop.  I feel the need to explain myself to all of you because you have all called and asked Adam if this is the right thing to do, the right time to do it and whether we were really doing the right thing for us.  Adam and I have made this decision together as a couple.  We decided a long time ago that the Bay Area is where we wanted to end up and eventually raise a family.   I have always known that I needed to be back in the Bay Area and be near my family. 

The next thing that I want to bring up is the issue of my family and my relationship with them.   I know you all do not understand my relationship with my parents ,  and I don't think you ever will because none of you are only children.  I can only say that only children have quite different relationships with their parents than families with more children.   I am not saying that one is better than the other, they are just different.   I think my relationship with my parents is  even more special   because of how they managed to keep us together like a family while also getting a divorce.  They did a very special thing by separating their differences from how they were going to raise me and what was best for me.  

I know you all think that I talk to my mom too much and that maybe our relationship is too dependent.   But you just don't understand our relationship.   I don't pretend to understand the relationships you all have with each other, so I don't think you can try to guess what our relationship is like.  My mom raised me by herself.  We had a lot of alone time together.  That was and is very special for me.  We still need alone time together, just like I need alone time with my Dad.  Both of my parents had many times while I was growing up where they had me to themselves thus that is what we all crave sometimes.   It is just who we are and I am sorry that it is so hard for  you to understand .   
I hope that you will all provide us with your blessings on our new adventure in SF.  We are truly looking forward to it and hope that you will all visit. I love you all and want you to realize that I am not taking away your son or your brother, and I hope that one day I can understand the dynamics of a large family, and at the same time you can see the beauty of my family.
 
With all my love, 
Kate

 !!?!?!!!!!!???!?!??!!!!!!!!!?!?!?!?!?!!!?????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!??!!!!!?!??!?!? 

wow, flabergasted right now. i hope she realizes that this little letter of hers, has just made the situation even worse, not only for them as a couple, but also for her. it seems that all she is doing in this letter is yelling at us in a condecending way. that we will never have what she has with her family. well let me fill her in on something....she has no idea what it is like to care for a sibling. she sees this all as about her, an attack on her, we are mad at her, too bad it's not all about her! sure they are a couple, but i could care less if she wants to move, i needed to know that adam wanted to move, and thats what i had to find out. it is ridculuos for her to write this email to all of us, saying we do not understand what she has with her parents. did she stop for a second and see what we might have been feeling? that that is JUST how important adam is to us, that we care for him so much to be concerned with his well being. 
the ironic and sad part is, i had gotten to a point where i had accepted the fact they they were moving. and was no longer uppset with her or adam. so this email really just etched her name into my little black book, even more then it already was. 
and i know i'm not the only one. marc was the one who called and told me about the email, and he was equally upset. mommy was dumb-founded by it, and could not even believe she would write such a thing to us. and even staci, an only child with divorced parents thought it was stupid and poorly written english. but she even said that kate probably saw our concern as an attack on her, not carring for our family. and that this email was most likely written in haist, without thought of the repercutions that will now occure. such as me, hating her even more then i thought i did before. 
this will be an interesting passover....

      lazy weekend. 
i watched The Hours with staci today. after thinking about it, i decided that i didn't really like it. it was odd though how it was such a depressing movie, and when it was over, i was not depressed like the usual effect, rather i was mad, mad at the characters i supose. i understand and see where each of them were coming from, but it annoys me when people commit suicide, for most any reason. of course there are extenuating cercumstances, but for theirs it annoyed me.  it just bothers me, b/c suicide issuch an easy way out. an easy way out of your life, and lifes problems. of course you would have to be brave to committ the act of actually killing yourself, but at the same time it is  such a cowardly thing to do. its just one of those things that, i can't help but think, "how do people rationalize it all?" i mean of course, if you kill yourself you don't  have  to deal with it all anymore. but in the same effect, you don't  get  to deal with it all anymore. when your dead your dead. there is no hope, for things to get better, at least in life there is a possibility. isn't any life better then no life? i mean, if your already here, why not make the best of it? 
maybe thats just me. maybe thats just how i was raised to think. 
i know i don't know whats best for everybody else. 
but i still think if she had killed herself, it would have been a selfish action, i am glad she didn't. 

on a happier note we dyed kirbys hair. it turned out kinda greenish with purple stripes. i love those purple stripes. 

jeeze i need spring break.

      well la-de-da! i am just not ready for this life, and whatever it has become. 

i'm going to prom with peter, one of my very close and dearist friends. we are 6th grade sweet hearts. and i think i just might have to marry him one day. he is one of the good ones. and he fits into natalya and i's theory, b/c he wears his pants above his butt.  the theory has yet to falter. it should be fun, even though i wasn't planning on going, especially since i went last year. and i was just kinda thinking i would skip this years and just go to my senior prom. but nope, i guess i will be going 3 years in a row. well i guess i couldn't have wished for a nicer person to ask me.
speaking of prom, the boy i went with last year, drew, randomly decided to start talking to me the other day. (he hasn't since he went away to college) and i was fine with that, i got over it. but then all of a sudden BAM! here i am again...it was weird, but he appoligized and i ended up spending my work break talking to him in starbucks the other night. we just talked for half an hour while it did this weird snow/rain thing outside. it was nice to see him again, i had forgotten just how tall he is, and how even i, being 5'8" feel like a midget next to him. who knows if i will ever hear from him again, or if that was just a one time thing, either way is fine with me.

last night i saw a really good movie, which is a first for a long time. the new jim carey movie, which i can never remember the right name. but it is something like "eternal sunshine of the spotless mind" (thanks clare) and it was really great. i can't even decribe it b/c it was unlike any movie i have ever seen before. i just highly recomend it to anyone if they are interested in a thought provoking, artisticly done movie. it was nothing like i though it would be either. i went in there expecting a comedy, or at least dramatic comedy, a dramedy as sam would say. but it had very little comedy in it, but still semi-light hearted. wow, i never talk this much about movies, but i really did like this one, and i think i need to see it again. but at town center prices, i think i will wait until it comes out on tape.
after the movie we (staci, natalya, ian, mg, kirby, peter and i) had a little dinner at big bowl. i love hanging out with them. such a nice group of people, and everyone seems to get along so well.  afterwards we went into to starbucks for a quick caffine fix, but first we had to pass by all the "goths" and "punks" slash 7th graders who think it is cool to wear black tank tops when it is freezing outside, and own every piece of clothing from hot topic, and haven't finished puberty yet but have cigerettes in their mouth, that are most likely stollen from their unaware idiot parents. (ok, won't say more about that one, otherwise i might have to hit something) but while doing so i saw these two girls who are in my pottery class. and i gave them a polite smile nod, the kind you do just to be friendly, and they didn't so much as return the gesture. i wasn't looking for conversation, or even a wave, just a head nod. i know they saw me b/c we made eye contact, and well i think it was just rude. 
on a brighter note i did see an old friend at the mall yesterday. victor arrigon. we used to be pretty good friends back in the day of 6th-8th grade. then we kinda went different ways in high school, and then he changed schools and i haven't seen him since. but i saw him with his g/f in H&M yesterday, and we talked for about 30 minutes. just talked about people, and life. and it was so nice, i really enjoyed it. i like nice people. 

speaking of nice. i recieve an email from a not-so-really-stranger. a friend, of a friend who apparently reads about my life (little does she know, i have been reading about hers too for some time {I AM SUCH A WEIRDO}) and it made me smile that someone who hardley knows me, for we have just met once, took the time to write to me.  and i just wanted to say a public thank you. 
and thank you to all of the people who really do know, read about my life, and took the time to let me know. i don't think anyone of you knows just how much it meant to me to hear from you.

      i talked to adam, i cried a lot, more then i have in a long time. and the fact is that i held back a lot, b/c i know it's not worth it. nothing is going to change, he is married to her and they are moving, end of story. 

it is ironic that exactly this time last year i was in the same kinda mood...maybe its just in the air.


one of only two...

      i wonder why i am so enthralled to reading about others lives. i must have about 10 different peoples personal journals on my favorits list, some of the people i know, others i do not. which seems weird to have complete random strangers personal lives exposed to me, but i find it entertaining and sometime thought provoking. i think i go to all of them at least twice a week. i dunno why i enjoy it so much, maybe it is just something to take up my time. but it makes me wonder if there are really that many people that read about my life...how many people i know, and any i don't know. hmm, interesting thought....it doesn't really bother me that people i don't know could be reading this, so hopefully it doesn't bother others when i read theirs...

just for a piece of mind, email me (at: azimman.com) if you read this page on a semi-regular basis. just so i know. no comments are needed, just a simple, "i read about your life." 
thanks.

      oh biddles, what a weird day. 
all i can say right now is that boys suck, except when you get a call from them while they are in israel on your answering machine and you run into a chair tring to get to the message machine faster. 

i guess pacts are just made to be broken. (it was silly anyway)


i realized that i am too critical of others. and that is the reason why a lot of people fear talking to me, or telling me exactly what is going on in their lives. b/c they fear that i will look down upon them. which i think i do, subconsiously, and i guess the only way i can even try to justify it, is b/c i care about my friends, and i only want the best for them. and i just have a hard time understanding that my way is not the right way for everyone.

      i just found out that my favoritist person in the world/brother is going to be moving to CA in July. and it makes me really upset and sad. i hardly see him enough as it is now, and him moving across the country won't help. plus i thought he would at least be there while i am there this summer for my art program. i just feel like he lied to me, even though he really didn't. and he says i will probably see him more after he moves b/c of how the flights work. but i don't believe him. he isn't going to come to visit just b/c, b/c it is expensive to fly cross country, so it will only be for business, and how often will that happen. and i know he and kate won't come for the jewish holidays, b/c they have no reason to. and all other breaks they have will most likely be spent with kates insain mother who already lives in CA. 
i hate this. i hate him not being mine. i don't like sharing him with anyone. and this is hard, and i know it doesn't make sense as to why i am sitting here crying, but i love him so much. GOD! i blame kate, i do, i fully do. and i know i shouldn't. but why else would adam want to move out there. he is too nice. he is a push over, and she is tied to her mother. 
but they are happy, and i have to remind myself that. it just sucks a lot.

      wow, today was such a great day. i haven't had one of these in such a long time, i am just basking in all it's glory while i still can.
 i took the english SOLs (Standards Of Learning. the standardized test for VA) in english, and they were butt easy. i was in the stupid kid room, b/c i have an IPE, which allows me extended time on standardized test, even though the SOLs are untimed for everyone... anyway, i am there with all the kids who have learning disabilities far more survire then mine/behavior problems as well, and it just reminded me to that fact there there are people like that in the world. wow, that sounds so rude and elitist, but it's true, some of the kids in there already have their faits seeled as a burger flipper or prison convict. sure there were a few who were just a little slower then others, but i am refering to those who are just a waste of space. 
and holycow there was drama today. i love how all teenage girls say "i hate drama" yet mostly all of them are involved in it on a semi regular basis. now i'm not saying i haven't had my fair share of drama. but not like this...i'm not sure if it is my personality, or the personalities of my real good friends, but there never seems to be a problem that isn't fixalbe in a matter of minutes. i am guessing a combination of both. it is just so insain to watch, and realize how stupid it all is. the part that gets me, is that no one involved is willing to admitt or accept responsiblity for anything. now i don't know what happend in a few different events, so i'm not looking to get involved, just to clarify that one. 
anyhoodles, i FINALLY did my internal assesment oral presentaion, which is worth 200 points, and is one of those official IB thingers. I GOT A 96%! that just made my day. mrs.alspaugh really liked it a lot, and said it was very creative and interesting to listen to. ::happiness:: A 96%! AMAZING! 
although i did have a disapointing day in pottery, just didn't make anything particuarly special, so that was a bummer, some days are just like that though. i need to start throwing more on my home wheel. 
then when i got home, there to greet me at the door, were my BOOTS! oh they are glorios! i love them, more then i thought i would. they are shinny red, and just yummy. they aren't the ones i really really wanted, with the girl on the side (which no one else liked, but i loved) but they are a close second, and they will do marvoulsy until i can find the others again. 
A 96%!!!that just made my day extra wonderfuly great.

      so my brother ethan came home from college last night and brought his about 5 month g/f Jen. i don't know what they have done, nor do i really want to know. but it is amazing that the moment i set my foot into the house and saw her, my inner bitch mode went onto auto-pilot. i think it is a natural reaction to any of my brothers g/fs. i know i have done it with both of the older ones g/fs. i don't choose to be a rude ass, but it more or less just happens. it's not so much i hate the girls themselves, just the ideas of those girls and the roles they play in my brothers lives. i guess some would say it is a deffence meconizm, i don't want my brothers to get hurt and i want to protect them as their sister. which is right more or less. but i just know i don't have any control over it, even if the girl is as nice as can be, which is true most of the time. oh well, sucks to be them.

      today i saw the most wonderful thing. it was one of those moments where i was so glad to be alive. 
 i saw this man who was dark as night, walking around TC with a coke bottle on his head, perfectly balanced...just walking...it was a full leater of coke, just sitting on his head. when i saw him i smiled emencly, and couldn't stop, he saw me looking at him and smiled and waved to me, and then started to run with the coke on his head to catch a bus....
i couldn't wipe the smile off my face.
i came home and ran to my room and drew him. he is now on my wall.
doesn't sound that amazing, but it was.
b/c it was perfect.

      well today sucked. one thing went wrong after another, and i know understand why so many teenagers kill themselves...b/c even though there is always a future to look forward to, right now sucks ass. and i can honestly say, i would rather just not be alive right now.  i know it will get better, but i don't feel like waiting to see how long it takes. 
oh and i will be failing english this quarter! YAY Alspaugh!

the only things that made me smile today....my drawings in art, for once i did something fun therefor the class period was fun too. the geese that crossed the street, and how all the cars waited for them. it was really beautiful, to see all these humans in such a rush with their big environment killing machines, stop and wait for a famliy of geese (a mama and a dada and three little babies), who had no cares and in no rush to cross a 6 lane road. it made me smile and realize that life really is that simple. 

gotta love all my friends who want me to feel worse!...

"You've been a real butt munch today!" - The one and only, Clare. 
I AGREE!



alright, now that that is out of my system....
today was a quite excellent day. mostly b/c after school i went out with staci, which needless to say is always fun. we went shopping in H&M, and it was great b/c we haven't been in a while so everything was new! i got a whole outfit, which i never do (buy a whole outfit at one time) but this one was just too much fun not to. and i felt like a ballarina, so how could i not buy it?! got a new nifty belt, and so cheapo rings at H&M. 
then we came back to my house and played dress up and make-up, with some of my moms old make-up...don't even ask me why she has aqua-marnie and electic blue in the back of her closset....but we made outselves over and got all glammed out and took some silly pictures. mainly we played dress-up for 17 year olds, and i wouldn't trade it for the world. =)

      well today was good, then it kinda crumbled to the ground, like a sand castle eaten in its prime by the waves on the shore. 
chipotle with ian, MG and peter. then by cawinky-dink staci, kirby and natalie appeared. so ian and i sat in the sun for 2 hours. 
target for a few moments, then in the movies. Kill Bill 2, good, half and a hour of previews un-needed. i controlled myself and said very little to ian so he would freak out. 
price club for gas, then 7-11 and avoiding the sun like waooh. we were/are so red. lots of lotion! 
sitten in kirbys room, chillen, blasting the drakness, saying vulgar words loud enough for her parents to hear out the window on there patio. mg, and peter joind us in looking at pictures and pictionary. 
thats kinda when everything just fell apart. but thats life.....poor kids and their priceless sand castle.....

      well after my not so great day at school, when i got in trouble for copy sparknotes for my notes....aparently it is still plagerism, even though it was JUST notes. 120 points down the drain...
yet another festive day took place last night. it was natalie's "birthday." if only we had an intercom on the table.... PPPPSSSSTTTTTT!!!!! IT'S HER BIRTHDAY! -kirby tring to whisper on the waiter. 
then Kill Bill 1 at staci's. good movie, now i want to see the second one, i think i might today. if ian will go with me, he was like freaking out each time i said a word. i am sorry that it is hard for me to handl blood spurting out of people like a fountan! 

i had kickboxing this morning. and i convinced chris to come with us, so he did. what a fun class. 
now i have the whole day ahead of me, i hope its a good one, i could use it.

      peep juasted, wasn't exactly what we thought it would be, and they ended up looking and feeling kinda like styra-foam, but still a good time. i love those moments when we just sit, and talk, and just bask in the feeling of each other pressence. ian, kirby and staci, a good time is always sure to be had. 
the girl at mcdonalds had pointy boobs and staci and i wanted to buy her a bra.

      I GOT A FUCKING PARKING TICKET FOR PARKING IN MY OWN PARKING SPOT!!! how obnoxious is that!?! just b/c i did not have my permit up, they gave me a ticket! I PAID $150 FOR THAT SPOT! UGGHH....
today i had to work, for the first time in about 5 weeks. it actually went surprisingly well. i think i figured out why i used to like work, then i hated it, and now i semi-like it again. b/c of one of my manegers, Maggie. she left for 7 months after she had her baby, and now she is back. i just love working when she is there, it doesn't feel so much like WORK, but as if i am just kinda hangen out. she is just a cool lady, and makes my working environments a lot more enjoyable.

      sometimes telling the truth is the hardest thing to do, especially while dealing with emotions. but luckfully i am writing it and i don't have to hear myself say it...i just get to read over it and realize what an idiot i am for thinking it in the first place. 
 this is for one person  and they know who they are, and if your not that person, then don't concern yourself with any of this.
so here goes...
i love you more then anything. you truelly are my best friend, and i can't imagine my life without you in it. ( i start to cry just thinking about it.) and i feel like i just want to spend every minute with you, and i am scared that i am sufficating you. but i just feel like you are my other half, i'm not the real me, without you there by my side. you just understand me more then anyone, you get me, my mind and my soul. and the other day when i went a whole day without talking to you, it was the hardest thing ever. b/c all day i wanted to rush over to you and tell you little things about the most random happenings. just to not be in your presence stung, like something was missing. 
and it just hurt me when you, not so much had plans with outher people, but that fact of the plans was something that is one of those 'first time expericanse' that i would have wanted to be there with you for. and i know you get me enough to know that i'm really not into that, but at the same time, i just wanted you to ask, to....make sure. b/c really i think i would have said yes. 
i'm not mad at you for anything, just emotionaly hurt that i wasn't even in consideration. just b/c i know that i want you there for every stupid teenager thing i do, b/c it would not be the same experiance without you there. 
maybe you just need a little space from me, i dunno. but i just can't shake that horrable feeling that is left after you get the feeling your not wanted....... 

and i just feel so...left out. 


i think i cried just as much writing that as i would have telling you face to face. i hope you understand, and this doesn't fuck anything up, b/c then it would break our record of not having any 'drama.' 
              .........i charish you..............

       i don't think i smile enough.  i am a very jealous person, even if i don't always act it. i am overly sensitave and i read into everything more then should.  i thrive on hugs.  i try to act calm, but sometimes i am going wild on the inside.  i hate bees.  new notebooks make me happy. i like bright colors, especially on walls. i start a lot of books, i finish few.  i have bad handwriting.  i love a lot of people, few understand it. i care about others, sometimes too much. i don't like cheese very much. i like the way it feels when i blow bubbles with gum. i hate it when people touch my hair, or pull my curls, but  do it to other people.  i like honey in my tea.  i daydream a lot and yet think of nothing. i want to be loved. snakes scare me. i hate wearing shoes, but i own many pairs. i don't think people care about me. i don't really like the way flowers smell. sometimes i forget to brush my teeth. sometimes silence scares me. i am not poetic, but i wish i was. i like pushing buttons, it doesn't matter what they are for.  i want to be great.  i love taking showers. the beach is possibly my favorite place. i speed, but i drive safely. i have a very bad concept of time.  i procrastinate.  i wish i was beautiful. i have a rubber stamp collection. i hate math, and i suck at it. i sleep with my baby blanket, and have no intention of stopping any time soon. i have no musical talent.  i hate being left out.  i have PMS mood swings, but i don't like to admitt it. i like a lot of music, but care about few bands. i hate walking up hills, but i love rolling down them.  i don't think i will be a ble to get into college, and that scares me.  i don't do my own laundry.  i sleep with three pillows, but no sheet. i ramble a lot......

i want to be something. be a somebody. have a life that will be talked about long after i am gone. to be in a book and be studied by others. i want my life to be a story; on a test that some poor student will have to take. 
hmm, cwould it could it ever happen? doubtful, but i can dream i suppose. guess i better get started on my masterpiece of a life time that will be in all those books....heh.....

      today as i was cleaning, and avoiding reading, i remembered 8th grade, when i cleaned ashleys room for her. it just came to me and i thought of how funny it was, that i could not stand the mess of her room (it really was gross) so i took it upon myself to clean it for her. and how just a week later it looked pretty much the same. 
i miss that room. that room that we would spent hours talking in and laughing in and crying in. i just remember time after time, lieing on her bed, talking to her about life and everything imaginable in the universe, all while smashing pumpkins played in the background. i still know the hand motions to our song, and do it everytime it come on the radio. "i send my love over to you." 
ahh good time, good times.

      so tonight i decided (after i got my next sugar high) to un-pack while cleaning up my room while cleaning out my closet, which my mom has been bugging me to do for a while. so after a little depression of the fact i can't fit into certain things anymore, i stoped and realized i filled up a whole laundry basket of what i don't wear anymore. hmm, odd how some things are now too big and then there were other things that were way too tight...wonder how that works. but now i have an even bigger mess in my room then when i started, i dunno how that happend, but i don't feel like cleaning it up.

after i caught up on all my blog reading (i have a strict regiment, and i felt as if other people did not exist when their writing pages were not bookmarked, while i was in Mass.) 
{Larry King it wearing jeans with suspenders on connan o'brian.....how does that work? ohhhh old people...}
anyway, it was on two other blogs, so i thought i would join in the fun!: 
1: Grab the book nearest to you, turn to page 18, find line 4. Write down what it says:
and release.

2: Stretch your left arm out as far as you can. What do you touch first?
my phone

3: What is the last thing you watched on TV?: 
well i am watching connan o'brian right now

WITHOUT LOOKING, guess what the time is: 
1ish

5: Now look at the clock, what is the actual time?: 
1:22

6: With the exception of the computer, what can you hear?:
connan and larry king and my fan

7: When did you last step outside? what were you doing?: 
going out with staci, to see ian, marygrace, susan, natalya and neil, that was fun.

8: Before you came to this website, what did you look at?:
mike prada's website (and about 10 other personal pages, and my email)

9: What are you wearing?: 
white and red USY shirt, glasses and underwear

10: Did you dream last night? 
pretty sure, but i remember my dream in the car more, (my dad wanted me to steer the car, and i wouldn't look up)

11: When did you last laugh? 
at mary graces, at marygrace, for saying something funny during shurades

12: What is on the walls of the room you are in?
pictures, calender, beatles posters, starry night, bulleten board and mirror

and for some reason both of them went to 16 next...
16: If you became a multi-millionaire overnight, what would you buy first?: 
well first i would pay off all of my parents bills, but then i think i would just go shopping. 

17: Tell me something about you that I don't know:
i am a cumplusive scale checker and i weigh myself at least once a day. it is sad and pathetic

20: Imagine your first child is a girl, what do you call her?:
no idea, i even went to a baby nameing site to see if  could find one...i guess my baby girl will just be screwed when it comes to getting a name. 

21: Imagine your first child is a boy, what do you call him?:
shane, or maybe shay i like the name ezra too. 

well that was fun.....an hour later....its time to go to bed.

      ok, so maybe i just need to grow up. but i am still shocked when i find out that yet another one of my friends has either had  sex , or does  drugs .  i dunno, not that i think people shouldn't but it just blows me away how fast it is all happening, and i'm not even the one doing anything. but i think i am pregnant  with all the sex everyone else is having.

      i feel bad, and at the same time i am bored out of my mind. i have had to spend the past two days with my grandparents, and as much as i love them ,they just get on my nerves. my grandpa can hardly hear, and you have tro like scream to talk to him. he tells the same old stories over and over, and he telss them in a way only he can, although my father has kinda inhereted the slow lathargic speech. and my bubi (grandma) she is a funny lady, but she too, never stops talking. and sometimes says the most random things. but then i feel bad. b/c i know both of them had hard lives, being in the war and all that jazz. and they both long for people to talk to. and neither of them are going to be around that much longer, so it makes it all the harder to stay upset with them. but sometimes i just can't handle it. such as RIGHT NOW!

yesterday i visited RISD (Rhode Island School of Design), a very well known art school. its all on a hill, and right next to Brown. it was interesting to see it all. the campus seemed kinda small, but i haven't really seen any other schools to compare. i met some senior who showed me around a little bit, b/c i am sure i looked oh so lost. nice guy who was majoring in painting. anyway, it was even more fun to look at all the people there, the artsy-fartsy people. the ones who have the artsy-fartsy grungy look, that is supose to look like you don't care what you look like but really it took them just as long to get ready as anyone else. and you can deffinatly tell the difference between the Brown yuppie-yuppie, and the artsy-fartsy RISD kids. 
then i met my bubi's cousin...i dunno what that makes him to me, but he is a art professor at Brown. i showed him a part of my portfolio, just for some feed back. he didn''t have much to say about it besideds the fact that i need more drawing in it. and he went on about thats what makes a real artist, drawing, even if they do other things. and if you can't/don't draw you are not an artist, rather a "craft person." that kinda upset me, and i told him that i didn't agree, and he said he knew i didn't, but i still need to work on drawing. BAHH. i hate it so much, and it is such a sucky little cycle: i don't draw b/c i suck at it, i suck at it b/c i don't practice and i don't practice b/c i hate it and i hate it b/c i suck at it. so yeah...i'll have to "self-disaplin" myself.

      yesterday i went out shopping with grand-ma-ma, the key mission was to find a prom dress. the only thing i wanted was, RED. and i got it. RED, strapless, goes to the florr and purty. best part, i got it 50% off b/c it was "last seasons stlye." i am such a thrifty jew!  
wow my family is huge. 40 people at out first sader last night. go mom for making enough chicken soup and matza balls for all of them. and fo-chicken soup for me. 
i think if anyone form a different family were to come to our passover sader, they would be shocked into the corner. just by the amolunt of people and the overall crazyness of the whole thing, there is no way to acuratly share what goes on during the course of the night, it can only be experianced.

      well that was fun little trip. went shopping, saw my cousin, went to the Gohhenheim, saw "hairspray" (my first broadway show), ate lots of good food.  i love the city so much. just all the hussle and bussle, the gotta go gotta see feeling in the air. and the PEOPLE! so many people, a lot of hot guys too. and you can really tell how big you are. not like big fat, tall or muscular, but big, as in the stature you hold yourself to. just by walking down a crowded street. you keep walking straight, against the trafic, and see how many people move out of your way, or how many people you are forced to move around b/c they are going straight. its an interesting little experiment.  catch a falling star and put it in your pocket, never let it fade away!   YOU HAVE ACNE OF THE SOUL!   after i got home i went out with ian, for slurpess and chinese. oh, and best buy, where i took his picture on this wicked cool camera and printed it out on the mini printer. we almost bought bobbys world, but then ian realized that he didn't actually like the show.   in the summer time, is the sun closer or farther away from the earth? if you know the REAL answer, please, let me know.

       I SAW MY VERY FIRST SHOOTING STAR TONIGHT!  i was driving to the ATM all by myself at 11:30ish and i was stopped at a light, and i was looking up, and all of a sudden i see the little light in the distant sky falling. it had a little tail, and before i knew it, it was gone. so i didn't get to make a wish b/c i couldn't think of one fast enough. then i thought about it, and i still don't know what i would wish for...  what would you wish for? (feel free to respond. i am interested and need to be prepared next time i see one.)

      i made these two chairs in art class out of foam core board, and covered them both with white molding paste, to give them a look of a freshly frosted cake. they are pretty cool if i say so myself. and i don't even know how i came up with the idea of them. but i love having done something that catches peoples eye. where they stop and say, "oh...cool..." and have to rethink it. they are very much a discussion piece, seeing as to how you interpt them, they could either be whimsical, magical pieces from a cartton, of the pale chairs of pain and anguish with their sharp pointy spikes. but either way i really enjoy hearing what people think of them.  today i had a talk with a few other peers, who all though the pieces them selves were quite interesting and creative. one gave me advise on how to stop the material from worping, while another protested that it makes the piece even better then it would have been straight.  overall i think they are pieces that are just weird and push people, kinda like a swift kick in the ass.   i went to one class today, spanish to take my PALS, what a waist of time...then slept the rest of the afternoon. now mommy says i have to clean my room before i can go out tonight. and marc just called and said he got us tickets to see "Hairspray" and off-broadway musical. YAY NEW YORK CITY!

      today ian desided that everything else has a song, so, so must the overriden ciccadas of death! and here it is, composed by ian and staci, and written down with a crappy pen by myself. ENJOY!   THE SUMMER OF CICCADAS  It's the summer of ciccadas Flying all around Fallen on the ground Dead, Dead. They make a lot of noise, People play with them like toys. Don't shake the tree or you'll  run and flee. Ciccadas, ciccadas, Why won't you leave? Right Now! 17 years, 17 years, no body came, They came out of their grave. Now they be flying all around with no self control. Till their eggs fall down and climb back in the whole. (slow part) They've only got one reason to live, to give, to give, to give,  Birth to me. You cluttered up our air and bothered our silence, And now your just a stain on my windsheild.

      while reading through Werther, to find quotes for my WL paper, i realized that he is not some pathetic fool that just can't find a recprical love, he is just a Romantic. to the fullest extent. and not that i would want a guy to take his own life over me, but seeing how there is deffinetly not enough love in the world, i think it is refreshing to see that there is such a thing as true, pure love.

      from alex's xanga... seeing the slide show made me jealous. dunno seeing other people so involved and connected like that, wanted to be a part of it as if i had been in usy for as long as these people.   i am so glad he had a good time. and i don't want to go back to reality either. it will never be explainable to those who will never be able to go to a usy event. but it is like a differnt whole world, and thats the best i can do at describing it.

      spring convention was great. and of course the weekend flew by entirely too quickly. just some random moments from the weekend... ~getting hit in the face with a piece of turkey. grossest thing ever, whether i eat mean or not, it was still wrong! ~looking like a cult thursday night when we burned a cross in our camp fire ~YOU'RE LOOSING! HURRY UP!!! GO! GO! GO!! -marc and i yelling at the people doing the obstical course ~elections-congrats to hillary, danielle, zach, jacob and who ever else i am forgetting. you are all crazy for wanting the job, but i wish you all luck. and i laugh at you b/c you had to clean up all that paper! ~BLACK OUT! getting car head lights to provide light for our friday night shabbos dinner. interesting to say the least. but the shadow puppets were great.  ~dancing in the rain.  ~tendanitece in the eye. ~still can't click my heels. ~black jack...19...HIT ME...21...HIT ME.... ~funny faces ~horralbe shallow thoughts ~you have fish on your shirt! NO WAY! ~trampoline  ~massive sweatiness after capture the flag ~orange kisses ~senior girls TPing out bunk... ~jumping...then getting elbowed right in the boob and by far the best part of the whole weekend...the CAUTION SIGN! putting a random CAUTION sign in the middle of the dance floor. then breaking up people who were dacinging and putting it inbetween them. hardest i have laughed in a long time.   i was talking with staci, and she asked me what goes on at these convetnions, and why they are so fun. and i have a hard time explaining it. but it is just that feeling that most people get, when they are there, and it is amazing. first timer.. jojoba88: fuck i wish i was back at spring jojoba88i feel more familair with the people at usy then i do with all the people here

      today i think i had a panic attack...as i was talking to staci on the phone i looked out the front window and saw a LONG (had to be at least a yard), BLACK, SNAKE strolling across my driveway. my heart started to beat rapidly, and i couldn't finish my sentance to staci before the tears started to pile up in my eyes. i ran upstairs to watch it slither across my driveway and into the unknown.  now for those of you who do not know, snakes are my biggest phobia. most girls are affraid of bugs (i on the other hand held a sacada today) am petrafide of snakes, especially wild ones. when i have a nightmare, its not of people dieing, but of, or having to do with snakes.  i don't like the fact that it just went underneith a tree, b/c then i dunno where it is. i don't like the fact that it is exciting at all, b/c that means there are more somewhere.  i hate the way they move, the way they look, the way they send shutters down my entire body.  i called my dad while i was waiting for staci to come over and save me. i told him about it and he said "oh, thats just a gradener snake." "A YARD LONG ONE!" i exclaimed. i told him that he needed to come home and kill it, and he said that even if he were home he wouldn't kill it b/c it is a "good snake." i don't believe there is such a thing as a GOOD snake, they are all the spawn of satan.  so there will be no more walking in my lawn, no more timely strolls outside, no more going in my jungle of a backyard, and now i run from car to house.  laugh all you want...i just hope a big black snake shows up at your house and EATS YOU!

      i was reading one of my blogs (and by "my blogs" i mean the ones i watch over) and i realized that i don't have a crush on any one right now. and i really haven't had a REAL crush for a while. i sat here and really had to try hard and think if there was anoyone whom i like...nope, not really. which is good and bad i suppose. less time worring if someone likes me back, less time thinking about all the what-ifs, less time spent wishing things could be different. but then again, theres no thrill of thinking about and seeing that special someone, no exileration of trying to figure out what simple words REALLY mean, no gushing to friends, and no staying up late thinking about what it WOULD be like to be with that person. ::sigh:: who knows, spring convention is this weekend...anything can happen at them crazy jew conventions.

      my parents are annoying the shit out of me. i hate it when my dad yells. it pisses me off. there is no reason for it, and its as if he doesn't know hot to communicate with me. except for the only way he knows how, to yell. as if that makes me HEAR him better. when really i could give a rats ass as to what hes saying when he yells.   the sussans (out chapters USY advisors) were fired, or "not asked back" as everyone keeps saying. this really gets me considering that they were one of the reason why i love USY so much. they did wonderful things with us and for our chapter. and we (the USYers) had no say in this desission to "let them go." and its complete crap. this is supose to be OUR, the USYers chapter. we should at LEAST have a say in what goes on. too fricken bad if the adult of the youth commity dislike them, their not the ones this dessision effects. it just makes me so mad. and now they are trying to get us teens to help in the process of finding a new youth advisor. well thats nice, maybe they should have talked to us before they fired the sussans. i don't care anymore, and this whole idea of us helping is such crap. they only say they care about our oppinions. they don't. the youth committy made up of middle aged people will be picking OUR new leader, whether we say yes or no.  so thats whats bugging me.   and there goes another reason as to why i hate organized religion. thanks for helping me become even more unreligious youth commity!

      after the SAT class from hell, i took a nap, then off to Relay For Life. an anual event to help raise money for cancer. when i got there i proceded to walk for 2 hours straight, then when i stoped i so stupidly forgot to stretch, and well now i am in pain.  the night was fun, it poured so they had to get everyone inside the school for a while, as well as pick up all the luminaria, which took 10 times as long to set up. Staci, Ian, Kirby, Chris and i all ran out in the fat rain to go to Pizza Hut and get some food. we got soaked in the 20 seconds it took to go from the school to my car.  after the rain stoped we walked some more, then eventually crashed on the gym floor to be woken up at 8 to go home.  it was a good afternoon/night and i plan on being there next year.   i took the SAT practice test,...AGAIN today. that was fun, but not really, at all. i dunno how i did. whenever i say i did ok, i end up doing horrably, and whenever i say i did horably, i did do horably. so really either way i probably did not do so well. Auto response from polarREL: taking the SATs....AGAIN :-( (only 3 more times!...) midnightrider924: i feel your pain, but from a lying back enjoying my pinia coloda on a beach kind of way...i miss you and hope you have good luck   i went to a few yard sales this weekend, looking for a chair. didn't find one. =( well i did find one, and i asked "how much is this chair?" then the kid went: "thats our kitchen chair, its not for sale, we are just sitting on it." and gave me a look of 'why are you an idiot?'

      trade is the word of the day on this  urlLink amazing  website, that i am now officially obsessed with. after reading through a few other peoples, it is amusing to see how many other people use peanut butter and jelly sandwich in their response besideds myself. but i still love the deep ones, that i could never think of on my own.... [rusty] wouldn't trade anything, regret is the poison of life

      i made a chair in art today, and covered it with this modeling paste stuff, and made it all spikie and cool looking. but now i want to do it on a real chair...i tried looking on ebay, i found the perfect one for only 5 bucks, but then i found out the shipping and handleing would have been 50 bucks. so that kinda sucked. ian, staci and i went to salvation army to try and find a chair, but they only sell sets. so much for that. so i guess i will have to scott out some garage sales or something. slash if any of you people who are reading this, have a simple old wooden chair that you no longer need and feel like donating for the love of art, then please let me know. it doesn't matter what condition it is in, or the color...just a wooden chair. thanks.   QUESTION:Amelia said...  pimples do suck. there is a nice big honker of a one on my chin that i introduce to people- her name is edna... edna this is Ariel. but how do pimples and college entrance essays go together? ANSWER: they both suck.

      today in english we were talking about writing college essays for next year. and we read a few exapmles, and all i could think about was "oh crap, what the heck am i going to fill the page with?" i have no life changing experiance worth writing about, no profound passion that is any deeper then any other kid in america. so basically i'm not getting into college...as i continue to go to this forsaken SAT class.

      well today kirby, natalya and i were told not to come to math class anymore...fun.  slept all through spanish yet again, then did nothing the rest of the day. i messed up the bowl i was so excited about, just like i said i would. but i made a new one, even bigg, we'll see how that goes.  so i'm still not so sure about this new blog setup. i stayed up until 12:30 last night trying to figure out how to make my posts go in desending order. i wrote the kinda blogger people an email, hopefully they will respond to me.

      umm, ok...they completly changed the posting format without letting me know, and now i am freaking out...just when i get used to things they have to go and change it!!! i dunno if i like this new fangalled contraption! i dunno why it is putting my newest posts at the bottum, when i like them at the top, and i don't know how to change it!! HELP! SOMEONE PLEASE!!!!!!  but anyway, today i did a lot of true internet surffing, letting each website lead me to another. it is really insane just how many websites there are. i read about a lot of different peoples lives, that was fun... but i think my best find of the day was this guy... urlLink one word  very cool, i recomend everyone going and trying it out.

      today was a "well fuck" day.  mrs.Briggs is not coming back to SL next year....well fuck i got black paint on my pants...well fuck i got shampoo all over my hands at work...well fuck i have an F in english...well fuck noahs staying an extra two months in israel...well fuck i have to pay 50 bucks for a violin concert i don't really want to see...well fuck that was just a brief example of my "well fucks" today, i am sure there were many more.   today in english we were having one of those "make ya think" conversations about "the sorrows of young werther" a book of letters by a mellow-dramtic romantic fool, who kills himself b/c he can't get the girl. so we were talking about love, and its boundies, and true love, and love at first sight. and it made me think, i wonder if i really have ever been in love. i thought i was, but when i look back on it, was it infatuation, or love? or is it just the love i was capable of feeling at that time in my life? hmmhh, makes ya think.....

      i got home from spanish tutor AND SAT class, and i was in a panic about how much work i had to do. so i sat down and made a list of things i need to get done this week....turns out there were only two things on the list....i found that funny, b/c both of those things, really aren't THAT big of a deal. so that was nice.   everyone is getting all excited for prom, and it seems as though i could care less...::shrug:: i guess i just haven't thought about it. also since i went last year, i know kinda what to expect, all my fellow junior-first-timers, do not. but i am excited about my dress, i really love it. i feel the need to wear it more often b/c of how much i love it. that one or two wearings is not enough for this beautiful dress. i find myself trying it on quite often.... =)  the other day after begging me to let her do my nails : MG: HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO YOUR HAIR FOR PROM!?!?!?! Me: i dunno.... MG: well, UP OR DOWN?? Me: i dunno.... MG: HOW DO YOU NOT KNOW!?!?!? PROM IS ON FRIDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  like oh my god! gotta love those people who have a nail appointment at 1, so they are not going to go to school the whole day....

      best part of my day, recieving this text message from ian, who just got his wisdom teeth pulled out of his head....   i'm sedated, confused, swollen, and bleeding like a mo-fo. still i'm having a great day & hope you are too. i love you, so breath and be HAPPY! Peace   i love that boy, even though it took him a big dose of vicadin to tell me he loves me.    from ians xanga... Ariel came over for a little bit today to keep me company and see how i was doing. She brought me my pictures from costco. She also bought me my first balloon ever! Its a big yellow smily face that she wrote "be happy" on. THEN, for the icing on the already quadruple layer cake, she brought be TWO BAGS OF MARSHMELLOWS! On bag of small and one bag of big, because she didn't know which ones i like. Is she not the greatest?!?! It sad that she is leaving me in 2 days. I'm going to be all alone! Bah!  oh i love that boy.

      i saw the Guster, Ben Folds and this other guy, who isn't very important or any goods show last night. i went with hillary and todd, and hillarys sister and some of her friends. we sat on the lawn at wolftrap and surprisingly i did not get one bug-bite! (somebody please clap for me and my deseased skin!) we got there with pleanty of time and saw the whole show. guster was awesome, and ben folds was amazing. it surprised me, b/c really i haven't listened to ben folds since he was ben folds FIVE. but he is so talented on the piano and really puts on a good show, and he still sang a few older songs from when he was ben folds five, which i liked.  then after the concert came the journey of getting out of the parking lot, and wow, it took a good hour to do so. but it was all good b/c it was me, hillary, todd and stephanies little friend mike, who was drunk. needless to say he was hilarious and would not shut up. when we finally got back to hillarys house well all (except todd, he had a paty to go to, meehh) watched some sex in the city. it was funny to see that these now out of college 23 year old do exactly the same thing we do when they hang out, except they have easier access to alcohol.  now i have to orient myself enough to do things to get ready for going away. i leave this saturday for mass., to spend the week with family then NEXT week i go to my summer program at the muesam school. which i am a little freaked out about. i have no idea what the people are going to be like there. if they will be those super artsy-fartsy people that think their the shit b/c they where "vintage" clothing and have funky hair cuts, or if there will be a million book-wormish artist who like to sit in there room and draw still lifes all day. i am sure i will encounter both, but i am still a little freaked out.   i need to go to more concerts.

      alright, so Being John Malcovitch...yeah...WEIRD. but alright, it was a cool concept until they kept fucking over the plot, but whatcha goin to do i guess.  i went into DC all by myself today, something i have been doing more and more of lately, going places by myself. i'm not going to say that i like it, b/c honestly i can't handle so much of myself, every second i wonder what some else is doing. i am not a very good one on one with myself kinda person. i always feel like i should be thinking about my life in great depth when i am alone, but then i feel like my life has no depth, or at least enough depth to take up my entire thought process. anyway, the hirshhorn was good, but a lot of it was blocked off for renivation, which is good b/c i love seeing new things, and hopefully they will be done soon.

      tonight i set out to get some art supplies, but as i was pulling out of the driveway i noticed the sunset, and that became my new destination. i drove over to town center and went into the parking garage i hate so much (only b/c the other one was blocked off) parked on the second level and ran um the other 4 flights of stairs. i got to the top and watched as the big orange orb slowly sank into the horizon. it was perfect.  at first i wished i had someone there with me, a friend, a boy, someone to hold me and comment on just how beautiful the neon glow was, but i was standing there all by my lonesome, but then it was refreshingly nice to know that i can do this on my own. i felt sort of impowered, knowing that i don't NEED anyone to do this with, although it still would have been nice.  then just as i was leaving a young guy (about my age, maybe a few years older) with carrot top red hair pulled up behind me. and got out with barefeet, i commented to him that "he missed a good one" as i was walking away, he said something i didn't catch then "have a good night" in a very sencre and gentelmenly way. after i was wa few more paces to the steps i realized that i should have gone back and talked to him, but i was too far and it would have been weird. but none the less it made me smile. and i am actually glad i didn't go back, b/c that moment was perfect in itself, and i wouldn't have wanted it to be anyother way.

      yesterday i had an awesome time, and i had a few perfect summer moments.  i watched a total of 4 movies yesterday, when else can you do that but summer?  i stayed up until 5:50 in the morning with friends.  i did multiple differnt thing, none of which started until after noon, b/c thats how late i slept in.  i had a coke slurpee, which i think i might have an addition to as ian told me.  spent about 2 hours in best buy with ian, mg, and stephanie. and saw a refridgerator with a flat screen TV built into it, it was pretty cool. but amussing to see how overly obsessed with TV our culture is, that you need to have one BUILT IN TO THE FRIDGE! now our fat americans can just put the sofa RIGHT in front of the fridge, no long walk to get a beer anymore! SCORE! a few episodes of sponge bob, one of which anissa found absolutly histerical. and then just as my night would usually just end, i went over to hillarys. and watched 3 movies with her and todd until about 5:30 in the morning. then went to bed, only to wake up at 8 and go home, get into my own bed and sleep until 1:30.  this is why summer always feels like one big long day, b/c there are hardly any moments where you feel like it is a "new day"  maybe b/c i never wake up until noon. but i love this!

      had to work from 11-7 today. my back was killing me, so i took about 4 aleave...i don't think you are suppose to take more then 6 in a 24 hour period, and i took all four in about 3 hours....meeh, i'm still alive. after work i went out to dinner with my mammy and just talked. i love her.  then i came home and played with my cool new cell phone for a while, tring to figure out how to do anything, b/c i don't understand the manual. then Todd and his friend Mike came over and we went to the playground and just hung around on the swings. then watched some family guy. tomorrow we watch the rest of Braveheart! i dunno why, but for some reason i feel really comfortable around Todd, like i have known him for a long time, when really  haven't at all. but usually i am a lot shyer around new people and watch what i say and how i say it, but i feel like i can just be the regular me with him. weird, seeing as to how it took me quite a while to be able to do that with some people i have known forever.  or maybe it is just as my mom says, and i have "blossemed into an outgoing young lady." pisshh-poshh.  my back kinda hurts again, i would take more aleave, but i am affraid of not waking up in the morning...

      staci and kirby went left for their summer program today, and i will not see them for 6 weeks b/c the time that they are gone and the time that i am gone overlap, which sucks, but what can ya do?  last night after staci kirby an i spent about 2 hours in chipotle just talking we went to town center and talked with chris, then over to barns and noble to find staci and ian a sketch book. that boy should never have taken a job that gives him free caffine. he was shaking, but it was hilarious watching and listening to him. what a kid. then i got a book of The Beatles lyrics, with fun pictures and quotes by the fab four. it amazes me that they were able to create so many inspiring songs and melodies when most people can not even write one good song. they are truely my idols.    "We all have Hitler in us, but we also have love and peace. So why not give peace a chance for once?" -John Lennon

      i wonder why is it in movies and tv shows they always have the last day of school with people flooding out the front door throwing up papers and running out...its never like that in real life, or at least at good old south lakes, we don't even have front steps to run down! i haven't yet digested the fact that school is over...but i am boarded then usual, i mean, i have nothing to complain about..."i hate alspaugh" doesn't have the same ring to it any more.

      i love it when people come to visit me at work without telling me about it, in otherwords, a surprise. hillary and todd came by to say hi, and todd applied for a job, but i dunno if they are still hiring, all while i cleaned shampoo off 5 totes worth of bottles...fun, i hate BOB.... i got new glasses, and the only reason was to give staci and ian something new to hate, i figure i have to change it up everyonce in a while.  today when staci, kirby and i went to the mall to get my glasses we ended up being those obnoxious teenagers who go around touching everything. we tried on fake hair, jewlery and large flowers that were simply marvolous.

      kickball was awesome yesterday, and i hope you all who came had fun. team "dream crushers" won, but only by 9 points.... the BBQ and scatogories were a blast, and many good times were had.   i went over to hillarys for her sisters graduation party and met one of hillarys friends, todd. he seems really nice and chill. i dunno what it is about hillary, but when i am with her i just feel like i can be myself, no matter the situation.   then a fun little sleep over with staci and kirby.   and now a runny nose that i can not handle. WHO GETS A COLD IN JUNE!?! thanks staci and ian for passing it along, so glad we all like to share.

      humidity sucks.  i am completly BSing my WL2 paper, and i guess i will just have to suffer next year. sucks to be in in the future i guess. class riveralry is the stupidest thing of my life. i want someone to explain to me how when i walk out of the school and see my car covered in writing, shaving cream and CHUNKY peanutbutter, it is suppose to make me think "oh jeeze, those seniors, their so cool, they really got me good this time!" yeah, well i think is that they are complete idiots. i could care less about them, or the classes below me. thought it might be a tradition it is just stupid. especially the deflaiting of car tires, that was just rude, mean and inconsiterate. oh and another question, why would a senior write on my car "BOO 03'"?? 2003 was last year...they are the class of 04' and i am the class of 05'....this kids a smarty, bet he/she is one of those lucky kids going to NOVA in the fall!

      JUNE JAM TODAY! wahoo, yeah, besideds the first about 4 minutes, it sucked. it rained a lot, and it was cold, but i did get ice cream and some of becca's cotten candy.  got our yearbooks, interesting....  they spelled my names oh so wrong, patricks comment on it: "Hey, how do you spell her name?...I dunno, just throw a bunch of vowels in there!"  i love and hate yearbooks. i love knowing that they truely are memories that i will have forever (even though my own personal picture are way better. not nearly as many fake cheesy smiles.) abut at the same time i HATE signing peoples. b/c there are always those times when people you arten't really friends with ask you to, and you say yes to be nice, then you have to write some crap like "its been a good year, have a great summer. HAGS!" and then they want to write in yours and pretty miuch write the same thing. well this year there are only about 10 people i want to sign mine. so i think that i should only have to sign 10. DEAL!   we (patrick, kirby, ian and staci) chilled at my house for a while, taking crazy pictures and just scanning through the yearbook. we played scatagories....flongeray...good one kirby. i still like government issued military boots.  now for a ride to cold stone, then SATs tomorrow....dun duh duh, this time i am totally going to milk the whole extended time thing.  7 hours of test taking here i come!

      yesterday after i had an unforseen little breakdown i saw a police parade with jesse. about 13 police vans, cars and a firetruck drove by. i waved. i am sure it had something to do with the DNC going on, or maybe there was some police graduation! either way it was marvolous!

      so after i left my popcorn bucket eating family (adam got THE BUCKET of popcorn at the movie theater two weeks ago, and we ate the whole thing....twice! yay! for free refills) family to come to this wonderus place of art i made friends right away. our dorms are amazingly huge, and i have my own room with 3 other room mates that share a bathroom and common space. i became very good friends with a lot of the other kids and find myself wondering in and out of others rooms as if they are my own.  the artistic ability in this place is amazing. its like you can reach out and feel the creative energy. i love my classes, even if video is not my favorite thing to do, it is still fun, if you can get the computer to work with you. drawing has slowly become my favorite class, and i love the teacher, john, an ex-hippie, pot-smoking artist.   &nbsp;  I LOVE JESSE!

      another movie review...the termanial....very cute. i found it entertaining and tom hanks did a very nice job, and i enjoyed watching him. it was a little drawn out, but all in all a cute movie.   as for me my life has been one big blurr really. this blurr has consisted of family, sleep, too much cable tv, movies, shopping, yummy resturants and the beach. i don't ever know what day, or time it is and i quite enjoy it that way. all i know is that i go to school this sunday, and i dunno how i am going to be able to close my suitcase again, especailly since i have been shopping. and speeking of shopping my addiction continues....the other day at marshalls i got 2 pairs of tenis shoes. one green to help complete my goal of owning every color pair of shoes (all i need now is orange, yellow and pink!) then i got another pair of kangaroo shoes, but they were only 12 bucks!!! they have an uber cool velcro AND zipper pocket for twice the protection from loosing your change or possible condom on the side of your shoe. 12 BUCKS! how could i not??

      i saw Farenheight 9/11 the other day, and my first responce was really just shock. i did not understand how some of the things i saw could be possible, especially all the links between bushie and beladen and all that jazz. a lot of people after seeing it said that they thought even if they agreed with moore, ad disliked bush, thought it was over the top. i didn't think so at all. first of all moore has stated many times that this is HIS MOVIE. meaning it is his oppinion and he could do what ever he wanted. so i took it as though mostly factcual, still propaganda...but i thought it was unbelievable, and anyone who is voting in the next election needs to see it before they vote. i would like to see it again b/c it was just so much info, hard to take it all in at one time.  spiderman...i liked it. i was expecting it to be crap. i admit the acting wasn't exactly amazing, but hey, good story. a lot of other people said the story sucked, but talking to adam who actually read and has the comic book said that it was very true to the comic book. i personally thought this one was beter then the first.   back to the real world....i got burned and badly the other day at the beach. bad enought to wake me up in the middle of the night b/c i can't lay on my back to sleep. it felt like someone was sticking me with little tiny pins all night.   i've been with adam and kate the past 2 days, which has been fun. i dunno, kinda weird sitting on ther couch watching tv while they pack. i would offer to help, but i wouldn't know what they wanted. so i just sit. but at least i am getting to spend time with him before he leaves for cali.

      well  the drive was wonderful...if you can call sleeping in the back of a car for 8 hours wonderful. but luckfully ian kept me comapny with a few texted messages. we had chinese food then i stayed up until about 3 in the morning rottng my brain with cable TV. i am actually really glad i don't have cable at home...i would never move. i watched road rules for about 2 hours straight. fun times. today i got to go to onr of the like 8 beaches up here that is uber close, and just sat, and slowly develped a slight glow...aka the start of a burn.  then we went to a 4th of july party with so much sea food. GOOD seafood, not the crap they have down in VA. but this stuff is good, seeing as to how it was probably caught this morning. clam chowda,and lobster were my favorite, and i am stuffed. but then we took a little walk to a beach and had some ice cream, but onl b/c it was from the ice cream man!  now a day of vegging and mabe a movie

      wow, i am hyped up on caffeine right now.... i had a very eventful day today, though it started out with me hitting the snooze bar about a half dozen times, but THEN i went to the YMCA and ran. did a few errands then went over to ian and tried to call kirbys mom, but her brother Sam picked up. and ian and i could not stop laughing... jay..period...dot...WHATS HIS NAME!?!?!... i literally started crying, i have laughing so hard.  then ian and i went on a little journey..first we went to my synagogue and i got an award for being cool, ha! i actually not really sure why i got it, but it came in a cool frame. then we took a trip down memory lane while passing cultivated land being prepared for cookie-cutter houses. we discussed which large construction truck we would want, i decided a steam roller is not quite as cool as one of those digger ones. we went to rugged warehouse and ian bought me a kickass 3 doller belt and he got two shirts too. then DSW and he tried on some nifty red shoes, then wal-mart where they had the same clothing since last time we were there, but at least the creepy girl-scouts weren't there any more. but some rude lady asked for 50 cents, but she didn't say please, so we didn't give it to her. best buy, then got my pants. then best buy again to get ian some really expensive head phones then dinner at Hooters with peter and sam. ian thought our waitress was very pretty, and natural...i thought she looked like a regular girl. but boy oh boy they make one mean grilled cheese sandwich. mary grace joined us, and we ended up hanging out in the parking lot in front of a bitchen cool car with FLAMES ON THE SIDE!!! peter made a glorious little rhyme for me:  "roses are red violets are blue-ish if it wasn't for Ariel then no one would be jewish!" i love it! we then took a little trip over to starbucks and coldstone. ::yummy:: i had to say buy to peter, sam and mg...then take ian home, only to return to his house again to drop off a cd.  now for the past about 3 hours i have been paking...and wow i don't think i am doing a very good job. yes i will be away for 5 weeks, but i think i am over packing...meaning i have already filled a HUGE dufil bag of JUST clothing...meaning i still have to somehow pack all my beding stuff (they tell you you have to bring it) towles,pillow, alarm clock, toiletries, cds and player, and a few other random things...but i don;t want to be one of those huge losers who has like 4 bags of stuff. *humf* i don't even know how all my stuff and my parents stuff is going to fit in the car tomorrow..something bob will have to deal with in the morning. oh gosh, tomorrow is going to be a fun 9 hour drive with the rents, b/c we all know there isn't going to be ANY traffic on a holiday weekend....yeeeaahh... well once we get there i will have some time to chillax with family and go to the beach and just relax slash become very bored. and get to worry about the week to come, why worry you might ask, well since i have all night to stay up (so i can sleep all day in the car tomorrow) i will tell you..... i am freaked out for a few reasons,  one-->you can't fake being good at art, as i am sure most of you know...but i have no idea how i "match up" to the other people who will be going there, and well i don't know what is going to be expected of me.  two--> i have no idea what kind of people will be there...there could be those super artsy-fartsy people who look more arty then they actually are, but act so cool it doesn't matter. or there could be those like wallflower type of people who and (not to be uber mean but) nerdy, in that way where they rather sit around in their room drawing a still life then go out and have fun. or then there could just be those people like myself who love art, and are good at a few things but still have a lot to learn. AND i have no idea the boy to girl ratio...not that it really matters, but i am just curious.  and three--> what the free time will be like...i have my course schedual and i pretty much have class from 9am-5:15pm (thats all including breaks) but after that and the weekends, i have no idea what to expect.  so really i am just nervious about the whole thing.  and i can't decide if i like, or hate making new friends...i know they are both polar-opposites, but i can't decide. i love getting to know new people and just hear their stories an yadda yadda, but at the same time it is a lot of work sometimes, to try and fit in, and find the right group. and at something like camp if you don't find your little group in like the first day then you are pretty much screwed....sad as it may be, thats usually how it works.  and then all the while i miss my friends from home. i haven't seen staci and kirby since they left, and i won't see them for a total of 7 weeks, pluse all my other loves that i won't see for 5 weeks. as sam said tonight "thats like the whole summer!" I KNOW!  wow i need to finish packing but i don't know what bag to use and now i am just rambling and i am pretty positive no one cares enough to read all this, but my fingers just keep moving...i think i will move them over to folding towels.....

      on saturday night after our little costume party (i was a surfer...narly...the idea of being afdam and eve was a little too hard, so we ditched it) we went to see the rocky horror picture show at midnight. we all dressed like slores (cross between slut and whore) and got on the train to go down town. we almost didn't get in b/c they ran out of seats, but lauren begged and they opened up some seats just for us. it was so much fun. and it made me understand the perk of being a wallflower ten times more. they played the movie on the screen then acted certain parts out in the front. and when they plaed the time warp we all got up and danced. it was so much fun and i was picking rice out of my hair until the next day. the only crappy part was on the way home i got eaten alive by bugs...i got 9 bug bites on my back..they hurt so bad. this is my last week here in paradise, and i will have to return home ::sigh::
