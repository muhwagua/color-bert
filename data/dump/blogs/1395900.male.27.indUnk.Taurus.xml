       urlLink Nina Simone, Jazz Singer, Dies     NEW YORK (AP) -- Nina Simone, whose deep, raspy, forceful voice made her a unique figure in jazz and later helped define the civil rights movement, died Monday at her home in France, according to her personal manager. She was 70. Clifton Henderson, who was at Simone's bedside at her death, said she died of ``natural causes'' in her sleep after a long illness. He refused to provide the name of the town where she lived. ``She inspired other singers to do what they believed in,'' Henderson said, saying the musician would also be remembered for her activism. ``She'll definitely be looked at as a civil rights movement leader.''    Nina Reminded me of a fierce "take no shit from nobody" grandmother type.  She had a voice that was brash and abrasive yet, she could elevate your mind, soothe your soul, and warm your heart with her melodies.  May the legend rest peacefully and live on in our hearts.  She will truly be missed.

       Adjustment Periods and Other Random S@$!      As I sit here clearing out my e-mail inbox and listening to MP3s...I can't help but miss my peeps back in NYC.  It doesn't help that Janet Jackson's  Together Again  is playing in my ear right now.  It's funny how you think you'll be okay and make a quick adjustment to a new situation and it's not the case at all.  I am having a real hard time with everything.  Sure, people say I will get over it and things will fall into place, but when??   In other news, today was a really productive day for me.  Most of it was spent housekeeping...much needed housekeeping.  I almost decided to clean up leaves in the yard.  I haven't lost my mind just yet, maybe tomorrow... :-)   For those of you wondering, this site is still under construciton.  I'm in the process of finding an image host so I can post pictures, projects, and whatever else floats my boat.  I'm also redesigning the template for this blog to be a reflection of my style and vision.  This current look is cute and generic...two things I know I'm not. Beautiful and unique would be more appropiate adjectives, I think.        Question of the Day :     If someone you know gives you a project  with a deadline  and no discussion of compensation, nevermind the fact you didn't exactly agree to it, should you feel obligated to complete it anyway?    Find out the answer tomorrow....

      What the  hell  do I want?  Today, has been very confusing for me.  For some reason, I'm feeling very introspective and wonder about the direction my life is taking and where I want it to go.  I wouldn't say that I'm depressed or sad, just confused.    The realization of the reality of my life is just unsettling.  It's funny how true the saying "You don't know what you've got, 'till it's gone" is.  My early 20's I had a lot going for me.  I was moving up the ladder in NYC professionally, socially, and personally.  I really miss all of that the money, the popularity, the freedom.  Unfortunately, my past bad habits caught up with me causing me to burn some bridges I wish I hadn't.  Then again, I wouldn't change my experiences for anything.   (See what I mean about confusion.)   Now, I'm back in my hometown of Richmond.  The duration of time I was supposed to spend here has been extended.  Access has been limited (due to lack of transport).  Thus my career options are limited.  Socially I've been very limited...Mostly because of the lack of a big "mixed" and/or gay social scene.  Going to the same two or three bars every other weekend, seeing the same people isn't my idea of a glamorous social life.  Plus, the scene is very cliquish here...Everyone keeps to themselves or their selected group.  I miss going to parties and the host introducing me to all the people I haven't (sometimes I have) met before.  It was just gracious...And made me feel like I belonged unlike I do here.    This reminds me of when I was chatting with my friend Mark on our way to watch  Kill Bill Vol. 1  at my best friend Charles'.  He said, "If you want to know other people outside of your normal circle, you usually have to date someone from another circle".  That statement is very true...And just a little sad.  So, the point of all this is.....  I don't know what's next, what to do, how to do it, or what I want to do...  Part of me, just wants to accept the status quo and deal.  The other part, wants to shake things up.  Lord if I know....  I would continue this on further, but writing this and listening to Tori Amos- Boys for Pelee  is staring to depress me.    Plus I'm starting to ramble and that's never a good thing.

       What's on My Mental "To Do" List    Figure out ways to be productive on my day off.  Then again fuck productivity! :-)  Watch Janet Jackson  urlLink "All Nite(Don't Stop)"  video 4 more times.  It's the cleaned up version, but oh well...  It's still HOT!!!!  Relinquish the gigs of porn I deleted last night.  Stay away from  urlLink Gay.com  chat rooms.  It's like bad television...You know it's a waste of time, but you don't want to miss a moment of it.  Clean out my e-mail box.  Watch  urlLink Janet  video 3 more times.  Catch up on  The Sopranos .  Catch up on my blog reading.  Finish the scarf I haven't touched in 6 months.

       Go Charles!!! It's your Birthday...   Yes, Ladies and Germs today I turn 27.  It's not a big milestone or anything, but it  is the only day of the year I can be totally selfish and get away with it. :-)  Well, not really.  Here's the rundown of my weekend.   Friday: Roommates and Co-workers  Nothing special went down...Had dinner at Friday's and one to many ultimate martinis.  I was invited to go to Lauren's for an after-party of sorts, but I couldn't make it....Passed out on the couch as soon as I returned home.   Saturday: Friends  Last night I was totally fucked up.  Besides having three drinks at Barcode, a co-worker of mine gave me a little gift.  Needless to say I was flying and danced more than I ever had before.  I'm not hurting now, but I will in about two days.  Godfrey's was fun...Charles, Mike and myself worked it on the floor.  Dave was also out who I haven't seen in a while.  All in all, a good time was had.   Sunday: The Big Day  Today, was kinda disappointing.  It was just my best friend Charles and myself hanging out.  I did some minor damage at  urlLink Saks  on a Khiel's run.  Then we finished up with dinner at P.F. Chang's in  urlLink Stony Point  (my favorite new mall).  It was fun, but more people were supposed to join us and didn't show...That's what made it disappointing.  Now, I'm home and just hanging out.  Better luck on my 28th I guess.  So, that's the b-day rundown.  Nothing too out of the ordinary, but fun.  I also made a b-day mix CD with all my favorite glam pop and lounge tracks.  This is the cover.     It was distributed to my friends as sort of a "goodie bag".  Here's the Track Listing:  A Very Stylish Girl - Dimitri from Paris The Time is Now - Moloko After Dark -  urlLink Kylie Minogue  Put Your Hands on -  urlLink Janet Jackson  A Forest Mighty Black - Theivery Corporation Voyager - Daft Punk Feels so Good -  urlLink Jamiroquai  Dancefloor - Kylie Minogue Little L (Bob Sinclair Mix) - Jamiroquai All Nite (Don't Stop) - Janet Jackson Milkshake - Kelis Hey Mama - Black Eyed Peas Strawberry Bounce - Janet Jackson Infectious Groove - Miguel Migs Ultimate High - Miguel Migs Sexelevatormuzic - Theivery Corporation President Chimp Toe - Fila Brazillia Sex and the City Theme - Groove Armada   I would also like to say Happy Birthday...To My Girl  urlLink Janet Jackson .  Love YOU!!

       Good Morning, Sunshine!   Sometimes, I wonder if it's worth getting up in the morning?  Not that I'm suicidal, depressed or anything like that....I'm  NOT  a morning person.  Looking forward to the drudgery of annoying customers, slack co-workers, and pissy management is not my idea of a good time.   I would rather visit an art gallery, spend the day at the park, or read fashion magazines at my favorite coffee bar.  Unfortunately, that luxury isn't mine to have this morning.  Duty calls and I must "grin and bear" it.  Just had to get that out.   In the meantime check out some of the blogs I've been reading.  They make the morning a little brighter.

       Ah...The Weekend    Well, it's been a year since I've posted...and I'm not going to backtrack.  so here we go.  A new day...a new beginning.  Despite the fact that I worked all weekend.  I must say it wasn't all that bad.   Friday Night, I was out clubbing at   urlLink Catch 22   with my co-worker Dana.  It was....how shall I put this....Interesting.  Personally, I'm not into 18+ establishment (especially straight ones) simply because I don't like dealing with kids.  For the couple of hours I was there, my not so glamorous high school past was flashing before my eyes.  So, I did what I do best in uncomfortable situtations...drank.  As the vodka poured, my outlook improved.  I didn't drop it like Beyoncé (which somehow I've become famous for doing) , but I did jiggle it a little.  I also wasn't the only "family" member there. I was asked to dance (via. his gal pal to my gal pal)...I refused.  Not because I didn't want to...I just didn't feel comfortable in that environment. It was just to awkward and weird....plus it's Richmond.  Things like that just don't fly here.  Needless to say,  Saturday morning was not very pleasant.  Thankfully, the "perky" I had before I passed out helped kill a potentially nasty headache.  Saturday Night, I went to see  urlLink Van Helsing .  Why?  'Cause I didn't have to pay for it. The visuals were not bad...they were actually excellent.  There was just the most cliché plot I've ever witnessed.  I am not going to rant anymore about that...just save your money.  So, that was my weekend and my first post of the new year.  It's by b-day this week so I'll keep you posted on the activities.

      Fashionistas, listen up!!  It's time to reevaluate your closets, hit the gym, and pay off the credit cards.  Men's fashion week in Milan has begun!!  I'm far from being a fashion editor, but over the next few days I'm going to give you the lowdown on what to look out for next summer. Let's begin, shall we...  BTW, to view images from the shows go to  urlLink ModaOnLine .     urlLink Gucci     The Theme : Moroccan  The Grade : C  The Review : This collection included very Middle Eastern elements such as coin embroidered tunics, Nehru collars, muted earthtones, and ornate jacquard jackets.  I wasn't impressed.  The collection just lacked that certain something that has made Gucci the label to desire for the past decade.  It lacked Tom Ford.  It lacked the aggressive sexiness that made you want to be a "Gucci Man" or at least fuck one.  To give the new design team credit, they are trying to define their vision for the label.  It has some sultry elements like the creamy pinstripe suits, sheer tunics and leather belted swimwear.  I'm going to give the new team a couple of seasons to define themselves (much like I did when Tom Ford took over at  urlLink YSL ).  It will be interesting to see what comes from women's collections this September.   Must Haves :    urlLink Chocolate on White Pinstripe Suit     urlLink Belted Swimsuit in Beige Print  (body permitting)    urlLink Beige and Black Deep-V Tunic Sweater        urlLink Alexander McQueen     The Theme : Post-modern military  The Grade : B  The Review :  I believe this is McQueen's first foray into a  full blown menswear collection (I could be wrong?).  I wouldn't say this collecion was wearable but it was very innovative.  With elements such as jumpsuits, high waisted pants, and retro soldier hats, the collection had a WWI feel that was propelled into the now.  It also had Middle Eastern elements that seem to be a theme with with upcoming collections.  McQueen did his best to avoid the typical military pallet of olive and khaki for a bolder pallet of bright pink and dusty grape.  In true McQueen style, his tailoring was very on the mark.    Must Haves :    urlLink Grey High-waisted Double Belted Pant and Tie Dyed Roll Cuff Shirt     urlLink Grey Embroidered Jacket     urlLink Blue Transparent Shoe with Cut-outs    That's all for now...It's getting late.  Much more to come....

       Hi, My name is Charles and I'm a single black gay male...   ::applause::  As I write this, I've just finished another wonderfully hideous round of chatting on  urlLink gay.com .  Most of the time was spent answering the standard round of gay chat room questions...That goes a little something like this:   Somedude: wassup? Me: Nada just got home from work...Trying to unwind, u? Somedude: just chillin' Me: cool Somedude: Are you lookin? (First of all, I'm not really quite sure what that means, still) Me: Not really Somedude: ok Me: sorry Somedude: it's cool, so what are you into?   That is usually the point in time of the conversation that I A) Close the message window or B) Fuck around with the dude some more until he gets the point.  I'M NOT LOOKING!!!   This is when I ask myself... what am I looking for?    In my not too distant past, I used to love chatting online.  It was anonymous, safe, and I felt I could let my guard down, say what I want to say, and no one would care.  It was also a great place to hang out if you were hard up and looking for fast, meaningless sex  (this was before I discovered sex clubs and the party circuit, but that's another story for another day) .  It's not so much fun these days.  Honestly, it's quite tiresome and a bore, a sign that I am getting too old for that sort of thing.  I'm looking for something a little more real.  I'm not ready to have a full-blown, long-term relationship.  I have baggage I'm still trying to unpack and I don't want anyone else to get mixed up with it.  I do know I don't want just one nite stands and fuck buddies either.  So where does that put me?  I don't know.  I want to have fun, enjoy life, and sample what it has to offer.  At the same, time I want to know what it feels like to be loved, desired, and committed.  They are conflicting thoughts, but in my mind they co-exist in harmony.  This dilemma is one of the reasons I'm so frustrated and moody.  I can be a real bitch when I'm not getting any.  Well, another rant is complete... or incomplete.  I should go to bed.  I have to work in the morning (which was supposed to be my day off).  FUN...FUN...FUN...!!!  Oh BTW, I did run into a couple of people I've talked to before and were cool.  So, please don't think that everyone I talked to were skanks. :-)

      It seems that lately I've been very distracted.  For some unforeseen reason, I can't focus on anything (of importance).  I wake up, go to work, come home, eat, download porn (BTW, I don't even watch it I just download it), watch TV, toss off,  and go to bed.  This routine has been going on for a good week or so.  Honestly, it's been longer than that.  The sad part is I don't know why...Well that's not entirely true.  I think I'm frustrated and stuck in a rut so I do these counterproductive things to distract me from facing my issues.  I really do need to get it together.  I'm tired of hearing myself say that over and over again.  I'm tired of living a life that just isn't me...It burns the very core of my being and I only have myself to blame.  Well enough ranting for now...  I hopefully will have pictures from DC pride up soon.  I had a great time.  It was good to get out of Richmond.

      The following is an exerpt of a converstaion I was having with my best friend Charles about today.  I'm too tired to really rant about here.  What follows should pretty much explain my mood.   charlesg_nyc_77: hey pnut77: hey...  what's up? charlesg_nyc_77: nada...just a high drama day pnut77: haha  oh yeah?  how so? charlesg_nyc_77: well, Steve (store manager) flipped out on me for leaving a till out in the office (I was trying to help a co-worker out really quick).  Then he just went on about how I'd better find a car or another job.  It pissed me the fuck off charlesg_nyc_77: Actually I'm still fuming pnut77: so what are you gonna do? charlesg_nyc_77: I think he's just pissed because Corporate is cracking down on store managers in our district due to some shady business that has been going on.  He was totally cool about 20minutes later.  i guess he felt bad charlesg_nyc_77: Anyhow, Mike (my roommate) offered to take me to Charlie Falk on Thursday to took at stuff.  Regardless I'm looking for something else.  I'm tried of being a fucking puppet pnut77: yeah you really do need to look into something else i think..  find what it is you wanna do and find a way to do it charlesg_nyc_77: That's easier said than done.  There's not much I want to do down here.  I'm going to get my resume together and get it to Saks ASAP.  Even if it's a pay cut the exprience would be worth it. pnut77: yeah, that'd be the first step...  you just gotta go for it and see what happens...  start scratching things off the list charlesg_nyc_77: Yeah...you're totally right.  BTW, my "detox" period didn't last long.  I'm going to try again tomorrow. pnut77: lol  well, better luck next try   charlesg_nyc_77: Yeah...I know.  So how was your day?

      Here's another installment of what's going down in men's fashion for the Spring/Summer '05 Season.    News Flash  :   urlLink Style.com  is now reviewing menswear collections on their site.  I guess  urlLink Conde Nast  has gotten hip to the fact that fashion isn't just for the girls.  So, if you want even more fashion coverage, please check it out.  Otherwise, visit my favorite fashion site  urlLink ModaOnLine .     urlLink Valentino      The Theme : Military   The Grade : A  The Review : Valentino knows how to make a man look sexy, intelligent, and expensive.  His collection for Spring/Summer '05 has the recurring military theme, but luxed to the nth degree.  The overall silhouette was slim with sharp narrow shouldered jackets and slim pants. Olive, khaki, chocolate, and white dominated the pallet to coincide with the military theme.  He did punctuate collection with touches of berry, mustard, and sky blue.  One of the more facinating elements of the collection was a floral print, that from a distance, looked like camouflage.  Overall, the collection was solid and worthy of any man's closet (budget permitting).   Must Haves    urlLink Khaki Trench with White Pant     urlLink Mustard Crocodile Bomber Jacket     urlLink Olive Surplus Blazer with Quartz Pant        urlLink Roberto Cavalli      The Theme : Rock Star  The Grade : C+  The Review :  Mr. Cavalli was up to his usual tricks for this collection.  All the classic Cavalli elements were there animal prints, tight leather, beaded denim. The most interesting pieces were the leather trimmed jackets, the raw pieced jacket and the "scarf" tops. Roberto designs clothing for rock stars (or those unleashing their inner rock star).  It's about sex and galm and not much else.    Must Haves    urlLink Caramel and White tie-Dyed Shirt with Stone Cargo Pant     urlLink Raw Strip Pieced Jacket     urlLink Taupe Sheer Embroidered Split-Neck Top with Caramel Low-Rise Leather Pant         urlLink Costume National      The Theme : savage  The Grade : B  The Review : Ennio Capasa's image of man is reminiscent of  Lord of the Flies .  Key elements of the collection are; heavily slashed t-shirts, asymmetrical jackets, tight pants, and bone jewelry.  The pallet was the same military neutral pallet popping up everywhere.  Mr. Capasa's "pop" colors were chili red and pool blue.  Some of the silhouettes did look a little difficult to wear (but anything on a 2% body fat model looks "difficult" to wear in real life).  Overall, another strong showing from Costume National.     Must Haves    urlLink Olive Suede "Slashed" Tee     urlLink Chili Red Leather Motorcycle Vest and Black Pant     urlLink Black Deep-V Cable Sweater

      I'm back with more news you can use to get your wardrobe in check...  For more complete coverage of the Milan shows, go to  urlLink ModaOnLine .     urlLink Burberry Prorsum      The Theme : Preppie  The Grade : A-  The Review :  Keyword: Color, Color, Color.  Christopher Bailey is continuing his mission to get men into color.  From cobalt blue, deep red, lime green, to hot pink, the pallet is vivid and eye-catching.  For the high-end label of the Burberry brand, you won't see much of their famed Nova Check (except for a pant done in white not the traditional beige).  Key elements include; cotton pants (in slim and loose silhouettes), short trench coats, striped sweaters and polos.  The collection is very wearable and salable.  It should do well when it hits the stores.  All in all, it's a collection that can't help but put a smile on your face.    Word to the Wise :  If you're going to pull off that much color, have the confidence and attitude to go with it.    Must Haves :   urlLink Khaki, Red, and Navy Striped Sweater with White Pinstriped Slim Pant     urlLink Red V-neck Sweater with Floral Applique     urlLink White Cotton Short Trench Coat with Green and White Rugby Tee        urlLink DSquared2      The Theme : Hawaii  The Grade : B-  The Review :  DSquared2 is an unknown label to most, but definitely a label to watch. The collection is (as always) modern, sexy, urban, and denim heavy.  Even though the theme of the collection appears to be Hawaii...You won't find any tacky printed camp shirts or board shorts here.  Instead, the collection features; super low-rise jeans, cropped denim jackets, and vintage-inspired tees.  Nothing about the collection is "new", but what DSquared2 lacks in innovation, they make up for in styling.  These are clothes that can blend in, but get you noticed at the same time.  Dean and Dan Caten are fashions "wonder twins" or at least the  urlLink Dolce & Gabbana  of now.  Keep an eye out for them.

Again, vivid colors are the pallet of choice.  From racing red to kelly green, the colors are as fast a the people who wear them.  Key elements of the collection are; jackets with asymmetrical zippers, track pants, shiny fabrics, and bold graphic numbered tees.  The collection also features some tailored pieces great for a night out.  I am usually not a fan of athletic inspired clothing.  It tends to be either too functional or too "fashion".  Dirk has found a way to make clothing that you will want to wear to the gym and wear out on the town.
