       Wave May Hold More Possibilities Than Wind for UK Two stories out of British papers suggest that wave development is preferable to wind.  The first  article  from the Guardian by Paul Brown (2/10/03)  states that "turbines driven by the tide could make Britain self sufficient without the vagaries of wind."  The article also describes the progress of wave energy in Britain and potential commercial opportunities:  Undersea turbines which produce electricity from the tides are set to become an important source of renewable energy for Britain.  Operating on the same principle as wind turbines, the power in sea turbines comes from tidal currents which turn blades similar to ships' propellers, but unlike wind the tides are predictable and the power output is constant.  The technology raises the prospect of Britain becoming self-sufficient in renewable energy and drastically reducing its carbon dioxide emissions. If tide, wind and wave power are all developed Britain would be able to close gas, coal and nuclear plants and export renewable power to the continent.  Unlike wind power, which Britain originally developed and then abandoned for 20 years allowing the Dutch to make it a major industry, undersea turbines could become a big export earner to island nations such as Japan and New Zealand.  Tidal sites have already been identified that will produce one sixth or more of the UK's power - and at prices competitive with modern gas turbines and undercutting those of the already ailing nuclear industry.  And relatedly, this  article  out of Countrylife in the UK (February 11, 2003) reports that "The Government should look to the tides rather than the winds to produce the renewable energy of the future and reduce the UK's carbon dioxide emissions, according to scientists.  Marine current turbines rely on predictable tidal movements rather than the vagaries of the wind and can access an estimated four times more energy than wind turbines, they said."  This approach contrasts with that of the US which is headed on a faster track to develop offshore wind resources rather than wave.

       New Jersey company progressing with wave energy installation.  Out of Miami Herald.com (January 11, 2003), an article entitled    Company Turning Waves Into Electricity Under Navy Contract  describes the first steps by Ocean Power Technologies, a New Jersey company, to commercialize its wave technology.  According to the article, Ocean Power has completed testing of a prototype and now, "under a $7 million project funded by the Navy, Ocean Power will gradually install a group of power-generating buoys just offshore at the Kaneohe Marine Corps Base in Hawaii. The steel buoys, each wired to a metal canister full of delicate electronic equipment, will be connected to each other in sequence, with the electricity they generate transmitted to land via an undersea cable and then hooked into the local power grid."  The article goes on to describe some of Ocean Power's future prospects: "the company has some promising alliances with marketing partners and has sold a 5 percent stake to Woodside Petroleum Ltd., Australia's biggest independent oil and gas explorer and producer. Ocean Power plans next fall to set up a small buoy system that will sell power to the town of Portland, Australia."

       Questions About Appropriate Regulatory Scheme for Offshore Wind Resurface  Glenn Ritt has an  article  on the questions regarding existing uncertainties as to what regulatory agencies and which statutes govern offshore wind development entitled Is It Time for Congress to Act?(Harwich News, 2/11/03). As the article describes, the Corps is currently permitting the Cape Wind Project under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act (which directs the Corps to permit any structures located in navigable waters or on the Outer Continental Shelf).  However, other offshore projects on the Outer Continental Shelf, such as oil, natural gas and minerals extraction are typically regulated by the Department of Interior through its authority under the Outer Continental Shelf Act.  The unresolved issue then, is whether an offshore wind project should be treated more like a "structure" on the Outer Continental Shelf subject to Corps' jurisdiction or like an oil or gas lease which would be subject to regulation by the Department of Interior.  Currently, the Corps remains the default agency for offshore wind permitting since its power under Section 10 is broad enough to encompass such projects while the Department of Interior has no authority to regulate renewable development of the Outer Continental Shelf.  And that remains the question which Congress must resolve - to leave the permitting of offshore wind (and other renewables) within the Corps' jurisdiction or transfer it to the Department of Interior or some other agency.  [Side note - similar uncertainty exists with regard to development of ocean wave energy as discussed in my article,  Strategies for Resolving Regulatory Uncertainty in Ocean Energy Development , posted at EnergyPulse.net.]

       Another Winergy Proposal in the News Again    Winergy LLC  , a New York company which has proposed an offshore windfarm at Eastern Shore's southern tip has suggested that moving the project from federal to state waters would increase tax revenues to the locality as described   in this article  by Jay Diem, entitled "Ocean Wind Farm Could Provide Revenues," Eastern Shore News (2/12/03).  A company spokesman explained that if the project remained in state waters, revenues would be shared with a "federal bureau."  But as far as I can tell, given that  H.R. 5156  which would authorize the Secretary of Interior to grant rights of way for use of the Outer Continental Shelf for offshore renewable development has not yet been enacted.  In the absence of this legislation, which "federal bureau" is it that would receive tax revenues?

       Delays for Capewind Project   Capewind's Nantucket offshore wind project may be delayed by a year, according to this  article   from the Register at Townonline.com (2/13/03).  According to the article, the extent of the delay depends on the Corps' ability to identify an alternative to the project site which is required for the environmental impact statement that the Corps is preparing for the project.  Also reported in the article:  "[earlier in the week], U.S. Rep. William Delahunt called for Nantucket Sound to become a National Marine Sanctuary, and he repeated intentions to seek a moratorium on any development until the state and federal governments consider the sanctuary plan."

      Welcome to the LOCE Offshore Wind and Wave Energy Resources Weblog sponsored by the  Law Offices of Carolyn Elefant   (LOCE) in Washington D.C.   These days, there's so much happening in the world of offshore renewable energy development both in the United States (which is the focus of this weblog) and abroad.  A weblog, which can be continuously renewed (like the ocean itself!) provides the optimal format for keeping abreast of all the changes.  While we'll do what we can to post relevant news, we welcome submissions and updates from readers.  For more "static" information (such as links to applicable U.S. statutes, regulations and articles), please visit the  LOCE Ocean Energy Resources Website  .

       FERC Says That A Buoy Is a Powerhouse; Enters the Jurisdictional Fray  On February 20, 2003, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), an agency charged with administration of private hydroelectric development on the nation's rivers and streams issued an order in AquaEnergy Project No. DI02-3 claiming jurisdiction over AquaEnergy's proposed Makah Bay Pilot ocean energy project, to be sited three miles off the coast of Washington state, in the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary in Makah Bay.  (We'll post a link to the order when it's published).  The proposed pilot project consisted of four floating buoys attached to the seabed, each containing electricity generating turbines powered by pressurized seawater.  Project power would be delivered ashore via an underwater transmission line to a power station located on the Makah Indian reservation (the tribe is one of the project's greatest supporters)for conditioning and sent on to the grid.  By way of simple background, under the Federal Power Act, FERC only has the power to license hydroelectric projects which the Act defines as consisting of a "dam, reservoir, conduit, powerhouse" and related facilities.   Well, AquaEnergy's project clearly did not have a dam, conduit or reservoir (unless FERC wanted to claim that the ocean is a reservoir, but it didn't go quite that far).  That left the question of whether the project included a "powerhouse."  Notwithstanding its eighty years of administering a hydro program, FERC needed to resort to an ordinary dictionary to define powerhouse.  The dictionary in turn stated that a powerhouse is "a building where electricity is generated."  FERC then changed the word "building" to "structure" and concluded that: "Buoys are structures with equipment for generation of power so they are powerhouses" for purposes of the statute.  In the absence of FERC jurisdiction, Aqua Energy had planned to apply to the Corps of Engineers, NOAA (which administers the sanctuary) and myriad other state agencies for requisite permits.  As many of these permits are not preempted by the Federal Power Act, FERC's announcement of jurisdiction will add another layer of regulation before the project can get in the water.  Sure, a court might overturn FERC's order, just like a court will eventually work out whether the Corps has jurisdiction to permit the Cape Wind project.  But court proceedings are time consuming and no substitute for some real guidance about which agency controls the process.  So state tuned as this newest saga unfolds.

       A Push for Sanctuary Status at the Capewind Site  Another update on the Cape Wind saga, this time from a  piece   by James Kinsella in The Inquirer and Mirror, (2/21/03), reporting on Congressman William Delahunt's (D-Mass) continued efforts to declare the site for the Cape Wind Project a national sanctuary.  According to the article:  Delahunt, D-Mass., is using a report released last week by the Center for Coastal Studies to bolster his quest to make Nantucket Sound a marine sanctuary, a designation that could bar a proposed wind farm from being constructed there.       Last Monday, Delahunt and Peter Borelli, director of the Provincetown-based Center for Coastal Studies, met the press in Hyannis to discuss the report and its ramifications.       The report doesn’t include new scientific investigation of the sound, but summarizes previous research. It also includes a copy of a 1980 state nomination of the federal waters in the sound as a national marine sanctuary. In 1983, the entire sound and nearby areas were nominated as a sanctuary.       The federal government didn’t designate the sound as a sanctuary, at the time although it subsequently did designate Stellwagen Bank north of Cape Cod Bay as one of 14 national marine sanctuaries. In doing so, fishing stocks in the area are protected.       “Nantucket Sound contains significant ecological, commercial and recreational resources that have been at the heart of several past nominations for enhanced environmental protection and conservation policies in the region,” the report states.          The upshot of the report, at least to Delahunt is to demonstrate that the perception of Nantucket Sound as a special place “is not a matter of recent invention. Over the past 25 years, Massachusetts has been trying to make the sound a sanctuary.”  So then, is it just a coincidence that efforts to revive a movement for classifying the Nantucket sound as a sanctuary just happen to coincide with the proposal of the Cape Wind project?

       Another Offshore Wind Project on the Horizon There's another newcomer to the offshore wind scene in the United States - this time in upstate New York on Lake Ontario as described  http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/ny-bc-ny--lakewindmill0220feb20,0,5570717.story?coll=ny-ap-regional-wire">here  in "Company proposes windmill for Lake Ontario," Newsday.com, February 20, 2003.  The article reports that the project is off to a good start, with plenty of community support and a state policy promoting renewable development:  Braginton-Smith has already begun the site approval process. Last week, he met with members of the Army Corps of Engineers, which manages the breakwater. Lake Ontario can bring as much as 250 inches of snow to Oswego annually. Those winds, combined with the county's existing electricity transmission infrastructure, make it an ideal location for wind energy production, Braginton-Smith said. Oswego County is already home to three nuclear plants.  "They were all very excited and were very supportive of the concept," Braginton-Smith said. "There was a general consensus that this shouldn't have any serious obstacles in front of it." Assuming the approval process continues smoothly, the only major hurdle is to gather the $6 million to $7 million needed to erect the first two turbines. Braginton-Smith said he is not worried about financing. In his recent state of the state address, Gov. George Pataki announced a policy of supporting renewable energy projects. By 2013, he wants 25 percent of all electricity produced in the state to come from renewable sources. That would require at least 2,000 megawatts of new capacity from wind, solar or other renewable sources, according to Tom Collins, spokesman for the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority.  We'll be monitoring this process to assess whether  this   offshore wind project might provide a blue rint for future projects to follow.

       Bush's Environmental Policy  Here's an  article   entitled "On Environmental Rules, Bush Sees A Balance," Critics a Threat by Douglas Jehl, New York Times (2/23/03) that provides a good summary of the Bush Administration's record on the environment in several areas, including clean air, clean water and energy.  Renewables merit only a short mention in the article in the from of a brief quote from critics that the White House should do far more to encourage a switch to renewable fuels, like wind power.  Given that the article devotes a sentence to renewables, however, is a pretty good indication of their importance to the Bush Administration's environmental policy.

       Hydrogen Powered Car Proposal Not As Environmentally Friendly as One Might Think  In this  op-ed piece   in the New York Times (2/15/03), Robert J. Kennedy questions whether Bush's proposal to invest in technology to develop hydrogen powered cars is as environmentally sound as it might appear.  Kennedy criticizes the Bush proposal as follows:   Certainly, fuel cells that use renewable resources like wind and solar power to extract hydrogen from water promise America a safe, clean energy solution. However, in a sop to the energy industry, the White House wants to extract hydrogen instead from coal and natural gas (without controlling carbon emissions), thereby increasing global warming and fouling our landscape. Worse, the president wants to build a new generation of nuclear power plants specifically for hydrogen production.  The president's hydrogen plan will further reduce our national commitment to renewables by cutting our already anemic financing for research into wind, solar and other energy-saving technologies.   Is some action such as the hydrogen plan better than nothing?  And does hydrogen production hold more promise for improving air quality and reducing dependence on foreign oil than other renewables like wave and wind?  Let us know what you think.

       Update on Offshore Power Off Long Island  Kim Acevedo has an   article  in Herald online entitled "Winds of Change to Power Long Island" (2/13/2003) reports that since the release of the Long Island Power Authority RFP seeking a developer for an offshore wind farm, various groups in the area have expressed interest in the proposal.  The article reports that:   The wind turbines would be located at least 2.5 nautical miles -- 2.875 statute miles -- offshore. The hum they produce would rarely, if ever, be audible from shore, officials said. "This site has been chosen very carefully," Lowndes said.  The height of the wind turbines, with one blade straight up, would be approximately 360 feet to 428 feet above the surface of the water. They might be visible from shore on a clear day, Lowndes said. The park would have between 25 and 50 turbines that would produce a total of 100 to 140 megawatts of electricity on an optimal day.  The described location of the proposed wind projects within three miles of shore places them in state waters (which extend three miles from shore) and thus, avoids the jurisdictional, "who owns the land" squabble jeopardizing the Cape Wind Project off Nantucket as we've described in other posts.  More information on the RFP is available  here  at LIPA's website.

       Wind and Wave Surpass Nuclear in UK Energy Strategy  An  article   from the Observer by Mark Townsend (2/16/03) reports that the UK's energy policy may soon be nuke-free.  According to the article:     No more nuclear power stations will be built in the foreseeable future as the Government turns to wind and wave energy to provide Britain's future electricity needs.  In a seismic shift in policy, Ministers have agreed to back renewable energy as the best way of meeting the UK's targets to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.  The long-awaited energy white paper will plunge the nuclear industry into fresh crisis by rejecting demands to build new plants.  Until now, government support for renewables has been patchy due to concern that Britain would not meet its carbon emissions targets.  The white paper, which sets out the UK's future energy strategy, will be unveiled by Patricia Hewitt, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, later this month.  Sources who have seen its final draft - agreed by cabinet Ministers last week - confirmed that nuclear power had been superseded by renewables as the Government's preferred way of providing power in the future.  'What is clear is that the Government does not want to build a new generation of nuclear power stations if renewables and energy efficiency can deliver,' said one.

       More Confusion Generating About Regulatory Authority  Yesterday, we had one  post  regarding questions of whether the Corps or the Secretary of Interior have primary regulatory authority over the Cape Wind project.  Here's what the Corps has to say on the issue, at least initially.  By way of background, back on January 30, 2003, the Corps published   a notice   of Winergy's permit application to the Corps of Engineers to install, operate and maintain a fixed tower seven miles southeast of Nantucket to collect data on wind resources.  The permit applications and proceedings can be accessed from the Corps' Northeast Office Website  .  Interestingly, review of the materials there indicate that the Corps also found it necessary to issue a "clarification of its jurisdiction" in response to inaccuracies reported in the media.  The Corps' clarification states:  Under its jurisdiction under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, the Corps does not lease sites to a permit applicant.  The Corps does not secure sites.  A permit applicant does not secure a site nor offer exclusive rights to an applicant.    Now, if an applicant were constructing a project in state waters, it could seek a lease from the appropriate state authority.  But how, then does an applicant secure rights to construct a project on the outer continental shelf?  Does the Department of Interior have the power under the Outer Continental Shelf Act, as now drafted, to grant such leases?  Or does an applicant even need to lease the OCS at all - even where the project will occupy a substantial area of the OCS.  The mystery remains...and either Congress or the appropriate agencies (to the extent their enabling legislation permits) must resolve these questions for offshore renewable development to proceed unobstructed.  Still on the topic, opponents of the Nantucket Capewind project have been able take advantage of uncertainty to stall development (as I predicted in my piece   Regulatory Uncertainty ).  This  article  from the Environmental News Network by Bipasha Ray (2/13/03) reports that:  The seabed of Nantucket Sound belongs to the federal government, Attorney General Tom Reilly said Tuesday, refuting an assertion by the Army Corps of Engineers, which has permitted preliminary construction of the nation's first offshore wind farm in the waterway.  Reilly filed a friend of the court brief in U.S. District Court Tuesday, favoring an environmental group and fishers who are suing the Army Corps and a private developer, challenging the legality of a test tower for the proposed Nantucket Sound wind farm.  The Army Corps, which approved the initial data-collecting tower, argued that the federal government did not own the seabed, and therefore the Corps could permit a private developer to build on that land, Reilly's office said.  Reilly wrote in the brief that the Army Corps' position leaves the seabed "wide open to promoters and developers of all stripes and schemes.  "We have not gotten a satisfactory answer to the question of how the federal government can allow a private party to occupy federal land with only a permit from the Army Corps," Reilly said in a statement, adding that a 1986 Supreme Court decision had already established federal ownership. "It is ironic that the United States has demanded that we pay for the use of Nantucket Sound seabed and is now attempting to let private parties use it for free," he said. .The battle goes on and on....

       Winergy Cape Project Faces Skeptics  The controversial Capewind Project off the coast of Nantucket now has some company - seems that a proposal from Winergy is also headed for "stormy seas" as described  here   in this piece entitled Preservation Group Wary of Wind Farm by Joshua Balling of the Inquirer and Mirror.  According to the article, the proposed project location may adversly affect historical and archeologically sensitive areas:  In a letter dated Feb. 20, Brona Simon, deputy state historic preservation officer with the Massachusetts Historical Commission, asked the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for information on the potential of a data collection tower associated with the project “to adversely affect properties listed in the National Register of Historic Places . . . specifically a visual analysis of the proposed effects on the character and setting of Nantucket Island both during the daytime and the nighttime. The whole of Nantucket Island is in the State and National Registers of Historic Places and is a National Historic Landmark. The Island of Nantucket must be given special consideration.   The project may be archeologically sensitive for drowned ancient Native American sites. The project area is likely to contain historic period shipwrecks. MHC requests that an archeological reconnaissance survey be conducted for the project area by a qualified archeologist with a specialization in underwater archeological survey. The purpose of the reconnaissance is to identify archeologically sensitive areas within the project area that will require further assessment to identify and evaluate any important archeological resources that may be affected by the proposed project.  The article also made mention of exclusive three year leases that Winergy had secured from the Corps.  That's, well... curious, considering our prior post  here  describing the Corps' issuance of a clarification that the Corps' authority to issue a permit did not confer property interests on a licensee.  If that's true, who's feeding the "lease" story to the media?

The legislature had been considering similar action but the Governor's action preempts the need for legislation.  Advocates of a task force  assert that it's necessary because   Massachusetts Bay [is] the Saudi Arabia of wind energy in the Northeast, and yet we don't really have a process in place to come to grips with that reality," O'Leary told the Energy Committee yesterday.  We will provide updates of the task force's work as it progresses.

        Financing Issues With Offshore Wind Projects in the UK  This  http://www.planetark.org/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/20295/story.htm">piece  discusses the future prospects for financing of offshore wind projects in the UK.  The article notes that most of the UK's early offshore wind projects were financed by developers and did not attract much interest by banks because of their small size.  However, as the article reports, financing will be needed for the offshore wind industry to expand.  Two potential issues identified by the article which pose potential impediments to financing are project size and the availability of "renewable obligation certificates" (ROC's)  To make financing worthwhile, projects must be at least 100 MW in size - and projects in the second round of development may satisfy the size criteria.  But financers also remain uncertain as to whether the government will continue to make ROCs (which generate additional income for green energy projects) available and this is also a factor which banks take into account in considering to finance offshore wind.

       New Strategy For Opposing Cape Wind   Opponents of the Cape Wind strategy have taken a new approach as reported   here  in this article by Doreen Leggett in the Townonline.com (Barnstable News) May 1, 2003.  In addition to attacking the project developers, opponents have now launched an assault on the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the lead agency for permitting the project, claiming that the agency has a history of rubber stamping controversial projects and ignoring adverse environmental impacts.  Despite opposition, the Corps is still continuing with its review of the project and preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement.

       Hydrogen Isn't Always the Renewable It Seems To Be  Ever since President Bush announced his hydrogen car initiative in his State of the Union address, hydrogen as a fuel source has received more press.  But hydrogen isn't necessarily the renewable energy it's portrayed to be - whether it is or not depends on the underlying source of energy used to produce it.  For instance, hydrogen can be produced from offshore technologies such as OTEC as described at this  website .  And as this  article  entitled "Renewables Key to Hydrogen Economy" (Brussels May 1, 2003) notes, the success of hydrogen as a renewable in Europe, depends on the successful development of renewable technologies first.  Meanwhile, as for trends in the U.S., this  column   by  Dave Zweifel entitled  "Big Oil Latches on to Hydrogen" Madison.com (May 5, 2003) notes that it's likely that most hydrogen in the U.S. will come from non-renewable sources such as coal and oil.  So at least here in the United States, classifying hydrogen as a renewable isn't quite accurate.

       The Positive Side of Wind Energy Development  Even as the controversy continues over the Cape Wind Project, two articles from the press in that region recognize some of the benefits that an offshore wind project might bring.  The  first  , entitled  Finding Alternatives to Oil Spills in Our Bay South Coast Today, S-T.com (4/30/03) notes of a recent oil spill and argues that obtaining power from sources such as offshore wind could help avoid future spills and the adverse impacts they bring.  The  second , entitled Wind Power to Ease Failing Air Quality, Yarmouth Port  (May 5, 2003) argues that wind power, because it is emission free, can play an important role in improving air quality.

        Offshore Wind Development May Come to Texas  This article,  The winds of Texas , Doreen Leggett, Townonline.com/bourne, (June 25, 2003) reports on a recent study suggesting that the offshore wind resource in the Gulf of Mexico may be more promising than originally believed.  As a result of this finding, offshore developers have been contacting state regulators regarding the possibility of developing offshore wind projects.  The article reports that an RFP for an offshore project may be issued as early as the end of the summer.   But given all of the problems with the Cape Wind problem (see, for example, this prior  post ), why would a developer  want  to involve itself in an offshore undertaking in Texas?  Well, for one, according to the article, by a statutory quirk, Texas, unlike Massachusetts controls offshore lands up to eleve miles out.  Thus, Texas would lease land for project development and developers would pay the state a fee.  State control of project lands eliminates one problem experienced by Cape Wind, namely the issue of how to acquire requisite property rights on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS)where a permit from the Corps of Engineers  does not confer these rights and the Mineral Management Service, which leases lands on the OCS has no authority to issue a lease for renewable development.  Second, aesthetics are likely to present less of a problem in Texas, where residents have long been accustomed to sharing their shoreline views and use with oil rigs.

       Wind to Become A Leading Energy Source   Wind's power to meet energy needs both in the United States and Great Britain is growing as reported in these two articles. The first piece entitled   Wind Power Set to Become World's Leading Energy Source  Lester Brown, Common Dreams News Center (6/26/03) delivers an opimistic report on wind power's ability to meet all U.S. energy needs:    Advances in wind turbine design since 1991 allow turbines to operate at lower wind speeds, to harness more of the wind's energy, and to harvest it at greater heights -- dramatically expanding the harnessable wind resource. Add to this the recent bullish assessments of offshore wind potential, and the enormity of the wind resource becomes apparent. Wind power can meet not only all U.S. electricity needs, but all U.S. energy needs.    The second article,   Gutsy Britain is Boosting Wind Power to Fight Global Warming , Beth Gardiner,  ENN 6/26/03 describes how Britain is pursuing wind development to combat global warming and other adverse environmental impacts of fossil fuel.

       Another Tidal Project  Tidal research continues, as evidenced by this tidal project with windmill-like turbines launched off Devon reported in this  post  and now, the "sea snail" described in   Tidal Turbine Innovation makes waves for renewable energy hopes , Frank Urguhart, Scotsman (6/27/03).   The proposed "sea snail," which will be deployed off Okrney is described as follows:   Standing 15 metres high, the half-size turbine support frame employs an ingenious system of giant hydrofoils which use the down-thrust from tidal currents to hold the structure firmly on the seabed.  The concept avoids the need for expensive gravity or anchoring systems on the ocean floor, which has been one of the main obstacles in the development of tidal generators.   Not only is the project expected to cost less than other technologies which require attachment to the seadbed but its free floating nature allows for more flexibility in where it can be sited.  In addition, the sea snail is a prefabricated device which should reduce production costs as well.

       The United States and Offshore Wind  This longer article entitled   The US Offshore Wind Market - Can It Stay on Course?  by Elisa Wood,  Renewable Energy World (May -June 2003) which focusses primarily on the progress with the  Cape Wind   project, gives a good overview of some of the problems facing offshore wind development in the United States.  Obstacles discussed include the lack of a clear permitting process (well, actually, a disagreement as to whether existing permitting processes are sufficient), opposition from some environmental group and competing offshore users.  On the positive side, the article notes that "consumers are hungry" for green power and many states have implemented a renewable portfolios standards which mandates that a certain percentage of a utility's power come from renewable sources.  Ultimately, the article concludes that the future of offshore wave in the United States may hinge in part on the outcome of the Cape Wind proceeding. (as if developing a project weren't pressure enough without having to worry about the precedent it may set)

       Renewable More Competitive  Here's a  clip   from   Solar Access (June 25, 2003)  reporting on a recent study by Navigant Consulting showing that renewables, particularly wind and solar have become increasingly cost competitive.  This finding should help make renewables portfolio initiatives more popular by removing at least one arrow - higher costs - from renewable opponents' quivers.

       First Tidal Energy Turbine Launches off Devon   From  Edie.Net  comes this article,   World's First Offshore Tidal Energy Turbine (6/20/03).  The article, which contains a photo of the project turbine, describes it as follows:  The turbine looks like a standard windmill, and the principle is exactly the same, albeit underwater. The structure is fixed into the seabed on a monopile and projects a few metres above the surface.   The article reports that project backers believe this concept could rival wind power because ocean currents are more reliable than wind and also because the turbines are less obtrusive.  It will be interesting to follow the results of this new development and see if the developers' hopes for it hold true.

       Cape Wind Projects Costs Plenty in PR Dollars  This piece from the Boston Globe entitled   On Wind, Some Blow Hot and Cold  Stephanie Ebbert, (6/17/2003) reports on the continuing controversy over the Cape Wind project, with many groups which ordinarily support development of "clean energy" opposing the project as inappropriate for the Cape.  Because project developers and their well organized opponents are well funded, plenty of dollars have gone to PR agencies to advocate their respective positions:  As a belated summer season gets underway, both the opponents and proponents are trying to capture public opinion by flooding TV and radio airwaves. Cape Wind is running up to $90,000 worth of 60-second radio ads in which ''Bob'' and ''Honey'' deride fossil fuels as the real threat to the Cape's beaches. Those fictitious characters have to compete with Cronkite, who lends his considerable credibility to the Alliance's TV and radio ads.  The Alliance estimates it has already spent $100,000 on ads. Cape Wind places its media buys at about $200,000, out of the $10 million it has already spent on the project's engineering, planning, and data tower construction. Both sides have paid more money to hard-driving public relations firms and lobbyists.  It is unfortunate that the $300,000 spent on publicity could not have been channelled to other purposes, such as studies of project impacts or potential mitigation for the alleged adverse impacts.

       State Seeks to Zone the Ocean  Partly in response to the  Cape Wind project   and partly due to other proposed ocean developments (including a possible ocean energy project), the state of Massachusetts has established an offshore task force to consider ways of zoning state waters off the coast of Massachusetts as described in this piece,   All Not Calm Beneath Offshore Waves: State Eyes Zoning of Cluttered Sea Floors , Beth Daley, Boston Globe  (6/15/2003).    So what are some of the activities crowding the sea floor?  As the article describes : Dozens of pipes, phone lines, and electrical cables crisscross the coastal waters that stretch out 3 miles from shore. Shipwrecks and the occasional unexploded bomb litter its floor. On average, at least six new aquaculture businesses apply each year to open in state waters while one company has proposed constructing three windmill farms and another wants to generate electricity from wave power. Today, no single map can tell state officials where a century's worth of underwater hazards is located, and that sometimes leads to trouble. Three years ago, a Chelsea drawbridge was disabled for two days after workers accidentally yanked up its electrical cable, which wasn't marked correctly on their map of the sea floor.  The article also notes efforts by the Pew Commission and another federal commission arguing for a more organized national policy to manage federal waters which are located 3-200 miles out.  But according to the article, given the strong history of state management of waters within the three mile offshore zone, complete nationalization of ocean policy seems unlikely.

       More Opinions on the CapeWind Project  Here are two more opinions on the Cape Wind Project from two op-eds,  this one  from the  Christian Science Monitor  and  this one  from the more locally based  Barnstable Patriot.   In the  CS Monitor piece  ,  author Lisa Suhay (who notes that she spent childhood summers on the Cape) takes issue with the apparent hypocrisy of many project opponents:   Perhaps the only serious damage this project has done is to engender the wrongheaded wrath of two usually environmentally friendly icons: Cronkite and the Kennedy family, who also oppose this project. Opposition to the development of this resource appears to be more rooted in a disrupted view and lifestyle than the nobler causes those people have always supported.  Taking a different and more critical approach in his   Barnstable op-ed ,  Daniel Adams (a boater and writer) asks for a simple answer to why the projects must be sited in the Nantucket Sound.  Of the debate over issues like birdkills, jurisdiction, local benefits and so on, Adams writes:   It is all obfuscation, resulting in a needless debate that can potentially set back the environmental movement decades. Opponents of environmental progress will use the arguments employed against Cape Wind's project to shoot down more worthy wind-produced energy ventures. Environmentalists will be forced to eat their own words, weakening future effectiveness by the blood shed on this particular battlefield. Thus, whether Cape Wind gets to build their power plant or not, the loser is, in due course, the environment.  So this writer respectfully asks Cape Wind Associates: If you truly have the environmental movement's interests at heart like you say, then please, select a less objectionable site and put an end to the carnage.   Adams concludes his piece by offering his backyard as a potential site of the project if it would mean sparing the divisive debate.

       Cape Wind in the News, Twice   July 12th brings not one, but two articles from  Cape Cod Online.com  on  Cape Wind .   Wind Farm Panel OK'd in Senate  by David Kibbe reports that the Massachusetts state senate approved a panel to examine issues associated with wind farms, both on and offshore.  The second article,   Wind Farm Savings Disputed   by Jack Coleman shares both sides of the debate on the cost of power and true savings that local residents will realize from the Cape Wind project.   According to the article, the  Alliance to Save the Sound   estimates that the Cape Wind project will save New England customers a paltry 35 cents a month.  Cape Wind does not dispute this figure, but claims that additional savings will come from  attractively priced long term contracts which would result in savings over time (in contrast to say, natural gas, the price of which recently doubled) as well as benefits from Massachusetts' renewables portfolio requirements.

According to the article, the 50 windmill project would be designed as follows  Each windmill would stand 400 feet above the mean water level in a 25-square-mile area running from one to three nautical miles off Smith's Island near the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay. The project as a whole would generate 560 megawatts of electricity during peak production times.   The Corps has scheduled a public hearing on the project for Aug. 19 at Northampton High School in Eastville.

       Fishermen Don't Support Offshore Wind  As reported in this  piece  from Capecodonline.com (7/31/03), local fishermen do not support the Cape Wind project.   In fact, as reported, 300 fishermen signed a petition to the Ocean Task force, asserting that the wind farms proposed for Cape Cod and other coastal areas could harm fisheries and create navigational hazards.  Fishermen have identified the following issues:  "Our concern is 130 turbines will upset the balance of nature and the environment in the sound," she said, referring to the Nantucket Sound wind farm proposed by Cape Wind associates.  Dave Bergeron of the Massachusetts Fisherman's Project said fishermen are concerned about safety hazards posed by turbines.  "I have never talked to a single fisherman who supports the (Cape Wind) farm in that location," he said. "From our point of view they pose a hazard to fishermen. This is not an aesthetic concern, this is about jobs."

       A Proposal for State Approval Over Federally Sited Projects   It's one thing to want to regulate offshore wind but it's another to go so far as to propose broad legislation which would give states the power to approve siting on federal lands managed by the federal government.  But apparently, that's what's being suggested as a back handed way to obfuscate or perhaps prevent development of the  Cape Wind  projects proposed for the Nantucket Shoals, as reported in Kennedy May Attempt to waylay Cape Wind Farm  Doreen Leggett, townonline.com (July 30, 2003) and   Kennedy Retreats on Wind Farms , Stephanie Ebbert, Boston Globe 7/31/03.  According to the article, proposed amendments would  give states the power to influence the siting of wind projects, even in federal waters or federal lands.   "It would give states veto power on a wide variety of wind projects, just wind projects, on federal lands," said Marchant Wentworth, the legislative representative on clean energy for the Union of Concerned Scientists, which opposes any moratoriums on wind farms.   Although Senator Kennedy originally expressed interest in these proposals, he backed off following substantial constituent opposition as reported in the previous articles and detailed further in this  piece  from   Solar Access.com   As representatives from the federal Bureau of Land Management point out, the proposal flies in the face of the government's own efforts to encourage wind development on federal lands." The Bureau of Land Management has recently come up with a policy that invites wind developers to submit applications for leasing.   Would states then have authority over other federally based projects - thereby adding yet another layer of bureaucracy to the regulatory approval process?  But if state approval is limited to wind, why is that so - why do states have more of an interest in regulating federal development of wind than other federally sited projects?  And for offshore projects, states are always going to play a substantial role because the power must be brought ashore through transmission lines that will be laid on state lands.  Thus, for offshore wind, states already play a greater role in the siting process than with other types of projects sited on federal lands.

       LIPA Celebrates Five Year Anniversary; Recognized for Focus on Renewables  This article,   LIPA Marks A Milestone  , zwire, July 31, 2003 reports on LIPA's accomplishments during its five years in existence, including promoting use of renewable and alternative power (such as offshore wind):  LIPA is also exploring alternative-energy sources. It wants an energy company to build the Atlantic coast's first offshore wind farm, roughly three miles off Jones Beach. Thus far, the proposal has found support among many environmentalists and Merrick-Bellmore residents who don't want to see more power plants built because of the health and environmental risks they pose.        The wind farm, however, has raised the ire of open-space advocates who contend that the collection of windmills, which would rise 22 stories into the air, would destroy the view of the Atlantic from Jones Beach.       LIPA also recently oversaw construction of the world's largest commercial solar-energy installation, in Farmingdale. And at a handful of businesses, it has developed small geothermal projects, which use water trapped far below the surface to cool or heat a building.       Alternative-energy technology, however, is in its infancy, and is nowhere near capable of becoming the Island's main power supplier. The Farmingdale solar project, for example, is huge, but can only light the office building upon which it rests, or 1,000 homes.       The power authority has pursued construction of one or more underwater cables to supply the Island with electricity from the mainland, hoping they would reduce the need for power plants. Most notable among them is the cross-Sound cable, which has been built, but its use has been delayed so far by Connecticut lawmakers, who contend that the cable would unfairly siphon much-needed electricity from their state. The authority has also sought a cable or cables on the South Shore, but hasn't yet been able to finalize a deal.

       More Review for Wind Farms  Seems like wind farms are becoming the new nuclear power plants what with all the proposed regulation.  This article  Wind Farms Targeted For Stricter Review  , AP (July 26, 2003) reports on new proposals to regulate wind.  Apparently one of the criticisms of the existing regime is that "there is no federal regulatory process for approving the gangly producers of renewable energy."  Project opponents say local communities should have a say in the projects, which can have a broad impact on the environment and aesthetics.  In addition, lawmakers also want the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to have a say in how projects fit into a region's energy needs - even though traditionally,  siting of generation has been a matter for state regulatory bodies.

        Cape Wind Hoping for Production Tax Credit   According to this report,  Cape Wind Eyes Subsidy , Jack Coleman, Cape Cod Online (7/26/03), the proposed wind production tax credit in the Senate Energy bill would provide Cape Wind Associates with $28 million annually for 10 years once the project's 130 turbines were up and running.  Cape Wind president James Gordon admits that the subsidy is critical, explaingin that: "It would be tough to do it without the (production tax credit)," Gordon said.

       Historian Opposes History Making Wind Farm   That the  Cape Wind  project might make history as the first offshore wind farm in the United States apparently holds no sway with Historian David McCullough who "denounces" the project as reported in this  article  by John Leaning,  Cape Cod Online  (July 26, 2003).  According to the article, a radio ad by McCullough, a year-round resident of West Tisbury, asks: "How would you feel if you heard that in one of the most beautiful unspoiled places in all America, a sprawling factory was to be built?"  Apparently, McCullough believes that the proposed wind farm - "to call it a wind farm is to romanticize what in fact is a factory" - would transform Nantucket Sound "into a 24-square-mile city with fog horns and hundreds of blinking lights.

       No Surprise Here - Senator Kennedy Comes Out  Against Cape Wind  Though as reported  here , Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts has flip-flopped a little on how vigorously to oppose Cape Wind, a recent speech leaves no doubts about his position as reported in   Kennedy Voices Displeasure Over Cape Wind's Proposal , Jay Fitzgerald,  Boston Herald , (8/8/03).  As the article reports  U.S. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy yesterday openly confirmed one of the state's worst-kept secrets: He opposes a controversial plan to build 130 400-foot-tall power generators on Nantucket Sound's Horseshoe Shoal. The Hyannis Democrat, who has knocked the wind-turbine plan and the lack of local, state and federal rules to govern it, felt it was time to state his views more clearly and comprehensively, a spokeswoman said yesterday. In a statement yesterday praising the ``incomparable Nantucket Sound'' and noting his family ties to Cape Cod, Kennedy sharply criticized the project proposed by Cape Wind Associates. We must do all we can to see that this first-of-its-kind project receives enough state and federal scrutiny to justify its going forward. So far, in spite of all the loud rhetoric on the issue, Cape Wind hasn't met that test, and I doubt they ever will. Until they do, the project should not go forward. Far more is at stake in the decision than our backyards, and I make no apologies for opposing this project now,'' Kennedy concluded.   Cape Wind officials remain optimistic, however, that after the extensive environmental studies now ongoing that Kennedy "will come to realize that the public's interests'' are protected.  That is, of course, assuming that the opposition is about the project's impacts and not the view from Hyannisport.

       Wind Expert Questions Offshore Wind  Noted wind expert Robert Thresher of  the National Wind Technology Center  has some questions about  the still unproven durability of offshore wind plants, as reported in   Wind Power Expert:  Offshore Turbines Riskier Than Onshore , Doreen Leggett  (Townonline.com), 8/7/03.  According to Thresher, most studies of wind generation turbines have been on land and do not necessarily show how projects will fare offshore:  "With offshore, it's still really risky," [Thresher] said.  And that risk is compounded because it costs 30 percent to 50 percent more to construct turbines offshore than on land.Offshore turbines have been constructed in Europe, especially Denmark, and there is ever-increasing data and modeling on how well they stand up to ocean weather and tides, Thresher explained. "But what about the big blow?" he asked. "The poor wind turbine is out there. Extreme events (we) can't model too much. How big a wave do you have to design to?"  Still, siting all wind farms on land is no solution - because in places like North Dakota, where the wind resources are ample, there's a lack of tranmission lines to get power to load centers.  Thresher estimates it would take 20 to 30 years to construct a grid system to meet the 33 percent goal.  By contast, offshore projects are sited near the coasts, where most people live.  For that reason, Thresher remains interested in the offshore option, pointing to a European Union study that identified waters off China and the United States as most suited to wind farms.

       The "Green" In "Green Power"  Renewable energy is green in more ways than one, according to this report,   Reports See Major Growth in Store for Renewable Energy   (8/8/03).   According to the article, undeterred by a lagging world economy, the use of renewable energy has experienced an unprecedented surge in growth over the past few years  - generating, for example, $7 billion worth of wind tubine sales in 2002 and 100,000 jobs. Falling costs and new government policies account for the dramatic growth in development and use of renewable energy.   According to  Worldwatch president Christopher Flavin. “A decade from now, renewable energy is likely to be an accepted part of the mainstream energy business -- and in a position to dominate the market for new electricity generators.   So it looks like green power is finally making some "green."

       Australia Gives Wind and Offshore Wind Some Thought   There's some progress being made towards increasing the supply of alternative energy in Australia and moving away from cheap but dirty fossil fuels, as reported here  in   A Mighty Wind   (8/8/03).  The article describes:   Australia is the highest per capita emitter of the greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming, largely because of a love affair with cheap and plentiful fossil fuels such as coal. While billions of dollars in government funding are ploughed into cleaning up coal and looking for solutions to its emissions problem, environment groups argue money should also be put into developing an alternative energy industry that will, one day, be able to make a more significant contribution to energy supplies.  Consequently, Australia is looking to the lead taken by Europe with its substantial increase in wind energy, including offshore wind farms which "capture strong streamlined breezes that race over the sea."  In particular, environment groups say something similar should occur in Australia and are campaigning for the Federal Government's Mandatory Renewable Energy Target, now under review, to be raised from 2 to 10 per cent by 2010.

       Get Your Wind and Ocean Wave Data Here  If information drives progress, then we ought to expect an increase in offshore wind and wave projects in British Columbia, now that BC Hydro is making data on wind and ocean wave energy that it collected through its monitoring program available to interested parties as described in  Data Backs Wind and Ocean Wave Energy  , Solar Access (8/5/03).  BC Hydro's Vice President is more than willing to share the information  "BC Hydro has accumulated valuable data at a number of locations in British Columbia that we are eager to share with interested parties," said BC Hydro's Senior Vice-President, Distribution, Bev Van Ruyven. "This will further enable private sector wind and wave energy development in B.C. and help these projects compete in our future commercial calls for new electricity supply."   It seems unusual for a utility to actually want to give information away -  perhaps there is a hope that by making the data available, developers can use it to develop offshore wind and wave projects and sell power to BC Hydro to enable it to diversity its portfolio.

       Ocean Project Set for Hawaii Tests  This article,  Wave Generated Electricity Tests Set  , Bruce Dunford, Star Bulletin (8/4/03) gives an update on the status of  Ocean Power Technologies  pilot ocean energy project at a Marine Corps base in Hawaii. As the article describes:  Ocean Power Technologies holds a $9.5 million contract from the Office of Naval Research to test if the bobbing of subsurface buoys tethered to the ocean floor can efficiently generate electricity for Marine Corps Base Hawaii-Kaneohe. The pilot project's first phase calls for one of the company's trademarked PowerBuoys to be given a buoyancy to ride nine to 12 feet below the surface in 100 feet of water nearly a mile off the Kaneohe base's Hilltop housing area. As the swell passes, the 40-foot-long, 15-foot-diameter, vertically positioned PowerBuoy moves up and down on a rigid pole anchored to the bottom. The up-and-down movement mechanically creates a flow of hydraulic fluid to drive an electrical generator housed in a canister on the ocean floor, said Don Rochon, spokesman for the Pacific Division of the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, which is overseeing the project.  The Ocean Technologies project is one of just a few wave energy projects to reach the pilot stage in the United States, the other being the   AquaEnergy Group's   proposed Makah Bay project off the coast of Washington state.

       If They Say It's Not All About NIMBY, It Really Is  We don't need to add much commentary to Sam Allis' column  Hypocrisy Blows In , Boston Globe (8/3/03):   When former Senator Dale Bumpers began his defense of Bill Clinton in the former president's impeachment trial, he quoted H. L. Mencken: ''When you hear somebody say, this is not about the money - it's about the money.'' And, ''When you hear somebody say, this is not about sex - it's about sex.''  In the same vein, when you hear opponents of the proposed wind turbine project in Nantucket Sound say this is not about Not In My Backyard, it's about Not In My Backyard.  What this wind farm proposal does, quite simply, is to call the bluff of every alleged environmentalist on the Cape and Islands who was weaned to believe that clean, renewable energy is better than sex: Will they think globally and act locally on this one?  Apparently not.  Check out the column to see what else Allis has to say about the Cape Wind project and its critics.

       Yet Another Anomaly in Regulation of Wind on Federal Lands  It's getting tough to keep straight whether Congress wants increased regulation of wind farms on federal lands or not.  As we noted  here  just a couple of days ago,  various proposals have been floating around which would give state and local governments more control - possibly even veto power - over wind farms sited on federal lands - presumably either on the Outer Continental Shelf (think  Cape Wind ) or lands managed by the   Bureau of Land Management   or other federal agencies.  But  the new  Senate Energy Bill   passed on Thursday, would allow for  decreased  environmental review of projects sited on Indian lands (which are also federal lands or reservations managed by the  Department of Interior  as reported in this  piece  from the  Great Falls Tribune  (8/3/03).  According to the article:  Legislation that would allow tribes to essentially get pre-approval from the Interior secretary for any future energy projects on tribal lands is expected to make its way into the Senate-House energy bill this fall. Power plants, wind farms, oil and gas wells, refineries, coal and uranium mines and rights-of-way for electric and gas lines all could be developed on Indian lands without the rigorous environmental studies and public participation now required by the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA.   So if a wind farm is built on a federal land that happens to be an Indian reservation (and as the article notes, the Blackfeet Tribe is planning a wind energy project), then development can proceed with a pre-approval from the Secretary of Interior without even the restrictions of NEPA.  But if the wind farm will be sited on federal lands managed by BLM or worse - on the Outer Continental Shelf, in addition to facing NEPA compliance, the plants will also be subject to an added layer of state and local review.  If there's anyone out there who regards this as a sensible national energy strategy for promoting renewable development, please email us at  loce@his.com , because we consider ourselves experts and we can't make any sense of this.

       Pacific Islands Consider Renewables, But Not Necessarily Offshore  This article,  Renewable Energy Tops Pacific Island Power Talks ,Scott Radway,  Guampdn.com , (August 3, 2003) reports on  recent Pacific Island power talks where participants expressed interest in moving away from fossil fuel towards renewable sources.  The article describes that presently, fossil fuels are cheaper but increasing shipping costs may make renewables a less expensive alternative in the long run since a large part of these small countries' revenues (in some cases, 46 percent) is devoted to imported fossil fuels.  At the same time, those quoted in the article expressed reluctance about development of new technologies:    projects must be considered carefully and advised against having island countries becoming the guinea pigs for new technology that most times fails and leaves islands with little incentive to try again. Islands should employ the established technologies such as solar-, wind- and hydro-power, and slowly phase out fossil fuels, [Roper] said.   So although offshore wave and wind might offer possibilities given that islands are surrounded by waters, it appears that there may be a preference to wait while  these newer offshore technologies become more established.

       CapeWind Wins on Windtowers - for Now  This piece,   Judge:  Nothing Fishy About Cape Wind  , Edward Maroney  Barnstable Patriot (8/23/03) reports on Cape Wind's victory before Judge Tauro of the federal district court in Massachusetts who ruled that the state's authority to regulate fisheries in Nantucket Sound does not extend to controlling other activities there - such as the erection of the Cape Wind project. However, the issue of whether state regulatory powers over fishing would allow it to veto the Cape Wind Project is only one issue in court and is separate from one being pursued by the   Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound  .  In that suit, the Alliance is claiming that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was in error when it permitted construction of the data tower, because Cape Wind had to demonstrate ownership of or the ability to own the location.

       Two Change Course on Cape Wind Project   Like a woman, it's also a college's and former news anchor's perogative to change their respective minds - and these two did.  As reported in   College Accepts $100,000 Cape Wind Donation Orignally Rebuffed Because of Controversy , Glenn Ritt (8/28/03).  According to the article    Cape Cod Community College has reversed itself, deciding to accept a $100,000 gift it originally rejected from the president of Cape Wind Associates because of his controversial wind farm proposal for Nantucket Sound.  The college's earlier rebuff came just as Gov. Mitt Romney was cutting $94,000 from the very program designated to coordinate the gift from Jim Gordon. The state Legislature eventually voted to restore that money. The college's 180-degree shift came after a firestorm over its original refusal. Some education foundation board members complained that there was no precedent for the rejection and that the college lacked a clear policy on gifts. Subsequently, a policy was approved, and Gordon offered the college a second chance, college President Kathy Schatzberg reported.   Likewise, Walter Cronkite has also changed course on the Cape Wind Project as reported among other places,   here   (Vineyard Gazette - 8/29/03) and  here . (Boston Globe 8/29/03).   According to these sources,  Mr. Cronkite said he now prefers to be a more objective observer of both the process and project.  Expressing some regret in a  Boston Globe article   by Stephanie Ebbert, Cronkite is quoted as saying:  "I must say, as [the wind farm] was presented to me, I had to clench my teeth to be sure I didn't get hysterical," Cronkite said in a phone interview. "It sounded like such a ghastly invasion of this wonderful body of water, which is Nantucket Sound.  I will confess, also, that I did not do my own homework as I should have before making the statements. I did not and I can only regret that now."  Combined with a victory over its ability to site a test wind tower (reported above), it seems like a good week thus far for  Cape Wind .

       Two In-Depth Articles on Wind Power, Need for Power, Conservation and How Hard It Is To Get It All Right   In the wake of the blackout, the last week of August brings two in-depth pieces on wind power and the constant tension between increased demand for power and a commensurate aversion to conservation or additional plant (or transmission line) construction.  In    Wind Power's New Current , Scott Kirsner, New York Times (8/27/03), Kirsner reports that despite controversies with large wind projects (Exhibit 1 being CapeWind),    Utilities and independent developers are nonetheless moving ahead with plans to increase the generating capacity of older installations and establish new wind farms. Michael O'Sullivan, a senior vice president at FPL Energy, the biggest domestic operator of wind farms, said that 2003 "will probably be the second-biggest year in the industry's history, in terms of adding capacity," exceeded only by 2001.  As the country's electrical demand continues to rise, adding capacity is of keen interest. And the power derived from wind is power that a town like Princeton does not need to buy from sources that rely on coal-burning generators or nuclear plants.    And in   Who's Got the Power? , Christian Science Monitor, 8/28/03 Mary Wiltenburg writes about the difficulty of making good choices to the energy shortage.  For example, while conservation remains an option, people like driving SUVs and often, simply "forget" to conserve energy by turning off lights, etc...As for proposals like CapeWind, Wittenburg uses these as an example of other obstacles to solving energy shortages - even where a power source apparently poses no health risks, it still may face opposition for other reasons    The Cape Wind controversy isn't about the environmental issues under debate, argues University of Delaware environmental anthropologist Willet Kempton, "it's about how people think about intrusions into their community."  Alan Nogee, director of the energy program at the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists, agrees. "People have always preferred to avoid energy projects in their own backyards - most of the time for pretty good reasons: because of harmful emissions from these facilities," he says. Because Cape Wind poses no human health risk, Mr. Nogee says opposition to the project is probably the product of NIMBY, or "not in my backyard," syndrome.  Maybe so, says Isaac Rosen, executive director of the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, but "without NIMBYism, the Love Canal, the Hudson [River], wouldn't have gotten cleaned up. Sometimes it's the capacity of a community to stand up and say, 'No, we treasure this too much,' that defines that community."  Of course, if the solutions were easy, we probably wouldn't have experienced last week's blackout and would already have figured out what to do to fix the problem for the future.

       Winergy Proposed Farm Meets Little Opposition in Virginia   This article  Windmill Farm Plan Meets Little Opposition on Eastern Shore   (8/25/03) gives an update on the  Winergy  offshore windfarm proposal for off the coast of Virgina.  As the article reports, in contrast to the  Capewind   project, Winergy's proposal is receiving a kinder, quieter reception -- to the point that sponsors of the clean-energy projects think they might have their best shot for approval in Virginia.   The article notes another aspect of the Winergy project that distinguishes it from Capewind.  Here, according to company official Bob Link   [Winergy] would likely sell its permit if one is granted, leaving a utility developer to build the windmills, lay the connection cables and sell the power. The project is expected to cost close to $500 million.    Still, opposition or not, there's no shortening the environmental review process for the proposed project which will still require at least a year to examine all of the project impacts and lead to issuance of necessary authorizations.

According to the article, the project would be comprised fo a chain of single-file floating turbines attached to the inlet bottom with electricity generated on incoming and outgoing tides.  The project could generate about 10.8 megawatts of electricity.  At present, UEK has approval to install a one-way turbine system in the Yukon River near Eagle, Alaska, close to the border with Canada.   Company president Phillip Vauthier looks forward to his project being the first installed in the United States.

       Ensuring that Wind Is For the Birds  According to this  report from Solar Access , (9/03/03), the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) recently published in the Federal Register  voluntary interim guidelines   to help energy companies avoid and minimize wildlife impacts from wind turbines. These guidelines are intended to help energy companies locate and design wind energy facilities to ensure protection of wildlife resources, while streamlining the site selection and facility design process to avoid unanticipated conflicts after the construction of wind facilities.  As the article reports, the USFWS guidelines focus on three key areas: 1) the proper evaluation and selection of potential wind energy development sites; 2) the proper location and design of turbines and associated structures within sites selected for development; and 3) research and monitoring to identify and assess impacts to wildlife. The guidance is intended for land-based wind turbines and wind farms on all Federal, State, and private lands within the United States.  For now, application of the guidelines is voluntary and USFWS has solicited further comments on guideline effectiveness. The guidelines will be evaluated over a two-year period, and then modified as necessary.   To view the guidelines or file comments, link  here .  At the same time, the article notes that the  Department of the Interior   ("DOI") has been separately re-evaluating its existing renewable energy programs on its lands under DOI management. It is also assessing current limitations on industry access to Federal lands. These actions are intended to both increase the DOI's use of renewable energy and to assist industry in increasing renewable energy production, in an environmentally friendly manner, on Department-managed lands.

       New Jersey Renewable Grants to Foster Renewables, Including Ocean and Tidal Power   For quite some time, many state renewable grant or incentive programs did not cover wave energy or tidal power projects, reflecting a belief that these technologies had not yet reached viability.  That perception is changing, however, as evidenced by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities' Renewable Enregy and Economic Development Program which awarded $2.7 million to renewable businesses, including Ocean Power Technologies which is developing a wave energy system.   Additional details about the grant program and the recipients can be accessed  here  in the Solar Access Report and  here  in the New Jersey Star Ledger (8/27/03).

       New Ocean Technology for Australia   On September 4, 2003,  Macroshaft Pty. Ltd.   issued this  press release   on a wave-powered plant that operates in the open ocean.  According to the press release,    The company's new power plant operates in the open ocean and forms part of a new technology that extracts electrical power from wave motion. After harnessing the power, transmission from the open sea to land takes place in High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) sub-sea cables. On land, the HVDC cables terminate in converter stations, which perform the role of "pollution- free power stations".  This power source is particularly well suited for the West Coast and for the Asiatic economies along the Pacific Rim.    So, ocean energy continues on yet another continent - and still no operating projects in the United States.

       Wind Farm Will Help Recycle Oil Field   Offshore wind isn't just a "renewable" product - it's also a recycled one as well.  At least that's the case with a proposed deep water offshore wind project  which will occupy a dying oil field on the Outer Continental Shelf twelve miles off the Scottish coast - reported here in    Wind Farm to Breathe New Life Into Oil Field   Sunday Herald (8/31/03).  Here's a summary of the project from the article:  The First Minister ... announce[d] the awarding of a research grant of up to £194,000 from the Scottish Executive and Department of Trade and Industry to fund a study to design the world's first deep water offshore wind farm.   The ambitious project, which also has the backing of the European Commission, would see the Talisman-SSE joint venture building up to 200 turbines linked to the existing Beatrice oil field that could generate up to 1000 megawatts of electricity. This is enough to supply power to a city the size of Aberdeen and meet about half of the new-generation energy needed to meet the Executive's renewable energy target. The project would aim to make the most of Scotland's position as a 'wind-rich' country, with 40% of Europe's wind resource blowing around our shores.   McConnell summed up the potential of the project: 'It's the first of its kind in the world. It's using both Scotland's natural resources and the expertise and experience that we have both in the North Sea energy industry and electricity industry to potentially revolutionise the way we generate energy in Scotland.   'That is a massive opportunity. It will help create jobs, it will improve our environment and it will leave a legacy for future generations that could be as significant as some of the decisions that were made about energy policy and the energy industry after the second world war or in the 1960s and 1970s.'   The United States may want to follow the progress of this Scottish innovation and determine how it might fit with our nation's still-evolving offshore program.

       Court Rules That Corps Has Jurisdiction to Issue Permit for Cape Wind Tower   The Boston Herald reports  here  on federal district judge Tauro's ruling that the Corps of Engineers has jurisdiction under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act (as extended beyond three miles offshore by Section 4(f) of the OCS Lands Act, U.S.C. sec. 1333) to issue a permit for the Cape Wind tower.  You can view the decision   here   at the  LOCE Ocean Energy Resources Website   (as far as we know, it's not otherwise available on the web).  Tauro's ruling rejected the position taken by the  Alliance to Save the Sound   that the Corps'  authority over the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) was limited to issuing permits only for those structures that might be erected for exploration and harvesting of oil and other OCS resources.  Instead, the court concluded that Congress' grant of authority to the Corps of Engineers over the OCS was broader and empowered the Corps to issue permits for any structure or artificial island located thereon, irrespective of its purpose.  The court further noted that as a matter of practice, the Corps had used the full extent of its powers under the OCS in the past to regulate all sorts of structures on the OCS, ranging from artificial islands to a gambling casino.  Finally, as a default position, the court concluded that to the extent that the statute contained some ambiguity, the Corps' interpretation of the scope of its jurisdiction was entitled to deference under the Chevron doctrine.   The second portion of the court's decision dealt with - or perhaps, did not deal with, the Alliance's argument that Cape Wind failed to satisfy the Corps' requirement that it obtain and hold an adequate property interest in the project site in order to obtain a Section 10 permit. The Alliance argued that the Corps lacked a property interest in the OCS, which are public trust lands, and thus, could not qualify for a permit under the Corps' own regulations.   The court found that the "property interest" requirement was not a condition precedent, so to speak, of obtaining a permit, the absence of which would preclude its issuance.  Instead, the court accepted the Corps' interpretationof its regulations - i.e., that it could issue a permit after which the applicant would continue to bear responsibility for attaining adequate property interests to construct the project.    So while the decision is undeniably a huge victory for Cape Wind, ultimately, it seems to me that at some point, the "property interest" issue needs to be resolved.  The Corps permit does not confer a property interest on Cape Wind, so what's to stop another developer from putting up a competing use right along side the Cape Wind project?  If I were a developer or investor, I'd want to see this issue resolved sooner rather than later.

       Coast Guard Stays Neutral   In this prior  post  , we linked to a report that the Coast Guard had determined that Cape Wind posed a "manageable risk" for navigation and thus, supported the project.  Turns out, we - and more accurately, the article to which we linked - spoke too soon:  as reported in   Another Flap Over Cape Wind: Coast Guard Remains Neutral  , Alexis Tonti, Martha's Vineyard Gazette (9/19/03), Coast Guard officials reiterate that they have taken no official position on the project, and are only beginning to review its potential impacts.  In act, contrary to articles that the Coast Guard submitted reports to the Corps, the only study submitted was one prepared by Cape Wind's consultatnt and reviewed by the Coast Guard - which offered concerns and suggestions for future study.

       Super Turbines   This article,   Dawn of the Super Turbines  , The Scotsman, (9/19/03) reports on the increasing size and capacity of offshore wind farms.   For example, consider the dimensions of this Danish project:   Denmark, wind farms are a ubiquitous feature of any journey through the countryside. It has recently completed and is now producing power from the world’s biggest offshore wind farm - Horns Reef. Sited ten miles off the south-west coast of the country, its 80 turbines cover 20 square kilometres, and it provides a perfect model to indicate the direction of Scotland’s future renewable energy projects - if ambitious Westminster government and Scottish Executive targets are to be met [...]  The units at Horns Reef, built by Vestas, the world’s leading manufacturer of wind turbines, each have a two megawatt (MW) generating capacity, with a total combined output of 160MW. This is far in excess of the majority of the country’s turbines which have been erected over the past 20 years. When the Danes first began to put up turbines, they were not a tried and tested method of generating energy and, compared with today’s units, often woefully inefficient. Consequently, although Denmark generates 18 per cent of its electricity from wind - the largest percentage of the complete electricity generation of any country in the world - a large proportion of the turbines have a minuscule generating capacity compared to the turbines now being designed and tested at cutting-edge projects like Horns Reef.   But as the article points out, while large projects such as can offer a viable substitute to other energy sources such as nuclear,  at the same time, when developers go offshore, there are additional costs associated with  increased installation, service and maintenance.  Companies are hoping that through new technologies, generating costs for offshore wind can be reduced by 10 per cent.

       Environmental Issues Impact European Projects Too   It's not just U.S. projects like  Cape Wind   facing opposition on the environmental front.  This piece,   Wind Farm Stalled by Study for the Birds  , Edward Young (Solar Access, (9/18/03) reports that a formal complaint by an environmentalist organization has delayed plans for the construction of Germany's first offshore wind farm.  The project will be stalled to allow for the investigation of possible infringement of European environmental laws, including a threat to a potentially endangered species of bird.   Not surprisingly, the developer claims that the project presents no significant threat to area wildlife species -- and in fact will help to protect animal species by generating power through clean alternative means.

       Offshore Wind For Scotland  Plans for an ambitious £40 million scheme to create 20 wind turbines in the sea off the coast of Aberdeen were unveiled on September 15, 2003 - as reported in  Oil City Hopes to Harness the Winds  , John Innes (9/16/03).  The wind farm, which will be half a mile from land, will also be linked to a flagship Energy Futures Centre in the city.  The plan was revealed by Kate Dean, the leader of Aberdeen City Council, yesterday, but she stressed the "jury was still out" on the proposal, put forward by the Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group (AREG).  Link to the story for more news about the project.

       Whoops - Three Tidal Projects Overseas   We just said  here   that there's been news of two tidal projects in the past few weeks.  Make that three.   Here's a story,   Generating Current From Current  (9/18/03) on a tidal project recently installed in the Kval Sound outside Hammerfest in northern Norway which will start generating electricity this week.  Installed on 17 September, the prototype will supply 700,000 kilowatt-hours per year - corresponding to electricity consumption by 35 Norwegian homes.  The prototype has been developed by Hammerfest Strøm in collaboration with ABB, Rolls Royce and Sintef as well as Statoil.

       Another Tidal Project Moves Forward   From  Solar Access  , there's word of a  tidal power project that has secured additional funding    (9/15/03).  The article reports:   A new company has been formed to allow the further development of pioneering technology to exploit the power of the sea. Northumberland-based Engineering Business (EB) has joined with the New and Renewable Energy Center (NaREC) in Blyth to create Tidal Energy Business (TEB).  The technological expertise of EB coupled with a ?1m (US$1.6 million) investment from NaREC in the new company, will allow vital development work on the Stingray ocean energy demonstrator - currently sited on the seabed in 30 meters of water off the Shetland Islands - to continue.  Stingray was designed by EB to exploit energy in moving water, driving a generator through hydraulic cylinders and a motor. EB said initial tests have proved positive and on the back of the establishment of the new company, EB and NaREC expect to attract more funding to build a demonstration Stingray power station [...] The Stingray 150kW demonstrator was first installed in Shetland last year, the first large scale tidal stream generator ever to be installed in an exposed ocean environment. Stingray is currently on the seabed in 30m of water in Yell Sound undergoing intensive development and is yielding rapidly increasing power output and energy capture.   So, that makes another ocean project from across the Atlantic that we've reported on today (see  here  for information on the other project.)

       Proposed Offshore Wind for UK   The Associated Press reported  here   (9/12/03) on plans by British energy group Centrica  to build a wind farm in the Irish Sea for about $160 million in collaboration with two Scandinavian power companies.  According to the article, up to 30 turbines (90 MW capacity) will be erected 5 miles off the northwest coast near the town of Barrow.  Centrica said it has gone into partnership with Danish energy group DONG and the Norwegian power company Statkraft for the project. The three companies have jointly bought Barrow Offshore Wind, the company which owns the rights to develop the site.

Apparently, many project opponents have been concerned that power would be sold to the spot market at premium prices and benefit other consumers and the developers rather than Cape customers who bear the burdens associated with project siting.   According to the article, Gordon's comments alleviate some of those concerns.

       World's Largest Windfarm Being Planned   There's a report  here  (9/20/03) on plans for the world's largest wind farm to be located in the UK.  As the article reports:  London-based Wind Energy, is working on proposals to build a massive wind farm capable of generating 1000 megawatts, almost twice the size of the controversial 600MW wind farm planned for the Barvas Moor on the island of Lewis. Under the plan, around 500 turbines would be sited on the Morvern and Ardnamurchan peninsulas and in the north of the island of Mull. Preliminary discussions have already taken place with local community councils, and so far the reaction has mainly been favourable.   Despite the company's optimism, the wind farm will face some obstacles in getting the power generated south to the main electricity market in England.  According to the article:   “Part of the plan is a large extension of the National Grid. We are considering a submarine cable which will go along the Sound of Mull and up Loch Linnhe to Fort William. It will cost over £100m and it will also serve as a grid connection for any wave and tidal power generation on the west coast, which is the area with the best marine energy potential in Europe.Our cable could also link up with the cable from the Western Isles and also service the rest of the west coast."   And what is the feeling of the community where the project will be sited?  This quote from the article sums it up best:  The feeling is that we would rather have windmills that we can see than CO2 that we can’t.   It will be interesting to continue to follow along to see whether this project is successfully developed.

       On the Edge of Wave Technology   The European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) is ready to serve as a testing ground for the world's latest wave energy devices and provide an independent analysis of their viability as reported in    Orkney on the Crest of Energy Wave , John Bowker, the Scotsman (10/2/03).  The Center has the capacity to conduct four separate tests at any one time and aims to generate L500,000 a year.  The Center will use the exposed Pentland Firth as a testing ground for the world’s latest wave energy devices.   The first company to use the facility will be Edinburgh-based firm Ocean Power Delivery, which is putting the finishing touches to a prototype primed for use on the UK’s first offshore wave farms.  The firm’s business development director, Max Carcas, said: "EMEC has eased the development of our technology considerably - without it we would have had to apply for a high-risk capital grant. Now we can concentrate on the technology."

       RPEBW To Speed Construction of Offshore Wind Turbines and Cut Costs  Ever hear of a technique known as "Reduced Pressure Electron Beam Welding" (RPEBW)?  I hadn't either until I came across this piece,    TWI Technology Promises to Accelerate Production Time and Halve Costings  , Business Weekly - UK  (9/30/03).   According to the article, RPEBW (which is described in more detail in the article) could be used in the construction of offshore wind turbine towers and is expected to speed up production by as much as ten times and cut production costs by half.  The company that developed the technology is confident that it can be putinto commercial use within two years - which will perhaps enable offshore wind farms to be more profitable with reduced reliance on subsidies or incentives.

Seems that wind is starting to fall out of favor with Germany, the world's biggest producer of wind power.  According to the report, Germany's economic minister has suggested reducing various incentives provided to wind to avoid a "subsidy mentality" while environmentalists have attacked plans for Germany's first offshore wind farm to be located in the North Sea, citing adverse impacts such as noise and dangers to birds.  Still, Germany has committed to shutting its nuclear facilities and the power's got to be replaced somehow - so if not wind, then what source?

       Cross Sound Cable Project - An Ocean T-Line Sets Up Turf War Between Feds and States   As a transmission project, the  Cross Sound Cable   is a different type of ocean energy project than the generation projects typically covered by this blog.  The cable is a transmission project - running from Connecticut to Long Island lies in state waters appurtenant to Connecticut and New York.  Of course,  the Cross Sound Cable isn't making news merely because it's an underwater transmission line.  As this article   Cross Sound Cable Debate Sets Off Federal Power Grab   (9/28/03) describes, the project has set off a turf war between the state of Connecticut and the feds.  Although the cable has been completed, Connecticut regulators refused to allow it to operate because about 700 feet of it was not buried to the required depth.   Notwithstanding this injunction, in the aftermath of the August 2003 blackout, DOE Secretary Abraham, declared an energy emergency and ordered the transmission line to be activated.  And the tranmission line has been operating since then, though Connecticut regulators have sought rehearing of the Secretary's orders.    It's possible that these same federal and state conflicts may replay in the offshore permitting arena as well.  What happens, for example, if the Corps successfully permits an offshore project on the OCS but the neighboring state refuses to permit the transmission lines that run to shore to be activated because of issues such as failure to bury the line the appropriate length?  Or what if the state refuses to lease lands for the transmission lines notwithstanding that an applicant obtains a permit from the Corps to construct the project.  This isn't so much an issue for tidal and wave projects where the  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission   has asserted jurisdiction under the Federal Power Act which allows developers to condemn lands needed to construct a project.  But offshore wind developers do not have that ability under the Corps' Section 10 permit program.   So as if offshore renewable developers didn't have enough on their plates with opposition from NIMBY groups and environmental groups, they may also find themselves squarely stuck in the middle of a turf war between the feds and the state.

       Energy Bill to Resolve Regulatory Gaps on OCS   As we discussed  here , the federal district court in Massachusetts may have affirmed the Corps' authority to issue a Section 10 permit for offshore wind projects on the Outer Continental Shelf - but the decision does not clarify whether at some point in time, a developer must obtain firm property rights in order to construct the project under the permit - or to project itself against competing usage.  One potential solution has been proposed as part of the pending federal energy bill as reported by John Leaning in    Wind Farm's Regulatory Gap Filled  , Cape Cod Times,  (9/25/03).  The article reports that the proposed legislation would give the Interior Department authority to require leases and arrange fees for renewable energy and other projects on the Outer Continental Shelf.  According to the article, the legislation is controversial for several reasons.  Some observers believe that the bill could open the door to oil and gas interests that want other projects in the same area, and give an agency with close ties to the petroleum industry unrestricted authority.  Others express concern over ceding permitting authority to the Department of Interior which lacks significant experience in ocean management.   Nevertheless, at some point, the issue of rights to build on the OCS needs definitive resolution if more offshore wind projects are to be developed in the future.

       Ocean Energy Project on Display in Museum   Ocean energy doesn't seem sufficiently old or historic to warrant display in a museum, yet according to this article  here , there's an ocean energy project include in a Smithsonian Best of American Design exhibit at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.  the project, described as a "wave energy" garden and conceived by Yusuki Obuchi is described as follows:  Envisioned for the Southern California coast to replace a nuclear power plant, "Wave Garden" would float like a giant quilt on 480 acres of ceramic pods, generating electricity from the Pacific's waves. When generators shut down on weekends, the 1,734 pods -- each 3 inches thick -- would rise just above the ocean's surface to form lagoons for swimmers and boaters.  It's nice for an ocean project to be recognized in an exhibition, but let's hope that eventually, wave technology will be put to commercial use and not be confined to museum displays.

       Ocean Projects for Africa   Up until today, this blog has reported on ocean projects on all continents except Antarctica and Africa.  But now, there's news of proposed ocean projects for Africa, as reported in  Research Centre to Look at Greening the Desert , Maggi Barnard, The Namibian (Oct 8, 2003).  According to the article, the Marine and Coastal Resources Research Centre of the University of Namibia (Unam) wants to promote research and development activities through the sustainable and responsible utilisation of the country's under-utilised marine and coastal resources."  The Centre's research program will six areas of ocean and coastal development, including  aquaculture, cultivation of mushrooms along the coast and development of renewable resources such as wave energy projects.

       Wind Farm Proposed For Off New Jersey Coast   This article,   Windmill Generator Plants Proposed Off Jersey Coast  , Newsday (October 6, 2003) reports on proposals by several companies to construct wind farms off the New Jersey shore.  For example, the state Board of Public Utilities recently awarded a $300,000 grant to a wind power company, Atlantic Renewable Energy Corp., of Richmond, Va., to study the feasibility of offshore wind energy projects.  And in another proposal, In another proposal, the Bald Eagle Power Co. Inc., a New York firm, seeks to build a 400-foot data-gathering tower at each of nine sites off Belmar, Monmouth Beach and Long Island, N.Y., and two demonstration wind farms off Long Island.  The project's wind turbines would convert wind energy into electricity, which will be used to make hydrogen that would be shipped to shore for use as energy, Bald Eagle explained.  Finally, amid this proposed development, the state Department of Environmental Protection began work on an Ocean Resources Management Plan about two years ago and expects to have recommendations on managing ocean resources, including wind energy, by March.  It remains to be seen how these proposed projects will fit with the DEP's work plan.

       Britain's Power Struggle With Wind   Even as Britain continues to pursue offshore wind project (see  here  for example), opposition to the project also grows as reported in    Power Struggle  , The Observer (Oct. 5, 2003) .  According to the article, wind power:  what was heralded as a green solution to Britain's energy crisis has thrown up a series of new controversies in some of the country's most beautiful areas. The scale of development...is dividing local communities as protest groups fight to save their landscapes, setting themselves against those welcoming new jobs and the rents wind farms bring to poor rural communities. The bitterness of those battles is epitomised by the animosity that the giant wind farms are already bringing to the remote and beautiful Outer Hebrides - an area that has high levels of rural poverty. It's being hailed as our salvation,' says Mary, an islander. 'But it will destroy us. We're a remote community and we do have economic problems, but wind farms won't solve them. We're getting 500 turbines at least 330ft high. Forget saving nice views for hill walkers. This is industrialisation on a scale I can't even imagine.  The article cites other grim information on wind, such as studies that purportedly show that wind plants result in large bird kills and comments that wind cannot survive without continued large subsidies.

       Fund Seeks Investment in Alternative Energy Overseas Finding Few Alternatives Domestically  This  Press Release  dated November 4, 2003 announces the intent of the New Alternatives Fund, a socially responsible mutual fund, to expand its investment overseas by 20 percent (to 35 % of its assets).  The reason?   The Fund's major interest is alternative sources of energy and the Fund managers suggest that the present US administration is not appropriately viewing or serving national environmental concerns.  In the Proxy Statement filed with the SEC, Fund Managers state:  For example, more new large wind turbines are coming out of Europe (Denmark). European countries are sponsoring ocean energy (tidal, wave energy) (Scotland) at a greater rate than the United States. Competitive solar cells are coming out of the Far East (Japan) and organic food products are profitable in Canada.  We seek more foreign investment opportunities to be made available to our Fund. For example, we expect that there may soon be opportunities to invest in companies involved with ocean energy. The foreign countries appear to us have more experience in that developing area of technology.  The Fund's current foreign investments have shown reasonably good results in wind turbines, organic food and solar cells. Of course our orientation to alternate energy and the environment and our social concerns will remain the same.  It is too bad that similar opportunities have not been identified in the United States.

       Cape Wind Permitting Takes Time  Believe it or not, it's been two years since Cape Wind Associates applied to the US Army Corps of Engineers to build a windfarm in Nantucket Sound.  And as this article,   Wind Backers Impatient As Corps Takes Its Time , Edward Maroney, Barnstable Patriot (10/31/03) reports, project supporters are beginning to grow impatient.  For example, the issue of delays was mentioned by Seth Kaplan, senior attorney for the Conservation Law Foundation, in an Oct. 20 letter to District Engineer Col. Thomas Koning that was signed by numerous other environmental organizations. The letter asks that a timetable for approval of the draft and final EIS documents be set as soon as possible, noting that an announced completion date of the draft EIS of early 2003 has already slipped. "This slippage undermines the credibility of the process and drains the energy and resources of the members of the public who are intensely interested in this review.," the letter states.  The Corps takes responsibility for the pace of the process, trying to evaluate neutrally whether or not to issue a permit for the project.

       Alternatives Announced for Cape Wind  This press release,   Corps Announces Alternatives to Be Reviewed in Windfarm EIS , Yahoo, 10/29/2003 discusses the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' announcement of  the list of alternative sites that will need to be investigated as part of the Cape Wind windfarm Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).   According to the article, originally 17 sites were identified by the public and federal, state and local agencies.  The Corps then screened those sites based on five criteria: availability of renewable energy (i.e. wind power classification); ISO New England grid connection availability (connection point, transmission/distribution lines, efficiency/capacity); available land or water area; engineering constraints (constructability, geotechnical conditions, water depths); and legal/regulatory constraints (i.e. endangered species, shipping channels, etc.).   Based on this analysis, the alternatives proposed include an onshore alternative at the Massachusetts Military Reservation on Cape Cod, Mass.; three shallow water alternatives -- the applicant's preferred alternative of Horseshoe Shoal, and also Tuckernuck Shoal, and Hankerchief Shoal, Mass.; and the combined locations are New Bedford Harbor, Mass., and a reduced footprint at Horseshoe Shoal. The area south of Tuckernuck Island, Mass., will serve as a deep-water site.

       On Shore Plants Prove Controversial in Britain  In the United States, onshore wind farms have been developed for nearly twenty years with little controversy - while recent offshore proposals like Cape Wind have generated opposition.  In Britain, it's different - at least according to this  report  by Juliette Jowit, The Observer 10/26/03. According to the article,  plans for massive expansion of wind farms on British land are threatened by public protest - causing the government to urge that public funding be concentrated on supporting off-shore wind turbines and more futuristic wave and tidal power.

       OTEC Coming to India?  This  article   of 12/4/03 reports that the one MW ocean thermal power project designed by the National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) with technical inputs from Saga University of Japan, at Tuticorin is likely to be commissioned early next year. The project envisages generation of power from the difference in seawater temperature at a depth of 1000 meters and on the surface.  The project at Tuticorin is only a demonstration project. The technology can be commercialised by setting up all weather power generation units. But it may take years to reach that stage.  NIOT has already set up a small demonstration project (55 kw) to generate power from wave energy in the Kerala coast. The project was initiated by ITT, Madras and then taken over by NIOT.

       Wind Power for Cornell University  As a Cornell Law School alum, I was pleased to come across this article,    Wind Power At Cornell?  ,  Shannon Brescher, Cornell Sun (11/25/03).   According to the article, back in October the environmental activist group Kyoto Now! launched their new campaign, Wind Power Now! with a goal of building a Cornell-owned wind farm in Ithaca that will supply ten percent of the University's energy. This wind farm will either have two or seven wind turbines, depending on their power output.  For now, the administration is backing the newest effort so far. Originally, they said that building a wind farm wouldn't be possible because of legal concerns as a non-profit.   But after Carleton College in Minnesota built a wind farm, Lanny Joyce '81, manager of engineering, planning and energy management in the department of utilities and energy management, agreed to the idea.

According to the article, the proposal would likely involve leasing space at Pier 2 and another 30 acres for assembly and staging, starting in the summer of 2005. Cape Wind has also expressed interest in using Quonset's rail lines and airport, in addition to the port.  Geoffrey Grout, economic manager for Quonset Park was quoted as saying "It's a sensible and profitable proposal," Grout said. "And it [would mean] a couple of million dollars in rental space and about 500 jobs."

       Plans for More British Wind Energy Projects Announced  This  link   offers an update on the second round of offshore wind farm developments in the UK (1/5/04):  The Crown Estate has recently announced its licensed sites for the second round of offshore wind farm developments. These sites represent fifteen projects, representing between 5.4 and 7.2 GW of new wind power capacity.  According to the British Wind Energy Associations website, the farms will generate enough power for 4 million homes, or one in six of UK households. In terms of interest to the recreational boater, this equates to 1800 - 2400 turbines based on a 3MW turbine currently being installed or assuming technology is able to increase turbine capacity to 5 MW turbines, this would mean 1080-1480 turbines being installed.  The sites are limited to the three strategic areas around the UK - the Thames Estuary, the Greater Wash and Liverpool Bay.

       More Wave Energy Innovation in the US  This article,   Innovator's Undersea Energy Source Attracts Navy, Others   (12/11/2003) reports on  Herb Williams, a Palatka, Fla., dock builder and former Alaskan crab boat skipper, whose small company wants to sink a network of innovative turbines he has designed - think of a giant fan with a hole in the center where the hub should be - deep into the Gulf Stream off the coast of South Florida.  If it works - still a big question - the machines would convert the relentless flow of that undersea river into a more valuable kind of current.  In July, a British company installed a turbine to tap current while other European and American companies are developing systems to tap tides, waves and currents.  But additional tests are needed.  According to the article, Williams also drawn interest from the Navy and hopes to sign a contract with the Navy to help construct a full-scale prototype, with blades 106 feet in diameter, for testing off the coast.  Williams has also applied for the first federal permit (editor's note -  Williams apparently applied to the Corps of Engineers though  FERC has asserted jurisdiction   over ocean energy permitting) for what he envisions as seven "energy fields" stretching from Miami to Vero Beach, Fla., with an array of 500 generators. The review could take a year.  And the cost of building a prototype could cost around $2 million which means that it may be awhile before the first wave or current energy project comes on line. John Chorlog, an assistant director for Miami-Dade's Water and Sewer Department, said Williams would have to supply

       Is the Oil Industry Ready for A Rigs-to-Wind Program?  There's already a  Rigs-to-Reefs  program where abandoned oil rigs remain and serve as underwater reefs for fish and marine life.  How about rigs-to-wind where decommissioned oil platforms might house wind turbines? That's definitely a possibility on the horizon as discussed in  Turbines may offer option for oil rigs , Richard Burgess,  The Advertiser   (12/29/03).  As the article reports, engineer Herman Schellstede has a vision of wind turbines, 25 stories high dotting the Gulf of Mexico, providing pollution-free power to coastal Louisiana.  The plan, he said, is to place the turbines on abandoned oil drilling platforms in the windy areas off the coast - a possible boon for the oil industry because regulations require that rigs in federal waters have to be torn down when not in use.  And as noted in the previous post, the state’s Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities, announced this month that it plans to study the possibility of putting wind turbines on offshore platforms.     Still many are skeptical about the possibility, including high costs, how to transport power to shore and where to use it.   But  PSC Commissioner Foster Campbell isn' amongst the nay-sayers:  "I’m not looking for a lot of pessimism saying it won’t work. I want to know how to make it work,” the article quotes Campbell as saying.  “It’s worked in other parts of the country. Why not Louisiana?”

       Louisiana Public Service Commission Interested in Offshore Wind  From News Briefs of  Nola.com  (12/21/03) comes  this brief  : The Louisiana Public Service Commission will study the feasibility of generating electricity from wind turbines installed on dormant oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. Commissioner Foster Campbell of Bossier City brought the idea to the PSC at its monthly meeting Wednesday in Baton Rouge. Lafayette conservationist and businessman Harold Schoeffler briefed the commission on the concept. He said wind energy is expanding in offshore locations in Europe and the United States and on land in Texas and California. Commissioners asked Schoeffler to educate the PSC and staff on the potential for offshore wind energy. Campbell said jobs in construction and other fields could be generated, and the power could be cheaper for ratepayers. PSC staff and Louisiana utility officials recently attended a conference organized by Schoeffler in Lafayette at which representatives of GE Wind Energy discussed using offshore oil platforms to erect wind turbines.

       More Debate Over Wind Turbine Impacts on Birds   Wind energy may be clean but it's not completely benign, at least according to some of the information from this article   Peril in the Wind Industry: Turbines That Produce Clean Energy Also Kill Migrating Birds  , Kimberly Edds,  Washington Post   (12/24/03) .   According to Edd's report, scientists estimate that as many as 44,000 birds have been killed over the past twenty years at the Altamont Pass wind farms.   Apparently, the area is within the migration route of many predatory birds, whose focus on ground prey causes them to fly into the fast-spinning blades.   As a result of the experience at Altamont, wind power has had problems with environmental groups who have claimed that the wind industry is not doing enough to stop avian mortality.  But is Altamont an accurate baseline for measuring bird deaths in the wind industry.  As the article continues:   Altamont was constructed in the early 1980s when little was known about the migration patterns of birds in nearby areas. Mistakes made at Altamont have been used to make improvements in new wind farms. No other wind farm in the United States comes close to the bird mortality rates at Altamont because of improved windmill design for newer farms. The industry says similar updates for Altamont would be too costly.  There's also confusion about what to do to mitigate the problem.  The article describes that:  past attempts to reduce bird kills have included painting the tips of turbine blades to try to make them more visible to birds, installing screens around generators and putting devices to discourage perching on the towers.  But those measures have failed to substantially lower the number of bird deaths. Among the measures now being discussed is letting the grass beneath the turbines grow taller and removing nearby rock to provide more cover for prey and discourage birds from flying in the area.  "There is no universal agreement what the exact right thing to do is," Stengel said, noting that a few years ago the recommendation was to build rock piles near the turbines. Now the recommendation is the opposite.    The number of birds killed at Altamont seem high - but they don't tell everything.  I'd be interested in knowing, for example, how bird kills at Altamont compare to the number of birds killed at airports or by skyscrapers.  I'd also be interested in seeing the rate at which the numbers have declined over the years.  Finally, what would be the substitute for wind power - a natural gas plant?  More fossil fuel generation? Surely these sources also have adverse impacts - and not just on birds but on humans also.

       The Cape Wind Projects from A Danish Perspective   How's a wind farm opponent to respond when the developer brings a visitor from Denmark to expound on the benefits of offshore wind?  By finding another Dane with a more critical view of offshore wind.  As reported in   Shift on the wind: Second Danish expert offers opposing views on Nantucket Sound project's feasibility  , David Kibbe,  Cape Cod Online.com  (12/20/03), opponents of the Cape Wind Project brought Cresten Anderson, an outspoken critic of the projects in  Denmark, to the Massachusetts Statehouse to offer his perspective on the projects.  Here's what he said:  [First], the Horns Rev project [the largest offshore windfarm in the world] does not offer a fair comparison to what is being proposed by Cape Wind.  "It's two completely different kinds of tourism that you have there," Anderson said yesterday.  Among his criticisms, Anderson said it was misguided to compare the North Sea resort area to Cape Cod and the islands.  "Cape Cod is a place where you go down, you have a lot of wind surfing and sailing," he said. "The North Sea, where Blavandshuk is located, you can go 20 feet out into the water, then you can't go any further, because of the undercurrents, and there are pitfalls in the water. You don't go swimming. You don't really go sailing, either. There's a lot of wind. It's really, really dangerous."  Anderson also said the Danish wind farm was not economical, due to high government subsides and a low rate of return on energy. He said the money would be better spent cleaning up power plants in Eastern Europe.

       Massachusetts Ocean Task Force Hears Mostly About Wind  The Massachusetts Ocean Management Task Force has been attempting to create a comprehensive plan for use of state waters - but its efforts at a broad plan have been  complicated by the public's more narrow focus on one issue:  the Cape Wind Farm.  As reported in  State ocean management group gets an earful  ,  Evan J. Albright  Barnstable Patriot , (12/19/03), the Task Force released a preliminary list of  ">Draft Principles  which would serve as the basis for future ocean management laws and policies.  But at the first of five scheduled public hearings, the audience's comments primarily concerned the Cape Wind project, notwithstanding Task Co-Chair Jim Hunt's statements that the task force's goals were not to examine specific projects or to address matters involving federal waters (where the Cape Wind turbines will be located).  The audience was "equal opportunity" in ignoring Hunt's efforts to limit the scope of the meeting.   Although backers of the wind farm project said the task force meeting was not the appropriate forum for discussing it,  they also said that if the Task Force Report mentioned Cape Wind then it should include recommendations and principles promoting such projects. Those who opposed the wind farm believed that it was incumbent upon the task force to recommend "closing the doughnut" and thereby encourage the state to seek control over the project.  As for other criticism of the Task Force report, Steve Tucker, a coastal resources specialist quesitoned how the recommendations would be implemented while Patrick Paquette, president of the Massachusetts Striped Bass Coalition and a member of several other organizations devoted to recreational fishermen, criticized the report as being guided by insiders rather than the public.  He also complained that the public comment period fell far short of the 90 days typically provided by state law for review of new rules and practices.

The research will include the development of cost-effective Wave Energy Converters (WEC) in New Zealand to generate electricity, a four year project to be lead by Industrial Research Limited.  As the Press Release states: Wave power is a potentially important renewable resource and the researchers estimate that New Zealand's near-shore wave energy exceeds the current electricity consumption by over 40 times. The WEC design will include novel gearless conversion and "smart technology" adaptive control. This technology has the potential to achieve a breakthrough in electricity generation from renewable resources and capture key intellectual property for New Zealand. The National Institute for Atmosphere and Water (NIWA) and Wellington-based company Power Projects Limited will play vital roles in the programme.

       Wave Powered Desalination Plant Goes Online In India  This article,  India's first desalination unit becomes operational near Vizhinjam  (1/13/04) reports on the start of operation of India's first tidal power run deslination plant.  According to the article, the plant has a capacity to produce 8000 liters of "quality drinking water" a day.  Due to seasonal variations in the wave energy, the tidal project could not regularly contribute power to the grid. It was in this stage, the scientists chalked out a novel idea of running a desalination plant with the help of tidal energy.

       Ocean Management Task Force Makes Recommendations for Ocean Zones  The Massachusetts Ocean Management Task Force is ready to make recommendations on zoing the ocean and uses according to this Boston Globe article,   State panel to recommend zoning ocean and its uses , (March 23, 2004).  Following a comment period of at least 30 days, the committee will consider submission of draft legislation.   Other components of the plan in addition to the recommended legislation include (1) directing Massachusetts to better map the seafloor and establish an inventory of uses and resources and (2) encouraging cooperation between the state and federal government in managing waters and fish species, which do not abide by the imaginary boundary line between state and federal waters. Task force have equated their proposal with the comprehensive planning and management schemes that go on in the vast public lands of the West.

       Ocean Commission Releases Preliminary Report - With Chapter on Offshore Renewables  For those who follow the development of offshore renewables, there's an important document just out that you don't want to miss:  the  chapter on offshore energy development  contained in the  Preliminary Report   just issued by the  Ocean Commission .  The Ocean Commission is an executive body appointed by the president pursuant to the Oceans Act of 2000.    With respect to renewables, the Report provides a good overview of the current competing and disparate state of regulation for different offshore technologies.  The report recommends creation of some type of comprehensive ocean management body which would, among other things, implement more coordinated and consistent regulation for offshore renewables to promote development.  The report also endorses some type of fee system so that the federal government and adjacent states would receive a "fair return" from offshore renewables development.  The report solicits comments, with a deadline set for May 21, 2004.  Absent from the report is how a new regime would affect existing offshore proposas like  Cape Wind  which is now under review by the Corps of Engineers or the  AquaEnergy Group's  proposed Makah Bay Wave Energy Project, now undergoing licensing at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  These issues will likely be fleshed out in more detail in the comment process.  This   article  reports on the Ocean Commission's report and in particular, the potential impacts on the Cape Wind project.

       Another Wave Energy Company Goes Forward  This article,   Company wants to explore using the sea to generate electricity  (April 23, 2004) reports on a Minnesota company, Independent Natural Resources that seeks to use floating pumps in the ocean to push water through pipelines to a reservoir to power turbines for electric power production.   A test pump is being contemplated for the coast of Northern California and if successful, the company would then set up a small-scale flotilla of 16 pumps connected to a 750-kilowatt power production facility for testing over six to 12 months.

       Turkey to Investigate and Invest in Offshore Renewables   Here's an article from, of all places,  Al Jazeera  that reports that   Turkey will invest in utilising wind energy . (April 14, 2004). As the article reports, having secured World Bank backing, Turkey has now decided to make a half billion dollar investment in wind and wave power:  With more than 8000km of coastline, and many of its coastal regions enjoying constant breezes, Turkey appears to be a natural candidate for renewable energy projects.  And Turkey has another incentive to invest in renewables as well:  The European Union has set a target of 12 percent of member state's energy needs being met by alternative power sources by 2010 and wind and wave project can help Turkey comply with that goal.

       Results Begin to Come in on EPRI/E2i Wave Energy Assessment  As mentioned in a couple of posts below,  urlLink EPRI  and  urlLink E2i  have sponsored a wave energy assessment for four different states. A discussion of the reason for the proposed assessment as well as the methodologies used to evaluate the resource can be found  urlLink here  . In the meantime, some of the preliminary results are beginning to return such as the  urlLink Pre-Release Draft - E21 EPRI Survey and Characterization of Potential offshore wave energy sites in Washington  , George Hagerman, (May 2004). Other results can be seen in this June 2004 presentation by George Hagermant entitled  urlLink Overview of US Wave Energy Resource .

       Some "Light" Offshore Wind Energy Reading  OK, so I lied in the headline.  urlLink These articles  in the Boston College Environmental Affairs Journal, Vol. 31, No. 2 (2004) on issues like the Cape Wind permitting process, regulatory uncertainty and property rights on the Outer Continental Shelf aren't exactly light reading, weighed down as they are with hundreds of footnotes per article. But each piece provides a great overview, replete with statutory and case citations, on offshore wind issues such as uncertainties related to regulatory authority and property rights, where to strike the balance between going forward with permitting and awaiting congressional intervention and ways to manage the permit process and accomodate all stakeholders.   Although the pieces are more descriptive than prescriptive in that they tell where we've been and don't necessarily advocate where we ought to go, they're important educational reading for policy makers and others interested in the offshore development debate.

       Wave Energy For San Francisco?  Looks like wave power will get some scrutiny in San Francisco in September as reported in this article,  urlLink Wave Power Plan Gets A Test  , SFGate.com (8/4/04). In September, San Francisco is co-hosting a conference on wave energy projects.  And as this article,  City Turning the Tides   describes, a project has been proposed near the Golden Gate Bridge using technology by Hydro-Venturi.  In addition, as the SFGate.com article continues, California will also serve as the site of the Seadog planned for Humboldt, California's "remote and battered" coast:    Mark Thomas, the founder and president of Independent Natural Resources, said the Seadog evolved from a related energy production device that drove a motor by using the compressed air that is routinely fed into pipelines to move natural gas from one location to another. Bolstered by $270,000 in venture capital, Thomas plans to have a single unit installed off the Humboldt coast by the end of the year to demonstrate the essential feasibility of the technology in the real marine world. The project must be approved by the California Coastal Commission and the State Lands Commission.  Of course, this article is not entirely accurate.  As we reported  way back in this post  , the  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission   asserted licensing jurisdiction over wave energy projects back in February 2003 in the  Aqua Energy   decision.  FERC's licensing authority preempts the states to some extent; for example, a FERC license relieves a developer of the need to obtain a certificate of public necessity and convenience from a state utility commission.  And where state proposed measures for protection and enhancement of fishery and wildlife resources conflict with those deemed appropriate by FERC, FERC's provisions will prevail.    FERC has licensing jurisdiction over river based hydro so it may not be the optimal agency to regulate ocean based projects - but as the law currently stands, it nonetheless has that authority.  States - and most others in the ocean energy community - have been slow to realize that FERC has interposed itself into the licensing game and may avoid the FERC process to their detriment.

       Some Support for Wave Energy from Rhode Island  Here's a nice editorial,  urlLink Waves of clean energy  from the  urlLink Providence Journal  (8/3/2004) which advocates additional federal support for state efforts to make wave energy a reality in the US. Currently, the Department of Energy does not fund any ocean energy programs. Despite lack of federal support, states are moving ahead. A Maine advisory committee recently chose the Scottish Ocean Power Delivery for a pilot demonstration in 2006 along the state's southern coast. And the clean-energy funds of Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut intend to provide as much as $1.5 million to Australian Tom Denniss to build a device off Rhode Island's Point Judith.

       Wave Energy for Maine?  This article,  urlLink Maine May Test Hydroelectric Power Project  , (Associated Press - 7/27/04) reports that Maine is considering a wave energy project possibly for Old Orchard Beach area. The  urlLink Electricity Innovation Institute  and the  urlLink Electric Power Research Institute  in Palo Alto, Calif., recently completed a study that examined coastal communities in Maine, Hawaii, Washington and Oregon to see which towns would be fit best. As the article reports:   The study found that wave-energy devices in Maine could be built in Portland, then installed and connected to the power grid in the waters off Old Orchard Beach. The town was chosen because there is a substation located close to shoreline and a planned upgrade to the power distribution system.  James Atwell, a board member of the Maine Technology Institute, which provided a $60,000 grant for the project, said the choice was based on the results of a "very early stage feasibility study."  "Before any project were constructed, there would be the need for public involvement and some kind of permitting," he said. "You'd need to get the fisheries people involved."

       Cape Wind Plows Ahead   Cape Wind, the first major offshore wind farm proposed for the US continues to move forward. As this article,  urlLink Corps denies Romney's bid to delay release of wind farm impact report , David Kibbe,  urlLink Cape Cod Online  (7/31/04) reports, the Corps will not delay the release of the draft environmental report to allow Massachusetts to clarify the scope of its jurisdcition over the project. A month prior, the First Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling in  urlLink TEN TAXPAYER CITIZENS GROUP; CAPE COD MARINE TRADES ASSOCIATION, INC.; RAOUL D. ROSS; THE MASSACHUSETTS BOATING AND YACHT CLUBS ASSOCIATION, INC.,  , Docket No. 03-2323 (June 28, 2004) finding that federal law preempts the state of Massachusetts from exercising permitting jurisdiction over outer-continental shelf (OCS) lands in the Nantucket Sound where the project will be sited. OCS lands begin roughly three miles from shore - and according to his July 26 letter to the Corps, Massachusetts Governor Romney described that he was seeking to clarify whether certain rock formations near shore would extend the state's jurisdiction into the footprint of the wind farm.

       UK Continues to Fund Wave Energy  According to this  article   (8/3/04), the UK government has announced funding of £50m for wave and tidal stream energy, in the biggest show of support for the emerging renewable technology to date.  The move follows recent criticism from various quarters claiming that the UK renewables sector is unfairly balanced in favour of wind energy, a scenario that is stifling the development of other clean power sources.  By comparison, the US currently has $0 devoted to renewable energy development - a situation that will hopefully be alleviated by the pending energy bill.  If not, the US will likely continue to lag behind other countries in the ocean energy arena.

       Scotland to Examine Wave Energy in the US  Given that the US has done little to exploit potential wave resources in the United States, businesses abraod may try to capitalize on the resources, as reported in   Scots firm on crest of American wave , Perry Gourley,   Scotsman , 7/11/04.  Recently, a US government backed study on wave energy judged Ocean Power Delivery as one of the best wavepower groups, thus paving the way for the company to break into the US market with its Pelamis device.  The wave energy assessment was carried out by the Electric Power Research Institute and  E2i  , a US government and industry agency and examined wave potential in four states.
