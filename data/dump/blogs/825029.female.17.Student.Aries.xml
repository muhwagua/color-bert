      Could I be the governor of Charles' Universe State?  That would be really cool.  I wouldn't require anyone to go to school because I understand that there's never any time to just relax, have sex, play snake, or even watch Donnie Darko for that matter.  So vote for me!  Melissa Nieves for Governor!

      dude you know what omg Charles' Universe is so much better than the real universe.  Lets annex it to the USA, and take out Texas, accordingly.  I would be a proud member of Charles' Universe State.

      yowza! this is a disco blog....By disco, i mean good disco. Now, the word disco is not used as a noun, but as an adjective for things that are either cheap and ghetto, or so bombaciously cool that there isnt another word to describe it. in this case, i would have to go with descriptin B. SHYEAH

      Its 1 AM, time for a cool song alert!  I've had this band's albums on my computer for a while, but I just started listening to 'em.  They're like Drowning Pool, they're called Ultraspank.  Personally I'm not too fond of the songs with excessive screaming just because its harder to sing along :) buuuut, the song "Stuck" by Ultraspank isn't very screamy so if you want to listen to them check it out.  I can send some stuff too you guys if you want. [  urlLink click!  ]

      This has been one of the worst weeks EVER.  But it's finally over. This weekend is looking like:    Friday  - no practice.  Go out and get away from home, school, and anything else bad.   Saturday  - Playoff game, then theres this... party for some rich guy that martin wants me to play at with some other ppl.  Maybe ill get a $5 blockbuster gift card!!!  After that, find a reason not to go home.   Sunday  - *sigh* im thinking im going to see harry potter  THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS  (oooooooooooOOOOOOOO scary lightning and music) with my mom and hopefully an unfortunate friend i can sucker into going.  On second thought i might go and like it.  We're doing nothing in computer science right now and im hungry ... for love ;-)  oh!  i just remembered.  one time when i was... 9 i think... some friends and I were playing with someone's dad's golf club (i remember it being a 9 iron, but back then thats the only golf club we knew about so maybe it wasn't) and we were hitting these nuts and rocks we found on the ground cause we ran out of golf balls.  This kid i really didn't like (he was a lot older, like 12, and he always made fun of me and pushed me around) was standing behind me.  So i took a back swing and bashed him in the face.  It was totally an accident but i was almost glad i hit him.  After i hit him i hit the rock over a house -- a beautiful shot -- and then noticed him bent over crying with blood all over his face.  I broke his nose and there was blood everywhere.  It was great. Also, when i was 5 we were in recess and an older kid (6 or 7) made my best friend get off the jungle gym thingy but my friend didn't want to so the older kid punched him and pushed him around.  I got angry and punched the boy in the throat and that was that. A bit violent, but i was just thinking of some precious childhood memories.  Dodododo....  I guess thats it.  Lunch is soon and i hafta do this worksheet. Im crossing my fingers for a great weekend... maybe  yyyyyyyyoooooooooouuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu  can help me there.  you all have to be happy and have a lot of fun. I, Charles Ayen McTygue III command it be so (more scary lightning).

      Wee for copy and paste...  [begin paste from Habibi]  Guess what, I get pretty much two weeks of thanksgiving break, what about you? *evil grin*. As soon as I finish that challenge project (grr) and make up that challenge ap essay (grr some more), the rest of the tri is downhill for me...now just a matter of finishing those two things. Today was a fairly good day...started off with challenge and we watched a movie. Calculus was calculus I guess, not too bad just went over another section. Lunch was fun like always....Chemistry...ugh I HATE that class, cuz the teacher can't teach, we have to learn everything on our own, makes me mad. Then lab management, man thats an easy blowoff class...Oh yea, can't forget that detention in lab management today. Whats that you say? How can I possibly get a detention in lab managemet? I'll tell ya....so we had this sub on thursday and friday, and apparently right from the start he didn't like me. They were taking the test, and he told me to get ready for it and I said I was just the lab assistant, so he goes "So why aren't YOU handing out these papers?"...as if I'm suppose to psychically know to do HIS job...so I think I *might* have given him a weird look on accident....but I still handed out the stuff nonetheless because its not like I'm going to say no......thanks mr sub. Then, on Friday, I asked if I could go to Calculus for some "calculus tutoring"....ok so what if I was really going to go play chess with the other multivariable calculus people, I still said calculus tutoring :) He said yea thats fine, so with about 20 mins left in class I came back, walked around the room a little bit, then saw a table playing cards, so I joined in for the rest of the period. Monday, I come back, first thing I hear from Murphy (physics teacher) is that I got a detention for the following: refusing to help the sub, skipping half of class, then playing cards when I got back. And Murphy showed me the note and thats EXACTLY what it said....what the crap. Yea so that sucked. Oh anyways back to my day (yea I'm almost done). So afterwards Mooney, Melissa and I all go to starbucks...they go for tutoring, I just kinda chatted once in a while but I tried to sleep most the time :) Afterwards, we just drove around a bit, then went home and I ate dinner and did some stuff then here I am typing this huge blog! Speaking of huge blog, this is tiring my hands, I think I'm gonna stop now....if anyone is still reading this far lol.  Until our paths next cross...   Habibi  [/end paste]

      Yeah!  my predictions held true.  Although, i didnt get a $5 blockbuster gift card hehe.  Sidenote--Melissa.  thats all i gotta say cause putting in little adjectives would take away from the greatness that is melissa.  And... yep, saw harry potter.. it was ok.  no more no less really.  I just wish harry would grow some balls, be less of a Freddy from scooby doo and more of a Matilda from Matilda...  u know, he took the attitude of "lets go into the spooky place unprepared for anything and pick the least violent way to deal with it all"  when he should have blown stuff up with his magic fireball spells.  o well.  not much else to say other than thatttt.. overall, the weekend certainly was a weekend.  i think ill leave now cause the site has been sitting here for too long and i dont want to try to think to write any more.  thats right.  it is.  right. mhm. yep. k then ok gonna leave k byebye latar.

      Hey, way to not update your blogs guys, so Habibi's gotta do the mass update for you all...  Well, I don't know about most of you, but I've had a nice vacation so far.  If I wasn't at home doing something cool (which is never, there's nothing cool to do at my house), I was out with all the cool band people! Yeeeaaaaaaaa....anyways.....tuesday was my birthday, happy birthday me (finally old enough to be a junior, wtf).  Apparently Melissa got me something, she said she went to the mall, saw something that she just HAD to get, and she has the nerve to not tell me what it is or how much it cost, gah...and I have to wait aaaaaaaaall the way until Friday :(  Well I can't wait to see what it is...should be interesting.  Guess what sucks?  On the day after Thanksgiving, I get to be at work at 8 in the morning! Now I don't think it can get any better than that...oh wait...it can!  I have to be there until 2!  Well at least afterwards we're gonna hang out at like speed zone or whatever.  Also, if you guys wanted to do something on Saturday also, I work 11-3.  You guys should visit me more, that way I get more chances to tell you all off...bwa hahahaha.  omg I got a webcam, its pretty cool, although it doesn't take very good quality pictures, it gets the job done.  First picture I took was me flipping off the GameStop logo on my shirt...tells you how I feel about working :)  Anyways, not much else to say, so peace  [  urlLink lissahmee  ] | [  urlLink behkkah  ]  -Habibi has spoken

      well hello there! here i am updating charles's blog.  because he's so cool and his blog is the greatest ever, i've decided to update it instead of mine.  boy, it's been so long since i've updated a blog that i almost couldn't remember my password.  but have no fear, i soon remembered it.  so yeah, i don't have lunch with charles (which sucks) and i have d lunch, when i'm used to a, so i was STARVING today.  but it was a pretty good day overall.  i had mock auditions after school.... mr rankin had some quite helpful comments, including "good!" and "good job!".  *sigh* wheres the constructive criticism when you need it.... oh well dododo- i really wish it was still thanksgiving break... or actually, i wish it was christmas break.  i was not ready at all to go back to school this morning.  but i guess you gotta do what you gotta do. going to the mormon church tomorrow!!! yay for getting up early :) alllllright, thats all for now! bye bye

      none of us choose our personalities or really the things we do at all ever.  because... we are totally the product of our environments.  the slightest touch or change in temperature as a child begins a giant chain reaction of how we react to things around us which then creates a change in the world around us inflicted by us... accelerating the cycle.  so, we cant be blamed for our actions or thoughts, we have absolutely no say in them because our thoughts themselves were originally sparked from a sereis of actions inflicted on us...  but if we can not judge each other... there is really nothing.  the universe exists only by itself like our trust in currency... it has no backing to it... no underlying truth... just the statement that it has been created and therefore it exists.  so then... if everything can be traced back to being the product of another action, it must trace back to one action the unmoved mover... the uncreated creater.  you all think its some some sort of consious being... like we are... idiots...out of the endless possibilities in the fucking universe... you cant even imagine infinity or half of infinity or what the damn word really means no less the word you so readily use, GOD.  i understand youre just trying to explain things in some way that you can understand but honestly its gone too far.  its a good idea but come on.  you cant tell me that the entire universe...one which is beyond our comprehension... im not just talking about the fucking stars and planets here...more like the universe that is totally infinite... that lies not only beyond tour planet and the stars and such we can see for an infinite amount of time and space to the extent where time and space are non existant but replaced by things that we cant describe... but also infinitely small inside of our own minds and inside an atom of lets say... carbon.  you just... cannot tell me that everything is all summed up in the word God.  It makes me suicidal genocidal it blows my mind to the point of *Screams* i dont know... but.... hell.  my God is not some fucking being that is anywhere near our comprehension.  people believe that somehow the concept of God can somehow be contained in our minds.  and also with little effort.  i hate you people.  and i hate myself for being one of you.  hell... the word hate doesnt even have any meaning... your rules your God and Jesus... the most important things in your lives... encompass nearly nothing of the big picture.  there is no satisfying the greed and pride of man.  he believes he can explain and know all things... you can never know God that is the fucking definition of God.  The one thing that created(s) all things...that encompasses all things... shit im talking too much.  this started off in my profile but i ran out of room and i havent updated my blog in forever so... could you just please accept the possibility that you have no fucking clue??? there are so many possibilities you just... throw to the wind for your "God"  if the God you speak of is the one you believe to be the most important thing in existance... its but a speck on the map. ill stop talking about God... its not really religious, its a concept that affects us all because we cannot deny it.  however you want to think of God it is there.  even if you think we are all there is and science rules all or anything... all being and existence itself is included in "God" so to disprove God you must disprove your own existence which is impossible.   anyway... my original point was that... if we cannot choose our personalities and actions truly since we are product of things beyond our control, how can we be held accountable for anything?  we really.. cant.  but we still judge each other and kill each other etc.  i mean... there is really nothing that is truly bad.  Something that we view as wrong is just... sure it may be painful but what is pain? what is sadness? they are no more than imaginary feelings within the confines of our material bodies.  bad and good are both... just... different things.  just because they are... "dangerous to the preservation of life and happiness" etc... doesnt make them... "bad" in the eyes of all things combined.  they are just unwanted by us.  make up a believe creature in your mind that enjoys all the things we hate, and then try to prove that the people you see around you are different or more real than the creature you created.  they arent.  just because the creature you created in your mind does not affect you physically and directly as other "real" people do, does not make it less real.  just because you cant see it doesnt mean it doesnt exist, i guess is what im trying to say.  ok im gonna stop... i just wanted to bring up the point that we are all the same damn person, just under different cirumstances.  we have different sized heads, brains, hair color, texture, skin color, birth place, customs, etc.  so next time you judge someone or label them, just remember thats you.    you are condemning yourself as other you's have condemned you.  just give it thought and maybe our race will progress a little.  and eventually somehow rise above what we are... and maybe we will someday accept our futility and yet intricate importance without squandering our thoughts on such simple ideas and terms as we do daily... for the sake of "happiness"  you are me and i am you. cool huh? sorry for the typos, i was writing in black on black. --words of charles.  just as useless or important as any others...

      hey! im updating cause melissa told me to. heh theres really not much to say but ill try really hard.... hmmmmm region band was today....... it really sucked.  seems like pretty much everyone hated it except for the ppl going to state cause they found it a small price to pay... at least thats how i would look at it were i going to state...  yeah, im being a baby about it and it still bothers me.  even though its not really that big of a deal and all that other crap... i really wanted to go and... well... the guy sitting next to me who beat me at area couldnt play the freaking music and i was nailing almost everything............ he couldnt count rests for gods sake.  truthfully he wasnt terrible or even that bad but... he just wasnt anything special at all, and... i dont think state really means much to him in the first place... at least from the way he talked...  ok forget about that heh after the whole region torture thing we went to ihop which was umnacious.   hm really not much else interesting to say.  i have lots of hw projects and such... and im still failing precal and have a really low C in physics...which i hate because of ms murphy. blah school is badness.  congrats to all who have good grades  dododododo...  oh! im 17 now! yay.  that doesnt mean much i can see R movies and dont have a curfew except i still have to be home whenever my mom sez.  lol its depressing how even my birthday was just another day heh.  i guess its no big deal. yay for 17 ...stuff.  ok! thats all i think.  ill see you next update which will be pretty dang far away im guessing.  hehe. later.

      hey.  time for another update cause i dont have anything better to do.  i can get better at my blind typing skills too.  nothing is going on right now.  the world is pretty boring.  but!  im determined to fix that, so maybe sometime soon when i feel a little healthier ill get off my lazy butt and do something a little out of the ordinary for fun.  just... anything to shake things up... huh.  school is still the bane of everything i mostly just wanted to say the word bane... bane. stoopid school what did it ever do for us other than secure our easy path through life since we are lucky enough to be considered minors and be taken care of 24/7  buuuutttt...... it still suxxxxxxx!!!!!!!!!!! hm other than school and home and... ppl and friends thats all there is in life right now.  kinda stinx cause i cant think of much else in the world to look forward to out there...hm. maybe i can make my goal in life money and monotary gain.  or maybe ill just base my success in life on a secure job and a family with 2.5 children a nd a minivan going to school meetings which is basically... just reaffirming the same boring life-cycle ive had so far, except i get to support another generation's passage.... blah blah blah jibberish. dododododododododododo ok.  im going to fix the boringness. NOW! help me out ppls!  i know all none of you who are reading this want just as much as i do to vanquish the bordom....thing. ok so starting right now.... yeah. ok. go!!!! ummmm i dont have anything else to say.  as always i start writing in here as if theres something interesting to say but now i just want to wrap it up cause i dont have anything interesting to say any more.  so!  im goin to a study thing for precal cause precal is a bich with no t cause bich means generosity or something like that. heh i dont even really want to publish this in my blog but i will anywayzzz so!  ill talk to you... people... later i shupposhe.  gl wif lyf.  urs truly

      what is the one thing you want most when you are in a bad mood and are angry at something or just sad/mad at life?  seriously, tell me what it is and dont ask me what i want cause ill just feel selfish until i hear yours.  anyway ummm this week has started off with bad weather and shit classes.  i spent about 7.5 hours last night doing a GT project where we made a video that was a pain in the ass and i dont think it was worth it but whatever. now, we had a sub for physix when we were supposed to take a test and do 2 labs and do 4 computer simulations.  we also have hw and to read the next chapter.  But now, since she wasnt here today and we have TAKS tomorrow our test will be on wednesday which was the day we were supposed to do our boats which were also due.  then our planes are due the next day........?  but the next day would be friday which we have off..... i hate school not just... like... taylor griffin kind of hate where she just says it because she has something wrong with her mind and she needs to make a statement because otherwise no one pays attention to her because she is not interesting.... i actually hate it.  it is... the compilation of all the teachers and how none of them seem to give a shit about anyone because obviously we dont have any sort of... "other classes" or "lives" fuckers. im gonna stop writing cause its stupid and i dont care.

      Yay!!  I'm updating this because Charles is lazy and won't do it himself.  : )  Okay, so here's a recap on Charles's day! He woke up. He got ready. He went to school. He was bored after school in the band hall. He went home. He got online. He talked to me. He ate dinner. And that brings us up to date.  Was it a good day?  Well, it wasn't bad.  See you next time, for another exciting edition of "The Life of Charles McTygue" (aka Charlie Brown).

      hey i havent updated in a while so i figured i should give it another shot even though all my entries seem to be... the... "modern art" of blog entries being that they are all... abstract or depressing : / but im not depressed!!! or... abstract!  so the band banquet was tonight and that was fun except when some people talk on and on about old ppl junk and then some seniors who should just keep quiet go ahead and get emotional over their stuffed walrus theyre giving to someone else no one knows heh.  all in all it was a very good night. i get to go to the Byron Nelson Open tomorrow... not really sure if i like golf but at least it isnt scarborough fair.. i have to memorize my solo for state next week and do my three lab reports due next week along with those tests i dont keep track of and blah blah i hate school. school will all be over with very soon and then the summer is here.  that is the greatest thought that has crossed my mind in at least... 20 minutes. wow.  gonna be a senior.  i cant wait.  well im not really sure what to say other than all my friends are awesome.  ok well im done here i think.  ill stay up for another hour or so. ill see you all monday and well get some serious schoolage done!

      hey. this is an update,  there are not many days of school left.  The final decision on whether charles passes precal is coming up so stay tuned.  Along with precal, physics has come back to a surprising and punising lead over charles.  seems he has his work cut out for him.  his plan looks to be just to run hard and steady, cutting corners and not giving a shit about any of it; and that seems to be working out for him. thats right, steve.  charles seems to know how to suck, and suck hard.  and thats just what hes doing.  all he has to do is keep it up for another week. well, lets get back to the action and see what charles' next move is, when we return to CHARLES VS CHS in the championship game 6/6... right after these commercials.  lhovhe yhou.

      well now seems like a good time to update. i feel like shit again... hehe it seems like the only time i update my blog is when i do. weird. anyway, not much is going on, mrs. mcclintock is the biggest bitch ive ever met. i have a big C in both physics and precal which is greatnot. hope i pass and dont fail because that would suck not that it matters because because. anyway, i cant at least look forward to waking up at the same time i have every day of this year and going to freshman camp so that i can be judged and competed with etc.  it will be great.  maybe when im done with these classes ill feel better provided i dont fail something. so.  i cant think of much else so im going to go. bye.

      Well things up until now have been relatively awesome, just because school was pretty easy, i had free time, and everything was cool, but now that the break is coming up, i have a bunch of tests and things and i realize that my grades suck as much as ever, but i suppose it really doesnt matter because not my gpa is pretty much stuck at 3.suck. its funny how i complain just as much as every other soul out there in highschool-land and yet they still seem to make 100's on everything, so i really have only two options or a combination of both that could be true. 1.  im just that stupid, and nothing at all above average, perhaps below. 2.  i have and have had horrible habbits when it comes to studying or doing hw, and i still do not do it, and even if i do it still sucks because i dont do it normally.  its like trying to play an instrument without practicing it ever.  how do you expect to be good?  i think its both of these now that i think of it.  oh well sucks for me.  life blows so lets keep going..---~~~  so.  school sucks.  theres big bad thing #1.  wow thats original cause its not like everyone dislikes school.  oh yeah they do.  i forgot because of ^^^^^ now others might be happy about the break but im not sure yet im so looking forward to it cause i get to drive to my aunt's in louisianna and see my very first cousin and the only other kid in my family!!!  should be awesome!  plus i havent seen them in a long time.  but then again, i have to DRIVE over there... with my mom... and it consumes most of my break conveniently between the two playoff games we might have, so that when i get back its as if i never had a break.  but thats the negative way of looking at it.  THERE WILL BE SO MUCH  PIE!!!   well whatever.  so yay.  i guess i dont have much to say.  something that rhymes with yay and say like day pay may nay gay hay gray ok.!!!  ummmmm.  im contemplating whether complete insensitivity to all things in the world would be best.  it would greatly reduce stress, and it seems like people like to hate me an awful lot (not you friends) but random people whom i havent met dislike me and i cant figure it out.  theres nothing i can do to please them.  so maybe if i laugh about it a lot and not care.  good idea.  ok case closed. :E  well im done so ill be going.  probably wont be another update before i leave so yeah. talk to you later all. yours.

      I have not updated in... let's calculate. ::::::::::::::::...:...:.:.:.:.::..:.:.:.:.:.:::.:.:..:.::.:.:.:.:. 4 months, 20 days, and 9 hours.  so here is what everyone has been waiting for!!!::::: wow use of colons is surprising.!!1.1!  ok so everything has been going well in   lets see... school is stupid and boring, but everything seems pretty cool and a lot easier with flex year round and a much lessened "care" factor.  Although... challenge has by far become the worst and most torturous class there is.  Band is... there constantly and sometimes becomes just not..  A#$U* but its alright because i really dont care about it anymore other than little things like state and solo..  but im really not making much effort so whatever, id just like to relax.  that reminds me.  one of my favorite things is : relax.  so awesome... just think of it.  there are so many times when that is the best thing there is.  that and pie.  also, friends etc are pretty good... i have the best girlfriend in the world... shes so wonderful in every way.  i love you melissa!  now the randomness paragraph:::: (colon) OK  so i was thinking, people seem to categorize things mostly in two categories: (colon) "good" and "bad" things that are good are usually money food, essential things for life or extra wants that please us asthetically, physically, emotionally, etc.  and bad things are things that prevent "good" things or are detrimental to our physical, emotional, fiskal, etc. well-being.  but, with the proper mindset in our new age technological world, theres really no logical reason to think of "bad" things as... something to be feared or avoided.  such things as pain.... when something bad happens, yes pain is there to help and to make things more apparent that the prime objective for that individual is to stop the pain by rectifying whatever has gone wrong, but i see that perhaps there is a lower need for pain and actually a point where pain greatly gets in the way of things.  ex: (colon) if you get your leg blown off, you would most likely-flop around on the ground screaming in agony as the blood leaked out of your body leaving you helpless to any other offense, and ridiculously inactive in the correction of your injury.  with our technology, people can live without a leg or in some cases reattach the leg.  so... wouldnt it be better if instead of flopping around screaming until you die or force someone else to help you, you could acknowledge the fact that your leg has been blown off calmly, and proceed to crawl over, get it, and promptly seek medical attention????  perhaps saving your leg and at least your life...?  well i know there are other arguments such as "your body is rigged that way so you dont harm yourself... and... the physics of it are simply that your neural pathways and nerve cells operate to an extent individually in their production of "pain" so theres no self-enclosed way to stop or greatly reduce the pain save the addition of heavy meds... but im just looking at one hypothetical situation in which something "bad" would really be much better to be considered as something... "different" so that there isnt that panic and anxiety about the thing...  so that we can better administer care to whatever it is that is bothering the norm.  in a more practical use, people who work out could lessen greatly their pain in weightlifting etc.  by consciously letting the brain know that it is unnecessary to blare the alarm in this situation because the pain is unavoidable and not truly harmful to the life of the individual. i guess all im really wanting is a better control of the conscious over the subconscious, the voluntary actions over the involuntary and inhereted humanisms we all need as babies and have formed our culture by.... eh, its good in theory anyways.  *END ramblation* : (colon)  ok so theres that.  wow a lot has changed in these past 4 months, they feel a lot longer.  i am a little worried about the future and college, but i think things will be ok in the long run... hm so yeah.  i guess life goes on and little things dont matter as much as i or (we) make them seem.  its sort of fun to think of the danger of the future... if anything ive grown better at making seriously afflicting poor turns of events into a joke that i can laugh about, and make almost any situation comical... to myself at least, which greatly lessens stress sometimes. dododododododo so i think i should go cause i need sleep so badly... i was hoping for a great end, a grand finale, but i guess not... everyone go to www.engrish.com www.deviantart.com and i cant think of anything else for now but stick with the old www.homestarrunner.com so ill try to update this again sooner than 4 months or so, i think i can do it.  whoever reads this rocks. talk to you later! out.

      I made some additions to my blog and i think they really accent my feelings.  hooray for thanksgiving break!  im going out of town to louisiana to visit relatives and stuff especially my aunt shelly and their new baby yay!!!  Carter is officially the only other child in my family since my moms generation.  thank god. so, im still considering changing my name when i turn 18.  i know u prob think thats stupid cause its  my name  but its a name from my asshole father's family, and i dont really want to be a part of that...  hm not sure.  so give me your input i guess... not that it will make much difference hehe.  lets see.... so we leave tuesday morning, drive 5 hours or so and thanksgiving yay!!! i CAN NOT WAIT ONCE AGAIN FOR THE FOOD OMG.  and then i get back friday liiiike 2ish im guessing.  oh also helpin out at the bh on monday so thats fun!  i guess!  hope i make region band!!  and then go to state!  after three damn years...!  dododo yeps.1!  this week has been pretty ok.  school blows but actually the work load is slight.  i desperately need to finish applications.  holy crap.  then we had the game..... sucked.  but we dont have any others so i guess thats good...  and now the break.  man, im really sweating christmas presents as always because i suck at getting gifts.  i can never shop for myself let alone someone else.  i can never find something thats good enough cause i always find something wrong with it or something... so then shopping for someone else is 238 times worse since im that much more worried about what they will think... **sigh**  yep so i guess im done with this update, not much else to write.  hm i need to figure out how to center things in the blogger template and what numbers different colors are so i can make this template not suck, and make my blog not look like crap because there are only like 7 different ones to choose from now....  so if u know lemme know.  yeah.  ok SWHWIOEAP(FU$(PUWJIASF:LDSVM::SDVMP$AS(TJUAKSDFJ!!!!!!  well good luck being alive! hope it goes well for you.

      this update will be a short one because i am sooo tired and must retire to the retiring bed which i have named my regular bed forthwith.  so how u doin????? hmmmm?!?!?!?!?!?  school started up again and its alright, i passed those tests i took before the break so thats always nice... im really behind on applications etc... i hope everything goes well... dododododo i cant wait to try out for region! whoooo.... and then pre-area.  great.  i really wish i could just have tried out for orchestra and be done with this.  region band is such a joke.  of course, theres no saxes in orchestra!!! yaaay  well i guess thats about it, ill see you ppls on the other side of the thingy that changes times and each time a different time comes it flips so that youre on the other side of it and that is where you can "see" people like you whom i said i would see on the other side of the thingy that changes time.   urlLink    ok later!

      Heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy things sort of suck right now.  school is boring but it just wont go away.  and then theres not much to really... do. lets see, i have a challenge project that i still have to do but i dont know if ill do it because i stinkxxkkk.  then we just took the economy test today and that wasnt too bad....  the calculus test is tomorrow and im afraid.  maybe ill get some study thing together and that will be good... ho-hum.  hopefully things will get better when the CHRISTMAS BREAK comes!  i cant wait for that--- but, it also means super stress for me cause i dont know what to do for gifts still...  i know it doesnt seem like a big deal but i get super nervous about it, and weird. today i realized that it has become very hard for anyone to take me seriously sometimes.... and that kinda sucks.  but i guess its my own fault.  oh well, maybe i will become depressed for a month and then ppl will get used to me being serious.  (jk)  lalalalalallie  yehp..! soooo i guess thats about it.  school and band.  i really hope i make state this year, ive waited long enough...........lol ummmmm yes!  frump. nothing left to say i guess.  i wish the things that are bad that i am not doing a good job at handling would be easier, and i wish that more good things would come and that i would be able to take advantage of them.  so there you go.  ok so thats all i guess! maybe ill think of more later. lates

      school has finally been subdued, and negotiations of surrender have been scheduled.  i would say gg, but school was a real cockface throughout the fight.  i mean, it was supposed to be a constructive, friendly competition ruled by the guidelines of honor, or whats left in the world today, but school just sort of threw that to the wind and went after 'me jewels.  so therefore, i show no mercy and spit in his face.  pwphhtoo.  other than that, things are pretty good. i am becoming fed up with my job because everyone, including the 30-year-old managers are acting like freshmen and treat no one with any sort of respect, understanding, or friendliness.  so, in the words of some great person whose name ive forgotten, "fuck that" (some great person whose name ive forgotten 37).   when you get to thinking about it, you really wonder what sort of person you will become or are becoming (when i say "you" i mean "me"), and its frightening because most of the time, it isnt who you want to be, or who youve always thought you were aiming for.  truthfully, somehow you have become one of those people you saw and thought "wow im glad i wont have to end up like them"  or "i dont see how they can be that way..." so it shocks you and you are left with so many questions...  ok so i wrote that a few hours ago, and i came back to finish it but i dont really feel like continuing that train of thought so the end.  i guess thats all ive got.! i hope everything is great and i can NOT waiTTT for IRELAND/ENGLAND ive never been out of the country and i am just... looking forward to the awesome trip. plus, i get to spend it with a bunch of my closest friends, and melissa nieves, the gratest girlfriend in the world!  so hooray!for that!!  ok i think  that  is all for now.  see you on the other side of the future thing maybe some sort of hour glass or something..!  byebye!

      I DIDNT DO IT WITH THEM BECAUSE THEY DIDNT DO IT WITH ME AND NEITHER DID NO ANYONE DID ANYTHING WITH NO ONE THAT WAS OF RECKONING!  theres no reason to think that i did anything wrong, since theres nothing that anyone is suspicious of.  no one has been wronged to the extent that they are emotionally hurt or angered by the action so much that they must seek out the perpetrator of their privacy or blah blah blah trailing off talking lots et cetera et cetera and the rest.  ok so so far, i got in a car wreck because some asshole hit me and i got paid crap for my car, but i got a new one and i love it!!! (i dont give a crap what other ppl think so dont go and compliment me or tell me what you dont like about it, it suits me fine and performs its functions perfectly so that is all that matters) i also went through the endeavor of retrieving my car stereo and speakers from my old car which is in a wrecking yard or something in grand prairie... and then putting the stereo into my new car.  so that was an adventure, and im still not sure what to do about my speakers because the large ones dont fit, and the wire gauge is different so im not sure how to do it myself and i dont have any cash laying around to get them installed, especially with prom coming up.  well, it really doesnt matter because my speakers are just fine and all, its just the principle of the thing since i got them this christmas as a gift : /  well i hate school the most right now... it is such a waste of time.  band, sociology, independent study for calculus, and speech.  sigh.  the trip was AWESOME despite the no sleep and the sickage. so yeah it was great.  hmmmm Melissa Nieves is turning 17 on tuesday the 30th!!!!!!! WHOOOO that means we can go to rated R movies together!  ....more easily! so congratulations to the greatest person in the world and happy birthday!!!  i guess thats it... things are ok i guess. i dont know.  :)  ok so later!

      Hey all. its been quite a while, as it usually is whenever i update this thing.  so wow... school is coming to a close, its really pretty much over. you know i never really thought about it.  the end of high school didnt really affect me very much.  i didnt really care... but i think i do actually care, i just didnt know that i cared.  i have all these thoughts and feelings but they dont make sense and they arent directly related to high school or anything i just have them.  its very weird and sort of disturbing.  i just hope i dont come off wrong... too bad i do. well anyways, screw that.  i hope this summer rocks!  thats another thing i havent given much thought.  the summer is here!  i wish i were excited like i have been previous years.  everything is so alien... hm.  it was really cool of mr moore, my speech teacher to give me the week off because i already did my final speech and thats all theyre doing this week... so it cut my school day way down.  although... now it doesnt seem like im actually going to school.. it feels like i show up on my own free will, and i have no better place to go.  which is really true, because all of my friends are there, and its basically been my life these past years.  and now its almost over.  good.  ???  well im really looking forward to all those fun things at the end of the year... lets see heres the order: -monday: awards ceremony(boo) and six flags!! -saturday: state?!? -sunday: party at petes whoo! lol -monday: party at ross' or... family.. stuff? -tuesday: graduation!  and then project graduation!! :D  the only thing that sucks about some of those events is that melissa cant be there with me :(  sigh  well i think thats it... i wish i could make you happy.  know that. ..or something. ok so i suck at writing and speaking and conveying thoughts, but i hope you feel better reading it for some reason. thanks for taking your time.  Charles

      yay!!! 3 day weekend!  im so ready for it.  my brain is frazzled (especially from the late night chess session, michael moonerz haha)..  i have another shout out request (a $10 one, right habibster??)  so heres a shout out to my good pal michael habibi!  aka habibster, michael bibi, and more... you listen to cool music, you drive a cool car, and you have a cool job.. so in my opinion, you're pretty cool!  just remember that you still have to let me drive your new car ;)    so the fball game last night was somewhat fun!  anybody have some good ideas for initiating percussion freshmen??  and travis, by far, is the eternal "pocket dance" winner.. but dont worry hendrix, you won the boxer contest.  hehe cant wait until we arrive at the hotel in columbus, ohio... (*winks at sb*)  pet peeve #1- homework in BCIS ... what the heck is that about?!?!?! i have to fill out a stupid paper about my "interests and skills" and find a job in the technology/business field that fits me... boooorrriiingggg- any ideas??  pet peeve #2- homework in challenge... that is absolutely unheard of.  i am thoroughly disgusted at the mere thought of it.  i cannot believe that i am being forced to complete a "Maycomb Map" for TKAM.  who cares where scout lives in relation to the post office?!?!  good grief.  well im outta here... 10 bucks blog freezes up as soon as i post this and i have to rewrite it.. oh welllll. goodbye all!

ANYHOO, not much hw tonight.. just a map for wd hist and thats it!!  good luck to all you "apushers".. you guys seem to have your work cut out for you.  and in the words of the great and mighty michael mooney: HACKusQUO: your blog r0x0rs. so there ya have it... and whatever mooney says, goes... so looks like my blog is pretty cool!  i guess thats it.. not really anything else to say.. besides CHARLES, GET BETTER!!!  and on that note, im outta here!  goodbye!

      woohoo!! another great day in the life of me!  im on a roll :)   took me a while to wake up this morning.. i love sleeping during thunderstorms and i didnt want to get out of bed!  but i was pretty hyper today overall which is a goooood thing.  oh and band was much better today- i could actually play the warm up!  hehe  i dont have much to say today.. yet theres so much on my mind...  ive been really happy lately, but for some reason i tend to think more about the bad things in my life than the good.. which brings me down a lot.. but eh, im doing great and although i COULD be happier, i dont necessarily need or want to be... if that makes any sense at all lol  anyhoo, i know this was a short one, but ive got some hw to do and some stuff to think about, so ta-ta for now!

      yes.. i have conformed.. after becoming addicted to reading other people's blogs, ive come to the conclusion that i might as well make my own.  so here it is!  lets see, what did i do today.. i woke up, watched some tv, played solitaire, talked online, and took over the world w/ my mom (lol charles)  then, i looked at the clock and realized i had less than half an hour to shower and get ready for church and i was still in my pajamas! so i had to go to church with semi-wet hair and crappy make up and ugh.. i just was not in a very good mood.  but i suppose church was more fun than i thought it was going to be.. although there were TONS of people there, and it makes me sick how half of them dont even care and are just there because their parents are making them or so they can socialize.  darn teenagers.. (right brandon??)  oh well.. i have a feeling church is gonna be a lot different this year, but i guess as long as my friends keep coming, it'll be alright.  i dunno if i can handle all the "cool kids", as eric says.  us band nerds gotta stick together at st anns.  well, kiddos.. tomorrow's the first day of school!  at first, i did not want to go back at all and i was dreading it very much, but whats the point of getting all worked up about something you cant change, right?  so i'll just go with the flow and maybe it wont be as bad as im making it out to be.  heres my schedule: 1  band (yeahhhh- great way to start the day!) 2  BCIS (please be a blow off class.. please please please) 3  alg 2 preap (mrs. bourg!! yay!!!) 4  wd hist preap (should be fun, or so ive heard) 5  challenge (w/ the one and only mrs smith... *ahem* "student tends to socialize".. what a bunch of crap)  i guess i'll head off to bed now.. gotta get a good night's sleep before the big day!  good luck to everybody  on a side note, dont see "serving sara"... XXX is a classic compared to it  on another side note, charles is the greatest ;)

      yes im FINALLY signing again... im getting to be like martin with this thing.  well, this past week was, to say the least, blah.  nothing exciting/dramatic/blogworthy happened.  i went to school, went to band, did my hw, went to bed... and that was about it.  the football game was pretty blah, too.  of course i had fun talking to people.. i had a nice conversation with tyson. and cant forget about the little chat with jeremy... poor guy was so confused about jesuit.  the bus rides were GREAT!  me, sb, matt disen, and nick radcliffe rode on zac and thomas's bus and it was so much fun!  we told thomas knock knock jokes and ate gummy bears and harmonized and sang songs... so much fun!!  it was nice and NOT hot on the bus and it didnt smell as much as the drum line bus.... which was a plus, too.  today im working at the st ann carnival with clayton... 2:30-5:45 kiddie games baby.  so come visit me!!  and bring me food! because chances are i'll be hot and sweaty and hungry.  YAY whitneys partay tonight!  its gonna be great... its from 7-11 for all you who didnt hear about the time change.  and everyone congratulate michael mooney.  he is officially a "Mensan".  way to go moonerz!  oh yeah, my cell phone number is 214-695-2073 so call me and make me feel special and important and loved!  even if you have nothing to say!  still call me and we can just waste my minutes.  alright thats all i've got for now... so check back later for more insights into my extremely uneventful life  bye!

      i guess i'll begin with my next shout-out request.. this one goes out to clayton.. thanks for being so cool! yay for pit and oboe.. you're definitely the coolest fish in our section!  well, last night was pretty boring, to say the least... thank God the cops came to spice things up!  my friends sure have several run-ins w/ the police...this one was pretty funny, though.  in the words of pete, "it was mooney!!"  good times.  got up at 8:30 this morning for church.. and strangely enough, im not tired! in fact, im extremely hyper and i WANT TO DO SOMETHING!! but is there anything to do? no...  hmm have you ever needed to do something really badly, but kept putting it off, thinking you still have forever to do it? not just like homework and things like that, but more important things; things that matter in the long run.  what if there isnt a tomorrow? what if there is no "later"?  and you have to spend forever regretting the fact that you never did it... regret sucks.  *sigh*  well, thats all for today... anybody with ideas for things to do in this boring town, let me know!  cool song alert!! --> chevelle- the red

      what a great day!  i love days that start out with rain.  rain is so great- its so peaceful and everything seems so perfect when its raining.  its good alone time when its raining... but yet its good NOT alone time, too.  rain is just all around good.  rain deserves a pat on the back.  but you know what doesnt deserve a pat on the back?  homework.  homework should be murdered.  it should die a terrible, tortuous death.  especially world history projects involving the Sumerians.  who cares about the Sumerians?!  they're ancient.  they're old.  whoopie doo.  and that, ladies and gentleman, is all that i feel like typing right now.

      YES!  i am FINALLY updating my blog!  so now people like habibi can stop bugging me about it....  i dont even remember whats happened since i last wrote in here so im probably not gonna have much to say.  school's kinda depressing me now.. i dont really have the grades i'd like to have.  but i still have a few weeks to bring them up!  and as long as ive got mooney supporting me, i can do anything!! hehe thanks for all your help, moonerz.  and charles, thanks for always cheering me up :)  you always know the right things to say and you make me happier than you could imagine.  i havent really done much the last few days, other than hw, talking online, and going to band.  and the occasional game of literati with mooney. hehehe  the latest on my vanilla coke addiction: its now offically an addiction.  i get headaches whenever i havent had any.  every time i take a sip of the smooth, sweet liquid that is vanilla coke, i am overcome with emotion.  God has truly blessed us with this miraculous soft drink.  vanilla coke heals all wounds, cures all diseases, and is freaking GOOD!  i could live off of it.  so the next time you're wondering what on earth to get me for my birthday/halloween/thanksgiving/christmas/st patricks day/labor day/lincolns birthday/"take your kid to work" day/any other holiday, a 6-pack would be greatly appreciated.  aaaand thats all for now.. i gotta go write an essay for "to kill a mockingbird".  hopefully i'll get back in the swing of updating this blog daily so you guys can get in on all the excitement in my life!

      *SIGH*.  my life is one big sigh right now.  so much for updating my blog daily, hehe... ive been having a pretty crappy week and my blog is the last thing on my to do list. but i decided that i could sacrifice some of my precious time to update it tonight :)  lets see... for those who care, heres a run-down on today and how it sucked.  majorly.  so last night, i was workin on my extra credit proj for world history... and i was DONE.. completely done, i just had to print it out.  so i clicked print, and my computer freezes.  so what do i do? i ctrl alt delete, and then... BAM!  Word closes.  and my project is gone because i, being the stupid person that i am, DID NOT SAVE.  3 hours of work.  gone.  it was about 930 at this point and i had to redo everything.  talk about disappointment.  so, reluctantly, i did it.  i still had my "interactive notebook" to do, too, but i thought i'd get up around 6 to finish that and memorize a poem for english.  but of course, i slept through my alarm this morning until 730, and i had to rush to get ready and get to school.  so im extremely stressed out.  im tired, i looked like absolute crap, and i still had tons of hw to do.  thank GOD i had all of first period to work on stuff.  i'd like to thank liz and mooney for making my crap-filled morning as best as it could possibly be- you guys rock.  anyways, so i did hw during band and finished up my interactive notebook.  so my day continues... bcis was pointless, as usual... then mentor was even more pointless, and then we get to lunch, which is always the highlight of my day.  i vented to mooney a lot during lunch (like always heh) and then we get to math.  i made a 105 on my test, but i was in too much of a bad mood to even be excited... but my day continues.  i get to wd history (the worst class ever).  so im sittin there, checking out other people's interactive notebooks, and im like "hmm everybody seems to have 3 more pages of notes than i do".  so i keep looking and i realize that im MISSING more than HALF of my notebook!!  so i am freaking out.  and then julia comes in and shes in the same situation as i am!  so we're like, what the heck.. how did we not get these notes.  and then we realize that we werent there that day!  she had been absent and i had left that class halfway through to go to the doctor.  BUT we had both asked dutton if we missed anything and he said "no".  WTF?!  so i did half of my notebook in about 5 minutes.. it looked like CRAP.  (theres another bad grade in that class...) and we got some grades back in that class, which didnt exactly excite me, if you know what i mean.... so that made everything worse.  and then i get to english, with my poem unmemorized, but we're taking an 18 point test on poetry which i had completely forgotten about until 2nd period, so i was totally unprepared.  and it was hard.  writing definitions?!  geez i thought it was gonna be like matching or something.  and then band was just... well, it was band.  i was very NOT into it today.  i wasnt really paying attention to anything and was just sort of in my own world, and i didnt really care about anything.  so yeah, thats my day in a nutshell.  so much more little stuff happened that just added on to my crappiness, but im too lazy to type everything.  maybe its the lack of sleep.... ive gotten 6 hours in the past 2 days.  yeaaahhhh, and im still going strong! hmm wait, maybe im not... sleep sounds so incredibly nice right now.  anyways, i better get to my hw.... *BIG SIGH*  when will it end?!

      hooray!  im convinced that my bad week is officially over- i had a really good day today!  nothing in particular, really... just a good day.  well, and theres also the fact that i have NO homework whatsoever.  thats a first for me!  today was pretty uneventful... didn't really do anything in any of my classes.  steff came over after band/stuco and drew me for her art assignment... it was cool!  and thats my day in a nutshell!  nothing more to say really... oh wait, i take that back.  i have discovered a new pet peeve of mine... when people DONT SAY WHATS ON THEIR MIND!  why do ppl constantly beat around the bush or say certain things just to make you feel good, instead of saying what they really think?  from now on, i want everyone to be completely and totally honest w/ me.  just tell me what you're thinking, flat out.  i dont care what it is or if its good or bad.  just tell me.  make life simpler for the both of us.  and thats all i have for today.. tune in next time for more blabberings by me :)

      yay my week is finally over!  and im definitely in a much better mood.. MUCH better.  yesterday was fun... went over to charles's and intently played snake while pete watched dragon ball.  then we went to taco bell and i played some more snake.  and then we saw "the tuxedo" which was... interesting.  and theeennn we went to amy's partay for a while, then went to mamas pizza, and then watched "we were soldiers" at stephanie black's house.  slightly graphic movie... especially when the guys skin peels off (nassttyyy).  my mom left this morning to visit her parents in florida for a week.  so basically, i have no parents this week since my dad doesnt count, cuz half the time i ask him if i can do something, hes not really listening.  "hey dad can i go have sex?" "*still reading newspaper* mmhmmm whatever you want honey."  heh i love my dad...  theres no fball game this friday which im super excited about!  not much goin on today.. just gonna do hw, go to church, lay around- the usual sunday.  i dont really have anything more to say, so... til next time!  cool song alert! TRUSTcompany- "downfall" ... check it out!

      ok im really going to try to update this daily.. and i PROMISE it this time.  for real!  because i know how much my blog means to you people out there- its the only thing that truly fulfills your lives.  its ok, you can admit it.  you depend on my blog in order to survive.  go on, admit it.  the first step to overcoming a problem is admitting you have one.  so admit it.  say it with me now.  "my life depends on melissa's blog."  there.  that's much better.  now, onto my exciting entry.  i suppose i'll begin with friday- had a really great day for the most part.  i had a good laugh friday morning because of charles... hehe hes so funny :)  band was a lot of fun and of course, the fact that there was no game was awesome.  so after rehearsal, we all saw "sweet home alabama".  talk about disappointment!!  i was so looking forward to seeing it.. and i finally get to- and its TERRIBLE!  so predictable and lame.  and all the jokes pretty much fell flat.  after that, we went on over to kevin's house and watched tv for a while.  southpark was quite enjoyable- alabama man! "i thought i told you to shut up! *smacks other barbie doll*"  haha.. and then the whole predicament with charles's car keys... but it all turned out ok.  so then saturday, i pretty much sat around for the first part of the day, then charles, mooney, and i went to visit habibi up at game stop.  and i organized game boy games for a meager 25 cents!  i should've made like 20% of habibi's paycheck, but whatever- i guess you've gotta be thankful for whatever you get.  hehe  i do appreciate the quarter, mooney.  i'll give it back, though.  i really don't have much use for a quarter anyways.  anyhoo, then after that we saw "RED DRAGON"!  which was AWESOME!  definitely one of my favorites- not as good as "silence of the lambs", but definitely one of the best movies i've seen in a long time.  and then we went over to ross's (after sitting in the wendy's parking lot for a while, trying to decide what to do) and watched tv.  and then went home!  overall, a good day.  and then we get to sunday.  i woke up at 7 to get to church by 7:45 to help out w/ sunday school, and then afterwards, my dad suggested going to local diner.  i didn't really want to, but i reluctantly agreed... and it turned out to be really cool.  my dad and i actually talked.  like, not just small talk.. but   talk talk.  it was very nice, indeed.  and then my mom got home around 3:30 and boy, was i ever glad to see her!  a whole week without mom was pretty stressful.  there was practically no food in the house, all my clothes were dirty, the house was a wreck, and my dad tended to get on my nerves ALL THE TIME!  so i talked to her for like 10 minutes, but then i had to go to church.  so i went to mass, was insulted by eric (for piper, no less! haha), and then went out to eat with my parents to cheddars.  yummy food.  and that brings me here!  im just hanging out w/ the parentals... catchin up with my mom and stuff.  definitely a GREAT day!  and hopefully, tomorrow will be even better!  things are looking up already, since there's no school, and that automatically puts me in a good mood.  so thats my weekend in a nutshell.  i hope you found it as enjoyable as i did!  i don't really have anything thought-provoking or insightful to say, so i guess i'll just leave it at that.  adios mis amigos!

      After trying to think of songs that a friend of mine should download, I decided to list some of my favorite bands and songs so that all of you could go and download them and enjoy them as much as I do!  Let's see...  Disturbed  - best songs are "Liberate", "Prayer", "Believe", "Stupify", and "The Game"  System of a Down - best songs are.. hmm pretty much all of the Toxicity album, esp. "X", "Forest", "Atwa", and "Psycho"  Apocalyptica - "Fade to Black", "Nothing Else Matters", "One", "Inquisition Symphony", and much, much more!  Linkin Park - "Plc.4 Mie Head", "Enth E Nd", "Krwling", "My Dsmbr" (all on Reanimation), "Place for My Head", "Papercut", "Crawling" (all on Hybrid Theory), "My December", "High Voltage" (other songs)  Weezer - waaaay too many amazing songs to list, but check out the Pinkerton and Blue albums  311 - "Whos Got the Herb", "Amber", "I Told Myself", "Come Original", "Flowing", and several more  Incubus - every single song is pretty much pure genius  Phish - "Free", "Gin and Juice", "Heavy Things", "Waste"  That's gotta be like a million cool song alerts right there...  Those are just a VERY few of my favorites.  So check them out!  Goodbye dear fans!

      ~~~a violently AWESOME interjection in Melissa's blog (by.. *gasp* ME!- whaddya know.. I'm actually writing in my own blog!)~~~  Yes, I've decided to update my blog all by myself!  GOOD GRIEF- I could really use some excitement in my life.  Right now, it's all just band and hw.  So feel free to spice things up.  I don't care if it's something that's good or bad- I just need something to worry about or think about or talk about or do.. just SOMETHING!  *sigh* now that that's out of the way... if anybody would like to come to my sister's piano concert this Sunday, let me know- it should be super cool!  And the more people cheering her on, the less nervous she'll be!  Or so I hope...  Oh!  *siren/strobe lights*  Cool song alert!  "Liberate" by Disturbed.  This song ROCKS.  A lot.  It's got so much rock-age that I can't even describe it.  So go download it!  Check it out- I promise you'll like it.  Except for the slight profanity.... *ahem*  Alright, that's all for tonight.  I have math homework to attend to.  Until next time!

      ~~~a violently sexy interjection in Melissa's blog (Charles Ayen McTygue III baby)~~~  After reluctantly declining her first offer for me to update her blog, i came crawling back kissing her feet to write in here.  Look where it got me ;) First off, ill try to keep it clean cause i know none of u want to hear about my hot passionate love for Melissa Renee Nieves so all ill say is that shes the coolest suitest awesomest and hottest girl on urth to the point that i cant spell words correctly when i think of hur.  OK!  other than that lemme think of what else to say... life is a crazy thing... right now its sort of boring what with school, band, homework, eating, sleeping, and school again... but maybe we can squeeze in a few hours of IHOP time in there somewhere... hm. Michael and Michael, i give you my sincerest reguards.  U guyz r kuul^10. ive officially recorded all the movies ive seen in a complete year since october 10, 2001.  65 movies.  thats roughly 325 dollars put to movies.  not including food and such..... but oh, its worth it.  u even get little pieces of paper with the movie theater and time u saw it.  fancy schmancy. well i think im done for the night i cant think of much else ta say. ill see you cool cats in school, baby.  later.  --Charles

      ~~~a not so violent interjection in melissa's blog (a work of Michael Habibi)~~~  Well, believe it or not but Melissa actually let me update her blog...who would have thought *evil grin*.  Where to start? Well, like it says above, it is indeed Sunday, and yesterday was indeed Saturday.  What did I do Saturday? I'll tell you what I did...I picked up fricken trash around the school...all you lazy people's trash that can't bother to throw it in the trashcan 10 feet away, yes, thats right, YOU.  I'm sure it wasn't all your trash though so I forgive you.  Guess what I found? Over by the parent loop in the bushes there was a 12 pack of coors light...hmmm...makes you wonder.  Oh and I never really noticed all the cigarette buds around the school until now.  But it wasn't that bad, I got 2 service hours for only 30 minutes of work...and plus it wasn't really that hard.  I cheated and went to the band and asked for their trash...bwa hahaha.  Yea..and I was suppose to goto work today, but as soon as I got there they told me to go home....sooo here I am writing this.  Lets see what else is there to say...school sucks....work sucks...just the usual.  I'm trying to think of interesting stuff to put here but all I'm doing is putting that I'm trying to think about interesting stuff...which means I'm thinking about writing this and not about interesting stuff....wtf?...yea..............................yeaaa........... So it says a couple blogs down that we're going to be TMNTs for halloween...thats gonna be awesome (or is it?).  I'm definitely Donetello (spelling?), cause I'll have a big wooden stick that I'll use to beat the little kids with to steal their candy...yes thats right I'm taking innocent childrens candy so there.  Not much else to say really, I'm bored out of my mind...  Hey look I hit enter twice...go me.  Yes I'm that bored.  OH...go Dallas Stars! 5-2 victory against Phoenix Coyotes last night...stars rule.  Team is much better without Belfour in my opinion....  This is where I start rambling about random things that are stupid and pointless...and the beauty of it all is that you guys will still keep reading because you want to know what I'm gonna say! So instead, to spite you guys, I'm not gonna say what I was gonna.  Actually I'm getting tired of typing and I can't think of anything else and I think I've probably made enough grammar mistakes to make even Ms Peddy cry (thats a lot considering she doesn't know what a grammar mistake is).  So...until we next meet.....  -Habibi

      it's me again!  props to michael mooney for writing such an exhilarating entry- and for anybody else who would like to have the honor of writing in my blog, just ask me and i'll give you the password.  as long as you don't write anything mean/stupid/profane, etc., then i won't delete it.    anyhoo, yesterday was our first competition.... pretty interesting.  4th place :/  but i thought we performed well, at least.  and we ARE the prelim music champions!!! heck yeah!  fossil ridge can't take THAT away from us!  haha  yeahhhh so i don't really have anything to say.  which is why i'm letting people update my blog for me!  because i never have anything exciting to post for all of my avid fans.  so that's really all for now.... check back later to see what other people have to say!

      Habibi and I wrote a song!  It goes like this (to the tune of Mary Had a Little Lamb):  My Verses-  Once there was a Persian boy, Persian boy, Persian boy, Once there was a Persian boy, By the name of Habibi.  He was friends with a really cool girl, A really cool girl, A really cool girl, He was friends with a really cool girl, And her name was Lissa.  She went to visit him at work one day, At work one day, At work one day, She went to visit him at work one day, And she organized the games.  Then they hopped in Habibi's car, Habibi's car, Habibi's car, Then they hopped in Habibi's car, And made Mooney walk home.  Habibi's Verses-  Lissa had a little boy, Little boy, Little boy, Lissa had a little boy, He was a brown Habibi.  *Fin*  Yeah, I know.. my verses are so much better than his.  But it's okay- he's just not as talented as I am.  OMG, everyone has to go  urlLink here .  My dream has come true!

      Its 1 AM, time for a cool song alert!  I've had this band's albums on my computer for a while, but I just started listening to 'em.  They're like Drowning Pool, they're called Ultraspank.  Personally I'm not too fond of the songs with excessive screaming just because its harder to sing along :) buuuut, the song "Stuck" by Ultraspank isn't very screamy so if you want to listen to them check it out.  I can send some stuff too you guys if you want. [  urlLink click!  ]

      Wee for copy and paste...  [begin paste from Habibi]  Guess what, I get pretty much two weeks of thanksgiving break, what about you? *evil grin*. As soon as I finish that challenge project (grr) and make up that challenge ap essay (grr some more), the rest of the tri is downhill for me...now just a matter of finishing those two things. Today was a fairly good day...started off with challenge and we watched a movie. Calculus was calculus I guess, not too bad just went over another section. Lunch was fun like always....Chemistry...ugh I HATE that class, cuz the teacher can't teach, we have to learn everything on our own, makes me mad. Then lab management, man thats an easy blowoff class...Oh yea, can't forget that detention in lab management today. Whats that you say? How can I possibly get a detention in lab managemet? I'll tell ya....so we had this sub on thursday and friday, and apparently right from the start he didn't like me. They were taking the test, and he told me to get ready for it and I said I was just the lab assistant, so he goes "So why aren't YOU handing out these papers?"...as if I'm suppose to psychically know to do HIS job...so I think I *might* have given him a weird look on accident....but I still handed out the stuff nonetheless because its not like I'm going to say no......thanks mr sub. Then, on Friday, I asked if I could go to Calculus for some "calculus tutoring"....ok so what if I was really going to go play chess with the other multivariable calculus people, I still said calculus tutoring :) He said yea thats fine, so with about 20 mins left in class I came back, walked around the room a little bit, then saw a table playing cards, so I joined in for the rest of the period. Monday, I come back, first thing I hear from Murphy (physics teacher) is that I got a detention for the following: refusing to help the sub, skipping half of class, then playing cards when I got back. And Murphy showed me the note and thats EXACTLY what it said....what the crap. Yea so that sucked. Oh anyways back to my day (yea I'm almost done). So afterwards Mooney, Melissa and I all go to starbucks...they go for tutoring, I just kinda chatted once in a while but I tried to sleep most the time :) Afterwards, we just drove around a bit, then went home and I ate dinner and did some stuff then here I am typing this huge blog! Speaking of huge blog, this is tiring my hands, I think I'm gonna stop now....if anyone is still reading this far lol.  Until our paths next cross...   Habibi  [/end paste]

      Yes!  That's right, folks!  I'm actually updating my blog.  I'm convinced that only Matt Fuglie truly enjoys my daily musings, so this is for you, Matt.  Well, today started out kinda sucky, with Mr. Pace and all.  Thank God for uniform checkout! - too bad my dress does NOT fit.  It's way too short and too big, but noooo.  The uniform ladies are so freaking stubborn.  Oh yes, and I'd like to congratulate Mitch Johnson on way more than 3 months of being a dumbass.  Anyhoo, I had a fairly good day.  Master class wasn't TOO terrible, I suppose...  My uncle leaves tomorrow to go to (most likely) Iraq - he got called in by the Navy a few days ago, and has to go for at least a year.  They sure don't give much notice :\    I have mixed feelings about it... I mean, it's cool to think that my uncle gets to serve in the Navy, but.. I dunno... there's always that chance something could happen... egh I don't wanna think about it.  On a happier note, my aunt might come stay with us for a while, since it would suck to have to spend Thanksgiving and Christmas and every other thing by yourself.  Sadly, it looks like I won't get to celebrate Hanukkah AND Christmas this year (it's my Jewish uncle).  *sigh*  Well, I better get going on my homework and such... have a good day!

      I've gotten several requests to update, so... here I am!  I don't feel like typing out everything that I did this weekend, so I'll just say that I had fun and it was decent for a weekend.  I have this great feeling that this week is going to rock.  I have absolutely no homework, and I won't have any for the rest of the week.  Plus, there's early release!  But DARN THE PEP RALLY.  The pep rally should just... go... away.    Not much else going on in my life- looking forward to Thanksgiving break and the beginning of a new tri (I'm so very sick of this one...).  If anybody has good ideas of stuff to do in this darn town that doesn't cost tons of money, let me know!  I'm tired of always doing the same old thing (watching a movie).  Cool song alert! (in honor of my sister): "Lindsay's Song" - Ten Shekel Shirt  Charles rocks :)

      Hey, way to not update your blogs guys, so Habibi's gotta do the mass update for you all...  Well, I don't know about most of you, but I've had a nice vacation so far.  If I wasn't at home doing something cool (which is never, there's nothing cool to do at my house), I was out with all the cool band people! Yeeeaaaaaaaa....anyways.....tuesday was my birthday, happy birthday me (finally old enough to be a junior, wtf).  Apparently Melissa got me something, she said she went to the mall, saw something that she just HAD to get, and she has the nerve to not tell me what it is or how much it cost, gah...and I have to wait aaaaaaaaall the way until Friday :(  Well I can't wait to see what it is...should be interesting.  Guess what sucks?  On the day after Thanksgiving, I get to be at work at 8 in the morning! Now I don't think it can get any better than that...oh wait...it can!  I have to be there until 2!  Well at least afterwards we're gonna hang out at like speed zone or whatever.  Also, if you guys wanted to do something on Saturday also, I work 11-3.  You guys should visit me more, that way I get more chances to tell you all off...bwa hahahaha.  omg I got a webcam, its pretty cool, although it doesn't take very good quality pictures, it gets the job done.  First picture I took was me flipping off the GameStop logo on my shirt...tells you how I feel about working :)  Anyways, not much else to say, so peace  [  urlLink behkkah  ] | [  urlLink czarels  ]  -Habibi has spoken

      hey to all you out in internet land.  this is charles updating melissas blog because im bored and melissa is on my mind.  not really too much to say but tuesday u might have missed me, melissa, rebecca, and whitney from school cause we werent there.  tuesday was certainly as eventful as it was uneventful.  whatever that says... at the end of the day we were all tired and blah again just as if we had been in school :/.  heh im writing this in black text on a black background so i hope it all comes out right, cant exactly see what im typing.  mock auditions were todday... they might have been as fun as lissas... or anyone elses for that matter.  which isnt muchfun at all.  but on the good side i played my stuff at good tempos pretty accurately so thats a plus..  not much else going on, just making up work and notes etc. from yesterday... and living...  im hungry.  i think ill go back to sitting and maybe ill figure out what the heck this theta symbol means or get something to eat.  hmm.  i need a job but who knows when ill actually get one.  maybe if i have mooney there to back me up.  strength in numbers... heh.  newayz thats all i have to say!  ill talk to you people latar.  cya.

      Well folks, today a miracle happened.  Thats right- Im updating my blog!!  Its been over a month since I updated it, and due to the multiple requests to update it again, Ive decided its about time.  Or maybe Im just fed up with everybody telling me to write in it  So anyways, theres no way I can recap on everything Ive done since my last update, sooooo.. Ill just make a generalized statement that life is still rather boring and the majority of what I do is hang out at Collins house (which is actually a lot of fun).  Christmas was super fantabulous- I got tons of clothes, a few DVDs, aaaaand a bunch of other stuff that I dont feel like typing out right now.  The grandparents were here, so that was fun.  I dont get to see them much, and although I complained a lot about having to hang out with them, I really did have a good time.  And they spoil my sister and me VERY much.  Oh oh!!! Mooney wrote a nice poem/rap about me and its in his profile, but it wont be there forever, so Ill put it in here so that youll always be able to read it!!!  (or maybe Im just trying to make this blog entry super long to make up for that lost time)  From within the fury Of the endless fog, There shines the eyes Of mighty M Dawg. She travels far With a triumphant smile, She wins the battle And makes the 8-mile. :: break into rap song:: Melissa Nieves (M Dawg):    What up, G Funk, please take a seat,    You're gonna need to be sittin' when I break out my beat,     I'm bling, I'm sexy, I can cook really well,     I bag Catholic tricks, so you're ALL GOIN' TO HELL!     (Back Up Singers:  Yeah, we're all goin' to helllllll.)     I rap like I shop: owning all in my presence,     Makin' all of my money and boggling all with my essence,     Sponge Bob is my homie, his mad skillz will spin ya,     Bow down to teh M Dawg, the all-mighty Ninja.  How cool is that?!?!?  Thanks Mooney!  You r0x0r : )  Anyhoo, gonna hang out with friends today- we have a whole list of things to do so we shouldnt be bored!! Yay!!   Im going to end this blog entry now, but as Matt Fuglie said, I should make several of them, so dont worry- Ill keep more coming, Until next time!

      Hey all!  Heres another highly anticipated update   This week has been particularly gross.  Aside from being sick last weekend and the beginning of this week, school has just been extra sucky.  Im so dependent on my weekends!  And of course this weekend has to be region band and of course I have to HATE the music.  Its absolutely terriblesuper easy, and I just dont like any of it.  I havent heard anything positive about the honor bands music either, though so looks like none of us got lucky.  At least theres a 3-day weekend, and then a 3-day week, and then another 3-day weekend!  Thats really cool.  Im going to be on a church retreat next weekend with Becca, though.  Should be fun its for confirmation which Im really looking forward to.  Im not sure why; maybe its because this is the first time that I can actually say that Im a Catholic, not because my parents want me to be, but because I want to be.  That means a lot to me- kind of a self-affirmation that Im doing this for me and not for anybody else.  Anyhoo, Race Coppell 2003 is coming up!  Good luck to all you racers out there.  And sorry people, Im already someone elses shotgun (I know, I know maybe next time!)  Countdown to my birthday (for all you early shoppers out there): 73 days.  Yep, youve still got a long while I just want it to come faster and so maybe putting a countdown will help.  (Yeah right.)  Cool song alert! System of a Downs version of Black Sabbaths Snowblind - you should check it out!  Another cool song alert (omg how exciting)!  Foo Fighters - Lonely as You  actually, the entire One by One album deserves its own cool alert.  Hey, you should email me sometime.  Yes, you!  lissame5732@hotmail.com.  Add it to your address book right now.  I mean,  right now .  Stop dillydallying.  Holy crap, dillydallying is a word!  Im typing this in MS Word and theres no squiggly red line underneath it!  Woahhhhh dillydallying dillydallying dillydallying dillydallying.  Thats too cool!  So yeah, back to what I was saying.  You should email me.  I dont care if you have nothing to say and just tell me what color your socks are.  Thats good enough.  Im very low maintenance.  So really go on and email me.  Now. *threatening look*  Wellllll, Im afraid thats all for todays update.  Maybe Ill have one within the next week or so; maybe even tomorrow!  Nah I dont think youll be that lucky.    Oh yeah, Im taking a poll- Should I fill out the survey thats also displayed on Beccas, Collins, and Habibis blogs?  (Well, Habibis non-blog.)  Just tell me yes or no.  Hey, thats something for you to email me about!  Thats right  just email me a simple yes or no and well both be happy!  OK, Ive reached the second page in my Word document, so thats enough bloggage for one entry.  Bye bye!

      Yay!  Im actually updating again.  I really am going to try to update this more frequently...  anyhoo, the weekend is almost over and yet another week of school is fast approaching : (   I think Im getting sicker, and I feel really poopy.  But Ill survive!    Well, yesterday was area, so congratulations to all those that made state!  And congratulations to all those who didnt make state, because you guys are still awesome!  Steph Hsu-- a special congratulations to you and Im sorry you have to deal with that horrible, horrible man.  And Charles, well we all know Charles shouldve made it... just give Habibi the names of the judges and hell take care of everything!    As Im writing this, its snowing outside!  Too bad its not gonna stick : \   I want to live up north when Im older, for the sole reason that it snows during the winter... Ive always wanted to build a snowman, as stupid as that may sound.. hehe those dorky ones that me and Shelly made in elementary school dont count.    I dont really have much else to say- as usual, life is pretty boring.  Only 2 days until a very special someone turns 17!    Cool song alert! Disturbed - Shout 2000    Adios guys!

      Hi everybody!  I hope you're all enjoying your short, 3-day week of school.  Goodness knows I am.  I can't believe there's only one more day until the weekend!    Mason was gone today, so that was kinda cool... got to just goof around instead of having to play my solo for him.  heh  And at least I have another night to practice before I play it for him again.  I don't know if it'll do me any good, though...  I don't really feel like going into detail about my day, because it was oh so boring... so, according to simple mathematical properties, you reading about my boring day would be just as excruciatingly boring as my day itself.  And I wouldn't wish that boredom on anybody.  I'm playing hearts right now with Charles and Habibi.  Boy, that game rocks.  I love it so much!  Anybody think they can beat me?  I'll take you on...  Hmmm not much to say today.  I've got a couple more cool song alerts -- "The Zephyr Song" by Red Hot Chili Peppers and "Idioteque" by Radiohead.  Make sure you check them out!  Anybody got a better survey than the one that I posted a couple days ago?  It was fairly entertaining to do and kept me busy for a little while, but I've seen much better ones.  Race Coppell next Saturday!  Anybody up for taking some bets??  Wait, no... on second thought, I don't have much money so maybe I shouldn't gamble the little that I have all away.  hehe  Mmkay, that's all... like I said, not much to put on here tonight.  Hope everyone is having a good week!  Adios mis amigos!

      Hey all!  I'm sitting here in BCIS with nothing better to do than update my blog... and get all of you people off of my back for once.    School was really good today!  I had to play for Mason today in band, which was somewhat frightening for me because I've never actually played for him before... so of course I wanted to make a good impression.  He gave me some compliments, so that made me feel good- although I didn't play anywhere near my best.  Then, I had a lesson and was like 20 minutes late for Spanish.. but all the juniors were out testing, so we just had a free day anyways.  World history was good-- we're watching "All Quiet on the Western Front" and I really like that movie.  Mrs. Ford was gone today, so we had a sub in chemistry!!  Just had busy work to do, and as usual, I ended up doing it all, and everybody else just copied off me, but I didn't really care since I had nothing better to do.  Then here I am in 5th period, doing the usual -- NOTHING!  Sooooo, no homework for me (aside from a couple world history questions).    Yesterday was so terribly boring.  Charles was with Kevin at Speedzone, and Habibi/Rebecca/Mooney were out job hunting, so me and Collin were left with nothing to do... sooo we just sat around all day until Charles came back.  Then, we all hung out at Collin's until like 8:30- I helped Charles with his physics lab while he tried to help me not lose Mario Party... but sadly, I still sucked.  Yep.. that was my uneventful day.  Birthday countdown - 68 days!  Cool song alert!! Radiohead - "Karma Police"  Anybody up for hearts tonight??? ; )  That's all for now!!

      Hey guys!  My blog is due for an update, so here it is.  I like updating this more often now, because it keeps all of you off my back ; )  Well, I just got back from my church confirmation retreat.  It was, needless to say, awesome and an amazing experience.  It came at a really good time for me.  I learned so much and realized that there were some things in my life that I needed to work out and rethink- I wasnt really putting the things that are most important in life first.  My small group rocked so much, even though our chant didnt go over too well... tweet tweet.  heh  So yeah, I had a great time this weekend and as happy as I was to come home, Im going to miss that feeling I had.  Im pretty sure only Becca knows what Im talking about, but oh well.  Even though all retreats seem to put me in a sort of joyful mood, this one was different... a really enlightening time for me.  I hope everyones weekend wasnt TOO boring without me!  Im not ready to go back to another week of school, though... didnt exactly get much sleep this weekend so I have a feeling its going to be awful having to get up early tomorrow.  But hey, Race Coppell 2003 this Saturday!  That should be something to look forward to.  Todays cool song alert!  Finger Eleven  Suffocate ... its a good one!  Well, thats it for todays edition of Melissas Blog.  Tune in next time for one heck of an update!

      Woohoo!  Im updating this thing on two consecutive days!  Its definitely a miracle.  Actually, its just because I have absolutely no homework and Im so extremely bored.  Ive even practiced my oboe and now my mouth hurts and stuff : \  Oh well, I improved so thats all that matters.  Today was rather boring.  Wait, I take that back.  Today was extremely boring.  Lets see, band was just.... band.  The usual solo stuff.  Apparently, I need to fall in love with my tuner.  I find it difficult to fall in love with inanimate objects, but maybe thats just me.  Spanish was actually great fun, but at the expense of Mrs. Segler, as usual.  Me and Martin just goof around the whole period.  And of course we were totally making fun of Mrs. Segler when she wasnt looking and then Martin randomly turns around and Mr. Spann is sitting like right there.  Its just Jimmah Spann, but we were really embarrassed because we were really really really misbehaving.  Luckily, Sra. Segler no puede oir.  Right Martin?  haha   Anyhoo, history was alright... nothing new.  Lunch was kinda fun- Pete and Nick had a good time asking me millions and millions of questions.  Chemistry sucked.  Took a quiz and learned more about bonding.  Hot dog!  And BCIS was so boring, that I cant even express in words the extent of its boringness.  We resorted to typing each other notes on our computer while the ever-so-annoying teacher droned on and on about how to type a resume.  I was very glad for that class to be over.  But thank goodness tomorrow is Friday!  And we have Renaissance lunch, too!  And then Jordans party!  So it should be a pretty good day.  What should I be when I grow up?  Seriously, what do you picture me doing?  Because I sure dont know what to do with my life.  And it really bothers me.  So any opinions are appreciated!  And dont try to be funny and suggest obscene, X-rated, or just plain stupid jobs because Im really serious about this.  Yep, so anyhoo... cool song alert!  Te Aviso, Te Anuncio by Shakira.  Shakiras my idol, omg!  She is so awesome.  But, since Im sure nobody that reads this is a fellow Shakira fan.... another cool song is Ghost by Pearl Jam.  Well, I guess thats all for today!  Hope everyone is doing fantastically : )  Until next time!

      Wow, Ive been doing so well in updating this thing and then I went and screwed it all up : (  hehe oh well!    Man, this week is going by so slowly!!  On Monday, it felt like Friday.  And now its only Wednesday  only half over! *sigh*  I hope Ill make it through.  Its been a really easy week, though... havent had much homework.  Of course its always nice to have a class like BCIS that I can do a lot of my homework in.  This weekend should be exciting... lots of stuff going on and already planned, which is extremely abnormal for us.    Ive come to the conclusion that we take too many things for granted, such as our bodily functions.  Can you imagine what it would be like if we couldnt pee?  Or poop for that matter?  It would all build up inside of us and eventually wed have to pop and it would go everywhere and it would be gross.  I think it would leak out of our ears but some people think that due to the location of the bladder in relation to the head, that would be close to impossible.  But I dunno... if your body was full to the brim with waste, itd probably come out in more than one area (assuming your bladder just EXPLODED and your body was literally full to the brim with waste).  Hmm, so yeah.  See what happens when people leave me by myself??  Im gonna go crazy one day.  Did you know that my name backwards, although its spelled differently, sounds a lot like asylum?!  Coincidence?  I think not.  Actually, when I was little, I watched a lot of cheap made-for-TV movies with schizophrenic women (Lifetime, baby) and I used to be afraid that I would go crazy one day and I wouldnt be able to prevent it.  Anything is possible!  Well, I think thats enough for one night.  Maybe Ill have some more insightful thoughts for you tomorrow.  Or maybe Ill spare you, instead.  Cool song alert! Duncan Sheikh  Barely Breathing  ... an oldie, but one of my favorites, so therefore, you must check it out because... umm... I said so!  Farewell everyone!

      Life is once again oh so good.  Today was a great day- did really well on my polyatomic ion quiz in chemistry (after HOURS AND HOURS of memorizing those darn things... sheesh) and just had an overall laid-back day.  And tomorrow is Friday, which makes today even better!  Its also Valentines Day... sure, I think Valentines Day is the biggest excuse for a holiday ever and is a huge Hallmark ploy, but I get to hand out super cool valentines that I know will be a smashing success!  Got more mail from colleges today.  In the past couple days, Ive gotten mail from: Macalester College (wth?) Elon University (wth?) Whitman College (wth?) University of Chicago (at least Ive heard of this one!) University of Miami (heard of this one, too) Grinnell College (wth?) Coe College (wth?) Boston University (finally, another one Ive heard of!) Baylor University (yay, another one Ive heard of!) I can say right now that I wont be attending any of the above colleges.  What a waste of postage for them!  hehe  Whos up for seeing Jungle Book 2 this weekend?  Nobody seems very excited about it, but it comes out tomorrow and it looks so great.  Like amazingly great.  I cant wait to see it!  (And I will see it.)  Cool song alert!  Maroon5  Harder to Breathe and Shiver ... Im totally getting into Maroon5!  All for now... see you guys later!

      Well, I'm home sick today.  I was planning on coming to school late, but I just did not feel like even getting out of my bed.  I'll have to make up my Spanish test and I won't be able to review during Chemistry, but it's ok.  I still have to memorize my solo, so any extra practice time I can squeeze in before I have to go to band is very welcome.  I'm so excited!  The last episode of Joe Millionaire is TONIGHT!  At 8!  No, I'm not being sarcastic - I hate reality shows, but I can't seem to stop watching Joe Millionaire, and I can't wait to see who he picks and how she reacts to the fact that he's not a millionaire!  And I also started watching The Bachelorette, too.  I like The Bachelor better, though.  Oddly enough, the very first guy on The Bachelor is the son of my dad's very good friend.  It was pretty amusing to see the guy that used to eat all the gross vegetables off my plate having sex with several women and trying to find one who he could marry.  The show made it out to be some huge ordeal and that she was going to move to California with him and blahblahblah... it didn't end up anything like that.  They're not married, they're not going to get married, she didn't move to California, and the only reason he took any part in the show was to get his name out in the open in order to boost his business.  hehehehe yep, gotta love those "reality" shows.  Well, I'm gonna go do all the homework I had this weekend that I never did.  And maybe a shower will help me feel better... adios!

      Ahhhh!! *goes psycho*  Moms Bunco group is meeting at our house tonight.... so painful!  A bunch of tipsy women that seem to think Bunco means gossiping instead of actually playing the game.  Sheesh!  And theyre so loud!  So to pass the time, I decided to update my blog, because its not like I have anything better to do.  Today was fairly good... band was okay... guess were going to play Jupiter, which is alright.  Its a cool song and all, just not very much fun to play- at least my part.  Then there was the pep rally... a complete waste of time for us pit kids.  I got some study time for Spanish, though, so that was good.  Then went to Spanish... Martin wasnt at school today so it was really boring : \  but the quiz was fairly easy.  Then went to World History.  Dixon was super cool and moved our test to tomorrow so we just reviewed and messed around for half the time today.  Always a fun class!  Chemistry was alright... took a test that I felt really confident about- just naming compounds, nomenclature stuff.  Tomorrow, we take another test, but it shouldnt be too hard, either.  BCIS was.... well, it was BCIS.  We took a test (*spazzes*) over MS Access.  Pretty much another waste of time.  The stuff is so easy and pointless it makes me sick.  hehe  Only homework I have is to study for Wd. Hist. and Chemistry.    Drum line competition tomorrow night at the high school!  Coppell at 10:20, Metro Alliance at 11!  If youd be able to help with Coppell props, let me know.  You wouldnt have to be there until like 9:30-9:45, and you can leave as soon as Coppell has performed.  Any help is appreciated...  Movies I Want To See: *Jungle Book 2 *How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days Anybody want to see them with me???  Apparently my friends dont care to see childrens movies or chick flicks.... little do they know, these movies are going to be really good.  Cool song alert!  It Began in Afrika  Chemical Brothers  (reminds me of the Afrika Corpse.. right Collin? hehe)  Well, I guess thats all for now!    Oh yeah,  I love rain.

      Dad brought home one of those Myers-Briggs personality tests from work to see if it would help me find something to do with my life (heh).  Apparently, Im an ESFJ.  The description says... Warmhearted, conscientious, and cooperative.  Want harmony in their environment, work with determination to establish it.  Like to work with others to complete tasks accurately and on time.  Loyal, follow through even in small matters.  Notice what others need in their day-by-day lives and try to provide it.  Want to be appreciated for who they are and for what they contribute.

      Hello everyone! Sorry I havent updated in a while.  Ive been busy and stuff- no time for my blog  Well, I cant exactly recap everything thats happened since my last post, so Ill just say that things have definitely been better.  But, oh well- everything will work out in time : )  So yesterday was Earth Day so I had to go to a stupid NHS trash pick-up... then went to IHOP for breakfast so that was yummy.  Then went home and showered and went to the galleria for a while.  Then I went to Godspell with Becca last night... it was really good.  But the weather sucked.  A lot.  I was really worried about my car... the hail was crazy!  So after Godspell was over, Becca and I hauled butt outside and it was too dark to see if there was any damage, but since I had parked under a tree, my car was coated in leaves.  I couldnt even see out of my back windshield.  So I took her home and my mom called me and was like HURRY HOME so I hurried home, only to find that the hail had broken one of our skylights, so there was a huge HOLE in our roof.  So my parents and I are standing outside in our driveway and the neighbors behind us come out and one of their skylights broke, too... so my dad and our neighbor went up onto each roof and put plastic over the holes and then buckets and trash bags and stuff on the floor in the house.  Then I go in my room, only to find that my window is leaking.  There was water everywhere.  So I went to bed a little while later, got up early this morning for sunday school and then just a few minutes ago, I went out to assess the damage on my car, so I grabbed some towels and a broom and had to sweep all the darn leaves off (my goodness, there were a lot) and then I could finally actually see my car!!!  Only to find that there are tons of little dents everywhere.  :*(   My mom felt bad, but there was nothing we couldve done about it.  Ohhhhhh well.  Todays gonna be a pretty lazy day- just church and homework.  Hopefully I can get some sleep since I havent gotten much at all this weekend.  Plus sectionals tomorrow : (  *sigh*  IS SCHOOL AMOST OVER?!?!??!?!  I cant take much more of it.  Cool song alert!  Evanescence  Going Under  Thats all for now!  Until next time.....

      yep.  my life sucks.  why the hell do i even try anymore.  with anything.  im so sick and tired of it all.  once things seem to be going alright for a while, it turns back to crap again.  so, whatever.  i'm just going to go sit in my corner and cry.  maybe i'll cut off my arm or something while i'm at it.  that would be fun.

      Yay- summer is finally here.  And I still cant believe that I dont have any homework to do!  What am I going to do with all this extra time?!?!?!  Oh wait... I know... I can go to band camp.  haha  Collin requested another blog update with memories of my childhood, so now that I have time to write it... here it is!  This is for you, Collin!  Lets see... heres a few that I just recently remembered.  When my sister and I were really little, we got in fights all the time... and they usually ended with me biting her.  Well, my sister realized that the only way I wouldnt bite her, was if she could somehow get me to apologize to her, instead of the other way around.  So one time, during one of our fights, she stormed in her closet and came out with her suitcase and started throwing clothes in it.  I started freaking out (I think I was about 5 years old...) and asked her what she was doing.  She told me she was running away because I hated her, and she was never going to come back, and I started sobbing and she ran out the front door.  So I start running down the street, screaming after her, crying like a maniac until she cant contain her laughter anymore.  When I realized she was kidding the whole time, I still bit her.  (so ha!)  The sad part to this story is that she was able to do this 4 times before I caught on and stopped believing her.  Boy, Im a moron.  After another one of the Bogeyman Camp episodes (see entry from May 11), my mom promised me ice cream from Dairy Queen.  So she goes to Albertsons real quick and I waited for her outside in the driveway (playing with my sidewalk chalk, as usual).  As shes pulling up into the driveway, I run to the car to get in the front seat, but before I can open the door, she thinks it would be funny to back up and drive away from me!  So she does, and I get confused because she like... drives down the street, leaving me in the dust.  So I chase after her, crying (boy, I seemed to cry a lot as a child...), but I cant keep up with her anymore, since shes going like 30, so I give up and go back home.  10 seconds later, she had circled around and, hysterically laughing, picked me up.  Boy was I mad at her.  Why was it that my family consistently found it funny to make me cry?!  Oh, oh.. and then there was the time when I was at Albertsons with my mom (back then, it was called Skaggs Alpha Beta- anybody here remember that??... it was like 13 or 14 years ago) and I was sitting in the shopping cart, and there was a fly, and.. for those of you who dont know, I have a problem with bugs, and it was really severe when I was little, so I start screaming and thrashing around because I cant get away from this fly, and the lady at the check-out counter said to my mom Lady, your daughter needs psychiatric help.  Was my mom pissed or what.  On a similar note, another time at the grocery store, I was in the shopping cart and my sister decided it would be a good idea to ride it (it was empty, btw), so she runs with it and then jumps on it, and it flips over because theres no weight in it to balance her out, and the shopping cart comes crashing down on top of her and I land on my head on the tile and am stuck underneath the shopping cart.  At the tender age of 10 months.  My mom freaked out majorly... its a good thing my skull didnt crack!  Needless to say, my sister wasnt exactly on good terms with my mom for a while.  After all, how could anybody hurt me and get away with it?!?! jk ; )  Alright, I cant think of any more.  This wasnt as good as my first memory entry, Collin, and I apologize.  Ill try to think of some better ones next time.  Cool song alert!!!!  Bob Schneider  Big Blue Sea  Adios mis amigos!

      Well, Im so bored and have left this thing sitting for a while, so heres an update!  Life hasnt been too bad lately  some days are pretty boring, but others are good.  Went jetskiing last week and Im going again tonight its such a blast and Im super excited!  We might be going camping this weekend, so Im sure thatll be fun, assuming the snake/spider factors are kept to a minimum.  haha  Vivians party was Saturday and that was fun (Happy Birthday, Viv!), then after hanging around at Kid Country for awhile, Charles, Habibi, Mooney, and I came to my house and played Taboo.  Such a fun game!  Well,  not when youre tired  We carhopped at Sonic on Sunday- a lot of fun, in my opinion!  I think Im gonna try to get a job at one of them as soon as I well, stop being lazy.  heh  Amys party was Monday (Happy Birthday to you, too, Ames!), so we swam there for a little while, then went to Chipotle, and then Charles and I went to go see 28 Days Later.  Pretty good movie- I kept seeing infected people running around in the dark when it was over.  lol  Lindsay came home from Germany yesterday- really excited about that.  Its nice having her back home and shes always got some interesting stories to tell.  Yesterday, I just hung out with her here at home, and then she went to bed after dinner (all tired from the jet lag stuff), so I met up with Charles at soccer.  Then we picked up Collin and hung out in Target playing with their super cool toys.  Today, were gonna go to some hotel and swim in their pool/hot tub and use their sauna.  Then, Charles, Mooney, and I are heading off with Kevin to go jetskiing!  Woohoo!  Hopefully, well go to the Ft. Worth zoo one of these days Ive got some Sprite cans for buy one ticket, get one free, so we could all go for half off (which is pretty cheap).  Lets see what else oh yeah- gonna have a picnic one of these days, too.  I guess thats all for now- if youve got any good ideas for some cheap summer fun, let me know!  Cool song alert!  Coldplay  Whisper  Thats all for now.  See you guys later!

      Due to the constant prodding of Nathan Guo, I am finally updating my blog.  I dont really have much to say.  I got back from Florida last Tuesday- we were there for our family vacation, and boy was I glad to get home.  It seemed like the trip would never end, and my parents were driving me up the WALL.  So I was very glad to be back home, but then, one day later, band camp started!  Woohoo.  It hasnt been too bad- it just takes up a lot of time and Im always too tired to do anything.  And apparently the 15 or so pit alternates are going to be marching in the show, so that should be interesting.  Now we have to go to the outdoor morning rehearsals *sigh*  Oh well, it was kinda fun yesterday, when we did all the drills.  Im proud to say I didnt mess up once!  And Mrs. Visconti even came to my spot and sprayed me down with water.  Mrs. Bohls left last night and shes going to be gone for the rest of band camp : (   With my luck, Ill break my reed tomorrow or something, and then Ill be screwed forever.  Ill have to *gasp* buy one of the crappy ones from Brook Mays!  Oh no!  That would be horrendous.  Come back, Mrs. Bohls!  Oh, but I get Vivians oboe sometime soon!!  So Im excited about that, because mine from last year suffered from a minor incident and is now not playing.  So I guess you would call that a major incident.  Heh.  Oh, I thought of another childhood memory for you, Collin.  When I was little, my family and I went out to eat at this Italian restaurant, and when they brought us the bread, they brought those little cups of butter, too.  Well, my sister told me that instead of butter, it was a little scoop of vanilla ice cream, so, being the gullible person that I am, I ate the entire scoop in one bite.  And omg, I can still taste how incredibly awful it was.  I never really got back at her for that one *evil laugh*  Well, thats all I have for now.  If Nathan keeps bugging me, Ill probably start updating this regularly again.  Hope everyone has a nice Sunday off from band camp!  Heres a couple cool song alerts Justin Timberlake  Rock Your Body Led Zeppelin  Dyer Maker Jason Mraz  You and I Both (Thanks for the cd, Tasha!)

      Hello everyone.  Here is another update! (Thats 2 in a row.)  I dont really have much to say, but Ill try my hardest to make this a long one to suit everyones needs.  Im so glad this past week is over.  It sucked the big one.  Between projects, lab reports, essays, band, etc etc, I was way too busy.  Friday was even a crappy day, even though it was Homecoming.  But its all over now : )    Yesterday was a lot of fun.  Charles and I met up with Nick, Tasha, Ross, and Chelsea to see Matchstick Men (which was really good) and then we went out to eat at Macaroni Grill.  We had an awesome time, so hooray!  Then lets see Chelsea had other plans so she had to go and we all just kinda split up, and then Mooney joined me and Charles and we went to Marble Slab for some ice cream.  Then, we walked around at Andy Brown East for a while.  So, all in all, it was a good day.  I just got back from teaching Sunday School this morning and that was fun.  But now I have to do tons of homework : \  Then church tonight, so thats pretty much my day.  I have a feeling next week is going to be another sucky one, just by looking at Blackboard and seeing the upcoming homework.  Plus band and the stupid NHS induction ceremony on Monday after band (a wasted hour).  Oh well.  No game on Friday, so thats kinda nice, although it means Saturday is gonna be wasted.  And to anyone confused, on my last entry, I did not mean to say Guster  Amsterdam.  I meant to say what I did say, which was Coldplay.  Im not that stupid.  Yep, so I dont really have anything else to say.  This, Nathan, is why I dont update my blog very often.  Theres just nothing to say.  Oh well. I guess I should get started on my homework.  I hope everyone had a great weekend and has a great week!

      First song I hear when I get in my car this morning... couldn't believe how fitting it was to my life right now...   sometimes it's embarrassing to talk to you, to hold a conversation with the only one who sees right through this version of myself i try to hide behind, i'll bury my face bacause my disgrace will leave me terrified and sometimes i'm so thankful for our loyalty, your love regardless of the mistakes i make will spoil me, my confidence is, in a sense, a gift you've given me and i'm satisfied to realize you're all i'll ever need, you looked into my life and never stopped and you're thinking all my thoughts are so simple, but so beautiful, and you recite my words right back to me before i even speak, you let me know, i am understood, and sometimes i spend my time just trying to escape i work so hard, so desperately, in an attempt to create space cause i want distance from the utmost important thing i know, i see your love, then turn my back, and beg for you to go, you're the only one who understands completely you're the only one who knows me yet still loves completely, and sometimes the place i'm at is at a loss for words, if i think of something worthy, i know that it's already yours, and through the times i've faded and you've outlined me again, you've just patiently waited, to bring me back and then the noise has broken my defense, let me embrace salvation, your voice has broken my defense, let me embrace salvation    relient K - "i am understood?"   Have a good day.

      My favorite band of the moment (Coldplay is still my most favoritist...) is RELIENT K!  They are so awesome.  Christmas album coming out this Tuesday!!!  I am so getting it.   when i made up my mind and my heart along with that to live not for myself but yet for god somebody said do you know what you are getting yourself into when i finally ironed out all of my priorities and asked god to remove the doubt that makes me so unsure of these things i ask myself i ask myself do you know what you are getting yourself into i'm getting into you because you got to me in a way words can't describe i'm getting into you because i've got to be you're essential to survive i'm gonna love you with my life when he looked at me and said i kind of view you as a son and for a second our eyes met and i met that with a question do you know what you are getting yourself into i'm getting into you because you got to me in a way words can't describe i'm getting into you because i've got to be you're essential to survive i'm gonna love you with my life i've been a liar and i'll never amount to the kind of person you deserve to worship you you say you will not dewll on what i did but rather what i'll do, you say i love you and that's what you are getting yourself into   relient K - "getting into you"  Yay.  Go band!  Yeah!  Come support the drumline this Saturday at Marcus HS.  Not sure of the time yet... I'll post it as soon as I know.  Have a good exam week and good luck to everyone going to region orchestra try-outs.  Let's show Duncanville who's boss.

      Alright ladies and gents... It's time for another update!!!  *game show music*  Soooooo yeah- woohoo!  I guess I will update you all on my life as of today, November 16.  Nothing too out of the ordinary.  I got first chair at region orchestra so I get to go to Area... me and Leah are going all the way!  Congrats to Lauren, too- we owned them all : )  Cowboys won the football game yesterday.. *sigh*  Oh well- I have orchestra next weekend so I don't have to go to the game anyways.  So all of you should try really really really really hard to come to the concert Saturday @ 4.  I'll be in the last orchestra to perform so even if you can come late, still come!  Nimitz HS.  Be there.  New tri started.  So far, it's easier than last tri because PreAP Physics was replaced by regular Pre-Cal.  And wow.  What a dumb class.  I should have taken PreAP but, considering my class load, I just wanted to take one regular class that I could semi-blow off.  Band has been kinda sucky.  I hate playing for Mason, mostly because he doesn't know anything about oboes, so I just get yelled at for things that I'm doing correctly, but he thinks should be done differently.  The day of orchestra try-outs, he told me that it was "too late" and there was "nothing I could do at this point", and then I got 1st chair.  Take that!  Oh well.  Got my solo the other day- I totally love it, so that's good.  It's much more exciting to practice than the all-state stuff.  Let's see... what else... I saw Matrix Revolutions at the IMAX on Friday- that was pretty cool, although we had to sit in the front and my neck was killing me by the end.  Went to CiCi's and Kid Country last night after the football game.  That was a lot of fun... Chmiel is a crazy kid and I was glad I invited him along.  You should hang out with us more often, Clayton!  I'm soooo looking forward to Thanksgiving break.  I need to clean my room and do nothing but sleep and have fun.  Just one more week :D  Cool song alert! "Dare You to Move" - Switchfoot "Hey Ya" - Outkast     Alrighty, I'll see you cool kids later.  Have a great day!

      Hello all!  I am back with a vengeance.  So watch out!  Actually, I dont have much to say.  This last week of school totally blows- I have so much to do in every class and Im very impatiently waiting for it to finally end.  I didnt go to school today... Im not sick, just needed a break and some time to catch up on schoolwork.  I made Area, so thats another thing I have to worry about... gotta practice a lot over the Christmas break.  Im afraid Ill keep putting it off, so you should crack down on me and send me lots of IMs telling me to go practice!  And Leah, Im counting on you!  You and me are going all the way.  Or, at least just you : )  A special hello to my friend Habibi!  Hello Habibi!  Made a cake with Charles this past weekend... it was slightly a disaster, but fun (and tasty) nonetheless.  I recommend it for all you bored people that dont know what to do with yourselves.  Also, we saw Somethings Gotta Give, that new Jack Nicholson movie.  I totally loved it, although it was a little slow at first and the ending couldve been shortened down a lot.  Still good, though.  So, really, my life is consisting solely of school right now.  An essay, test, and lots of homework in Spanish.  Lots of essays and stupid interview projects in Challenge.  OH!  And a project for over the Christmas break.  Mr. Griffin decided to split up the history test into two parts so I have the first part this Friday and need to learn 52 IDs by then.  And Pre-Cal just sucks.  Im kinda lost and its just... a boring class.  Honor band is touring the middle schools this Thursday so I get to miss school... but it means more make-up work : \  Also, the big Ireland fundraiser night is Thursday, so that should be fun, except for the fact that I have an APUSH test the next day, so I have a feeling Ill be leaving pretty early.  Everyone come, though!  6:30-10 (I think)!  Im very disappointed with the plethora of Gilmore Girls and One Tree Hill reruns!  What is up with that???  I make it through each week knowing that on Tuesday, Ill get to watch my favorite shows... and for the past 3 weeks, theyve all been reruns.  Stupid WB.  Oh well, life goes on I suppose.  *laughs at Saddam*  teehee.  Sucks to be you!  Alrighty, well thats all for now.  Oh yeah, Charles is the bestest!!  Cool song alert!!  relient K  12 Days of Christmas  Have a fantastic last week of school, everyone!

      Yay Im finally updating again!  I know you all are so excited and proud of me.  Lets see... what has happened since my last post...  Christmas!  It was a fantastic Christmas.  I got tons of clothes which I was totally thrilled about, naturally.  Also got a portable DVD player, which, oddly enough, I am using all the time and love it so much!  Other random stuff... DVDs, purses, a wallet, etc.  All in all, a success.  Everybody that I got a gift for liked it, so I was happy about that.  Charles got me the coolest present- Paul Frank pajama pants (soooo cute and comfy!) and a Jesus is my homeboy t-shirt.  Awesome!!!  I cant wait to go get a pink Mary is my homegirl shirt to complete the set.  hehe  Went to Medieval Times with Charles and his mom this past Sunday.  I had only been one other time in 6th grade (maybe? sometime in middle school, at least.) and it was a lot of fun.  We saw Nick Morgan working there and he hooked us up with tickets to the Torture Chamber (oooooo... scary!  Actually, I felt sick to my stomach afterwards... pretty gruesome stuff) and a fake rose with a light inside so it glows when you turn it on!  Very cool.  I have daily lesson thingies with Mr. Pace this week for Area tryouts.... it SUCKS!  Not only do I have to wake up early, but I have to go to the band hall over my Christmas break, and play and suck it up because I havent played in so long.  Oh well.  Its actually made me practice and Im feeling much more confident and playing everything much better than I was before Christmas break.  So thats a plus.  Im still trying not to get my hopes up about making state though... Im afraid of being let down if I dont make it (which is a very huge and likely possibility).  Mr. Pace is actually not as bad as I thought hed be.  Hes very complimentary and has even given me some good practice ideas.  Although I dont agree with everything he says, he has some insights that I hadnt thought of before.  Yesterday, after practicing at the band hall in the morning, Charles, Bob, and I went to the Local Diner to get some lunch.  Then we took Bob home and Charles and I went rollerblading at Andy Brown East.  So much fun!  Charles fell three times and I didnt fall once (but we wont say anything about that, now will we, Charles *wink wink*)  hehe... nm... Anyways, then we went to his house for a little while, then my house.  We sat around, bored as could be, and then he went home to eat dinner.  He came back later and then David and Shelly came over and we played Taboo.  Then Charles started feeling really sick : (  David and Shelly left to go to Starbucks and shortly afterwards, Charles went home because he was feeling so awful.  And sure enough, he threw up last night and is really sick today, so get better Charles!!!!    I didnt do much today since Charles was sick.  I actually resorted to doing homework, and I practiced for a while.  Watched some TV (Trading Spaces, While You Were Out, Clean Sweep- yay for redecorating shows on TLC!!!).  Collin gets home tomorrow (YAYYYYY!!!!!!!!) and then a rockin New Years Eve party at Rosss!  So, hopefully tomorrow will be better than today, assuming Charles gets all better. *fingers crossed*  Not really anything else to say.  I hope everyone is having a relaxing and enjoyable Christmas break.  Sadly, theres only 5 days left... Oh well, Ill try not to think about it!  Cool song alert!  Coldplay  Shiver  Bye bye everyone!

      Hey everyone!  A lot has happened since my last update, and needless to say, I'm feeling much better about everything.  I still am having a lot of lows in my life right now, but things are gradually looking on the up-and-up, so yay for that!  Region band this weekend.  Blah.  I didn't like the conductor very much.  And it just wasn't exciting at all- thank goodness for Leah and being able to pass notes to each other!  What else... I went to Arby's and Main Event on Thursday after school with Charles, Leah, Danny, Kevin, and Ross.  Very fun, though we stayed at Main Event for a loooong time... bowling and playing video games and everything.  Saw Vivian, Travis, Eric, Tim, and Ryan there.  I miss you, Vivian, and I wish you could come to San Antonio with me!  Friday, I bought Electronic Clue and Charles and I played it- I really like it, except it's more fun with more than 2 people.  Then we went to region band, and afterwards, went to Chili's with a whole bunch of people.  Apparently, most people are in agreement that Leah's laugh and my laugh come together and you can hear tuning beats in the combination.  You guys are so mean!  Anyways, Saturday was spent at region band... Charles and I joined Chelsea and Ross at Ross's house during our dinner break and we played Electronic Clue and ate pizza before heading back to the high school for the concert.  The concert went fairly well- I was just thrilled that it was over!  We went to Marble Slab for some naturally yummy ice cream and then went over to Mallory Golding's house for a little bit.  Aaaaand that brings us to today- Sunday.  I went to church this morning, then taught Sunday School, and then came home and sat around for a looooong time.  I watched a lot of TV (I'm so lazy!) and then Charles could do stuff, so we went over to Kevin's because he was having a party.  Not too exciting, but it was better than sitting at my house doing nothing.  Wow... I bet you were totally into that whole update and now your life is complete.  I don't really have much else to say.  Yay for making all-state!  I'm very very very excited about it.  Leah, I will miss you VERY much while I am there... and don't worry, I'll be sure to at least give all the piccolos really mean looks.  To everyone else who didn't make state, congrats... getting to area is quite an achievement!  I guess thats it.  Until next time!  Cool song alert!  Kelis - "Milkshake"  (Martin- damn right...)

      In response to David's blog:  If you have faith, would you not do charitable things in your effort to be like Jesus?  I do not believe that I "earn" grace from God, but that I can pass that love on to others through good deeds and "works".  After all, how can anyone call themselves a Christian if they do not try to emulate Christ?  And Jesus spent his life serving others.  Ephesians 2:8-9 references good works to say that we should not use outward actions to "boast" to others in order to make people think we're better people.  Grace comes from God and our faith in Him... yet our faith in Him should then lead us to serving others through good works.    "What does it profit, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but does not have works?  Can faith save him?... faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead... You believe that there is one God.  You do well.  Even the demons believe- and tremble!...by works faith was made perfect...a man is justified by works, and not by faith only... For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also." James 2:14-26  (didn't feel like typing it all out)  As far as predestination/free will, I believe God has his plan for us all laid out, yet we choose whether or not we follow that plan.  Just felt in a religious debate kinda mood, and this is supposed to be my "outlet" or whatever, so there ya go!  Have a good day-  Things are better.  Lissa

      Hello all-  It has been quite a long time since my last update, so here I am to quench your Melissa thirst!  lol  Spring break was incredible... I will never forget the awful food in Ireland and the amazing experiences in London!  And to top it off, Sara Beth and I were the best banner holders ever, if I do say so myself.  Check out my pictures  urlLink here!  ... I'll add more as soon as I scan the ones I took with my disposable.  After a slight setback in prom plans, I think we've finally got everything worked out, and I'm getting very excited!  We're going with Ross and Chelsea, Nick and Mal, and Michelle and her date, whoever that may be.  It will be so much fun!  Except I still don't have a dress yet... I think Becca and I are going on Friday (after getting our nails done!- Jesuit prom is Saturday) to look and hopefully hopefully hopefully I will find one that I like.  Charles took me to the zoo yesterday!  It was so much fun, and the weather was perfect.  Zoo pictures are up on Yahoo as well.  I fell asleep on the drive home and was awakened by Charles, saying "Melissa?  Are we supposed to be here?".  I look up to see we've somehow managed to make a complete circle around Dallas and were then driving straight through it.  No big deal, just took the scenic route home.  It sure made me laugh a lot : )  We met up with Ross, Chelsea, and Collin last night and saw "Starsky and Hutch" at Studio Movie Grille (very cool place and a very funny movie!).  So all in all, a good day!  My birthday is quickly approaching... everybody mark your calendars for Tuesday!  At last... I'll be able to see an R-rated movie legally without having to mess with sneaking in or running past employees (good times, Clayton).  That's all for now- I hope everyone has a good week!!  4-day weekend coming up... I think I'll start counting down the days.  Cool song alert!  "La Taberna del Buda" --- best Spanish oral ever.  Lissa

      Hello all!  I am updating from the house of Habibi.  So that makes this post all the more exciting.  Today, I took the SAT and holy crap, I thought it would never end.  Afterwards, I laid around my house for a while and eventually forced Charles to come over.  Theeeen, we got stuff to bleach his hair, and did that... which didn't turn out like it was supposed to.  So then we ate Chick-fil-A and met up with Mooney and Collin so that Charles could dye his hair blue (in order to cover up the crappy bleach).  Went to Sonic and Habibi and Cockerham were there, so we went to Main Event and bowled.  And now here I am!  It's going to be so boring tomorrow, since it's a Sunday and normally on Sundays I do my homework... but I have no homework!  Hopefully I'll find something constructive to do.  So I decided I'm going to buy a webcam so that I can not only talk, but  see  all my friends when they go off to college!  Charles's idea : )  Got a job interview thingy at Firehouse Wings Monday night.  I hope I hope I hope I get hired.  I need a job (and money) so badly because I cannot keep asking my parents all the time!  Well, that's all I have for now- until next time!  No cool song alert, because well... I just can't think of anything right now.  Adios- Melissa

      Oh yes, ladies and gentlemen - I'm back, and with a vengeance, so watch out!  Okay, so... catching up since my last real post...  I turned 17, so yay for that!  Then, school and band overtook my life.  Between honor band and bazillion projects/tests in my classes, I wasn't all too happy.  But then we had exams (which were not bad at all, considering I only had 2).  And then state solo contest was this past weekend.  I got a 1, so at least that ended on a good note.  We had lots of fun too :)  Awesome roomies! (Lisa, Leah, Jessica)  There's going to be so much band this summer, omg.  Sectionals every Thursday, leadership stuff this Friday, 2 percussion camps, leadership camp, full band camp, asldkfjalsdkjfalsdkjf.  Oh well - at least Lisa is the flute section leader!!  And we will have oodles of fun because we are SENIORS and All-State buds.  Graduation was today... it wasn't as long as I thought, but it was still long enough, that's for sure.  It was so crazy to see almost every one of my friends walk across the stage.  In the past, it's always been sad for me to see people leave (like Vivian, Kate, Mary, Habibi, etc.), but I didn't get nearly as upset as this year.  I didn't cry or anything, but my mind was racing- it's so weird for me to think that these people who I surround myself with all the time, every day, will be gone from my life (possibly forever) in a couple short months.  It will be a major, and involuntary, change for me.  I don't want any of you guys to leave!  And though everybody always says this, please stay in touch.  So, I thought I'd mention all of my graduating friends and thank you each individually for the impact you've had on my life and what you've meant (and still mean) to me.  *Wow, I'm starting to tear up as I write this...*   Charles:  not much to put in words- I think you know what you mean to me.  Thank you so much for all the incredible memories and for being my best friend.  I will miss you immensely next year- don't ever forget me :)  Leah:  I've known you for 3 years, and every year, we've gotten closer.  You are an AWESOME girl and I love you to death.  I still remember making fun of Russ in 2nd band my freshman year with you... we've been friends ever since!  I'll miss sitting next to you in band next year.  Just make sure you come back and visit me (and Lisa)!  Ross:  Dude.  You rock.  Remember when we went to Homecoming together my freshman year?  I barely knew you- yet Rebecca insisted we go together!  The start of our friendship :D  My Catholic pal and an all-around GREAT guy, I will miss you bunches next year.  But I will see you when I join you at A&M!!  And we'll throw rockin' parties.  Mooney:  Moonerz - you are incredible.  You have the world in your hands and are capable of  anything - never forget that!  Good luck at MIT next year.  I know I will see you in the future (when we're teaching in the same school district, duh)!  Nick, Disen, Bob, and Liz:  Nicky poo and Disen- thanks for making drumline one of the best experiences of my life!  You will be GREATLY missed next year.  Bob and Liz- go double reeds!  Though you left me, Liz (*tear*), we still had a lot of fun times.  Be sure to come back and support the  new  drumline!  Danny and Nathan:  I had a great time with you guys at All-State!  You two are hilarious.  Thanks for the fun times... Danny, stay out of trouble with the Marines, and Nathan, high five!  Eric:  We've had some... well... humorous memories (oh, those middle school years).  I will always be able to look back on that and laugh!  And remember when you go to college: church every Sunday.  No excuses.  Good luck at Purdue and with the rest of your life.. don't forget your best pal, though!  Good luck to everyone next year, with whatever you do, but come back and visit me in this lovely town of Coppell (though I know you'll probably want to get as far away as possible).  Thanks for the good times.  I love you all!  And, as usual... Cool song alert! Hoobastank - "The Reason"  (I don't know why, but I cannot seem to get this song out of my head!)  Until next time, this is Melissa signing off!  *This post is dedicated to my sister Lindsay who bothered me enough to update this thing.
