      "you can stay with us if you want" asked kai. but rook declined "Ok, well, be careful especially with your wound." kai gave her a light hug, as not to hurt the wound. then both cain and her left and went to her dwelling.

      Anthony Vecchiono looked differently from the last time Dominick had seen him. His dark hair was longer, framing his heart shaped face. Deep, chocolate eyes were widened in shock. He was a tall and willowly boy, now 18. A rosery was about his neck, long and couloured pearl. "Dominick?"

"ok, you really shouldn't move around alot....like when you are making out with jack, your special someone...it'll cause pain...for me and cain already found that out...for you wound is right where cain's is."

      Quingar watched, excited, as the door handle turned. Chance opened the door, and gasped. "Hello, dear cousin." Quingar said. "Let's cut right to the chase. You've had my men killed. I cared about them. Now it's your turn." He laughed, and opened one of Chance's closets. Something fell out. Chance's eyes brimmed with tears when he saw what it was. Skyler's body, a katana sticking out of the back of her head.

      Dominick sat on the same bed he had sat on three years ago. The place was dark and there were papers lying on the floor. The window was wide open, a bird flew by. Dominick jumped when he heard a key turn in the door's lock.

      kai knocked on rooks door. "Rook, hello, are you alright?!" she called. her sensitive ears picked up pain causing moans. she turned the knob and saw her there, injured. she rushed to her side. "we need to get you to the hospital.."

      the kiss was deep and amorous. "ah!"cain pulled his lips away. pain was in his injured shoulder.  "Are you ok? we should stop, it's causing pain in your injured shoulder."  "no, i'm fine.." he tried to resume what they were doing but kai placed her finger to his lips.  "no, your not-"  cain had pushed her finger away and captured her lips with his own, cutting her off. she could not resist..she had to kiss him back...then she had built up enough self control and pushed him away.  "illegal use of lips!"  he looked at her with these eyes...that weakened her  "..am i not a good kisser?.."  'yes,yes,yes you are!' she thought, '..must not give in....' but those eyes...and lips...they taunted her...  his lips brushed her, he then kissed her lightly, slowly getting deeper...  she gave up...she could no longer take it...she had to kiss back...  but then, she felt a sharp pain in her head. she broke the kiss.  "..i told you i'm fine..."  "No, it's not that...i have a feeling...about rook...i think we should go back over there...i think she's in trouble..."  cain agreed-even thought he didn't want to but he had to-. they left and rode one of kai's motorbikes to her living...space thingy.

      Iye leaned on the window, breathing heavily. She took hold the arrow in her shoulder, took another breath, then yanked it out. She screamed, hot tears searing in her eyes. Taking hold of the one in her chest she sobbed once and pulled it out, a scream catching in her breath. Iye braced herself on the window, covering the wound on her stomache, trying to reach the phone. She got to it, slumping over on the couch and dialing Kai's number. No answer. Iye went to stand but let out another scream of mingled pain and frustration as another spasm racked her body. Her breathing grew shallow, her vision blurred.  Chance...?  she thought  Jack! Kai?em> but no one was there, she was talking to air.

      Caige stood up and aimed her loaded crossbow.  "this shot might kill you...most likely will. it was nice meeting and i'm not going to  hurt  my mother dearest," she paused, "i'm going to kill her.." she fired and teh arrow hit rooks chest, just to teh left of rooks heart. "my aim always seems to fall to the left...ah well.."  caige the walked to teh door and turned to rook and smiled. then exited the room. she left rook there, without a care, bleeding.

      Iye sneered at her, "You're not leaving here alive," She moved back into defensive, "I will not allow you to hurt Kai," Iye then pounced, tackling the girl and sitting on top of her, blade to her throat and a hand on her stomache.

      they fell over-cain lying on his side and kai on her back. Cain felt pain in his shoulder from the wound, but ignored it. cain then left trails of butterflies down to her neck. then buried his head, kissing her neck ever so gently. "aishiteru.."she whispered into cain's ear. her voice so soft and elegant.  cain lifted his head and took a breath. he looked down at her lovely face in the moon's glow that was shining from the bay window. "mio amore....i l'amerà sempre, lei sono per sempre nel mio cuore.." -my love....i will always love you, you are forever in my heart...- he touched her face lightly, then brought her head up to his- causing her to sit up a little-and they kissed once more. cain held her head in his hands. she rested her arms on his shoulders-minding his injured one.

       Quingar was having a fashion show with Chance's clothes. He pulled a few looks, like "Magnum" and "Blue Steel". He set Chance's CD player to play "Wake Me Up Before You Go-go" by George Micheal, and used the catwalk Chance had, which was surrounded by walls made of mirrors, to have a see what he looked like.

      they reached her house and kai went into the bathroom to change. Cain sat on the couch. She came out wearing green plaid guy's boxers and a tank. "Do you want to change, i do have extra guy's clothes." Cain didn't have a shirt on so...yea.. "That's fine, don't worry bout it." kai snuggled up to cain on the couch. "i hearts you...." she whispered. "and i you.."

      Chance stared at the pile of rubble that used to be his house. He laughed. Before long he was in hysterics. He was laughing because his father had died in that fire. Still sniggering, he picked his way through the rubbish until he got to the in-ground door that led to the basement. He wrenched the door open, descended the steps, and sat near one of the three windows. It was dirty, there was dust floating in the air, and slight noises in the back of the cellar. Dismising them as rats, Chance pulled a small book out of his pocket and started to read.

      it was getting late. Cain then stood up. "Yes, i think it'd be best if we left. it is getting late." kai stood up, cain grabbed her hand. "..ok,"  then kai turned to rook and gave her a heart filled hug, like she did with chance. "as i said with chance-friend, please be careful and i hope your okay. i worry for my friends.."  then her and cain left. and walked to kai's house.

       Frankie goes to Hollywood's song "Relax" played through the room. Chance turned the sound on his phone down to the lowest setting without muting it.

      Chance pulled his cell phone out of the liner of his jacket, and two of his throwing stars fell to the floor. He picked them up, remembering that he had thrown one that time, and never got it back. He switched his phone back on. He sent a text message to Skyler: ^What u want? U called b-4, i was busy. u never call. must b imp. txt messg me bak.^ He avoided using real words on his phone. He sighed. It was true. Skyler never called. Something must of happened.

      Iye sipped at the tea for a moment before putting the cup back down. "Excuse me," she went to the bathroom and sat on the edge of the bathtub. Once again a headache was welling up inside and a sick feeling registering in her stomache. Shakily, she went to the medicine cabinet, taking out bottles of coloured pills.  One, two Freddie's coming for you  She opened a bottle and the pills spilled out  Three, four lock the door  They began to fall onto the floor, she bent to pick them up,  Five, six grab a crucifix  The doctor said they would make the pain go away,  Seven, eight stay up late  She coughed, slipping and falling to the floor, laying amongst them.  Nine, Ten...dead again ...Fade to black

      Quingar went through Chance's room. He had decided to do the job himself, and was waiting in Chance's room. Quingar had wanted to go through Chance's wardrobe, as they're both of the same size and build, but when he got there, he realized that the wardrobe was a different room. He decided to just stay in Chance's room. Posters covered every inch of wall space, including some on the ceiling. The most prominent one was painted directly onto the wall across from Chance's bed. It was a mural of scenes from the movie  Zoolander , and that is what most of the  posters were, too. On one wall, Chance had only pictures. Pictures of his family. Chance's mother, Quingar's Aunt Victoria, had the most pictures up there. Quingar noticed that there were no pictures of his oldest cousin, Charles, up there. He also noticed that there were very few pictures of Skyler, and even less of himself. There were also no pictures of Quingar's Uncle Gary, Chance's homophobic father. He finished lookng at the walls, and started on the desk.

      As Dominick sat in the gondola he sifted through his bag and pulled out a picture of one Anthony Vecchiono but to everyone else in the world this boy was known as "Vrintz". In the picture he was smiling faintly while sitting on an old building's stairs. Dominick sighed; that same building was coming into view.

The room was long and tall and big. ...now that i mention it...it kinda reminds of the room where what's her face from Kill Bill..the Japanese American Chinese lady chic and the other people of the ..gang type thing...were all sitting and congratulating the Asian mixed lady cause she the new boss of the Japanese gang thing and then that one dude like...didn't like so she decapitated him....that room..except...wasn't all...Japanese........right, i should prolly continue with the blog... well, it was sorta like that room. There were several people sitting around a long, rectangular table with Sacha sitting at the head..where Caige normally would sit..but she's dead now so she can't...well, she could still sit there...just have to prop her up...but then it would start to smell.....so..i wouldn't.....ok, i getting off track here...that's what ye get when ye type whatever comes out of ye head.... anywho........they were talking. Talking about Caige's death and who should be the new boss..thing...Now, Sacha was second in command, so she was chosen to be the new boss....lol....mob.....sorry, had a funny thought....back to the blog.....But there were a few that didn't feel that she should be the new boss....lol....mob boss.....anywho..yea, but they didn't say anything...or do anything.. "As the new head of this organization(i haven't come up with the name..or just have the org. be called UI28-10....idk......)the first order of business is to find the person who killed Adrienne Jean-Marie, also known as Caige, my friend and the previous leader of this organization." The other people talked and Sacha had gotten an idea. "Silence. Whoeve-" she stopped. then thought that she probably shouldn't tell them about her idea...not just yet. They all looked at her, waiting. She looked at all of them. "What are you all waiting for? We have got to find whoever killed Adrienne. Now off with you all. I have things to tend to." She got up, backed up and phased though the wall. She then walked over to the balcony area and looked over the crowd of dancing people. ~This is my club now...~she thought. she then  walked down to the floor, through the crowd of people and out of the club.  (...yo dude! i just notice something..and i wonder....)

      ooh la la creme one.......right..anywho..what was i talking about?...nvm, on with the blog.  wait..no one gonna come with kai? :( jeez, make her feel all loved. anywho, on with the blog.  it was a while later. Kai awoke in the hospital. her vision was a little fuzzy, but she could see well enough. she looked about the room. "How come i always find myself at the bloomin' hospital?" she asked herslef out loud.  Then she felt a sudden sickness in her stomach; a headache coming once again.  She shook her head and rubbed her temples. The feeling started to subside. "Hold up. I thought I head Rook's and Chance's voice before. Where the bloomin' are they?" The feeling came back. ~ok, i really have to get out of here.~ she thought.  Just as she srated to get up, she really started to feel sick. She plopped back down; groaning.  A sudden sharp pain shot through her stomach. she cried out in pain. she curled up into a ball on the hospitial bed. Her head became to pound harder. She felt like someone was beating upon her head with some heavy, blunt object. And that someone was stabbing her repeatedly in the gut with a sharp dagger of some sort.

      Quingar pushed Jean-Michel away. The Frenchman had only said that he thought Quingar should decide  how  to kill his cousin, a  different  way than last time. "Je manque comment vous aves atilise pour etre." Jean Michel said quietly. "That freakin' schoolboy'll never be back. Sometimes I get the feeling that we  used  to be best friends. That you want the schoolboy I  used  to be back." Jean-Michel pulled Quingar close. "Vous etes mo mei lleur ami." ~He's still upset with me." Quingar thought. ~He hates it more than anything when I don't listen to his opinions.~ Quingar put his arms around Jean-Michel, just like they used to&nbsp;do on cold nights at school.  ~~~~~~////Memories of Winter, begin.\\\\~~~~~~ Jean-Michel rested his head on Quingar's chest. Quingar was freezing. He had given Jean-Michel his jacket and sweater. ~But he does keep me warmer.~ he thought as Jean-Michel pulled himself close to Quingar, just short of laying on him. ~This stupid survival test'll kill him. He's fragile.~ Quingar felt guilty saying this, looking at the bruises and cuts he himself had made on Jean-Michel. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~~~~~////Memories of Winter, end.\\\\~~~~~~

      Her surroundings began to spin. "erg..."she was not feeling well, well, she wasn't feeling well to begin with; she was feeling worse. she fell down- she was lying down now. her head bagan to pound once more, a sick feeling brewing. she passed out again. but this time, she could feel things. A few moments later, she felt someone..could've been two people, she couldn't really tell, picked her up and laid her on another bed. The people who picked her up-the voices weren't familiar-were talking, asking questions. She didn't know what they were saying. She then thought she heard Rook's voice, then Chance's. She had a feeling someone else was there, but wasn't sure.  then, she was loosing the ability to feel. It was on and off, until she couldn't feel anything or one. She was totally passed out now. Her hearing was fading on and off. She tried to prevent herself from doing so, but it was too much. She gave up. She laid on the bed, motionless...again.

      Jean-Michel was curled up on the couch. He hadn't moved for hours. Everytime he tryed to, his neck hurt. He put his hand up to his neck and gingerly felt the bruises Quingar had left there. Quingar watched from the door to his bedroom. ~I don't know why he loves me so much.~ Jean-Micheal knew he was there. ~I don't know why I love him so much.~ Quingar slowly moved over to Jean-Michel and picked him up. Jean-Michel opened his mouth to say something, but Quingar shook his head. He layed Jean-Michel down on his bed, and went to get something to treat his slight injuries, and some ice for his neck. As he worked, he said "Jean-Michel........I'm sorry." "It's not your fault. You've never been able to control your temper." Quingar said something quietly. "What?" "I said.....I said.....you're...you're my best friend. My only friend. Nobody is more important to me than you. That's why I can't hang around you anymore."Jean-Michel's eyes filled with tears. "I don't want to hurt you anymore, Jeanny." "You haven't called me that for such a long time. But I will not&nbsp; leave. I do not want you to be alone." Quingar smiled, and nodded. As he turned to shut off the lights, he said "You have the most gorgeus eyes I've ever seen."

       Kai sat back up. She wiped her mouth. She attempted to speak again. At first it was mumbled. She then tried again. This time, it was understandable. "....Where the hell am I?....What happened?...."  Her vision cleared up a little but it was still was fuzzy and blurred. Her hearing on the other hand was better. They were sensitive, but she could hear well enough.

      kai could hear voices. they were faint and muffled-sounding. she couldn't understand what they were saying or tell to whom the voices the belonged to.  she tried to open her eyes. the most she could open them was to a slit. she saw a blur of colours and dark figures. her heard was pounding. she felt sick to her stomach.  she tried to speak, but when she barely opened her mouth, she felt like she was going to throw up. she moaned and groaned and hugged her stomach.  she had no idea where she was, when it was, how long she's been out, or what happened.

      Chance made a huge show out of pulling his trusting cell phone out of his pocket, and called someone who called the hospital for him.

      Iye could hear Chance's voice as she ran farther into the house, trying to find Kai. She finally came upon her, lying down with a bloody hand and a sake bottle. Iye went to her side, taking away the bottle, "Kai? Kai, can you hear me?"

      the sake had leaked onto the bed, creating a dark spot. Kai couldn't hear anything. she was totally out. There was a dark&nbsp;pool&nbsp;in the&nbsp;surrounding area of kai's right hand from the cut. it finally stopped bleeding.

      ((hey hey! Dani's compy works!!))  Iye and Jack ran down the street and through an alley or two. Iye had to stop every few blocks to catch her breath but soon they came to Kai's place. Jack knocked but there was no answer so they tried the kuh-nob. The door opened and moments later they were inside. "Kai?" Iye called, "Kai??"

      ( holy eeshna it works!!!!)   Kai got up and walked to the kitchen, blood dripping on the floor, leaving a trail behind. She came back with a big ol' bottle of sake in her left hand. She fell upon hr bed, chugging down the rice wine. (hey, i just realized that this kinda reminds of that country song -whiskey lullaby-...which i why i titled it that after i wrote this) [kai really isn't a big drinker. only drinks according to the occasion.]&nbsp; She choked and coughed as she pulled the bottle away, holding it by the neck. Sake saturated her breath and was on her clothes as well. Her visionand hearing became blurred. She was drifting in and out of consciousness. "......aishi...teru....lorehnce.....cain...." she mumbled before she passed totally out.

      Chance took Dominick's hand and pulled himself up. "Come on." he said. He led the way out of his house, and started down the road to Kai's. He pulled out a little mirror and looked at his hair. He made a face at how messed up it was, then put away his mirror, pulled out a brush, and started to fix his hair.

      Kai hugged her knees, slowly rocking back and forth; sniffling. She stared at the floor through tear-filled eyes, humming. She slipped her hand into the area between the bed and the headboard and pulled out a kunai. She held it in front of her, staring at it. She pressed the sharp edge against her palm of the other hand (her right hand). The blade's kiss was cold at first. She then added a little pressure and dragged it across her palm. It left a trail of blood behind. She set the kunai down upon the bed and watched the blood congeal. She then brought her scored hand over to the side of the bed and held it over the edge. She watched as one drop fell to the floor. She watched as more drops fell, splattering crimson on her wood floor. After about the fourth drop, she started to keep track&nbsp;on how many fell. "….five……six….seven…." she whispered. With her free hand she picked up the kunai, brought it to her lips, held it there for a second, and then licked off the copper-tasting sorrow. "…blood…how I love the taste…." She then put the kunai back in its hidden spot. She still kept count. ~….twelve…..~

      "Jack," said Iye, jumping out of bed, but falling back in pain. He caught her, saying, "Take it easy, love, i'll go with you." She nodded. Getting ready quickly they were soon on their way to Kai's.

      "...."she didn't respond. she just hung up the phone. she sat on the bed, knees to her chest, staring at noothing through tear filled eyes. a coaloge(sp????????) of a memory played through her mind.  ~~~~~~**********~~~~~~~~~~ /they sat, his arm around her, her head resting on his shoulder. she played with the hematite ring that was hung about her neck./  the image then cut to them running through the trees, away from them. "Run, Cain! Come on!" then it cut off to her, thrown over a guys shoulder. "NOOOOOOO!" she cried, stuggling to get free, reaching for Cain. he was held back by two other guys, reaching for her. "Doku!!!!" he grabbed the ring. he stuggled to get free as well. the guys pulled them away. the ring broke, one half in cain's hand, the other kai managed to catch with her one free hand. "NOOOO!

      Just then, her cell rang. She got up and walked over to wear she left her hat last. She answered the cell. "...Bonjour..............he is here! wonderful news!..... where is he?...there?!..*kinda gasp* i think he is looking for me......make sure he does not leave, i will be there momentarily...have someone pick me up...Au revoir" she hung up the phone, ran to the bath room and quickly changed. She then hurried out the door, grabbing her before leaving. She waited on the sidewalk until a black and silver chopper pulled up. She got on and on they drove to the UI-28-10. She didn't wait 'til they stopped. She jumped off, ran into the building-phasing through the wall. She saw one of her lackies(lol, lackies....that's a funny word) signal her. She nodded and then signaled them to surround him but not make it obvious. She walked up to him. He was sitting at the bar. He knew she was there so he turned around. "Bonjour father....." "Bonjour, my daughter....my you have gotten lovelier since I last saw you..."He grinned. She then conjured a butterfly. and that was there signal. there appeared from everywhere and formed a circle around him. He looked about them and laughed. "Shut up, you killed Adrienne, you daughter my half sister..." "Angry are we? She was going to kill her mother, and I couldn't let that happen" "But you impale her, did you not?!" "Yes, yes I did. But it did not kill her." "....I was going to end her life, for Adrienne....but I did not, something caused my mind to change..." "If you would have killed her, I would have to kill you.........what..or who...changed your mind?" "No one of your concern,  father ." She glared at him. "....au revoir,  father .." The circle of people attacked. He fought back and was doing quite well. The crowd of people who were dancing or whatnot started to scream and run away at this. They ran out of the club-chaos. She saw her people fall. She then took out a blue butterfly bomb and held it tightly in her hand. She ran to the doors, stopped and tossed the butterfly. She then quickly ran out of it's range. A tear ran down as she watched her club go down. She placed her hand ovr her heart for her club and people. Out of the smauldering rubble, he walked towards. "How could you have surviv-" She was cut short when a dagger impale her stomach. She fell to the ground, hands grasping the handle of the dagger. He laughed and walked to her fallen body. He kneeled down, took out a nicely folded handkerchief adn wipe off the blood that was dripping out of the side of her mouth. Just as he was about to speak, he was cut off when he felt a sharp pain in his chest. He looked down and saw that she had little life left and with all what was left she stabbed him. HIs blood dripped down the handle and her hands. He looked at her face, his eyes wide. "...au...re-..voir..." she thrust it foreward even more with what little strength she had left. Her hands fell and he fell ontop of her. Now both were dead.

      Iye looked Dominick in the eyes, not even noticing his new appearance. A look of disdain crossed her face and she looked away. "Leave me alone," she whispered. He stepped closer to her, "Poor, poor Iye." The Italian stopped just behind her, "If it's any consolation he died asking me not to harm you," Iye shuddered a sob, "you know," he continued, "you can just make it easier on yourself," he produced a switchblade from his pocket and handed it to her. Iye took it and looked at the metal shining with newly spilled blood. She pushed herself away from Jack and stood, turning to look at Dominick. "I'll kill you," she whispered so quietly it was almost inaudible. He smiled, "I'm sure you will," Just then, Iye rose the blade and lunged at him. He easily deflected it and grabbed her arm, tossing her aside. Moments later he had her from behind, holding her arms behind her back. When he spoke, his voice was heavy, close to her ear, "When i'm done here, care to know who i'm going after next?" Iye tried to get free but she hadn't the strength compared to him. "A bit of an irony i might say," he purred, "he'll never have a  Chance ," That gave Iye the strength she needed, that simple threat. She elbowed his rib cage, bringing her head back to smash it into his face. Dominick stumbled back, covering his now bleeding nose. Iye scrambled to grab the switchblade and came into a poised stance, ready to attack. Dominick laughed at her, "I wanted to take my time with this but it looks like you won't go down without a fight," He pulled the gun from his belt and aimed at her, "tell bunny-boy i said hi." The shot rang out in the silent apartment and for a moment things froze-until Dominick realized Iye was gone. He looked around but there was no sign of her. Then, as he took a step forward, he was stopped by a blade being pressed into his back. "Did you forget, Dominick, that i'm a jumper?" He grimaced, "Apparently so," with that he spun around quickly, taking her by surprise and shooting once more. Iye dodged and ran at him once more, this time grabbing his wrist and wrenching the weapon free. She picked it up, jumping back from him and aiming. He smiled at her, "What are you going to do? Shoot me?" Iye's hand shook but she kept aim. "Give me the gun, Iye," He took a step towards her, but she stepped back, "Don't come near me!" She screamed, but he didn't listen, he took another step, and it sent Iye over the edge. The shot hit Dominick square in the chest. His eyes widened and he mumbled something before touching the wound and looking at the new blood on his fingertips. But, it seemed that in that one moment, something changed about him. He looked up and at Iye, eyebrows creased in question as he asked, "Iye...what..." He stumbled back, against the wall, looking around, "how'd I get here..." he slowly sank to the ground, staring into Iye's bleu eyes, wanting answers. "Iye," he asked again but his voice was fading as his head fell, chin resting against his chest, "...t-tell Chance....I...." Dominick didn't finish sentance, instead he fell into an inconsceousness (sp?). Iye dropped the weapon, sinking to her knees, tears pooling in her eyes.

      Compared to the other writings in that book upon that desk, her latest writing was neat and easy to read. All the others were scratchy and full of anger, hatred. But the latest was full of love and the knowing that she's finally happy and nothing can go from bad to worse. ......if you flip through some more pages, past some blank past there will be a page with writing upon it. ' ......just do me on favor.............'    it was neat like the other one then the next few words are written in the same manner of the writings on the pages if the beginning of the book, ' kill ( Bill, lol...no this is really what it said) '.... Kill Daniel.....HUNT HIM DOWN AND RIP OUT HIS HEART! SHOW HIM    LOVE    THE WAY HE    LOVED    ME! .......'  This was written before the latest....so much hate.....and so much love...........i guess they really are the same emotion.......

      *(note: this has nothing to do with his death, i was planning to do this anyway..wasn't sure if i should...but oh well, it was fun...apart from the deaths..and people trying to kill us...and the crying and mourning.......while it lasted)  Kai then made up her mind. She couldn't take it anymore. She stood upon her bed and grabbed a book off her shelf. Her legs werent very stable, she was shking when she stood up. She then got up and walked-her legs sorta shaking still- over to her desk-though she was walking slow and she stumbled a few times. She opened it up to the next blank page and wrote something down**. She then walked over to her nightstand where she picked up a picture of him. She brought it over to the desk and set next to the open book. She stood there for a moment, staring at his picture through her red, tearing eyes. She stroked his cheek then lifted it up to her lips. She set it back down and then walked over and into the kitchen. She pulled out another bottle of sake. She poured some into a square sake cup, brought the bottle and the cup over to the desk and set them beside the picture. So there was the open book and to its right, the picture and to its right up at the north corner was the bottle and cup. She took a sip from the cup and set it back down in its place. She walked over to a closet type furniture and opened it up. There she pulled out his sword. She then walked over to the desk and set behind the book and picture. She walked over to her stereo, set to play "Whiskey Lullaby" a few minutes later. She, also, set it so it would repeat that song over and over....until someone turn it off. She walked over to her weapon closet and pulled out her sword.  She walked over to the middle of the ,unsheathing it along the way.  She held it high in both hands, and with all her might she............... Her body fell hard to the ground.  A red pool formed. The trail of tears upon her face, now fell to the floor and into the red pool. One last tear brimmed her eyes, it glided down her face and it dripped into the red below....now it was a pool of blood and tears. Then the song started to play... ""(guy)She put him out like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette She broke his heart, he spent his whole life tryin' to forget We watched him drink his pain away a little at a time But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind, Until the night. Chorus: He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger And finally drank away her memory Life is short but this time it was bigger Than the strength he had to get up off his knees We found him with his face down in the pillow With a note that said I'll love her 'til I die And when we buried him beneath the willow The angels sang a whiskey lullaby.

      It was later when Iye finally got home that night. The apartment was quiet and had the smell of her perfume. On the table to the right of the couch was a lone rose with a piece of paper that read :  bedroom.  Iye smiled, stripping of her coat and shoes, heading to the room. As she entered she realized that the writing on the paper wasn't Jack's. He lay there, on the white sheets, nestled to look as though he were asleep. She would've thought so if it were not for the many bleeding wounds on his body. Iye ran to his side, "Jack, Jack!" She brushed his hair from his eyes, noticing they were half lidded. "Jack, answer me, please!" His eyes flickered and he turned slightly to look up at her. "I-Iye," his voice, was quiet, gurgling. When he spoke blood dripped from the corner of his mouth. "Oh god, Jack," Tears brimmed her eyes, "what happened??" Jack just smiled, slightly, wincing, "Iye, i-i'm sorry," he coughed softly, "i di-didn't mean...to kiss her," Iye let out a sob, "No, no it's ok, it doesn't matter," Slowly, he lifted a bloody hand to caress her cheek, leaving a red trail behind, "I.....love you....Iye." He smiled once more, drawing her close for a kiss until his hand fell to his side, his body growing still. Iye sobbed, hugging Jack close and layed her head on his chest. "Jack," she sobbed, holding him close, "no," Then, from the corner, she heard, "Tut Tut, little bird, don't cry for someone who didn't deserve it." Iye turned to find that she wasn't alone in the room.

      Kai awoke, crying her eyes out. She had her knees bent up to her chest, her arms wrapped around them. She looked at clock on her nightstand. It read 12:17am. She then looked out the window, out at the nightsky. She stared at the stars and moon through tear filled eyes. She wouldn't last very long being the way she was. She couldn't sleep without waking up in tears, or without tears in her sleep. That's when she thought about Rook and Jack. ~..Rook, hang on to Jack......you guys still have each and have a chance to be with each other........~ she said loudly in her thought. ~Rook, don' end up like me........I have forever lost my love and I can't get it back...you still can......Rook, don' end up like a me...crying in your sleep, if ye can even get sleep for you always wake up tearing.........~ She sniffled and more tears streaming. ~..I don' know how long i can go on like this.........~

      Jack sat in the dark, fighting back the urge to just go and raid Iye's medicine closet, putting himself into a drug enduced coma might solve things...that or atleast stop how horrible he felt and end Iye's hatred. He shook his head, turning to look out the window. Just then there was a knock at the door. He didn't move. The door did, though, and a split second later, standing in the doorway was a much shorter haired Dominick. Jack looked at him, and noticed the weapon on his belt. Dominick closed the door and stood there, looking out the window. To break the silence, Jack asked, "What do you want?" The Italian smiled slyly, "Oh, nothing really." He walked slowly towards Jack, "I've just been thinking," Jack eyed him precariously as he drew closer. "And i figured, that, in the grand scheme of things," Dominick went to his belt and drew the gun, looking it over in a fake inquisitiveness, "you are  really  in the way." It was a flash of silver and bullets that lit the room. Jack was crouched into a corner, his arm bleeding from a bullet wound whereas Dominick stood only meters away, bleeding from where a shuriken embedded itself in his thigh. He smiled, once more, pulling the blade out and tossing it aside. "Come now, if you just hold still it won't hurt as much." Jack crouched even lower, "Like Hell i will," and with that he was off, speeding quickly towards the Italian, grabbing his legs and tackling him to the ground. Moments later he had scrambled on top of him, a blade to his throat. "I want you to leave and i want you to leave now," said Jack, the blade almost drawing blood. Dominick looked Jack in the eyes, daring him on but Jack did not respond. "A bleeding heart is not suitable for a ninja," said Dominick then suddenly he brought his knee up, smashing it into Jack's lower back. Jack fell to the ground, writhing from the momentary paralysis. Dominick grabbed his shirt and pulled him into a sitting position to slam him into the wall. The Italian pulled out a blade and flicked it in front of Jack, smiling at what he was intending to do.

      Stepping into his apartment, Dominick didn't even dare turn on the lights. Instead, he went straight to bed, falling into it and immediately alseep. However, it wasn't too soon after that he was tossing and turning, nightmares consuming him and he was falling into a deep abyss, hidden somewhere in his mind. ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* Later that night...  "Mmffm," Dominick rolled over in bed, slowly sitting up and looking around the place. "What the hell has he done  now. " he asked aloud. Getting out of bed and heading to the bathroom he flicked the lights on. " Oh Christ, " he said, looking at his hair, "Well, first things first i sup'ose." Sifting through the drawers he produced a pair of scissors. A few moments later he sported a shorter stlye, opposed to the once longer banged one. Stepping out of the bathroom he also changed his clothes. Instead of the white button up he wore a tighter black tee with a studded belt to hold up the baggy bleu jeans. Making one more stop her took the gun and switchblades from the dresser and headed out the door, mind working on a certain bunny-boy who lived nearby.

      "...Cain...." she whined. The memory faded and a dream began.     dDrReEaAmMsSeEqQuUeEnNcCeE  She felt warm, familiar arms wrap about her shoulders and a warm, familar breath upon her neck. She felt warm, familiar kisses upon the slope where her shoulders connect to her neck. She ran her fingers through his shoulder-length hair and that caused it to fall like curtains onto her shoulders. She put her head back and he kissed down to her collarbone. He left a trail of kisses up her neck and to her lips. She turned around and wrapped her arms around his neck. He picked her up and carried her over to soft area. He set her down gently. She pulled her lips away looked up at him. She looked deep into his eyes. He was looking straight back. Both there breathing were heavy. She lifted her hand and stroked his cheek. "L'amo, il mio amore. Saremo sempre insieme, niente mai ci non straccerà a parte. Lei tutto sono a me. L'amo. Un giorno sposeremo, e sarò per sempre il vostro. ....il mio amore, il mio amore, il mio amore..." "Aishiteru, koi....ai..shi...teru...." They smiled. He leaned down and they kissed.  dDrReEaAmMsSeEqQuUeEnNcCeEoOvVeErR

      Chance giggled. "Once, when Skyler was eleven, she was forced to be in her class play. She had to be a cricket that kept hitting the wrong notes. We called her a cricket ever since then. When we started living together, a got my tattoo in her honor. And when I get a new premisis for my club, I'm gonna call it "Una Tomba di Crickets" as a commemorative to her."

      Kai finshed the song and then got up. She then got up and crawled into bed. She stared up at the ceiling until her eyes became heavy and she fell asleep.     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  It was a bright, hot day. And laughter could be heard along with the roar of the waterfall. They were having a water fight. Splashing the cool refreshing water at eachother, creating tiny rainbows.  She screamed and he laughed. She went under to escape from the splashing. She came back up and he was gone. She looked about for him but did not see him. Just then, he jumped out of the water behind and tackled her, bringing her down into the water with him. They quickly swam up to the surface, laughing.  They swam to a shallow part of the lake place. and laid down in the warm sandy floor. She laid back down, head restin on his arm. He laid on his side, looking down at her. He smiled. She smiled too. He leaned down and kissed her. "I love you, Dokutoku..." She wrapped her arms around his neck and brought him to her and they kissed. she pulled away, "Aishiteru, Lorehnce..." he put his hand upon her lower back and they kissed again. This one was longer and more deep then before.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  At this memory in form of a dream, Kai cried in her sleep. She was not over him, and most likely will never get over him. He was the last thing she had left-besides her friends.

      Chance whispered the pasword, eyes on Quingar. He led Dominick up to the attic, which was actually quite cozy. It was painted scarlet, with squishy chairs and couches all over. A door opposite them had a silver plate with "Skyler" etched into it on it. "My favorite room, this is."

      After she was finished, she decided to call Rook. she picked up the phone and dialed her number-it was her machine. she figured it would be. " 'ello, Jack, I know ye there and I know that Rook isn't....anywho, Rook, hope ye ok, and remember I am always here for ye if ye need anything or one. Ja ne Rook, Ja ne Jack."

      Kai then changed her clothes. the ones she wearing had dried blood and whiskey on them. She put them in the washer. She walked over to her piano and wiped off the dust. It's been awhile since she last played. Sht sat down and started to play "Invention in C minor"

      Sacha finally got to her apartment. She took off her coat and crawled in to bed but she did not sleep. Instead, she laid awake, staring at the ceiling. she then grabbed her cell phone and called Iye. She got her machine. She left a message. ".....Iye..I am sorry....It is my fault. Do not get angry at Jack...I kissed him, not the other way around.....He obviously loves you very much...I am sorry......." she didn't know what else to say,"....sheet..." she  cursed, it was quiet but it was still audible. she then hung up. and continued staring at teh ceiling.

      "I told you, I don't know!" Quingar said. Jean-Michel just glared at him. "You 'ave to know why you be-ave in zee way you do." "Jeanny, I don't know, but I am so sorry, I can't believe I did that, and after...and after.....the morbid....." Jean-Michel's eyes got wide and tears started to fall. "You...you only sing zee mor-beed rhymes in German after you 'ave killed someone you 'ate." Quingar stood and said "I don't hate you......I never could.....I..I love you more than anything." Jean-Michel whipped around so his back was to Quingar. Quingar wrapped his arms around the French-man and said "Ich liebe dich, leibling." Jean-Michel was silent. "I know how to make you laugh..." He let go of Jean-Michel, then pinned him to the wall of Chance's house. Jean-Michel didn't even struggle. Quingar tilted his head forward slightly and totally seriously, yet with a slight smile on his face, he said "Schmecken sie den Rogenbegen.*" Jean-Michel burst out laughing. He fell into Quingar's arms. Quingar slowly sat down, pulling Jean-Michel down with him. ~Well.~ he thought happily ~It 'll be the only way for me to shut him up......okay, not the only way....but definetley the most appealing.~ Quingar put a finger to Jean-Michel's lips, and when Jean-Michel stopped laughing, out of shock, Quingar slowly kissed him. Jean-Michel broke away. "I love you, too, darling." Then Jean-Michel pressed his lips against Quingar's, happier than he had been since they had first been reunited.   *Taste the Rainbow

      (outside, a few minutes later in a park conveniently placed near the hospital...)  "Iye!" cried Jack, trying to catch up with her, "Wait!" She stopped, turning slightly to show him she was listening. "I told her i was with you, Iye, you have to believe me," Turning a bit more, to look at Jack, Iye said, "If you did why were you kissing her?" Jack sighed, "I wasn't, she kissed me just as you guys were coming in." This time it was Iye who sighed, "Just leave me alone, ok?" She started away again but was stopped by Jack. He had took her hand and said, "Remember in Russia when you hit me with the snowball?" Iye didn't respond, "I still have the picture," Jack took it out to show her, "I carry it all over with me, Iye. If i didn't care about you then i wouldn't have it." Iye took the picture, looking at the smiling girl then to Jack, "I remember," she said quietly, "but i...i just can't, Jack, not now." With that she ran away into the night, heading for home while Jack stood there watching her go, holding a picture of the girl he loved and betrayed.

      Jack didn't say anything but walked past everyone else, heading in Iye's direction.

      "..Rook..." she was going to stop her but she really need time alone. "...Just be careful and I love you, friend!" she called down the hall as she watched Iye leave. She turned back to the room. "......Shit...." Kai whispered. ".....I-...I did not know that Iye and Jack are a couple....I have to go and apologize....." she as she was about to leave, Kai stopped her. "....the last thing she needs is you to be anywhere near her.....just let her be, she needs to be alone..." "...but it is all my fault..Jack told me and-" "I know, I've read...just let Rook be..." Then Kai turned to Chance and gave him a big ol' hug. "Hi,friend"

      "Mmhm," Iye gave her half hearted hug, "I'm glad that you're alright," she looked away, back at the door, "Um...I, have to go, i'll come visit you later or something," Turning, Iye smiled at Chance and hugged him as well before walking out the door.

      "..Oh bloody hell, people...since no one's gonna tell me, I'll just read ye minds..." Kai barely had the strength to get up so reading peoples minds was just as hard but she did it. "Oh bloody bloomin' hell people!" She looked at all the faces and she sat up more. "So, let's see if I understand this." She looked to Chance. "Ok, Chance-friend, Dominick's your special someone I've been dying to find out who it was. Congradulations." She then looked at Iye and then at Jack. "So, this is Jack, Iye. Ok." She then looked at Sacha. "I have never met ye or heard about ye, Sacha. but ok. I now have everyone's names and who is with whom. Now," she began, "....ok...Ye three were coming back from signing in....we never signed in before?....ah, well, doesn't matter at the moment...." her eyes became wide ".....and when entering Sacha and Jack are found in a lip lock....." She sighed, trying to take in all the info. "Rook, I am soooo sorry!....I'll continueing reread cause there's more I need to know..." She re-read Sacha's mind, to find out more about her. As she read, she said it out loud-briefing "...ok.....Jack was intriguing....something about butterflies...the 1st kiss...Jack told her that he's already taken......hurt and humilation......someother things that I won't say cause there pretty personal and the whole world doesn't need to know.......ye come here-still in ye jammies.....Jack's here alone..well, besides me...."then her eyes became wide,"bloody hell!  ye sisters Adrienne and ye were going to kill me?!" "....I  was  suppose to, it was in my half-sisters last wishes but Jack-...and...." "..just let me finish reading..." she then continued. "....oh, yea, 'ere it is...I got ye.....the only person ye really want to see dead is...." she trailed off. "Oui" Sacha cut in. "My father......I know what he has done to you....I will not kill you but maybe, since we want the same person dead, we could help each other....." "...alright, he's such a big jack ass even his own daughter wants to see him dead.....ok, let's continue shall we..." she continued only to find out that that was it. "...ok..." she took a deep breath. she then look to Rook. "Rook-friend," she got up-though it was hard. and walked over to Rook and gave her a big hug. "Gomen nasai..."

      Sacha looked at all the faces. Her face was still red. "Iye....it's my fault.....I- Jack-" she didn't know what to do.

      ---feel the humilation--- Sacha closed her jacket and crossed her arms. She did not know what to do. She was just so embarrass.  She opened her mouth and tried to speak but nothing came out.  Kai strained to sit up and she finally did. She took a good look at Rook(it rhymed!) "Rook...are ye alright?..."

      Kai's eyes were wide....well, they were a slit sorta b/c she exuasted from waking up but she tried.... She had know idea what was going on or who the two people were at her bedside. "What the bloody hell's goin' on here? Who are you people?" she said looking at the two at her side. then she looked to the doorway, there she saw Iye, Chance and Dominick. "Where were ye?" she asked, talking to Iye and Rook. then she looked at Dommy(it shorter and faster to type) "What the hell's he doin' here?" she wiped her eyes. "I missed a whole lot while I was out...how long have I been out?..."She was so confused....among with other feelings. "....Someone needs to fill me in here until this point..."

      Jack pushed Sacha away, also deeply blushing, "Iye, I..." he trailed off, not really sure how to handle the situation. Iye didn't even care that he had used her real name, she just stood there, dumbstruck. An akward moment passed before pointed and said, though she was very quiet, "...Kai."

      still hanging onto to Jack, she pulled her lips away. Along with the dried tears, her face was fire engine red when she looked up to see Iye, Chance, and Dominick standing in the doorway.

      "I don't see why we had to sign in anyway," said Iye, as they walked down the hall. "I mean, it's not like we're going to slip any of these people Mickey's or anything," they turned, walking into Kai's room, "Half these people are passed out anywa-" Iye stopped short as her fell upon Jack and Sacha. Her eyes grew wide, taking the scene in. She didn't say anything but her left eye began to twitch.

      She walked up to him and put her finger to his lips. "I-I-I-......." She stammered. Tears became visible and she wiped them away. "....Monsieur...I-...I.......... Back home, in France, I had a boyfriend, Eric. We were fiances but then he was killed. Which is why I came here to America, to find his killer and avenge my Eric.....That was 3 years ago........" She took a breath, "...Then I found my half- sister*, we became friends and she made me 2nd in command to her and I was to have the UI28-10 if she ever died......And I was suppose to kill Kaizoku, it was in her last wishes,....But I could not...You were here, the intriguing thing was that you reminded so much of Eric......And you were right!, I was scared to touch! because I was afraid that I was going to....."She trailed off and took a deep breath, and finished her sentence".......I was afraid that I was going to......Fall in love again..........."She wiped away more tears, "...Then I came to the realization that I must let Eric go and move on and I did....And I...."She trailed off again. She leaned in and kissed him. She put her hand on his shoulder to stable herself.   (if only you people could see me now...*laughing uncontrollably*) (*ye guys prolly figured out that Adrienne and Sacha are sisters..well, half- same fathe, different mothers. now, Sacha is actually 19...while Adrienne like 15 but really is..what ever age i said she was..[can't remember] Adrienne did not know any of this. and there's more, but you'll soon find out...if Sacha ever tells...)

      ((they're already in Kai's room....um.....here, instant diversion...))  "Excuse me," a nurse came into the room, "you three have to come with me to sign in."  ((aaaand, the three go with her then enter Sacha))  Hearing his name, Jack turned around to see Sacha. "You....what are you doing here, madame?"

      After awhile she finally got to her destination-the hospital. She stopped and looked over the tall, big building. "How do i get in? I can not go in looking like this..." she whispered.  She then looked through her jacket. She found 1 red butterfly bomb. She crept to the doors and tossed in the butterfly. it let out the mist. she then ran inside grabbing the butterfly off the floor as she ran by to the elevator. She pushed the button for kai's floor. Blah blahblah- she gets there.  Sacha was visible.  she walked quickly down the hall and stopped abruptly in front of kai's door. She stopped only for a few minutes and put her head against the door to listen for other voices. it was quite. she looked both ways down the hall- clear. She took a deep breath and phased through. Only Jack and Kai were there. (tho, kai sorta  has  to be there) Jack's back was to her. "Jack...." she whispered.

      ".....what to do....what to do....." she whispered. "....I-I....think I  like  Jack....even love him..." She wiped away a tear. And picked up a picture of him. She looked at it lovingly and glided her fingers down the glass as if she was stroking his cheek."....I think it's time I have to finally let you go, Eric, after all this time.....I will never forget you, Eric.....You are always with me, afterall........" She opened her nightstand drawer and set the picture face down gently. "...Bye, ..Eric...." she then closed it. At the spur of the moment, she decided to go. She jumped out of bed grabbedone of her many coats. She didn't see what one she grabbed. She quickly put it on ran outside. The coat she grabbed stopped about mid-torso and her night gown was kinda sorta...well, more then half way from her knee. so it really didn't help much. She ran down the street barefoot.

      Her eyelids became heavy. They slowly fell then rose again. But finally, they were weighted down with sleep. The champagne glass fell loose from her grip and landed onto the soft rug below. Her eyes flickered crazily under their lids as she dreamt. They were dreams about a black-haired man with deep blue eyes. It was like looking through Sahca's eyes. There were no sound but he was laughing. He looked straight-at Sacha. His lips were moving and his hand gesturing for her to come over. The laughng gentleman was Eric. She ran toward him. He caught her, but the impact caused the both of them to fall over. Now both were laughing and having a merry time. He said something. His lips read- "I love you Sacha" ".....I love you, too, Jack......" She mumbled in her sleep. Realizing what she had said she shot up, hand covering her mouth. She brushed her hair back with her hand, running her fingers through. She did not know what to do.

      ~and to see Jack..~Sacha added in thought as she walked away. She walked down the street to her apartment. She shuffled through the dark until she reached her bathroom. There she switched on the light, and then changed into her silk night gown. She turned off the light and found her way throught the dark to her bed and settled in.

      (((fixed it))) Jean-Michel woke up, still half in the lake. He climbed out and sat on the bank.~ Who did that? I have only one relation here.........I don't want to believe it. But I will. This isn't the first time he's tried to kill me......~ Jean-Michel made his way back to his two-room apartment. He took a pair of scissors out of a drawer, and cut his hair off, so it was about jaw-line length. (((a little shorter than mine))) As he changed, he thought about Quingar. ~Where would he be? Eh, I'll just walk around for a bit, then go to his house.~ He shuffled out of his apartment, a full bottle of whiskey in his hand.

      d it out  She stopped. "...Just like Kaizoku, I have no one left.....but she has a chance to regain her friends...all of mine are dead....but having friends  not  be there is much worst then not having any friends, i suppose........." she turned around. "...You are lucky Chance, to have such friends and a lover who is not dead like my Eric or Kaizoku's Lorehnce......" Once again she started to walk away.

      She turned around to face them. She, too, had tears...not for the same reason as Chance..but they were the same thing..he had lost someone and so had she. She conjured a butterfly and it flit over to Chance, giving a peck on the cheek- a butterfly kiss. "I..did not mean to make you tear, monsieur Chance.....but you are not the only one that has lost someone very dear.....like for example,"she wiped away a stray tear, "your friend Kaizoku, she has lost someone she loves so dearly and it is killing her inside...almost literally......you would think her closest friends,"she looked at Rook, then to Chance, "..would be by her bedside and comfort her," she then looked at Dominick, "just as you are comforting Chance........but the only person comforting her is someone she has never met before...a total stranger......" She then wiped away another tear and started to walk away.
