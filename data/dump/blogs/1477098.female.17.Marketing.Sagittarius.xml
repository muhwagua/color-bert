      Hey its my first day writing on this so just some background about me...  Jennifer Nicole Lucas is my name :) I am completely in love with my boyfriend of about 1 year, Joey and I go to Huntington High  I really only got this thing so I could vent all my stresses and traumas i experience thru-out the summer and stuff like that... I dont really care about spelling or grammatical errors. I dont kno who will read this but i'm sure someone will find it amusing. I dont really have any friends cuz they all seem to stab me in the back. but i refuse to right about stupid shit like the damn war thats 'going on'.   although i will talk about the student council elections that are on May 15th...anyone from HHS...vote for me Junior Class Secretary...  so anyways, I have this huge MG(multi-genre) shit due in 2 different classes and is totally stressing me out...and a science project that the parents will not leave the freak ALONE! thats it for 2nite, just wanted to test this new stuff out...  oh yea, gotta get up at 6 tomorrow for an awesomely fun track meet!

      yey, its Mom's day, so that means i get to do everything for her :(....went to church with Joey then saw my cousin's new dog, Sadey (pitbull), cutest thing i've ever seen...only 5months old and it BITES!! doing a few MG tidbits here and there, hopefully i'll get it done. 10th graders have to take this gay ass WESTEST thing, that sets the standards for everyone that has to take it next year. we've all decided to do really bad even though i dont agree with that cuz then it would make the 9th graders look really smart, when, in all reality, they aren't....lol

      hey guys, its Friday night, and I'm at home...why? because my parents are losers and I have to be home at 10!! well, i said screw that and came home at 10:08, jesus christ! and now i'm grounded...wtf. i can't stand overprotective parents, especially when they don't see their own stupidity. I tried to find a way to suck up to mom before I talked to dad, but evidently it didn't work! lol  Joey and I walked in the park today. We stopped to "smell the roses", but really it was to rest our feet. hehe. I saw Katie and Laura and Patrick and Malorie and Katharine. Joey wanted to pick a rose for me, but I told him it was illegal...lol! i'm so stupid, but he didn't pick one. We ate at Taco Bell, watched We Were Soldiers (sorta') and then I left to come home to a house full of mad people only because I was 8 minutes late, what the crap?!

      Life Law #1: You Either Get It, or You Don't... Your strategy: become one of those who get it. Break the code of human nature and find out what makes people tick. Learn why you and other people do what they do and dont do what they dont.  Life Law #2:  You Creat Your Own Experience... Your strategy: Acknowledge and accept accountability for your life.  understand your role in creating the results that are you. Learn how to choose better so you have better.  Life Law #3:  People Do What Works... Your strategy: Identify the payoffs that drive your behavior and that of others. Control the payoffs to control your life!  Another random thought in reference to #1: In almost every situation there are peole who get it and people who dont -- its pretty easy to tell them apart.  Those who get it are enjoying the fruits of their knowledge. Those who dont spend a lot of time looking puzzled, frustrated, and doing without. hahaha

      yesterday, I went with some people and watched Ev play tennis, that was fun cuz Joey was outta town...j/k i was a good girl. I went to youth at church (CRUMY) and planned our trip to King's Is! yey! i haven't been there in...a year? maybe, but it'll be fun  i went swimming, finally, today with Joey...good thing too cuz it was like 90 degrees...no joke! we sunbathed (hehe!) and attempted to get a tan for a while, then it got really hot and i absolutely had to get in the ice cold water. but it felt so good afterwards :). Stump's graduation party roxoured! I got some sexy pictures of Joey in a cowboy hat riding Stump ;-O.  I'm getting my hair cut tomorrow? BIG DECISION! How much do I get cut off>? hmm....prolly only an inch or so, cuz  people  like my hair long so they can play with it.  After dinner, Joey came over for a while and we played outside. I'm still itching from all the mosquitoe bites i got!! i think like 10 in all... thats a good #, since its the 3rd day of summer! i mean, last summer my count was like 200! gotta beat that record...self induced pain...isn't that a sign of something bad? lol   here are some words of wisdom: ~Never cut what you can untie. ~Don’t ever take a fence down until you know why it was put up.

      Props to Fo and Christian for getting me over my phobia of drunk people. It is amazing how easy it is to get alcohol in Huntington. -went to Senior Night bball game, we won, Q tried to dunk but bricked it... its ok Q we still love our only senior! . So i felt special today cuz we left school early. Ate lunch at the "Funny Name, Serious Sandwich" place, too bad I can't think of the name! Ate dinner with the FAM at Chilli Willi's...saw my ex-bestfriend's new bestfriend there...*sniff*life seriously blows sometimes I've been waiting on Joey to call me all day and he hasn't.  I want to talk to him so badly, but he is busy "watching a movie" or "doing laundry" everytime I call. and now its past 11 so i can't be on my cell phone so now i can't talk to him! UGH! tomorrow is our year and 10month aniv. yey us  Byer~! night...

      Hey ya'll! its been forever! i wa reading past posts and wow was I a dork. I was inspired by Rachel and Katie to start this thing back up in hopes that my far too stressful life with become...not so stressful? School was good today. We shared our "Life Line" papers in english. basically, write some b/s story about someone who inspired you...yea so i was a rebel and wrote about someTHING that inspired me...$$MONEY$$. yea wow, Christian looked way cute today, so did Erica and Foster. Anyways, Joey comes back in town for ten days in 14 days! YEY! Tomorrow we (cool people going to the RASTLIN' tourny) get out early...i'll probably just check in and leave w/ Fo and Sean. Yea Sean...i'm pissed at him, he told Mom and Dad that he was spending the night at Evan's house and Evan was having a party for his birthday! Com'on kids, we dont tell our parents when our sister's friends are having a party w/o adults and includes alcohol! Dumb ass brother! grr....oh well, lesson learned.  Rachel your story was good, Katie you lied! Alright i think i've spilled my guts enough for the first day back at this!...peace

      Today I feel very nonproductive. I skipped track practice because my calves hurt so badly.  I slept the evening away. Then I hung out with my cousin Laura, neglecting me Trig and AP hwk. I'm so stressed about this AP exam in April...if anyone has any suggestions on ways to prepare please feel free to IM me. Its hot in this house. I feel so clostrophobic (sp?)! This morning I thought that I should name the style of dress of myself...I was alternative - black jewlery, a black tanktop, and black shoes. Not too shabby :)...i wanted to feel different. Every once in a while, I wear things to get noticed, oh wait! thats every day! haha...Trig test tomorrow...i should study...night! *7 days til Joey comes in!!!*

      Ok today was the first day of track practice...ugh! I'm so sore! I'm writing this essay for Honors Program - something like "A day in the life of a student", its strange, I sound so insecure and like freakishly unpopular. Oh well... Today reminded me of this song by Kenny Chesney called  The Woman With Me .  Its about a woman who wants to be a lawyer and the PTA prez Mom and the Soccer Mom all in one...and there's a line where he says, " She said the girl I was with the business degree probally wouldn't recognize me. I was going around the bank. I was going to run them out. Now all I want to run is a bubble bath ."....and yes, I took a NICE LONG HOT BATH when I got home from running around with Eric and Alex today! nighty night~!

      Wow...this weekend went by so quickly! Saturday was filled with loads of energy-stealing activities: lifting, football, basketball, running at the track...and then some poker. Ok the last one isn't very strenuous but still...I was SO ready for sleep when I got home at a "decent hour" (10:30! I kno, my parents are nuts!).  Today I went to the Charls. Mall with Erica...I spent a total of $30 on two tanktops, a longsleeve "London" shirt, and a new backpack (very cute!).  I had some Italian food for dinner. At the table, Sean made some joke about Joey getting shot in Korea...I almost cried, seriously. I wanted to shoot him! Pat, Christian, Fo, and I played Pictionary and Scattegories tonight while watching the Oscars. I had a blast...they always put me in a good mood. thanks guys :). My situation with Joey isn't getting much better. I still feel like he doesn't care about me as much as he says he does. He goes to the mall, and doesn't buy me anything. I got nothing for Valentine's Day...not even a card. And our one year and 10 month anniv was yesterday and he didn't call til like 3 in the afternoon...his excuse was that the d/s took his phone (i guess i have to believe him). *sigh* 12 more days

Joey is coming intown in like 30 minutes :) :) i'm so excited! alright anyways, the last day of school before went by so quickly - i had parties and watched movies in almost every class. track was another story...it was so cold out there! Mike stopped by and took a few pictures of me in my baggy sweats and nasty running clothes! he should've gotten me in my school clothes which are much more appealing to the masculine eye ;) hehe...but yea it was really cold and my muscles were screaming, "why are we still working!? its S/B already isn't it!?" haha I think i'm going to wait a little while longer for Joey to call, and if he doesn't i'm going to bed....night everyone!

      Wow, finally! I don't know what's been wrong with this thing the past few days! I haven't been able to log in.  Friday I found out that I will be going out of town for 4 more days over spring break which means 4 more days I won't be seeing Joey, unless my parents let him go with us. I'm praying everything works out in my favor, that's so bad.  Yesterday I voluntered at the Museum of Art w/ Kat. We saw this new exhibit they have up there from a women who lives in New York. She came to Huntington for a workshop and a bunch of really artistic Huntingtonians(!) helped her build this huge mural(sp?) out of random words, quotes, and stories. Inspired, i decided to write a few of the words down and try it on my own wall. I'll need some stencils, black paint, and a lot of creativity. I think I'm going to write down words that make me smile or give me that happy feeling in my stomach so I can look at this wall whenever I feel sad. Here's what I have so far mixed in with some things the artists had on their canvass:  Love, rainbows, spooning, sunny days, hoodies, warm socks, blonde hair, I have drempt of being a mermaid, French Vanilla, colonge, grape jelly, Butterfingers, red roses, virgin daiquiris, money, musicals, you and I will meet again, cute boys, things that glow, sex w/o pain, there are so many things I want to ask him, but now I can't, I must have...  Hopefully, that will be enough to cover the small wall behind my door. If it doesn't look to tacky I might extend it to my other walls. After coming home from the museum, of course I was feeling a bit artsy so I finished an art project from last year. It's an outline of Beyonce and I'm filling it in with ripped uo pieces of magazine. I've been looking for just the right color for her hair because I ran out of it last year - hence it being unfinished. I found the PERFECT color on the back of an Nsync picture I had that I needed to take down off the wall that I'm painting on.  What luck! I still managed to salvage a few good pictures of the boys and put them on the back of my door.  Today feels like a day to watch tv and sleep. It is way too cold to go outside at all. I'm cold right now, sitting in my room. Oh well, pray that it gets warm when Joey comes in town...which is in 5 days!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Hey guys!! Joey is here!!! yey! The first day was a bit rocky but after that things went smoothly...sometimes I don't know about him cuz he gets weird and all like "i'm hanging out w/ my friends" but then when he sees me he's all like "i'm never letting you go..." lol strange. anyways, track practice at 10 this morning wasn't so bad, only 6 of us showed up though. John Kerry comes to WVa tomorrow guys! get excited! just kidding, my mom hates that man, lol, don't kno why...she says he lies a lot. Daniella and I did a presentation on him and he didn't seem too bad. I washed my car because it was so pretty outside. I had a pleasantly surprising visit from Eric while drying the car and I was elated. We never hang out anymore, maybe because everytime we do, we always try to make everyone around us aware about the fact that we hate each other more than the other one hates us. Its a strange relationship. I'd hang out with him alone more often if it weren't for Micaela and Joey. Oh well, I don't think we should be trying to out-do the other so much and maybe we could start rebuilding our friendship...w/e. Dinner's ready...laaatterrrr

      So what is this big hysteria about all of West Virginians being related? I think its funny that the Gov'r is making such a massive deal about an Ambecrombie t-shirt. He is starting his own "design a t-shirt" contest to see if he can outsell the company. Maybe he'll find a way to get WV out of major debt!! hah.   I'm reading this book by Andy Rooney (the guy from  60 minutes ) and it is really funny. Let me give you an example...his idea to get out of national debt: rent the little circles on dollar bills to advertising companies. Who cares about Lincoln? We wanna see something like the new Adidas shoe! or even a new car? Isn't that great? Its a lot less painful of a way than Mr. Ferguson's idea -- televise a death penalty sentence on pay-per-view. Not only does the person die, but they die by being stretched apart by the ropes tied to their arms and legs. Also - possibly have a lottery to see in which order the person's exteamities come off first! hahah i think thats great but a little extreme.  Today I walked in the park with Erica and Max, yea and I had PFL to entertain me :). Then I brought Erica home with me and we ate some chicken and porkchops :(...then it was off the the JV baseball game to watch Chris and Reg.

      RESEARCH PAPERS!!! AAHHH...everyone run for your life! haha... I hate research papars, but this one is semi-multi-genre so I'm excited. I loved the multi-genre projects. The assignment is as follows:  Imagine taking a year off after graduating high school - no college, military, or job - and what would do you? I'm almost positive I'm opening a bed and breakfast in Spain :)...how exciting?! Time for American Idol

      Ok so Joey got online for the first time in a while and read my journal...he saw where I talked about Eric and me maybe hanging out and got highly pissed. I don't blame him. It kinda sounded like I wanted to get back together with Eric (no hard feelings hun, but I don't think it would work out, lol)... Yea and I got scared that Joey would read too much into other things I write on here so I took the link off of my AIM profile - but I decided that he should know what I think about somethings...and maybe learn to not think about shit I write so much.  Just a quick recap of Spring Break since I was too busy to write... 1. Visit from Joey was AWESOME! 2. Virginia was cold and windy and lonely 3. I was so sick! omg! Tonsilitis? or something like that 4. Sorry to everyone I ignored while Joey was in town!  I cant really talk because my tonsils are so inflammed...-eh-...I have to go back to school sometime!

      Friday night was fun...a little bit too much drama for me though. Aaron, Regis, Mark, Pat, Sean, and I watched tv and played chess all night.  Today was even better!! NOT! I had to get up at 7 to take ACTs...some girl in Eric's room had a seizure! that's nuts, I wasn't THAT stressed about the tests. Anyways, after getting over the fact that I had to take the tests at Marshall, unfamiliar territory, I made my way to room 302 to check out how smart I really was. I'm predicting a 26...we'll see.  Aaron is sick today :(, poor thing...he sounds like he's got what I had... I think it's going around...being sick to your stomach and that stuff, but I have a feeling it's those noodles he ate last night! like 20 packages!!  Mom, Dad, and Sean are out of town til tomorrow at 10:30...PARTY AT JEN'S...j/k. I have to spend the night at my Aunt's house tonight, but it's cool because Laura and I will stay up all night talking about random guy things, hehe -- Girls' night. yey.  I jumped a whopping 4'8" at the Midland meet today...considering the weather and stress from ACTs, I think I did alright.  This research paper in English is killing me! Anyone with suggestions on how to express my understanding of owning a Bed-n-Breakfast....hmmmm...I'm stressed, oh well....deep breath.  Well, it's about time to head up to my Aunt's house so I'll catch ya'll on the flip side, hehe...ly Joey muah

      It was so refreshing to get out into nature today! I went to Hurricane and watched Sean re-enact as a Confederate soldier. He looked so cute in his authentic war clothes and his long rifle that shot out noise makers( Joey is still in the field, he's there til Thursday and I'm pretty sure I'm depressed right now. I need to hear his voice. Being cut off like this sucks I feel the stress of a new English project coming on...great. Outline for paper due Tuesday and journals due Wednesday. I don't think I'll be seeing my friends after school until I get some work done.  We are offically going on a cruise this summer! yey! I can't wait! Sean and I get our own room, hopefully we can bond on this trip because we are drifting - sadly.

      This is a tribute to the nice guys. The nice guys that finish last, that never become more than friends, that endure hours of whining and bitching about what assholes guys are, while disproving the very point. This is dedicated to those guys who always provide a shoulder to lean on but restrain themselves to tentative hugs, those guys who hold open doors and give reassuring pats on the back and sit patiently outside the changing room at department stores. This is in honor of the guys that obligingly reiterate how /smart/funny/sexy their female friends are at the appropriate moment, because they know most girls need that litany of support.   In honor of the guys who respect a girl's every facet, from her privacy to her theology to her clothing style.  --- Katie....where can I find  this  guy?! haha I'm going to bed, night everyone

      Sunday was great...slept in til eight, which is an improvement on getting up at 7 yesterday...but not really cuz we lost an hour last night. hah thats weird.  Anyways, today I watched The Rundown(the Rock, Sean William Scott) at Pat's with Erica, Regis, Evan, and Pat. Erica and I picked up some Wendy's on the way to her house to play with Winnie...that thing is so  friggin  cute!  Last night Laura and I bowled with Laine H. and Monica W. because we were bored in the house. And God forbid Laura stay at home on a Saturday night! lol... After Winnie fell asleep Erica and I went to see Aaron in the hospital. I hate those things, they have a very distinct smell...something gross. He said he feels better so I guess thats an improvement on him puking his guts up. His g/f, Megan, got him this cute teddybear and his mom said she was going to steal it...Aaron laughed - thats a sign he feels better too. He actually got out of bed and walked around a little bit - quick recovery man! Dude, I hope you feel better now that you are missing body parts, lol.

      After an exhausting day at the track meet last night, I slept til 11 today. I arose to a bustle of people running to and fro in the house trying to clean - Saturday Clean Up as my mom calls it. I avoided talking to my parents long enough to get in the shower and prepare for the baseball game.  I left around 2 and set out to spend a long day in the hot sun in kapris and a gray t-shirt. Needless to say, I roasted. I was glad Huntington won, but even more glad when I found refuge in the shade and AC in the Camry.  I lost 75 cents playing poker today. But I really wasn't trying, I wasn't in the best mood. Joey and I aren't doing so hot. I wish we could compromise, but it seems like we keep pulling apart, or maybe it's just me pulling away from him. *sigh* I hung out with Aaron and Mark for a while before I called it a night and realized I was tired. They crack me up. Thanks guys for always putting a smile on my face.  My english research project is haunting me. I can't motivate myself to work on it at all. And I still haven't turned in my job application. *another sigh* My eyelids weigh more than the muscles keeping them open can handle. ~G'night.  Current mood: I'm lonely, I guess I need you.

      So our journals are due in English class tomorrow and I read a very intriguing article about people who keep diaries.  What I learned from this piece:   ~~I hate having a public diary because I find myself leaving out, toning down, pepping up, or falsifying many experiences. ~~The prospect of people reading my hand-written diary does not scare me in the least.  ~~How many diarists can honestly say they have never once imagined their diaries being "discovered", either before of after their deaths? ~~Once the details of being me are safely stored away every night, I can get on with what isn't me.  ~~I find myself editing my former self or jotting notes on the sides of margins so when I re-re-read my journals for the 1,000th time, the sentence once written in the dark at midnight while I was crying, is legible and actually makes sense. ~~I write to entertain, inform, persuade, direct, teach, and warn.   Current Mood ~ blah, I hate english hwk, it makes me discover myself  Current Song ~ Destiny's Child - If You Leave

      The afternoon went well... Erica cut my hair...just a little bit - hopefully someone will notice tomorrow at school.  I joined the Poker Circle tonight. I came out with $2.90 more than I started with! Yey for me. Wow, Foster looked ridiculous with his Echo suit, Jordan shoes, and "sleeve hat". He was pimped out, that's all I have to say. hahaha but I won't hate because he won like 7 bucks tonight.  Oh! I made up a new word -- Gork = Ganster + Dork  Tomorrow is the play so I get out for 6th, 7th, and 8th mod I think. woohoo

      Today Joey left with a tummy ache and his head hurting. I feel bad for him. He has to drive 8 1/2 hours to get back to Savannah...sick. Poor thing. This is me kissin' you: XOX  I've been thinking a lot lately, and I really don't have one close companion I tell everything to. There are things I keep from Joey and tell Erica, then there are things I don't tell Erica and tell Foster. I wish I didn't feel the need to censor things. I want to speak freely to someone,  anyone really , without having judgement placed on me. Even an animal will do. Just someone to tell  EVERYTHING  to so that I have an outlet. I guess there are certain things you need to keep from certain people...but there has to be one single  being  out there who is willing to just listen and nod, smile and sigh. And Katie, sorry I don't tell you  everything  I tell Nicole...  current mood: -eh it's easter, and i'm w/o a cuddle bunny :(  currently playing: Mario Winans - I Don't Wanna Know

And to my surprise I surpased my expectations. I don't want to brag but I got a 29 and that is something to get excited about!  I start work tomorrow, traning with Rachel, at 11:45. Wish me luck!

      "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush" Shit! I have no bird. I have no bush. God has taken my bird and my bush. I am left with a high mound of unorganized paper that is waiting for me to shuffle through and magically produce an "A" grade AP paper. *sigh* Why does it seem like everything happens at once?  While everyone else has cute little quotes or quoted songs on their profiles, I refuse to mask the truth. Relationships are hard! And sometimes they suck, sometimes they are great. But mostly we just spend our time trying to fathom some unreal bonding experience between two people. I don't see any point in trying to hide it. We all know that our significant other isn't perfect, despite the multiple "I love you"s and the random "I was just thinking about you" gifts. We push aside their imperfections, trying, hoping, praying that our relatioship will look better than the other person's. Or maybe we don't think we can do better, bullcrap, there is always someone better out there for you! If you have a feeling, then follow it. But don't try to be someone you aren't or turn someone else into something they aren't. Please, if anything, be true to yourself. I know it sounds cliche but really now, why put so much effort into a relationship that you KNOW is doomed from the start. All I'm saying is to see things for what they really are. Look deeper into someone's heart, look below the skin.   I need more caffine or compansion...one of the two...I'll be up all night working on this research paper.

      Although I didn't play tonight, it was the best poker night by far. Christian's patio was the perfect place to play - lighting, fans, screened in deck, and food. Tonight also included Black&Milds (although I did not participate in this activity), a baseball game, feeling sick, and a roughly short track practice.  Joey is on his way in town right now and I can't wait to see him. It's been forever since I last looked at him in the eyes.  So the girl that parks beside me at school likes to swing her red Chevy-shit doors into my car and leave nice long red scratches. I can't really say anything to her because I never see her and plus I'm afraid she'd beat me up or something, haha. HELP! I don't work again til Sunday, and hopefully I'll be feeling better because right now all I want is a back massage and a heating pad. *sigh* I should get some sleep. night~!

I felt bad about the ones I messed up though, people probably thought I was a loser. But I calmly said, "sorry, it's my first day"...lol i wonder how long that excuse will last! I washed dishes, squeezed lemons, cleaned trays, and of course worked the register. I feel so much self-worth when I work. I also sense a nice $10ish pay check on Monday. Haha, that's funny, nothing to get excited about really, just my first pay check. What should I spend it on? Or should I save it?  The AP english test is on Monday. Joey comes in town on Friday.

That's crap, I don't believe him. I haven't talked to him today either. I'm too upset. I can't stand drama like this. Let me hang out with my fucking friends. He isn't going to make me lose any more friends.  Everytime he comes in town, I lose friends because I don't talk to any of them while he's here. I concentrate only on being with him. Our two year anniversary is on Wednesday, I hope we make it til then. But right now, I don't know if we'll even be talking by then.

      After my disappointing performance at MSAC this morning, Mom cheered me up by taking me shopping in Charleston. I wiped out Wet Seal. I think I now own every color of plain razor-back t's from there. 5-7-9 also had great buys. Learner's (NY) normally has Mommy style clothes, and I found so much for the cruise in there! I showed Aaron, Reg, and Evan to see what they thought....and they all agreed I got some get deals and legs ;) haha. J/k.  Anyways so after dinner which consisted of Penn Station (yeah, I'm a loser, I go to work on my day off), I headed down to Aaron's to get him for the evening. We met Rachel, Evan, and Reg at Quizno's but only Ev ate. We took Regis home and then stopped in at the Java Joint. I've never been there before, nifty place. Anyways, then we went to the park and chilled for a while. Somehow my cell got turned off and Joey had called. Well he got upset because it was off and I was unavailable for him to speak to when he got back from Orlando Studios. Drama....

      The stars have such a beautiful haze of love around them. Nights spent under the stars out in nature are so romantic. These precious moments happen once in a lifetime. It's just you and the sky, well, you can have company consisting of another person, a dog, or even a good book w/ the flashlight to read it. And so in honor of nature, I write the following using colors of paint strips from the hall closet (built up after layers upon layers of paint on this house.......  The Cinderella blue of the afternoon sky soon relinquished to a more signature blue.  Raspberry sorbet clouds fade into the night sky.  The silverscreen stars began to bloom all around me. My mind wanders to those fantasy pink moments in movies. You know the ones...the purple mist outlining the tv, making you want to be the girl whose dream comes true that night. Tranquility blows through the tree branches as I gaze up into the abyss of sparkles. Strawberry cream thoughts swirl in my head. The aqua beads of loneliness stream down my cheeks. Someday I'll have a fantasy pink dress and wild carnation flowers. Someday...but not today. I'm too enveloped in the taos turquoise grass. It is my matteress tonight - also my tissue. The angel food clouds evaporate and I'm left with the night sky, proudly blue and forever vast. The dream is over. I awake in your mocha shake arms.

      Tonight was filled with the little annoying bugs that fly around lights and the ever-present satisfaction of baseball pants. Kyle looks really nice in baseball pants, so does Mark. Well anyways no matter how good they looked, Midland still beat them 6-3. Oh well, I hung out w/ Steph and saw Aaron for a while so that was cool. Down by the fence where Steph and i were standing these little bugs just flew around everywhere and would crash into our faces. Knats and misquitos = Highly annoying.  That's all folks, I'm going to bed. Night.

      He thinks I walk on water  He thinks I hung the moon  He tells me every mornin'  They just don't make girls like you  He thinks I've got it all together  He swears I'm as tough as nails  But I don't have the heart to tell him  He don't know me that well   He don't know how much I need him  He don't know I'd fall apart  Without his kiss  Without his touch  Without his faithful lovin' arms  He don't know that its all about him  He don't know I cant live without him  He's my world, he's my everything  And he thinks he needs me   Sometimes he cries on my shoulder  When he's lyin next to me  But he don't know that when I hold him  That he's really holdin' me And the funny thing is  He thinks he's the lucky one  God, that song perfectly describes me right now. Joey, just because we aren't dating doesn't mean I don't still love you. I do. Don't worry about that. I always will. And even though we aren't dating, you can still tell me you love me and I can still let you know how much you mean to me. It's not the end of the world. We live separate lives and I can't balance both, I'm sorry. Please give me time to find what I really want. And my answer to your question: I will be here for you to talk to when you decide you can be just my friend. I miss you, dating or not, when you aren't around. We've spent so much time together and no one can take that away - no new boyfriend, no new girl. Our things we have, that mean so much to you, are not shared with anyone else because they belong to us, and us alone. Without you these past two years, I know I'd still be back there listening to my parents fight or you'd still be dwelling on your grandmother's death. I might still be sitting at the top of the steps waiting for Allison to come back. Maybe you'd be back in your old house with the pool, shining your soon-to-be-taken graduation present. I don't want to lose the friendship we had but that's what scares me. When we started dating, we stopped being friends, I never wanted that. I still want to joke and laugh and giggle and wrestle like we did. I want to run to you and cry in your arms and know that everything will be ok and leave at the end of the night feeling better than ever, but maybe not so much. I wouldn't want to put you in any situation that would hurt you. And I'm sorry that the one time I decide to, it's this...but sometimes you gotta let it go.

      I waited til I saw the sun Don't know why I didn't come I left you by the house of fun Don't know why I didn't come I feel as empty as a drum Don't know why I didn't come My heart is drenched in love You'll be on my mind, forever                ~Norah Jones  So today was the AP test. I truely believe I failed. I really have no expectations of passing and I've come to terms with the fact that I'm just not a Daniella or an Erin. English and bullshitting are so easy for them. Heck, I'd even stretch as far as to say that I'm no Evan (relating to the bullshit).  Rachel and I played an awful trick on our manager, her ex-b/f, after we got off work on Sunday. We took an UNUSED tampon and soaked it in water. Then we preceeded to tie it onto the windshield wiper of his car! Hahah! It was great. I still haven't listened to the hilarious message he left on Rachel's phone.  Somehow I need community service hours. I am supposed to have 15, total, and I think I have 8. So I'm short 7, and they were due today! Oh well, Beta is cool like that, Mrs. Rapp will extend the deadline.  Track practice today went well. I didn't whimp out on anything and completed all my workouts and runs. I felt very proud of myself. Trish and I jumped more than we talked, and I always feel that we get more accomplished that way. Chris helped me out a little by giving me the same pointers that he gave the day before. I just refuse to remember them. I want to, I really do. I just can't think of all those things at once: take off far enough away from the bar  reach your arm up not out JUMP UP not into the bar hold your arch raise your hips kick your feet land w/o breaking your neck High jumping seems so hard, why did I have to pick that as my specialty in high school? Aaron came over and we just chilled and watched tv. We made fun of all the baby Guppies in my fish tank because their parents are so horny that they can't stop mating. Anyone that wants a baby Guppy...I've got around 15 of them!! Come, take your pick!   Current Mood :: Way better than yesterday!  Currently Playing :: Song quoted in entry

      Today Aaron and I watched the Real World/ Road Rules challenge, the Inferno. I guess they were having a marathon because we watched like 4 hours of it. So that's 8 shows, and that means 8 people got voted off. Wow. By the time we got tired of watching TV, I felt as if I personally knew every one of the cast members - CT, the Miz, Tim, or Coral. Pick one, and I could tell you their favorite color. Haha, not really.  We left my house around 8 and met Christian at Gabes. I bought a shirt there, and no, that doesn't mean I'm a skank just because I bought clothing from a discount store. There is no reason I should pay $20 for a Weathervane shirt, when it's only $4.99 somewhere else, in perfectly good condition. So to all you haters out there - shove it, because Gabe's (and Goodwill and Marshalls) rocks! :P I'm worn out from the Relay for Life last night that lasted until 7am this morning. Emily and I couldn't make it all night so we left the school around 1:30...oh yea, did I mention is was basically down-pouring the WHOLE time?! yea, fun stuff... Anyway I'm tired and I have to work tomorrow - come see me :) night!

      After school, Aaron and I saw Shrek 2. I really liked it. It appealed to the 10 year old Jennifer in me, and also the 17 year old one too. Overall, it kept me awake and laughing. At one point I was really excited because when Shrek, Fiona, and Donkey rode through the streets of the Kingdom of Far Far Away I noticed all of the name brand logos like Old Navy and Starbucks. woo-hoo. We dropped in Baskin Robins before heading home for some icecream and then ate some Mac & Cheese at the house for dinner...yum, very nutritious.  Oh yea! I want to thank Manuel and Katie for the excellent 7th and 8th mods today. Although we accomplished minimal work, I have found new appreciation for Mary J, drinking, and the male population all together. Two hours of trying to convince me to smoke didn't work, but a lot of Manny's views on life are just brilliant. And I can tell Katie has multiple talents other than singing and choreographers songs *wink* if you know what I mean.

      My English class cannot get along, it just wasn't meant to be. I can't believe such a diverse group of people can even be in the same room with each other without ripping heads off and launching them across the room. Erin, Evan, Katie, Rachel, Nicole, Eric, and Mark all have such different opinions that they clash and cause so many problems. Today in class, we wrote a lot - a marathon writing to be exact. I LOVED IT! I've done it before in Mrs. Macky's class, but this was such a release for everyone. The only rule is you can't talk while we do it. Ms. Ray picks a topic and we write, no questions, no comments. After the allotted time is up, we go around the room and share. I love hearing what people say, what they're actually thinking without hearing someone scream overtop of someone else to argue a dull point. One of the topics was "compassion" and I realized I don't necessarily have any... I wish I was more like Evan Litton, who has such a passion for tennis. *I'll post what I wrote sometime later* So we lost to Spring Valley, which in turn caused us to loose Sectionals. I felt so bad for all those seniors who didn't raise their heads out of their ball caps because they didn't want us fans to see them crying. *sniff* Talent show tomorrow, woo-hoo...Aaron and I are going to see Shrek 2 after school - get excited.

      I love baseball on a warm day. I love the crack of the bat when the unpopular kid hits an in-the-park homerun. His face made me want to cry as the entire team jumped out of the dugout to greet him at home plate. I love sharing prom candids with other players' girlfriends and looking at their's in return. When a long time high school friend decides he wants to talk again about his life and goals. I cry when I think about how much he's changed, but how much I still love him, despite his changes.   We won the baseball game against SV and I hung out with Sam with Aaron sat on the bench. After the game, I went to Austin's Homemade Ice Cream with Aaron to get some...Icecream!! It wasn't anything special but I was spending time with Aaron so that made it so much better. I rummaged through my room looking for junk that could be compiled into a yard sale. Mom and Aunt Carolyn are having one soon. So come out and see my crap! lol...  Current Mood >> full from ice cream, tired from the game  Current Song >> Amy Dalley - Men Don't Change

      Hey guys! I'm writing from my grandparents' house in MB. We got in around 1:30am this morning. I woke up to the sound of frogs and birds - lovely, at the wonderful hour of 9am. Only 8 hours of sleep on a weekend - not cool. I took a walk with Grandpa around the neighborhood, then Dad made everyone waffles. Woot!

      Ok, I promised I'd post what I wrote about Evan and passion so here it is...  Compassion - sure I have it - for volleyball, Joey, my dog - but sadly, I have not the compassion that some have. My friend, if I'm still permitted to call him that, once loved tennis so much that his summer days - dawn to dusk - were spent on the court on or in the gym while his 13 friends rode their bikes past as they made their way through the park. Whenever he speaks of tennis now, he enunciates every word - "split step, break point, forehand" - with passion and even gets choked up when he tells me he had that dream again, the one where he's coming back from being down against his life long rival at Kalamazoo(sp?) and its down to the wire - "last serve" he thinks to himself, "don't mess this up, you've come so far." I tell him to keep at it, and I envy him because he listens.  there you go - I hope he doesn't mind me writing about him, I doubt he even reads my blog.

      Howdie I'm really tired right now, and I'm swamped with homework. So this one is short, sweet, and to the point.   I'm getting so lazy now that we only have around 10 days of school left. I'm trying really hard to exclude sweat pants and t-shirts from my school outfits but it's so tempting to just sleep till 7:30, get up, brush my teeth, then leave for school and maybe be on time. I JUST DON'T CARE ANYMORE. I'm ready for school to be finished. I want June to come so the cruise will come!! I've got soo many cute clothes for our trip.  Work wasn't too hard today. I only labored for 2 hours and 45 minutes. Rachel said they are cutting down on hours, because business is declining. So people...get hungry for Penn Station! A cut in hours means less $$ in my paycheck, and no one likes a small pay check.

      I have to go to work soon, but just a little post before I do.  I guess by unpopular I meant - doesn't get much playing time, gets made fun of, is the subject of many jokes, I didn't expect that out of him.  Don't think I was trying to bring down Jacob. I really like him. Oh and I never said he wasn't a sweet guy, but I'm not going to defend my friendship with him. Such a small detail doesn't require so much explaining.  P.S. I don't think I'm popular, ask my friends, I'm the most self-conscience person ever.

He whined for awhile but then I begged him, because I'm as lazy as the next guy, and I didn't want to do all the work.  We watched this show last night, WB Superstar. Basically, they tell contestants that they can sing when in reality they really can't. It's so sad, I don't see how the judges can just sit there and lie like it's nothing. I heard that the audience was told these contestants had terminal illnesses to keep them from laughing at their untalentedness.

Evidently, Dad told Sean he couldn't see his g/f, so to make it fair Aaron couldn't come over either because we are leaving tomorrow for the cruise. That's so ridiculous. I just don't understand why I couldn't hang out with him for 30 minutes or so. I had to call him and tell him he couldn't come over, as he pulled up the hill. Damn it.

      Ok, today I went to school because I was  supposed  to turn in a sociology paper to Mrs. Myers but I decided I'd wait to do it at school. I arrived around 8:30, strolled into her class room, and told her off - not really, she's such as sweet old lady. She apologized for loosing my paper, and said, "Jennifer, have a good summer, don't worry about the paper." Geez, that's awesome. So I just hung around the school in my too-short-for-school shorts and waited for Aaron to finish his english final so we could leave the hill FOREVER (not really that was just cool). I watched The One with Finley while I waited, and I talked to Richard and Evan right before we left - I really gotta hang out with them this summer, two cool dudes.  Wendy's was the food of choice for lunch. We took it back to my house and ate before I got in the shower to get my hair wet. I FINALLY scheduled a hair cut. I only took an inch off. Aaron was so scared that I was getting it all chopped off, evidently he doesn't like short hair.  Aaron tried to force me to watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre with him today. I wasn't having any of that. So instead we watched stupid joke things on the computer with my mom until 10 when  Whose Line Is It Anyways  came on. Gotta love that show, right Aaron - especially the commericals?  I am sad. I was snooping through Rachel's livejournal comments and noticed that she was having the same "anonymous" posting problem I was confronted with. Someone said to her: "I will never understand why people think that by going onto someone's journal and insulting them ANONYMOUSLY would ever make any difference. Why does it make people feel better to bring others down- but they haven't the courage to admit it?" I really have no clue who said that, but I think it's something we should all live by. Having the courage to say anything about someone, whether it be online posted anonymously or said behind their backs, isn't really having courage at all.   I have come to the realization that no one reads my blog. Mayhaps (Andrew you are a genius) I should post porn to attract surfers. Haha. Or many I should just talk about more interesting things.

      What what! I'm back from the cruise with battle scars and a chocolate tan - hah.  Everything started out fine, leaving the house and all. Then I realized all the things I had forgotten: my hairdryer, a sweatshirt, my jeans, and a summer reading book. It turns out the sweatshirt and jeans would've come in handy on the ship because it was freezing at night and windy outside. A window fell out of the framing at my grandparents' house and busted my head open - great way to start a vacation. The first day of the cruise was very stressful because Mom and Dad wanted everything to be perfect. Wow, I really don't feel like writing about this anymore. I met awesome people - Alex, Justin, Zach, Bryan, David, Billy, Jessica, and Rissa (I miss you all!).  Joey is seriously stressing me out. I haven't talk to him in 2 months and it still gets to me. God help me to keep moving. I'd sure hate to break down here.

      The Notebook was the most romantic, smothered-in-love served movie I've seen in a long time. I think that was exactly what I needed to realize what life is really about. I've been so busy worrying about what everyone else wants - who  they  think I should date, what  they  want me to do in college, etc. I should worry about what I want. The Notebook reminded me that I have control over my love life and I should follow my heart, because great love can cause miracles. I kept my tears inside until I was outside of the theater because I didn't want to seem like a baby, but once I was in the car, I lost it. Noah and Ali's love comes once in a blue moon and when you think you have that love, never let it go, because chances are that one of you doesn't have the nerve to put pride aside and come "crawling back". My favorite part of the movie most def. was when Noah explained the roles of their relationship. He says to Ali something all these lines: "You're here to tell me when I'm being an arrogant son of a bitch and I'm here to tell you when you're being a pain in the ass, which is 99% of the time, with a two second rebound, then your doing another pain in the ass thing."  But the movie wasn't all about sweet love and fights...comedy kept unsmudged mascara from beginning to run. {ali: what if a car comes? noah: we die} It's too perfect.  I think I should read the book.  Current Mood : I feel like my life is under control now.  Currently Playing : Their Song....I'll Be Seeing You - Billy Holiday

       Great, now I'm talking to my blog. *sigh* I'm sorry I haven't updated in a while, I know everyone missed hearing about my boring life tremendously.    Today, my morning started out  great  - Joey woke me up by knocking on my door. It was like freakin 9am dudes! Too early...Then I went to Dad's work and saw Dr. Yates. He took X-rays of my mouth to determine whether my wisdom teeth needed to be removed. And they do...yes, all my wisdom will be gone. I'm not sure when I'll have time to have surgery, it just doesn't seem to fit in the schedule. I'll somehow squeeze it in between homecoming, senior pictures, volleyball (lifting, camp, try-outs, season), my 18th birthday, visiting colleges, work, and my senior Honors Program project (which I still don't have a topic for! HELP!). After I left the doc. I raced to the bank before they stopped counting change. I stepped into the building at 2:44...and they stop counting at 2:45. The guy was nice and said he'd go ahead and count it for me. $17....woot, atleast I don't have to carry that change around anymore. Then I dropped by Dr. Wild's office to return X-rays I borrowed for my app. with Dr. Yates. wow, I'm worn out.    Mom got this crazy idea that my family doesn't spend enough time together so tonight we are eating as a family out somewhere, then going to see Footloose (yea MJ!), and tomorrow we are spending all morning together because we'll be crawling through caves in Kentucky...yee-haw. Sounds like a blast. I think I'm going to try to take a nap before this family craziness begins... bye ya'll.     &nbsp;   Currently Playing - "Blue" - Eiffel 65....hence the blue text     &nbsp;   Current Mood - Excited, for what could be more exciting than 2 days of Mom, Dad, and Sean?     &nbsp;

       For the past   5 days, I have   been battered to a black and blue Jennifer. Wednesday, volleyball camp started. Although I was siked to start the season, I was a bit dicey when it came to the new coaching staff. Our head coach, Amber, and her assistant, Jess, are both 24 year old recent graduates of Alderson Broadus. When sports teams have a two week window in June when they can practice, we worked our butts off learning a new defense. Instead of running the defensive rotation that has been pounded into our heads since freshman year, we are now told to do the complete opposite. It might actually work if everyone on the team knew what was going on, but when we get out on the court everything falls apart. It doesn't look good.    After camp ended at 4pm everyday, I raced home to quickly take a shower. As fast as I could, I would eat a small dinner and head to work. I seriously almost fell asleep at work one day. Working till 9 each night, then going to bed at 10 is not my idea of a cool summer. I've missed Footloose, my friends, my family, and meals.    I've just now started to recover from this volleyball-then-work life. But guess what! I can't write anymore right now because I must be at work in 15 minutes.     &nbsp;   Current Mood - Where's my Starbucks doubleshot expresso?     &nbsp;   Currently Playing - "Eye of the Tiger" - the one in the Starbucks commercial.

      Dad finally called the cable company to come fix our internet connection and channels 3 through 13 on the TV! So now that I can post again, hopefully I will... Nothing important has happened in my life lately, but I can think of a few things that I want to say - 1. Rachel and I named a drink...It's called Jesus on the Rocks, because I think cappuccino is Jesus and she iced it. Haha, nevermind, it really isn't that funny, we were just really bored/tired at work one day. 2. Everytime I touch Alex's car, it has a seizure :(. 3. I miss Emily and Katie and Nicole! - we are at work way too much! Volleyball starts on Monday, and I don't think I'm ready. The fitness requirements include 10 push-ups that I can't do...lol, I'm weak. Anyway, I work a split-shift today...and I need to get ready for the second part...BYE!!!

      Ok, so I awoke this morning at 7:30am to take a shower and eat a bowl of Frosted Mini-Wheats before heading off to try-outs. Try-outs the first day are always the worst because they want to weed out the weak ones. Hopefully the season will bring a few wins, although like I said, I'm a bit skeptical. Wishing that the optimistic Jennifer gets the best of my mood, I look forward to spending a lot of time with these girls. Today, Amber aka Coach Clay split us up into groups. She gave a mini-speech before we broke saying, "This in no way is the division of people who made the team, people who didn't, varisty, or JV. Don't think that at all." Now, I personally think that if this little speech has to be made, then its totally obvious that those assumptions can be correct... as far as JV and Varsity goes. Work is calling my name...bye!
