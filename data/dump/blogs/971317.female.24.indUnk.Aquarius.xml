      My very own blog.  Reading anya's stuff made me think that I need to get something of my own started.  There is always so much going on that it's hard to make the time to keep a record of everything that's going on.  But now that John and I have cable internet, and since I've been spending my planning period playing "Collapse" anyway, there's no better time than now to get it started.  For anya, I watched pretty woman, too, and your wandering rant is one of the reasons that I'm starting this silly thing.  All hail moderate priced star vehicles, and their mind numbing powers.  It's grim reaper day at school today.  Apparently halloween equals dead people everywhere.  I'm supposed to get my face painted but in the infinite wisdom of the school, there's really no schedule for the day's events.  I might get my face painted, and I might not.  If, perchance, I DO, i get to play dead for the rest of the day.  Fun fun fun, but it will probably negatively effect my already poor classroom management.  The goal is two posts a day.  We'll see if I can manage that.  If not, someone should get on my back and force me to keep writing these things.  Hopefully it won't take long to progress past the "I did this boring crap today..." point.  We shall see.

      One more day.  One day of hall passes and mistimed bells and other random school shit before I can go home and live like a real person in a real town for a week.  I've never been so excited about going to Tennessee in my life.  No news tops that news.  The MTC website has officially updated, which is a good thing for those of you who have been needing to see pictures of various people that I've been talking incessantly about for six months now.  So, knock yourselves out (and thank you, daddy, for telling me that the pics were finally there.  I would have never thought to check on my own.)  You can access the site by clicking urlLink  here .  Is it safe to start counting hours yet?  And anya, what's this I hear about a party?  Is this a redheads only thing?

      Okay, the "going home mix cd greatest johnston hits of all time" project has hit a bit of a snafu.  Namely that my brain is not functioning properly and I can only think of cheesy crap.  I think, at the very least, this should be a two disk project: one silly disk, one serious disk.  The silly disk is already well on its way, and will contain the already following, already downloaded, songs, plus many others (once you people start emailing and calling): For Ashley: 1. ABBA - Dancing Queen 2. Cheech & Chong - Mexican Americans 3. The Ramones - Judy is a Punk 4. The Strokes - New York City Cops (not silly, but it goes with the up tempo)  For Todd: 1. Paul Simon - You can call me Al (Todd, get freakin online and read this so you can give me more ideas.  My Todd humor goes away when I spend too much time away from you.)  For Daddy: 1. Arlo Guthrie - The Motorcycle Song (Yes, dear god, someone actually had the motorcycle song, and I actuall downloaded it, and I'm going to go so far as to actually put it on a cd.)  I don't have any in honor of my mom yet, but I can call her in a bit and get some ideas.  If any of this makes sense to you, then we probably share DNA, and if it doesn't, then read posts in the future.  Hopefully they won't be this obscure.

      Dear Lord it's been too long since I've written.  I could make a million and one excuses, to include but not limited to: 1. The nastiest stomach virus in recent Heather memory. 2. General pre-Thanksgiving laziness. 3. unexplained server outages at school. 4. Limewire, which whispers in my ear and tells me downloading music is always more productive than journaling. 5. Did i mention that it's almost Thanksgiving?  So anyway, I'm taking the day off because of the aforementioned nasty stomach virus which was accompanied by much vomiting and other unpleasant gastrointestinal occurances, all of which are at least 18 hours in the past, but I was tired damnit.  And I've got 7 sick days, so why not take one?  Also, I've discovered that taking a sick day when you really aren't sick might be a bit unethical but it can also be extraordinarily productive.  I've returned videos, made my copies for the rest of the week, eaten lunch, folded laundry, washed the car, and cleaned out the backseat and it isn't even one yet.  Maybe I need to get "sick" more often.  Better yet, I haven't gotten any calls to say that the school has collapsed in my absence, so maybe they really can survive without me.  But if the school actually collapsed, their phones wouldn't work, so i guess they wouldn't be able to call...  And now, spending my afternoon online. i am again on Limewire, downloading songs for Zelda's maiden solo voyage back to Tennessee.  Please please please, email me with some suggestions for songs that will remind me of home.  I have a tiny *tiny* little list going, but it won't even get me to Greenwood.  We're talking an 8+ hour drive here, so I need your help. Variety is king.  Make me sing, dance, cry, laugh, doesn't really matter, just send me IDEAS!  I can get almost anything off Limewire, just don't get too obscure on me.  (My music people, I'm really expecting you to come through for me here..  you know who you are.  And if I don't get suggestions from you, I'll start naming names in my next post.)  In other news, we have mice.  Or at least lots of mice poop.  And our friends aren't quite mean enough to go around our house planting mice poop.  On the bright side, we haven't seen a roach in at least a week, and it isn't rat poop.  I think a family of them lives in the chimney, which happens to come through the second floor essentially where the headboard of John's bed would be (if it had a headboard).  He's all but convinced that they are going to do bad things to him in his sleep.   No school news... I'm on cruise control and so are the kids.  We're all in the "just make it to Friday" mode, and I'll have to reteach the assignments they were supposed to complete today, so the whole of that discussion is really rather boring.  More later. 3 SCHOOL DAYS LEFT!!

      It's been such a crazy few days, and I can only write for a few minutes because The Amazing Race is about to come on.  Oh, the escape of pointless tv.  There's nothing like it.  So I think I should condense this weeks life lessons into a handy little list ala Dave Lettermen.  So, life advice from heather, on what seems to be an ordinary Wednesday night. 1. Never drive away from a gas station with your wallet on top of your car.  It's a real pain in the ass. 2. School secretaries are evil.  There are no exceptions. 3. Oral Communication textbooks are a godsend.  (And it only took until Thanksgiving to get them. Go Delta Schools!) 4. My mom's voice is the best sound in the world. 5. Giving rides to people that you are immensely attracted to leads to major day dreaming while driving. 6. Mix CDs are always wonderful, especially when someone you love makes them for you. 7. Pitching a fit can be both classy and productive when performed for the right audience. 8. Virginia Slims are annoyingly girly, but they make you feel skinny. 9. If you leave a drink on a table in a high school classroom, it will get spilled.  (or "wasted" as my kids would say) 10. You simply must adore people who absolutely HAVE to drive to Jackson on a school night just to go to Barnes & Noble.  More later for you night owls and faithful readers of the journal.

      The network is finally back up at school, so now I can get back to writing while I'm sitting at my desk (and supposed to be teaching).  It was down for nearly a week.  Not that anything at this school works consistently as it is.  FLE today has everybody tired and unwilling to work.  I didn't take the test, but I certainly agree with the sentiment.  An entry of substance later tonight...

      Writing a paper tonight, so there isn't much time to comment on life or love or the world.  I actually had a pretty interesting (but unproductive) day.  Maybe tomorrow I'll have the time to add something of substance to the blog, but not tonight.  Oxford for the weekend, so no new posts on Saturday at all.  Hopefully the world can survive without my stunning wit for one day.  Back to the typing grind.  Nighty night all.

      For those of you who are close to your families tonight, try and remember exactly how lucky you are.  And exactly how hard things might be if they were too far away for a smoke on the porch or a late night trip to the carwash (I love you Ashley)    Sometimes the most ordinary night in the world can make you miss everything about your life that isn't there anymore.    There are two trees that I would sell everything I own to see right now.  One is in Hixson, across the street from Garner's Gymnastics, right in the spot on Hixson Pike where Amanda and I got in that wreck when we were in high school.  Every year in October it turns the most wonderful colors.  It's so beautiful that it looks like it is on fire, but the color lasts for weeks and weeks.  Everything that I need tonight is on that road.  I can get to my house, and my dad's apartment.  I can go to Panera for hazelnut coffee and to Target to spend money that my mom really shouldn't give me.  I can go see Todd at work.  I could be within ten minutes of the four people that I love more than anything in the world.  The second tree is next to the playground at Taliwa Court Addition apartments in South Knoxville.  It's color isn't quite as amazing as the first, but I lived such an important part of my life within sight of that tree.  And being outside at my old apartment, where I could hear the traffic on Chapman Highway and see the kids playing on the playground, and smoke my cigarette and smile that I was in that place at that time, it always meant that something was right with the world, even if that something was very very small.  I don't see how a week is going to be enough time at home for Thanksgiving.  I don't see how I'm going to get back in my car and drive back to the Delta.  But at this very moment, I'd give it all up to spend thirty minutes sitting at the kitchen table with my mom, or sitting on the porch with my dad and sister, or cruising around in the Jetta with Todd.  Everyone has always thought that the relationship I have with my family is weird.  And they are right. It is the most weird and beautiful thing I know.

      Anya is a big giant thief for stealing the countdown to thanksgiving.  Sure, it hasn't technically been included in my journal.  And, admittedly, I forgot to update it today.  But I HAVE had a Thanksgiving Countdown on my whiteboard for nearly a month now.  My kids were all freaked about by it.  "Ms. Johnston, Thanksgiving is so far away."  "Ms Johnston are you crazy?"  "Ms. Johnston, what about Halloween?"  And so, she says, "yes it is" "yes" and "who really gives a shit?"  Today the count is 13.  Thirteen school days left for the students, teachers, and staff of Simmons High School in Hollandale, MS before we can celebrate the fuck out of some Thanksgiving.

      Some days you can groove on just about anything.  Today is one of those days.  And even though I have everything in the world in front of me this week, I can pack it up, head to the house, and know that I made something good happen today.  The puppet shows went off without a hitch today, even though Carey seems to think it was a rather nonacademic activity.  And now I have cool puppets and props decorating my room.  I've never seen so many trees made out of cardboard boxes in my life.  I've decided that Casey is a giant retard.  Any and all efforts to converse with the boy have been futile.  Not to mention the fact that flirting hasn't even been attempted in more than a week.  Not that I don't still think he's attractive, but my god, there are certainly some things in this world that just aren't worth it.  I have to deal with 120 oblivious people every day.  There is no reason in the world to make it 121.  He can keep his out of control classroom down the hall and miss out on whatever wonderful things might have happenned if he'd ever gotten a fucking clue.  Certainly more this loss than mine.   Then only bad news is that in the meantime, Greenville and surrounding areas are still totally devoid of available, educated male twenty-somethings.  And to think, girls in new york whine about the lack of men.  They wouldn't survive the length of a commercial break in the delta.    Oh well, I don't think you can go  totally  insane from sex deprivation...

Color choice assistance, image editing, the ritualisitic sacrifice of two kittens, you know, the usual.  The world is wonderful, and my bed will be warm.  What more could you ask for?

      So, I tried to post earlier while I was still at school but my computer ate my post because my lame-o principal can turn the server on an off whenever he damn well feels like it, and for some reason he thought he should turn it off during our "scheduled tornado drill".  I find this a bit ironic considering they sort of forgot to ever have the scheduled tornado drill.  (But it isn't ironic at all when you consider that they never turned the bell timer on all day, that the tardy bell for fourth period never rang, and that the tardy bell for sixth rang precisely 45 seconds after the bell rang to dismiss fifth.)  My kids can't even get a sheet of paper out in 45 seconds, much less get their lazy asses to their next class, but enough about school.  As requested, I figured I should let you losers in on my thanksgiving holiday schedule.  I actually get a week off for one tiny little holiday, but if I didn't get a week there'd probably be a major school shooting incident.  I'll be leaving from Hollandale on Friday, November 22 as soon as they ring the bell to dismiss school (which typically happens at 3:05)  Factor in a time change, the fact that I've never made that long of a drive by myself before, and a trek across the entire width of both Mississippi and Alabama, and I should get home between eleven and midnight eastern time.  As for my K-town folks, I plan on coming up on either Monday or Tuesday of the week of Thanksgiving, but everyone is more than welcome to come down to Chattanooga and visit as well.    My schedule is still pretty open but since I'm so immensely popular, everyone should book early.  *wink wink*  I'm available for dinners, cocktail parties, orgies (and other occasions of casual sex), mountain climbing excursions, and 400 level anthropology classes.  Other than that, you'll have to make a pretty strong case if you want me to spend time with you.  (But we all know I'm a sucker for some quality Real World couch time.)  Btw, how big of a whore is Trischelle?

      And today, Sunday, queen of all unproductive days in the universe.  I DID manage to go grocery shopping.  I DID manage to take a load of laundry downstairs, set it in front of the washer (and then discover that there was laundry in both the washer and the dryer), I DID go see Erin's play even though I've felt all day like I've been run over by a very large truck.    The play was wonderful.  Made me feel like a total tard that I didn't at least mention to my kids that they would get tremendous amounts of extra-credit if they got their butts out of Hollandale to go see it.  But so goes the forgetfullness of a first year teacher.    I'm still debating how honest one should be in a forum like this.  I haven't sent the obligatory "so i'm writing this new thing if you're interested in reading it" email.  So, technically, I could be saying any damn thing I wanted to be saying without the slightest worry of consequences.  But I'm still self-censoring, wondering how long it is going to be before I have to send the hopefully ego boosting email to friends and family to go to the stupid website and read the stupid crap I've been writing recently.  Not that things I've written haven't gotten me in trouble before, but since I'm like a "professional" now, maybe times have changed.  Or maybe I'm attempting to come up with lame excuses for not having the balls to write everything I'm thinking.   Good thing this cable internet isn't hooked up in MY room or these rants would be annoyingly lengthy.  Maybe I should go plan something for tomorrow.  Or, more likely, I'll go watch the simpsons with john. Oh the joyous life of a half-assed teacher...

      Lazy, boring saturday.  No food in the kitchen.  Plenty of homework to do but no desire to do any of it.  Instead the best option seems to be to hang out in our freezing house, take occasionaly cigarette breaks and listen to the rebs get slaughtered by auburn.    Productive things I should be doing: laundry, grocery shopping, reading articles for my paper, grading, planning, wearing thicker socks, deciding how to unbraid my new cornrows, wearing gloves so my fingers can type faster, spending time doing things other than writing on blogger.  Homesickness is nasty on saturdays when we aren't in Oxford.  Oxford typically equals a great deal of alcohol consumption.  Here in greenville, there's plenty of beer in the fridge but it doesn't seem like there's any reason to drink it.  People are supposed to be coming to town to see erin in the play tonight.  if that happens maybe our beer will be combined with boys (?) and possibly karaoke.  But I haven't called amber, and karaoke would be boring without her, so who am i kidding?  as for the boys (followed by an obligatory question mark), i'm not sure that casey has ever seen a play in his life.  It looks like he could border being a "dramatic type" but his eyes certainly glaze over any and every time I discuss what I'm doing with my drama kids.  So, whatever, we'll see if the boringness of today will exceed the boringness of previous saturdays in greenville...  I hate those days when you seriously feel that there's something wrong with your life.

      Romance novel number THREE is now nearly one hundred pages underway.  I had never felt like a criminal in a bookstore until today.  I was very "mission impossible" through the aisles, in search of this heroinesque author that carey has me hooked on.  (As in trainspotting, not as in powerful female lead.)  My feet are cold and my fingers are cold, and the only appealing activity for the afternoon is going back downstairs and reading with the backdrop of Kingdom Hearts... oh the joys of new gaming systems for christmas.    I miss my friends.  I miss my bed.  At least I'm not to the point of missing the shower that doesn't drain...    Wishing everyone else a boring and unfulfilling holiday... (This entry is sounding a bit like Carey's from the other night)

      Merry Christmas all, even though that seems like a rather cheesy thing to put in one's blog.    All is well in Tennessee; we even got a dusting of snow this morning.  So brief that if you blinked you might miss it, but it was snow none the less.  I've spent the majority of the holiday with my nose in a book, but that's the glory of having friends like Carey who can pinpoint one's literary needs in 2.4 seconds.  I'm high on a cloud of words and literary oral sex and overall smutty reading.  Sometimes there is more to life than "good" books.    I'm continually bouncing back and forth between feeling like I'm having an overdose of human interaction and a lack of human interaction.  I suspect that much of this is because my true reality for now has been shaped by the few moments that I've been looking up from my book.  Now that the book is over things should level off... until I find the next book.

      Again, I cannot help but change the template.  Maybe I'll stick with this one for a while.  Can you tell how boring and unfulfilling my life is?  Finally got asked to help with the little Christmas skit that is being put on on Friday at the VERY last minute.  I can't think of a single more obnoxious thing in the world.  I can picture Mr. Liddell in his office saying, "Drama teacher?  We have a Drama teacher?  Oh yeah, I vaguely remember hiring her...  She's still here?"  So now I have two days to throw something together from a project that has been all but discarded by everyone else in the school.  But watching the kids try to practice today let me know that if I really want to have a "real" play sometime in the future, it could totally happen.  That is, if the overachiever kids in the school that are already entirely overcommitted could find time in their busy schedules...  I'm supposed to be over at Carey's right now, but I'm a terrible friend, so I'm not.  A phone conversation with Amber kind of got in the way, but the real reason is that I'm just not in the mood to drive to Indianola and then have to turn around and come back home.  I'm too tired to do much of anything except sit here and type, which reminds me... Isn't that what I spent my entire day at school doing?  Oh yeah, I squeezed some grading in there, too, for the overly grade conscious kids that simply HAD to know their exam grade the minute they turned it in.  God bless multiple choice.

      When the world gives you a sucky blog, you make blogonade, right?  I've dealt with the fact that sometimes the most creative, perfectly worded entries are better left erased and forgotten.  Nobody really cares all that much about what may or may not happenned this weekend.  Those who matter have heard the story at least once (except maybe Carey), and poor John has heard it at least five times. Sometimes catharsis comes with losing things that you thought were important... like your mind.  Today was incredibly grueling and long.  Teach, teach, teach, type, type, type.  I find it hard to believe that I spent hours and hours writing something that will only be seen by a handful of ungreatful high school students.  Exam time makes me almost as stressed as it makes them.   But when you get a couple of glances during the day that remind you of why you are there, those glances that let you know that those kids enjoy seeing you smile, it's all worth it, even if I have bags under my eyes now that make me look like a sixty year old woman.  I'm beginning to think that teaching is some sort of drug.  So many of those kids think that the universe is out to get them, and when you have those moments while they are looking at you and thinking that maybe you're actually there to help them do something, however small, it almost makes it worth it.  Low point of the day: Finding out that my classroom was broken into over the weekend, and realizing that my principal wasn't going to do a damn thing about it.  He didn't even get the janitor to go knock the window back into it's frame.  High point of the day:  Finally figuring out why my printer at school misbehaves so frequently, and then fixing it.  Apparently the roaches thought that the ink was food.  They were living in my printer.  They aren't anymore.  I once had a similar experience with about a million ants and an Aim-a-flame on a camping trip. Four more days.  I think I can make it.

      For some strange reason my page isn't updating, so who knows if this will actually show up or not.  It has been an absolute nothing of a day.  The only class where I had more than fifty percent of my students was fourth period, of course, and I wanted to string them all up by their toenails by the time lunch was over.  Individually, they're fine people, but as a group they are monsters.    So now I'm wasting away my "planning" period.  I was supposed to meet with Mr. Liddell at the beginning of the period, but he is nowhere to be found, of course.  Must be nice to be the principal and be able to be whereever you want whenever you want since you think no one ever expects you to be anywhere in particular.  One more period left, and then I can chill.  p.s.  there's a new boy.  crazy weird unreliable story .  maybe i'll include it someday soon.

      Some days the lighting in my classroom is all off and it really fucks with my mood.  I have lights out all over the place that apparently can't be fixed because of the ancient and long unrepaired wiring of the school.  And on days like today, when it looks like god got really pissed off at someone and everything is that nasty-gray-brown-delta color, I think I should be in a sleeping bag, in a tent, somewhere far far away from here, with pine trees and creeks and cold weather that makes you feel cold in the right kind of way.    Carey has the best available recap of Saturday night.  In case you missed it the first time, the website is  urlLink http://barefootnhippie.blogspot.com

      (Composed with Ben Folds "The Luckiest" on repeat.  Repeat is a wonderful and dangerous thing.) I am supposed to be doing many things right now.  Writing in my blog is not one of them.  Lesson plans, take home exam, those things are high on the list.  This is not.  Fuck it.  People say that I am cryptic.  I know where I get it.  So I am going to venture towards the cryptic mecca with this blog entry. If you are reading this, more than likely one of the lines below is for you.  If absolutely none of them make sense, then enjoy marveling at my mental instability. (or hold out for tomorrow.  Sanity typically reappears with sleep.) Jack Kerouac, eat your heart out.  Last night I was happy.  The warm kind of happy where you really laugh and you really smile.  Thank you to the person who will never read this that made that happiness possible.    Homemade curry is wonderful.  And thank you to the person that made me realize that I do have the balls to take people up on their offers of a post school beer.  The earth didn't stop turning, and a beer turned into five hours of just hanging out, but sometimes that's all you need to remind you that the world is a pretty okay place to be.  If you read this, call me.  You need the details.  For the thought of the person that made me put this song on repeat in the first place, I hope you are okay.  Sorry for the rude email.  Sometimes it's all just too much.  I felt like it was a contest to see who could get in the last blow.  You won.  I realize that.  I'm a sore loser.    I love you, daddy.  I know none of this makes sense.  It's all stupid boy stuff.  I'm sure you'd understand if I explained it all, but there never seems to be enough time.  Thank god I now know how to turn up the volume on my computer.  I realize it wasn't rocket science, and it's sort of shameful that it took the stoner of all stoners to show me how to work it, but such things allow for rambling glorious blog entries.  For those who know and care, Jermaine was back at school today.  He didn't go to prison.  Three day suspension.  He didn't show up for my class, but he did drop by later in the day for me to sign his excuse.  I think he's fully aware of how disappointed I am in him.  He could barely talk to me. I wanted to cry when I saw him sitting in the office this morning.  This is why they tell you to keep professional distance.  Anyone who knows me knows that it is a heather impossibility.  Life is crazy.  Love is crazy.  I could use more of both.  Pick up your application at our regional office.

      This silly little blog has already served its purpose.  I'm not sure that there was ever a specific purpose in mind.  Something about releasing stress and making the world a tiny bit better.  I'm not sure that anything I've written here has done either of those things, but one of my friends has managed to say so many things that I've been too sarcastic and short-sighted to say.  She now has her own blog because of this one (or so I'd like to think).  You can find her at urlLink her very own blog .  The week at home seems like one big blur of cigarettes and laughter and Target and too much driving around Chattanooga.  I saw Santa sky dive, always an exciting occasion. And I had moment after moment of that warm fuzzy feeling where I was really thankful that somehow I ended up with these people as my family.    Sleepy time.

      Started my own "illuminated journal" tonight, despite the fact that most of my oil pastels had melted in my car.  Heard Old 97's on Scrubs and Coldplay on ER. What is up with the musical tastes of NBC?  There's something surreal charming and scary about hearing my favorite music on something so commercial, knowing that at that moment there was someone somewhere asking themselves "what am i listening to?" and "where can i get a copy?".  Not that I have exclusive rights to who can like my music, but some things should still be sacred.  I've been charmingly hassled all night by someone inquiring about my top ten albums of all time.  I haven't given much thought to the list so it will most certainly be thrown together, in no particular order, with some blatant omissions.  But here it is, nonetheless: 1. The Strokes - Is This It 2. Joni Mitchell - Blue 3. Tori Amos - Boys for Pele 4. Ani Difranco - up up up up up up 5. The Beatles - Let It Be 6. Jennifer Daniels - Fists of Flood 7. John Mayer - Room for Squares 8. Cake - Motorcade of Generosity 9. Fiona Apple - Tidal 10. and I can't freakin think of a tenth one.  I'll get back to you on this.  Nighty night world.

       And tonight we give thanks to the goddess of birthday cards.     (sister and best friend to the goddess of well-written letters, daughter of the goddess of correspondence)    The following is the contents of the birthday card I got in the mail today from  urlLink anya .  It means a lot to me and hopefully she won't mind me transcribing it here for you to read.  Hope you enjoy:  Written in multi-colored sharpie on the inside of a card with two colorful, bathing-suit-clad 1920's bombshells on the front: "I'm not exactly sure why this card was so insanely funny to me... something about you and me and toenail painting parties in South Carrick Hall maybe.  Weren't those the simple days?  No matter how long we go without seeing each other, it's always so easy to fall right back into step. Which is how you can always tell your best friends from everyone else.  You have an inventory of "Remember Whens" that result in waterfalls of laughter or tears (or if it's really that funny, something else!).  And it's really fantastic that we've got this nice informal way of keeping up with each other via Blogger.  Now if only I could think ofa cool enough domain name where I could host everyone's stuff -- that would really be fabulous.  On, and if you're wondering, I got these kick-ass Sharpie pens for Christmas, and I knew you'd appreciate them.  I don't really have anything too exciting to relay -- but if I did, you could bet I'd call right away.  So I suppose the most important thing is to wish you all sorts of happiness for your 23rd birthday and 24th year.   Here goes: 1. Lots of sex 2. Cool Sharpie pens 3. a man to inspire good poetry (or bad, if it makes you happy) 4. time to see old friends who live too far away 5. good new music 6. alcohol-aided fun 7. good new books Well, this stuff would make me happy anyway. all my love, anya"

      In lieu of staff development we've been forced into our classrooms until four to complete sheet after sheet of curriculum allignment.  I have made the official decision that short of a really expensive educational chiropractor, my curriculum is as alligned as it's going to be.  If someone would like to take issue with this, they are more than welcome to attempt to challenge my flawless explanation of why I don't need to do anymore of this bullshit.  I managed to not post anything on my birthday.  Whether that was by design or by accident is hard to say.  Not that there was really anything of interest to post... (please, god in heaven, let me be saying something else when I get home from my weekend...).  I'm sure that cars and little woodland creatures have had more exciting birthday celebrations than the one I had last night.  Is it possible to be disinterested in one's own birthday festivities?  It was like I was somewhere else, in a different body, with a different birthday.  Nothing seemed important or real or fun.  It was lame, a waste, a bore.  (and at some point in my literary existence I'll realize that it's trite to say things in threes.)  The location for the true Heather's birthday celebration has officially been shifted to Memphis, under the astute guidance of Miss. Elizabeth Harper.  Thanks again Lizzie for your kindness, sluttiness and wonderful friendship.  It remains to be seen if there will be an immense MTC backlash now that the party has crossed state lines, but at this point I couldn't care less.  It's my damn birthday and I'm going to damn have fun.  More later...  As for now, I'll be sneaking out the back, avoiding the last fifteen minutes of fake staff development.

       22 - The Year in Review   How can I summarize a year that has been perhaps the most tumultuous and rewarding of my life?  It seems like an insurmountable task, especially when there are Drama notes to be written and lessons to plan, but the "birthday eve" is one of the most sacred of holidays, so it goes without question that somehow I will find the time tonight to complete this entry.  It is certain to be rambling and entirely too long, but maybe in writing it I'll find a few misplaced pieces of myself and leave something to pass along to whoever is bored enough to be reading this.  I don't know if I'm a better person now than I was a year ago, but I'm certainly different.  The same on the most basic level; still mean, still determined, still messy, still dreamy.  The changes are all in the texture, in the details.  The soundtrack has shifted in a slightly happier direction, but whether that is wishful thinking or truly the manifestation of a more delightful existence is hard to say.  And now that I'm leaving 22, like a dismal interstate rest stop, I feel like there is something I need to justify, but I can't say exactly what it is.  It seems that the only thing I've ever done is find the next dream and accomplish it; a series of stepping stones on the way to some goal that I'm still not exactly sure of.  And even though I'm sure I don't regret anything that I've left behind along the way, it's hard not to think of how staying put at any particular moment might have changed everything.  The milestones (in no particular order): * I moved on from a love that I once thought would last forever.  Aside from the random letter written on pages torn from a journal, all of it is so far in the past that sometimes it is difficult to remember.   * I packed it all up  again  and moved to the Mississippi Delta so that I could see the frequently sad but equally joyous eyes of children that I never realized existed. * I got a  real  job, though many of you might argue with that statement. * I bought a car. (!!)  That still doesn't seem real.  I adore her and she gets me everywhere I need to go and then some.  Hopefully Zelda will get an honorable mention in many year-in-reviews to come. * I entered into the most beautiful, wonderful, and supportive group of friends in the world.  They make me feel free and happy and safe even when the world is crashing down around me. * I now sleep in a room with hardwood floors, seven windows with airy white curtains, and a doorknob that falls off if you touch it the wrong way.  It seems like a very simple thing, but to realize that there is a room that is the equivalent of your personality can be the most pleasant and comforting thing in the world. * I graduated from college with a degree that I had known I would get since I was fourteen, and one that I wanted because it made my soul happy, and I started graduate school in a state that I hadn't even visited before showing up for classes.  The distances: * now almost exactly 23 years before I was welcomed onto the planet. * 10 years since I've celebrated a birthday in the Central Time Zone.  (Now I can celebrate my birth minute as it was meant to be celebrated!) * 8 years since the night when the most complicated relationship of my life began. * 7 years since the almighty 16th birthday when one is supposed to get one's driver's license... (8 months since I actually got said driver's license) * 2 years since becomming legal, less than 48 hours since I've been IDed to verify that fact.  It is all too much, but it is all too little.  Snow would make things better, but I'll have to settle for a windy, dry cold.    Happy Birthday to me in two and a half hours.

       A Letter to the President...  ref.  urlLink click here    Dear Ms. President,  According to our recent findings you have made leaps and bounds toward a fully adult existence.  As the founder and president of our organization, we applaud our efforts, but we must say that we are a bit concerned.  Our organization is still young, and in our infancy we are certain that we will need your immense slutty guidance for many years to come.  While we are certain it is good for your emotional stability to be moving on from said "ridiculously overappreciated" ex boyfriends, we want to make sure that this organization still lies at the heart of your priorities.  In order to maintain your position and prevent a violent coup, we recommend that you examine the following demands, um..., requests: (If you do indeed agree to comply with said requests, please email the second in command to insure your future as the head of our organization)  1. Present oneself in a slutty manner at any time that an officer of the organization feels it would be appropriate.  (ex. Murph's, Longshot, Any location within the city limits of Memphis, the Days Inn, whenever another officer is dressed in a slutty manner, etc.)  2. Expect sluttiness from your fellow officers, even when you have other things on your mind.  For instance, future performances, like that of 1/25/2003 when you willingly allowed an officer to visit an establishment that sold alcohol with absolutely NO makeup on, will not be tolerated. 3. Reserve the right to kiss (or at least talk about kissing) random members of the male species that you might meet while practicing the basic principles of our organization. 4. Hold all officers with the highest esteem and applaud any and all of their attempts at sluttiness. 5. Continue to smoke while standing, sitting, squatting, sleeping, eating, and any other time when one might feel it is appropriate. 6. Recall the founding principles of our organization and hold them close to your heart at all times.  If you find that these demands/requests are both sound and reasonable, we appreciate your continued role as our fearless leader.  We know that we would not be where we are today if it hadn't been for your intergral role in our organization.  Sincerely, Heather C. Johnston Vice-President  speaking on behalf of all officers, members, pledges, and future members

       One of Will's Roommates:"Kurt Vonnegut smokes unfiltered Lucky Strickes"   Me:"Um, no, he doesn't.  He smokes unfiltered Pall Mall's.  Always has."   --- conversation on the connection of literary greatness and nicotine addiction   Through life we pick up tidbits of knowledge.  Facts that we are sure we'll never actually  need  to know, but somehow we feel happier, more secure for knowing them.  Take, for example, Kurt Vonnegut's smoke of choice.  As an avid Vonnegut fan since discovering  Welcome to the Monkey House  at the age of fourteen, this is one of the choice tidbits of knowledge that I carry in my own very unique brain.  He smokes unfiltered Pall Malls (like a chimney).  In fact, I have actually seen him light an unfiltered Pall Mall in the middle of a decidedly non-smoking lecture hall to the delight of many adoring fans who had gathered to hear him speak.  This is my area.  This is something I know beyond a shadow of a doubt.  And so, when someone says something lame, like to suggest that one of the greatest writers of our time smokes unfiltered Lucky Strikes (Do they even make those?), I must take it upon myself to correct said uninformed person.  However, in times of need for such valuable tidbits of knowledge, one must be careful of the company one keeps.  At certain times, exposing yourself as the keeper of such knowledge can be uncomfortable.  It usually becomes similar to a bad cartoon in which normal people arrive in a foreign land only to be crowned the Kings and Queens of a people they have never seen before in their lives.    I was a queen as I sat on the couch, admired by all for my love of Vonnegut and my indispensable use of trivia.  Sometimes being queen is a glorious thing.  And sometimes being queen takes you places that you really shouldn't go...

       "Could you collect Barbies and NOT be gay?"   --- Amber, on gay people   The best things in life (as revealed to me by the city of Memphis, Tennessee and my slut-goddess-guru Amber):  1. The combination of Starbucks and a snowwy morning. 2. A vacation with a really good soundtrack. 3. Musicians, musicians' friends, musicians' houses, musicians' attitudes 4. Seeing two movies in two days, especially if they're both really really good. 5. Woodchuck Granny Smith hard cider. 6. Staying an extra day because you  can  and because you are  welcome .   Even if the supply of surplus undies is dangerously low.  7. People who are happy to see you (even if they don't know you). 8. Smiles and laughter that say you're exactly where you want to be with who you want to be with. 9. Napping in the middle of the day with SNL reruns for background noise. 10.Conversations about the best we have to offer and the worst we need to leave behind.

       "To look life in the face, to know it for what it is, to love it for what it is: 'Tis the right of every human being."   --- Virginia Woolf, as spoken in The Hours   For most people, movies are a pleasant distraction, two hours of escape from the drudgery of life, two hours spent somewhere you hadn't even imagined before walking into the theater.  And then there are those of us with slight (undiagnosed) fantasy/reality relationship problems.  There are those of us who take the characters with us in our heads, to live there for days or weeks.  We welcome them, we serve them tea, relate our problems to them, quote them in our journals.   The Hours  is a movie that I have yet to escape from.  A moment hasn't passed since I left the theater that I didn't feel that I was acting based on the motivations I picked up in the film.  (If you're struggling with unreleased spontaneity problems, it might be best to skip this film and carry on with your normal, predictable life.)  Love, life, death, the hours, the moment.  All of these things are laid before you on the screen, and you can't help but wonder how it was that you were living your life before you entered the theater, before you saw these events take place on the screen.  But one thing was obvious for me from very early on.  The world wouldn't look the same when I left.  And it didn't.    Clarissa who was waiting for her happiness to find her, sacrificing for the happiness of others, Laura who sought her own happiness to protect her very existence, and Virginia, the catalyst for it all, who could never truly elude her demons...  If you take anything from this entry, which is more an emotional musing than a review, let it be that you owe it to yourself to see this movie, to find what it has for you.  "That's what people do, Richard.  They stay alive for each other."  --- Clarissa Vaughn, The Hours   Goodbye Granny Mitchell.  Your fiery, sassy spirit will be missed here, but I'm sure those around you, wherever you may be now, will enjoy it just as much as we did.

      An amazingly insightful quote from a less than insightful day:   "As much as you bitch and moan about guys in general, you've got an outlook that is dangerous.  You don't see us for our faults.  If you are around one long enough, even if you don't like 'em at first, you find something to enjoy; a piece of them that fits a piece of you... and you let that take you places, some good, some bad."   --- Allen, on Heather and the male species

       "It'd be 'Road Rules: The Homeless Guy'"   --- Mike, on transporting homeless people   Sometimes it's good to be the kind of person who is willing to open the door, and sometimes it isn't.    Scene 1:  Man knocks on door of our hotel room.  We are simply chilling.  Nothing all that important going on.  We answer the door for the man we have never seen before in our lives.  "You got a lighter I can borrow?"  "Sure," we all say, not realizing that this is the first incident in an ongoing cycle of door knocking.    Scene 2: Man returns to door, knocks again.  Amber, Mike, and I do not hear the knock as we are otherwise occupied at the time.  Other people, who happen to not be in the bathroom, notify us that there is someone at the door.  "Shit!" we all say in unison, not exactly sure if we are indeed distressed by the fact that someone is at the door again.  Man has simply come back to return the lighter.  No harm done.  Plus one lighter for the good guys.    Scene 3:  It is later, but not by much.  We are again chilling in the hotel room, watching South Park and laughing our asses off.  Brad: "I think someone's knocking on the door again."  Everyone else: Various responses of "I can't believe this."  "We're soooo in trouble."  "Don't answer it!" Meanwhile, Amber and I are frozen on the bed as John becomes the brave soul who has to answer the door.  John begins to talk to the man, aka Lighter Guy.  Eventually the conversation begins to seem a bit too long, a bit too drawn out.  Mike is nominated as the "Go Check on John" person.  Mike returns from the now closed door accompanied by a frazzled John.  Lighter Guy, apparently in search of a ride (?), had shown John his driver's license in an attempt to prove that he was indeed legit, which John (along with any other normal person) confused as a request for money and/or a robbery gone terribly polite.  We still have our money.  None of us were arrested.  And we may in fact have returned from Memphis with more lighters than we had when we left. Life lesson learned:  Never make friends with someone who doesn't have their own lighter.  It can only lead to trouble.

       "It's hot, dude.  It's hot inside my head!"   --- Amber, on being hot   The weekend.  God's gift to the tired, work-a-day world.  Only sometimes, the weekend has a way of twisting over and in on itself until you begin to feel that maybe things would have been better off if there hadn't been a weekend at all.  I'm not quite to that point yet, but there is so much going on in my head, attempting to process things that I never imagined I would have difficulty processing; making sense of the craziness that continues to be my life.  There are so many things that I would like to say in the entry tonight.  So many things that I could get myself in trouble for.  So many things that cannot be edited from my mind but must be edited from the type on this page.  If only I had the confidence of anonymity and the peace to know that all who read this would love me no matter what.  Self-censorship is a bitch, no matter how you slice it.    The abridged, PG13 rated, censored to protect the innocent version of Heather's weekend: Drinking, smoking, movies, every sort of assorted fun one could imagine.  Amber, God bless her, is the best addition to my life in recent memory.  I didn't think it was possible to feel a part of absolutely everything that went on, but somehow I did.  The world was our oyster, our more than half full glass of Woodchuck Granny Smith, our unopened pack of cigarettes, and this weekend we did everything in it that we pleased.  Music everywhere, linked closely with good conversation and the truest sort of spontaneity anyone can experience.  However, that demon of lust/misguided adoration was determined to rear it's ugly head.  Such an incident was either the high point or the absolute low point of our ever-eventful, ever-entertaining weekend.  And even though I won't have it again, this week I'm sure I'll spend more than a moment or two thinking back and realizing that it was truly that warm-blanket, full-cup-of-coffee sort of comfort.  It helps to be thankful for such things, especially when the same events could have been awkward and entirely uncomfortable.  (I wonder if he would tell the story in the same way.) Life lesson learned: Nothing ventured, nothing gained.  I didn't know what I was doing, but I did it anyway, and I can honestly say I'm happier for it.  Later this week, in future installments of "Chronicling the Weekend": Reviews of  About Schmidt  and  The Hours ; The Importance of Knowing Kurt Vonnegut's Smoke of Choice, How to Get Harrassed in a Hotel Room, and more quotes from the "Heather and Amber Do Memphis Quote Book."

      It looks crazy outside.  A slash of purple-gray sky and beneath that a slash of washed-out blue.  The wind swirled and blew open a window.  It's more than a bit sinister outside.  Inside, on the other hand, everything is relaxed and comfortable.  We're taking the day off because 75% of each of my classes has been yanked to do various activities that are apparently more important than learning anything today.  Nine times out of ten it makes more sense to go with the flow and take a day off, for the sake of everyone's sanity.

      To Do: 1. Get oil change so car can safely drive to Holly Springs (1/17/03, approximately 52 hours from present). 2. Devise complicated plan to mail camera and related equipment to now unemployed brother ambitiously taking photography class. 3. Escape staff development by presenting well-worded and important sounding to-do list to clueless principal. 4. Finish book which has long been lingering around page 243. 5. Smoke. 6. Take down Christmas tree?  (At least we haven't turned the lights on in a few days.  But we can all see how high it is on the priority list.)  --> still holding out hope that Christmas tree will figure out how to take itself down. 7. Do laundry?  Laundry pile now less than four feet from ceiling.  Very concerned due to the fact that house has ten foot ceilings. 8. Visit Walmart, aka "hell", to purchase supplies for complicated camera mailing and marathon laundry event. 9. Edit "To do list" to reflect reality.

      A long day.  Wish I had the energy and stamina and will power for a real post (to appease the masses, or at least Amber), but alas, I don't.  I probably shouldn't be posting at all because everything I'm going to write will be crap.  Did I mention it was a good self esteem day as well??  First pre-birthday resolution:  No more school related posts until after birthday.  (except for tonight which is an exception only because of the awesome Act 1 Scene 1 happennings today in "Freshmen Meet Romeo and Juliet")  School Crap ---> 3rd period: Struggled through every line.  Tybalt sounded like he had some sort of palsy.  Romeo was without his trademark whiny passion.  I wasn't on my game. 4th period:  Miracles happen.  They got it.  The sex, the insults, the violence.  They laughed.  Really laughed.  Big belly laughes that Shakespeare would have smiled at.   7th period: Lack of focus.  Tardy children, arguments, general stress overload.  But.  We finished the scene.  Benvolio was a girl that rarely speaks in class and she was wonderful.  My "problem children" appreciated Shakespeare's low-brow humor.  I left with a smile on my face.  Other happennings:  I want to be reading right now but by the time I finish this I'll need to be sleeping.  I've already overscheduled my weekend, and we have class next weekend, so the prospect of days and days stretching out in front of me with no true forseeable break makes me a bit nervous and scared and, most of all, tired.  I'm biting my nails and playing with my hair and having all other less-than-lovely manifestations of my overall uneasiness.  I'm sure I'll try to drink it out of my system this weekend, but we all know that probably won't help.  Here's to holding out hope that it WILL help, and that I'll actually get some rest on Sunday and Monday.

D:"Not that there's anything wrong with the way she dresses" A:"Yeah" D:"It's just that she'd dress differently if she had a boyfriend." A:"You're right" D:(to me) "Ms. Johnston, you know you dress like that because you don't have a boyfriend, right?" Me:"What?" D:(repetion of above statement) Me:"I have no idea what you're talking about." D:(second repetition of above statement) Me:"What's wrong with the way I dress?" D:"Nothing" Me:"Sure" D:"Do you dress that way for Mr. Munz?" Me:"Why would I dress any particular way for Mr. Munz?" D:"Because you don't have a boyfriend" Me:"The conversation is getting really confusing." D:"I just think that you would dress differently if..." Me:"Can't you find anything better to talk about?"

      Well, it's finally happenned.  A fresh and vibrant voice has emerged with a vengence on the MTC blogger scene.  Forget the whiney drivel that I've been throwing out for the past two months, especially since it more than seems to be on a loop these days.   There is now an MTC blog worth reading.   (And I feel ridiculous for telling her that I wouldn't link to her site until she had some content up.  It's only taken her 48 hours to surpass everything I've written this far.)  So, without further ado, please go visit Amber's new blog.  It's wonderful.  It's insightful.  It might even make you breakfast in the morning.       urlLink fish goddess     urlLink fish goddess     urlLink fish goddess

      Sleep is coming soon.  Tomorrow, the glory of the short day...  the horror of having to face the fact that I'm nowhere near being finished with grading and averaging and hair pulling for a nine weeks that ended two and a half weeks ago.  Resolution: To be the kind of teacher that I wanted to be before I realized what teaching was all about.  To Indianola (casa del Carey and Maggie) tonight to regroup, feed the soul, generally get out of the house without spending too much money (even though I did have to gas up my car to make it all the way there).  Breakfast for dinner made it feel like home, only without mama's biscuits.  I think my ever-lingering problem of having and keeping female friends might be beginning to resolve itself (after a twenty-two year struggle).  It wasn't a magical, vagina-discussing, night of wonder, but it made me happy.  And typically, few things about interactions with other women make me happy.  Confusing revelation:  I was the least "pure" of the three of us, while Maggie managed to be a bigger slut than I am.  A bit contradictory, it seems.  Even if I'm not the biggest slut, there is still pride to be had in the lowest purity test score.    On to another day of educating America's youth.  If the world only knew how I spend my evenings... Or how big of a slut I am.  *wink wink*

      I should already be in bed.  Instead, I'm messing with the blog.  I added some rather ambiguous links just to make the damn thing more symmetrical.    Teaching today was one of life's small victories.  Only one student threw up the "I hate Shakespeare" wall.  I must have been doing something right.  Even he converted by the end of the period.    I also received one of the most beautiful sentences I've ever read (in an email, of all places).  Sometimes the world smiles on you and says, "yes, this is your day. the songs on the radio are for you.  you will find things that you thought you lost. you will drink coffee.  you will smile too much.  you will realize what some of this is all about."  The only problem is realizing that the string of wonderful days has to end sometime.  But no one said that "sometime" has to be tomorrow...

      Now that I'm not forced to do battle with an incredibly slow dial-up connection, hopefully I'll be back to updating more frequently.  I made it home safely without even so much as a minor mishap on the road, except for the fact that I discovered that someone shot my front bumper with a b-b gun over the holiday while I was stopped somewhere in Alabama.  I can leave it parked on the street in an unsafe city seven nights a week, and I take it home for Christmas to park it in a subdivision in an entirely boring suburb and it gets damaged.  go figure.  School starts again in the morning and the last thing in the world I want to see right now is the inside of my classroom.  I'm so afraid that my good mood and my happy thoughts will get sucked out of me the minute I walk through the door.

       Pain, pain, glorious pain.  I could only think of one thing that could make me feel in control of my universe: Plucking my eyebrows.  Maybe that lovely menstrual influx of estrogen has gone to my head.  Maybe I'm really the only one that feels out of control in all of this.  Either way, my tweezers and my Cover Girl compact were the best companions I could locate, so pluck I did.  I look better groomed than I have in months.  Too bad my heart is broken, I have insomnia, and I'm past the point of having real emotional responses to what is going on.

      The past twenty-four hours have been a roller coaster ride.    The Good:  Lots of napping and Ricki Lake after a seemingly uneventful ice storm.  Watching American Idol to add a sense of constancy to my quickly changing world.  Eating cereal for dinner.  The way the trees have looked all day with their slight sheen of ice.  The sound the magnolia leaves make in the wind when each leaf is frosty, with it's own icicle/natural wind chime at the tip.  Entirely rediscovering my wardrobe after Sunday's marathon-10-load-laundry-event.  The Bad: The stress of feeling like everything I know has changed in some way.  Ample amounts of time at home alone to sit and think, with only my cigarettes and a book to distract me.  Hearing my pain and fear in the voice of my 17 year old sister as she explained things to me more eloquently than I could have ever explained them to someone else.  There are phone calls to make tonight, and words to put down in ink instead of type on this ridiculous screen.  The weekend is almost here, and after that Spring Break will be very much on the horizon.  I was hoping for a time of rest and relaxation.  So much for well thought out plans.

      Sometimes I have to do lame things, like post top ten lists and song lyrics.  Since I've already written one super lame list this week, I guess it must be time for some lyrics.  This song was on repeat in my car this morning.  I sang it at the top of my lungs between puffs on my cigarettes.  I sang it like it meant something.  Who knows if it really does.     Will You Be the One   --- Melissa Ferrick   Will you be the one I've wanted  Will you read my mind  Will ask me where I hurt  And heal me with your eyes  Will I look at you with wonder  And never doubt our love  Yeah are you the one  That I've been dreaming of   I run around in my head  And rehearse our introduction  I run around in my car  And find the best way way to your house  And even though I have never seen you  From what my friends tell me  You are walking grace   Who'd have though I'd be sitting here  Thinking my future could be right  Down the street  After all the loves I have lost  Over borders and over states  N' now I find out that you and I  Drink coffee  At the very same place  Could you be the one   Will you be the one I've wanted  Will you read my mind  Will ask me where I hurt  And heal me with your eyes  Will I look at you with wonder  And never doubt our love  Yeah are you the one  That I've been dreaming of   Yes it's true I am a hopless romantic  And I am full of pretty lines  It's also true what you've heard  About me  I fall in love every time  So would you let me down easy  If I am not what you want  Would you let me down easy  I've got a really weak heart   Will you be the one I've wanted  Will you read my mind  Will ask me where I hurt  And heal me with your eyes  Will I look at you with wonder  And never doubt our love  Yeah are you the one  That I've been dreaming of

       Some scary shit.   Because not everyone who reads this blog reads Jeremy's journal as well, I thought I should post the same link that he has up today.  We often become so jaded and lulled into a sense of security that our media is reporting all the news that's fit to print, but their definition of "fit to print" is often so slanted that the most important of stories simply fall between the cracks.  The cracks that are designed to simultaneously comfort us and conceal our often sinister government.  So, thanks to the BBC and special thanks to Jeremy for finding this story in the first place.   urlLink US 'plans new nuclear weapons'   In other news, some kid got in trouble for doing exactly what I did as a  teacher  on Friday of last week.  I, being the ridiculously liberal person that I am, wore my "I don't believe in your war, Mr. Bush" t-shirt to school.  This 16 year old in Michigan did something very similar.  Read his story on CNN.   urlLink Anti-Bush T-shirt banned at Michigan school

       "I wanted sex last week, but now I just want the fuckin' doughnut."   --- Lizzie, on the global importance of Krispy Kremes   There is a dandelion in my backyard.  And not a yellow one.  An I-was-already-yellow-and-now-I'm-all-poofy dandelion.  Maybe it's not a mutant dandelion placed in my backyard by sinister aliens that visit in the night, but I haven't entirely ruled that out.  Perhaps it has been there for a while and the curtains shifted and now I can see it.  Nonetheless, it's still freaking me out.  Today sucked, but I've already gotten all my whiney-bitch attitude out of my system, thanks to one particularly wonderful friend who had a very high heather-bullshit tolerance earlier today.  So instead of writing about how much today sucked, I'll bless you with a list of my absolute favorite things that I own in the world.  (It's good for the soul to dwell on the positive when the negative seems to be all around.)  And sure, it's a bit materialistic, but face it people.  I'm a teacher.  How often do I get to be truly materialistic?    1. My navy blue duvet cover with its tiny white polka dots.  It keeps me cozy and warm.  Now if only I had someone to cuddle with under it... 2. Sandals, sandals, and more sandals.  And if the dandelion is any indicator, maybe it will eventually warm up enough so that my kids will stop telling me that I'm going to die of exposure for wearing them in freezing weather. 3. My tattoo.  I paid for it, it goes places with me, so I think it's safe to say that I own it. 4. All of my books.  especially the ones that have that good book smell.   5. My ridiculously random t-shirt collection.  Awesome Band 94'! 6. A shiny red Starbucks travel coffee-mug, even though my kids knock it over at least once a day. 7. The Moleskin journal I bought at Square Books this weekend.  It still needs a name.  If you've got any ideas, drop me a line. 8. And of course, last but not least, Zelda, the currently rather dirty silver Saturn L-100.  Ah, the glory of an entirely unintellectual post.  *deep sigh of mindless relief*

       "It'd be Road Rules: The Hippie Guy"   ---Mike, lamely attempting to refurbish a quote and achieve the same humourous effect, on war rallies   The jury is still out as to whether or not it was a good/entertaining/enjoyable weekend.  There were high points and low points.  Due to the lovely realization that I had more money than I thought I had, I bought myself a new journal (for all of the stuff that isn't appropriate to go on here or in the illuminated Rho journal).  It's tiny and lovely and when I'm done posting, I'm going to spend a ridiculous amount of time going through and numbering every page.  It's small and black and when I write in it I feel like a super-duper-secret-agent-literary-giant.  Only, someone of that caliber would never find it acceptable to create lengthy humorous phrases through the excessive use of dashes.  I think I can safely say that I've fully recovered from the fight.  And hopefully I'll be singing the same tune when all of the girls are back at school tomorrow.   As for things of a darker nature, I've been reminded in the past 48 hours or so why it is that I so rarely keep secrets.  I have two right now, and at any given moment either one of them seems big enough to overtake everything that is making me happy or could make me happy.   And if you are reading this, let me be the first to assure you that neither secret has anything to do with you.  I'm taking these puppies to the grave, anyway.   Those that I can confide in have been distant this weekend, either emotionally or geographically.  Maybe the anxiety will pass.  Maybe I'm just homesick.  Ohhhh, squash casserole.

       You always think it isn't going to get any worse.   I can feel a bruise coming up on my thigh.  Right now it's just a rather unpleasant knot that hurts immensely to touch.  My chest also hurts, but hopefully that's a fleeting pain.  There's no knot there to speak of, and it doesn't feel like it's going to bruise.  There are beads missing from my bracelet.  The broken pieces were too small to salvage.  Other beads are half broken, hanging off the bracelet with dangerous sharp edges.  I have coffee streaked across my white shirt.  But honestly, none of this really matters.  Yesterday's write-up about my suspicions of cheating on Mr. Dimmack's test resulted in the largest fight at Simmons High School this year.  It was in my classroom.  It was my desks that were being pushed back.  It was my students that were fighting the most heated and angry fight I've ever witnessed.  Mrs. Kimble came to help.  Mrs. Snyder blocked the door.  Before this morning, I could say that I'd never broken up a fight.  Before this morning, I could say that I'd never had to physically restrain somebody.  This morning brought a lot of firsts.  A lot of losses of innocence, on my part and theirs.  The whole thing scared the crap out of me.  I'm not sure that I'll ever see my classroom in the same way again.

       And today I give up.   I've had bad days in the past.  And, I suppose, on the whole this one truly doesn't make the top of the list.  The kids have been lovely, on and off, and an impromptu observation went extraordinarily well today.  We quizzed, we took notes, we were happy.   But so often it is what lies just below the surface that pushes me to my keyboard during sixth period to attempt to get out at least a little of the millions of tiny things that have gone wrong today.  Nearly all of them go back to our wonderful office.  And each of them alone is enough to send me to get a job at Walmart, or to pack up everything I own and head back to the comforts of home to await the next round of grad school applications.  I feel underappreciated and alone.  I feel that every tiny piece of good I have done is so quickly overshadowed by mismanagement and beauracracy that it would have all been better to have not done the good thing in the first place.  I had to write up six students this morning for copying, distributing, and attempting to sell answers to a test in another class.  I watched the kids do it, knowing the whole time that I was going to write them up and that hopefully they would get in trouble for their actions.  I did write them up.  I told Mr. Hollins I had written them up.  He proceeded to thank me for the wonderful job that I am doing, in much the same way that he always does, bringing a small bit of reliable happiness into my work environment.  And a few minutes ago, one of the students I had written up came in to tell me that the school secretary, in all of her infinite wisdom, had informed her that she had been written up, and told her that I had no proof and that she wouldn't be getting in trouble.  I also had to send two students to the office because they claimed to have excused absences for yesterday.  They spent the entire period in the office only to come back with unexcused absences (for YESTERDAY, not to mention the class time they missed because I was stupid enough to send them to the office.)    I am useless here.  I am fighting daily battles in futility.  I am wasting every second of every day in a job that is sure to be undermined the second I have to pass a single thing along to another employee of this school.    I have no doubt that I will cry my way home this afternoon, or that I will get up in the morning tomorrow and carry on with the hard work of being overlooked and under apprecaited.  Maybe things are much worse because Casey isn't here today.  Or maybe things are much worse because I truly am realizing that I cannot be employed by an organization that so consistently ignores truth in favor of what is easy.

       Some days you just don't have it...   I'm not happy with my template.  I don't particularly care for my job.  Some girl's face ran into a guy's head in seventh period and the bridge of her nose was bleeding.  And when I escorted them into the hall to scream/bandage, another wrestling match broke out.  Apparently my kids didn't all get together and have sex over the weekend so they waited until they got to my class to take out all of their pent up hormonal energy.  Yeah me!  Instead of working on the PowerPoint for Dr. Cock, Carey and I went to Walmart and bought fattening food and makeup.  (Sometimes life does make sense in small, yet meaningful ways.)  I finally had a little time to release some of the steam and stories that have been building up since last weekend to someone who actually listened to at least 50% of what I was saying.  I hate those days when I feel like I haven't given anything back to the world.  It's bad when buying Mary Kate and Ashley nail polish makes the top ten of the most exciting and rewarding things you've done in the day.  I also filled up the car with gas (Thanks George W, now I won't be eating lunch this week), dug through the tremendous pile of laundry to find a long missing black shirt, played Mah Jong online, and took an hour nap.  Lord, my life is so full.  Still holding out hope for tomorrow.  Maybe some lovely literary type will read my blog and offer me a real job where I get to write things for a living. . . But who would want to employ someone that thinks purchasing cosmetics from former child stars is entertaining enough to be mentioned in a journal?

       Because you are...   Wow, a Friday night post.  It's been a while since one of these has landed.  An uneventful night to end an uneventful week, full of mostly sickness and recovery.  Nearly all is right with the world of Heather, except for the monster bruise which will heal in it's own time.  And until then I can happily grimace through the pain that comes while resting my wrist on the edge of the laptop while typing.  Aside from being sick and the overwhelming thought of "making it through the day,"  the week has continually come back around to one central issue.  I'm too much of a lame-ass to discuss it openly, with names and details and descriptions, but for those of you who know what in the hell I'm talking about, I think it's time to put in the last word.   And I'm serious this time, so hold me to it.     Sometimes you forget how well you know yourself.  And in these moments of true-identity-amnesia, it's easy to convince yourself of things that aren't necessarily true by the light of day.  I don't think I've been as bad about lying to myself as some people might venture to say.  (amber)  But, regardless, I keep having repeated episodes of resorting back to a thought that should have died sometime in July.  However, after this week, I think it's time for me to state some things that I've known all along but frequently been afraid to admit to myself, much less to other people.  First, while he is extremely attractive and funny and intelligent, he couldn't be farther from the type of person I really need to be with.  (So why bother?)  I love those little places in conversation for quiet and all-knowing smiles.  He obliterates them.  And as for the attractiveness, whatever happenned to the Heather philosophy of manditory physical domination?  Second, sometimes you just know.  I've never gotten those butterflies with him.  Warm glow, sure.  But never that knock-you-down sort of spark, and this is coming from a woman who has been known to spark very indiscriminately.  And third, that issue, that ONE issue, that I enjoy writing off so much really is an issue this time.  Why he is an exception on that front I'm not sure.  Maybe it's because we are so much alike, and I know that if I had the strength to stay faithful because of something I had with someone then I would cherish that, especially knowing that I've never had that strength in the past and I don't see myself having it anytime in the future.    And so, because you are one of my dearest friends, it ends here.  No more bullshit.  No more daydreaming.  The future is the future and none of us can predict it, so if anyone has contacts in Las Vegas or has already discussed this with their psychic friend and knows for a fact that the ending isn't quite this simple, feel free to keep it to yourself for now and hold out for the "I told you so,"  because as far as I can tell, it ends here.

      I am Parisian and a bitch.  Are the two related, or is it just a quirky coincidence??  I too have fallen victim to the quiz taking demon.  But it's so fun to take them, and even more fun to have nifty graphics up on the site for once.    This is the new template, for better or worse.  It looked awesome on my computer at home and it sort of sucks on the one at school.  It will all depend on what your browser settings are.

       "I got some lava lamps at home.  You can borrow them."   -- Beverly (in 5th period Drama), on wooing people   Lately, I've been feeling like there's no time like the present.  I mean, sure, it's a true statement.  A very "duh" thing to say.  But how often do we really  think  about things in those terms?  I think I've finally realized that I was coasting for way too long.  And at this moment every friend I've ever had that's ever tried to tell me to slow down or think more is cringing and squinting their eyes to avoid bearing witness to the inevitable trainwreck that must follow a statement like that when it comes from me.  But I'm here to say, in my most noble self-assured voice, screw it.  I was coasting.  I know I was coasting the same way you know that you've let down the emergency brake in your car.  It eases away and then you are rolling.  And then the rolling picks up speed.  Warnings be damned, I've done some things in the last few weeks that have finally let me feel that my life is here for me to transform it into whatever I might wish it to be, and now that I've started, I'm certainly not going to be stopping any time soon.

      I don't like this template. But I also don't like the fact that I can't laugh effectively because it puts me in a ridiculous amount of pain.  I have many things to post, but with my (as yet undiagnosed) kidney infection I only have the energy to lay on the couch and then lay in the bed.  I love you all.  I'm going to the doctor in the morning to get some super-awesome antibiotics.  So until I have my prescription, expect to see this crappy template and a lot of crappy meaningless posts.

      I've been messing with a new template, but for some reason whenever I do things to my blog from school, I can never see what it looks like after it's been altered.  So, if the blog looks like an awful mess right now, I apologize.  It will be perfect and beautiful later.

       to post or not to post...   My back feels like someone took a baseball bat to it.  I still have the energy of a drunken squirrell.  My dad claims I took the day off because of a wicked case of "Jack Daniels Flu."    Regardless, I must go to school tomorrow, even though I can't think of a single thing that I would enjoy less.  Posts about the weekend will surely follow once I have some strength and energy built up.  Until then, you can read Amber's profound entry about what to do and what not to do on Beale Street.   urlLink fishgoddess.blogspot.com

       "This ain't no festival!"   --one of Tina's students on her fake Shakespearean Festival that was actually an elaborate scheme to have students grade projects.   So, I spent three plus hours making this new template, which still isn't actually finished.  It needs a title graphic...  something glitzy with "magnolia coffee" in nice bold black type.  But I think I'd rather sleep tonight than spend another three hours getting that to look perfect.  The links and the comments and such will all be updated soon enough.  The counter has disappeared as well, but I'm sure I can find it again somewhere.  My Amazon goody has yet to arrive, but I'm holding out vast amounts of hope for tomorrow.    Sleep for now.  Toodles.

      Still having problems with the FTP dilemma.  But, if you're reading this, then you've gotten my email and you already know that I'm a giant dumb ass.    In other news, the world is lovely.  Aside from the war.  But I have a problem with feeling sincere guilt about something that I truly have nothign to do with, so I'll maintain my initial statment of the world being lovely.  I shared the story of the 86 chigger bites with 2nd period Drama today.  Sometimes they get that far off look in their eyes, like they know that I've lived a very strange life.  But it's a beautiful thing that they get my humor and they love me in spite of the fact that I actually thought it was COOL that I had had 86 chigger bites at the same time.  Off to Oxford tomorrow for class.  After this weekend we've only got one class meeting left before our summer session.  Oh dear lord, the first years.  I'm so excited I could dance, and we all know that I do NOT dance, except for occasional happy mental breakdowns in school.  Scheduling problems abound right now. I'm not sure if I should go home for Easter or for  urlLink Gail's   graduation.  I'm not sure if I should take a personal day to party my ass off at Memphis in May with my friends.  All of a sudden, vast amounts of time spent on the porch with a good book sound like an ideal sort of existence.  I'm sure I'll get restless enough sometime soon, the only problem will be whether or not I have planned for such restlessness.

      As I'm sure some of you already know, there is a blog being composed from Baghdad.  It is a collection of observations of war, all of which are simultaneously terrifying and sickly intriguiging.  I find myself reading it with fascination and realizing every third sentence or so that these events are REAL and they are happenning to another person who is blogging just like I am, only this person is in the middle of a war that MY country created.

      I'm not sure whether to be disappointed or relieved.  I had a sneaking suspicion that anyone and everyone would rush to comment on the brilliant things that I post every night.  I've decided that one of two things is happening. 1) My posts are not nearly as brilliant as I have been led to believe.  Or maybe they've only gotten dull since I put up the comment buttons.  Either way, I don't seem to be ruffling enough feathers to encite interesting feedback. 2) My friends and family are not nearly as outspoken as they claim to be, ya freakin lame-asses!  "We're liberal.  We have something to say about everything."  Whatever.  We all know where liars go...

       "I bet Ms. Reinhart knows how to build a boat."   --John, on our plan to have a luxury filled existence in Greenville   Changes to the site: I've had a rather unstructured weekend, and therefore more time to alter and otherwise abuse the blog.  Two additions of merit:  1. You can now comment (god help us all) on what I've been writing.  If you feel the urge to do so, simply click on the "Comments" tag at the bottom of each entry.  As of now, I'm the only person who has commented, so maybe you people aren't getting the idea... 2. A new link.  In my late night web-wandering I found an awesome journal.  You can find the link under "reads".  Get there by clicking on  urlLink le petit hiboux.   Changes in perspective: 1.  I've decided I can do nearly anything as long as I'm allowed to do it outdoors.  This includes ridiculously long projects in which I'm asked to plan my own school district. 2.  Sometimes I can be a royal Grade-A bitch, and because of this I can hurt the people that matter the most.  And with that, I offer my formal apology to Lizzie (and any typing primates).  I'm terribly sorry.  This project is just as hard as you said it is, if not harder.  I've been working since early this morning and the best I have to show for it is a sketch of my campus grounds, which isn't even a required part of the project.

       "I'm going to go get the camera so I can take pictures of us washing the house."   --John, on Saturday mornings and soapy fun   A beautiful Saturday that has left me incredibly sleepy.  Woke up early, fixed coffee, was generally productive but not toward anything that I can really show now, nearly 18 hours later.  John and I spent a couple hours with a scrub brush, a refurbished 409 bottle now filled with water, a too-short garden hose, and the passion to make the front of the house sparkle even though a glance at our yard might still lead people to believe that he house had been abandoned.  We got dirty and the house got clean.  We took pictures.  John walked around with two phones in his pockets.  We got honked at frequently by passing motorists who thought we'd escaped from a home somewhere.  It was sunny and wonderful.    The afternoon brought adventures with Smirnof Citrus Twist, a ridiculous assortment of hip-hop CDs and Tina's back porch overlooking the ever-creepy Lake Ferguson.  We wasted the hours and cigarettes away as if we had finally found our perfect spot of relaxation, like wrinkled old ladies next to the pool at some ridiculously overpriced retirement complex.  The three of us then came back to our house, helped Isaac replace John's car window, entertained Lauren by showing her the bird and feeding her sugary cereal, and watched entirely too much basketball.  And now that I'm so sleepy that I can barely hold my eyes open, I can safely say that there should be days without homework and planning and worries.  These are the days that keep me sane and the days that remind me it's okay to string a few of the other kill-me-now days together in a row, especially when ever-so-often you get a day when the sun shines at the right time, the yard gets mowed before the sun goes down, there's still money in checking to pay for the chinese buffet, and a warm bed awaits when it's all over with.

      In my moment of productivity this morning, I cleaned the kitchen, made my bed, and added a countdown to the site.  I'm not sure we all have the same school schedule, but I think our last day of classes and/or exams is May 23.  If yours is different, adjust the countdown accordingly, but I felt like we all needed a tangible, "I can do this for X number of days without losing my mind" sort of goal.  Now, back to my coffee and my book.

      I just got home from school after a ridiculously long day.  One of my favorite but most troubled kids is transfering as of tomorrow.  We are at war for reasons that won't ever make the least bit of sense to me.  But somehow, I'm still peaceful and happy.  I spent two hours this afternoon sitting at a picnic table next to a river and writing page after page in my journal while Casey played a round of disc golf.  It was windy and cool and wonderful.

       "Twenty-five million people watched the show last night and only two of them are in Simmons High School right now!"   --Me, sharing my disgust with 5th period, as Whitney and I discussed American Idol  I'm wondering if I can still write off my pop culture and reality TV obsession as anthropological research, since I already have my degree and I'm drudging along in the work-a-day world.  And the possibility always exists that my claims of "anthropological research" were just lame excuses to make my over-consumption of The Real World socially acceptable.  And so, as Lizzie did last night, I'm attempting to squeeze in a post before American Idol comes on tonight (hopefully to reveal that crappy Julia/Carmen/Corey has been voted off).   -->American Idol Content Sure, Julia sucks.  We all agree on that.  (even though I found myself dancing and singing the FlashDance song for quite a while last night.)  But why is it that America hasn't seemed to notice that both Carmen and Corey couldn't sing their way out of a karaoke bar full of drunken senior citizens?  The middle-of-the-road people are fine with me.  I'll let them stick around for a few more weeks.  Charles, the Kimberleys, etc are welcome to stay around for awhile.  They don't make me want to commit musical suicide the way the triumvirate of suckage does.  And as for the top of the heap; there will definitely be a two tier system: The really good vs. The really FUCKING good.  In my humble opinion, there are only three that belong in the highest echelon of American Idol cool: Ruben, Trenyce and Josh.  And to everyone else, cute little Ricky included, good luck with your guest spots on Boston Public.  You can only dream of being as cool as these three.  -->Non-American Idol Content Spring has arrived in the Delta, carried in by a ridiculously gusty wind that nearly blew my car off the road a few times this afternoon.  The fields have turned orange and yellow.  I don't know enough about the Delta to explain why they aren't the standard issue spring green, but the explosion of color is enough to keep me occupied on my ridiculously long drive to work, so I'm happy.  The warm snap hasn't escalated into Spring Fever yet with my students.  Nearly all of them can still remain seated for class, with the exception of all of 7th period, but they were never really that well behaved to begin with.  I've taken to wearing shorts and ratty t-shirts in the afternoons while I sit on my front porch and attempt to paint the $5 rocking chair that I rescued from an estate sale (after which my dad kindly toted it down the street).  It's starting to look folky and almost beautiful, and to know that it's entirely my creation, inspired by a few sun-drenched afternoons, makes me look forward to sitting in it for years to come.

       "Forest fire (sarcastic laughter)... for REAL!(sincere alarm)"   --John, on extinguishing one's cigarette while simultaneously lighting the azaleas on fire  So much to say, yet too sleepy to say any of it.  My world is confusing.  The planet is confusing.  We are about to go to war.  There is a very large sum of money missing from my checking account.  I need groceries and an oil change.  I need sleep.  I need sanity.  I need to go pick out an outfit for tomorrow.  I need some random kid to take 6 hours on the writing assessment tomorrow so that the whole day will be shot to hell.

       "The most productive thing I did all night was write "EXPOSURE" on Heather's leg."   --John, on Wednesday night fun in Greenville with highlighters  It's been a while since I've had something graffitied on me on big block letters, much less  pink  big block letters.  But sometimes, when you're hanging out, and you've already thrown people's shoes across the road, the next logical thing to do is whip out the markers and start writing on exposed body parts.  Tina got the worst of it, with "Bjork" partially scribed across her neck.  And thankfully highlighter is forgiving and washes off rather easily, as I just tested in the shower.    Sometimes, it just makes sense to write on your best friends.  It's good to keep in touch with one's inner kindergartener.  And on that note, I'll leave to have happy dreams.

       "You look like that lady from that movie...  You know, Josie Grossie."   --Tanesha, on white people with curly hair  After extended conversation, I argued my way into looking like Drew Barrymore when she isn't an awkward (read: hideous) high school student, and instead looking like Drew Barrymore at the end of the movie with the cheesy baseball (?) game scene where she gets the guy and the world is all sparkles and glitter.  I really don't look a thing like Drew Barrymore, but at least my powers of persuasion let me talk my way into a compliment.  None of this negates the fact that Never Been Kissed is a horrible, horrible movie.  The week has been slow thus far, and promises to be more of the same.  Exam weeks are usually boring but restful.  And so tonight, in lieu of preparing knock-'em-dead lessons, I'm embarking on a creative project of sorts, one that sadly most of you will never see.  (Not that it's going to be all that spectacular.)  But I'm feeling poetic, and I need to return a favor, so I'm thinking of combining the two.  So if you recall mailing me a gift in the past week or so, expect something in the mail.  And if you haven't given me anything recently, what in hell is your problem?  Speaking of which, how's that birthday gift coming along, Lizzie?  Last time I checked it's  MARCH !

       "Thanks for not hanging up on me."   --Todd, unintentionally profound, on friendship, family, and love  I have learned one thing this weekend, and I might be so bold as to say that it is the most important thing a person can ever learn.  I know now, more than at any other point in my life, that I am loved.  And because of this, at some point last night all of the tears I was crying out of fear and frustration and helplessness changed over to tears of gratitude, thankfullness that I am so lucky to be at this place at this time with these people.  Two things happenned last night.  To you, the outside observer (in most cases) such things might seem unimportant.  But to me, both of these events have already been filed into that select catalog of "Things I will remember until I'm no longer on this earth."   One:  Friendship has never been easy for me.  I've always had friends, lots of friends, and despite my tendencies to tell anything and everything to anyone and everyone, it is in my nature to create barriers and keep people at some sort of emotional distance.  But last night, something wonderful happenned and I woke up and realized that I finally had the type of friends that anyone in their right mind would give up everything for.  And perhaps the best part is that I have not one of these friends but two.  While we were waiting for our table at T.G.I. Friday's in Memphis, something came up and it became clear that I might want to leave the group for a bit and go do my own thing.  But, being the doubting faithless person that I am, I was afraid to bring up the issue with the group, knowing that the others with us who are less accustomed to my flightiness would scoff at the idea of my leaving the group.  But I never had to worry about a thing.  While I casually talked to Mike, I noticed that Amber and John had gone over to present the case to the group and fight my battle for me out of some senselessly pure desire for me to be happy.    TheImage An "L" shaped bar, my friends sitting at the corner with me sitting halfway down the longest arm of the L.  Mike standing beside me, talking to me, while I watch Amber and John tag team with some surely ridiculous explanation of my crazy plans. I must be the luckiest person in the world.    OnepointFive: I called home with the crazy thought that I was going to ask Ashley what song was playing in the restaurant.  Instead, Todd answered.  I asked for Ashley, she was not home, I hesitated, almost hung up, but the moment had passed and as soon as Todd said, "Heather?" I didn't have the heart.  We talked, about nothing in particular, promising to talk again as soon as we could find the time and the strength.  I felt, and still feel, that intense pull that I don't need to be anywhere other than home, sitting on the porch, talking and trying to make some sense of the world.  TheImage I am standing in the entry way to Friday's, between the doors to the street and the doors that lead into the restaurant. Every so often I can hear either the cars outside and feel a cold rush of air or hear the music playing inside.  I am leaning against the plateglass window, looking down the street, watching a light cycle through green-yellow-red-green, listening to Todd's voice, smiling with tears running down my face.  Two: And later, after I had talked to Todd finally, and I couldn't talk or laugh or interact with anyone, Amber and John never left my side.  I never once had to doubt that there would be someone there to talk to me or listen to me at the precise moment when I was ready to deal with things.  We walked to The Flying Saucer, had a drink, talked about nothing in particular, and attempted to make the best of a casual situtation that couldn't have been in sharper contrast to the intensely uncasual things going on in my head.  We left, and thanks to the impeccable timing of Mandy and Laurel's bathroom break had a few moments to stand outside and talk and regroup.  TheImage  I am sitting at a picnic table in front of The Flying Saucer at a busy intersection in Memphis.  Amber sits on my right and Mike on my left, as they tag-team-pep-talk, saying things they have both said before, only this time they make sense.  And I know that even though absolutely everything has changed, I can have faith that something beautiful and wonderful will be the same for as long as I want it to be.

       Ash between your legs and throw the butt over your head  The prez and v.p. trekked to Memphis again last night.  Tremendous fun had by all, including the raccoon that I believe was videotaping my lovely porch conversations.  (Raccoons can be sneaky like that.)  I'm feeling a bit better for those of you who have been worried: less like my life is ending and more like a real human being.    Since I'm stuck in class I can't focus enough to write a captivating recreation of last night's festivities.

       Could someone over the age of 18 please sexually harrass me?   There is a lot I am willing to overlook in my job.  Take, for example, the fact that I do not have a stapler.  (read: staple machine)  I had one at one time. One that I purchased with my very own money and then strategically placed on my 1970's style monster of a metal desk.  It lived happily on the desk, loaded with shiny new staples, for a grand total of three periods.  Then, knowing that  my  stapler would of course be smarter than all the other little mindless staplers in the world, it gathered it's belongings and took off for greener pastures, never to be seen again.  It was too good for that school.  I understand this now.  I respect it.  And the daily retrieval and return of Nate's stapler gives my kids a sense of continuity from one day to the next.  If there's one thing they can count on, it's that I never have a freakin stapler.  But on to the heart of the matter: the things I'm beginning to think I can no longer tolerate.  Namely: sexual harrassment.  We aren't talking about once-in-a-while, tiny little inappropriate comments about how cute my outfit is, or how lovely my curly flowing locks are.  We're talking tits and ass, could-you-buy-your-clothes-a-couple-sizes-smaller, Grade-A, Clintonesque sexual harrassment.  And the best part is, all of it is coming from boys who aren't old enough to buy their own cigarettes.  All of the unwanted attention culminated today in a grand moment of bra-popping.  Yes, you read that correctly.  I had my bra-popped, third grade style, by one of my students.  Sure, it was funny as hell.  And it was all in good fun.  Not malicious in the least. And had I not immediately laughed my ass off, I probably could have gotten said sexual-harrasser into a large heap of trouble.    Maybe if I weren't such a hippie (see below), I'd react like a mature professional in such situations.  But in the meantime, I think I'll just stay the hell away from my harrassers.  Avoidance is my best tactic.  I'll run when I see them coming, avoid them at all costs, prevent eye contact.... Oh wait. I'm supposed to be teaching these jokers.  Back to the drawing board.

       A semi-boring day in the land of the magnolia.   All the news that's fit to print: 1. Redneck boyfriend is no more.  Details may or may not be forthcoming.  If you want the scoop, you probably know the number. 2. Roommate number four may be our very-special summer present, which would facilitate a very happy heather moving into a very tiny study.  (Why don't my roommates realize how sincerely happy I am about this?  If I live in the same room for more than a year I start to feel rooted.  Roots are bad.) 3. Painting Marathon 2003 is underway.  The living room looks like we let little kids destroy our walls, with it's one new coat of Killz, attempting to cover up the tomb-like dark green. 4. Ole Shelly will be no more as of tomorrow afternoon.  Ah, the memories. (The official decision has yet to be made as to whether or not the new car will be called New Shelly.  Something tells me it just wouldn't be the same.) 5. I had a really cool post planned to mimic Krissa's Friday Five, but friday came and went, as did saturday and sunday, and I doubt a Tuesday Two would be as emotionally affecting.  So if you want some gushing blog post praising why you're the best friend ever, you have at least four more days to wait. 6. No one should ever let me write long emails after fourth period, especially when I attempted to put a curse on them so that they would all die instantly. 7. My mom forgot to call me back after I told her I couldn't talk because I was watching Mr. Personality. 8. My sister rocks.  and I hereby do solemnly swear to not write a single list for the rest of the week.

       before the tornado comes to take us away...   Chillin with the homies tonight, getting our usual three hours of quality tv viewing time in, as per thursday tradition.  And, again as per usual, one of the million new Saturn commercials came on.  And heather was all, "Oh, my car is the greatest.  These commercials are the greatest.  Me, me, me, Zelda, zelda, zelda."  And no one really cared.  And at the end, heather noticed a new Saturn slogan that hadn't caught her eye before. And it read, and I quote, "It's different in a Saturn."  And yes, my friends, it is.  So tonight, drink up to advertising genius, backseats, and being able to give sexual meaning where none was intended.

       an open ended letter   If you think this was written for you, you're probably right.   Dear Ex, I've been thinking a lot recently about what went wrong and why and where.  It isn't poetic, thoughtful reflection, but rather the typical-heather "what the hell?" diatribe of wishing we had all known ourselves a little bit better at the time.  And it all seems a little idiotic, to be thinking of people that are not thinking of me, and remembering things that you have certainly forgotten: Happy Birthday phone calls,  psychotic breakdowns,  shared twin beds,  the breezeway of Humes Hall,  porch swings and porch swings and porch swings,  our picnic table,  midnight Metro rides,  that one perfect night when it really could have lasted forever even though it  felt  perfect in the moment and that somehow made it wrong,  sitting in the sweltering city heat wondering if you would actually be on time,  breaking down on the highway and sitting on your bumper, knowing that we didn't need anyone to rescue us, breaking down on the interstate and thinking that we'd surely die, and hearing your stories, which are still in my head, which i still retell and occasionally steal replacing your name with mine in all the appropriate places.  I've been rereading  urlLink the book  that I've always wanted to live, only to find out that on my best days I am living the worst chapters.  Things weren't easier when I was with you, just younger and slower.  Maybe it was about purity or naivety.  Maybe I had more under control than I ever realized.  And so now, that I've apparently stepped into a place where I'm not the one in charge, for the first time ever, I feel like there are gratitudes and apologies owed that no one ever expected me to make. Thanks for letting me think I was the one running the show, and for never running me over with a car when I swore that my only option was to run away.  Thanks for never leaving me wondering if the phone would ring.  Thanks for always being the first to say the important things, namely "I love you," and "I'm sorry."  Guess I wanted you to know that you're still here with me, in some strange, detatched way that neither of us will ever understand.  It is from you that I got my working "measure of a man".  And when the next one falls by the wayside, as they always do, maybe we can both sleep a little easier knowing that I knew better because of all that you taught me.  always. h.

       Smoking, drinking, and sunburn...   a heathen celebration of Easter   Experiments in productivity (yeah right.): * completion of the long-awaited super-lame-o webpage for school.   * the not so essential reorganization of my room with accompanying discovery and removal of ridiculous amounts of dust. * tanning/burning in a futile and failed effort to deny my ultra-european roots. * numerous trips to walmart resulting in the purchase of new tank-top, toilet paper for remarkably toilet paper free house, air freshener for ultra-stinky classroom, and one other unnamed purchase for roughly five dollars that won't expire until may of 2007. * car-washing extravaganza 2003 * kicking Jessie after she passed out on the floor to make sure she was still alive and/or to see if she'd join me for a smoke  Experiments in procrastination/ productivity-phobic-ness: * the cell phone is still sitting in my purse. nope, still haven't called. * dreaming up elaborate short stories, novels, journal entries, poems, and leaving them all entirely in my head to be forgotten five minutes later. * losing vast amounts of time to thinking about a boy. * internet drivel. * Trading Spaces  At least there will always be porch time.

      My Notes to you:    Lizzie, Emailed the website to Dr. Cock.  9 am, three days late, with coffee in hand after an hour long conversation with my mom while she ate pancakes and tried to keep the dog off the dining room table.  Sometimes it just takes that sort of motivation to get me moving.  Hopefully I'll get my grade back sometime today.   Something tells me that man is too closely related to Satan to take a Good Friday holiday like the rest of the Christ-lovin world. kisses, c.h.h.  Anya, You must call.  I would call, but it's early and I'm sure you have the day off.  We must THINK!  Newly discovered Danny info! Evaluation is key! My new "redneck boyfriend" doesn't believe in the following things: * Hate crime legislation * an equal rights amendment in any form * gun control laws * evolution ( holy christ ) Is this really worth it?  I haven't had fights this good since...  well, we all know how long it's been.  All those d.g. free years stretched out before me like a happy-liberal-hiking-trail with too-many "yes ma'am" puppy dog boyfriends following behind.  Maybe it's almost too good to be true. In Crisis, heather  Ben, Do you recall me ever being extraordinarily  bad  at anything?  Get back to me on this. Concerned, h.  Nate, Sorry I made you read that note. I was being spastic.  You're more than used to it by now.  Hopefully you've been able to get that image out of your head. In parking-lot solidarity, heather  Daddy, Thanks for being absolutely the worst in the world at keeping secrets.  It always works out for the best for me.  Hope you have the happiest Jesus-weekend ever.  Is it okay to have beer and cigarettes before noon on Good Friday?  (I think you'd be the authority on such activities.) *wink, wink* love always, h.  faith, I was being an anti-social, into-my-own-shit moron last night.  I was flighty and awful and I'm terribly sorry.  I'll make it up to you tonight at movie-madness in Greenwood. forgive me, carol  To all other readers, Allison over at  urlLink bluishorange  has a really cool post today.  You should go check it out. kisses. heather j.

       The good, the bad, and the ugly...    in no particular order   The Bad: * Faculty meetings that stretch on for years in which the principal cannot give a straight answer to a single question.   Teacher: "So, do we have to give make up work to students who have been suspended?" Principal:  "You see, we can't punish a child twice; that wouldn't be fair." Teacher: "Okay, I'll start giving make up work but that really doesn't make much sense." Principal: "Well, technically, you don't have to since it should be an unexcused absence." I'm thankful that I have any hair left on my head considering I spent two hours on the verge of ripping out every last one.  Not that a bald teacher would have been noticed by a man who, on a typical day, overlooks fights, and can't even make the bells ring on time.  * The webpage for Dr. Cock is still on hold as I search for a reason to even do it at all.  Oh yeah, I'll probably get a C or something ridiculous like that if I don't.  Why don't I care?  The Ugly: * The fact that I'm waiting for a reply to an email that I wrote to someone I barely know, knowing full well that said person is waiting for me to  call  while also knowing full well that I don't have the inner fortitude (read: balls) to do such a thing.  If my cell phone hadn't died at approximately 3:52 after playing with it in the faculty meeting for more than an hour, I might have had the nerve to ring him on my way home from work.  However, my cell phone was by far the most interesting thing going on in that meeting and I don't regret using it to occupy me.  (well, maybe I regret it a little.)  * Uglier still is the fact that I really sincerely DO want to see him, even though at this point I can't remember what he looked like at all.  When you have to end every descriptive term with "-ish", you know you're in trouble.  For example, he has brownish hair and lightish eyes (maybe blue or green) and he wasn't all that tall, but he wasn't shortish either.  and at long last... The Good: * Tomorrow is Thursday, and we have Friday off.  Thank you Jesus! (ha)  * A little bird called to tell me that Ashley has made her final college decision, so she will be joining us in the Delta (sort of) when the fall comes around.  I couldn't think of a better pick-me-up in the middle of an all-together shitty week.  In the course of five minutes I went from thinking that the most productive thing I've done all year was learn a lot of Golden Girls episodes to knowing that I'll have more than a reason to stay and continue living this crazy life I've created for myself.  With Ashley so close by, all things will be possible.

      Is it wrong that I'm waiting to hear from someone that I barely know?  I would ask for comments, but my comment buttons seem to have gone the way of the two dollar bill, Mountain Berry Kool-Aid, and Jello Pudding Pops.  (I'm not sure where they ran off to, but Anya's are missing as well so I'm praying it's a problem with their site and not some catastrophic mistake with my template.)  At least I haven't gotten in the habit of hourly email checking.  Yes, I did email him.  But only after I had talked to him for a while online and then accidently blew him off by mentioning that I was chatting with a number of other people and didn't really have the time or intellectual capacity to keep our conversation going.  Rude? Yes.  But it very much goes along with the typical-heather "get it while it's hot" philosophy.  Which probably isn't my philosophy at all, and more likely the philosophy of some long-ago girlfriend who happenned to be much better looking and capable than myself.  Yesterday, a dear friend told me that I've become a  urlLink Pam Houston  character in the most sincere but searing way possible.  Where have I put my copy of  Waltzing the Cat ?

      Dear sweet  urlLink Lizzie  and all other concerned and/or overly vocal parties,  I have the following statements to make in my defense.  If anyone would like to contradict such statements, you may do so by posting on your own blog or sending disapproving email to me at  urlLink msjohnston02@hotmail.com .  As I said, in my defense... 1. "Bill" was indeed cute.  Whether or not he remains cute is something I cannot answer to.  I might not have been in the best state to make a true and lasting evaluation. 2. "Bill" also appeared to be rather intelligent, aside from the incessant insulting of Lizzie and his unyieldingly conservative viewpoints.  But hey, who among us hasn't ventured to the dark side?  Even Anya, princess liberal of the world (with me already occupying the role of queen) has had a figurative roll in the hay with someone who perfers elephants to donkeys. 3. Isn't that why God created porch swings in the first place? 4. Maybe I'll actually get in touch with him again and he can convince me of the merits of Pat Robertson.  (Oh wait, he didn't like Pat either.  Forget that one.) 5. If I recall correctly, no one was actually  outside  during the activities in question.  So what in the hell is wrong with you people?  If you were watching from the window then that is just sick.  Get your own damn porch swing. 6. Lastly, all of you love me enough to forgive this along with all of my other transgressions.  If I weren't out in the world consistently making an ass of myself, how would we have so many good stories to tell?  love always, carol headley hickey

       desks and crafting...  inevitable, beautiful disaster  My children are amazing artists.  And as "Sex in a Shoebox" has progressed, beautiful things have happenned.  However, one of the main side effects is that my room has been trashed at least half of the day for the past three days.  The following pics are documentation of the aftermath.  Brian Friel's rather rustic play,  Translations  inspired the use of grass(?) and dirt in a set that now appears to be a barn with an elaborate tile floor.  I now know that, yes, it is possible to create mini hay-bales using dry grass and a hot glue gun.  And I also know that it's a bitch to clean up.    My freshmen are becoming rather jealous and anxious that they haven't been allowed to spend their time "creating" in my class.  On more than one occasion, students have salvaged materials that have been left behind by Drama students in previous periods.  One particular precocious student (read: bright but terrible), employed a stray role of masking tape to decorate her desk while simultaneously securing her notes.    And so, the creativity continues.  It is a beautiful, beautiful thing.  *In other news, I'm getting better with the Blink.  Lower percentage of absolutely blurry pictures. Better at locating sources of light.  etc, etc, etc.  Hopefully I'll be halfway decent in time for the weekend's festivities.     HAPPY BIRTHDAY  urlLink FAITH

      The Heather List of Why: 1.  Why is it that since the time change I have perpetually been losing the hours between 4 and 7 in the afternoon?   2. Why must I wear a coat outside to smoke a cigarette when it is April and I live in Mississippi? 3. Why can fingernail polish only look good for 48 hours? 4. Why does my family have better things to do than sit at home and wait for me to call them? 5. Why am I happiest in my classroom when I'm essentially instructing art than when I'm doing my REAL job and teaching english? 6. Why do I have to come home every afternoon and kill enough flies to populate a thriving fly village? 7. Why is p.s. throwing a freakin party? 8. Why do I keep compiling and recompiling a CD in my head for someone that I'll probably never see again? 9. Why haven't I written in the  real  journal in nearly two weeks, knowing full well that my head has been more than full of things that have no place else to go except for those tiny lined pages? 10. Why did Ricky get kicked off? 11.  Why has everything in the world reminded me of my sister for the past three days?   Today's shots from the Blink: The "Sex in a Shoebox"  (originally bearing the more educational "Set in a Shoebox" title) progresses as  Waiting for Godot  takes shape.  Yes, seriously, this is going to be a set for Godot.  And it's going to be amazing.    In the course of searching for perfectly flat places on which to assemble tiny furniture, my desktop was located as the best available flat space.  Someone didn't notice my coffee cup.

So, in lieu of actually posting some impressive entry proving that I am indeed a talented writer and that I do have an interesting life (HA!)  I'm posting one of the first pictures I took this afternoon. Most of them are crap, but I fell like they're my babies.  So, if my babies are ugly, just smile and compliment them anyway.

Guess I'll get them back during one of my many breaks tonight as I try to finish this damn project.  Looks like I also need an email link and an archives link, but I'm really just talking to myself at this point.  I doubt the redesign is all that interesting to anybody else.

      So I just checked this thing on Mozilla, and it does look like a giant piece of crap.  Help?  Please?  The problem seems to be in the blogger code but that's as far as I can get with it.  If anybody can point me in the right direction that would be lovely.  I'm beginning to think a person shouldn't be allowed to have her own site when she spends so much time asking for help frm her friends.

      I'm going to bed early.  The allergies have returned and I'm feeling a bit defeated.  Things have righted themselves, in a way, with the whole teacher-manufactured essay thing. I had a chance to talk to the one teacher in the school that I can confide in today and she said quite a few things to ease my mind.  If she ever leaves that school, I'll follow her right through the doors.  On a brighter note, my seniors and I were resume manufacturing machines today.  Incredible productivity in a relatively short period of time.  It felt wonderful.  And best of all, one of my favorite kids let me help edit her essay (which she wrote) and it was so beautiful it almost made me cry.  Her essay will be accompanying a scholarship application that was only offered to those attending Lizzie's alma mater, so it would be the coolest thing ever if she actually gets the money.    American Idol was a giant letdown this week.  I hope I never have to listen to a disco song again as long as I live.  God bless my parents for getting married so young and completely missing the disco era so that I never had to listen to that crap when I was little.

I don't take it as seriously as many of my fellow Teacher Corps participants, but when it comes down to it, I'm never hesitant to get up in the morning and walk into the school with my coffee and gradebook in hand.    However, after today, I am more than tempted to hand in my letter of resignation to a school where the problems seem so huge and so deeply rooted that I can never change the way things work.  A brief summary:  I was involved in the selection of certain Seniors who were to be nominated for some scholarships given by members of the community.  The selection process was wonderful.  It was a love-fest of sorts, praising the wonderful students, many of whom are the reason I am happy to get out of bed in the morning. These kids deserve this money for school.  They deserve truckloads of it.  And when those trucks are empty, someone should refill them.  And now, with the scholarship deadline set as tomorrow, I've learned that the school might be even shadier than I thought.  While helping a number of students prepare their resumes and organize their application materials, it was brought to my attention that the vast majority of the applicants did not write their own essays.  In fact, the essays in question had been written by their senior English teacher.  In addition, a student came to me for help on his essay fully expecting that I was going to write it for him and left rather exasperated after I wouldn't give him a single word to write down.  If a school does not exist for the sole purpose of educating our children to be self-sufficient, intelligent adults, why does it exist at all?  I am frustrated and confused and tired.  I don't know what my next step will be.

      You're totally right.  I haven't posted in forever.  It's been so long that I've forgotten what typing in this little box is all about.  And I'm not feeling it tonight, with bags to pack and sisters to chill with, you'll just have to wait a bit longer... probably until I'm in Oxford wishing I had a life, but in actuality sitting in front of the computer with plenty of time to blab.  In the meantime, a quiz.  Yup, I am a fourteen year old girl.    urlLink        You'll Fall in Love With A  urlLink Gemini !

      Dear Nate,  For future reference, when making late night deliverys to my house, please try to refrain from throwing things at my window.  Items we have deemed unacceptable include rocks, small pieces of wood, and anything else that will scare the shit out of me.  Even if every light in the house appears to be off, it is still more appropriate to knock and/or ring the door bell in order to gain the attention of someone inside the house.  But thanks for the beer.  Love always, The Management

       Advice to Live By.  No, Seriously.   1. When dismissing class for lunch, be sure the kids are planning on running down the hall, screaming obscene rap lyrics and the phrase "OOOOOOHHHHH SSSIIIIIXXXXX"  as loud as they possibly can, because if you're lucky like me the principal will also be walking down the hall and will the proceed to not only deprive the children of lunch but also suspend them.  (Hot damn, something actuall worked for once.)  2. When dissecting one's own pinkie toe, be sure to do so in a completely unsterile environment, like a dirty classroom during a very quiet exam.  Also recommended are squeamish children, lack of bandaids, and not-so-quiet obscenities coming out of your mouth as you become increasingly convinced that injured toe will fall onto the floor, as it appears injured enough to become severed from your body.  3. When you KNOW that a soda company is trying to lure you in and try some new uber-cool carbonated beverage, give in once in a while, because now and then that beverage will be Sprite: Remix, which happens to fucking rock.  4. Don't try to quit smoking because it leaves your best friend to go outside alone and read books in the dark and almost burn themselves and feel alltogether neglected and unwanted.  I mean, who are you kidding, you didn't really think you had any will power, did you?  5. When making weekend plans, try to make them as ambiguous and complicated as possible.  This way, people will get confused and you'll always have an alibi that you were supposed to be somewhere else with someone else.  (It's best to start making things complicated at least a week in advance.  That way, even you will become so confused that it will be impossible for anyone to get their stories straight.)

       I've never been this bored.  Ever.   A poem before I shower and/or sleep:   You only love when you love in vain.  Try another radio probe when ten have failed, take two hundred rabbits when a hundred have died: only this is science.  You ask the secret. It has just one name: again.  -- Miroslav Holub  Ode to Joy

      Here, at night, they spray for mosquitos.  Mid 80's pick-up trucks rigged up with rust and metallic SuperSoaker sprayers, looking like the type of dream one might catch on a too-hot summer's day, misting the neighborhood with cool water and dishing out fifty-cent rainbow snowcones from the passenger's side window.  But instead, the whishing hum of spray leaks chemicals up and down Washington Avenue, already strapped with decades of lead paint sealing windows so tightly that a hot day inside feels less like a Club Med sauna and more like an antiquated Southern-gothic tomb.  And when the trucks pass, in those few minutes before sleep thinking, "Yes, I did set the alarm," and "No, I won't have time to iron that in the morning," while all the night's mental housekeeping comes to a close, I worry two things. One, I am sure the well-meaning mass distribution of chemicals will peel the paint off my car that remains casually parked on the street, perpetually safe from the speeding cars that pass not six inches from its side for hours and hours.  And two, even though the windows won't open again in my lifetime, the overly efficient central air is quickly venting those same chemicals, the ones that will eventually cost me a bundle to restore the car's silver sparkle, into my bedroom.  And while I drift off to sleep, I am breathing them in, odorless and benign, probably killing my ovaries or some other organ that seems utterly meaningless at the moment.  In lieu of worrying about my ovaries, which will no doubt only bring me trouble in the future, the trouble of husbands and babies and old issues of Redbook in HMO sanctioned doctor's offices, I worry about my car.  And for the meantime I park it in the driveway, politely at the end, patiently awaiting my predictable departure at 6:40 a.m. again tomorrow morning as it has been every morning since August, at least three feet away from any potential city-sanctioned biological warfare that may or may not be killing my unborn children.

       Things Not To Do with Your Weekend   1. Ruin perfectly good Friday night with insanely long school function, complete with matching outfits and fashion show. 2. Ruin perfectly good Saturday night inter-friend drama that included way too many instances of walking off and ensuing search parties.  (Seriously people, this sort of thing is okay once in an evening, but twice?) 3. Go to sleep at 10 on a Friday night leaving your lovely out-and-about roommate to sulk on the porch and stare at her car in the driveway, contemplating late night trips to parts unknown. 4. Spot N.C.B at karaoke, realize he's a complete loser, and then have perfectly lovely friend comment, "He's kinda chunky in the rear."  (quote courtesy of Sponge Brad Square Pants) 5. Get stuck in "Show Fest" (a.k.a Completely Retarded Low-Rider Truck Convention/ Traffic Problem) only to find it's really a taping for Girls Gone Wild.  (ref:  urlLink faith )   Things To Do with Your Weekend   1. Leave large quantities of alcoholic beverages in your bestfriend's fridge.  (Thanks Lizzie!  Do we owe you anything?) 2. Allow your bestfriend's boyfriend to pose as country music's best kept secret in a karaoke honky tonk. 3. Don outfits suitable only for washed-up 70's reminescent pimps. 4. Have rotating-fake-boyfriend set-up to throw off aforementioned nasty redneck fling. 5. Rename "Show Fest" the Insane Sleeveless-Shirt Festival and make fun of the correlation between bacon consumption and low-rider truck ownership as witnessed at the Shoney's Breakfast Buffet.

       a note of some interest     Legend: PDD4= Potential Delta Distraction number four (preceeded chronologically by PDD1, whom we shall call elvis c.; PDD2, whom we shall call "totally in love with my best friend;" and PDD3, who shall forever be affectionately referred to as N.C.B ref:  urlLink Lizzie's blog )  RIA= Random Internet Absence MHB= Mysterious Hard-to-get Behavior AHTC= Absolutely Hot Teacher Chick  Dear PDD4, In light of your recent yet continuing RIA, the Rho Sisterhood is  considering  imposing certain limitations on any and all future contact with your new friend whom you may now refer to as AHTC.  Your behavior is perplexing, as by all accounts you had a lovely time porch-sitting on Monday, May 12, in the 2003rd year of our Lord.  And we, as sisters, have no choice but to deduce that you are inflicting some sort of strange MHB on one of our most prestigious members.  This notice reaches you to inform you that such behavior is generally only tolerated for a maximum of 48 hours, but seeing as how you're entirely interesting and alarmingly tall and charming, you have been given an additional 48 hour extension.  If you fail to contact the aforementioned AHTC prior to 10:32 p.m. on Saturday, May 17th, you can just forget it.  This AHTC has better things to do with her time, and an amazingly grueling schedule of boy-craziness to keep up with.  She cannot afford to be bogged down wondering if another random PDD finds her attractive, alluring, irresistable, etc.  She is all of the above, and if you haven't figured that out yet, then you'll definitely never get a namesake as appealing as PDD3.  Here's hoping that your seemingly benign allergies have actually turned into something much more serious, like lung cancer, as to justify your inability to chat, call, or come see me.    Sincerely, Carol Headley Hickey vice prez until Lizzie kicks the bucket, or runs off with Sponge Brad Square Pants  p.s.  Daddy, this wasn't the post that you were supposed to find interesting.  Please scroll down.  LY!

       Because I was inspired, and similarly bored    urlLink Krissa's  thursday and friday posts always tend to be large accumulations of one thing or another, and I think it's finally time to mimic her.   These are my memories.  Please reference Krissa's post to put it all in perspective.  I haven't lived nearly as many places as she has, and I might throw in one or two that were only month-long abodes just to spice it up a bit, but for those who were there maybe it will be a teeny bit interesting.   Gallatin, TN  1980 - 1993  Three dogwoods in a row, mine taller and skinner than the rest Picking up trash along the front of the yard The Cutlass, with initials scratched into the backs of the seats Meeting Sarah at the corner Sitting in the driveway, missing my dad Numerous manifestations of being "accident prone" The neverending yellow-and-greenness of my room   Soddy-Daisy, TN  1993 - 1998  Learning the value of porch time My first and worst bestfriend Late night trips to Chester Frost Park Staying on the phone so long that my ear hurt The wisdom and humor of Katie in our ongoing note correspondence Pre-competition Mock Trial sex talks   Knoxville, TN  1998 - 2002  Moving the coffee table and Destiny's Child The religion of starbucks My bench outside the library East Stadium Hall 130 and the cult of the LRC The smell of old plastic in the paleo cast lab Double Tray Days in Dr. Logan's class Trolley Rides The KAT bus My tree at Taliwa The pink bathroom Walking with a purpose The giant vent outside Humanities Fountain swimming Fountain bubble blowing Nail-polish parties The Laundry Channel   Unicoi Mountain, NC Summer 2000  Dampness everywhere. Dirt everywhere. Knowing what it's like to be damp and dirty at the same time. Learning that butterflies eat poo.

The feeling of unshaven legs against sleeping bag nylon.   Washington, DC Summer 2001  Long walks in skirts and uncomfortable shoes. Windowless offices. Escaping to exhibits, learning on lunch. Learning how to drink inappropriately The buzz of the big city The glory of a working mass-transit system The bucket guy outside Natural History Cranberry muffins and coffee Lily Thursdays That desperate sense of wishing I knew how to be cool   Oxford, MS Summer 2002  Penny pitchers.

       Top Ten Ways to Thorougly Piss Me Off   in no particular order    Disclaimer: In light of recent blog faux paus, this blog is intended to be a joke.  A very large, not entirely humorous joke.  Any mention of loved ones are not made to be hurtful, but instead intended to be lovely little, punch-in-the-ribs humorous statements.    1. Rain, a lot. 2. Serve something lame, like corn dogs, for lunch when I'm so hungry I could eat my own arm. 3. Label your hair color box "Dark Golden Blonde" when you really meant "Kinda Reddish Brown." 4. Disappear from IM conversations that might not have been interesting in the first place but are still worthy of a measley, "I'm going off to do something more interesting now." 5. Send me emails with contradictory, sage-like relationship advice when you're in love with a freakin country music singer. 6. Not call and apologize.  (Thanks, mom.) 7. Claim that I "lost" your stupid Drama book, when I distinctly recall writing YOUR name in it and not mine.  8. Use me for my porch. 9. Make today Wednesday instead of Friday.  (How in the world is it only Wednesday?) 10. Not be able to regenerate yourself, such as the ever dwindling population of cigarettes in the current pack.

       And every picture has a middle.   I might have been living in a mold-infested dorm room, decorated only with a "Kurt Vonnegut in the U.C. Auditorium" poster, but it still had a certain charm.  Mailboxes that never opened, a front door that you could only get into if God himself assisted you in swiping your ID card, a lobby lacking in both a television and friendly people.  But, on a positive note, the front steps offered a view down the street toward the EPA, with it's tiny reflecting pool, down towards all the buildings of government finance.  And I could sit on those steps without really getting in anyone's way and watch the people come and go.    And so I sat that day, on those almost wide steps, pretending to read the Metro section of the twenty-five cent Post, waiting for him to walk up after zigzagging down the street to avoid construction fences, cranes, and homeless people.  And eventually he did show up, looking like he hadn't brushed his hair in a week and like he'd never seen an iron in his lifetime, smiling that same smile that had gotten me in trouble a couple of nights before.  I wish I could say what we said on those steps.  That conversation has faded away like so many others before and since.  But let it suffice to say that I knew I was going to follow him and that somehow I knew this was the ending of something rather than the beginning.  We walked back to the Metro, talking about work and what our other friends were doing and what they would think if they spotted us together.  We took the  urlLink Green Line  all the way to Fort Totten talking more about the people around us than what was going on between us.  We walked to his car, past the "Kiss and Ride," and drove to his house in what I then called the ghetto, what I would now call the quaintly forgotten and unfortunately gang-ridden.  He had two roommates (one shirtless and Italian and the other middle-aged and vaguely pschyzophrenic), a matress on the floor, stacks of CDs that must have taken up at least half of the space he had in his car when he moved, and letters all over the floor around his unmade bed from the girlfriend back home, decorated with doodles and colored pens and metallic stick-on stars.

       Every picture has an intro.   My office was peach.  Good ole 1986, country kitsch, peach.  But I did have hardwood floors, thanks to some long ago employee with allergies so bad that carpet couldn't (or wouldn't) be tolerated.  And it was in that windowless office, hidden behind a door, thirty feet from Mr. Roger's sweater and Fonzie's leather jacket, that I checked my email at least a hundred times that afternoon.  He was locked away in the Federal Reserve, writing code for some overly complex economics computer program, interpretable by only Alan Greenspan himself or some other faceless semi-important political figure.  But every so often I'd get an email.  A sentence or two at best.  First:"Yeah, we should see each other tonight."  Then:"I guess we could meet when I get off work." My replies were all dated thirty seconds after his emails, the frantic actions of a girl trying to pretend like she didn't know what she was doing.  I took the Blue Line.  Smithsonian, Federal Triangle, Metro Center, McPherson Square, Farragut West, stopping only once after getting off the up escalator, arriving at street level to a compliment from a beautiful woman who had been commuting with me.  "That dress is absolutely gorgeous."  "Thanks," I said, feeling almost sure of what I was doing.  I walked down 19th, past the World Bank, the homeless sleeping in the park, to my dorm where I would sit on the steps and wait, watching the line for the bus on the corner grow and then shrink, grow and then shrink.

       Scrawled on a Post-It on my bedroom door this morning...    Heather, The internet called.  It misses you.  You haven't posted anything more than lame middle-schoolesque quizzes and one sentences entries including unacceptable phrases like "holy crap" in ages.  Get back to work, woman!  And, one last thing, did you write a check for rent? Kisses, John   Okay, so maybe I lied.  Maybe there wasn't a post-it on my door this morning.  But I know people have been talking, wondering if I've lost my touch.  And yeah, I probably have.  I've spent all my time thinking about how school is almost over, how I still have a million things left to do, how I'm feeling entirely too little anxiety about the fact that I didn't teach my kids much of anything this year, how the first years are probably graduating from college right this very second, how my bed hasn't been made in more than a week.  But I'm still here, attempting to pay bills, teach something every now and then, and have teensy-tinsy bits of fun every now and then.  And as for John, he'd probably never sign a note with "kisses," but the fact that he will now, just to mimic this entry, and the fact that he got up TWICE this week to smoke with me on the porch before I left for school make him the absolute undisupted coolest guy I know.

I want to have lots of readers and I'm under the delusion that you will read any stupid thing that I take the time to post!   The long and short of it is that all typepad sites are still password protected, whether I want you to read them or not.  I'll keep you informed as to when the password protection comes down so that everyone can scurry over to see what I'm writing there.

       Something new and possibly interesting.   Instead of working on Task 8 (DAMNIT!), I finally got access into my new TypePad site.  TypePad is going to be a blog type hosting thingie that uses all of the elements of the highly acclaimed and highly complicated MoveableType.  So, I've been tweaking things just a bit and once I get Task 8 finished, I'm going to go in and make the thing fucking dazzling.  In the meantime, you can visit and be jealous of me for being a beta tester.  I'll post a permanent link sometime later in the day.   urlLink The Magnolia Cafe   p.s.  I changed the name so that those among us who are easily confused (namely me) would be able to distinguish between the old and the new.

       How in the world do people do this?  -Throughout history there have been instances of women using all sorts of men for their own whims.  Admittedly, such trends are more present in the male population and I'd be hard pressed to name five blue-blooded devious man-manipulaters (this is why the site has comments), but on to the truth of the matter.  First, a brief interlude of description: Boy One: Not alarmingly handsome but alarmingly witty and tall.  Has precisely same sense of humor as yours truly, so much so that he finds it appropriate to squeeze my leg when vastly inappropriate woman in movie theater screams, "Girl!  Your boyfriend... he CRAZY!" during The Hulk.  Cute in that, "ya know, I'd bet you'd still be cute when you wake up in the morning" sort of way. Drives giant truck.  Has very demanding job.  Has strange but entirely delightful tactile attachments.  Boy Two: Alarmingly charming and borderline gorgeous. Equally tall but not equally witty.  Has already figured out that keeping me in my place could easily be a twentyfour hour a day job.  Seems to have odd need to recharge his internal battery while in my presence, then expend all that energy in short bursts of flirting/ making out/ flinging me around the room.  Recently unemployed and even more recently reemployed in similarly very demanding job.  Has strange but occasionally delightful machismo redneck urges like four-wheeling. (?)  As for the weekend: Friday night, Boy One took me on a hastily planned but throughly enjoyable date, complete with movie, gas station cherry coke, inappropriate conference room behavior, lots of laughter and speeding trucks.  Boy One stayed really late.  As in, "yes, I think it's time to make coffee" late.  Boy Two was noticeably absent, having not contacted me since Thursday.  However, having Boy One and Boy Two in same place at same time might have created a rather large disturbance of the "I think it's time to call the cops" variety.  Saturday night, Boy One has plans to come over but gets paged to go in to work because of impending internet disaster.  Boy two remains MIA until eleven pm when he abruptly appears online, chats me up about this and that, and then elects not to come over because of his post-work-stench and impending sleep deprivation.  Boy one shows up online at one am, well past appropriate dating hours, to inform me of the ridiculous nature of his job and the sad news that he absolutely wont be coming over for the evening.  Sunday's plans include phone calls and/or visits from both boy one and boy two.   Hopefully this will all resolve itself in the near future.  And as I drive the speed limit into the Tennessee hills on Wednesday, I wanted to make sure that it had been documented that I had TWO boys after me and I elected to go home for a bit and risk one or both of them losing interest in my absence, because that is the sort of thing that happens to women who try to juggle too many men at once.  Note: The decision of whom to call Boy One and whom to call Boy Two was eventually made on the basis of chronology, despite the fact that Boy One has already played a bit of a disappearing act on me.  He still came first, so he gets to be Boy One for better or worse.  God, was that a wedding pun?

       Home again.   Back in G'ville, waiting for something of interest to happen.  Knowing full well that I don't have the number of hours in the weekend to do everything that must be done by monday morning.  Summer school is playing out to be one of God's crueler jokes and/or oxymorons.

      Okay, if you spotted it during the middle of the day it looked quite different than it does right now.  Which is a good thing because some god of awful-colors took control of my spirit earlier in the day and had this thing looking like a carnival ride.  So, this is the template for now.  I'll probably change the pic at the top with some regularity.  And those boxy looking links at the top are pretty nifty but only half of them work.  I'll figure out all the kinks sometime this weekend.  In the meantime, enjoy.

      When you're still talking about Monday as being the weekend, you can count yourself amongst the very lucky or the very delusional.  Unfortunately, I find myself strongly grounded in the later group.  The day has been a blur of exams and editing adventures and a thousand twenty minute naps thrown in an attempt to keep myself conscious.  But I guess through all of it, I may have learned a few things.  Yes, this is when I write another bulleted list and everyone groans because I have sold out yet again.  Well, deal with it.  And pray to god that someday you will have children so brillant that their minds will function so effeciently that they too will think in bulleted lists.  Things I have learned in the past 50 or so hours: * Having the Good Will Hunting soundtrack in your truck might make you the coolest guy to ever walk the face of the earth. * Having the Good Will Hunting soundtrack in your truck does not necessarily make you the coolest guy to ever walk the face of the earth. * If you're really really trying to hide something, never admit to having it in the first place, because from that point on it's just a matter of the other person finding it. * If you have the urge to camp, just go, and don't worry about stupid shit like where you'll get a tent.  Because when you start to think, that means that you will NOT go camping, and that's just sad. * Never tell so much of the truth that you keep yourself from having quality lie material in the future. * Don't be the first one to call the day after, because someone you aren't expecting will answer the phone every damn time. * Reserve the right to spend an entire day on the couch and still manage to call yourself productive with a straight face. * Screw notecards.  Who in the hell invented them in the first place? * Don't plan two major brain-occupying events for the same weekend.  You'll end up out on the porch with a friend and an increasingly empty pack of cigarettes and a sob story that nobody really wanted to hear in the first place.

       Dear Readers,  I hate to do this.  Really.  But things are just too busy and crappy for me to update while I'm in class in Oxford.  No quick internet connection in the house, no time to get to the lab and type away on frivolous things, and the list goes on.  So, this offiicially announces the temporary hiatus of Magnolia Coffee updates.  Sorry for the bad news.  We'll get back to writing when things are less busy.  Until then, happy living, happy flirting, and summer fun, The Coffee Mistress

      I'm pretty sure that today sucked.  We have compiled a list of evidence supporting such:  1. I am back to being alone in this damn huge house due to John's hasty return home to take care of family stuff. 2. Five slow hours in a car. 3. Unreturned text messages, and tardily returned phone calls. 4. The lingering feeling that I've forgotten something immensely important. 5. Something that is beginning to feel a lot like depression. 6. The thought that I'm smothering my very new, very exciting romance.  In cross-examination, the following evidence was revealed to prove that I might very well be full of shit: 1. Last night, five a.m. (details will not be forth coming) 2. A boy who will play "Crazy in Love" without being asked, while I'm in the bathroom so that I can dance and sing undisturbed. 3. My house is still pretty darn cool.

      So, when I am bored, I sit at home and type random things on my computer, and follow links from one lame website to the next.  And once in a while I find something that makes me laugh my ass off, and it is in those moments that I think, "Hey, maybe the people who read the blog would laugh their asses off, too."  Feel free to thank me in the form of blank checks of fresh baked goods.  The site is  urlLink googlism.com,  and in order to mine the depths of their genius, simply type in anything (I used names) to discover what the internet already knows about you.  For example purposes, I'll post my two favorite lists supplied by  urlLink Googlism , one concerning my apparently very ambitious brother, and the other for my dad.  Try not to laugh so hard that you injure yourself.  A search for Todd Johnston yielded the following: todd johnston is a newly appointed ambassador and will serve the miami/fort lauderdale todd johnston is also an active consultant with non todd johnston is heading up the project todd johnston is she"  Um, not so sure about that last one.  Feel free to leave feedback or conjecture in the comments.   And Roger Johnston, for which the last statement is quite possibly the funniest thing I've ever read: roger johnston is technically orientated executive with extensive experience in general and marketing management roger johnston is a project and team leader in the chemical science and technology division at los alamos national laboratory roger johnston is executive vice president and chief credit roger johnston is a man rapidly approaching middle age roger johnston is how polite he is roger johnston is named "wanker of the week" for some damn fool thing he did  Now, go have fun, kids!

       This is the best I can do, seriously.    I wrote a long email to a friend this morning, to recap the weekend, and now I'm going to be superlame and post the email to inform the rest of the world about the weekend.  There are reasons that I'm not writing real posts, and I'm sure I'll get to them eventually.  But most of the appropriate people have been informed of the problems, so if you're not in the know, don't worry your pretty little head because all will be revealed in time.   Unnamed Friend,   Hmm, the weekend.  Thus far it's been pretty eventful, and with any luck, tonight will be fun as well, since it will be our next-to-last Sunday night of freedom, before school starts back.     Thursday night was a complicated mess.  I went to a party with my friends, didn't know anyone there, and thirty minutes into it the guy that I'm currently dating called to say that he was in fact NOT leaving for St. Louis (at least not until the morning) and that I should come to Cleveland.  (The party was in Lake Village.)  I decided to go, but as soon as I walked out of the house, my friend's dog was hit by a car and killed.  A bit of a downer, to say the least.  But I went to Cleveland anyway, after an interlude of grief counseling, and proceeded to keep aformentioned boy up until 3:15, precisely fifteen minutes before he had to leave to drive to St. Louis, because I'm just that sort of girl.   Friday night we decided to go out and were on our way to check out a new bar on Poplar when we realized that Afroman was performing at One Block and made a beeline there (because Afroman in Greenville is not to be missed, under any circumstance.)  I managed to get us in for free, employing the ever-useful "we're poor teachers" excuse, and we enjoyed afroman with a not entirely enthusiastic crowd of about thirty people.  It was more like having Afroman play in your living room than a real club show, but my friend Jenny managed to get Afroman's kids (who were backing up the band on keyboards) to have a dance off and then win the undying love and affection of Afroman himself, leading us all to speculate about who would be sleeping where if Jenny did in fact decide to bring Afroman home.  But apparently Jenny was more interested in charming the kids than in charming the one and only Afroman so the fun ended there, except for the fact that John did manage to get Afroman's autograph which was recorded in my very own journal.   Last night was by far the most eventful, mainly because we were the centers of attention for an extended period of time.   To introduce my two newest friends to Greenville night life, we took them to the Sandbar so that we could all proceed to sing our asses off.  We made the ill-advised decision to start the night off with a Dixie Chicks song, which got cries of "we don't like that shit in here" from the old foogies at the bar, who in fact had no right to say anything because not once did they sing.  But thanks to the mesmerizing capabilities of my tubetop and hair flinging, the bar guys were won over by the end of the song and after a couple more numbers we were actually getting requests from random people in the bar.  (Not that we can actually sing, I think it was much more of a stage presence issue; that, and they probably just wanted to watch semi-pretty girls get up on stage and dance around.)  I sang at least six times that I can remember (the bar was pretty empty) and probably a couple more times that I've forgotten.  The night's premiere performance came when our all-girl quartet decided to sing Bootylicious (and dance of course).  We were dazzling.  And then a guy was supposed to sing "strokin" immediately after and refused to get on stage.  To which, Sarah grabbed the mic from the host guy, walked over to the chicken-guy's table and said, "So what you're trying to tell us is that you're not ready for this jelly?"  It was absolutely so much fun that it should have been illegal.   I suppose that's all the news that's fit to print.  I'm rather thankful that I've had an interesting weekend.  It wouldn't be good if you had to live vicariously through my typical "sit on the couch and watch Trading Spaces" weekend.   Carole

       In Remembrance   Lizzie called yesterday, and we had our usually who-is-doing-whom conversation which drifted into an oration on how much this summer sucks and how it appears to be getting even suckier as the days go by (in spite of how much attention some of us are getting).    And so, in honor of last summer, which may have been the coolest summer of my young life, I found a link to serve as an homage of sorts to everything that summer is (and always will be) in our memories.  I present to you the  urlLink Ya-Ya Name Generator .  When experimenting on my own, I discovered the following, all-too-truthful results: (Real names appear in italics, and last names have been omitted to protect the innocent.) *Princess Serious-as-a-Heartattack  Heather  *Viscountess Young Chicken  Carole  *Duchess Chirps Like a Bluejay  Amber  *Viscountess Purrs Like a Kitten  Lizzie  ... apparently our noble prez has some animal issues she isn't telling us about. *Countess Similing Coyote  Carey  *Countess Cold Shower  Faith  *Viscountess Runs-with-the-bulls  Erin  *Princess Weeping River  Amy   I'll try to refrain from comment about the ridiculous accuracy of some of the above names, and instead I'll go get some damn sleep.

       Barefootnhippie Comments and other related bullshit   Since I'm not posting, and no one else has comments, Faith gets my two cents, as always.  And it goes a little something like this...  I had one of those big long weeks where you spend a lot of time inside your own head.  And I guess I made a lot of decisions about myself and my place in the world.  And I think my only misstep in all of that is that I didn't share it with anybody.  But I didn't even realize what had been happenning until I sat at the picnic table with John after lunch and finally had ten minutes to let it all out.  And even then, I couldn't find a way to say any of without some sort of wiser-than-thou pretext, but John can overlook that so easily that I knew I could finally talk.  (Remember people, these are our lifelong friends.  How we all seemed to simultaneously forget that, I can't be sure.)  You see, all my life I've never known where the brakes are.  I've never cared to know.  It's always been one dramatic swerve around a corner followed by a confusing road then another swerve, usually in an opposite direction.  But somehow, I seem to have grown up, thanks mainly to one new friend and one new boy who, when combined, have strengthened whatever little perspective on the world I've been trying to formulate in the last 23 years.  And somehow I've finally realized that THIS is it.  This isn't some lovely little stop-over while I wait for my life to get rolling.  This IS my life and it can only be what I make it.  And in a way, I guess I'm saying that from a somewhat privileged position, knowing that my sister is closer now than she has been in five years, and knowing that I'm in a relationship that is more comfortable and challenging than anything I've ever gotten myself into.  So about class and friends and that little "d" word that everyone keeps throwing around... I came in with a chip on my shoulder.  And those "dark cloud" people that I want to slap in the face every time I see them, well, I just couldn't take it anymore.  Saturday morning was my breaking point because I was finally tired of there always being someone who felt obligated to bring people down and who thought it was their job to remind everyone that this is a less-than-ideal situation.  Maybe I stepped on some toes.  (I do clearly recall getting screamed at.)  But I still don't give a damn, because, god help us, all of this has to be about LOVE.  We have to get up in the morning and go to these falling-down-around-your-ears schools because we LOVE being there.  We have to go to Oxford and get "educated" because we LOVE the people that have amazingly been placed in our lives.  We have to come home to our entirely cheap and beautiful houses because we LOVE our roommates and the solace of the enviroment we've each been lucky enough to create for ourselves.  And, most of all I suppose, we have to LOVE ourselves for being crazy enough to do any of this in the first place.  Yes, I realize all of that sounds like more bullshit than anything that was labeled as such in class.  But, in all honesty, every word of it was said with greater truth than anything else that's ever been posted on this blog.  And in grand-blog-style, all of it remains under the heading of comments to barefootnhippie, as it all so beautifully falls under the mantra and motivation of that site.

      Oh my goodness, it's so totally Wednesday, and thanks to the faithful support of the "Till Wednesday Siege" Support Group, I appear to have survived.  Of course, all will not be revealed/consumated until said "Till Wednesday" Enforcer gets off work and makes his final decision about whether or not this damned wednesday mess has reached its conclusion.  Hopefully there will be much to post later.  Or better yet, maybe there will be nothing to post because it will all be of too graphic of a nature for the unflinchingly pure-minded readers I have.

       28  totally unrelated thoughts, insights, current events, plans for world peace and/or domination...   1. I'm spending too much time on the phone, so quit freakin calling me. 2. I was kidding, keep calling.  I promise I'll talk. 3. Karaoke is the devil in disguise. 4. There may not be such a thing as a "free lunch" but you can sure as hell get a free dinner in Greenville. 5. Devious plots are fun, especially when they lead to "I can tell this story at your wedding/funeral/post-breakup-sob-fest" conversations after devious plot has been successfully carried out. 6. Boys who watch Sex and the City are deep, but not necessarily in ways that one might think. 7. If your friend decides to wear a wool tubetop in August, go along with it. 8. If you don't know what a "woogie" or a "hoo-hoo" is, you should call me. (see above) 9. "New Boy" is freakin awesome. 10.  The "Till Wednesday Seige" will certainly be the death of me. 11. I've decided to do absolutely no planning for school. 12. Ok, so maybe I'll plan a little bit, but it's already getting late so I'll sleep in tomorrow and I have other non-school stuff to accomplish, so maybe Tuesday is more my day. 13. Yeah, I know you other losers are out there planning your asses off.  Suckers. 14. I still think I should buy some Nutella just because Kobe Bryant is on the label. 15. I'm scared of going to pay rent tomorrow because the rent people are mean and they're going to scream at me. 16. More than likely, I'll scream back. 17. And then I'll get arrested. 18. But my dad still owes me one Get Out of Jail Free card, so I might have to use it. 19. I'm thinking maybe I should sweep my room because the dust bunnies are bigger than my head. 20. And there are dirty dishes in the sink.  Again. 21. Perhaps I should consider the merits of anorexia to prevent this never-ending supply of dirty dishes. 22. I spent nearly three hours writing in my journal today. 23. Mostly about the "Till Wednesday Siege" and an unnamed brainstorm that is conquering my tiny little mind. 24. The low: realizing that free dinner wasn't worth being somewhere that I didn't really want to be. 25. The high: that  look  in his eyes when we both know it sure as hell isn't Wednesday, but we can both tell that we wish it were. 26. The bad: Looks like the terror level will probably rise sometime this week.  Again. 27. The ugly: You should see these mosquito bites. 28. The good: I've smiled so much in the past two weeks that I should be arrested.

       For the sake of cheesiness   No, I haven't been posting.  No, I don't feel bad about it.  Went driving with Jenny tonight on a covert mission to Cleveland.

So, song lyrics, and that's all you're getting out of me, you greedy little bastards.    Break Away John Mayer    If melody is my destiny Then what's left of me I'll give to you  If next to me Is all that you need to be Would you settle for fantasy If its the best you could do  Can I have my cake Can I have you too Would you follow me Could I ask you to  Would the world between us Break these ties We've work so hard to realize Can postcard say What I see in your eyes Could I ever break away  Would I be satisfied And find peace inside Rolling half my life Over broken white lines  Can I have my cake Can I have you too Would you follow me Could I ask you to  Will I wake up one morning And see your face And streaks on the window That the rainstorm makes Could you bear all the weight And the strength that it takes Could I ever break away  Can I have my cake Can I have you too Would you follow me Could I ask you to  Would the world between us Break these ties We've worked so hard to realize Can a postcard say What I see in your eyes Could I ever break away

BM: The proof is that he was getting answers from the girl in front of him. BM: Is this true? Shitless Kid: I ain't cheat on no test. TP (thought bubble): Dude, he just said "aint" and used a double negative. TP: I had all the proof I needed to give (Shitless Kid) a zero on his test. BM: Well, he hasn't ever been in any trouble and I just want to make sure that this doesn't affect his grade because he's a good kid and he doesn't need any trouble with his grades and he needs to pass all his classes and he's a very good kid and... TP (thought bubble): Does she breathe? TP: Yes, ma'am.  I'll allow him to retake the test individually. SK: I ain't gonna remember what was on that test! TP (thought bubble): No shit, kid.

      I've been thinking, the vast majority of these overly popular (read: very readable, entertaining and addictive) blogs have some sort of theme.   urlLink JR  has his "interesting picture and wickedly hilarious yet brief" posting theme.   urlLink Krissa  has her "wise and worldly young New Yorker" thing going on, spouted off in snippets that seem more like something from a movie than someone's real life.   urlLink Allison  is just plain-fuckin-literary.  Even  urlLink Faith  has her "I'm getting through my day in the following ways..." approach.  And still, I seem to have not caught on.  The "these are random comments about my love life and my job with entirely too many lists" approach lends itself to my writing a bunch of boring shit every couple of days.    Therefore, I need a theme.  And I challenge you losers to come up with one.  I'll write about whatever you want, but you must leave any and all suggestions in the comments box.  In fact, all worthy suggestions will be honored with at least two weeks of posting related to the suggested theme.  I'm challenging you losers, and I swear I'll hold up my end of the bargain.

      1. Regain sense of honesty and zippiness on blog. 2. Go back to not using Yahoo Messenger at work due to almost sexual conversation yesterday with unnamed person that could have easily been discovered while sitting silently on desktop. 3. Figure out what in the hell is going on with "my boyfriend". 4. Stay the hell away from Wal-mart, and it's evil money-sucking ways. 5. Clean the SHIT out of my car.  (Yes, indeed, at this point there might be certifiable excrement in there and I wouldn't know because it could easily be buried under a pile of NuGrape cans and empty cigarette packs.) 6. Do something about cuticles. 7. Post more often so that my friends will stop making lame jokes about me not posting. 8. Celebrate neo-fall octoberness with  urlLink her queen loveliness  in spite of the fact that she called me bitchy for the millionth time this week. 9. Buy groceries for the first time in two months. 10. Decide what I'm doing with my life.

       Props to...   1. My two homies who actually NOTICED that I cut all my hair off. Faith with her too-lovely Ashleyesque remark and Andrew with his cutie-pie "Hey, Haircut" greeting yesterday morning.  2. Me for not vomiting on myself over  urlLink this chick  whom I distinctly remember as being a dirty blond haired, freckled chick with a serious "I'm a talented band chick" bad attitude in high school.  Reunions should be a world of fun.  3. Barbeque.  Speaking of which, anybody need 3 racks of ribs, 3 whole chickens, 2 giant ziplocks of leg quarters, 2 pork loins, or 5 pounds of barbeque?  First come, first serve, people.  4. My "boyfriend," who has recently learned to hide presents under my pillow before I go to sleep.  5. The weekend.  Thank you weekend for existing, even if I had to spend most of you driving and stressed out.  6. FOOTBALL.  Tennessee won.  Florida lost, mainly because we kicked their asses.  And Alabama lost, again, to a team with "Northern" in their name.  Isn't that the equivalent to getting beaten by a high school junior varsity team?

      Does anyone else love how you can come to school in clothes that don't actually fit feeling good-ole-on-the-rag-bloated, and then get called J.Lo two dozen times and on your way back from lunch be serenaded by the new B2K song?  Just wondering.

      Dear  urlLink Bitch ,  As for defining terms, it's not that the area has been overlooked.  In fact, the area has been a bit over-explored and over-defined, if I do say so myself.    At present moment my title is "Full Time Lover," a recent promotion from "Part Time Lover" which apparently "my boyfriend's" friends thought was a bit rude, not to mention an inaccurate description of our relationship.  Not that the current title is that much better.  I can, however, tolerate it in all of its ridiculousness as I am "butt-crazy in love".  Thanks for wondering, Sell-Out

       In other news...   1. He's not my boyfriend. 2. Progress reports and ETV can kiss my ass. 3. God bless the child that told me I looked like a size 8 this morning. 4. Does anybody remember why I've now given up four consecutive weekends and am planning on sacrificing the next three? 5. I'm still freakin sick.  I sound like I have black lung or something equally nasty. 6. My internet finally works at school so I can get back to not doing any damn work.  Thank goodness. 7. Oh yeah, he's still my "boyfriend," just not my boyfriend.  The quotes are essential. 8. My "boyfriend" worked approximately 16 hours yesterday.  Poor baby. 9. If you don't have $9.48, I will burn John Mayer for you, but it's good enough to spend the money.  Something about #4 makes me think of someone that I haven't talked to in a long time.  And one song sounds annoyingly Phil Collins-y, but that can be overlooked. 10.  I plan on jamming to said John Mayer cd while driving to the "boyfriend's" house this afternoon after he works another approximately 16 hour day.

      I've had a scary-headache night.  And an I-really-want-to-be-with-my-boyfriend night.    Relationships constantly strike me as strange, once you're in them, realizing you're thinking about things and dealing with things that would have never even existed if some cosmic force hadn't positioned your life in this direction.  Tonight I'm cursing Winn-Dixie inventory, and the fact that my man will be working long hours all weekend.  I want to write poetry.  And sleep.  But in the meantime, I'll be listening to  urlLink this .

      Today was remarkably devoid of any tragic occurances, including but not limited to the following: *students spazzing out, screaming all over the place, passing contagious verbal diarrhea about the classroom, etc. *unpleasant run-ins with any of the multitude of incompetent/pmsing/loud/obnoxious faculty members *fits of worry and anxiety leaving my stomach all tied up in knots and my heart racing *unfortunate and uncontrolable afternoon frizz  Actually, had quite a lovely day filled with the following: *Cherry Brandy Cover Girl nailslicks, now adorning both my toe AND finger nails and new Jane magazine *Car ride with John and pleasant mix cd *Art project on living room floor for now less than two hours of my evening *Comfortably unmade bed for afternoon napping  Tomorrow, anticipate having hellish day as evil cosmic payback for today complete with: *Actual anxiety attack over something to be revealed later as entirely trivial *Morning coffee that is either too bitter or has too much creamer in it *Highly unpredictable, anti-pavlovian bell schedule *Absence of "boyfriend" comfort in evening due to damn trip to Columbus

      Ive decided to post my proposed Christmas gifts for everyone online, and leave things open to comment.  Dont like what Im getting  you? Say so.  Have a better suggestion? Something you cant live without? Now is the time to say that.  Again, all mentions of gifts are entirely hypothetical.  Lack of funds, horrible fights/breakups, and other unforeseen events might take you out of the present realm all together.  Its entirely up to you to maintain your status as one of the cool people.  Ashley: Homemade The Shitty Jennifers T-shirt, and assorted other cool stuff that I wanted to buy for myself but couldnt justify spending money on  Todd: Homemade 'The Shitty Jennifers' T-shirt, and something daddy-ish  Lucas: Every cute little baby thing in the world, including but not limited to, a trunk load full of books, adorable clothes, teeny tiny shoes, and lots of very soft things  Cassie: Something insanely girly and un-mommyish to renew her knowledge that shes still a young, sexy girl  My mom: Something insanely girly and un-mommyish to renew her knowledge that shes still a young, sexy girl  My dad: A million dollars  The Boyfriend: Some damn clothes, Happy for Men, and the DVDs he keeps meaning to buy but never gets around to buying  John: ??  Erin: ??  Lizzie: This one I really cant say, but I have a wonderful idea, and she needs something to make her feel wonderful, so Im going to do the absolute best I can. (Meanwhile, Lizzie is thinking Damnit Heather! I didn't just read this whole entry to not find out what my present is!?!)  Faith: Some Art-ala-Heather, as she is one of the remaining important people not to receive any.   Random Girl Gift: Something jewelry-ish, same as last year, but current with the season's trends of course  Random Boy Gift: Nada.  Giving random boy gifts when one has a "boyfriend" is forbidden in all 50 states, or so I've been told.

      I would be posting about my novel-to-be, but such news seems to be going over like a lead balloon.  I know my friends tend to have a "We'll believe it when we see it" attitude about all-things-heather, but seriously people, this is cool shit.  But on to the more eventful news of the day *drumroll please* presented to you in the ever popular bulleted list style.  1. A certain person needs to get the hell out of my house because if she doesn't, I'm seriously going to do harm to myself or others.  Seriously.    2. My boyfriend did two terribly cute things today. (insert gagging noise here.) 2A: Boyfriend was attending local "discount tobacco establishment" while on cell phone with  yours truly and explicitly requested that his free lighter (with purchase of carton, of course) be orange "because I've got this girl that just has to have orange lighters." (swoon) 2B: When discussing the fact that we haven't actually seen each other since the god-o'clock on Monday morning, he went into some sort of soapbox lecture on how he didn't absolutely have to see me every day and how hearing my voice was enough and made mention of the fact that "In a couple of weeks (I'll) be writing my novel and (I) won't have much time for him at all" as if it were the most sensible, done-deal thing he'd ever heard of in his life.  3. Lizzie and I have had ridiculous girly online, oh-my-god-those-shoes-are-SO-cute chats for the past two nights in a row and it's done something lovely for my attitude and general outlook on the world.  4. The Shitty Jennifers RULE.

      First thing this morning: Student: "Hey, Ms. J, you know that book thing?" Me: "That book I let Colleen borrow?" S: No, the writing thing. M: The novel thing?  Where you write your own? and you devote your entire life to it? S: Yea, I want to do that. M: Seriously? S: Yeah, maybe we should start a club for it or something. M: Um, yeah, what? You want to write a novel? and we need a club? yes, god yes, we need a club.  What a fantastic idea?  You're going to write a novel with me? This is the best idea EVER!  So far there are 14 willing to take the challenge.  We'll see how many stick it out until tomorrow.

      Instead of "planning" during my "planning period," I was surfing the net like I always do, hunting down cute little shops that carry lovely hand-crafted things straight from nice urban areas where people walk down sidewalks and use public transportation and do all sorts of other fascinating things that are notably absent from my oh-so-green-acres existence.    And somehow, in the fury of point and click, I stumbled upon something that is sure to be my undoing. How this something had escaped my attention for so long is beyond me, unless of course the world was mounting a concious effort to keep it from me (which is entirely possible).  That something is  urlLink nanowrimo .  In short, you write a novel (of at least 50,000 words) between November 1st and November 30th.  Yes, that's right, an entire novel in a month. Roughly 1700 words a day.  I've already signed up.  I've already decided to give a month of my life to this.  No more of this "I want to be a writer" bullshit and driveling.  I'm gonna do it and you can't stop me. (insert cackle here)    Feel free to leave comments suggesting witty plot outlines, or even a freakin title.  I'm sort of starting from zero here.  All assistance will be appreciated and rewarded.

      Picture it... Saturday night, margaritas (literally) by the gallon, and a wee little Heather determined to forget the fact that she had a terrible time the night before and prove to everyone that "Heather can party."  Approximately 5 margaritas later, I endured the following conversation/ series of events: me: "I think I'm gonna puke." him: "Really, well, don't puke here.  We'll go to the porto-potty."    (Yes, that says porto-potty.  Try and save yourself the visual.)  m: ok.  let's go.  (proceed to over-used porto-potty, go in, slam and lock door on concerned boyfriend)  h: you okay in there?  I was gonna come in and help you. m: (screaming) I can freakin PUKE by my SELF!  (puking and more puking into porto-potty) (proceed to five minutes later)  h: I think it's time to take you home. m: garble, garble, um, garble, yeah h: Let's get you to the truck.  (in truck)  m: (crying) You're so wonderful. You're taking such good care of me.  I've never had anyone to take care of me while I'm drunk. ( Insert Lizzie apology here.  In my drunken stupor I conveniently forgot the thonged-ass-falling-off-bed incident.  Maybe I meant i'd never had a BOY to take care of a drunken Heather.) (proceed to five minutes later, at home) (Heather wanders in, takes off all her clothes.  Crawls into bed and sleeps it off only to wake up at five, take ibuprophen to fend off oncoming hangover and then puke AGAIN as ibuprophen decides it doesn't agree with poor little Heather's tummy.)

      I'm brainless and I took Anya's color quiz thingie and the results have me a bit freaked out.  Stunning accuracy, if I do say so myself...   Your Existing Situation   Attracted by anything new, modern, or intriguing. Liable to the bored by the humdrum, the ordinary, or the traditional.    Your Stress Sources   Wishes to be independent, unhampered, and free from any limitation or restriction, other than those which she imposes of herself or by her own choice and decision.    Your Restrained Characteristics   The situation is preventing her from establishing herself, but she feels she must make the best of things as they are. Feels trapped in a distressing or uncomfortable situation and seeking some way of gaining relief. Able to achieve satisfaction from sexual activity.   Egocentric and therefore quick to take offense. Sensitive and sentimental, but conceals this from all except those very close to him.    Your Desired Objective   Feels exhausted by conflict and quarreling and desires protection from them. Needs peaceful conditions and a tranquil environment in which to relax and recover.    Your Actual Problem   Fears that her independence will be threatened or severely restricted unless she protects herself from outside influence. Does not want to be bothered.

      Things I accomplished this weekend: 1. Skipped class without actually contacting the professor (although I did make several vigilant-seeming attempts.) 2. Met a new little Johnston. 3. Put 1000 miles on my car. 4. Learned new rap songs ala Ashley. 5. More than likely ran my cell phone bill up to some ungodly sum closely resembling a kazillion dollars. 6. Did absolutely nothing for school. 7. Learned how to hold a baby, hum, and walk at the same time. 8. Saw my daddy cry in the sweetest, most humble way imaginable. 9. Slept in a super comfy bed at the Sheraton last night. 10. Found out so much about myself that I'm wondering how I'm going to be reabsorbed into my world tomorrow.  Now, any questions?

      The thanksgiving week has now officially drawn to a close, as I prepare to go to bed (DAMN, it's already after ten), set my alarm for 5:45 and await the terror of the first day back at school after an extended break.  A very brief summary of what I did over the holiday: * Left my COMPUTER in freaking CHATTANOOGA * Sort of helped my dad move to his new apartment * Ate wings and drank beer with my brother * Kept score of put downs and witty cutting sarcastic remarks during family thanksgiving soiree * Purchased "Leah shoes." And if you don't know what in the hell I'm talking about then you aren't watching enough MTV. * Watched Dr. Phil. Twice. * Nearly shot myself for watching Dr. Phil. Twice. * Carried on a number of entirely fulfilling conversations with a member of the human race not yet capable of speech. * Discovered that it is in fact possible to listen to only NPR during a 7+ hour car trip, if one times the trip very precisely.  More to come later, but don't expect entirely frequent updates this week due to the fact that I (again, just in case you weren't paying attention the first time) left my COMPUTER more than 450 miles away from where I currently reside.

      Aquarius Horoscope: 11/18/2003  A much-needed sense of detachment from a certain relationship that has proved fairly troublesome lately is set to wash over you today. You have needed some space to get a few priorities of your own sorted out and clarified. Now take this sense of clarity and use it to make a final decision that will ultimately bring about the best for both of you.

      Greenville, MS; November 11, 2003  Ms. Heather Carol Johnston passed away last night while she was wide awake and typing on her upcoming novel.  The last word appearing on her computer screen was "bitc." One can only think that what would follow would have been truly inspired lyrical prose.  She is survived by one sassy, super cool sister (dorm room, Memphis, TN) and one ridiculously funny brother (apartment, Hixson, TN). She is also survived by her parents, both residing in the greater Hixson/Soddy-Daisy area.  When asked how she felt about her daughter's sudden death, Ms. Johnston's mother responded, "She kept saying that novel was going to kill her. I just assumed she was being sarcastic." (Soon thereafter, uncontrolable sobbing ensued.)  At this time, cause of death is yet to be determined. Preliminary lab results suggest a caffeine and nicotine overdose.

      5, 132 words. That is my reason for not blogging.  I've written five THOUSAND one HUNDRED thirty-two words since sunday.  my fingers are tired and i'm sleep deprived by i'm happy, and not because of anything that's going on outside of the flicker of my laptop screen.  But sometimes, that's enough, ya know?  If you didn't follow the link the last time I posted, go check out  urlLink Regina Spektor .  She's getting me through this whole writing thing.  I'll start posting little teasers of the novel if anyone's interested. (So post comments.) And if no one particularly cares, then I'll spare you the whole ordeal.  Where do all those "you should totally write a novel" people go when you actually start to write said novel?

      I have a terrible cold tonight. It's so bad that I've actually resorted to wiping snot on my sleeve like some unattended day-care discarded three year old. But ya know what? None of that really matters any more because, in spite of my valliant yet unintentional efforts to lose touch with every person I have ever known, you have found me. (Lucky for you you know someone with the internet coniving rivaled by only Bill Gates himself.)  Did you ever think maybe we'd end up on Maury Povich someday and get reunited? I totally had the whole thing planned out in my head:  "You see Maury, you're very handsome. No, that's not why I'm here, but it doesn't make you any less handsome. But back to the point. I had this friend in high school who helped me be some truer version of myself. She totally affected me in every way that it's possible to affect a person and then I was an idiot and I went off to college and did a very shoddy job of keeping in touch. And then I went to grad school and lost touch all together."  Hot-ass Maury: "Well, what was it that made her so special?"  "Well, Maury. Can I call you 'mo-po'? You see, mo-po, women tend to be very stupid. We fill our lives up with all these men who can barely carry on a conversation much less give us all the attention and emotional support that we need. And some of us are very lucky that along the way we find a female friend who really can give us all that touchy-feely shit that you penis-weilding idiots deny us. But then, for some reason, we always drift away from those women."  Hot-ass Maury: "And why do you think that is?"  "Because we're stupid. Because we forget what's good for us. Because we're 'feminists' or 'empowered' and we come up with all these meaningless reasons for justifying leaving people behind. And it's bullshit. All of it."  Hot-ass Maury: "And what do you want to say to her today in case she's watching?"  "I want to tell her that she's awesome. And beautiful. And that I miss her.

      My full evening of porch sitting and cigarette smoking was interrupted last night by both a friend invasion and a mini-marathon of everyone's favorite television idiocy parade, Rich Girls.  T. came over with her lovely visiting friend S. who is so entirely insane that she drove cross-country in a Geo Prism. (Don't they only have a three-cylinder engine?) We commenced our television viewing nearly immediately. S (with remote): What should we watch? Me: Isn't Rich Girls on? S (attempting californiai'mabovethatcool): I've never seen that. Me (like an idiot): Oh my GOD, it's the BEST. We MUST watch it.   *commence Rich Girls viewing* ...fifteen minutes later  S: So they're rich and MTV follows them around? Me: Duh. S: And this is a show? Me: Of course it is.  *now one and a half episodes in*  S: When is Ally going to talk about her aura again? T: I think Kai is doing something with her aura. S: And why is Jaime's mouth in permanent blow-job scowl? ... much more witty comment on Kai, his collection of embroidered shirts, Jaime's blow-job mouth, that lame-ass cashmere shawl, the 6 HOURS they spent in that poor store, a detailed evaluation of who in the hell "Liz" is and why we should care, brief discussion of Tommy Hilfiger's sexuality, etc.  *J. emerges from extended phone conversation with father figure*  Me: What time is it? J: 10:48. Me: Holy shit, I've been on the couch watching Rich Girls for nearly two hours. ... upstairs to attempt to sleep but sleep can never come when one is thinking of the pink suede knee high marc jacobs boots that one will never own...

      There's this woman I know, and she's totally amazing.   The first time I met her, I hated her. (Always the mark of impending true friendship.)  She was beautiful and smart. She had a boyfriend. She had it together. She was a cooler version of me, if only I knew how to apply makeup or be skinny.  And that first summer we were together, she helped me learn things about myself that I could have never discovered on my own. It is solely because of here that I know I can: a. Drink myself silly and not feel guilty about it. b. Dress to "go out". c. Have the insight to occasionally match my shoes with my outfit. d. Not be afraid of things just because I've never done them before.  And in a little more than a year and a half, she's helped me through more than she realizes. Without her, I would have never come to terms with my brother and his new baby, a million and one boy disasters, and several bouts of homesickness.  She was with me when I puked on my own bed. She was with me when I somewhat mistakenly semi-hooked up with someone I barely knew (twice). She was with me when I knew for certain that I'd fallen in love with no other than her own boyfriend. And when I say "with me," I don't mean present. She was with me, by my side, helping me deal with the shit I constantly create in my life, and all the while convincing me that the shit of my life is actually interesting, entertaining, and worthwhile.  We even have our own sorority, the details of which I could never reveal here under penalty of death, but that in itself reminds me of how much of a sister she is to me. Well, that, and the constant fighting and the ridiculous moments that only sisters can truly share and appreciate, like the first cigarette of the morning on the porch or checking an ingrown hair to make sure it isn't herpes.  And, you see, she has to go to the hospital for a while. And I can't be there because I have work and the holidays and a million other excuses that don't add up to much more than the fact that I can't seem to find a way to be the one place I know I should be in the next couple of weeks.  The best I could do was a lame blog tribute, to tell her that I'm thinking of her, and that EVERY morning for the next month, I plan to wake up and do "the cheer" in her honor.

      In response to  urlLink Lizzie :  At our faculty meeting yesterday, which I did not attend, (I was on a library adventure with freshmen doing Bio research projects) our principal told the entire staff that if we catch him not smiling at any point in the day, he is to give us a dollar.  Based on my preliminary calculations, I plan to be a trillionaire by the time 7th period rolls around.  Unless, of course, such rules don't apply to me because I wasn't actually  at  the meeting.  Ironically, all of this is designed to improve the ever impaired attitude of the teachers. I, for one, can already tell you that I'm feeling much more positive now that I work in a school where the principal is going to be forced to pay out for small misdeeds like frowning. I can't wait to see how much cash gets thrown down for major boo-boos. Can anyone say "misplaced requisition" or perhaps "inconsistent discipline"?

      By this age, everyone else has all these little friends who are hopping down the aisle with sickly pink flower girls and four carat rocks with which to fend off muggers and smooth talkers.  As for me, not only and I not one of  those  girls, I haven't even managed to keep and/or procure any of them as friends. So when I was thinking of having some "how do you know when you 'know'?" post, I realized that no one who reads this would be able to comment with any insight.  Thanks anyway, guys.

      Ok, so maybe I should be happy that Oklahoma got their asses handed to them. And maybe I should be perfectly delighted that LSU gets to play for the National Championship. And that Ole Miss got a bowl. And that there will be plenty of little happy football dances to do over the Christmas holidays.  But none of that makes up for being  urlLink anally raped  by the bowl system.  I swear, by all that is holy, I will never eat a peach again.

      I don't mean to write this post from some tower-o-knowledge. I'm writing it because I've been there, and on my drive home I was thinking, "Hey, that's some serious shit." And we all know how often those truly profound thoughts cross my mind, so I thought I might as well strike while the iron is hot. And on to the point...  I was thinking this afternoon, after the world's least productive faculty meeting, about where I was at this moment exactly five years ago, just before I took my first-ever for-real college finals.  I was nervous, and rightfully so, after spending a semester wasting god knows how much time on things that I can't even seem to recall even the vaguest details about. All I truly remember is the fact that 3:30 a.m. was my ritual bedtime, and I continually felt as if I were missing out on something if I ever turned in any earlier.  And so after a semester of dorm life, I came home to a holiday break that I don't particularly remember, aside from a fateful fifteen minute stint spent at my dad's laptop while we, collectively, checked my grades. I knew the damage was bad. I knew I could count the time I'd attended my 8:05 French class without taking off my shoes.  I was as terrified as a former straight A girl could possibly be. And of course, they were bad. Not terrible, "you're probably going to lose your scholarship" bad, but worse than any other collection of grades I'd ever gotten in my life.  But I didn't die, even though I was thoroughly convinced that I would. And I went on to vastly improve my shaky beginnings.  So for all the new little co-eds out there, most importantly Ashley and all her buds getting their first fresh start at college, remember, when you have your very own heart stopping moment sometime during Christmas break, that this is only the beginning. There will be many more late nights and papers that you fall asleep in the middle of and books that you had two months to read yet never seem to get past the first chapter of and pizza and beer and casual sex. This is the first semester of many. Enjoy it while it's still yours.

      Explain this to me. After a while, nearly 24 years to be exact, I'm still maintaining some thought that it's okay to get insanely excited about things that never ever seem to come true.  I've thought of praying to something to "fix" this near fatal character flaw, but then, once that prayer doesn't come true, like everything else, where would I be?

      If you're bored tonight, I could use some help with some things.  It seems that I've misplaced my mind and/or the life I thought that I'd been living for the last four-ish months.  Old habits die hard, I suppose. Or don't die at all, and resurface at inopportune times leading one to do things like chat online to exes instead of oh, um, maybe TEACHING.  Not that I did that today. Ah, picnic tables, conference tables.  And all you losers out there who acted all "concerned" after the cryptic horoscope, you didn't call. You know you didn't. And sure, it was fairly obvious what I was planning, but seriously, some follow up would be nice.   And no, what I had planned didn't take place. Things got sketchy and have continued to get sketchier as the days have passed and a two week missing person incident has yielded some very grandmotherly emails from someone who previously had nothing even remotely grandmotherly to say.  I used the word passion in an email without even thinking twice about it. No reply. Go figure.  So where does this leave us? 4 people can make some sense out of the above two paragraphs. (Lizzie, John, my fav spiderman, and Ashley), either of my parents know enough to sort out references to stuff they know about and then ask me prying questions about the rest, and the rest of you are pleasantly out of the loop, not least of which could easily be my "boyfriend" who claims to not read this.  I think I'll go listen to Portishead and pretend that I live in a dark French movie where people read thick books and drink coffee in a fog of depression that they all seem to be enjoying.

      Please consult the very alarming and sad table below. After consulting, get in touch with your richy-rich travel agent and plan some lavish cross-country road trip so that I won't have to look like such a sad bastard in front of my well-traveled friends.  Recommend vehicle for said road-trip: 2004 Volvo Cross Country in "drug dealer black," if you please.  You can also feel at liberty to buy me a bounty of cheesy souveniers on the way. Recommended buys: "The World's Largest _______" t-shirts and shot glasses, diamond jewelry, and my very own Volvo, only mine should be green and a wagon.  Sure, rich imaginary boyfriend, I'd probably cheat on you eventually, and then I'd probably dump you, but just think of it this way: That contest to see who's "done it" in the most states is still on, and Volvos are big beautiful cars.

      I got to school this morning, thinking it would be another monotonous day, only nicer with all sorts of lovely little birthday pleasantries.  I walked into the office and was greeted by the librarian who said the following: "Did you know D.C. passed last night?" me: "Excuse me?" "Yes. After the basketball game." me: "What? He's gone?" "Yes."  I'm not old enough (or married enough) to know what it might be like to lose a child. I'm also fortunate enough to have my parents and 2 out of 4 grandparents. Death isn't something I've had to deal with in the spectrum of my life experiences. So when I was informed this morning that one of my students had passed away (of an asthma attack, believe it or not), I didn't quite know how to handle myself. I've never been good with openly sharing grief. People always have to draw that sort of thing out of me. And when I saw my students coming unravelled around me, being led wailing into the counselor's office, I realized that I'd probably never have it in me to be one of those openly (and beautifully) weepy people who can leave their grief on display for others to learn from.    So for seven periods today I crumbled slowly from within, being constantly reminded of both the fact that it is my birthday and the fact that one of the brightest, kindest students I've ever taught was suddenly taken after he unexpectedly (and certainly happily) got to play for the last five minutes in the varsity basketball game.  I've thought a lot today about what it means to die young, and to lose someone that you care about, and what my own life really means in light of the tremendous sadness of today. I wish I could say that I've come up with something profound. I wish I could say that everything is a bit sharper, and means a bit more. I wish I could say that all that thinking has left me with a clearer view of the beauty of life, the sanctity of birthdays, and the absolute horror of an unexpected death. I wish I could say that I drove the speed limit on the way home today, but I didn't. I drove like a maniac and sang the saddest songs I could find and cried when I could.

      As I was packing up to leave school today, A.R. dropped by to remind me that I promised her I'd find her some research on a topic for her Health class.  "Oh yeah, sorry I'd forgotten about that. I'll try to remember tonight." A: "How can we make sure you remember?" "Maybe we can write it on my hand?" A: "Great idea" (getting pen out of backpack, preparing to write on my hand) Suddenly it dawns on me that one of my students is about to write GENITAL HERPES in big block letters on my hand. "Um, maybe we should abbreviate. If you just write 'G.H.' I'm sure I'll remember what it stands for." A: "You sure?" "Yeah, I'm definitely sure."

      Last night at "the bar," J.B. made a request for the cheer. Oh, the cheer. The grand statement of all that is good and pure(?) about the Rhos.   So I took out the  urlLink moleskin , wrote it down inside the front cover, next to the address and "If found a reward of _______ will be given."   I swear I nearly cried. To be writing it without my sisters was nearly too much, then to think of how long it's been since we've been sisters together, then to have T. ask me if he could write something in my journal.

      No one has actually asked me what I wanted for my birthday. No, it's cool. Stay where you are. I'm not hurt or anything. But for those of you who meant to get around to asking me what I wanted and it somehow slipped your mind, I thought I'd offer up a few helpful suggestions.   1. Cash   When I'm wondering if I can go to Walmart and afford a box of tampons, we know that things have gotten bad. Checks will also be accepted if I can be fairly sure they won't bounce. You know who you are, you check bouncing fools.   2. Cigarettes  You pick the brand. Lights or ultra lights. Feel free to surprise me.   3. Gas for my car  Always a plus, because then I can get to work and back to make money to buy those much needed tampons.   4. Food that I wouldn't buy for myself  Can include such luxuries as ALCOHOL, the good tuna, deli lunch meat, terra chips, and all my other food fetishes that I feel evil indulging on a teacher's budget   5. AAA Batteries  See? This is inexpensive and entirely needed. You too can be part of the birthday fun!! (p.s. I've been moving the same two AAAs between the DVD remote and the bikini trimmer. It's grossing John out. Someone buy me batteries, if only for his sake.)   6. A Super Awesome Boyfriend  Yeah, it's kinda soon. But still, if you know anyone that I haven't been introduced to, we can work out a deal.   7. A day off work  This could potentially be free if you talk me into going out tonight and then convince me that I'm too good to go to work tomorrow. Not technically ON my birthday, but acceptable nonetheless.   8. Anything cute, kitschy, or antique    9. Craft supplies  Try not to be confounded by this one. Just go in Walmart, find the craft section, and put things in the cart that are colorful. It's really that simple.  Hope this helps. If you're far away and you need to mail packages, you can always email for the address.

      Good: Going to Spectators on Saturday night. Better: Getting the whole group to go out, and making sure my 'new friend' had some other people to fall back on just in case I get tragically boring. Best: Remembering that the truest of friends will tell you the absolute truth even when they know it's going to hurt like hell.  Good: Drinking a lot of Jack and Coke. Better: Not having a hangover on Sunday morning. Best: Having someone hug me goodbye while I was still asleep.  Good: Spending Monday afternoon playing outside. Better: Stealing a backpacker-crossing sign and then carrying it in my pants for approximately 1.25 hours. Best: Conversation nearly rivaling the Starbucks trip of MLK 2003.  Good: Putting gas in my car. Better: Ashley getting a car. Best: The potential for eternal Heather-Ashley Greenville-Memphis trips.  Good: Watching approximately every 3rd scene in Full Frontal. Better: Watching Casey and Theran attempt to beat rednecks at pool. Best: Listening to Seth tell everyone he remembered "back when I was younger" when "I could really drink."

      My life makes me happy. Sometimes, really happy. Saturday morning always seems to be one of those times. The routine goes as follows:  1. Wake up sans alarm. Smile. Stretch. Realize is it quickly approaching 11. Enjoy. 2. Go downstairs, water for coffee, coffee for coffee, turn on pot. 3. Do dishes, clean countertops. 4. Check to see if coffee is ready. Sometimes I talk to it. "Coffee, are you ready? I love you coffee. Want to go outside with me?" 5. Pour coffee and copious amounts of cream into cute handmade coffee cup from over-priced pottery boutique. 6. Procure reading materials for porch. This morning featured both a pilfered-from-the-school-office copy of Teen People and the 2004 Prom Designs catalog.  7. Smoke, drink coffee, watch cars/homeless dog/random sketchy people on the street, read, smoke again, more coffee, more reading. 8. Go inside (as it is now officially eleven) and watch Trading Spaces.  As I've been known to say ad nauseum, it really is the simple things that make it all worthwhile.

      Anya said it best when she reminded me that the "Heather New Year" technically doesn't begin for two more weeks.

Bad Idea Karaoke Boy (aka N.C.B.  and/or FBBJ) (April) Pro: Gave us the most memorable acronyms of 2003 Con: Generally creepy redneck, camper on truck, ghetto booty  Flighty Pot-head Boy (April, October, December, ?) Pro: Funny, witty, cynical, cool dog Con: A poorly timed fling with a local "news girl"   Grab-Ass Redneck Boy (June) Pro: Tall, cuddly, adored me Con: Republican, saw no meaning in the job that I'm doing, overly aggressive  Entirely-too-young Narcissistic Boy (July) Pro: Muscley, thought he was really smart. Con: In reality, actually very dumb. Oh, and a liar. Not good.  Porn-owning Asexual Boy (July - January) Pro: My working-definition of a "cute guy" Con: Workaholic, libido-challenged (with a porn collection?!? hello?!) bore  On the Road Again Boy (November) Pro: Extremely educated, witty, good listener, cool scar Con: Perpetually travelling and/or missing  God bless 2004 and the exploits (sexual and otherwise) that are yet to come.

       Taken from an email to a dear friend from this morning when I'm fairly sure I was being paid to "educate the youth of america" or "make sure no one is left behind" or some shit like that, all written in response to a request for ultimate favorite pick-up lines:    Alas, I made an ill-advised wardrobe choice or two this morning. I think my skirt is a bit too short and my heels are a bit too high, mainly because they are heels. With the ankle injury my feet should be planted firmly on the ground. I'm sure by the time the day is over, I'll look like some 15 year old trapped at the prom, wearing shoes she let her bestfriend pick out for her, that are now being used as some sort of trendy accessory, dangling gracefully from one pinky finger by their skinny, impractical straps.   Heather approved pick-up line: "You look like you have a literary mind. Wanna fool around in the back of my Saturn?"

      I slept like this: sleep, half sleep, turn over, look at clock. terrifying dream, half sleep, turn over, look at clock. Tell me this,  how can it be 2:36 twice  in one night? But it was. And odds are, the way today has gone 2:36 might come three times if I ever manage to sleep at all tonight.  I worked like this: Half smile, "good morning to you, too," Yes, Ms. J had a bad weekend. Yes,  your silence would be greatly appreciated. Half smile, three quarters frown,  message to Lizzie to remember that one, I am alive. two, there are people that do in fact love me. Half smile, biting sarcasm, home.  I remember this: I have been here before. It has  been much worse than this before. This is not the end of the world.  This is a million cliches all rolled into one big slimey glob of cliche. I am not the jilted girlfriend. I am  "the bitch." I'm not doing much  to live up to either.  I want this: To remember that my bed is mine and mine alone. A nap with many happy floaty dreams. An  expression for the day other than  a pronounced exasperated sigh and  enough time to remember what in the hell I'm exactly  all about.

      I.,  I'm sorry. Really I am. I was trying to be all big and bad on the phone and I forgot to let on that all of it was tearing me up. And the whole time I was talking I wanted you to shut me up and tell me to cut the crap and ask what was really going on with me. But you didn't, because that just isn't how you are.  What's done is done, I suppose.  Some of us just never seem to know any better.  love, h.    Mama, Thank you for letting me sob into the phone like I sobbed when I was 14 and convinced no one in the world would ever love me. I realize that tonight's conversation was much like those same ones we had nearly ten years ago. Thanks for not thinking there was anything strange about that, and continuing to love me in the fierce way that only you are capable of.  always, heather    Dear L'oreal Voluminous Mascara, I'm well aware that you lengthen and fortify my lashes, but god DAMN could you please not hurt so much when I have an emotionally dramatic night and need to take extended periods of time by myself on the porch for extended smoking/crying fits?

I will call you if I have any business (shady or otherwise) to handle with you.  I'm in no condition to be fielding inquiries from horny little boys now fully informed of the fact that I bit the bullet and dumped the boyfriend.  And yes, I mean it.  Sincerely, Ms. Johnston    Dear week of January 12th: Please try to be nice to me. Your first day has sucked so thoroughly that I seriously have my doubts as for the rest of you. Try to come through for me, ok?  Thanks, heather

      I'm sorry to god and everyone who finds Sunday to be a worthwhile expenditure of 24 painfully SLOW hours, but Jesus f-ing Christ it's killing me. We aren't talking crucifixion bad (just to make another highly inappropriate religious reference), but as it stands right now I think I'm going to spend the rest of my evening eating microwaved soup and watching The Hours just to remind myself exactly how shitty I feel right now.  And yes, there is an explanation for all this. We'll get to that later...

      Dear Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday Weekend,  First off, I miss you. I miss you the way I would miss you if you were my boyfriend and you broke up with me while I was totally still in love with you and then proceeded to spend the next two weeks on my couch crying and eating Reese's Cups and drinking Cherry Coke. These are serious feelings of longing we're dealing with here. So, I was thinking I should get in touch with you and maybe we could cut a deal.  (I'll try to make said deal as simple as possible, as I'm sure you have other MLK and/or civil rights related stuff you should be doing.)  The "deal" *wink wink* 1. Please make the time between now and your beloved day pass as quickly as possible.  2. Any events that closely resemble last year's MLK weekend can be re-used this year with little to no complaining from me. Such events can include but are not limited to the following: *The entire city of Memphis *Nap time and/or SNL reruns *Strangers who turn out to be really hot and then let me sleep in their houses and/or in their beds. (Futons will suffice in a pinch.) *Starbucks (snow optional) *Really kick ass conversations   3. MLK weekend must be so astoundingly awesome that it inspires me to make it all the way to Spring Break (while taking a minimal number of "mental health days").  Thanks for all you've done for us, MLK Holiday Weekend! I hope to hear from you soon. Until then, have a lovely January, and remember your promise to respond to requests on a first come first serve basis because I'm getting this baby in early for a reason.  In love and solidarity, Heather  P.S. Don't forget I'm giving you ample time to make this happen. I expect the best, and if not the best, then at least something I can look back on and say, "Man, I was drunk and that was FUN."

      1. Grocery shopping and a sprained (hopefully just sprained) ankle are the worst combination of circumstances on god's green earth. By the time I got to aisle 3 I was asking complete strangers to amputate.  2. To the little blonde girl (aged 4 with the psycho-bitch attitude), I heard you say "Mommy, that weird girl is blocking our cart. Get her to move," and for the record, I wasn't blocking your fucking cart, now go chew on the end of your ponytail and hold your breath until middle school when you'll be hideous in addition to being dumb with a terrible attitude.  3. Thanks to John for putting away the groceries, not calling me a complete idiot for shopping in the first place, and mentioning (in his infinite attentiveness) that he was sorry I couldn't put them away myself because it is my MOST favorite thing to do. (no seriously, it is.)  4. Thanks again to John for his new French and/or Polish holiday romance, and said romance's invitation of "sex phone," with John of course... but if he knew me it might be a different story.  5. Geaux Tigers, which is where I'm headed now. Back to the living room floor to read Glamour and watch football, because I'm just  that kind of girl .

      First off, welcome back all. For those of you who think I have a LOT of explaining to do, you are correct. One hundred percent. And I'll get to all of that later. But in the meantime, an explanation of my exceedingly pathetic idiocy.  You see, all in all, I'm a kid. A little, scared kid. So when I'm in this huge freaking house all by myself late at night, I tend to do silly little kid things. (And no, at present, there are no monsters under the bed. I had it thoroughly inspected by the Greenville Monster Squad.)  However, late last night, waaaaaaay past my bedtime, I was certain of two things. One, I had not locked the front door. And two, because of blunder one, there was now someone in my house waiting to kill me and/or steal my stereo and brand new DVD player.  So, since neither of my male noise-checkers were around to make sure I was properly tucked (read: not delusional and paranoid), I elected to do the noise checking myself. Historically bad idea.  In my creeping-Mission-Impossible noise checking, I deemed it best to leave the stairway light turned off. Due to this oh so witty decision, I missed at least the last three steps on the stair case.  My ankle shifted into some terribly awkward and very LOUD position, taking the full brunt not-so-slim 5'6" frame as it found its way to the bottom of the stairs. My thoughts as I lay sprawled on the floor, head resting on step #2 went a little something like this (in no particular order): "Holy SHIT that hurt." "I wonder if the door is locked." "Is my foot even still attached?" "Do you KNOW how much my deductible is?" "Holy SHIT!!! that hurt."  I then belly crawled to the door only to find that it was indeed locked. Damnit. Worked my way into a seated position. Then into some not so graceful flamingo configuration and proceeded to hop my way back upstairs. Not fun at all.   Once upstairs, I elevated and assessed. My ankles are notoriously "loose". I can roll them, touch them to the ground on either side, no biggie. Too many years of soccer have made them nearly grotesque in their flexibility. But still, I needed a consult. Something just didn't feel right. Things were getting all tingly and numb.    I called Tina (with it now nearly 2 in the morning). Brief conversation about how in the hell I got myself into this fix. And then, in her infinite awesome friendness, she came back over, tended to me like a war nurse, iced, wrapped, and elevated the ankle, pumped me full of Aleve, and went on her way. Thank God I have friends like that.  Now, almost twelve hours since "the incident," it still feels strange. If I do put weight on it, it makes alarming noises. And in my experiences, I recall ankles being relatively silent in their normal function. I've yet to trek to the ER or to a clinic. I'm holding out for either excruciating pain, alarming swelling, or better insurance, whichever comes first.

      When Super Awesome Roommate decides that the procurement of HBO has become an IMMEDIATE and MANDATORY issue, and skips off to the cable people to pick up a !Brand New Digital Cable Box!, do not return from (a perfectly acceptable and not at all ass-kicking) your day at work and watch In the Bedroom while pseudo-napping on the couch.  Doing this will mess your shit up.  And yes, you are welcome.

I do this at six thirty-five You would never know  Slip on my coat, fish out keys Keys in my mouth, walking to The car where I sit and smoke In the school parking lot, on the phone With my mom who is talking About restaurants and love in the  Noise of clanking forks and mumbling  I do this at eleven twenty You would never know  Shirt up over my head By the time I hit the third stair Earrings trapped in sweater knit Counting, twelve thirteen, right turn Into the bedroom to find Last night's t-shirt, fluff hair, sigh Contemplate Oprah, napping, you  I do this at four o?clock You would never know  Sit on the porch, head back Eyes closed, cigarette lit with Confiscated lighter, the wind is  Blowing one curl on to my eyelid, There are dogs and cars and men With Miller in brown paper sacks Rain plopping from Magnolia leaves  I do this at nine, ten, eleven, etc. You would never know.

      The Lenten season appears to be upon us. (This having been brought to my attention by two gentlemen, one of whom felt compelled to call me on the way home from Mardi Gras (I'm sure it wasn't some weird titty-related synapse connection) and the other who gets the "funniest joke of last night" award for pledging to give up celibacy for Lent.)  So I've been thinking, maybe it's time for me to get in the spirit of things. Maybe I should jump on that tiny band-wagon-o-religion and give something up. And then I remembered the old adage that "Heather" is one letter away from "heathen," which I followed with an extended period of convoluted logic, giving credible reasons for me to not actually give up  anything .  Anyway, here's my little post-it to Jesus. If that isn't who I'm supposed to be addressing this correspondence to, somebody get back to me on this. I'd hate for this to get lost in the mail.   Dear Lord and Savior (aka that "dude" in that new Mel Gibson movie),  I know I should give up something for Lent. All the cool kids are doing it. And when I was 13 and prayed really really hard to get to be one of the cool kids and then the next weekend a popular girl started calling me and then we got to hang out and it was  awesome , I became a believer in the power of prayer, so, like, I owe you one or something.  But you see, Jesus, I'm having a hard time coming up with something to give up for Lent.  Thus far I've considered the following: - Smoking (a possibility, but the portfolio is due on Saturday, and I have to smoke a lot before then to keep me motivated and I'll have to smoke afterwards to celebrate, so this one just sucks) - Sex (um, just no) - How about casual sex? (again, I don't think I'm really feeling you on this whole "no sex" thing) - Drinking (please refer to above mentions of portfolios, celebrations, etc.) - Caffiene (I skipped my coffee on Sunday and I thought I might die.) - So what about just coffee? (But it's so goooood) - Not doing laundry (This could work to a certain degree. Maybe if I decided to have all my laundry done by the end of Lent...)  So Jesus, really, I've got nothing. And you've still got the whole "son of God" and "died for our sins" thing working for you, so surely you can come up with something. I'm still open to suggestions, as long as none of them reference the aformentioned I-totally-can't-live-without-them items.  Thanks and stuff, LaMagnolia

People will have your head for this. On a stake.   And in the meantime, I'm going to take a nap and try to forget that you (and my headache) exist.  Dissappointed, Pissed Off, and Suffering from the J.D. flu, LaMagnolia  p.s. You suck.

      My idea of a perfectly acceptable Friday night now apparently includes the following: 1. Wrestling in the kitchen and leaving (as yet unnoticed) black scuff marks on the recently mopped floor. 2. Drinking black cherry KoolAid with vodka from a plastic bottle. 3. Sending a friend on a scouting mission to the Ramada to see if it's an acceptable "get drunk and make fun of people" location. 4. Watching The Secret of NIMH and evaluating the whole of 80's animated features. 5. Having parts of The Secret of NIMH explained to me because black cherry KoolAid and vodka has a negative effect on my attention span. (as if it could get any shorter)  I am so not punk rock.

      When I left school today, I was blessed with the following synchronicity: 1. It was 70 degrees outide. In February. 2. The sky was 70% blue, 30% crimpy looking clouds. Magnificent. 3. It was Friday. 4. When I'd turned the car off this morning, I was 30 seconds away from a rocking bass line in a Beta Band song, so when I was leaving the parking lot, it got to the best part just when I couldn't see the school in the rearview anymore. 5. I still had some Orange Soda left from an unexpected 6th period student who thought I needed something to drink.  So, happy Friday to you, too.

      1. I added new links, for all you losers who really come to my page just because of my stellar taste in blogs.  2. After all my "We should SOOO make a tshirt of that" bullshit, I've now spent countless hours making all sorts of stencils and making the f*@$ out of some tshirts. The standout favorite thus far has been the stellar "The Shitty Jennifers" tshirt, the stencil for which is being held on reserve until I remember that I can go ahead and make the other 2 shirts I've promised and send them through the ever reliable USPS. However, "The Shitty Jennifers" might lose their top spot after the coming weekend's "Drink More, Care Less" shirts are unveiled.

      In short, there isn't one. At least not one worth telling. I know the posts have been infrequent and cryptic and a tad depressing and not the usual bubbly Heather-fare that we've all come to appreciate.  There is a bottom line in this (and a whole hell of a lot of stuff leading up to it) but the bottom line hasn't really been reached yet. There's still shit to sort through and conversations to have and other evenings to lose to thinking about things I should have been finished thinking about a while ago.  It's not that life isn't good. School is good, bordering on great for at least one or two periods a day. But then I come home and remember what all is going on, and then I try to nap (and even napping has become fitful and unrewarding), then I think about planning for school or finishing my portfolio, but I've done little to none of either. The hours spent away from work are getting sucked into that great void of sitting in front of the computer or the tv or on the bed, doing absolutely nothing productive, and listening to either trash pop or depressing guitar and/or piano melancholia.  Feel free to leave me comments telling me to "cheer up," or "look on the bright side!" and know that the laugh I have at your expense might do a bit to improve the quality of my day. I'll see my way through this, but there isn't a whole lot anyone can do about it in the meantime.

      Dear Love of My Life,  You can ask questions, but  I cant guarantee any uplifting, life-affirming answers. No, Im not sure why no one has snatched me up yet. Probably has something to do with being flighty and weird and intimidating. No, Im not ready to settle down. Terrifies the hell out of me, actually.  And no, I cant make any promises, accept any gifts, or put anything down in writing. Im a doubter, a Grade A certified scaredy-cat.   But yes, I will run away with you, if you can promise me a few minor allowances. I must leave junk all over the house. I will leave the Sunday coffee cup on the bookshelf until it needs to be used next Sunday. I will put the bills next to the houseplants until the next time they get watered, when the water will overflow and smudge the fact that I now owe the cellphone people $211.74. I will forget to kiss you goodbye at least every other Tuesday.  I will frequently forget to shave my legs. I will pick my nose while deep in thought. I will love you so fearlessly that it makes me cry.  Get back to me. LaMagnolia

      I will spend my day listening to ani difranco And taking deep breathes that I think make things better Trying not to realize that Im slipping When what kills are the things that I cant help remembering  And I always wanted to write you poetry That was bigger than anything that was going on That was true love and eyelid kisses That was a dozen roses and contrived near misses  Because all along I saw the you you never were In your head or mine, on journal pages and receipts I saw a dreamer and a planner, a balanced checkbook Holding my breath, waiting for you to look  And I said I couldnt love you if you never Made me cry with the thought of losing you Until I felt the weight of your absence with my head Face down in a pillow, saline dripping and dead  Now were lost in that place where people Forget which way they came in And I want to remember the look of your driveway Turn my stereo down when you grin  That disapproving way I came to know That meant you would never understand But there was something I was doing right Even knowing that none of this was ever planned.  So here I am at my most vulnerable Mascara streaked and waiting Knowing things cant get worse or better Typing and silence, cold logic and debating

      On the radio today There was a man An old songwriter At the point in his career Where operatic 20-somethings That our mothers would listen to Are making entire albums Of his times-gone-by-hits And I sat entranced Listening to his voice Of gravel and cigarettes And thinking of you  He kept talking  About places that I know youve never been  Oakland and Sacramento Hollywood and Screaming out of limos And I was thinking of you And your slow quiet voice How you could never Ride down Rodeo Drive Yelling at tiny blonde things But how if you did The story would be  Just as good as it is Coming from his mouth Using your voice Or at least your voice As it will be Forty years from now Ten thousand cigarettes Snubbed in coffee cans And on the bottoms  Of work boots All adding up to one Fantastic existence  Right onto Highway One And I realize You let me get  Too many words in And I want more talks like this Where you can go on Uninterrupted About everything in the world Music and love and  Family and skies Where Im driving With nothing to say And thinking of you

       My (aquarian) Horoscope as appearing on Yahoo (in their infinite astrological wisdom) today:   Today you could enter into a new romantic relationship, Heather, or else you could experience a new sense of unity and commitment within an existing one. Whichever it is, the relationship might become very intense, so be sure that you and your partner make the effort to give each other plenty of space. Powerful bonds can lead to great strength as a couple, but they can also burn out if the parties aren't allowed to grow and develop as individuals.   My response:   Um, what?  *more to come later

      First off, I don't seem to be writing anything that interests anyone these days. Sure, you all stop by, but no one ever has anything to say.  And to make things exponentially better, I'm in a ghastly mood tonight and I can't seem to break it. I'm reading  urlLink You Shall Know Our Velocity , stumbing through the first fifty pages that are so ridden with anxiety that my own anxious tendencies are being sent into overdrive. I've found myself on the porch twice tonight, reading and smoking in the dark, making my way through the pages, only to realize that I was somehow reading and at the same time playing out my own anxiety-ridden plot in my head.  I've always had a flair for picking the wrong book at the wrong time. Anyone have a spare copy of the Bell Jar around? I could just read that and get it over with.  And to make things even more GRAND and STUPENDOUS the "powers that be" have decided that since I spent my weekend cooped up and napping and trying to convince myself that I did not in fact have some bronchial malaise that would eventually kill me, I was entirely deserving of a day of  Sunshine! and Birds Chirping! and Daffodils!  dismal and incessant rain.  So, in summary: No one loves me. My portfolio isn't finished. I keep forgetting how to SPELL portfolio. It's still raining. I'm still coughing. And Dave Eggers is f-ing with my head.

      I'd like to say that I respect your role in the "rock world." You serve your purpose. You bring to mind thoughts of the skinny-wriggling-likes of Jagger or Tyler. And I must say, you brought home all the Jack-White-alicious goodness I was looking for when you silhouetted that lovely piece of Jack-White-ass in front of the incessant and seizure inducing strobe light.   However, you are hideous. And as soon as I have my way with Jack, and he's dead to the world in whatever sort of drug-induced-post-coital-haze I leave him in, I will promptly have you executed, most likely by means of firing squad to be followed by incineration.

      1. I've managed to apparently come down with something that can only be described as  death  "The worst chest cold in the universe."  2. As a result, I sound like Bea Arthur. Lovely. And so great considering my job requires me to TALK all day!  3. Our home alarm system became possessed at 5 a.m., dinging randomly, keeping J. from sleeping, and significantly disturbing my own final hour of much needed sleep.  4. I managed to leave my PURSE at HOME. (wtf!??!??!)  I needed to bring my laptop to school today and apparently in the confusion of the dinging and the missing hour of sleep, I failed to notice (until I was getting out of my car at school, 35 miles later) that my purse was very much still in my kitchen.  Pray for me or something.

      "I wish you were here right now," he says, leaning out the driver's side window, right hand draped across the steering wheel.  "But I am here, you drunk. I'm ten feet away from your car. You're too smashed to even know what's going on," she screams, adjusting her high, black PayLess heels, stumbling forward a little, then righting herself and flipping her short black hair.  No. You arent getting it. I wish you were here right now, he repeats, slurring slightly.  Im walking home. Go. Just go, she says, reaching down again at the shoes, this time to yank them from her feet.  But you dont get it, he says again, on a loop.  Im going. Look at me. Walking home, she says in her high-pitched Im-no-longer-interested voice, shoes drooping from her left hand, her middle finger and her now empty ring finger sunk sturdily into the empty heels.  Where am I supposed to go? he asks.  Pawn shop might be a good idea. I doubt either of us will be needing that, she says, pointing to her marquise-cut diamond solitaire, fit snugly onto his pinky, and with that, she walks home, but not after chunking half of ten bucks worth of stylish footwear through his back windshield.

      Preparation: Make sure other people are also skipping school. Form the Slacker Teachers of Greenville Club.  Step One: Sleep until noon (or until the covers become so unbelievably tangled that you think you've entombed yourself.)  Step Two: Wake up, drink coffee, smoke cigarettes, flirt with mailman.  Step Three: Watch with amazement as roommate has procured a treadmill during Skip Day. Resolve to do something similarly productive.  Step Four: Watch at least two hours of TLC.  Step Five: Get on treadmill and promptly get off when you realize 1)how ridiculous you look and 2) that you are allergic to all things aerobic.  Step Six: Go have a smoke to undo any sort of body improvement that may have taken place on the treadmill.  Step Seven: Read lovely but dark book that you've already read before (but you've become a teacher since then and have resultingly forgotten the entire plot).  Step Eight: Recall your oath of productivity. Paint "Disco Queen" picture for stupid friend who is sincerely sick and at school.  Step Nine: Have someone cook you dinner, watch American Idol, have witty conversations on the front porch.  Step Ten: Go to bed early (yeah, right), knowing that school will be waiting for you in the morning.

      I'm sure there are a lot of people whom I've pissed off in my life. I could easily name twenty off the top of my head. But you see, the situation is this, my personality won't allow me to continue to piss you off.  When it comes down to it, I'm a really nice girl. Aggressive, mean, spiteful, sure. But it all tends to pass rather quickly and then I go back to being friends. (right, Lizzie?)  So when you feel compelled to take me outside (literally),  to tell me that I'm not welcome in your house (which you happenning to be renting along with someone who is a very dear friend of mine),  after you've somehow become confused that there is lingering animosity between us (big word for you, wasn't it?),  I shouldn't have to be upset. I also shouldn't have to feel guilty for calling you a "straight-up bitch," which was admittedly weak, but the best put-down I could come up with on short notice.  I've always had a hard time realizing the fact that there are some people who are in no way worthy of my time, people who may in fact be completely devoid of any redeeming qualities. Well, tonight, I think I took a huge step into big-girl land in realizing that you (Grand Queen of the Shitty People) are in no way worthy of my time. You are completely devoid of any redeeming qualities.  It is for this reason, I feel completely justified in saying that first, I hope you get a horrible STD that renders you unable to spread your whore-love any further than you already have. And after all your naughty-bits have withered away, I hope you have a life altering moment in which you realize exactly how unreasonable and crazy you actually are.  And then after that, you're more than welcome to continue to conduct your whiny-little-rich-girl life in whatever way you see fit (of course now devoid of your dignity and your means of reproducing.)

      You know that commercial where the woman is supposed to get an oil change but instead she's running some insane soccer-mom taxi service until her trendy SUV spots some Quick Lube establishment and the engine JUMPS out of the car and hauls engine-ass into the oil change?  Well, I think one of my ovaries is trying to do that, only without the whole oil change part.

      She walked back out into the yard. She checked by the door for her grass-stained Nikes, the ones she'd had since sophomore year.  The left was there, still propped by not entirely square front door. The right was missing again, most likely having been used as a pillow the night before by the neighborhood stray as he slept beside the roaring air-conditioning unit.  The steps were smooth under her feet in spite of the fact that no one ever saw to sanding or finishing them. Years of foot traffic and rainy weekends had worn them to the oily smoothness of railings coercing children through amusement park lines.  She knew the bill needed today's postmark, with or without her right shoe.   She crossed the yard to the car without looking down. She had little concern for bees, thorns, or excrement.  She was proud of having a stamp this morning. At least there was that. One stamp left for the last bill. The final installment. An end to an era she had never wanted to begin in the first place.  With the key in the ignition, the turned her wrist. Click. No rev. No sputter. She leaned forward, head on hands on steering wheel.    I realize now that it's actually TUESDAY. This is what teaching does to you.

      There is someone I miss very much. Someone who won't even answer the phone. Someone who's voice mail I've developed an intimate connection with.  And now I call and leave messages that drop off after things that would be profound if Ione Skye were saying them in a movie. Only she isn't. And I haven't perfected the pregnant pause.    When I call and say that I want to hear your voice, and then let things drop off and a car drives by and I use the same pause I perfected at seventeen when I still thought I could simultaneously manipulate and charm people... well, it's really all for you.  I'm going to bed now, and maybe when it's very very dark and quiet outside and I've been asleep long enough to curl into my perfect side-sleeping-fetal-with-one-leg-extended the phone will ring and I'll answer and you'll be drunk and sweet and watching the History channel and you'll ask me to tell you a story.

      I've tried to think of ways to write this in a very un-15-year-old fashion, and my scientific research hasn't yielded any.  See, I'm not lonely. I've just come to the point where I've realized that it'd be extraordinarily nice to share all of this with someone. I want to be in love. And I don't care if he's a farmer or a door-to-door knife salesman or a media mogul, so long as he enchants me and I enchant him.   And as many things as I could write about what enchantment might require and entail, the word can speak for itself.  And, above all else, I want new adventures. I know, in the past, my adventures have been of the self-created "Watch Heather Go!" variety.  Not that I'm finished with starring in my sitcom where the opening credits feature shots of me cliff-diving and popping my head into trendy New York shops.   Nor do I want some weak subplot where I find a man who fulfills my every desire only to have him leave after he falls in love with his editor/band manager/publicist and moves to London where he can live happily ever after with his adVERtisments and GARages.  Nor do I want the show to entirely shift gears, where the audience will then become hopelessly cynical as they watch the bright, shining twenty-something throw away her life of promise to move to the suburbs where she can carpool to the Children's Reading Hour at the public library. I want the show to continue, as previously planned, dictated, and written in the stars, but I want there to be another show, preferably on a different night (so as not to confuse viewers or haters of metaphor) where Heather gets to be in love. Real, challenging, fearless love.  The kind of love that people wish there was a different word for because "love" sounds a bit too tired and trite.  Of course, the show would get cancelled, because as the creative director I'd be insistent on episodes consisting of nothing but couch-cuddling-conversations about college sports and teaching, not to be overshadowed by episodes shot entirely in the Walmart aisles as the happy couple shops for DVDs and mangoes.  But it'd be an instant cult classic, and once we got the axe after ten glorious episodes, our small legion of fans would be hungry for the entire season to come out on DVD.  The happy part is that  urlLink I'm not alone , at least not in some cosmically significant way. And when all the "Will I ever...?" questions pile up too high in my head, there's at least one number I can call to find some bitchy-single-girl solace.

      To catch up on interesting searches that led people to our humble abode in the last week or so:    Dear person who searched "Virginia Slims is such a girly thing to smoke,"       1. Bring it.     2. I'm a freaking enligh teacher. Watch the horrible grammar mistakes. In my usual cloud of smoke, H.    Person who searched for "CHEECH AND CHONG MEXICAN AMERICANS,"   Ashley, I don't see why you can't remember the address. You suck, Your much smarter sister    Person who was looking for "Platinum Plus Greenville Comments,"   My comments are as follows: My ex went there more than once. I've heard enough lap-dance-laden, tities-in-peoples-faces stories to last me a life time, so take your smut searching ass elsewhere. I'll be praying for you, Heather    To the alarmingly large number of people who get here for searching for Ally Hillfiger and Rich Girls,   Dudes, as far as I know the show is over. And as sad as that is, when you're reading blogs written by poor school teachers in Mississippi to feed your incessant need for all things ditzy and annoying, I think it's time to take a long hard look in the mirror. Worried, Smarter than you    Person who was searching for "redneck camper,"   Not sure what you have in mind. I have stories. Email me. h.    Dearest person who found this site searching for "free sexual outfit designs,"   One, you've been horribly misled. Two, if you ever get a lead on that, get in touch with me. If not, I'm totally thinking about starting my own business now.   Thinking jeans and birkenstocks constitute a 'sexy outfit,' Heather    To the horrifyingly large population who gets here by mixing coffee related terms with sex,   Please call me.

      First, thanks for making my car environmentally sound and all. Really, I appreciate it. I like driving along on my two-lane cotton field infested highways knowing that I'm getting fantastic gas mileage and that if I had an unfortunate incident with a gigantic truck, deer, school bus, alien, etc, that my excess of safety features would keep me in one vaguely-Heather-shaped piece.  But when it comes to my goddamned oil filter, and the fact that I have to go to Walmart for an oil change because no one else in this area will even think about touching my car, I'd like to kick you in your little smartly-advertised balls.  Because apparently even though the people at Walmart SAY they know how to change my oil with its tricky oil filter, they aren't necessarily truthful.  Lucky for you, Saturn, cute little baseball cap wearing Adrian was there this afternoon to inform me that I'd been driving for 5200 miles with my oil filter all out-of-whack, so much so that oil had gotten all up in grooves and crevices of my DAMN ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND oil-filter-holdy-thingie.  But Adrian, cute sweet wonderful Adrian, let me sit in my car and search through my old paperwork so that he could figure out the guy who did it incorrectly in the first place and promptly bitch him out while he spent no less than twenty minutes scrubbing and cleaning my filter-cap-thingie back to its shiny Saturn self.  Saturn, I'm kinda pissed off. Greenville Walmart, you can go jump off a cliff. (Lucky for you, we're in the freaking Delta and cliffs are kinda hard to come by.)  Adrian, I'd totally marry you and you could fix my car all the time, and we'll have lovely little light-skinned babies.    3000 Miles to go before more impending bullshit, The Magnolia (with much respect to Zelda)

      For the two people that visit every day, well, first of all, thanks for your loyalty. I love you, too, and all that jazz. And second, I'm sorry for all the changey stuff I've been doing. I've been spastic and antsy all week and even American Idol couldn't hold my 14-year-old-mentality interest.  (I think I'm finished with the tweaking except for maybe a bit of color adjustment.)  As far as life, it's so difficult and confusing right now that it's making writing very difficult. (And I say this knowing that if one of my students ever tried to sell such a lame excuse they'd be sent to some sort of English Class Purgatory.)  But, honestly, it's the truth. I don't have the sort of all-thats-good-and-pure writing in me that I had a few months ago, or even a few weeks ago. But maybe I'll have enough relaxation (read: porch sitting, smoking, and drinking) time this weekend to refuel and realize that my life isn't a total chaotic mess. Maybe after that I'll be back to my previous brilliance.   If not, just expect a whole hell of a lot more excuses like the ones contained above.

      A Life in Not So Carefully Made Decisions  I have been good at plotting, usually in front of your face And so much of it goes back to one bright-blonde-headed girl Who taught me at fourteen that resume building was Of primo-importance. I took her at her word. 	 And now I have the following to show for it: Many, many depressing CDs Seven pairs of Old Navy flip-flops A book collection that will not survive another move Forty-seven names in my cell phone (Thirty-eight of whom have yet to reach a two year anniversary) A four-door sedan Unpaid bills Late notices from the library and a book club A desk piled high with blank job applications, empty yogurt containers, soda cans, long wilted paperwhites Frizzy hair, cracked heels, eight hangnails, dirty clothes Dark circles, mild psychotic disorders, anxiety, hair twirling The thought that I did all of this to be different to avoid the normal, the babies, the husbands, the cell phones, the four-door sedans.  Now she is getting married. She is in law school. She has no idea I am writing this. She probably got The better deal. The boy. The student loans. The life that is easy to explain That still looks good on paper.

      1. Discover and acquire fulfilling employment (preferably that will allow me to keep my sweet-ass ride). 2. Fall in love and/or get super-awesome boyfriend who can telepathically know when I need a back rub/phone call/frappucino/make-out-session/etc. 3. Wash some freaking clothes already. 4. Learn that "cleaning my room" should not mean "moving junk from bedroom into office so that it will be less noticeable to guests". 5. Grade the pile of papers that is now approximately the same height and weight as the dude from The Littlest Groom. 6. Swear off making obscure Reality TV references. 7. Find styling products that have been AWOL since Spring Break Extravaganza so hair will not look like crazy-finger-in-light-socket-incident tomorrow. 8. Retrieve new Jack Johnson CD from car and put in alarm clock therefore rendering tomorrow's wake-up a chill, relaxing experience. Yeah, right. 9. Become as cool as little sis so that my Saturday nights will become more "punk Eurotrash party fun" and less "weird friends making out with each other awkwardness". 10. Relax a little, for the love of god, because if I don't soon I'm going to start going bald and/or gaining weight and/or losing friends in addition to my now nightly migraines and freak outs.

      In short, a lot of places and nowhere. I took off for a while, gas in the car and enough panties to see me through.  I tried to say that I wasn't in search of anything, that it was just an ordinary trip (since I'm always taking off in my car since I adore driving so much). Of course, the truth of the matter is that I was desperate for that answer, that opening of the skies where I get to figure out what it is I'm supposed to be doing with the next year of my life.  There weren't angels singing or visions in the middle of the night or anything quite as dramatic as I would have hoped for. I suppose, now that the break is over, it all boils down to a lot of thinking on the open road and two versions of the exact same conversation. There were lots of mentions of "settling," of "being comfortable," of "doing what's right for me." There were tears by the bucket full (as there always are when I realize that I'm up against something that might actually be bigger than me).   And in the end, everyone pretty much had the same answerless story to tell:  Wait it out and you will know what is right for you. You are the only one that can answer this question.   And now, even though a week's search for clarity has left me more muddled and confused than I ever thought I could be, I know a few things for sure. (If anyone else is in the same boat, maybe these might be helpful.) 1. Never doubt the wisdom of people that love you unconditionally. 2. Never think that your dream job doesn't exist. Mine came open on Friday, I found the listing today, and I hope to have my application in by Wednesday. (And yes, I realize that I just totally jinxed it.) 3. Have faith in the power of the open road (even when it's plagued with flash floods and wind advisories). The big giant answers might not be hidden on it, but at least you can put some distance between you and what has been bothering you.

      This morning I showered, made coffee, printed directions, and threw a lot of freshly dried clothes into my trust HCJ LL Bean tote then into the trunk of my car.  The Karma fairy visited this morning after my delivery of breakfast (Cinnamon rolls, doritos, and ham and cheese sandwiches, as requested) to my remediation kids, more than one of whom said I'd be blessed over the break for doing that for them.  So, with Karma, clean clothes, and a soon to be full tank of gas, I'm outta here. Don't know when I'll be back. The plans are vague at best. Wish me luck.   p.s. Please don't call me, I'll call you. I'll be in Louisiana by 5 this afternoon (hopefully) and therefore outside of my cell calling area. I'll call the appropriate people to let them know I'm happy and safe.

      We seem to have become strangers to each other in the last 48 hours or so. My normal happy-go-lucky self seems to be on vacation two days prior to my actual vacation, leaving me in a state of hyper-animation. Everything around me seems to be moving too fast, but under a microscope it becomes abundantly clear that nothing is moving at all.  (Good job with making the weather mimic this perfectly. It looks windy outside, birds taking swooping flights like they are getting sucked in one direction or another, when all the while the air is thick and sedentary.)  All of this is stemming from the following: 1) I finished a book last night with an ending so close to what is going on in my head right now that I have assumed the fiction as some sort of appendix to reality. 2) Being at school right now is harder than anything I've known in a while. The kids are having a hard time, the English 2 retest is tomorrow, and I feel entirely ineffective. 3) I made the mistake of saying that the only thing I really wanted in the world was to be in love. I said it out loud. Repeatedly. I forgot the line about being careful what you wish for.  So Sanity, or those who regularly contribute to my sanity, your attention is needed. The edge is approaching.   LaMagnolia

      If you've never lived in Mississippi, you've never experienced the distinct joy of knowing you've just seen something that could never ever occur in quite the same fashion beyond the boundaries of this state.  On Friday night, T. and I went to Wendy's somewhere in the middle of the giant Ashley-trapped-on-the-side-of-the-interstate fiasco. All the normal drive-thru things happenned. Ordering, sorting of money, waiting patiently behind cars that seemed to order the entirity of the Wendy's menu twice over. Only this time, the monotony of America's fixation on low quality food came with free (and classy) entertainment.  The car in front of us in line (some sort of mid 80's sedan) held four occupants. The front seat contained "Mullet Boy" and some vaguely unattractive female, both of undetermined ages. (At one point we thought them to be the parents of the crazies in the backseat, but we eventually decided it was some sort of older-brother or much-older-friend arrangement.)  And the backseat (oh god the backseat, with all of its backseat potential) held two of the horniest, grabbiest fifteen year olds the world has ever witnessed.  When our attention was first drawn to the backseat we had a moment of pause. "They aren't really making out, are they?" "No, they couldn't be. There are people in the front seat. No one is that gross." But as the cycle of heads coming up, and disappearing back down below our line of sight continued, we knew there was no other  explanation.   These kids were getting some major face-sucking action. Simple as that.  Eventually the two love birds realized they were being watched. (I think our incessant giving of the thumbs-up might have tipped them off.) And did they have a moment of pause? Did they ever consider perhaps this wasn't appropriate behavior for the drive-thru? Hell no. Let the face-sucking continue!  And so it went, through the ordering, through paying the girl at the window, all the way until big-brother-or-older-male-friend passed food into the back seat to offer nourishment to the surely famished couple.   But, they might not have needed the food. After all, through the entire makeout session, boy-makeout-participant kept frantically grabbing chips out of a Doritos bag featured prominently in the back windshield, one time having to paw around, his face so securly attached to makeout girl that he couldn't be bothered with actually looking for the all important Doritos bag.  The drive-thru, Doritos, making out, laughing hysterically... God, I love Mississippi.

      My drive home is the same every day. The same not-quite-level roads, past cotton and rice fields, through school zones and road construction, coming into town like every good country girl should do as often as she can. Only today, listening to my obnoxiously girly music, rethinking the soap-box lecture I gave 7th period (where I sounded more like my dad than I ever have in my entire life, and used the phrase "personal responsibility" an embarrassing number of times), it dawned on me that all of this as I know it is about to come to a close.   Next year I'll come home to a different house with different roommates. Next year C. won't race me to school and J. won't be around to bitch while I silently ponder how he must be the most wonderful teacher in the world.  Next year will be different. Not better, not worse, only different. One of those squint your eyes and tilt your head to the left sorts of changes where everything is the same but not.  And even though I know that I've made the right decision and steadfastly repeated to everyone (including myself) that my work here is not done, that my heart isn't ready to lead me out of the Delta, sometimes those moments still come when the windows are down and it all gets overwhelmingly sad.   Walking away is something I've always been good at. I've left towns, boyfriends, family. I've gone off to do my own thing in places that made my friends worry and my parents check their checking accounts and insurance policies.  This is the first time I've realized that there is just as much perspective in planting one's feet firmly on the ground and refusing to budge.  Even in all of this, when we're far apart and rarely in contact, we are all there. We've been in this together. When it was time to cry because something horrible happenned or simply because the stress and frustration had brought us to the breaking point, there were at least a few someones who knew exactly what you were feeling.  I haven't told enough people how much they've meant to me or how much I'm going to miss them. And even though this weekend and next are both to be a celebration, I know now that there will be tears. I know I won't be able to look at these faces, know what we've shared, and not burst out with silly stories followed by that creeping knowledge that none of it will ever quite be the same again.   I didn't cry at my high school graduation. I laughed knowing that I wouldn't stay in touch, that it was the first step in a line of many. I didn't cry at my college graduation, thinking of the car I was buying the next week, of the drive to Oxford, of unknown adventure. In ten days, I will cry in The Grove because I finally get it.

      1. My  urlLink dad's  comment on  urlLink my brother's blog  last Tuesday, challenging future themed daily entries. In case you didn't catch it:  First there was "200 Word Wednesday" now there's "Two Post Tuesday". What's next "Freakin' Fuckin' Friday" or "Satire Soaked Saturday"?  *We are planning a "Freakin' Fuckin' Friday" post from the glorious Holly Springs for later in the week.  2.  urlLink Your Pantone Birthday Color , only mine sort of sucks. (Be sure to click on your month color to find the color for your particular birthday.)  I ended up with something horrifically titled "Lavender Frost," which looks more like a color for the Mother of the Bride than anything I'd ever slap on a wall, but at least the description fits me perfectly: "You are extremely bright (of course) and may become bored if you are not  stimulated  or surrounded by people who can keep up with your keen intellect."  3. The long-awaited end to my insistent procrastination. I finally ordered my cap and gown, and also found it necessary to order a  urlLink kickass graduation dress . (dress also to be featured at the SHS prom and the wedding of an evil pseudo-friend from high school)

      I'm getting bored of this, so here you go:   1. What are you doing next year?  As far as I know, I'm teaching at the same school, and moving across the street and over one house. As for the smaller details, you can always email to find out where I'll be eating/drinking/sleeping on any given night, if that's the sort of information you're after.   2. Why in the hell are you staying?  Because I'm in love with my children. Crazy first-love kinda love, where you scream all the time but everything still exciting and new. I kinda like it, so there.   3. Are you single?  Define "single".   4. Can I have your autograph?  Sure.   5. Why do you never answer your phone?  Bitches, I DO answer my phone. I think you were trying to call someone else. Either that, or you were drunk. Probably drunk.  If I missed any, drop them in the comment box. I promise to leave profanity-laden responses.  In other news, we now have a flower. Feel free to leave any and all inappropriate "deflowering" jokes in the comments as well.

      I know now how it felt All those times you talked about going back And youd get that far off look in your eye (that I couldnt help but want to slap off your face) Sometimes that L word just doesnt play fair And you end up looking into eyes That shouldnt be that close to your face Then your shirts on the floor And youre not thinking, My best friend Will think Im an idiot when I tell her. Youre thinking, I had forgotten  People can look at each other like that. I shouldnt be here. I dont want to be Anywhere else in the world but here. If every moment with you could be Exactly-like-this-moment, I could stay Next to you forever, and I know I could work really hard to forget All the things that made it fall apart.  The only truly sad thing is I remember how the story ends I remember how this has to drag itself out Until everyone is so tired of it They want to scream when the phone rings. And so my strategy is this: Dont speak a word of it.  I tried to tell the beginning Of this second chapter tonight And the word magic  Obliterated everything else. So Im leaving it at that.

      Every once in a while this sadness creeps over me, and everything feels really lonely, and I'm distant (especially from the people that I love/adore/talk to on a daily basis). It dawned on me last night that it wasn't PMS or garden variety single girl loneliness, but genuine summer-camp-esque homesickness. (except for the fact that I was never actually homesick when I was at camp)  So, in short, I'm sad, and to date I've only found one person that can lessen the tension of the screws that are simultaneously holding me together and making me crazy-sad with missing my family. Thanks Ashley for answering your phone.  A short list of things that have made me want to cry and/or hit something tonight: 1. Idiot shallow boys 2. Nonidiot, nonshallow boys that call and then make me sad 3. The fact that I need new tennis shoes 4. The cereal being a little stale 5. My phone not being charged 6. Mosquitos 7. Frizzy hair 8. Not being carefree enough to go for a drive and listen to the new Ani cd I burned 9. My inability to take a full breath/ keep my eyes from watering 10. Not being tan   p.s. For everyone that has been following the budget cuts in Mississippi, as far as I know I still have a job. Pink slips were handed out on Friday and addressed in meetings today. I had neither a slip nor a meeting. However, I'll only believe it when I have a new contract in my hand.

      I was sitting on a bench, the artsy yet institutional kind commissioned for public universities and corporate outdoor smoking areas. Some conglomeration of brick and concrete, angle and curve.  It was before I knew you, before I had this life full of short jaunts and disconnects, before I knew I was a writer. Back when everything seemed too good to be true, back when moments were scary instead of the scary of years and decades of blank in front of me.  I remember watching people and thinking only of what they thought of me, of my clothes, of my unwashed hair, of my posture and my pen scribbling in my notebook.  In everything there was fear.  Fear of what I could write next, fear of what I might say in class that afternoon, fear of who I might eat lunch with. Nervousness and sweaty palms, everything a hesitation.  I left three weeks later, backpack strapped securely, hugging my pillow, walking slowly behind my parents. From that moment, there is one face. Max, with his dark hair and acne, looking down at my tear-streaked face. Max, whom Id only shared a couple brief, unimportant conversations with. You gonna be okay, H?

      Thursday: 1. Attend pseudo-get-together with  urlLink well dressed TFAers , while I came complete in the Heather uniform, complete with  urlLink appropriate footwear . 2. Emergency phone call to inform a certain someone of an inappropriately short skirt. 3. Golden Girls, Monty Python, and mocking conversation until the better-dressed crowd made their way to the bar and I made my way home to the  urlLink bed .  Friday: 1. Ash and friend come to visit. 2. Porch drinking, loud music, and other activities intended to draw police attention. 3. Plan created to get  urlLink underage sister  and friend into bar. 4. Bar event goes well for sister and friend, and poorly for everyone else, including multiple instances of unsolicited drunken kissing.  Saturday: 1. Early morning trip to resupply on cigs made for interesting learning experience concerning  urlLink pop-on rims . 2. Lunch trip to  urlLink The Crown  with unlimited pie. 3. Really really bad movie at Sam's. 4. Thunderstorm that was supposed to be really awesome cool, then wasn't cool at all... 5. Until two hours later when we realized we hadn't eaten dinner and went to Wendy's at 10:30 in a  urlLink hail storm .  Sunday: 1. Easter dinner not intended for the impatient. (seriously people, these things take time.) 2. Very smoky kitchen due to grilling/oven accident of a week ago that was never properly corrected. 3. Broke in a "new boyfriend," (J's, not mine) with a wealth of off color dinner table jokes. 4. Had the most boring evening of my young life, but managed to learn the following:        A. Other people are just as bored as you are, but don't talk about it as much.        B. Sparking grape juice and amaretto do not make an appropriate after-dinner beverage.  Monday:  1.  urlLink Drizzle and unusually cold temperatures  lead to... 2. Seven loads of laundry 3. Immense consumption of  urlLink left-over Easter dessert .

      1. Have an unsuccessful adolescence. Be awkward. Go home and watch Mister Rogers when youre fourteen and know you shouldnt. Like boys. Wear stirrup pants and long sweaters. Make sure the boys dont like you back.  2. In high school, find the boy who sums up the whole of everything you will ever want in a man. Place too much value on popularity, athleticism, and shiny dark hair. Perfect the after-school-drive-by with the help of your mom.  On your way to Wal-Mart, pray that you will see him there and that he will suddenly realize youre cool.  3. In college, fall in love with a professor or three. Have vast, vivid sexual fantasies about them.  Be too shy to answer questions in class, but take notes furiously. Graduate summa cum laude.  4. After college, continue to fall in love with the wrong type of man. Dont give someone the time of day if you think theyd actually call the morning after. Write poetry about trysts you thought were love but were actually little more than sweat and boredom.  Perfect the art of sounding vapid and intelligent via voice mail.  Learn the magical chemistry of being emotionally unavailable yet insistent.   Much thanks to Lorrie Moore and " urlLink How to Become a Writer ."

      Everything has been a bit blah for a while. I thought it was time to move into spring and leave my Diana DeGarmo-black-and-pink getup behind. That, and we've been lacking profanity lately.  I updated the links, and I think I'll add a few more before the day is out, mostly in a shameless homage to Lizzie's unfailing taste and my neverending efforts to steal her stuff.  My only contribution is  urlLink Roxy . I've been reading here for a while and she's entirely foul and devastatingly funny.    p.s. I think I'm trying to arrange links by size (?). Sorta like the time urlLink  J.R.  decided his archive links were starting to look like a penis.

      Now that I have seven more hellish periods behind me, I have to admit the weekend is a bit of a blur. How I ended up being the perpetually sober one this weekend, I'll never know. Maybe it had something to do with my lazy day off on Friday. Maybe I was in mommy mode. Either way, I don't think I lived up to my party-girl-potential.  Friday night was some sort of Spectators-One Block-babysitting-mess. Not enough beer, not enough drunk dialing, not enough people to fill my living room, much less a bar in Greenville.  However, while the horrific frat house wrestling matches left two friends with seriously bodily injuries, all I have to show for it is an attempted purple mushroom tattoo. Don't ask.  Saturday, in reverse order, VH1 until 4 a.m. keeping J. awake, One Block emergency rescue team, bonfire without any boys and with one communal marshmallow roasting stick, nap in someone else's bed, basketball, pizza, realization of moderate sunburn, catfish festival complete with cute boys and me in a halter top.  And Sunday was Sunday. There was lots of driving and lots of asking "What time is it again?" And it's all a big blur, but even in its bluriness and time-wasting-ness, it was a hell of a lot better than today.  Today where I feel fat and useless and tired with a capital "T."  In spite of my unfailing adoration and enjoyment of the fact that the entire state of Mississippi has sprung into bloom, my allergies are coming back with a vengance. I can feel that slight sting in the back of my throat. I doubt I could pop my ears if I tried. And the sneezes are coming at such regular intervals that if they were contractions, I'd be on my way to the hospital right about now.

      I'm taking the day off tomorrow, mainly because I freaking can (but partly because sometimes you go to school and everything goes really well and you need some time to bask in the glory of the academic process) except for the following horrors: 1. The Distance Learning equipment completely not working for the bazillionth time this year and the subsequent phone call inquiring as to why I didn't fix it. (Good lord, people. I have degrees in English and Anthropology.  If you need your eqipment excavated, call me. Otherwise, back the fuck off.) 2. A student getting stabbed in the head with a pen. 3. My principal hiding out in the library to avoid the flood of teachers attempting to turn in their notes requesting subs tomorrow. Wonder if it's ever dawned on him that if he got a backbone, he'd spend significantly less time avoiding people. 4. Stabber-girl's mother who reeked of old cigarette smoke and came very close to "bringing it" to the principal right in front of my face.  (If this had actually come to fruition, I know I would have stood and laughed and perhaps applauded. But then again, I'd probably be minus one job for such behavior.)  But no, really, it was a good day. A day to be celebrated. And I intend on celebrating, all by myself, while those little suckers attempt to dehumanize another substitute. God be with her.

      Teachers are exceptionally good at whining about how much work they do and how much more they should be paid. And sure, I work hard. Really hard sometimes. But, essentially, I get to go spend my days hanging out with really awesome kids, teaching them stuff, being lame, and learning new slang.  If anything, I should be giving part of my check back to them for how exponentially cooler I've gotten since I started teaching in the Delta.  However...  Certain days (like today) I spend a cagillion hours writing my grades in INK on grade sheets that I had to handwrite the names on. And once I'm finished with that, I have to rewrite them, by hand of course, on a different grade sheet, just in case little gnomes come into the office and steal the sheets which now exist in triplicate in three very different locations.  And once I'm finished with that, I have to spend an hour handwriting a grade distribution sheet that will be put into a file folder and never EVER looked at by anyone even though all my teeny tiny numbers are correct and beautiful.  And once I'm done with that (and all the other menial, secretarial things a teacher has to do in the last couple of days of school), I get to come home and stress about whether or not my principal will accept my grades printed out from a computer. (Knowing all the while that he raised hell over someone who did the same thing last year), after which I eventually decide to take out my poor little pen again and then enter every single grade that I had neatly printed out in spreadsheets into my "sooooooooo 1954" gradebook because my principal doesn't trust TECHNOLOGY even though it's 2004, and for some reason the grades are LESS REAL if they're on a printout.  So now my eyeballs feel like they're about to drop out of my head, I have a vague caffiene headache, and I'm grouchy. Don't fuck with me.

      I'm not dead, I'm just well rested.  It's not that I don't have anything to write about, it's just that I've adapted to keeping a lot inside.  It's not that I've had major life upheavals in the last week, however, I did happen to lose an entire group of friends.  I'm not worried about being lonely, but I'm constantly worrying about having a suitable/beautiful/cheap place to live.  I'm not concerned about summer plans, only that the summer already feels too short.  I wish there had been more kids allowed to attend classes today because that would have meant more hugs, but the two I did get were excellent.  I wish I could fix everything that's gone wrong for everyone in the last week, but I cant even seem to fix myself right now.  I'm not depressed, just introspective.

      1. I was getting sick of looking at my own fat face. If you're some sort of unannounced internet stalker, hopefully you had the vision and prior-planning to save it while it was around. If not, maybe you should call me sometime. I could use a date, or at least a free meal.  2. I'm debating the merits of standing up for myself/being the person I truly am vs. having the security of knowing where I'll be living August 1st. I know I made the right decision, but I'm already having nightmares about cardboard boxes and deposits and landlords and bills to forget and I'm surprised my hair isn't already falling out.  3. I only took two real "internet breaks" at work today, and I still haven't managed to write the freaking English 1 exam. (However, Lizzie, in her infinite wisdom, sent me old tests that I can piece together for at least half of my exam. And for that I shall buy her a drink and not forget her birthday this year.)  4. Just before I left school today it had rained for approximately thirty seconds and the pavement was radiating heat and moisture and the air was the breezy cool that happens when a front is coming through and the warmth on my feet, coolness on my face, and huge almost thunderstormy clouds made me remember why this place can make me so happy.  5. If I had a hit list, I think the new Blogger would be on it. (Even though I'm an obvious sell-out for using one of the new templates.)  6. I swear to all that is holy I'm bringing 200 Word Wednesday back tomorrow. Promise, promise, promise.

       Some days I miss being fifteen, and writing four page long notes in precalculus, where three and a half of the pages were dripping with song lyrics that I was sure expressed exactly how I was feeling at that moment.   Last night I was having illegal musical adventures on SoulSeek when I came across an entire album that has been out of stock on  urlLink CDBaby  for nearly six months. I laughed, I danced, I wept.   As for this song, just love it. That's all it needs.    urlLink Braille    She was lying on the floor and counting stretch marks  she hadn't been a virgin and he hadn't been a god  so she names the baby Elvis  to make up for the royalty he lacked   And from then on it was turpentine and patches  from then on it was cold Campbell's from the can  They were just two jerks playing with matches  Cause that's all they knew how to play   And it was raining cats and dogs out side of her window  And she knew they were destined to become sacred road kill on the way  And she was listening to the sound of heavens shaking  thinking about puddles, puddles and mistakes   And from then on it was turpentine and patches  from then on it was cold Campbell's from the can  They were just two jerks playing with matches  Cause that's all they knew how to play   Elvis never could carry a tune  she thought about this irony as she stared back at the moon  she was tracing the years with her fingers on her skin  saying why don't I begin again  with turpentine and patches  with cold Campbell's from the can  after all I'm still a jerk playing with matches  it's just that he's not around to play along  I'm still an ass hole playing with matches  Blowing out my wishes blowing out my dreams  Just sitting here and trying to decypher what's written in Braille upon my skin...

      To have the foresight to not start fights that correspond with my menstrual cycle.  To know where I'll be living next year, and for that place to be adorable and the perfect size for me and my stuff. And if God's listening, I'd also like hardwood floors, very white walls, tall kitchen cabinets, and colorful tile in the bathroom.  The energy to wash clothes, write my exams, and make the final push to the end of the school year.  To be in love.  To thank T.N. for hiding my  urlLink all-time favorite icecream  in the freezer, then forgetting to tell me, and letting me find it there tonight when I was desperate for a gift from the icecream gods.

       I had a best friend once  who would invite me to her house. Her dad would make peanut butter milkshakes for us, and we'd play dress up and dance in the rec room and watch Dirty Dancing late at night so we could see Patrick Swazye's butt.  Then one day, we were in different classes, and I turned into the loud girl who couldn't help but always speak her mind, the girl who didn't have many friends, the girl that didn't get invited over anymore. The girl that wasn't cool.   I had a best friend once  whom I cared for with all my heart. He taught me how to love so hard that it made me scared and vulnerable and real. With him I learned how hot the phone can get after hours of nonstop use.  With him I learned how to have a quality screaming match, how to sneak away from home without my parents really knowing where I was going, how to be the other woman.  Then one day, I found out he was telling my secrets to the latest flavor of the month. And after that he was gone.   I had a best friend once  who helped me become a better listener, a girly girl, an adult.  She let me remember that little things matter. Listening carefully to a song, perfect eyeliner, exboyfriends. We thought that being polar opposites on half of the world, and like-minded bitches on the other half would make us the perfect pair. And we were, briefly, until we realized that we argue too much and we live too far away. Then there was drifting.   I had a best friend once  who swore he knew what being a best friend was about.  He popped up in the middle of a classic, gray, nobody-gets-me phase.  I ditched a boyfriend, told my secrets, shared my bed.  Then one day, he met a girl, and I turned into the loud girl who couldn't help but always speak her mind, the girl who didn't have many friends, the girl that didn't get invited over anymore. The girl that wasn't cool.

      You are cordially invited to be my date to the SHS 2004 Junior/Senior Prom on Saturday, May 15. Activities to include: meeting the future of America, eating lots of food (probably fried), embarrassingly/endearingly dancing like a white person, discussions of the state of education/current music trends/glitter/girls showing too much tit/ass/belly/loss of dignity, mingling, asking people not to make-out/booty dance/simulate sex acts.  *Transportation will be provided (as long as you don't mind riding in a Saturn).  *Black tie not required. (You'll be with a chaperone. No one will care. Seriously.)  p.s. All RSVPs, acceptances, offers, etc. should be left in the comments. And you'd better damn well leave me a way to get in touch with you. Otherwise I'll be  that teacher  that couldn't even get herself a date for prom.

      You go to school and it's raining and you hydroplane four bazillion times on the crappy Mississippi highways and you know everything is going to suck.  But then you learn that the three of your seniors (two of whom worked their asses off) finally passed the English II exam and will be allowed to graduate and then promptly become "that crazy hugging teacher," and smile because you wouldn't rather be anything else.  Then, in 7th period, when  that student  decides he'd rather be a disruption and make a sign to hang around his neck that says "I'm a CHAMPION!!!" than take his test, remind him that champions do things like PASS ENGLISH I, and then become pleasantly surprised when he actually begins working on the test.  Then, after the half hour faculty meeting, where it's explained to you that students will need to preregister AGAIN because no one knew what they were doing the first time around, you proceed to go help assemble prom decorations.  You have the sudden realization that glitter is evil, but you recognize there's something therapeutic in becoming repeatedly stuck to the linoleum floor due to the accumulating spray adhesive on your shoes, and that you've reached your pinnacle of "teacherly beauty" when you catch a glimpse of yourself complete with coffee stained white shirt, old navy flipflops, and irridescent sparkle covering every single exposed millimeter of skin on your body.

      1. I'm tired and I'm still awake because I've been off work since Friday and my body-clock has gone summer-time-late-nights-whacko.  2. Shiny and New Blogger is sort of freaking my shit out, but I went ahead and used one of the new templates because I change my template more often than I put on makeup, so it seemed like the right thing to do.  3. Somehow I wasted two hours playing with a webcam earlier tonight.  4. I totally need to go to bed, teaching tomorrow, blah blah blah.   5. I'm strongly considering shutting the site down. I know I've threatened before but there's a lot of stuff going on right now that I'd love to write about but can't write honestly about due to my readership. I'll keep you updated on this one. If I bail, I'll at least leave a note, and the promise of a forwarding address to those that deserve it.  Sweet dreams, lovely ones.

      Today was really great. I feel sad, because Sarah and Britney are complete bitches. They told everyone I have an STD, just because I slept with both of their boyfriends on Saturday night.  I'm so sad. My kitten got run over this afternoon. I found him when I was coming home from school. His head was all squished. I took some photos. I'll miss him. Poor kitty.  Last night I had to go and pay Joshua's bail. He's such a jerk. He got arrested for punching the Walmart clerk in the face for refusing to sell him beer. He's only 16!  I want to tell the world that I'm gay.  I am making this journal friends only because I don't want the world to read what I'm writing, even though I'm posting it on the internet.  Today, I got a digital camera! Yes! I'm so ugly. Don't look at my photos pleeeeeze.  I want to say thanks to the world for absolutely fucking nothing! You all suck. I feel so alone, no one ever reads this journal, or even comments to let me know that I'm not suffering alone. It's cold here, and I want to die, but I cannot figure out how many of you to take with me when I go.  I went to the doctor yesterday, and he said I have bipolar disorder, and a healthy imagination.  You should all do this quiz! It's amazingly accurate. You just put in your name and birthday, and it will tell you what your favourite sexual position is.  That's enough for now. But I'll leave you with some naked photos of myself. (Not safe for work - teehee).   Created with the  urlLink Gregor's Semi-Automatic LiveJournal Updater&trade; . Update your journal today!

      I've been in a pissy mood. The pinacle of Heather-Melancholy.    As per blog therapy, a list of things that piss me off (or at least have pissed me off in the last 72 hours): *My friends *My family *How messy my classroom/office/bedroom are *I think I'm out of clean panties *Driving *People who think they're smarter than me *People who really ARE smarter than me *I'm stressed about the upcoming weekend that's supposed to be TOTALLY FUN *I'm STILL stressed about last weekend, which was supposed to be totally fun but wasn't *Boys who can't keep it in their pants on and/or keep their damn mouths shut *Teaching boring stuff like business letters *Forgetting the parts of a business letter *My continually demonic cellphone *Lack of significant other *People who get passive-aggressive over trampolines *The internet not working at school *The internet not working at home and eating my blog post earlier *Not being a blog "it girl" *Not being an anything "it girl" *Having to be someone's dinner/walmart monkey  Things that make the above marginally better: *Getting to read April's Seventeen Magazine in 6th period *Making stencils *My rockin cool haircut

      Off to sun and sand (and sunburn and sand in unfortunate places).  The tentative itenerary for those that give a damn: June 5-June 11: Ft. Walton Beach, Florida June 12-June 17: Chattanooga, TN June 19-?????: I won't be at home, and my cell will be out of area. (In other words, if you need to get in touch with me, it better darn well be worth thirty-five cents a minute.)  Questions? Comments? Feel free to leave a million of them. But don't you dare expect a response. I'm on freaking VACATION.

      In high school and well into college whenever life would get rough and confusing, I would go sit on the front steps on the porch and talk to god and the stars and the clouds and the moon.  Sometimes I'd talk for hours, others only a few minutes. Sometimes I'd bring a beverage or a book (if I knew I'd be in the conversation with oblivion for a while). In the cold, I'd wrap up in a blanket, trying to cover my bare, freezing toes. And in the summer I'd battle the mosquitos for my quality-night-time-in-depth-reflection.  I have a date with my porch tonight, and even though I can't actually sit on my steps due to an alarming roach-and-slug convention occuring nightly I'll see if anything will resolve itself.

      1. I'm alive and happy. Well, definitely alive and at least partially happy (when taking into account that there are a number of aspects of my life that are either not subject to change or currently subject to vast overwhelming change, neither of which I have any control over.)  2. I've vacationed my little heart out, and I'm actually home at the moment, but I plan on leaving again before the week is out. Personal stuff. It'll end up here soon enough.  3. I'm so on top of things that I've already reserved my truck to move, and called the Ole Miss people with the obligatory "Where in the hell is my diploma?!?" demands. (p.s. They mailed it. The USPS apparently ate it. I think I'll blame Reagan for this one as well.)  4. The throw-my-old-stuff-in-the-yard-and-see-if-anyone-will-take-the-junk plan worked brilliantly, and I'm now three chairs, one desk, and many broken appliances lighter.  (I'm sure the stellar and beautiful neon yellow FREE STUFF sign was what sealed the deal.)  5. The slow and arduous plan of moving anything that can fit in my trunk prior to Move Day 2004 has been hampered by the following: *A genetic tendency toward laziness *Lack of anything resembling a box *The RIDICULOUS AMOUNT OF CRAP that I own *The fact that my room looks like a warzone *Menstruation *Renting seasons two and three of Sex and the City  6. As for the real friend business of this site: *I have a new cell. If you need the number, email me. If you've called my on the old number in the past three weeks, I dont hate you, I just elected to leave it uncharged until my contract is over. *I'm looking for the following for the new Awesomely Cool Apartment of Heather (just in case anyone else is trying to unload furniture or is feeling extraordinarily generous): - A tv that works - A coffee table (preferably wood and somewhat 50's kitschy) - A programmable 12 cup coffeemaker

      A gap this pronounced between postings leaves one at a loss for where to begin. As most of you know a lot has happenned. Friendships lost, friendships regained, a couple thousand miles on my car, lost hours of sleep, falling in love, staying in love, dealing with the problems of being in love, moving, moving other people, dealing with the displacement of friends (if merely geographic in nature).  School starts on Monday, a moment sure to usher in a new wealth of school related postings, or perhaps not. Even though I've already had to deal with the trouble of changing classrooms (again) and less than precise schedules, everything seems to have slowed down in the work department. Nothing seems crazy and stressful right now. (I'm sure a lot of that has to do with the fact that I now know I can come home and lay on my couch for hours at a time and there isn't anyone around to say or do a damn thing about it. It's amazing what living alone can do for a person's well-being.)  Simply put, things are peaceful now. Peaceful, happy, and well decorated.  I'll save the rest for some other time. Politics, my newfound love of K-Mart, the zen quality of having all silver electronics, the constant smothering sensation of 'what happens next,' blahbity blahbity blah.  Just thought a couple people might need to know I'm still alive, and more mellow than you've ever seen me.
