      Much respect to  brocore818  from the  urlLink No Motiv  message board for finding this fun and addictive  urlLink game .  Joining the  urlLink Hey Mercedes mailing list  has its perks.  What cool guys.  They sent those on the list a secret link to an mp3.  Word!  I'm sensing this summer will hopefully be filled with good musical tours for my ears.  Hey Mercedes, No Motiv, Ozma, and The Living End are all putting out new CDs and touring!  Let's just hope they all don't come to the area and play at different venues on the same night.  I don't believe it is almost April.  My birthday's in April, but I really am looking forward to nicer weather rather than a birthday that will be peppered with a cake and having to work.  Bring on the allergies.

           Exit 135.  I'm almost there, then  BRAKE .  I left my house this morning for an interview.  I was on the parkway and coasting with ease southbound down the never-ending road.  I hear on my radio, dial set at  urlLink 880 am , that there is a 2-car accident around exit 135 in Clark, backed up for a mile and a half, with only one lane open.  Well, it sounds not good, but it's only backed up a little.  Well, when I got to milepost 137, a sea of cars formed a wall to my interview, which was set to begin in Brick Township at 10:45 am.  It is 9:10 am.  Ok, there's still plenty of time.  As I sit motionless in my car for a half hour, I try tuning in my radio to the traffic report, only there's a war briefing on every station, including sports stations.  So I try my hand at the FM stations, who only mention that there are 40 minute delays going into the Lincoln Tunnel and seem to think this Garden State Parkway does not exist.  I keep the radio on, hoping to hear something soon.  At about 9:40, they break away from the war briefing to tell me, there's a 10 mile backup on the Garden State Parkway South from 131 to 141.  Also, there's another accident at milepost 142, and another at the Raritan toll plaza.  Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh!  Approximately 18 minutes later, the parking lot begins to see movement and we're off, but cautiously.  As we trudge along, I see lines of cars pulled over from overheating, hoping mine will not follow suit.  Then, my lane decides to stop.  Only my lane.  I notice a cop car stopped in my lane up ahead, so the folk in front of me pull into the right or left lane to pass.  As I finally get into the left lane, the cop floors it and off he goes.  Why was he stopped?  Did he drop his donut?  Does he have narcolepsy?  Was he trying to make another accident?  We may never know.         Well, I get to exit 112 and notice it's 10:20.  I will probably be late.  I call and tell them the story and they are quite understanding.  I ended up getting there at 10:55, only 10 minutes late after all that.  The interview consisted of the assistant superintendent and 2 principals.  I felt like a monkey in the zoo.  Three people staring intently at me.  When do I get to throw my dookie at them?  After deflecting questions, the assistant superintendent tells me I did well, and wants me to fill out paperwork to sub, so if I were to get hired, I could start immediately.  I fill out papers and this takes another 25 minutes.  It is now 12:15.  The assistant superintendent asks if I have to be anywhere.  Other than Aruba, I say no.  She wants me to visit a school to talk to a teacher.  I say ok, because that is a good sign.  I get directions to the school and end up waiting for 10 minutes.  The principal comes out and hey, she decides to fire 20 questions at me.  After that fiasco, I ask for direction to GSP North.  Get me outta here.  It's after 1 and I am famished.  The principal doesn't know how to get there, neither does the secretary.  Another teacher tells me, but gives me the wrong directions, and I notice I am headed south.  I pull a U-turn, and finally see signs for the parkway.  I get home at 2:30.  Monday, great day!      Oh yes, I posted my  urlLink philosophy final .  If you feel like thinking read it.  I actually think this was one of my finals I actually deserved the "A".  Peace out.

      Oh yeah.  One last thing.  I was searching for some college papers and stumbled across my philosophy final.  I was impressed by how clever and philosophical I was.  I will post my work in the near future when my brain is less fuzzy and my eyes are fully open.

      Things are finally looking up for now!  After sending resumes to  71  districts, yes that is  71  districts, I am finally starting to hear from a few.  After the interview I had on the 19th, I got a call yesterday for a job in  urlLink this place .  It would also be a permanent sub position from now until the end of june, but it's another possibility.  My tournament bracket is a joke as usual.  So far, I have 4 sweet 16 teams already out, including missouri and illinois.  So now my focus will shift fully to the cuse as a fan, and not as some bracket-obsessed drunk.  I talked to  urlLink brandon  tonight, and he has finally left the black hole of music stores.  I'm happy for him.  It's officially spring, and that means my nose begins to close up.  Thank you allergies.  Beautiful days and breezy nights are hindered by my inability to perform necessary respiration.

      Oh yeah!  I finally had another interview today.  It was  urlLink here .  It would only be for two months, but I don't care.  It is a semi-permanent job in that it is going to be the same class every day.  It would be in a 4th grade, which would be cool as well.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed.  I just got the new  urlLink snoop  cd.  He is great!  Also,  urlLink tyronn lue  is the dumbest man on the planet, comparing the washington wizards' playoff run to the war in iraq.  Get a clue buddy.  Meanwhile, the sixers are playing real good basketball.  They actually have a chance at the #1 seed in the east.  As for the nets, well I realized I really don't like them.  Especially Kenyon Marin and Richard Jefferson.  Richard Jefferson whines about every call and everyone raves about his defense, but he pushes off and hacks every time.  Whatever.  In baseball, the Jays locked up two young all-stars in Vernon Wells and Erick Hinske.  I hope they wipe the floor with the yankees on opening day.  I believe south park's new season starts tonight at 10.  sweet.

      I am not engaged!  Was  urlLink sunset/sunrise  that convincing?  Wow!  I am flattered.  Good news for me=there is a job fair for Highlands at Matawan Regional High School on Thursday, April 3rd.  No Motiv may be touring around May/June.  Details when I find out.  I considered my  urlLink future in teaching  when I cannot seem to find a job in NJ.  Speaking of South Carolina, I bought tickets to a  urlLink minor league team  for my much anticipated trip to myrtle beach in July.  Only $14 for 2 tickets is my idea of baseball.  Who needs yankee stadium and the fun thrills of the bronx when you can have  urlLink this place .  Also, since we're flying down, we would have to rent a car.  Well, it is rather unfair that they insist on charging you up the ass for being one year under the 25 age restriction.  Anywhere from $10 a day to $25 a day.  Not to toot my own horn, but I may be only 23 right now, but I'm probably a safer driver than many many people over the age of 25, but I have to pay extra.  People who have totalled 3 cars but are 26 don't have to pay these fees.  Now that's fair.

      Okay, so i have written a new song entitled  urlLink the perfect storm .  I have done some things with this webpage.  I've combined some pages, deleted some, and changed the layout a bit.  If you are reading this, then you know where my updates will be from now on.  mess around with my page a little.  let me know if you like it or not.  give me some  urlLink feedback .  it would be appreciated, whether positive or negative.  i'm not a technical genius, and this isn't my full-time job, but i want the site to be somewhat fun for those few who visit.

      So I've taken a slight vacation from my blog, but it's for good reason.  Much work and planning.  Much pain.  Not much free time.  The job is coming along nicely.  It's difficult taking over a class 7 months after it has started, but I'm slowly making progress.  The students are starting to show more respect for my authoritay, and I'm just happy because I didn't have to do much today when I got home, probably because I was working straight through last night until 9:30.  It feels nice to not do stuff on a computer that's work-related...My birthday is tomorrow, and my wish is not coming true.  It's supposed to rain at night, and on Saturday, and be in the 40s.  Happy f*!@ing spring!  Along with this, there was supposed to be a  GHT  game on Saturday, which may get cancelled for rain again.  I'll probably be content for the next two months because I'm working and earning a paycheck, unfortunately, I will join the millions of unemployed come June 20.  Bye.

      I now know that I am employed because I have all of the symptoms:  dizziness, vomiting, migraines, insomnia.  Wait, I think I just described the symptoms of ebola.  No, in all seriousness, I am really happy to have some sort of steady job, even though it is only for 2 months.  It feels nice.  The people are all nice, and the students seem really fun. I'm actually proud of myself for the first time in a while.  My first 3 days are over, with an extended weekend coming up.  The true test will be to see if I survive a full week.  Ask me on my birthday.  (nudge, nudge, wink)   So far this season, the Jays are 1-6 against the yankees.  Not the kind of good start they needed.  Mark it down now-season over.  No playoffs.  I got the new  urlLink Pete Yorn  cd yesterday.  For some reason, I like his music, and if you liked his first cd, you'll probably like this one too.  Same formula-songwriter who plays guitar with mostly good songs, and 1 or 2 that aren't very good.

      I officially found out today that I have a job!  I start tomorrow, and I cannot wait.  It's only for 2 months, but it's a good start.  I'm still hoping I can find a nice place to start in September as well.  Who knows, maybe I can stick around in this district if something else opens up anytime soon.  My resumes have been mailed to  82  different districts.  Are there any other towns in New Jersey?  The weekend is over, and it is really nice out today.  I'll probably play some basketball in my yard.  I got my hoop about 8 years ago, with my first paycheck from the deli.  It's a nice hoop-one that can adjust the height, and it has wheels if you want to move it.  The only problem with my yard is that it is on the grass because I have no driveway, and there are tree roots everywhere.  It's kind of like extreme basketball because it's like dribbling through an obstacle course, but shooting is still fun.  You'd think with all the stuff in my yard, I would be a good ball-handler because it would make me more aware and consistent, but that's not true.  I have the body of a point guard with hands of steel.  Oh well, I'm not going to the  urlLink NBA  or anything, so I don't care.    I've needed gas in my car since Friday morning, but I still haven't gotten any.  I find it very annoying getting gas.  I don't know what it is.  Maybe it's because it costs $1.69/gallon.  Whatever, I just walked a lot more lately.

      Normally, I would be complaining about this rain, but I've decided against this and embraced the rain.  I would much rather have rain in April than snow.  I had to go fill out some paperwork for my job possibility today, and it was no fun driving on 280 with trucks flying along side you and splattering more water on your windshield, when visibility is poor already.  Alas, I am home for now, until I have to go pick up my very awesome girlfriend from school and bring her to work.  It's the weekend, and I am happy, because it is supposed to be in the 60s on Sunday, and warmer to start next week.  I watched the movie  Traffic  last night, but I wasn't too impressed by it.  It seemed very un-original and too long.  Benecio del Toro's part would have been much better in my eyes if I understood Spanish better, so I wouldn't have to read what he was saying.  Call me crazy, but every Michael Douglas movie I see has the same plot...or he just plays the same character over and over.

      I'm home again today.  It's for a sad note-there's a memorial service for my grandfather today...I also found out I will not be working tomorrow either.  My  urlLink honey's  car is having problems, so the weezer mobile gets a call from the bullpen.  That's my car in case you haven't figured it out.  I will be escorting her to the mechanic, school, and then to work.  So I'll be on call.  It will make me feel special, like a doctor or something.  So this puts my days working in April to 2, and that's with 2 different jobs!  I'm slyly smiling, however, because I absolutely despise one of these jobs.  Still haven't heard from my possible replacement job...  Jays are in 2nd place!  Woo-hoo!   urlLink Tanyon Sturtze  is 2-0.  He only needs 2 more wins to match last year's totals, and 18 more losses too!  I subscribed to  urlLink SI  in order to receive my Cuse package.  I  do  like the magazine, but I guess I never got it because I thought they devoted too much space to golf and nascar.  If I lived in South Carolina, I'd probably not mind as much, but we don't have many race tracks around these here parts.

      Hey.  I'm still happy.  Orange you?  dar-har-har!  I've been somewhat lucky with my sports teams winning championships, or at least being there.  The Rangers won a cup in 94, the Jays won back-to-back World Series in 92 & 93, the Bengals were in the SuperBowl in 89, and the Sixers were in the NBA Finals only 2 years ago, and the Orange made it to the championship game in 96.  I've realized that I feel much more happiness for college kids winning.  It's much more special to them, because they're not getting millions of dollars(yet), and this team that won wasn't a bunch of cocky jocks.  They are all good kids and team players.  So here's to the Cuse...  In addition, the Jays recently swept the Twins and beat the Sox last nite.  Good comeback after starting the season 0-3.  The Sixers are still in the running for first in the east as well.  I still haven't heard from my job possibility.  I really hope this doesn't fold.  I don't think I can take rejection...I also think I am sick of this cold weather.  It's now April 9th and in the forties, with snow still on the ground...The  urlLink GHT  Game of the Week for Saturday has already been cancelled because of expected rain Friday night, and the cold weather all week, which will not allow the fields to dry out...  I started out my morning by turning on the TV at 10:30. ( I didn't get a call to sub again)  I turned on  urlLink  CBS news  and was drawn in to the coverage of the war.  I saw US Marines tearing down a statue of the madman with Iraqi people stomping on its remains and dragging the head down the streets.  Reporter Byron Pitts was with Marines fighting street battles in Baghdad and his report was outstanding.  He was giving us coverage as the fighting was taking place, and it was even better than a Hollywood war movie.

      Woo!  The  urlLink Orange  are the NCAA champs!  A happy moment for all that are devoted to the cuse.  I'm happy for Jim Boeheim and the team.  I also respect Roy Williams, and hope he's the next to win a title.  By the way, he had the best comment of the night.  After the game, Bonnie Bernstein asked him about taking the North Carolina job, and he said "...I don't give a shit about North Carolina right now..." on live TV.  That's priceless.  She got what she deserved.  Damn media.  Will write more tomorrow.  It's late.

      Well, there's good news for me.  The principal has recommended me for the job, but I still have to wait on the superintendent and board of ed to approve me.  If all goes well, I start on April 15 and end on June 20 or so, their last day of school.  The job fair yesterday was a joke.  Advertised online were 9 schools, with all needing elementary teachers for september.  I get there and pay my $7 and they give me this packet.  The packet lists the schools that are there and the jobs they will be offering.  All 9 schools are listed as advertised.  OK.  Then as I read through the jobs, only one of these schools is looking for elementary teachers, and one of the schools listed actually is not there because they apparently do not have any open positions.  Strange, considering they were one of the 2 schools sponsoring the job fair.    Anyway, I proceded to the one listed school and the guy who talked to me seemed very uninterested in being there, and avoided eye contact with  everyone  he talked to.  Joke #1.  I was tempted to leave, but I drove 40 minutes and paid money for this thing, so I decided to go to some other schools just to give them my resume and stuff.  At the second line I waited for, the guy said wow you had a far drive(looking at my resume), and I said, "no it wasn't too bad, about a half hour or so."  He then gives me an application and says "have this filled out so when we start interviews, you'll have it ready."  Joke #2.  I then went over to my third attempt.   urlLink This place  seemed great.  The principal I talked to was excellent.  He was friendly and informed me that while there were not any postings for elementary teachers, there were indeed other elementary schools in the district that were looking.  He and the other principal were focusing on art and librarians, but he said the other elementary schools need teachers, and he would pass my resume to them.  Thank you sir for being a genuine human being.  It didn't seem like there were many there.  After that, I went to my fourth and final line.  It was for  urlLink this place .  Again, the gentleman that talked with me was pleasant and encouraging, telling me that I would be likely to have an interview at least in the near future in his district.  He told me I was at an advantage because they need male teachers.  So these two folks gave me at least a bit of hope from the experience, despite the rest of it being rather crappy.  So I'm still searching for a job for September, but I'm told it's still early for most districts to interview for next year.  I'm also looking for summer employment, because I refuse to work in a camp, and will never go back to retail.   EVER!  It's the weekend, but of course it's raining.

      The lesson went well today.  I'm supposed to find out by tomorrow afternoon already whether I've got the job or not.  Unfortunately, I won't be home tomorrow because I'm going to a job fair.  Hmm...I've got crazy links listed over there, so use them if you'd like.  Some are fun, and some are sites you probably won't even like, but you never know until you try.  So far, the Jays have been outscored 18-5 in two games.  I think that pitching is not their strong point.  Maybe I shouldn't watch the game tonight, because I've watched the other 2 unfortunately.  Yesterday afternoon at about 2:30, it began snowing in a way that I thought we were going to have another blizzard, but it stopped.  Today, it's about sixty out, and tomorrow and Friday may reach 70.  Huh?  The  urlLink GHT  baseball season starts on Saturday, and it will be welcomed with 50 degrees and hurricane conditions.  Lots of wind and rain.  Hey, what's baseball season at  GHT  without this weather?  I think I may be adventurous and do something to my  urlLink web page , like add a new section or give it another facelift.  Maybe.

      Happy April Fools Day Fool!  It was officially spring about 10 days or so, but to me, spring officially started yesterday, because it was opening day for baseball.  Unfortunately, my  urlLink Blue Jays  came up short against the much-hated yankees.  The season is young.  Six more months of this.  Is that good or bad?  Tomorrow is follow-up interview time, and the teacher who is supposed to help me out isn't very good with her communication skills.  I've called her 3 times, and the second time she called me back.  I'm still waiting for her to return my other calls...I'm going to watch the game now.

      The week is over and the testing is over, and surprisingly it is  raining !  Memorial Day weekend is upon is, yet it's in the 50s.  Hmm.  Interesting.   Yeah, Nets.  Up 3-0 over the Pistons, whom I now despise because I thought they sucked and did not really deserve to win the Sixers series, though neither did the Sixers I guess.  And can someone tell me why the Draft Lottery was on during primetime?  Hey, if I want to watch a bunch of ping pong balls, I can watch the lottery every damn night at 7:59 or whatever it is, and with that lottery, I have a chance to win money.  What do I get with the other?  Oh, I get to see the horrible teams that will ruin the careers of several young athletes.  In other sports news, I was happy the Jays beat the Yankees last night, and my boy Shannon Stewart had a nice offensive game.  I hate the Yankees, but I like Bernie Williams, and that stinks that he got hurt.  Oh well.    Bring on Sunday and Monday and some good BBQ, because Saturday is going to be a washout.  Tonight calls for pizza and either watching the Family Guy DVD or the Jays game-the usual motionless, blimp-like Friday night.  What a way to kick off the weekend!

      Today was a poop day overall because the testing consisted of two 25-minute sections and a 50 minute section.  It was long and boring.  Way too much for kids to do, especially when it's reading and writing. I was reading this book that I am supposed to read to my class every day called  The Cay  while they were testing. It's about a boy who gets shipwrecked on an island in the Caribbean during World War 2 with a man who worked on a boat.  They ended up becoming friends despite cultural differences and overcome lots of challenges and stuff.  It was a really good book.  I was surprised by it.  Anyway, math tomorrow and Friday and then it's done.  Just in time for the long weekend, in which it's supposed to rain again.  So the GHT games may be pushed back or cancelled.  It's par for the course for this baseball season.    Speaking of baseball,  MLB 2004  is a very fun and addictive game.  I guess in part because it's challenging and I haven't had a baseball video since the untouchable by comparison  Baseball Stars  for Nintendo.  What a classic that was!  Anyway, my record in a regular season schedule so far is 8-18.  It's pretty terrible, but I actually feel relieved when I can actually win a game, while in Baseball Stars, everyone on my team was powered up to their max in every category and I would 10-run rule the opposing team just about every game.    I had a really dirty dinner at  Olive Garden  tonight.  The dish was called the Mixed Grill and consisted of grilled chicken and Italian sausage with roasted potatoes and vegetables in a rosemary seasoning.  That was really good.  Then I came home and watched  the Simpsons  reruns.  As usual, it was the same episodes that I had seen no more than a month ago.  That really bothers me.  They've made over 300 episodes of the show, but it seems they show the same episodes over and over.  Believe me, nothing puts a damper on my day more than turning on channel 5 at 6:30 or 7 pm, and seeing "Treehouse of Horror," especially when it's May.

      I saw the new  Matrix  movie, but thought it was rather dumb.  I loved the original movie, but I thought this one was corny and it took an hour and a half for anything to happen.  When something finally happened, it was a really good action scene, but otherwise nothing great.  The ending was also not so great.  I know the other movie is coming out in November, but the way it ended was abrupt.  I was disappointed, especially since I wanted to see it so badly.  Oh well.  I also decided to make a rather impulsive purchase on Saturday.  I now own Playstation 2.  The price dropped again, so I jumped on it.  I've wanted it for a while, but never had the money for it.  I'm pretty sure that some new, advanced video game system will be out soon, because every time I buy a new system, it's obsolete.  For instance, we got Nintendo just before Genesis came out.  We got Genesis just before Playstation.  I got Playstation and within a year or so, PS2 and Xbox came out.  We'll see what happens next.    I was looking through a Brookstone magazine the other day and saw that they have arcade game machines like Ms. Pac-Man and Centipede.  I've always wanted to own one of those things when I have a house, but was saddened when the price was $3,000.  Yeesh.    The new testing has begun today in school.  It is very boring for me, and very much to ask 4th graders to sit still and not talk for nearly 2 hours for 4 straight days.  What can you do?

      Hello people.  If anyone has read the blog from May 17th before today, I want to say I was stupid for posting something personal that I shouldn't have.  I was angry and was blinded by how this blog should have nothing to do with some things in my life.  So I wanted to say sorry mainly to my girlfriend.  This was a mistake.  I did not think of how it could affect the situation before I posted.

      My first official  GHT  game occurred today, and it was a pretty good game.  Depaul beat Wayne Valley 5-1.  It didn't feel like the end of May because it was in the 50s, but baseball nonetheless.  So it's nice to get some extra income at least for this one game.  I'm gonna go watch game 7 of the Kings/Mavs series now.

       Our weekend starts on Wednesday .  It really does.  It's May 14th and I have yet to do a game with  GHT .  You see, this past Saturday would have been my first this season, but on my way up there, my car overheated two times, so I had to get towed.  Yippee.  It's back and functioning for now, but who knows what will strike next?  Well, there is a game this Saturday, so we'll see what happens.  If it doesn't rain, then I'm sure something will prevent me from doing the game.  We shall see.    Only 24 more days of teaching left for me.  That's sounds like very little, especially since there are 4 days of standardized testing next week, there's a field trip in June, and the last 3 days are half days.  So it's actually a lot less I guess.    I really hope the  Sixers  can pull out a victory tonite to jump a game up on the Pistons.  I am very happy the Lakers are down, but I'm sure the Spurs will find a way to lose the series. I ordered Sports Illustrated a while ago, but I'm still waiting for my Syracuse basketball gift package.  My brain automatically shuts down after 4 pm, so I cannot write anything else intelligent. bye.

      My car is green.  No, I did not get it painted from it's ultra-mellow gray, but it is covered in pollen or whatever you call that stuff that is just about everywhere now.  I  think  I'm starting to get a little better, but not too much because my sinuses are clogged from allergies and this cold that I can't seem to shake off.  I stayed home all weekend literally, and only went out of the house yesterday to pick up my dinner from the pizza place, but I'm still not 100 percent...I got a new air conditioner in my room, which is nice because it has a digital thermometer instead of "hi and low."  I actually used it last night on a moderate setting, not because it was warm out, but for the past two weeks, I've been getting a natural alarm clock courtesy of the annoying birds ouside my window at 5 am.  I didn't get that this morning; instead, I kept hearing the ac click on and off because it was getting too cold in my room.  I got home rather early from school today, basically because one of the other 4th grade teachers wasn't in this afternoon and the other was working with the 5th grades on their play.  So I did a few things and left at 3:10.  The earliest I've ever left, and school ends at 2:25.  So I got home and did my  urlLink bowflex .  That monstrosity actually works, I will admit.  I'm not going to look like those guys on the commercial, but that's because I don't take steroids and also because I don't eat as well as I should, but it definitely tones you.  I guess I was already skinny, so it's not like I want to lose weight.  I actually have been trying to gain weight, but it's damn hard.  Believe me, I eat plenty.  I've had the thing for I guess a year now, and I've gained maybe 10 pounds.  I'm sure when I'm older and fat I won't be complaining about not being able to gain weight.  I purchased tickets to see  urlLink No Motiv  over the weekend.  I've been a fan of theirs for 5 years or so, and have never been able to see them.  Of course their only opening for another band, but it's better than nothing.

      I have to say, I do not enjoy being sick, especially when I am sick at least 3 times a year.  But this really is no fun.  It's going around to every teacher in the building, so it was only a matter of time before I got it.  The sixers are moving on to round 2 of the playoffs.  It seems like round 1 took about 2 months.  Maybe it did.  I am sitting home resting on a perfectly good Saturday.  I should be working for GHT, but I don't want to pass this cold on to anyone else.  I just finished watching Memento, and I can't say I enjoyed it the second time around.  I guess because I knew what the outcome was.    On Thursday, I went to this multicultural event at my school.  It was a pretty cool idea, but it was really hot in the classrooms, and I was up there since 7:30 in the morning.  It was a 12 hour day, and I was already fighting the cold, so I checked out earlier than expected.  One cool thing I was able to do before nearly passing out was get my name written in 9 different languages.  It looks pretty nifty.  And the food was good.  I ate lots of stuff that I didn't know what it was, but it tasted good.  I'm not really in a good mood.  Probably the cold and probably another reason involving my girlfriend not seeing me today.

      It's officially a heatwave up in here.  I welcomed the heatwave by getting a really bad haircut.  I look like a Marine now, and I'm not happy.  I guess the Spanish lady at Supercuts didn't understand when I said "not too short on top please!"  I have an interview Tuesday, so I hope it grows in a bit.  Although it is only 5 days away.  Since it was unbearable outside, I spent time making some changes/additions to my  urlLink website .  I added some new  urlLink pictures  and also some new  urlLink quotes .  Let me know if you like it or not.  Jogging again tomorrow.  Bright and early at 6:30 am.  Then it's off to the shore on Saturday.  Woo!

      Vacation has officially started, and it is definitely summer.  It was somewhere in the mid 90s the last 2 days, and it is supposed to hit 95 tomorrow again.  Since I'm unemployed and not doing much else this summer, I've decided to take up jogging again, this time with the help of my lovely girlfriend.  Tomorrow the trek begins at 6:30 am.  We'll see how it goes.  We'll start at 3x a week, but maybe it will progress into more.  It's good I guess.  It keeps your heart healthy, and burns away some of that weight you want to get rid of or whatever.  So I will be going to bed shortly in order to get enough rest for my early rise tomorrow.  I also plan on selling back some old cds to my friend  CD World , and hopefully get enough credit to buy some new cds.  Here's what my list's possibilities include:  the new Cursive, Texas is the Reason, Miracle of 86, Nada Surf, OK Go, Mock Orange, White Stripes, and old Sugar Ray.  I'm a sucker for those groovin' sounds of Sugar Ray, so sue me. (except their new cd is mung).  Other than that, I'll probably do some Bowflex tomorrow sometime, and the rest of the week consists of getting a haircut, cleaning my room, playing some basketball, and making a mix tape.  Yeah, that's right, a mix  tape .  I don't have a cd burner like all of you technologically advanced folks.  It also sucks because if I make a mix tape, I don't have a tape player in my car.  Oh the headache!  In other news, my car is doing it's thing again.  The check engine light is randomly coming on and then disappearing again, and my thermostat gets really high, but doesn't go into the red area, and thus does not overheat, but it seems too high to me.  The last 2 times I've brought it to the mechanic, they've said, "I don't see anything wrong with it."  Now if I had a light that said something like "check heartbeat," I don't think my doctor would be like "well, I looked but I don't  see  anything wrong.  Those guys should examine my car if they're going to have it all day and find  something !  Make it up at least.  I won't know.  Anyway, let's see if I feel like taking it in again tomorrow.

      School's out!  Well, I still have to go back tomorrow to finish a few things, but no more students or teaching.  I still don't have a job for September yet and that sucks.  So I guess my summer will technically start Saturday.  Next weekend I'm going down the shore.  I can't wait.  I'm so tired of here.  Even if it rains, which I'm sure it will, at least it's not here.    I'm going to karaoke night tonite.  Should be interesting.  I probably won't be able to drink much because a) I have to drive, and b)I don't want to add to my already tired-ness.  But it will be nice to "unwind" nonetheless.    So much has happened since my last post.  I saw No Motiv finally last Weds nite.  They were good, but they didn't headline, so they only played for like 40 minutes.  Then we left before the crappy Rx Bandits started their set.  This show compelled me to finally purchase one of NM's original 2 CDs, and it's a good cd.  It's a lot more edgy than their last 2 cds.    Let's see what else...I went on an interview in the school I was working for a first grade opening, which did not go well because I have no idea how to teach first grade.  On the upside, however, there may now be a 4th grade opening, so I do have a slim chance at staying at the school, but most likely not.    I guess not much else really has happened.  I changed a little bit of my  urlLink site , but not a whole lot.  I guess I have to find some more pictures and fun stuff to put there soon.  Is anyone else tired of hearing about Ashton Kutcher?  I don't care if he's screwing 40 year old Demi Moore, who's infested with venereal disease.  I just don't find her attractive.  Maybe it's because I fear she would try to gnaw on me with her rather large jaws.    About a month until vacation.  Now that's what I'm dreaming of day in and day out.

      Welcome, June!  It's still raining though.    It's a new month, but something in my life still does not feel right.  And I don't know what the outcome is going to be.  Just when you think you have things figured out, it occurs to you that your problem is not solved, and you don't really know what to do about it, except maybe put an end to it and try something new.

      Day 3  07.22.2003  Tuesday  We arise from bed to eat our Cheerios and decide to head over to  urlLink Barefoot Landing , which is a big slew of stores and restaurants on this swamp filled with alligators and dragonflies. We walk around some shops at first, and we purchase a pair of sunglasses.  I'm not really a fan of wearing them, but you really needed them down there.  It was awfully hazy.    We continue in search of  urlLink Alligator Adventure , which is a zoo-type place filled with bears.  No seriously, it's filled with alligators, but they kept advertising this bear show.  Huh?  We pay for tix, which were an economical $12 each even after my trusty coupon.  The place is very uneventful, as every alligator, crocodile, and turtle were dead to the world, because it was hot as balls out.  We took pictures of a bunch of immobile reptiles.  We saw 2 albino alligators, which were outstandingly creepy.  We then went over to the bleachers at 12:45 because they were supposed to feed the reptiles at 1 pm in a show.  So we wait     and      wait.  Then this employee struts over and says "uh, the feeding is taking place at the main boardwalk today."  Well, that's nice to know now.  We unemphatically trudge to the main area and immediately turn around for the exit.  I believe everyone in that place was huddled over the fence to watch the feeding, so we had no chance of seeing a glimpse of anything.  We flee.    Hungry.  We are relatively close to the  urlLink House of Blues .  I wasn't even aware they served lunch, but Kim guessed they did.  Luckily, she was right.  It's pretty cool inside.  I had never been to one before.  I had this pulled pork bbq sandwich with sweet potato fries.  Good stuff.  In the process of eating, I pull out the map of the area, and we decide we should give it another chance and hit the shops across the lagoon thing.  After lunch, we drove around to the other side and walked around a bit, and realized that indeed, this place did suck.  We left.  I have no recollection of the late afternoon.  I remember we tried to go to the Outback Steakhouse for dinner, but found they had a 55 minute wait, and there was a line of people wrapped around the perimeter.  Oh crap, let's go elsewhere.  We get in the car and fade into the horizon down King's Highway as the rain begins pelting our windshield.  Everywhere had a line, so we hit good ole' Pizza Hut.  No wait.  We're in.  Everyone stares at us.  I stare back and give some really evil looks.  We eat half sausage/half plain stuffed crust pizza.  I have to relieve myself of the 3 iced teas I have.  On my way to the restroom, a weasel-looking lady in line seems reluctant to move and stares at me.  I pass through and on my way out I encounter the rodent woman again.  "Excuse me please."  No movement.  I burst through her and give her a glare.  "I said excuse me."    It's still raining, so we can't do anything outdoors, like swim in the pool or play some mini golf.  I say, hey let's try the mall by our hotel.  It's Tuesday, and the new  urlLink 311  cd came out today.  We enter and see a FYE store-"For Your Excrement."  This store sucks.  I hate the ones up here, so I know I'll hate this one.  I ask the plump clerk at the counter if they have the new 311, since it was nowhere to be found on their new release shelf or in the section.  "Three-leven?"  "Nah, the only new releases we gawt are Now thirrrtain and (some other crap I don't remember)."  Wow, you've been a help.  Bye.  We continued through the mall to find  NOTHING  of interest.  We leave.  Back to the hotel room.  We drink some JD and eat pretzels and peanuts and watch Road Trip on TV.  Tomorrow we'll try the Outlet stores.  There's a whole mess of them, and at night I have tickets to see the  urlLink Myrtle Beach Pelicans , a minor league baseball team.  See if you can find out what will go wrong.

      Greetings!  I am Kim, Brian's girlfriend.  Bri was nice enough to let me join his blogger and I'm stoked because I've never done this kind of thing before.  So everything Brian has said about vacation is true.  I truly believe that the generator incident was an omen to not go on this trip to Myrtle Beach.  But all I can say is thank God the generator didn't shut down while we were in the air.  That could have been very tragic and very messy.  The mold in the room thing is true as well but Brian forgot to mention one thing - I am allergic to mold.   I did not learn of this allergy until this trip so I guess I learned something useful.    Bri also failed to mention the nasty things we came upon in the room besides the pool in front of the AC and the mold.  Now this may be a chick thing but I was grossed out by the towels and my pillow.  The towels had black and yellow stains all over them and i was not about to use them on my ass.  One of the washcloths I saw had hair on it and I'm not talking about the ones on top of your hair.  YUCK!!!!  My pillow had some kind of red stain on it(blood?).  So me and Bri wound up sharing a pillow and bumped heads twice during the night.    Much more horror to come!

      Day 2 of our trip... 07.21.2003  Monday  We had planned to do all of the Ripley's stuff today.(Like the Believe it or Not! Museum, etc.)  I had purchased a combo pass to four of its attractions a while back on the Internet.  The included things to do were:   urlLink Ripley's Aquarium , Believe It or Not Museum, Haunted Adventure, and Moving 4-D Theater.  I was informed to pick up the passes for all events at the aquarium, so that led us logically to the aquarium first.  We started with a breakfast at the hotel eatery, which was ok, but I noticed their OJ sucked.  Anyway, we made our way to the aquarium, where we found proof that the people down there were rude, as they cut in front of us with families of 8, bumped into us without saying "excuse me," and stared and stared at us like we were living in the 1800s because of our mixed cultures.  Ignoring these issues, the aquarium was a pretty cool place.  It had many fish, rays, turtles, and sharks.  Its main attraction was a tunnel with a motorized walkway which led you through a sea of sharks and fish.  The sharks were swimming all around you, and you could see their teeth up close.  Needless to say we used our first roll of film at this place.  Of course, you had to exit through the gift shop, so we walked through and glanced around, and then the power failed.  It gave me an image of a Jurassic Park-esque adventure.  The sharks had been scheming to take over this place and escape into town.  They were tired of tourists gawking at them.  But the backup generator took over and lights on.  We left.  On to attraction #2.  The museum.  The next 3 places were all located together, but at a different location, so we had to drive a bit to get there.  We hit the museum, and it was what I expected.  It was kind of hokey-pokey in that it was cheesy like that tv show, but it did have some cool things in it.  But there's only so much I could take of seeing the bearded woman or the cow with an arm growing out of it's back.  Freak show.  We walked slowly down the road to our #3 stop, the Haunted Adventure.  This place was just a haunted house that you may see around Halloween, but it was pretty neat.  It started in an old elevator stuffed with 8 people.  You are then instructed by the guy in makeup to form a chain and walk through the house, which we did.  Much of it was total darkness, so it was difficult.  A few little scares, but nothing major.    A few door down was the last place, the 4-D Moving Theater.  We went in to this waiting room with about 20 other people with nothing to do but wait for the next showing.  They had this tv that kept spooling the safety rules over and over and over again.  It was poison for your eyes.  Finally, we were let in after about 20 minutes of waiting.  We were definitely looking forward to this part because they have one of these in Universal Studios, and it's like the Terminator coming at you and there's smoke and mist.  It ended up being lame.  We were a log that moved through a mine on one of those mining carts, and it looked like the tracks were a roller coaster, and we, as the log occasionally fell into water and got mist-ed.  Why a log?  Couldn't they come up with a more interesting idea?    We left the final attraction and saw a gift shop across the street known only as "The Gay Dolphin."  I wondered what definition of the word gay was implied.  I still don't know, but the shop was garbage.    We left for the hotel, but decided we needed some snacks and drinks for our room, so we cruised down King's Highway and found a CVS.  We snagged Cheerios, bowls, spoons, milk, OJ, iced tea, a big-ass jug of water, sweet roasted nuts, and a bag of pretzels.  We headed back to our room with a plentiful booty.  Yarr.  As usual, we did not know where to eat lunch, so we utilized the in-room guest book and found a tiny Italian place.  We jumped there and ate salad, raviolis, and a broccoli roll.  Pretty good food.  Since it was still a nice day, although a bit late, we decided to head to the beach.  It was about 4, and I figured I wouldn't get burned by the sun at this time as badly as noon.  We got set up on our spot around 4:45, and hit the water, which was warm and comfortable.  We stayed in wave after wave until almost 8, when we decided we should probably eat some dinner.  We got back to our room, showered, and found out it was 8:30 and we didn't want to eat anything big, so we'd get BK.  I first hit Green's Discount Beverages for some JD coolers-Lynchburg Lemonade and Hurricane Punch...Well, we waited in the drive thru for about 20 minutes and then when we got our food, my chicken sandwich was blackened, and we were missing a fry.  Bloody savages.  This resulted in my kicking and cussing back at the room.  Thus concludes day #2 with a pissy outlook for the rest of the week based on rain in the forecast and the ending of day 2.

      My, it's been a while since blogging, partly due to vacation which occurred last week.  There's plenty of stories to tell, so I will do this as a recap-by-day blog.  For example, I will blog our first day today, our second day tomorrow, and so on.  Here goes.  Enjoy...  07.20.2003  Sunday  Wake up at 5:30 am.  Our flight departs at 9:30 for Myrtle Beach, and I'm told to get to the airport at least 2 hours before departure.  I get ready, finish packing, and my ride gets here at 6:45 am.  We get to  urlLink Newark Liberty International Airport  at approximately 7:05 am, after passing briefly through the lovely town of Irvington.  For those of you unfamiliar with the area, Irvington is like New Jersey's Compton.  We jump in line outside by the skycaps for urlLink Continental Airlines .  The line moved rather quickly actually.  The dude checked our bag and gave us our boarding passes and inside we went.        There's a side note to this story.  I had made our flight reservation in February.  Since that time, I had received 3 different notices in the mail stating that our flight time had changed, with the latest notice changing my seats as well.  I called their "customer care" number and they said I would have to tell them at the ticket counter inside the airport.   So we make our way to our terminal and make it through security.  I had to take my shoes off, but no big deal otherwise.  We get through and make it to our gate rather early, and notice our flight is not on the computer screen yet.  We head over to the book shop to peruse their selection of reading and get back to find a place to sit for a few hours.  When we came back, I was able to change our seats so we were together.  Well, the flight finally shows up and we board pretty much on time.  We find our seats and the plane begins moving towards the runway, and suddenly the lights and engines stop.  Hmm.  "This is your captain.  We are having some problems with our generator.  Sit tight briefly while maintenance takes a look at it.  Meanwhile, the air is not working, and we are sitting in the plane oh, for about 2 hours before we find out that we have to switch flights.    The flight we are switching to is across the airport, at gate 124 or something.  So we rush across, and have no idea when the flight is leaving, so we eat some Teriyaki chicken at the food court, which was excellent.  The flight begins boarding around 12, and we finally take off soon after.  The flight was pretty smooth, and we landed after 2 sometime.  Now it's time to get the luggage and get my rental car.  I head over to the  urlLink Enterprise  kiosk, and they tell me they don't have any cars left for my reservation, so the guy at least hooks me up with Thrifty for the same price, and probably a better car.    We get to our hotel, the lovely  urlLink Patricia Grand .  We check in at 3, and find our room.  We go in the room.  We realize this vacation is going to suck-diddly-uck.  There's a huge puddle on the rug by the ac and balcony, probably from the ac leaking.  It's not just a little damp, but it's like when it downpours and you go play mini-golf afterwards.  It sloshes like that.  I call the desk and they say they'll send a guy up.  Meanwhile, we examine the room to find mold on the walls, probably from the lake in our room, a smaller room than advertised, and an ash tray, even though I reserved a non-smoking room.  Knock.  Hey guy, come look at this oasis in our room.  Dag, yall, that's about 5 gallons of water, probably cuz the ac froze up.  I'll be back with a vac.  This is all said in the South Carolina accent.  He comes back up very quickly and sucks up the water with a monster shop vac.  He was a real nice guy at least, and quick.    We decide to go out because we're getting hungry and don't want to stay in a moldy room.  We head for  urlLink Broadway at the Beach , which is a big cluster of restaurants, shops, bars, etc., all around this lake thing.  We stroll around to see a long line at the Hard Rock Cafe, which is fine with me, because I didn't want to spend $10 for a burger anyway.  We find a keen place called the Key West Grill.  There's a line, but we decide to see what the wait will be.  The dude says, well there's no wait if you want to eat outside.  Of course!  We're hungry.  We sit right on the dock of this lake, eat some dirty salmon and potato skins, and enjoy a nice breeze.  All right, maybe things won't be so bad after all.  We walk around a bit and decided to hit the  urlLink Imax theater .  We saw some adrenaline video with dudes who jump off planes and fly.  We head back to the hotel and decide to take a night swim in the pool, which was freezing it seemed, but there was no way I was going in the heated indoor pool.  That's where pee lives.  An interesting day one with a not-bad ending after a rather horrible beginning.  We'll see what Monday brings.

      Five more days till happiness.  This past weekend was spent down the shizzore, but none of which was at the beach or boardwalk.  Saturday night, we attended a  urlLink minor league baseball game  for the sake of my uncle's club.  The game was ok and the stadium was beautiful, but the food was atrocious.  How can you screw up a hot dog and Italian ice?  Day 2 was intended for the boardwalk/beach, but we could not get to that area because there was a line of cars backed up to the parkway practically.  So we did an about face and headed back to our retreat area, where we ended up hitching a ride with my bro and sis-in-law to a crafty place we call  Blackbeard's Cove .  Yarr.  It had mini golf, archery, batting cages, etc.   It had a pirate's theme, keeping up with our viewing of the  Pirates of the Caribbean  movie on Friday nite.  Yesterday was pretty much be a slug day, but I did bowflex, run, and make a cd.  The night was capped off by visiting former co-workers and friends John, Brandon, and Kate.  It was nice talking to them, and I'm glad to see they're having a blast since leaving a certain working hell.  (It sounds like "Damn Hoody" and it's a place where cds are sold).  I think I handled that pretty well, and escaped any copyright infringement.

      Is it going to rain or what?  I started out by morning by running, and noticed the sky was not looking very inviting.  It's been grey-ish for the past few days but no rain really, yet the folks at the weather channel have been "predicting" thunderstorms for the past 2 days and thru Friday.    Today should be an enthralling day of taking my grandmother to the doctor and waiting.  I guess while I wait I'll finish reading my book.  I'm a little more than halfway thru it.  It's  Summer of Storms  by Judith Kelman.  It's really drawn me in so far.  I'm on page 200, and the only reason I'm not further is that I read it at night, and my eyes start getting lazy on me.  I'm going to try and finish it for tomorrow...The rest of my day will consist of sending out more resumes, doing bowflex, eating lunch sometime, and playing some  MLB 2004  for PS2.  It's one of two games I bought, but it's fun.  I'm playing a full season with my Jays, and am at the end of July, and just recently pulled into first place ahead of the Yankees and Sox, because of my brilliant pitching performances as of late.  The other game I bought was Metal Gear2, which I was able to complete at the very easy level.  I loved the first one, and this one was pretty fun, too.  One day, I'll try it on a harder level.  Eleven days until Myrtle Beach.  Eleven days until fun, and seventeen days until I come home broke, burnt, and depressed for being back home!

      Today was a miserable experience at dmv.  I was there for nearly 2 hours just to get a duplicate license.  My license did not have a photo on it, since I renewed it via mail 3 years ago, but since I'm flying to South Carolina, I need one with a photo, so I had to purchase a duplicate with a photo.  Jovial employees only made the experience better.  I looked through possible stuff to do down in Myrtle Beach today, and there's a lot, and it's going to make me broke.  You know what bothers me?  People who are dishonest.  I don't know where that came from, but it annoys me to no end.  So it's supposed to feel like 110 tomorrow, and of course it's supposed to be 78 and rainy on Thursday, when I wanted to go to the shore.  Oh well.  I hope I find a job soon.  Oh just a side note.  In the sports section today, there was an article on how Roger Clemens got snubbed from the All-Star team.  That is absolutely ridiculous.  Sure he won his 300th game this year, but not all of them occurred this year.  What's his record, like 8-6?  And he deserved to make the team?  Come on.  I hate the Yankees.

      Hello July.  Happy birthday Den and Rob!(from June 29 & 30, respectively)  So it is absolutely bee-yootiful today.  I had an interview today for a 5th grade position.  The principal and people who interviewed me were really pleasant, and the school was relatively small, which I like.  The only problem is that if I actually get the job, it might only last to February because the teacher is on military leave.  So if I got the job, I would be back to square 1 again in February or March.  Hmm, I guess I'll just have to wait and see...  Today I washed my car, so I'm sure it will rain sometime in the next 24 hours.  The only thing I don't like is all the gooey crap that's stuck at the bottom of my doors from my tires kicking it up.  I can't get it completely off.  I use soap, bug & tar stuff; it just doesn't budge.  It looks shiny and clean nonetheless.  only 19 days till vacation.  enjoy the weather.

      Glad to hear from Matt!  Now everyone's official.  First of all, getting back to the Olive Garden.  The Olive Garden sucks.  Saturday was the first time I've gotten vocal with a waitress, because a table that ordered 10 minutes after us got their food before us, and two of them ordered what I had.  I said, "Bitch, where the f--- is my food?  I will kill you if it's not here in 25 seconds."  No I didn't really say that, but I was pissed and she knew it.  They suck.  Party at brother's house was interesting.  Supposed to be a "pool party," but it was 70 and breezy, so if you went in the water, you would come out missing your reproductive glands.  Too cold to swim today.  But some nice food and drink.  The kind of drink that makes the day seem better.  Kim, would you like to tell about our ice fiasco before the party?    Well, here's part 3 of my story:  That night spooked me.  The murder scared me, and I could tell Corey was affected, too.  The tension between us was thicker than a two-day-old McDonalds milkshake.  We didnt talk much.  We just watched some Scooby Doo.  It entertained his feeble mind, and kept me from worrying a bit.  At about six oclock, just before the news, the doorbell rang.  I jumped and Corey dashed to answer it.  Andy and Josie walked in. Neither goes anywhere without the other half.   I had known Andy from elementary school, and he had always been a real person.  For instance, he had to wear glasses as a child, and constantly was chastised for it.  In his junior year of high school, his doctor told him he no longer needed to wear them.  He decided that his glasses had been through so much with him, that they were indeed a part of him, just like wearing his underwear everyday.  Andy still wears his glasses all the time.  Josie was a friend of mine who I had set up with Andy.  She is a sweet, attractive girl.  Shes the type of girl that you can be friends with, but deep down youre so damn jealous of her.  She was tall, maybe about five ten, and had beautiful brown hair and full lips.  Her body was unfair as well.  Her height presented her with long legs, and she also had killer curves, from her beautiful breasts to her sexy hips.  She meshed well with Andy, too.  Theyve been going out for half a year now, and are getting closer every day.   I looked at the visitors.  Nothing ever seemed to phase Andy, but I noticed Josie was zoned.    Sup guys?  I found out some more about the murder in my last class today.  I heard they brought in Erikas ex for questioning.  Andy was directing this mainly at Corey, because I was concentrating on Josie.  Who?  Sammy? asked Corey.  Yeah.  It seems logical.  He was such a pervert.  He was into voyeurism and all that shit.  I heard one time he got caught watching Miss Burns in the bathroom.  Oh thats gross Andy! I barked.  You know thats not true!  I noticed Josies eyes.  They opened wide when Andy mentioned Sammy, like she knew, or had experienced his perversions before.  Well, now that I think of it, she used to go out with Sammy, so maybe  Corey signaled to Andy to chill with the murder talk for now.  Andy looked humbled, and we all silently sat down to watch some TV.  We channel surfed through the time slot of the news, and ended up watching reruns of The Cosby Show for a while.  Theres one channel that shows reruns of the show for three consecutive hours.  I think we caught five episodes, and then Cheers came on for a string of reruns.  I guess we all fell asleep.  The last thing I remembered was Cliff and Norm poking fun at Woody.  Corey nudged me at about one in the morning.  Christy, you were supposed to be home by now.  Let me take you home.  Cant I just stay?  Im tired.  I wish you could, but your parents thought you were going home tonight.  What if they try to call you in the morning and youre not there?  I got up and stretched.  My arms extended above my head with a yawn, and my shirt lifted above my belt and exposed my bare stomach.  I noticed Corey catching a glimpse.    I was reluctant to go to a home where my parents no longer lived.  I stayed in the old house, which was small, while they moved into a larger pad.  Sure they were close, but I still wasnt used to living on my own.  Andy and Josie must have opened their eyes, too, because they quietly shuffled out the door.  I noticed Andy giving a weary wave as he exited.

      Hello all, Even with the convenience of communication supplied by the blog, I still take forever to write. My apologies. I just finished my first week of classes since coming back from my first full-time rotation, and I have realized that I don't want to be in classes any more. I just want to finish. Only nine more months to go.  Dave Attell was pretty funny, not a whole lot of new stuff, but still worth the trip to see him. The last 20 minutes of the act were kinda rough. It was a midnight show, and Dave had already done 2 shows earlier and went pretty heavy on the jagr shots during his set, combine this with the annoying drunks who felt like they had to yell things like: "when you went to Amsterdam, that rocked!" (it reminded me of "The Chris Farley Show" skit from SNL).  In order to waste more of my time, I picked up a Nintendo Gamecube from ebay last week, I'm eagerly anticipating it's delivery so I can flush my future down the toilet and play Soul Calibur 2. That's the big news in my life, I shall blog again later.

      Hey guys!  Sorry for the Sparta confusion.  From now on I will no longer mention the city of Sparta.  Rob, you are too funny!  A frisbee.  Hehe..  Going to stuff my face with lots of garlic today at the Olive Garden.  I keep hearing stories about people getting sick from their food, but from what I hear its their meat sauce which I think sucks anyway.  However, their appetizers are delectable as well as their breadsticks and salad, which by the way has a lack of olives.  Is it ironic?

      Saturday and college football is in the air.  But I just remembered I don't care.  Watch out for William Paterson!  They might win 3 games this year.  As for the pros, it's the same old Bengals.  They lose because of 2 turnovers and they can't convert an extra point.  Same story as last year, and the year before that, and the 11 years before that...Here's part 2 of my story.   Late on a Thursday morning, the student center usually becomes a jubilant place to be, since the weekend would be creeping up soon.  Not today, though.  The murder of a fellow peer, Erika Harmon, stirred up the entire student body.  Erika was a plain girl-not very smart or athletic, just your everyday Jane Doe.  I heard she was found with her eyes missing, said Corey, my boyfriend.  I guess she didnt see it coming, said a giggling Andy.  You would think they would be mature enough to respect the dead since theyre in college.  I wont call them college students because I cant say if they actually study, but they are in college.  I have been going out with Corey for only about two months now, so I dont know where our relationship is going, but I do know I need him to grow up a little bit.  Thats so rude.  Youre joking about a girl who was just murdered, I snapped.  Sorry, Christy.  Ill be right back.  Please stop joking about this.  Its not funny. This is serious.  	I made my way to the restroom before Corey and I left for his place.  The boys continued to talk despite the plea, but kept it at a whisper at least.  Dude, I heard they found a note that said love is blind or something, said Corey.  Well, she didnt have any eyes, so  Andy giggled again.  Yeah, because the killer probably did something freaky with them, like put em in his pants or something.  Ooooh.  Well, I gotta go see if I have my class, so Ill see you later, Andy uttered.  Andy was even slightly disturbed by my boyfriends lack of taste.  He made a grimace that Corey probably interpreted as a smile, but most would recognize as a you went a bit too far with that one look.  He turned towards the glaring sun and made his way to the Comm Building for class.   Andy was majoring in communication.  He wasnt a brilliant human, but he knew how to talk and listen well.  I returned, worried.  It seemed surreal that murder could get this close.  Corey knew I was upset.  He kissed me lightly on the cheek to let me know he was there, and led me out to his car so we could go to his house.  Our classes were done for the day.  It was weird.  I didnt really want to go.    I almost got into an accident on my way here, Corey blurted.  Oh, sorry, I said, not really aware of what he said.  Are you gonna be OK? he asked.  Yeah.  I shook my head no to contradict my words.  Corey pulled me close to hug me, but he knew I wasnt hugging back.    He shut the car door after I was seated and went around to get in his side.  There was a ticket lodged underneath his wiper blade.  He was familiar with finding the bills on his windshield.  He opened the glove box, folded the ticket quickly, and stuffed it among the crinkled repair slips.  Careless.  The car started.  Silence.  The radio wasntWell, it wasnt on.  The horrible sounds of manufactured modern rock sounded abruptly in the speakers and Corey continued to switch between commercials and Linkin Park.  I couldnt decide which was worse.  Although annoying, I realized that I had momentarily forgotten about the horrifying events.    Corey recklessly plops into a spot not far from his place, between an oversized SUV and dumpy pick-up.  The Subarus front end is brushing the tail of the SUV, and his rear is jutting out past the width of even the SUV.  Instead of straightening the car, he stops the engine and slams the door.  I get out and grasp his hand lightly.  We walk towards his apartment.  Number 7 is nearly invisible from the street.  It hides at the junction of the L-shaped complex, behind bristly shrubs.  Theres always bees hovering around from the vegetation.  We enter and he throws his keys on the old end table.  We plop ourselves on his couch and welcome the safety of a home.

      Hey all.  I finished my story for now.  That's not to say that I won't change things or add things, but I've made it have a beginning, middle, and end.  So here's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to post it piece by piece right here on blogger.  A little bit every day.  After posting the first part, I may try to add it to my  urlLink site , but I don't want to post it as a doc file in word, so I don't know yet.  It's too much work to convert it to html on my site, too.  I'll let you know.  Here's the beginning.  As usual, I appreciate  urlLink feedback .  I apologize for the lack of indentations as well.  The formatting of blogger is not being cooperative for me.   "An Eye For Murder" by Brian Burkhardt   "She was found dead early this morning in her apartment two miles north of Vernon College. She was a sophomore there, where she majored in philosophy. Her devastated family would not comment."   "In Harrison last night, a two-story [CLICK].  The picture faded from the TV screen after Corey hit the power button on the remote. He picked up his notebook and pen and looked at the clock.  8:38. Im already 38 minutes late, he thought. He spun around for his forgotten keys and slammed the door shut. He paced briskly to his red Subaru. Corey was practically driving as the engine turned. A sound of screeching burned from the tires as he headed to school. His brain was working: Im never going to find a spot. The radio was annoying him, so he channel-surfed. Nothing but commercials.  The seek button searched the stations as Corey drove recklessly through cars. It stopped scanning on the final station on the dial.   "In Harrison, a Vernon College students body was found"  "Shit!"  The red Subaru was inches from striking a BMW fresh from the showroom floor. As his head falls into place on his neck, Corey utters profanity at the inattentive businessman chatting on his cellphone. Corey pounds on the off button on his stereo. The cherry on wheels splits through traffic and Corey hangs a dangerous left into lot #5, slightly beating out a charging pick-up from the opposite direction. The car ends up still in a criss-crossed patch of blacktop next to the real parking spaces.  Its 9:01. Corey performs a Carl Lewis to the Meyer Building for his 8:00. Climbing the stairs in leaps, he stops at room 310. Theres a note. Class Cancelled Due to Universitys Loss. It appears that the entire floor is empty. Doors are locked and lights are missing. Corey heads across campus for Rudd Hall. Halfway across campus, Corey sees Andy, who states gingerly, "Christy and Josie are on their way over."

      I also think Dave Attel is the shiznit.  Have fun Dennis and Matt.  Kim's post confused me momentarily, for I thought she went to Sparta, as in Dennis Sparta.  I thought that was quite a ride to pick up stuff.  Besides, what could Kim have left with Dennis?  a frisbee?  a ballcap?  maybe a lamp?  I don't know, but she got it now, whatever it was.    So I didn't feel like cooking today at around 7pm, my meal time.  I decided to get take-out food of some kind.  However, I decided against Chinese food since I think I order from the local Chinese eatery at least once every 2 weeks, and the last time I ordered I think he (guy always there) recognized my voice.  I always order the same thing, so I got self-conscious about it.  I didn't order there.  I bought some cajun-salsa-wrap instead.  It was fine and I microwaved some peas and corn, as to have vegetable in my meal as well.  I didn't fix school yet, but I did get a 'Lost in Translation' poster with Bill Murray on it, signed by Sofia Coppola.  Good luck with the foot, Bri.  I had something weird like that happen to me, and it took 4 days to get better.  I did it in my sleep somehow, quite painful.    Down with UNC.  (I really have nothing against UNC, but I like to antagonize.)

      HI just finished my 1st week of classes including the dreaded Neurobiology.  I now know the difference between oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells.  Bring on G coupled proteins!  Books were $270, which is a bargain.  In other news, I purchased The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.  Great movie (Im sorry George Lucas but LOTR is better than Star Wars).  The DVD had a making of The Return of the King movie.  They were showing some cool scenes from the movie and then abruptly cut away before all the really good stuff happened.  Kinda like in The Simpsons when Itchy and Scratchy see a fireworks factory and then pass it by because Poochie the Dog joins the hillarity.  Anyway, I think everyone should read these books before they see any LOTR movie because they are great reading.  Finally Matt and I are going to see Dave Attell on Fri nite in Raleigh.  Talk to everyone soon.  On Sat, watch ABC to see the amazing North Carolina Tar Heels battle the criminlas at Florida State.  Go Heels!!

We rejoiced as we walked 10 miles back to our cars at lovely  urlLink Montclair State University .  Go Red Hawks!!  I'm glad its over with.  After class i treked up to Sparta with my brother to pick up some things.  What a house!  His roommate, the guy who owns the place, said he only plans to stay in his mansion for 2 years.  Wha?!?  Must be nice to move from one house to another every 2 years.  Lucky.

      Today I step aside and dedicate this page to  urlLink Brandon .  He's always been supporting my page and songs, and that's something not many people do.  It's nice to hear things about what you like doing a lot(i.e. writing) whether good or bad.  I really respect Brandon's opinions as well because not only is he a writer, but he's always been genuine with his feelings and never hides anything.  So here's to  urlLink Brandon .  I've enjoyed reading his stuff since we began working together at a really bad record store.  Now go check out his awesome works.  Thanks dude.  In other news, my foot cannot be walked on.  I don't know what I did to it, but yesterday after running, eating breakfast and showering, it didn't hurt until I tried walking down the stairs and I became a cripple.  I can't put any weight on it because it hurts so damn much.  I'm not going to the doctor either.  "Well, let's take an x-ray and see...  Hmm, I don't see anything, just give me $200 and take some motrin for any pain."  I may be going to my brother's house on Sunday for a bbq/pool grand opening.  They got their pool installed on Monday, and it should be ready by then, so they're gonna have some people over.  I keep getting visions of a rap video with all these guys in the pool with gold teeth and chains with some dirty girls dancing around the outside.  Bling bling y'all.  No, God I hope not.

It's more like dancing to gospel music.  It's inspiring bee-otch!  What?  I don't know what I'm talking about.  You don't dance to gospel music.  I'm glad to read your words.  Peace out.

      I ran today all by myself.  It was different, but I ran my old running route by my house, and realized there are a lot of hills to run up.  It wasn't very fun.  I'm really tired now.  I don't think I slept well, but I don't know why.  I'm probably gonna look for some crappy part-time work today, so we'll see how that goes.  I wrote two new things, found  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .  They're both pretty short, and I don't know why they're both somewhat mean and spiteful, because I'm not in a bad mood or anything, but whatever.

      Hello.  I think I figured out how to blog.  I hope blogging isn't like dancing to techno music.   I don't know how to do that very well.  Plus I always end up smelling like smoke and have some super-jacked guido dance into me.  It's all very bad.  I don't go to clubs.  Is blogging like 'gellin'?  If it is, I want to be blogging like Magellan.   I just got home from work an hour ago.  I am nearly nocturnal now.  I should write email to my professors trying to set up meetings for school, as in getting me in it.  However, I think i'll listen to music and write tommorrow (maybe).  I've used those mirror kits before.  They are 2 for 2 in my experience.  I hope yours makes it 3 for 3.  Seriously, I haven't listened to any of my classical music for like a year.  It sounds good right now.  Ok.  That's my blog for now.  Lata dawg.

      Hey!  My rearview mirror keeps falling off my windshield.  I went to the store on the weekend, but they didn't have the adhesive in stock.  "Check back Monday or Wednesday," guy says.  I decided to try some cement stuff we had in the house that said it worked on glass and metal, so I glued away and let it dry overnight.  I put my mirror on gently yesterday without tightening it, and this morning, it was laying on the floor, mocking me.  It said, "Ha.  You wretched human. You cannot contain me."   I said, "You're right.  You can just stay on the floor then."   I drove up to the mall without a rearview mirror because I was lazy.  Probably not the smartest idea, but I had to get my dad a birthday gift.  On the way home I stopped at said auto store above, and they had the adhesive kit.  I purchased it and attempted to use it upon my home arrival.  After scraping off the old glue and thoroughly cleansing the button and windshield, I was ready.   Place one drop of adhesive to center of button and hold firmly on windshield for 15 seconds.   I oblige, but upon removing my finger, the button came along with it.  Blast!  So I quickly dripped one more dab of adhesive and placed the button back up quickly.  This time, it stayed.  For now.  I'll let you know what happens when I actually put the mirror on.  I got an email from one of my friends from school who also is trying to be a teacher, and she made me feel better, because she can't find a job either.  She's going to be a sick leave replacement for a month for her cooperating student teacher, but that's over in October.  So I guess everyone I graduated with still doesn't have a permanent job either.  It's about 2:30, so I'm going to watch Family Guy now.  Late.

I'm not going to use Access in my lifetime.  I'll use Powerpoint And Excel but I knew this shizzy before I registered for this class.  oh well. Only 2 days left.

      Yesterday was some good fun.  Went to  urlLink Turtle Back Zoo !  I haven't been there in years, but it was a beautiful day.  The sun was shining, and it was in the lower 80s.  The first thing we visited were my favorites, the penguins.  Coolest animals ever.  They were just chillin', but then they started jumping into their pool and swimming around.  We proceeded around the zoo and met some cattle and elk.  I met a new  urlLink friend .    We saw a wolf in the distance later on, and a bobcat and cougar.  My dad  urlLink fed the goats .  The goats and horses smelled like ass.  What else did we see?  Some happy chickens, outbreak monkeys, and otters.  There's probably a few I missed...It only took about an hour to go through the zoo, and we weren't really rushing either.  It was something different, so it was nice.  I've been itching to go to a zoo for a while now, so I was happy.    I saw a few job postings in the paper yesterday.  One was for a 4th grade teacher in Tenafly.  I really don't know where that is, but I'm trying for it.  The ad was like send in cover letter, resume, copy of certification, and transcripts now!  No, but it said by like Tuesday or something.  Ridiculous.  Hey, I didn't tell you to wait till a week before school starts to post a job.  I woke up to run this morning and it was quite brisk for an August day, but it was good because I didn't sweat too much.  Well, I'm going to look for some crappy part-time work this week, in case I don't have anything solid for the start of September.

      Sparta!  Welcome aboard Den.  I'm glad to read about your mishaps/doings.  I'm sorry your Saturday was wasted, but when you're finally done with grad work, you'll be one happy mofo.  As for madden, that fat bastard...Well, let's just say I agree with you whole-heartedly because I haven't purchased one of his games since I had Genesis, and Madden 96 ended up flying out the window towards my neighbor's house and my control exploded into many pieces.  When you're up on the Chargers 26-0 going into the 2nd half, you would expect to be able to win the game, at least preventing them from scoring 26 unanswered points.  Not the case.  Jeff Blake throws 3 interceptions on 3 pass attempts.  The only reason I was passing was because I couldn't run either, so I tried passing on 3rd and longs.  After having a 12 point lead, I decide to try to run out the clock.  Well, the running back fumbles once and of course the Chargers convert a touchdown in a matter of seconds.  On the next posession, I get a good return on the kickoff, but oh, guess what, I fumbled.  They return it for a TD without getting touched by anyone on my team.  Game ripped out of system while power is still on and thrown out window at my neighbor's house.  Game ends up on my side of the property, without visible physical damage.  I jump on it, try to snap it in half, but it's indestructible.  I go on to puncture it with sharp objects, and place it back into its case.  Thus ending me ever purchasing a madden product again.  And by the way Den, cursing is acceptable.  Just try not to overdo it.  Saying madden is a fat fuck is AOK in my book, and so on.  Thanks for joining dude.

      Hello all, I got an email from Brian to contribute to the blog, which I'll ty to do for the amusement of others of course.  It's Saturday in beautiful Chapel Hill, NC, but I wouldn't know.  I'm just about to finish my 11th hour of work today.  Yes that's right, 11 hours.   This is the horror of graduate school.  Classes resume on Tues and this is supposedly my tough year with Neurobiology, master's thesis and comps (basically like your med school boards).  So much to look forward to!  Anyway, I just got Madden for the Xbox.  I have a love/hate relationship with all Madden games.  There is a lot of good to it, bt there is also bad stuff, which I'll tell you about.  When you are 14-0, the computer will make you fumble or throw many interceptions.   they will also have the most unstoppable offense this.  Apparently Trung Candidate is the 2nd coming of Jim  Brown.  My usual experience will be to enjoy the 1st quarter, get pissed by the 2nd quarter, play well in the third, then quit the gam with disgust by the fourth after Jay Fiedler throws his 6th pick of the game and Madden berates me for making a poor pass.  F*** you Madden! I'm about to finsih up at the lab and go home to enjoy my weekend or what's left of it.  Also, I just finished Jon Krakeur's "Under the Banner of Heaven.  Great book about the Mormons (seeing how f**** up they are) Can I curse on this page Bri.  BTW Krakeur wrote "Into Thin Air" about a failed Everest campaign, another good book!

      I'm driving myself nuts trying to figure out my computer homework.  There is no possible way that I know of to calculate the mean when using excel.  I've checked every possible fuction there is.  Why should I have to do it by hand?  It's fuckin' excel!!!    Anyways, I'm going to see my big brother Joey in Sparta today which is about a half an hour away down the lovely route 80.  Maybe I'll go swimming with the bears.  Maybe I'll meet Fuzzy Wuzzy and see if he really is fuzzy.

      Friday is pizza night.  It's been that way forever pretty much.  I just found out that the new  urlLink No Motiv  cd has been pushed back to 2004.  Why?  So Vagrant can promote dashboard and autumn to asses even more.  Garbage.  Last night, I applied for a job to  urlLink this place .  I saw a posting in my local paper for a 4th grade maternity leave.  It would start in mid-November and go till the end of the year.  I really don't want to be a sub again, but if it's all I can find, what can I do right?    On a sad note, I found that the man who did the voice of Monterey Jack in Chip N Dale's Rescue Rangers passed away on August 11th.  I was saddened by this, because he was indeed my favorite character, and it came as quite a shock.  So I wish his family well.

      Welcome to a heatwave.  It's officially gross for the second consecutive day.  The air is stagnant.  Running this morning made my lungs work extra hard to breathe in more polluted Passaic/Clifton air.  I don't plan on doing much today.  I'll probably Bowflex, practice guitar a bit more, and work on my story more.  My love read what I had so far yesterday and she seemed to like it.  I have to expand more, but she liked the idea.  I'm listening to Nada Surf's  Proximity Effect .  Remember that song "Popular" they had?  Well, it's not on this CD.  I'm still working on my  urlLink bands  page.  I finished up four more pages today, but have quite a lot more to do.  I've gotten to most of my hardcore-liked bands so far, but I still have lyrics to add, which will take a looooooooooong time.  I'm keeping busy at least.   I started reading a new book last night.  It's called  All The Dead Were Strangers .  I am only up to page 30, which is the start of Chapter 2.  Here's what I know so far...There's 2 guys chatting in a bar in NYC.  A is a detective on hiatus for some unknown reason and B is some guy that was in the military, but liked it so much that he left?  So they feel they are being watched/followed.  They decide to leave.  They hail a cab and get dropped off a block from a subway station.  Guy B gets out and says "I'm going to Queens, Fred."  He tried to give false info in case the cab driver was part of the following.  Anyway, they wait for the cab to drive away, then head in the opposite direction to another bar.  Here, Guy B whips out a napkin with 5 names on it.  He asks Guy A to research the names, but doesn't say why.  Guy A obliges.  They go separate ways.  Guy A to Long Island to meet some character named Mickie.  Guy B goes to a hotel, avoids being seen, and sneaks up to a room on the 3rd floor.  It's apparently his room.  He left 3 hairs in the door latch and a trail of baby powder on the floor, in case he's being followed, he would know.  He carefully opens the room door, sees the powder trail untouched, and suddenly gets knocked out.  He wakes up naked and tied to the bed.  There's 2 guys in the room.  One wasn't wearing pants.  They were beating Guy B up to get info about who the guy he was with was, and what the napkin was about.  He gets punched, etc. and tells the guys.  Then pant-less man gets into bed with Guy B and thus ends the chapter.    I have no idea what happened.  What the hell kind of book did I buy?  Good lord!

      It's August 20th, and I am still unemployed, but I'm glad there's over 300 new teachers at an orientation in New York today(as heard on the news).  With my free time, I'm trying to play guitar again.  My fingers hurt.  I'm just starting with the basics-like learning some chords first, and playing some easy parts of weezer and hey mercedes songs so at least i play something that i know how it sounds.  I'm happy, because so far, I've been doing ok.  I have a bad memory, so I'm not rushing, but I practice a few new chords every day, and while I try to remember them, I throw in the ones that I'm already supposed to know.  I'm teaching myself.  It's kind of cool.  I guess I do have a teaching job.    In addition to trying that, I've been messing with my  urlLink webpage  quite a bit.  I don't really change the main page format, but I'm working on the inner pages.  In my  urlLink bands  page, if you click on some of the names, I made my own little page for my favorite bands so far, instead of a lame link to their website.  It's still a work in progress, but it's coming along.    My brother is getting a pool installed on Monday, and having a get-together the Sunday of Labor Day weekend.  So I can drink my face off if I still don't have a job and blame depression, or I can drink my face off if I get a job and blame it on celebration.  Speaking of drinking, the Blue Jays suck.  Right now they're the biggest bunch of sucks that ever sucked.  Hey, can you pitch?  Because I'm sure they'd throw you into their rotation as the #3 starter.  Right behind Troy McClure and Mike Chokesondick.    I'm listening to No Motiv's  Diagram For Healing  right now.  It's one of my favorite CDs that I own.  I haven't heard it in a while, either, so it sounds good.  On a side note,  urlLink Hey Mercedes  are not only a good musical band, but they are quite humorous, as they had a bowling competition while on tour and posted their scores online.  Now who, I ask you would think of doing that?  I'm writing a short story which I will probably post when I'm finished.  It's something that I had a rough idea for in my creative writing class in college, but I'm expanding on it, and trying to detail the characters more, and polish the ending.  As usual, I appreciate feedback, whether positive or negative.

      I know Brian was expecting to hear more from me about Hey Mercedes so here goes....  They played about an even amount of old and new songs.  Since I don't really know the names of the new songs I shall tell you what old songs they played (not in order, my memory isn't that good):   A-List Actress, 11 to Your 7(one of my faves),  Our Weekend Starts on Wednesday(of course), St. James St., and Frowning of a Lifetime.  Of course they played flawlessly.  They're my boys yo!  The new songs sounded most excellent.  Because they are the bestest band around everyone should pick up their new album    Loses Control    on October 7.  In the middle of their set, they got the whole crowd to do a "seventh inning strength" if that's what you would like to call it.  The crowd was totally into hm, especially when they stopped playing and we all sang part of 11 to Your 7.  It sounds cheesy like the 14 year old girls that sing along to the pooping Chris Carabba(sp?).  I think the singing along thing really makes the band feel proud. They realize that they have fans that care enough to memorize lyrics, pay money to see their shows, and then sing along.  If I were on stage I know I would get a complete rush if I saw a bunch of people singing my songs.  Now the people understanding the lyrics is a whole other thing but that's not what music is really about.  Let me stop before I bore everyone with my feelings on music.  Anyways, Hey Mercedes rocks and that's all you need to know.  Now go buy a T-shirt! Linking verbs, linking verbs.

      Well, the preceding weekend was an unusual sunny day on an otherwise overcast two months of summer.  Friday I was able to spend some time with my dad because he wasn't able to work from this blackout I've been hearing about.  On Saturday, I went to see my grandmother and my parents, her, my aunt, and I went to dinner for her 91st birthday, which is actually today.  When I got home, there was a long box on my front steps from  urlLink Vagrant Records .  I opened it to find an autographed tour poster from my boys  urlLink Face to Face .  I guess I won a contest that Vagrant had.  I hadn't heard from them, except for the poster.  Nice.  Now I have to get a frame for it!  Then at night, I saw my honey and we watched the finale of  Shark Week .  Yesterday was fun.  We went to see our heroes known as  urlLink Hey Mercedes  at Maxwell's.  The show was awesome.  They played many a new song, which sounded smooth, and make me anxious for the new album.  October!  I also enjoyed the sounds of one of the opening bands called  urlLink  Damone .  They even threw in a Weezer cover into their set, and they were rockin' out.  As for HM, tight as always and nice guys, too.  I'll let Kim tell more about their side when she gets home later.   So that was my weekend.  It was a nice little relief from the boring days of summer I had been experiencing.

      Hey Mercedes Rocks!!!!  Went to see the boys last night at Maxwell's in Hoboken.  The opening bands were pretty good for once.  I especially liked Damone.  As Brian said they all look like they should be in Slayer.  They had girl singer and that rocks.  Especially since she was good.  Hey Mercedes kicked ass as always.  I talked to Bob and Damon.  Bob is such a sweetheart!    I got out of class today after taking a 10 minute test.  Now I have plenty of time to do nothing before I head off to work.  Yuck!

      You should hear the next and last homework assignment of 2 for the whole course.  Here goes...  Type a cover letter, resume, and print an envelope.  Easy right?  But here's the catch he wants you to use like 5 different fonts, do all sorts of crazy things to the margins, create our own bullet points, and all this by Wednesday.  Oh no!!!  Anyone have a sarcasm machine?

      I need to vent a little so here goes....  I'm taking this horrible summer class at the wonderful Montclair State University.  It's an intro to computers class and it's cake.  You would think I would be jumping for joy but I'm not.   The class is waaaayyyy too easy.  The professor is from Ghana and he has the worst accent ever and the plate in his lip doesn't make it any easier to understand him.  Just kidding!  There's one girl in the class who constantly yells at him.  She says that he ignores her and he's not a real teacher etc.  It's so funny because during the labs everyone is talking and joking around but when she starts yelling at him everyone gets really quiet and stares at the monitor.  Too funny!  But the class ticks me off because i have to be there everyday watching half of the class fall asleep on their keyboards.  And today the fire alrms went off around 8:55, 5 minutes before class started.  So the class treked outside still waiting for our professor.  I see him walk by around 9:20 and he goes to the student center.  Wha?  His class is sitting outside and he doesn't even ask what's going on?  How considerate of him.  So we go back in 20 minutes later and we have class.  Why?  We already missed nearly an hour of class time?  Why freakin bother?  Becasue he's a poopface.  So he lectures for 35 minutes and tells us to do 2 labs which is quite stupid because all we had to do was type 2 letters.  Here's the catch he already had them typed!  All you had to do was copy and paste.  How stupid is this guy?!?  Oh well.  I shouldn't complain.  It's an easy A, right?

      Well, my day-by-day trip blog is complete.  You can only experience our trip if you were there, but I'm sure my sarcasm may have given you some hints as to our fun.  I wrote two new songs.   urlLink This one  is dark and evil, while  urlLink the other one  is about a harsh break up.  The first song is called "Herself" and the second is titled "Disdain."  I hope you like them, and if you don't,  urlLink tell me .  Actually, I would appreciate it if you told me if they were good or bad.    I attempted to fix up my homepage, but geocities yelled at me.  I had copied and pasted my page onto wordpad while I attempted to fix up my page, but somehow they knew I did this, and it's apparently a violation of their terms of service.  So I stopped, closed wordpad, and re-signed in, and all was well, except my page is not too different, except for my entrance page.  I put up a new picture.    Today I grabbed lunch with my friend  Matt .  I haven't seen him in about a year maybe.  He's going to Duke right now to complet his grad school work.  He'll be finished with everything in May.  Damn right.    That's pretty much it.  Just felt I had to blog since I've been doing it on a daily basis for the past week.  Late.

      Day 7  07.26.2003  Saturday  Today is our final day here.  Our flight checks out at 12:48.  We wake up semi-early, because we want to get to the airport early.  We pack up, and I check out of the hotel.  I find that a local call was priced at $4.  Wow, that's economical.  My phone bill was $40.  We leave and go to Dunkin' Donuts for a breakfast sandwich, and a muffin for later.    We finish and begin following signs for Myrtle Beach International Airport.  It's actually quite easy to get to, at least compared to Newark.  We follow signs for Car Rental Returns and drop off the car in the lot.  The guy initials my paperwork, and I go inside to get my receipt.  Wow.  That's a long line, and I just have to drop off.  This sucks.  The line moves very slowly because everyone in front of us is picking up a car.  We move about halfway thru the line, when one of the girls at the desk says, "Is anyone returning?"  Yes.  That takes care of that wait.  It's now 10:50 or so.    We zip down to  urlLink Continental  to check in our luggage and get our boarding passes.  This part was cool because they have a touch-screen computer to check in.  And there was no line here.  The guy checks our bag and the computer spits out our boarding passes.  Now we find the security check-in.  There is only one line, and it wraps around quite a while.  So more waiting, and I get antsy because this could take a while.  Luckily, the line moves at a decent pace.  Same routine as Newark-shoes off, etc.  We're through and have to find Gate 2.  That's funny because there are only 5 gates at this airport, as opposed to the hundreds at Newark.  Easy.  We spot it, and sit down.  It starts raining harder.  We do not want to be stranded here.  Just get our plane here and let us leave.  While we wait, I head to the gift shop to kill some time.  Our plane arrived a few minutes late, but not much.  We just had to wait a little for them to refuel and check everything.  We began boarding at about the scheduled time, and take off on time as well.    Once we got to a higher altitude, the flight was pretty bumpy.  There was a lot of wind.  The plane shook one time that made me stop breathing for a moment.  We were watching a reel of George Lopez and news on their monitors, and after this one pocket of turbulence, the plane shook pretty roughly, and the lights dimmed and the monitors went back up and shut off.  Then everything was ok again.  We continued to hit a few bumps.  When we were nearing our home, the plane insisted on dipping up and down, and turning on its side a lot.  This was making me anxious, because I just wanted to land already.  I would look out the window, and he'd be ascending again.  Dammit man, just land already.  The pilot's interest in roller coaster caused a passenger behind us to vomit on herself.  We finally landed very roughly and got the hell off the plane.    We strolled through the airport to find our ride and our baggage.  We got home around 3 or so.  Happy for now, but knowing I'll soon be bored of being home.

      I noticed something very odd as I read Bri's blog - there is an ad for the Radisson Myrtle Beach on top of the page.  Very weird.... Soooooo, Bri reminded me of the sludge in the parking lot at the water park and it made me think.  The first thing that came to mind was X-Files.  If anyone is a fan of the show you will remember various people oozing black liquid from their eyes which was some sort of alien thingy.  Well that's what the sludge was like and it splashed up on my legs.  Uh oh.  Will my nose start bleeding like Scully's?  Will I become pregnant with an alien?  Was the sex good?  I guess not cuz I don't remember.  Just kidding!!!

      Day 6  07.25.2003  Friday  Today is our last full day in Myrtle Beach, so is that bad or good?  It sucks balls down here, but I don't want to go home and be bored again and alone while my girlfriend works during the day.  Such a conundrum...  Since today is supposed to be partly sunny in the am, with thunderstorms later, we want to hit the water park, called Myrtle Waves.  So we prepare by lotioning and gather our towels, sandals, and money.  We drive there and get into line to pay.  The prices are rather hefty it seems.  Suddenly my love says she doesn't really want to be here because she got one of those feelings.  So I don't mind.  It's more money in my pocket, and we can still go to the beach, since we're already lotioned.  As we trek back to our car, we step in a puddle of sludge.  It wasn't just a puddle from the rainstorm the night before, because it felt slimy.  Disgusting.  We make it back to the hotel and go to the beach, which was very crowded, probably because it was Friday and almost noon.  We stake out a spot and sit there for a while and read our books.  We try the water since I begin to sweat from the humidity.  The surf is still a bit rough, but not as bad as yesterday.  We don't go in too far, just up to our waists, and still get pounded by waves.  After a while, I get tired of holding my suit on because the waves were ripping it off every time I got hit.  The thing was tied in a knot, but the water was strong.  We go back to our spot for a while, and decide to leave to get some lunch.  Besides, it was cloudy and looked like rain.  We cleaned off and tried this place I had spotted on one of our journeys called the River City Grill.  We walked in and there were peanut shells all over the floor and license plates hanging from the wall.  It felt like some weird prison movie.  But alas, we seat ourselves and order.  The food is actually really tasty, and the peanuts were pretty good too.  After lunch, the rain was still holding off, so we want to try some mini golf again.   We drive down King's Highway and find Hawaiian Cavern golf.  It was pretty empty.  We paid and played.  The course was really nice.  There was a sign that said the course is the site of the US Open of mini golf annually.  There was one hole that led out into their man-made lake, and a fountain sprayed mist onto you.  Refreshing.  The path of the course took you up a mountain, which allowed you to see over the horizon, which was actually blocked by all of the hotels anyway, but nice nontheless.  We went back to our room to dry our towels because they probably would not dry by tomorrow morning.  Unfortunately, we did not have enough quarters for the dryer.  I asked the front desk for change of a dollar and they acted like I was asking them to build the pyramids of Egypt.  While we waited for the cycle to finish, we had a drink, which ended up in part on the awning of the gift shop below.  When the drying was finished, it was time to leave for the conclusion of our trip.    I had made reservations the night before thanks to Kim for an 8:30 show at  urlLink Medieval Times .  We were told the doors open at 7.  We arrived a little before 7:30 with a little trouble finding the place, but we did manage.  We get the black & white knight.  All right.  Now we have to wait for an hour to get in, and I'm already getting hungry.  I had never been to one of these places, so I was a bit pessimistic and not expecting it to be much.  We finally begin entering the arena at 8:45.  We find our seats and sit next to 2 southern girls who warn us they are going to be obnoxious and scream a lot.  Actually, it sounded like home, so we were happy, and actually joined them.  Anyway, the food was incredible and abundant, and the show was really fun.  Our knight actually won the competitions, but this one knight who has kind of like an assistant to the King betrayed the king and slayed our knight instead of honoring him.  Bastard.  He died anyway, so just as well.    So our night ended happily, as did the week, but we still have to leave tomorrow, so I'm sure something will go wrong.  Our flight leaves at 12:48 for now, but there's a tropical depression brewing right to the south of us, making it's way from Georgia.  Joy.

      Day 5  07.24.2003  Thursday  I am eager to hit the beach early today because it's supposed to rain later today and tomorrow.  We leave Saturday.  We wake up relatively early and get ready for the beach(i.e. lotion).  We actually find a nice spot, and there is some sun today, but there are dark clouds looming.  We sit around for a bit, but don't actually get in the water because the surf is rough from the storm.  We hear rolls of thunder, but decide not to pack it in just yet, because it's off in the distance.  We leave a while later, clean off, and I go over to Subway for some lunch and bring it back to the room.  It rains.  We let the rain wear out for a while and decide to finally try some mini golf.  We check out Captain Hook's.  It is themed from the Peter Pan movie.  There aren't too many people playing, which is good, because it looks like it's going to rain again.  We had a pretty good time playing, and decide to try the Outback Steakhouse again for dinner.  We pull in and see a line, but we said we would wait tonight.  I go around back, but there is nowhere to park, so we leave and travel a bit further down the road to a place called the Atlantic Grille.    I run in through the rain to see if there's a dress code.  They say no, so we're in.  The place is not crowded, and it looks very nice.  We ended up having a really nice dinner, so we didn't wait in the rain for the Outback anyway.  We couldn't play any more mini golf since it continued raining, so we went back to the hotel to try and find its advertised "lazy river."    We get changed and find it rather easily, and it contains only a boy floating around with his mother sitting in a chair alongside.  We try the pool outside instead, but it's too cold.  We go back to the river.  Great, we each grab a tube, and sit our lazy asses in and proceed around the river without having to strain ourselves.  Minutes later, another girl and guy enter.  Fine.  They were nice and minded their own business.  About 20 minutes later, a father and his 2 young boys run in all loud and jump into the river, without a tube.  The boys decide to swim between us as we float, and the stupid father insists on floating up our asses.  How very rude and inconsiderate we felt.  We stayed only a few more minutes and then left in a bad mood.  We went back up to our room and changed again and settled in for the night.  Tomorrow is our last day.  We plan on trying the water park, because it's supposed to rain later in the day, but not early on.  We'll see what happens.

      Sorry for the delay.  I was at my brother's house helping install a new fence in their backyard for the last 2 days...  Day 4 07.23.2003  We start our day the same as yesterday, that is, eating cheerios.  We decide to peruse the hundred or so factory outlet stores a little bit up Highway 501.  We walk around a bit, disinterested in most of the stores.  I happened to see a music store as we were searching for a Tommy store for women.  I went in to see if (ha ha) they had the new 311 cd.  Wow!  They actually did, and I picked it up and realized their tax is less than New Jersey's on cds.  We continue walking and stop in our original destination to find nothing.  We continue on to the Nike store, which was probably the busiest store there.  We proceeded to the snacky stand to buy a pretzel to hold our appetites until lunch, which we were looking forward to.  We consumed our treats and entered the Big Dog store, where I purchased my dad a T-shirt.  We began making our exit walk from the outlets, but stop in an Aeropostale, which had select good prices on mostly stuff people wouldn't buy.  We also stopped in Nautica and Docker's to find ugly clothing, and crappy prices, respectively.  We leave and want to eat lunch.  We want to hit up Captain George's, which is a seafood buffet.  We drive over and pull in the back parking lot, noticing it's rather empty.  We walk around looking for a back entrance, only to find a few stairs that lead to a wall.  We turn and walk around to the front, where we discover that they open at 3.  It's 2 now.   Motherf...  Since we are right across the street from  Broadway at the Beach ,  and we're hungry, we go there to find food.    We park and find the info map.  I see two places, a Japanese steak house, and Joe's Crab Shack, which both appear to be behind the Hard Rock Cafe, just over a bridge.  Well, there was no bridge behind the Hard Rock Cafe, so we walked very briskly to the other side of this place.  We go past Joe's, because it looked like a place where only white trash is welcomed.  We walk a bit further and find out, hey, this steak house doesn't open until 4.  OK, let's try Joe's since we're hungry.  We go back and enter to find a line with a wait, and no ac.  Motherf...We continue back to the other side of the park, where we started and become very sticky in the process because the humidity is near 100%.  Disgusted, we get in our car to drive away.  We end up going back down Highway 17, but I forgot that there's nowhere to eat really on 17, so we drive a while before I can find a u-turn.  When we do, we turn around and I drive to the first place I could think of.  Fuddrucker's is always open during the day for lunch.  We arrive and there is room to sit, and we eat lunch around 3:30 or so.  We drive back to the hotel a while later and notice the sky is black behind us.  Click.  I take a picture.  We go to our room to chill and digest our disgusting lunch.    Tonight we are going to see some baseball.  Oh wait, no we're not.  It starts raining and getting very windy.  We decide we should cleanse our nastiness because we got really sweaty from our walk around Broadway.  When I got out of the shower, I turned on the weather forecast to find that we had a Tornado Warning.  Oh great.  It was around 6.  A tornado had hit maybe 10 miles to the north of us, and the cell extended to the south of us.  Great.  A tornado and we're in a high-rise with windows everywhere.  Luckily, the tornado warning expires without damage to us, but it continues to downpour.  I call the Pelicans ticket office to see if the game was still on, because my tix were purchased online.  The guy said, well, it may not start on time, but we're still going to play.  Huh?  Anyway, it continued to rain thru 8:30, so I don't think they got the game in at all.  When we were finally ready, we started getting hungry, so we tried to go to Captain George's again.   When we pulled in, there were not many spots, and there was a cluster of people outside waiting.  I ran in to see what the wait was, but the hostess said none for 2 people.  Nice.  I ran back to the car, got Kim and we were going to eat.  This place was awesome inside.  It was decorated with models of ships and fish, and the ceiling had a deep blue color with stars on it.   We made our way to the buffet to eat crab legs, some seafood medley, deviled crab, and something else.  Devoured.  Back for round 2, where we had some scallops, shrimp, some fish fillet, potatoes, rice, and a corn muffin.  Also devoured, but with fullness setting in.  We go back to browse the dessert table and pick up some fruit, pudding, cookies, and apple cobbler.  This was a good meal.  Expensive, but worthy.  I just wish I could have eaten more.  It was late, so we just went back to the room afterwards.  I wanted to not sleep in tomorrow to get to the beach before it rained, since we only had 2 more days left and it was supposed to rain both days.

      Since Brian is away for the day, I would attempt to give you the details of our fourth day of vacation but my memory is shot.  Probably because I don't want to remember a lot of what happened.  Wow.. I just made vacation sound really bad which it wasn't.  It was good, bad, and full of ugly weather and people.  I guess they can't help it that they're so beastly looking.  I blame the parents who beat them with the ugly stick.  My theory is as follows:  The parents themselves are hideous beings.  When they learn that they are having a child they are afraid the child will turn out to beautiful (in the case of reproduction 2 uglies make a pretty).  So then the parents then make the decision to purchase an ugly stick so the child will live a hard knock life.  What?  I'm so mean.  I'll stop now....  I'm listening to the new Cursive cd which is quite good.  I have never heard anyone use a cello as a key instrument in an "emo" song.  It makes for some unusual yet pleasurable listening.  And the best part is that it sounds different from the other stuff I've been listening to.  I've actually been listening to music I never thought I would lately, straying away from my usual Hey Mercedes, Jimmy Eat World, Saves the Day, etc.  Change is good I guess.  Among these different cds are The New Pornographers, The Notwist, and Via Tania.  Very interesting stuff that Notwist.

      I had my Neurobiology presentation on Wednesday and rocked it.  So I'm very happy it is over with.  I booked my flight to New Orleans for Neuroscienec conferenc.  I have a 2 hr layover in Houston which sucks, but I'll be on Bourbon Street by 10 on Friday.  Our hotel used to be a "historic bordello", which should make things interesting.  This weekend we will be celebrating my friend Alex's birthday somewhere in Chapel Hill.  I noticed that the new Limp Bizkit CD is out and I was wondering to myself why these guys still have a record contract.  They are the suckiest sucks who ever did suck.  In other sports news, the Dolphins have a bye this week, but I will be at the Giants-Dolphin game next weekend in NJ. Hopefully they can carry the momentum till then. Rutgers is looking to go 3-1 this weekend if they beat Navy and equal their win total from the past two years.  On Sat, Carolina is going up to NC State and will probably get their asses kicked. At least basketball season will be here shortly and Carolina should be a top ten team.  Congrats to the New York Yankees- 6 straight division championships!!! and Brian for finishing the GRE's.  Also, happy belated birthday to Kim. Have a good weekend everyone!!

      Well, the GRE is done.  Who knows what will happen next?  The only thing I know is that, based on my practice and on the real thing, I probably should have gone into the math field.  Not gonna happen now.  I'm glad it's over.  I'm going to lunch with  Kim  as per our usual Thursday event.  I'm starving, and tonite I'll probably have a drink or two to fry the brain cells that are storing any analogy information.  I'm just about finished with my  urlLink bands  page, in which you'll be able to click on any band name listed there and find a bio and discography.  It may not sound like a lot, but it was a lot of work.  So feel free to check it out if you want to know about some of the music I like.    Hey, how about those  urlLink Jays  finishing up on a strong note?  They will finish above .500 for the season, which is something to start with for next season, after adding some pitching.  As for the Bengals, I predict they will win outright this Sunday.  No point spread, just win.  As for the Cuse, well they'll lose to Toledo by 14.  I may post more tonite since I'll probably be bored.  Maybe I'll be inebriated when I blog for the first time.

      Listening to the  Blue Album .  Brings back memories of, well, I don't know, but it's one of my favorite cds.  I just submitted my app to grad school online, only to find out I still have to write yet another essay for a scholarship.  That will not be completed until after I find out whether I'm accepted into the school or not.  It's due by May 1st, so I have time.    Last night, I took  Kim   urlLink here  for her bday dinner.  It was pretty good, but there was hardly anyone there besides us.    SATURNINE:  A) magnanimous B) ebullient C) finicky D) unnatural E) impoverished  Sorry, but all this studying is making me crazy.  On my final practice test, I did not do very well on the verbal, but quite well on quantitative.  Pretty strange for one who enjoys writing.  The part I thought would be the easiest turned out to be the worst.  There's a part where you fill in two blanks in a sentence using context, and just about every one has two close answers according to the book, and I picked the one that wasn't the best fit for every answer.  I did well on the antonyms and reading, with some trouble on analogies.  The math surprised me.  I was happy I did well, though.  I took my time and it paid off, making sure I checked all possibilities, like the book said.  So today, I will study some more-brush up on the math formulas once more, and look over some word roots.  Tomorrow equals rest and no studying.  Here's to the  urlLink Seattle Seahawks  for being 3-0, and so far, living up to my  surprise team  label in my scholarly NFL predictions.

      Happy Birthday,  Kim !  I've written you a bunch of songs in the past, but the following song seems as personal as a song I could have written for you today.  So here's the lyrics, since I don't think you'd want me to sing them:   The Luckiest   lyrics by Ben Folds   i don't get many things right the first time in fact, i am told that a lot now i know all the wrong turns, the stumbles and falls brought me here and where was i before the day that i first saw your lovely face now i see it everyday and i know that i am, i am i am the luckiest what if i'd been born fifty years before you in a house on the street where you live maybe i'd be outside as you passed on your bike would i know? in a wide sea of eyes see one pair that i recognize and i know that i am, i am i am the luckiest love you more than i have ever found a way to say to you next door there's an old man who lived into his nineties and one day passed away in his sleep and his wife, she stayed for a couple of days and passed away i'm sorry i know that's a  strange way to tell you that i know  we belong that i know that i am, i am i am the luckiest

      For those who were worried, I did not get wiped away with the hurricane, the only problem we had was a loss of power for a couple hours Thursday afternoon.  I would have to say it was a good weekend, won $15 playing poker with some friends/classmates Friday night (sorry I didn't see your blog earlier in the week Dennis), Ohio State won, and more importantly, Michigan lost.  Oh yeah, I also went to see two pillars of college gridiron tradition, Duke and Northwestern, battle it out to see just who sucks more, and it turns out, Duke does. I've seen them a couple times and they've never looked good, but they looked exceptionally bad on Saturday. I was able to catch American Splendor last week and enjoyed it a lot, and while there saw the trailer for Lost in Translation. I'm automatically sold on any Bill Murray project, so they can count on my movie dollars when it eventually gets released in NC, probably sometime in Fall 2004. I've decided to stop doing very much work for school, I've done nothing but PT related stuff for two years, so it's time to collect my debt. I've read a lot more, and just finished Requiem for A Dream by Hubert Selby, Jr (thanks to Isabel), as per usual, as good as the movie is, the book is much better. Well, there is some reading to do for class tomorrow, so I should get on that. Ending blog transmission.

      Hello everyone!  Last night me and Brian went to the  urlLink Stress Factory  in New Brunswick.  We saw the very funny  urlLink Ted Alexandro .   We've seen him on Comedy Central a few times and he was great so when Brian read that he was going to be nearby he decided to take me for my birthday.  The guy hosting the show was really funny as was the girl that went on before Ted.  All in all it was a great night.  Well except for when we kinda got lost.  That was the first time AAA directions let us down.  Thank god we had directions off the Stress Factory's site.  I also didn't like the 2 drink minimum rule.  Since I'm still not 21 I had to order 2 waters.  I understand that they need to make money but I don't think 2 waters will net them much profit.  Oh well.  I fun anyways and that's all that counts.  Hooray for the Puke Fairy!!!

      Afternoon all.  Time for me to review the movie I saw last nite.  The  urlLink girlfriend  and I went to see  urlLink Thirteen  last nite.  Well, the evening started with the nu-metal ticket kid telling Meredith that  urlLink American Splendor  was a much better movie.  He gave this recommendation because he saw that she was wearing her NIN shirt...  We decided to see the movie anyway.  The movie was co-written by one of the 17 year old stars and the movie's director.  It was the writing, acting and directing debut for both.  And I was thoroughly impressed.  Yes, the movie has some raw spots, but for the most part it seems very true to life (or at least thats what I was told by my girlfriend, since I was never a teenage female, its tough for me to relate).  My only complaint is that the movie should be called  Sixteen  or  Seventeen .  While the characters of the movie are supposed to be in the 7th grade, I highly doubt that the situations that occur in the movie would ever happen to a 13 year old.  It seems more realistic for the girls to be a few years older.  But if you go into it with that "willful suspension of disbelief" thing, then you should enjoy this movie.  I also recommend going to see it with a member of the female persuasion.  This is a definitely "chick flick", but not the true sense of the genre; but will earn you some points with said female.  And you should enjoy the movie to boot...  Well, its time to watch the Yankees on YES and wait for tomorrow's football games...

      Hello everyone, I'm stuck at work until midnite running an experiment so I 'm bored and decided to write another blog, so soon after my last post.  After this night I'll feel like Lemmywinks the Gerbil King (guess the reference and win!!!).  Anyway, my Neurobiology class sucks big time.  There's about 80 pages of reading per day, plus weekly presentation where we get our asses reamed by professors assuming we know as much as them even though they've been in the profession for 30 years or so.  Carolina is going to get killed by Wisconsin this weekend in football, but at least the Yankees are going to win the AL East and squash the pathetic Red Sox.  In other news, I'm about to finish another one of Stpehen King's Dark Tower books. (Book III The Wastelands)  The books are pretty good although a lot of weird stuff happens.  Tomorrow night, I'm hitting up the Chapel Hill bar scene (Matt, call me if you want to join).  Hope everyone survived the hurricane.  Kev- maybe you need some more pieces of flair to help your review.   Later, Dennis

      What you need is motivation.  About those TPS reports, did ya get the memo? Sorry, those were moments from  urlLink Office Space .   I'm sorry about your shitty company, Kev.  Have any job openings?  I added some more links on the left.  Nothing you probably haven't seen before, just stuff that's been blogged about before.  I was bored and needed a break from studying.    I'm listening to this band  Camden  right now.  They're very mellow, almost like my boys,  urlLink The Appleseed Cast , but not quite as good.    I strolled around my hood to investigate any damage from that whirling bitch, and not much.  But that hurricane didn't do much damage either.  The only thing I noticed was someone's gutter bent into a "u" shape around their front porch post.  Lots of leaves and twigs, but nothing to get worked up about.    Well, folks, it's pizza nite.  Enjoy the weekend.

      OK, I need to vent a little, so feel free to bypass the next paragraph...  I have zero repsect for my bosses.  They were doing our "reviews" this week and I just got out of mine.  What a friggin' crock of sh!t.  First of all, this wasnt even our offical review, all we did was review our "personal objectives", our real reviews arent until December.  They did tell me what percentage raise I am getting this year, which was more horsesh!t.  I am getting a 3% raise, which is average for my entire group.  What pisses me off more is that these raise figures were set back in February, when our program didnt kick into high gear until April.  So, that means that all the work I did this summer will be forgotten by the time they set the next budget for raises.  They told me that my hard work didnt go unnoticed, but of course I wont be compensated for it.  This company is a friggin' joke.  I also have a strong feeling that the other two people who do the same job as me got higher percentage raises; and I know that I do much higher quality work than they do.  F this company...  All done.  Now back to your regularly scheduled blog...

      Evening all.  I just got back from "Wing Nite", so I am full of spicy bits of chicken and cheap beer.  We decided to sit outside in bask in the pre-hurricane festivities.  It was a rather enjoyable nite, albeit a tad windy...  I guess I am the only person who wasnt overly thrilled with  Pirates of the Caribbean .  I thought it was "ok", but nothing special.  I would like to see  Lost in Translation , but it is only playing at two theatres in CT, one that is 30 mins from me and another that is 40 mins.  Maybe I'll go see it tomorrow nite anyways.  The  urlLink girlfriend  has wanted to see  Thirteen  for some time now,  so I think I may be seeing that tomorrow nite instead.    The last book I read was  Lullaby  by  urlLink Chuck Palahniuk .  I thought it was really good (but not as good as anyway of his other books).  It took me less than two days to read, which is saying a lot coming from me.  I really couldnt put it down.  And for those of you dont know who Chuck is, he wrote the novel  Fight Club .  Well, hopefully Dennis and Matt stay safe and Isabel leaves the rest of us alone.

      Hello all!  I just got home not too long ago from class and it sucks outside.  It's way windy and pouring on some streets and not raining on others.  I went through five periods of rain/no rain during a 10-15 minute drive.  My car actually got blown around a little on the way home too...  The wind is blowing my blinds all around.  I must agree with Bri about the eerie feeling.  Very weird.  Isabel sucks, but not for the obvious reason of rain and wind.  I still have school!!  We are in a state of emergency and the stupid university decides to keep classes in session.  MSU never closes.  There could be 2 feet of snow on the ground covered by 6 inches of ice and they'll expect us to go to class.  Absolutely insane..  As far as movies are concerned, I saw the pirate movie with Bri not only because Johnny Depp was in it but because it was a fun movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I don't believe we've gone to see anything else because all the movies that have been released hork major ass!    I hope our fellow bloggers and friends are doing okay in Carolina.

      Rob I second Brian's satement on your wallet.  250 is like a month's pay for me here.  As I'm writing this, I hear 50 MPH winds gusting outside.  Luckily the hurricane has passed through Chapel Hill.  No damage to my place, but we did get a day off from work.  The coast did get hit pretty bad though.  Brian-I used the Princeton Review GRE book and it helped me somewhat.  Also, register like 2 months before, if you plan on going to the Verona testing center.  When I went on interviews, they really didn't dwell on the GREs too, so I don't think its critical you get a great score.  There seems to be movie theme here so I'll throw in my 2 cents.  Pirates-very good.  Lost in Translation-good.  Once upon a time in Mexico-haven't seen it, but I heard Johnny Depp is good in it.  BTW October 21-Indiana Jones on DVD- finally myortie movies on DVD.  I gotta read for my class tomorrow.  Talk to you later  Dennis

      Just got back from lunch with  Kim .  She had a break after her morning classes and before her night class.  Rob, I'm sorry to hear about your wallet.  That sucks horribly.  Thanks for the advice on the practice tests.  I am taking some practice tests in the book I purchased, and they are difficult, but hopefully, my brain will expand the more I study, and take in what I'm getting wrong.  As far as the movies, I've only seen  Pirates  thus far, but didn't plan on seeing  Jeepers  or  Dickie  anytime soon.  I would definitely recommend my first mentioned as well.  Yarr.    Good news is that the advisor from MSU mailed me back and gave me news I wanted to hear.  I also got a response from my fave professor from WP, and he is willing to give me a recommendation.  Nice.  I'm thinking about Den & Matt right now in NC and hoping things are OK...  I finished a very good  urlLink book  last night.  I highly recommend it if you want to read a good thriller.  I don't read many horror works, but this one gave me the creeps at times.  Probably the fastest I've ever read a book.  I think I read it in 3 days.  I had mentioned a book before in this  urlLink blog  about a month ago, which was the book I read before the above mentioned.  It royally sucked, and I still don't understand the beginning that I blogged about.    I put a new welcome picture on my site.  The link's on the left.  Other than that, not much else is new.  I haven't written any new songs, but I'm working on an idea for a short story.  As I type, the wind is whirling thru the vent in my ac.  I don't know, when I was outside, it just feels erie.  Yeah, it's windy, but it feels like there's some supernatural power.  There's a tingling on my skin and my hands felt sweaty.  Weird.  I'm going to  urlLink eat  now.  Bye.

      Hola everyone.    What can I tell you all?   Well, I went to CT on Friday to play poker etc.  On the way back to Boston on Saturday, I left my wallet in the bus station in Springfield.  That was great.  I also happened to have $250 in my wallet for no real reason other than it was my 'gambling money'.  Not suprisingly, my credit card company was alot more accomodating in sending me a new card than my bank was.  However, I did have no cash or ID until Tuesday either way.  My large advice in life is don't lose your wallet, cause its a pain.     I figure I can give you all movie news as well.  My theater happened to have  urlLink Lost in Translation  starting last Firday as part of its limited release.  I saw it and thought it was quite good.  There's a lot of critical hype about the movie, but I think its somewhat deserved.  Bill Murray is simultaneously quite funny and believable in a role that must have been created for him.  That and Scarlett Johansson is hot.  These two insomniac Americans meet in Japan in a hotel and become friendly.  Anyhow, I recommend it fairly highly a its much better than anything that came out this summer.  Other movies that are perhaps worth seeing include  urlLink Matchstick Men  (it's a con movie, if you like con movies, its worth seeing),  urlLink American Splendor    (it's a non-super hero comic book movie, if you like non-super hero comic book movies, its worth seeing), and  urlLink Pirates of the Caribbean  (it's a pirate movie, if you like pirate movies, its worth seeing).  However, I was forced to 'hide' last week when the regional manager was in the building as an effort to make it look like we need more budgeted payroll (absurd), and I happened to try to watch Jeepers Creepers 2 and Dickie Roberts, but I wanted to vomit immediately upon seeing scenes from both.  So bad, words can't describe.  Word on the street is that Once Upon a Time in Mexico also blew, though I haven't seen it.   Ummm..... yeah that's my movie story.    Oh, my story wasn't published in that paper of course, it was the last thing cut adn they wanted me to write something this week, but I didn't have time and my power went out on Sunday to boot.  Speaking of booting, Jeremy Shockey makes me want to boot.  What an idiot piece of crap.  There's no particular reason for that comment other than I'm quite sick of all his media attention for such a non-great player.  BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBoooooooooooooooorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnngggggggggg.  I recommend taking practice tests a few times before the real GRE.  They helped me.  Alright, I'm off to play Madden now, Blog out.

      Dude, the GRE is making me crazy.  I got one of those practice books yesterday to aid in my studies/practice, but man, it just made me more worried.  Some of the words are absolutely ridiculous.  So I've got a lot of work to do before next Thursday.  I read and studied a lot last night, but my brain is fried so far today, and I can't really concentrate well.    I emailed the advisor at  urlLink Montclair State  and asked him some questions I had about grad school.  Hopefully he'll reply with things I want to hear.  My plan if I'm accepted into the school is to pursue  Communication Arts, which could entail either Public Relations or Speech Communication.  I'm hoping that upon completion, I may be able to teach either high school communication classes or college courses.  If not, then I may continue with this education fiasco and pursue a doctorate.  Yeah.   You  can call me doctor, bitch.  Well, first I have to actually get into the school.  So I'm just hoping to pass this test first.   Everyone say hi to  Kev .  I was just asking about him not too long ago, when I was listening to an Everclear cd.  He was my everclear buddy in high school.  The band, not the alcohol.  Welcome!

      Hey everyone, Back from Columbus, Ohio.  Man, what a crazy weekend.  After a 9 hr drive (damm Virginia cops!), we made it to Ohio.  Went to downtown Columbus, right by where the Blue Jackets play.  After some good old Irish ales, we made fun fun of some NC State fans and went home to rest for the big game.  Approximately 8:45 in the morning, we wake up and begin our nutritious breakfast of Bud Light and Bratwurst.  After tailgating for a few hours, we enter the game along with some airplane bottles of vodka.  Fast forward, OSU is winning 24-7, when all hell breaks loose.  NC State comes back and ties the game.  After 3 OT, OSU prevails 44-38.  What a game.  We then precede to drink more after the game until my liver starts to hurt and we go home.  Sunday we drive back to Chapel Hill.  All in all a fun weekend.  Next travelogue will be from New Orleans in November for the Neuroscience Conference.  Free trip, no girlfrined to bring along (I told Khris she can't come),  hotel on Bourbon St, no open container laws, what a city!!! Well I'm about to brace for the hurricane.  Talk to y'all later Dennis   BTW I like the Family Guy quite so here's one of my faves "Guns don't kill people, minorities with guns do" from the NRA episode

      I think I'm starting to get sick.  My throat is bothering me and that's usually my first symptom of illness.  Everyone at work is sick.  I think it all started downstairs on the teller line and it spread from one girl to 5 and then the girl in my department is sick.  I think it's like the movie Outbreak where the mutaba virus spread thorugh the hospital via the vents.  I seriously doubt that there's a cut little monkey, or an evil one for that matter, crawling around the bank.  "Who's going to protect me from the evil monkey in my closet?" (all you family guy freaks will get this quote) I spray Lysol everyday but I think I'm getting it anyways.  Now isn't really the best time for me to get sick with school and work and all that good stuff.  Oh well.  Hey who's ready for the hurricane?  I hope it isn't a hurricane - just a tropical storm strong enough that Montclair State floods and they cancel classes.  I could dream right?

      OK, so I'm really bored today.  In the last issue of SI, there was an article on anagrams for sports teams and players, etc.  So I went to the  urlLink site  that the writer used and found some anagrams for my name, such as  Arab birth drunk  and  Rabbi drank thru .  So feel free to goof around.  It gives you a mess of possibilities.

      The weekend is over.  Today it's gloomy, and we might get hit by a  urlLink hurricane  on Friday...  Happy Birthday, Mom!  Sorry I never posted, but it was Saturday, and I didn't blog then or yesterday.  The Bengals lost again, but this one was a heartbreaker.  The game was theirs, but like I said before, they don't know how to win a game.  At least Pitt got fucking dismantled!    I'm applying for probably my last attempt at a teaching job in West Caldwell for a permanent sub position in 4th grade.  I've got experience with this, plus they advertise a benefits package.  It would be from Nov-June.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed.  I must purchase Family Guy Vol. 2 on DVD.  Anyone have 40 bucks I can borrow?    I intend to clean my basement today.  I don't know why, but I have nothing better to do.  Throw away old junk, give away useful games and/or toys, etc.  I don't mind the getting rid of stuff part, but I'm afraid of monstrous spiders or something attacking me when I remove our copy of   Clue  from the old bookshelf, which has accumulated 11 years of dust.

      I rose bright and early at 6:30 to start my day, unfortunately, it was at the dentist's office.  One of the places I have learned to hate as I have gotten older(or wiser).  They started by putting me through a series of about 16 X-rays.  Normally, there's 4 that they take, but these kept coming.  I thought they were taking an X-ray of each tooth, but they finally stopped.  Then the hygienist began scraping and poking at my teeth and gums.  I know everyone knows this pain, but have you ever seriously  looked  at the instruments they use?  Those things are evil.  Every tool had a sharp point except for the angled mirror, which instead had several sharp points.  Really, this one used a jagged piece of glass for its mirror.  Anyway, at least she was gentle and I didn't have any cavities.  On my way out, I stop to see the receptionist.  "How's March 16th sound?"  Great, but I'm sure something will come up between now and the six months that come between then.    Has anyone else seen this Hi-C commercial with the dancing penis?  Oh, wait that's supposed to be a tongue?

      Buona sera fellow bloggers!  All is well with my classes except I was hammered with tons of homework in the first week.  Welcome to college is what they tell me.  And I tell them F*** YOU!!  Not really.  I can't be that mean.  Classes actually haven't been that bad thus far.  The only downside is Italian.  I think I'll do okay in the class but we have to do a lab which is  at least  an hour a chapter.  I actually did one today for the preliminary chapter and it was the most boring thing I have ever been through.  All you do is read along with the dude on the tape and then fill in the blanks on the conversation.  What's the point?  And they actually want you to say it along with them.  Right, I'm going to sit in an empty room and repeat after the tape while people walk by and think I'm crazy for talking to my imaginary friend...  And just so everyone knows I'm turing the big 2-0 on the 22nd of this month.  I was considering doing a countdown but I thought it might be too much.  Brian said he's taking me to some fancy schmancy restaurant to celebrate which is very nice of him, right?  I can't wait til my 21st though.  Everyone must leave school/work to help me celebrate the next joyous occasion.

      Holy crap!  I'm officially applying to grad school.  I'm scheduled to take my GRE on Thursday, September 25.  [Gulp]  I began filling out my app, and filled out my FAFSA in hopes of getting this shizzy going.  I still have to get references, transcripts, pass the GRE, and send everything in, but I'm definitely motivated.  I hope I can do it, and everything works out well.    I thoroughly cleaned my car today inside and out.  I washed it, scrubbed the tires, vacuumed, cleaned the windows, and polished up the vinyl.  I could not, however get all of the tar off the bottom of the car by the wheels.  I used that bug & tar cleaner, but it's embedded in the paint job I guess.  My trunk has a tendency of leaking, so I also vacuumed out a puddle of water beneath my spare tire.  It's pretty gross actually.  The water gets all slimy and my jack and tire iron rusted pretty fiercely.    I'm gonna go now, because I'm meeting Kim for some lunch/dinner before her night class.

      Sorry for the delay.  Things have been hectic since classes have started.  Yes, Brian, I did see the game.  I am cheering for UNC to lose all their games so we get a new coach.  As for the Miami "We choke in December " Dolphins (Hi Aquaman!).  I am now embarrassed to say they are my team after that craptacular performance against the Texans.  I am actually going to see them play against the Giants in October.  BTW, I will be home the 1st weekend in October if anyone wants to get drinks, food, etc.  Fortunately, my roomate and I are going on a road trip this weekend to Columbus Ohio to see Ohio State vs. NC State, which should be a good game. (He went to OSU as an undergrad).  In other news I saw Dashboard Confessional and MXPX at the Ritz in Raleigh this week.  Next show will be Built to Spill in October-very good indie rock band.  Bri, how is the job hunt going along?  Everyone can look forward to a recap of the Columbus trip in the next blog post.    Later y'all

      I attended a meeting at  urlLink GHT  last night because our season starts this Saturday, and came back with an abundance of mosquito bites and scratches on my arm.  I guess someone decided to play a little  Wiffle ball  before our meeting started, and the ball went into the shrubbery about 100 times, and each time I reached in, I came out with battlescars on my arms.  So I'm quite itchy this morning, but trying not to scratch.    I want to go back to school to work on my master's, but I don't know what to master.  I'm actually contemplating nixing the whole teaching area and going into public relations/speech/linguistics.  Not all 3, but one of those.  My major was in interpersonal communication.  I have lots of forms to fill out, and still have to take my GRE.  I'm going to post the very last part of my story, but I also think it's still weak.  I like the ending, but as far as how to write it better and explain things more clearly, I'm still working on it.  So hope you liked it if you read it.      Coreys court date was a month later.  I didnt go to the hearing.  Corey was found guilty.  There were traces of blood found at the murder scenes that matched his.  Now hes in jail, probably waiting for the death penalty down the road, and Im living happily with Sammy.  Isnt love blind?  Now Im living with Sammy and my ex-boyfriend is in jail for my crimes.  Corey didnt really kill anyone.  I did.  Erika, Ashley, and Josie hurt my Sammy, and Andy stayed with that bitch Josie.  I had been with Sammy since Josie broke it off with him.  I knew him well now, and knew he was hurt.  They deserved what they got.  Like I said, Corey was careless.  He drove recklessly, and was always late for school.  He was always injuring himself-cutting himself.  How could you not find his blood?  I found plenty of it, and found good uses for it as well.  Now tell me, is love blind or is justice blind?

      It's 9:03am.  Wow, that feels early.  This is the result of working in a movie theater until 2am regularly.  If you are looking for action and excitement in the life of Rob, well.....  too bad.  Anyway, I am going to school again today to discuss my master's project with a professor.  He sent me an email with a few papers last week seeing if I was interested.  The stuff seemed right up my alley, so I told him so and promptly arranged an appointment to hammer out details.  When I show up at this time, He talks to me for literally 45 seconds, handing me 3 pieces of paper, one of which is almost a doodle.  We do not discuss what his actual interest is in this material sample he wants me to study, a timetable for doing anything, when I can use the lab, who might help me learn some of the lab equipment, etc.  Nice meeting.  Anyway, I go back today, so that could help.  As for the New England Sucktriots... they were the suckiest bunch of sucks who ever sucked.  I actually wrote an article about them on Sunday for some free sports newspaper in Boston.  The paper has been out for 2 weeks, and its one of the free things people read on the train.  I felt better when they wrote back to me on Sunday saying they got lots of articles and the only one to be printed was mine.  However, I don't get paid since the paper is in infancy stages.  Coincidentally, thats why I can write for them.  Also the paper comes out tommorrow, so I have no idea if it will really be there and if its all edited up.  This is the closest thing to news in my life.  Other activites of the past week include: making smoothies, buying a shot of wild turkey for a 21-year old photographer friend on his birthday, watching some street performer fit through a squash raquet with some confusing girl, leaving the last train of the night with the photographer so he could throw up some wild turkey among other things, listening to an entire Bruce Springsteen concert on my friend's roof and outside Fenway Park (very good indeed), sending most of the day employees home at the movie theater since we have no money since there are no customers, and of course making sure the photographer got home alive via buying a cab as to leave the remaining wild turkey on the sidewalk.  Blog out yo.

      The bloggers' football teams are a combined 1-3 after the opening weekend.  Is this a sign of things to come?  Yeah, probably.  Den, did you happen to see the Cuse/UNC game on Saturday?  It wasn't televised up here, but it seemed like a pretty awesome game from the score and stats.  I know the outcome wasn't what you would have liked, but exciting nonetheless.  As for fans in Bengaldom, their sheer stupidity goes along with the ineptness of the team the past decade.  I've been hearing some fans wanted coach Lewis to put in Palmer because Kitna was awful, but Palmer wasn't even active.  He's not going to play until their season is officially over, like after 8 games or so maybe, when they'll be 2-6 or 1-7.  The team itself is the same old story.  They get down by 20 points in the first half, and the game is over, because their offense doesn't know how to win a game.  Pathetic.  I got a Hey Mercedes poster in the mail today for their new album, but I don't know why.  I'm not complaining though...  Where's Kevin when you need him?  I'm actually listening to an old Everclear cd right now.  Well, here's the next part of my story:    I quietly scaled the stairs and slipped into my room.  I grasped a business card and dialed Andys uncle.  I whispered to him that I suspected the killer to be in my house.  Corey must have heard the phone click down because he came running into my room to see whom I was talking to.  I said nobody.  I lied.  He knew I lied.  He looked at me funny.  I asked him how the chicken was coming along.  He said good, but he cut his finger again.  He always cut his finger.  He was careless.  He just stood there, holding the knife tightly, looking at me in puzzlement.    Boom!  The front door collapsed.  The police barreled into my room and whisked Corey away in cuffs.  They had saved me for now.  Andys uncle comforted me and told me everything would be OK now.   I know.  Two of my best friends were murdered, and I stopped him from killing again.

      Today I went job hunting yet again, but realized once again that the mall is a horrible place.  Not much accomplished again.  I ate tuna for lunch.  I've really grown to like tuna over the years, but still can't get over the fact that it comes in a can.  I'm finally able to just pretend that it's not cat food.  I remember the first time I tried the tuna that's vacuum sealed in the pouches, but that made it seem even worse-tuna in a bag?  Anyway, it's eaten.    While on my journeys, I picked up a frame from Linens and Things for my autographed Face to Face poster.  Well, when I tried putting the poster in, I noticed the interior part of the glass was gritty and dirty somehow, so I took it out to clean it off with some glass cleaner.  Upon cleaning the surface, I found that the cleaner only removed the grime, but there was still streaks and blotches on the glass I could not remove.  So I tried to put the glass back into the frame, but somehow it did not fit.  I was able to remove it, but it seemed impossible to get back.  So I tried pushing the little metal clasps(the ones that keep the cardboard and picture in the frame) as flush against the wood as possible, since I realized the glass was hitting them.  After completing this task and brutalizing my thumb with the pushing, the glass fits, only to shatter seconds later.  I don't know how it broke, but it did.  So now there's a corner of the frame that just cracked right away from the rest of the glass.  I cut three of my fingers during this fiasco, and decided that i was not going throw out the frame.  I took some household cement(the same stuff that failed to hold my rearview mirror) and applied it to the shards of glass.  I set them in place, so hopefully it will hold.  The glass will still have two cracks that will be obvious, but right now, if it holds, I'll be happy.  I have to wait till tomorrow to put the poster in, though.  Well, it's the weekend, and it's actually really nice outside.  Woo!  Pizza tonite.  Here's the next part of the story:    I started seeing things in my mind.   Erika and Ashley.  Andy and Josie.  Then I saw Corey.  What did Corey have to do with them?  He knew Andy and Josie, but  what did that mean, and what about Erika and Ashley?  The six oclock hour rolled around and I was actually getting hungry.  My grumbling stomach told Corey.  He said hed help me put something together for dinner.  We had to eat something, otherwise wed feel worse.  I looked in the freezer to find ice cream, waffles, and a package of chicken cutlets.  We decided to have some chicken.    I went to the basement to find something to eat with the chickencreamed corn or some slop like that in a can.  I never wanted Corey down there because it was a disaster.  My parents left it in shambles when they moved into a new house.  I was embarrassed by the mess.  He started preparing the chicken.  After selecting my canned vegetable of choice, I made my way back up the stairs.  I caught a glimpse of Corey in the kitchen holding a knife.  The thinking resumed.  I saw things in my mind going in reverse order, like when rewinding a video tape while watching it.  The tape froze.  Play.  Before Corey and I got together, Corey tried to win over Erika and Ashley.  He was desperate before I met him.  He wanted a girlfriend so badly, and I gave him a chance.  Was the killer in my house?  Was he making chicken in my house with a very sharp knife?

      Today was my first day back at school.  I wasn't very excited about this because I took 2 summer classes and I felt like I never the left the place.  Especially since I finished my last summer class exactly a week ago.  Oh what I won't do to graduate in 4 years.  Today was Accounting and Religions of the World.  Me? In a religion class?  FUNNY!!!  I think they're going to be fairly easy classes.  Tonight I have Business Math: Calculus.  All you math nerds can appreciate how excited I truly am to be taking a calculus class.  Next semester- Statistics!!!  When I got home from class, I took a glance at all the classes I still need to take and I was saddened at what I saw.  I still have a butt load of general requirements to take, among these being 3 contemporary issues classes.  Why do I have to endure this pain?  To be a well rounded person?  Who wants to be round?  Not me!!  Anyways, tomorrow I'm up again at 5:30am to my Business Law and Italian classes.  I hope they're both somewhat easy especially Italian.  I took Spanish for 5 years and I still can't carry a conversation so maybe if I pay attention this time it will make it easier... Ciao!

      I almost forgot a very important thing to talk about today.  I know the other bloggers here either don't care for hockey, or are devils fans, but I am a Rangers fan, and not the best hockey fan, but I was a huge fan of  urlLink this man .  And if you believe otherwise, look at the poster on my wall of the man from his first NHL season, where he didn't have the modern mask with all the painted designs on it.  It will be a sad time for me at 3:00 pm today, when  Mike Richter  announces his retirement.  I may shed a tear because I'm a big puss, but the man  was  the New York Rangers for the past decade.  Sure, you can argue with Messier, but Richter was huge in their 94 playoff run, and may not have been one of the best goalies in the league over the years, but he was one of the best in Rangers history, in terms of victories.  On top of all this, he was born in the U.S., so that makes it even better that he had a good career and wasn't born in Slovakia or some other European country.  Now that I've babbled for quite some time, I will wrap this up.  Here's to you, Mr. Richter.

      It's officially September.  You know why?  When I drive down Broad Street, there's dozens of hoodlums standing outside the deli by the high school.  I never quite understood the phenomena.  Let's stand clustered really close together and smoke cigarettes in the rain ouside of a deli.  Yeah, that's hardcore.  A deli that's right next door to a florist.  I don't know.  Tonight kicks off the  urlLink NFL  season.  I don't care about the Redskins/Jets, however.  Here's my predictions for the NFL season:  Bengals finish 6-10 with wins over denver, baltimore, arizona, houston, pitt, and st. louis.  i'm hoping for better, but don't expect it.  i have every right not to.  it's been 12 years without playoffs.  NFC North: Packers, Vikings, Lions, Bears NFC East: Eagles, Giants, Cowboys, Redskins NFC South: Bucs, Falcons, Panthers, Saints NFC West: Rams, Seahawks(my surprise team), 49ers, Cards Wild Card=Falcons, Giants NFC Champ Game:Eagles over Falcons  AFC North: Browns, Steelers, Ravens, Bengals AFC East: Patriots, Bills, Dolphins, Jets AFC South: Titans, Colts, Jags, Texans AFC West: Chiefs, Raiders, Broncos, Chargers Wild Card: Bills, Raiders AFC Champ Game: Titans over Patriots Super Bowl: Titans over Eagles *disclaimer:  Do not use these as your own picks, or you will burn in hell and be ridiculed enormously.  The author has no clue about picking football standings.  This is all in good fun.  OK, now that's over.  Here's the next part of my story:  I woke up at about ten on Saturday morning.  I probably would have slept through Saturday completely, but the doorbell woke me up.  It was the police.   Hello, Miss, Im Officer Taylor, Andys uncle.  I was informed that you were a friend of Josie and Andy.  Yes, wh--whats happened?  Well, Miss, he paused and I noticed his adams apple bob in his throat, as if he was swallowing back something.  They were found dead this morning.  His eyes watered.  Im very sorry.  If theres anything I can doHeres my card.  Please take care, and we promise we will end this case soon.  I will make sure of that. Im so sorry.  I cried and closed the door lightly.  I slid to the floor with my back to the door.  I picked up the phone to call Corey.  I couldnt compose myself enough to be comprehendible, however.  I finally was able to spit out in blurts, Coreyneedyouhere.  He was at the door when the I hung up the phone.  He came over and tried to comfort me.  I weeped in his arms for what seemed to be hours.  He seemed very uneasy about the situation as well.  He shook at times, and choked back tears often, as he and Andy were becoming closer as friends.  Ive got a bad feeling about this, he said.  Me too, hon.  I mean, Im getting a bad vibe right now.  What do you mean?  I think I should go see if I can help Andys uncle.  I want this creep put away now.  No, you cant, please.  I need you here.  Dont leave me.  All right, but I just wish this never happened.  I wish I could go back in time or something to stop it.  I dont know what to do.  I feel helpless.  He was right.  We quivered nervously for the rest of the afternoon.  Every noise we heard caused a rush to see if the door was still locked, and with each click, chirp, or thud, I began to think more.

      Hmm.  I went job-hunting today.  The fruits of my labor were not rewarded, however.  The closest I got was an application for Modell's, and Kim hooked me up with the person in charge of personnel at her bank.  The lady seemed nice, and told me to send in my resume, but she'll be away next week and probably won't get back to me until the following week.  I went to Target, because they are opening a new store in nearby Clifton soon.  I asked the lady at Guest Services, and she had no idea what I was talking about.  She said you can apply on the computers.  So I attempt to do the computer thing.  First off, the computers were slow, and after I was halfway through, this error message came up, and I couldn't get out of it, so I just started pounding the keyboard.  It finally took me back, and I was able to continue.  When I was on the last part, it said these questions were optional, so I decided just to hit enter and move on.  Suddenly, the screen pops up saying "Thank You" with that stupid Target dog.  So I left.  I was there for an hour with that stupid computer.  I say I was done.  Here's an update on things I said I would bring up again:  1)my rearview mirror is indeed staying put on my windshield.  I guess that kit worked for now.  2)my foot is still painful when I walk on it.  Don't know what to do about it.  Here's the next piece of my story.  It's very short:    Andy and Josie were snuggling on her couch watching television.  Even after the tragedies, they still managed to find comfort in each other.  Friday night was a horrible night to be home.  There was never anything on, except sometimes there were some good stand-up comics on cable.  The couple managed to forget about the world and laughed at the comedy routines they witnessed.  There was a pleasant variety of performers that gave the audience a chuckle.  A short, plump male managed to coax the most laughter from the two.  As the emcee was introducing the next comic, and a loud noise rumbled in Josies kitchen.  The laughter had stopped.

      If anyone knows of a place I can work full time, let me know please.  God, I hate this.  I spent several more hours on the Internet researching jobs I would be qualified for with a BA in Interpersonal Communication, and there's some things that don't sound too bad, but I can't suddenly become a copy writer or advertising specialist without experience.  This is too depressing, and the 60 degrees and rain aren't helping either.  I was actually contemplating going to one of those computer training schools for computer graphics and design stuff, but I would need money to pay for it, and a job to supply the money to pay for it, and if I had a job, I probably wouldn't want to do that anyway.    In other news, Roy Halladay owned the Yankees yesterday, and it was enjoyable watching the Jays win a game, since I hadn't seen them win on tv since the end of May probably.  In a way, I kind of feel bad for Jeff Weaver.  I don't like the Yankees, but if he was on another team that was mediocre, he wouldn't be scrutinized nearly as much.  Yeah, he isn't very good, but when Josh Phelps blasted that 3-run homer in the 8th yesterday, Weaver's head just fell, and I actually felt sorry for him.  The game was over anyway, because fat Wells allowed 5 runs before Weaver entered.  Oh well.  Today doesn't feel like Tuesday to me.  And it doesn't feel like September.  It feels more like the middle of October.  Dreary and chilly.  Well, here's another part of my story:    Corey brought me to his house.  I thought he was hiding something from me.  He didnt say much since Andy showed him the newspaper in the morning.  I told him to take me to my home, since his absence of mind wasnt contributing to any comfort for me.  I would have been better off alone.  Maybe I could clear my head and forget about things for a while.  Corey walked my to my door and made sure I was in before retreating back to his place.  He ate some pizza and watched the game all night.  He knew not to call when I ask him to be alone for a while.  I always called him when I was ready.  It was six oclock, so I watched the news when I got home.  They reported that Sammy had apparently left town and the police couldnt trace his whereabouts.  He was gone.  They fucked up.  Commercial.  I was too worked up to eat dinner that night, so I continued to watch the science channel until about ten.  I decided my eyes were tired at that point, so I went to sleep.

      Happy Bday, Ord!  My dad's the best.  I had a new revelation for a job...I want to work in a hotel, and work my way up, so one day, I can travel to fun places and stay for free in part of the hotel chain I work for.  That would be sweeeet.  But in reality, I don't see it happening.  I'm going to try my damnedist to make it happen though, since this teaching thing isn't calling me.  I need a job with money and benefits right now, and subbing's not gonna do it for me.  Well, I have the next part of my story:   On the ride home, I was dozing, but I do remember one thing-the radio.  Corey always played around with the radio in the car, and rarely settled on a station for more than a song.  This night was strange because he didnt fuss around.  He hit the preset channel 6 and news blared from his speakers all around my skull.  Through all the commotion and vibrations of bass in his woofers, I do remember being awake when a reporter stated that Sammy was released because they didnt have any evidence to contain him.  Coreys car stopped.  I was home.  I hugged Corey and sleep-walked to my bed.  I made sure to lock the door and secure the deadbolt.  I slipped off my shirt and jeans and dove into a big t-shirt.  I fell to my bed like and was nestled among my pillow friends.   The next afternoon, we all met at the usual spot in the student center.  Andy came running in with that mornings paper.  Someone else was murdered last night.  It was Ashley Myers.  She was found with a note.  The same one that was with Erika.  Josie cried out nervously, almost like a yelp.  I put my hand over my mouth, trying to hold back my almost-vomit.  This time, Andy wasnt joking about the murder.  He was shaken.  He was almost in tears.  Corey stood there, blankly staring at the paper.  That Sammys one sick fucker, screamed Andy.  It said they just released him, and he kills someone else.  Josies mouth opened ever so slowly.  It took a few tries of her quaking lips, but she finally spoke.  Ashley Myers was one of Sammys ex-girlfriends.  Im the last one he had.  Im next.  She took a jump step to run away, but Andy grabbed her.  No youre not, he said.  Im here and youll be safe.  I promise. 	 We adjourned our daily meeting earlier than normal on Friday.  I dont think anyone went to class that day.  We all left.  Andy and Josie went to her place.  	 Andy, whats happening? Josie asked. 	 Some guy named Sammy murdered two girls.  Thats it. 	 And Im next.  What am I supposed to do?  I cant hide forever.  He knows where I live.  He knows too much about me. 	 Hon, Im going to stay with you tonight, and until they catch him.  I promise you will be OK.  My uncle tells me the second case will only prove it was Sammy, so when they get a hold of him this time, he wont be able to get away through some loophole.  If theres one person I can trust on the police force, its definitely my uncle.  You know Uncle Trever is not going to bullshit me. 	   I know he wouldnt b.s. you, but they still havent been able to find Sammy yet. 	 Hes as good as caught Jo.

      I would love to share the story of our ice fiasco...  We were sent to get ice by Brian's sister-in-law Rachel after we finished helping her with the food.  So we treked down to the 7-11 and bought 6 bags of ice.  We had 2 coolers so we figured it would be enough.  WRONG!!  As we were filling up the coolers Bri said, "Hey I think we need more ice."  I said, "OK.  Go get some more."  So I gave him the keys to my beautiful Altima and he came back with 4 more bags(i think it was 4).  So we finished loading the sodas and ice into the coolers when Brian says, "Oh shizzy.  What about the beer?"  I said "what beer?  there is no beer here."  Brian replied that people were bringing beers.  At this moment Rachel pops out of the door and we ask her about the beer.  She said oh yeah. So we were shipped off again to Rite Aid to see if they had any coolers and some more ice.  But do they have it? Nooooo.  Why would they?  So we walked over to the liquor store in the same lot and they have ice and those crappy little coolers that couldn't even hold a 6 pack.  So then we walk over to the Super Stop and Shop.  They call it super for no apparent reason because they were sold out of coolers.  If you were so super you would have more coolers in the back room!  So at this point me and Brian were we even considering a garbage can to hold the beverages.  So we walk over to the dollar store in hopes of finding some sort of container but to no avail.  So we go back to the house empty handed.  We tell Rachel and Kevin that we couldn't find anything.  So she says, "Well can't you go to the hardware store?"  Two replies to this: 1. Why can't  you  go? 2.  I've wasted enough gas(which is quite expensive nowadays) and time on your stupid party.  Of course I'm not mean enough to say this to her face so we get suckered into going to the hardware store.  We get to the store and we don't see any freakin coolers.  I remembered there were some containers outside so we check them out.  They were 44 gallon rubber things so we called Rachel and she said get it.  But we didn't know if we're supossed to take it inside or if they get it from the stock room or some crap.  So Bri goes inside to ask and comes back outside to get me.  I guess we were blinded by our rage but the coolers were sitting on top of one of the aisles.  So we get the kid to take it down and we pay for this crate of evil by the drunken fat guy.  We go back to the house and everyone is happy that we found a cooler and brought 6 more bags of ice.  But don't you know, their friend Danny brings a huge cooler later on filled with ice.  So we went nuts for nothing.    So lets tally up some things here: Total trips for ice/cooler- 4 Total amount spent on ice/cooler- about $60 Total amount of gas wasted- too much and i never got refunded for this. Sorry but a hot dog doesn't cut it. Total amout of drinks guzzled down to get rid of anger/headache- not enough

      Does anyone have a remedy for a super sore neck? My neck frickin hurts!  Halloween is tomorrow and the little kids will stay from my house because there is a cemetary right across the street. Maybe they're afraid the zombies will eat their brains. I know I'm afraid.  Brian and I are going to celebrate El Dia de la Muerte with my good friend Liz at her house.  PARTY TIME!

      Thursday.  My day off.  Oops, scratch that.  I was asked yesterday to work today, so I have to go in at 1, and I don't know when I can leave.  Apparently, lots of things going down with employees or something.  I wasn't too happy yesterday when I was asked, basically because it was 5:25 and I was supposed to leave at 5:30.  Not the greatest way to end my shift.  Anyway, I think the manager thought we'd have a big rush on our Halloween candy tonite.  Enough about that.  NBA season is here and I'm not really into it yet.  Keith VanHorn had 29 points for the Knicks, but they lost.  I'm sick of hearing about Lebron James already.  The Sixers are 1-0 and are on ESPN tomorrow nite at Sacramento.  Other than that, I don't know what else is happening yet.  I had a bunch of things I wanted to get done today, but they'll have to wait.  One thing was to get my car checked, but I can't because I'll be using it to get to work.  I hope it holds out until next Thursday.  On a positive note, I do get my first paycheck today, but I'm sure it will be a great disappointment after I take into account my bills.  Well, if I don't blog tomorrow, which I probably won't, then have a fun-filled weekend!

      Hey Mercedes rocked NYC!  The first band seemed okay at first but the singers voice sucked.  The second band was a Thursday rip off - a screamer and a singer.  This was the crap band Bri spoke of before.  The worst part was that they were trying to get the crowd involved. The singer said, "Even if you don't like us, we're all here because we love music so clap your hands."  I'm sorry but the shit they were playing was NOT music.  Moving on, Damone was ok but the singers voice wasn't 100%.  However, she shreds a guitar solo.  I thought Damone was the last band to go on before HM but I was told otherwise.  Then Whitelight Motorcade came on.  They tried very hard to look rock and roll but they were really a bunch of no talent ass clowns.  Everything they played has been done before.  They were completely unoriginal.  What a waste of time.  Then HM came on and all was well.  I once again sang every single word to every single song.  I'm truly pathetic.  They played a lot of new stuff (Quality Revenge at Last, It's Been A Blast, Knowing When to Stop, Lashing Out, Go On Drone) and some of the more popular old songs (Eleven to Your Seven, Stay Six, Our Weekend Starts on Wednesday, Go Blue).  They played Go Blue as an encore but damn Irving Plaza has a curfew so we couldnt hear anymore of our favorites.  I think it's very ridiculous that a club has a curfew.  Oh well.  I think the show was worth the 12 bucks just for Hey Mercedes alone.  Everyone in the band was totally into it and you can tell that they're having fun up there.  Although this trip to the city wasn't so bad, I let it be known to a member of hm that they have to play at Maxwells every time they come to NJ.  Anyone who has been to Maxwells knows why.    Enough about hm!  I'm doing just fine in case anyone was wondering.  Let me sum everything up for ya: School's a bitch.  Work sucks.  I'm no longer sick.  I need a vacation but definitely not to Myrtle Beach.  Hope everyone is doing well.  Bye!!! :)

      Damn, it's been a while since my last blog.  Times have been busy for the new worker, so I've been a slackin'.  The new job is pretty good so far.  Still don't know what my daily duties will be, but the people are nice and it's a job.  This weekend was full of many exciting events.  I'll go in reverse order and work backwards from today.  The  urlLink Bengals  are 3-4.  They are in second place in their division, and already have one more win than they had all of last season, and without their "star" running back, Corey Dillon.  More on him in a moment.  Anyway, they defeated the previously 5-1 Seahawks 27-24.  Their defense allowed only 7 points in the second half, and the TD came withing the first 6 minutes of the 3rd quarter.  Two in a row, and next week they travel to Arizona.  As for Corey Dillon, he got into a car accident before the game, and hopefully he's ok, which I think he is, but prior to that, he was being a total ass and complaining about not getting the ball enough.  First of all, you have to play to get the ball.  He's been injured every game!  And second of all, the team has now won 3 games without you.  They're playing really well and keeping games close, so shut your mouth and play like you're paid to.  If not, then they have a perfectly capable backup in Rudi Johnson, who broke 100 yards today.  Last night was the  urlLink Hey Mercedes  show at Irving Plaza in NY.  Just seeing the band was nice.  I'll have more on that in a moment as well, because there were many ups and downs involved in the night.  Upon arriving home, I was informed that the Marlins defeated the Yankees in the World Series.  Wow.  I'm not going to rub it in, because everyone who blogs is a Yankee fan, but that put a smile on my face before bed.  As for the HM show, here's the deal thru a list of pros and cons:               PRO:  HM played a show      CON:  It was in NY  PRO:  HM was headlining      CON:  There were 4 opening bands  PRO:  Going with 2 cool people(Kim & Liz)      CON:  It was in NY  PRO:  Not driving into city      CON:  Finding parking in Hoboken  PRO:  Found parking in lot next to PATH      CON:  Parking cost $20  PRO:  PATH station close to Irving Plaza      CON:  Forgot how to get to Irving Plaza from PATH  PRO:  Found place pretty easily      CON:  It was still earlier than anticipated  PRO:  Doors open at 7 pm      CON:  It was 7:10 and I really had to pee  PRO:  Doors opened at 7:15      CON:  First band started at 7:50  PRO:  The bar had the Captain      CON:  Captain & Coke cost $7  PRO:  Talked to Bix, the HM tech      CON:  He had no new t-shirts for sale  PRO:  1st band usually plays short set      CON:  1st band sucked  PRO:  2nd band usually plays short set      CON:  2nd band was Canadian and sucked  PRO:  Saw people we knew(Kate, Dave)      CON:  Saw plenty of scenesters  PRO:  3rd band was Damone      CON:  There was another band after them  PRO:  Talked to people we knew      CON:  Had to leave due to mild case of food poisoning  PRO:  Returned feeling better      CON:  There was still another band to play  PRO:  4th band looked rock & roll      CON:  4th band sucked  PRO:  HM went on at 10:45      CON:  Irving Plaza has a curfew  PRO:  Found PATH station easily      CON:  It was 110 degrees in the station  PRO: Hit very little traffic on way home       CON:  My car sounded like it was going to fall apart  PRO: Turn back clocks, gain hour of sleep      CON:  It was still 1:30   So that's a short list of the show's experience.  In other news, I'm working 2-11 tomorrow night.  I'm wondering what I'll be doing since the managers usually leave at 5, and I have no idea how to do anything yet.  Hmm.  I'm going to see Dave's band on Wednesday at Just Jake's in Montclair.  He plays the keyboard.  Should be interesting.

      Day one of my new job.  I worked from 9-5:30 and will be tomorrow, Weds, and Friday.  I still don't know what my job description is, or what I will be doing.  My supposed job title is SIMS coordinator.  It's like I'm going to be in charge of inventory-keeping supplies on hand, knowing when we have too much, etc.  I'm supposed to find out more on Weds.  Tomorrow is truck day, so I'll be busy with that all day.  Today consisted of me moving boxes around in the stockroom in preparation for truck tomorrow and attempting to complete a display for Christmas, although it did not turn out well, since we didn' t have enough shelves to complete the task.  The people I've me so far have seemed really nice, which is a plus, but I'm not used to working, so my stomach and rest of body are out of whack.  I was hungry at 12, but didn't want to eat since I still had 5 and a half hours left.  I'm also tired, because I had to do a lot of stupid errands when I got home, so I only got to sit down at 7:30.  Anyway, I'm happy I'm working.  The place seems nice, and I'm hoping once I find out what my job will be, I can learn that before worrying about every other possible job in the store.  Rob, your story was touching, but for some reason, I knew something was going to happen to ruin it.  I'm sorry about that.  Keep your head up.  I ordered the book the other day, because I don't have anything else to read right now, so I'm supposed to receive it this week sometime.  Kev,  The Matrix Reloaded  was indeed a piece of crap.  I liked the first movie, and thought the second one made no sense and had really only one scene I enjoyed, which was the last big action scene.  I have no urge to see the new one either, but if I do, it will be with the gift certificate I have, so I technically won't be paying for it.  Tomorrow's day 2 of work.  I gotta get to sleep early tonite, because I'm feeling a little weary and my nose is running.  Hope to sleep it off and fight off any cold or such symptoms.

      It's Monday, and I dont want to be at work.  I am dead tired.  This past weekend was not overly relaxing.  I stayed in Friday nite and rented  The Matrix Reloaded .  What a piece of crap.  The effects were realistic, but the story was so fricken complicated that it ruined the entire movie.  I have very little desire to see the third movie when it comes out now.    Saturday nite was fun though.   urlLink Meredith  and I went to Toad's Place to see Stephen Lynch.  He was amazing.  I really needed to laugh like that.  He didnt have an opening act, so he went on at 8:30 and was done by 10:15, which was nice for an old guy like me.  He played most of his "classics" and a few new ones.  Damn I miss O&A....  Meredith liked everything he played, except for part of his encore, where he performed  Kill a Kitten .  She loves cats, and found the song offensive, but she laughed anyway.  He didnt perform  FBA , but he did play the two songs that he considers his worst songs:  The Abortion Song  and  Special Olympics .  Also, he made it a point to let everyone know that he got married recently, so I guess he wasnt going to any of the local bars after the show and try to pick up annoying Asian chicks (sorry, that was a reference to something only Rob will get).  We got up early Sunday morning to drive all the way back Bloomfield because the 9am mass at Sacred Heart was being dedicated to my grandfather who passed away 20 years ago this past weekend.  All of his children and grandchildren were there.  It was nice to see my family.  We then had lunch at Charlie Brown's in Upper Montclair.  I think that half of us did not enjoy our meals.  I think that place sucks.  It used to be nice, but not anymore.    Oh well, back to work.

      I'm still not feeling so well.  I was actually feeling much better for the past few days thanks to some over the counter cold medication.  It cleared up my sinuses but it made my heart race.  Despite that, I continued to take it so I could make it through my hectic school/work schedule.  I decided on Friday night that I wasn't going to take it anymore, but I woke up on Saturday feeling worse than ever.  Of course I had to work, so I decided to take the evil cold meds again.  When I got to work my friend/co-worker Michele treated to me to a nice cup of coffee.  Bad move.  I was so shaky through the day.  I was seriously worried about driving home.  The ride from Wayne to Clifton, although not very long, is very unfun.  So, I swore to myself to NEVER take that shizzle again, but I again woke up today with a stuffy nose.  Speaking of stuffy noses, why is it that only one nostril gets clogged?  Example, at the moment my right nostril is completely stuffed but my left one isn't.  What's the point? I can't breathe too well with just one so clog up both so I can be completely miserable! Anyways, I hope I feel better before Saturday when Bri, my friend Liz, and me go to see our boys Hey Mercedes.   Speaking of Hey Mercedes, I've been talking online with Ryan whose a good friend of HM.  He's gone on several interviews with this video game company in Chicago. I hope he gets the job. Free video games for all!! SWEET!!!!

      So the ball....   Let me tell you about last night.   It was like a huge funeral here last night.  On my train home last night, the conductor was sobbing.  I saw a guy lying face down on a park bench, but he just might have been homeless.  Boston just became really quiet.  I truly feel quite bad for the fans up here even though there are a ton of assholes.  Seeing people just resign themselves to believing this curse crap is real is depressing.  Anyway, that being said, it was a great game to finish one of the best series I've ever seen.  Unfortunately, this is the World Series that nobody wanted to see, but I think it'll be somewhat close.    Sunday Sunday Sunday!  Pats- Dolphins.  Pats break the jinx 28-20.  I think I'll predict a Pats win by the score of 28-20 every week.  Its fun.  I also read the Corrections, right about a year ago and I agree with Dennis.  It's good.  I have a copy if you wanna wait until Thanksgivingish or I could just mail it to you.  It was Eric's book and I was supposed to mail it to him in like January, but I forgot so he bought another copy.    Other stuff:  My mom and aunt have been up here since Tuesday visiting.  They went to Cape Ann (another quaint area with an Ocean view and little shops like they enjoy) on Tuesday and I went with them for one night.  It was good just to spend time with them and whatever, but there was a funny incident.  We went to dinner at seafood place called McT's.  The food was good, but that's not where I'm going.  The waitress was kinda cute and my mother and aunt were making offhand comments that she was 'making eyes' at me.  I disagreed, but I did think she was cute.  But it was strange because after we left I started thinking about the waitress.   I was wondering who ends up as a waitress in Gloucester in October when there are hardly any tourists left.  I also was playing with the idea in my head of what would happen if I had actually tried to pick up a waitress while she was working.  Not a pretty thought, but anyway.  The next day I took the train from Gloucester to Boston in the afternoon since I had to work at night.  I caught the 3:48 pm train.  So, of course you see where this is going.  She stepped right past me as I sat down on the train.  I wouldnt think it was weird if there were like tons of people getting on the train, but there were only like 6 or 7 people total.  Anyway, she said hi and walked to a different part of the train.  I picked up my stuff from the seat and walked to where she was and sat across the aisle.  We ended up talking for a good 40 minutes of the hour ride.  She's actually really cool,  She's 24, and works as a waitress and a landscaper.  She was going into the city sice she takes a German course at a language institute.  She has moved 3 times in the last 6 months but is from Gloucester, and this is her last visit home before moving west, likely permanently.  She played rugby.  She also worked in the past as a photo developer and baker and is going to finish her double major in nutrition and German.  Just a set of really of really odd details worth noting only because we had a similar feeling in common.  Oldness.   We both decided that 24 is when we started feeling old and pressure to do something productive with life.  We parted and that was that since she's moving away in 2 months anyhow and lives in Gloucester which is 40 miles away.  Coincidence makes me laugh sometimes.

      Holy Crap.  As much as you all know I hate the Yankees, that game was, in the words of  Dennis , Incredible.  I'm not going to analyze it or complain about anything the Sox did.  You'll hear plenty of that on Sportscenter, etc.  I'm going to step aside and actually congratulate the Yankees for proving who the better team was.  I'm also applauding MLB for an absolutely amazing post-season so far.  Hopefully the World Series will go 7 games as well and continue the trend.  The one thing I'll say is that I liked Aaron Boone when he was a Red(ask  Kim  for the validity of this), and was upset when he came to NY because I knew he was a damn good player.  Now all the dumb Yankees fans around my area suddenly love the man.  Patience, y'all.  Oh by the way, Den's prediction was eerily close.  It's Friday!  They're actually calling for a nice weekend after today for once.  Sounds good to me.  Yesterday something strange happened.  Here's a little background:  My parents are planning on getting our front stairs replaced, as well as the small path to our side door.  They are going down the shore for a few days for their anniversary(Sun-Tue).  They called the mason to tell him to start the job when they got back from the shore, so he could do it all at once, instead of starting this week and waiting a few days, etc.  Kim had been over yesterday afternoon for lunch before her night class.  The doorbell rang about 3 pm, but I was in the restroom, so I didn't hear it.  She looked, but didn't know who it was.  When I returned, I went downstairs to see who it was.  I hear loud banging and open my front door to find my front steps being demolished and the railing dismantled.  The mason decided to start breaking down the stairs without telling us.  So I called my mother to see if I missed something, but she didn't know either.  She told them to go ahead and continue, so they could finish the stairs today.  So today I heard jackhammering at 8 am, and they're working right now.  Should be done with the stairs today, and will probably come back late next week to finish the side path.  I guess it wasn't a big deal, but I was thinking about what would happen if we were getting our porch rebuilt.  Would they just bring in a wrecking ball without telling us?    In other news, I've had a person-less house next door to me for about 8 months now.  The previous neighbors just bolted one day.  Finally, someone bought it late summer, but he's rebuilding the entire inside-walls, floors, electric-just about everything except the shell of the house.  On the other side, we have a strange house.  One guy's an Elvis impersonator, and the other guy is a fat, drunk, something.  I don't know what he does for a living.  But the fat guy's an asshole who parks his big red van on the street and insists on hitting every car while parallel parking.  Needless to say, we hate him, and found out the house was recently sold, and I'm told they'll be gone by the end of the year.  Woo-hoo!  Remember that show Home Improvement?  That Wilson guy was the neighbor.  Where the hell is our Wilson?  Have a good weekend folks.  Listen to  urlLink Knapsack .

      Well, it's officially worry time.  Game 7 Yanks vs Red Sox.  I'll be so nervous that I won't be able to enjoy the game.  Tomorrow is my Neurobiology midterm, so I have another thing to worry about.  In class, we watched a video where they gave monkeys Parkinson's by lesioning parts of the brain.  Obviously I'm pro research and I think PETA is a bunch of whiny rich kids with nothing better to do, I still felt pretty ill when watching the monkeys tremble.  Bri-for books, you should read   The Corrections   by Jonathon Franzen.  It's one of the best books I've read in a long time.  After my exam, I was going to give my book rant, much like my Rolling Stone review:), so wait for that.  For movies, get Indiana Jones on Tues.  While at the bookstore, you should check out the new    Esquire   magazine.  There is some good material in it.  "Mmmm. 20 questions with Lorne Michaels"  Well I gotta get ready for the game  My prediction tonite Yankees 5 Red Sox 4.

      Congratulations to the Chicago Cubs for sucking.  As long as their world series drought continues, I can no longer accept Bengals ridicule.  HAHA!  No, I was kinda rooting for them, but I'm totally fine with the Marlins, it just doesn't sound right.  I also didn't want Kerry Wood to take the loss, but the whole team just collapsed after a 3-1 series lead.  I'll wait for the Sox-Yanks tonite...  I'm officially starting my job Monday.  I'm working Mon, Tue, Wed, and Fri from 9-5 for a total of 32 hours.  It's my first week, so Monday I'll probably set up a fixed schedule for the weeks to follow and increase the hours up to 40.  I'm technically going to be in a management position, so that's gonna be nice.  I have to wear a shirt & tie, but as Kim said, I would have had to if I was teaching too.  I'm happy because I'll be getting some money and benefits.  Whew!  I was starting to get nervous about the lack of insurance.  Well, it's Thursday, so I'm gonna meet  Kim  for lunch/dinner. She's feeling a bit better, so I'm glad.  I feel like celebrating my job, but I don't have money from the job to celebrate the job.   Huh?  I decorated my house for Halloween yesterday.  I still enjoy this holiday for some reason, even though I don't dress up or anything.  I guess I'm still 10 in my mind.    Anyone recommend any good books, movies, or cds?  I plan on buying one or more of each with my first paycheck.  Especially movies and books.   urlLink Let me know .  Thanks.

      Wow, it's a good thing I didn't jinx the Cubs last nite.  What the hell was that all about?!  Today's my parents' anniversary, so Happy Anniversary!  Not like they're going to read this, but maybe they'll get the message telepathically.  I watched Conan last nite, and Jim Carrey was his first guest.  It was a rerun, but Carrey did  In The Year 2000  with him and was frickin' crazy.  Later, during his interview, he did this bit with Stephen Hawking.  Very funny stuff, and apparently, I heard that Carrey actually went to visit Hawking for dinner a few weeks after the original show was recorded.  I believe it was in June of this year.  Next Saturday is HM at Irving Plaza.  All right!  I hate the city.

      My baby is sick.  This sucks.  I did my best to take care of her today.  I'm sure I'll be getting sick soon.  Probably the kid with the outbreak cough from Friday night passed it along...  Congratulations to  Rob  for guessing the lyric.  It was indeed Skee-Lo from his song  I Wish .  You win!  I got my oil changed in my car today, and the guy tells me that my radiator is corroded a bit inside, and my coolant is dirty.  That sucks, because I got a new radiator put in by my awful mechanic last November, and it had a year warranty.  How does it wear down so quickly?  Anyway, I now have to get it flushed out and get my tires rotated for the winter, so my car doesn't ice-skate, and my engine doesn't get frostbite.  The Sox are pretty much cooked.  I don't see the Yanks losing to Burkett, especially with Pettite pitching...Cubbies look like they're wrapping it up.  Six more outs for the Fish.  So I will be joining the workforce again on Thursday-filling out W-4s and I-9s and all that jazz.  I am ecstatic to be employed again, well at least more than just every Saturday.  Good times.  Oh yeah, yesterday was Columbus Day(the day it's observed).  I remember always having off from school, at least until I reached college.  Yesterday I noticed that my old elementary school was in session.  What is this world coming to?  First they condensed Washington & Lincoln's birthdays into one day, then they stopped observing Veteran's Day in school, and now Columbus day isn't a day off anymore.  What's next?  No more Christmas break!

      Hello all.  The crazy New Jersey weather of 40 degrees one day and 70 the next has finally gotten to me..  I'm sick.  I'm not sure but maybe it's a punishment from the party the other night.  Probably not.  I only had three drinks...  Anyhoo, I'm on day 2 of my cold which basically means I must suffer for the next week and a half.  I'm no good at being sick.  I turn into a whiney little baby.  And guess what?  Mommy isn't home to take care of me.  What fun is being sick if there's no one to wait on you?

      Jeez, Den, you sound like a professional writer for Rolling Stone.  I'll take it!  There's this house around the corner from mine which stations a small dog that I'd like to kick.  It tends to poop on the sidewalk, and the owners don't ever clean it up.  Today when I was walking by, I noticed, ironically, that their house had been tp'd.  Well done!  Man am I bored.  I'm literally counting down the hours until this party.  I'm about to start drinking now.  Whoops, too late.

      Hello all,  During work, I listen Virgin radio UK on the Internet while I'm at my computer.  Normally it is a good station, lots of great Brit rock, except for a band called The Darkness.  You gotta hear them.  They are like an 80's hair band and their video is pretty fucking hysterical, which you can see for free at Rollingstone.com.  There's a guitar solo in it, where the guitarist is surrounded by a wall of amps.  Pure 80's metal.  Surprising to me they are #1 in the UK for the past month.  Anyway, on to good music.  The Strokes new album comes out in 2 weeks.  So far, it has gotten pretty good reviews and I'm looking forward to it.  This year has seen some killer releases, new Radiohead, White Stripes, Stephen Malkmus (of Pavement fame), Doug Martsch (of Built to Spill), and the Strokes.  The Strokes and White Stripes may be a little mainstream for some, but they both play great music and they get kids into such bands like the Velvet Underground and Televison, which is always a plus.  Radiohead is simply one of the best bands out today.  Amazing live performances, intelligent lyrics, and arguably the best musicians in any band.  There's my little rant on music for today.    Yankees 6 Red Sox 2, Series tied 1-1, Clemens vs. Martinez at Fenway on Saturday.  As a baseball fan, it doesn't get any better than this!!   Have a good weekend all!

       "Every day would be a Friday, and we could even speed down the highway."   If you know what song or artist this quote is from, then you win.  So I'm gonna speed down the highway today because it's Friday, and tonight I'm gonna exit that highway to go to Mr. Sides' house.  Once there, we will be partaking in the imbibing of alcohol.  Woo!  And on top of that, it's pizza nite beforehand!  Tomorrow I work for GHT, so what usually happens when I work for them?  Well, apparently it's not supposed to rain tomorrow.  Ho-ly Crap.  That's incredible.  Unfortunately, the game doesn't begin until 2pm because of the kids taking SATs tomorrow.  I won't be home until 7 probably.  So no Saturday, but that's where tonite is important!  Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!  I will be seeing about this job opportunity.  Hopefully all goes well and I'd be able to start soon after.  I have to fill out when of those apps on the computer, and then I gotta pee in a cup so they know I'm not addicted to meth.  Here's a story I'd like to share which highlights my job search experience.  Last Friday I received a phone call from  urlLink Belleville .  The secretary says they're going to be interviewing for two 5th grade positions.  I say I am interested and she says the interviews would be later next week, but she would call early in the week to schedule.  So I wait, and she doesn't call.  So yesterday(Thursday!) I call them.  She says they didn't interview yet, and she's not sure when they will be.  So I say, well will it be within the next few months?  She says she doesn't know, but probably.  So I ask will I still be on the interview list if they don't interview for another 3 months, and she says, "probably."  OK, then why did you call me last week?  This is just one of the many examples of ineptness in New Jersey's School Districts.  Absolutely disorganized.  Remember the movie  Disorderlies ?   No one does.  Never mind.  So this  urlLink AIM  thing is addictive.  I don't even have many buddy names, and I'm thinking I'm on way too much.  But it's quite fun, especially when you sign on at midnight last nite to check your email, and end up chatting with  Liz  until 1.  Don't worry.  Liz is Kim's friend, not some girl I met in a chatroom.  Anyway, I'm currently talking to  Kev  while he's working.  I feel kinda bad, but he says it's all good and he won't get in trouble.  Well folks, enjoy your weekend.  Listen to  urlLink The Appleseed Cast .

Why are you still reading this?!?!  Go, now!!  And get a network adapter if you have the PS2, because I plan on getting one and I can then kick your arse from across a few states.  I cant wait until 3pm so I can leave work and go play Tiger Woods...

There I was, drinking me spiced rum when I spotted a fine young lass who sat next to me.  McCallister comes back from the head and stumbles upon me peg leg and knocks her down.  Me lady left in a hurry and a slobberknocker broke out.  McCallister got what he deserved, but needs more a hurtin'.  He'll pay.

      Dude, you'll never guess what happened last night.  I was at the Town Pub watching the Cubs-Marlins game and noticed these two odd characters.  One guy was dressed in this long coat with boots and had a fisherman-type hat on and the guy he was sitting next to had this pirate theme.  He had this long mustache and goatee.  Anyway, The pirate guy was mackin' on some chick.  The fisherman guy comes back from the bathroom to sit down and trips on the pirates pegleg.  The fisherman falls into the chick and she falls down with him on top of her.  She hits him and pushes him away and stormed out onto Broad Street.  The pirate guy is pissed and starts whaling on the fisherman and swearing about how he always prevents him from getting any box.  More punches were exchanged before a big dude from the back came out to separate them.  The bartender called for a cab to bring the fisherman home, and the pirate guy had to drive home.  Chaos.  That was something you don't see every day, unless it was Halloween or something, but that's a few weeks away still.  Anyway, the Cubs destroyed the fish.  And the Sox were victorious as well.  Their bullpen looked pretty sharp, at least Timlin and Williamson.  Hope both series continue to be close, though.  You know what I had for breakfast this morning?  Cinnamon Toast Crunch.  I never had the stuff when I was a kid, but I'm eating it when I'm 24.  I ate after mowing the lawn, which is especially fun when there's pieces of metal hidden in the yard from the guy next door's construction.  It was like mowing over a mine field.  Try not to get electrocuted or get a contusion on your shin.  So on Sunday, I may have a job.  It's not a teaching job, but where has that profession gotten me, honestly?   Kim 's mom is hooking me up with a job full-time.  She said it would be like an inventory dude and i'd be on the floor as well, but it's a job and I couldn't be happier.  I just hope something stupid doesn't happen between now and Sunday.  So I'm happy, and I'm sorry about all the nagging and depression I've emitted the last few months on the blog.  I hope you understood a little of my feelings, but I think I was a little overboard, so things are looking up!  Oh, remember when I mentioned something positive happening with my brother?  Well, he's gonna be working at WFAN, probably the biggest sports radio station in the US, on a patchy basis.  He's happy as hell, and he's still gonna be at WCBS 880 as well.  Good stuff.  May blog again later.  Peace out.

      Hello all!  I just got home from class and I'm saving Loses Control to my computer.  The weird thing is that my Real One Player actually "knew" who Hey Mercedes was and had all the tracks listed for me so I don't have to type everything in.. Nice!  I think the boys have finaly made the big time.  This album is awesome and EVERYONE should own it.  Bob actually says fuck several times in one song.  I've neverheard fuck sound so pretty.  It made me wonder if fuck is a really a bad word.    I haven't seen any butterflies either Rob, but I have seen some nice sunrises sitting in my car on campus at 6:30 am...  Wow.

      Well, politics is officially a joke in this country.  Arnold Shwarzenegger is going to be governor of California, but strangely, I'm jealous.  I think it's because he couldn't do any worse of a job than Gov. McGreevey has done for this state.  Yeah that guy sucks.  Don't pass it to that guy.  Did anyone see the game last night?  Holy crap was that exciting.  Cubbies have a must-win tonite...  Yeah, so I just downloaded aim, so if you have it, my name is  urlLink stringmule .  I have no job, folks, give me something to do.  Not like you care, but I'm going to write a brief synopsis of the new  urlLink Hey Mercedes  album entitled  Loses Control .  These are my interpretations of the songs so far, so they may not even be close to the real meanings!  The artwork and photography are nice as well.  01   Quality Revenge At Last       Lyric:  There's a phone call coming from a Romeo in Joliet        Catchy song with some "Yeah's" in the chorus-probably most radio friendly I guess    02   It's Been A Blast       Lyric:  All the arguments are not the same without you       Most uptempo on CD in my opinion.  About a past fling he is looking back on. 03   Playing Your Song       Lyric:  The lies are piling up so high that he can't sleep at night       Third person story about a guy who is with a girl but loves another. 04   Knowing When To Stop       Lyric:  There's nothing inspirational like watching angels drop       The downfall of frienship through lies and fights. 05   The Boy Destroyers       Lyric:  All I know is I'm never gonna go the safe way home       Loneliness. 06   Unorchestrated       Lyric:  The point in time when everything dies.  It's over.       Sad song.  Depression to realizing things are not so bad. 07   Lashing Out       Lyric:  Smile and sing along to every single song       Singing along to some band at a show. 08   Police Police Me       Lyric:  The stars are all smiling.  It's disarming.       Media, cops, and criminals are all the same. 09   Oh Penny       Lyric:  And my dear old sharona keeps em on the floor wanting more       Happiness with someone elsewhere, but Penny is here now. 10   The Switch       Lyric:  I'm a nervous wreck. Hey I'm a tightrope.       Sex compared to a video game?  Huh?  High score...if it takes all night. 11   Absolute Zero Drive       Lyric:  So wake up soldiers and take all your arms and leave       My favorite song.  No fear, man. 12   Go On Drone       Lyric:  Stop the press. Who is that mess?       Miserable person continues to mope.

      Well, its 9am and I've been at work for 2 and a half hours now, and I don't feel like doing any work.  So, here's what I've been up to for the past week:  I took the  urlLink girlfriend  to see Howie Day at Irving Plaza last Thursday.  Jump, Little Children (now going by the moniker "Jump") opened and were rather good.  They played a good mix of old and new songs.  Then Howie went on.  He was good, but nothing special.  I really didn't see anything that would separate him from the other thousand singer/songwriters out right now.  The gf loved it, so I guess the nite was a success.  At least I got to see my friend Pete at the show.  I took Friday off from work, since we got back from the show at 3:30am.  I spent the day dicking with my car.  And then I completely wasted Saturday.  On Sunday, myself and 3 of my friends took two cars up to Vermont and we spent the day rallying our cars on the unpaved mountain roads of VT and Upstate NY.  It was a blast.  My car is completely filthy.  The only negative about the day is that we left at 9am and didn't get back until 9:30pm, so I spent 12 hours driving on a Sunday.  Needless to say, I was absolutely worthless at work on Monday; but it's not like I care.  It's sad, but I think I've become disenchanted with sports.  I really don't care if the Yankees win or lose, I've given up on the New Orleans Saints, I gave up on the New York Rangers years ago, and I never gave a shit about basketball.  I still love watching sports, but I can't rout for anyone like I used to.  Oh well  Later

      Who the hell is Captain McCallister?  Is that the pirate on the Simpsons?  Anyway, I worked tonight during the Red Sox game.  Not suprisingly, there were no movie-goers in Boston.  We were getting updates continuously.  This guy Justin jumped on top of me when they won.  The streets filled with people.  This city loves its teams, its scary and admirable.  I've been on record since July saying the Sox would win it this year, as there's quite a bit of something to this team.  That said, as a yanks fan, I predict Yanks in 4 for the pennant.  I know it doesn't make sense.  Regarding the Pats, they're gritty.  They only play well when they're dogs.  I have this sneaking suspicion that Belichick cut Milloy to motivate the team.  With 5 of their top 8 players on the defensive front out, the defense has been superb this year.  It doesn't show in the numbers necessarily, but the defense is as good as its been in 4 years.  The red zone D is solid.  All the young kids on defense, Wilson (now a safety), Samuel, Klecko, and Warren have all been productive.  The offense is its non-flashy 'try not to turn the ball over' self.  I expect many close games this year again.  I think they beat the Gaints this week on a very good week from Brady and the receivers.  Truthfully, Shockey matches up well against the Pats D as all TEs do, but I think they'll do something to compensate in turnovers and special teams.  NE over NYG 28-20.  Non-sports, I've been working alot.  I havent seen many pretty butterflies or sunsets.  My project is moving slowly due to my lack of time.  However, I'm still paying my rent, barely.  I think I'm going to listen to the Strokes and sleep tonight.    Blog it!

      Hi everybody again.  So I am bored and decided to blog again.  I wrote three new songs today, so visit my  urlLink site .   I received my copy of the new Hey Mercedes CD, and it is quite enjoyable, as expected.  More on that perhaps tomorrow after a few more listens.  The first song is about the daily grind, and can be found  urlLink here , while the second song, about the upcoming season, can be found  urlLink here , and the final one, written mainly for  Kim  can be found  urlLink here .

      Hello all!  Long time, no blog.  I've been busy with school, work and Brian which leaves me no time to blog.   Football this.  Baseball that.  As the only female on this blog I say screw that shizzle!  Talk about more important things like butterflies and beautiful sunsets.  Wha?  As proven by my prior statement, I am not really into sports but I did catch some of the Giants game with Brian on Sunday and they made some pretty miserable calls.  Shockey was not taunting.. He was simply trying to get that guy off of him and the ball slipped.  See what having a reputation can get you?     Where has everyone been?  I guess I'm not the only one not blogging..

      I think I'm going to stop making predictions before I realize how utterly ridiculous I feel.  Does that even make sense?  Anyway, I said the Bengals would win outright, but they lost in OT.  I still don't think Buffalo is all that good though.  All of Bledsoe's passing yards came after CB Jeff Burris left the field on a stretcher, and Eric Moulds was covered by a scrub.  Yeah, it was the key time to start getting yards, but still, they were lucky because he had 102 yards midway thru the 4th quarter...  I said last week the Red Sox weak link in the lineup was the leadoff spot, which is Johnny Damon.  I like Damon, but I just felt he'd been so inconsistent during the year, and yesterday he hits a 2 run homer.  I really hope the Sox win because I want them to beat the Yankees.  I know just about everyone here likes the Yankees, but I don't, and frankly I'm sick of them.  After the game, they decide to interview Jeter surprisingly.  Why?  He hit a meaningless solo HR?  How about naming Nick Johnson or Matsui player of the game when their 2-run hits mattered in the game, or maybe even fat David Wells for pitching [sigh] another important game in the postseason.  Anyway, it's Pedro vs. Zito tonite, and the Sox need a big game from everyone, but it's time for Kevin Millar to step it up.   urlLink Tomorrow is the day!   Oh yeah, how about those Cubbies?  Giants: check; Braves: check; Yankees: not yet.  Hey 2 out of 3 gone from the playoffs is a  great  start.  I think I'm going to root for the Cubs, but I will not be saddened if the Marlins win.    Hey Rob-what's the deal with New England?  Their a strange team.  Blown out by Buffalo.  Blow out Philly.  Eek by the Jets.  Get eeked out by Washington.  Out-gun Tennessee.  What's the pattern here?  Do they get out-gunned by the Giants next week?  God I hope not.  The Giants are so boring.  Big changes may be in the works for my brother.  Good changes.  Hopefully after tomorrow things will be fit to brag about.  I have an interview later this week  urlLink here .  They have two 5th grade openings, so we'll see what happens there.

      Welcome, weekend.  I'm still wondering where the end of summer went, but anyway, it's still nice out today.  I got a haircut this morning from the lovely amateurs at  Supercuts .  The girl I had today is usually pretty good, but she always cuts the back crooked-like, so I have to fix it.  It's fine if it's a little bit off, then I wouldn't care, but when it visibly slopes downward to the left, it looks sorta funny.    I went to the bank to attempt to cash my check from GHT, but there was a line out the door full of old people.  It must be social security check day.  Yup, it's the 3rd of the month, so I left because I probably would still be there since 10:30.    I'm listening to  Cursive  right now.  This is a very strange but good cd.  It has organs and cellos in abundance.  Very eerie.    My Red Sox prediction was wrong.  Boy do they suck.  How can they not score with that lineup.  Their lineup reminds me of an even better than the Jays of 93.  They have really no weak link, except for maybe in leadoff.  I guess pitching does win games, and their bullpen bites it big time.  Pizza night.  Tomorrow it's supposed to rain because we have a game to do.    I realized even more that I hate the South.  Folks in Richmond refused to name a street after tennis legend Arthur Ashe because of his skin color.  Fucking muffs.  Go buy a clue instead of a confederate flag.

      Hey folks, sorry for the long absence on my part.  My computer was diseased and being repaired for a few days, so I was without this piece of technology.  Let's take a look back to my weekend predictions from last Thursday.  The Bengals won, so that was nice, and Syracuse kicked Toledo's ass, which surprised me.  Either the Cuse is much better this year, or Toledo got lucky beating Pitt.  Anyway, Walter Reyes is one of the top backs in the nation, so I'm happy with their 3-1 start.   Did ya see my boy Shannon Stewart on Tuesday?  I know you probably did, but I had to rub it in a bit to the Yankee fans.  Also, I hope Arod doesn't win MVP because the (Texas) Rangers suck.  I also don't want Tejada to even get mentioned because he can suck my ass too.  If it's going to be a Yankee, then I hope it's Posada.  As long as Halladay gets his hardware.    Let's look ahead to this weekend.  Starting today, I hope they don't but I think the Yankees will win game 2, as well as the Sox.  On Sunday, the Bengals are at Buffalo, which is not good.  Takeo Spikes may decapitate anyone he tackles, and Corey Dillon is not playing.  However, Travis Henry is questionable, and may not play.  I'm gonna be bold and say the Bengals win again.  Call me crazy, but I have renewed faith in Jon Kitna and his receivers.  And I also don't think Buffalo is as good as I thought when the season started, especially after watching them the last 2 games.  I went on an interview yesterday for a teaching job, but couldn't tell you how I did, because the principal showed no emotion during the time I was there.  I'm supposed to find out by Weds if I made the final 4.  I saw my professor yesterday for a reference for grad school, so now I am done with my application process.  So now I wait to see if I get in. I got a letter yesterday telling me I was denied for financial aid, but I don't know why there was no mention of loans.  I have to call the financial aid office to figure out what the deal is.  On a delayed realization, I noticed it's October.  It didn't gradually get cooler, like ease into the low 70s or hi 60s, but it just became 60 and dropped into the 40s overnight.  What happened to the light jacket at night weather?  It's already feeling like hoodie weather.  Hey Den, what gives the hotel the right to call itself a "historic bordello?"  Was Lincoln a customer?  How about those Scarlet Knights, huh?  Putting up 30 a game.  Oh by the way William Paterson lost last weekend 67-0.

      It was nice seeing everyone last night, but we really missed Garet.  Anyway, it was cool catching up at dinner and going to the fabled  Town Pub  for their good grog.  We didn't see the folks we wanted to, but instead saw a couple of handfuls of high school classmates, most of which we didn't say a word to.  No real loss there.  One interesting note, however, was that the Crow walked into the bar at about 10.  He emitted a cold wall around him and sat down at the bar.  There was eerily a seat on either side of him unoccupied.  If everyone comes home again for Christmas, we should try to get out again, hopefully to a better eatery, and plan ahead a bit so my work schedule doesn't screw up the meeting time.  In other news, I realized I didn't ask anyone how their Thanksgiving was yesterday, so hopefully all went well, and hopefully Matt's trip to FL went smoothly...The Cuse plays RU today.  They'll probably lose, but even if they win, they probably won't get into a bowl game, which sucks because even though their record is not very good, they have a great runner and a pretty good qb that the nation should see.  Anyway, the Sixers remain in 1st despite their paltry 8-9 record.    It's windy today and I arrived at the conclusion that if it's not raining, then it's windy.  One thing that made me feel better about myself:  I read in the paper that people were waiting in parking lots of stores yesterday at 1 am for the stores to open at 5 am.  I wasn't one of those people, and never will be.

      Hello again, May I begin by telling Kim that your advisor appears to be an idiot. It's unfortunate when someone that is supposed to be helping you with your scholastic career never really takes the time to get to know you or at least look at your records and see what kind of student you are. Today was probably my most frustrating day at work yet. My supervisor has taken half days all this week, which isn't bad, except we've gotten hit with all sorts of new admissions, and while working with brain injured folks sounds like the most fun you could have ever, there are times when it can be a little bit tiresome. Just have to get through tomorrow though. I hope everyone's travels go smoothly and safely. Oh yeah, say hello to Bill at the Town Pub for me.

      Hello everyone,  I'll be flying home tomorrow for Thanksgiving.  Friday sounds like a good day to meet up.  I'll talk to the other half tonight and see what she says.  We can do the Alexus thing again like last winter break or just hang with Jarrett and Bill Rupp at the Town Pub.

      That stuff is messed up, Kim.  I hope the Dean gets things straightened out.  I think everyone should be given an opportunity to do what they want, regardless of what people think you can do.  This is ignoring the obvious fact that he's a dope who should see you're well prepared and have a better chance of success than the vast majority of people.  So why he thinks you can't succeed is pretty much a mystery to me, and somewhat mindblowing.    Anyhow, I'm comng to NJ for Thanksgiving.  I'm taking a greyhound in the middle of the night from Boston tonight.  I'll be in tommorrow morning.  It'll be good.  I'll call you Bri to see if we can meet sometime.  Blog out.    Happy Thanksgiving.

      So here's the update on my "What Should My Major Be?!?" saga...  I went to see my advisor today and he told me I was stupid.  Well not in those words really.  I asked him if the math class I was taking now could possibly count as a precal class and he said no way.  Ok.  Fine.  Whatever.  He then told me that I was not smart enough to take a Calculus class.  What the fuck?!? I don't mean to sound conceited, but does he have any clue who he is talking to?  I graduated high school with advanced calc.  I have pulled nothing but A's in all of my math classes to date.  I have a 3.8 GPA for crying out loud!!  He has some fucking nerve to say I'm not smart enough.  However, I did not say this to him to his face because I like to avoid confrontation at any cost.  Anyways, I sent an e-mail to the dean and told him what happened.  I wasn't mean to him at all but I did get my point across.  Let's see if this guy replies.  I know nothing will probably happen.  He'll tell me that he thinks I should talk to my advisor about what happened and work things out amongst ourselves.  It's also my word against the advisor's.  Guess who's side they'll take?  (Hint: It won't be mine)  This event has given me yet another reason to complain about Montclair.  Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad school but Stevens looks more and more tempting as the asses at Montclair continue to be.. well.. asses!

      Well, nothing new from the void known as Connecticut.  The gf and I saw  Lost in Translation  on Friday.  I loved it.  I had lunch in Boston on Saturday and did absolutely nothing but watch sports on Sunday.  I actually got to see the Rangers win a game...  This short week can't go fast enough.  I need to get out of here for awhile.  I will be in Bloomfield until Saturday morning, so I am game for dinner/drinks/whatever on Friday nite.

      I'm counting down the days until Thanksgiving.  I'm off on turkey day, work Friday, and then I'm off Sat & Sunday.  That's nice, except for Friday, but anyway.  If you actually are still coming home this weekend, perhaps we can do something Friday after I work(7 pm).  I have one of those throw-away cameras left over from vacation to Myrtle Beach.  Maybe I should finish it this weekend, since it's been sitting here on the desk for 4 months.  I also want to use my digital camera a bit, since I haven't been using that much either lately.  Hopefully I'll be hearing good news either today or tomorrow.  Montclair said I should know within a week, and today is a week.  In something related to school, my chiropractor told me I should sub again.  He says I should pick somewhere I want to work, get on the sub list and hopefully something will open up.  He says I'm young and healthy, so I should wing it for a while without insurance.  It sounds like a great possibility, however, I did this already earlier this year at Clifton and Livingston, and they didn't hire me back.  I also don't particularly like subbing, since it's like starting a new job every day.  I'll probably see after the new year, if I can last at my job until then.  I think I may be developing a cold(surprise), so I'm trying to drink lots and take extra vitamins and such.  Who knows if anything really helps.  I tried getting some sleep, but I can't seem to sleep late anymore.  Gotta be at work in about 3 hours, so I'm not too thrilled about that, except I won't have to watch the Giants-Bucs game tonite.  Gross.

        Elf was a pretty good movie.  Perfect for the holidays and Will Ferrell was perfect for that part.  I couldn't really think of anyone who could have done a better job than him.  I would recommend it to all.  So after some thinking, I think I'm going to stick to being a math major.  I had this epiphany in the middle of my Accounting class on Thursday morning.  As the professor was explaining how to journalize bed debt expenses, I thought to myself, "Wow.  This shit really sucks.  I have no desire to do this for the rest of my life.  It's just so freakin' boring."  So, after I had this change of heart, I made an appointment with my advisor for Monday in hopes he can answer some questions about scheduling for me.    I have some good news!  I spoke to my Calc professor on Thursday night and we were talking about my change to a math major.  I was planning on asking him about a possible internship of sorts at his company.  The guy beats me to it and comes right out and says, "I would love to give you a job."  Well thats fine by me!  I would start in January or February as a financial planner in training.  If that's what you want to call it.  He said the job is pretty fast paced and intense.  This is ok with me since I do absolutely nothing where I work now.  The only downside is that the job is in NYC.  Oh well.  I'll get over it.    Now it's time for me to get ready to go to Red Lobster.  Mmmm.. Cheddar bay biscuits, cesaer salad, and lots of garlic-y shrimp.

      It's a rare weekend blog.  I couldn't sleep as late as I had planned, so I went surfing this morning.  I found the Sixers lost to the Knicks last nite.  Wha?  I deleted my 60 junk mails.  I decided to blog because I'm bored.    Last nite, Kim & I saw  Elf .  It was pretty funny.  It wasn't exactly what I was expecting, though.  I didn't know what to expect, actually, but I figured it would be more of a Will Ferrell-type comedy, and it was more of a cutesy-type of comedy.  It had some extremely funny parts, all while staying with relatively clean humor.  To make it better, the Allwood theater dropped their ticket prices back down to $6 from $8.  That was nice.  Today I'm going to lunch with Kim and her mother.  Red Lobster is our destination, and we haven't been there in a while.  I'm sure we'll have to wait 3 hours from all the damn religious people going there after chuch.  Since my fiasco on Thursday nite, the Vandals have gone 2-1.  I replayed my game with Philly and lost a heartbreaker 28-21.  I then rattled off 2 in a row with wins over the first place Jets(Wha?) and Patriots.  I smushed the Jets' rushing attack, and had a nice game with newly acquired starting QB Jeff Blake.  He was acquired for Chris Chandler and Larry Centers.  I then had a good rushing game from Brian Westbrook against New England.  His first carry went 79 yards for a TD and tied the game after the Pats opening game drive, which resulted in a David Patten TD reception.  I ended up actually holding NE on a few drives, which is the first time I was able to play good defense(or maybe they just played poor offense, but whatever).  Anywho, I'm 2-2 now and sitting in a tie for second in the AFC East.

      I've got to tackle a few things before the week ends.  First, my brother was on tv, as Den mentioned, because he has been a fill-in for WFAN doing the 20/20 sports flash.  He was on tv because the YES network airs Mike & the Maddog, and he was doing the flash during that time slot.  It's pretty cool hearing him...  Next, Montclair found my scores.  They actually found them the same day I blogged, but I hadn't had time to blog.  More incompetence in this world...  Third, I purchased a new game for my PS2(I know have 3 games!).  I got NFL Gameday 2004 just yesterday.  It's pretty hard so far.  I played one game with the Bengals yesterday and got obliterated, but I didn't get mad because I knew I would suck.  I decided to play another game to see if maybe I got the hang of it, but ended up turning it off in the first quarter.  I read the instruction booklet fully and found the game has a cool feature in which you can create your own expansion team-design the uniform, logo, etc.  Pretty cool!  So I created the NJ Vandals with some bad-ass brown uni's and a pirate-type logo on the helmet.  Anyway, there's an expansion draft where you select the rubbish left unprotected by the current NFL teams.  It was pretty realistic because the people available were horrible.  I can list my "stars" of the team: Brian Westbrook, Chad Morton, Freddie Mitchell, Willie McGinest, and Darrien Gordon.  Ugh.  My QBs are Brooks Bollinger, Chris Chandler, and Scott Covington.  Who?  Yeah.  So I did my draft and played a game and got beat by the Texans, but hung tough.  I think I lost 31-21.  It's very difficult to pass, because the controls are sensitive, plus Brooks Bollinger is my QB, remember?  I decide to play game 2 against the Eagles.  They score on the first play-a 80 some odd yard pass to James Thrash.  Once they get past your LBs, they're gone.  Slowness.  I get the ball and start running the shit out of it.  Westbrook had 170 yards, Lamont Warren had 130, and Dee Brown had 40.  I couldn't stop them, plus they had a KR, but when I kept running, the game stayed close.  I'm down 21-10 at half.  Get the ball to start the 3rd, and continue running and hold the ball for 4 of the 5 minutes in the quarter before hitting Freddie Mitchell with a 5 yard slant for a TD.  Lamont Warren up the middle gets me 2.  21-18.  They come back and score in less than 2 minutes because Jon Ritchie is faster than my team.  Anyway, roughly 4 minutes left in the game.  I know I can win.  I've been running all day, so if I eat up the clock and get down there, I can at least tie it and not let them get much time.  I run and run and run and punch it in with 15 seconds left.  You're thinking, "He's still gonna lose somehow."  Wrong, I hold on to win!  Woo!  First win for the Vandals.  Post-game, I'm checking out my roster to see if there are any free agents, and the game freezes.  My victory is gone, my 400 rush yards gone.  Man was I pissed.  So that long ass blog you just read technically does not exist.  Sorry.  So the game is pretty fun at least when you can eat the clock.  Otherwise, I would be destroyed.  Totally bummed about the lost info, man.  I may try to play again before bed if I don't fall asleep.  Peace out.

      Hi to everyone, even Dennis.  I'm in lab right now, basically struggling to stop myself from running far far away.  Optical alignment I don't like.  Honestly, there isn't much lab work I actually do like.  Anyhow, I used to do it pretty well, so I'll get used to it again.  Anyhow, my project is starting to take shape, though finishing it in time might mean not coming home for Thanksgiving.  I have quite a bit to do, and not alot of time left, as my productivity most of this semester has been...  not ideal.  I'll keep you posted about next week.  Go Bengals!  Jon Kitna and Johnson and Johnson and Johnson are good stuff.  They've got a good shot at winning the division if they can get through this tough road stretch with 2 victories.  The division is theirs if they can.  I'm just happy seeing them play competitive ball again.  I'm also happy that the Steelers and Raiders blow.  I've also never been much of a Miami fan, not terribly suprising.  I can see the Pats making the playoffs as possible this year, which is really all I can ask as a fan.  Since they've actually won a superbowl, i'd like the franchise to stay solid for a little while to make the championship look more valid.  Anyway, I think Eugene Wilson might be my new favorite player.  I know probably nobody else gets to watch him, but as a corner turned safety, he's done everything pretty well, including tackling and especially hitting.  Those are only noteworthy when considering that he can cover as well as a cornerback too.  Enough football.  Basketball, I think I'm the only person not super surprised that the Bucks are actually ok.  The talent level isn't the greatest, but at least they have some youth and no super-egos destroying any sense of team.  See ya later Mason (aka the worst thing to happen to professional basketball ever)  Ummm.....  gonna go do some work now or something.  Blog out

      Hey Brian.  Congrats to your brother and the Bengals!  My parents saw him on TV yesterday and the Bengals are in 1st place at the end of November (crazy).  At least they are more exciting to watch then the Dolphins.  As for the Nets, the slow start is bothersome, but Boston is only 5-5 in 1st place and as far as I am concerned the Celtic can't compete with the Nets.  The Western Conference is once again loaded, so I wsih the Nets would start playing to thier expectations.  it's funny how two straight trips to the Finals makes someone want more.  5 years ago, I was content with a playoff berth.  Well, I'm off to watch The Towers: Extended Edition See you in about 4 hours!

      Just stopping by to pass on a tidbit of information.  If any of you miss Opie & Anthony, go to  urlLink www.live365.com  and search for a station called WHIV.  They play nothing but whole O&A shows.  You will have to register for the site, but it's free and worth it to hear O&A again, even if they are repeats.

      Well, I'm back earlier than expected to complain.  I called  urlLink Montclair State  this morning to find out my status of my application.  They tell me they never received my GRE scores.  Wow, that's great!  I emailed them 2 weeks ago to make sure they had all my info, and they never emailed me back.  So I call ETS to make sure they sent the scores to the right address and confirmed the scores were sent on October 3rd to the exact address the guy gave me at Montclair.  "They could have been lost in the mail," he says.  Well that's great, but maybe you could have told me about this so I haven't been waiting for 2 months for nothing.  So know they're "checking" the office and are supposed to call me back, yeah right.  UN-FUCKING-BELIEVABLE!  Forget about the Red Sox and the curse of the bambino.  My name is cursed.  I'll probably find out that the 100 resumes I sent out have been "lost in the mail" as well.  Oh yeah, I wanted to sleep a bit today, but was scared out of my sleep when two cars crashed directly outside my window at 6:30 this morning.  Well, I got my haircut, so that's something I wanted to do.

      Wow, it was like a friggin' reunion here on the blogger.  Everyone checked in.  What a nice surprise.  Den-thank you for the in-depth retrospective on your journey to N'awleans.  Bam!  Kev-thank you for your input on the Matrix, however, I still don't plan on seeing it.  Matt-thank you for checking in and giving me my vacation destination for 2004.  Warm Springs, here we come!  Rob-thank you for your predictions.(Cincy 28, KC 20=really damn close)  As for those Bengals, how about the team actually being .500 in November, and to better that feat, they are in first friggin' place!  Rudi Johnson again comes up big with 160 yards rushing.  Jon Kitna threw zero INTs, and Peter Warrick is developing into the player he was at Florida State.  Good things come to those who wait, and I've waited 14 years.  Suddenly, the playoffs are not far off from reality, but I will not be disappointed if they finish with a .500 record and fail to make the playoffs.  They are playing close and their offense is scoring.  They'd probably be fun to watch, but lord knows we can't see the Bengals on television, only Jets and Giants.  No bathroom, only Klau Kulash.  Tomorrow I return to working my Monday nite shift.  Woo boy am I excited.  The only positive thing that may come out of that is if I am able to get my haircut tomorrow morning before work.  I have a shaggy dog atop my cranium, and it's no fun.  I gotta call Montclair to see what's up with grad school as well.  I haven't heard a peep, and they never responded to my email from 2 weeks ago.  If time remains, I have to clean out the trunk of my car.  It tends to leak.  Not like "Oh, it's a bit damp from the monsoon we just encountered."  More like "Oh, there's a swamp forming under my spare tire and there's some wildlife inhabiting the pond."  My tire jack is rusted, as is my tire iron.  The rim of my spare is rusted a bit, and there's a slime on the tire itself.  Not a pretty sight or smell.  I discarded the carpet at the end of the summer because it was ruined, and now I don't want the entire trunk to rust through.  In other news, I realized I have an abundance of cds I never listen to, and probably never will because I don't like them.  I have an urge to buy some new ones, but I haven't had much luck in buying stuff that I'm unfamiliar with.  I may go browse around right now actually, since I'm not too tired.  I'll be back probably mid-week to whine about work I'm sure and maybe other things that are pissing me off.  Here's a possible preview: traffic, weather, the Rangers, my paycheck.

      Hello all, Back from New Orleans.  Great food; oysters, shrimp, catfish, po boys, bread pudding, all spicy!!  The conference was good too.  Over 30,000 neuroscientists.  I actually had a Nobel laureate stop by my poster and tell me I was a doing a good job.  FYI, the Nobel Prize is equivalent to making the Hall of Fame for science.  That was pretty exciting.  Now, time to explain the nightlife.  Day 1-Head to Bourbon St.  Immediately stop by Patty O'Brien's for some hand grenades (from Kev's recommendation).  After 4 hand grenades, I realize I am extremely drunk.  Walk down Bourbon St and see some great sights from the ladies (hint hint) at the balcony of the Sonesta hotel.  Have 2 more hurricanes and proceed to dry heave in my hotel.  Pass out on the bathroom and wake up at 12.  Day 2-Wake up at noon and get lunch.  After the conference, we decide to go to Harrah's for drinks and gambling.  I played blackjack for a while and win $140.  Of course we have to celebrate.  Enter Bourbon St.  After another blur of a night, we get back to our hotel at 4:30.  Sleep for a few hours then go to the conference  Day 3-After the conference, we head to Cafe Du Monde for some chickory coffee and beignets.  After a tasty meal, I go back for an early sleep since I have to present my data the next day.  BTW, we stop by Harrah's and I lose $20  Day 4-Poster session went awesome.  I had a lot of important people in the field check out my data and I got a lot of positive feedback.  My old boss was there and she took me out to Nola's (Emeril's restaurant) for lunch.  I had some awesome gumbo and jambayla.  We then go to the Acme Oyster Bar for dinner.  After shucking lots of oysters, we hang out on Bourbon St once again.  I stick to Abita beer and have a good time.  BTW, we stop by Harrah's and I lose $20 (notice a pattern here)  Day 5-Grad students from the Univ of Colorado-Boulder have a huge house party in the Garden District.  Big mansion and lots of free beer  Stay there until 4 and come back.  On1y 1 day left in the Big Easy :(  BTW, we stop by Harrah's and I lose $20.  Day 6-Last day in New Orleans.  We have a lesiurely day and night, since we are all flying out early the next day.  All the guys in my program decide to stop by the Barely Legal club for some entertainment, which was very interesting.  BTW, we stop by Harrahs, and I come out even!!!!  Day 7-Say goodbye to New Orleans.  All in all, a great trip!! Thanks to UNC for picking up the tab!!    Anyway, I will be back for Thanksgiving from Wed-Mon, if anyone wants to hang out (even Rob)    Kevin-thanks for telling me what to drink in N.O. (my stomach does not thank you though)  Finally, as for school.  In my situation, I started off in science and wanted to go to med school.  I realized that I didn't want to do it and ended up in psychology.  I then decided psych was not enough since everyone has psych degrees.  I then worked in a lab and sort of went back to biology.  Now I enjoy what I do.  I look at behavior and what goes on in the brain.  So I basically combined psych and bio together.  Basically, maybe combine math and business and become a consultant.  That way, you get money and enjoy what you do.  Wow,  that was a big blog for me!  Talk to everyone latter, have a good weekend!!

      Good bloggy morning to you all.  As promised, I am back with my review of  Matrix: Revolutions .  Here goes:  It wasnt all that bad.  I would say it was better than  Reloaded .  They left out a major portion of the philosophy that killed  Reloaded .  This was more of a straight forward action movie.  Per usual, the movie was visually stunning and the acting was atrocious.  It gives good closure to the trilogy.  My only major complaint, other than the acting or dialogue, was the fact that in order to understand the movie completely you have to see the first and second movies, plus the  Animatrix  and the end of the Matrix video game.  All in all, I would not recommend you run out and see it immediately; but I would not try and dissuade you from seeing it if you told me you were planning to do so.   And I guess I will add my $0.02 to the whole Stevens/major/life thing.  As for Rob's comments on Stevens, I agree with all of them except for the part about the established programs versus the small programs.  I was in an established program (mechanical engineering) and there was a lot more bullshit and too much structure in that program.  Since it was "established", they basically told you that had to take course A,B, and C and that you could choose one or two "electives" from a list of courses X,Y,and Z.  There was basically zero leeway in making your schedule.  Where as the smaller majors had a lot more flexibility in their scheduling, but that puts more pressure on the student to make good decisions.  Wherever you were to go school, just make sure that you major in something you truly enjoy.  I majored in something that I was proficient in, not necessarily something I really like.  That was probably my biggest mistake.  I thought about job opportunities and compared that to what I was good at, and that's how I came up with my major.  Not a good way to do it.  My best suggestion to any one still in school is to find an internship at a place that would be similar to the work you would be doing after you graduate; and make sure you enjoy it.  You do not want to be stuck the rest of your working life in a career you dont like.  That's enough out of me.  I hope this day goes by quickly, because Meredith and I are going to see Boston's own, Dropkick Murphys at the Webster Theatre in Hartford.  I cant wait.  I am almost as giddy as a school girl...

      Greetings and Salutations, I am currently even further south, residing in Warm Springs, Georgia, and yes, as small as you can imagine the town to be, it's even smaller. I have to drive about 15 minutes to get cell phone reception and to do any grocery shopping. The rehab hospital I'm interning at is pretty cool though, and there are plenty of other interns around so it's not terribly boring all the time. What I do fear is that I will undoubtedly be an alcoholic by the time this internship is over. The last two Fridays, the drinking has started at around 6 pm, only because there is nothing else to do on Friday night, except maybe go to the one of two places in town that sell alcohol and drunkenly sing karaoke along with the locals and their three good teeth and immaculately maintained mullets.  Unfortunately, I will not be home for Thanksgiving, I only have Thursday off, so I'm taking a personal day Friday and going down to Florida to see dear old dad. So, no NJ for me until Christmas, I booked my flight yesterday actually. One nice thing about the location, I'm only about an hour and 20 from Atlanta, so I at least can enjoy some good concerts. Went up on Monday and saw Thursday, Thrice, and Coheed and Cambria. It made me happy, even if I had to drive extra slow once I got on the backwoods roads to get back to Warm Springs, first to avoid running over multiple deer and second, I don't want Sheriff Roscoe pulling over my out of state vehicle and have me wind up rotting in some 10'x10' local jail cell for the next 25 years. Big ups to Bri for the Big League Chew reference, it was nice!

      Thanks for the input on Stevens.  I really do appreciate it.  I e-mailed the advisor in the math department at Montclair today to set up an appointment to ask him a few questions.  Now all I have to do is sit back and wait for a reply or figure what his office hours are and harass him then.  I know I probably won't be 100 percent about what major to take until I'm already working and that is unfortunate but that's the way cookie crumbles.  As a matter of fact my current math professor made a very strong suggestion about me working for him in the future.  It would defintely be nice to work with him as a financial analyst/advisor.  He's an awesome professor (this is my second time taking one of his classes) and he seems to be an all around nice guy.  Even if it's just to get some experience I think it would be worthwhile.   Well I have to go study some more for a test tomorrow.  Thank god there's only 5 weeks left in the semester.  But then there's 2 more years to go.  Sigh.

      I, three will be in Jersey for Thanksgiving, as always.  I'm going to be at my brother's house Thurs, and rumor has it my boss wants me in at 6:30 am on Friday, so I shouldn't be working that late on Friday.  I don't have a game that Saturday, either, so I'm game for a shindig.  I will know more as the time approaches.  I also appreciate the input you guys gave to Kim (as I'm sure she appreciates it too).  I want her to be happy, but like Rob said, I told her to find out as much as possible about the program, wherever it may be.  Kev, the news was on the F2F site, and they emailed me, so I think it's for real.  It is really sad.  When I got home from work tonite, I wanted to get a haircut.  I wanted to call to make sure they were open and there wasn't a wait, and sure enough when I called, I found out they were closed.  Supercuts isn't so super are they?  I'm trying to figure out when I can go, because I won't have time Saturday morning.  I think they open at 9, and I have to leave for work at 9:30.  I don't want to work with stray hairs itching my neck all day.  As of now, my only option is to go Sunday morning, that is, if they are open.  I am so relieved tomorrow is Friday.  I just want to chill and not have to wear a tie again until Monday.  If I don't be bloggin', then hope y'all have a fun-filled weekend.

      Smell ya later?  awesome.  I feel compelled to comment on Stevens.  It is wicked expensive.  But mortaging your life away is sometimes feasible with government loans and maybe in state grants.  I remember that Kevin and I both ended up with some weird state grant in our financial aid packages.  Also, I'm like seriously in debt still, but government loans are more flexible and have lower rates I think.  All I know is that i can keep deferring them until I finish school.  So, I don't know how practical it is, but still possible.    As for the school itself, its a pretty good school, but its still kinda small.  The established programs or ones with lots of people (i.e. not physics) are easier to deal with the red tape since there is a better support system.  This is something I would have changed if i could go back and do it again.    Also, if you really enjoy math, I say go for it wherever you are.  Pretty much all technical careers (science, engineering, business, law, accounting, etc.) are going to have boing aspects to them sometimes, if due to nothing else other than the fact that you must deal with practically the issues in front of you, not necessarily the other aspects.  It's just that some fields have less of that than others and it really depends on your own personal tastes and interests.  Just remember that when dealing with something like your own interests, it never hurts to get as much information as possible.  You'll never be 100% certain probably, but you'll get an idea or feeling that might be useful.

      Afternoon, ladies and gents, I'll keep this brief...  - I hope you're joking about Face to Face, Bri.  If they broke up, I am offically saddened.  At least I got to see them for the first (and I guess only) time at the Warped Tour this past summer.    - Work sucks (but at least I get a paycheck twice a month), and I miss Stevens.  Ok, I actually miss Hoboken, but nonetheless...  - I love the fact that all of the sports teams I like are mediocre this winter.  Is it Spring Training yet?  - I will be seeing Matrix:Revolutions tonite with some friends.  I am only going because they all want to go and I dont feel like sitting on my futon alone tonite.  I'll give a review tomorrow.  - I too will be in Jersey for Thanksgiving (probably Wednesday nite til Saturday morning).  Give my cellphone or parents' house a ring if any of you would like to get together.  Smell ya later...  ::End Transmission::

      Hello to everyone in the merry land of bloggers!  New Jersey is being hit with some brutal weather today, or at least it's being predicted.  The wind is ridiculous.  As I was walking to my class this morning, my glasses almost flew off of my face.  That would have looked pretty funny if it happened. hehe.  Anyway, it was like being in Oz.  All I was missing was Toto and some sidekicks missing various body parts.  As I was taking my accounting test, the windows were shaking and several people got up in the middle of the test to sit away from the windows.  Crazy huh?  I hear the winds are only supposed to get stronger and we might get some rain.  Hopefully, the winds will knock down all power lines on campus so I won't have to go to my night class.  Gee, can you tell I'm with Rob in my "I hate school" attitude?   Since we're on the topic of school, I am considering ditching the idea of a business degree and sticking with my math major.  I think that I could have more job possiblilties with a math major.  As Brian told me, "Business is boring."  I think he may be right.  Working for the NSA or NASA would be much more interesting.  I have also considered applying to Stevens again, but I don't think it would be possible for me to go there for several reasons: 1) the commute would suck, 2) I need to work a lot to pay bills, 3) living on campus would be nice but it's expensive (as if the tuition wasn't enough to scare you), 4) i would have to quit my current job(where I have job security and decent pay) and find a new one closer to campus.  As much as I would love to go to Stevens, I don't think it would be the best thing for me to do at this point.  Maybe if I win the lottery I can go.  Besides, they require you to take 6 gym classes.  I've been bitching about taking one gym class at Montclair!  I couldn't imagine taking 6.    Peace out fellow bloggers!

      Hey y'all.  I just found out another one of my favorite bands is over.   urlLink Face to Face  has officially called it quits after something like 13 years or so.  I'm extremely sullen, especially since I really liked their last cd.  Bummer...  Had a poop day today at work.  We'll leave it at that.  In reply to Rob-I am glad the Bengals have someone who talks smack, because they need an attitude to portray their team.  I don't know whether it will fire up the Chiefs, but I don't think the Chiefs really need to get fired up since they're undefeated.  I actually believe the Bengals have a real good chance of knocking them off, especially at Paul Brown.  And so what if Chad comes out wrong after the game;  they've got nothing to lose.  The rest of the AFC North is also not very good or consistent.  At least the Bengals have been playing hard all season.  As for the Pats-I truly feel they will dismantle the Cowboys.  I'm sorry, but I think their start was an illusion only made more appealing because of their fat coach.  Quincy Carter is shit, and yes, their defense is good, but the Pats seem to be playing with a mission in mind.  I haven't heard anything recent by the Strokes, and the only thing I know about them is that I was sick of hearing about them when their last cd was out and how they were saving rock and roll.  But I have heard many positive things about their new stuff, so I'm glad you're enjoying it.  I haven't heard much new music, I guess because I listen to Q104.  Is Sparta back from seeing boobies in NO yet?  Waiting patiently for his review.  And also his take on the Nets slow start.  What is the deal?(In an annoying Seinfeld voice)  That's all for now.  See ya.

       urlLink I still love the teen girl squad.   Hi Folks  I haven't blogged in quite some time.  I decided to get you up to date on important things.  Lets see...  I still have a poster of Gigli up on my wall.  I don't think its quite as funny anymore.  In fact, I'm weirding myself out now.  My project has gone nowhere in about a month due to my not doing much with it.  I am off tommorrow and intend to spend the day there.  I pretty much hate my school, so my aversion to being there is my main obstacle to tackle.  However, I can spend all day tommorrow there.  I'm thinking about looking into working at the patent office or something.  I get to use my science and engineering background, but not have to work in a lab.  I'll look into it.    I think the third Matrix movie probably sucks ass, but I won't see it since I thought the first was ok at best and the second blew.  I did catch Elf sorta randomly and thought it has some funny parts for sure.  Overall, thumbs up for a Christmas movie.  I haven't left my house for days due to the overbearing fear of being permeated my immense amounts of christmas music.  Does not that assault on our ears start soon?  Ok, maybe later.  I was joking about not leaving the house though.  Or was I?  Yes, I was.    I like the new Strokes CD.  It reminds me of the Cars vaguely with the almost keyboard-guitars and sort of backbeat on some of the songs.  I was kinda afraid it would blow, but I think lyrically its still pretty solid.  Musically, its similar to the first obviously, but there is enough variety to suit me in the song to song variations.  In particular, I enjoy 'Under Control' for its smoothness, 'What ever Happened?' and 'Reptilia' for weird chord progressions on the chorus ( I think thats what I'm describing. ), 'I can't win' overall, and '12:51' since it mentions 40's.    Bri, What do you think of Mr. Johnson's bold prediction?  I hear various media pundits saying how it was such a bad thing and that it will motivate the Chiefs, but I don't think that will necessarily be the case.  I think the Orange and Black need to stay fired up and bold, at least I hope so.  Seriously, the Chiefs can't be the best team in football anyway, can they?  Maybe they are, but I don't trust their defense yet.  We'll see in the playoffs.  Anyway, my Pats look good through their bye.  This week the Tuna will come back and people will make another big deal out of it.  Its been long enough that there are hardly any players left here from his tenure (Law, atta-boy Troy, Bruschi, McGinest, Johnson) and none of them are exactly preoccupied with their first years in the league.  Two over-acheiving teams playing on Sunday night should be entertaining even if the media plays up the same boring angles all over again. (Belichick-Parcells; Parcells-Kraft; Glenn sucking for everyone but Parcells; Parcells' daughter being married to Scott Pioli, the Pats co-GM essentially;and Parcells being God)  I think they should play up Eugene Wilson playing solid as a rookie at a position never played before this year, or Dat Nguyen being great all of a sudden, or the fact that Quincy Carter still isn't very great.  Anyhow, I'll watch it on Sunday night.  My predition: Pats 28- 'Boys 20.    As for the Kansas Cityans, Cincy 28- Chefs 20.  I'll be in NJ for Thanksgiving.  If anyone is around, I'd like to get together with anyone, except that dirty dirty Sparta and his perverse ways.  Ok, maybe even Sparta.    Bloggedy Blog Blog.

      Usually, I'm working at this time on Monday nights, but today my schedule was different for some reason, so I worked my normal 9-5:30 shift.  I don't think I have off this Thursday because my boss already hinted at this.  I believe last week it was 80.  Today it reached 45, and Wednesday, it's back up to 65.  That's some nice consistency there boys.  Hopefully tomorrow Roy Halladay will be named the AL Cy Young winner.  He definitely deserves it after the trooper he was for the Jays this past season.  We shall see.  Bengals 4-5!  Next week they have the Chiefs-the undefeated Chiefs.  Yikes!  I'm scared.  I believe they can win, but I'm afraid of the score if they have an off game.    Still haven't heard from Rutherford for that teacher assistant position, but today was the deadline to send in your info, so hopefully they'll call me.  I plan on spending Thanksgiving with my family at my brother's house, even if I'm scheduled to work.  I already tried to tell my one boss about my plans, but she never really gave me any answer or response, so if I don't get this teaching thing and I'm still at my current place of employment, I'm at least going to see my girlfriend, my parents, my grandmother, and my bro and sis-in-law.  It's the middle of November, so I'm pondering Christmas and its awful shopping necessities.  I'm not looking forward to spending the little money I have, but I've done it every other year, right?  I'm somewhat tired, so I'm probably gonna go watch some tv and go to bed early tonite to be rested for the remainder of the week.  Later.

      College sucks!  I've been having doubts lately about school.  I'm at a point where  i just don't care anymore.  I don't know if it's because i get up really early for classes and I'm just too damn tired to care or if I am truly fed up with my institution of higher learning.  Oh well.  I'll just have to deal with it, right?  In other news, it's cold in NJ again!  It was 70 degrees last week and then 3 days later - BOOM -back down to 40 degrees.  The trend of everyone getting sick is slowly returning and the germs will soon be traveling through the vents at work.  It kinda reminds of that movie Outbreak, but there's no monkey.    Brian said he's going to take me and my mom to Red Lobster next week.  What a guy!  I can't wait to eat lots of shrimp and those delectable cheddar bay biscuits.    Adios fellow bloggers!

      Because I didn't mention it when I posted the other night...Tom Brady is one sick QB.  If there was a way to bet on the Pats when down in the 4th quarter, I would do it hands down.  Tomorrow is my day off.  Woo!  I feel like an elderly person on Wednesday nights because I'm always fatigued and my back hurts.  I'll explain why my back hurts, so if you don't want to know then skip to the next paragraph.  My boss climbs a large ladder to reach the stock of Christmas candy that we are putting out for sale.  He proceeds to drop/throw these boxes full of candy from 2 stories up into my paws.  No you may think,"God you pussy, it's only candy."  Here's my argument:  the boxes of candy contain twenty-four 10 oz bags(24 x 10=240 oz; 240/16=15  pounds).  It's like catching a bowling ball over and over again.  So my upper back is strained a bit, despite using my legs to support the weight like you're supposed to...  As per the recommendation of Dennis and Rob, I am currently reading  The Corrections .  I'm going at snail's pace, because I only read it when I'm doing my traction at night(that's the technical term for hanging my head and neck in a sling to correct my horrible posture and keep my spine from becoming igor the hunchback).  It's quite humorous, but not in a funny ha-ha way, rather a funny intellectual way.  I am enjoying it so far, but I have much to go.  I'm on page 70, so have about 500 more pages to go.    As for Kevin's comment, I thought otherwise of your hand grenade comment at first, but then realized you were talking about New Orleans.  Duh!  How about those Rangers, though?  Huh? [nudge] Huh?  They are actually enjoyable to watch again, Kev!  As for other news, I miss Matt's presence around here.  I hope he's spreading his healing touch to the folks down south...You know what I haven't had in a long time?  Big League Chew.  If that makes no sense to you, then just let it go...  I'll blog to all of you blogs tomorrow.  Have a good blog.  Blog out, yo.

      Home from my late night of work:a 2-11 shift.  I cannot even tell you how many people came in between 9 and 11 and bought cigarettes.  Don't these people know that shit kills you?  And they willingly fork over $5-$6 per pack.  Anyway, it was madd hot out yo.  It felt like it reached 80, but I don't know what it actually hit.  Hot nonetheless, especially for November.    Now I must go to bed in order to be at work for 9 tomorrow.  Truck day, so lots of lifting and sweating.  Woo!  In case I forget, Den, have a blast in the Big Easy, and say hi to George Lynch for me.

      Hello all, Halloween was great down here.  They close off UNC and everybody is out in costume.  There was 75,000 people here this year.  First we went to my friend Garret's house where we had a cool Halloween party.  He has a bunch a DJ equipment.  Yours truly was spinning Outkast followed by Radiohead and other cool tunes.  After that, we went downtown with the masses.  All in all pretty cool.  This Wenesday, a bunch of us are going to see Matrix Revolutions on the IMAX.  I know most of you think Reloaded was crap, but on 2nd viewing, it wasn't as bad as I once thought.  If anyone has looked at the college basketball polls, UNC is ranked #10 with 1 first place vote.  Should be a pretty good year after our football disaster.  The Strokes new album is pretty good.  Definetly an indie vibe even though there are on a major label  Only 4 days till New Orleans!!! Hurricanes (the drink), voodoo, and the Hornets all in one city!!!  Talk to everyone later after my trip to the Big Easy!!!

      Weekend over.  Well, almost.  Monday begins the first full week of November, and insists it will be a warm, mid-70s day.  I will spend this day working until 11 pm.  My my how this weekend flew by.  Friday nite's party at  Liz 's house was a nice way to begin the weekend.  Saturday's late football start allowed me to get an extra hour of sleep before working on a very pleasant day, and Sunday allowed some quality time with  Kim .  I'm applying for a teacher assistant position in Rutherford, which is full time and offers benefits.  If all goes well, then I will probably jump ship from my current position.  I will feel bad for doing such a thing, because Kim's mom was kind enough to get me into a working environment after months of unemployment.  However, Liz told me I have to do what's best for me, and that makes sense, and believe it or not, it's not something I hear often.  I will probably go more into this topic if I hear about this position, but for right now, I'm gonna shut up and try not to jinx myself.  I searched for a couple hours online for teaching postitions and found a few more long-term sub positions that start in January, so there are still some possibilities.  I thought I'd given up hope on teaching, but I'm finally seeing some ads.  Hopefully, I will get some responses from this batch.  In sports-Bengals lost an important game, but I had a bad feeling because they were the favorites and were due for a letdown.  The Sixers probably need Big Dogg because their offense is horrible-scratch that-Aaron McKie is horrible.  I used to love the guy, but he's not the same player he was when they made it to the finals a few years ago.    I'm getting tired.  Keep your fingers crossed for this teaching thing.

      Ok, I'm back.  After our disastrous trip to SC this past summer, Kim and I decided not to go on vacation this year because of our lack of funds.  However, we also realized that we would be working our tails off in school this coming semester and working.  Yeah, we won't have a ton of money, but as we get older, we still won't have a lot of money to go away with, because we'll take on more responsibilities as we earn more money.  My brother had said this to me as well.  If we don't go and just say frig it, then we'll never go.  Yeah, we may not be swimming in our coin like Scrooge McDuck, but if we can't have fun when we're young, then when will we?  So we have a bunch of ideas brewing, but do understand we can't go overboard.  Sure we'd love to go to Italy or Hawaii, but in reality, that's a bit too much.  We could probably do Arizona or possibly even Florida, depending on the Disney packages available.  Heck, we briefly discussed going to the shore, but we'd end up spending just as much down there as we would elsewhere, and it's already been done.  I did some preliminary research on flights, and found Phoenix to be not so affordable at $350 round trip, and Orlando at $225 round trip.  Disney packages are quite snooty, but I ordered info so I can decide which aspects we can do without.  I don't mind either trip, but we would probably go in May, so we could avoid the dead of summer in both instances and not die in the desert or the Magic Kingdom.  More details to come as they come to me.

      With one meaningless game in progress, the NFL playoff brackets are official.  I looked back on my preseason predictions and strengthened my beliefs in my not betting on sports.  Here's what I got right... Surprise team: Seattle(had them finishing second behind St. Louis, but missing playoffs) AFC Playoff teams: NE, Tenn, KC NFC Playoff teams: GB, Philly, St. Louis AFC Champ: Tenn over NE Super Bowl: Tenn vs. Philly  OK, so I didn't do very well, but that's fine.  The Bengals put a serious damper on my outlook by losing a poorly-played, must-win game.  I digress, however, because they weren't even supposed to compete this year, and Marvin Lewis gave them 6 more wins than last year.  8-8 is not a bad starting point.  In other playoff related news, Minnesota choked again, which is pretty sad after the start they had.  Here's what next week looks like...  Tenn @ Baltimore Den @ Indy Sea @ GB Dal @ Car  I'm going against my word and picking.  I'm going with Baltimore(unless McNair plays), Denver, GB, and Carolina.  If this holds true, the matchups would be...  Den @ NE Balt @ KC GB @ Phi Car @ St.Louis  I would take NE, KC, Philly, and Carolina in those games.  Then Philly and NE in the Big game, with NE winning because of Philly's injury problems and NE being a complete team.

      Merry Christmas boys and girls!  I hope Santa was good to all y'all.  I got many nice and needed things: *a new coat! *belt *wallet *two dress shirts with ties *3 shirts *one bear *Alias Season 2 DVD *Simpsons Hit & Run for PS2 *a cold *my car leaking even more than before  I think that's everything so far, but I feel like I left something off...Hmm.  Anyway, plans for today include Kim's house for dinner with her family.  To my Grandmother's house(Nanna) for dessert and more gift exchanging, then home to get depressed about another Christmas going by too quickly and having to work tomorrow.  Enjoy the rest of your day.  Hopefully I'll be talking to all of you.

      So much to cover on today's version of the blog.  Let's start with the past first.  This weekend was a pretty enjoyable one.  No work, ate good, and had fun.  Saturday involved me, Kim, Liz, and Kim's mom going to Red Lobster to celebrate the birthday of Kim's mom(which is actually today).  Planned time to depart was 1pm.  Skepticism arose on my part because it was a Saturday, and the last Saturday before Christmas, and Red Lobster is on Route 46, just before the mall.  I feared sitting in a parking lot of traffic and waiting for hours to get a table.  Surprise, surprise!  Not much in terms of traffic, and when we got there, it was pretty empty.  We ate some dirty seafood and dessert and left for home around 3.  We dropped of Kim's mom and then took Liz home because we had to prepare for day 2 of the weekend.  P.S.-Sorry I missed your call Den, but as you can see I wasn't really home.  I don't believe the game went to 3 OTs...Anyway, I needed some warm, wool socks, which I'll explain in a minute why.  Consensus said to go to Kmart.  We went and they didn't have any wool socks, so I just got a pack of worker's socks with extra padding.  We return to Kim's place so she can pack up some stuff and back to my house so I can get my previously packed things and we're off to Point Pleasant.  (Tomorrow we are going to the Eagles-49ers game at the Linc.)  We arrive at about 6:30 and talk for a bit before going to eat.  Dinner was so-so, and we went to the video store to get a movie since it was still early.  As usual, there was nothing good available, so we rented  The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen , because Rachel had said she wanted to see it, and because there was nothing else.  The movie was pretty horrible.  Not much sense was made of it by me or anyone else in the room, but at least it made us tired.  Sleep.    We woke up on Sunday morning and got ready for the game.  Forecast was upper 30s, so we dressed in many layers.  It took about an hour and 15 minutes to get there, and it was early still.  We ate our sandwiches and walked around the stadium, which is really nice.  As we were walking, we noticed all the tvs had the Bengals-Rams game on, because I was the only one in the stadium wearing a Bengals coat and they knew I was cool.  Actually, the game was important to the Eagles because it represents home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.  Bengals are down 17-10.  We see bits as we walk from tv to tv.  Kitna has no time at all.  Rams drive and kick a FG, up 20-10.  More walking, Bengals get ball back and start running.  Nice drive going.  Roughing the passer on the Rams, move the ball.  Tony Stewart with a nice reception.  Ball down to the 2.  Bengals try corner route to Kelley Washington.  Intercepted in the endzone.  Old Kitna must have tied up the new Kitna in the locker room.  That pass was terrible.  Behind the receiver.  Ugh.  Rams know this is the end.  They drive right up field and score a TD.  27-10.  4th quarter, at St. Louis.  Game over.  Shit.  Kev and I grab some hot chocolate for the 4 of us and I grab 2 "hot" pretzels for me & Kim.  They were hot when I got them, but were cold by the time we got to the seats.  Pre-game lineups are pretty nice.  After every 49er's name is announced, the crowd collectively adds "sucks" to the name.  (i.e.-"at cornerback, #31, Mike Rumph"..."sucks"  "safety, #33 Tony Parish"..."sucks")  Funny.  Game starts with a deaf child singing the National Anthem(?).  Is that possible?  So that's what it seemed.  Pretty incredible.  49ers lose toss.  Eagles receive.  First play, McNabb looks down field and is picked off.  Wow, not the best way to start a game.  49ers drive, but the holder muffs the snap on a FG attempt.  Game remains 0-0.  I won't continue with the drive-by-drive coverage because it's boring.  Just know that Kevan Barlow could not be stopped and Brian Westbrook is awesome(returned a punt for a TD).  49ers scored a go-ahead TD with 1:58 remaining.  Eagles drive and Todd Pinkston makes a nice catch in the endzone.  Extra point good. 28-28.  On the kickoff, 49ers get caught at their own 10.  Eagles hold them on runs and stop clock, but with :01 left, the 49ers call timeout.  It's 4th down, and Garcia takes a knee.  End of regulation.  OT toss-49ers lose and Eagles get kickoff.  Crowd erupts.  Decent return.  First play of OT-McNabb intercepted.  A collective "Fuck" arises from our section.  Game over.  Niners kick a field goal to win 31-28 in OT.    Past is covered.  Now for the future...The 26th would be a nice night to get together.  I have to work until 5, but anytime after that would be fine.  If anyone has any fancy ideas, feel free to share, otherwise, we'll spend the night deciding where to go.  Hope to see everyone.  And in case I don't talk to you beforehand, enjoy Christmas!  I registered for my classes today.  I have class on Monday and Tuesday nights from 5:30-8.  I don't know what to do about work.  I'll be working Wed-Fri 9-5, but I would like to have off either Monday or Tuesday, and I don't want to work Sundays.  I have to figure it out so I can get 32 hours to keep benefits and stuff.

      Hello again, I'm heading home Wednesday afternoon/evening and it can't come soon enough in my opinion. Work has been going well, but I got my first bit of criticism today and of course, it has been irritating me more than it should. I was told that my patient treatments are excellent, but I need to improve my ability to manage a full case load. Never mind the fact that my supervisor has been taking all sorts of days off, and somehow, the patients all seem to get treated. Anyway, enough of that. I would really like to get together with everyone. I'll be in NJ from Wednesday until Saturday, so feel free to give me a call at home, email me, or use this truly convenient blog and let me know what works for everyone else. Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to all.

      Well, Wednesday was my last day of work for the rest of the year.  My company gives all employees the week between Xmas and New Years off, plus I had 5 vacation days that I didnt use.  So, I am on vacation starting today, Dec. 18th, and I dont go back to work until Jan. 2nd.  I am coming back to Jersey for Xmas, but I dont know how long I am staying.  The best nite for me to go out with you all would be the 26th.  But, my plans can change, depending on everyone else's availability.  Have a bloggy Xmas if I dont talk to any of you before then...

      Hello all...  Today is my last day of finals and I'm stoked.  No more waking up at the ass crack of dawn.  No more studying.  No more dumb jocks and frat boys.  A whole month of freedom.  Scratch that last one.  I'm working full time at the bank during the bank which isn't so bad because I get to make some extra cash.  Hopefully the extra cash will help me pay off my credit spending from this lovely Christmas season.  Anyways, I saw 2 of my grades for this semester and they were good, but I plan on revealing my grades to you all in one shot.  I doubt anyone would enjoy a day by day reveal of my grades.  Does anyone care about my grades anyway?  You doods better be coming home for Christmas!  We should go back to the Town Pub to get some grog and make fun of people because we really didn't do much of that last time.    Gonna go do some last minute studying.  See ya!!  P.S.-  In the little mini-mart on campus, I saw a box Big League Chew.

      Greetings and salutations.  I realize Christmas is a mere 8 days away, and still don't know if I have to work on Christmas day or not.  I guess I will be a little bummed, but I don't think it will be all that bad, as long as I'm not working all day.  I'm also still waiting for an "official" letter from  urlLink Montclair State  about my acceptance.  The semester starts in a month, so I hope to get things done asap...Yesterday at work, I had a  Clerks  moment.  Some old lady asked me where a certain candy was, and like the smart-ass I can be when it's 5 minutes before I leave, I say "probably over by the rest of the candy."  Then I left.  Oh well.  Kim and I are going to the  urlLink Eagles -49ers game on Sunday with the brother and sister-in-law.  I haven't been to a pro football game in quite some time.  I think I went with my brother a few years ago to an Eagle game, but I'm not sure.  Otherwise, it was many years ago when Boomer was on his last stint with the Bengals at the Vet.  My brother's been hooking me up with some sports festivities lately.  I like it a lot.  Maybe next I'll be able to see Monster's Inc on Ice or something.  Hooray for Mike doing a triple axle.  I have a plan for the future.  When I talked to the comm professor at Montclair, he said NJ doesn't really have a good school to pursue my doctorate in comm.  I've always wanted to go west(i.e. Arizona or even Nevada), so I may just move out there while finishing my education just to get away for a while.  I did a little research, and found that Arizona State has a vast variety of programs that suit my interests.  I intend on looking for UNLV, Nevada, and Arizona as well.  I think it will be an awesome experience, plus I won't be breathing in pollution as much as I am here.  The only thing would be that moving out there would require me to have a place to live.  Lots more research to come...  Is anyone coming back to NJ for the holidays?  Kindly share your ideas.  Sorry I don't AIM anymore.  I'm not home during the day, and usually do stuff at nite.  This blog is already staying past its welcome.  Good day!

      Hey Bri, your Christmas wish of no snow until February has been flushed down the toilet...  Once again, we are snowed in here in NJ and it is no fun.  I was supposed to get breakfast and go Christmas shopping with my mom today, but I dont think I want to drive in this weather.  Me and Brian were watching the weather channel last night and they something about the wind gusts being so high that they might actually turn your car over if you drive over bridges and all that good stuff.  So I think it would be best for me to keep my ass in the house.  Besides today is the perfect opportunity for me to get some studying done for my finals.  Then again, it would also be a good day to catch up on some sleep.  I shall contribute to the holiday spirit by posting my own Christmas wish list:  *I also want Rachel's mom to be 100% better.  It is a shame that such a sweet woman has to go through all the crap she does. *$10,000. That's all I need to pay off my car and other miscellaneous debt. *an Aston Martin Vanquish sitting next to Brian's Jeep in our imaginary driveway in our imaginary house in Arizona *Since, I intend to move where it never snows, I wish to never go anywhere snows.  **Exception, I would love to go on a cruise to Alaska. *A very large collection of my favorite sneaker - Pumas.  I already have 4 pairs.  However, I think 10 more pairs, all in various colors, should do the trick. *I also need a CD collection overhaul, but in my case I just need more different CD's. *A trip to Italy.  I'm learning to speak Italian now and I'm fascinated with the language.  I would love to mingle with the Italians and eat lots of pasta and pizza.   *Ted Alexandro and Brian Regan DVD's.  Two very funny doods.  Everyone should catch one of their shows. *A teaching job for Brian. *For all of friends and family to be happy.  That is my list.  Now get to work!!! Just kidding!

      With the holidays approaching rapidly, I figured I needed to bring some Christmas spirit to this blog.  So I'm gonna post my Christmas list.  Here's what I want for Christmas:  *Rachel's mom to be fully cured for good.  No more worries.  These are the things that would be nice as a bonus, but don't come close in comparison to priority #1:  *a Bengals playoff berth *a new Jeep sitting in my imaginary driveway in my imaginary house in Arizona *stop hearing about Paris Hilton *no more snow until maybe February *an overhaul of my music collection(I have too many cds I don't ever listen to) *to pay off my credit card(actually I'm almost there) *Alias Season 2 DVD *a winter coat *spend time with Kim, my family, and friends, and not have to worry about crap for the time that I'm with them.  So that's it.  Feel free to share your lists amigos.

      Forgive me father, for I have sinned.  It's been six days since my last blog.  So friggin' sue me.  Not too much has occurred in my life this stretch of a hiatus from the blog.  The weekend was rather uneventful because I was snowed in on Saturday.  Sunday, I was able to see Kim at least, and escape my house for a few hours.  I couldn't tell you what I did on Monday other than work since I can't remember.  Tuesday I saw Kim again and we watched the previously mentioned  Alias .  Last night I went to see the  urlLink Rangers  game with my brother.  Enter new paragraph.  Despite being a fan for my life, I had never been to the garden for a Ranger game.  Sad, I know.  Anyway, my brother, who is the best brother in the universe, got tickets from a co-worker to see them against Montreal.  My brother had to work last night, as did I.  I worked until 5, and his last report was at 6:45.  The game started at 7.  The positive was that he works in Rutherford, and I in Carlstadt.  The drive was not taxing to say the least.  He decided it would be best if we drove into the city since we were close to route 3, and we figured if we took the PATH, we'd probably get there even later.  His friend gave him a shortcut thru Hoboken to bypass the winding road leading to the tunnel, which probably knocked a good 15 minutes off our wait, but we still had to go thru the tunnel.  The tunnel was a very slow crawl.  We ended up missing the entire first period, with the Canadiens leading 1-0, but listening on the radio en route to the arena.  When we got into Manhattan, there was surprisingly a crapload of traffic and stupid people crossing on red lights, etc.  We parked not far away, and walked to the garden. (Side note:  the only Rangers jersey I have is an old one of Niklas Sundstrom.  Ironically, he's on the Canadiens now)  Upon entering, we walk towards tower "D" which is the gate listed on our tickets.  Then some guy tells us everyone has to enter thru tower "B."  Unfortunately, we circumnavigate the arena, passing long-ass lines at the snacky stands before arriving at our section, 72.  Usher guy tells us to go around to the other side to our seats, and when we do, we find people sitting in them.  We proceed back to where we first came in and ignore the usher and sit in close by but empty seats.  We sit down and Chris Simon and Darren  Langdon begin beating the bloody hell out of each other.  Nice way to start the second period.  A few minutes later, people show up who have tix for the seats we're in.  We go back to our real seats and make the people there move.  Now we're stuck in the middle of the row.  Neither of us had eaten dinner and we don't feel like going thru ten people to get to the stairs or waiting in line for food.  Chris Simon scores the tying goal in the second, and the Rangers fall apart in the third to lose 2-1.  After the game, we drive back into Weehawken and hit up Houlihan's for some post-game dinner.  Good nachos and a chicken sandwich do me well, and then it's off to pick up my car and drive home.  End night.  I really had an awesome time.  The atmosphere at the garden is filled with energy.  It gave me hope that I can get to more games from now on.  May blog this weekend.  If not, enjoy the snow on Sunday again.  Godammit!

      Finals are here and I haven't really done any studying.  Studying isn't my bag baby yeah.  Sorry. Bad Austin Powers reference.  I have a religion final on thursday, business law on friday, italian on tuesday, and accounting and calc on thursday.  The only class I am studying for is Italian.  So my week shouldn't be so stressful.  However, I had/have to wake up at 5:30 to go to class tuesday thru friday.  It's a good thing I'm not working saturday.  Maybe I can get some decent sleep then.  I still haven't done any Christmas shopping.  I only picked up 2 things so far and one of them is on backorder.  I hope it gets here before Christmas.  In other news, I am now addicted to Alias.  I never really wanted to watch the show because I didn't see what was so great about Jennifer Garner.  Ok she's pretty, I'll give her that, but she's not to die for gorgeous.  Anyway, Brian bought the first season on dvd and we can't stop watching it and now we're tuning in to watch the new episodes on sunday night.  I can't wait to see the second season and the beginning of the third season.  Damn you Brian for getting me addicted to Alias!!!

      Pizza nite!  And a blizzard ensues.  This crazy weather.  It's probably snowed about 5 or 6 inches I'll say, and it's supposed to continue through tomorrow night.  The good thing about it was that I went to work early with Kim's mom, and was able to leave early, at 3:30.  It had started to accumulate, but not as bad as if I left my normal time(5 or 5:30).  I woke up this morning at 6, because I had to go in early, and turned on the tv.  I noticed that route 3 was shut down at Passaic Avenue, just the place I had to drive to.  So I find out that someone was speeding at 3 am and hit a utility pole.  The road was closed until about 9 I think.  Traffic was diverted thru Clifton and Nutley for 6 hours.  That's a pretty poor job considering it's a major highway leading to the city.  Anyway, that's the story of the morning.    Since my next two days are shot, I'm probably gonna shovel tonite and clean my room.  I helped my dad put up Christmas lights tonight already, but it's still only 8!  Man I'm bored.  I'm chatting with Kim and Liz right now, so I'm gonna go.  Enjoy the snow.

      If you already read Kim's blog from earlier today, or if you happen to read the blog backwards, then you know I have good news.  I met with the professor from  urlLink Montclair State , and he told me he's going to have the school write me an official letter of acceptance into grad school!  Dude, I can't even tell you how happy I am after hearing that.  He was really nice and helpful.  He explained the three paths in communication I can take, and recommended the first two classes to take.  He also said that I may have a good chance of gaining a teaching assistantship since I have some teaching background, and a communication background.  I am so psyched.  So that's the good news of the day.    My appointment was at 12:30, and I was done by 1, so I decided to do some Christmas shopping since I took the day off from work.  I finished shopping for Kim, mom, dad, my brother, my uncle and his girlfriend.  All that in an hour and 15 minutes.  I got to the mall at 1:30 and left at 2:45.  I beat traffic home as well.  It was a pretty sweet few hours.  Unfortunately, it's back to work tomorrow in a blizzard, or so I hear.  I'm not ready for snow yet.  If it's going to be a big storm, then this is one of the earliest big snowfalls I can remember.  Usually they hit in Feb or March.  Anyway, that's winter for you.  I think if I feel adventurous, I may tinker with my  urlLink webpage  today.  Kim's at school, and I don't have anything else to do.

      I had an appointment today with the chair of the math department and she was very nice.  We talked about what jobs I can do with a math degree and she helped me compare the business and finance majors.  She told me that a lot of jobs dont require math majors but they love the way math nerds think.  People employ math majors for their problem solving abilities, not necesarily the degree.  As far as the incident with my advisor is concerned, she said it came to her as a shock that he would say such a thing.  She said she talked to him about it and he supposedly feels bad that he upset me.  At this point I don't really care.  If he feels bad, fine.  If he doesn't, oh well.  To me it's over and there's no reason for me to dwell on a negative comment from someone who doesn't even know me.  She actually offred to arrange for me to take the calculus readiness test which my advisor never even told me existed.  I told her I would think about it but that I was ok with taking the precalculus class anyway.  All in all, it was a good meeting.  I walked away happy and relieved.  Anyhoo, we're supposed to be getting some sort of snow storm and I'm not looking forward to it at all.  I don't mind snow when it's in small amounts and it makes everything look pretty.  But, when there's more than 3 inches of snow on the ground, I hate it!  Snow is the inconvenience of all inconveniences.    Gotta finish up some homework before heading back to class.  Peace out homeboys!  P.S.  Brian has some good news he might share with us later.

      Welcome, December.  Man am I happy this year is almost over.  Hopefully it will mean I am thisclose to beginning grad school and even closer to leaving job x.  It's Monday, and that means the late shift at my crappy job.  Gotta be there at 2:30, so I still have some time.  I haven't mentioned this on here yet, mainly because I don't know what to do about it-my sister in law's father found a job for me.  It's in a private school in Brick as a computer teacher, which will allow me to work 3-4 days a week, with the option to pay into benefits.  The job is mine if I want it, since they really need someone.  My brother and sister-in-law have made their home available to me the days I would work there, so that's great and I wouldn't have to commute over an hour every morning.  Obviously I also want to start grad school, and I don't know the final decision because I have to interview hopefully this week at the school.  Anyway, I wanted to find out the decision before making a decision about the job, because it would be difficult to do both, unless I knew my schedule for work and classes.  I mention the job yesterday to one of my family members, who later in the day tells another family member, and the latter family member decides to attack me and basically question why I would even consider the job.  That really pissed me off because it has nothing to do with this person.  It's my choice to make for something I need to do-work in my field.  I still haven't made up my mind about it and say this, but I'm still questioned because it "doesn't make sense."  I guess I know why I wonder about my confidence so much.  People shoot down my outlooks by overemphasizing the negatives and not even seeing the positives for me.  Anyway, fuck that shit.  Bengals won another awesome game yesterday, shoving it right up Pittburgh's ass.  Next week is the battle for the AFC North.  On a related note, Kim asked me if I thought the Bengals could get to the Super Bowl yesterday.  After initially smiling, I realized that lately in sports, anything is possible.  Remember the year the Pats won the SB, Rob?  Who was in the SB last year?  Oh right, they're both awful this year?  Cuse won the NCAA, the Marlins won the series, the Spurs won the NBA.  Stranger things have happened, but I'm not going to get ahead of myself.  If they made the playoffs, that would be simply amazing in itself.

      It's time once again for my random blog. I'm still in Middle of Nowhere, Georgia and it's going pretty well. I switched over to an Outpatient Clinic and so far, so good. It's interesting to see such a wide variety of patients (pretty much all ages and various conditions), but it's also been tough just coming from a setting where I would see one type of patient all the time. It may take some time for my brain to adjust. Anywho, I'm glad to hear that Brian's accident has not left any residual physical damage, although it does pain me to hear he went to a chiropractor. In other random news, I was happy to see Bill Murray take the Golden Globe and get an Oscar nomination, but Johnny Depp was nominated in the same category for Pirates of the Carribean, what the hell?! I guess Disney paid some people off.  I'm off to Florida this weekend to see dear ol' Dad. He had some surgery a couple weeks ago, but has come through like a champ. Enjoy the game on Sunday, even if CBS did ban that great anti-Bush commercial. Back into the shadows of Warm Springs I go, Matt

      I decided to play hooky.  I woke up at 7 because I was supposed to be at work for 8:30.  I looked out the window and saw that the snow wasn't what I expected.  I turned on the tele to find we've received somewhere between 7 and 10 inches of snow.  I saw school closings scroll across the screen and noted colleges were closed, as were several government buildings.  I decided that I wasn't going in.  I wasn't going to risk driving in icy conditions to a job where I make next to nothing, especially since I was just in an accident.  So my morning consisted of digging out 3 cars from mounds of snow, some soft, and some quite heavy due to the plows kicking it all up against the sides of the vehicles.  I came in and ate some  Fruity Pebbles  and watched some Sportscenter.  I decided to play with my  urlLink website , and updated my  urlLink photos  section by adding some links with the pics.  There are also some new shows listed for the NY/NJ area.  No major format changes due to the fact that I can't find the installation disk for my scanner, so it just sits there and never gets any action.    I just got my mail and received my much anticipated  urlLink No Motiv  cd.   Daylight Breaking  is a damn good cd.  It's a bit heavier than their last album, but the ep that came out a few months ago didn't let me down in terms of holding me over until this came out.  They also had a song that was featured in the X-games, which just ended, and they played out there at the games, too.  I'll probably be back outside shoveling a bit more before doing more homework today.   Class was cancelled last night, but that didn't prevent him from piling on 6 more journals to read for next tuesday.  I haven't looked at all of them, but the last one is 35 pages alone.  Bloody hell.

      First off, I want to thank Rob for calling me.  I got your message, but will try to call you tomorrow during the day when I am not half asleep and while I'm home.  Secondly, I will also try to call Den, since I owe him a call from about 2 weeks ago.  And fyi, I am doing ok in terms of recovery from the accident.  My only ailments now are going to be my funds due to having to purchase a new vehicle and increasing auto insurance.  I'm still on a 3x a week schedule at the good ol' chiropractor to heal my whiplash and soreness in my neck.  Other than that, I think everything is ok, and hopefully will stay that way...  I had my first meeting of my other class tonite.  Borrrrrrrrrrrrring.  We had a 4 minute break, but he kept us for 5 minutes after the scheduled meeting time.  He seems like a nice guy, but he lectured at us the entire night.  No interaction as far as discussions go.  There are only 5 people in the class too.  We don't meet next week because he's going to Michigan to apply for a position over there.  So I guess I won't be working with him next semester.  In other news, I'm unwillingly embracing the next storm heading our way.  The only reason being that I don't want to drive my dad's car in the snow/ice to school for one class.  It's not worth it, especially since my driving wreck a week ago...My job is fucking horrible.  My boss is annoying and the customers are obviously annoying, but the routine is unbearable.  I graduated school with a degree in communication and certification to teach grades K-8.  The only thing remotely concerned with either of those is talking at work.  I don't listen to most of my coworkers because they are ignorant(except for a few, one being Kim's mother, of course.)  What made it worse was that last Tuesday, I talked with the 7 other people in my class, and they all have at least a decent job, and it has something to do with comm.  The only thing I have applied for is a job with the nba, but I have no PR experience, so the odds of me actually being hired are slim.  I'm gonna see if my classmates can get me an in or something or give me advice.    Due to the whole accident, our vacation plans are probably nixed.  I need to buy a new vehicle, and I mean new, because I don't want a car that will simply hold me over to my next one.  I'm just going to invest in something I like and work simply to pay for it and insurance.  I'm aiming for a Jeep Wrangler, and hope to bring one home within the next two weeks.

      It's been a while since I've blogged so I figured I should check in...  Nothing new has been going on.  Classes started again :( but thats ok because I was tired of being at the bank all the time...  I bought a new car!!!  That's right folks.  I traded in my prized 98 Altima for a brand spanking new Nissan Sentra.  I test drove the SE-R which is the super sporty model but it didn't have ABS so I said "Funk Dat!  Give me ABS biznatch!"  I really didn't say that, but I got my ABS along with power locks, power windows, keyless entry, power sunroof, and killer speakers to play my music even louder that I already do.  Me so happy!!!  I also got cheaper insurance which is awesome.  I was paying 4G's a year for the other car and now I'm saving $2500 with a new company.  Can you believe that?!?  I got a brand new car and my insurance cut in half.  Although I love my new car I felt really bad about getting it since Brian got into the accident and totalled his car just 2 days before I went to the dealer.  However, I'm glad he's not driving because I get to show off my car.  Just kidding.    I am looking forward to Brian's list of exciting dates.  Especially.... you guessed it... HEY MERCEDES!!!!  Actually I'm more excited about the comedy shows.  Anyhoo, I hope everyone is doing well.  Peace out yo!!

      Just when I thought my luck was even-ing out, guess what happens?  Hey, car accident.  Car totalled.  Laceration to left knee and bruise to forehead.  Whiplash and ligament damage in neck.  Great times.  I now have no car and have missed work for two days.  Luckily, I have off from work tomorrow, and Kim can drive me to my first class at night.  This sucks.  I'm guessing I may be at fault since I was turning and the other car was going strait, but I wasn't the one going 60 down the street.  Fucking legal shit.  Wonderful timing, considering my health insurance hasn't kicked in yet, and I was in the process of shopping for auto insurance and looking for a new car down the road.  I also don't have an enormous amount of money to fund a new car and insurance increases.  In addition to this incident on Saturday, my brother and sister-in-law's kitchen nearly burned down on Friday nite, my mom slightly dislocated her shoulder, and my mom/dad's car needed a new axle on their car.  Oh yeah, and my brother was at the Eagles game last nite.  So, I infer from Meredith's journal that it was Kev's birthday, so Happy Birthday, Kev.  Sorry I missed the date...No offense to Rob, but this Super Bowl is bizarre.  Panthers/Pats?  Huh?  Well, it can't be worse than Tampa/Oakland.  Ewww.  That's all for now.  Misery for a while to come, only to increase with the stress of school and work.  Happy fucking 2004.

      Listening to my newly-received  urlLink Dandy Warhols  cd.  It's an awesome listening experience.  It blends 80s sounds(i.e. synths, drum machines) with a club groove.  I guess you have to hear it to know what I mean.  Anyway, I finally received some letters from  urlLink Montclair , although not the one I was waiting for.  I of course viewed my financial aid status and look to be receiving money as a full-time student.  I had to email them to notify them of my part-time status(6 credits).  I also had to fill out some interview online to qualify for my loans.  I'm finished, but now have to wait for my "adjusted" loan info.  Whatever.  I only know that class starts Tuesday.    I heard from one of my professors via email as well.  He told us about the class a bit and explained we wouldn't have to buy any books!  Gotta live the technology we deal with in school now.  On a related note, Kim accompanied me to the MSU bookstore to purchase the book for my other class, which ran me $45.  Not bad for textbook prices, but it wasn't very thick.  Anyhow, that's the school news for now.  More to come when I receive more info.    Other news???  Hmm, I got my cds in the mail today if you haven't taken note by my first few lines.  I only listened to Caviar before, and enjoyed it thoroughly.  It made me miss  Fig Dish  unfortunately.

      I'm bored.  Just waiting to go to my orientation at Montclair.  I've finally received some recognition of my lack of acceptance letter.  I got an email from someone who says I'll receive a letter this week.  He also acknowledged the fact that a letter was sent on Dec 17th and doesn't know why I never got it.  Anyway, I hope it doesn't drag on too long.  It's supposed to run from 1-3:30, but I think time was included to buy textbooks, which I'm not doing because I'm pretty sure everyone else will be and I don't want to wait.  Right now, the weather bug says its 7 out.  Should be a fun walk to the student center.  Anyway, I also checked my account status online, since I haven't gotten a bill yet or loan info yet, but under the list of charges it has some loans listed, so I'm hoping that's real, and my semester(and full year) is paid for!  Now, Disney World may just be possible.  Shweet...Strange dates, but is anyone gonna be home Feb 20th?  Brian Regan is appearing around here and Kim and I are probably going...

      This entry may take a long time for two reasons:  1)there's a lot of useless information & 2)I have a horrible stomach ache, which I've had pretty much all nite.  Anyway, if anyone may remember, I created a team in NFL 2004 called the NJ Vandals.  There was this whole expansion draft where I drafted crappy players, etc.  Anyway, I finally finished my season and did it in a good way.  I won the friggin' super bowl!  You probably don't care, but I have always been a fan of good video games, and this game in particular was actually enjoyable, even though I almost lost a few times.  Anyway, I'm going to give you the summary of the big game and some stats because I've always been a stat person(hey, it's one of my jobs).    Philly(13-3) vs. NJ(9-7) in the Super Bowl.  1st Quarter-I win toss and receive ball.  I get a couple of nice runs and pass plays going and dig into Philly territory.  My QB(Jeff Blake) throws an int at the 20.  Oh no!  Bad way to swing momentum.  Eagles get ball and drive right downfield, capped off by a Duce Staley 33 yd TD run(7-0 Phi).    2nd Quarter-I had gotten the ball back after the Eagles drive and began driving before the end of the 1st.  I'm running well and passing well again, and find Jake Reed for a 17 yd strike(7-7).  Eagles get ball back and go right thru my defense.  Thrash with a 4 yd rec(14-7 Phi).  I get ball back with 2:00 left.  Another good drive with variety and punch it in with a Dee Brown 8 yd run(14-14).  3rd Quarter-Eagles drive again right thru my defense, but I recovered a fumble and controlled much of the clock in the 3rd, before scoring on a Brian Westbrook 1 yd run(21-14 NJ).    4th Quarter-Unfortunately, after scoring in the 3rd, I had to kickoff.  Eagles drive thru me again and score with lots of time remaining.(roughly 3 minutes).  With the game tied, I try to be conservative at first, but suddenly could not run.  I tried to pass and they sacked me.  I go for it on 4th because they would probably score on me anyway.  Pass dropped.  Turnover.  Back to Philly.  They fumble.  I get the ball and can't move again.  Eagles get ball on downs and kneel with :02 left in regulation, tied at 21.   OT-Eagles win toss and receive.  I think it's over.  They drive as usual thru my defense and get to about my 35.  On 3rd down, they pass, but I pick it off!  Woo!  I feel the momentum and begin running them down.  I punch it in with Westbrook from the 6 and win 27-21 in OT!  Damn good game for a video game.  Blake 14-28  223 yds 1TD/1INT Dee Brown 11 rush 79 yds TD Lamont Warren 11 rush 68 yds Westbrook 7 rush 26 yds 2TD Freddie Mitchell 7 rec 114 yds Reed 3 rec 52 yds TD Pete Mitchell 3 rec 51 yds   So I had an enjoyable experience with an expansion team.  Pretty realistic because the players I got were woeful.  I traded for a QB early in the season, and created a safety because I needed someone who could tackle one on one.  I ended up winning my last 4 games to win my division, the only way I could have made the playoffs.  Despite lots of swearing and anxiety, I was glad it was challenging, and surprised I was able to find my defense in the playoffs.  Here's some of my final stats:  Blake 159-277   2,482 yds  18TD/8INT  96.9 Rating Warren 143 rush 1,014 yds  14TD Westbrook 159 rush 984 yds 13 TD Brown 47 rush 265 yds 7TD F. Mitchell 91 rec 1,430 yds 12TD Reed 33 rec 657 yds 6TD P. Mitchell 33 rec 432 yds 3 TD Houshmandzadeh 20 rec 327 yds Damon Moore 84 tckls 3 INT Lenoy Jones 42 tckls 3 sacks INT Darrien Gordon 36 tckls 3 INT  Sorry if you read this, but I forewarned you about the length and subject.  Anyway, my stomach still hurts in waves.  I'm gonna go to bed soon and hopefully feel better.  PS-Kev I tried your link and it didn't work for me.  Den I owe you a phone call.  Sorry I missed your call the other day.

      I am not making any resolutions this year, or ever again for that matter.  They are destined to fail.  I am going to make a conscious effort to get myself into better shape (eventhough round, my current condition, is a shape...).  I also want to get back to school, but I am doubting that this will happen this semester.  Oh well, enough out of me...  Bri, you can get your cd here:  urlLink http://interpunk.com/item.cfm?Item=97090&   Addendum:  Here is a link to some really good IQ tests, they are rather challenging:   urlLink http://www.highiqsociety.org/flash/nonmembers/iqtests.htm

      Hey.  Yup a new year.  Anyway, I went shopping online tonight for some cds, since I realized I'm sick of my cds that I have.  I went to amazon, buy and fye, but wasn't able to find much.  I am still unable to find  Mare Vitalis  by my boys in the Appleseed Cast, but found a few things I liked.  Here's my order:  *Jealous Sound~Kill Them With Kindness *Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros~Streetcore *Caviar *Dandy Warhols~Welcome to the Monkey House *Dane Cook DVD/CD  Explanation-Jealous sound includes the singer from Knapsack, another band who I liked but broke up.  Joe Strummer was the guy from the Clash who passed away last year.  Caviar is half of the great band Fig Dish.  Remember them, Matt?  Dane Cook is a funny guy.  That is all.  I almost got A Tribe Called Quest's Anthology, but changed my mind at the last minute to save a few bucks.  I also agree with Kim and want to start eating better again.  I was doing well, but started eating a bunch of snacky cakes and other crap the last few months.  I will eat more, but more of the real foods and less of the crap.  I also want to start working out more regularly.  Work has massively interfered with my bowflexin', and it's pissing me off because I'm not getting much exercise on a regular basis.   I registered for an orientation at Montclair next Saturday.  I still haven't received my official acceptance letter, so I have to call them again tomorrow before work to find out what the hell they're doing.    We decided(well, actually I just kind of said we're going) to go to Disney World.  Yeah it's a lot of money, but it's going to be money well spent.  I have a job and a credit card to put the hotel and car reservation on until I can pay it off.  Word.  Once again, I've been stupid in predicting sports.  I picked Denver.  What the hell was I thinking?  Denver?  Well I got the other 3 right, thanks to McNair playing for Tenn.  It was funny watching the Cowboys get dismantled as well.  Go Jake Delhomme.

      I know this is a little late, but HAPPY NEW YEAR!!  Big deal right?  Like most people, I made some new years resolutions and they are as follows:  1.  Stay away from red meat.  This doesn't mean I'm never going to eat it again, I'm just going to avoid it as best as I can.   2.  No fried foods.  I was doing pretty good with this last year so let's see if I can keep it up. 3.  When I'm mad at someone, I usually take it out on an innocent person.  For example, I'm mad at my brother (which happens often) and I take it out on Brian.  Is this fair? No, it is not.  So I hereby intend to yell at my brother more.. err.. express to people that they piss me off. 4.  Exercise more.  This is a very popular resolution that many make and, of course, break.  I hope to start running again once it gets warmer, but until then I'll do stairmaster.  However, I recognize now that I may never do either so I really won't be breaking this resolution.  5.  No more road rage.  When I drive, I have tourettes (sp?).  Therefore, I intend to avoid using my potty mouth when driving.  6.  Save more money.  This isn't a very easy thing to do, but I want to put some money away every week, even if its only $5. 7.  Continue to  not  eat after 8pm.  However, there are exceptions to the rule.  If I'm out with friends and they want to eat after the previously mentioned time, it is acceptable as long as its not an everyday thing (which it isn't). 8.  Stay away from ice cream, especially my favorite - vanilla with peanut butter syrup.  I shall limit my ice cream consumption to once a month.  No more and maybe less.  I think this is enough.  If anyone catches me breaking any of these resolutions, smack me.  Please feel free to share your resolutions on this wonderful thing we call a blogger.

      Greetings.  Today I had a great feeling of accomplishment.  Nothing major happened, but last night I made a list of a shitload of things I had to get done today, since I was home during the day before going to class at night.  I got all of them done, well, I was supposed to read 4 articles for class tonight.  That didn't exactly happen.  I skimmed 3 of them very briefly, and one was 20 pages, so I didn't have time to read it, but everything else was completed.  I started by getting the registration and license plates for my new car from the dealer.  On the way home, I registered my car at Monkey State so I can park there without paying the parking garage.  I then proceeded to deposit my two checks from work into the bank and mailed my first car payment.  When I got home, I registered for a new ez pass tag, filed my state and federal taxes, filed my renewal fafsa, and finished my paper which was due tonite.  I was satisfied.  It's been a while since I felt like I accomplished a lot.  Anyway, that feeling will subside tomorrow when I realize I have to do a 3 page paper for next Tuesday, along with 4 more readings, read a chapter for my Monday class, and begin my research project for my Monday class as well.  But I'll sleep well tonight.  My brother's birthday is next week, and as usual, I have no idea what to get him.  There's only so many times I can get him an Eagles or Sixers jersey.  I guess I can get him a Mike Cameron jersey.(that was sarcasm, since he's a Mets fan, and that's their big free-agent signing I guess).    I'm now going to rant a bit...I apologize in advance if you enjoy coffee, but it's something that bothers me to an extent...Why is it that coffee is acceptable to drink in the workplace?  In my case, it's severe, and my manager(s) are never seen without a coffee in hand.  I don't like the smell or taste of it, and I really am not a fan of folks who always smell like it, either.  In addition, I really get peeved at the people who are shocked and put me down when I say I don't like coffee.  You don't like coffee?  Oh my!  Isn't it a case of a mood-altering drug?  I know caffeine is not a controlled substance, but it is obviously addictive.  People use it as a staple in their diets in order to keep things going during the day.  I guess my gripe really lies in the reason that this drink was selected to be  the     drink that's allowable in the workplace.  I don't know, I guess one day I want to go to my awful job and see a big ass jug of Hawaiian Punch sitting in the break room with two workers eating cookies and sipping their cups of the red juice while giving a hateful glare in the direction of the lowly employee with brown teeth brewing a pot of taster's choice.

      Forgive me father for I have sinned.  It's been months since my last blog.  Haha.  I always wanted to say that!  Anyway since I last communicated with everyone, I've been to Italy for vacation over winter break, which was why I missed the Outback dinner.  Italy was great, Khristine and I went to Rome, Venice, Florence, Verona, Pisa, And the area of Tuscany.  We spent New Year's Eve in St Mark's square in Venice, which was really cool.  Food was great and so was the wine!  Anyway, so, I'm back at school.  This is basically my last semester of classes (Thank God!!).  But I have two pharmacology classes which meets every day and consume much of my time.  I did however manage to go to the Duke-UNC game which was an experience as Matt can probably attest to.  This past Valentines Day, Khris and went out to a restaurant in Raleigh, The Angus Barn which was really good.  The rest of the weekend I spent studying for my exam on Monday (the professors really like to fuck us over in terms of scheduling exams!) on the entire autonomic nervous system and every fucking drug invented to alter it.  (I just needed to vent over the last exam).  In other good news, I never thought I'd be saying, but A-Rod is a Yankee!!!  I love how all the people in Boston (aka the losers of America) are already conceding the division to the Yankees.  Can't wait till the season starts!  In other good news, I submitted my abstract to our next conference in Vancouver, and it was accepted as a talk, which is very good, but scary since I will be talking to over 500 people in the audience.  The most people I've given a talk to is around 20, but my advisor said its good for my CV, so I'll see if I can manage it  Bri-good luck with the new wheels!  I might steal your rims when I get back home, which will be on March 26-29 (I got tix for the NCAA Eastern Regionals-which is looking more and more like St Joe's instead of Duke as the #1 seed)  Anyway, I'll be more frequent in my blogs  Talk to you later

      I got a few things accomplished today.  First and most importantly, I received insurance for my automobile.  I don't want to pay for it, but I need it unfortunately, and now the car doesn't have to sit at the dealer lot while my insurance is processed!  On my way home from Randolph, I conveniently stopped at my old stomping grounds at Willy P.  I needed to pick up a copy of my immunization records because Montclair insists on sending me an abundance of emails telling me about my registration hold because of my missing measles booster shot.  Now I have the evidence and they can shove it up their ass.    This weekend was rather anti-climactic after anticipating a nice one.  On Saturday, Kim and I went to a lovely place for dinner, and upon completing the dinner, I realized something wasn't right.  I mentioned we should probably leave because I felt an uneasiness in my stomach.  As soon as we made the U-turn to come home from Pine Brook, which is up on 46 West, past Fairfield, I came to the conclusion that I might not make it home if I don't find a restroom.  So I drive rapidly towards home, only to find(as usual) much traffic by Willowbrook Mall.  I now knew I definitely wouldn't make it home.  We finally made it to a service station and I ran.  I was relieved, but at the same time knew it wasn't over.  Luckily we made it back to my house so I could at least be sick the rest of the night in comfort.  I've had a few diagnoses from different folks:  tainted food, allergic reaction, irritable bowel attack, stomach virus.  None of them sound pleasant, but I'm hoping that whatever it was, it's over now.  I didn't eat much on Sunday due to my uneasiness, but was feeling ok otherwise.  The lovely Kim made me some pasta for dinner, which was good to eat instead of soup.  Yesterday I ate safely and was ok, and today I ate breakfast so far, and think I'm ok.  Rob, I don't think we can post pictures on the blog since I don't own the site.  If I had my own website where the blog was, then it could work, otherwise it cannot...Any input on the Van Horn trade?  I was pissed.  I thought he was playing well for the Knicks.  I'm off to do homework.

      I feel empty inside with my dearth of recent blogs.  Hence I am posting.  However, It's got to be quick.  Life has been ok for me lately.  I still dislike school, like an 8 year old.  (Though I never disliked it when I was 8...)  I am going back to work after a week off from the theater.  I'm not really looking forward to it, so maybe I'll like school better, motivated by my dislike of work.  hehe.  The Pats won the Superbowl.  Sorry to all you Panthers supporters out there, since they really were a fun team on a few levels.  I hope the Pats keep a solid franchise with their new structure which I'm sure this time around will be more scrutinized and copied.  I can understand most people not being interested since they're not real flashy (even that is an overstatement).  But I find them likable and successful simultaneously.  I'm biased and I know it.  The celebratons were ok in Boston.  Good mood, more subdued since they were favorites.  few injuries, one drunk guy ran over somebody.  I went to the parade and took a few pictures.  I'll try to post one here later if someone will tell me if it's possible.  I've been reading a really great book right now as well.  It's called 'The Buying of the President 2004'.  It's a book by a guy from the  urlLink Center for Public Inegrity , one of those non-partisan, non-profit groups.  The whole idea is to give actual information about the political candidates, their careers, their backgrounds, and their financial backing as opposed to all the stuff in the media which is watered down, filtered, spun, and selectively chosen.  From my reading thus far, it's unbiased toward either party and gives good information on who has funded the parties campaigns, and the expected return for those funds in the form of legislation favors.  From what I can see, the whole system of lobbyists and contributions almost directly leads to results in legislation, like money for laws.  Anyway, it's saddening but useful to know.  So I wanted to know what to actually expect from a candidate in form of action if elected, as opposed to fancy speeches and empty promises.  The list of contributors will almost certainly tell what issues wll really be tackled if a guy is the next president.  Anyway, I think I'll have a more informed vote.  That's my 2 cents for today.  Have a good one all.

      Howdy.  It's been some time since the last blog of mine.  Unfortunately, there hasn't been much in terms of daily news.  However, I did have the luck of purchasing a new  urlLink car  on Tuesday.  I am extremely happy, as it feels good to finally have a car to call my own, and a new one at that.  It's also good because my credit was good, and now it will be even better for my future.  It's a four door with automatic transmission.  I didn't get any major options or packages besides a/c.  The only option I wanted was ABS, but it was only offered on the upper level models, so I decided it wasn't necessary for $4,000.  The car is a sand color, has a cd player(with controls for the radio right on the steering wheel!).  It is a compact car, but has lots of room in the interior and trunk.  It comes standard with front air bags, and has a feature in which the car can only be started with the key because of a chip that only reads the key's code.  The only negative, if there is one, is that I am stressing about insurance.  The dealer gave me spot insurance, which is good for 14 days.  I don't officially have insurance yet, so these quotes are important because I have to officially apply asap, since it takes 7 business days for most insurance policies to process, which would take me to exactly the Tuesday when the spot coverage expires.  If the spot coverage expires before my insurance kicks in, then I have to leave the car at the dealer until it takes effect.  That would suck.  It's not the end of the world, because it would be a couple days max, but it's something I don't want to deal with.  So that's my big story of good news.  The last month has been pretty miserable for me, so this was a nice lift.   Still struggling at school.  Excessive reading is taking its toll on me, and I haven't had much of a social life since classes began.  Work's the same story:  trite and annoying.  Routine hasn't changed, and my tiredness from reading carries over into my work, causing extreme crankiness...Valentine's Day is Saturday.  Does anyone care?  I sure don't.    In my final bit of information that you probably don't care about...I haven't been eating breakfast on a normal basis the last 2 weeks, and couldn't figure out why.  I always eat breakfast, unless of course I'm sick.  Well, I'm not sick, but I think it's because I'm not hungry in the morning.  I have class Mon and Tues nite, and eat when I get home, and work late Thurs, and eat when I get home, so I think it's because I eat right before I go to bed.  Anyway, maybe I'll start eating breakfast at night.

      As Brian and I have discussed recently, Sunday has to be the worse day of the week.  Brian says its a bad day because you know you have to go to work the next day and all you can think about is how bad work sucks.  I totally agree with him but I have another arguement as to why Sunday sucks - church.  It's all well and good that people go to church but being that I live 30 seconds away from a church I hate the traffic that is causes.  Church traffic sucks by itself but being that the Clifton Commons, Costco, Target, and Route 3 are also nearby, it makes getting out of my driveway a living hell.  I despise trying to go out on Sunday because I know it takes me 20 minutes to get out of my damn driveway.    I dragged Bri with me to see the Westfield Symphony Orchestra last nite.  My professor is the conductor of the orchestra and he requires us to go to 2 concerts and write reviews for each one.  However, this is the only actual work we have to do all semester.  That's fair, right?  Anyway, as we were going to cross the street to get to the parking lot, some guy in a Lexus truck says to the cop that's stopping traffic for us pedestrians ,"Hey!  I've got a dog that has to get to the hospital!"  The cop had this bewildered look on his face which I thought was totally priceless.  So he tells us not to cross and lets this guy with the sick dog go.  As he drove by, I saw a german shepard in the back seat wagging his tail.  Now I'm not a dog expert or anything but I think that if a dog is sick he wouldnt be wagging his tail.  I thought tail wagging was a sign of happiness.  I could be worng.  So next time I see a dog wagging his tail, I am to assume he is choking on his milkbone and should get him to a vet immediately.  Anyways, the concert was somewhat enjoyable... until we got lost.  When we were leaving the parking lot, we went the wrong way and continued to do so for about 30 minutes.  Once we finally got on the parkway, I was relieved.  However, this relief went away very quickly as we encountered many assholes who love to go 90 mph until they get right on your bumber and then pass you on the right.  If anyone has forgotten, you're supposed to pass on the left and the speed limit, contrary to popular belief, is not 90.  Actually there was some poopface in a jetta that entered onto the parkway and proceeded to cut across 3 lanes, nearly hitting some guy in a minivan which made that guy swerve into the left lane and almost hit some other guy in the the left lane.  The funny thing was the guy in the jetta didnt slow down or stay where he was.  He insisted on being where the minivan was.  Weird.  Then i got behind some drunk guy swerving all over the road and doing 35 mph. Driving in NJ is like that extreme elimination show that I love so much on Spike TV.  Yeah so thats my boring blog for today.  Hope you enjoyed!

      Ahh, glorious Tuesdays.  I get to hopefully catch up on my sleep for the week by sleeping in till about 9:30.  I then continued doing homework, which is a perpetual event for me.  It only goes on hiatus while I'm working, sleeping, and eating.  It's now just about noon, so I cannot function intellectually anymore, so this blog may be branded with dozens of swear words due to my lack of vocabulary.  Yeah, so homework is killing me.  The readings are just overwhelming, and I'm hoping it gets better very soon.  I also noticed that I can barely read the notes I took, so I have to remember how to write well enough to comprehend it at a later date.  Since I woke up and did homework all morning, I have yet to take a shower or do anything else.  Luckily, the only thing on my agenda is my night class at 5:30 tonite.  No work today, thank god.  I currently have an academic hold at Montclair due to immunizations.  Apparently, I never received a second measles vaccination, which makes no sense because William Paterson has the same requirements as Montclair, and I graduated from WP without any word of this missing vaccination.  So I have to go up to WP and get my records from the health center to see what the deal is.  The only problem is that the only time I can go is Tuesday during the day, and my mom has the car today, and last Tuesday it snowed.    I will now go into my Super Bowl retrospective...I hitched a ride with my brother's friend  Moose  to my brother's house.  We arrived at 4 and ate immediately.  We had some doritos, veggies and dip, and m&ms to start, then the good food arrived: *4 pound shrimp ring *3 pounds of fried and coconut shrimp *75 wings from hooters *100 hal-dogs *chicken fingers and jalapeno poppers *nachos *Rachel's home-made lasagna *dirt *my jello cake thing *jello football helmets  I ate one or more of everything listed, and we played catch with the famous  Illuminator  football pre-game, and at the half.  As for the game itself, well I was bored to tears for the first 35 minutes of gametime.  Finally, there was some action before the half to stir some anticipation for the second half, which was outstanding.  I have to admit, I was pulling for the Panthers, especially when they actually kept it close, but I knew they weren't going to hold the lead.  The night ended on a good note for me as I won $65 for getting the final score in a grid pool.  Only $3,435 more needed for a down payment for a car!  Hey hey!  I'm off to the showers and probably read more before class.

      I went to class last night feeling even worse than I felt last Monday, but I didn't want to miss 2 in a row.  I woke up today with my entire left side of my nose stuffed completely.  At least my throat doesn't hurt as much.  I think I actually slept pretty well, however, so that's a positive.  I've already done some homework this morning, but still have a little more to do.  I hope I can get rid of this cold or whatever soon.  I found out last night that if I choose not to enroll in classes in the fall, I have until October to start paying back my loans from this semester.  That gives me some time over the summer to save up some money hopefully.  That reminds me, good luck to  Kevin   in your MBA classes starting tonite, and good luck to  Matt  in your exit exam and finding a job!  I don't believe you're done already.  Wow.  If I feel well enough,  Kim  and I are probably gonna hang out with  urlLink Katie  and  Chris .  Then on Sunday, I have to go to my uncle's house for some reason to have pre-Easter dinner.  Easter is in 2 weeks.  This means 2 Sundays in a row are going to be wasted sitting inside at a relative's house.  This is bad for several reasons, but mainly because I have to finish my 20-page paper, and two 10-page papers before the semester ends around May 8th or something.  Sunday is one of my days I do a lot of work, but I guess not those two weeks.

      I am back in North Carolina and as scared as I am to admit it, it feels pretty good. I suppose anything would be an improvement over Warm Springs. While it was truly a great learning experience, I was definitely ready to get out of town and re-join civilization. The next (and probably biggest) roadblock is our comprehensive exit exam on Friday. Needless to say there's lots of studying to be done, but just not that much getting done. My motivation is very low. I really just want to concentrate on finding a job. On that note, I submitted my first application to a Rehab hospital in DC. I should hear from them by the first of May. We shall see. Kudos to Brian for having the foresight to pick Xavier to go this far. I would not be surprised to see them beat Duke tomorrow. My bracket turned to crap relatively quickly thanks to early exits by two of my final four teams, thanks Providence and Wisconsin! Anywho, I have to open up more books and try to convince myself I'm actually being productive in my studies.

      I'm wearing my freshly-purchased  urlLink Vernon Wells  jersey with the new Jays logo.  I know every team has black as a color, but man, it looks really good with the blue and silver logo.  It's Saturday and I am happy it's the weekend.  I'm still not feeling spectacular, but it's nice out today, so I have to get out and get some air.  I'm excited about baseball starting soon and noticed that the most expensive seats to see a Jays game is $54 in Canadian funds.  That's pretty damn good I think to sit on the field in a nice stadium.  Anyway, while Kevin may be starting a Master's program, I'm putting mine on hiatus.  By the way, Kev, best of luck.  I just wasn't into the program at all, and I don't see the point in continuing to get into further debt.  I may get back to it a few years down the road.  Who knows?  Well, I'm gonna go check my mail and watch the Mets game before hanging out with Kim.

      Long time, no blog (discounting my St. Patty's Day blessing...).  Well, I went and did it.  I joined an MBA program.  Tonite was our orientation and the first official class, Applied Communication in Organizations, starts Tuesday.  This is an accelerated program through the University of New Haven.  Each class is 3.5 hours long and meets twice a week.  Each class lasts for 5 weeks.  So, 22 months from now (Feb. 2, 2006) I will graduate (if I make it that far...) with an MBA.  They give us mid-July till the beginning of September off at least.  Woohoo (sarcastically...)!!!  On top of that, I've been house-hunting for the past month and a half; with no luck.  Connecticut is too damn expensive for a single income household, i.e. Me.  At least the areas within a normal commute to my job are too expensive, unless I want to live in the ghettos of Bridgeport or New Haven.  Which I don't.  So, I have until the end of April to find something, or I'll just rent for another year.  And on top of all of that, I've just been given double the responsibility at work.  I was pretty close to capacity before; but now I am just completely overloaded.  It's insane.  Needless to say, I hate my job even more than before.  It's got to get better, doesn't it?!?!?  Oh, and they just laid off 92 people today.  I feel fairly secure in my position.  I think I've made my self valuable enough that they can't fire me... yet...  So, I think there is a pool forming for when I am going to have a nervous breakdown...  At least the house hunting is only going to last for another month; but if I do find something, then I am going to have to deal with trying to pay for it.  And if they MBA gets to be too much, I will just drop out of the accelerated program and go into a regular part time program.  Oh well, that's it for me.  I'm gonna go back to sucking my thumb while laying in the fetal position in the corner, waiting for the next 22 months to pass...

      Hellooooo.  I spent last night not going to class.  I felt like crap.  I don't know if it's a cold or allergies, but I just felt terrible overall.  Tired especially.  I'm stuffy today and still tired, even though I slept 800 hours.  Probably going to class tonite, unless I suddenly feel worse, but hopefully that won't happen.  I got a haircut this morning, so the girl who cuts my hair and I took turns sniffling, since she is also sick.  I did some work last night for some of my papers that are due at the end of the semester, but my eyelids were too heavy to do much.  I did a little more this morning.  Don't feel like doing much, though.  I'm still feeling very blah.  I have further reason to hate Warren Sapp now.  I hope the Raiders go 0-16 this year.  Oh yeah, the Bengals still don't have a starting cornerback.  Hey Garet, how's your cover skills?  As for the NCAAs, I'm glad I didn't enter a pool, but I filled out a bracket for shits & giggles.  I usually pick a bunch of wacky teams, and Maryland has been a pick for me to go to the finals for like 6 consecutive years.  My final four is a joke, but I still have some teams alive...I had GT, Ok State, Maryland, and Xavier(sorry Matt, but I fantasized about Illinois beating Duke in my bracket...it could happen. hahahahahahahahahahaha).  Anyway, I still did well considering all the upsets that happened.  I actually picked quite a few, but it doesn't matter anyway, since I'm not in a pool.  Somehow, the Cuse is still alive, which I didn't think would happen either.    In the possible-good news front, my excellent sister in law Rachel is putting in a good word for me as a teacher in Howell.  Here's to hoping she's a good persuasionist.  There's only so much more I can take of this walgreens nonsense.  Hey Rob, we may come up to visit you in Boston for a weekend this summer, so get the pinata and clown ready for a kick-ass party.

      Happy St. Patrick's Day to one and all.  Here is an old irish blessing for you:  When we drink, we get drunk. When we get drunk, we fall asleep. When we fall asleep, we commit no sin. When we commit no sin, we go to heaven. So, let's all get drunk, and go to heaven!

      Home again from work due to illness:( So since I am doing nothing of importance,  I've decided to take a look at an old blog about new year's resolutions.  Let's see how I'm doing shall we?  1. Stay away from red meat...  Not doing too badly with this one.  I'm actually at the point where eating a burger makes me feel ill.  Is this bad? 2. No fried foods....  Doing well with this too, but when I do eat fried foods its usually in that yummy salad at bennigans or fried fish. 3. When I'm mad at someone, I usually take it out on an innocent person...  I haven't really gotten too upset with anyone yet, but I'm sure it's bound to happen. 4. Exercise more...  Yeah right.  There have been talks about running again but the stairmaster thing has yet to happen. 5. No more road rage....  I've calmed down slightly, but there are some really bad drivers out there that require me to curse at them even though they can't hear me. 6. Save more money...  I haven't been spending a lot of my money on stupid stuff, but I need new clothes for the summer for both work and casual time.  I'm pretty sure my savings will dwindle then. 7. Continue to not eat after 8pm....  This has never really been a problem for me.  I think I picked this resolution because I know it's the only one I wouldn't mess up. 8.  Stay away from ice cream...  Haven't been doing so well with this one.  It's always when we go to Friendly's.  So I hereby declare I shall  not go to Friendly's more than once a month.    So I guess I'm not doing so badly.  It's just that damn exercise thing.  Walking 10 miles around campus with a 50 pound bag has to count as exercise right?

      It's Sunday, and as usual, I already don't want Monday to come.  This week it's not as bad as usual because I know I don't have school this week.  I still have to try to do a lot of homework, however, because I will always be behind once classes resume next week.  Too much reading and writing.  Anyway, yesterday was fun.  Despite Kim still not feeling well, she was a champ, and still had the energy to hang out.  We went to Houlihan's in Weehawken, which is right along the piers.  It would have been even more beautiful if it wasn't so cold and windy outside.  We ate their dirty nachos and had a damn good meal afterwards.  We decided to catch a movie at the venerable  Allwood  theater.  It's 6 bucks to get in as opposed to 9 or 10 elsewhere.  We decided on  Hidalgo  because it was playing sooner than the Johnny Depp movie, which I didn't really want to see anyway.  So it started at 4:30 and ended just before 7.  It was a little long, but enjoyable.  It was nice not hearing a movie spattered with "fucks," "shits," and "assholes."  I don't think there were any of those;in fact, I think the only word I heard only a few times was "hell."  And there wasn't any gratuitous sex or any at all for that matter, which surprisingly was refreshing.  It was just a good ol' adventure along the lines of a hero like Indiana Jones, but with not nearly as much action sequences.  We went home afterwards to eat our dinner of hot pretzels and watched South Park and Chappelle's Show until Kim had to go home.    I got a jury summons the other day.  This is gonna be the first time I'll have to go, and I'm not real excited about it.  It's April 20th, which is a few days before my bday, and it's on my only day off(Tuesday).  I am not a fan of driving into Newark in the first place, so I hope I only have to report one day and get dismissed.  If I'm real lucky, I'll get called off the night before.  I got summoned while at WP, but I got excused because I was working to pay off my school, and had classes that conflicted.  Also, I have to renew my license before the end of April, and there's all this new crap that you need in NJ now.  I need a civil birth certificate issued by the state(not the one from the hospital), as well as two other forms of ID and proof of address.  And I'll still have to wait in line for 2 hours.  I hope these digital licenses are worth it, because no one believes my age, so there's really no way I could fake this ID.

      I finally got it...  The evil cold that has been going around has finally reached me.  Although I told the cold I didn't have time for it in my schedule, that dirty bastard insisted on making me sleepy and stuffy, as well as give me a sore throat.  I actually stayed home from work today to rest so my cold wouldn't get any worse and hopefully it helped a little.  I slept most of the day which is very shocking.  I never sleep, especially when I'm sick.  I usually stay up to watch those dirty talk shows I would never otherwise be able to see.  But I woke up today at 7, ate breakfast and didn't move from the kitchen table.  All I thought was, "ok kim.  you should go take a shower and get ready for work.  you shall be productive!"  I did not listen to myself though.  Aroung ten to eight I left a message on my bosses phone telling him I wasn't coming in.  I'm sure he was excited to know I wasn't going to be there hounding him every ten minutes for something to do.    Anyhoo, I talked to my friend Ryan from Chicago today and we talked food.  It started with me saying that I wanted egg drop soup and it continued from there.  I had mentioned something about the new Thai restaurant by Bri's house and he said we should go.  Thai is one of his favorites so he recommended some dishes to try.  Although they sounded yummy, he said thai food was on the spicy side and I'm not too much of a fan of spicy food, but I'll try it.  I'm kinda tired of eating at the same places every week (sorry Bennigans!).    Spring break is upon all at Montclair State University and of course I'll be working and probably still feeling sick.  I'm not really looking forward to it because I'm not going away to a tropical place, but not for nothing I don't really want to go at this time.  The prices are really high now because it is spring break time and you won't be able to escape the drunk morons who will probably be in the gutter, face down in their own vomit.  Not that I have anything against drinking.  I'm against the people who do it all the time and have no clue how to handle themselves.  Just say no boys and girls!  A girl in one of my classes asked if I was going away for spring break and i said, "no.  i dont do body shots."  She thought it was hilarious.  Going to stop blogging now because I probably don't make any sense.  Bye!

      Next week is spring break!  Woo!  Not real sure what that means, but no class at least.  I guess it's like a catch-up week for my work, but I just don't want to do it at all...I talked to my friend Evan, who I met while subbing in Livingston, and he just got a job in Newark.  His briefcase has his planbook, some worksheets, and a gat.  Protect ya neck.  No seriously, how he ended up there is a funny story I would have to tell you in person.  I'm addicted to Planter's Honey Roasted Peanuts right now.  I bought a can from work, and haven't been able to stop eating them all night, except while eating dinner.  Looking more and more forward to the warmer weather.  We have plans on purchasing bicycles this summer to get around as a backup to resuming our jogging schedule.  I can't wait to get back into the air.  I need to get my blood pumping and stuff.  I also really want to play some ball, but they took away my court in Nutley.  I think they're putting up a monument for Martha Stewart in its place.  Ba-zing.  No, they just tore it up for no reason.  Looks like I'll be playing in my crooked-ass yard full of tree roots...  NFL free agency is always an adventure.  You can't buy a jersey of your favorite player because more than likely, he won't be on the team for more than 3 years.  Over the past two seasons, however, I have begun to like it because the Bengals actually have a chance at signing some decent players.  This year they brought in 2 new defensive starters, as well as re-signed their awesome kicker and center.  They did decide to cut both of their starting cornerbacks from last season without signing a replacement for either yet, although they are supposed to sign either Bobby Taylor or Troy Vincent.  While I'm on the subject of sports, I am really glad the Rangers cleaned house and brought in some fresh faces.  They got rid of a lot of waste, but still have an abundance of it(Tom Poti, Darius Kasparaitis).  They got rid of the only player who represented the team for the past 15 years, which was upsetting, but his play isn't nearly as good as it once was.  They'll finally have a chance to give their younger guys(young in terms of Rangers years) more of a chance(LaCouture, Ortmeyer, Purinton, Lundmark).  They're not the best, but it's better than watching a bunch of underachieving 40-year-olds skate around aimlessly.  Hmm, what else, the NCAAs are around the corner, and my 6 year tradition of picking Maryland won't continue this year.  Actually, I think I picked Kansas last year.  Luckily I was wrong as usual.  I miss the bloggers.  Looks like I'll be doing some phone usage to get your asses back up here.  There's no humor here without you guys!

      With all this hype about the Mel Gibson film,  The Passion of The Christ  or something like that, I was thinking that the actor who plays Jesus in the movie can't really get another role.  It's like, "Hey man, I just got the part of Stiffler in American Pie 4."  "Oh yeah, well I was  Jesus ."  I mean once you're Jesus, you can't really get a bigger role, so I guess his acting days are over.  Anyway, did anyone actually see the movie?  I'm curious about it, but am afraid I may not get the full effect of it since I'm not really religious...  Today's my brother's birthday.  Happy birthday, even though I don't think you read this.  I got my first paper back from my theories class.  He gave me an A and wrote many compliments on it.  I was happy because I don't think I did A work, and even if I did, it was largely due to the fact that everyone shared their ideas with the class and was given feedback before we worked on the paper alone.  So I handed in my second paper today, and am glad I have that A, because this will surely even out the grade to a solid B.  I honestly had no idea what I was talking about, but only time will tell what el profesor feels.  I'm relieved that school is over for the week, unfortunately, I have to be at work at 8 tomorrow.  Zoinks!  I'm contemplating my future at grad school because I feel like I'm struggling with the material, and feel as if I'm not really ready to commit myself to it at this time.  I'm hoping things get a bit easier as I get further into different classes, but right now I'm completely overwhelmed and pressed because whether I go back or not, I don't want to do poorly.    As for Kim's previous post, I think it would be nice to spend a week at my brother's house alone.  We care for their fish and maintain their pool, etc, but we get to lounge around, stay away from work, hit the beach, hit the pool, and possibly have a get-together (hint).  Nothing outrageous, but a little fun nonetheless.  So I look forward to that, and the possibility of finding a teaching job.  Yes, I'm gonna try again after taking a reprieve, since I need a real job first, and then I can always go back to grad school.  It should be another interesting few months ahead.

      So Wow.. It's been about a month since my last blog and with good reason.  Nothing exciting is happening.  Just school, work, and very little down time.  The only day that I do absolutely nothing is... umm... there isn't a day!!  I guess I can't say I'm bored right?  So although Brian and I have no money to go on vacation, we're probably going down to Brian's brothers house in Point Pleasant for a week while he's in Peru.  There are some bonuses: BONUS 1- Rachel's leaving the keys to the convertible.   BONUS 2- They have a pool and a decent backyard to chill out in.  BONUS 3-  I believe they have bikes so we won't have to drive to the beach, which leads to BONUS 3-  They're only five minutes away from the beach!  I think this would be an awesome vacation.  It would be very inexpensive.  The only thing we would have to pay for is food.  Now we're just waiting to see when Kevin and Rachel book the trip.  I believe Rach said late June, early July which is prime beach season.  I'm excited but I dont wanna get too excited if something doesn't work out.  NOT A BONUS: We're still in New Jersey.  So that's about the most exciting thing that has happened in a month for me.  On the other hand, I have been getting nothing but A's in all my classes and I'm sure you're all so very proud... hehe.    Hope everyone is doing well!

      Belated Birthday wishes to Brian. In scary and disturbing news, I am done with classes and just have to present my case report to the faculty on Tuesday, with graduation to follow next Sunday. The job hunt has been going pretty well. I've been looking to head back to the DC area and have been offered one job so far, with one phone interview later today and a four interview in three day sprint coming up in mid-May. Tough decisions, but the good kind of tough decisions, as opposed to not having any job at all. This weekend (and all of next week most likely) will be a horrible sloppy mess, so Sparta, if you're interested in seeing some drunk PT students, give me a call. As a bonus we'll probably end up at Player's (also known as the worst possible club ever).  In continuing with the anti-Eli sentiment, I agree that he is a punk-ass. I hope Phillip Rivers becomes Drew Bledsoe to Eli's Ryan Leaf. One can only dream. Good luck to all in their finals weeks of classes, projects, and all that.

      Yeah, so I'm blogging again.  First I just want to say I'm sorry to anyone who has been getting email from  freeflixtix.com .  For some reason, I thought it would be beneficial to sign up and get movie tickets.  I didn't realize they would bombard my friends with emails pestering them to sign up.  So I cancelled my account today when I finally found out what the actual website was, and anyone who didn't sign up and was getting emails should stop receiving them.   urlLink Let me know  if you get any more...  I got to work at 5:30 this morning to unload our shipment, and just happened to look at the schedule for today and found that I was mysteriously scheduled to stay an hour later than normal.  Good thing I looked.  So I stayed until 2:30, came home, washed my car and cleaned the interior.  I took a shower and now I'm doing this.  I'm tired as hell, and may be falling asleep around 8 or so tonite.  I listened to the Guns N Roses Greatest Hits CD yesterday, and that was fun.  I got it for $9.99 at Best Buy on Sunday.  Good deal...You know I never thought I'd hear myself say this, but I wish the Jays had Billy Koch as their closer still.  Their bullpen has been bizarre to say the least the past 2 years.    I found out the 311 tix are gonna be $32.50 each.  That's a pretty tough pill to swallow, because "convenience" charges and taxes and such will probably bring them to $40 each.  That's an awful lot for a show, but they do put on a good show.  The Roots open, so that should be interesting.  Do I go or pass?  Too tired to do any homework tonite, but have this urge to play basketball strangely enough, even though I can barely keep my eyes open.  Suffice it to say I will not be basketball jones tonite, rather, I'll be lazy jones.  That's all for now.  Peace out.

      Holy crap I'm old!  Thanks for the wishes kids.  gracias.  I had my Tuesday class from 4-5:30 tonite.  He had some banquet to attend tonite, so we got to leave early, and the classtime was cut in half to boot!  Unfortunately I have to wake up at 4 to work tomorrow.  Ugh.  2 more weeks of school, and 2 more weeks to finish up my 3 papers.  Can't wait.  I cut my lip today, I guess while shaving, and it didn't stop bleeding until about 3:50, when I was walking to class...Yes, Eli Manning will get his ass kicked every game next year because the Giants have no line.  Rock!  My birthday details...hmmm.  Dinner was good I guess-Ribeye with sweet potato was tasty. I got some nice gifts-2 shirts, a new basketball, MLB 2005 for PS2, Trivial Pursuit Pop Culture game with dvd, some money.  All stuff I needed or will definitely use.    We're going to see Braid on June 7th, and 311 tix go on sale Saturday for a show July 24 at the PNC center.  Nice!

      Happy B-day Brian!!  I'm finally done with classes as of today!!  Only 2 more classes to take for the rest of my life next semester and I'm finally free.  This semester has benn totally hellish in terms of classes and work, so I'm so happy it is finally over.  In June, I get my master's degree, which signifies the halfway point of graduate school.  This past week was pretty enjoyable, I saw Death Cab for Cutie and Stereolab at The Cat's Cradle in Carrboro.  Both were pretty good shows.  Next month, I get to go to Vancouver for a conference.  hopefully Todd Bertuzzi won't be there to beat me up.  Anyway, the blogs should be more frequent now that I have some spare time. Hope everyone is doing well.  Talk to you later!   BTW, Eli Manning is punk and I hope he gets his ass kicked every game next year.

      Nilidigiphaguf Day goes back to a country in Africa once known as Botswanaland, but has since been renamed Mozambique.  On April 13 it was said that the indigenous people of the country set fire to their weapons in hopes of releasing the evil blood that may be left on them [the wooden handles are turned to ashes, which are then sprinkled on the first born child to protect him/her from evil spirits.  The metal is melted down and reformed into statues of their "good" gods.  So that's the tale of Nilidigiphaguf Day.  Hey Rob, I just read that the Pats acquired Corey Dillon for a second rounder.  I'm happy for you, but scared at the same time, because as much as I hate the guy, he's a damn good runner.  Pats repeat!?    I am glad Kim got the classes she wanted because I feel awful about something that happened in her current music class.  We were supposed to attend a classical concert on Saturday[long story] but ended up not attending for various reasons when we arrived.  She was obviously upset because the show was in Rahway, and she drove all the way down there and couldn't go.  Anyway, since I'm such an honest person, I tell her to email her professor and tell him exactly what happened and that you made the effort to go, but circumstances prevented you from going.  Anyway, he emailed her back and told her she has to attend another concert instead and report on it.  If she hadn't emailed her professor, she probably could have copied someone's program and b.s'd the report.  Sorry.  Oh, that Nilidigiphaguf story was made up.  Rob made up the word when we were playing Scrabble a long time ago on April 13th.

      Just finished registering for the summer and fall at MSU.  I'm pretty happy about my fall schedule even though some of the classes are crappy.  The summer is a different story.  I'll be taking 2 classes (yuck!) but I'll be finished with both by July 8.  So if anyone cares here are my classes:  Summer Classes: -  Intro to Jazz.. the Intro to Music class I'm taking now does not satisfy the fine and performing arts class for me.  I sure am glad someone told me this before the deadline to withdraw expired. -  Earth & the Environment...  Isn't it exciting that I get to look at rocks 4 days a week for 4 weeks at 4 hours at a time.. lots of 4's there.  Fall Schedule: -  Intro to Chinese Civilization.. ok, so it may not be interesting but maybe the professor will bring in some good food for us. -  Contemporary Issues: National Issues...  stupid requirement. just in time for elections -  Intro to Marketing.. Probably not that interesting but I heard the professor is easy though. -  Statistics for Business..  Whenever I can take a math class, I'm happy.  Plus, I heard this professor is easy too. -  Intro to International Business..  Another requirement but this time it's a general requirement for business majors.  I don't particularly care for this topic but I gotta take it.  So that's that.  I actually got my classes at the time I wanted so that was a plus.  I guess it pays to be an upperclassman.  WooHoo!  Finally a junior!  That means only 2 years to go.. It seems so close yet so far.  Am I the only one who has no clue what Nilidigiphaguf Day is?

      The NFL schedules came out the other day, and I'm going to list the  urlLink Bengals  schedule, not because anyone wants to see it, but more for my own reference so I can look back and see who they play...  09.12  @ Jets 09.19  MIAMI [Sunday nite-ESPN] 09.26  BALT 10.03  @ Pitt 10.10  BYE WEEK 10.17  @ Cle 10.25  DENVER [Monday nite!-ABC] 10.31  @ Tenn 11.07  DALL 11.14  @ Wash 11.21  PITT 11.28  CLE 12.05  @ Bal 12.12  @ New Eng 12.19  BUFF 12.26  GIANTS 01.02  @ Phi  First of all, holy crap, they're on national tv 2 times, and they haven't been on Monday nite in like 15 years.  Secondly, holy crap, that schedule is no fun.  They play the Jets and Giants, so I get to see them 2 more times, and they end against the Eagles-brotherly rivalry.  Anyway, I was excited to see Monday nite, but wish it was a game they could win.

      Tax Day for about another hour.  Hope all you procrastinators got that shizzy out in time...I got home from work tonight and saw a duck in my neighbor's driveway.  Normally I would say "Hey duck" and continue walking to my door, but something didn't seem right.  He was wobbling quite a bit and when I stopped walking to watch him, I noticed he was trying to quack but no sound was coming out.  I felt so bad, so I went inside and told my dad and mom.  They came out to have a looksy and said to try and call the animal shelter.  No one answered but a robot voice.  So I called the police non-emergency line and the guy said that animal control isn't there after 5(it was 7:30 or so), but he said he'd try to call some wildlife guy.  A few minutes pass and the animal control officer called me.  He asked me some questions and told me to see if the duck moved when I chased him.  He moved...from my neigbor's driveway to my front lawn.  If you don't know my front lawn, then I'll tell you it's all on a hill.  The duck struggled to get up the hill on a gimpy leg, but somehow did it.  He nested there for a while, and then suddenly fell down the hill and onto his back.  He took a while to turn right side up, but finally did, and chilled on my sidewalk.  I felt bad for him.  Finally the animal control officer called me back and asked me some more questions before I said to come get him because he was obviously injured and would have been eaten by a cat or something if left alone.  The guy was there in about 10 minutes and took the duck with him.  I don't know the duck's fate, but at least I felt good getting him some help to maybe fix his injured leg.  I worked at 5:30 yesterday morning, and it was frankly a little creepy driving to work at that time.  No one was on the road really and it was dark, yet someone still managed to almost hit me in Wallington-the town with the worst drivers in America-on my way to work.  It went pretty quickly as I left at 1:30.  I couldn't really sleep when I got home, so I ate lunch and showered.  I fell asleep for about an hour before dinner, and went to bed after watching another pretty funny  South Park .  Today I went in at 10, and my mind was all flustered.  I felt like I should have been going home at like 4, even though I had to stay until 7.  Anyway, back to normal 8-5 tomorrow before the weekend starts.  Warmer weather in the outlook before  jury duty  on Tuesday.  I got some good directions and advice, so hopefully my nervousness won't be at its height on Tuesday morning.  Gotta go to bed soon.  Enjoy the weekend!

      I'm going to sound mushy for the first part of this blog, so don't read it if you don't want to...I felt extremely lucky today.  After all the times that I complain on this blog about how much shit luck I have and how much I hate my job and school, and how broke I am, I was thinking how lucky I am to have such a tremendous girlfriend.  I guess maybe I'm getting over the fact that lots of people have things much worse than I do, but I believe it's just another sign of reasons why I want to spend my life with her.  When muddling thru a crappy Monday at only 10:30 in the morning on a day that consists of working to 3, going directly to the doctor, home to change and up to class, I found myself smiling after thinking about her.  And the sign of how true that one moment was this morning, she ended up calling me at work no less than an hour after that smile came across my face.  I'm lucky to have such a wonderful partner.  I hope me saying this doesn't come off as bragging or I hope it doesn't make anyone feel bad, but it's actually just me hoping that my awesome friends have found or will find someone that will make them feel as lucky as I do.   If you are still reading, I'll breakdown my weekend.  Friday I worked, went to the doctor, and went to China Garden for dinner with Kim.  Good food and ate some good pistachio ice cream for dessert.  Saturday we grabbed lunch, bought some cds and the Weezer dvd, and dyed some eggs for Easter.  As Kim mentioned, we made an appearance at our friend Brandon's house, where we also chatted with John and Kate.  It was nice to see old friends doing well.  On Sunday, I ate Easter dinner with my family and picked up Kim afterwards to come back to my grandmother's house where we watched the Mets game and Arena football.  Watched Alias at night and did my homework after.  Thus ended the weekend.    Did anyone see South Park last week?  I missed it, but heard it was humorous.  So, I heard you got served.  Looking forward to seeing where the Sixers trade Iverson.  Actually, as much as I'm sure most people hate him, I still like him.  They've got some good players on the team, but they just need a few more pieces.  Willie Green, Korver, and Salmons are solid to decent fill-ins, with Green having talent to be a starter.  Dalembert is a monster in the making, and Kenny Thomas and Snow are still real good players.  Big Dog was a big waste, and DC's career is over, but if Marc Jackson recovers from his injury for next year, he will play as well as he did before the injury.  Anyone got Atari?  I've got an itch to play some Dig Dug.

      Today is Easter and I've noticed it is probably the worse holiday of the year.  No one even knows what we're celebrating, including me.  The upside is eating good food and the downside is sitting around the house with relatives you really don't want to see for the most part.  I've also noticed the next big holiday is Thanksgiving.  Now you might be saying, "But Kim, what about Memorial Day and Labor Day?"  Those holidays are kinda cool because it's all about bbq-ing and warm weather, but these typically aren't family holidays, which I think are desperately needed by those like me who despise sitting with relatives talking about the same stuff you talked about the last time you saw each other...  I guess you can say I'm not a big family get-together person.  I don't think I'll mind it as much once I get my own place and start my own holiday traditions.    Anyhoo, I would talk about how interesting my life is but it really isn't.  Just work and school.  Nothing new.  Oh, but there was some fun last nite.  Me and Brian went by Brandon's house.  It was a spur of the moment thing and I was glad I went.  It was nice to see Brandon as well as Katie and John.  Itwas also cool to meet some new people.  I think there were about 10 people there at one time and 5 of us are/were Sam Goody employees.  Crazy.  We talked about all the silly stuff we did.  Good time had by all.  Hope to see them all again soon.  Time to eat the traditonal ham and kielbasa.  Later.

      Hello blog.  I will apologize for being out of contact once again for a while.  I've been fairly busy with random things, but that is no excuse damnit!  Anyhow.  I've been working at the theater a decent amount still.  A couple weekends ago, I went to Atlantic City for a bachelor party of my college roommate.  That town is rotting, but there are casinos.  Anyway, his wedding is April 17th, so I'm going to that event as well.  I think he's getting married in Florham Park.  My mother is convinced it is in a castle for some reason.  I think not.  I've been spending most of my free time hanging around with a variety of people with whom I work.  I've been doing this for a long time, but it seems this past week has been especially so.  Some people major in all sorts of things, like dancing and choreography, for example.  Other choices include radio broadcasting, saxophone, marine biology, french literature, but mostly psychology and creative writing.  I don't really understand some of them, but it seems nobody understands what I studied.  Anyhow, I feel pretty confident in figuring out whatever I need to, whereas I think none will ever figure out physics.  Speaking of physics, I'm really horrible at pool.  I have always been so, but I guess I forgot.  Also speaking of physics, I went to a foot doctor and got orthotics since he told me my 'bio-mechanics' of walking were harmful.  Anyhow, I've had these things 2 days and today when I woke up my big toe on my left foot is in excrutiating pain, which is odd since my feet felt fine when I was actually wearing the orthotics.  I think they shall be adjusted.    I think I don't have any more 'speaking of physics's'.  I hope everything is well with all of you.  I will post again soon.  -R

      The fun at my uncle's house this past Sunday was beyond words, but I cannot post pictures on this site, so you cannot see what a shit time I had.  Needless to say, I'm just as excited about the most boring holiday coming up this Sunday.  I finished my homework for tonite's class and I'm waiting for Kim to get home from seeing her advisor before we grab a bite and head back up to school.  The game last night was pretty ugly, and it only finished as close as it did because UConn slowed down their pace and lost their momentum for the last 10 minutes of game time.  The final four games made up for the lackluster final anyhow.  Good start for the Jays, but I can't say I wasn't expecting the opening day loss.  They didn't start well last season either, and Halladay started 0-5 or something.  Besides, everyone kept saying how Halladay is dominant when facing Detroit.  Jinx.  Also, Lawrence Rocca, baseball columnist for the Star Ledger picked Toronto to win the World Series.  I can't say I wasn't slightly excited by this, but is he serious.  Their GM doesn't even think they'll be in the playoffs until next season.    I'm going to renew my license this Thursday, so we'll see what all the fuss is about for these new digital licenses.  I'm gonna go twiddle my thumbs now.

      As Brian said, this weekend was great but today just sucks.  It's raining right now and I'm stuck home writing a paper for my Intro to Jazz class.  I should have done it a few days ago but who does what they should?  The paper will give me something to do besides sit here and play free cell or lemonade game urlLink  .  Maybe after the paper, I'll read a book or something else nerdy.

      Hope everyone had an enjoyable weekend.  Unfortunately, it's gloomy today.  I had a pretty nice weekend up until today, when I have to work 3-11.  Saturday,  Kim  & I went to  urlLink my brother  & sister-in-law's house down the shore.  We helped them finish putting rocks down in their yard and then had a big bbq to reward ourselves.  Had a burger, 2 dogs, beans, corn, fritos with hummus, tostitos, pickles, tomato & fresh mozzarella, malibu & pineapple juice, fruit salad, some cake, and I think that's it.  Pretty good variety of foods.  We watched some  Chappelle's Show  and then  Dane Cook 's comedy special before turning in for the night.    Woke up Sunday with a very tight back and quite tired.   Rachel  made us all some good waffles with some fruit salad and sausage for breakfast.  We then helped to clean off their pool cover and put up a gazebo in their yard.  Their yard looks amazing with the rocks and the pool opened.  There's still a lot of room to play with a tiki bar or  urlLink wiffle ball  field.  After showering, my bro & I played a good game of wiffle ball homerun derby for old time's sake.  He won in 10 innings 6-5.  Obviously we felt the rust since we hadn't played in some time, plus our swings hurt our backs more than the shoveling from Saturday.  When we returned to the house, we were hungry, and decided to get lunch from a friendly place known as  urlLink Surf Taco .  Mmm, that was good, but left us all feeling like blimps.  So we went to sit our lazy asses in the sun by the pool for a bit and just talked and listened to some tunes.  After a game of HORSE with my brother, we got some ice cream and felt fat again.  We proceeded to chill and then it suddenly became cold and cloudy.  We stayed out for a bit, but started cleaning up and went inside.  We watched the dvd  Evolution , which I think did poorly in theaters, but was supposed to do well.  Anyway, we all enjoyed it, and I thought it was better than the first two times I saw it.  After dinner, we ate some dirty shrimp and waited for our filet minons to grill.  Good dinner.  After cleaning up, Kim & I had to drive home.  Overall, a relaxing weekend with lots of good food.    The ride home was somewhat crappy due to a huge backup at the Driscoll Bridge (somewhere around exit 129).  Mostly before and after that, we were at least driving at a tolerable pace.  Now it's time to mope until 2:30 when I leave for work.  Can't wait until our week in July.  Oh crap, it's not even June yet.

      Jogging was fun today.  It's been a while.  It felt good, but at the same time, my legs burned.  Also, at the end, my stomach decided to convulse and finally digest my food from yesterday, causing me some discomfort(i.e. a stomach ache).  I'll probably be really tired at work, especially since I have to be there until 11.  Yikes!    The jazz place was pretty cool.  It was something different that's for sure.  I definitely would have enjoyed it more if I had not had to wake up at 4:30 in the morning for work.  I don't know what I'm going to do today before work.  I'll probably clean my room or something.  I'd clean my car, but it looks like rain again.  I'm sure I'll end up blogging again later.

      Last nite Brian and I went to  urlLink  Trumpets in Montclair.  I had to go see a live jazz performance for my jazz class and instead of going to a smokey nite club in NYC (which I would like to do someday) we went there and it was a cool experience.  There were only 10 people in the place: 2 performers, 4 employees, and 4 peeps in the audience.  The 2 guys were really good. The bass player was extremely good and totally into it.  I was shocked to hear Bri say that he would go back to Trumpets.  I know I would.  The only down side was the high prices for food and drink.  Last nite left me with $3 in my wallet.  Oh well...  Me and Brian are running together tomorrow morning for old time's sake.  Hopefully, I won't pass out after the first block.  Continuing with the exercise theme, I am planning on joining a gym soon.  I don't necessarily need to lose weight but if I happen to shed some pounds I wouldn't complain.  My main goal is to tone up a bit. Hopefully my laziness will not prevent me from reaching my goal.  Time to iron clothes for tomorrow.. Later.

      It was warehouse day at work, which meant getting up at 4:30.  The day began on a great note, because at 6 am, a new assistant manager was scheduled(started last week), and me & one of the other assistants were working on unloading the truck and wondered where the other guy was.  So the one assistant paged the office to ask where he was.  About 5 minutes later, the new assistant comes thru the back door with this attitude about how he didn't like the way the other assistant paged him.  The quarrel turned to much louder voices and some other non-relevant personal info was thrown into the assistant's face.  The new guy had no right to do this because it's personal business, and he's new, so he doesn't know crap about anyone yet.  Anyway, the argument died when the assistant apologized(which he shouldn't have) and said he's sorry the new guy took it the wrong way.  About 10 minutes later the new guy starts again by saying how he interpreted the page.  I just said it's too early in the morning for this nonsense.  After the truck was unloaded, the two assistants talked in the office and settled the matter I guess, but throughout the rest of the day, I could still tell the new guy had a chip on his shoulder.  Unbelievable.  I wish people would act their age sometimes.  Memorial Day weekend is coming up, and I for one am going to Wildwood with Klein to drink skunky Molson Ice and smoke weed with a girl who's allergic to smoke.  (This is a reference that only Dennis would understand, sorry!)  Seriously, I think we're heading to my brother's on Saturday to help him finish laying out rocks in his yard and opening his pool.  We'll stay over and go in the pool Sunday, unless the predictions are right, and it's only 70.  Gotta work on Monday, though, but not sure what time yet.  Anybody doing anything special?

      I got home from work at about 11:45, so I'm not really tired yet.  Plus, I had to get the garbage ready to take out for tomorrow.  I have to be at work for 9 in the morning, which isn't horrible, but still not the greatest.  Can you tell I've got nothing better to do with my time than blog since I've had about 6 posts in 2 days?  Some lady today spent over $300 on band-aids and water.  I couldn't quite make out the connection between the two however.  Good night.

      Ooooooo!  I like the new blog.  The green is a nice change from the blue.  I also like the profile thingy.  I made one for myself and found that the music section is almost an exact replica of Brian's.    Anyhoo, I am half way through with my intro to jazz class.  The class is surprisingly fun and I like a lot of the music the professor is presenting to us.  The only thing that sucks is that I have to go to a live jazz performance.  Normally, this wouldn't be a bad thing but the class is only 3 weeks long so the pressure is on!  I'm sure it will be a good time.  I got a free ticket to Comic Strip Live in NYC, which kicks ass because it gets 2 people in.  The only thing I have to pay for is the two drink minimum.  Hopefully, I'll get to someone good like Dane Cook, Brian Regan, or Ted Alexandro. I heard someone got to see Dave Chapell there.  That would kick ass.    I'm Rick James bitch!

      I just checked, and it's not *'d out...yet.  Also, I changed something from their template.  Where I have links, they originally had "previous posts" which gave the first sentence from the last 7 days worth of blogs so you can click on it and go directly to it.  I thought this was sort of dumb since you can simply scroll down and view the last 7 days worth of blogs.  Maybe I'm not seeing the big picture.

      I was getting tired of the blue.  Sorry.  I lost all my links when I changed the template, so if there's some links you want me to put up, just let me know, because I don't remember all of them.  Anyway, gotta be at work at 3, and I'm going to see my grandmother beforehand.  I hope it's not 100 in her house.  I noticed while scrolling thru some of the archives that many bad words were *'d out, so I'm going to test it.  Fuck!  If it's bleeped out, then I'm gonna be pretty pissed.     Alias  last night was pretty good.  Hope it comes back next season and they don't replace it with that dreadful Nick & Jessica variety hour of crap.

      I just talked to Rob!  I'm glad he seems to be doing well.  He has been missed on our blog here, just as everyone else has.  It's very warm out today, but I am actually enjoying the warmth thus far.  It feels nice hitting my skin after that god-awful winter.  I still don't like sweating, but maybe I'll start taking ice baths to cool myself down before going out.  My mom's listening to the radio in the background, and that horrendous song by the fine young cannibals is playing-you know the one where the guy sounds like he's mumbling in a high pitched voice...she drives me crazy.  uh uh.  Dammit!  How come there's never a baseball game on when I'm waiting for Kim to get home from work on Saturday?  Shouldn't they be outside in the sun scratching their nuts and chewing Big League Chew on this fine day?  No Mets, not even the Yankees, who I would allow myself to watch just to pass time, and not even rugby or something wacky.  Just infomercials, crappy vh1 programming, or terrible cartoons.  Ah well.  Adios amigos.

      I knew the Blue Jays were on ESPN's daygame again today, and since I'd be getting home around 3, I figured I'd be able to catch a bit of the end of the game.  When I left work, at about 2:40, I turned on the sports scoreboard on the radio, and it was the 7th inning, and the Jays had just taken a 5-2 lead.  I got home about 20 minutes later, and the score on the tv screen reads 6-5 Twins, and then I hear something about grand slam and Matt LeCroy.  I come to find out that Terry Adams, who blew the game last Weds for the birds gave up a grand slam in the top of the 9th inning, and the Jays were then trailing 6-5.  Needless to say, they didn't come back and win in the bottom of the 9th.  Again I witness(sort of) the bullpen collapse.  I found out my grades last night and did ok.  I got a B and an A-  It's funny because I thought my grades would be switched, or at least thought I would have done worse in the other class, but I'll take it, especially since I'm probably not going back anytime soon.  I'm really tired, so I'm gonna go lie down.

      I'm supposed to be at work in about 45 minutes, yet I really don't feel like moving.  I'm not even ready yet, either.  It's gloomy out, so I guess I'm just in one of those moods where I don't feel like doing a damn thing.  Well, I guess I shall be getting ready now.  Time for work routine: drive the same way to work, park in the same choice of 3 spots, get my water and walk to the door.  Walk in and say hi to the cashier, although I can give a rat's ass how her weekend was, walk to photo and say hi to the photo guy.  Punch in the combo to the back area.  Glance at the time clock.  Notice I'm early as usual.  Stare aimlessly at the 2-year-old notices on the bulletin board, and wait until 3 minutes before my shift begins to punch in.  As I walk out the door, the manager will call my name, even though he knows I was out there for 10 minutes already and could have talked to me then instead of waiting until my right leg is on the sales floor.  Asshole.  Let the day begin...

      I enjoyed this weekend a lot.  I spent most of the time with  Kim , and relaxed as well.  Today, we had to bring her brother to his home in Sparta, no not that Sparta.  We ended up staying there for a while chatting and then we ended up getting free burgers and snacks for dinner which was a bonus.  Nice house, nice day, free grub!    Upon our arrival home, I was able to use Kim's laptop to burn a mix cd for my car.  I tried going with a summery/upbeat mix.  Most of the stuff is pretty uninteresting to most folks, but here's how my setlist goes:  01. Feeling This: Blink 182 02. Into the Darkness: No Motiv 03. Sunny Side of the Street: Face to Face 04. Amber: 311 05. Guerilla Radio: Rage Against The Machine 06. It's Been A Blast: Hey Mercedes 07. Cool For One Night: Hot Rod Circuit 08. Blue Groove: Kid With Man Head 09. Does That Make Sense?: The Jealous Sound 10. You've Got So Far To Go: Alkaline Trio 11. A Praise Chorus: Jimmy Eat World 12. Fat Lip: Sum 41 13. Photograph: Weezer 14. Big Brat: Phantom Planet 15. Warning: Incubus 16. Sell My Old Clothes, I'm Off To Heaven: Saves The Day 17. Blue Sky: Dynamite Hack 18. Who's Gonna Save Us?: The Living End 19. J.A.R.: Green Day 20. The Page: Appleseed Cast 21. PS We'll Call You When We Get There: The Juliana Theory 22. Break It Off: Koufax 23. Intergalactic: Beastie Boys  Much of the stuff is old or whatever, but I don't care because no matter how many new cds I buy, I still get sick of all my cds.  I don't know what to do with myself since I don't have to work until 3 tomorrow.  I think I'll try to finish reading  The Corrections  finally!

      I'm home and not tired enough to go to bed or in the mood to play MLB 2005 or watch a dvd, so I'm blogging again.  Went to lunch at Houlihan's and ate almost an entire plate of chicken nachos by myself before surrendering to my dinner salad.  A salad!  I was defeated by a salad.  It was good, but I couldn't eat anymore.  It consisted of garden greens, grilled chicken, tortilla strips, cherry tomatoes, shredded jack cheese, toasted pecans, and ranch dressing.  Unfortunately, I wouldn't be able to salvage it after having it wrapped up since we were going out.  Not about to leave it in my car, so I left it on the streets of Weehawken for a bum to eat at a later time.  Purchased new sneakers, undershirts, and 2 shirts.  Nothing major, but stuff that was needed to some extent.  Just enjoyed the day with Kim and not worrying about work or school.  Tomorrow I may wash my car, bowflex, and make a mix cd with the help of Kim's laptop.  Time for my crest whitestrips.

      It's currently 86 outside and it's still sunny!  On a Saturday!  Welcome weekend...My weekends feel more complete now that school is over and I'm not writing papers.  In addition, my work schedule has changed for the better (slightly).    Monday: 3-11 pm Tuesday: 9am-5pm Weds: 530am-230pm Thur: 9am-5pm Fri: 8am-5pm  So I got more hours, meaning a bit more money, although not at the rate I'm getting paid.  But going in late on Monday is spectacular since I don't have to deal with the photolab on Monday morning from all the weekend photographers, and I get to extend my weekend by a bit.    Hope to do some shopping today since I struck out last night and came home with a belt of all things.  Need basics and new sneaks.  How about Orlando Hudson?  Man thank god for him because he's carried the team for the past 2 series.  Well, I'll finish getting ready to go out.  Enjoy the weekend.  P.S.-Congrats to Den's sister on graduating college!

      Howdy all!!  I am being a very bad employee and blogging at work.  I have nothing else to do so I might as well take advantage of the cable connection I have here as opposed to my crappy dial up at home.  So I'm thinking I may want to start looking for a new job.  I may be going back to work full time sometime soon and, unfortunately, I have not learned anything new in the mortgage department since I started back in august.  I like working here, but it is very frustrating because everyone but me is busy and I cannot stand sitting here and waiting for someone to come to me and say, "Hey, can you copy this for me?"  Plus, everyone is so busy and they wish they had more help, so why not just teach me how to do it?  Oh well.  Those are the breaks, right?  Hope everyone is doing ok.  Where the hell are you guys??

      I have a few things to look forward to this summer, now that school is over.  Besides our "vacation" to my brother's house, I have the honor of attending the Face To Face farewell concert in Irving Plaza.  It's Sunday, August 22nd, and I am psyched because I never got the chance to see them live, and was really bummed when they called it quits last year, but they're getting together to do a final run.  Should be sweet.  Don't know who they're playing with, but I don't care.    After getting home from work today, I watched the Blue Jays game on ESPN...unfortunately.  They were down 1-0 in the 3rd when I got home, and proceeded to tie the game and take the lead 2-1 in the 5th I think.  The Royals tied it at 2, but the Jays took the lead back in the 7th.  Kerry Ligtenberg came in for the 8th and left with 2 outs and runners on the corners.  Terry Adams, their supposed closer of the moment, came in to get the 3rd out in the 8th.  The Jays couldn't do anything in the 8th as Delgado struck out with bases loaded, and then faltered in the 9th again.  Adams came back in to close out the game, but didn't have good control.  He fell behind 3-1 to Desi Relaford, who's batting .210 this year, and then surrendered a single to him.  Aaron Guiel grounded to first, and Relaford moved to 2nd.  Angel Berroa grounded to second and Relaford moved to 3rd with 2 outs.  Adams then walked Beltran to put runners on the corners and Mike Sweeney lined a ball past Eric Hinske to score both runs and win the game.  I watched the game for 3 hours and they lost like that!  It sucked.  The game must have been 4 hours long because first pitch was 2 pm.  Anyway, I was pissed and threw my name tag from work across the room, but soon got over it since I had a feeling Adams didn't have closer stuff...

      Our blog had plastic surgery over the weekend apparently, at least the sign-in page.  It looks streamlined...So class 1 of 2 is over.  Presented my proposal/paper in class and the professor was very nice in not tearing it apart.  He's a good teacher, but I still don't think I'll be continuing in the program come September.  Now I've got to do a final re-read of my paper for tomorrow's class, read an article, and set up an outline for my presentation of that paper for a 5 minute summary of my stuff.  At 8 PM tomorrow I'll be ready to drink my face off; however, I have to wake up at 4:30 for work on Wednesday morning.  Blast!  I'm now going to complain about work, since it pisses me off more and more every Monday.  We just got a new photo lab in the store, and I'm not trained on the new machines.  Somehow, I got stuck in the photo lab today for my last hour when I had lots of other work that I was supposed to do as part of my job position.  Also, last week, my manager tells me I won't be in the lab anymore because my job was to focus on inventory and orders.  So starting next week, I'll be working Monday nights, when there is someone else working to handle the photo lab.  I had this vision at work today telling me to leave my job and work down the shore this summer, while taking surfing lessons.  Probably won't happen, but very tempting.

      So today was mother's day and I was supposed to spend some quality time with my mom but she was sleeping (she works the nite shift from 10-7) and I've been studying accounting for about 5 hours.  Well we did get to eat lunch together... Anyway, I wouldn't have to study so much if I didn't miss 2 classes due to illness.  I'm very sleepy right now and its not just from the studying.  My rude ass neighbors were fighting at 4am.  I don't really know what happened but from what I heard some kid was arguing with some other dude about his ex girlfriend in the other neighbors driveway.  So the other guy came out with his german shepard and basically told him to shut the f**k up and that the cops were coming.  I didn't hear much else but the dog barking until 4:45.  That's right.. I listened to a dog bark for 45 minutes in the middle of what was a great slumber until then.  Oh and by the way, I think the neighbors were fighting in my driveway which doesn't make sense since the guy was pissed the other neighbor was in his driveway.  Maybe he wanted to have the whole neighborhood involved.  Enough of my confused rambling.  I apologize if I made no sense what so ever.  I'm getting ready for bed.

      Yeah so I think I have officially gone insane.  I registered for another summer class which brings the total to two.  Two doesn't seem like a lot but it kills my summer for the most part... and my savings.  I have intro to jazz from 5/17 to 6/3, which is for 3 weeks, almost four hours a day.  The second summer class is urban anthropology which takes up 3 weeks in august and has the same days and hours as the other class.  After the class in august ends, I start the fall semester the following week.  Oh and I registered for 18 credits in the fall along with working 30+ hours a week.  It's poop but someone has to do it.  I'm still unsure about my major but at this moment I am half way done with a finance major and I'm beginning a math minor.  I figure the following things can be good about this:  1. I can still work at the bank but in a better paying position with a finance degree. 2. If I leave the bank for another finance job, I will have an edge over other people because of my math minor. 3. If I hate the finance thing, I can go the alternate route and be a math teacher.  Be very afraid for the kids if I go through with it. 4. There is a high demand for people who can do the finance thing and a huge demand for math teachers.  Yay for me!  Anyhoo, nothing really exciting is going on in jersey.  Then again, when is there something exciting happening here?

      Dennis just informed me that today is cinco de mayo.  I hadn't noticed.  Been busy trying to finish my papers.  One's done(in my opinion)-that was the 20 pager.  Another needs some touch-ups-that's the research proposal, and the last one needs about 8 more pages-that's a 10 pager.  I have to say, I like writing, but not research papers.  It always seems like I put stuff into the paper just to make the limit for resources and page length, and the quality never seems that good.  I hope to finish all paper related stuff tomorrow night after work.  Also, both professors just notified me that I have to present the projects in a 20 minute session for my Monday class(the proposal and 10 pager) and a 5 minute blurb for my Tuesday class(the 20 pager).  I wasn't really expecting this, since neither of them mentioned this would be necessary the entire semester, so I'm not about to put forth a great effort.  My efforts are and will be wasted entirely on writing.  Anything else they get from me is a privilege, biatch.    We saw Kill Bill Vol. 2 over the weekend, and I enjoyed it, not as much as the first, but still pretty captivating.  Quentin Tarantino's such a strange man, but I enjoyed most of his movies.  Most.  Glad to hear Matt's having good luck thus far with his school after-life.

      Exactly one week after my interview there, I today received a letter from Bloomfield saying I didn't get the job.  I still don't even know what job it was.  They never told me any grade or school.  Fuck that shit.  It's exactly what happened last year in my interview.  They blew a bunch of smoke up my ass and gave me positive feedback and a day later they're sending me a letter.  Fuck all that.  I had an interview somewhere else today, and will be going back for a second interview in mid-July.  The interviewer was pretty nice and gave me some pointers for my call-back interview.  I really hope I get a job there.  It's a nice district and it's not here.  Afterwards, I got to spend some time with my sister-in-law, who is as cool as a sister-in-law could get.  I don't see her as much as I'd like, so it was nice.  We talked and got some tacos for lunch and hung outside for a while before I left.  Of course when I come home, there's the letter waiting for me and it gets cloudy.  Anyway, that's my day.  I'm tired from getting up early and driving and getting lost among farms.

      Brian and I went to see  Dodgeball  yesterday at the Allwood for a very cool $4.  I think we were the only people in theater laughing at all.  We thought the movie was great but I guess the other movie goers did not share the same sense of humor.  At the start of the movie, Vince Vaughn's dog was licking him in his "special area" and then he said "No grundle."  How great is that?!?  It reminded me of Brandon.  Speaking of Brandon, I wonder how he's doing....  Anyway, I highly recommend  Dodgeball .    Oh and I almost forgot, there was some old guy there that was taking the grandkids to see Shrek 2 or something and was arguing with the girl at the refreshment stand over a dollar.  One lousy, stinkin dollar.  I'm sorry but he could have went to another theater and paid ten bucks a ticket in addition to highly priced snacks so he shouldn't have complained.  The girl was cool about it though.  She was like "I don't know.  There's nothing I can do about it."  And he kept going on and on and she just shrugged her shoulders and moved on to the next customer which just happened to be me and Brian.  I gladly paid my $8 for a medium popcorn and soda.  I know it seems like a lot but it was really good popcorn and admisssion was cheap so it worked out to a very nice $17 for us.

      Welcome weekend.  Please do not flee so fast this time...I ran for the first time in about a month on Thursday morning.  It was one of those things that I thought about doing on Wednesday night, and planned on it, but since I woke up at 5 for some reason, I decided to definitely do it when I finally rolled out of bed an hour later.  I didn't quite know where to go since I still had to get ready for work and all, but I did do it, and was happy with my efforts, but my knees were sore the next day and still a bit today.  That's sort of disheartening since I always stretch and warm up.  I'm anticipating my interview Monday, and hoping things go well.  I even "studied" for my last interview and this one by brushing up on some concepts and things that weren't so fresh in my mind.  I have off from work after the interview, so while I'm near the shore, I'm contemplating hitting up a surf shop to hook myself up with a board and some accessories, but we'll see where the day takes us first.  Don't know what's going on this weekend, but don't want to stay home.    Watched  Simpsons  reruns the other day, and the one where Sideshow Bob runs for mayor was on.  For some reason the funniest part in the episode to me was when Bart is looking thru the phone book and sees the name "A Gorilla" listed...I'm satisfied with the Sixers draft pick, but unimpressed with the trades that occurred.  Boring.  I guess the Lakers turned down the Shaq for Greg Buckner and Glenn Robinson proposal.

      I almost vomited after seeing some rumors about the  urlLink sixers  and the upcoming nba draft.  The first one I saw was Allen Iverson to the Raptors for Vince Carter and the teams would swap first round picks.  That sickened me enough, but then I read one worse:  Sixers trade Samuel Dalembert, one of the few bright spots on the team to Chicago for Tyson Chandler and swap first round picks.  I think the Sixers would get the #3 pick, but I don't care.  According to Billy King, they are just rumors and hold no truth, but I've heard that before.  I swear to god if they do any of those deals, I will drive to Philly and destroy Billy King's office.  Take that, rolodex and fax machine.  I'm highly anticipating our week off.  Did I mention that in my previous blogs?  Well, it may be seen in just about every one from now until July 18th or whenever our fun begins.    One girl at work asked me today if I  really  want to get out of there, and I responded "why, can you tell?"  She sort of smiled and said "yeah."  I guess maybe because I don't talk to anyone at work really and other little things.  I started wearing sneakers instead of shoes, since I ruined 2 pairs of shoes from getting scuffed and torn.  After punching in, I avoid the cashier and go directly to the stock room to waste some time(i.e. drinking my water, eating a granola bar, scratching my balls, "looking" for products to put on the shelf).  I found myself playing with a sponge ball while I was on register last night and bowling for employees.  I got one employee.  I've been wearing a blank label over my name tag since I don't like it when people I don't know call me by my first name, or when my boss isn't working, I take off my name tag.  I can go on, but if I soon start wearing sandals and a hawaiian shirt to work, and gut a fish on the tps report, then you can say I have a problem.

      Interview #1 completed.  Things seemed pretty good, but we'll find out within 3 weeks.  My other is next Monday at 9:30 am in  urlLink Howell .  No, not Mr. & Mrs. Thurston Howell III, but the town in Monmouth County.  Please tell me I can get one of these jobs.  I can't take much more of retail.  Got about another hour or so before I have to leave for work, and as usual, I do not want to go.  Something about stewing over the fact all morning makes things worse.    My brother was covering the U.S. Open all weekend out on Long Island.  It must have been riveting devoting four whole days to golf, especially when it's extremely windy.

      Going to visit my grandmother today.  Also going to hit a ton of traffic on the way.  Tomorrow is father's day, so happy father's day to any father out there... Have an interview Monday and got a call for another one somewhere else either sometime next week or next Monday.  Wish me luck.  Gotta get out of retail.  For shizzle.   Can't wait till the Blue Jays play with all their starters.  That could happen late July.

      Lakers: terminated.  mission: success.  Yes.    So I visited my old student teaching school and my teacher seems to be doing well.  Mostly everything's the same at the school.  She hooked me up with the personnel director's extension.  She was the principal of the school when I was student teaching, so hopefully she'll remember me and remember to give me a job.  It was nice seeing some of the teachers I got along with.  Then I was off to work.  Same old story.  Got home.  Bowflex.  Going to eat dinner.  Peace out.

      My grandmother(my dad's mom) had been in the hospital for the past few weeks undergoing testing, etc.  They believed she had cancer while doing an examination.  The biopsy was "suspicious," whatever that means, but didn't prove anything.  They made her undergo another exam and the biopsy was inconclusive.  They had gone over the treatment options which consisted of radiation 5 days a week and chemo one day a week.  My grandmother is 92 years old.  If you've never met her, you would be amazed at how healthy and smart she is...While there, she also went thru 3 catscans for some reason, and the other day, they tried a different method of exam and did a biopsy by using a needle to get the cells.  This was inconclusive.  So they tell her she has cancer, but yesterday they sent her home because they don't know if she does or not.  They told her the only sure way to tell is surgically, but her doctor stepped in and halted that thought.  They won't be giving her the treatments, at least not yet, so she's home now.  I was going to visit her tomorrow and leave work early, but I'll see what my dad recommends...  I was also supposed to visit the teacher I did my student teaching with today, but my work schedule kind of interferes with that possibility, so I told her tomorrow morning I'll try to catch her before her school day starts.  Got my interview on Monday.  I'm hopeful, but nervous because if I don't get this, then I don't have anyone else lined up with interviews.  At least last year I had a few interviews.  So since Kim's at a gym now, I'm trying to keep up by exercising when she's there.  I've been doing bowflex, but yesterday my arms were dead and I couldn't raise them for a half hour after I stopped.  It wasn't easy taking a shower and not being able to reach above your crotch.  Well, some would say that's a dream come true, but my goal was to cleanse myself and get ready for work.  Our vacation's about a month away!  I'm excited just to do something because I have no money right now.  I just paid my credit card, car payment, doctor bill, bought my bro & sis-in-law an anniversary gift, and my dad a father's day gift.  And my insurance payment gets deducted on Thursday.

      Day 2 of going to the gym...  I did pretty well for the first time on my own.  I pushed myself to keep going even though I was totally tired and kinda in pain.  I actually like the cardio part of the workout but the weights are frickin killer.  My arms are pretty sore.  Maybe if I stretch every five minutes they won't feel so bad :(   Anyway, as I was leaving the gym, there was a fire a block away.  Is that a sign?  I just hope the fire doesn't spread because I (gulp) like the gym.  Did I just say that?  Anyhoo, nothing new is going on... as usual.  Me and Bri went mini golfing yesterday and I won despite a terrible start.  I was really happy about that.  I guess I get excited over the little things.  We also exercised together on Saturday.  We went for a walk around the hood and then we took turns on his BowFlex.  That thing is pretty cool.  It actually helped get rid of the soreness I felt in my arms from my first day at the gym.    Gotta run.  Dinner's here...

      I've been in dormant blog mode this week for some reason.  I guess there hasn't been much to talk about besides work, and Kim blogged about the one event of the week, which was  Braid .  It's Friday, and I'm home from work, although tired.  Got to shower in a minute and try to re-wake myself up after sleepwalking thru work since 5:30 am.  I feel like doing something this weekend, but I'm not sure exactly what.  Just feel the need to get out for once...I don't know who won the game last night nor do I care.  One person at work insists on asking me every time he comes in whether I saw the Lakers game.  I respond every time by saying "no, and I don't plan on watching the other games."  He then continues by telling me what happened like he's the orator for the associated press.  Lots of drama at work lately probably leading to someone I get along with being transferred out.  The mangagers just don't know how to fix problems among employees, but insist on transferring someone out rather than working at a solution.  Anyway, stop letting me ramble.  Enjoy the weekend biznatches!

      Today was my first day at the gym and as if anyone cares I shall discuss what I did...  I had an appointment at 6:30 with Joyce, who was very nice.  She measured and weighed me (this was the worse part) and then she started me on this machine that is kinda like that gazelle thing you see on infomercials.  I did that for 15 minutes and wanted to drop.  After, she showed me what machines I should use and how to use them.  I won't get into each and every machine, but I think there were 6 total.  After the weights, I did 20 minutes on a treadmill which wasn't so bad but once I stopped I could have sworn I was walking really funny.  Anyhoo, it was quite the experience and since it wasn't so painful I might go back on Saturday.  If not Saturday, then definitely Monday.    Work is going okay.  I'm learning more stuff now since I am officially a full time employee.  As a part of my new duties, I get to accept application packages from customers and go over everything with them.  I especially love seeing people who make $10k a month and buy brand new mansions all over Jersey.  I wouldn't know what to do with $10k a month.  We actually had one customer that made $70k a month.  I'm not kidding.  We thought that was his salary for the year, but when we saw the W2's, we basically all crapped our pants.  Yeah and his house was worth 1.9 million.  Ridiculous. I love looking at the appraisals for the houses though.  Actually, I love imagining the house is mine and figuring out how to redecorate it.  There are lots of new houses being built in jersey.  It's amazing that nj is the most densely populated state and yet somehow we find room to keep building houses.  And as I look through appraisals, I find it cool that houses are so much cheaper/expensive in certain areas.  For instance, there was a beautiful brand new house (5 bedrooms, 4.5 baths, dining room, study, kitchen with dining area, finished basement on almost 2 acres of property, etc.) in Sparta.. the town.. not Dennis... that would be scary...  Anyway, it was worth $700,000 but I'm pretty sure if you moved it to bergen county or around the clifton/montclair area, it would be worth twice as much easy.  I'm going to stop rambling about houses now.   Hope everyone is doing well and eating lots of fried oreos.

      Me and Bri went to see Braid last nite at Starland Ballroom in Sayreville.  The place was in the middle of nowhere.  Actually it was in the middle of this road with nothing but trees.  The place was smaller than everyone made it out to be.  They had some silly yet understandable rules about the 21 and under kids not being allowed near the bar.  Anyway, Braid played an hour and it kicked a$$!  I believe me and Brian are going to 2 more shows this summer: 311 and Face to Face.  Both should be fun, especially 311 since that show happens during our vacation.  Mmmm... vacation.  I wish I was on vacation right now, but I'm stuck here at work until 5 and then heading to the gym for the first time today.  I'm dreading it but I paid the money so I might as well go.

      Greetings from Asbury Park!!  Wait, that's a Springsteen song.  Greetings from Chapel Hill.  That's better.  So I've been running around here with a chicken without its head trying to get stuff ready for my conference.  This is supposed to be summer, but so far I've had to prepare a poster, a talk, and my masters thesis all in the span of two weeks.  Crazy times. This weekend was indeed crazy as my friends and I decided to go on Absinthe binge this weekend.  For those of you who don't know Absinthe, it is a green liquor made in the Czech Republic.  It very potent and contains wormwood which is a hallucegenic, which is why it is not sold here in the US of A.  However, my friends brought some back from Europe and man I got pretty lit.  It didn't help that we were at a party and I kinda of tweeked, but it was fun.  Something I would recommend to try once. This week I'm going to see The Shins in concert.  Pretty awesome band.  I advise the bloggers to pick up "Chutes Too Narrow" by them.  You'll be in for a treat. Bri-Memorial Day Tip (when relaying the ball from home, make sure you hit the cutoff!) Kev-at the NC state fair, we have fried oreos along with fried snickers.  Great for the Atkins diet Peace out and may the force be with you!!   PS: did anyone see the most metal moments on VH1.  Very funny.

      Got my oil changed in my car today, but the big problem was that my car hasn't been starting correctly.  Anyway, I have to bring it back next Monday because it has a faulty fuel pump.  Then I have to get a loaner car for the day and go back again on Tuesday to pick my car up when it is ready(hopefully).  The service guys said Mazda was aware of the faulty fuel pump, so my question is: why wasn't I informed?  You know, because I drive the car.  So now I have nothing to do for 7 hours before the  Braid  show tonite.  I'll probably vacuum and clean my car since I didn't have the chance to do such things Friday.    Did I ever mention on the ole blog that I have an interview on June 21st?  I don't recall, but I do have an interview with Bloomfield for a leave replacement for next school year.  Hey, an interview is a huge step!  I haven't had one in about 9 months, so maybe my bad luck has worn off.    I'm actually a little upset that I'm going to miss game 7 of the Stanley Cup tonite.  Yeah, me upset over missing a hockey game?!  Off to do something non-constructive with my time.

      Well, that clears up the oreo mystery.  Thanks.  I still don't know if I could eat one though.  I did just finish eating some mixed nuts, and while I found that I consumed 24% of my fat content for the day, I also took in 20% of my copper allowance.  Sweet, now I can self-manufacture pennies(i.e. when I make a deposit into the toilet, it can be taken literally now!).  Sorry for that gross pictorial.  I got home about an hour ago from the  urlLink Mets  game with my brother.  They actually won, 5-2.  It was a pretty good game if you take away the fact that it was 50 and windy.  We got to Shea in about 40 minutes, which is spectacular, especially when the Yanks are also playing a 1 o'clock game at home.  My brother had hoped Smarty Jones would throw out the first pitch, but we got a worker from Gold's horseradish & mustard company instead.  Anyway, the game started with Juan Pierre bunting his way on and then getting thrown out at 2nd as Luis Castillo K'd.  In the bottom of the 1st, Animal Piazza roped a 2-run double to get the Mets on the board.  The inning ended with the Mets up 3-0.  No runs scored for either team until the bottom of the 5th, when Piazza lined a homer 410 feet against a stiff inbound wind.  He drove in 4 of the 5 runs, and the game was quiet until the top of the 9th, when Braden Looper came in for the Mets.  He looked pretty awful and allowed 2 runs.  With 1 out and the bases loaded, he struck out Miguel Cabrera and got Conine to fly out.  Game over.  Mets win.    The ride home sent us through Korea, or at least a very big Korean population in Queens, before we realized we were stuck on the wrong side of the highway.  Had to u-turn to get back on track and hit the LIE.  Hit some slow traffic in midtown before trudging thru the tunnel.  All in all, took an hour and a half to get home.  Now I have to look forward to taking my car in for repairs tomorrow morning and not watching the NBA finals.  P.S.-Al Leiter's batting average is higher than Mike Cameron's.

      Picture an oreo, that was dipped in the batter that is used to make funnel cakes, and deep fried.  It looks like a zeppole, but there is an oreo-y surprise on the inside... mmmmm...

      Fried Oreos?!  I can't picture someone putting an Oreo in a pan with some butter and cooking it.  I don't know, tell me more...I was a little disappointed because I missed the end of the Tampa/Calgary game last night.  I saw up until 2:00 into OT, but fell asleep before anything happened.  A pretty good game based on what I saw.  Ended the week by working from 5:30-2:30 for our truck.  Actually anticipated cleaning my car afterwards, but there was nowhere to park my car when I got home in order to vacuum or wash it.  Speaking of my car-my  new  car-I have to bring it to the dealership on Monday morning because it isn't starting right.  The engine isn't turning over properly, so it's been taking 2 tries to start it.  Not bad considering I have just passed the 3,000 mile mark.  Are you serious? Yes, yes I am.  I got a bit of good news today when I checked my phone messages.  Bloomfield called me up about an interview for a teaching job for next year.  It's a leave replacement, so I have no idea how long it lasts, it probably doesn't offer benenfits, and if it's for the whole school year I won't have a job the next year again, etc.  I go at 11 am on Monday, June 21st, so hopefully I'll find out more then.    Shopping & lunch tomorrow with  Kim  & her mom.  Mets game with my bro Sunday, and Braid on Monday(after waiting for my car to get fixed).  Enjoy the weekend.

      Greetings from the wonderful state of Connecticut.  Last nite marked the end of my second class on the way to my MBA.  I had my Economics (Micro & Macro) final, turned in my group paper, and presented our findings to the class.  I had to study my ass off Wednesday and and Thursday afternoon, before the exam, but it was worth it.  He somewhat graded our exams during our presentations, and since our presentations were just summaries of our papers, he was able to give us our grades last nite.  So, I got another 'A'.  Three cheers for me.  And there is no rest for the wicked... I start my Marketing class on Tuesday.  That's 2 classes down, 15 more to go.  In other news, I spent Memorial Day Weekend in East Durham, NY (it's in the Catskills).  Myself and two friends of mine spent two nites camping and we spent the days at the 27th annual  urlLink East Durham Irish Festival .  It was a lot of fun.  There a lot of really good bands playing, but two really stood out:  urlLink Hair of the Dog  and  urlLink The Screaming Orphans .  Hair of the Dog is a really fun, upbeat Irish Folk-ish band.  And I was really impressed by The Screaming Orphans.  Ignoring the fact that they are rather attractive Irish girls with killer accents, they can really play.  They are a meld of many styles, you can hear some Irish folk, country, singer/songwriter, and even some Cranberries in their songs.  They were very enjoyable.  The rest of the time at the festival we spent drinking Guinness and wandering around.  Oh, and the food there was good too.  There was only one Irish food stand and the rest was your normal festival-type fare, but it was all really good.  Especially the fried oreos and the apple dumplings with ice cream...  Mmmmmm... fried oreo... mmmmmmm...  Ok, now that I've wiped the drool from my chin...  I finally got to see Life of Agony a few weeks ago, and they were amazing.  Candiria openned for them and blew my mind.  I would not suggest Candiria to just anyone, they are definietly an aquired taste; with their fusion of grindcore, metal, rap, and jazz.  They are extremely unique, and thats what I love about them.  I picked up the new Fear Factory album (Archetype) the other day, and I haven't taken it out of my car's CD player since.  A few other things I am anticipating this summer are: the new Bad Religion album, the new Less Than Jake DVD, the new Chuck Palahniuk book, and my month and a half off from school starting July 9th.  Oh well, that's enough out of me, I really should be doing some work while I am here...

      Today is the last day of my Intro to Jazz class.  I am somewhat saddened by this because I liked the class and the professor.  The best part was beating rush hour traffic coming home.  Now I officially start work again full time. Bleh.  I signed up at a gym yesterday.  I know what you're thinking, "Kim? At a gym? Hahahahahaha!"  But seriously I did join and it seems like a cool place.  It's a women's only club and I signed up with a friend from work which should give me the incentive to actually go.  On Tuesday, we're going to meet with a personal trainer to take our weight and measurements and then she'll tell us how to decrease those dreadful numbers.  I think we start on a weight training program that day.  Weights are fine as long as I don't look like one of the chicks from American Gladiators.    Braid show on Monday.  I'm really excited for this show because I never got to see Braid play together (and I get to leave work at 3:30).  Actually, I've seen 3/4 of Braid play at a Hey Mercedes show, but I guess Chris Broach makes all the difference with his screaming/singing.  Should be fun.  I heard from Katie that Brandon and John will be there.  Yet another Sam Goody reunion, but they're always fun so no complaints here.  Must go.  Boss may be getting suspicious of my excessive internet usage.

      I currently hate the NBA.  Could there possibly be a worse finals matchup in my mind?  Well, maybe if it were the Bulls from Jordan's era vs. the Lakers of today.  I refuse to watch the finals.  And to top it off, the draft is garbage.  Who the hell is available for the draft?  Everyone already came out of college or high school.  The only thing I'm interested in is seeing who's left unprotected in the expansion draft...  Keeping on the sports topic, the  urlLink Jays  put their 7th player on the disabled list.  Here's the list of people who are currently on the list: *Justin Miller-starting pitcher *Justin Speier-closing pitcher *Kevin Cash-starting catcher *Greg Myers-catcher/DH *Orlando Hudson-starting 2B *Chris Woodward-starting SS *Frank Catalanotto-starting LF  In addition, Roy Halladay, the Cy Young winner from last season was scratched from his start tonite due to shoulder stiffness.  Jason Kershner, a long reliever who I like a lot, started in his place.  He's never started a game before.  Also, Carlos Delgado, their starting 1st baseman, isn't playing because of a sore knee.  He may end up on the DL.  So that's my rant about sports.  Other than that, there was a tornado that touched down about 30 minutes away from me today.  That's interesting.   Kim  and I watched a show on Animal Planet called  Venom ER .  It's a pretty cool show about snakebite victims I'd recommend if you've got nothing better to do on a Tuesday night.  I'm trying to stay up until 12:30 in order to watch Aqua Teen Hunger Force on Cartoon Network.  Michael, the photo guy at work, insists I watch the show, especially the episode at 12:15 tonite.  I usually don't watch solely because I am sleeping, but he urges me not to miss tonite's episode.  Watch it with me if you will.  Going to the Mets/Marlins game on Sunday.  Please pray for no rain!

      Inventory is over, and apparently it went well.&nbsp; That means my manager gets a really nice bonus and I & my fellow workers get absolute shit.&nbsp; I'm glad it's over, but I'm tired as hell.&nbsp; I'm about to go to bed because I worked 10 hours yesterday and had to be in at 7 and work until 4 today.&nbsp; I need some sleep.&nbsp; Anyway, there's about 70 movies I want to see that are all new.&nbsp; Let's see, there's:  The Bourne Supremecy ,  Garden State ,  The Village , and  Catwoman .&nbsp; I'm only kidding about the last one, and that's only 3 movies I want to see, not 70.&nbsp; The only reason I would watch the last one is because  Kim Smith  is in the movie, and she's hot(sorry babe!).&nbsp;   I keep getting these credit card offers in the mail from Fleet and it's getting really annoying.&nbsp; I don't need any more debt, thanks.&nbsp; Oh, the Nets traded Kerry Kittles for a big ol' sack of nothing.&nbsp; That's kind of funny.&nbsp; So who's their 2-guard?&nbsp; Rodney Rogers?&nbsp; Lucious Harris?&nbsp; I should talk, because the Sixers new point guard is Kevin Ollie.&nbsp; And they still have Big Dog and DC on the team.&nbsp; Why?!&nbsp; I'm obviously crabby.&nbsp; It's off to bed I go.

      In keeping with the annual tradition(?) of summarizing my vacation on the blog, I will soon detail my week off.&nbsp; It was a good week overall.&nbsp; I spent the week with  Kim , so that was the best part.&nbsp; We left last Tuesday and came home yesterday[Sunday].         &nbsp; 07.20 Tue&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I arrived at Kim's house at about 9 am.&nbsp; We headed to Friendly's to catch some breakfast, which was delectable-pancakes with apples on top.&nbsp; We hit the atm and then the parkway en route to  urlLink Delicious Orchards , which is in Colts Neck, and relatively close to my bro & sis-in-law's house in Point Pleasant.&nbsp; The place is basically a farmer's market, but they have the best breads, cookies, and donuts as well.&nbsp; The donuts are made with apple cider and they don't taste like grease.&nbsp; So we made a rather quick stop there because I hate grocery stores.&nbsp; We stocked up on fruits & veggies for the week and continued south on Route 34 to our destination.&nbsp; We arrived at about 12 and unpacked a bit.&nbsp; We decided to eat Mexican food, so we ordered some  Burro Burrito , which has damn good tacos.&nbsp; After devouring our lunch and Goya soda, we changed and went into the pool.&nbsp; The rest of the afternoon consisted of lounging on inflatable rafts in the pool while the sun dashed in and out of the clouds.&nbsp; For dinner, I tried grilling some burgers on the Fiesta grill, but 2 of the burgers decided to catch fire and the flames kept shooting sky high.&nbsp; The food turned out ok, but that ended the grilling right then and there for the week.&nbsp; Afterwards, I think we watched&nbsp;tv before turning in.  07.21 Wed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We woke up without a clue what to do because Kim's friends,  Liz  and  Christine ,&nbsp;were supposed to drop in around 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to go to the beach since it was still early, so we went and it was blazing.&nbsp; I ended up sweating out all of the lotion&nbsp;I applied and we didn't go in the water because the waves were rough.&nbsp; Some old guy&nbsp;next to us kept saying how cold the water was and everyone&nbsp;was&nbsp;mumbling about jellyfish.&nbsp; We thought the water was beautiful, but didn't go in because of the high waves.&nbsp; We&nbsp;went back to the house after about an hour to go in the pool.&nbsp; Liz &&nbsp;Christine arrived around 3:30 or so and we stayed in the pool for a while.&nbsp; We went to&nbsp;dinner at Friday's and came home to watch Pirates of the Caribbean on dvd.  07.22 Thu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The four of us went to the beach on a cooler and breezier day.&nbsp; We ate at the snack bar by the beach and enjoyed getting obliterated by the waves.&nbsp; We all took turns&nbsp;falling on our asses and getting sucked back into the sea.&nbsp; All in all, a very fun time.&nbsp; We were all tired when we got home, however, and Liz & Christine had to drive home, so we all cleaned off and they went on their way.&nbsp; Kim & I decided to use our year-old gift certificates to the Loews theater&nbsp;&nbsp;and catch  I, Robot .&nbsp;&nbsp;We both enjoyed it to my brother's&nbsp;recommendation, and&nbsp;brought home a box of KFC chicken fingers and mashed potatoes to eat with our fresh corn on the&nbsp;cob from the orchard.  07.23 Fri&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I intended on visiting the&nbsp;Barnegat&nbsp;lighthouse to catch a glimpse of some good scenery and finally take some pictures, but it was rainy and overcast during the day.&nbsp; I really wanted to go because I have this bad habit of never taking pictures,&nbsp;but so the&nbsp;trend continued.&nbsp; We went to the boardwalk since we hadn't gone yet and because I had a bag of quarters to burn at the arcades, but it was&nbsp;terribly crowded with trash and thuggery.&nbsp; We&nbsp;got in a few minutes of the original Simpsons arcade game and some pinball, but otherwise&nbsp;were afraid of contracting an STD&nbsp;from the crowds.&nbsp;&nbsp;We played&nbsp;some mini golf&nbsp;and got stuck behind&nbsp;Orca's family of 7 children and 11 total&nbsp;members.&nbsp; They took their sweet-(fat)ass time even though there were two pairs of people behind them who they could have easily let pass.&nbsp; Anyway, it began raining, so we finished and I wanted to find Manasquan inlet since I heard it was great for surfing, but the directions I remember hearing said go past Jenkinson's aquarium and you'll run into the inlet.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I didn't,&nbsp;and&nbsp;didn't feel like looking for it&nbsp;as the rain fell harder.&nbsp; I think we went to go buy chicken for dinner and watched the Usual Suspects dvd.&nbsp; Kim made an excellent&nbsp;rosemary chicken dish with the rest of the corn on the cob and rice-a-roni!&nbsp; Yum.&nbsp; We attempted to watch Meatballs and Kingpin on dvd, but didn't get thru either of them&nbsp;due to our lack&nbsp;of laughter.  07.24 Sat&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today was really our last day because we planned on leaving early Sunday to beat traffic home.&nbsp; I wanted to jump in the pool one last time, but it was in the upper 60s and cloudy until late afternoon, so that didn't happen.&nbsp; We ended up doing some laundry and cleaning up.&nbsp; We got ready for the  urlLink 311  show at the  urlLink PNC Arts Center &nbsp;&nbsp;that nite.&nbsp; We left around 5:30 or so to get some dinner beforehand, but just weren't hungry, so we decided to get to the place and eat there.&nbsp; We arrived around 6 and parked light years away and walked to the arts center thru whores, drunks, and guys who thought they looked like Spicoli from Fast Times.&nbsp; The rain was going to hold off at least, and it wasn't too hot.&nbsp; The show started at 6:35 with  Medeski, Martin, & Wood , who were pretty good I thought, and the limited crowd that was seated and not tailgating thought so too.&nbsp;  The Roots  came on next, and more people filtered in to see them.&nbsp; They were awesome musicians, and played for a good hour.&nbsp; 311 came on about 9:10 and played for 2 hours!&nbsp; They were as good as the last time we saw them.&nbsp; They sound good live and are pretty personable with the crowd.&nbsp; The only negative was the abundance of pot smoke in our faces and the couple seated in front of us who insisted on turning around and staring every minute at us or whoever moved in the row we were in.&nbsp; There was also a couple behind us who were making out or "fucking snuggling" as Kim put it so amusingly the entire show.&nbsp; It was pretty sickening.&nbsp; After the long walk back to the car, we got out relatively smoothly and brought massive headaches home with us.&nbsp;   07.25 Sun&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We finished packing and fed the fish and drove to get gas and breakfast sandwiches at Dunkin Donuts before driving for the parkway north.&nbsp; We left around 12:15 and got back to the home about an hour later.&nbsp; Disappointed to be home, but happy we missed traffic that would have built up as the day moved on.&nbsp;   Today sucks as it's back to work.&nbsp; Our inventory is this week and I could care less, even though it's supposed to be my responsibility.&nbsp; I'm looking for a new job, since I realize the teaching thing is just going to kill my slowly.&nbsp; I need to find myself and figure out what to do.&nbsp; The only thing I know now is that the current place of employment is not where I want to be at the end of August.&nbsp; I applied online last nite to a few hotels, which I thought would be more interesting and I might have a chance to work my way up.&nbsp; In addition, I also investigated&nbsp;the postal service since my grandfather was a postman forever, but they don't have any current openings anywhere near here.&nbsp; If you have any ideas for me,  urlLink let me know , please.

      Hello everyone,  It is 9:00 on Sunday and I'm at the lab procrastinating finsihing up one of my questions on my doctoral qualifying exam.&nbsp; This exam sucks ass since it consists of 3 reserach questions which need to be completed by this Friday.&nbsp; So I'm getting pretty stressed.  I came back from Vancouver a couple of weeks ago from a conference and I had a blast.&nbsp; The West Coast definetly kicks ass and hopefully, if I pass these exams, I can enjoy either Portland (Oregon Health Sciences U) or Seatlle (Wash. U.) as my permament address.  I found out yesterday that Franz Ferdinand is playing at the Cat's Cradle in Chapel Hill.&nbsp; I am so psyched!!&nbsp; This club only holds around 500 and has good acoustics.&nbsp; Hopefully, tix will not sell out.&nbsp; My friends and I saw Bourne Supremacy, which was really good (1st one was better though).&nbsp; Thankfully, we were able to use our veto power over the girls' wish to see Catwoman.&nbsp;  In other news, we got a beach house for our conference in San Diego in October.&nbsp; Pretty sweet, right on Mission Beach .&nbsp; The best thing about San Diego, you'll only 20 minutes from Tijuana.&nbsp; I already told my boss, my attendance at the conference will probably minimal at best.&nbsp; More time to the enjoy the local culture (tequilla, beach, tequilla, zoo, tequilla, etc).&nbsp; Anyway, back to work.&nbsp; Hope everyone is faring well.   Later,  Dennis

      If you haven't read my last post, then please read the final paragraph I wrote, and then I'll tell you I called Howell again today.&nbsp; Let's just leave it at that.&nbsp; Leave for "vacation" tomorrow, and that's about all I care about right now.&nbsp; When I get back, I will contemplate leaving this area and finding a new job, because obviously teaching is a big fat joke right now.&nbsp; I can deal with getting rejected for a job because I've been thru it for 2 years now, but when someone promises a real chance at getting a job, and doesn't have the balls to call you, and you have to find out for yourself that the jobs suddenly aren't available, it's absolute bullshit.

      Salutations to you, blog.&nbsp; It's been a while, and yet I still have nothing to write about.&nbsp; Well, ok, I do I guess.&nbsp; It's officially our vacation.&nbsp; That's right, no work until next Monday.&nbsp; Going to Point Pleasant from Tuesday thru Sunday.&nbsp; Should be fun, even though the weather forecast is not so good right now.&nbsp; There's plenty of stuff to do-beach, pool, boardwalk, movies, arcade, six flags, aquarium, barnegat lighthouse, driving down route 35.&nbsp; If it rains a lot, then it stinks, but at least there's some stuff to do down there.&nbsp; Next Saturday is the 311 concert at the arts center, and I'm psyched for that.&nbsp; I think that might be the first concert I'm seeing there since third eye blind.&nbsp; Remember that, Kev?&nbsp; How many drinks did we have before ordering tickets?&nbsp; Anyway, don't know what to do  this  weekend, however.&nbsp; Nice today, but not tomorrow.&nbsp; Maybe it's a good weekend for a movie, walk in the park, packing I guess would be helpful, too.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Just finished mowing the lawn, and boy, was that a mistake!&nbsp; The ground was still wet from showers yesterday, and all the grass that was cut ended up sticking to my legs.&nbsp; I felt like I had the legs of the incredible hulk, except they weren't muscular, and my pants weren't tattered, and I was wearing shoes.&nbsp; Apparently, my picture can no longer be used over on the right side of the blog for some reason.&nbsp; I guess freeservers wants me to pay for their website tools just to post my pictures on it.&nbsp; That's not gonna happen. &nbsp; Still haven't heard from Howell about my second interview, and that isn't cool.&nbsp; I'm gonna call again on Monday, but I hope they don't pull some crap about there being no jobs suddenly.&nbsp; Hate retail.&nbsp; Cannot go on anymore.

      This weekend was probably the best one I have had in a long time.  It was very relaxing, fun, and as always, waaaaay to fast.  Brian and I went down to Point Pleasant to spend the weekend with Kevin and Rachel.  On Saturday, we went out to eat at this bar restaurant place called Frankie's.  We had awesome nachos and, I think, an okay dinner.  After we ate, we went back to their place and we played this game about movie trivia which I really sucked at.  Oh well.  On Sunday, we all went down to Brick beach.  The water was beautiful... warm and clean.  I know what you're thinking.  New Jersey shore has clean water?  Yes, but it's not like Carribbean clear or anything.  After, we went to the butcher to pick up chicken and ribs for dinner.  When we got back to their house, we jumped in the pool for a while and then we ate.  We also walked to Dairy Queen for some ice cream.  Soon after, we left to face the wonderful Parkway.  Even though we left around 9:30 pm, we still hit a lot of traffic.  It was mostly stop and go, but annoying nevertheless.    I can't wait until next week when we are down in Point Pleasant for the week.  I need to get away from North Jersey and work.  Boo to work :(

      Happy July 4th, or Independence Day as it's been formerly known.  I'm not one of those history appreciating folks, but it seems every year, the term Independence Day is used less, except when they air the movie of the same name on Fox tonite.  But that doesn't count because Bill Pullman makes an awful president anyway.  So the day goes, where everyone barbeques and drinks.  Nighttime comes and some jackass neighbor insists on shooting fireworks onto your house/car/hair because he's too drunk to properly aim them  away .  As I was discussing with Kim, there's something that kills me about fireworks.  I don't hate them, but I don't love them.  I don't enjoy getting bitten by mosquitos while watching probably the worst display in America(Bloomfield), and I can't tolerate watching them on tv[honestly, I'd rather watch reruns of Match Game on the gameshow network].  I guess it would be fascinating if you owned a boat and were on the ocean or the Hudson while they were shooting.  Anyway, enjoy your Independence Day for whatever reason.  I'm going to enjoy mine since I'm independent from work today.

      I have yet to welcome July with a blog, so here's one.  Tomorrow's the 4th, and not much planned for the weekend.  Tonight I'm actually taking my mom out for her mother's day dinner.  What, you ask...Mother's day in July?  Well, I had promised her a dinner as her mother's day gift, but we never had a chance to go out until now I guess.  I'm currently watching tennis.  Maria Sharapova vs. Serena Williams.  Sharapova is serving for the set, and I really hope she wins.   {Pauses to watch}    Wow!  She won.  I've never seen a 17-year old woman hit a tennis ball so hard.  That's cool...Tomorrow's probably a bbq of some sort at my house, but nothing major.  Just the small family I believe.

      Went to the mall with  Kim  for the first time in a while tonite.  Ate "dinner" at Nathan's, and it was deplorable.  She got some clothes for work and I ended up getting 2 baseball caps-a  Jays  & a  urlLink Mets  cap-for $15.  Not bad considering the price of most caps today.  I'm tired because I went to another store to help unload their truck at 7 am, and had to go to my store afterwards to work.  My manager made me do pointless work from 3:30 to 5, even though I started work early.  He was complaining yesterday that he has no overtime hours, yet he makes me stay and get 2 hours of overtime for something he could have done himself since he's there until 10 tonite.  I was really close to pulling a  Milton  today, but didn't.  There's always tomorrow.  Probably gonna go sleep soon.

      Yesterday was a long day.  I had to go to work at 5:30 to help unload truck.  I stayed until 9:30 and came home.  I then tried to nap, but maybe mustered an hour of sleep out of 2 hours in bed.  I showered and changed and  urlLink Kim  called.  She had to work as well from 8-1.  Boo to working on Saturday.  Anyway, we were to go down to my brother's to go to a  urlLink Blueclaws  game with them and meet up with my uncle.  We ate some  Boston Market  for lunch and she drove, thank god, because of my lack of sleep.  We didn't hit much traffic until we got to Asbury Park, but that didn't matter much since our exit was a mile ahead.  We arrived at my brother's house to find him working on a stoop by the back door with his father-in-law.  They had been working since 11:30 and it was now 3:30 or so.  They continued working for another 2 hours roughly, and we all sat down to some grilled burgers and corn before scurrying over to the field.  The game was pretty terrible as the Blueclaws committed 5 errors.  The Bombers were leading 6-1 going into the bottom of the 9th with only 5 hits.  The Claws scored 3 runs in the bottom of the inning and lost 6-4.  Afterwards, there was a rather intriguing fireworks display at the field.  Some stuff we hadn't seen before.  We headed back to my brother's house and got back home a little after midnight.  I am glad today didn't start out with work at 5:30, so I'm pretty happy today.

      Hello everyone, I've finished my qualifying exams.  If everything goes well, it should be the last exam I ever have to take.  This past week, I've been trying to catch up on work/sleep/etc.  I've also been listening to a lot of  The Smiths  and  Joy Division  and realizing how good both these bands were.  Morrissey is touring in NC this summer so I'm definetly going to try to catch him out.   Saw  The Village  the other day and t was not as bad as I thought it was going to be.  So far the best summer movies I have seen are  Spiderman 2,  Farenheit 911,  and  The Bourne Supremacy .   Also, bought  Franz Ferdinand  tix.  Going to see thme 9/11 at the Cats Cradle.  Should be a pretty kick ass show.  BTW,I was at Best Buy and I saw that  Knight Rider  season 1 is out.  Ahh, Hasselehoff at his absolute acting prime.  later

      I'm actually impressed.  The  urlLink Sixers  made a trade and got someone who wasn't washed up.  They got  Corliss Williamson  from Detroit for  DC .  I thought Coleman had a few good seasons with the sixers, but last season was just a wash because of his injury.  Now they have three good, strong forwards in Williamson,  Skinner  and  Dalembert .  Unfortunately, they still have  Big Dog , who will hopefully be traded soon as well.  In related Detroit Pistons news, they signed  Horace Jenkins  today.  Who?  You may ask...Well, he was a stellar guard who played for  urlLink William Paterson University  and led them to the Final 4, but never got a break.  Since then, he's been tearing up the Italian League and leading there in scoring.  Good luck, Horace.  Hope you make the cut!  Kim and I saw the  Bourne Supremacy  tonite, and would strongly recommend seeing it.  We both thought it was better than the first.  Good chase scenes and good flow overall.  Still must see Garden State.

      Brian and I went to see  The Bourne Supremacy  tonight and I must urge everyone to go see it. As in the first movie, there is a lot of shaky camera action but it didn't really bother me. Everything about the movie was incredible: Matt Damon, the chase scenes, the fights, etc. The sequel was actually better than the original which happens very rarely. Matt Damon never really struck me as a spy/action hero guy, but I must say that after watching the first movie again and this one, I think he was perfect for the part and he seems tons more comfortable with the role than he was in  The Bourne Identity .  Anyhoo, classes start again in a month and I am not looking forward to going back. I checked up the prices of some of my textbooks and one book costs $200. And I'm pretty sure that when I sell it back one of two things will happen: 1. they will give me five bucks for it, or 2. not take it back at all. My luck, it's going to be the later.  One two years of this crap left.

      Kim just informed me that  Ozma  broke up.  Their last cd was pretty terrible, but their first two were fun.  Plus, they gave us a good show at Krome a few years back.  Add to the list of many bands that have broken up.  I've been working on my  urlLink webpage  a bit since yesterday.  I haven't changed much, but I'm just fixing up a few things and making it lot a little fresher.  May go see the  Bourne Supremecy  tomorrow with Kim.  I've only been home for about 2 weeks, and I'm already sick of my house.  I don't want to think of what it'll be like in the winter.  Ugh.  winter.  Anyway, my manager keeps talking promotion to me, which would make me an assistant manager, but I really don't want it.  I'm already not enjoying my job, so why would I want to spend more time there, and have a crappy schedule.  Yeah I get more money, but I don't know if it's worth it.  I'm not making a decision until the summer's almost over.

      Welcome to August, the month where I still whine about summer ending and going back to school in  September , even though I'm not in school anymore, and it's only August 2nd.  I guess old habits are tough to break.  Anyway, this is it.  It's the final chance for finding a teaching job before another new school year begins.  Chances are, it won't happen, but I'm way past feeling sorry for myself.  In some ways I find it to be some sort of sign telling me not to do it, which would have been more helpful had I known 3 years ago so I could have graduated without going another year for teaching.  So life continues mocking me and everyone else.  I hope to visit Point Pleasant at least 2 more times before summer's over, as well as getting up to Boston if all works out ok.  Should make for an enjoyable month at least.  Kim & I already want to go to Curacao for our next vacation, whenever the hell that may be.  First comes job, then money, then paying off debt, then saving money, then vacation.  In my world, conversely, the pattern goes: vacation, hopefully job, never having money, you only live once, why not enjoy yourself and be broke before you have major responsibilities.   Ramble on.  I finally used my aim account again, but it made me upgrade before I did anything, and I haven't noticed much difference.  Saw  The Village  on Saturday evening, but wasn't impressed.  I thought it was slow and I knew what the "twist" was before it was revealed at the end.  I'm not a film critic either, but usually I'm easy to appease.  I've watched some truly awful movies and didn't complain too much, so compared to the likes of  Going Overboard  or, say,  Star Wars Episode I , it was pretty good.  The idea was interesting, but the movie did not do it much justice.  Oh well.  Two more movies to catch before the end of next weekend that shouldn't disappoint.   I purchased the new Hives cd and the My Chemical Romance cd the other day and like both of them, but I also purchased the Roots new cd and was disappointed because the show was so good compared to the album.  I must say, I still enjoy music, but my knowledge and purchasing has dropped off since my days at the music store ended 2 years ago.  I don't think there will be a correlation with me buying drugs at my current place of employment and a decline after I leave however.  I'm in the mood for Doritos.
