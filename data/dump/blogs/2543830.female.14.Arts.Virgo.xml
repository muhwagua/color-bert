      RUN!!  no, wait... thats what I wanted!  YAY!   She's coming today!  funfunfunfunfunfufnunfunfunfun....  HUZZAH!   I'm happy, and hyper, so its 'sall good.  What in the name of ....um...cheese am I talking about?   OOO!  Something I just want to tell everybody ( espesially wheaton)  I actually WON an argument!  HUZZAH!  It was about Incubi and Succubi, ( yeahyeah I know thats kindof sick) But the guy I was arguing with said that Incubi only "attacked" women, and that Succubi did men.   But I don't see why an Incubi can't do that to men also?  I mean, they're demons for crying out loud!  They don't have RULES about who they can and can't ....  "attack"  oops, this is totally inapropriate, Don't repeat a word I just said,  its very sick.  And if you don't know what an Incubus and a Succubus is then DON'T find out!  Jeez, why am I so morbid?  And why do I dwell on the ...um... pleasures of demons?  nastynastynastynasty....AARRG  I'll shut up now!  So sorry

      I love rock operas ... well, Tommy and Rocky at least.  Could you call Rocky Horror a rock opera? probably.  Tommy is disturbing ( not that Rocky isn't) Tommy is about a deaf, dumb, and blind boy... and is very disturbing.  But Rocky Horror Picture Show is about an alian.  He's a sweet transvestite from transexual translvania... so its quite disturbing too.  Wow, I'm really freaky, I love really freaky things.  I'm also morbid, its so sad... ::sob::

      ITS CHRISTMAS! WHO- wait a minute....I've been saying "whoot" way to much, I need a new word.  ::thinks::  PANG! no, WHOOP! no, HUZZAH!  ok, that will do for now.  HUZZAH!   I am currently writing a story! YAY for me!  Anouther story that I'll probably NEVER finish and will NEVER show to anyone, I'm so pathetic!  Anyhoo, this one might just turn out to be cool.  I drew a map of a non-existant world and I came up with a bunch of names for the places and stuff.  I started writing around that. adios amigos...

      VACATION!  DOUBLE WHOOT!  For my presents I got a book on the making if Gollum, by Andy, and a gollum bookmark with "the ring" attached.  Took ring off and fasened it to necklace, yes presious.  This is your fault Nora and Laura, all your fault for encuraging me. ( note: I can't spell for shist....so yeah.  Oh, and shist is my new swear...its a type of rock ^^ )  I'm bored, and tired, and I can't draw anymore...that stupid map made my muse tired so he went to sleep.  A muse is a ...greek?Roman?oh well, its a goddess....but I think mine is a guy, so that doesn't really work.  I'm ranting, this is my random rant sight, yehaw!

      flowers and ponies and clouds and...and...blood!  nonono, I fail, I can't _not_ be morbid!  Oh, the director for My Fair Lady called and said that if I came back for a play with a younger cast she would let me in, oh well...most of the grownups there were really stuck up about their singing abilities.  So all is well.  I'm going to the movies tonight with mom, you know, mother daughter bonding time.  Isn't that sweet? ^^  Been on since 11:00 and have been on with Benedict since then...5 1/2 hours..WOW! o.O    To all my poor friend who had to suffer school; how was it?   BREW-HAHAHAHA::hackhackwheezdies:: x_x Adios my friends, see you all soon ( I'm not contagious ) Oh, yeah, I'll see some of you tomarrow at Carson's house, ne?

      You all know Jordan (well most of you anyway)  My little angsy charactor, you know, the one I talk about all the time?  Anyway, I must have been in a very inwardly morbid mood today because I was drawing while watching Pirates of the Carribean and when I looked down at my paper I had drawn a little kid Jordan trying to commit suicide!  What's with me?  I don't get it!   Mom today made a comment on my morbidness too!  Why me? ::sobs::  I mean, what has happened in my life that's made me so pain obsessed?  Ruby tries to tell me that I'm just violent, but....but...at least I take out most of it in my drawings and writing (and wheaton,but...sorry about that) I don't know, I think I've been possesed by Satan ::glares at satan::  Satan: WHAT?  If you hate me that much why do you keep inviting me over?    Whatever you devil.   Anyway, I still don't get it.  If anyone has an answer please tell me, it will be muchly appreciated.   I was thinking about starting anouther blog where I would just post my arguments with the people in my head, because if I posted them here you guys would never talk to me again.  Oh well, I'll just keep those to myself, I'll write them on my writing program.   ::looks at whole post:: WOW, that's just a whole lot of nothingness, sorry all.   -Hastur Infierno

      Well, I wouldn't really call my room a shrine, but it's close enouph for me.  I wish I could just isolate myself in my room, only coming out food and hygene matters.  It's not that I don't love all of you, it's just sometime's I'd just much rather be alone.  Who says I have to grow up and get a job?  I just want to be an artist and a writer...I can do that from here!  ::deep sigh:: enouph about how depressing I am...onto happier things. Like slash!   nonono, I don't want to make homophobes and other people like that uncomfortable, so I'll stop.   I just finish watching Jesus Christ Superstar, veeery nice.  looots of sla- oops...I said I wouldn't talk about that, sorry.   I think I'll go watch a movie and then I'll stare at a ring for an hour or two... ( my precious! )  I'm so hopeless....and I have no life....and if I do I think it's broken.  Not that it bothers me, I am quite content with the way my life is going at the moment ( besides from being sick )  Lots of love to everybody.   Te amo todo, charla a usted más adelante

      I'm having trouble thinking of good titles....think I'll start using Monty Python quotes of something.  I'm still sick, even more so now.  I didn't go to school today ( please don't lynch me )  and I feel like I've been run over by a truck....or worse.   Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can get better?  Can't someone just snap their fingers and ::POOF:: I'm all better?  WHY CAN'T WE JUST DO THAT??  I guess I could just tell myself I'm  not sick, then see if I feel better.  But then...I'd go around like the walking dead! I have no idea what I'm talking about, I'm delirious, and I just can't type.  Lo siento mis amigos, adios ( and for wheaton: Hasta Pronto...you wierdo!)

      I blame the home schoolers.   Sorry guys but it's true, you were the ones who were sick around me.  Oh well.  I had auditions for My Fair Lady last night and...well...they went alright...I guess.   It's really freaky, my head is spinning and there is this really weird feeling of fear in the air....I always get it when I'm sick but this is really freaking me out.  BIG TIME!  I'm trying to snap out of it, but it's hard....Mom wants me to take eca...echanatia...however you spell it, the ICKY stuff that tastes like....nothing I can describe, it's gross.  I simply must go now and practice my concertina and read fanfics.  Ciao.

      WAHAHAHAHA!  We got to school today and realized there was no heat in the school.  Everyone was walking around with their big winter jackets on.  Half way through A block they told us to go back to our homerooms....and then they told us we could go home! WOOT!  So we got on the bus and Nora ended up coming over to my house.  We spent all day watching gladiator and playing sims... it was fun.  She's still here actually...and we're still having fun...so I shouldn't have used past tense...oh well.  Nora has fallen in love with the picture of Sessen I drew...and she spent a long time crying over the fact that he couldn't be real.  It makes me feel happy ^^. I am going to auditions for My Fair Lady tonight at seven, lets just hope I get into the chorus....the paper said for grown-ups only...HA feck that, I'm going anyway.  I never realized how much great slash potential there is in Gladiator ( oh dear, Elea has done it...I'm totally corrupted)  Oh dear, I just broke my desk, I'm rambling, and Nora is making sounds like a dieing giraff ( nyaaaa,nyaaa,nyaa )  I better leave now, make sure no one gets hurt.

      I DREW FELIX TODAY!!!  HAHAHAHA ::does gollum laugh and dance of triumph::  I'm sorry, I've been gloating all afternoon, but I'm really happy.  I'm sure I'll look back at this in a year or two and think, UG! I can't believe I used to fraw like THAT!  Oh well, it'll do for now.  Contra dance tonight, I'm still discussing whether to go or not. Yeah yeah I know I should but I just kinda feel like staying home.  Oh, an' tomarrow night I'm going to see the 9 10s at 8.... lol, well actually at 7:15 but whatever.  Nora Luara and Carissa, I'll cheer extra loud for you chicas.  I have already seen most of laura's, but I have not seen the end...so all is good.  I have been in a really weird mood all day, and I demand sugar, so I'm eating a lolipop at the moment.  That will hold me off for a while.  Ayla.... I...want....to....lynch....her!!!!!  Oh well, who doesn't?  All the boys that's who, but that wasn't my point....ADIOS MIS AMIGAS!  o... y mi amigos... XP

      Carissa, this is for you, and the comment that you left on the previous post.  If you even try that you'll die, along with the nuns.  I would give them all a very gruesome death then eat them.... then I would be smout, smited, smouted, whatever...God get mad and ::KABOOM::  there, thats what I meant.   I'm surprised I haven't been already though, I mean, I was talking about some pretty ludicrous things in the UU.  I bet god isn't as much of a hard@rse as everyone thinks he is.  Personally I think God is a very lax and cool guy.   I mean, the BIBLE!  Don't even get me started on that!  I don't want to get all mad and diss someone's religion, thats just not nice.  You know what though, I bet god is gay.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, please no one kill me for that if your a homophobe (

      Am sitting around at my computer eating cookies and milk ( drinking the milk though )  When I got home from school I went online, drew a little (off the computer) and then decided I have anouther artist to worship.  I will always worship Elea, she is my goddess, my muse, and...just all around great.  But I found this girl on elfwood who is amazing! I love her style and I strive to be like both her and Elea.  Damn them for being so good.  Oh, exam scores: Science- 96 English-88 History-96 Math-86 and Spanish-93    I didn't fail spanish! YAY!  Sorry all, I don't mean to brag, but I'm just hyper and I'm giddy.  I was really worried about the exams, but I guess I test well ( I knew nothing on the History exam and got 65 wrong on the English!)  Mrs.Shortsleeve (english)  made the exam 500somthing questions, so 65 wasn't really all the much (GAH!)  The teachers gave us that talk about the test thingy coming up.  You know, the thing that judges whether our school gets shut down because the kids are stupid or not.  So WHEEE, we get to decide the fate of our school BREWHAHAHAHAHA  ::does gollum laugh of triumph:: (

      I just finished Tommy, it was....scary.  I still love it though, don't get me wrong, but some of the people in the movie just CAN'T sing!

      As most of you people from school know, I am very sick. Or rather, I FEEL rather sick.  I'm sorry to have whined about it in school, but I was in pain.  When I got home ( at 3:15... stupid bus didn't show up so had to wait something like an hour and a half for dad to get me... then we went into town... ARRG! ONe plus is that we got Tommy out from the library, so tonight I am going to be enjoying the best rock opera in existance, and also watching the Flying Circus!  ( It's..... XP )  So maybe getting sick wasn't so bad.  The only bad thing is that I took a nap, and woke up at five.  I had part of my sick dream  ( the dream I always have when I'm dizzy ) and it was about the world being distroyed.  I am really shaken up right now, I need someone to talk to to get my mind off this subject.  Benedict, why do we keep missing eachother online?  We have a five day weekend ( starting today..tomarrow..whatever. We go back on Wensday)  so hopefully we can talk sometime in that little window of freeness.  I have something I really need to tell you ( nothing bad, no worries).  Had no breakfast, had no lunch, not hungry.  I'm crazy, but we already knew that.  Once again I'm rambling, but only to occupy my time, so I don't think of that auful dream.  ::Needs someone to hug, preferably B but I don't think that's going to happen anytime really soon::

      I just sat down and began typing, this is what happened. I have no title as of yet and if you have any suggestions please post them. ((Please excuse the spelling, I am a horrid speller and my computer is without spell check! Oh, and I also have a fixation with commas...so please excuse the horrible sentance structure))                 Lightning flashed across the sky, illuminating the dark clouds in a red flash.  The young gaurd at his post sighed and leaned against the large stone wall he was patrolling.  The rain had not yet reached the city, but if one looked hard enouph they would see the rain drenching the vally far below them.  Anouther flash lit up the night, the man sighed again.  He wanted nothing more than to be in bed with his lover, nestled into her warm embrace, asleep.  But that wouldn’t be happening, not that night, nor any other.  He turned his back to the lightning, searching randomly for something on the other side of the wall.  A slight twinging noise made its entrance into the night, but he didn’t notice, for at that moment there was a roll of thunder.  He fell like a stone, an arrow pertruding from his back.  His last thoughts were of his wife, and would he ever see her again?   	      More arrows flew over the wall, finding their targets in the other watchmen on the wall.  One man, however, managed to crawl to the bell that rested at the top of a tower.  He gave it one mighty tug and fell, his strength leaving him.  Small, wooden ladders poked up over the wall and people streamed up them.  A company of about fifty, if anyone had been there to count.  They were dressed in dark leathers, blending into the night like shadows.  As the bell tolled the moved faster, racing down the other side of the wall, weapons in hand.   	       The men in the barracks, the ones that were awake at least, lept up and ran out into the darkness to see to the trouble.  The first few fell, covered in their own blood, from the swift shadows bearing knives. The men who came after were ready. The black men pounced on them, but found themselves matched in talent and bronze.  While the skirmish broke out a few of the kings men ran up to the hall, screaming their warning into the sleeping households.  More gaurds ran from their houses, soon it was a small battle of about seventy-five against fifty.  The men in black were obviously not going to win, and they knew it, but they fought on anyway.   They became more feirce with each man they killed, losing hardly none of their own.  The fight went on, on and on until the first rays of light began peaking over the mountain tops.  The light looked out over the small battlefield, there were only twenty-five of the king’s men left, and the only remaining men in black were laying in the mud with diffrent degrees of injury.   	 ((This is it so far....  this is what I get when I bored, horrid writing!  well...we'll see if I ever finish this story XP, I doubt it!))

      Mr.See is making us know about 72 vocab words for the exam, he gave us a sheet that had all the words and then told us that if we wanted to put them on the cheat sheet, we couln't use the paper he gave us.  I had already written most of the definitions on his sheet, and I had to transfer the whole thing onto computer paper.  I wrote as small as I could and still be able to see it, and now my hand really hurts...ARRG!  Senora Martin won't let us use a sheet or a card for the exams... and I think I will fail, but Ruby tries to tell me otherwise.  I am NOT the smartest person in spanish class, but for some reason everyone thinks I am.  Thats what I get for going to Mexico for a month.  Ms. Martin said that I am the "mother hen" of the class and I felt like biting her head off and then roasting her and feeding her to Laura... but I didn't ( sorry Laura ).  I wish it was 4 but nooooo, its only 11:20, that means I have to study for 4 1/2 more hours!  AAAAAAAH!  I would be depressed right now, but Tommy is keeping my spirits high. If anyone has not heard or seen The Who's Tommy then you are missing out on something HUGE!  It is one of the best musicals ( operas) in the world!   Should probably get back to work now, see you all tonight.  Hasta Luego.

      Ugh, why do we have to have them anyway? Ok,ok, I know why, I just like complaining.  I'm sitting here at my computer, drinking frozen ginger ale, it's kind of like drinking a margarita...except less salty...and alcoholic....whatever.  I'm trying to get out of studying today, just tomarrow until 4:00 ( YAY ) and after skiing.  I might be getting lessons from Bob at the pub afterwards, but not this week, I still have to call him.  Today was depressing...cold and depressing, but espesially cold.  We ran out of our last class and bolted for the door before the bell had even rang  ( stupid announcements) and we ran for the busses...then realized no one else was, so we ran back inside.  Then they made us wait in our class room until all the busses came, we didn't leave school until 2:35.  So therefore I didn't get home until 3:22!  It was really annoying.  So I'm home alone and I'm very bored... Benedict I miss you!   I'm going to go and drown my sorrows in anouther frozen soda.  Adios chicos.

Ms. Harlow looked ready to kill ( either us or Mr. Erwin )  When we finished Mr Erwin ( or Mr. Bear...whatever you want to call him )  clapped...reeeeally slowly, Ms. Harlow didn't clap at all.   In the car ride there we all decided that she looks like Ursula from the little mermaid (   the conversation ended in us singing songs from the movie >.      &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;     urlLink Marriage is love.       go gay marriage!

      Valentines Day...what a ridiculas concept!   I mean, I'm all for having an excuse to love people, but..come on! A quick quiz: St. Valentine was:   a)  a priest in the Roman Empire who helped persecuted Christians during the reign of Claudius II, was thrown in jail and later beheaded on Feb. 14.  b)  a Catholic bishop of Terni who was beheaded, also during the reign of Claudius II.  c)  someone who secretly married couples when marriage was forbidden, or suffered in Africa, or wrote letters to his jailer's daughter, and was probably beheaded.  d)  all, some, or possibly none of the above.    It's all so wierd....that's all I had to say.  bye.

      So sorry for not posting for a while, I't just that after I got back to school the teachers loaded me with all the stuff I'd missed.  We had Stage 20 today and it rocked, except for two boys who are just little !#@#% anyway ^^   I'm in a really good mood despite my headache!   In Stage 20 we had to pretend we were walking through a graveyard at night...and I was wearing my vampire coat today!  When Mr.Bruno wasn't looking I kept looking at Nora and skipping, it was really great.  I have homework to do...and we have rock climbing  tonight...so not much time.  I'll write more later.

      Sorry for not updating everyone!  I just didn't want to bother ::shrugs::   Today I'm home from school on account of the horrid pain in my neck.  I had a little ski accident on Sunday, and now I feel like crap.  So now I'm just sitting here, bored out of my skull.   I know there's probably _something_ I should be doing now but...heh...oh well.   Will try to update more often and get back to my normal wittyness ::coughcough:: yeah right.

      WE HAVE A THREE DAY WEEKEND!  ::laughs at the rest of the kids at school::   Only our grade too! Weeeee!   Um...but now I have to go to camp T.T   For the whole time...working....and not getting paid....fun.....   Ah well, Nora lent me her MP3 for the weekend, and if I can copy Ayumi Hamasaki off of it I can keep it!  GacktGacktGackt!  It was made by Julia...or at least Julia gave it too her, so that means it MUST be good.....::forgets that no one who reads this except Nora knows who Julia is::   So I'll have shat loads of music and homework to do!  GREA- no...wait....homework isn't a good thing.  Damn my teachers, damn being sick, damn all of it.  I say  "damn ____" way to often....I should be carefull, hell might fill up too fast !   So I won't be online this weekend...I guess that's the only reason I posted here.  I won't be online next weekend either, camp again.  BUT THIS TIME WITH BENEDICT AND ELEA!!!!  YAY WOOT HUZZAH!   Benedict, so sorry about the cast....but I think the main activities we were planning on were DnD, and DVDs anyway....   If we get bored we can always hop on a ferry and go to Burlington....actually, if you two are up to it I'd love to take you guys there!  It would be fun.   ::huggles::   I hope the confermation goes well, don't trip while crutching >.

      GOD DAMMIT!!!!   I hate being sick!  My throat feels like sandpaper made of glass and my nose is running like a faucet!   Every time I swallow or speak my throat screams....it hurts....::sob::  I think bus rides home always (well....sometimes anyway) makes things better.  Mitch White sat near us (if you don't know who Mitch is...just picture scrawnly little boy who is as annoying as hell.)  And, as always, we confused him XD   I was talking about Benedict ( XD ) with Ruby and Mitch came into the conversation and asked if I was talking about Benedict Arnold....I told him that, no, I was not in love with a dead guy.   He didn't really  hear me though and went on talking about it might be hard to have a relationship with someone who is dead.  I told him that the fact the Arnold was dead didn't keep us apart for I am a necrophiliac....he couldn't pronounce it and Ruby and I had a good laugh over him trying to figure out what it meant.   He then asked if it meant homosexual and started calling me a lesbian.  He said he would tell everyone I was a necrmaliaca (that is how he tried to say it) so I told him to tell everyone I was a hetrosexual.  He got all excited and began pointing at people and calling them hetrosexuals....The bus driver joined in with the laughter that time.   I like beating people mentally, it makes me feel better.  The sad thing is that no matter what I do to Mitch he will always bounce back and prevoke me again!   ::sigh:: stupid little boy, doesn't he realize how stupid he is?   Well, there really is no moral to this post...simply that ranting is fun and makes you feel better.    I love you Benedict!   Oh, don't worry, I love the rest of you to ^^  ::hugs::

      Ahhhh, yes.  The play is finally over.   Today I had Lemmings, but Malissa wasn't there so we didn't do much.  Afterwards we sang Paul Simon songs and Rob complained about his massive hangover >. Benedict, you saw Troy? ACK!  I'm so jealous!  You'll have to tell me all  about it ^^  I'm not going to ask why you had pink clips in your hair, it's just one of those thing I smile and nod and it makes me remember why I love you swo much ^^   I miss you tons (I mis you the most XP)   ::huggles:: night night everyone.

      Oh dear. ohdearohdearohdearohdear.  Well, we have our first showing of the play tonight ^^;;  Unfortunatly Nick, one of our important charactors, didn't come to school today.  He was home all day hurling into his toilet.  Just great, neh?  Jacob is trying to memorize all of Nick's lines before 7:30....but I'm still worried.   I hope Nick feel's well enough to come and do it...who care's how sick he looks?  He'll be all white anyway!  Besides, with all the lipstick prople will NOT be looking at the rest of him.  They'll all be trying to figure out if he's a guy or not >.

      Not much to say, except that I hate makeup.  I have to have me whole face white with tiny little exagerated lips to mimick a Japanese mask for the first of our two plays.  The second I need lipstick and eyeliner (of course, for plays everyone must have exagerated features), but as the play goes on - and I die -  then I have to powder my face, hands, and hair and paint my hands to looks like bones....all in the span of a few minutes.  fun fun fun....  Then Mr.Bruno has all these ideas that, in theory, work, but when put into practice are simply stupid.   Ack, crazy old man XP   On an upnote:  Kimonos are fun, and so is funky hair, and CHOPSTICKS!    During english today Nate and I had an argument about sushi.  He claimed that only raw fish covered in rice and nori was considered sushi.  I told him that there are many types of sushi that don't have seafood in them, like cucumber, avacado, carrot, so on and so forth.  Now, am I right, or is he?  Is there a difference between nori rolls and sushi?  ACK!  Please, if you know the true answer post it here!  That's all for right now.  Ta, hasta la byebye

      Sorry all of you for not updating. I actually don't think anyone is checking up on this anymore (so why am I writing? that is the question.)   Wow...blogger got a new makeover...when did this happen?  ::shrugs:: ahh well.    So, incase people are still reading this, today was an ultatmate disaster.   In school I had a headache...and then I learned I had failed the math test...and for some reason my nerves couldn't take it and I started crying.  After math I went to the bathroom and took a few minutes of spanish class to cry my eyes out.   After that my headache just got worse.  Now, I don't understand why I was crying, I really don't get worked up over my grades, but....I don't know....it just hurt.   I understood the test too, which makes it worse.   I suggest we eat Mr. Barker....but that might not make things better.  On the bus ride home Ruby, Ryan, and Dallas helped cheer me up while we talked about slash.   Dallas is a major homophobe....and Ruby and I always try to convince him that the only reason for his hate is because he is in love with men.  I like seeing his ears turn red.  That made me feel much better, but I still had (and it's still here!) a headache.   I just have to keep counting down the days until Benedict and Elea come up and we go to camp.  That will be really great....and it will cure all my stupid mental ailments (well, maybe not ALL...I don't think the insanity will go away. )  ::sigh:: wow, writing all this make me feel better, maybe I should start a diary or something.... I love you all and I thank you for trying to make me feel better.      Oh, this has also made me feel better.   Thank you Benedict :D    ::hugs::  I love you.

It was fun, and I got a lot of compliments....not to mention a lot of weird looks.  I also recieved a few glomps from my ecstatic friends.

      Wow, it's nice to learn I am so loved!   Alright, so after all the pleeding I finally have decided to ubdate my blog XD    Much stuff has happened since my last post, but most of you know all about it, so I won't go into details.   Recently Benedict sent me Mono....So beware all of you....for I shall bring it to school and you all shall perish!!!  MAUAUAUA ( mine is an evil laugh ;) )   Benedict and Elea are coming up at the end of May!!  YAY! ::gollum laugh of triumph::  If all works out, they will pick me up from school on Friday, then probably the next day (but it might be that afternoon) we will head off for camp.  Funny, they are coming to Vermont by train just to be driven to New York...ah well, that's two hours in a car laughing and  creating new inside jokes.  Then we will fill our time with much DnD playing, movie watching, and other things that are a little more ccamp related.   There will be a wedding going on...so we can sneek in and steal all the yummy food.  (heyheyhey!  This time I can actually go in screaming "I'm with the Bride"  ::falls into crazy fits of laughter)   I'm playing with the idea of bringing Ebo...I don't want to leave him here, he'd get lonely!   But then again, if he got loose then there would be hell to pay...oh well, I have a while to think about it.   Alright...that's all from right now.  Love you all and I promise to start posting regularly.  Ta

      For instance....Omelets.  When one talks to me about a omelet, I think of Hamlet, soooo two different images come to mind.  One is an ham omelet.  The second is Ben Alshire wrapped up in egg screaming.  The Ben one comes more often than not.  But the point is......the point is that instead of killing whales for their blubber, we should instead give them liposuction.  Therefore we have our blubber, and the whales are nice and trim.  Though the whale aerobic instructors might be a little miffed.  But they can suck it up and get another job like.....I don't know....plumbing??  Well that's all, good bye all my little grape vines in humus.  Nora a.k.a- the whaling liposuction surgeon naturalist.

      Wellllllllllllll.........tis a loverly day, but I wouldnt know cuz I dont have a lover but thats allllll besides the point. The point is.......the point is the dolphins dont like sea water, but they only like to live there because they like the free salt for their margaritas.  That the only reason they act so stupid and allow us to screw with their minds.  But thats not the point either........what the hell are you looking at me like that????  Does it look like I know the point.  For someone who thinks dolphins are alcoholics you sure have a lot of faith in me.  Gezzz.........*walks off muttering...then 800 lb wreaking ball swings down and kills her.  Aplause fallows.*   (the following is from Logan since she isn't on her own computer.)

      So tommarow is Valentine's day at MRU. Aka "massive PDA / mad sex-ified hormone filled teenagers day"  For those of you lucky lucky children who have never had to experiance this attrocity, let me explain.  The torture starts in the morning. You walk into the building, and trip over middleschoolers sucking face in the lobby. you ram into them everywhere you go. finnily, after you manage to fight your way past all the sex crazed mutants, you get to TA (aka, homeroom). Here, you are presented with carnations, sold by the NHS. If you have a boy friend, or a just a friend, who cares about such things, you get massive ammounts of these icky smelling things. If you have no friends, you get one from the NHS that says "Happy Valentine's day, from a friend." This is supposed to make you feel better about not having anyone who's willing to spend a dollar on you. however, it acctually makes you feel like crap. 'cause if you carry around a carnation "from a friend", then everyone knows that you have no friends. whereas, if you don't carry any carnations around at all, it just looks like you got lots and stuck them in your locker. This whole thing was much more of a problem in middleschool, when i actually cared about what everyone thought...But according to Hannah, who has had the very unfortunate experiance of having freeky mutant guys, who she dosn't know, send her tons of carnations, teddybears, roses, and chocolates, getting a carnation "from a friend" is acctually not the worst thing that can happen to you.  So after TA, which you spend inching away from the couples making out in the corners, or, for that matter, in the center of the room, you fight your way to your first class. This is made very difficult by the fact that the sex crazedcouples have multiplyed, and their actions have progressed to acctual R-rated groping. They do this in the center of the hall, and in the center of the stairwell. Why, i don't know. It's some sort of odd physical phenomion - the center off the hall way is apparently better for making-out than the sides of the hallway. so after smashing through the hormone landmine zone, and arriving at your first class, you are greeted with some strangely over enthusiastic teacher who gives everyone little sugary heart candys that say "hot stuff" and "love 4ever" on them. They taste like toothpaste.  It goes on like this all day. The hormones rage higher on a flood of sugar and SEX, and when you fight your way to the bathroom, you find 10 girls in there, sobbing thier eyes out. Apparently their offerings of love, or shall we say, infatuation, have been shunned. Or the man of their dreams has been spotted chewing on someone elses tounge. (sorry for the god awful discriptions, but this is really what they do.).  At lunch, you are surrounded by couples sitting in eachothers laps, and yet more tounge chewing and sobbing girls. It's enough to make you loose your appitite. Plus, you notice that all the ugly middle school girls seem to have boyfriends, and you don't. Not that you really want to add to the mess, but it's slightly depressing anyway.  By the end of the day, the PDA is really x-rated. and the wailing girls have given up on the line for the bathroom, and are instead crying it all out infront of their lockers, while a group of their friends try to console them by saying bad things about "that jerk."   and the janators are left to clean up piles of smushed candy hearts and rotten flowers.   ~Rosilita, the bitter and sarcastic, but otherwise content

      This is horrible.  there are those stupid ads on kings of chaos, and one that comes up alot  is this thing about breast cancer, saying that so many thousand women will get it in the next year and 40,000 will die.  And i know that my mom was one of those women who got it, and she was lucky to get rid of it. and my aunt nancy will be one of those women who dies, and there's nothing anyone can do about it.  And then they have another ad that says, "are you over 21 and do you smoke? win a TV!"  What is wrong with the world?  ok, i have to stop writing about this now because it's really depressing and if i don't stop i'm gonna start crying. ~laura aka the cannibal

      Has anyone noticed how anvil and advil are spelled similar and sound similar?  So like if you go to a drug store and ask for advil and they throw an anvil at you then....since you would probably be dead...would that count as a pain reliever?

      Wheaton Squier: it's an art Meghan Faulkner: ok, whatever you say, but anyone can procrastinate, on;y the truly talented can get it done early Wheaton Squier: .....yeah Wheaton Squier: but it can still be considered am art Meghan Faulkner: HOW??? Wheaton Squier: anyone can spatter pain on a canvas and call it art 9:40 PM Wheaton Squier: hang on Wheaton Squier: fine then Meghan Faulkner: how is it art Wheaton Squier: how is it not? Meghan Faulkner: it does not involve creating anything new, it is an act, there is no final product Wheaton Squier: ah Wheaton Squier: there is nothing Wheaton Squier: and that is what you are trying to get Meghan Faulkner: yes Wheaton Squier: nothing is the product Meghan Faulkner: but then it is not an art form, because a product is something not nothing Meghan Faulkner: right? Wheaton Squier: no Meghan Faulkner: i think? Wheaton Squier: anything can be art Meghan Faulkner: but it has to be something not nothing Wheaton Squier: why? 9:45 PM Meghan Faulkner: because you just said anything can be art, but to be anything it has to be something nothing Wheaton Squier: nothing is something Meghan Faulkner: no nothing is nothing Wheaton Squier: okay Wheaton Squier: we will say that nothing is nothing Wheaton Squier: nothing can still be art Meghan Faulkner: thank you Wheaton Squier: if you had a blank canvas, what is it? Meghan Faulkner: if that is what you want to be believe, so be it Wheaton Squier: is it something? Meghan Faulkner: the beginnings of art Wheaton Squier: not the canvas Wheaton Squier: okay Wheaton Squier: so we have the beginning of art Wheaton Squier: is that something? Meghan Faulkner: yes but not art Wheaton Squier: so if i said "that's art" what would you say? 9:50 PM Meghan Faulkner: no, because it was not made by human hands, did you grow the flax or whatever and weave it, and all of that fun stuff Wheaton Squier: so it's not you're saying? Meghan Faulkner: yes, i'm saying that it is not Wheaton Squier: okay Wheaton Squier: but you have me the "artist" who is saying that in-fact that IS art and who are you to say it's not? Meghan Faulkner: if you created it, maybe it is art, but if you go buy a canvas, display it, and whatever, it is not art!!!!! Wheaton Squier: so i can't proclaim the blank canvas art 9:55 PM Meghan Faulkner: not unless you created it Wheaton Squier: is a parakeet paints something is it art? Meghan Faulkner: yes, it created it Meghan Faulkner: i think Wheaton Squier: okay, so if i covered my canvas with paint and then scraped it all off Wheaton Squier: is that art Meghan Faulkner: no, it was, but you destroyed it Wheaton Squier: no Meghan Faulkner: if there were holes or scrape marks, it might be Wheaton Squier: i say that if that's what i was trying to do then it's art Meghan Faulkner: if you purposefully created them Meghan Faulkner: yes Wheaton Squier: so if i purposely left it blank... Meghan Faulkner: NO!!!!!!!!!!!! Wheaton Squier: WHY NOT???? Wheaton Squier: i can say it is Wheaton Squier: that's what i want to portray Wheaton Squier: i blank canvas Meghan Faulkner: yes, but maybe i don't agree with you 10:00 PM Wheaton Squier: oh yes i know that Wheaton Squier: so if you see it in a museum next to other things what would you call ot Meghan Faulkner: i would silently wonder what the heck it is there for Wheaton Squier: heh heh heh Meghan Faulkner: but, if you become a famous artist, with blank canvases, yeah, right, i'd support you Wheaton Squier: wow Wheaton Squier: we need to argue in person sometime  -wheaton AKA the blank one.....

      I have tea and chocoalte cake.   the world is a wonderful place...  on the way to CT on saturday, i saw a billboard (*gasp* horrible ugly things!) with a picture of the originial really big green monster thing that nate pasted wheaton's face on.  (note rosie's total lack of pop-culture...i'm guessing it was a movie monster?).  anyway, i saw that and i went "HA!"  good story rosie, good story... in other news,  today laura and i talked to logan about bunnies.  and slash.  and such. it was ammusing.  laura was shock-ed.  i was not.   and that was that.  i'm sorry, i'm really trying here, but you know, nothing of any importance and/or intrest is jumping to mind (why do we say jumping?  why not "swiming to mind?"  walking?  strolling?  tiptoeing?)  ah well, some one else should try this updating thing sometime...

The play was really fun, yay for all involved. 5. I'm in love with my blog. 6. I get my hair cut tomorrow, which means... 7. I GET A NEW SPLIT PERSONALITY!!!! YAAAAY! NEW BLOOD! NEW VOICE!!!  huh...i'm a bit hyper. what else is new? So these next few weeks looked packed, *rolls eyes* crazy world.  So I was thinking, are psychics allowed to play the lottery or bet on horses?

      So I hava a question for youse-all...do you think people can share dreams? like, if you dream about someone, are they sharing that dream with you? So, if you had a dream that you and.....uh, huh...ok, Betty Crocker...(hahahaha! How great! so random!) were baking brownies together, would Betty Crocker be sleeping in her bed, dreming about baking brownies with some freak, AKA: you?  Just a though I had. I'd like some feed-back. Thanx.

      Now that I have all of your attentions...  ...I haven't posted here in a long time. In fact, I think the only one who's posted here in awhile is Susannah. *genuflects to Susannah* *KOTOW!!!*  Ah, so...school's out! Wheeeeeee! Summer is here!!! Wheeeeee! I have nothing to do...Wheeee-boring. People need to call or IM me and make times so I have something to do with people other then stay up till 2 and sleep till noon...it gets very boring very quickly. Not to mention tiring.   My typing's go to hell today...pay no mind to any blantant typos.  The baot's in the water...it was so gorgeous at the lake today. We didn't have time to sail, but the water was all choppy and the wind was blowing hard across the lake, and it was cold, so I sat on the dock's end and got splashed on by waves and watched the golden sunset...days like today are great. It was so awesome to see Crown Point ruins bathed in gold light...and seagulls...and water...and dammit...I wanted my camera. Byut it was at home... :(  I'm gonna leave now...but I'll be on for awhile.   T.Y.L- (Ta You Lot) Carissa, the overly-eccentric.

      Ok so here is a question, I appreciate all replies.  Have you ever been in love, and how many times? Was the other person i love with you too, and which times? What is being in love? Do you think a person can be in love more than once, or is there one special someone for everyone?  Elaborate, I just wander what your guys opinions on this are.  Thanks! Oh and did you want my answers, if anyone does, say so I'll post mine too.

      Yeah, that'd be gravity.  Anyway, that has nothing to do with this post.  So hi to everyone, and Susannah especially, welcome!  Getting ready for exams, life sucks, in other words, however, I GET MY PERMIT IN 3 DAYS!!!! WHOOT WHOOT!!! And I drove a lot today...(illegally, but hey, little details...) and it went well, so i'm a happy camper. Well, I'm not a camper, unless my life is a camp, which sometimes I think it is. Boot Camp. How much can you handle at once, like hopping on one foot reciting the alphabet backwards at the same time while writing an English report, learning new French verb tenses for the exam, and saving a small third world country?  But anyway, that's not why I'm posting here either. I'm going to drive you crazy yet...  I'm posting to say that I'm sick to death of everything that goes on after one wins the UVM writing contest. Today, i was pulled out of lunch and the first ten minutes of ocial Studies to do an over-the-phone interview with a guy from the Rutland Herald. it took, I am not kidding you, half an hour. He wanted to know EVERYTHING!!! What the prompts were, what I wrote, what my hobbies were, what I wanted to major in college in, if I had anything I was writing on the side, if I was publishing it, what i had to eat for lunch exactly five months ago, and what my views on Capital Punishment are. (Haha.) Well, it was close to that, you can imagine. :P  I am so ready for this to be over. O-V-E-R! Realizing I don't LIKE to be noticed. That 'invisable girl' syndrome. It dies hard.  I smell like linament from the stable. Kinda weird. I went to blow my nose, and I was permeated by the smell of mint, and it made my nose tingle really weirdly. Ugh.   I think I'll be on all night. I have an English paper to write, (anyone know of a really important day in my life, cause I can't think of one...) and a French compostion. To do in three different verb tenses. Ah, for the days of only the present tense...i think i need to find an on-line translator...make my life easy. Hahaha...  As always, Mischief AKA: Carissa

      I am so lonely, there is no one to entertain me, Jessie is at home, Jessica leaves for tennessee, Justin is in Florida, Jon is at home, and Nathan should be in Vermont by now. Well if I can entertain myself for another hour and a half I can go ahead to work. You guys better take good care of Nathan up there! Or I'll have to float up in my invisible car that runs on love, right Nathan! Anyway I everyone is having a good summer so far, and that you guys aren't as bored as I am.

(Don't you always feel stupid talking about yourself) Anyway, I am out of highschool and currently work as a waitress at an adorable pizzaria.

I like theatre, and have been dong it for 15 years, I am a middle child and I know the muffin man.....sorry I had to add that. I'm a little starnge, and "special" but aren't we all. Anything else you want to know go ahead and ask.  -Susannah

      Lately ive been thinking theoretically and philisophicaly alot about dating and relationships and other things.  I think some people want a perfect boyfriend/girlfriend and since that doesnt happen much the person tends to make someone they find they like a little perfect to them.  So my question is would you, personally, make a person change their ways, habits, looks, whatever to your version perfect person?   The answer to my own question is no.  I will accept the person for who they are, thats why i fell in love with them anyway isnt it? Personally im willing to accept a persons bad habits. No matter how bad they might be.  No one is perfect, and as  urlLink Susannah  said, "being perfect would be an imperfection." I'm assuming this posts comments will be more than alot of others, and people? dont argue in the comments please? Thanks  I can already smell vermont everyone.  -Nate A.K.A the mish mash balley smash tik-in-tash car crash

      Here's a quote from earlier today:    Mischief1689: It's like, destiny on crack.   Ever get that feeling, like fate's been smoking the wacky tabacky? I've been getting that feeling a lot lately. It either go stupidly well, or horribly wrong. It was wrong, now it's getting good. So, as I have stated, destiny either needs to lay off the coke, or become an addict. Not inbetween. Inbetween makes me all confuzzled.   I think I'm going on a posting craze today. This is my forth post today. Isn't that sad?  Nora, if you're visiting from over where the say  miff  and  tiff  , here's this for you: Wasn't it,: Give Me Back My Handbag, Bitch?  Har har har...

      I think we've all generally come to the conclusion that being a teenager just...well...it SUCKS.   thankfully, the entire population of the world, over the age of 13, shares this knowledge.  and the entire population of the world over the age of 20 has survived being a teenager.  all the nasty embarrassing moments, all the horrible heart breaks, all the weird and unflattering styles and fads that we choose to or choose not to participate in, all the crazy mood swings - they all survived it.  They've even learned to laugh about it.  Seeing all these adults who survived teenager-hood makes me realize that, as unlikely as it seems, it really does get better.  so hang in there children, we've got lots to look forward to! *wheee*

      It is the most beautiful and wonderful thing, but there is a dark side, a side we do not see. The side of when the love is gone, the absence of it and the fear you have that one day you will have to endure that absence. I fear I will not be strong enough. I sit and realize that 18 hrs away is driving me mad as I sit here alone watching tv, playing games, reading, making jewelry, eating, pacing, anything to keep me busy. It is funny that in me a know that I don't NEED Nathan to the point that it is a bad thing but I also know the luxury of seeing the world in color, instead of black and white and now when I go back to the mediocre past in which I once inhibited I am falling apart. I sit alone here, I can't turn to Jessica who is in Connecticut with Justin, I cannot turn to my parents who are in Arizona or my sister who is with them, not even my other sister who is with her love in Ohio. The world is suddenly empty and my house so large and spacious. Of course the dogs keep me company but it isn't the same. I guess I should go out to stay busy and go shopping or go just join the world but the world is a scary place and instead I sit hear in hopes that the phone will ring and Nathan will be on the other line telling me he thinks of me. I know he thinks of me all the time but I never tire of hearing about it. I should be being productive and cleaning or sorting or something but instead I sit in constant despair until my other half has returned. I need to sign up for some art classes or make more friends to fill but time. It is funny I am so alone now and bored but in just 2 days my family will return and I will be full of not a lonely but a chaotic pain. I will suffer the intolerable cruelty of listening to my family quarrel and my sister will be sad at some point and though I try to console her as does my mother then there is my father who just breaks down sometimes and gets so frustrated that I am reminded of crying in my room when I was 6 years as I heard my mother cry and I wished I could do something. Nathan is my prince charming and has come to save me, but this isn't a fairy tale and though I can pray that the ending will be happy I will still have this pain. Then there is my mother who has no one to turn to. She was so stressed this May her blood pressure got to 210 over something and I had to take her to the hospital. I worry, she watched her father die from a heart attack her there, and I don't want to see her suffer, she needs a shoulder to cry on, but so do I. No wander I go to therapy once a week, but anyone who goes knows that it never seems to be at the time you need it, for some reason the moments that you encounter your physciatrist/phsycologist is one of the moments in the week that you are ok. And so now I cry as I set down the phone, I hoped it was Nate but instead it's the Democratic part calling for donations. Can someone tell me why life is the way it is, I wish everyone could just give and be kind but instead we have hate and pain and sorrow, and it eats me up inside. But yet I hate to sit here and cry because then I am hurting the one person who brightens every moment without effort and I hurt my Nathan, for when I cry he feels my pain and then that hurts him and it hurts me more, but I hold back my tears and smile to know that he is happy so s once again am I. For if I dwell in sorrow I bring him it would only bring him more sorrow and thus continue this painful circle. I will see him in 2 hours most likely but it is never enough, I feel so greedy, and needy but I guess that is who I am, I just hope it is good enough, not for the world but for Nathan. It is hard, no matter how much I heal and continue I hold these scars in my soul and will carry them, because in reality dropping all of my baggage and sorrow would mean starting again and that is even scarier, because even though it may be less painful somehow this painful world is comforting because it is what I have always known. Yet I love it when it is gone when I am in Nathans arms and there are no troubles, the weight is gone, and for those moments I am truly happy, I guess I am just terrified of the thought that this feeling that I realize is more than any other I have ever felt could one day end and that is terrifying. It is scary to admit it but when I look back on everyone I have ever been with thought I loved or even perhaps did love, it was nothing like this, not even if I took what I had to them and put it to the 100th power would it compare to this to the way it feels when my lips touch Nathan and I feel him quiver in my arms and I know for that moment why we are here, why the world is so hard, because in fact this love is here. So if by chance it is all gone when I woke up tomorrow, this month and a half with Nathan in my life would have made years of suffering worthwhile but I don't want to go back ever, not now that I am here. Why would someone leave heaven to endure hell, thats the way it feels, I would never give this up, I would sooner throw all my possesions out the window and run away from it all then give up this feeling give up this love this passion that has taken me over. I sit here and type, I tell myself to stop but I can't express it not in a million words. I want to come one and just say what I've been up to but am overwhelmed with this feeling to share with the world the hope that exists that is there. So for those of you who have endured and read my long and senseless ranting take with you these words of advice, whatever pain you have undergone and continue to undergo there is hope there is love, when there is war and hate and murder there is love and hope so never give up, dream and enjoy every second because on one day you will look back and those little moments like singing along in the car and feeling awkward because you know your voice cracks and the person next to you can't take it, remember those moments are the moments we live for, those are the true moments that we truly LIVE.

      We need a waltz on here...I mean, c'mon, everyone needs to dance. And I'm in an incredibly silly mood.  blame the Monty Python overdose last night...but anyway. I also find it funny that the (only) one who DOESN'T know how to waltz is posting a *ahum* waltz. But yes,...sillyness.  [begins dancing...oops, no music yet...oh well...CARRY ON!!!]  POST POST POST, POSTPOST. (and uh, one, and uh, two, and a three...) POST POST POST, POSTPOST. (one...two...three...four...) POSTPOSTPOSTPOST...POST. (oh, you get the hint by now!)  POST POST POST, POSTPOST. POST POST POST, POSTPOST. POSTPOSTPOSTPOST...POST.  PO-PO-PO-PO-PO-PO-PO-PO-POST!!! (exhuberent dancing ensues.)  Ok...maybe I don't waltz. Maybe I just leap around. But hey, someone only tried to teach me once. And when it's Nord...more just a matter of making sure you don't get stepped on/step on her.   Ahum...NORA COMES HOME FROM LONDON TODAY!!!! YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!!!!  So now...go out and dance in front of people until they stare at you. It's fun!!!  Ta, Mischiefness!!!!
