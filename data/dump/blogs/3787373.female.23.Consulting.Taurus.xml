      What do you do when you're bored at work, Megamall is only a couple of blocks away from your office, and your boss scoots off after lunch? Why, be the first in line to see  urlLink the new Spider-Man movie  of course!  So I saw  Spider-Man 2  during my lunch break (which took almost four hours). To borrow the term we used in high school for sneaking out, nag-ninja ako. (I don't know what I love more about the term, the way it uses 'ninja' as a verb, or just because I think the word 'ninja' is inherently funny. Ninja! Ninja! Ninja!)  I thought I was off scot-free when, on the way back, the torrents came down and drenched me all over. Back at the office, everyone probably just assumed that I was stuck in the rains which was why it took me so long to get back. Still doesn't explain the presence of my new Spidey tumbler.

      And I didn't expect it to happen this soon. Only four days after  urlLink Mr. Web Presence himself  announced the presence of Pisay98 blog, 15 members are now part of the blog and there are now six posts. Yes, six post; I know it's small, and maybe the rate of posting is dwarfed by  urlLink nikki's . But the invasion is happening at the back of Pisay98's main blog. Our batchmates are slowly being pulled to the dark side of the blog world. (cue background music:  The Empire  music). Tseri just started her  urlLink sakura mind speaks  (whoops), and Jem may have found another  urlLink place  to put his legendary  WTF List.  Got a blog, and you want to add it to our blog roll? Just email  urlLink me  or  urlLink jaemark . Your blog is on our blog roll, and you want it taken out? do the same!

      I have a big problem with the Php5.50 jeepney fare.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for the jeepney fare increase. I think it's only fair. I had always thought that by not increasing the fare earlier, we're not getting as much out of it as much as what is being lost by the jeepney drivers. And I always had a problem with oil deregulation; you could find a bunch of arguments about the topic, but to me it's a matter of the government letting jeepney drivers shoulder losses that oil companies are not willing to take.  But all of that's beside the point. Here's my beef with the jeepney fare being Php5.50:  IT'S FRICKING 5.50!!!   There have been many theories about why the the prices have been increased to Php5.50, the most popular being that the President was playing politics with the jeepney drivers and throwing them a bone in exchange for their support. But why Php5.50?  Personally, I think the higher-ups are screwing with the jeepney drivers. Could you imagine being a jeepney driver at 6 in the afternoon, rush hour in Cubao? Your jeep is packed tighter than Diana Zubiri's tube top, the MMDA officer is leering at you like you're Joyce Jimenez, the dude beside you has worse B.O. than your favorite Bumbay, it looks like it's going to rain, and everyone else around you is driving like a maniac (it's always their fault). You're handed a twenty and a fifty, one's for three fares and the other's for five. Quick, how much do you give back to each? No calculators or pens, and no counting with fingers, either. And you still have to *actually* drive and get the people to where they're going safely, remember?  I'm thinking about it, and it makes *my* head hurt. And I used to go out with a physicist.  I really hope the prices for oil don't increase anymore, for the sake of the poor drivers. If they ask for another price increase, the government could really fuck them up for good. Like, peg the fare at Php6.75.

      My curiosity to try out new things made me sign up for a blogger account.  The Gmail craze kept me writing. (Ah, the things i did for a gmail). And now Pisay98 adds another line to my expanding list of excuses for blogging.  Pisay98 is about to invade the web, and It's good to be here when it happens. Now if only you could remember the password to our  urlLink domain , Jem Bunao.  This is Gamis. Blogging ON.

      I don't watch much MTV anymore, (only on Sundays for Newlyweds, Dismissed, and The Osbournes), so I was surprised the other day to see VJ Cindy Kurleto hawking a Guns N' Roses Greatest Hits collection.  I dunno, I love GNR and "November Rain" is probably my favorite music video of all time, but it just made me a little sad, not because they're old enough to have a greatest hits CD, but because fewer and fewer young people today know who they are. Remember a couple of years ago during the MTV Video Music Awards when Jimmy Fallon kept dropping GNR hints (even whistling "Patience") and nobody got it?  Today, we're more likely to witness this exchange:  "Wow, a Guns N' Roses Greatest Hits CD!"  "Guns N' Who?"  "Guns N' Roses. They were this greeaat heavy metal band from the '80s with a lunatic front man who flew around the stage during concerts and wore catsuits and bandanas. The rest of the band were just as outrageous. Some of their lyrics were profane and controversial, but their songs were really riot, man, with monster guitar solos and lots of screaming."  "Ooh. So they're like The Darkness?"

      Whenever I watch  Pulp Fiction , which I was doing instead of work earlier at the office, I end up craving for burgers and milkshakes. I'm not really fond of hamburgers, and I only usually eat burgers at Jollibee and Burger King. Fortunately for me, Jollibee also serves yummy milkshakes, and I won't have to pay 5 dollars for them.  Which reminds me of an idea I had earlier during the scene at Jack Rabbit Slim's, the Americana restaurant where Vincent Vega and Mia Wallace dined. I was thinking about how it would be cool to have a similar Pinoy restaurant, but this one celebrating Pinoy popular culture from the '80s instead.   And then I had to repress a loud chuckle when I realized that if you dined at that restaurant, there's a fairly good chance that the waiter who introduces himself as Chuckie Dreyfuss to serve you is *actually* Chuckie Dreyfuss himself.

      When first heard about I, Robot, I immediately dismissed it as yet another sci-fi summer blockbuster movie with wisecrackin' will as our hero and I wasn't too keen on watching it. The title didn't help pique my interest either, I thought the title was "I-Robot" and not "I, Robot" and made it sound too much like an Apple product (though I must say, the robots did look strangely like an i-Mac, I can even imagine them coming in different colors...)      However I started hearing a lot of good feedback about it and decided to check it out and see if I was wrong about the movie. I wasn't, it truly was of a sci-fi summer blockbuster with wisecrackin' will as our hero. What surprised me was that I enjoyed it, which meant that 1. It really was a good movie or 2. I am a slave to the Hollywood moviemaking machine. Either way, I liked it... it wasn't dumbed down to an insulting level and it didn't take itself too seriously like A.I (which required some patience but I still liked, even with its "alien  ex machina " ending). In fact, despite the not so subtle foreshadowing and the waaay too many slow-mo, flying through the air while shooting accurately action scenes present to remind you that you are indeed watching a summer movie, it thought it was pretty smart. Heck, I found myself intrigued during the scene where someone was asking why robots, being the glorified toasters that they are, huddled together when stored in the dark or seeked out light on their own...too bad that issue was never tackled again.      As for humor, it's Will Smith, he gets all the wisecracks needed in a Will Smith movie, but personally, the funniest moment was when a robot jumps onto will's Audi (oh and there's a lot of product placement too... if you're sharp, you'll see a box from pizza hut) smashes the windshield, grabs the hero and explains "you are experiencing a car accident".. haha! I think I was the only person who laughed out loud...hehe..      Since I’m on the subject of movies (and have nothing better to do) here are some of the movies I'm looking forward to...     1. Constantine - I think its based yet on another DC comic book character, John Constantine (played by Keanu Reeves), a sort of supernatural detective. He's made a few guest appearances in the sandman series and I've always wanted to read the comic book.. but alas, like LXG it seems I’ll see the movie first. I just hope Keanu doesn't "whoa" his way through the movie.      2. The Village - Another M. Knight Shyamalan movie, so you  know  there's a twist in the end, you just have to see if you can guess it before the end. But still, this guy knows how to build the suspense, to let your own imagination do the scaring, so this movie should be fun.     3.Alien vs. Predator - Hah! Even after being horrified by Freddy vs. Jason (horrified meaning I found the movie to be horrible, it was a movie so bad I found it funny) I'm definitely going to watch this, to satisfy the geek in me. Besides, little green men are for sissies. If it isn’t 8 feet tall, has acid for blood, and a mouth inside a mouth, why bother?

       It just came to my attention yesterday that a bunch of people who joined the blog have all this time been eager to post, and yet they couldn't because they couldn't figure out how to do it.   A couple of them actually talked to me about this yesterday, saying they saw the blog and saw where you could leave comments, but they couldn't find where they could post an entry.  Well, it is a little bit tricky, so here's what you guys need to do:  1. Go to  urlLink www.blogger.com .  2. Log-in with the username and password you entered when you created your account (that is, when you received the email inviting you to join this blog).  3. After logging in, you should be taken to a page called the 'Blogger Dashboard'. Here you should be able to view a list of blogs that you are a part of, and one of them should be 'The Pisay 98 Blog'.  4. Click on the 'New Post' icon (the green cross) to write your post.  5. You should be taken to a form that looks similar to an email compose dialog. On the upper right hand portion of the text box, you should see a couple of tabs: 'Edit HTML' and 'Compose'. You could get away with using the 'Edit HTML' options with most simple messages, but if you want to go fancy in your blog and use  different   colors  or even  different   fonts , you could click on the 'Compose' tab to use a WYSIWYG editor.  6. Once you're done writing, preview your post by clicking on the 'Preview' button in the upper right corner of the box. You could get out of the preview mode and continue editing your post by clicking on the 'Hide Preview' button.  7. If you're done writing, it's time to publish your post by clicking on the orange button that says 'Publish Your Post'. You could also save your post as draft and continue writing and publishing it later.  That's it. O, blog na kayo!

      today i took time off from my hectic schedule to attend the christening of aissa's baby boy chase. you can tell that little guy is gonna be somebody because the Lord of Darkness himself decides to show up.         i was referring to the guy on the right, with the pecs. jinko, not me you lamers.   anyway, i was struck by how few of us actually decided to come. the four girls, jonas, jaemark, jinko, me. what is even more disturbing is the primary reason for not being able to come - work.   look guys: here we are, all of us about 20-25 years old, most are now working their butts off, some deciding to stay in school. in five years - heck, in a couple of years we'd be ready to start our own nest. and with a family comes more work and less time off for ourselves. the next few years will be spent juggling the pressures of work, kids, the wife, husband, other woman, other man, etc. and then we wake up, it's homecoming night, and think,  "shit, i haven't seen my friends in a long time. ano na nga ba itsura ng mga yun?"  if we can't be there for our friends now when the rat race is still manageable, can we be there for them when the race becomes really tough?   are my priorities really that far off the mark? sure, i gotta work to get money. sure, i have to be well off so that my kids won't end up eating pancit canton or fried rice / ketchup for the rest of their lives. i understand that, at least. but we are still young, dammit, opportunity knocks a hell of a lot of times(we just don't listen well enough), and our friends won't be there forever. in the great cycle of life, a day of absence at (insert company here) is a small speck of dust compared to the time you spend in the presence of those you hold dear.   in the words of stephen king:  all that you love will be carried away .       would you stay and watch them go, or will you do something about it?

      There was a great, little moment in  Nuts Entertainment  last night that I was glad I caught. The opening involved the great Joey de Leon dusting off his  bahag  for a little sketch starring Starzan, the Pinoy King of the Jungle (Pekto played Chitae). I loved every little bit of it, even if Janno Gibbs overacted the whole time (as usual), and Joey de Leon had a large gut and sagging boobs.  (It did help a lot that the lovely Ms. Angel Locsin played Jane in the sketch. She's hot enough as it is, but in a Jane costume? Wow. It's a wonder the set, which had a lot of paper decorations, didn't just catch fire right then and there.)  Of course, the Starzan trilogy and the other great Joey de Leon-Rene Requiestas movies ( Elvis and James ,  Long Ranger and Tonton ) were some of the fondest memories from my childhood (and it was a happy one, too). One of my most favorite Pinoy comedy moments came in a  Starzan  sequel (I think it was  The Jungle Triangle , pronounced  Jang-goll Tri-ang-goll).   The witch doctor, played by Vangie Labalan, was doing her witch chant to the beat of the jungle drums. Then out of nowhere, Starzan taps her gently and asks, " Bisaya ka man, 'day? "  And she answers, " Hindi, tagalog ako. "  I know, it's just so mundane and stupid. I don't even know anyone else who finds this funny. Maybe it's because I actually grew up in an  Ilonggo  household, or maybe because Vangie Labalan always has this funny  Bisaya  accent. Or maybe I'm just plain weird. After all, my favorite part of  Long Ranger and Tonton  was the ending where they revealed that the surname of Tonton (Rene Requiestas) was *actually* "Gutierrez".  (Haha, speaking of stupid things to find funny, I could not possibly be the only person in the country who finds Yoyong Martirez's angry man schtick funny, right? " Galit ka ?" " Hinde, nagpapaliwanag lang, 'dong ." Man, I'm weird.)  But let's get back to Starzan. I can't believe it took Joey de Leon this long, almost 15 years, to bring back the Starzan. I mean, people  love  the Starzan characters so much that last year, Rene Requiestas' life story drew monster ratings. How many do you think tuned in because they fondly remember the classic line " Chitae, ganda lalake! " (and the more classic echo " Ulul, sinungaling, panget! Panget! Panget! ") one more time?  Besides. Joey de Leon's bread-and-butter acts for the past few years, Tiyo Pot, the "Truth-or-Charing" guy from  Eat... Bulaga , and the Balakubak anchor from  Nuts , are basically just re-hashings of his old Barbie character (he just made them bitchier and more candid, because Barbie was supposed to be classy). For my money, those acts have been the funniest things you could watch on Pinoy TV this past couple of years.   Wait, I think I have to qualify that statement. Those acts have been the funniest things you could watch on TV this past couple of years that did not involve Madame Auring and her houseboy-slash-underage-fiancee.   Seriously, c'mon, could anything possibly top one of those Startalk banner stories asking,  MAY ASIM PA BA SI MADAME AURING?   Man, those things make my weekend. Then again, I'm weird that way.

      My first post in more than a year... I just remembered that I've had a blog acct for quite some time now. Time to put my rusty writing skills (not that there was much skill to begin with) back into use...  &nbsp;  Now for my random, non-sensical, utterly useless thought for the day  ( disclaimer: "thought for the day" does not really mean I'll post one everyday (yay!), it just sounds better that way)  &nbsp;  I can't believe it, it's barely 9 pm and already my eyelids feel heavier than a... heavy... thingamajig (yep..&nbsp; rusty, rusty, rusty). All thanks to my wonderful new 6-6 work day.&nbsp; Ahh.. the joys of leaving the comfort of your bed at 4 am, of never seeing the light of day, it's absolutely incredible (yes, i'm being sarcastic)&nbsp;  &nbsp;  It's my first day of workin a 12- hour shift and already I'm complaining, I imagine I'll be quite the annoying little whiner after a month of this horrible working schedule... I try thinking of the money I'll be getting from all this overtime, but with the sched like this, I doubt I'll ever be able to use it (and for those opportunistic readers, giving freebies is not an option for me to be able to use the money). I wonder if it's really worth it...&nbsp;it's not like&nbsp;I have a family to support.. and with this sched, I doubt&nbsp;I'll even be able to start a family... &nbsp;  ...hmm, I think I originally planned on all this having a point, but my brain is startin to shut down, I'd better stop now&nbsp;else my mom might find me slumped over the keyboard with a pool of drool forming on the table...  &nbsp;  ...and with that delightful image, i'll say.. good night!

       Remember the time when we (at one time or the other), as students, used to call our teachers and profs weird names and imitate their funniest/most nauseating gestures and accents... well (see the title)...    &nbsp;  It has finally come to bite me. Goodness.    &nbsp;  Imagine seeing one of your students imitating your (admittedly) weird mannerism.     &nbsp;  I thought I've actually prepared myself for this. I thought I was prepared for the fact that one of my students, will, sooner or later, imitate me the way I imitated my funniest/weirdest professor/teacher. Now, I believe being prepared is one thing, seeing it happen infront of you is another.     &nbsp;   Is life truly a cycle you can't break?

      I'm not really very big on poetry; I always thought poems mean so much more to the writer than they ever do for the reader, and T.S. Elliot's stuff always goes over my head.  There are a couple of poets who are exceptions, of course, and probably the biggest is the great Chilean poet  urlLink Pablo Neruda . I have this thing when I encounter work by really talented people where I just say to myself, "Man, I wish I had thought of that." Neruda makes me do that all the time, and he's really the only poet who does that. His most famous collection is called  Veinte Poemas De Amor Y Una Cancion Desesperada .  Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair . I think it's a great, simple title. I wish I had thought of that.  Yesterday marked  his 100th birth anniversary, and I thought I'd share one of my favorite poems of his here.   I do not love you as if you were salt-rose, or topaz, or the arrow of carnations the fire shoots off. I love you as certain dark things are to be loved, in secret, between the shadow and the soul.  I love you as the plant that never blooms but carries in itself the light of hidden flowers; thanks to your love a certain solid fragrance, risen from the earth, lives darkly in my body.  I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I love you straightforwardly, without complexities or pride; so I love you because I know no other way  than this: where  I  does not exist, nor  you , so close that your hand on my chest is my hand, so close that your eyes close as I fall asleep.   If the poem seems familiar, it's because it was featured in the film  urlLink Patch Adams , and is probably one of his two most famous poems along with the beautiful   urlLink Tonight I Can Write  .  I find that the magic in Neruda's writing is very similar to the magic that you could find in the works of  urlLink Gabriel Garcia Marquez , another Latin-born Nobel Laureate for Literature. I suspect this has something to do with the fact that both authors write in their native Spanish and their works are then translated into English.  Curiously, I find the same magic in the work of our recently departed National Artist  urlLink Nick Joaquin . Of course, Joaquin was famous for writing in "Joaquinesque" English; that is, he wrote using the English language as if he were speaking in Filipino.  When I was in grade school, I was lucky enough to be invited to a literature workshop at the CCP. When it was time for us to write poems, the kid beside me raised a question we all had been meaning to ask, "What language should we write our work in?" The guy answered, "The language of your dreams."  It all seemed silly to me at the time (I was 11), but I think I've got it all figured out now. I think Neruda, Marquez, and Joaquin were never really better at writing words than we all are, but I think they're better at dreaming up dreams.

        urlLink    You're  Les Miserables  by Victor Hugo    One of the best known people in your community, you have become something of a phenomenon. People have sung about you, danced in your honor, created all manner of art in your name. And yet your story is one of failure and despair, with a few brief exceptions. A hopeless romantic, you'll never stop hoping that more good will come from your failings than is ever possible. Beware detectives and prison guards bearing vendettas.   Take the  urlLink Book Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid .   Hmm I'd been meaning to re-read this book for the longest time.

      Ok, so Jae and I were chatting yesterday... we've talked about how we should put a sort of weekly theme to this blog in order for people to post. Something that will interest most of the pisay 98 blogging population.  And so, i've been thinking of what would be a good topic to talk about? Incidentally, i'm feeling quite nostalgic today because of  urlLink this song i heard . And my brain is just flooding with high school memories, i just cannot choose!  I could still clearly remember my first days in pisay. My very first time in pisay was during the second screening. Remember how we were assigned to testing rooms alphabetically? Me, being one of people on the end of the list, took my exam in the canteen. Har! Har! Har! Testing date was April 8, 1994.  Enrollment: May 29, 1994. I remember meeting Lorenzo everywhere i go; in the clinic, in the registrar, etc. Of course, we did not really "meet". I don't know him then. "Namukhaan" lang namin ang isa't-isa. So officially, the first person that i met and became my friend was Faye Guerzon.  June 5, 1994, Sunday. I checked in the dorm and met my roommates, first was Monet and later on, Ria and Elena arrived. I still remember I keep calling Elena as "Elaine". Hehehe! We did not "bond" much that night, we went to bed early. Ria set her antique alarm clock (yes, very antique. the one that really goes, "ring ring ring") and put it on her bed side. The alarm clock went off at 4 am and we were all awakened, except Ria. And to think the clock was sitting just beside her ear.  So that was just the start of the year. And the start of the next four years. It's hard to believe that 10 years have passed already. Sigh,  I really miss high school .  Oh, so back to the topic.  What do you think would be a good "theme of the week"?

      all right, stop. collaborate and listen.   and we're off! it's that time of the week again, friends and lovers, when we go visit the dark annals of the web searching for worthwhile stuff. mostly there's trash, yes, but we search anyway, hoping to find that one magical site which makes our day worthwhile.  side note: i went to my cousin's debut last saturday. it had a 70's disco theme, so we had a chance to let loose the raging John Travolta inside.   AND because i still have a hangover from that badass mix, this week's WTF List will let you - yes, YOU - do dat crazy phat mix in the privacy of your own home, cubicle, Starbucks, airport urinal, wherever you may be!  so, check out da mike while da deejay revolves it!     urlLink i know where bruce lee lives  - a kung-fu remixer? yo time has come!   urlLink supergreg  - you might be 'numba one', but for chrissakes shave off that monobrow. you look like edward medel.   urlLink hestekor  - in case you haven't seen the singing ponies, here they are. shoo-wah-wah-wah!   urlLink ken's virtual drumkit  - finally, an online drums tutorial!   urlLink virtual playground  - a showcase of really old drum machines. by the way, they ARE playable.   urlLink flashkit drum machine  - very low-tech. VERY nice.   urlLink create-a-band online  - so, SO awesome. reminds me of the high school days, where anybody can start a band.    stop. hammertime.

      I was preparing to write a lot of stuff down, when, suddenly, I just wasn't in the mood any more.  How's that for recovering from a slump?

      Nagtataka lang ako. Ang dami-dami kong kilalang tao na hanggang ngayon, may hang-up pa rin sa mga high school flame nila. Hindi ko sinasabing in-lab pa rin sila ha, pero sinasabi ko lang, meron pa silang hang-up. Para bang, kahit anim na taon (at maraming tao) na yung nakalipas, hindi pa rin nila makalimutan. O ayaw nilang kalimutan?  Meron diyang pa-text-text pa rin, at meron namang takot na takot mag-text. Merong dinadaan na lang sa Friendster, sa email, o 'di kaya sa Yahoo! Groups na la lang. Merong iba naman, wala na ngang communication, 'di naman matigil sa kadadaldal tungkol sa  kanya . Yung iba nga, ang kapal ng mukha at sa volleyball tournament pa dinadaan. Iniisip ko tuloy, bakit, pagkalipas ng anim na taon, importante pa rin sila.  Naalala ko tuloy, kasama ko si  urlLink Jem Bunao , nakaupo kami sa may front lobby, at pinag-uusapan namin yung isang crush ko noong panahon na yun. Binigyan niya ako ng pep talk, at sinabi sa akin na 'pag dumaan na yung crush ko, kausapin ko raw. At maya-maya nga lang, eto na nga yung crush ko, galing 'atang Bio o Chem lab, dala-dala yung lab gown niya.   At sa dahan-dahan niyang paglapit, inilabas ko na ang lahat ng tapang na tinatago sa dibdib ko at nagbigay ng isang makabagbag-damdaming... "Hi!"  Nagbigay naman siya ng maliit na ngiti at mas maliit na kaway, at habang pinapanood namin siyang maglakad ng palayo, hiniritan na lang ako ni Jem ng, "O, ginawa mo nga yung sinabi ko, haba ng usapan niyo ah, parang nag-bonding nga kayo ah."  Kaya nga naisip ko, kaya meron pa ring hang-up yung ibang tao ngayon, dahil na rin siguro sa panghihinayang.  Bakit nga ba , naisip nila,  nakilala ko siya noong 15 pa lang ako (at tatanga-tanga pa) at hindi ngayong 23 na (tatanga-tanga pa rin, pero hindi na masyadong halata) ? Yun nga ba ang dahilan?  Eh ako ba, meron pang hang-up?  Pucha, wala na noh.  At kung meron man, hinding-hindi ko aaminin. Mamaya binabasa pala ng boyfriend niya 'tong blog na 'to eh.

            Luz, Allen, Jam and I went to the Avilon Zoo in Montalban last Saturday. I was really excited, as I've NEVER been to a zoo before. Thinking that we’d be going on a gimmick later that night and that zoos lie on flat land, I wore high heeled sandals. Those sandals were the most comfortable ones I had; I was really used to wearing them. Apparently, Avilon had a span of 7 hectares -- not a square foot stood on flat land and most of the road had “rough” tiles. Well. Alam nyo na nangyari sa paa ko. Hehe! Nevertheless, I enjoyed looking at and teasing the animals, especially the tiger with sumpong. :)  The one thing that spoiled my Avilon experience (sounds like something from Star Trek) was our tour guide, or should I say, TOR guide. Yeah, she was cute. That was why Allen and Jam insisted on following her in the first place (Luz and I preferred the cute guy). She mispronounced every two words that came out of her mouth… emu as M.U., pavilion as favilyon, and my favorite, habit as habEt. A kid there had to correct her (“habIIIIt!!!”). Our eyes were bulging from our heads because we really had to stop ourselves from laughing. At least we had some entertainment during the tor.  If you guys have the time, drop by the zoo. The place is great. They’re open everyday from 8am-5pm, with guided tours every hour til 3 pm. Each tour takes about 2 hours. Entrance fee is P180 per person. You can call the Avilon office at 9425960, or call Stef at 0917-8995126 for roadmaps. Better yet, call Luz, Allen, Jam or me.  Pabahol -> Luz was the BEST tour guide ever. :)

           Ontong blocks a spike from '90 in the second set      Ah yes, that five letter word that characterizes our weekends...    It's always "bitin;" you've felt it, but it wasn't enough.     This is true for my weekend (and I'm sure it's true for yours). Sabi nga ni Alekos, he hates sundays because it signals the arrival of Monday. And we all know what's wrong with Monday.     Anyway, this post is about the events that transpired during the weekend volleyball game featuring Batch '98 and that's what I should be writing about.    The title of the post says it all for that game. We fell short. In Tagalog,  nabitin kami .   The Batch '90 prevailed over Batch '98 in three sets.      The game started out as horrifying as one could imagine. '90 was hitting serves and we weren't exactly returning them. They weren't hitting hard. It's just that '98 wasn't returning the ball. A typical case of "unforced errors." I'd also have to admit that my play really sucked for that set. I failed to send in two serves (out of two!). The score was horrendous but we did manage to get to double digits (10). Absolutely no highlights for that set.        2nd set huddle; Parang totoo no?      The second set was much more closer than the first, with '98 getting the lead for most part until it made a push in the latter part of the set. Of course, fatigue on the part of '90 was a bit obvious. Their tosser (who resembled a 32 year old version of Rolly Doolittle Marasigan) got injured and was not very effective. Also, '98's serves had a much higher accuracy in the second set. Of course, who could forget Ontong's "unpredictable"  hulogs  and Brian Caparas' string of blocks. '98 prevailed in this set, 25-19 ( i think) to force a clincher set. The third set saw '90 zooming to a 7-2 lead until '98 catched up and evened the score at 7. '90 had a 7-2 run that set up 4 match points, 9-14. With the game on the line, '98 made a 5-0 run that evened the count at 14. The last tie was at 15-15 until '90 scored two more points that sealed the win for them.    Well,  ayun nga, bitin...  But it was a good overall game (I really wonder what happened to that first set...). Though Oli packs a few pounds down there, he can still pack a whallop. I was fairly convinced he had the strongest spike out there (and he had to prove it a couple of times pa!). Elea, though arriving a bit late and probably shaken from the traffic, managed to play a nice game. Shaty, claiming she had only two hours of sleep, didn't show it at all (both in her game play and how she looked). Pat, inspired by Chico, played a game worthy of her CS jersey. Even though she' plagued by various insinuations brought about by that "draw your own conclusions part 2" post, Salve managed to play a game that reminded me why she was on the Eng'g varsity when she was a student. Brian, a surprise player last time, came much more prepared.  Parang kinarir ang  volleyball. This time, he was in athletic gear and he brought his A game. '98 missed the services of Marwin and Bano (and those others out there!!). Ma'am Dacs, Jae, Jam, and Alekos (Opal ka pa rin...) was there for the much needed moral support. And of course, Jae was there to take pictures...         The look of dejection! Alekos' reaction says it all.      Oh yeah, Jonas was there. I forgot to bring his shirt (which by then was already clean!). I wonder what's wrong... he must be living in some third world country or something. Hmmm, OFW's might make a good topic for a blog. However, don't expect me to write one. :)    Well. 'Till the end of the month. The next games are scheduled as follows:     Aug. 28 (Sat) 2:30PM versus '88     Aug. 29 (Sun) 9 AM versus '93

      It has been a long weekend for a lot of people I'm sure. It's the same thing for me and our fellow batchmates who took time to play and/or watch the alumni volleyball tournament (see previous posts).  The first game of batch '98 was against perennial nemesis '97 (beefed up by EJ Baranda's batch '89). I truly believed we had a chance to beat them, considering that we were familiar with batch '97 (and EJ) and that we forced them to three long sets last year (the set they lost actually cost them a seat in the semi-finals).  On batch '98s side was (in order of arrival) shaty, myself, oliver, salve, brian caparas (who actually arrived much earlier than me but I didn't saw him until after elea arrived), elea, jonas (who just can't seem to get his requirements done; he must be living in some third world country or something), and marwin (who arrived early for the next day's game but JIT for the third set). Dacs, jae, jam, and joyce (arriving after the game) provided the much needed "moral support." Our team would have been defaulted had it not been for the (pleasantly) surprising apperances of jogon and brian. The game started out pretty well with our team winning the first set (i forgot the score). Shaty had to leave and, as expected from people generally out of shape, fatigue was felt by most players. It ended with the other team winning 2 more sets.  The visit to Pisay wouldn't have been complete without a visit to none other than our neighbor, the Office of the Ombudsman!  Okay, so it was a lame joke, but we went to the next best place, SM City!! Brought back a lot of HS memories, some notable, some forgettable. A movie at Gale (Collateral) ended my Saturday, rather late i should say, considering we had a game at 9AM the next day. Oh, nga pala, we saw Joana and Noel (her BF) in Galleria, enjoying dinner at Popeye's.  Sunday was not what I expected. I arrived a little before 9AM and there were only 6 people in the gym: ontong, 2 officials, and 3 people from batch '96. A few minutes later, batch '96 (the defending champs) were complete and we were only 3 (plus salve). Shaty arrived (with kay quema in toll) but we were only 5!! The officials ruled we were defaulted and only then did marwin arrive! Not that it would matter, but we still played. As expected, we got creamed by batch '96. Highlights of the game included, well mostly batch '96 highlights. Ontong never really got the opportunity to show what he learned at volleyball camp at PBS but Kay (our savior, really!) got smothered by the opposing camp's serves. Grabe, wala awa yung mga taga batch '96! But, I would like to thank Kay, on behalf of the entire batch, for having the guts to play that day. Thanks!  Oh yeah, dumating pala si RJ (a.k.a. Rodrigo --> say emphatically) in all his buffness. You won't recognize him until you talk to him.  **********   Invite lang    For those of you who want to play volleyball or just cheer and watch the games, the team's next games are (all at the Pisay gym):      Aug. 14 (sat) 2:30PM [vs. eric soriano (eng journ teacher) and the rest of '90]   Aug. 28 (sat) 2:30PM [vs. '88]   Aug. 29 (sun) 9AM [vs. '93]      these teams are actually beatable (unlike batch '96) so the team needs your support. it would also be a nice chance to get some headway in the alumni homecoming chit-chat. of course, there's an SM City outing after the game :)      are the UP Med people reading our blog? Hey, if you are, please join us!! Special mention to JPL, Charisse, and Julius. (NOT Med: Also to Cholo, Paulo Chua; WHERE ARE YOU GUYS?)

       with all the hoopla that surrounds the alumni homecoming comes the excitement of alumni sportsfests (doesn't really sound exciting...)      tomorrow marks the start of the pisay alumni volleyball tournament (to be held in pisay of course!). so far, players include myself, ontong, oliver (not oliver g. ontong!!), bano, pat, marwin, salve, eleanor, and, to my pleasant surprise our import from berkley,ca. shaty!      for those who have free time this weekend, the games are scheduled on saturday, 3:30 PM and sunday, 9 AM. if you want to play, you can come and join us!      i think the basketball games will start a bit later (around mid-august, according to dacs)      contact me for more details!

           Just a couple of pictures of me and my little sister. I know I've written about her a bunch of times before, but what are you gonna do? Anyway, just last week, she made it to the honors program at her school, with straight A+ grades. I'm especially proud of it because, well, as a way to help out my folks, I've been paying for her tuition fees.  (And it's quite a tuition fee, too. Let's put it this way, I studied on a scholarship throughout high school and college, and for most of that period I even received stipends. I actually spent more for her tuition fees in a single year than what my family spent for all of my high school  and  college years.)  Of course, it's already become a joke for me and my friends, when we talk about life, love, and settling down (because, as young as we are, we're pretty aware that it's around the corner, seeing that a couple of our friends have gotten married just this past year.) The conversation goes like this:   Me:  " Gusto ko nang mag-asawa pare, pero hindi pa puwede eh. Nagpapa-aral pa ako ng kapatid eh. "   Friend:  " Ah, ok yan pare ah. Ilang taon na ba siya ?"   Me:  " Grade 2 pa lang. Tapos balak pa raw niyang mag-doctor. "  Of course, poor Icay isn't spared from all the joking. She's the youngest child, and before her comes three brothers, so you could imagine how much punishment she takes from the rest of us. For example, when I bring home  pasalubong , my brothers and I would joke about not paying Icay's tuition anymore. You know, so I could bring home  pasalubong  for them every day. And Icay, who acts every bit like a 16-year-old  colegiala  already, would just turn her noses at us and pretend she doesn't hear what her idiot brothers are saying.  Then again, she wouldn't be spared from the jokes even if I weren't paying for her tuition. After all, we're brothers, and isn't that really what brothers are for? We always joke about how she has two different personalities; she is this  mataray  little prima donna at home because she gets away with everything being the youngest one, while at school, she is (apparently) a quiet, well-behaved, and well-liked little girl.  My brother Joseph, who is the only one among us who has a bit of an artistic bent, even created this hilarious drawing on  Notepad  Paint illustrating this phenomenon:   urlLink     I liked the drawing so much, it's now the default wallpaper on my home desktop.  I suck at drawing, so I just needle Icay the best way I know how: by being an ass. I usually call her silly names, because she  hates  being called silly names. Kikay, Baby Iks, Kiki, Kuku, Cookie, Kiks, Jaica-icay, and my personal favorite,  Sandara Pork , which drives her crazy because she secretly likes Sandara but would never admit to it. Of course, all of my silliness is just a ruse so that she'd give a big kiss and a bigger hug. You know, to make her idiot big brother shut up.  Which, I guess, makes it all good. Every centavo I spent for her education, well, is worth it, if only for all those hugs and kisses I get when I come home from work, and the bonus ones I get when I needle her. The straight A+ grades are just a nice bonus, I guess. Idiot big brothers should only be so lucky.

       urlLink Faye  posted earlier at the Pisay 98 mailing list that Luz passed  urlLink the board exam for Veterinary Medicine . I figured I'd post about it here, and maybe attach a picture of her, but unfortunately, this was the only picture of hers I could find.     Congratulations Luz!
