      I'm blogging this right now as I sit in one of the libraries of the university that I work at now.  There is a man sitting next to me, probably a grad student, who smells like sweaty feet and who quietly grunts and moans and rocks back and forth in his chair as he types his email.   Sigh.  I started this blog on Tuesday and on Wednesday invited a good friend, Becky, to join.  We're not quite sure what we're doing and where we're going with this yet--it might in time turn into a web magazine or/and on-line resource for poets, or it might, as so many grass roots literary projects do, die within a month's time.    Whatever happens, it's always important to try stuff like this.  Marginalized fields such as poetry need many people making many attempts to make our fields matter.    I'm new to blogging, but I like the excitement of it, of watching a creative project like this find its form and grow...Maybe in time pick up readers.  Maybe not.  Maybe continue quietly forever in an unread Zen-like state.   Or maybe there will be people who will in time find it and begin to think more about the field.  And maybe they'll start looking for the stuff, and maybe they'll start reading it, and maybe a poem here or there will help them, in small ways, change their own lives.  The man next to me, humming now, is tucking his knees into his tee-shirt and continuing to rock. He's excited too.  ****** FIRST FIG -Edna St. Vincent Millet  My candle burns at both ends; It will not last the night; But ah, my foes, and oh, my friends— It gives a lovely light.

      Okay, I'm a swing voter, (and I know I probably shouldn't admit to that in these politically polarized times, oy....) but even though I haven't totally made up my mind on who I'm going to vote for this year I think it's rather cool that John Kerry's campaign slogan, "Let America Be America Again," is taken from a Langston Hughes poem.    Next month a volume of Hughes poems called *Let America Be America Again* will be published to tie in with Kerry's campaign. It will contain eight other Hughes poems besides the title one.  Kerry (or Kerry's ghost-writer...) will write the preface.  Whether or not this was an appropriate poem for Kerry to choose for his campaign is debateable.     According to Timothy Noah of *Slate*:    "Let America be America again" comes from a poem published in 1938 by the Harlem renaissance poet Langston Hughes. But Hughes intended the line ironically. A black man living in the pre-civil rights era would have had to be insane to look back to a golden age of freedom and equality in America, and Hughes was not insane. Hughes was, rather, an enthusiastic cheerleader for the Soviet Union at the time he wrote Let America Be America Again, which explains the poem's agitprop tone. 'I am the young man, full of strength and hope,' Hughes writes in the poem:  "'Tangled in that ancient endless chain  Of profit, power, gain, of grab the land! Of grab the gold! Of grab the ways of satisfying need! Of work the men! Of take the pay! Of owning everything for one's own greed!'  "Toil good, private ownership bad, etc. Hughes ends his poem on a more hopeful note (America never was America to me/ And yet I swear this oath--/ America will be!), but the future Hughes imagined for America when he wrote those words probably looked a lot like Stalinist Russia."  Noah goes on to say that:  "Kerry's preface makes it much harder for him to claim that he is ignorant of the circumstances under which Hughes wrote this poem. He notes that it came out of the Great Depression, which brought greater misery to blacks than to whites. He doesn't note that the hardships of the Great Depression drove Hughes and various other writers and artists (even, momentarily, Ronald Reagan!) to belief in Soviet-style communism. Here's Kerry's sanitizing literary analysis:  "'It was in that climate that Langston Hughes, Black America's unofficial poet laureate, wrote his powerful poetic lament, Let America Be America Again. While it is the litany of the great promise of opportunity that has drawn so many of the world's disaffected to our shores, the poem is also a call to make that promise real for all Americans -- especially for the descendants of slaves.  "'Not unmindful of the duality of meanings, I was drawn to incorporate the words of the poem in my 2004 presidential campaign, because it reminds us that America is a nation always in the process of becoming, always striving to build 'a more perfect union.' We must not forget that African Americans and women were written out of the Constitution before they were written in.'"  Noah finishes up:  "I applaud Kerry's political message, but as lit crit, this is a whitewash. What 'duality of meanings' is Kerry talking about? The poem has only one meaning: America's golden promise is hooey. It's hooey for blacks, it's hooey for the farmer, it's hooey for the Native Americans. It's hooey for the entire proletariat. Time to seize the means of production! Please, Senator Kerry, Chatterbox begs of you: Do not incorporate the phrase, 'Let America be America again' into your acceptance speech tonight. The New York Times is onto this. The Washington Post can't be far behind."  (The quotes above were taken from the Ottawa Citizen July 29, 2004 --Thursday Final Edition.)

      I just clicked on the "free poetry contest" ads that somehow magically appeared at the top of this blog (did a real person put those there?  Or were those a result of Internet crawlers or some other weird manifestation of artificial intelligence?)  I suppose we'd better check them out sometime to make sure they're legit.  Weird, weird, weird.

       As someone who has studied Plath's life and work for a long time, I was intrigued by the notion of someone having taken on Plath, Hughes, and their friends and families as characters for a novel.  The chapters of  Wintering  are each titled after one of Plath's  Ariel  poems, in the original sequence Plath had planned for the book -- the manuscript was to begin with the word "love" and end with the word "spring."   Wintering  author Kate Moses has clearly done a lot of excellent research -- this is apparent even before you get to her notes at the back of the book.  Readers who are familiar with Plath's life and work  will find the characters' thoughts and the book's settings dressed with details from Plath's poems, journals, and letters -- the six jars of honey, the "lurid skins" of balloons that appear in an  Ariel   It is on this level that  Wintering  succeeds as "A Novel of Sylvia Plath." Kate Moses has immersed herself in the wealth of material that's out there, by and about Plath, and has produced a crystalline snowglobe world out of what had been chunks and fragments.  It's also interesting that the novel appears not to take sides. Plath and Hughes are human, each with strengths and flaws. Even Dido Merwin and Assia Wevill are fleshed out, rather than left as flat villains of the piece.    But herein lies what dissatisfied me about  Wintering  -- there doesn't seem to be any villain or, if a villain, per se, isn't necessary, there's no fire, no thrill, none of the crash and bang and intensity one gets from reading Plath's actual writing, whether it's her poems or journals. Apart from one scene in which a delirious Plath hears strange voices on the telephone and seems to see carrion birds in her house, there is no hint of her irrationality and demanding nature (aspects of her personality that have been under debate for decades, as to whether they really existed) or her intensity (which was an undeniable Plath trait).  Even though I was largely dissatisfied with the book (far too many of us Plath fans feel like we own her), there's no denying Kate Moses' achievement. Her creation is believable and incredibly detailed, especially the descriptions of life at Court Green (as idyllic and bucolic as I ever imagined it myself), the interactions of the Plath and Hughes characters (both as newlywed writers goading each other to produce, and as an estranged couple), and Plath's isolation during the winter in London, as she cares for her two young children.  I'm giving the book only three stars because, though I feel Plath fans will enjoy it, I can't imagine a casual reader picking it up and pushing all the way through to the end. As far as I'm concerned, a good biography of Plath is still much more interesting, especially with the mystery of "What was going through her head that day?" Though Moses has imagined that in a believable way, the mystery of not knowing is still more interesting.  The glory of  Wintering  is in the details -- details that have been picked up from primary source material: the poems, letters, and journals of Sylvia Plath.

      When I first began reading Diane Middlebrook's  Her Husband , I was disappointed.     "This is all the stuff I already know," I thought. "St. Botolph's...black marauder...pushy American girl...I've read this all before. Where's the new stuff?"     Plath fans like myself, who've read every biography and scrutinized every poem, need to hang in there for a bit. It takes a while to tap the riches in this book, but once you hit pay dirt, you'll be buried in it. You can expect nothing less from Diane Middlebrook's exhaustive research and crisp, yet sensitive writing.     The book is essentially a biography of Ted Hughes, but it is a biography of Hughes in relation to Plath -- possibly the only kind of biography that could ever be written about Ted Hughes.     Middlebrook takes what has been said over and over about Hughes and Plath -- that they were larger-than-life, highly charismatic, very intense people -- and digs deep with research and literary analysis. The result is two fully-fleshed mythical figures, with the history of -- and reasons for -- the shaping of their mythic status.     Speaking of the literary analysis, it is incredibly detailed, dissected to a dizzying extent. Middlebrook is quite a scholar, and makes bold connections between various Plath and Hughes poems (some of which were written on opposite sides of the same piece of paper -- a practice Middlebrook calls Plath & Hughes's "hand-to-hand combat"). The poems take on squirming new life in the illumination Middlebrook provides.     Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes were complex, inscrutable people. They believed their relationship was fated, and that indeed seems to have been the case. They goaded each other to produce writing that was better and more unique than anything else being written at the time. The destruction of their marriage was the catalyst for Plath's final poems, the ones that would guarantee her immortality.     It's hard to know how to feel about Ted Hughes. I have a lot more interest in, and respsect for, him after reading this book. One thing is certain -- he is the only man who could have endured life in the shadow of Sylvia Plath. A hunter, a creator of myths, only his questing, questioning nature could have been strong enough to stand up to all Plath threw at him, in life and in death.

      Here's a site that's got poets talking:  http://www.foetry.com/index.html  This is a site which investigates and exposes fraudulent poetry contests.  It picks out those esp. where judges give awards to their own students and friends.    The site was launched on April 1, 2004.  According to a July 18 article in the *Boston Globe* by Stephen Burt, at one point the site received   "1,000 page views in a single day - quite a crowd for gossip about new verse. The site has prompted vitriol elsewhere in cyberspace, on various blogs and message boards: Poet and publisher Janet Holmes of Ahsahta Press in Boise calls it 'repellent,' California poet and blogger Eileen Tabios describes Foetry as 'the dark side of the poetry world,' while poet, critic, and publisher Kevin Walzer of WordTech Communications in Cincinnati complains that 'these guys see conspiracies everywhere, and it's causing needless harm.'  Burt goes on to say that "the site's proprietors work hard to hide their identities, registering their domain through a proxy, and answering inquiries (including those made for this article) only through the site's own message board. That anonymity keeps them (if they are poets) from having their own verse blackballed; it also makes them harder to sue."  The article also points out this other sad, current fact:   Regardless of potentially-biased judging practices,  "without contests, some publishers would fold. As Walzer points out, 'There seem to be more people willing to pay for a chance to have their own book published (i.e., contest reading fee) than there are people willing to buy a book of poetry by someone else.'"

      This was sent out by the Associated Press on July 27:  "LONDON - Saddam Hussein appears depressed and demoralized in solitary  confinement, spending his time writing poetry, tending a garden and  reading the Quran, according to a report published Monday in The  Guardian newspaper.  "One of Saddam's poems is about George Bush, though the report did not  specify whether that referred to President Bush or his father, Saddam's  foe in the 1991 Gulf War." ****************************** In response to this the *Washington Post* printed the following poem.  They introduced it by saying that none of Saddam's poems "has been released yet, but we can imagine, can't we?"   They call me Beast of Baghdad. They're hurtful and they're snide -- But that's because they've never seen My sweet, poetic side.  Sure, I authorized some floggings, And gassed to death some foes, But I'm hoping now to show the world The Saddam that no one knows.  This Saddam is filled with anguish For all things mean and bad. I weep for mankind's pain -- in fact, My name begins with Sad.  You thought I'd hidden weapons And I admit I did, in part: My pen, it has a warhead To warm the coldest heart.  Neither cell nor fetid rathole Can still this plaintive wail. I'll keep writing mush, I swear it Till you get me outta jail.   -- Gene Weingarten

      According to Aliki and William Barnstone's *A Book of Women Poets From Antiquity To Now,* (Schocken Books, 1992) Enheduanna was "the first writer, male or female, in history whose name and work have been preserved."  She was also a Sumerian moon priestess.    Here is a section of "The Exaltation of Enheduanna," an 18 stanza poem addressed to Inanna.  I carried the ritual basket and sang your praise. Now I am banished among the lepers. Even I cannot live with you. Shadows approach the light of day, the light is darkened around me, shadows approach the daylight, covering the day with sandstorm. My soft mouth of honey is suddenly confused. My beautiful face is dust.  -Translated by William W. Hallo and J.J.A. van Dijk

      In the middle of July 2004, the magazine Publisher's Weekly sent out a notice saying that they will no longer review poetry.  According to a message sent to poets and poetry-lovers from Sarabande Books, PW cited "poor budget cuts and poor advertising revenue as the cause."  Sarabande wrote the following in their email:  "We're hoping you'll want to drop Jeff Zaleski a note protesting this policy change, explaining how the loss of even one review outlet and especially an 'industry' one like theirs is a major blow.  Thank you!  "Jeff Zaleski Publishers Weekly jzaleski@reedbusiness.com"  Many people in the poetry world were upset by this news, and sent out a myriad of emails to friends calling for the creation of new webzines and literary magazines to try to fill the new void.   This blog is a response to that call.

       St. Jerome wrote on scripture.    He must have had an ink well, or at least a    graphite pencil.

      That's me. Because I want to know--Marina, were you really posting at 6-whatever in the morning? Or is the clock off on this baby?   Also, has anyone had a moment to think about the Creative Commons? I've had slightly less&nbsp;than a moment, but I did see on the&nbsp;Web site for EFF.org a CC license. I didn't have time to check out what the restrictions were, but I thought that was cool--a big group&nbsp;like EFF&nbsp;following our lead and getting a CC license.  We must&nbsp;try to remain humble&nbsp;about being on the cutting edge of sharing information, whether purely creative or factual&nbsp;in content, but I think we can be assured that we're setting trends.  And, speaking of creative, here are some words for you to take for your own and make what you will, follow bloggers, be it a poem, a story, a shower curtain, a...  Pumpkin. Okra. Lounge.

      Hey.&nbsp; This blog here is being started by a group of fledgeling librarians in the LEEP program at the University of Illinois.&nbsp;&nbsp; LEEP is a long-distance education program for people who want to get their Masters in Library Science while continuing to live and work in their home towns, which, in some cases, are as close to the University as Chicago, and in other cases as far away as Hong Kong or Germany or London.&nbsp; We take classes and interact w/each other mostly on-line, although we all have to be on campus once a semester.&nbsp; Right now we're all on-campus in what's known here as "librarian boot-camp"--a 10 day marathon session in which we learn how to do web design and learn about the main theoretical issues affecting our field and re-learn (as many of us have been out of school for a while) how to be graduate students.&nbsp; We also socialize a lot, and drink a lot of beer,&nbsp;and make good friendships, and get really stressed out and exhausted and silly.&nbsp;  Personally,&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been working so hard I keep&nbsp;having weird dreams about my classmates at night, all night long.&nbsp; The best weird dream I had so far was one in which a small number of us  &nbsp; 1. broke into a bookstore 2. then were suddenly back in one of the dorm room lounges together, where we&nbsp;all had on&nbsp;costumes--the *best* one of which was&nbsp;worn by a female&nbsp;classmate&nbsp;(the first initial of her name is "K," b.t.w.&nbsp; Heh.)&nbsp;which was made completely out of six-inch long paperclips, w/a 2 foot-long one positioned straight across her chest.&nbsp; &nbsp; In the dream we all laughed uprociously and ran around and jumped&nbsp;from lounge chair to lounge chair, capes and feathers flying behind us.... &nbsp; (Yay geeky&nbsp;librarian superheros!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) &nbsp; Anyway.&nbsp; One of the things we have to do for class is to put together group projects about issues related to our profession.&nbsp; Our professor gave us our topics a couple of days ago, and then pointed to different parts of the room where we to go to if we wanted to be a part of that group.&nbsp; i.e. Those who wanted to work on "The Open Archives Initiative" were to meet near the windows, those who wanted to work on "Future of Funding for Libraries" were to meet near the back of the room, other groups were in other spaces and "Creative Commons and its driving forces" were to meet near the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; When&nbsp;we were given the go-ahead we all went to the&nbsp;group we wanted to join, and a small bunch of us bolted as fast as we could to the "Creative Commons" section, as we'd read a book for class by Lawrence Lessig called *Free Culture* which is about recent developments in copywrite law that are&nbsp;threatening our culture's creativity and intellectual growth.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; The first few postings on this blog come from the members of this small&nbsp;group. &nbsp; My classmates and I&nbsp;will probably&nbsp;talk about these developments a more in future postings...we've created this Blog initially because we want to make something that we can register with Creative Commons and thus find out more about the process and implications involved in registering a creative project.&nbsp; We also would like to, as time goes on,&nbsp;document some of what we're learning about about this topic in general, and create a fun, readable record of what we're finding out--something that people outside of the LEEP community can access and hopefully find helpful as well.&nbsp;  &nbsp; We're not sure yet what, if anything, this blog will eventually turn into.&nbsp;&nbsp;We've been talking about how&nbsp;after this particular project is over we'd &nbsp;like to&nbsp;invite the rest of our class to join the blog &nbsp;as a place to continue talking publicly about library/literacy/information related issues in a fun,&nbsp;beyondtheintimidatingeyeofprofessors-type&nbsp;way...(weird how posting something on the WWW feels somehow more private than posting it on one of our class bulletin boards) ...perhaps, perhaps, perhaps&nbsp;we can add something to the field by rambling and musing together on line about these issues.&nbsp;  &nbsp; It would be cool if we could create something that laypeople might be interested in following as well, as the issues we're dealing with as a class are ones which actually do affect everyone in our country, even though not everyone is aware of how important these issues are.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The world needs geeky librarian superheroes.&nbsp;  &nbsp; It does, damn it, it does.&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

      Well, here we are—in the green pastures of the creative commons. And, having gotten here with such speed, I find myself slightly out of breath and full of questions: How big is this place? What’s it for? Why are you here? Why am I here?   Why am I here? As someone with the fairly nebulous job of "senior proofreader" at a "brand marketing company," I spend a large part of every workday saying things like, "You’ve got the wrong copyright line on that Sell Sheet," "The picture on this ad for Y shows company X’s product too, so we need to add their legal," and "This client wants ® on the first text use of their name but don’t put it in the possessive because that violates the brand identity." I guess, in fact, that I’m a bit of the Trademark Police threatening people with going to the Copyright Jail if they don’t follow all the rules, even the ones the clients make up themselves.   In my private life, though, I am a "closet writer" and like any of the millions of closet writers in the world, I dream the simple dream of publishing, of acclaim, of recognition, of—in short—a  urlLink MacArthur Fellowship . And as such a lowly closet writer, I wonder what my interest in the creative commons should be. Would I put a story in this pasture? What would happen to it? What will grow if this field is paved over? So I enter into this blog, Jerome’s Army, with fellow LEEPers to see what happen in this place.  &nbsp;  How to begin? Not really knowing what to do or what was here,&nbsp;I&nbsp;looked to see what other people were creating. After some Internet bumping around, I found these two sites:  urlLink newyorkish.com  and  urlLink evolutionofart.modblog.com .  &nbsp;  Check them out. One thing that struck&nbsp;me was the  support  the environment seemed to offer these creators. But enough from me for now—tell me what you think!

      I haven't thought about posting here since the class ended over a week ago. I haven't thought about librarianship and its issues. I question myself, do I really care about these things- copyright perpetuity, software filters on public access pcs, electronic publishing? I look around the archives in which I work and realize that these issues do not exist here. Meaning, really, that no one discusses them. It reminds me of Freire's culture of silence. But I think its more of a culture of apathy for the whole, interest for the sole, for one's own patch of earth. (Dare I say the dismantling of the public sphere for the glory of the economy?)  So do I care enough to keep the updates on the DMCA coming into my email box? Do I care enough to make myself care when those around me could care less? I feel like the issues have moved on to someone else. The intensity of the class fueled my interest, but I could not sustain it when pushed out into the 'real' world. The 'real' world of instant pleasure, pain killers, multi-media getaways...where issues are exhibited not dissected. some soma and feelies please...  [But that's not fair either. Some people care on the outside. The few.]  Now I await the fall semester to give me my fuel. I wait for other LEEPers to talk to about these things that even as I write I forget about. (Symptom of the fall from pinnacle to nadir?) This murkiness.  What is this blog about?  I thought it meant something, to someone, to futures, and presence.    Write and answer and feel and say and see what may come...
