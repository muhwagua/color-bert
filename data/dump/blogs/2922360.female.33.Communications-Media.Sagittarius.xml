      I have not written about the party for a reason.&nbsp;   My father's brother Steve has deeply set emotional issues.&nbsp; The only reason his marriage to his deceased wife Cheryl was 'perfect' was that she only argued with him once.&nbsp; If Steve gets his way, if you agree with him, more importantly, if you don't piss him off, he's your friend for life.   Steve is a very bitter man,&nbsp;has a very caustic tongue, and his friendship comes with a price.&nbsp; In his attempts to be 'honest', what he does is completely tear a person down, attack them in their weak spots, put that person down and build himself up.&nbsp; I don't think he realises this, but I've seen it, and been the subject of his barbed tongue often enough to know.   To be honest, I have no idea exactly why he is mad at me.&nbsp; What I do know is that he walked into the party and proceeded to pick a fight with me.&nbsp; I think I was within reasonable bounds to order him to leave after he walked up to me and said, "You're a bitch, you're a liar, you're not welcome in my house, and I don't even want to talk to you anymore."&nbsp; When I told him to leave, that I would not tolerate being spoken to like that, Steve threatened to hit me in the face.   No one heard his threat to hit me, only me telling him I was calling 911.   GAWD.   I don't say any of what I just wrote about Steve with bitterness.&nbsp; I am bluntly honest, especially about myself and my actions.&nbsp; If I did something to aggrivate him to the point where he felt justified in threatening to hit me, I would write about it.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is never justification for someone to threaten to hit anyone, mind you.&nbsp;   The only reason he stayed at the party...had nothing to do with my siblings and cousins telling me I needed to calm down.&nbsp; The only reason, and I mean THE ONLY REASON Steve stayed is because I love my Dad...&nbsp; Steve was in my Dad's wedding party and stood with Dad when he married my Mom.&nbsp; I wanted the party to be a happy occasion for my parents.&nbsp; It was.&nbsp; On that day, this is all that mattered.   I gotta say...it's fricking scary what I'm about to say publically...for the first time.   My family would deny what I am about to say to their individual dying breaths most likely (though I certainly hope that does not happen for some time to come).   I say this with no disrespect intended towards my Dad.&nbsp; I love both my parents very much.   I am the daughter of an alcoholic.&nbsp; My life has been deeply affected by my Dad's alcoholism as his was, as he grew up in an alcoholic, abusive household.&nbsp;&nbsp;   And so, Steve's behavior also stems from growing up in&nbsp;the same alcoholic, abusive household as my Dad grew up in.   Steve knew which of my buttons to push.&nbsp; It made him visibly happy to see me lose my cool.&nbsp; That is Steve's way of 'winning'.   There comes a time...when the way things used to work simply don't work for you anymore.&nbsp; You can either continue on as things have been...or strike out in a new, uncharted direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I recognize that I have a problem.   So...tonight, I went to my first Al-Anon meeting.   What is Al-Anon?   The following explanation and questions were taken from the following web site:    urlLink  http://www.acafg.com/did_you_grow_up.html      &nbsp;   Al-Anon is for families, relatives and friends whose lives have been affected by someone else's drinking.&nbsp; Many adults question whether they have been affected by alcoholism. If someone close to you has, or has had a drinking problem, the following questions may help you in determining whether alcoholism affected your childhood or present life, and if Al-Anon is for you.(Reprinted by permission from Al-Anon World Service Office)     &nbsp;   Do you constantly seek approval and affirmation?&nbsp;&nbsp;   Do you fail to recognize your own accomplishments?   Do you fear criticism?   Do you overextend yourself?   Have you had problems with your own compulsive behavior?     Are you uneasy when your life is going smoothly, continually anticipating problems?   Do you feel more alive in the midst of crisis?&nbsp;   Do you still feel responsible for the problem drinker in your life?   Do you care for others easily, yet find it difficult to care for yourself?   Do you isolate yourself from other people?   Do you respond with fear to authority figures and angry people?   Do you have trouble with intimate relationships?   Do you attract and/or seek people who tend to be compulsive or abusive?   Do you often mistrust your own feelings and the feelings expressed by others?   Do you find it difficult to identify and express your emotions?   Do you think parental drinking may have affected you?     &nbsp;   Alcoholism is a family disease. Those of us who have lived with this disease as children sometimes have problems which the Al-Anon program can help us to resolve. If you have answered "YES" to some or all of the above questions, Al-Anon may help. You can contact Al-Anon by checking in your local phone directory     &nbsp;   ********************************************   I answered more of those questions in the affirmative than I care to admit.&nbsp;&nbsp;   I'll be honest, I don't know about this.&nbsp; What I do know is, that I&nbsp;something needs to change...and that something, or rather someone, is me.   I will admit, I was not very happy at the meeting tonight.   I asked someone I know who is an AA member to go to this meeting with me.&nbsp; The meeting was not a normal meeting, but rather a 15th Anniversary party for this particular group, with a pot luck and special speakers.   I did not want to talk this time.&nbsp; I simply wanted to watch.&nbsp; The person I arrived with stood and announced to everyone that he had brought me with him tonight..that it was my very first time.  My first thought?&nbsp; "Oh F**K!"   Pardon me...but I was not happy.&nbsp; My choice as to whether or not I was going to announce my presence was taken from me.&nbsp; I wasn't going to say anything, and nearly walked right out the door then.   I don't mind being the center of attention.&nbsp; Sometimes I relish in it.&nbsp; In this circumstance though, I am dealing with the idea of confronting some seriously painful events/issues/etc...and didn't appreciate what happened.   This person should have known better than to announce that I was a first-timer.&nbsp; He knew I was more than a bit ambivient and emotional about going, period.   It's nothing to make a big deal over...but I will mention it to him at some point.&nbsp; His intentions were good.&nbsp; I simply am very *touchy* about this at the moment.&nbsp; This was not an *easy* decision for me...to make what I guess you might call my first step.&nbsp;   Moving on...   In the post where I wrote about having herpes, I wrote about needing to 'Let go, and&nbsp;let God.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recognize that I need to do the same in this instance.&nbsp; I'll take this one baby-step at a time and see where this path leads me.   I need time to digest all this, and to attend meetings...so for the time being...this is all I intend to write about my decision to attend Al-Anon.   Love and peace to all.

      This is the first of two blogs I just discovered that I had previously written.  I started a blog under a different name, and had forgotten about it.  I only just 'found' it when I tried to do an 'Audio Blogger' entry here, and received a confirmation e-mail that the audio was online...but in a different place than I'd thought it was.  So...I am closing out that old account and amending this current blog with the two previous entries from the old one.  As always...I hope you enjoy my ramblings.  *SMILE*    ***************************************************** It's funny...how sometimes you try to learn to do something, and it seems so incredibly hard. Almost to the point of complete, total, and utter frustration. Then one day, you don't even think about what you are doing...and all of a sudden...you are doing it! The moment you realize, "Like, OH MY GOD! I'm really doing this!", all of a sudden, you stumble. you start to concentrate on what you are doing...and for a few moments, you struggle...but then...you can do it.  I think life in general is like this. For me, the cool thing was I used chopsticks when eating sushi...and it looked like I was a pro. I brought a girlfriend to Noble Fish in Clawson, Michigan so she could experience the best, most fresh sushi in the state. I was talking and eating, when I suddenly realized I was using the chopsticks in a way I wondered if I ever would or could. Previous attempts at using chopsticks left me with using my fingers. When I realized what I was doing...for a few minutes...I ,all of a sudden, was unable to repeat what I'd been doing without thinking just a few moments before. Not too long after that, I was back to using chopsticks like I was born with a pair in my hand(rather than the phone my Mom always said accompanied me out of the womb. Sounds like a painful delivery to me! *SMILE*).

       This is the second of two posts I had written in a previous blog of a different name.  It was written in November of 2003.   A friend in Australia just received a package I sent him that had a panoramic photo of my apartment enclosed. One of the things that caught his eye is a Chinese symbol I have on my wall:  CHAOS ~ WHERE GREAT DREAMS BEGIN Before a great vision can become reality there may be difficulty. Before a person begins a great endeavor, they may encounter chaos. As a new plant breaks the ground with great difficulty, foreshadowing the huge tree, so must we sometimes push against difficulty in bringing forth dreams. "Out of Chaos, Brilliant Stars Are Born" I-Ching Hexagram #3 urlLink    Chaos...yea, that adequately describes my life most days. *smile*  Change is the only constant in anyone's life, and in as much every person lives in a state of chaos. The degree of chaos, of course, is negotiable.  And so...I seek my bliss.  For many years, I've beat myself up because I've harshly judged myself by my weaknesses rather than by my strengths. I never once considered the opposite...that perhaps nothing was wrong at all. I was simply looking in the wrong direction

       Finally....a moment to breathe!   The first thing I need to do is make a correction to the previous posts.  I started out weighing 228 pounds...not 221 pounds.  How do I know this?  Well, I was a bit suspicious about the scale reading.  When I picked up my cat Frank...who is a good 12 pounds of lean, purring kitty machine, I *still* weighed 221 pounds.  I had just bought this scale before the trip to Australia.  WHen I explained my problem to the people at Bed, Bath, and Beyond, the lady at the customer service counter wondered why I wasn't keeping the scale.  What woman wouldn't want to see a lower weight than she *actually* is?  Not I.  I need to know exactly where I am and where I am going.  I traded in that fancy-schmancy digital scale for the old-fashioned spring wound scale.  Now, having gone through all that with you, I am happy to announce that I have lost eight pounds and am down to 220 pounds!  75 pounds more to go before I get to my goal weight of 145 pounds!  WOO HOO!  How am I going about losing this weight?  The Atkins Diet.  Let me head off any criticism about health issues or that the Atkins Diet is a fad.  For those of you out there who do not know this, I have an endocrinological problem called Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS).  Without getting too technical here, I have a hormonal imbalance which causes my body to not process insulin and carbohydrates properly.  One of the ways of allieviating the symptoms is to eat a high protein/low carb diet.  I have been advised by doctors through the years that I should follow such a eating plan.  Easily said.  Not easily done .  You are talking to a woman who has a *SWEET* tooth, LOVES bread, could eat pasta morning, noon, and night...at one point or another, I've been best friends with most kinds of junk food out there.  I am a carb junkie.  The nice thing about eating a low carb diet these days is that there are *so* many new products designed with the Atkins Diet in mind.  For example...I have peanut butter, cheesecake, and german chocolate icream in the freezer by Carbolite...all of which have 1 net carb and 14 calories per ounce.  If I am PMS-ing...I can eat a pint of this stuff and not feel guilty! :)  Not that I would do that...without the 0 carb chocolate syrup I saw at the health food store! *SMILE*  Seriously...I have alternative foods which have a *different* taste, some foods taste and are just as good as the carb-laden ones.  I have my moments when I miss particular things...but not often.  I have found most anything I ate before has a substitute somewhere...if I look hard enough for it.  I can literally have my cake and eat it too.  I'm just winding down from an evening of cooking some Atkins friendly food.    I only cook like this every so often...as when I cook, I use a lot of dishes.  The one chore I have disliked with a passion all my life?  You guessed it...doing the dishes.   Note to self...next apartment will have a dishwasher...   I made lemon-poppyseed muffins, chocolate chip muffins, and cranberry-orange muffins for breakfasts on the run (I have never been a breakfast eater...because I can't be bothered by the effort.  I don't drink milk anymore...and if I don't have soy milk in the fridge, I don't bother with cereal).  I also made dinner for tomorrow...blackened chicken in a spicy lemon sauce.  I plan to drizzle the sauce over lettuce and have myself one fine chicken salad for dinner tomorrow!  No siree!  I am not deprived in any way whatsoever! :)  Enough about weight and food for now.  I have a few more things to relate...later.    Love to all!  Michelle   "You could not be more incorrect, I am very much a team player.

       Sorry for the wait folks...   Hello everyone!  My apologies here.  I have been incredibly busy trying to get back into the swing of things...that I had to postpone the start of my 'New And Improved Healthier Lyfestyle".    Since I've returned, I have had *so* much to catch up with.    I started the Atkin's Diet on Monday at 221 pounds, with a goal to reach 140 pounds through healthier eating and exercise.  As it stands right now, I am writing this at 2:20AM, and am about to head off to sleep.  I promise I will share my wit, or lack thereof in addition to talking about how I am doing with my 'healthier lifestyle' after I've had a few good night's sleep.    G'night.  Zzzzz...

       Eager, aren't 'cha!  That's what I like about you!   Hey!  It's nice that you are so eager to check out what I have to say...but I'm not ready yet!  I am starting my weight loss plan/exercise after Easter Sunday.  It's not just that I want to have my 'Last Supper', so to speak (Bad pun...I'm sorry.  Couldn't help myself.  They are the only puns I'm good at!).  I only just got home from my Australia trip, and I desperately need to go out and do some grocery shopping!  I need a little time to plan and prepare.  So...feel free to start reading about how I work towards my weight loss goal, strengthening my back, and looking like a total babe as I work towards a healthier lifestyle starting on April 12, 2004.  See you then!  Michelle    "The men the American people admire most extravagantly are the most daring liars; the men they detest most violently are those who try to tell them the truth."  - H.L.

       THANK GOD FOR BLESSED CHEMICALS!!!!   Whomever invented calorie free, carb free, sugar free chocolate syrup...   THANK YOU!!!   Of course, it doesn't taste like melted milk chocolate...but for a woman *trying* to stick to the Atkin's Diet...these sorts of substitutes really help! :)  I also picked up Carb Solutions (?) Butter Pecan icecream.  Yummy!  I have been doing pretty good at sticking to this...but I have to admit to cheating today.  It's not *so* bad.  I ate 1/4 a watermelon (about 2 pounds worth), a mango, a banana, and some of the ice cream for dinner.  Come on now...my *cheating* was actually pretty healthy.  If you consider I made it through two hours of Yoga and water aerobics alive, I'd say I deserved the treat! :)  The other comment about chemicals...  Allegra-D was not doing crap for my allergies.  I found something at the dollar store...while not a complete cure-all, has helped to some extent.  I'll be relieved when all the leaves have sprung out of their buds...'cause then I'll be able to stop hacking my lungs out.  Bleeping allergies.  Drug suggestions are welcomed (legal drugs, thank you very much! :) )If I did not make that specific enough...I'm talking about medicine to alleviate allergies. :) I barely have a grip on my life as it is sometimes.  I'd never be able to make it through the day if I wandered over to the illicit side of the street!  More comments...  I watched Kill Bill Volume 1 on video tonight.  You know...I think I'll wait for Volume 2 to come out on video.  Why?  I *really* liked Kill Bill Volume 1...but DAMN!  All the gratuitous violence!  I was getting bored watching the slaughter.  Aside from the fact that Quentin Tarrantino is a cinematic genius...I simply did not have the attention span to watch all the blood and gore...not matter how over the top it was.  Yoga Class.  Kicked my ass.  I hardly moved.  That was the problem.  My muscles are *so* tight, I can hardly move at all.  I will work through this.  Six classes a week will get me through and hopefully help me to not only be able to stretch and use muscles I have injured and not used in ages...but also help me strengthen my back.  I also had a chiropractic appointment, a massage on a CERAGEM table, and I sat in a massage chair at my chiropractors office.  I also did the aqua aerobics.  I think, had I not done the combination...it might hurt more.  Heck, it might hurt more when I wake up in the morning...and go to my next Yoga class. ;-)  I would sit and chat...but it's late.  I've just finished the movie...and I really need to get some sleep.  More on life (not dieting...for a change)later.

       Fallin' Off The Wagon...   Perhaps my dreams portended a soon-to-be reality?  I ate junk food for the first time in three weeks.  Why?  I mean, I was doing so well...right?  Well..my car was recently repaired...at a cost of approximately $500.  I picked up my car on Thursday.  The 'repairs' lasted two days.  Speak of being stressed!  Were it not for the fact I remembered what the guy from AAA did the last time this happened, I wouldn't have made it to Lansing to celebrate Mother's Day with my family.  Saturday, when I realized that I couldn't get my car out of park, the turn signals were not working, as well as the heater blower, the A/C and the cruise control...I was  stressing out.  Five hundred dollars is a lot of money to me right now.  I've just come back from a trip to Australia, which was expensive in and of itself...even with winning the round-trip airfare.  My budget is *so* tight right now, I know where my money is going, to the penny for the next three months.  There is no budget for anything extra.  It all goes to bills.  The thought of another expensive car repair, the thought of putting more money into my car... was just too much for me to contemplate at that moment.   (Note: I had a $400 car repair that I paid two days after returning from Australia.  This car repair, unrelated to the aforementioned repair, happened three days later.  Basically, I spent $900 within a week of my return.  You can understand why I am stressing right now...)  So...I reintroduced myself to two of my best friends...Krispy Kreme and Little Debbie.  One Krispy Kreme and three Little Debbie snack cakes later, I arrived at my brother's house in Lansing.  My stomach was already feeling crappy from all the sugary stuff I'd already consumed.  Lo' and behold...Keith's home is junk food nirvana.  Keith and Terri made certain to let me know where all the junk food in the house could be found.  They also plied me with Margaritas (Thanks! I definitely appreciated the Margaritas!)  Mother's Day was better food-wise.  I ate healthier...but did not stick to my diet.  I hadn't planned to, actually.  Relaxing the rules on Mother's Day was a treat to myself after having lost (at that point) 14 pounds.  The funny thing is...I had lost my taste for all the junky things I ate while in Lansing.  It was more for emotional comfort than taste...and in regards to emotional comfort...eating all that sugar did nothing but give me a bit of a guilt complex...and a very upset stomach.  Also, none of what I ate tasted good.  I'd lost my sweet tooth.  What really made my mouth water was some watermelon I ate on Mother's Day, this really good cucumber dish Keith and Terri brought, a nice salad Stacy had prepared...all good, healthy things.  A pint of strawberries does more for me at this moment than cookies or cakes... : )  They say the Atkin's Diet takes away your cravings for sweets and breads.  I'd have to agree with that.  I'm back to eating healthy.  Everybody slips on occasion.  What matters is to never stop trying. :)  As for my car...I'll keep you updated.    Michelle  P.S.  Life *is* wonderful. ;) I'm just stressing at the moment.  I started college again this week, am worried about the car issues I seem to be having, and I have a few other things on my plate at the moment.  It's been a while since I've been this busy and had to juggle so much...   "If only God would give me some clear sign!

       I'll Be Dreaming...   I've always had vivid dreams.  My dreams are in color.  The ones I remember have linear plots to them.  I can smell in my dreams.  I can taste what I eat in my dreams.  This is where things get a bit bizarre...  In my dreams...I'm cheating on my diet!  It's hilarious!  In one of them, I told myself it was okay to have a luscious piece of chocolate cake with chocolate frosting...just this once.    Now...I know I am not 'sleep eating', because I don't keep junk food in my apartment.  I simply do not have the will power to stay away from the junky stuff...so why keep it in my apartment?  Is the 'sleep-cheating' helping me stick to my diet?  No clue...but if my subconscious wants to nibble on all sorts of goodies...I'm not going to stop it from doing so!  Now that I've been at this for three weeks, I rarely have the urges for sweet stuff.  When I do, I go grab a bit of the low carb ice cream or something else that seems sinful but is within the low carb realm.  I don't have much to add at the moment.  I start my college classes on Monday.  I'll be exercising five days a week through the college, and walkling on my own.  Hopefully I'll get toned and the weight will melt off!  I'm doing my first voice-over today where I do a bit of singing. I'll let you all know if the client buys into it...and send out a copy if it is aired on radio or television.  Love to all!

       It's A Beautiful Day!   The weather outside is lovely!  I was waiting until the weather warmed up a bit to start walking.  i guess I don't have any excuseto to not go for a walk today!  Regarding yesterday's post...    I am taking Yoga four days a week, twice a day on Wednesday and Friday.  I am taking an aqua fitness class on Monday's and Wednesday's.  I am going to get in the habit of walking 30-60 minutes a day.    I'm hoping that combining that with physical therapy three times a week, that I will have my back pain under control.  My goal is to return to work at the beginning of September.   I had maintained a weight of 190 for almost two years...and then sometime starting around November, when I was trying to lose weight for my trip to Australia, I managed to gain forty pounds.  How?  I got lazy and was either eating out or eating out of boxes and cans.  I was definitely junk food queen there for a while.  One of the nice things about working on weight loss is that I am forced to eat healthier...  For me, this means that I am cooking for myself again.  I had gotten out of the habit. I love to cook...but with no dishwasher here...and the effort of cooking just for myself...  Not that I mind...but I got out of the habit.  What more can I say.  I realized just how much I missed cooking when staying at Neil's house while vacationing in Australia.  Neil didn't want me to have to 'work' on cooking...until he realized I think cooking is fun!  Of course, cooking is a lot more fun when there is a dishwasher around...and I don't have to do the dishes. ;-)  This past week, I've made fried eggplant, lemon roasted chicken, chicken roasted in teriyaki sauce, chicken roasted in italian seasoning/sauce, and chicken roasted in salsa.  Why chicken?  Well...I'd thawed a bit too much chicken.  I've blanched and frozen broccoli, and I have enough sliced radish, cucumber, and celery to keep a rabbit in heaven. ;-)  I've made low-carb tacos...and don't forget about the cooking I mentioned in one of my earlier blogs.  Yummy!  Time for me to run off for my free massage at Ceragem. :)  Then I'll be off for my walk. :)  Later!

       Next Week Is The Kick-Off!!!   What do I mean by that?  The Summer/Spring semester starts next week.  I'm only taking exercise classes, and will be exercising 1-2 times a day through the college.    I didn't want to start a diet AND exercise at the same time.  I thought it would be a good idea to start one...make it a habit and THEN start the other.  Why get overwhelmed and set myself up for failure?  It's not easy to establish new habits.  It takes about three weeks of participating in an activity before it becomes ingrained into your psyche.  I'll talk about this more tomorrow.  The Red Wings are playing against Calgary...and the game is in overtime.   GO WINGS!!!

       FRUSTRATION!!!!   No...not about my weight.  I bought a Nike jacket to wear while I am out walking from a thrift store (ever the bargain hunter!).  I see no need to spend $45 - $50 for something I am going to sweat in.  I mean, I am only out wearing it when I am walking...not to the runways of Paris...right?  Don't take that to mean the jacket does not look nice.  It's sharp.  It doesn't look bad on me.  The problem was that it does not have any of the reflective thingies on it to help me be better seen at dawn/dusk/nightime hours.  I am a crafty sort of person.  I can sew.  It wouldn't be difficult to find ribbon with reflective material on it and sew it on the jacket...right?  Wrong.    I went to at least five fabric stores, including one of the most awesome fabric stores in Michigan, Habermans in downtown Royal Oak.  Not one store had what I was looking for.  Walmart, on the other hand, was selling two three inch strips of fabric packaged together...for .97 cents.  I was looking for at least a yard or so of the material.  What to do?  I'm thrifty, crafty (in a creative way), and also resourceful(thanks to my Dad).  I went to Meijer, bought a roll of reflective tape that you use for marking mail boxes, metal, other outdoor items.  I also bought a roll of velcro.  I stuck the reflective bit to one side of velcro and trimmed it, attached the other bit of velcro to the jacket with staples (I *tried* sewing it on...but the adhesive on the velcro made it impossible), and voila!  I have exactly what I want!  In retrospect, I might have gone back to a craft store and bought a different kind of velcro...but I just wanted to get the reflective tape on so I can get out and walk...*NOW*...with some peace of mind that I won't become roadkill.  What if I said a 10lb. loss is equal to losing 4 1/2 inches from various measurements around my body?  Damn it all if two of those bleeping inches weren't from my breasts!  I know that you lost weight there first...but I'd rather lose 2 inches from my butt than my breasts.  I don't have much on top...and I'd rather not lose it!  LOL!  Seriously...I can live with a little less boob...as long as I have a lot less tush...and am not left flat as a board!    To be honest...I was not 100% faithful to the Atkins Diet these past two weeks.  I actually went off it for a few days, indulged, and then made the commitment to do this...and do it right.  I stopped journalling what I was eating (which is recommended so you can keep track of what you are eating, learn proper portions, count carbs, etc...,.).  Am I doing 20 carbs a day?  That depends on whether you are counting net carbs (Total carb count minus fiber and alcohol sugars=net carbs), which is now recommended by Atkins, or total carbs, meaning adding up the listed carbs (minus fiber) as listed on the nutritional label.  Let's just say that this is working for me...and as of yet, I am not feeling at all deprived.  I'll keep ya'll updated.  In the meantime, it's time for me to call it a night.  Later!

      Deep breath in.......  Deep breath out......   Today was a bad day.   So...to help bring me back to my 'Happy Place', I went mulberry picking.   *SMILE*   I remember going to my Grandma Marlow's back yard when I was a little girl, and picking berries off the tree in her yard. I'd pick up enough for a pie, but more often than not, the skin around my mouth would be stained purple. My feet would be so completely colored with the juice of fallen mulberries (on the ground)&nbsp;I'd crushed with my feet, that it would take a good week of scrubbing to get rid of the stain.   My parents have a mulberry tree near their house. last year, my Dad and I went down and picked berries together for a couple hours.&nbsp; This year, I didn't get to that tree.&nbsp; Rather, I went to my girlfriend's apartment and plucked them off her tree.&nbsp; They were *so* incredibly ripe, it was almost like an explosion of sugar on my tongue when eating them.   *SMILE*   The other thing I did...was get to something I'd been putting off.&nbsp; What was that?&nbsp; Well, I've started to transfer my CD's to the computer.&nbsp; I don't see a reason to keep individual CD's when I can transfer everything to the computer, and convert the music to mp3's.&nbsp; I can burn about 130 mp3's to a CD-R and carry that with me...rather than five or six CD's.&nbsp; I did this when I went to Australia, actually.&nbsp; I carried four CD-R's with me...&nbsp;as the CD player carrier had four slots for CD's...which means I had at least 520 songs to choose from during the month I was overseas.&nbsp; Perhaps that was a little bit overkill...but it was nice to have the variety of choice at my fingertips.&nbsp; *SMILE*   That is something that makes me happy...helps me find and keep my 'Zen'...music.&nbsp; I love music.&nbsp; I've loved it ever since I can remember.&nbsp; My earliest memories...?&nbsp; Dad taking me to a radio station with him that had records all over the floor (he was running for office, had to cut a commercial, and the radio station, if I remember correctly, was in a single-wide mobile home.&nbsp; This goes back, to the *early* 70's, perhaps 1975...when I was four years old).&nbsp; I remember watching old movies with Gene Kelly, Judy Garland, Julie Andrews, and other musicals.&nbsp; I had my radio tuned into a classical radio station...and refused to listen to that 'rock' stuff I'd heard about...but eventually worked my way in that direction after listening to Country, and then Pop/Soft Rock.   I could go on and on...but I won't.&nbsp; I will say this...&nbsp; Some people need expensive toys,&nbsp; I *need* music.&nbsp; I could live without my television, (GASP!) high-speed internet, and even my computer.&nbsp; I would never want there to be a day in my life without music.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I simply do not know how to describe just how much I love music, be it listening to it...or singing (though I do not often sing for others...as I have stage-fright issues...). When I listen to music, my soul silently sings along.&nbsp; I feel more free.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can truly say that listening to the music I love makes&nbsp;me feel happier than I might be&nbsp;without having listened at all.  &nbsp;- Michelle&nbsp;  "It's the simple things of life that make living worthwhile." --Laura Ingalls Wilder

       urlLink Sex Shop Canada: Batteries   All I can say is "OH MY GOD!!!"  Little did I know that my funny little quote about what happened years ago with Mom would be used to advertise batteries on an internet sex shop site!  Even funnier is that the site is advertising the cheap panasonic batteries that you can buy in a dollar store...rather than the Energizer or Duracell batteries that my quote referred to!  Perhaps I should make my first submission to "This American Life" about the life a phrase I submitted to an online list has taken on a life of it's own...?   Quote me as saying I was mis-quoted.  -- Groucho Marx

      Months ago, I received a link protesting a possible increase of taxes on malt beverages.  I filled in my personal information, hit the 'submit' button, and thought nothing more of it.  I submitted the form because I believe raising taxes on alcohol is not fair.    (I'm not a big drinker.  I can count on my fingers how many alcoholic drinks I've had in the past two years.  I simply do not support a tax increase that is solely for the purpose of increasing tax revenues without an attached program that provides for education and cessation.)   I have just spent the better part of an hour frantically making calls to my state representative, my congressman, and a representative of GOOGLE in regards to the letter I submitted.  Why?  The form letter I submitted is on a government web site.  It links my home address, e-mail address, and name together...information I have been very protective of.  I don't mind my e-mail address and name being posted on the internet.  My home address is another matter.  A few years ago, I had a problem with being stalked.  Since then, I have become uber-sensitive about anyone being able to get my home address or phone number without my knowlege.  I would never have submitted that form if I thought my home address would be posted on the internet.  A representative from my congressman's office is working on this and will let me know what he is able to do.  Fingers crossed, my home address will be off the internet sometime tomorrow.

      Reading my journal was definitely an interesting experience.  You could say it was even a bit of a learning experience.  There were aspects of myself that I'd forgotten about that I really admire and like...certain perspectives that became 'temporarily misplaced' after I became involved with my ex-fiance, Stuart in the early 90's.  I enjoyed reading about my experience back in 1989 at Camp Miniwanca while attending the American Youth Foundation's National Leadership Conference.  Both that and the bolo tie I just came across when going through some old things brought back wonderful memories.  On the first day of camp, we were told that we could be whoever we wanted to be.  If we didn't like our name, we could change our name to something different for the duration of camp if we wanted to.  Well, 'Michelle' was a bit of a long name to fit in...and I was in a playful mood.  Instead of writing my name in, I wrote in, "?", a question mark.  All the kids thought it was cool, and many said it was a great way to get to know people...because it would pique someone's curiosity and they would want to know the story behind it...  I vaguely remember some of the adults were not happy and told me I could not have that on my bolo.  So...I think I may have added another bit with my name on top.  I don't know.  By that time though, the "?" had made a bit of an impression. :)  I wrote about how beautiful Miniwanca is.  It is one of the most beautiful, quiet, peaceful places I've ever been to.  I have not been back that way in about six or seven years...so perhaps I might go this year and rent a cabin some weekend...or camp out on the beach.  I digress...  My mind is wandering a bit...  Anyway, I wrote about a little bit about Ned.  I've mentioned him in a few previous blogs here.  I wrote quite a bit...all complimentary.  I had a crush on him...I had it pretty bad. :)  I was so young and naive that I wouldn't admit to myself that I was in serious crush mode.  *SMILE*  I wrote that when I met him, it was dark...I couldn't see him but that I liked the sound of his voice.  LOL!  That we made moccasins together  We each ended up having a moccasin that belonged to the other.  Why?  Ned and I attempted to exchange moccasins.  Each time he had mine in hand, I'd left his back at the cabin.  Finally, we missed so many times trying to exchange moccasins that we decided in the end that we would keep the other's moccasin and have something to remind ourselves of each other. :)  In reading back through some of what I wrote, I'm embarassed, actually.  Oh, to be eighteen and stupid again! ;-)  I was so naive, and I knew *nothing* of the ways of the world, men and the whatnot. That's what I get for having a Mom (she *is* wonderful) who initially wanted to be a nun when she was younger, and was incredibly overprotective when it came to her children.  *SMILE*    Miniwanca was the very first time...I became spellbound while watching a guy play basketball.  I was at Upper Tipi when I looked down at the basketball court.  I wrote about my surprise at my reaction...that I couldn't tear my eyes away from the sight...hairy chest, semi-muscular, great gams, sweat and all.  Ooo la la!  Teenage hormones, baby!  That's bad.  *SMILE*  I should have written cheesy romance novels or something.  That is just *way* bad.    ***LAUGHTER***    My friend Beverly and I were talking about...ummm...appreciation of the male form a few days back.  She sent me an instant message with a drooling smiley and wrote, "Mmmm...half naked, hairy, sweaty men..."  ***CHUCKLE***  Mind back on track...out of the gutter...  *SMILE*  Enough about Ned and Miniwanca.  What I wrote above is the last I will write about him.  If he receives the photo taken of Harry and himself on the beach, I hope it brings back a fond memory or two back to him of his time there.  If Ned reads any of these entries, hopefully he will see I'm just reflecting on fond memories and not be too offended or embarassed.    It's not like anyone really reads this anyway.  I am such a lucky person...to have written about the things I did when I was younger.  To have good, though sometimes embarrassing memories written that I can go back and read...and to have such good friends in my life, I am blessed. :)    I don't talk about it much, but I was in an accident and incurred a head-injury back in 1993.  I'm not bothered by it or ashamed...it's just not something I often think about.    That is one of the reasons I found it interesting to go through my journal entries and letters I'd saved over the years.  I received a 'Dear Jane' letter from a man who had loved me, but had fallen in love with someone else.  Now, this guy thought I was so important to him that he would try to let me down gently in this letter.    I have no idea who the hell is.  As much as I try, I simply can not remember him.    There are a few other stories along these lines.   I am very lucky that I was not too greatly affected.  For a couple of weeks after the accident, I needed assistance when walking.  I could not remember how to spell, and it took me about thirty minutes to read five pages (my ability to speed-read returned after a few months).  I suffered severe migranes for about five years.  My short-term memory was shot for the longest time.  It took me a few years to regain my ability to remember numbers for more than a few seconds.  In college, I took science classes to substitute for the math prerequisite because I am still not able to retain mathematical equations.  There are people whom I run into on occasion who know me, and I have no idea who they are.  Then again, you don't remember every single person you meet in your life.  I do have the blessing, or curse pending on perspective, of being 'memorable'.    Are there any lasting effects from the accident?  Not really.  My intelligence, my wit, my sense of humor, they are still here.  Sometimes, it simply takes me a bit longer.  I'm getting older...and can start to blame this on age...  *SMILE*   "They may forget what you said, but they will never forget how you made them feel."  -Carl W. Buechner

      I found this quote on my computer.     I'm not a conventional woman.  I'm complicated.  I'm eclectic and quirky...in ways that are good...just not in ways that are accepted in conventional thought and wisdom.  - Michelle Landry (?)   I did a web search, and could not find it.  I can only assume I wrote it and forgot about it (it's not the first time that's has happened).  It does fit me.  I said in the previous blog that I was going to "find a quote for my Yahoo signature line that strikes a chord within me".  I did...thanks to Jackson Browne and Neil Young.  I love music.  Most any music.  One of my favorite things to do is to crank the radio up (to a reasonable level...not glass-shaking loud), and sing while I am driving.  I might look like a lunatic, but I'm having the time of my life!  Writing that reminds me of back when I was a morning show producer...  I got in much earlier that anyone else...and would crank up the studio monitor so I could rock to the oldies!  Sometimes I'll listen to music...be it a particular song, or something in the way the music is interpreted...or a partiuclar chord/harmony sounds...and I get chills.  It's a wonderful feeling.  I highly recommending it.  I thought a music quote would be nice for a few months.     ""After silence, that which comes nearest to expressing the inexpressible is music."

      DAMN!  Years ago, I was a member of an online list called "Top Five".  I don't really remember what it was all about, but I submitted a quote to them.  Mom was nagging me about meeting a nice guy and getting married.  I got frustrated, and was...ummm... a little blunt with her.  The 'Top Five' list let you submit quotes.  I took what I said to Mom and submitted it for a competition, or something of the sort.  I had forgotten about this until recently.  In doing a web search on my name (there are *zillions* of Michelle Landry's out there...it's a good French-Canadian name...), I saw the quote...and was amused.  I like to include quotes on my blogs that are in some way related to what I am writing about.  In the blog where I talk about the possibility of dating...I thought I might try to find a funny quote.  I found a page with dating quotes on it.  Someone liked *my* little quote *so* much, that it was included on the following web page!  *LAUGHTER*  http://www.dating-tips-advice.com/quotes/dating.html  Here is the quote...   "My mom always complains about my lack of a boyfriend. Well, next time she asks, I'm going to tell her I'm dating two different guys : Mr. Duracell and Mr. Energizer. -- Michelle Landry"   I think it's funny how something I said in jest is still around, circulating in places all over the internet.  I do.  And that other people have such a sense of humor that they find it funny enough to post on various pages all over the internet?  Well...at least I know there are a few people out there that 'get' what little bit of humor I have. *SMILE*  My Uncle Steve really ripped into me the other day.  I sent out a few e-mails regarding the party for Mom and Dad.  Through Yahoo's e-mail options, I use my signature line to send a quote out at the end of every e-mail.  It's an automatic sort of thing.  I don't have to type it in every time.  I forget about it for a few months until I run across another quote I like...and then replace the old quote with a new one.  Anyway, the following quote from 'Sex In The City', really set him off.   "Well, maybe it’s time to be clear about who I am. I am someone who is looking for love. Real love. Ridiculous, inconvenient, consuming, can’t live without each other love."  - Carrie Bradshaw, Sex And The City     I put this quote up ages ago because I thought it reflected what I would like someday when it comes to being in love with someone else.  Let me give you an example...  I introduced my friends Scott and Tanya, who known each other for fifteen years and have been married for twelve years.  They have that kind of love.  It's beautiful to see them together...though sometimes I tease them about them being so much in love after all these years that it's sickening. Of course they know I am teasing.  *SMILE*    Uncle Steve is quite a private person, and thinks it is inappropriate that this quote goes out with every e-mail I send out (that is how the option in Yahoo is set up). I'm not changing the quote that goes out with my e-mail because of what Uncle Steve said.  He does have a point.  If I send an e-mail from my Yahoo address to, let say someone in the voice-over business...it's not going to look very professional.    Further,I cringe when I think about something I recently did.  I sent an e-mail to someone I knew briefly about fifteen years ago.  Mainly out of curiosity about how he was doing...and amazed that he looks very much like my close friend Bob, a man I've known for over thirteen years and used to be involved with.  I'm almost embarassed at what this man might think...receiving an e-mail from some woman he barely remembers...with this quote tacked on the end of it.    Nothing I can do about it now, beyond hope the person in question does not think I am a lunatic.    So...I need to find a new quote to put at the end of my Yahoo e-mails.  It's been about three months since I last changed it.  I am about due for a new one.  I'm off to find a quote for my Yahoo signature line that strikes a chord within me.  The search is on...   "People only see what they are prepared to see."  -Ralph Waldo Emerson

      I'm the sort of person who believes everything happens for a reason...even if we don't know what the reason is at that particular time.  It's a matter of synchronicity.  Meaningful coincidence that defies probablilty.  Or...you can call it a little help from above.  Whatever you choose. *SMILE*  What is synchronicity?   "Synchronicity can be defined as a non-causal but meaningful relationship between events or states of mind within the human psyche and events in the outside world. More simply, we could call it the experiences of "meaningful coincidence". We have all had experiences that we intuitively recognize as meaningful, though we would be hard pressed to explain them in rational terms. In fact, these "meaningful coincidences" are not coincidences at all but spontaneous realizations of the underlying interconnectedness of all things within the Universe."   - Laurence Boldt, Tao of Abundance   Carl Jung wrote about the principles of synchronicity.  Jung believed that many, but not all 'meaningful coincidences' were not a matter of a common chance event, but rather, and this is going to sound a little 'new-agey' here, the inner-connectivity within the universe causing an alignment allowing for the event or circumstance to occur.  Let me make a case for the theory of synchronicity on a level that sounds a little less 'New Age', and based a bit more in scientific fact.  As I never studied Quantum Physics, I'm going to refer to a particular web site which explains the concept of synchronicity with brief mention of synchronicity in relation to physics.    http://www.viewzone.com/synchronicity.html In physics, we are taught that every single particle in the universe has a gravitational effect upon every other particle, no matter how far the particles are separated. This unified effect supports the theories that all events are related, in some way, to each other. Thus it can be said that synchronicity is merely a very personal and subjective observation of this inter-connected universe of which we are but a small part.     Another good article to read about Synchronicity and it's relation to quantum physics is: http://twm.co.nz/ISSS_synchr.html  Some people who believe in their religion's version of God might believe synchronicity is a tool of the New Age movement to try to discount that relationship between God and oneself.  For prople who might feel that way, I offer you the following quote:   "Synchronicity isn't just proof of the existence of God. It's also proof of God's concern for and involvement with you."  - Bayard    Now, as I am not writing a paper on Humanism, Quantum Physics, or Synchronicity...I'm not going to delve any deeper into theory and definition.  I'm not in the mood to think so much that my brain hurts. *SMILE*  Moving on...  There have been many synchronistic events in my life that might make one go, "Hmm..."  Some examples?  I'll give you a few of my favorites.  1.)   While working at one radio station back in 1995, I set up a 'business' e-mail address under my radio name.  In 1997, I received an e-mail from a woman desperately looking for her family, as she needed a bone marrow transplant.  As a last resort in searching for a family she had never known, she e-mailed over two hundred people with the last name of 'Daniels' (I had used Daniels as a last name when on-air) trying to find her possible birth father's family.  I wrote her back, advising I was not related, but would see what I could do to help. Two days later, I put her in touch with her birth father's family.   2.)   I had set aside a couple thousand dollars to go to Australia.  Shortly before purchasing my ticket, I found that my car needed major car repairs.  There went the money I had set aside.  About a month later, I saw an online contest that a radio station was sponsoring for a free trip for two to Australia.  It required a written essay.  While I might be a good writer, I wasn't in the mood to sit and think about writing an essay.  I don't write essays for the fun of it.  I left the web site on my computer for two days.  It was niggling at me, so I figured, "What the heck!"  I decided to sit down and write an essay.  When I received a call that I was one of five finalists out of thousands of entries, I just *knew* I had won.  The final selection was a week later...and I was right.  I'd won a trip to Australia.  Interestingly enough, the format of the station that picked me is top 40 and urban rock.  My essay was about Barry Manilow...whom some people think is incredibly uncool.  Barry Manilow DEFINITELY does not fit that station's format.    Mind you, I would have gone to Australia had I not won the trip.  Winning the trip saved me from a seven month diet of ramen noodles and peanut butter.  *SMILE*   3.    My parents had an injured bird in their back yard...so I did a bit of research on the internet...and found a wildlife rehabilitator about an hour North of Lapeer (about 1 1/2 hours away from where I live in the Metro Detroit area).  With the exception of the twenty-nine mosquito bites I have (I called my friend Bob up and said to him, "Baby, I have an itch *you* can scratch.  As a matter of fact, there are twenty-nine of them!")...I had a lovely time.  I saw baby and injured animals up close (owls, a baby crow, raccoons, deer, etc...,.).  There were so many animals, I can't remember them all.  Anyway...  The bird I brought in had to be put down.  It's beak was cracked in two places, it's jaw was dislocated, it had a broken wing, and it may have had an infection from all it's injuries.  In trying to find a avian veterinarian, Theresa (one of the two women who run the animal rehabilitation sanctuary I visited) went to a vet she'd never been to before.  He advised her of a vet who treats wildlife for free, gave her invaluable advise on formulas and treatments, and how to deal with certain animals.  This advice will ultimately save her thousands of dollars.  *SMILE*      4.)   I attended 'THE SWAN' tryouts, in large part to observe people and do research for a screenplay I am working on.  I'm also working on organizing a surprise party for my parents 40th Anniversary.  I had not looked at my journals in years.  So, it was killing two birds with one stone, to read through everything I'd written to use as fodder for 'THE SWAN' application as well as items I might be able to use in a PowerPoint presentation I want to make for my parents' party (pending how much time I have available).  It was interesting reading through all my old journals.  I read something I'd written about this guy I'd had a crush on while at camp.  Back in 1989, I had written that Ned asked me to write him after I requested he send me a copy of the music used in our music class.  I wrote a few letters, and when I didn't receive a response, I gave up.  Just when I had given up...he sent me one letter.  Ned wrote, "Have more faith..." (I suppose a 32 year-old man would be a bit apprehensive around a young woman of eighteen with a crush, much less maintain a correspondence with her. *SMILE*)  After 'THE SWAN' auditions were finished, while comforting one of the women who did not get chosen (a group of us went out for coffee so Rose could calm down enough to make the six hour drive home), I walked past a customized Michigan license plate that said, "HVFAITH".   ***INSERT EERIE MUSIC...PERHAPS TWILIGHT ZONE THEME???***   5)  The year I was living in Maryland, I had a hold put on my mail while I was in England.  When I returned from a trip and was at the post office picking up my mail, I had a *very* nauseous feeling.  I don't know how to explain it beyond the fact I suddenly felt ill and very anxious.  I had received two Christmas cards, one from my friend Brian Collins, and the other from another camp friend, Todd Bundy.  I opened Brian's card first.  He told me about how he loved his job at the hospital he was working at, how he had met a beautiful woman, and wished me a wonderful Christmas.  The sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach intensified when I picked up Todd's card.  I remember this like it was yesterday.  I opened Todd's card to the news that Brian had been murdered on Christmas Eve.     On a side note, the following summer while on my way to a summer job in South Dakota, I made...umm...a side trip to St. Louis (I know that is kinda out of the way).  I wanted to go to the graveyard where Brian was buried and pay my respects.  I drove to St. Louis from Michigan in one day(I spent the night in Kansas City.  I actually got lost driving over the Mississippi River and was completely exhausted by the time I made it to bed).  It was late in the evening when I finally arrived, I got lost, and when I asked a police officer for directions, he advised me that the area was not safe after dark...that I should come back in the morning.  I had to be in South Dakota in two days...so I ended up leaving St. Louis without paying my respects at Brian's grave.  That bothered me back then, and I made a promise to myself then that I might someday go back and properly pay my respects.  If it doesn't cost as much as I am afraid it might to repair my car's transmission (struts, tune-up, and anything else I don't yet know about...as my car seems to know when I have extra money), I might make St. Louis one of the stops on the road trip I'd like to take.  The first, and really the only rule of synchronicity is that  there are no accidents .  All coincidences are connected by meaning, be it personal or otherwise.  I am not saying that this does not allow for practice of free will or that everything in life is predestined. Personally, I believe we might not know the purpose or reason at the time, but that many things, good or bad, happens for a reason.    Here is a personal example.  My essay was chosen out of thousands to win.  You had to write about the one thing in your life that you regretted having/not having done.  I'll abbreviate what my essay was about.  Years ago, I had the opportunity to sing with Barry Manilow on stage at the Fox Theatre.  Barry Manilow often chooses a member of his audience to join him on stage to sing a rendition of, "I Can't Smile Without You".  I was one of two women left standing, but the other woman started to sit down as she saw that Barry was motioning for me to join him on stage.  Stuart said to me, if I went up there, he would leave me in Detroit to find my own way home and our relationship would be over.  I was young, inexperienced in the way of relationships, and was afraid that I might not find a way home...so I sat down.  I deeply regretted having done so, because that signaled a change in the relationship and myself that was not healthy...and took me years to recover from.    Now remember, I was not going to enter the essay contest.  I love to write, but not if I *have* to, and certainly not about a topic as cheesy as regrets and what you would do if you could do things differently.  The station that awarded the prize is an 'Urban/Top 40' station.  Barry Manilow does not fall into their format, nor is he relevant to the age braket that the station and advertisers are aiming for.  Had the incident with Stuart not happened...  Two completely separate events, yet interconnected.  My mind doesn't boggles at the 'What if's...', though if I thought about all the meaningful coincidences that have occured in my life...it might.    Going back to Ned for a moment.  After having read about the wonderful time I had at Miniwanca, I had the urge to see what had become of Ned and a few other people I'd gone to camp with.  I have not yet found Cam Price or Todd Bundy.  I was able to find more information on Ned.  I did a bit of internet research and found that he is teaching at a school in Kansas.  I checked out the school's web site...and was dumbstruck when I saw what Ned looks like now.  He and Bob could be brothers!  (NOTE:  Bob and I were involved for a period of time.  We didn't work out...but love each other dearly and are the best of friends.) :)  It just amazed me...how similar they both look.  You could stick them in a room together and think they are related.  :)  Both are teachers.  Both play guitar, about the same height, with a two year difference in age.  I was so dumbstruck in the similarity of their appearances, that I e-mailed Bob and told him about his doppleganger.  When Bob saw the picture...his comment was, "Well, I dunno...I think I'm a little better looking."  ***LAUGHTER***  I think they are both good-looking.  What can I say...I've got good taste in men!  ***SMILE***  In this instance, I wouldn't say looking Ned up after all these years and seeing the resemblance between Ned and Bob is an act of synchronicity as much as it is a very weird coincidence.    I dropped Ned an e-mail....wasn't exactly sure what to say.  From what I wrote in my journal, I don't know if I would have made enough of an impression on Ned for him to remember me fifteen years later.  I am not sure what reaction I might get to the e-mail I sent him.  I let Ned know that he made quite an impression on an eighteen year-old way back when and wished him the best.  I don't know that Ned will respond.  I went back to the website and read that the last day for teachers was June 2nd.  I sent the e-mail on June 6th.  I have no idea if the e-mail will be waiting for him on his school computer when he returns or if he will read it and toss it.  I had a copy of a picture of Ned with a friend, and sent it to him in the mail.  I thought it would be a nice gesture.  I would be curious to speak with him...but if it does not happen...it's not the end of the world.  If anything, it was nice to take a trip down memory lane...and read about all the wonderful memories of camp.  My brain hurts.  Time to go back to writing cotton candy fluff.     "Seize the moment of excited curiosity on any subject to solve your doubts; for if you let it pass, the desire may never return, and you may remain in ignorance."  William Wirt (1772 - 1834)

      I went to Costco today...a bulk-buyers bargain dream!    My friend JoAnn buys these DELICIOUS sheet cakes *every* month, and told me that they are a steal...$14.99 for a cake that can feed 30-48, pending on the size of the cut.  I went in to see what was available to order...and walked out convinced that I need to get a membership there, if only for the purpose of buying food items for my parent's 40th anniversary party.  The selection and prices were heads above the different Sam's Club's I visit...  I am feeling less stressed right now.  With the exception of a few minor things, I now have all the supplies I need for the party (I'm talking about party supplies and decorations...not food).  I'll have the menu done by tomorrow...and can't really start anything food-wise until a week before the party.    I *know* the party will be lovely.  I simply want to surprise my parents, and give my Mom something better to remember...than the wilted white roses she carried down the aisle on her wedding day.  I'm ordering a bouquet of white roses for Mom...(when talking about her wedding, she always mentions how upset she was about her bouquet being wilted).  I've got to figure out a way to get Mom's wedding dress out of the house so I can put it on display...  A friend of mine who is an associate pastor will be there so Mom and Dad can renew their vows.    There is so much noise in my head right now about things I could do, need to do, should do.  As much fun as I am having...I will happy when this is all over.   "The goal of preparation is not knowing exactly where you’ll go, but being confident nonetheless that you’ll get there. This means that your attitude will be more important than your itinerary, and that the simple willingness to improvise is more vital in the long run than research." --Rolf Potts, Vagabonding (2003)

       urlLink    All this sperm and I didn't get preggers???  Thank you, Durex!  March 2004 Sydney, Australia  Copyright 2004   The above photo is one of my favorite photos from my time in Australia.  The guys above were handing out free condoms at Sydney's Gay & Lesbian Mardi Gras.  I just thought it would be a fun picture, and it was!   Back to what I'm writing about in this post...  I told myself, after returning from Australia, that I would take at least one weekend a month and 'get away from it all'.  That was in April.  Have I made any weekend trips anywhere???  No.  Of course, planning and purchasing for the party has made my budget a bit tight for anything too extravagant.  Before I go anywhere, I need to have the transmission serviced, a tune-up, and both sets of struts replaced.  That's about a thousand dollars right there.  *SIGH*  All the same, I've decided to make plans for a road trip.  It's been years since I went off on my own for a long, long drive.  I'm almost decided on what I am going to do and where I am going to go.  I simply have to call a few friends and see if they miss me enough to want to see me. *SMILE*  Mark and his wife live in Dallas.  Tiffany (who has already asked me to come and visit) lives in Denver.  My friend Sara lives a few hours outside of Memphis.  Finally...I could head down to New Mexico, visit my friend Richard, and if he wants me to...record some vocals for some of his instrumental compositions.  We were going to do something years ago...but I moved out of state, and we lost touch.  I'm itching to go visit Nashville and Memphis, to explore/learn more about the Blues and early Rock.  I'm thinking I might head to Tenessee first (Nashville and Memphis), head South to Dallas and visit Mark and his wife, West to New Mexico/Arizona to see the Grand Canyon and visit Righard, North to Colorado to see Tiffany,  drive through Kansas and stop in St. Louis to see the St. Louis Arch, before heading back to Michigan.  Alternately, I can drive up to Montreal, and on the way, spend a few days in Toronto.  I wonder what my budget will allow....  I also have time to consider...how much time I have between the end of the summer semester and the beginning of the fall semester.  Classes end on August 24th...but I don't doubt I can take the last week off...given that there are no exams in any of the classes I am taking.  Perhaps I could leave on August 14th and return on August 29th???  Keith and Terri wanted me to fly down to las Vegas and witness their wedding (with 'Elvis' officiating), but I'd much rather go on a road trip, seek out some kitsch-ish, cheezy road-side attractions, perhaps stay at some youth hostels and meet some of the international folk who stay there (I've found you *always* meet interesting people at youth hostels).   I think I'll worry about the menu for my parent's party first...and then plan the road trip. :)  (To be continued...)   "Schedule a day of rest every now and then. Contrary to what you might read, sudden insights seldom happen at the summit of a mountain, at the moment the whale is sighted, or in the face of some overwhelming bit of landscape. You haven't yet assimilated the experience. Look for epiphanies on those days when you're lying on your back, watching the ceiling fan push dust motes through a shaft of light falling through a grimy window. Exhaustion seldom engenders insight." --Tim Cahill, Hold the Enlightenment (2002)

      This is going to sound like the beginning line of a bad joke.  Let me state in advance I do not consider myself prejudiced.  I will be discussing a particular ethnic group and the experiences I've been having...  So I go to a gas station this evening...and without any prompting, the owner, who is Arabic, asks me, "Do you have a boyfriend?"  I don't know how many times this has happened in the past two years.  I've stopped counting.  I stopped walking around downtown Royal Oak, because I was getting this so often from the Arabic guys...I just felt uncomfortable.  I'm not soliciting the attention.  'You gotta boyfriend?  Wanna go out to dinner?  Had anything to eat?  Can I have your phone number?' are all lines that are a bit pushy, abrupt, and definitely not the first thing I want to hear out of anyone's mouth, much less than that of any stranger.  It's only the Arabic guys that are doing this.  A few weeks ago, I was on my way home from my parent's house.  Ity was late, I looked like crap...and I mean I looked *really* icchy...it was hot and sticky outside...and I was all sweaty and oily.  I simply go in to pay for my gas.  I didn't even say a word to the guy.  Didn't look at him (I was so tired, it was not funny.  I was just looking forward to taking a shower and crawling under some clean sheets).  The guy says to me, "I get off in 30 minutes.  Can I have your number?  I'll take you out to eat."  I am polite.  I need to be a bit more rude and abrupt though.  The guy tonight?  He asked me, after the question about having a boyfriend, "You married?  You have any children?"  I replied I was happily single, two cats, not looking.  I thought that was the end of the story.  No.  His last question was, "Do you have a lover?"  OH MY GAWD.  I was dumbfounded that he asked me that question.  He took one look at my face and immediately apologised...left me alone.  It gets worse.  I go in to pick up my change, as I overpaid, and the guy behind the register asks me, "Can I ask you a question?"  I was not in the mood.  My answer?  'Before you ask, I am single, two cats, no kids, not married, never married, no boyfriend, not looking, not interested."  The guy behind the counter looked as if I was a lunatic or something.  He said he wasn't asking me any of those questions.  He wanted to know where my accent comes from.  AARGH!!!  I wasn't embarassed, though I apologised...and good-naturedly told him that his employer had been asking me questions.  My accent?    I've been asked if I'm from England or Canada before.  In my 11th grade English class, they students actually took a vote about my supposed accent.  Some people think they hear an accent.  I pronounce my words properly.  I enunciate.  Some people are not used to this, and interpret that as having an accent.     LOL!  I do pick up some accents easily.  When in Canada and England, I can pick up dialets so easily, you might almost think I am a natural-born of that country.  I didn't bother trying to learn an Australian accent.  It was too difficult.  I would need a dialect coach for that one.  As it stands, my British accent is sorely lacking.  I need to get around some British people for a quick brush-up...  Back to what I was ranting about...it bothers me that the Arabic men (who approach me with no encouragement on my part) are so forward, aggressive.  It feels as if there is a lack of respect in their come-ons.  I'm not saying this because of any predisposition of prejudice towards people who are Arabic.  I'm not.  I just don't like the feeling of all this...that's all.  It's happening more often.  I'm about at the point that I might bring a ring in the car and put it on when I go out with friends or pay for gas.  Speaking of my friends...  My close friends are incredulous when I tell them, for the first time in a very long time, I am ready to allow for the possibility of becoming involved in a serious relationship.  I'm alive and I have a pulse.  Of course I've met men I've found attractive.  I've even dated a couple guys in the past three years.  I simply have not met that special someone who appeals to and connects with me on a mental/emotional level.  There is so much to each individual person’s unique personality and my own self that I'm not able to adequately describe what I am ultimately looking for in a man. It’s a matter of chemistry. It’s a matter of that feeling inside…when you just *know*.  I believe that there has to be a certain chemistry there...that when you meet someone you *know* whether something more is possible...or if you are just going to be really good friends.    I have to say, I am blessed with many friends who just happen to be men.  *SMILE*  What do I find attractive in a man?  Ooo...that's easy.  A brain.  Seriously!  I find intelligence to be very sexy.  Brains are a big turn-on for me.  So are kind eyes.  I'm a sucker for a sexy voice.  Having been in radio...there is something about the way a man's voice sounds...I can't really explain it.  I've only ever dated men taller than I am (I'm 5'8", and the men I've dated range in height from 5'10" to 6'6")...and, with the exception of my newly married friend Mitch in Quebec, Canada (who is five years younger than I...but one of the most intelligent, fascinating, inteesting people I know), are anywhere from seven to seventeen years older than I am.    Age..?  It's not a factor.  I simply find that the men I connect with on an intellectual/emotional level who have similar/common interests tend to be older than I am.  As far as I am concerned, age is a number, and nothing more.    What are a few things I am looking for?   A man who is open-minded, has a sense of spontaneity, a *big* heart.  A man who is kind, considerate, thinks of others.  A man who loves music, and has a skewered sense of humor...a man who appreciates the imperfections that make things and people interesting, unique, and most of all...*real*.  I would like to date a man who can give back-rubs just as good...or better than the ones I give.  Every man I've dated (with the exception of my friend Bob, now that I think about it) gives wimpy back-rubs that aren't even worth the effort of moving their hands.  And, unfortunately for me, they were not trainable.  *SMILE*  I believe life is too short to not enjoy yourself and have fun. I can be way too serious at times, and if I get involved with someone need someone who can help me laugh at life...sometimes at myself.    I'm not going to date just to date.  Really, I am so busy right now, I don't have the time.  As I said above, my friends are incredulous that I am allowing for the possibility of dating.  Doesn't mean it's going to happen anytime soon.

      Why is it, the moment I sit down at the computer to compose my thoughts, Cat *MUST* have my complete and immediate attention?   urlLink    Only in Cat's dreams...  Copyright 2004   The above picture of Cat is actually three years old.  I tried to snap a picture of her...but once she realized I actually *wanted* her around for a moment, of course she had better places to be than near me.  Cat is a calico cat, and thus a little fur-covered diva with an attitide.      Cat is quite petite, almost to the point of being fragile.  I call her my little girl, as I feel she thinks herself more human sometimes, than cat.  Some might say that is transferrence on mypart...but if you spent a little time with her...you might be inclined to agree with me.  *SMILE*   urlLink    Don't be deceived.  This cute fur-ball has the heart of a devious little s**t.  Copyright 2004   This picture is of my other cat, Frank.  He is not bothered by cameras.  He really is a little s**t.  I adore him terribly, but if there is trouble to be found, or somewhere I do not want him to be...there he is.    Frank is amazing.  When I adopted him from this pit of a house that had a 'Free Kittens' sign, he was scrawny, infested with fleas and worms, and just a little puff of fur.  Two weeks of hand feeding, one apartment flea infestation, three flea bombs and two years later...he is a *HUGE*, muscular, fifteen pound cat.  Frank is not fat.  He is..hmm...would you say long?  I don't know.  He is a big cat.  I was talking to my friend Steve today.  I am green with envy...  I helped him find a job in Chicago (he was the one who got it of course, with his talent and verve).  Steve brags to me about the public transportation system, the parks, the scenery, how much nicer it is there than it is here in Michigan.  I do not mean to sound disparaging...but Michigan is a pit with no employment potential *unless* you are working in an industry that is somehow connected to the auto industry or manufacturing.  I get tired of hearing how downtown Detroit is on an upswing.  It is not.  Three casinos and a couple new business does not a transformation make.    I LOVE Detroit...I do!  I'm realistic though.  The transformation that Mayor Kilpatrick is aiming towards won't stick unless a. government on the state and federal level take over the educational system in Detroit; b. do something to edify/educate/uplift the working-poor and destitute African-Americans who live in the boundaries of the City of Detroit; c. focus more on combating crime, poverty, abandoned buildings...  I could go on and on.  Govenor Granholm is wasting time with her 'Cool Cities' initiative rather than playing hardball with the serious problems that face the city of Detroit.  I return to walking and my exercise schedule tomorrow.  It's a matter of getting back into the habit/routine than anything else.   If you think nobody cares if you're alive, try missing a couple of car payments.    - Earl Wilson

      It's been a little more than a year since I found out.  It was a bit of a shock at first, as I was more aware of the stigma of herpes than what herpes actually is.   The details of the 'how' I got herpes are not important.  I was engaged to a men who knew, but didn't tell.  The end of the engagement was well before I knew of my diagnosis, and I know it was my ex-fiance, as I had been very thorough on health and medical testing.  That is all I will say about that.   Before I say anything further, here are some quick facts about herpes...  ***About 50 percent to 80 percent of the adult population in the United States has oral herpes (HSV1), also referred to as a 'cold sore'. ***It is estimated that one in five adults in the United States has genital herpes, however, as many as 90% are unaware that they have the virus. This is because many people have very mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. ***If a person with oral herpes (HSV1) performs oral sex, it is possible for the partner to get genital herpes.  ***Herpes can be transmitted when there are no symptoms present.  ***There are several days throughout the year (called asymptomatic reactivation, asymptomatic shedding or subclinical shedding) when a person can be contagious without having a symptom.  ***There are no documented cases of a person getting genital herpes from an inanimate object such as a toilet seat, bathtub or towel. Herpes is a very fragile virus and does not live long on surfaces. ***A person may show symptoms within days after contracting genital herpes, or it may take weeks, months or years.   Educational links about Herpes:    http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2002/202_herp.html http://www.westoverheights.com/freebooktext.html http://www.herpes.com/hsv1-2.html  In July of 2003, I decided to attend a social group gathering for people who have HSV 1 & 2, and HPV.  It is because of that first time meeting these wonderful people that I decided to be 'out there' with my diagnosis.  I spoke with some people who were devestated by having herpes...so much so that they feared anyone finding out about their diagnosis.  The common chord was that they did not want people to judge them, think them promiscuous, dirty, etc...,.  I do not mean to sound brash, nor do I mean to be the poster child for herpes. I simply feel life is too short to live with regret, fear, or any other assorted negative emotion out there. I have Herpes. I accept that. I have to live with this for the rest of my life. The sun is still going to rise and set every day...and how I feel from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep is a decision I make. Why live with guilt or shame when there are other things to spend your time on??? I choose to accept I have Herpes, take actions/responsibility accordingly...and concentrate on living and doing the best I can to be happy.  I look at it this way, take me as I am or don't. I am no less the wonderful person I was before I got herpes.  Herpes does not define me as a person. I believe in educating yourself and others rather than living with shame.  I believe life is too damn short already, thank you very much, to waste precious time worried about what others think.  If someone has questions or misconceptions about herpes, I appreciate the opportunity to educate them.  Education is the only to eradicate the stigma...as well as stem the transmission of herpes.  I have discussed the possibility of doing some media work in regards to herpes.  I have a few friends and contacts left in the industry.  I could do more...*MUCH* more...on a national level if I really put my focus on this.  If I were to do anything where I had face time...while I do not mind having my face out there for the purpose of educating the public and helping to dismiss a undeserved social stigma, if I were to speak publicly about my diagnosis, I would not be able to attend any any of the public social group activities.  I wouldn't attend out of respect for those people concerned about assumption through association.  I certainly respect the desire for privacy that others whom are not as blunt, upfront and outgoing as I am (about herpes) would have.     I have spoken with a few people about this.  No one made any comment about the media attention.  They were more concerned about how this might affect me when it comes to socialising with people in my daily life.  I would not have met some of these people (teachers, lawyers, nurses, all sorts of professional and non-professional people), were it not for the fact we all have herpes in common.  To be honest, I would very much miss seeing some of the people I have become friends with...were I to try to bring media attention/awareness to herpes.  I don't know exactly what I am going to do yet.  For the moment...I am simply going to 'Let go and let God.'     "The longer I live, the more I realize the impact of attitude on life. Attitude to me, is more important than the past, than education, than money, than circumstance, than failures, than successes, than what other people think or say or do. It is more important than appearance, giftedness, or skill. It will make or break a company...a church...a home. The remarkable thing is we have a choice every day regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day. We cannot change our past...we cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way. We cannot change the inevitable. The only thing we cando is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude...I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% how I react to it. And so it is with you...we are in charge of our attitudes."  - Charles Swindoll

       urlLink    Father's Day...  Copyright 2004   The picture above is of my parents (Dad is driving the boat, and Mom is sittingon a seat alone), and Scott's parent's.  This Scott is Debbie's boyfriend...a completely different Scott than my friend Scott, married to Tanya.  I am feeling quite frustrated right now.  I like living in Royal Oak for the convenience aspects.  I am five and twenty minutes away from the respective campuses I currently attend, and fifteen minutes away from the college I will receive my Bachelor degree from.  It's quite the tony place to live, with all the little bistros, bars, and boutiques.  Any night of the week, the downtown area is bustling.  It's not inexpensive to live here.  I am paying $600 a month for, at most, a 600 sq. foot apartment.  Even that is not *too* bad.  I love all the trees and grass...and being moments away from the freeway.  I live in a wonderful neighborhood, there are only four units here, and all my neighbors are great. Especially Colleen.  Colleen is awesome...and she is the main reason I do not move away and find somewhere less expensive, and larger to live *before* my move to wherever I end up.  I'm afraid I might move somewhere and not have as great a neighbor ever again.  She has a key to to my apartment.  If I am away overnight unexpectedly, she doesn't mind coming in to check on my cats(Colleen is a vet tech, which is an added benefit!).  I bring her leftovers whenever I go out on a dinner date (which has not been often as of late...).  Whenever I cook, there is always extra made for her fridge. :)  Colleen and I get together quite often to sit and talk about whatever.  She has a wonderful sense of humor, and it's fun to kick back with a glass of White Zinfandel and kvetch about whatever is on our minds at that moment. *smile*    I *miss* having a kitchen to cook in.  I gave most of my kitchen appliances to my brother ages ago, because I have no counterspace for anything.  I take that back.  I have two feet of counter space on either side of my kitchen sink.  One side is where I heep the rack for drying dishes.  The other side is where I have the coffeemaker (just stick the IV in me and start the caffeine drip, please), blender, ice shaver, and ice crusher (for the protein shakes I have not made in the longest time...).  I use the storage closet as a pantry, so I might store all my spices, food, and other odds and ends.  What I would GIVE right now for a full size refrigerator, stove, and LOTS of counterspace?  A dishwasher...???  I almost drool at the thought!  ***LAUGHTER***    I would *LOVE* to live somewhere I could customize my surroundings to my taste.  I wish I could use bold paint, knock out a wall...rearrange things.  I would *love* to go to Eastern Market, buy a bunch of flowers, and plant a garden(if the back area were a bit larger...)...or at the very least, do something with the bare patch of dirt in front of the picture window.  I dunno.  Am I going through a nesting phase...?  Perhaps.  I'm moving to Chicago or New York in a year and a half.  When I make the move...I've decided I'm selling most everything and starting fresh.  I'd like to do something different when it comes to decorating the next time I move.  What I have in the apartment isn't really my style anymore...but it does the job for now.  On to something new...  I stopped by to visit Becky on Saturday.  We have known each other since we were first-graders at Bishop Kelly.  I *finally* showed her my pictures from Australia.  Well, I showed her eight of the rolls I've shot(I have another ten rolls to pick up this week.  Her kids *loved* the pictures, especially those where I am with 'Australian' animals.  *SMILE*  It's not healthy for me to be around Becky too long.  Her children are simply *too* cute.  My biological clock starts ticking a bit when I am around them...especially Michael.  Michael is the most photogenic little boy I've ever seen.  He has this mischivous way about him...a certain light in his eyes.  And he is so completely adorable!  Becky's daughters look exactly like her when she was that age. Even when Becky's children are misbehaving, they are the most well behaved children I've ever seen.    Becky reminds me I have not seen them at their worst...and if I ever need birth control, I can come over to babysit them while she and Todd go out. :)  I might take her up on that.  I enjoyed going home for Father's Day.  I was able to speak with Stacy, Debbie, and Keith about party plans.  Debbie kept Mom occupied while I searched the house for Momand Dad's wedding photos.  If only I'd had more time, I could have gotten the photos I *really* need right now...photos of Mom and Dad when they were children.  I don't know how I am going to pull off getting those...unless I find out exactly when Mom and Dad go somewhere...and take what I need then.  I feel guilty doing this, even though it is for a good cause.  I'm going to see what I can do about getting Mom's wedding dress out of the house...and getting a dress form to display it on at the party.  On the other hand...do I really need one more thing to stress out about?  *SMILE*  I have 50 confirmed people so far.  I have only received 20% of the RSVP's I sent out with the invitations thus far.  PLUS...I am going to shoot myself for doing this later...but I really need to invite the Rochan side of the family as well.  Dad's side of the family is HUGE...and I would hate to offend anyone by not inviting them.  This is not just a Landry/Marlow party.  It is a *family* party...at least this is what I am striving for.  I've asked Stacy to bring her camera so we might get family photos.  Given the way things are going...this may be the last really big family function (aside from a funeral) where everybody is gathered together in one place.  Sadly, Aunt Florence's health is declining rapidly due to her Alzheimers...so the next gathering (and last for all the families as Aunt Florence was the glue that held everyone together) might not be too far from now.    I've decided I *am* going to have a pastor present so Mom and Dad can renew their vows at the party.  They have been talking about it anyway...so I do not think it would be a faux-pas to surprise them with that on top of the surprise party.  I have a friend from high school who is a pastor.  I am positive if I ask him, that he would be happy to help me out.  Those were the days...Russ, Luke, Anne, Scott, Tanya, Pene, Alicia and I...  *SMILE*  I still keep in touch with Luke and Ann.  I speak to Scott and Tanya on a daily basis.  *SMILE*  Back to today...  Dad took everyone out on the lake for a pontoon ride.  The barbeque was wonderful.  I enjoyed spending the time with Mom.  All in all, it was a great day.  Other than that, there is nothing big to report.  No Earth shattering news.  Given the way my life can be...give it a few days...I'm sure something will happen.  *SMILE*    How strange is the lot of us mortals! Each of us is here for a brief sojourn; for what purpose he knows not, though he senses it. But without deeper reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for other people.

       urlLink    This fawn is less than twenty-four hours old.  I was told that the turkey (I forgot to get the name of the breed) is on the endangered species list.  Copyright 2004    Today was a 'chocolate' day.    I 'indulged' a little bit.  Not much.  I've just about lost all the weight I gained back when I was sick...so I don't feel guilty.  I am feeling a bit stressed.  I am having difficulty getting in touch with the relatives in Quebec.  Given how quickly Aunt Florence's Alzheimer's is progressing...this might be the last opportunity for my French-Canadian relatives to come down and visit her...while she still remembers them.    Aunt Florence remembers me.  She does not remember my brother or sisters.  I spent an hour with her and listened to her repeat the same story four or five times, struggle to remember people, events...  I listened to her verion of events surrounding her guardianship...which I know to be false...as I was at the famiy meeting where all the details were discussed.  I feel badly for her.  Inviting the French-Canadian relatives to the party is the one thing I can do to bring a little happiness into her life...though she probably won't remember having seen them for very long.  Interestingly enough...I ran into a couple men from France in a store today.  They spoke no English...and I remembered just enough French to be somewhat understood.  :)  I wonder if I have enough time to practice...and perhaps be able to speak enough French to be understood...?  Hmm...I think I have more pressing things to worry about though...  I *still* need to get the menu together.  I'll try to get that done by Sunday.  I know I'm jumping all over the place.  I'm tired.  I'm feeling a bit scattered at the moment.  I do hope that some of the French Canadian relatives come down.  Aunt Florence complained that, at the last family party, she was left on her own, alone.  It's true.  I can't sit next to her during the whole of the party.  I suspect I am going to spend the majority of my time making sure everything is moving smoothly, food is on the table, etc...,.  I will do my best though, to make sure that Aunt Florence does not feel neglected...even if that means I have to set up a schedule of sorts...and ask relatives to sit with her.  I feel sorry for Aunt Florence...and the least I can do is make sure that she leaves this party in better spirits than when she arrived.   "I am only one; but still I am one. I cannot do everything, but still I can do something; I will not refuse to do something I can do."  -Helen Keller

       Sanity, oh sanity.  What'll I do with you?    urlLink    Sydney Harbour, Australia   Copyright 2004   I have no reason for posting this particular Australia picture.  I like it and was in the mood to post a picture.  If you have a moment, check out Polyphonic Spree.  This link  http://www.wmuk-newmedia.co.uk/mp/polyphonicspree/lightnday/index.html  is for their live video, "Light And Day".  I love the harmony and lyrics. :)    I've decided to start posting select voice-overs and pictures online to share with friends.  Those can be accessed at:  http://briefcase.yahoo.com/pureimaginari  Back to business.  The title of this particular blog references a bad Yoko Ono song (like there are any *good* Yoko Ono songs...).  I am questioning my sanity at the moment.  *SMILE*  Why am I questioning my sanity???  I have 42 people now, that I know for certain are coming to the party.  None of those are people who received invitations (invitations should have started to arrive today).  I'm nervous that more than 70 people will RSVP.  I can do it.  I can cater this.  I'm just nervous.  That's a lot of people...and a heck of a lot of food to have to make plans for.  I don't want to make too much or too little.  *SIGH*  What have I gotten myself into! *SMILE*  My sister Stacy paid me a rare compliment the other day.  It's not that she doesn't appreciate me...she is just not given to doing that sort of thing.  Stacy told me she was glad I'm in charge of all this, as she knows I am good at organising things. Just thinking about the unexpected compliment she gave me makes me smile.   Saturday, I shopped from 11AM to 9PM for decorations and accessories for the party.  Silly me for giving a low-ball estimate on how much I would be spending.  I spent $250 between the invitations, postage, platters and serving supplies, and assorted decorations.  I still need to buy matching plates, bowls, drinking glasses, and napkins.  In theory, I could do that on the cheap and buy styrofoam plates, bowls, and drinking glasses.  I can't bring myself to do that though.  It sounds a bit smobby, perhaps, but I want this to look classy.  It will be a cheap looking classy on **my** budget...but definitely a step above styrofoam! ;-)  I think I will buy 15 vases as the centerpieces for the tables...  I can get 4 dozen roses for $20 at Eastern Market.  I'm not too bad at doing floral arrangements...so perhaps some roses, a few other assorted flowers and greenery.  I can probably do the centerpieces for $50 and send them home with the guests...or perhaps even drop them off at a nursing home if the guests do not take them home.  Stacy is taking care of the alcohol.  I have too much to do with the food without worrying about that.  I will be buying champagne for a champagne toast...and perhaps a champagne punch.  All that is left is the food...and I can't really do anything there until a week before the party...and then the two days leading up to the party.  It's time for me to start on the menu.  I hope to have it firmed up in the next few days what I am serving so I can make more lists up, get back with my brother and sisters...and be a bit less nervous about the party.  Once everything is organized and plans are down on paper...it's a matter of doing what needs to be done...AND being flexible and able to compensate should things not quite go as planned...    A strong positive mental attitude will create more miracles than any wonder drug. Patricia Neal

       "Blackbird singing in the dead of night, take these broken wings and learn to fly..."   An excerpt from my favorite Beatles song...Blackbird. :)  Good news...I set the blackbird free this morning.  It was awesome...  The moment I took the carrier outside, the bird got excited.  I put my hand in the carrier, he perched on my finger for a few moments before taking off. :)  You don't often get to see a wild bird up close like that. :)  I am happy for having saved it from being the entree of the stray grey cat that I feed...  Some people might think it's just a bird...and why make a fuss.  I say...it's alive, and that is reason enough. :)   Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted."  -Albert Einstein

       If you could see me now...   You would either fall to the ground laughing...or run away in fear! *SMILE*  It's 4:20AM as I write this.  My back is bothering me and I can't sleep...so I'm wasting time with watching TV....one of my favorite movies actually...'Dave.'  Anyway, just finished a long shower, and now have a mud mask on my face...that is almost a fuschia color. I figure, if I am not feeling good, I might as well look good!  I sent out 67 invitations today.  I have 31 people I know are coming at this point...before even sending the invites out.  I wonder how many people are going to confirm.  I went to the center today...where the party is going to be held.  It is *lovely*.  There is a patio, it overlooks a lake,and the kitchen is big enough for four people to move around.  I have two stoves, two refrigerators, lots of tables and chairs. :)  I think I will try to bring a grill so I can do grilled chicken along with everything else.  Speaking of birds...I saved a blackbird's life today...so far.  I found one outside as I was leaving .  It was struggling to fly and appeared to be injured.  Rather than let the stray cat I feed have a treat for dinner, I stuck it in my cat carrier, put a stick up for it to perch on, bird seed and water for it to eat/drink.  It was alive when I checked on it a few hours ago.  I am hoping it was simply stunned by something and it will be able to fly tomorrow.  If the bird is unable to fly...I know of a place about an hour from here that rehabs wildlife. :)  What can I say...I'm a softie at heart. :)  I'm having fun reading all my old journals.  I'll have to mention a few entries in here at a later date..as this weekend is going to be a busy one.  Friday I have a party with the social group I am involved with...as well as plans to go out with Scott and Tanya.  I'll probably do the party...as I can always head out with Scott and Tanya next week.  besides..I am sure they would appreciate time alone without either myself or their children around. :)  Saturday I go home and spend time with Mom.  Dad is away with his friend (who was a member of Regan's cabinet) in Washington D.C. for the funeral and will then head off with Norm to look at land in North Carolina.  I wanted to spend the whole weekend with Mom...and return home Monday afternoon...but no go.    You see...I got *GREAT* news today.  The singing voiceover that I hate...everybody else likes!  Most importantly...the client likes it.  A few changes need to be made...and John wants the client to have it in hand Monday morning. :(  So...I'll be home with Mom Saturday afternoon through Sunday afternoon.   I amused to hearing the recorded sound of my voice given my radio background and all the commercial work I've done.  The sound of my singing voice?  I do not like it.  I do not like the way it sounds.  However, it is obvious that other people hear a talent that I can't recognize.  After all, if the client is willing to pay thousands of dollars to purchase the jingle...and pay for it to run at multiple stations...I must not sound as bad as I had thought.  Need to get this mud off my face so I can get some sleep.  I have a busy day ahead!   Getting ahead in a difficult profession requires avid faith in yourself. That is why some people with mediocre talent, but with great inner drive, go much further than people with vastly superior talent. Sophia Loren

       One month and one day...   Can I  really  do this???  Ummm...yes...but I am getting very nervous.  I am sending out the invitations today.  I'm running late in all this, but I only just got the addresses three days ago.  I'm organizing my parent's *surprise* 40th anniversary party...all by myself.  Stacy, Keith, and Debbie all live in Lansing...about one and a half hours away.  I am down here in the Metro-Detroit area...where all my parent's relatives are, where the party is being held...  Besides...it was *my* idea.  *SIGH*  I'm planning a party for 50-80 people on a budget of about $500.  I'm budgeting about $100 of that on wine and champagne.  I expect to spend about $100 at Eastern Market and buy all the veggies. fruit, and sliced meats I need the day before the party.  I'll probably spend another $100 on the meat for the toutierre pies.  Probably about $100 for desserts.  The rest will be for decorations and incidentals I miss.  I'll be cooking and preparing food Friday, Saturday AND Sunday.  My friend Beverly is helping on Sunday.  I think Keith and Terri will be coming down on Saturday to help with the food preparations.  My fingers are crossed...  A week before, Keith, Val, Terri, and I will be preparing about 40 pies.  I am working on finding the freezer space to store them in.  I might make some of the desserts.  I am undecided.  It all depends on how much time I have.  I am tempted to just buy all of the desserts...but a part of me rebels against that thought.  I am a damn fine cook, if I do say so myself. ;-)  I'd rather bake than buy...  The toutierre pies, a Landry tradition, will be one of the main dishes.  I'm probably going to make lasagne, possibly a different pasta dish.  I will have a variety of meats for sandwiches.  Sweet and sour meatballs.  A cheese platter.  Perhaps a shrimp platter.  A tossed salad, three or four different cold salads.  Chips, dips.  A fruit platter.  Chocolate covered strawberries...those are easy enough for me to make.  Hmm...I might also make a few other fruit desserts that do not take too long.  I need to go to the venue and map out in my mind exactly what I am going to do...get a look at the kitchen.  I also need to do something to relax.    I'm going to be fine...and I *can* do this.  I have no lack of confidence in my ability to do so.  It's not like I didn't help organize enough events when I was in 4-H years ago.  I *did* work in the kitchen at Miniwanca *YEARS* ago...and have prepared food for large groups botht here and in 4-H.  Just because I haven't done this is MANY years, that doesn't mean I've forgotten what to do.  Time to go shop for supplies...and send out the invites.   "Everything you can imagine is real."

       urlLink    If there was one thing I learned from my trip to Australia...  Copyright 2004    Hi Everyone!  It's six days short of a month since I've posted in here.I have a good reason for this...  What I thought was allergies was actually more of a respitory infection.  Not quite bronchits...  All I can say is that what I was coughing up was this seasons green. ;-)  I'm feeling mostly better now.  There is a *but* in here...  I regained a lot of what I lost. :(  What can I say?  When you are sick, you don't feel like cooking.  I went off my 'diet', had no energy to exercise, and ate what was most convenient.  I'm feeling better now...so it's back to working on becoming more fit and healthy. :)  Some news...  I am trying out for "The Swan" on Wednesday.  They are coming to the Detroit area to interview/audition people.  I can use this as a research opportunity for script ideas. I'd go at the drop of a hat if chosen!  Three months with a personal trainer, no chores, and someone else doing the cooking?  I could live with that! ;-)  Beyond that...things have been quiet.  now that I am feeling better, I suspect I will have more to wrote about in the future.  Before I go...I love the cool feature where you can add pictures to your posts that Blogger just added.  Why did I say that...if there was one thing I learned...with the title of the photo being, 'THERE IS NOTHING TO FEAR'?  I had the most wonderful experience in Sydney.    Sometimes people come into your life for a moment, reason, a season.  These people come and go, but some part of them touches you in a way that you will never be the same person you were before the moment they entered your life.    I mentioned Paul in my Australia Blog:  http://pureimaginari.blogspot.com/  While Stacy and Neil were out eating their pizza, Paul and I rode the ferry all over Sydney Harbour...and talked.  Paul said to me that a year prior, I probably never thought I would be sitting with him, eating dinner in front of the Sydney Harbour Opera House, watching the ferries under the stars.  Two travellers far away from home, simply admiring the beauty of the city and enjoying the other's company.  He said many things...one of which was...I could do anything I wanted to do.  Where did I see myself a year in the future?  I'm still thinking about that last question he asked me.  I'm working on that.  Where do I see myself a year form the night he and I went out to dinner?  I don't know.  Back in Sydney Harbour?  Chicago?  New York?  Here in Michigan?  Only time will tell.  I know where I want to be...  The process of getting there, amd myself for that matter, is a work in progress.  I could have kept in contact with Paul if I'd wanted to.  He let me know it was a possibility...saying that business takes him to Chicago, and that perhaps we could meet there.  I toyed with the thought of maintaining contact...but decided against it.  I left Paul a note at the front desk of the Four Seasons (where I was staying), thanking him for a lovely time...wishing him the best...and ended the note with 'Goodbye'.  I don't often say, "Goodbye", as I feel it sounds too final.  It's a silly ideosyncracy of mine perhaps...  I don't smoke.  I rarely drink.  I'm allowed a quirk or two...as long as I am not so quirky that I get myself committed.  I mean in an institution...not in a relationship!  *SMILE*  I trust my intuition...when I have gone against it I usually get in trouble.  I did not feel that it would be good to maintain contact with Paul.  I feel that I made the right decision, and I am happy with the memories I have.  That is all I really care to say about it for now.   You see things; and you say, 'Why?' But I dream things that never were; and I say, "Why not?" George Bernard Shaw

      Gotta love my brother, Keith.  I brought him a copy of my 'music' library, over 40 gigabites of .mp3's, and in exchange, he loaned me about 80 CD's to copy for my listening pleasure.  *SMILE*  Keith and I have similar tastes in music, and what he loaned me fills some holes in music from the 80's that I had...  I just have to say this one more time...it is wonderful to have all this music to listen to!  Earlier in the week, I set iTunes on it's shuffle feature and did housework while listening to music.  It certainly makes the time I spend doing chores go by much more quickly.  Dare I say that I almost enjoy doing housework as long as I have some good music playing?  I'd better keep that secret to myself. ;-)   I was surprised to receive a call from the FDA this week.  I reported an allergic reacion I had to a diet supplement back in February.  I had no idea that they had been trying to reach me to gain access to my medical records.  Let me explain about what happened...  I was lucky that it was a slow allergic reaction.    You have no idea how scared I was.  I'd been 'stacking' supplements as recommended by a worker at Vitamin World for two days.  The night of the second day, I wasn't feeling great, and was feeling itchy...but didn't think anything of it.  After all, we're talking February, and I thought I might be having a problem with dry skin or something.   I felt so...lethargic.  I fell asleep on the couch......only to wake up itching myself.  I thought that was odd.  When I looked in the mirror, I saw a blotch on my hip, and small blotches on my arms, chest, and legs.  I looked up hives on the internet...but that didn't seem to be what was going on.  I then called my Mom...who has had personal experience with hives.  Mom was concerned and suggested that it might be a good idea to go to the doctor immediately.  I didn't really want to go to the hospital at that time of the morning, and thought that I could wait until later and see my physician.  I was debating going back to sleep...when I noticed I was having difficulty breathing.  The scariest thing was driving to the hospital, less than ten minutes away from where I live.  I looked into the mirror...and was watching blotches appear on my face so fast that it was fascinating watching them pop up while waiting at a red light...praying for it to make a quick change to green.  By the time I made it to the hospital, my chest/stomach was a one large blotch, hive, whatever you want to call it, and I was scared, really scared.   The doctor at the hospital told me that it can take the body up to three days to develop an allergic reaction.  He also said I was lucky that it was a 'slow' allergic reaction.  The next time I consume anything with this particular ingredient, I could go into anaphylactic shock.  I was treated with benadryl and hydrocortisone, watched until there was a noticible decrease in symptoms, and released.   I am very careful now...and stay away from supplements designed to assist in weight loss.  I will be losing weight the old fashioned way...proper eating and exercise.  From what the gentleman from the FDA told me, Vitamin World has been notified about the allergic reaction I had, they have submitted to the FDA a copy of the bottle label/list of ingredients, and are waiting on me to submit approval so they might see my medical records.  It's nice to know that our government can be on the ball about something like this.  I guess the big question would be why the heck didn't I call an ambulance?  Well, I didn't think of it, quite honestly.  I didn't think it was so serious until I was in the car, watching my face figuratively light up like a Christmas tree with red bulbs on it...  By then, I was less than a mile from the hospital's entrance. There wasn't much I could do beyond pray at that point.  Fortunately for me, things worked out.   I was telling a school friend today that I might live the life of a 'Drama Queen', but it's certainly not intentional.  I just seem to be in the right place at the right time and find that I have interesting (true) stories to tell.  Another friend of mine said that he enjoys it when I call him, because he gets to live vicariously through me.  I think I am going to go with what Scott says...   What did Scott say???  At my parent's anniversary party, I had photos of my family going back to when we were babies, up to the point when we were entering adulthood.   I sat down with Scott and Tanya to tagrab a quick bite to eat, as well as listen to my Dad's speech honoring my Mom befor emaking a champagne toast.  Scott said it was obvious in all the photos that there was something different about me in comparison to everyone else in my family.  He said I had a devilish look about me, a certain energy, that there was something in my eyes, about myself, that made me stand out.   I'm not saying he's right because I'm self-centered.  Of all the things I am, self-centered is not one of them.  I'm agreeing with Scott because I could see what he was talking about in the photos...and to be honest, this is not the first time I have heard something similar to what he expressed to me that day.   Perhaps I will share some of those stories another day.  For the moment, I think this entry is entirely too long.  I certainly do not want to put anyone to sleep.  Besides...I got the check in the mail today!  WOW!  I mean, here I thought it was goig to take the 30 days I was advised about...and it arrived while I was gone!  Tomorrow, I am going to go out and pay bills as well as go buy groceries!  I might even go and splurge on a Rolling Stones CD. *SMILE*  Love to all!  ~ Michelle   One of the most tragic things I know about human nature is that all of us tend to put off living.  We are all dreaming of some magical rose garden over the horizon - instead of enjoying the roses that are blooming outside our windows today.     ~Dale Carnegie

       urlLink WXYZ-TV // Detroit // Contest   I was on their web site and saw this contests a month or so ago.  I figured, "Why not enter?"    Wouldn't you know, my picture was chosen as the winning picture? *SMILE*   urlLink    My Winning Smile...  Copyright 2004   I have a winning smile. *GRIN*  I'm tickled that I won!  I won two tickets to Cedar Point last week from a local mail-in contest.  Now, I have four tickets to an Amusement park, and three people I need to invite so we can go down and have some fun!  I have not been there in sixteen years....so it would be fun.  Alternatively, I might give the tickets to friends of mine who can't otherwise afford to go.  I don't know...  We'll see.  Add that to the thousand dollars I won earlier this week...  I've got quite the lucky streak going!  I've decided that I'm going to win a new car next. :)  You know, the funny thing about all this, is while I do enter contests to on occasion, I don't enter contests as often as you might think I do, given how much I won.  I rarely enter contests nowadays...and often win the few contests I do enter.  I'm not complaining though. :)   - Michelle   Everything in life is luck.   ~Donald Trump

       urlLink Webshots Community - javakitty's Photo Home Page   I've had people asking me just when I might get around to posting the pictures from my trip to Australia on the internet...  Well, I'm working on it.  As a matter of fact, if you check out the above link, you can watch what is a work in progress.  I'm uploading pictures from trip, but they are in no particular order at this point, and very few are titles as to where the pictures were taken. I wil rectify that soon. In the meantime, it's a miracle that I've managed to get this far.  Looking back at the pictures, especially a few taken in Sydney...I almost wish I were there right now. Australia is *such* a beautiful country...  I'd write more...but I have to get back to uploading pictures...  ~ Michelle    I think a photography class should be a requirement in all educational programs because it makes you see the world rather than just look at it.     ~Author Unknown

      I was looking at my bills yesterday, wondering how I was going to juggle my budget for August, when I received a call from a Smooth Jazz V98.7FM. I had entered an on-line contest a few months ago, and the station called to advise me that I won $1000.  Woo hoo!!!  So..how am I going to spend the money?  I'm going to pay bills. Anything beyond that, we will see. I'm not going to spend money I don't actually have yet.  Beyond that...  An interesting thing happened today.  My friend Beverly invited me out for a fish dinner, as her boyfriend does not like fish. We went out to dinner, did a bit of shopping, and ended our 'girls night out' over drinks at a local oyster bar. All in all, it was a very nice evening.  We were almost at Beverly's car when someone called out my name. A man whom I'd gone out with for coffee a few times had seen me walking by the shop he was reading/drinking coffee at, thought it was me had seen, and left his seat to follow me.  The interesting thing is this... A thought had crossed my mind about this guy earlier today. Just a brief thought. I had no reason to believe this guy was in the United States, and only saw him a few times, briefly for coffee almost two years ago. Last I knew, he had returned to France, Italy, or wherever it is he came from. Why I thought of him today of all days is unknown to me.  I don't remember his name. I don't remember if he is French or Italian. He does resemble Roberto Benigni, the Oscar-winning actor from the Oscar-winning movie "Life Is Beautiful".  Anyway, I just find it interesting...that I think about him in passing, and then, out of the blue, run into him. Even more interesting was watching this 40+ year old man throw a snit-fit when I refused to give him my phone number. I don't mean to sound cruel, but it was funny.  You have to understand, the reason I only met this person for coffee a few times is that I got the 'vibe' he was married. I don't date married men. Back then, he refused to give me his home number, yet wanted mine...and the one time he said he was calling from his home number, I was able to track the number down, via the internet, to a telephone booth at a grocery store about seven miles from where I live. It sounded fishy to me then, and now. A man acting like that screams out subconsciously, "I'm married, and looking for a bit on the side!"  As far as I am concerned, if a person gives me reason not to trust them, I don't need them in my life. That was it for me.  So, back to what happened. This guy asks me four different times for my number. I refused. Once again, he refused to give me his number (not that I had plans to call anyway). He stomped off, muttering 'this isn't worth it'. All I could do was wait until I got into Beverly's car to laugh...and explain the background behind what happened. The guy has obvious power/dominance issues, and I don't play that game either.  Come to think of it...I don't play games period.  ` Michelle   "Guys are like dogs. They keep comin' back. Ladies are like cats. Yell at a cat one time, they're gone." - Lenny Bruce

      What the heck am I talking about???   I went to what is called a 'Ghetto-Fab' party Saturday night.&nbsp; I have no idea what the heck, "Ghetto-Fab" means.&nbsp;   What I *do* know is that it was a 70's Disco theme party.&nbsp; The invite said that the person who dressed 'Best 70's" would win a prize (a freezer mug).   You know...I thought I would have competition.&nbsp; I really did.&nbsp; Out of the fifteen or so people who went to the party, I was the only one to dress in what looked like 70's garb.   What did I wear?&nbsp; I wore a low-cut black top that tied around my neck, a short skirt with a funky swirling print to it, and knee-high 'pleather' boots with three-inch heels.   Further, I curled my hair, wore a ton of blue eye shadow, lined my eyes with black powder, wore a gob of mascara, very obviously applied blush and RED, RED lipstick.&nbsp; I had enough hairspray in my hair ( 1/2 a can ofAquanet...the truly nasty stuff...but it holds!) to damage the ozone layer.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; If anyone came near me with a match or a lit cigarette, we're talking Hair on fire, `a la Richard Pryor or Michael Jackson.   I looked quite funky, if I do say so myself. *SMILE*&nbsp; All in all, I had fun...and that is what matters most.   I *knew* the boots, which I lovingly call 'ankle-breakers' would really cause my back to ache.&nbsp; What can I say?&nbsp; I knew I could take them off at the party.&nbsp; I wanted to look 'fun', and have fun.&nbsp;&nbsp; You know, get into the spirit of everything.   Life is too short to not have fun...    "You have no idea how much it costs to look this cheap."    &nbsp;- Steven Tyler, Aerosmith

      Things I&nbsp;really like&nbsp;at the moment...   1.&nbsp; The fact I have a *LARGE* hard drive.&nbsp; Between my two hard drives, I have 200 Gigabites of memory.   2.&nbsp; I-tunes.&nbsp; The 'Party Shuffle' feature is *so* sweet!   3.&nbsp; My dear friend Bob, and not only because he is loaning me CD's from his 1000+ CD collection!   Last year, I bought quite a few 'Best of...' collections, ranging fron the 50's through the 90's.&nbsp; Add that to my actual CD collection and I had quite a bit of music on my hands.&nbsp; I decided I wanted to convert everything over to .mp3's, save a hard copy of everything to DVD's, and get rid of the actual CD's.&nbsp; I will have approximately 5500 sonds on 10 DVD's (as a back-up to my hard drive).   Bob, sweetheart that he is, has graciously loaned me CD's from his fabulous collection to add to my burdgeoning collection.&nbsp; How fabulous is Bob's CD collection?&nbsp; Well, Amazon.com has their recommended, "Essentials" list that I was perusing online yesterday and today.&nbsp; Bob has most of their recommended Rock/Blues essentials.&nbsp;   I feel like a kid in a candy store...going through&nbsp;Bob's CD collection.&nbsp; I think I've borrowed around 100 CD's from him over the past week...all of them *classics*.&nbsp; Bob, quite literally, rocks.   I'm just *so* tickled that I have this huge music library at my fingertips.   Funny thing is...&nbsp; I have all this music...but there is so much more out there that I don't have...that I want.&nbsp; It would take me eleven days to listen to the music I have right now, and we are talking&nbsp;about listening 24 hours a day.&nbsp; Stil, there are songs, artists that I don't have...that I simply must get.   At this point, I want to say that everything I have&nbsp;has been&nbsp;acquired  legally .&nbsp; I do not have any file sharing programs on my computer.&nbsp; They are bundled with too much spyware and crap, and I *do* believe that&nbsp;file sharing&nbsp;is out and out theft.&nbsp; I do believe there is a difference between borrowing CD's from Bob...and using file sharing programs.&nbsp; Mainly...the artist got royalties from the CD's Bob bought.&nbsp; The artist does not get jack-squat from illegally downloaded music.   Believe me...if I could afford to spend four or five thousand dollars on CD's, I would go out and buy the CD's rather than borrow from Bob (though as I noted above, I had qute the collection myself before I decided to put everything on my hard drive and divest myself of all the CD's.).&nbsp; If I had that much money,&nbsp;I would not be living in the small apartment I am in right now...which means I would have room to store everything. *SMILE*   I just love listening to music.&nbsp; Listening to music brings me a kind of happiness that I find very difficult to explain.&nbsp; I love most music (with the exception of Gangsta Rap and truly purile acid rock that is derogatory and violent).&nbsp; World music, Classical, Jazz, Rock, Pop...and other genres of music...you name it(genre...not artist-specific), I probably have heard it and like it...or can find something to like about it.   I guess, as addictions go...being 'addicted' to music...and wanting to collect all the 'essential' artists, classic albums, and the music I like isn't such a bad thing.   &nbsp;- Michelle    I'm not an addict. I'm a habitual user.    &nbsp;- The Last Days Of Disco

      On my way home today, in the middle of M-24, a *very* busy road in Oakland County, I saw what was either a large painted turtle, or a small snapper in the middle of the road.&nbsp; I turned around so I might make it to the turtle before a vehicle did, and perhaps run it over to the other side of the road...where a lake and marshy area were not too far away.   What made me smile...is that there was another person out there who was concerned about the welfare of the turtle and thoughtful enough to think of the same thing...beat me to it!&nbsp; I pulled over long enough to pip my horn at the gentleman, give him a wave, and mouth, "Thank you!", before driving off.   It's acts of kindness like that which give me hope that there are still good people out there, willing to think of others or even other things/animals ahead of themselves...to help make the world a better place.   Now, closer to home...I've taken on a few more cats.   Not in my apartment.&nbsp; I've been feeding a cat, which may or may not belong to someone (but looked like it was half-starved before I started putting out food for him).&nbsp; He's brought along a female cat and her two kittens.&nbsp; What I find interesting is, before he will eat, he watches over the female cat and the two kittens (the three of which I believe are feral) before he will eat.   I'm thinking of caging the trio...perhaps take them to the cat rescue after ten days...so they might be spayed/neutered.&nbsp; It's only fair...to help control disease and decrease the unwanted animal population.&nbsp; If I do this, it will be a week or so before I get around to it.&nbsp; I have a lot to do in my own life before I take something like caging and taking care of three feral cats on.&nbsp;&nbsp;   "Life is as dear to a mute creature as it is to man. Just as one wants happiness and fears pain, just as one wants to live and not die, so do other creatures."    &nbsp;- The Dalai Lama

       urlLink Locks of Love   A few years ago, I learned of Locks Of Love and what their organization does for financially disadvantaged children who suffer from long-term hair loss.  I do not have much patience for growing my hair long (even though I do believe I look 'prettier' with long hair than with short hair...), but I did, so that I might donate hair to help a child who culd use it.  I told my friend Tanya about Locks Of Love, and suggested that her two young daughters consider making a donation...as the length of their hair was too much for Tia and Sharla to handle at the time.  I explained to Sharla and Tia what a donation to 'Locks Of Love' would do for other children.  Both Sharla and Tia ended up having their hair cut as well, and donated their ponytails.  It's been about three years now...  Sharla (9) and Tia (7) are older, and both, of their own accord, have told their Mom (Tanya) that they want to make another donation to 'Locks Of Love'.  I could just *HUG* those girls.  I'm going to take them in next week to get their hair cut.  As for myself, I do plan to make another donation to 'Locks Of Love', but only when I reach my goal weight.  I know what I look like with short hair...in my humble opinion (and that of many of my friends), not so hot.  Hair *does* grow.  I'd rather be a skinny chick with short hair...than a chunky chick with short hair.  One definitely looks better than the other.  I like the way I look with long hair...and plan to grow my hair long...and have it cut to donate to 'Locks Of Love'...for as long as I am able to.  Perhaps Tia, Sharla, and I might make this a special tradition every three years...?   Tresses, that wear Jewels, but to declare How much themselves more precious are.   - Richard Crashaw

      I injured my back in a car accident about a year and a half ago. I found out today that I likely have nerve damage/impinged nerves in my back. I had the same test a few months ago. I have not had the test results that were taken today formally interpreted yet, but I did see a comparison what a normal result *should* look like, and what my tests results were. There was a *major* discrepancy between what the results should look like, and what they actually were.   *SIGH*   I've been going to a chiropractor, and return to physical therapy next month. I'm taking Yoga, Water Aerobics, and a weight lifting class, on my own dime, because I want to get better ASAP. I am a beautiful, vibrant, funny, witty, energetic thirty-three year-old woman. I have not played softball in two years...and miss doing so.   I don't like sitting on my tush...and prefer to be proactive than reactive in my treatment. Wlite my weight is not the cause nor the reason I am having back problems, I know that it is not helping one bit. That is one of the reasons I am working on losing weight and becoming more fit.   I have not concentrated on weight-loss or fitness for a bit though. I've been working on the party for my parents and I'll admit that any thoughts of weight-loss have fallen to the side while I finish up the final preparations for the party.   I knew the party would be stressful, to an extent.&nbsp; I didn't mind *that* stress.&nbsp; I kind of enjoy that, in a way.&nbsp; I know what to do, how to do it, and like all the prep work.&nbsp; What has made it&nbsp;more stressful is that I have taken on the majority of the financial burden, when I initially thought it would be shared among myself and my three other siblings(as we had agreed).&nbsp; I don't regret having come up with the idea or taking this on.&nbsp; I can hardly wait to see the look on Mom and Dad's face when they see everything.&nbsp; More importantly...I can hardly wait until this is all over.   It's only four days until the party.&nbsp; After the party...I'll concentrate on myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     To be always intending to make a new and better life but never to find time to set about it is as to put off eating and drinking and sleeping from one day to the next until you're dead.     &nbsp;- Og Mandino

      I think it's funny, even hilarious, that my name is on an internet web site that sells sex toys...and I didn't have to take my clothes off...or be involved in some sort of scandal for that to happen.  Just because I wrote about that quote in my blog and about what I am looking for in a man does not mean I expect to be treated with any less the respect I deserve as an intelligent woman (alibet with an off-beat sense of humor).   To paraphrase Aretha Franklin, "All I'm askin' is for a little respect...".  What man thinks a woman is impressed with sleazy come-on lines?  Does any man out there think that speaking to my chest ***BEFORE*** looking me in the eyes is going to make me want to run off to Las Vegas with you, much less spend more than three seconds speaking to you???  Do you think I am going to ***SWOON*** with desire if you try to add me to your instant message list with an online name like, "nine_inches_limp"?????  How pathetic.  Really.  Whether it is a brag or a joke, to have a chat name like that is in poor taste, and reflects a shortcoming in emotional intelligence.   I'm guessing "nine_inches_limp" has read what I've written about the quote (which was a joke...submitted to an internet newsletter for humorous thoughts/ruminations) on the Canadian web site and decided he wants to make contact with me.  Would I add someone who uses the 'instant message' chat name, "nine_inches_limp" to my chat list?  Ummm...let me think about that for a second.  Second's up.  NO!  I don't think so.  "nine_inches_limp" needs to find a more respectful chat name, one which, if his Momma ever saw it, she wouldn't immediately wash her son's mouth out with soap.  Actually, the chat name "nine_inches_limp" remind me of a joke my friend John told me.  "Women take a look at my club and decide not to join."  I'm not so amused by some person who's chat name reflects his one-handed fixation (most likely with super glue) on a particular body part... At least this guy is broadcasting his stupidity to the world so that it makes him easy to avoid...

      It was at least two years ago that I applied for a promotions coordinator position at one of the local radio stations.  I can't imagine it was any time before that, as the car accident was back in January 2003  Anyway, out of the blue, a particular radio station called me, said that they had come across my resume, and want to interview me!!! :)  I *LOVE* working in radio...even though I have not worked in it on a full-time basis for years.  When I am working in radio, I gripe a bit...but you have to ignore the gripes...because I really do love working in radio *so* much.  It just gets a bit crazy sometimes.  I have stories back from my previous time in radio...that even I wouldn't believe had I not actually been there at the time! :)  Anyway...please cross your fingers, toes, and anything else that you can cross, for me. :)  I want this *so* much that I can feel it.    I wouldn't be 'on' the radio...but that's okay, as I have not been on air in a DJ capacity in about eight years.  Behind the scenes is good enough for me.  I love working with the public, and helping with event organization and client promotions would be a good thing.  It would also be sometthing great to throw on my resume before I move to Chicago in January 2006 (I'll have my bachelor degree in a year if I attend an accelerated program through a local Christian college...so I might as well tough out one more year in Me-suganah (Thanks to my friend Steve...who adapted the Yiddish word meshugen, which means crazy...  Steve is right that anyone who wants to live in the state of Me-suganah (Michigan) is meshugen to stay here! ;-)   "My heart ... will always beat just a little faster when the word radio is spoken."   - Mike Sheppard, Veteran deejay

      Royal Oak's best just left moments ago...  I heard someone walking behind my apartment window. The sound of what I heard was too heavy a foot to be any sort of wild animal. I'm convinced.  The policemen that arrived did a thorough search, and found no one in the vicinity. Thankfully so. I asked the officers if they saw any footprints in back. I was told that they saw a lot of cut weeds back there. My landlord just cut down all the brush and weeds behind my apartment...which would make most things difficult to see at this time of night.  I get nervous about these things. I had a 'Peeping Tom' attempt to watch me when I was in the shower a few years back. I had a good idea of who it was, a handyman that my landlord had hired to do some work around the apartments. An officer came to the apartment, saw footprints where the window for my shower is, and 'spoke' to the man in question. I didn't have a problem after that.  Did you know that it has been said 1 in 13 women will be stalked in their lifetime? I am in those statistics...which is another reason I am very cautious. Been there, done that, and could have written a book.  I've thought about having something on hand in my apartment for personal protection. I respect other's rights to own a gun. I do not want one in my apartment. I'd rather have a stun gun, a non-lethal way to take an attacker down. In the state of Michigan, it is illegal for anyone but law enforcement to possess them. I'm thinking about seeing what it would take to introduce an initiative that would make them legal in Michigan.  I know I'm rambling a bit.  Let me blame that on the hour at which I am writing this.  I am heading back to bed, and will see about having a motion detector light installed sometime this week.  If my landlord won't pay for it...I will.

      I'm blessed. I've been in quite a few car accidents. I think about eight, with only one of them being listed as my fault (Years ago, I trusted someone when motioned to drive across lanes of traffic and was broadsided...). Other people's cars seem drawn to me as a heat seeking missle might be drawn to, well, something emitting heat!  This is the first time I can remember that I've put the writing of another person on my blog. I received a prionted copy of this in my mail as a mailing from a local church. I found it reprinted online, but there is no attribution as to who the author of the piece is. For that reason, I am listing the author as the famously, much published, "Anonymous".  This one strikes home, as each time I've been in an auto accident, the first question my parents as is, "How is the car?, not "How are you?" Mom figures, if I am calling, I must be fine...   Recently I heard a story which really struck home. Apparently a woman was driving her husband’s classic BMW for a special appointment downtown. That car had been his life and joy. He spent hours finding original replacement parts, tuning the engine, fixing minor dents, and waxing the car. He worked on it a little time every Saturday and many evenings, but the car was a beauty.  As she drove the car, she thought what a joy it was, but suddenly someone changed lanes and nearly pulled into her. To avoid crashing she swerved to the right just as a big truck drove up beside her. She demolished the bumper and dented the fender of her husband’s car. What would he say? How could he ever forgive her? If she had only been a little more careful...  Shortly a policeman arrived to take an accident report. She got out her driver’s license and reached into the glove compartment to get the insurance papers and title. To her surprise there was another smaller envelope inside with her name on it. The writing was her husband’s. A fearful sweat suddenly hit her. What would it say? He had often warned her about driving more carefully. She opened the letter and began to read it.  Dear Laurie,If you are reading this, you have likely had an accident. Don’t worry. I trust this means you are all right, and that is what really matters to me. Don’t worry about the car, it’s only metal and rubber and plastic. You are what really matters to me.I love you. James  What a wise husband! He strengthened his wife’s love and admiration for him and his marriage and his potential for happiness and his self-respect and his... well, you see that it was a wise investment.Is there room for a note in your glove box?  ~Anonymous       "We ought not to treat living creatures like shoes or household belongings, which when worn with use we throw away." -- Plutarch, biographer (c. 46-120)

      What do I mean by that???  I picked up the last of my photos from Australia a few days ago, and bought a photo album to put them in on Monday.  I started organizing the photo album at 7:30PM. I just now finished it...at 1:25 AM.  I had to pare down 400 photos...as the album only holds 300 photos.  There were quite a few photos I could exclude.  No problem.  However, after putting the photos in chronological order, I found that I had miscounted, and had to go through each page, pulling out and rearranging the photos.  I'm glad it's done.  I need to put a few notes/captions up, but the majority of the work on the album is over.  I was going to put together an album for Neil...but have decided to send him the album, the photos, and let him do it on his own.  He also shot photos, and I think I'd rather leave it to Neil to put his photos in with the ones I took.  If there is anything this taught me...while I do believe that film cameras have advantages over digital cameras...my next major purchase is going to be an 8.0 megapixel digital camera.  I would like the option of deleting photos that weren't good...rather than paying for processing and having to toss the bad ones later...  Just looking back at the photos...it was a *wonderful* vacation.  *SIGH*  I think I need another one.  Right now.  ~ Michelle   No man needs a vacation so much as the person who has just had one.     ~Elbert Hubbard

      Fortunately, I can answer that I don't know the answer to that question.  I can say that I know what it's like to hit those orange road barrels.  I have no idea what bug was up this trucker's butt.  No idea at all.  I didn't do anythign illegal or anything that I would think would cause someone to want to run me off the road (not that there is ever any excuse to force someone's car off the road).  I needed to merge, and THREE times, he sped up so I could not get in front of him.  I couldn't slow down and go behind him due to traffic.  I was not in his blind spot either.  The man purposely ran me off the road.  I don't doubt that one bit.  It was either hit the orange barrels, or hit the semi.  I am lucky that I didn't go over the overpass.  Seriously.   The stupid thing about this was that I was able to follow him, get a description of the truck and his license plate...gave that information to the police...and they did nothing with the information  I was advised not to follow the trucker as he might be sleep-deprived, on drugs, become aggressive towards me if he saw that I was following him, or possibly cause another accident.  I was assured that someone was on their way to pull the trucker over...so I pulled off the highway to assess damage to my vehicle.  The damage???  Well, let's say that it's not worth reporting to the insurance company.  I hit barrels and it caused some body damage, but I was not injured in any way.  I called the police back to file a report so I could file charges against the trucker.  I was mad that I was run off the road like that, and that I could have been more seriously injured.  A police officer met up with me, advised me that the Flint Dispatch was really slow in giving him the information, and that as far as he knew, no officer was assigned to pull over the trucker who ran me off the road.  The officer ran the plate number I gav ehim...but nothing cam eup.  I don't know if this was because the truck had Wisconsin plates or what...  If I had been mortally wounded, we'd be talking about the top story on the 6PM newscast, and crucufication in the news of whatever caused the trucker to run me off the road, be it road rage, drugs, or sleep-deprivation.  Since I was not injured, all I got a sympathetic officer, and the bastard who ran me off the road got off scott-free.  Don't get me wrong.  I am glad that I am perfectly fine.  I am not at all happy that I gave the police everything they needed to catch this guy...and nothing was done.  I believe in karma, divine retribution, whatever you want to call it.  I am sure this guy will get his, and good, someday.  I simply hope that, between now and then, he does not kill someone..   It takes 8,460 bolts to assemble an automobile, and one nut to scatter it all over the road.  ~Author Unknown

      I was watching the end of the first Batman movie starring Michael Keaton...when I fondly reminisced about owning particular bubblegum trading cards with his profile on it (yummy...). I got to thinking about actors I think are attractive.  A few of the men on my list(I went back to a favorites book I wrote in back in 1993 for most of these names)??? Chris Noth. Alan Rickman. Christopher Walken. Michael Keaton. David Bowie. Gene Wilder. Donald Sutherland. Kenneth Branaugh. Ricardo Montalban. Tom Conte. Hugh Grant. Dick Van Dyke. Gene Kelly.  With the exception of Dick Van Dyke and Gene Kelly, the portrayals of characters I found intriguing were of those where the above listed actors were playing characters who were emotionally unavailable, elusive, or in some fundamental way, missing something elemental.  Now...I'm going to make an admission here. With the exception of Neil, the men I've cared for or dated are the same way.  Let me take this one step further...and state for the record that I've come to the harsh realization that I've been attracted to men who are emotionally like my Dad. I believe I'd been trying to 'fix' whatever it was, either in the person, or in myself.  I do want to state for the record that I dearly love my Dad. I'm simply writing about the fact that I, like any other child, tend to be attracted to persons with similar (in ways) traits that my parents possess. I'm an amalgomation of both my parents, not to mention external influences, my personality, the decisions I've made, etc. I don't want this to sound as if I am simply laying blame at my Dad's feet for any decisions I've made.  I'm not.  I wrote back in the June 22nd entry that I wasn't dating because I'm too busy right now. This is not entirely true.  I made a purposeful decision not to date anyone back in October 2003. I decided I wanted to take a year off from dating so I might have time to reflect on my 'patterns'. Consciously or subconsciously, everyone has patterns when it comes to actions, reactions, decisions, things we are attracted to and repulsed by. It's scientifically proven fact (I'm not going to write a thesis in this blog on the subject. If you want more information, go do a 'google').  I want more from life. I definitely want and deserve more in a relationship than what my past history has shown. It's not that all my relationships were bad. On the contrary. There were recurring issues that I do not want to reoccur in any future relationship I become involved in (mainly the emotional unavailability...I gotta stop dating engineers.). I left on a friendly basis in all my relationships, and remain friends with a few of these men,(who are close friends, to this very day).  I'm not saying I don't come with my own set of issues and problems. The nice thing about me is that I am cognizant of that and work daily towards becoming the best Michelle I can possibly be. The big thing I've been working on is the fact I often take care of and treat others better than I treat myself. If you don't treat yourself with love and respect, who will? I decided almost a year ago, that it was time to take action. The big thing for me this year has been to find a balance between my relationships with the people I love, and the relationship I have with myself. I think I'm almost at the point where I can say I've found that balance. I don't feel so guilty for putting my needs first, and indulging myself in the things I enjoy. It's about time.  ~ Michelle  P.S. I couldn't choose, so you get two quotes today.   When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves.  ~Victor Frankl    After you've done a thing the same way for two years, look it over carefully.  After five years, look at it with suspicion.  And after ten years, throw it away and start all over.     ~Alfred Edward Perlman, New York Times, 3 July 1958
