       The snow storm that skipped Boston. It will be icy as the artic tommorrow. Could somebody stop by our house and salt our driveway? Oh thanks your such a wonderfull person. Maiko actually stopped by the house yesterday. Then I heard her say that she was going home, ie the boyfriends house. Can't remember his name. Maiko, a little help? Ah well I should really be going to sleep.

       Ok now we have a weblog. Just need to fix some bugs and then set this up for the rest of the house. The plan is to let anyone in the house post here at anytime in the day, messages to the rest of us or to the world. Giulio can start putting his sentence of the day here, and the rest of us can stop sending goofy emails to each other and instead send goofy messages to each other that the whole world can read.

       Needs: Money for oil bill. Love. Loss of 30 pounds. Creativity. Confidence.  urlLink XTC.   "Dear God, sorry to disturb you but...." Love this song.  To keep in mind now that California is going power hungry.  urlLink Maine Solar House  this house just has it all. When I get ready to design my own house it will definitely be more like this one. So unlike the Brentwood house. We have no insulation, windows that are from the '50s at the latest but which I think have been there since the '30s, old gas lighting hookups in almost all the rooms. And an oil burner that does little to keep us warm, mostly due to heat loss from the non insulation.

       God I love net Radio. Listening to the  urlLink Nothing Records  selection of tracks right now, I just wish I had a faster internet connection. Everyone I call keeps saying "I'm sorry we are not set up in your area at this time" ugh. Allston, Mass. I guess I will be spending more time in the senior design lab now, got a nice and nifty ethernet connection to the world thanks to BU, its good to see that the $120,000 that I, and lets not forget the parents and the govt, have spent is going to good use. The new Depeche Mode albulm is called Exciter for those who care.  urlLink DMDOTCOM . Ciao.

       Well we have a slight roommate loss. Jeff moved out rather unexpectally. Maiko still "lives" here but wants to move out furniture. Ugh. I still have to set up accounts for the rest of them and now that blogger is a little faster that will be easier. School started today. Found out who my project team was. We are all the people in the class who didn't start a group of our own, but whom all recieved the highest grades on our individual projects last semester. We now have to pick one of those projects and make it our Team project. I'll tell you all later which plane we decide to design.

       Well I gave Giulio and Maiko access to the blog and they haven't logged on yet, prob cause they are losers. Maiko wanted to have a house dinner at Pho Pasteur tonite but I had to work and G had something to do too.  Well our new roommate moved in, and I finally met him on tuesday, he is William PH Johnson. Bill, I don't know what the PH stands for so please enlighten.   Now I just need to update the page, I still have no data for Alexis let alone Bill, so maybe I'll need to remedy that but I have too much work to do, my first presentation is on Thursday and the written aspect of that is due Tuesday. I'll be in the lab till 4 am or maybe 6 tonight (tommorrow). bye.

       Sentence of everyother day: Ok, I'm back; in Dutch would be ''Ik ben terug'', as I learned watching the movie Awakenings on TV - here in Holland,  movies are shown in the original language, with subtitles; that's why everybody speaks English so well -.  That's De Niro's line after coming out of a thirty year sleep.   And I guess that's the first sentence of everyother day: ''Ik ben terug''.

        Things I love Early in the Morning   1) The doorbell ringing at 8 AM.  2) The doorbell ringing at 8 AM when you don't have to be into work til 11:30.  3) A roommate answering the door, but only after you decide that you have to answer it and so you get out of bed, but before you get downstairs you hear the front door being opened.  4) A carpenter knocking on your Door at 8:30 AM so that he can take window measurements, after you have fallen back to sleep.  5) The fact that even while half asleep you know that the 2 windows in your room are different sizes, and have to tell this to the carpenter, who has only measured 1 window, and has just said, "well, they are both the same size so you don't have to move those plants."

Love brings ecstasy - ecstasy so great that I would often have sacrificed all the rest of life for a few hours of this joy... in the union of love I have seen, in a mystic miniature, the prefiguring vision of the heaven that saints and poets have imagined.

Do not say this is impossible: it is not. It waits only for men to desire it more than the infliction of torture. There is an artist imprisoned in each one of us.

       What Giulio wanted to say: "Your navel is as delicious as a goblet filled with wine, your belly is lovely...you are tall and slim like a palm tree, and your breasts are like its clusters of dates."  What came out of his mouth: "Your breasts are like clusters of dates. It is so damn repulsive. Its like, I don't even know what its like. Christ get a boob job. Yes I'm breaking up with you! You have a pot belly. You have lumpy hard breasts. Get a mammogram. Ugh, why did I ever sleep with you."   Happy belated b-day Jeff.

       It was really great to go back to Boston and see many old friends. I stayed at the legendary 53 Brentwood Mansion, home of Mike, Doug, Alex, Hide, and Edgar... it took me two weeks to recover from the Pizza Parties organized by my housemates, evenings spent in pubs, 'grandi abbuffate' (that is, eating a lot) at Bob (my thesis' advisor), at Mike (my other advisor), at Kali and Shaju (my friends), at my former house, with Alex&Alex (the first Alex is my favourite one), Boccelli's concert, one night at Kinko's printing up my thesis, and all that stuff. Thank you a lot. So back in Holland: yesterday with my roommate we went to a party in Rotterdam (almost 2 hours driving from the city where I live): the party was in a house in the middle of the Red District, where basically you can legally buy sex and drugs in the so-called coffee shops. The party was great. We left around 2 in the morning, and before hitting the road we really needed a coffee but in all those coffee shops, at 2 in the morning, the only things you can buy is sex and drugs, no coffee! What kind of coffee shops are those? a big hug to everybody, g.  urlLink http://www.roz.org/flash/bear.swf  (courtesy of Stamatios)

Just here, in this little gem (Nijmegen) in the center of Europe, where I ended up, once a year something really amazing happens: approximately 40,000 people,  coming from all over Europe, walk 50 km per day, for 4 days! Other 500,000 people flood the city,  because everynite it’s a party in the streets of Nijmegen. I’ll join the 500,000 drinkers,  rather than the 40,000 walkers; maybe next year I’ll walk…   http://www.4daagse.nl/

       Dutch: tricky language. Sounds easy, but it isn’t at all! BOTER means butter, pretty easy, right? HAM means ham, this is also easy... and then we got BOTERHAM  which means… bread!!!! Where is the logic? Yes, it is true that we might sometimes put some butter or ham on top of a piece of bread, but is this a good reason to call the bread in this way? It’s like calling a woman ‘Hey man’,  just because sometime she might have a man on top of her …

       There is always a first time. I am an 'Invited Speaker'. It’s my first time. It never happened to me that somebody would ask: Giulio, would you like to talk? Or: Giulio, please keep talking. As far as I remember, I’ve been alwyas invited to shut up (mostly in a cordial way). Anyway, this time I have been invited to talk in a conference. The topic is: ‘MRI and PAIN, past and future’. What do I know about MRI? I studied some of it. What do I know about PAIN? Well, I was in  the 53 Brentwood Mansion for many years…

       Had a discussion over the weekend with some friends about cockroaches. And it occured to me that in the couple of years I was visiting and living at 53 Brentwood, I never once saw a cockroach, which is pretty incredible under the circumstances - I mean, we were pretty clean, but that house seems like it would be an ideal target for them, don't you think? Easy access, etc etc.

        After that he went to bed and fell asleep.  As he slept, he dreamed of his Fairy, beautiful, smiling, and happy, who kissed him and said to him:  "Bravo, Pinocchio!  In reward for your kind heart, I forgive you for all your old mischief.  Boys who love and take good care of their parents when they are old and sick, deserve praise even though they may not be held up as models of obedience and good behavior.  Keep on doing so well, and you will be happy."

       --- As soon as they reached the shore, Pinocchio was the first to jump to the ground to help his old father. Then he turned to the fish and said to him:  "Dear friend, you have saved my father, and I have not enough words with which to thank you!  Allow me to embrace you as a sign of my eternal gratitude."  The Tunny stuck his nose out of the water and Pinocchio knelt on the sand and kissed him most affectionately on his cheek.    At this warm greeting, the poor Tunny, who was not used to such tenderness, wept like a child. He felt so embarrassed and ashamed that he turned quickly, plunged into the sea, and disappeared. --------

       Yesterday is gone, so many things have changed in one year, in the world and in my personal life…  …so, as I told you  I’m back to Holland, i.e., North Europe. The new Begnini’s movie ‘Pinocchio’is coming out.  Let’s connect this two events, i.e, North Europe and children's literature; there is an interesting book by Paul Hazard: Books, Children and Men. He pointed out an interesting issue: "In the matter of literature for children the North surpasses the South by a large margin."  It is really true, Spain,Italy, France, Greece, cannot compete with the children's literature of England, Scotland, Germany, and Scandinavian countries… Why is that? I'll tell you tomorrow.

       ‘Balls’. I like balls. Anyway, I’m back from Italy. Two weeks of rain, floods and all that shit.  I went ot Trento, to visit my sister and her new child, Paola. One day my sister went out for some errands and left me alone with this two-week-old baby. Just after my sister left, Paola started crying. What do you do when a little thing like that starts crying? Where is the manual with the instructions? Didn’t know what to do… then I lied down, put her on my chest, with her head on my neck and we fell asleep together. It was the sweetest sleep.

       ‘Living abroad facilitates treating life as a spectacle…’  That’s from the last novel I read, ‘The volcano lover’ by Susan Sontag. The volcano here is the Vesuvio, in Naples, not the Etna.  By the way, the Etna is getting nasty…

       Back to Nijmegen! Last week I was first in S. Cruz, for a conference, then S. Francisco and finally in Boston, to meet my old friends. I didn’t have the chance to meet all of them, because I stayed there only for a couple of days.  Anyway, Doug, Edgar, Hide, Mike and Sasha, thanks so much for let me stay at 53 Brentwood, I just love that place and the people who live and lived there.   The sentence of the day is: Love is all we need.  P.S. Nijmegen is in The Netherlands.

       ‘And still today one seldom finds that people come to great things without they first go somewhat astray…’ Meister Eckhart.   So… we (myself and few friends I know) have a lot of potential to do great things,  as we went astray for a long time!  The trick is to live long enough, in order to  be able to do great things after gone astray. And in this respect today we are pretty limited. In the old days, on the other hand, things were easier. You could go astray for a couple of hundred years and still have time to get your shit together and do great things.  In fact,  we read in the Bible always things like:  “When Mahalalel had lived 65 years, he became the father of Jared. And after he became the father of Jared, Mahalalel lived 830 years and had other sons and daughters. Altogether, Mahalalel lived 895 years, and then he died.”  If I’m lucky, I don’t have more than fifty years left !

       About the Universe and being somewhere in the Universe. This is Meister Eckhart (1260-1340), one of the great Christian mystics. “He who is right in his feeling is right in any place and in any company, but if he is wrong, he finds nothing right wherever or with whom he may be.”    And now Meister Eckhart politically correct. “He or she who is right in his or her feeling is right in any place and in any company, but if he or she is wrong, he or she finds nothing right wherever or with whom he or she may be.” … doesn’t sound that good…

       Maybe most of you don't know that here, in this little gem in the center of Europe where I live, and to be more precise in the lobby of the hospital where I work, there is a huge, huge wooden elephant. Huge, I mean just as big as real elephant.  A Loxodonta Africana. I haven't understood why they put it there. I have asked around, they said that they liked it, so they put it in the lobby of the hospital.  Elephant lovers.  If you are an elephant lover, you should really really come and see this. By now I know Loxodonta pretty well, I can tell you everything about her. It's a little bit like the Pinocchio's story, however reversed.

       Mike is funny, as always...  Most funny joke in US ( according  urlLink  http://www.laughlab.co.uk  )  A man and a friend are playing golf one day at their local golf course. One of the guys is about to chip onto the green when he sees a long funeral procession on the road next to the course. He stops in mid-swing, takes off his golf cap, closes his eyes, and bows down in prayer. His friend says: “Wow, that is the most thoughtful and touching thing I have ever seen. You truly are a kind man.” The man then replies: “Yeah, well we were married 35 years.”

What can I do?” The operator, in a calm soothing voice says: “Just take it easy. I can help. First, let's make sure he's dead.” There is a silence, then a shot is heard.

Yes, my friends Shaju and Sujata are expecting their second baby!  Years ago, at our parties,  I would play the joke of saying that Sujata was pregnant, everybody would congratulate her, when it actually wasn’t true; well this time it’s true, congratulations. I’m going to buy them a television, or a radio or something like that, so in the long evenings they’ll have the option to do something else….

Everybody saw her coming, so they moved away … while I found myself still, face to face with her… the security people were a bit embarrassed and probably scared, about the fact that the Queen had to pass by me…

        Marriage as a long conversation.    When marrying, one should ask oneself this question: do you believe that you  will be able to converse well with this woman (man) into your old age? Everything else in marriage is transitory, but the most time during the association belongs to conversation. (Friedrich Nietzsche)

The Children's Hospital Boston family has lost another familiar face. N. L., who worked for 18 years at the *** Dept., died Sunday. She was 61.  She is survived by six children, nine grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.    I’m pretty sure that the few thousand employees  who received this e-mail were wondering, and trying to do some math on this situation: ..ok, she was 61, with six children, nine grandchildren seven great-grandchildren .. wow, she must have had the first daughter at 16 .. and then the daughter was pregnant at .. and bla bla.   Actually I spend 15 minutes discussing this math with my colleagues..   One hour later, second e-mail    An error was made in the previous e-mail. N. L. had only one granddaughter and no great-grandchildren.

       When Bill and Hillary first got married Bill said, "I am putting a box under the bed. You must promise never to look in it." In all their 30 years of marriage Hillary never looked. However, on the afternoon of their 30th anniversary, curiosity got the best of her and she lifted the lid and peeked inside. In the box were 3 empty beer cans and $81,874.25 in cash. She closed the box and put it back under the bed. Now that she knew what was in the box, she was doubly curious as to why. That evening they were out for a special dinner. After dinner Hillary could no longer contain her curiosity and she confessed, saying, "I am so sorry. For all these years I kept my promise and never looked into the box under our bed. However,today the temptation was too much and I gave in. But now I need to know, why do you keep the cans in the box?" Bill thought for a while and said, "I guess after all these years you deserve to know the truth. Whenever I was unfaithful to you I put an empty beer can in the box under the bed to remind myself not to do it again." Hillary was shocked, but said, "Hmmm, Jennifer, Paula and Monica. I am very disappointed and saddened but temptation does happen and I guess that 3 times is not that bad considering the years." They hugged and made their peace. A little while later Hillary asked Bill, "So why do you have all that money in the box?" Bill answered, "Well, whenever the box filled up with empty cans, I took them to the recycling center and redeemed them for cash.

        Finally.   That’s it.   I found the best dive bar in Nijmegen. It took me a while, but finally I found it.   To find the best dive bar in a city is like to find your partner, you know right away that he/she is the one. At least temporarily.   This place really looks like the Silhouette Lounge in Allston. Smokey, crappy, with a bartender who seems some sort of alien from Men in Black.  Yesterday with some friends we played darts there for a few hours.

       I always vowed when I was a kid that I would never wear a tie to work. So far I've been in the workforce for ten years and I still haven't had to wear a tie to work. I did wear a very thin, black leather tie one time when I worked at a supermarket back when I was about 16. But that's all.

       Talking about the Great War, World War I.   My grandfather emigrated to USA at the beginning of last century (he ended up in Littleton, in the middle of nowhere in Massachusetts). He was then sent back to Europe to fight the Great War, and became World War I veteran.   That's it.

       I just got the flu. Just the flu…  In 1918 the ‘Spanish Flu’ killed something like 30–40 million people in one year. In Europe, China, Africa, USA, everywhere. One million people died in the States.   The ‘Spanish Flu’ killed more people than World War I.  Thinking that a little thing such as a virus or a bacterium (so little we cannot even see it) can kill a person… I just don’t get it.

        Unbelievable!   In the middle of the 14th century, in less than 20 years the bubonic plague  (Black Death)  killed more than half the population of Europe and Asia. “The living did not suffice to bury the dead”.  Anyway, I got sick last week, probably just flu. Now I feel better.

I'm once again in the house of 53 Brentwood house (this time in the form of Blog)!  Greetings to everyone.   Yes, Casey and I got married (and we are not pregnant, thank you), and this is the first place to use my new last name!      Todays' news: Mars has water, but it's not drinkable. It's kind of like our 'real/fake' wedding two days ago.  We had champaign, but it was frozen if you didn't drink it fast enough.  Drinking fast also kept us warm.  Jeff,  I went to your website.  I love it!  Nice picture with your friend Ronnie McD.  Looks like you guys were bonding pretty well.  Lotsa love, Maiko  p.s. Mike, thank you for your pretty vase.  Giulio, thank you for your beutiful flowers. They are together in 'love harmony' right now.  Whatever that means.  p.p.s. Mike, why don't you extend the invitation to Chris Darrell?

       Unfortunately after such funny news (A German circus director on the run with his elephant), such a sad news, the death of 7 astronauts. It is a sad day, for the death of those astronauts;  It would be naive to think now that space flights are not safe anymore: they never were!! Many people don't realize that  1) Computers, airplanes, wings, all these things are man-made; so they are not perfect and can break. 2) Space flights, no matter what NASA people tell you, have still a high experimental component, with always a high risk of failure associated with it. Think about that today, even normal airplanes still crash for pure technical reason.

And I  also love news like this:  BERLIN, Germany (Reuters) --   A German circus director is on the run with his elephant  after breaking a local ban on moving the deeply distressed animal, police say.   Officials had ordered the director not to move the elephant, Kenia,  because she was upset by the death of Rani, the circus's other elephant.  Police said Wednesday the man and beast had disappeared without trace.   "It's easier to hide an elephant than you might think," a police spokesman said.

       You have a point on the Apache story. Just yesterday we were discussing this stuff with some friends; it could easily be Saddam propaganda, in  order to encourage people to fight, by showing that a farmer can shoot down an Apache. But in any case, you (Mike) are not the average American, who usually just watches CNN and reads The Herald.

       You are a little late on this one G. The US papers and news don't show pictures of captured US soldiers  until  their families are notified. You don't want to be flicking through the channells and find out that your son is captured. Once the military notifies the family then the US shows the pictures on TV. All of the capstured soldiers have been shown by now on TV as their families have been notified.  There is also no way an A[pache can be shot down with a rifle, it was anti-aircraft fire.   And I read and watch BBC news, NYTimes, Drudgereport, pravda, The Times, and various other sources.

        I can't believe it, now there is even the censorship on US television, that is, it's prohibited to show images of American soldiers prisoners!  Now USA is exactly like countries such as the good old Russia, China, Irak and Iran...  I don't know which war you are watching  in US, but I have the feeling that it's quite different from the war we are watching on TV here in Europe. An interview with a toothless Iraqi farmer who shot down an Apache helicopter which is as expensive as a small hospital, with a rifle as old as me. Anyway...  I just feel bad for the poor soldiers (American and Iraqi) and civilians (only Iraqi) who are dying right now because of decisions taken by a couple of shitheads.

        Robert Graves    A Pinch of Salt   WHEN a dream is born in you   With a sudden clamorous pain, When you know the dream is true   And lovely, with no flaw nor stain, O then, be careful, or with sudden clutch         You’ll hurt the delicate thing you prize so much. 	  Dreams are like a bird that mocks,   Flirting the feathers of his tail. When you seize at the salt-box   Over the hedge you’ll see him sail.         Old birds are neither caught with salt nor chaff: They watch you from the apple bough and laugh.  Poet, never chase the dream.   Laugh yourself and turn away. Mask your hunger, let it seem         Small matter if he come or stay; But when he nestles in your hand at last, Close up your fingers tight and hold him fast.

       So you guys are like.. related and stuff.  That means you two could have been cousins-in-law.  Giulio, I'm not sure why you told us that story, but here is my story.  My family name comes from this one town in Japan near Mount Fuji.  My father has talked with alot of Yoda's from around Japan, but their ancesters also seem to come from the same area.    And among the Yodas from this family is a Sony's director.  During the making of Star Wars, Spilberg worked with George Lucas (I'm not sure which episodes, but I think the first couple) and had an opening for the name of the little green guy.  Spilberg was speaking to Mr. Yoda (the Sony director) and asked if he could use his unusual name for an unusual character.  That's how Yoda the Jedi Master was named.    So technically... to the Yoda green guy, related I am.

She was on a mission....   M also told me that she remembers someone pushing the shopping cart with her inside it really really fast.  It seemed like a good idea at the time to her. Next thing you know, she was on the ground and she has no memory of falling.  Oh... I just remembered.  G's talking about the 70's night with the Chianti, aren't you! Ha ha, Oops.  No need to dig holes here.  Not to change the subject or anything, but AM must have had about 30 people in her room trying to see whether she's ok, or just to see if she'll do anything interesting.  Hmm.  There must be something about you guys...  I just can't think of one right now. Oh, I remember.  Who was kissing who on the 70's night?   If you remember, you're the winner!!!    Ha!!!

        This reminded me of our 53 Brentwood neighbourhood...   From The Washington Post.   … There is too much disputation around Christmas anyway. One growing issue is the white vs. colored lights debate. Like all matters of taste, this is also a matter of class. White lights are high-class; colored lights are somewhat less so. White lights make the statement that one is a refined sort who appreciates that less is more and who celebrates Christmas (and life in general) in such a fashion that one would not be absolutely mortified if Martha Stewart dropped by unexpectedly for tea. Colored lights make the statement that one is the sort of person who believes that Christmas is not Christmas without an electric sled and reindeer on the lawn, an electric Santa on the roof, an electric Frosty by the front gate and an electric Very Special Person in a manger on the porch. Most of the houses in my neighborhood are white-light houses, and I have to admit they are lovely, but I was raised in a colored-light family, and I am raising Tom and Jack to be colored-light men too. They do not take a lot of convincing on this. Boys are naturally colored-lighters.   Michael Kelly, who died Friday while covering the war in Iraq, wrote a weekly column for this page. Editorial  published Dec. 12, 2001.

        From  The Washington Post  .   Michael Kelly, the Atlantic Monthly editor-at-large and Washington Post columnist who abandoned the safety of editorial offices to cover the war in Iraq, was killed while traveling with the Army's 3rd Infantry Division .   I am Catholic and my wife is Jewish, so in our house we celebrate both Hanukah and Christmas, which our sons, Tom and Jack, regard as an excellent thing. People sometimes ask me if it is hard to raise children in respect and love for two great faiths that have a slight doctrinal disagreement between them, and I say: Not if you give them presents every day for eight days of Hanukah and for Christmas. The more Gods, the merrier is Tom and Jack's strong belief.  Michael Kelly

        Meet the characters of 'Catch 22': Dunbar.  Dunbar was lying motionless on his back again with his eyes staring up at the ceiling like a doll's. He was working hard at increasing his life span. He did it by cultivating boredom. Dunbar was working so hard at increasing his life span that Yossarian thought he was dead... Dunbar liked Clevinger because Clevinger annoyed him and made time go slow.

" They're trying to kill me ," Yossarian told him calmly.  " No one's trying to kill you ," Clevinger cried. " Then why are they shooting at me ? Yossarian asked. " They're shooting at everyone, they're trying to kill everyone ," Clevinger answered. "  An what difference does that make  ?" Yossarian asked.  Yossarian had proof, because strangers he didn't know shot at him with cannons every time he flew up into the air to drop bombs on them, and it wasn't funny at all.

       It seems that SARS is back in Toronto. Here some facts about death rates of diseases…   Worldwide, the death rate for SARS is approximately 6 percent. Reliable death rates are available for the flu. In a typical year, it is usually below 1 percent.  The Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-19 had a death rate estimated to have been about 2 percent. It killed perhaps 25 million people worldwide because it quickly swept the globe and infected millions. Ebola has a mortality rate of 70 percent to 95 percent and for this reason does not spread easily, therefore the overall number of people who die is low.

       Meet the characters of 'Catch 22'...    Major Major    Major Major had been born too late and too mediocre. Some men are born mediocre, some men achieve mediocrity, and some men have mediocrity thrust upon them. With Major Major it had been all three. Even among men lacking all distinction he inevitably stood out as a man lacking more distinction than all the rest, and people who met him were always impressed by how unimpressive he was. He was polite to his elders, who disliked him. Whatever his elders told him to do, he did. They told him to look before he leaped, and he always looked before he leaped…  Since he had nothing better to do well in, he did well in school. At the state university he took his studies so seriously that he was suspected by the homosexuals of being a Communist and suspected by the Communists of being a homosexual. He majored in English history.   Joseph Heller, Catch 22.

Mike, I read about your road trip.  Cool!  Casey and I were to go cross-country when our destination was still considered as Alaska or New Mexico.  Maybe you can come see us in DC if you're going that way. Well, I guess it's not as exciting as Oregon, and it seems like you're going to lower east coast pretty soon.

       2 Things:  1)   Room available . Starting on September 1st at the wonderful abode. Know anyone in or around or interested in Boston and they need a room. Then tell them to email me or checkout the  urlLink craigslist spot .  Update: Room filled. Katherine, a BU Comp Sci PhD student will be moving in on the first.   2) Sascha and Alex moved out while I was on my trip.  Alex is also pregnant . She is due in 6 weeks. So while I was gone for 40 days Alex went through 7 months of labor. Rather odd.

       If you came this way,  Taking the route you would be likely to take  From the place you would be likely to come from,  If you came this way in may time, you would find the hedges  White again, in May, with voluptuary sweetness.  It would be the same at the end of the journey,  If you came at night like a broken king,  If you came by day not knowing what you came for,  It would be the same, when you leave the rough road  And turn behind the pig-sty to the dull facade  And the tombstone. And what you thought you came for  Is only a shell, a husk of meaning  From which the purpose breaks only when it is fulfilled  If at all. Either you had no purpose  Or the purpose is beyond the end you figured  And is altered in fulfilment. There are other places  Which also are the world's end, some at the sea jaws,  Or over a dark lake, in a desert or a city...  Little Gidding, T. S. Eliot.

       Keywords: Nijmegen, San Menaio, distance = 2000 km (1200 miles), Kawasaki KLR 250, Giulio.   That’s probably all. Yes, I went to Southern Italy from Holland by bike. Two days travel, 1200 miles to get there, other two days travel, other 1200 miles to come back. On the way I saw plenty of bikers riding big 650 cc or 1000cc BMW, Ducati and so on. My 250 cc bike was the smallest bike on the road, but it brought me to Italy and back. The Northern part of Italy is just half way between Nijmegen and San Menaio. The Alps, seen from a bike, were just beautiful.  My vacation was ‘just’ S.S., that is, sun and sea.

       I understand what you mean.  I'm sure your house is nice.  We're close to the city, but settling for 1/2 of a four story row-house in DC.  It's a trade off thing.  (but coming from 1BR apartment in Boston, this one is pretty good)  I knew some people who lived there in Maynard.  Now they're in Portland, OR. (not OH)  I think they like it there alot.  Have fun decorating!

       You're lying! Congratz, Jeff!  We're in the process of looking for a place to buy ourselves.  But since we like to live close to the city in DC, the best we can do is probably a townhouse, but it will still be a house!  We're looking pretty hard right now.  Which area is your house in?

       The incredible couple,  B1&B2 .  At least 64 Americans have been killed since  B1  declared the end of the war two months ago.  And that’s how  B1  says: "There are some who feel that the conditions are such that they can attack us there… My answer is:  Bring 'em on . We've got the force necessary to deal with the security situation."    Now  B2 .  He  told to the German politician Martin Schulz: "I know in Italy there is a producer, producing a film on Nazi concentration camps.  I will suggest you for the role of kapo  (commander). You would be perfect for that role."

       Well, this is NOT from the Koran…  For if a woman does not have her head veiled,  she may as well have her hair cut off.  But if it is shameful for a woman to have her head shaved, then she should wear a veil.  A man, on the other hand, should not cover his head,  because he is the image and glory of God  .. but from the Bible(1 Corinthians 11:6)

       Ummm, just remember if we ever have a Scrabble reunion game, we use the Scrabble dictionary for checking words.

The rest are just words that Chaucer made up and no one else have ever used. Damn, dirty Chaucer.

       I remember this one time I woke up at like 3:30am and I heard the scant pitter-patter of little footsteps in the walls, right near the head of my bed. I sat up, curious as to what may have been going on - was a mother squirrel bringing acorns up to her young? (As an aside, the squirrel probably got the acorns from the basement or maybe even the first floor). Anyway, I got up and quietly went upstairs, following the faint pitter patter of footsteps and I snuck up on the cage.........and it was Guilio! He was in the cage, laughing and drinking a little thing of espresso! Caught in the walls!  Does anyone remember when Guilio tried to use the word "wopen" in Scrabble? I will never forget it........

       This is from  The Copenhagen Post , 14 august 2003.  A young Italian tourist was murdered and is the latest victim in a long list of violent assaults. Copenhagen's reputation as a safe and peaceful place to visit lay in tatters this week, as police hunted for the murderers of a young Italian backpacker who was savagely stabbed to death in the Norrebro district of Copenhagen over the weekend.  Witnesses said that he became involved in a violent confrontation with two youths, possibly as the victim of a mugging.  He was stabbed in the ribs.  After struggling free, Giurra ran towards a taxi stopped at the Blogardsgade-boulevarden junction.   He showed the taxi-driver his bloody stab-wounds and pleaded with him to call the police.Three young passengers in the taxi claimed they did not have a mobile phone - which later proved to be false - whilst the taxi driver said he was unable to summon assistance, 'because his radio wasn't warmed up.'  Giurra continued along Aboulevarden. Once again, he was confronted by his attackers who, this time, stabbed him repeatedly until he collapsed in a pool of blood.  Although paramedics managed to keep him alive, Giurra died in hospital the next day.

And the reason why you find the fact that they are half your age disturbing is because... you can't date them?  Sure you can!!  Nothing stands between lovers!!  Go for it!

The secret service guys I have seen up close all look to be about half my age, and I find this disturbing on many levels.     Oh, by the way, Melanie's dance company is having their big world premiere performance next weekend at Lincoln Center.  Anyone who's going to be in New York should come.  Here's their website:  http://home.earthlink.net/~eidolon_ballet_in_concert/eidolon/home.htm

       Maiko went from college to thinking about Business school to re-entering high school.  I, for those of you who don't know, am working in the IT department at Fisher College. I worked 6 hours on Friday, 14 hours on Monday and 10 hours today. I have to be at work at 8am. It is now very late, but I had darts, so its OK.

       1.2 million people just in DC lost power due to hurricane Isabel on Thursday.  By Monday morning, a quarter million people still had not regained electricity.  Luckily I didn't lose power at all.   Some people had cold water, no electricity, and some had to boil water just to wash dishes with it.    DC public school was still closed today (monday).  Some schools in VA were also closed today, and my high school had a 2 hour delay...  But of course I did not find out until I was on my way there.  So I slept in the car for over an hour. Now tell me that I wasn't the only dummy who did that.  Tell me!

Drink beer???  Play Scrabble?? Bring Scrabble board to the table??  Does he do anything!?  Any info on Tricky is appreciated, since he apparently lives with us now (or inside my left earlobe??)

       Here’s some advice from  Samuel Butler  on how to raise a child (for you, Maiko, how to raise Tricky).   When asked to give a rule of life for the son of a friend he said, "Do not let him try and find out who wrote the letters of Junius."  Pressed for further counsel he added, "Nor yet who was the man in the iron mask"--and he would say no more.  Don't bore people.

       G is posting lyrics to " urlLink Big Rock Candy Mountain " which is an old folk bluegrass song and is featured in  urlLink O Brother. Where Art Thou?   Maiko is indeed insane. Before she moved out of the house we surgically grafted Tricky onto her left frontal lobe. Casey was not amused. This was the the easiest way that we could think of to get Tricky out of the house for good (he was starting to eat the brick house supports in the basement). The only drawback, other than driving Maiko insane that is, was that Tricky will be Maiko and Casey's first born.

       Yeah, it was great living at 53 when things were fixed fast and right.   Not like this place I am living at now, there has been this leak from the second floor bathroom that goes straight into the kitchen, causing the ceiling to slowly fall down to the floor. Also for like the past 8 years there has been a leak in the front hall, and there is this pile of sticks and tree limbs in the same spot in the back yard. Boy I wish I still lived at 53 where stuff like that was fixed fast.  At least there are no squirrels in the walls.  Maiko, I get commissions cause I'm cool like that, cause I'm down like that, cause I have an  urlLink Amazon Associate  account like that.

       "......This home owning biz is alot of headache. The newly installed toilet is leaking. ... hmmm It's clean but wet, and leaking to the lower level room. "  ah for the good old days when we would just tell a certain landlord about something like this, and it would get fixed right away.  And I mean immediately - sometimes within the hour!  Remember?    Kind of like that huge mound of trash that was once in the back yard for about 10 minutes (or do I mean months?)  Or the squirrel-sized WWF wrestling ring that was apparently located directly above my bed?  Or that portion of the kitchen ceiling that kept falling off . . .  Ok, all silliness aside, sorry to hear about the toilet, Maiko, but I hope the rest of the place is cool.

       Mike, How do you get commission from Giulio buying a book on the Amazon?  I don't get it.  I actually read this book at the bookstore.  It's kind of scary looking.  I think I'd have nightmares if I was a child reading that book. (but it has a funny ending.)  Where is DJ Anan by the way???  As for Scrabble, I don't remember many of the words that G and I managed to create, but I do remember kicking ass (maybe that was my own team mate Giulio's ass)!  ...This home owning biz is alot of headache.  The newly installed toilet is leaking. ... hmmm  It's clean but wet, and leaking to the lower level room.  At Brentwood, the squirrels also conducted a all-night full-sprint running contest that usually ended with some sort of a wrestling match.  OK, I think that's blogging for one day.

       Don't watch Fox News. The more you watch, the more you'll get things wrong.  Researchers from the Program on International Policy Attitudes (a joint project of several academic centers, some of them based at the University of Maryland) and Knowledge Networks, a California-based polling firm, discovered that:  48 percent of Americans believed that the United States had uncovered evidence demonstrating a close working relationship between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda.   22 percent thought that we had found the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.  25 percent said that most people in other countries had backed the U.S. war against Saddam Hussein.   The researchers then asked where the respondents most commonly went to get their news. The survey concluded that " Fox was the news source whose viewers had the most misperceptions."

       Well you have to go to go to settings in Blogger and turn on Archiving. Then in your template you need to place a this code which will make your perma-links time stamps. This is the code used here at 53:    # " title="Permanent Link" >      If you want you can put anything as the perma link, on Jaded they are the turtles at the end of my posts.

       Mike, you're not the first to ask about Perma links - I have no idea how to create them - is it easy? My comments field is just a bunch of code I slapped in there from some dude who created a little piece of comments software. For those of you I've fooled into thinking I know how to build web pages, you're sadly mistaken. Most of my designs are stolen. The only thing proprietary to me is my writing........  Who was with me when we went to that school playground with the basketball hoops and there was an outline of the United States? Remember when I made that really long shot from "Hawaii?"

       I love how Jeff has perma links to his comments but not to  urlLink his posts .   And there seems to be something wrong with your comments Jeff. (Then again I am doing this at work and the problem might just lie in the crazy server and Firewall that  urlLink Fisher College  has set up.) After Posting I get a "Can't Access Server" page, which makes me think that  urlLink my comment  hasn't posted so I go back and repost and get the same error page and then find out to my horror, yes to my utter horror, that I have posted my comment twice.   Oh the humanity.  Well since I can't link to the post, which is September 29th, 2003, and September has yet to be archived for some other ungodly reason (I mean you bought a house and all that but one would think you could still find the time to have archives or do you not have an attic?), I will now, without permission, reprint some of that post and then post the stupid comment that I wrote about it.  Here we go:   urlLink Jeff : "The thing is, who really knows how much of my money actually goes to MADD? That's the, uh, maddening part. I never know if any charitable contribution is actually going to the charity. I gave quite a bit of money to the Red Cross for September 11th, but who knows? I think I should receive a specific, itemized list of what my donation was used for. That would be quite interesting, wouldn't it? For example, maybe my donation paid for a night's stay at a hospital for one of the victims. Oh well."   urlLink Mike's Comment  embelished a little more: "Thank you for your donation to  . We like to let you know where your money went so that you can feel like you are making a difference in this crazy fucked up world we live in. So here is a breakdown of the $100 you so gratefully donated to us.  "Itemized Report of your $100 donation:   "$95 goes towards the salaries of the people who compile this report.   "$4 goes to transportation costs of the   "$1 in rice you have bought for a starving child in     "Thank You for your donation."

       I have been working. Attempting to keep Fisher College from self-imploding.   "...and if you have any more problems I'm Jonathan, this is Mike and that is our department Gorilla," says Jonathan G. the second of the two Jonathans in the department of Information Services, he has been saying that to the students on a regular basis lately. Unfortunately we do not currently have a "Department Gorilla" (TM) we have sent in a purchase request but the burgher's office hasn't gotten back to us. We need one to distract the students and faculty from the mess that is the school's infrastructure.  So as you can see I am at least at home in this asylum, and serve an average of 11 hours within its walls.  Ann, I will be in New York this weekend but I will be at My sister Mary's engagement party on the Island. Thanks for the info packet, though, anyway.

       I think she is cool.    Moreover, a question which millions of citizens in the international civil society have been asking themselves for the past few years, particularly in recent months, and continue to ask, is this: why is it that some decisions and resolutions of the UN Security Council are binding, while some other resolutions of the council have no binding force? Why is it that in the past 35 years, dozens of UN resolutions concerning the occupation of the Palestinian territories by the state of Israel have not been implemented promptly, yet, in the past 12 years, the state and people of Iraq, once on the recommendation of the Security Council, and the second time, in spite of UN Security Council opposition, were subjected to attack, military assault, economic sanctions, and, ultimately, military occupation?

        Christmas is coming and ...    … There is too much disputation around Christmas anyway. One growing issue is the white vs. colored lights debate. Like all matters of taste, this is also a matter of class. White lights are high-class; colored lights are somewhat less so. White lights make the statement that one is a refined sort who appreciates that less is more and who celebrates Christmas (and life in general) in such a fashion that one would not be absolutely mortified if Martha Stewart dropped by unexpectedly for tea. Colored lights make the statement that one is the sort of person who believes that Christmas is not Christmas without an electric sled and reindeer on the lawn, an electric Santa on the roof, an electric Frosty by the front gate and an electric Very Special Person in a manger on the porch. Most of the houses in my neighborhood are white-light houses, and I have to admit they are lovely, but I was raised in a colored-light family, and I am raising Tom and Jack to be colored-light men too. They do not take a lot of convincing on this. Boys are naturally colored-lighters.   Michael Kelly , from the Washington Post. He died while covering the war in Iraq.

       I'll email passwords.  It's not so exciting though.  On another topic (from marriage/prisons, and thanks for making that analogy G), here is an email I (and many others) received from Don recently.  Anyone wants to join in the great simultaneous marathon project I'll give you his email.  It's a little late but you could catch up:  ********* it's 2004.  want to do something nuts?  let's decide to finish a marthon on may 2nd, together. it doesn't have to be the same marathon. we don't have to run it. but we have 16 weeks to train for it, if we start on Monday.  some of us don't run.  you folks can walk.  walking is very good for you. some of already run a lot.  you folks can gloat, and aim for a fabulous finish time.  the main idea is: we -- all of us -- train for 16 weeks. and then we meet up, on May 2nd, at one of several marathons (several are listed below), to walk or run them.  there is one in ohio. there is one in british columbia. there is one in massachusetts. there is one in nebraska.  we can find one or more in europe. there is one on the great wall of china, later in May.  where you train isn't the point. keeping track of our progress together is the point. or rather, keeping better in touch with eachother, via a mutual project,  is the point. or -- okay, there's no point.  but let's do it.  there will be measurements. there will be graphs. there will be meet-ups and races in the interim 16 weeks. there is already a (rudimentary, under-construction) website where you  can post your training progress & comments: http://www.habeo.net/athletisme.

       Yeah, congrats AM & T!!! Why don't to give us the password to check the site?    The following has (almost) nothing to do with marriage:     Since 1980 the U.S. prison and jail population has quadrupled in size to more than 2 million.   In the process, prisons have embedded themselves into the nation's economic and social fabric. A powerful lobby has grown up around the prison system that will fight hard to protect the status quo. Major companies such as Wackenhut Corrections Corp. and Corrections Corp. of America employ sophisticated lobbyists to protect and expand their market share. The law enforcement technology industry, which produces high-tech items such as the latest stab-proof vests, helmets, stun guns, shields, batons and chemical agents, does more than a billion dollars a year in business.

        I threw the lifebuoy mightily. It fell in the water right in front of him. With his last energies he stretched forward and took hold of it.  "Hold on tight, I'll pull you in. Don't let go. Pull with your eyes while I pull with my hands. In a few seconds you'll be aboard and we'll be together. Wait a second. Together? We'll be  together ? Have I gone mad?"  I woke up to what I was doing. I yanked on the rope.  "Let go of that lifebuoy, Richard Parker! Let go, I said. I don't want you here, do you understand? Go somewhere else. Leave me alone. Get lost. Drown! Drown!"  He was kicking vigorously with his legs. I grabbed an oar. I thrust it at him meaning to push him away. I missed and lost hold of the oar.  I grabbed another oar. I dropped it in an oarlock and pulled as hard as I could, meaning to move the lifeboat away. All I accomplished was to turn the lifeboat a little, bringing one end closer to Richard Parker.  I would hit him on the head! I lifted the oar in the air.  He was too fast. He reached up and pulled himself aboard.  "Oh my God!"  Ravi was right. Truly I was to be the next goat. I had a wet, trembling, half-drowned, heaving and coughing three-year-old adult Bengal tiger in my lifeboat. Richard Parker rose unsteadily to his feet on the tarpaulin, eyes blazing as they met mine, ears laid tight to his head, all weapons drawn. His head was the size and colour of the lifebuoy, with teeth.  I turned around. Stepped over the zebra and threw myself overboard. From  urlLink Life of Pi , by Yann Martel, an excellent sea adventure about Pi Patel, a sixteen year old boy, and Richard Parker, a Bengal tiger, with a wounded Zebra, and a spotted hyena, on a lifeboat adrift in the Pacific.

When I did it the other day (which I forgot to post) is       You're  Roots !   by Alex Haley     While almost everyone agrees that you're brilliant, no one knows quite how to categorize you. Some say that you're a person with an amazing family tree. Some say that you're just a darn good storyteller. Others say that you're both and don't much care where to draw the line. What is known is that your people have been through a great number of trials and that you are where you are because of hard work. You have nothing to lose but your chains.      Take the  urlLink Book Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid .       But today it's         You're  The Guns of August !   by Barbara Tuchman     Though you're interested in war, what you really want to know is what causes war. You're out to expose imperialism, militarism, and nationalism for what they really are. Nevertheless, you're always living in the past and have a hard time dealing with what's going on today. You're also far more focused on Europe than anywhere else in the world. A fitting motto for you might be "Guns do kill, but so can diplomats."

Like when the teenage boys in the apartment across from me last semester had a party and ran out of alcohol at 10pm, and told the girls that showed up at 10:30, "we got Sprite.  Or you could go to the store and get something."  (but they were teenagers so it's kind of cute).  Or giving someone a Christmas gift that you received as a gift yourself last year but didn't really like - even if you almost never used it and it looks like new.   Or asking a girl on a date and then telling her to take the bus over to your place to meet you.  I could go on, I have lots of examples, many of which I'm guilty of myself (but not the Christmas present one . . . really!) Tight:  I don't know, but Mike's guess makes me want to vomit.  By the way, happy anniversary tomorrow, Mrs. Callister.

       sorry if I keep finding news about jails...   Denmark Prisons Ban Heavy Dumbbells     By JAN M. OLSEN   Associated Press Writer  COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- Pumping iron - at least heavy dumbbells - will be banned in Danish prisons following complaints by wardens who feel threatened by inmates turning themselves into "monster men," officials said Friday. "Some inmates have grown to abnormal size," Carsten Pedersen, the chairman of the Union of Danish Prison Officers told The Associated Press. "They have become monster men." Denmark's Prison and Probation Service decided Thursday evening to immediately remove all dumbbells and weightlifting discs of more than 30 kilograms (66 pounds) from fitness centers in the country's 80 state prisons and probation centers. "We took the decision because our staff feel they are exposed to a risk," Annette Esdorf, the deputy manager of the state-run prison board, said Friday. Pedersen called it "total madness" that inmates have been using dumbbells of 50 kilograms (110 pounds) in prison gyms. The prison board's decision came after prison staff had reported "several cases of inmates with aggressive attitudes," Pedersen said, adding that such prisoners represent about 300 of Denmark's 3,500 inmates. "The combination of heavy dumbbells and anabolic steroids has led to a very harsh and negative prison culture," Pedersen said. Earlier this week, one of Denmark's most senior police officers, Chief Constable Joern Bro, said it was wrong that "some criminals can get incredible strength in prison."

       Oh man, that letter is hilarious, Mike. While it does smack a little of something I might write, I take great offense to the fact that you think I would write a sentence like "My worm was happy, and then it ate my homework, and freed the albinos from captivity." I'm far more apt to write something along the lines of "I like wigs."  Nonetheless, to coin the TV commercial adage........."brilliant!"

Jesus stopped by tomorrow and changed my beer into rocky road. I love Jesus. I love albinos, too.  I was laying in the trash the other day and was looking up into the  urlLink 17 Germinal CLXXXI  and saw my worm. My worm was happy, and then it ate my homework, and freed the albinos from captivity.  What is up with your hair? Why is  urlLink Spirit  roving through it? Does it support life? I dream in hypertext and smelly old underpants. The Bruins, and the Red Sox, and the Monkees are on a reunion tour throughout central Pakistan. They will revolutionize lawnmovers and create anti-cells that will eat a hole through every pizza ever made.

Jeff, did you send out alot of mail recently? One seems to have gotten lost and reached my dream. There is a theory about a seperate world where everyone's dreams all connect together.

       G, that's funny you mention that coz I thought about it just the other day.  Yeah, I'm a really weird person.  Oh well.  I didn't feel like talking. (I really was studying though)... wait what's this thing about hugging?  Are we talking about coziest or un-coziest?  Mike, Lyndon reminded me the other day that you used to stomp really loud, up and down the stairs in the middle of the night, just to wake everyone up.  Somehow, I believed him. And the cake on the roof... is probably not a good thing to bring up at his wedding.

       Of course Ann Marie's un-coziest moment was also on the third floor......... passed out and hugging the toilet.  My un-coziest moment was finding myself in Porter Square after being kicked out of my girlfriend's (at the time) friend's house, with no money on me, at 3:30 AM and with a walk to 1053 Beacon Street in Brookline.   That was a cold and uncozy walk.  Maiko, remember 1053? What a great place. When we are in LA for Lyndon's wedding, should I bring up the time he brought you up to the roof with a personalized cake?

       Keep this in mind the next time you either hear, or are about to repeat a rumour.  In ancient Greece (469 - 399 BC), Socrates was widely lauded for his wisdom.  One day the great philosopher came upon an acquaintance who ran up to him excitedly and said, "Socrates, do you know what I just heard about one of your students?"  "Wait a moment," Socrates replied. "Before you tell me I'd like you to pass a little test. It's called the Triple Filter Test."  "Triple filter?"  "That's right," Socrates continued. "Before you talk to me about my student let's take a moment to filter what you're going to say. The first filter is Truth. Have you made absolutely sure that what you are about to tell me is true?"  "No," the man said, "actually I just heard about it and..."  "All right," said Socrates. "So you don't really know if it's true or not. Now let's try the second filter, the filter of Goodness. Is what you are about to tell me about my student something good?"  "No, on the contrary..."  "So,you want to tell me something bad about him, even though you're not certain it's true?"  The man shrugged, a little embarrassed.  Socrates continued. "You may still pass the test though, because there is a third filter - he filter of Usefulness. Is what you want to tell me about my student going to be useful to me?"  "No, not really"  "Well," concluded Socrates, "if what you want to tell me is neither True nor Good nor even Useful, why tell it to me at all?"  The man was defeated and ashamed.  This is the reason Socrates was a great philosopher and held in such high esteem.  It also explains why he never found out that Plato was banging his wife.   courtesy by Jeeva Munasinghe

       You have to love the American Family Association. They keep putting up online polls, and keep getting answers that they don't want to see.

Now they have a poll up about the  urlLink Presidential election .   And as of now it is  urlLink 89.95% for Kerry, 6.22% for Nader and 3.83% for Bush .

       That's interesting. I think it's Prague in English, but I really don't know if that's the local way of saying it.  I'm very jealous of anyone traveling (especially for a long weekend).  To Mike: about having babies or turning into a US citizens... I don't need to be married to do either!  To AM: I just asked the other day "what kind of parents would name their child 'Chuck'?"

Along the road of life, you have had several identity crises which make it very unclear who you are, let alone how to interpret poetry. You probably came from a foreign country, but then again you seem foreign to everyone in ways unrelated to immigration. Most people think you're quite funny, but maybe you're just sick. Talking to you ends up being much like playing a round of the popular board game Clue.      Jeff:      You're  Adventures of Huckleberry Finn !    by Mark Twain   With an affinity for floating down the river, you see things in black and white. The world is strange and new to you and the more you learn about it, the less it makes sense.

You really like straw hats.

         urlLink IRAQ: Concern over classification of prisoners   ( classification, hum... you mean sodomization?? )   BAGHDAD, 8 Oct 2003 (IRIN)  - The United States is trying to sidestep its obligations under the Geneva Convention by creating new categories of prisoners it is holding in Iraq, a Human Rights Watch (HRW) spokesman has warned.  In Iraq, the US military has categorised about 4,000 of its prisoners as "security detainees", a classification not covered by the Geneva Conventions, a set of international war rules agreed to by many countries, according to HRW. "A 'security detainee' is any individual who has committed a crime against US-led coalition forces,"  US Brig-Gen Janis Karpinsky , who is in charge of all detainees in Iraq, told IRIN in the capital, Baghdad.  "Prisoners are taken into the system, and within 72 hours they're given an initial review, and a determination is made on their status," US Brig-Gen Janis Karpinsky said. "Depending on the category, they're afforded the opportunity for a magistrate review, or a tribunal," she added.   "I think the main complaint that people might have is that due process might have been delayed. But we're clearing that. We've been doing the right thing, just not as quickly as some people would like," US Brig-Gen Janis Karpinsky asserted.   "Some of them will be charged with war crimes possibly, some of them will be charged with crimes against the coalition, simply security threats, or could be charged with terrorism or acts against Iraq particularly," US Brig-Gen Janis Karpinsky explained.   "I can tell you there's sometimes a light on all the time,  but there is no torture, there is no abuse, there is no violent extraction of information in any of our facilities," US Brig-Gen Janis Karpinsky stated .   Karpinsky also admitted that conditions for prisoners were not of the best, but pointed out that many US-led coalition troops lived under the same conditions. "You can't keep prisoners at a level of treatment or housing or feeding that is vastly different than the coalition members are living," she noted.   "We're doing everything possible, given the situation and the setting, that they're being treated humanely," she added.     (edited by MPC)

       If I could live my life again,  in the next one I'd make more mistakes.  I wouldn't try to be so perfect. I'd relax more.  I'd be even more fool than I had been,  Actually, just a few things I'd take more seriously.  I'd be less hygienic.  I'd take more risks; I'd travel more,  I'd watch more sunsets,  I'd climb more mountains; I'd swim in more rivers.  I'd go to more places where I never had been,  I'd eat more ice cream and fewer beans  I'd have more real problems and less imaginary ones.   from INSTANTS by Jorge Luis Borges.

I was nervous while taking the test thinking that I'd get "Grammar Loser! Ha! You suck!  Go back to school!! And Don't ever think about becoming a teacher!! LOSER!!" And all my students will laugh at me.  OK, I just changed my name back.  Forever now, I'll be known as Yoda-san!! I was tired of being Callister.  (I'm secretly working on changing Casey's name to Casey Yoda).  Mike said that I am under 30.  This is true, however, not for long.  End of story.      You are a  GRAMMAR GOD !

        English test? No, grazie!   Anyway, about minorities and majorities:   A U.S. official in Baghdad accurately insists that the violent insurgency involves "a minuscule percentage" of the 25 million Iraqis. However, history usually is made not by majorities but by intense minorities. Remember 1917, and this from Richard Pipes's "The Russian Revolution": "The Bolshevik triumph in October was accomplished nine-tenths psychologically: the forces involved were negligible, a few thousand men at most in a nation of one hundred and fifty million." There may have been fewer Bolsheviks than there are members of Sadr's militia, which is one of many. The cancellation last weekend of a Baghdad trade fair was symbolic of the ability of a minuscule minority to sow chaos sufficient to prevent a majority from attending to mundane matters.

        Memorial Day    THE AMERICANS LIE in well-tended graves in France, Italy, Belgium, England, the Philippines and other places where they fell between 1941 and 1945...  Shortly after the Madrid train bombings two months ago, a tape was disseminated with the words of one of the strange legionaries in the current terror war against civilian populations. "  You love life  ," said the voice on the tape. "  We love death  ." It was meant as a sort of gibe, implying weakness on the part of those in the West who are unwilling to immolate themselves in some sacred cause.  Most of the American war dead, in foreign soil and in their own country, would have acknowledged that they loved life, but perhaps not life without liberty or the respect of others who answered the country's call. No suicide warriors here, simply people who put themselves in peril when they thought it right and necessary.  In one cemetery in Italy near the seacoast lie the remains of 7,862 Americans who died in combat in that country. Their graves are visited each year by 200,000 people, very few of them from the United States.   The cemetery's gardener stopped his work on the graves and remarked to the reporter: "  They have been buried here so long, they are Italians now  ."   "You love life." A true enough accusation. Many have loved it enough to die for it.   Monday, May 31, 2004  2004 The Washington Post Company

       Well well well, if I were the pizza cop, I would be more cautious than others (see below) to  trust the fingerprints on the pizza crust….    Three highly skilled FBI fingerprint experts declared this year that Oregon lawyer Brandon Mayfield's fingerprint matched a partial print found on a bag in Madrid that contained explosive detonators. U.S. officials called it "absolutely incontrovertible" and a "bingo match." Mayfield was promptly taken into custody as a material witness. Last week the FBI admitted that it goofed; the print actually belongs to Ouhnane Daoud, an Algerian.  Fingerprint evidence has long been considered an infallible form of proof, powerful enough to support a criminal conviction even without any other evidence. But when three top experts manage to blow such an important identification, our longstanding faith in fingerprints must be questioned. … In fact, the science of fingerprinting is surprisingly underdeveloped.

The survey was a huge failure......   In Africa they didn't know what " food " meant.   In Eastern Europe they didn't know what " honest " meant.   In Western Europe they didn't know what " shortage " meant.   In China they didn't know what " opinion " meant.   In the Middle East they didn't know what " solution " meant.   In South America they didn't know what " please " meant.   And in the USA they didn't know what " the rest of the world " meant.

       Let’s see… this one is going to be about… yes, about scum. Better, about the Scum of the Scum.   About the Scum of the Scum.   SECRETARY OF Defense  Donald H. Rumsfeld  yesterday described the abuses of Iraqi prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison as "an exceptional, isolated" case. At best, that is only partly true. Similar mistreatment of prisoners held by U.S. military or intelligence forces abroad has been reported since the beginning of the war on terrorism. A pattern of  arrogant disregard  for the protections of  the Geneva Conventions  or any other legal procedure has been  set from the top ,  by Mr. Rumsfeld  and senior U.S. commanders.    The foundation for the crimes at Abu Ghraib was laid more than two years ago , when Mr. Rumsfeld instituted a system of holding detainees from Afghanistan not only incommunicado, without charge, and without legal process, but without any meaningful oversight mechanism at all. Brushing off his violation of the Geneva Conventions, Mr. Rumsfeld maintained that the system was necessary to extract important intelligence. But it was also an invitation to abuses -- and reports of those abuses have been appearing since at least December 2002, when a Post story reported on harsh "stress and duress" interrogation techniques bordering on physical torture  © 2004 The Washington Post Company

        Lovely Vice President Cheney    Washington Post  Friday, June 25, 2004.    A brief argument between Vice President Cheney and a senior Democratic senator led Cheney to utter a big-time obscenity on the Senate floor this week.   On Tuesday, Cheney, serving in his role as president of the Senate, appeared in the chamber for a photo session. A chance meeting with Sen. Patrick J. Leahy  became an argument about Cheney's ties to Halliburton Co., an international energy services corporation, and President Bush's judicial nominees. The exchange ended when Cheney  offered some crass advice.   "Fuck yourself," said Vice President Cheney.   Leahy's spokesman, David Carle, yesterday confirmed the brief but fierce exchange. "The vice president seemed to be taking personally the criticism that Senator Leahy and others have leveled against Halliburton's sole-source contracts in Iraq," Carle said.    Cheney's office did not deny that the phrase was uttered. His spokesman, Kevin S. Kellems said, "There was a frank exchange of views."

If I ever feel better Remind me to spend some good time with you You can give me your number When it's all over I'll let you know If I ever feel better Remind me to spend some good time with you You can give me your number When it's all over I'll let you know  It's like somebody took my place I ain't even playing my own game The rules have changed well I didn't know There are things in my life I can't control I feel the chaos around me A thing I don't try to deny I'd better learn to accept that There's a part of my life that will go away  Dark is the night, cold is the ground In the circular solitude of my heart As one who strives a hill to climb I am sure I'll come through I don't know how They say an end can be a start Feels like I've been buried yet I'm still alive  I'm losing my balance on the tight rope Tell me please, tell me please, tell me please...  If I ever feel better Remind me to spend some good time with you You can give me your number When it's all over I'll let you know  If I ever feel better Remind me to spend some good time with you You can give me your number When it's all over I'll let you know  If I ever feel better Remind me to spend some good time with you You can give me your number When it's all over I'll let you know

       It is so very easy to tell, from Giulio's last post, that he was married.

        Giulio, quando la trovi una ragazza?!   means,   Giulio, when will you find a girlfriend?! ,  that is, in other words,    Giulio, when are you finally going to lose your peace of mind and start going out with a female human being who will  regularly bug you, on a daily basis, with petty details and will make you go crazy in no time?

       There is no path to sustainable security except through respect for human rights. The global security agenda promulgated by the US Administration is bankrupt of vision and bereft of principle. Sacrificing human rights in the name of security at home, turning a blind eye to abuses abroad, and using pre-emptive military force where and when it chooses have neither increased security nor ensured liberty.   Irene Khan , Amnesty International's Secretary General.

       hum...   I don't know the word  HITCH , so I have to check it on the dictionary...  so...    HITCH :  to move with halts and jerks  hum... I can see Ann Marie and Tom moving with halts and jerks, especially when they were coming back from pubs, for example...   HITCH :  to catch or fasten by     No, Ann Marie would never do this to Tom... I think.   HITCH :  to connect (a vehicle or implement) with a source of motive power     No, this is impossible. Ann Marie would never hitch a rake to Tom.   HITCH :  to attach (a source of motive power) to a vehicle or instrument    This is possible. I can see Ann Marie doing this to Tom. For example to hitch Tom to the car.    HITCH :  to become entangled  That's more likely, actually. Especially when I think about all that noise coming from Ann Marie's room, everytime Tom was over the house. I can see (though I don't want to picture it) Ann Marie and Tom entangled.    HITCH:   to join in marriage   oh oh.... I'm afraid this is what Mike wanted to say...

       It's a movie that I recommend.&nbsp;   I'm changing my text color because I want to.    It's not a perfect movie, but it should have been shown long time ago. It's about the media in US and Iraq and the war.&nbsp; It's kind of what I want to say. &nbsp;   &nbsp;   Anayway, we went to an Italian pizza restaurant today before the movie.&nbsp; It reminded me alot of G's pizza except it was not as good.&nbsp; But it's the closest I've come across.&nbsp; Mind you, I don't really go to Italian or pizza or whatever restaurants usually.&nbsp; I'm save going to Italian restaurants for when I'm nactually in Italy.  &nbsp; It's just that we were running late for the movie and all the places around there (it's like a theater district) are expensive and time consuming.&nbsp; So we found a place that was not fast food but fast enough.&nbsp; And it was surprisingly good!&nbsp; We were there all of twenty minutes at the restaurant.&nbsp; That's the fastest I've ever eaten at a real sit-down restaurant...&nbsp; I found a cute French restaurant and a fancy Chinese restaurant nearby.&nbsp; That's where I'm going next since there are no good Japanese place here ....&nbsp;&nbsp;   Are you still reading this?&nbsp; I find  that  to be pretty amazing.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   goo'nite everyone!     &nbsp;

       Work is tiring. Time to go home.   urlLink Jeff , you should have gotten the 40 GB, my 20 GB is almost full (only 3GB left) and I have less CDs than you. (If by less you mean 1,150 CDs that is, and I still have tons that I haven't burned yet) (Also,  urlLink your comments  don't work on  urlLink FireFox , I didn't check any other browsers)  Giulio, dirty boy, leaving condoms laying around so that dogs can poop them out.  urlLink Triumph the Dog  is going to find you and then Poop on you.

       Ciao a tutti!  First, congratulations to Sarah!! Up to now, Sarah for me was just the owner of Boris.  I remember the day Sarah stormed into my room asking: "GIULIO!!! Is this condom yours?? " showing to me a  really  dirty condom " ...because Boris just pupped this condom and I don't know whether he got it in your room or in the street!!!"  But now, Holly molly, Jee Wee, Willy Wonka, Mini Me!!! She is an iron woman!  MAYUMI!!!  TAKA KAKATA TATAKATA!!! (for those of you who don't know Japanese, it means " Hi Mayumi, how are you, what's up, hoyouu dooing! Good to hear from you! Are you still playing tennis? I still do, but I miss playing tennis with you.")  anyway, tomorrow I'm going to Italy. On my motorbike again. It's going to take two days to get to southern Italy. Be back in two weeks. Or maybe later.   "Don't forget those who love you"

       Ironman Coeur d'Alene Hello -- Just a quick note to say I did it!  I completed Ironman Coeur d'Alene last Sunday 6/27 and it was a really super fabulous day.  My parents flew out from Massachusetts to support me in addition to my Aunt Susan and Uncle George and my friends Candi, Cara, Kainoa and Chris who came up from Seattle.  We had perfect weather - nice calm 66 degree water in the morning, sunny skies, low wind, and a daytime high of 83 or so.     The swim was hard because I seeded myself incorrectly and had to wrestle my way through walls of people treading water for the first 500 yards.  And I got kicked in the eye, jaw, and all that stuff you hear about everyone beating the tar out of everyone else in Ironman swims definitely held true.     The bike was great.  I felt really good, ate and drank a lot, and held a pace that I figured was sufficiently peppy but not enough to kill my legs for the marathon.  My parents and aunt and uncle had their own little race in the car chasing me down on the bike course so they could pop up at various places out in the middle of nowhere and cheer for me.  They were so awesome - I'll never forget how totally and utterly ecstatic their voices and faces were when I rode by.   The run started out kind of bad with GI distress that resulted in several lengthy bathroom stops but I drank some Coke at each aid station and my stomach finally settled down.  I kept a steady intake of salt tabs all day so I fortunately didn't have any cramping.  My only goal for the run had been to run the whole thing except for the aid stations and I did that successfully.     All in all, it went much better than I had mentally prepared myself for.  My semi-pipe-dream goal was to break 14 hours and I beat that by 38 minutes.  I was so totally happy with how the day went.  It couldn't have been better!  Thank you again to my awesome support peeps - Susan, George, Mom, Daddy, Candi, Cara, Kainoa, and Chris.  It made such a huge difference having you guys there - I can't express how much your support meant to me -- and not just race day, but for the whole eight months prior.  Thank you and I love you!   Here are my results.  See you all soon I hope!   Total Time:  13:22:39 Division Place:  48/116 2.4 mi Swim:  1:23:59 112 mi Bike:  6:38:59 26.2 mi Run:  5:10:45

       quite honestly... G, I think you ran out of things to say long time ago...   I want to start taking aikido but it's expensive.  more expensive than a gym ($80/month).  I guess I have to run (free).

       I'll only approve new blood if I know who it is.  (Which is me saying, that if we want new blood, then tell me, and I'll send out the invite)  Oh, and Ann, please create a Profile, you are the only 53 person without one.  And, happy belated Birthday Maiko, I completely forgot, sorry.

       This blog could use some new blood.  We all know what Giulio thinks about politics by now.  (not that it's not always fascinating, G, I mean every time you write "Bush sucks", it really is thrilling all over again.  I'm just saying . . . )

       Thanks for wishing my 22nd birthday.  No matter what the rest of the world says, from now on, I will be turning 22 on my birthday every year.  I came back from camping/tubing in shannandoah river.  It was great! but now I'm really tired.  being 22 is not easy I guess.  I think it was more of the dancing/drinking that made me tired, because tubing requireds no energy...  BTW, I agree most of the time what you guys say about politics. But I don't have much to say because I don't have much info.
