      so yea. i was hella bummed because i wasnt able to go to the concert, becase i was in Milwaukee, but we left there at like 7:16. so i got back in town about an hour after that so then i ran around my house like mad trying to get ready and got over to the place adn conviently enoug just as i got out of my car i see nate and Mike. Mike takes a double take and runs over to me and hugs and kisses and spins me. IT WAS SO AWESOME!    and when he was on stage playing the guitar for Nate......i almost died, that had to be the hottest thing in the world. aaaaaaaa boy+guitar= orgasmic.i love it. he got off stage and i like covered him in kisses.    i also got a drumstick and a promo CD yea!    and a bunch of people were there. Brandi gave me a kiss on the lips beore she left it was pretty cool. there was Lee, Nate, Cory, AJ, Jake, Chad, Zac, Mike, Brittany, Hannah, Lis, Jessie, Austin, aw fuckit.   I'm sorry Anthony.

      so thursday i played Monopoly with Geoff and um Jay Salinas. yea my life is pretty random like that. Jay is the coolest guy i have ever met. wow. so anyway, geoff lost, horribly, and jay left. then Geoff and i chilled 'til about quarter to 9. he left and i called mike. then Geoff called.....at like 9:15........and we got off the phone at like 11:15. all i have to say, is that was one of the best and worst conversations of my life, but it was so ungodly necessary. Geoff, i love ya.   so i call Mike back, at like 11:20 and he and i had a very personal conversation as well, Mike you mean so much to me.    Both of these conversations are for my reccollection only. thank you.   *note to self- revelations and epiphanies hurt, but are so necessary, i forgive you. also, it scared me, but I'm gonna be ok. no pressure right? yeaaaa.*

      "Jessica" (3:28)    Jessica is always taking chances Getting by on rotten circumstances She's painting visions of a better life I wish I could save her tonight  But she's happier not giving in Office spaces never fit her skin Jessica when will you begin? Will you ever win?  Someone said they saw Jess a week ago But I don't think she'd want us to know That she's working like a slave for her self And her master is whipping her to death  Chorus  I saw you last night And you walked away from me again A friend came to me And said you were afraid of what I'd say You got stuck in the vein And you lost your head If I see you tonight I'll take you home Chorus   - so thats a song by seville. and it's title is my name. :-D and the song fits me well.-

      i have decided to write in both here and my OD, because i'm just fucking addicted to my OD. so yea. geoff= bad. and yet i still deal with him and have him somewhat in my life. why? well, certain reasons only my fucked up head and heart know, but do not really understand. and now i have this amazing guy in my life, but he's saying the "L" word after a week. and i have come to the conclusion that LOVE SUCKS! not even that, no, but i don't want to love any one in that monogamous way. it's just too overwheling and we all saw how well that turned out the last time. i just get in too deep *when i'm trying to keep up above in my head instead of going under* sorry a little SUM 41....yea. anyway. and i know that it hurts when it's said and there is no response... so what am i supposed to do? this guy is fucking amazing and i care about him deeply, but i don't think love is a factor yet. and i know in my heart that's totally alright. i just don't know how it's going to effect him. and i'm sacred because of that. ugh. i dont know. later days. jessica.

      ahh ok mike. well i have to write about this boy, since my OD aint working. may 2nd yay that would be when he asked me out. and guh, he's so amazing. him and i think alike. i don't know if that's good or bad, but for now it's good. he's gentle, like when he touches me (no not in a perverted way) and when he hugs and kisses me, it's not rough-housing. and when i have something to say, he listens and responds. and he remembers things i say and ideas i have. he hugs me jsut right and he kisses me just right. i feel right with him. and he's different than the other guys. and it's so fucking easy to say that by what they say, but it's hard to read actions wrong. because it's like no touchy feely guy pressure. and it's weird and great at the same time. like, you would think that having a girl laying next to you *note to self, keep out detail.* there we go....you would think he'd try something or try to get me to try something. he didn't we layed there and kissed and talked and laughed and sighed and i was held. i was held like I'm supposed to be held. he appreciates me and he respects me. and there is something about him, that makes me want to be this happy person so as to make him the best adn ahppiest person he wants to be. the fact that he will do things for me without thinking about himself first and foremost is so awesome. he's compassionate and considerate. i haven't had someone actually go out of thier way for me...in a while. he's sensitive. and he has the cutest smile, with one dimple. his eyes, my lord they are the deepest brown. soo cool looking and i could just look into them for like, ever. his hands interlock with mine perfectly. music. wow can i talk to him about saddle creek records and vagrant records. I am the Black Cherry Kool-Aid.

      well, I'm just sad. like, christ, there's been tension lately, and i don't like it. Mike's been more, well no, he's been less sweet. it's like he's been spazzing on me lately and i fucking hate it. ok so i went to ask my dad about alternators for the car we're probably getting and i said "daddy I'm confused...." and mike's like ok i dont wanna hear you cry to your dad.... so i proceded to get pissed. you'd think it would matter if i was mad, well it sure as hell didnt seem to matter.    whatever. im sad and pissed, but that doesnt matter anymore does it.

      "Sympathy"  I wish I could be a part of your sadness. I wish I could cry for you. I hate to think of what you are going through...but, I've never known, I can't even sympathize. I can't even sympathize, I can't even sympathize... As I imitate your mood I feel so callous, so hard inside. Because my eyes are dry, I can't even sympathize. I just hope that it will be OK along the way.  yep, Samiam is a great great band

      Fade Into You  I want to hold the hand inside you I want to take a breath that's true I look to you and I see nothing I look to you to see the truth You live your life You go in shadows You'll come apart and you'll go black Some kind of night into your darkness Colors your eyes with what's not there.  Fade into you Strange you never knew Fade into you I think it's strange you never knew  A stranger's light comes on slowly A stranger's heart without a home You put your hands into your head And then smiles cover your heart  Fade into you Strange you never knew Fade into you  I think it's strange you never knew X2  I think it's strange you never knew

      Let Me In Let Me In I've been watching you and all you do For quite some time Knowing all the ins and outs of you I should've known what was on your mind But all the world is spinning round and round Inside my head tonight I will fall into the darkness And I fear I will never see the light (Repeat)  So let me in All that I wanted from you Was something you'd never do So let me in Oh please tonight Don't let this end Tonight I'll Fall  Through no light the darkness seems to be So very strong How does one alone against the world Find the strength to carry on? What happened to the way we used to love It seemed as though life had just begun But now that love has come and gone to fade away Like the setting sun Cuz' you won't let me in.  All that I wanted from you Was something you'd never do So let me in  Oh please tonight Don't let this end  Tonight Cuz' I'm starting to fall So let me in  It was all that I wanted from you It was something you never knew To let me in But not tonight  For this is the end Tonight I fall

      Papillon- Rilo Kiley Papillon busted free Though it took him 'til he was sixty-three And nobody cared about the Goddamned inquiry And Daga stayed on the farm Though he found no cause for alarm It was a hell of a swim but he still had two good arms  Gorillas are for eating Don't you know it's true I fell in love with you And don't you think it's sad 'Cause here we both stand Amidst the wreckage of our past  And I'll spend the day with you We'll meet at your house after two You're the most exhausting girl I ever knew And when you let me leave I'll go I'll let you get back to your phone You mean well, Mel, but you're all talk and no show  Pick you lips 'til they're bleeding Don't you know I fell The lair of the queer devil Is deeper than you thought The computer's still on And the webpage is alt.com  And I hope you'll come back soon And I feel like a million buck today, a million bucks today 'Cause I know it can only go up from here 'Cause she says it's so much better after all  After all we been through I can't get my mind off of you It's a hell of a way to spend the whole day through And you left your name on the bar You hopped your little brown car You moved in with Gramps and you got yourself a job  And the room is slowly sinking But I can play guitar And Morgan you're so far Away from me tonight And I'll try to make it right By putting you in this here song  Oh yeah Okay Okay wait Oh my God, Blake That's what she said In bed  Papillon busted free We watched him at 4:53 And I'm glad you chose to spend the night with me

      Well morning came and it dressed the sky in a lovely, yellow gown.  Now the shops they are all opening in that narrow hallway of downtown.  It's filled with people who are shopping for their lovers and their friends, saying "I won't ever be lonely again."  Now a forest fenced becomes backyards like songs are born from sound.  And an Apple fell and it taught us all we are chained here to the ground. So, I mean, here we go, but there ain't no escape.  These streets are just dead ends.  So I won't ever be happy again.  Now it seems that you too see a painful blue when you stare into the sky.  You could never understand the movement of a hand waving goodbye.  But as the story goes, or it is often told, a new day will arise and all the dance halls will be full of skeletons that are coming back to life.  And on a grassy hill the Lion will lay down with the Lamb and I won't ever be lonely again.  But until that time I think I had better find some disbelief to suspend, because I don't want to feel like this again.  great song. find out who this is and download all of his work.

      I went to your house  Walked up the stairs  Opened your door without ringing the bell  Walked down the hall  Into your room where I could smell you  And I shouldn't be here  Without permission  Shouldn't be here...   Would you forgive me love if I dance in your shower?  Would you forgive me love if I laid in your bed?  Would you forgive me love if I stay all afternoon?   I took off my clothes  Put on your robe  Went through your drawers  And I found your cologne  Went down do the den  Found your CD’s  And I played your Joni   And I shouldn't stay long  You might be home soon  Shouldn't stay long...   Would you forgive me love if I danced in your shower  Would you forgive me love if I laid in your bed?  Would you forgive me love if I stay all afternoon?   I burned your incense  I ran a bath  I noticed a letter that sat on your desk  It said:  "Hello love.  I love you so, love.  Meet me at midnight."  And no, it wasn't my writing  I'd better go soon  It wasn't my writing   So forgive me love if I cry in your shower  So forgive me love for the salt in your bed  So forgive me love if I cry all afternoon  Im gonna sign that lalalalalaaaaaaaaaala

      Looking in your eyes Praising every moment because you're my only light Reading the stares at your passion that bears me now Shedding no little tears The silence scares us more than leaving could  [Chorus:] Come back Please don't leave me now I'll be all that you need in life Because I can't live without you and I know all that you need I can give you everything When you're so far you'll forget about me  Waiting by your side Knowing every moment is closer to your flight Upset with the past, but it's all that holds us now Believing no lies, telling each other we'll be fine forever  [Chorus]  But I'll wait I could never leave those beautiful eyes I know you're sorry I know what you must be going through And I feel sorry for you  But please don't leave me now [x3]  im going post happy. murfle.

      murfle. no mike. it saddens me. i went to his house. went to ryans house nothing. mike's house nothing. drove around for another 40 minutes in sad emptyness.   mike and i talked today at palmer. lemme tell ya, there are a lot of bugs. yes. like magic scorpions that give you invisible blood, coming out of your eyes only, and magic spiders that make your blood black, ( i think, was is blood or tears? meh.) ok anyway, we talked, kinda. we kissed. oh my god, i miss him terribly. we're "good friends" but i can't be good friends with him. this won't work.   when i walked up to mike, i was gonna be this sulky girl, but i couldn't. i saw him and we just started talking, with ease. and if i wanted to not smile, i would have had to bite my cheek until i bled.   oh and by the way, where you bit me, there is totally a bruise.  and yes, it hurts. thank you michael smithhart. :-/  te amo.  p.s. by six.

      ya know, it seems like when you are depressed, all those saddle creek bands jsut pop out, don't they? the lyrics anyway. Lie right now Im listening to catch-22, which is not mood fitting at all. ska doesnt really help. meep. lyrics, they just seem to make you be able to explain yourself so much better. because ya know, feelings and emotions, suck. they just do. and i wish i was jaded right now. cuz um, right now, the word CONFUSION with a huge arrow in neon is above my head. oh my wouldn't that be nice if our feelings were posted above us? then we'd know when not to ask HEY HOW ARE YOU? when someone's sign said 'SUICIDALLY DEPRESSED, ALMOST OVER THE EDGE' cuz ya know we may trigger something. yes, rambling when nervous.   bbye

      so im regretting this situation i put myself in two days ago. I'm doubting that decision, and I'm pretty sure i just lost a really really great person. since the break-up all i've dreamt about is him. the night it happened, i had a dream that ryan drove mike over to my house to give me back a shirt or something, and i could just see his face, and mine, how sad we were, apart. i went to give him a hug for my shirt, and he shrugged me away. and i could feel the hurt, i could feel it while i was sleeping. i woke up, in tears. then last night, i had a wonderful dream. Mike and I, were at Parker for some concert thing i think and him and i were standing around bla bla bla and ppl were coming up and giving me hugs, the one that stuck out was Spoon, he gave me a hug, adn Mike got pissed. i just leaned over and gave him a kiss and smiled. Everything was fixed. then we sat down for.......something i dont remember but he was laying in my lap, his fave thing actually, and i was just stroking his hair. then cut to him golfing (eh....i dunno) but i was laying down in the grass, and he kept looking at me and smiling, and i was smiling back.  then i got up and miles dykeman was at the hole in front of mike, so i hit his golf ball onto he green. yea i rock at golf apparently. and then Mike gave me another kiss. (man i didnt realize how much we kissed lol) then i was standing with him on the green and just with my head on his chest and smiling. cut to happy joes where clay and brittany were working. i bought Mike a pizza Bread thingy and some ice cream, it was 12:25 when i got is, and i needed to be at work by 1, so i was like oh shit how and i gonna get this food to him?? hes at parker! and i got all upset and before i could bring him the food, i woke up. I really dont like not having him. and i havent had any chance to talk to him. which i need and want to do.  I'm gonna cry.

      Brother of mine. Where are you going? Drunken stares. This table just isn't the same. A wave goodbye from both of our driveways. Say anything. You're married now. This never-ending story of people, leaving and going and coming back home. Stay - Where are you going? Why are you leaving? Please just come back home. Why? - I've never felt this. No one is home now. I'm changing for the worse. No - Late night phone calls. Bags are packed up now. You can come back home. I know - You gave it a try. Some things don't work out. Your family is home. I've never said goodbye this many times. I will try to keep in touch with you. It's not the same. The stories are changing. Chairs have turned and backs will be turning. Chicago night. Sidewalk confessions. "I'm going to a place where no one knows me." We're taught to fail. We're made to crawl. We're built to stay together. Don't question our ties. I don't deny the lies we told and the stories we never sold. We tried and some will die trying. We just end up failing. The bag pipes are playing our song while we wait in line for our lives. Grab my hand before I kiss the bottom. This table is falling apart. Like glue:I'm bonded to you...

      "So long everything!" He shouted.  Then he ran next door to Margo's house.  "I'm moving."  "Where?" asked Margo.  "2 weeks away." "2 weeks away?" he said to Mitchell. "Where is that?" asked Margo.  "It's everywhere. I will be there after I walk home in two weeks", said Mitchell, I have lived in the same place for a long time, and it is time for me to go some place else.  "No," said Margo, "you have only lived next door for 15 years."  "16 years," said Mitchell.  "What's the difference," said Margo, "I want you to stay next door forever. "I can't,"  said Mitchell, "I will wake up in the same old bed and eat breakfast in the same old kitchen every room in my house is the same old room because I have been here too long."   "Do you look at me and think same old face, same old town, same old rocks, same old margo?"  "No," said Mitchell, "I like your face, I like you I like you I like you."  "I like you too," said Margo.  He walked throught the door. "I must pack," he said.  mike, you should know what this is.

      Don't change your name Keep it the same For fear I may lose you again I know you won't It's just that I am unorganised And I want to find you when Something good happens If you come down We'll go to town I haven't been there for years But I'd be fine Wasting our time Not doing anything here Just doing nothing We'll sit for days And talk about things Important to us like whatever We'll defuse bombs Walk marathons And take home whatever together Whatever together

      yesterday, mike joey and kayla came over. she's so nice! mike and i talked, yay.   "The Best Deceptions"  I heard about your trip. I heard about your souvenirs. I heard about the cool breeze, in the cool nights, and the cool guys that you spent them with. Well I guess I should have heard of them from you. I guess I should have heard of them from you.  Don't you see, don't you see, that the charade is over? And all the "Best Deceptions" and "Clever Cover Story" awards go to you. So kiss me hard 'cause this will be the last time that I let you. You will be back someday and this awkward kiss that tells of other people's lips will be of service to keeping you away.  I heard about your regrets. I heard that you were feeling sorry. I heard from someone that you wish you could set things right between us. Well I guess I should have heard of them from you. I guess I should have heard of them from you.  I'm waiting for blood to flow to my fingers, I'll be all right when my hands get warm. Ignoring the phone, I'd rather say nothing. I'd rather you'd never heard my voice. too late to be gracious and you do not warrant long good-byes. You're calling too late.

      so last night, mike and i hung out. well, more like we went to a movie, which i dont consider hanging out because you sont get quality talking time with that person. not that im saying i didnt have TONS OF FUN!! cuz i did. :-D um i miss him, aaaaaaahhhhhgggggggggggeireirsjflskdfjsjusoivusdoijgflkwerj what the hell. it can't...it just can't be put together. damnit. so anyway. (meh.) we went to taco bell and pirates of the carribbean. that's all geoff knows. yep. well we all know the difference between a 10 second kiss and a 3 minute make-out session. I'm gonna kill nate. seriously. makes me sound like i threw myself at him, unwanted and kissed him first. lets  look at some of the things nate said to me:  Brekenmuth (1:57:49 PM): if anything, that kiss was my fault, i started it  then nate on mikes comments on my blog: Brekenmuth (1:58:58 PM): and besides, mike said those things. . .mike says a lot of things. . . Brekenmuth (1:59:10 PM): and half of which are just coming out of his ass  I'm so sick of his 2-faced bull shit to save his own ass, because everyone knows he's been lying. and I can back my shit up. oh god, i'm so angry.

      weee. i stayed home from school this morning because i felt very dizzy and sick to my stomach.  I hate missing school. But, hey it beats potentially throwing up in first hour right?  so i went tanning at like 4 and went over to mike's, heard a leak from my car, didn't know what from, walked up to it, most definately my tire, booked ass home, hoping my tire wouldn't explode. dear lord. but my dad fixed it, it was only the valve.  WHAT THE FUCK lost 4 people outta the homecoming group. whatever. fuck you zac fuck you amber fuck you jessica fuck you neuman. ahhhh this is aggravating. not angered, just frustrated.

      a short list, an outline if you will, of life as of right now:  a.) I am with Mike. He is a wonderful guy, he makes me smile.  b.) Geoff needs a rebound, this he told to me. However, rebounding on Ravelle, is not the best             idea.        1.) It will make ravelle and my friendship more rocky        2.) It will make it hard to get over me, for the fact that Ravelle and I are friends.        3.) It hurts me to know that he wants to be with her              a.) Granted, I'm not allowed that emotion when it comes to this situation,                                 but it is still occuring. c.) Bri and I made up today after school        1.) I apologized, told her i missed and loved her.        2.) I hope that her hugs and words of freindship were true              a.) I do not doubt her, I am just scared I lost her as a friend altogether. d.) Got a new, or should i say different, car.         1.)1989 White, Four-Door, Cavilier. :-D I        2.) It has a radio.  WOOT!  e.) Homecoming group:         1.) Mike & I, Joey & Elena, Kopplin & Amber, Blake & Joy, and Nick & Misty        2.) Prime Quarter, time TBD  holla.

      "uh.  how' about this arrinette. how does she fit into all of this?" " I'd prefer not to talk about her, incase she's listening." "oh im sorry, i didn't  realize she was a real person." "she's not. i made her up." "oh, so she's not real..." "just as real as you or i." "i don't think i understand." "neither do i, but after i grow up i will. i mean, a lot of things are really unclear for me right now."  "thats interesting now you mentioned your depression...." "no i didnt."

Yep. and ya know what, I'm glad he had the balls to say that, because It really made me look at what I had right in front of me. :-)  i love you.

      well, i am single. geoff said, if we were going to continue our relationship, i couldnt talk to mike anymore, since i still have feelings for him. and i dont blame him, but i guess it made me realize my feelings about mike. but.....holy crap, this sucks. I miss him, in more ways than one, and augh! I hate being so uncertain. sooooo FUCKING uncertain. I'm gonna go cry now.   later days.

      so today: went from 4-3 and the price is the same, since it's at the minimum. :-D :-D *sigh* this, it just too much. I can't  not  know them, either of them, i need to know mike especially, since we are so smiliar, and Geoff, it's really a comfortable thing. I've known him for a year now, and like he said, he is putting SO MUCH into this relationship, and i know he is. i know, that they both truely love me, and i also know that I'm Geoff's first love, as he was mine. But, the sparkle, no correction, the flame, that geoff put off, and put into me, is now a kindle. And, it is such a turn-on, to be able to talk to someone for hours, or should i say 3 months at a time... I just dont know. One of them is saying me or him me or him, the other is tellign me how he NEEDS ME. and it's overwhelming. It's overwheling to think that i mean so much to both of them, it's overwhelming to know that it's all on me, all my fault, all my doing that us 3 are hurting and being so stressed out over this. i want to end it all, but by taking another step or action, may cause another downfall, how can you know what's right?

      it's not like I'm with him for no reason. it's not that i don't care for you still. it's not that i wont say i love you, its that i cant. it's not that i think everything is ok, i know it's not. its not like i ignore the fact that we're soul sharing. i know this. it's not like it meant nothing either, you and i both know it did.  but  it's against the rules, and we know this. i cant...i just can't. i know you want to see him  hurt  see him in  pain  but i can't and i don't want to. i alos dont want to  jeopardize  my relationship.

      Ya know, that feeling that you just want to write and write and write?? Yup, I have that right now. It's a good feeling, even when you dont have anything to write about. OH MAN! I NEVER TALKED ABOUT MY PRESENT! ok, so there I was...no no no kidding. any way. The week and a half when I was dying, Mike came over on Homecoming to take care of me remember? Well, he had a present for me, it was the Duvall/Seville split CD that I had been wanting since about June. I couldn't  find it anywhere, and he bought it for me. The reason I was so fanatical about it was because Seville has a song called "Jessica" and the lyrices rocked, so I really wanted to hear this band. I couldn't find them to download, so I couldn't even hear if I liked them, but they wrote about Dashboard and a few other bands along those lines...so I thought that I would like them. The CD is wonderful.  Mike, thank you so much for getting it for me, and I love you.

      So the party was fun! Minus the fact that Britney didn't want to be there with me. (resources tell me this). It made me sad, but in general I had fun. The popular of the popular chicks were there. They liked my shirt. OOOOOOO. I feel special that I was acknowledged as a person. Wow, I haven't been that cynical and close-minded for a while.  oh yea. talked to geoff. conversation as follows: Ravelle on her Phone: "Well she's right here, do you wanna talk to her?" Me: "Hello?" Geoff: "Hi, I got your message and um Frank Zappa, and that song were not important." Me: "Yes it was, we listened to it all the time." Geoff: "No we didn't." Me: "Yes we did." Geoff: "No, we didn't." Me: *sigh*"Fine, sorry." Geoff: " One more thing?" Me: "Yea?" Geoff: "Fuck off."  .click.  makes a girl feel real good about herself.

      So, it's sad that doesn't suit you now. And me fresh out of rope... Please ignore this lisp, I never meant to sound like this. So take me and break me and make me strong like you.  I'll be forever grateful to this and you. It's only you, beautiful. Or I don't want anyone. If I can choose it's only you.  Fix me to a chain around your neck and wear me like a nickel. Even new wine served in old skins will cheapen the taste. i shot the pilot begging you to fly this for me im here for you to use broken and bruised do you understand ?  it's only you, beautiful or i don't want anyone if i can choose, it's only you But how could I miscalculate... perfect eyes will have perfect aim. If I can choose, it's only you.  “We're wrecking” and I'm dry like a drum when you speak... so fine I'll leave... we're spent... take our time... measured... we slave for days and weeks.  It's only you, beautiful. Or I don't want anyone. If I can choose. It's only you. But how could I miscalculate... perfect lies from a perfect dame. If I can choose... it's only you.

I thought it was a friend thing, but it grew to be so much more. We had a great relationship, and then it stopped. Fault by me, (and some by You hehheh)  and we grew apart. Even the first of our meetings after we broke up ( that friday at Palmer Park, where Joey was playing with the Half-burned cecada....oh lord) And we stayed apart, for a while...You avoided me, I got confused and sad. Then, we went to Pirates. Oh good movie, better kiss. Special kiss. And after that, we talked more, we hung out more. We connected better. The Geoff came back. I ran to someone I hadn't seen in 2 months, who had been writing and talking to me all summer. I missed him. And in the process of running, I crushed You. But You stayed there for me. We stayed friends. You didn't shut me out. And things stopped. I was to "choose" and I did. It hurt, all of us in that. But You, You  took me, took my heart, my mind.   What we have now, is something I never thought I'd expierence. I can talk to you about anything. You have shown me respect like no other you have been loyal to me like no other. You have made me feel, special. My Self-Respect has soared, and my faith in people has grown. You give me hope and confidence that I can't find inside myself. Seeing You, hearing You, feeling You, makes everything better. You just make me glow. I can sit in silence with You, and be comepletely comfortable with it.  I feel right with You, and when a bump in the road, we work through it, better than most people, high school couples rather, than I know. The way we interact, is so fun, refreshing and lovely. Yup, lovely. Life, as I see it right now, is lovely. Hands down, you are the best thing i could ever imagine, always imagine.

My temprature was 106.5 I was taken to the room immeadiately and they put in IV. took blood, lots of it, gave me Motrin for the fever and two saline bags to get me to pee. I gave a urine sample and they told me that i have a severe kidney infection. Sweet, its only the kidneys. what ever. Friday and Saturday i couldnt even keep down water.

      i know i havent written for a long time, but hey, thats fine. I have been focusing on school more, and my report card shows it. GPA- 3.857. and damn proud of it. maybe I'll be bumped back into the top 15% instead of.... 19 i think?? most people would be soooooo happy to be in that even, BUT FUCK THAT. f-u-c-k-t-h-a-t. I know i can get over a 4.0 and i fucking want to. this whole thing, school, isn't about learning, its about being the best so you can get into the best college and lead the best life. that's it. And i wand to be the best. i want to come out on top and shine. C's are not acceptable to me or my family. I got them last year, 4th quarter, I wanted to hurt myself. So my goal for 2nd quarter, is to get all A's, a 4.285 GPA. I WANT IT.

      I have, as of recent, become a bitch. And I don't enjoy it at all, not one bit. I did this in my last relationship, where I became really uptight about EVERY LITTLE THING! and it drives both mike and I crazy, thus creating mini-arguments and those slowly wear down a relationship, and this is what happened last time that happened: break up. No, FUCK THAT. Not breaking up with Mike, heeeeeeeeeeeeellll no. I love him way too much. What I think he and I need to do...is see other people. NOT LIKE THAT! But our friends. He go hang with the boys for a night, I chill with the chicas. It's like I love to spend every minute with this boy, and I know it's mutual, but it's not healthy. as the great nate myatt said to me-   "Relationships are a lot like songs. If you listen to it all the time, you get sick of it, but if you space it out, you love it even more as it plays."  how true it is.   It's gonna kill me at first to be like ok you have fun, I'll talk to you later sometime. RAR! Space is good, just keep repeating that.   MUAH! RIBBONS AND BOXES!

      so there i was, in my car, with my wonderful boyfriend...and i ruin everything. i tell him that i  may  have planned to hang out...with geoff....on the 13th..... i know that he hates him....but i don't i think I'm being this horrible horrible girlfriend...and at the same time, I can't be a horrible horrible friend. and he's scared of losing me....to HIM. but that won't happen. i gave him the worst feeling in the world: potientially being left...for some one else. Oh, but i should feel lucky, because I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT. I'm sorry I make you feel awful I'm sorry I am friends with him. I think you deserve more, much more than I can give.  I love you.

      so here i am at home, and I'm in a most peculiar mood. Sad, wired, excited to look pretty tommorow, hungry (now that I think about it), and lonely.   everything negative, I'm not sure why I'm feeling it, and it's not strong, but strong enough to feel. I'm not sad enough to cry, and I'm talking to Mike, so I haven't the faintest why I'm lonely.   I haven't written lately, and that is depressing, I feel like....If i write anything bad about mike and I, it will cause another fight, because his friend's will get on his case.  I don't have a private journal, because ti has never helped me feel better, ever. I dont like the idea, nor have i ever, of "writing the person you are angry with a letter and not sending it." i tried it, and it doesn't work for me. I've written bitterly, mean, compromising, four-letter words only, and none of it helps.   anyway,   jesus loves you, just not in that way.

      blogging, for adam's sake. (taken from the assignment for english) Day 2. December 20th, 2003. 7:00 p.m. 	 Heh. Family is out of town. I just got home from work and in about 2 hours, I’m going to go pick Mike up. Oh, I never do anything wrong. I don’t drink, I don’t smoke, and I won’t even think about touching drugs. And sex is most definitely out of the question. However, I need alone time to talk to him. And it’ll be fun. We’re exchanging presents…I wonder what he got me? I put thought into his presents. I ordered a t-shirt of his favorite band and a book about this web comic he reads. Also, I bought Adidas cologne and the Blood Brothers CD, “Burn Piano, Island Burn!” He would still have it, but when my CD case was stolen, that CD of his was in it… oops. But I’m going to go pick him up now.  Day 3. December 21st, 2003. 8:00 a.m.  	Oh, man last night was a blast!!  my Christmas presents rocked. Three pairs of cute socks, 2 pairs of undies, a candle, perfume, and a scarf!!! Oh, the scarf is so soft. He put a lot of thought into my presents, and I love him for it. The perfume is something I talked about a month or so ago, and he remembered it! I guess that I find that to be very endearing that he actually remembered something about me, but that’s the norm for him. Most of the other guys that I dated, were a lot less considerate of my feelings. Mike, is wonderful he’s sweet and kind, and I never feel like an inconvenience to him.   Day 4. December 26th, 2003.  today, is a stress day. I have tears in my eyes as I’m typing this, excuse any type-os. my day as follows:  wake up at 10:24 just to realize I need to be at work at 11.  get in the shower wash my hair and face.  run to my bedroom in bra and undies, trying to find work pants and shirt  get dressed, throw brush blow dryer and makeup into a bag.  run into the kitchen grab food and OJ  grab the bag and jump into my car.  driving to work while eating  run into work with my hair in a dripping wet bun and into the back room I go  brush my hair and dry it enough so as to not have it dripping down my back  put on make-up so I look human  down the rest of my OJ and then brush my teeth  run up front to my assistant manager saying, "Jess, I need to vent to you."  the 2 HUGE walls weren't done  the store wasn’t vacuumed  there were CD's laying around in the isles  the light bulbs weren't changed.  that set us back about 3 hours....  Zack and mark came in...  they really didn’t know where oh.....ANY CD'S WERE!!!!!  "jess where's Hilary duff? jess where's this jess where's that" OH MAN!  everything was on my shoulders  I had to ring up every thing, mark and Zack, are flaming retards. that’s it they are. well, they're cool, but I just couldn't deal with ignorant people today.   SHOOT-ME-IN-THE-FACE  post script. I know that I skipped a few days, I’ll get back to that, I just haven’t copied it into this yet.   Day 5. December 23rd, 2003. 11:00 p.m. 	Exhaused. That’s the word that comes to mind when I sit here. I have just danced for 6 hours and worked with grumpy customers for another 5. Let us recap: dancing and yelling (not singing mind you, you can’t sing at a normal tone of voice and except to be heard while trying to dance) from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and working with jerks from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. I hate it. And, I am the only person at my store to do anything! No one else makes an effort to make the store presentable and organized, no one. On the upside, I don’t work tomorrow and I don’t have Spotlighters until January 2nd. I’m going to bed now, because sleep is great.  Day 6. December 25th, 2003. 10:55 p.m.  	 I like waiting until either a half or full hour comes around before writing, but I just want to go to bed. Ok chritsmas eve rocked. I was disappointed that I didn’t get to see Tommy, but he had the flu. I got money, and a necklace from Tiffany and Co. oh man, I love it. It’s a delicate silver chain with a “J” on it. Personally I think it looks like an abstract Jesus fish. And today we were at my Aunt’s house and I got my secret Santa present from my cousin. Socks, a CD, lotion, I liked it. I feel bad though, because Mike doesn’t really have any family to celebrate Christmas with. I knew it bothered him, he  told me that he was lonely, even sitting in a room with 20 people, when he knows they aren’t his family. I really don’t know what to say to that, because I have always had a loving supportive family. Unlike his, who have disowned him. They are all: and I apologize for the language Mr. Westenburger: assholes.  I know that he’s a strong person, but only so much can happen before someone breakdown. I just know that I am the only good thing he has right now, and I won’t let him down.  Day 7. December 27th, 2003. 8:00 p.m. 	Heh, so I spent most of the day up in Madison with Geoff. I took him to work at 5. But when I tried to drive home, I got lost. It took me an hour and a half to get home. AN HOUR AND A HALF! I ended up in Lake Mills, how the heck I did I have no idea, but I walked into a gas station and by luck, some guy how had just come from a pipe laying job in Milton was in there. So he told me how to get back, thank god. Now, I’m going to curl up with my book Lamb by Christopher Cross. It’s hilarious. It’s about the “lost years” of Jesus, fictional, and I recommend it to everyone. …Like anyone will see this. Heh. Oh well. Anyway, on to reading.  Day 8. December 29th, 2003.  We said that we could work it out And that we would still talk But now that the tides have shifted  The sun doesn’t set  It’s the same small talk every time Conversations trail off into silence That awkward silence we swore we’d never have The sun doesn’t rise  Bring back the times that made us smile Our steps cushioned with security Of each other’s company The stars keep falling  Like you fall away from me When we talk, I miss you Our conversations trail off into silence…  Hm. Something that popped into my head. I thought I would add variety to my journal, considering that  if it was my actual journal, it would have like, 9,000 poems and such.  Day 8. December 30th, 2003. 11:30 p.m. 	Mike, is the greatest. We just laid on my futon in the rec-room and talked. About, our favorite Disney movies and his traveling experiences. By traveling I mean, being forced to move every 3-9 months because his parents were in the Air Force, and he always traveled with them and lived on base. I have never been much of a traveler, nor do I want to. Most people after high school, want to take a year off and travel abroad. I don’t want to experience that. I just want to get my degrees, get a job, buy a house, and start my life as soon as possible. I know I’m going to be in college for a while, getting a degree in marketing and then in psychology, but I want to start a career as soon as possible. I want to be a successful clinical psychologist who lives in the middle-upper class. I want to be married before I’m 30 and have only one kid. I don’t really like children, but I think that view might change. I just have to start having some more tolerance to be able to have a kid running around screaming and stuff. Ah well, that’s still kind of far off…I don’t want to grow up.  Day 9. January 1st, 2004! 10:00 a.m. 	So I’m hella excited and tried all at the same time. My new year’s was ok, I got to see Mikey. We went to Carrie’s house and then to the Microtel Inn to another party, but stayed there  only 45 minutes and then went back to my house. Sat downstairs and watched the ball drop. HAPPY NEW YEAR!!! And today, after work, he’s taking me to a movie. Whee! I think that we’re going to see The Last Samurai. It looks super good, but I don’t know if I want to go see an action movie. Meh. I do want to see Mona Lisa Smile, haha, but I won’t make my boyfriend see such a chick flick. I’m way nicer than that.  But, I have to go to work. The only reason I was put on the schedule, was because they knew I wouldn’t be hung over. Stupid drinkers. I hate alcohol. Bye!  Day 10. January 2nd, 2004. 3:30 a.m. 	I don’t feel like a writer. I am not good with descriptions, and I don’t like to be lengthy. This assignment, is great, because I can write what I want. Ands if I can’t site 3 examples of why my New Year’s sucked or not, I won’t get marked down. This has given me a place to write, without judgment, I hope, and freely. I know it wasn’t a BAD journal, where I revealed all of my deepest darkest secrets, but I never will write those down.

      the answer is not really. Please dont go getting my cds, my parents wont give them to you. Dont blame me for hanging up, i did it for the best. You were complaining on why i was mad, it wasnt mike at all this time. It was how you want to talk to me so bad because i was in Pr and than went and talked to other people. I took that as very disrespectful. I dont hate you, i just dont want to be accociated with you if you are going to keep getting worse and worse. I first met you and i was in aw, you know that. Than you started growing into something i didnt like and it just snowballed. I dont really want to talk to you if i cant feel comfortable with you. Right now, thats how i feel. Thats probably how i will always feel. Sorry, you have moved on and so have i. I guess i moved on in a more blunt fasion.  enjoy, Geoff ps, dont e-mail back with how much of an ass i am in this email. I'm just stating how i feel. you will get the photos in the mail, not from my mom. Dont call them complaining about me either. Thats childish. Coming from me, that one should sting.  ____________________________________________________________________________________  i hate him. im so pissed at him. he hurts me liek this all the FUCKIGN TIME! and i let him. i didnt do anything worng, anything bad. ya know i try to be nice to him and i didnt do anything wrong. i answered mikes question and he FLIPPED out.  fucking dick.

      It's Not- aimee mann  I keep going round and round on the same old circuit A wire travels underground to a vacant lot Where something I can't see interrupts the current And shrinks the picture down to a tiny dot And from behind the screen it can look so perfect But it's not  So here I'm sitting in my car at the same old stoplight I keep waiting for a change but I don't know what So red turns into green turning into yellow But I'm just frozen here on the same old spot And all I have to do is to press the pedal But I'm not No, I'm not  People are tricky, you can't afford to show Anything risky anything they don't know The moment you try, you kiss it goodbye  So baby kiss me like a drug like a respirator And let me fall into the dream of the astronaut Where I get lost in space that goes on forever And you make all the rest just an afterthought And I believe it's you who could make it better But it's not No, it's not No, it's not

       "how we WERE.  we were us, and nothing else mattered. ya know? and even though, you know it will never be that way again, you still want it. you want it back in your arms or back in the kisses you shared. you want it back in the conversation and the laughter, that even though it may be there, it lacks....that something you can't put into a word, or a definition. it's gone, and it feels empty and you hate it. it's the sad feeling that makes the tears appear, even though you thought you've cried until you couldn't cry anymore."

      Quiet was the dawn as they lay down their bed of sand, staring off into the endlessness of blue. For so long they stared until the beauty became too much. She kissed him, and he kissed her. They kissed until it wasn't any longer. It was something so much more. They were communicating; talking to each other in a new language known only to them; understanding only by the movements of their lips and tongues. Their passion burned so violently that the sand beneath them melted and turned to glass, which shattered, reflecting the brilliance of the infant sun.  Affholder, great poem.  :-D

      "bye?" "bye." she hung up the reciever and looked at the wall. hm, it isn't personal, but it always feels like it is. "hey," "yea." "I'm always here for you" "yea" why, why can't he see that I'm there for him? she has that running through her head, and wishes that things would finally work out for him. she hopes that sometime soon, God will look down on him and Smile really big. she sees that he's struggling, and that she can't do anything but be there for him, and hug him, and tell him things will work out. she believes it too, because even though he doesn't realize it, he is a beautiful and strong person. and she feels bad when she runs to him, in shambles, when his problems rise above her petty insignificant situations. and she gets scared when, she knows that she might never see him again.  fin.

Idiot.  and seriously, who is such a bitch to tell someone to die.  it is a bit inconsiderate.   for future reference, i know that i am loved, so you saying anything...really wont get to me.

      I open my mouth, unleashing sounds too beautiful for human ears. I speak in poetry. I sing in prose. Some people get annoyed. They can't comprehend true beauty. I suppose I could cater to them. I could spend a day without singing, but why stop there? I won't speak, write, sing, or sign. Hell, screw one single day, I'll go for a month… a year. Again, why stop there? I could start a revolution. A rebellion, if you will, for people who share that one desire… the desire of a world basking in an awkward silence. I could find all of them. I'd gather them into one giant room. No invitations will be needed. They'll be inexplicably drawn to it by an inextricable force. Little will be heard as they shuffle through the aisles, only the sound of pins cascading over a balcony. They'll fill up seats by the thousands, countless names on a clipboard. And when my hall is filled to the brim, I'll exit ever so quietly… and I'll blow that fucker to pieces.    "charles" affholder rocks.

      how how HOW! could you LIE to ME about something like that. HOW!  i think it may hurt more that it was a lie this entire time....because i was getting over the situation....but i guess there was nothing to get over.  this is.. sick.  and yet, i want to hold.....again.   i cant do this.   consider me written out of your life.   because, thats how i feel. i feel if you can lie about something so fucking huge and hurtful...i didn't matter in the first place.

      lets play name this tune. and artist. c'mon people. I'll give you a prize. first one wins. ;-)  I have a friend, he is made mostly of pain. He wakes up, drives to work, and then straight back home again. He once cut one of my nightmares out of paper. I thought it was beautiful, I put it on a record cover. And I tried to tell him he had a sense of color and composition so magnificent. And he said "Thank you, please but your flattery is truly not becoming me. Your eyes are poor. You are blind. You see, no beauty could have come from me. I am a waste of breath, of space, of time." I knew a woman, she was dignified and true. Her love for her man was one of her many virtues. Until one day, she found out that he had lied and decided the rest of her life, from that point on would be a lie.   But she was grateful for everything that had happened. And she was anxious for all that would come next. But then she wept. What did you expect? In that big, old house with all those cars she kept. "Oh!" and "such is life," she often said. With one day leading her to the next, you get a little closer to your death, which was fine with her. She never got upset and with all the days she may have left, she would never clean another mess or fold his shirts or look her best. She was free to waste away alone. Last night, my brother he got drunk and drove. And this cop pulled him off to the side of the road.   And he said, "Officer! Officer! You have got the wrong man. No, no, I'm a student of medicine, the son of a banker, you don't understand!" The cop said, "No one got hurt, you should be thankful. And you carelessness, it is something awful. And no, I can't just let you go. And though your father's name is known, your decisions are yours alone. You are nothing but a stepping stone on a path to debt, to loss, to shame." The last few months I have been living with this couple. Yeah, you know, the kind that buy everything in doubles. They fit together, like a puzzle. I love their love and I am thankful that someone actually receives the prize that was promised by all those fairy tales that drugged us. And they still do me.   I'm sick, lonely, no laurel tree, just green envy. Will my number come up eventually? Like Love is some kind of lottery, where you can scratch and see what is underneath. It's "Sorry", just one cherry, "Play Again." Get lucky. So I have been hanging out down by the train's depot. No, I don't ride. I just sit and watch the people there. They remind me of wind up cars in motion. The way they spin and turn and jockey for positions. And I want to scream out that it is all nonsense. And that their lives are one track, and can't they see how it is all pointless? But then, my knees give under me. My head feels weak and suddenly it is clear to see that it is not them but me, who has lost my self-identity.   As I hide behind these books I read, while scribbling my poetry, like art could save a wretch like me, with some ideal ideology that no one can hope to achieve. And I am never real; it is just a sketch of me. And everything I have is trite and cheap and a waste of paint, of tape, of time. Sometimes I park my car down my the cathedral, where floodlights point up at the steeples. Choir practice is filling up with people. I hear the sound escaping as an echo. Sloping off the ceiling at an angle. When voices blend they sound like angels. I hope there is still some room left in the middle. But when I lift my voice up now to reach them. The range is too high, way up in heaven. So I hold my tongue, forget the song, tie my shoe and start walking off. And try to just keep moving on, with my broken heart and my absent God and I have no faith but it is all I want, to be loved ad believe in my soul.

      how can you still love someone, when you're with someone else. how can it hurt so bad, to hear their voice, when you care. i, can't figure it out. i can't figure this out.  i'm happy with chris, i really am. but, why can't i get mike out of my head? is it because we're not together?  god, this is, just fucked up.

           Mike and I hung out last night! it was wonderful.      So right after school, I had to go to hallmark to talk to my manager. We talked and then i was going to leave. Oh, but first i needed to go to the bank and take out money for my project. OS i go to the bank and withdraw $50. Then i start walking back to where i parked, but i stopped to talk to Aaron and then I got my movie back! yes! So i run home, jump in the shower, shave my legs and wash up. I got out and put on a really cute outfit. Short dark blue denim skirt with pinstripes and a fitted white shirt. I put my black and white checkered belt, my black flipflops, my sisters earrings and my studded collar. i threw my hair up to get it out of my face, and carefully put on my makeup. i brushed my hair out, put on my body spray and then applied some lipstick. I got in my car put on my sungalsses and drove over to Mike's to pick him up. I get there, and he's wearing his black hat, the grey atticus shirt underneath the light greenish blue striped dress shirt, a pair of one of the many written and drawn on jeans, mis-matched white socks, and black tennis shoes. Scruffy and looking tired, he walked with me to my car.       When we got to Fuddruckers, we waited in line for Benson and talked ot her for a bit. I had a 1/3 lb. bacon cheesburger and a strawberry shake. mike had a 2/3 lb. hot rocks? waht that it? and a chocolate shake, and fries. I put A1 and honey mustard on my burger. After dinner, we went over to Michael's and i got mat board for my project and stickers. Then we went back to my house and hung out in the basement. he layed on the couch, i cut my mat board. we talked, we laughed, we cuddled.      It made me happy and sad, all at the same time.

      I have had my blog for one year and twelve days. 12 is a weird looking word......i copy and pasted it onto word to see if i spelled it correctly. hm. so i don't know what's wrong with me, but I'm starting to like the AE, AF, and Hollister styles more and more. and i ridicule people for shopping there, wel I used to. I just think the prices are outrageous. stupid prices. anyway. the mini skirts, the sheer tank tops, the colors! i don't wear colors. i wear white, black, red, and blue...dark blue. and now, I'm starting to like stuff of "the norm" is that bad? shit, my music is still the same......WHY AM I SO CAUGHT UP ON THIS! i think it's because i LOVE individuality. i don't do the pyrimids and TONS of bracelets anymore...really the last time i was "Original Heimark" to quote Chris Bakke, was at the talent show. I dunno, whatever.   6gb

      hm. new set up. i think i like it. or, maybe it's this computer.  anyway, I'm really excited that I drove my best friend to drink.  i think that, when you say you're best friends, you should talk instead of ignoring.  ou sat me down beside myself To show me all the reasons I was wrong for you Was this for real? It's hard to tell 'Cause it was such a beautiful mess we had got into  I'm gonna overcome this paper heart and win this time And all along, I should've known that this wasn't your dream, it was mine I know you wanted me to give up this life to be Everything I was back when you had the hands my heart was in I was never good at goodbye  Can I swallow this bottle whole? So, this brain in my head  Can forget your face  When we were starting out, you believed in me without a doubt You were the finest thing to happen to a boy like me It's so much harder, now, I wanna try and tell you how There is so much love in me, even though it's hard to see I was never good at goodbye  Can I swallow this bottle whole? So, this brain in my head  Can forget your face Can I swallow this bottle whole? 'Cause I'd rather be dead Then make more mistakes  Today I couldn't stay awake Feels like i'm drowning in this firewater lake I won't be sleeping much tonight It's not the same without you lying by my side Right beside me  Can I swallow this bottle whole? So, this brain in my head  Can forget your face Can I swallow this bottle whole? 'Cause I'd rather be dead Then make more mistakes  I know you wanted me To give up my life to be Everything I am, when you're the Only thing that I can see  I'm sorry, but you're not the The only one for me  You left me, here, beside myself Left me with all the reasons I was wrong for you   that song, is beautiful. especially since its played all acoustic style  god, i have so much on my mind, THAT I WONT POST SINCE IT'S NOT MY BUSINESS.

      one more day of junior year....and i think i should write about it.  this year, has been the most Substantial of the three years at craig. The most growth, and the best times. There are people that I have reconciled with, and some that i have, not consciously, "broken" up with. There hasn't been so much drama, IN SCHOOL anyway, as there was last year, and that was refreshing. My classes, towards the end, were mostly bitter. We all wanted to get out of there, Spanish and Algebra Adv. especially. My favorite teacher was Ms. Krajco, hands down. She's just such a wonderful person. And she hated Brandon, which was a plus. My least favorite class....probably Spanish. bad classroom, bad teacher, bad chemistry among some of the students. If i would have had a different teacher, I would say Photo was my favorite class, but Cossette....is a dumbwhore. Although that class gave me the oppurtunity to get to know Erin better....:-/ hm. I'm still really confused on what happened two days ago Erin. sorry again.   Spots, was one of the best and worst times this year.....and it's gonna go down next year as well. I can proudly say, that I was on Spots the "first" year it happened. And I got to meet and get closer to a lot of people I probably wouldn't have had the chance to. It gave me something to do after school, something to both enjoy and hate, as with anything you do. I'm gonna say 80% love, 15% hate, 5% not caring at all. I liked everyone in it, Especially Ryan Wilson, who I'm going to miss seeing in the Halls terribly. Him, Tyler Davidson, and Tim Haase, who alrady left Craig to go to Parker, but is also grauating this year. Those three, oh my....heartbreaking. They are amazing human beings, with beautiful hearts and open minds.   My best friend, started home school at semester, which was hard for me to deal with at first, but it turned out ok....Until she decided to live with her mother in hawaii for 3 months. :-( sad. I miss her, considering I was planning on hanging out with her all summer, but heyyyyy it's ok, It's just getting me used to how it's going to be after senior year....oh I'm not even going down that path.  Geoff, Geoff, Geoff....I started this school year with him...we broke up....."remained close" and if I even tried to explain the fucked up relationship I had with him....I'd probably break down. He left the country on Febuary 3rd I believe....for a year and  a half. And I wish he could be somewhere safer than Iraq. I needed emotional time away from him. I can't talk to him right now, because although he's "changing for the better" like he's said to me a million times before, I've reached my breaking point with that kid. Hopefully, I'll be able to calm down enough to be friends with him again, but for now, I can't without getting angry tears....  But I have mellowed out. I have grown a lot. I have matured. And I am learning how to stop being such a baby. I am emotional...that won't ever change...but I'm taking more things in stride and keeping my cool much more than last year, when i was an emotional wreck.   I would have to say, that Mike....was my most significant "thing" or "period" of this year....And still is. He and I connected in a way that I haven't found with anyone else. On weird things too. We both have one dimple, on the left side of our face. We both broke our right wrist, in the same spot, and it was a hairline fracture. He has lived everywhere...and we both moved to Janesville within 3 weeks of eachother. The first song I ever heard by Bright Eyes, "The Calendar Hung Itself" is the same one he heard. Same with Azure Ray, The song "Displaced". its the dumb things that no one else in the world cares about except for the two of you. because i know no one else cares! and then we broke up.....in Febuary...it was one of the hardet break ups. And I was told that he slept with someone a week and a day after we broke up....apparently....he didn't which was told to me like a month ago.....but where's the trust now. It was hard, especially, when I actually saw her like 3 weeks after finding that out. It was the hardest thing to sit in a room, with someone I thought touched Mike...b/c they weren't together, nor did they date. But...even knowing that they only "fooled around" I still look at her as the biggest whore....e-v-e-r. and we basically broke up because we fought A LOT and because of Chris, who I am currently dating.  He treats me like a queen...and yet....I miss Mike. I am, so easily taken....no....I forgive and trust those I care about very easily. And Mike is now being who he was when I fell for him. Chris...is so clingy and touchy-feely a-l-l t-h-e t-i-m-e. He says I love you like 4985398753455093859034534 inthe short period we hang out. And it gets old, real fast. There is a line between sweet and annoying, and he crossed it. At the same time, he is the nicest boy..ever. Every girl should want a guy like him....just a little moreassertive. He's like a puppy....that follows me everywhere. I walk into the kitchen. he's right there. I walk back to the living room, and he's right behind me. I go back to the kitchen to get a freaking glass of water, where's Chris? RIGHT THERE. I mean c'mon.   Dances:  Homecoming. oh my god. I got a kidney infection, most likely from having sex. :-/ but Mike cared for me that night, in my bedroom, since I couldn't move. I had a migrane, i was throwing up, my kidney was throbbing, and i had a fever of 104 that night. He spent the night getting me water, rubbing me down with a cool washcloth and making sure I didn't die.. :-/. the next day, my temprature shot up, and i went to the emergency room. my temp reached a dangerous 106.5..but he came in and calmed me down.   Prom. fantastic. :-) group: Chris, Me, Nate, Bri. Duck Inn, Filet Mingon. Made court whee!! Didn't get queen aw. A little disappointing, but the dance rocked! then us four went back to the room chris rented at the baymont and chilled till about 2:30. then Chris and I passed out. yup. we slept. on prom. heh. i think it's funny. so then I get up the next morning and get ready for breakfast with Bri and RICK!!!!! we went to Parkside, on Milwaukee......that's the name of it right? anyway, belgium waffle with strawberries and whipped cream, I downed it in like 5 minutes. Delish. The rest of the day I with Chris.   I also changed jobs. I now work at Hallmark...because Sam Goody closed. damn. It wasn't the best transition, but hey, it's a job. I miss Sam Goody, or any job that would actually be enjoyable to go to....damnit. It's alright though.  I got drunk for the first time this year. 12 shots of UV Vodka. I don't like being drunk.  I don't think this year has been too bad actually. a lot less emotionally draining than last year, and a hell of a lot more fun. The friends I made, the late nights at Bri's, being able to just d-r-i-v-e. Sharing myself with others, and learning to not hate myself so much. Learning that I'm worth much more than Geoff ever let me think, and being thankful that I had people to tell me that. I'm learning, slowly to love myself.

      *note* this is a venting entry, among other things*  mike, sean, and I went to follies. but, I don't like sean, he's annoying, and disregards what society is ok. and by no means do i mean confomrity and shit, and how he should conform, it's common sense stuff. us three were in perkins after follies,and he would swear, LOUDLY. and I dont care about swearing, it's somthing i do quite often...hm. but not in a FAMILY RESTAURANT. my god! it's just common sense. and mike said, "hey, maybe we'll get kicked out of here, too." real funny. and I know that there have probably been worse customers, but, i don't need attention drawn to my table, especially when it's because someone's a loudmouth. and all they were doing is talking about inside jokes, how "cool" of you. and it seems that mike just becomes loud and rude when he's with him, greeeeeeat. and he's smoking. before follies, after follies....ick.  back to follies. Hilarious. high points:  annie jezo being a slut.  steven being satan.. ("SATAN!!!!!...forgot his gameboy..") classic.  erin prancing around stage with dasies and acting...i think like cheri oteri from SNL.  erin dropping her flower basket under the stage.  JAY FALLING INTO THE STAGE TO GET IT! OH YEA!!! i love that man.  having a dance in follies. I suggest you don't do it every year, but it was awesome!!!!!!!!  jordan jackson?????? :-D    then after that we went back to mikes. it got better at his apt, cause sean was mellow there, whereas he should have been shutting up at perkins. guh, and just when i was mellowing out, who shows up? AMY!!! aka CONSUELA! I'll be fine eventually, but friday wasn't the "ok" time.gr....that angered me, but then i got all protective and territorial over mike, couldn't help it. :-/ i just....don't like her.  so i went home...and slept.

      I had a dream about you. Maybe it was because of last night. The shuffling, the muffled voices through the phone, the click of the line goind dead. Yea, I think that's what caused it.  I was in the airport, coming back from Mexico. There I saw people, so many people. And my heart stopped. There you were with you're new best friend, and everyone was hugging you and greeting you. You were wearing that navy blue The Used t-shirt that I've never seen anyone else with, and a black zip-up hoodie. Heh, I just went to their site to look at that shirt. You were wearing those jeans you always wear, ya'know the ones with the rufio plane patch? You had on two necklaces, one replacing the one I broke. Your hair, always looking tousled, and you're one left dimple showing itself everytime you smiled at someone you hadn't seen for a while. Your eyes, they look so tired, have you not been sleeping? I kept to the shadows for a while, dripping wet because I just got out of the deep end of the pool. Yes, a pool. I couldn't take it anymore, I ran up behind you, stopped just short of running into you, and stood behind you out of breath. You slowly turned around, and looked at me. You stopped, everything stopped. Everyone kept pulling at you and grabbing for your attention, so I put my eyes to the ground, and waited my turn, nothing new I suppose. I grew tired of it, and I pushed the short blonde out of my way and embraced you, so tight and close, I could smell you.  I asked where you had been, you said "I've been driving."  So that's why you looked so tired.  I asked where. You said "Down through Illinois, Mostly in Kentucky, because it was so green, then I stayed in Mississippi for two weeks, and Louisiana for two. We're in Florida just cause, fancy seeing you here."  I wonder why those girls keep giving me bad looks.   Cut to: My basement, both of us on the futon you laying down and myself laid upon you.  Kiss Kiss Kiss Kiss. "Hey, knock it off, we already decided not to do this."  He's right.  I can't help it.  I rub up against you and kiss your neck. "Stop it! Now."  Damnit! This is horrible.  I cried and you held me, and whispered comfort into my ear, slowing my sobs to chokes I held in my throat.  Cut to: The airport again, filled with chaos and feet. Scuffling everywhere, just trying to get closer to you, and I keep getting stepped on.  I wonder who the blonde was that I pushed out of my way.  Apparently it's your soon to be girlfriend. And if it wasn't fair for me to grow green with envy, I still did. I'm prettier than her anyway.  But that's not comforting at all.   You told me that while you and your new best friend were on your road trip, you crashed HIS car, and that you were lucky to be alive. I went to hug you, but you shrugged me off, and told me you had to go. Eight people followed you, including that little blonde. I stood in my bikini, confused, wanting to reach to you. I found the negatives you dropped out of the picture envelope. They were beautiful, 8 pictures of nature teaching people how ignorant we can be and how much we take for granted, and 2 of a beautiful cemetary, with statues of angels and crosses,  on top of hills and trees shading the old woman from the sun.  By the time I looked up, I was the only person in the terminal, waiting for my luggage, like none of what we talked about or what I saw, or how i wrapped my arms around you, ever happened.  I woke up crying.

      Ok, it's been exactly 2 weeks since I got back from Mexico. And every day has been total hell. I broke up with Chris and got back together with him in the matter of 24 hours, all because of an ultimatum made by Mike. "We're either all or nothing." and I panicked. So i broke up with him. And I thought that i should have some time to think about things before i started another relationship, but that didn't make Mike too happy. And that royally pissed me off. I thought I deserved to think about what I wanted to do in this situation, but apparently I was supposed to know right away. So I got back together with Chris, because he and I talked about things. On top of that, this guy I met down in Mexico seemed amazing and sweet, so I was trying to not think like that about him. But when he found out that I was back with Chris, he just sulked and put me ona major guilt trip. See ya, Jamie.&nbsp; So then i go over to Mike's to give him back some of his shit, and he has, one of my Cd's. Currently, Glassjaw is NOT in my Possession. Continuing on. Bri surprised me by being home early which was wonderful, lemme tell ya. But lately, she's been being dramatic, and bitchy towards me. I can tell that we're&nbsp; making eachother tense, but eh. We both have a lot on our minds.  Then I'm working at Maurices, the sidewalk sale..........GEOFF. comes up to me, out of fucking nowhere.&nbsp; I didn't think that my chain of guys would have involved him. It freaked me the fuck out. It made me happy and extremely furious at the&nbsp;same time. eep.&nbsp; So we made plans to talk and have breakfast the following week, but surprise surprise, he canceled whatever, it bothered me that he canceled and at the same time, I didn't give a shit.&nbsp; Speaking of, he talked to me online wasted, that was interesting. And then Jake and Wayne, Jake. oh goodness, hitting on me hardcore, while he has a girlfriend that I go to school with, and then every fucking guy telling me that "Oh, if you weren't so hot, I wouldn't like you." apparently, my personality is vapid and shallow. I know guysthink that's a compliment, but no, it's not when that's all you heard from Geoff for a year and a half, then telling me I don't have a personality whatsoever. GAH. and Mike, I can't even begin to say how much I'm hurting, because we can't talk. I'm so sorry Mike. Everyday seems to just get fucking worse. I drove to Mike's yesterday, and the drive there, I was behind a Mack truck and I was thinking how easy it would be to drive into the back of it.............

       i was in SUCH a good mood today, mostly because Mike and I talked for like 2 1/2 hours, and the start of the conversation was: "What did you think of The Things They Carried?"  And that made me so happy. We talked about books, and movies, and a pinch of music. Talk of work and school, and the tone was light and sarcastic. And we laughed, god it's been too long since we've laughed together. And it wasn't an uncomfortable laugh. gah. i love it.      then work, and that was fantastic, I love Maurices, it's so fun. I fucking love it. LOVE IT! lol      except when I walk past Bri and get a shitty attitude because I'm upset with her? hm, doesn't make sense, considering i wasn't the one to lie to her, and ditch her, and put my feelings aside. Nope, that definately wasn't me.                                                      I feel like a ghost sometimes too.    6

      I'm only pretty sure that I can't take anymore Before you take a swing, I wonder what are we fighting for When I say out loud, I want to get out of this I wonder, is there anything I'm going to miss? I wonder how's it gonna be, When you don't know me? How's it gonna be, When you're sure I'm not there? How's it gonna be, When there's   no one there to talk to  ? Between you and me 'Cause I don't care, how's it gonna be How's it gonna be? Where we used to laugh, There's a shouting match Sharp as a thumbnail scratch   A silence I can't ignore   Like the hammock by the doorway we spent time in, Swings empty I don't see lightning like last fall when it was always about to hit me I wonder how's it gonna be, when it goes down?   How's it gonna be, when you're not around?   How's it gonna be, when you found out there was nothin' between you and me? 'Cause I don't care, how's it gonna be And how's it gonna be, when you don't know me anymore? And how's it gonna be Wanna get myself back in again The soft dive of oblivion I wanna taste the salt of your skin The soft dive of oblivion, oblivion How's it gonna be,   when you don't know me anymore  ? How's it gonna be How's it gonna be How's it gonna be Hmmm
