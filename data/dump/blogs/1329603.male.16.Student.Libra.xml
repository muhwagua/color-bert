       I went to Specsavers today to have mein eye-test... well... I waltzed into the outlet, feeling particularly secure with myself (I haven't been wearing my glasses for 2 days because I'm beginning to feel that I look better without them on), and so I went up the stairs for my optical examination, closely trailed by my mother.  I tried to have a cup of tea when the optician, a fairly short man with dark skin and a strange American-English accent, walked in, leaving me with no option other than to bin the cup of tea I had just made myself from the machine. It wasn't as if it was particularly aesthetic, as it had powdered milk, but I had been thirsty for quite some time. After some abroo-ha-ha with the Optician, I put my hat back on and went downstairs to choose some frames (my prescription had changed enough to warrant a new pair of glasses) from the budget lines. After about 5 minutes relentless searching (with various calls of "put THOSE back" from my ever-traditional mother), I found a normal-looking pair which I then got fitted. A cute Anglo-Indian girl of about my height then served us, checking the prescription form for any errors. Unfortunately, the Optician had left off my pupil length from the records. So, up the stairs I went, this time leaving my mother behind and going with the cute girl. A different, very English, optician took my pupil length in a matter of seconds and soon the prescription was complete. I have  to go back and collect my new glasses at 2:00... a little too descriptive, no? Seriously, I'm impressed if you've managed to wade through all that.  I'm pretty tired and the lack of glasses is becoming disturbing for my eyes...  Ah, and I'm learning JavaScript a bit. I did about 8 hours worth of lessons in about 3/4 yesterday and it's a 24 hour book, so in total it should only take me about 15 hours to complete, I reckon (calculated by the fact that the later chapters cover more difficult topics).  Anyway, I'm going to walk into town in a bit. See you later.  Love, Jon Roskilly

       You are most like the Evangelion character: Maya Ibuki      You are a Submissive Extrovert, which makes you a great team player and a wonderful person to work with and be around. You are very much like Maya Ibuki, the computer expert who is both social and a very productive person under the leadership of others. Many of your personality aspects also match Rei's, and your Extrovert side would help foster a relationship with her. Overall, your prospects with Rei look good.   You are 73% compatible with Rei.

       Have you ever wanted to get something off of your chest about someone, to that person? And not mind if they ignored it, or whether they replied or not? Have you ever just wanted to SCREAM it at them, but know they'd probably vow to never speak to you again? If you haven't, you won't understand what I'm feeling right now, but the majority of people will know how I'm feeling.  Love, Jon Roskilly

       I'm knackeréd........ I totally redid  urlLink fansites  last night, I completed and uploaded the  urlLink Rei listing , made a form for people with OE and told people who don't have OE to email me, and generally was productive in the web stakes. However, I have discovered that there is already a fanlisting for Rei on Fanlistings.org so I'm not going to get on there. Booger. But, I'm still on at Fansites. No-one can take me off there. Or if they try I can do nasty things to them using sporks.  Sam's back from Greenbelt and Brownie camp etc. so woooo her. I'm not a great person for not waffling on, so I'll endeavour not to, but she's back, so... kind of yay. Everything seemed quieter while she wasn't here.  I didn't realise we went back next week, I thought it was the week after... that's 2 years in a row I've done that. Meh, it's just because if I had my way we WOULD have a week more. Not just because I'm wrong. Noooooooo.  Anyway, my blog @ and-then is not looking like it'll be finished within the week, but we live in hope. Have a good afternoon.  Love, Jon Roskilly

       I think I scared Marx last night, I talked to him for aaaages and I was fairly high after drinking too much coke... so I shouted WHEEEEEEEE at him a few times, generally making him do the confused face on MSN at me a lot. I still prefer O_o though. It looks like Pete.  Anyway... Patrick has raised a fairly good point today, being that Sam was only gone for 3 days. Soooooooooo... is she back? I doubt it, but still... why hasn't she blogged? I believe she must have misjudged and she was actually gone for a week, but said she was gone for 3 days. I think. Well, it's logical because it's something I'd do. Yeah...  I've started on a Rei Ayanami fanlisting ^_^ I'm getting totally obsessed with Rei, actually, it's unnerving. I'm even dreaming about her now. Believe me, there's nothing scarier than seeing yourself as an anime character. Unless you're Zoe and then you're not far off anyway. (Sorry!)  Lennon is being incredibly unnerving. Suddenly, for no apparent reason, it's working. Linden, the computer man, came round yesterday and said I'd have to demolish it and reinstall Windows. And suddenly.... workage! I don't understand it. Norton found a coupla viruses but I don't think that should sort out the whole computer... never mind...  Once the Rei listing is up, everyone who reads this has to go and watch Evangelion so that they can join!  Love, Jon Roskilly

       Hi again.  Marcus' blog is beginning to annoy me, apart from him going on about losing Sam which is about as likely as me getting her back, his constant pessimism makes it a lot harder for me to be optimistic! Arghifarghy.  I don't know whether it's rebound but I'm beginning to fancy some of the people I thought were just friendly before... I'm not going to make any moves while I'm not sure. Actually, I'm probably using it as an excuse, because I am on the whole a complete coward. In the movies where the people go for a wonderful adventure, I'd be the bloke who was thrilled with the idea but when it came to it ran off crying.  Love, Jon Roskilly

       Right, it's 3:39 PM and I'm mysteriously NOT at Sarah's. Meh, oh well.  Anyway, I'm still in the library... however, Linden, the computer bloke, is coming round at around 6:00, so I should then be able to go on for a decent amont of time at home. Hooray!   V.7.2  of my site is now up and running, and I'm urrently in the design stage for a blog... if all goes well I should have a self-hosted blog by the end of the week, and I can stop using this one. Which'll be useful, reliability is always good.  Anyways, I'm going to... who knows? There's only so much one can do around here.  Love, Jon Roskilly

       Hooray! I'm a berk! I don't know why but I find that endearing. Patrick called me a berk on his blog, and for some reason that's made me unassailably happy. God only knows why.  I'm constantly singing (and playing on the piano) Hallelujah, from the Shrek soundtrack. I think it's by Rufus Wainright, but whoever it's by it's cool. So I keep singing it. I've just got hold of the lyrics, and I now know I've been doing it wrong, but who cares?  Lennon IS BEING AN ARSEHOLE so my blogging is being done here, at the library. Woohoo. Meep. I liked Lennon. Now it's really being annoying at me. It should revert to its previous stage of being nice.  Oh, and the song I have chosen to get together for Tom's band is.... It's A Kind of Magic. I have the chords (which appear to be incorrect) and the bass tab (which appears to be incorrect) so it's all going smoothly... yeah...  My belief is that Sam is at Brownie camp, which makes it harder for me to drop her birthday present round. I've been meaning to since the 23rd, when I got back from Stanners'.  Meh, she can have it when she gets back, I'm not going to lose any sleep over it. It's only a bracelet...  Zoe's not on much anymore... or at least I always miss her when she's online. One or the other. Well, she could have blocked me but I don't think I've done anything to warrant it so I'll try to not be paranoid about that.  Suz is coming out of the "Loony Bin" (as Marcus and Suz both call it) and so she'll be on my computer a lot. Caedmon isn't connecting for some reason, so she's having to use Lennon and basically it can't cope with me, never mind Suz. Oh well. Gwen's using it a lot, too... it's a lot of strain for the old guy.  Anyway, I don't know when I'll be able to blog again.... Ooh, I'm going round Sarah's tomorrow. She just randomly asked me... Iao, I'm a bit nervous about the whole thing but I'm sure I'm just being paranoid... yeah...  Peace, Jon Roskilly

       It's now 10:15PM and Stanners has fallen asleep again. So I've stolen the computer again.  Chrissie has generally scared me... I'm fed up with everyone telling me that Marcus is better than me. And that he's nicer than me. And is generally superior. NGH.  Anyway, going back home tomorrow, Suz has got a domain and I'm considering leaving And-then to join hers. Iao though. Probably won't. But then again... I'm not going to get a petition done to keep me in, like Marcus did, but I like And-then... then again, probably for the same reason I'd like Suz's... but I'm cut out of enough things without And-then as well...

       OK, 2:05 PM and Stanners has fallen asleep. So I've stolen the PC. Oooh.  Spent most of today playing DoA2, that's been fun, unlocked Tengu who says things like "THIS IS THE WAY OF TENGU" and such... yeah...  Sam war annoyed about comment with general chest-region, so I'll try not to blog too often about that... sorry Sam....  Anyway, guten abend.  Give peace a chance, Jon Roskilly

       Well, hello again. Welcome back to my blog. I don't entirely want to have it up but somehow I'm feeling it necessary to tell people like Sam who are always offline when I'm on what's going on. Not that they particularly care, but it's nice for people to be informed, isn't it? I know I like being informed. "A teenage bride with a baby inside, getting high off information."  As RHCP fans will recognise, I'm quite far in my attempt to learn all of the words for Californication. I need the last segment and then I'm done. Hurrah! Then the afore-named Tubular Luggage can play it and have a singer who is capable, because he knows the words! Hussah thrice times! Hussah once more!  I got my GCSE RE result today... I got an A (whoopee!!!!) and so generally I'm a little bit "whoo" today. Well, I would be but I have some really bitter feeling that have come up so I'm trying to get them back down again. It's useful to have someone cheery to help you if you're down. I want to be that person again. Not the person I am now.  Anyway, yeah, generally spent today with Stanners discussing my experiences in Sam's computer room... sorry Sam! Stanners just said he kept thinking about your breasts and so we got talking... about your breasts... well... sorry! *hides*  ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE amount of hugs to Zoe and Lisa for their GCSE results! They are... very, VERY clever and should be showered wi......th Vodka! You know, those kinds of parties tend to have large amounts of alkyhole! Whoopee!  And no, I'm not high. I did have an energy tab though.... many dextrose. Maybe I'm a bit high then... ah well. Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!  All you need is love, Jon Roskilly

       I think you'll find me talking about Sam's blog a little more now, it's got more developed.  She made a wonderful point about people worrying about you. It's not a direct quote, but she said that people worrying about her was driving her mad. Which is very true, isn't it? It's nice for some people close to you to ask if you're OK but if someone you've met like once is worried about you... and then EVERYONE is worried about you... It's very daunting and if you're not OK it's not a position you like to be in, and if you are you'll soon be not OK because you'll become royally pissed off.  In Senior Drama Group, me and Scott are doing a double-act as Soldier 1 and Soldier 2 ^O^. We do it really well, too. Well, I suppose that's because we're brilliant ^O^.  Anyway, I can't think of anything else other than Scott liking the blog. Heh, I'll see if I can win some awards.  Love, Jon Roskilly

       Alright, back from school.  I DID find out this morning... that Caroline isn't on MSN. If she doesn't have an email adress then I'll either have to do it in letter form or get her phone number. Brilliant, isn't it? Ah well, quite proud that I found out otherwise. I did go through Alice to do it but when she's sitting on the outside...  It's nice to see Sam's blog returning to some state of usual-ness. Normality is probably the word I'm looking for. Hooray. I smiled quite broadly after reading the bit about killing the Roskillys, I like the fact there's some kind of normality coming back to life.  Despite not wanting to cast any darkness on Sam's blog (which I have become excessively pleased about), I have to comment on her remark about funerals, namely; "Why, when someone dies do I have the urge to laugh at everyone's belief that by giving them a funeral it will help them go to heaven?" I do not mean to criticise her finding this strange, given her new-found atheism. Call it a revelation if you will. Myself, I have never seen funerals as a way to help someone get to heaven, I always see that as slightly far-fetched and shallow. Personally, I believe that funerals are the last great act that people close to the deceased can give to the person pushing up the daisies. The final present, if you will. For me, it is not a bargaining system with God, more a tribute to the life of the person who died. Even if you're a complete dipshit, you must have done something good for someone during your life. This is remembered at your funeral.  On that topic, Mr. Kellie has allowed me to go to John's funeral on Thursday. I'm pleased about that, I really need to go. What is it about funerals and people thinking they need to go on an emotional basis? I don't know. But I do.  Anyway, I'll blog later probably.  Love, Jon Roskilly

       "WWIII is coming and only me and Scott seem to realise this/care." I'm sorry, but HOW LONG have I been saying this for? For crying out loud.  Jasmin (sp?) and Isabell (sp?) came over for Gwen's sleepover last night. I spent the majority of the time playing with Jasmin's hair. It's cool. She looks REALLY GOOD without her glasses on. I decided not to watch her sleeping, I think that would have made me a very disturbing kind of person. Isabell is scary and lesbian-straight, like Sam. But she's good looking too. How comes Gwen never has any bad-looking friends?  Anyway, knackered. I slept downstairs with the girls because they were being nicer than usual so I slept on the sofa. If you know what my sofa's like (Marx, you should, you've broken it a couple of times) then you'll know that's really uncomfortable. My back is killing me.  I just had a shower, I slept in yesterday's clothes. >_  I think I'll marry Jasmin's hair.  I'm set on asking Caroline if she's on MSN tomorrow. Doesn't that sound all planned? Still, I think it might be an idea.  Jasmin got annoyed at me playing with her hair and won't let me do it anymore. Waaah i_i.  Love, Jon Roskilly

       I find it difficult to talk to Sam now. Oh well, natural I think.  Talked to my Dad about the Caroline situation O_O'. That was weird.  Getting pissed off about Marcus' blogs being like this; "I have a tube. It's a stupid, insignificant tube and I hate it. I hate life. I don't have anything to do. It's so depressing." It's not like he's one of the luckiest people IN THE WORLD, no.  Love, Jon Roskilly

       Oh, and Danni/ie/y Miller, if you're reading this, thanks for your kind words about my blog. Apparently. Gwen said you liked it... I expect that means you just read it and told her you read it, and she interpreted it to mean that you like it but still, nice to know my blog reaches people I know little about.

       I'm sitting here watching the wheels go round...  Doubtless Sam'll be the only person to read this but anyhow I'm going to say that she was very civil today in talking to me so well done her ^_^. Seriously, it's nice when people don't tell you to die. She did subtly say "goodbye" but I'd been intending to go away and stop being a prick so she was quite right to.  I have a depressingly small amount of lines in Pirates.... but who cares about that to be quite frank?  Anyway, if I don't ask Caroline if she's on MSN tomorrow I'll have failed to since very soon after we came back to school... God, I'm sad. Seriously. I don't know, it doesn't even say ANYTHING other than I'd like to talk to her. For crying out loud.  I'm actually really bored, too...  Love, Jon Roskilly

       Hiya! I'm just blogging quickly because otherwise Gwen'll kill me   I've got to go to GYWO so I'll make this brief.  >>Saw Sam get off the bus today, she was talking to Amy and some other woman whom I don't know. >>Still haven't been able to bring myself to ask Caroline if she's on MSN. For Christ's sake, what's the worst that could happen? Seriously... the worst that could happen is that she could say no and then that's not all that bad. >>Done my homework O_O' and scarier still I've done some serious trombone practice O_O'. I'm becoming... dare I say it... organised?  Love, Jon Roskilly

       What's wrong with tree-huggers? Personally I'd be a tree hugger, providing I wouldn't have to move ^O^ I'm such a hypocrite, isn't it great? ^_^  I sang a song about Fidel Castro at Marx today, methinks he were a bit... feeling I was immature. Oh well, immaturity is fun.  I'm really hungry though... I'll make some noodles in a bit.  Current mood: Feeling quite high, actually.  Love, Jon Roskilly

       Hiya. Haven't blogged since Saturday because... well, Sam's taught me that if I can't blog anything nice that I shouldn't blog at all. So I haven't blogged. I'm still not going to say anything. See you.  Love, Jon Roskilly

       Right, I'm in town with Adam, a few comments: >> Raced Zoe into town, she was in a car but because of the traffic, from only a short way into in my journey and I won. Yay. Admitedly I sprinted the very last bit but I still won, so nyah. Who says walking doesn't pay off? Meh, it's because of Cheltenham vs. Cambridge today. GO CHELTENHAM! >> Saw Sam on her way out of town, was tastefully ignored... she was with Tobin (or Toby I'm not sure), the guitarist for the band founded by Tom. I felt it would have been indecent to ask him what piece he'd prepared. Sam would've killed me. But they were having a debate, so go them. >> Saw a large group of people, including Dave Slaughter, Nick, Mellon and Harry, walking past Virgin. Go them. >> Bought a pair of 'Gentleman's combs'. I've been meaning to get one for a while and opportunity knocked... so go it. >> Noticed that this computer has a webcam. Woo. Go Information Center @ Beechwood Arcade. >> Wondering whether Sam's heard the news. If she hasn't... it'll be a shock tomorrow, put it like that.  John, we'll miss you.

       Marcus has this odd thing. Every woman seems to find him attractive but he then goes on and says he's fat, ugly, etc. It's like... not anti-smug, more... inflammatory.  But still... knackered. Off to CAYO tomorrow, seeing if I can go to this pirate thing with Zoe because I'll be bored, other than that... life is dull, perhaps, who knows?

       John Yarnley, my musical mentor and choirmaster for around 10 years, passed away during last night. Had he survived he would have had serious brain damage... it was better this way. Still, every time I sing I'll think of him. I would not be where I was today without him. I need to say a few words at his funeral, I think.  God rest his soul.

       Anyway... Made a decision, la monde. I'm going to leave Sam alone totally. I should have done ages ago but it's a die-cast decision this time. Unless she starts conversations or makes an effort to talk to me I'll take it as read that she hates me. I think that's the best idea. The reason I was talking to her was to try and make things less difficult but now she hates me it's making things easier if I don't so I won't Simple, non?  Love, Jon Roskilly

       Hoorah. I'm now posted on Sam's dislikes list TWICE. That's because I'm a twat, but still, waaa. Never mind, hey. Life goes on whether she hates me or not. Sure, I don't like it, but there are lot of things I don't like that I'm going to have to live with so I might as well start trying now.  *sighs* Life is hard, if you'd never noticed.

       Blogging around in the dark with a maniac...  I'm here, waiting for my trombone lesson, sitting in the computer room... I'll go back soon and start warming up the trombone, but for the minute I'm fiddling with my blog. So hoorah.  I burned my hand a bit, the hot water tap was... well... hot. Seems logical enough but as a general rule hot water taps either don't work or run cold water. So I burned my hand. Hoorah.  Anyway, Swedish. Swedish? Franzosich, my good man. NORRRRRRRRRRRRRM. Toyota? Toyota Corolla. Avensis Corolla Psiren. Psiren, siren, noise, light, let there be light, church, building, rock, earth, wind, fire, water. Water daughter. Excalibur. Sword, death, life.

       Right... Sam has expressed her hatred of me. A number of times. To be honest I don't find it possible to blame her, I'd hate me. No, I DO hate me. So whoop-dee-doo to the world.  I'm sorry, everyone. I don't mean to be a narcisisstic tit all of the time, it's just so hard to break out of the human condition. I'm not saying "Oh, I don't care, it's just human" because I don't want to be normal and human. We're all more than the sum of our parts. I like to think I am too. It's hard to be me though, any more, to be honest. *sighs* Ah well, life does go on. Why, I'm not sure, but it does, regardless. Carry on regardless, who sung that? Paul Simon? I don't know.  Anyway... tired after Evesham, stupid bush ripped my hand... bush... yeah... but it hurt, anyway. It was a good blow-through though. I didn't get to go on trombone but I played at the best of my ability on the baritone. I even managed to remember all 4 sharps in Love Changes Everything and I kept count during the theme tune for The Trap.  OH, and I really want to hear a recording of Leoncavallo's Pagliacci. It's an opera about a clown, or something like that, it's just what I've heard sounds cool. Winchcombe have a brass band arrangement of what in English is called On With the Motley, I can't remember the Italian for it. Although it MIGHT make sense to ask Scott I think it would be asking a bit much to expect him to know the word for MOTLEY after not learning it for long.  General remarks from Sam about my blog being mean... general 'catty remarks' as she put it. Amy (Boris/Brissa) is actually talking to me a bit, she's generally being quite cool and not overly-hyper, which is unusual. So... hoorah.  "I was dreaming of the past, and my heart was beating fast, I began to lose control, I began to lose control. I didn't mean to hurt you. I didn't want to make you cry. I didn't want to hurt you. I'm just a jealous guy."  Love, Jon Roskilly

       Today, I have been mostly updating the  Gloucestershire fanlisting  and putting it forward to get listed on  TheFanlistings.org . I have also made a banner for one of the possible new names for And-then.org - ShipmanClinics.com.  Anyway, sitting here with my guitar, I've got to go to Evesham later with Winchcombe Concert Brass. I'll take my trombone along, I'm not sure they'll have a full compliment of them. They'll probably want me on baritone ANYWAY but there's no harm in trying, right? I like my trombone.  I got my CAYO hoodie yesterday. It has "mm089" written on the back as my name ^-^. It looks pretty good. I might ask the woman who arranged for them to be made where she got them done (probably JJ's), because they'd be cool as a kind of "goodbye, And-then" thing, wouldn't they? I think so.  I'll stop trying to think of things to say now.  Love, Jon Roskilly

       Toyota, toyota, lalala, Toyota.  Reading peoples' blogs is fun when you want to become really depressed, isn't it? WOOOOOOO FOR DEPRESSION. Hoorah. In fact, when I'm depressed, I'm so happy that I just want to dance, and sing!  Time to stop being me. No, it's long past that time now. That time passed over 5 years ago.

       Alright, I was an unreasonable bastard. I'm sorry. Not that anyone will accept the apology, I've probably just self-destructed my life, but I'm sorry. I...  I'm absolutely terrified of myself, how I'm going to turn out. I have massive angry stages like that, one of which I broke my foot in, the other I scared my entire family. My dad almost killed me with one of his fits. I don't... I don't want to turn into him. I want to not worry that any time someone makes me angry that I might actually KILL them. And I mean literally strangle/stab them. Seriously.  I should delete that post, but I'm not going to. Why? I'm not sure. It's a part of my life now, and however much it may seem so, rubbing it off isn't going to help matters. The words will still stick, the pain will stay... this is MY LIFE. Screwed, isn't it?  And by the way Patrick, this isn't something to be proud of. This was me going psycho and you shouldn't say that I managed to do what you couldn't because that's not the point. The point is you managed to not go mental and start having anger problems.  I'm sorry, Sam, and I'm really sorry to Marcus. I didn... no. I did mean what I said. I don't now, but at the time I meant every last word. But I'm... really sorry. This is one of those times where existing seems a bad idea.  Love, Jon Roskilly

       Now, hear ye this all those who think they know better than me. Who think they are somehow above me.  FUCK EVERYTHING. I want to KILL THEM. I want to grind them into the floor and stamp on them. I want to put them into a room and torture them. Slowly. Oh yes, they'd both say "But I'd like that" but they wouldn't. They're both just attention seeking SHITS and I hope they're happy together. Actually, no I don't. I hope they crash and burn. I hope they hurt as much as I am.  But no, I'm not allowed to say this, because somehow I can't speak my emotions or "I'm hurting" her and so she'll avoid me and everybody say 'awwwwww'. FUCKING HELL. I want the same rules as anyone else. Put her in my position, she'd be making my life hell. She thinks me feeling like this is a problem for her? TRY BEING ME, BITCH.  Oh, and I'm hard to take advantage of, yes. No-one ever takes advantage of me, oh no. My older sister doesn't at all demand I get off exactly when I say I was going to but be completely off the wall when I ask her to get off because she said she would. Not at all. And I don't sit here every night trying to think of SOMETHING ELSE OTHER THAN HER because otherwise I'm making things difficult. No.  FUCK THIS. There's only so far you can take someone. You can't fuck with me as much as you may want to. If she doesn't read this, good for her. It'll mean she 'won't have to avoid me'. She can go back to her BASTARD and they can have a nice friendly FUCKING BRILLIANT TIME. She can wank him off all she wants. Just if she kills me first.  Jon Roskilly

       My arse hurts from sitting on this chair for too long.  I got Buzz a birthday card with some of the money I got for my paper round, £5 is going towards Suz's present and the quid or so I had left is mine, all mine. I spent some on getting a small Galaxy bar (and mum gave me £1 to get a coke on condition I gave her a pound's worth of coppers ^-^) so I now have 90p, which is enough to get a bottle of Cherry Coke from school tomorrow.  And... I apologise for being a complete tit.  Love, Jon Roskilly

       I'm going to blog again. Fuck the fact no-one's going to read it, Sam's not going to know about it, fuck everything (not literally) I want to let the soul of the internet know how I'm feeling. For Christ's sake. All I want is to get it out.  Somehow I miss her like FUCK ALL ELSE. Part of the feeling I believe will be drowned tomorrow, to come back one time in the near future. I love her. Screw everything. Get that out and I can live for another damned night. Why is it so arsing hard to accept this...

       Alright, Sam has asked me to blog, so I'm going to (just for her).  Today, we had the 2nd day of STRS, and it were... it was alright, yeah. Generally took a long time and wasn't very interested but still...  After school, my head started hurting like hell so I decided to leave my paper round until tomorrow morning. Instead I went for a walk, and on the question of Samantha we went on a walk to my usual place by the stream. We spent a while there, and explored a bit and I got a wet arse >_  I got a nice new trackball mouse, and when you touch the ball (O_o) it glows blue. Hoorah. I like trackball mice, they're fun.  Anyway, watching Eyes Down. See ya.  Love, Jon Roskilly

       OK, Sam's demanding me to blog. BLOG, JON! BLOG NOW!  There will be no blogging for aroundabout a week, as first half is spent in Belgium and second half is spent... doing other things so I'm busy. Sorry to all my devoted readers... well, Sam and Miller.  Miller hasn't blogged in a while *waits*  Sam told me in so many words to grow some balls and ask Caroline out. Some people can be really charming, can't they? Bloody hell...  Scott wasn't in because... well, he's ill, the poor lad. Everybody say aw. *hugs Scott*  I shouted at Caroline yesterday, but I won't go into it in detail because I'm knackered so I'll just say that she didn't mind ^_^.  I wonder who Zoe's got her eye on... Ooh, on the subject of Zoe, if you're reading... INVITE ME TO WEIRD HALLOWEEN DO! It's such an odd thing to say!  Went for a walk with Sam earlier. Twas good fun, got to say g'bye to Cheltenham for a bit.

       OK, sitting in das Komputerzimmer.  Firstly, I am INCENSED at Digby's comment regarding me that has appeared on Patrick's blog. Seriously. Grr...  Secondly, slightly confused by Miller's remark on her blog regarding the asking her out thing I did on Monday. Miller, I would if I could, but that doesn't mean I can. You won't have the chance to be shocked. Sorry!  Thirdly, Patrick, your asking out thing will not match the splendour of what is mine, what is original. I feel mine is one of the greatest creations of all time. And I'm completely modest about it. Yes. Definitely.  Fourthly, I get worried about these tablets. I really feel they're going to do something awful to me.  Fifthly... I'll post a poetic quote later.  Love, Jon Roskilly

       I'm off school today, because of the stomach-killing side-effects of my silly Amoxiclav tablets >_ _  I don't believe that Miller understands the sincerity with which I read her blog, and I would presume a few others do too. She writes how she feels without making it boring. Good looking blonde girl, I bow to your use of English.  OK, purely for comedy value, I've been wondering what certain peoples' reactions would be, were I to ask them out. I list them here, however I must again point out that it is purely for comic value:   1 - Caroline  As hard as I try, I can't figure out what she'd say. I believe it would run along the lines of saying "Uh" and not talking to me and the situation generally being awkward.   2 - Sally Grant  Same situation as with Caroline, although the "Uh" would more likely be a flat "no".   3 - Jasmin  I'm sure she'd be perfectly polite and sensitive, and suitably disguise the fact she was, in effect, saying "not if you were the last man alive".   4 - Miller  Not sure. I think she'd blink and either kick me, laugh at me, or walk off in shock.   5 - Iggy  She would certainly pull my ear off. And then she'd probably IGGnore me.   6 - Zoe  Well, we all know the answer, this one's already been road-tested. Heheh.   7 - Rhiannon  Difficult to tell how she'd say no. There are so many reasons, she'd only have to pick one.   8 - Sam  I think it would run along the lines of "I'm not single, you twat" and a kick to the groin. I doubt I've underestimated her subtlety there.   9 - That weird clarinet woman at CAYO  I'm not 100% whether she likes me. If she likes me, she'd laugh and say no. If not, the kick to the groin would again apply.   10 - Patrick  Heh, that'd just be hilarious. I'm not sure what he'd say but it'd be funny. ^_^. I wouldn't risk it on the grounds that he might even say yes. (joking)   11 - Rachel Bromelow  Sorry, Zoe, she's just someone I know! No idea what she'd say to the effect of "no".   12 - Rachel who is playing Mabel in Pirates of Penzance  No idea again, but she'd probably be a cross between sensitive and violent in her refusal.   13 - Alice (Caroline's friend)  Heh, it would probably run along these lines: "Hey, will you go out with me?" {No.} "Sure enough."   14 - That weird woman who looks at me on the bus but is not small  No idea. She'd laugh at some point of it though.   15 + 16 - Either of the small girls who talk to me sometimes  Hilarity. I expect they'd faint, then wake up and say "no".   17 - Saz  Saz would probably just block me.   18 - Terri  I expect she'd just look cute in a way that meant "not on your life, mate".   19 - Naomi/Nigel/Paul  She'd... God knows.   20 - Lisa (ie. Zoe's friend)  That'd be weird. She'd talk to me even less than usual.   21 - Mel  That'd be another kick to the groin.   22 - Pete  That'd be great fun. Would he say "alright, I s'pose"? We'll never know. Thank God.   23 - Seb  He'd fall off his chair. That's all he'd do. He might go into a coma after that though.   24 - One of the girls in STRS choir  Wait, there aren't any.   25 - Scott  We'd live happily ever after in a cottage made out of... no, wait, he'd just laugh, I'd laugh, and we'd both die laughing. How cool would that be?   26 - Buzzy  He'd prod me in a negative way.   27 - Cerrie (sp?)  Uh, I don't know what she'd do. She hits me really hard when she likes me. If I did that she'd probably throw me out the window.   28 - Amy  I think she'd look quizzical and walk off.   29 - Jo (Sophie's friend)  She'd be very shocked. And then say no.   30 - Sophie  No idea. Haven't talked to her for at least a year.  OK, so how sad is that? I've been through 30 people.  Quote of the day: "Hail to thee, blithe spirit!

       Morning... well, afternoon.  As has been the general trend in... well, everyone, I haven't blogged for a while. Since Wednesday, in fact O_O. I haven't had time, and I've got to go out in a couple of hours and go sit in Gloucester because I don't want to get stuck on the late bus. It's the last night of the double for this show. Still, getting money, w00t. Does anyone still use that?  People have been invading my dreams, namely Sam, Rhiannon, Zoe, Sally Grant and Caroline. There's no order in that, I just thought I'd mention it.  I've still got to do this bloody English coursework.  Oh, that poem I wrote, 'Freedom?' is going to have to be retitled so I can send it to a competition held by the UCE. I'm thinking 'Equality?' so that I can keep the rhetoric in the title.  I'm looking ugly again. Nice to get back to reality, there.  I've been feeling really small over the past few days. Small as in childish, small as in insignificant... I don't like feeling small.  That feeling of getting left out is coming back to haunt me, too. I really want to get drunk and grope someone I don't know very well. Or be sober and grope someone I don't know very well. Either way is good.  Quote of the day: ""Beware the jabberwock, my son! The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! Beware the jubib bird, and shun The frumious Bandersnatch!""

       Oh, and also, I feel kind of horny, basically because I can legally fuck so I kind of feel like taking advantage of it. Never mind though, God knows I won't. If he doesn't then I will, he's all omniscient but still, I think he knows. I ask him but he doesn't really tell me either way. Which is fine, if he did I think I'd be a little distraught about knowing my future.

       Hiya, I'm just posting before I clock off and sleep.  Is it so wrong of me that a couple of minutes ago I looked at myself in the mirror and actually thought that I looked good? Is that such a bad thing? I don't know. I know I'm misconcieved and everything but I really think, at this present moment, that I'm looking GOOD. Tomorrow I'll look ugly again. I looked ugly earlier. Just right now, I think I'm fairly attractive. Prove me wrong.  Read everyone's blogs. My Dad is scaring me in the way that he seems to take the fact that I'm busy as a personal insult. If he gave a damn he'd know that the reason I'm busy is because I LOVE being a trombonist. I totally adore being a bloke so many groups depend on. I'm an attention-seeker. And I'm bloody proud of it.  Drawing ever-closer to the CAYO tour. YAY, BELGIUM!  Love, Jon Roskilly

       So here we are, the eve of my birthday.  My presents are: A camera (K-1000), from Mum; A cool Strong Bad T-shirt from Suz; A groovy Beatles: Revolver Sessions poster from Gwen; £10 from Dad and Denise + Dave, $5 from Auntie Chris and Uncle Frank. Thankees very much!  All in all the day has boded well. Mrs. Carden (?) at Showstoppers agreed to do Sunset Boulevard, so I'll have a solo ^_^. It's great song, as Rhiannon will testify.  Miller is apparently NOT obsessed with me. Fair enough then, I say. Although it's nice to have a good-looking blonde girl obsessed with you I'll accept that she isn't so I won't dwell on it.  Mr. S says that my poem, Freedom?, should go into some poetry competition I know nothing about. But nevertheless, it's an idea. If I can win some money by it, more power to myself, surely.

       My head is splitting, but despite this, my day so far has been altogether alright.  Went into town aprés l'école with my new-found fortune of £7 and purchased... a glasses case, a bottle of pepsi, a chocolate muffin, The Phantom of The Opera by Gaston Leroux and a book called "100 Favourite Poems" or something. Uber-joy.  Day  before tomorrow. What's tomorrow, you ask? My 16th birthday. Tomorrow I can legally go and screw someone. I can also legally get pissed. Wheeeeeeeeeeeeee!  I get the feeling Sally Grant is going to be to me as Clarriwas... don't ask.  Anyway, apparently Miller is obsessed with me. Albeit my blog. Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.

       I'm Jon. Hooray!  Anyway, I can't really think right now. I think I may continue in my pursuit of Caroline given that she looked at me in an accidentally sexy way tonight. At any rate, it was accidentaly provocative.  (Poetic) Quote of the day; "The cold dark prison cell awakes, Another dream the darkness takes. A hunger, unceasing, takes those here In the name of freedom, ringing clear. Abused, destroyed, no solace left, Yet continuing far, though pain and death Seem likely ends to what is now The only hope for mankind. How Beautiful the pain of those Whose blood runs like a scarlet rose For half the people in the world? What pain, what beauty undeserved. Another day, another life, A struggle against the deadly knife. The surgeons of this living hell Seem not to know their wives as well Will fight to see that days will dawn When women rise and see the morn Where they will ten be free. The women rise up, on one knee, They spy the wardens walking round, Their hollow footsteps on the ground. The tubes, once more, to try to cease A hunger, once again. For peace."

       "i was mentioned on jons blog" - Excerpt from Miller's blog. You'd think it was like the Eurovision Song Contest or something. Never mind, it's nice to know it's appreciated.  Miller emailed me about my remark about blondes. I don't mean it in that way. But you know, those people who look really plastic, you know... people like Vicky who are normal blonde but don't go round in an inch of makeup are cool. I suppose I didn't clarify it, so here I go; as long as you're not totally obsessed with how you look, you're fine. Even if you are and have a sense of humour you're OK.  Anyway... Gwen's poking me in the forehead. The tit. Go away. Right, that did it.  Thanks Miller, you're in my head now. Gr.  Cerrie or however it's spelt had a slapping contest with my arm. My arm lost on account of it not having a hand to hit back with. My arm is going to be so red in the morning, she's fairly vicious.  Anyway, I'm going to stop after today's poetic quote;  "I heard a thousand blended notes, While in a grove I sat reclined, In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts Bring sad thoughts to the mind."

       You know, I could never see myself with a full blonde. You know, someone with just THAT colour hair. I mean, yes, I find a lot of blonde people attractive but it wouldn't work, me with a full/peroxide blonde. I'm not a great fan of plastic people. I never even liked Playmobil.  Emailed Sam randomly last night (before you start thinking I've done it again, it was entirely amicable, and in saying that I reassure Marcus, Sam (if she hasn't checked her email) and Patrick that although it was amicable it wasn't TOO amicable, if you get my drift). She's probably the most likely to reply. Well, maybe Marx, but he's having email problems.  Got to go to this Pirates rehearsal in about an hour and a half... *waits*  Anyway, I'll repost later.

       It's 11 PM, so I suppose it'd be 'Night!  Just been having an interesting conversation with Patrick, I won't say what about but to be totally honest I believe it to be a little guessable.  You might not have guessed, but I am actually in quite a bad mood with life and generally pissed off with about 4 people. Never mind who but it happens occassionally and I've developed a few restraint techniques. One is called the "delete" key. Another is called the "backspace" key.  Very good rehearsal for "Not Just a Number" today. I'm still not too keen on the name but it's a good band. We did With or Without You, Paranoid and A Kind Of Magic and a mock-photo-shoot at the end. 'Twas fun. Also, Tobin has now successfully added me on MSN.  Oh, something that may interest my readers that are apparently a little wider than I had previously reckoned; Miller (Dani?) is at GYWO, the Wind Orchestra I frequent on Thursday evenings. She's playing Piccolo or flute or something. She's still good looking. And there's also a clarinetist that I thought was Jasmin. The mind plays tricks.  Well and truly given up on Caroline. The strange thing is that now I have she seems more attractive than ever. Damn it.

       Evening!  I'm actually really scared to be honest. All day I have yearned for pain. I don't mean dropping my bag on my foot, I found that out after I did drop my bag on my foot, but I mean like the constant pain you get from... well... when I had the skiing accident.

       Right, I am 100% cream-crackered today (and you didn't think I could get any sadder).  Got an A for my speech in English, I was dead set on an A* so that was a bit of a let down, but nevertheless it was a good result.  Marcus and Sam seem to be on the rocks again, doubtless they'll be fine by tomorrow or something. It always depresses me when they start not working. Whereas Suz is unquestionably dancing around my room saying that they're falling apart. God bless her.  I'm starting to realise that it wasn't exactly that I fancy Caroline that I want(ed) to ask her out. I just have a massive urge to be with someone, you know, hold them to you every time you see them. I don't like being single >_  Love, Jon Roskilly

       Hiya.  I'm fairly cold, I just took 9 photos of the church. And guess what? It took me an hour. 1 HOUR to take 9 photos. Still, they're quite good, and I was quite proud of my ingenuity in some of them (in an attempt that didn't pay off, I stood inside a bush). I'm going to try to get the last 3 on this film of the choir.  Sam's alive and is ignoring me again ^_^. Better than nothing, hey?  Anyway, I'm more tired than usual -_-.

       Right, Sunday afternoon. Just. Well, 20 to 2.  Didn't get up for Church this morning. Instead, I lay in my bed until 12:20. I feel a bit guilty and a bit that I've undermined my position. I'm not sure why but for some reason I'm worried about Sam. I just want confirmation that she still exists, that's all. Grr, it's all because of the weather on Friday, that being that it was really foreboding and incredibly dark, but it didn't rain at all and there was only light wind. I deliberately went to choir, got there 15 minutes late, to find Sam wasn't there. That sparked this. Hooray.  Oh, and on the subject of the choir, I'm making a choir website. Hooray! It should be up soon enough, I hope. I'm using different shades of blue, given that blue is the colour associated with Mary. I'm finding it difficult to locate any internet pics of St. Mary's though, I'll probably have to take them myself.  OH! And I may have posted this already but mum got the K-1000 fixed (a very valuable kind of camera) and I've been using it to try and see what the filters do. I'm just running this coloured film and then I'm going to put a black and white one in and take some pictures (probably of Zoe, she said she would so I'll hold her to it ^_^) so hooray! I'll take a few pictures of the church in a bit.  The traces of the Evesham bush have all but vanished from my hand. Hoorah!  When it's finished, the choir subdomain will be  here .

       Terri's being really cute ^_^.  Spent the afternoon at Tom's, had a chinese at his house a bit earlier, it was really good. We did some practice for the band, and I was dropped home by Tobin. Hooray!  Love, Jon Roskilly

       Read some of Ryan's blog, and although it's wonderful to find someone as long-winded as I am it is truly confusing to find someone as bad at it as I am. Him and I seem to be the only people in the world with a massive vocabulary and no ability to use said vocabulary. Hooray! Someone as annoying as me!  Anyway, lemmings.

       My speech in English was applauded and I think the general belief was that it was good. Yay.  Sam's blog is pas worky. Squeh, that reduces what I can do online.  Marx seems to be better now, I expect he can get an extension on the Tech to be honest, especially seeing as though he's with Mr. Peffers I think...  Generally a bit happier now but I still feel a bit shaky every time I sing.  Love, Jon Roskilly

       In light of today's events, this blog in particular will not exactly be tremendously comic.  The morning built to the crescendo of the pounding in my ears as I signed out, to go home, put on my black tie and walk to St. Mary's, the most important single building in my life. To pay respect to the closest man to me. The church was packed, full of people who had never come to St. Mary's, full of people who loved John in their own way. I silently stepped up the aisle, taking my place with the rest of the choir. In particular on my side were John Blackwell, who has been in the choir for about 40 years or something; Timothy Brain, Gloucestershire Chief Constable and choir-member for a couple of years; Richard Brain, a stocky sort of fellow who has been with the choir for about 4 years; Someone who I'm not sure of but I recognise from as far back as 7 years ago; and, most importantly, Matthew Kingston, who knew St. Mary's for as long as John had. Holding back tears, I sang with Richard the hymn, but was unable to stop the steady flow of fluid during the psalm. The only person who seemed to be similarly afflicted was Tamsyn, who has been an uncommited choir member for around 4 years. The choir was right to question the use of Lead Kindly Light, as no-one knew it and it destroyed what was a very emotional build-up. During the last hymn, however, I felt the cool slide of the tears against my cheek, singing the unison at full volume. Processing out with the rest of the choir, we struggled in our attempt not to break down and cry right there. Outside, we formed a guard of honour, watching the coffin of such a great man pass us by. It was only then I realised that Matthew Kingston had cried as much as I.  In the vestry, words were slow, calm, painful to make. Sam turned to face me, and although I had meant to say something comforting about Marcus (she had been troubled by his abscence from school) I got out as fast as I could. I wept long and hard as I trudged home, only comparable to times in the past. Times long gone, while I was a treble. Richard put it well when he said that there were "all the generations of Mr. Yarnley's choirmastery" present.  Love, Jon Roskilly

       I am knackered and so I apologise for this being slightly less jolly than what it has recently been.  I feel... very lonely right now. I... oh, who cares, let's be happy.  Showstoppers is doing an American-type theme for their next show. Squeh, God knows what we'll be doing. Well, we'll be doing Razzle Dazzle and America, and some other things.  The approaching money-earning gig is... well... approaching. I'll be getting between £50 and £60 for it. But who really cares? O_O'  Have you ever noticed the lack of respect you get for being a completely commited musician?  Love, Jon Roskilly

       Anti-Racism chain mail trying to get 250 sigs... 211. Digby, England. homophobes are nasty too... 212. Jon, England - I'm a free speech fanatic and I make no bones in saying that I believe the right of this person to exercise his freedoms is justified. However, I am fully against prejudice of any sort. It must be made clear, at this point, however, that if this person has been brought up and has this prejudice it is not possible to condemn him for saying what he believes. It is only possible to condemn his upbringing and beliefs to date. My message is this: we must, instead of aiming at those who fight race through words and acts, aim at those who persuade the young that those different to us are 'wrong'. In this way, we will filter out racism at a greater rate than what we are doing at the moment. I must point out that no-one seems to have made the point that millions are dying in the world as we send this email amongst ourselves. What is a greater problem? Some poorly-raised individual who wants to share his views, or the fact that millions across the world live in poverty and death? That in some countries, this man would be killed for saying what he believes, if it goes against the system? Believe me, I consider racism to be a problem. But we must accept the fact that there are bigger problems that no-one seems to give a damn about.  And here we are, the last night of Pirates is finished, dead, gone. Sally didn't let me hug her... waaaah.. Rachel did though, she was happy when I did ^^. She's cool. But Sally is also cool.... Waaah.  Rhiannon couldn't come. Shame, but not life-threatening, I'll see her at some point.  All of our cool sixth formers (apart from Rachel and some other ones ^^) are leaving at the end of this year... damn. Alastair Stanley, Sally, Stefan, 'The cool short blonde one', and many more wonderous individuals. Who can forget Sam Taunton... He was in a coma 6 months ago and the whole school prayed (not literally prayed) that he'd be back with us in September. And he was. We love him dearly.  OOOH the woman who played my mother in Book of The Banshee came to see us! We ought to wring her filthy little neck but she's so good looking and has wonderful copper hair... *_*  Can't think of anything else to write other than... waaaah it's all gone!

       How many times can a man drink blood before he becomes a vampire?  Sorry I didn't post yesterday, I didn't actually get on the net at all. I got back late and then couldn't be bothered. Fair enough, ye all say. Never mind.  I got a new jumper in town today... oh, speaking of town, I bumped into Lisa yesterday, but she wasn't sure it was me. Why? I forgot what the word was for "hello". I got a bit stuck as a result. Silly me -_-. Lisa's one of these people that I think if I knew better, we'd be very good friends. Maybe not. I don't honestly know, but it's nice to say, isn't it? Yeah ^^.  The 3-night run of Pirates of Penzance begins tomorrow.... eee. And on Thursday I've got the audition for the award scheme... eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. S-h-i-t. Jon's nervy. M'aider!  Hm, methinks Sally is slowly cottoning on to the fact that I like her in that way... mee, if anything she's talking to me more. She just seems awkward. Rachel actually seems to be afraid of me, in that really cute way when they respect you but don't particularly want to talk to you. ^^. They're both great singers. And they're nice. Ruth isn't such a great singer but she's still quite friendly. Albeit intensely odd.  I've got to do assorted courseworks... lame.  I'm also tired.  Still missing Zoe and Rhiannon, waah.

       "Jon, why do you ignore Sam so much?" "Because I'm afraid of her."  I officially SUCK at bowling. Even the little girl who can't be older than 10 beat me. Oh, the pain, the pain of it all! I'm not too sucky at that dancing game though... hm, apart from the not fancying men bit (which may come in a while, I'm becoming depressingly asexual at the moment) I almost totally qualify for Jonathon's gay club. *needs to stop putting his head on Scott's shoulder and generally being fairly cuddly*  Sam scared me intensely. She didn't once speak to me, she only looked at me a couple of times, and she was fine as a person. But the fact she was there terrified me. I don't know, is that so odd? I can't imagine that being terrified by your ex-girlfriend that cheated on both you and your friend with the same bloke is such an abnormal thing...  I feel very guilty today. I accidentally made Mum buy me; >> A plunger mute; >> A straight mute; >>A small bottle of Slide-O-Mix And it came to almost £40. We don't have the money to do things like that, but it wasn't my fault, it really was accidental. Waaaaah. *guilt*  Hm, I want Zoe or Rhiannon... no, not in that way, I just want them here. I miss both of them, they're both so cool and so much of a comfort. *plays with fingers* Rhiannon's leaving at the end of the year, probably. She'll be off to Bangor. Then I won't be able to talk to her very often. Not that I do now but at least if I feel much like it I can wander round with the assumed motive of borrowing something and have like an hour long conversation with her ^^. ...I don't see her very often. And Zoe... the contact I have with Zoe is when we go for walks, and the halloween party, in which I believe I got on with everyone fairly well. Waah.  Saw Miller tonight, too. She didn't actually talk to me at all. I think I shouldn't have posted the last post *guilt*. Sorry, Danni, I didn't mean it like that, I was just upset... sorry. *hugs*  I'm feeling quite ill, and I've got the dress rehearsal for Pirates tomorrow... shit.

       Miller, I have to give you a word of advice while I am angry and depressed; don't laugh while telling me Sam cheated on me. I know anyway, it's very upsetting to be reminded at all, much worse when you laugh at me because of it. I'm really quite upset about it, seriously. I know you didn't mean to upset (or if you did I'd be fairly shocked), and you're really nice and friendly, but please be a bit more sensitive about... well, anything to do with Sam. I'm sorry, I don't mean to be angry, but...  OK, you may have guessed but Miller's not on the top of my "list" at the moment. Je crois that it's Rachel Foxhill at the moment, partly because she seems to like me in that annoyingly not-fancying way but in the way that she's still a little shy around me but tries to talk to me ^^. She's cool.  I started writing a song today, for the band. Woo!  Oh, and also, I may become the singer in a metal band at school with Buzz... Heaven knows, and I don't.  Mum has been am-az-in-gly cool and granted me permission to use some of the money she put into my account, as savings, to buy a white fedora... how cool! I found one in Cribbs Causeway Topman, and I think there's a Topman in Cheltenham... *drools over hat* As Miller said, it's only a hat, but it's SUCH A COOL HAT. Scott's getting a Trillby, so I'm going to get the fedora. Seems only fair.  I am narked off.  I got my debit card through today, whoopee!  If 2 + 2 = 4, does 22 + 22 = 44? Short answer: Yes. Long answer: ...No, not at all, dumbass(!). I mean, what kind of idiot are you? Did you come up with the Gloucester schools review or something? Duh.

       Mel is intriguing, we shall leave it at that. She didn't say a word to me this week but she was fairly nattery last week. Only the Lord understands that woman.  We're not doing Sunset Boulevard... -_- I like that song... waaah. But I've nabbed the solo for Lady Luck and I'll probably be doing the Riff part in Tonight. We're counting on you to be there, toni-iiight...  My English coursework ended up being 1,695 long. I think I did a little too much.   I can't think of anything else to write, apart from the fact that ooooh I can play the trombone.

       Got the new Aled Jones album, higher. YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!  I'm still feeling really ill at the moment... during the Pirates rehearsal I had to bring a chair onto the stage, my excuse being that I could either have a chair or they could watch me faint.  Mrs. Briscowe is apparently very pissed about me not being able to attend the Senoir Drama group meeting. It's not that I can't understand why but I dislike it more than she does. Colwell have shot me in the foot.  A little bit hyper about the Mr. Jones album ^^.  I've still got to do my English coursework..... ahhhhhhhfeckit.

       What is love?  Anyway, I've not been at school today. I'm feeling VERY ill. Nonetheless I will go to CYB tonight, if only because Caroline may be there.  I apologise to Miller about the post yesterday, on another glance what I said could have been interpreted as an insult, and I meant no such harm.  I'm still feeling depressed though.  Unfortunately, unless what I think may have happened in that the GYWO concert was brought forward a week, it'll clash with the Last Laugh in that they'll both be on the 11th. Alas!  Jon's single, and not liking it.  Quote of the day: "My life flows on in endless song, Above Earth's lamentation. I hear the real, though far off, hymn That hails a new creation."

       I'm Jon.  I'm also tired.  In more than one way.  If it ever was so I have decided not to 'pursue' Miller. It would upset Gwen, plus I'd have no chance. There was a little bit of flirting last night but that's because I fancy her a lot. Well, there was a LOT of flirting last night. I would LIKE to go out with her, sure. But while Gwen maintains that she'd be upset if I made 'a move' and Miller maintains tha she doesn't fancy me I feel it would be fruitless, and I must therefore turn my efforts to a back up plan. Of which I have none.  Secondly, I've only just got back from a band rehearsal. It went alright.  A GYWO concert may clash with The Last Laugh, which would be awful.  I am completely knackered.  Great. Now I'm thinking about Miller AGAIN.  ...Gwen told me Danni and Sam were at Koinonia and they were both very huggy towards each other. In fact, the comparison she used is that it was like me and Sam used to be. I could have done without that. Jesus, I could have done without that. I also could have done without Danni being talked at last night about her exploits with Sam at the orchestra course. I could have fucking done without being told she went with other people too. I could have fucking done without it. I could... I could do without every waking moment being filled with the fact that I'm not only single, but my ex-girlfriend cheated on me, went out with one of my friends and then cheated on him. I could now do without the fact that the girl I most want to be with is untouchable under the morals I have about upsetting people. Fuck.  I feel very ill.  It seems strange to say it but I kind of want Zoe to walk in and give me a hug. I don't understand why but she's so bloody comforting to have near me. I suppose I've known her for too long. Not that that's a bad thing. I like her, that's obvious by the fact I want her near me.  I feel like the end is closer than I used to think.  Gr, I'm so fucking depressed tonight. I could do without living right now.  Quote of the day: "And you ask me why I love her Through wars, death and despair, She is the constant, we who don't care."

       Uh, right, given recent posts about people I fancy I think it necessary to PROVE the fact that I wouldn't fancy someone just for their looks. Somehow... Ooh, ooh, I don't fancy Sam. I also don't fancy Lisa in a proper way. Or... God, I feel dirty.  OK, points about people I fancy  (varying amounts) that aren't purely about them looking good: Miller: Clever, VERY good blog technique, really nice and friendly, good musician. Rosie: Really funny, good musician, accepts the fact that her blonde hair doesn't stop her from being able to appreciate blonde jokes. Lizzie: Such an amazingly nice person it hurts, will cope with you being really boring and actually LISTEN to what you're saying so she can not insult you at the end. Attractively reserved. Seems to have a good musical ear. Mel: Stunningly nice. Really good singer, not a bad songwriter, not afraid to tell me to fuck off. She tries to sing along when I play "I Don't Know How to Love Him" wrong on the piano. Zoe: I've known her for far too long. She's really nice, fairly trusting, easy to talk to, has a good musical sense without showing it around too much. Will hug you without any sort of pretense. Nice to go for walks with. Sally G: Really, really nice when she's not in a very bad mood, and even then she only seems mildly annoyed. Amazing flautist, astounding pianist, writes very atmospheric piano music (she played some in the recitals I went to see last year). One of the best singers in the school. And just cool. Rachel (Mabel): Has an astounding ability to be really, really nice and really cold at the same time. THE best female voice in the school, and can play the piano too, but I'm not sure to what standard. Fairly open to short conversations. Caroline: Good trumpeter, great musical ear. Not too taken in by grades, but judges on proven merit and experience.  Really friendly and not very quick to take offence. Open to conversation and will allow a little bit of leeway before she starts to stop listening.  OK, I think I've proved it. None of the people I fancy are evil, they're all musical, they are all really nice. What a lot of bloody effort...  Love, Jon Roskilly

       Miller's downstairs... *feels all out of occassion but he's been expressly told not to talk to her or to play with Jasmin's hair..... waaaah!*  Been thinking about Zoe a lot lately... possibly because I haven't been talking to her very much. We haven't been on at the same times... waah....  I saw Rosie this morning. She was disturbed about me keeping on looking at her, as I believe I would be were I her. If a 16 year old kept on looking at you when you were in Y8 I think you'd be nervous too. It's just... wrong. I glanced over to Lizzie on ocassions but she didn't notice, thankfully. I DID notice the constant stares from Beccay, disturbingly enough. Something unusual was the quick, warm glances from a 2nd violin in front of me...  ^^  Actually, reread my blog so far, and it's all been about girls I either have expressed that I do or do not fancy. Well, I didn't express it about Zoe, not in so many words. Argh, I'm a teenager, and I'm not keen on the whole idea.  Wanting to go down and kind of put one arm around Miller and use the hand attached to the other arm to play with Jasmin's hair. Hohum.  Mel and Kirsty at SS could do I Know Him So Well, thinking about it. Yeah, they could do that. Either that or Mel and Gwen. It's just I want 2 people to do it... OOH Sally and Rachel. But Rachel seems to think I either hate her or fancy her and Sally is getting annoyed, it would seem, at how blatantly I stare at her ocassionally. So it comes back to Mel and someone else. Gwen and Suz? Scott and Mel? Scott can do falsetto... Curtis and Scott?  *whistles to try to stop self from going downstairs and talking to Miller*...  Quote of the day: "J'ai guru deva om.

       OK, time to fill a lot of people in on what's been going on.  I'm feeling really ill. And VERY, very tired. And Zoe hasn't been on. Waaaah.  Gwen forbade me from making a move on Miller, Scott's being irrational and forbidding me from not... and last night I had a dream about the Yr. 8 Flautist called Rosie. Slightly paedophilic but she's so cool, fairly small, and not bad looking. Waah. Jon feels dirty.  Scott is just generally trying to push me into relationships I'm not ready for. I can understand why, don't get me wrong, but that doesn't stop it from being annoying and distressing.  The group at school is being torn apart.  Seb doesn't like me no mo.  My throat's packing up.  Dr. Fugler can't accompany me on Thursday.  Mrs. Stanley doesn't like me much because she knows now that I may be in hospital during Pirates of Penzance.  Colwell is beginning to think that I'm getting too much money out of them.  Everyone's either not talking to me or finding me annoying.  My story needs redoing.  I've got to do a shitload of coursework.  I've got nothing better to do than blog.  I got a 3E for my physics h/w, and 7/24 for my Maths.  I didn't do my paper round.  On brighter notes, I've ordered the sheet music for the musical "Chess" today, as have I ordered Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men".  I just had a cheese and pickle sandwich.  CAYO tomorrow, and a band rehearsal.  I'm so tired...

       The whole question posed to me by Scott yesterday has been troubling me, it must be said. Troubled Roskilly...  Talked to Miller a lot tonight ^_^. Tried to flirt as much as humanly possible, it resulted in me flirting as much as is possible for me which isn't a lot, but I think she may have picked up on it at any rate. I think I've disturbed her now... lame. She had a weird top that made it look like I was staring at her breasts but I wasn't! I was just looking at the weird non-sensical ribbons... I wasn't looking at breasts, I promise!! Really! *whines*  Zoe's been complimenting me indirectly tonight ^_^. Thankee Zoe! It means a lot to my self confidence.  Recently I've been feeling very down, very ill, and very tired. I apologise, but I doubt if this will change in the forseeable future. I am ill. I am tired. I am down. But I survive on the fact I'm a trombonist and a singer which is why I look so stuck up at times, I'm sorry. But take them away from me and I shall be indeed alone. Poor fellow.  Hm, thinking about to-Miller, bet your bottom dollar that to-Miller...  Also thinking about Zoe a lot now. Ah well, life continues.  ...Dr. Abbot said GYO need me. That's almost an official plea. I just need the head of GYO to ask and then 3 of the County music heads have told me that. Heavens above. What is the world coming to when I'M that needed? For crying out loud. It's not as if I'm even THAT good!  Miller, I underestimated your coolness.  Quote of the day: "The world is too much with us; late and soon, Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers: Little we see in Nature that is ours; We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon! The Sea that bares her bosom to the moon; The winds that will be howling at all hours, And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers; For this, for everything, we are out of tune; It moves us not. - Great God! I'd rather be A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn; So might I, standing on this pleasant lea, Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn; Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea; Or hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn."

       Right, the last one didn't work. Little sod of a thing.  Scott wants me to mention it so I will... he asked what I consider to be an unfair question of me, but he asked it, so I have an honest response. He may not, it seems, have enjoyed my reply. However, he knows the subject would be one of as little movement as possible on my part, even were I in the position for movement to occur.  Really tired.  Might be getting a new trombone soon... yay!  I need to find an accompanist for next Thursday... eek. Help.  I'm on another course of antibiotics. If these have no effect, I'll have to have tests done on me. I don't want them. I want to be fit. In either sense of the word.  Mel said me and Scott were almost identical ^_^. She didn't use those words, but the general meaning was there ^_^. And she also doesn't think I'm gay ^_^. *adds her name to the ever-decreasing list*  Bob Geldof?

       Morning.  I have to say that this is going to be very quick, I have not much time before Tom's parent (one or the other) will come pick me up to take me to CAYO.  Matrix Revolutions was not as much of a disappointment as Reloaded. The story was OK, the battles were cool. However, it was an amalgamation of too many other films. For instance, a bit where some light goes through Neo's body which is also at the time made of light looks remarkably similar to Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. Also, random asian kid with an annoying voice. Marx didn't like the direction, personally I can't comment, I know about as much as the next musician about directing. I must say I give it about 5/6/7 out of 10, whereas the Mail gave it 2.  Hm, really want to talk to Miller again, she be cool.  England are playing Wales today at rugby. Guess who my support will be going to? That's right; Cymru all the way.  No time for a poetic quote, I apologise. I'll see what I can do later. Sorry...  Love, Jon Roskilly

       First time for a while I've blogged on consecutive days ^_^.  I have a splitting headache, but it matters not; I talked to Miller! Wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooohoo! She's cool, small, and I didn't seem to have the urge to constantly look at her breasts. Not once, in fact, had I the urge to focus my sight on her chest region. *feels all not manlike* But yeah, she's the queen among men. Not that the converstation got me anywhere in particular but 'tis not often that mere mortals are allowed to speak with these demi-gods. And she's certainly demi-sized (alright, enough with the focusing on her smallness). On the way there we were taken by Miller's dad in his Audi TT, which is surprisingly cramped. However, he is a music fanatic ^_^ and likes John Lennon ^_^. What is more, he said he might try and put Rock and Roll (the Lennon album) onto a CD for me ^_^_^. AND he ranks Working Class Hero in his top 3 Lennon songs ^_^_^_^.  I made a really good terragen render of an icy scene today, shall probably use it for some kind of christmas thing on 089.co.uk closer to the time of Christ's celebrated birth. It took me about 50 minutes, and about 40 of that was making the ice look like ice.  Miller, you need to come here and live or something, you're cool.  Quote of the day: "They hurt you at home, and they hit you at school, They hate you if you're clever, and they despise a fool, Till you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules."

       Morning. Well, late night, but who's complaining?  Eeeeeeeeeeeeever so slightly depressed today. Not many people will know why, and those that do will either not read my blog or not care. Depressed. Definitely depressed.  Took some brieftime photos up on Crickley Hill, they should kick arse. Well, the ones that are any good. Some of them were, on the whole, bollocks, but it wasn't that bad. I'll go somewhere on Saturday, there should be millions of fireworks on Saturday. Whoopee! Well, BANG.  I am, it must be said, getting a little distressed about being known at Showstoppers as "Scott's friend, Jon". By being there for about 10 weeks (if you count before the summer as well), one would assume I would be able to be a person in my own right by now. Obviously, I do not assume that I would be thought of as a member impartial to Scott, that'd just be daft. But as a performer, it must be said that I like being accepted in my own right. And that makes me sound a complete arsehole but you know exactly what I mean. Mel, especially, seems to somewhat ignore my prescence. That insinuates different things, but I'm not sure what any of them are. She probably just finds me annoying. That's most people's reason.  Been thinking about Beccay. She is really quite scary, she's got into my mind.  Hm, very much thinking about Mel now.... *hits self so Scott doesn't have to hit him*. Ah. Just noticed the insinuation. No, I'm not thinking about her in THAT way. I was just thinking... I reckon she'd be fairly photogenic... *contemplates asking her to do some modelling type things in Gloucester, dismisses on grounds that she doesn't like him*. Once I've finished this colour film I need to go Zoe to hold up what she said she'd do for me... heheheh... Sorry, that insinuates.  Very, very, VERY lonely.  Quote of the day: "Pray, silence please! The band begins A melody triumphant! The trumpets playing to their whim, The trombones play enjoyment!  Again begins the somber sound, The end is now in sight, Falling for the final ground, The flute again takes flight."  From Jon Roskilly's   For the love of music   Love, Jon Roskilly

       Hiya!  In saying some kind of jolly greeting I appear to give the impression that I am, on the whole, happy. However, I would now like to give the impression that I am right royally narked off.  Sam has been oh-so-clever in realising that she knows Lizzie *feigns shock*. She has also been oh-so-clever in telling me that Lizzie is going out with a 6th former; an eventuality it must be pointed out that I WAS THERE FOR. What was really strange was remembering every detail of the conversation we had on the way back to the bus in Brugge on the Tuesday... We left the teddy bear shop (oh-so-cool) and I talked to her and was generally boring but never mind. Sam is in general narking me off. Never mind the other reasons, because I'm not going to say them to anyone other than Scott and to be COMPLETELY honest I doubt anyone else would keep their mouths shut.  Mr. Cowley (brilliant bloke and great trombonist) has advised that I audition for GYO next year. He says it would be useful for practical, but certainly not any kind of entertainment, reasons. GYO has large-scale pieces that I would be unlikely to find at any other of the youth orchestras scattered around the county. So... Digby, I'll be there in due course. The ever-complimentary Phil also advised that I should go for GYJO in the passage of time... what with a severe lack of Jazz playing this may, however, cause a minor problem.  My English coursework on action sequences from Bond films gained me a B+; this means my Original Writing work will have to be something special in order to pull my grade back up by the scruff of its neck. Excuse me while I say bugger about this. I would have adored the ability to not work myself to death on the Original Writing.  Haven't seen Caroline yet... didn't see her this morning, possibility exists that she'll be at CYB but on recent appearances it might be deemed unlikely. If I knew her any better (or if she wasn't going out with Tim Daley) I might consider 'going after' Lizzie, but I believe it would, even in that circumstance, prove fruitless. I disturbed her too much. I hate saying 'go after' people but it's the closest phrase to what I mean.  I have been given yet MORE tablets by the doctor; they are anti-biotics, once again. They look less intimidating, and have a much nicer flavour. However, they feel like they're knocking you out. I'm on them for a week. Jeremiah. I don't like anti-biotics. Well, I don't like being ill, but that's really a given, I would believe.  I have been found today using many keyboard things, such as using the set drum beats and playing in the chords. Ever-so-slightly beneath my ability as a pianist but it sounded good. Alright, feeling a little under-challenged by it, but still, I don't mind too much, sometimes it's nice to be under-challenged.  I STILL have not recieved this fucking cheque. It is bloody annoying. I need the Â£60. ARGH.  I've been posting this for around half an hour... I believe I put more effort into this than most people. It's like writing an essay about my life. "The alliteration in this sentence shows that I was bloody narked off."  Quote of the day: "Between the dark and the daylight, When the dark is beginning to lower, Comes a pause in the day's occupations, That is known as the Children's hour."  From Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's   Children's Hour   Love, Jon Roskilly

       OK... tired.  I haven't blogged in over a week O_O'. What could have happened to society in that time? Well, I'll tell you, but it'll take SOME reading...    1: Belgium    Belgium was... cool and cold at the same time. Fancied a girl called Lizzie who I completely failed to get off with, was fancied by a girl (yes, a REAL one) called Beccay who kept hugging me (which we both needed at the time, I was worried about Suz like a good li'l brother and she was just depressed), and had general pretend-gay moments with Toby. All-in-all, it was good. We played... outstandingly. Seriously, it was really good. But Digby is leaving us now. >_    2: Zoe's Halloween Do    I came back to be invited by Zoe to her halloween party. Oh, rapture! Such honour has ne'er been experienced by a mere mortal like myself. I got a little bit drunk (only a little, which considering what I had makes me a comparative heavy-weight, apparently) and hugged Lisa, Li'l Joe and Patrick a lot, much to only Lisa's discomfort. It was a good night, despite Max going a bit mad and passing out naked in the loo and making everyone worried about the possibility of alcohol poisoning. Hugged Zoe and she held my hand for a bit ^_^. Honoured! 'Twas fun. Wow, the things you get invited to if you're... well, completely blatant and annoying. Found Zoe overly attractive but I always do when I'm in her prescence for extend periods. Patrick, I'm not blogging it. Look at me not blogging it! Zoe's friends are great... but she doesn't have Scott. I hope the cheque's in the post, mate.    3: Band Practice    OK, it's a little out of order. That happened earlier this evening. I can safely say that it's the worst we ever played, but the Chinese meal we had was nice and tasty. Yum. My throat is really bad at the moment, so most of the songs were out of my range. Grr, I dislike Ben(drummer)'s mum. She first critised "It's a Kind of Magic" for being too high, and then when we transposed it she critised us for playing it wrong! What a CUNT. Never mind, hey? She pissed me off and I had to stop myself from crying during With or Without You. It's because we did the song all the way through, that's when you get the full effect and you almost die of over-emotion. Still, squeh, it wasn't that bad.    4: Bristol + Cribbs Causeway    Really, this only counts as me spending 3 HOURS on my own in Cribbs Causeway. I had Â£18 though. I bought; >> A Wales Rugby 15s hat, which is red and trÃ©s chic (Â£7); >> A beach ball that is big. Yay! (Â£3); >> A Casette player (for the one we have is shit) (Â£5); >> A GLASS of coke (Â£1, what a fucking rip-off); >> A cool chinese necklace thing (Â£2, not bad).  Mum bought me (saying it was for Christmas); >> A black shirt (Â£25); >> A white tie with a silver stitched dragon on it (oh so sexy) (Â£10); >> Some trousers (Â£15).  As a result of buying the tie I now know how to tie a "Windsor knot". Go me!    5: Misc.    OK, we'll go from the top. >> Miller emailed me a couple of times. Yay! Looks like we might be sharing cars sometimes to go to GYWO. Double Yay! And she turned me on, firstly by saying she was wearing a thong (oh so hot) and then by revealing that she had slept in my bed while I was in Belgium (!!! oh so MUCH of a turn-on!). I'd just like to declare to the world... A REALLY GOOD LOOKING BLONDE GIRL WHO IS SMALL WITH LARGE BREASTS SLEPT IN MY BED! WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! Enough of that. >> Sam and Marcus have split. I hope it's not for too long. You know that saying, the only constant is pain? Well, in a way, I hoped they'd prove it wrong. But nothing's right any more. See, I can screw being deep sometimes. I'm not going to say "get back together!" because... what's the fucking point? You can't force people together. Well, you can, and people do. But it's git-worthy. >>Wrote a trombone Duet with Toby... well, now it'd be yesterday, but when I started writing the post (over 30 mins ago) it wasn't. It's a good duet. >>I'm tired and ill... My throat and stomach are both KILLING and I'm going back to see the Doctor on Monday. He's going to say "Ah, well we'll put you on the antibiotics which effectively disibilitate you again, and we'll see how you are in 10 days". Git.  Quote of the day: "Forlorn! the very word is like a bell To toll me back from thee to my sole self! Adieu! the fancy cannot cheat so well As she is fam'd to do, decieving elf. Adieu! Adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades Past the near meadows, over the still stream, Up the hill-side; and now 'tis buried deep In the next valley-glades: Was it a vision, or a waking dream? Fled is that music: - do I wake or sleep?"  From John Keats'   Ode to a Nightinglae   Love, Jon Roskilly

       Anyway.  For some reason the comments are appearing above the posts. Je ne sais pas.  Sam talked to me for a while on AIM today... ich weiÃŸ nicht. She was entirely civil, not calling me a git at all or anything. So... I don't know, is that a good thing? I don't know.  This Laura person, whoever she is, she's quite cool. I don't actually know much about her, but she's... yeah, she's cool.  Anyway, I don't actually have that much to post about, so I'm going to do one of those weird posts about current affairs.  The United States is insisting that all flights invading their air space be equipped, as it were, with armed "air marshalls". This is supposed to be as a measure against airbourne terrorism striking the States. British pilots are advised to ground flights if they have any concerns over the safety of having air marshalls on board. Personally, were I a pilot, I would not take off until the armed (!)policemen(!) were dragged kicking and screaming from my aeroplane. I am, in no way, keen on the idea of having these marshalls on the plane, for a few reasons;    I just don't like the idea of having guns on a plane in general. They're not supposed to be able to rip through the shell of the plane but personally... if it can't from point-blank then it won't kill anyone, which is the thing it needs to do.   People say that having a marshall on your flight would be a comfort. I disagree. The general public is made nervous by a police prescence, it makes you feel that something IS wrong. It accentuates the point in your mind that, although there's only a minute chance that a terrorist is going to be on the flight, that one could be on yours. Yes, they're going to be undercover, but you'll know that they're there.   As they're undercover... if you sit next to someone on a flight, and you notice they've got a gun, how are you to tell if they're a marshall or not? 50% would report it, 50% would assume it was a marshall. And if the someone in the 2nd 50% was wrong...   IF there was a terrorist on board, they wouldn't have to worry about a gun fight. They could just secretly pull out a gun and shoot at the shell, and bingo, everyone dies. How would a marshall know that someone had explosives hidden in their hat, or shoes? And if there WAS a gun fight... once again, they'd shoot the shell if they were going to die anyway. It makes no sense.   It's well known that when you close a door, someone opens a window. This applies to terrorism, also. Obviously. Each measure we put in place to stop it, people go round it. How do you think they're going to go round this one? You're going to get terrorist air marshalls, aren't you? Let's be honest.     Obviously, there are reasons for it. But I don't have time to go ov... I lie, I can't be bothered to put the opposite point of view in this argument, because, to be honest, it doesn't matter. It's yet another mindless bit of American "We've got an idea, and who cares that it might be the worst ever". I'm not keen on governments... at all.  Quote of the day: "I'm nobody! Who are you? Are you nobody, too? Then there's a pair of us, don't tell! They'll banish us, you know!  How dreary to be somebody! How public, like a frog To tell your name the livelong day To an admiring bog!"  Emily Dickinson's   I'm Nobody! Who are you?   Love, Jon Roskilly

       Today war fine.  Went into Gloucester with Scott, we didn't do a lot.  Saw Mel in Gloucester, I was uncomfortable while they had a conversation. I don't know. Jon's made uncomfortable by Melissa. Not to say she's not nice and I don't like her, but she makes me uncomfortable. Ich weiß nicht.  Bob Monkhouse died i_i. RIP, Bob.  Anyway, je ne sais pas.

Scott and I are meeting in town tomorrow... weeeeeeee!  Anyway, sorry I can't post more right now, I'm really tired, y'see.  I won't do a quote for today, I'll try and get one done later.  Love, Jon Roskilly  PS. Naomi's talking to me a bit now. Not that she wasn't for any reason before but we're getting on better, we're actually talking somewhat. Benefit!

       OK, just over 10 days. You must be getting used to it by now. I really am sorry, I should learn to log on and come straight here. Well, not that anyone reads it anymore... who am I kidding, I AM that arrogant. Sorry if you've been finding the same post too often.  I went swimming at Tom's until 1, that was fun. I've got to go back to Tom's for a band practice starting at 10... Scott,  if you're up and reading this before 1 PM, please phone my Mum and tell her things about whether or not you want to go into Cheltenham town or Gloucester town.  Keeping secrets is not fun, I'm having to about 2 people. One of them is a secret that doesn't bother me, and the other is just a little annoying.  Please don't see this as flirting, I'm doing this to get it off my conscience. Please, Marx, if you're reading this, forward it to Sam, or if you're reading this Sam... well, read it. It's not flirting or anything, just need to get it out. I've been thinking a lot recently about why Sam hates me so much, and why I'm scared of her. Basically, I've realised that although she is, in general, actually evil, what she did in going out with Marx isn't actually wrong, in fact it's the right thing to do rather than dragging it out for too long. Which happened anyway, but I believe that to be because she didn't want to hurt me. And however fucked up I was at the time there's no excuse for what I did. And in general what she said about me is true, I am annoying, and I am boring, I worked that out recently too. I've had some time to think. What am I trying to get across? Basically, I'm too sorry, I know that can't solve anything but it's better than mapping out the words in my head each night. I don't mean to hurt anyone. Marx, I'm sorry to you, Sarah too, Buzzy, Patrick,Beccay, Zoe... anyone who I've hurt unintentionally but selfishly, I apologise. *gets hit* Thankyou, Sir, may I have another! Not written as a question. It's shouted, so it should be ?! but that's angered surprise.  Oh, plus side; I made £12.50 busking on Dec 23rd. Minus side; my slide is out of line and the earliest it can be fixed is the 2nd. If I practice up till then there's a good chance of seriously damaging the inner slide, which would cost... a lot to repair. BUGGER. When you consider I've got the Gloucestershire Youth Musician audition on the 4th... BUGGER! I mean, I know I'm not anywhere near good enough to get it (I'm not insulting myself here, I know full well I'm not the best young musician in Gloucestershire, and that's like saying my hat is red and has "Cymru" written on it), but I would have liked to have been able to practice more.  I believe that I have done more revision for the mocks than most, as I've done 45 mins on every subject barr Music, French, and German. Not to say that's enough, I'm not good at exams so I'll have to do some more, but still... I want to get some good marks, what's wrong with that?  I ordered the sheet musics for Les Mis and Miss Saigon last night. When they arrive, that'll take my musical score selection up to 5 (not including Martin Guerre, which isn't mine, I'm just borrowing it indefinitely) . BENEFIT.   I may try and go back to choir next Friday. It's hard, though. John's not there... and Sam is. Apart from that, I know Richard well enough to warrent conversation, Max, Peter and Luke don't like me, not knowing why but I'm guessing Sam calls me a bastard or something, which she's perfectly in her right to do... alright, that's slightly harsh, sorry. Anyway, though... I don't know. Am I leaving the choir, or have I just not been there for a while? Lord knows.  Rereading that bit up there, I will almost certainly recieve some not entirely nice emails regarding my wording of my apology, but when I've been thinking of how to word it for a while... I'm not changing it.  OH and for some random reason I've taken to learning Swedish.  Quote of the (11) day(s): "Laugh Punicello! for the love that is ended!

       Sorry, it happened again. I don't have a lot of time at the moment.  I was at a funeral yesterday; a girl at STRS was killed in a car accident and the choir were asked to sing at her funeral. At a church called St. Mary's. Sally was there, and she cried. I hope she's in school tomorrow. I don't want my lingering image of her over the holidays to be of her crying. Not good.  Just been to the choir party... not a lot to comment on, other than the inclusion of a Tom Lehrer CD which was played continuously. Gloria patri et philio.  I'm going to Aroma demain... w00toid. C'est bon.  Uh, I really need to get a more interesting life, don't I?

       I'm tired.  Anyway, GYWO concert war sehr gut, und ich habe der Posaunelehrer von Toby übergespielt. Youpi! Ich habe viel gegessen, und je crois que j'ai fait un fool of myself.  Anyway... finding myself annoyingly attracted to the 2 Hannahs on the bus. It's annoying because they both have the same name. What with Caroline too, then Rachel, Miller (kinda), Sally... heh, I'm back, folks.  Blood test results were good. I passed, I suppose you might term it. I don't have diabetes, TB, or a number of things. In fact, the results were what you might expect from a nicely healthy person. So it's just sinuses. W00t.  THE GIG YESTERDAY WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! Or for those of you who can't read upper case for some reason; the gig yesterday was absolutely amazing. It was really fun. Tara did a weird dance afterwards, and was annoyingly attractive for a 12 year old. It was a little disturbing. What was more disturbing was Tom's dad being incredibly happy when she came out in a miniskirt, saying "Great, now we can see her legs!". Scary man. But yeah, roll on Sunday! Prestbury Scout hut, everyone, remember!  I'm about 100 pages into Grapes of Wrath now. It's quite good so far. Well, yeah, it is.  I'm really busy, and it's not helping.  Zoe, I'm missing you and I talked to you a couple of days ago. You have weird effects on me, lady of Charlton Kings. Look forward to talking to you soonish.

       Heh... last post: Nov 28th... sorry about that.  Marx and Sam are back together. I'd call him stupid for doing it, but it's obvious so I won't. I'm Cheltenham-living. Hoorah.  I'm doing one of the solos in The Holly And The Ivy for the carol concerts, and I'm doing the 3rd reading in one of them. So go that.  The band has 2 gigs this week; tomorrow and Sunday. ARrrrrrrrrrrrrghifarghy. If you add coursework into the equation... much to do about much.  I'll try and post again later, but I'm  a bit stocked-up at the moment.  Love, Jon Roskilly

       I'm not happy at the moment. Where some people are ecstatic, I'm actually really depressed, tired, I've got a headache, my head hurts, I'm worried, and.... *cries* I'm not feeling too great at the moment. In no way am I pleased with myself.  I've spent the majority of this evening and tonight thinking about what people would say about me if I died, how many people would be at my funeral etc. I don't like it. I don't like the idea of me dying, I don't like the idea of the things left unsaid being said and hurting more than they should, and I definitely don't like the idea of the things that wouldn't hurt almost killing. I'm not keen.  Everything's just pissing me off tonight. Gwen was singing while she came up the stairs, to which I shouted at her "SHUT UP!" and scared her, Pete asked me if he could borrow Chess and kept asking me why I'd said no so I told HIM to shut up... I'm not feeling very good about anything right now.  And I think explaining how I feel would make some peoples' lives quite complicated. The situation being complicated ANYWAY. For crying out loud.... why is everything I do always ridiculously complicated?

       I've been reading through my old archives instead of going to bed, and I've realised I used to be quite witty;  'I've been posting this for around half an hour... I believe I put more effort into this than most people. It's like writing an essay about my life. "The alliteration in this sentence shows that I was bloody narked off."'  That was possibly the coolest thing I've EVER said in my life. Seriously. Heh, I used to be cool. Where'd that go...  Love, Jon Roskilly

       Hiya.  Had House Music auditions today, that war alright. I've got the audition for my solo tomorrow. Eee, wish me luck, pwease. I'm unlikely this year, the cellist who's going for it is supposed to be pretty professional. So, wish me luck for the impossible!  Laura isn't happy at the moment >_  Rachel is sooo not liking me at the moment. Seriously, looks thrown at me are eeeevil. Heh, I don't understand why, but each to their own. I guess not everyone can like me! But yeah, it's mildly disturbing. Her apparent hate of me is not improved by the fact she's one of the band's rivals for House Music O_O. Eep. You can see I'm not going to be the flavour of the month if we win. I was surprised to find that she could play the bass. I never should have been surprised, because she can't actually PLAY the bass, she can pick it up and hit the strings.  And I've decided that I'm going to put the Senior Drama Group in front of CAYO, and recieve the flak from CAYO for doing so. And if Matt Bick insults me for doing so, if anyone insults me for doing so, they will see what I'm like when I go over the edge. Seriously, DON'T FUCK WITH ME at the moment. I may be making important decisions about what I'm doing, but I'm making sacrifices, and I'm letting people down, and I'm feeling guilty. Don't mess with me now.  Along with that decision, I'm readressing the question of a few days ago. The question has once again come to mind, and another question comes with it; "Do I have too much to lose?".  I'm tired. I'm sleepy. I'm angry. I'm feeling guilty. I'm Jon.  Quote of the day: "Who am I? Can I condemn this man to slavery? Pretend I do not see his agony?

       DO YOU LIKE THE DESIGN FOR MY BLOG? Yes, you do, infidels. You soooo do. I love that banner. Sexy banner. Oooh. Oooh sexy banner. Won't you come home, Bill Bailey, won't you come home.  Anyway, very tired. VERY, very tired. But contented. Talking to Fi. She's nice. It's unfair that Fi, Nikky, and Laura are all really nice. Some of their nicitude should be shared with people who are bitches. Silliness. Total silliness. Although, only Fi's on, which is a blessing in itself, but I was going to talk to Laura... no offence meant, I've just known Laura for longer, and I also want to work out whether I'm going to be able to go with her to this Thursday thingamabibble.   Aach. Really tired, I can't blog much more. Missing talking to Laura, a day's break seems to be too long.  Quote of the day: "Guide me, O thou great redeemer, Pilgrim through this barren land.

       Welcome to Saturday.  I've got nothing at all to do today, I'm bored, and the mentality lingers of me not being able to cope. Laura's been on for a sec, long enough to find out that she's alright, so that's a real plus, but other than that today has been slow at best. And my head is hurting and everything... I'm being a whiny git but I'm not with it at the moment.  *long, low frequency whine* I'm just tired, and I've got a blocked throat and everything. It doesn't help the fact that I'm mildly depressed anyway as a result of being a teenager, so it's all a big pile of poo.  I've been described twice recently as "lovely". I'm not... entirely sure of what is meant. What I assume it to mean is that I'm nice, and it's an alternate word for saying that, you know? I can't really think of any other meaning. It's the only one that comes to mind. But I am famed for getting the wrong end of the stick. I don't know how I could get the wrong end of the stick here, but if anyone could I'd be the one to do it, let's be honest. I think I'm getting a bit peculiar.  Suz is stealing the net at 6, hoping I can get it back to talk to people... alright, I lie, to talk to Laura, but still. Maybe I say that too much on here. I don't know, answers on a stamped, addressed envelope to Blue Peter... I'm just tired, really. I don't really talk much to anyone else.  I'm tired, a little depressed, but not entirely unhappy. I reckon something good's going to happen to me soon.  Quote of the day: "It's only just out of reach, Down the block, on a beach Under a tree...

       *cries* Waaaaaaah... like everyone else, it seems, I haven't had a good day. Not a good day at all.  I got like... 3 hours sleep last night, because I simply couldn't get to sleep, we'll leave the reason why out of it. And I haven't been feeling well, my head's been splitting and my brain's not working properly today,it's all not fun. Found out I was one of the worst in the class in maths, which was... I suppose to be expected. It was raining really hard while I was doing my papers, and to cap it all the senior drama group production clashes with a CAYO thing at the Pump Rooms. So everything can just go and die today, I can't cope with it all at the moment.  I was kinda hoping Laura'd be on, I really like talking to her, but she wasn't, so I'm kind of bored, and a little annoyed at the day. I mean, I wouldn't show it with her, but I'd still be annoyed. I haven't had the best of days. Then again, neither has she *hugs*.  ...And Mr. Pickard's arsed up my 4 hours of work on the light entertainment, saying that I can do it "another time". I'm going to have to have words with him, I think. Probably like this; "With all due respect, fuck the hell off." I can't cope with losing 5 hours for no real reason. He can do his Flanders and Swann in his house if he really wants to do it, this is the thing I'm in control of.  But you know, on major plus, might be seeing Laura a coupla times next week. Which would be unbelieveably cool. It would certainly make up for today being a big pile of awful.  [No quote today.]  Love, Jon Roskilly

       Yes, those who read yesterday's will know that when I give myself an ultimatum like that, the never-failing result is "forget it". It pisses me off to do it but I can't be a completely selfish wanker 100% of the time, and I can't make things more difficult by doing the other option, so I'll bide my time, I guess. Phuff. It's just... we go together like ramma lamma lamma ka dinga da dinga dong (thankyou Scott for the idea).   Today I have felt ill. Today I have felt miserable. Today I have felt guilty. But, today I have been to Bristol and heard some of the greatest poets of our time reading their poems. W00t. The poet I most respect who was there: Gillian Clarke. The best performer: John Cooper-Clarke. Carol Ann Duffy: Must write better poetry. C+.  I'm not going to be a git and say why I've been down today. I just have. So NYAAAAAAH.

       *swears violently* Jon, either make a move or forget it... I know, I'm blogging to myself, it's strange but this is in effect a diary for me, and it just happens that people read this. People that I'd rather hadn't seen that comment. Not that they'll understand it. Eugh, I'm just in a mood with myself for... well, not exactly being selfish, just a little self-involved. *swears again* I need to make up my mind about a few things.  *shakes* Relaxing relaxing...  Random comment, I've learnt the vowel pronunciations for Swedish, now. Which is cool. For example, did you know that å in Swedish is either pronounced like the "aw" in Raw or the "o" in Scot, depending on whether it's long or short? I betcha didn't. Jon's pleased with himself on that front. 1 hour of learning, and I know how to pronounce å.  Also, had a natter with Hector, cause he caught the 94, and then we walked home, because he lives on my route of walking. So, that was quite weird. He's cast me as Mr. Hale. Those of you reading this who're from Tommies, or whom I have told who Mr. Hale is, will understand my annoyance.  Hooooooooojjjjjjjjs. Not in the mood of the century.  Quote of the day: "I might have known the bitch could bite, I might have known the cat had claws, I might have guessed your little secret. Ah yes, the virtuous Fantine!

       *whimpers* Sorry, Laura, got pulled off the internet while you were not there. Sorry if you came back and I seemed rude.  I'm off to C(the wizard)YB in about an hour now, so by the time I've finished this post >_  *whines* My chest huuuuuuuuuuurts. See yesterday for reason, it hurts. Waaah.  Ended up talking to Laura at about 2PM today, for she had a free and came home. So we had a taaaaaaalk. I couldn't really think of much to say, though. My conversational skills leave a little to be desired.  Just talked to Nikky, too. Nikky being Laura's friend. Laura is not online, but Nikky was, and is now leaving me on me own. So I'm blogging again. *strums guitar*  This post has already taken me 30 mins. Quit while I'm ahead.  Quote of the day: "Life without Cosette means nothing at all.

       Hiya, it's an inset day today, so I'm sitting at home with my guitar, doing sod all. Isn't doing sod all fantasic? Well, no it's not, but it's better than doing things.  I'm actually doing really well on my minimalist piece for GCSE. Not that I've done a lot on it today, the majority of the work was last night. But it's sounding quite authenticly minimalist. But, as with everything I do, there is a real downside; it sounds slightly too much like the work of Steve Reich, who in terms of minimalism is my inspiration. But oh well, hopefully it will be deemed different enough to get a good mark. I've got a 5-4 bar in it ^_^.  My hair's actually quite long again now, as if I hadn't noticed. It's getting there, folks, it's getting there.  Aw, though. Laura told me not to wear my hat all the time. I like my hat. It's cool and Welsh. Well, actually, it's from Bristol, but that can be our secret. Yes, ours, so that's the around 4 people that read this (which makes me sound really smug, but if I say 2 then the other 2 complain) and mine. So, funfun.  Anyway, I'll endeavour to repost later, at the moment, I'm off to get lunch. Ciao!  Love, Jon Roskilly

       Argh, too tired, so I'll make this brief as possible.  In Les Mis, it appears I'm not only Marius, I'm also Foreman, Bambatois, a convict, and a labourer. Eugh. At the end of the day, I have too much to learn. And that's all you can say for the life of the Jon. Rhiannon didn't get a main part >_ _  Eugh, I'm tired, and now a little depressed, it happens to the best of us. I'll talk to everyone at a later date.  Oh, good thing though, inset day tomorrow. Yay!  Love, Jon Roskilly

       Hiya, welcome to Sunday.  I've done my daily blog-round... ie. I've read everyone's blogs, so I'm kind of at a loss for what to do. There are only 3 people online on MSN, and one of them is French, and so I'm intensely bored, right at the moment.To be honest, online I only really have CONVERSATIONS with Laura and Jodie. Sometimes with Scott, but it's not usually very detailed. So, I'm bored, and blogging. Blogging and bored. Coming to think of it, it's not a very good combination because I'm just going to bore all of you by blogging when I'm bored, but still, worth a try.  One of the passport photos me and Laura got done (I ripped them so that we both got 2, quite masterfully, even if I say so myself) is in Laura's wallet ^_^ one's on her wall ^_^ one's on my wall ^_^ and one's going to go in my wallet after I've had enough of it being on my desk ^_^. Jon's pleased. Although I've got nothing really to count down to, now. Mocks are gone, it's AAAGES until any concerts or performances I've got... I suppose I could count down the 1.5 hours or so until the Les Mis rehearsal. That'd do. *counts seconds on watch* Hm, I need to meet her again soonish.  I'm really getting into the Dubliners. I bought the CD ages ago, but now it's one of the few CDs that I don't skip through. Obviously, I ripped it onto my PC, and so some of the tracks come up when I do the "All Music" thing, which I tend to. But still... Dubliners are cool and Irish.  Oh, could also count down to Zoe's birthday party! Which I've been invited to, for the first time EVER. It's still 13 days away, but still, I really want to have things to count down to, to make up for the low I'm on after yesterday's supreme high.  I'm trying to redesign my blog, as I have been inspired by Lisa.  Quote of the day: "I've been a Wild Rover for many's the year, And I've spent all me money on whiskey and beer. But now I'm returning with gold in great store, And I never will play the Wild Rover, no more."  From the Irish Folk song   The Wild Rover   Love, Jon Roskilly

       W00t!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I've met Laura! *dances*  Today was the best day I've had in a while, which isn't saying a lot, I know. But Laura is... very cool. She has a voice that is much higher than I thought, but it's cool. And she's not short, she's "vertically challenged". How cool... we spent many times in Ottakars, which was actually really fun cause we weren't glued together, we had a bit of a look on our own before meeting up again. Which is nice, usually I feel awkward and end up being glued to the person, but that was nice. It really was... ended up not making too much of a fool of myself, too. I showed her where Badlands was. And as she said on her blog ( here ) there was a really strange song on the raddyo, the lyrics of which made us both giggle. They were sooo awful, seriously. But yeah... *sighs contendly* she's cool. *swoons and falls off chair* We got passport photos done, too. They're quite cute. And I didn't let her (though she wanted to) get the one of me grinning like a psycho... either a psycho who was about to stab her, or had my hand somewhere. I'll let you figure that one out. But still... *swoons again*  Lisa's blog is amazing. It is très cool ein design. Really is. Anyway...  CAYO was actually quite good this morning, too. Met Jack Kane's sister, who didn't appreciate me saying she looked like him, a little. But she doees, a bit. A bit.  *sighs* It was worth counting down to. Seriously, at 4PM yesterday, with Scott in Gloucester, I said "yay, 22 hours" so that'll show you how much I was looking forward to it. 'Twas worth it.

       I'm really blogging to fill up the time until Laura gets back, as her mum is using the PC. So... *whistles*  Skiing was really fun today. I fell over 3 times; once was a deliberate bail rather than be faced with skiing backwards, once was going too fast up a ramp, other was going to slowly up a ramp. None of them hurt in the least, which was nice. When I went too fast was the coolest, I slid down kind of the way you read in bed. Twas fun.  Showstoppers was strange, all I can say about it. We didn't get much done.  Sally's emailed me back. Yay. Right email address. She was confussled about my name on MSN 'til she saw my email address, which gives it away slightly. Part of it being "Jon". But yeah, she's emailed me back. Mental use of smilies, it really is insane.  I'm knackered, but pleased with life. And I'm meeting Laura on Saturday, which continues to be something I tell to my friends, who promptly reply "...who's Laura?". Bliss.  Anyway, must... stop blogging. I've got nowt useful to say.

       Back from Winchcombe, blogging quite late, but never mind.  I'm still giddily happy about meeting Laura on Saturday... I don't know, she has cool eyes, is swoonable, and is generally cool.  I also realised that I can never let Sally see my sites, because she will get to my blog, where I've spent most of my time talking about her... whoops!  Oh, and Libby, if you're reading... hi! Heh, my blog has a fan. She was probably being sarcastic, but at least it gets read. She quoted it at me in an attack so she must read it.  Anyway, yes... slightly too knackered to say a lot more, I'll repost tomorrow after I get back from Scott's. Promise!  Lots of love, Jon Roskilly

       I got SO STRESSED during today that my head was imploding. It was not fun. This light entertainment thing is driving me round the bend. Oh well. *sighs*  Heh, first time I read through Laura's blog and she was saying about wanting to be with a musician who was in a local band, that kind of drew my attention nicely. Turns out it was someone called Chris, but I can dream.  Oh, got the results of my Les Mis audition..... I'M DOING MARIUS WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  Anyway, also, probably meeting up with Laura on Saturday. How cool is that? We're probably going to spend almost the entire time having a chat in Ottakars... meh, for me, that's more of a coolness x 4 type thing than something that's going to deteriorate it. Meeting Laura. Yay!  Got Sally's email address. You know how that one pans out. She gave me the wrong addy, didn't she? Bloody hell. I guessed at what she'd said about her address, she copied it down wrong. Argh, though. Before you people that fancy me (I'm talking to YOU, brick wall) have a heart attack; I'm not asking her out, I just need a way to keep in contact with her, cause she's helping me with the organisation. In theory.  Meeting Laura on Saturday ^O^. I'm also going to have the equivalent of a half day at school on Friday, cause no mocks for us, just music practicals. So, yay, go into Gloucester and deposit my thing about Work Experience into D, S + P. Luverly stuff.  Skiing tomorrow, yay. You have no idea how stressed I was getting about this light entertainment thing today at school though. I nearly cried. Seriously, I came close. The back of my eyes were stinging like mad.  Anyway, I'll try and post again later.  Quote of the day: "Phantom faces at the window, Phantom shadows on the floor, Empty chairs at empty tables Where my friends will meet no more..."

       Eugh, I've got the Les Mis auditions later today! Wish me luck! Hypothetically speaking, that is. By the time you've wished me luck I'll probably have already done it. No-one cross 2 pairs of fingers, that's bad luck, just 1 pair will be helpful. Thankyou!  Anyway, 089.co.uk is redesigned.  Go see! . It's actually probably one of my best designs. Nice and simple, gets the point across. ...Well, actually, to tell you the truth, there's less of a point on it than on W.H. Round's Sphere for Fat People but still...  Mebbe I should get off the net and practice my singing. Actually, though, my throat feels like Hell. If Hell was a load of phlegm. I don't care how that's spelt, but still... yuck. I'm sucking a strepsil at the moment. Hoping that's going to help.  You ever noticed how many contradictions each paragraph seems to have? I don't want to appear indecisive. As that is entirely not the case.  I can't decide whether I want to go for M. Thenardier at the auditions, as well as Marius and Valjean. OBVIOUSLY I'm only going to get one of them, not all three. That would be a very inconvenient experience. I don't know. Maybe, maybe not. I'll see how I feel at the time.  Still haven't got round to learning Java, doing my Brass Band and Jack Teagarden fanlistings, and thinking of a decent theme for my site. Still haven't revised for the mocks on Monday. I'm about as organised as the United Nations Security Council.  Quote of the day: "You shall go out with joy, And be sent forth with peace.

       Today... less good. To tell the truth, I've had better days. Not that it was particularly bad, just I got inwardly annoyed quite a few times today.  We'll start from the very beginning (it's a very good place to start). Again, for the 4th time this term, neither mine nor Mum's alarms went off, forcing me to take the 94 into Gloucester. Upside, though, is that I got in at 0820 today, whereas last time I got in at 0905. But still, yeah. Then I had a long private study period. Not too bad. Physics mock. Which was pretty fucking solid.  Spent the entire time during lunch whizzing around, trying to locate either Sally or Rachel to discover possible rehearsal times. I also needed to tell Rachel that she'd probably be doing Last Night of The World with Scott. Couldn't find either of them, it was like trying to find 6th formers in a Primary School, although this was a Secondary School. And I still couldn't find them. General feeling was "bugger". Then, get lumbered with the fact that Pete's already put me in charge of organising the music for this light entertainment thing, and spent a ridiculously large amount of time thinking about themes, and songs people could do. My brain is wiped for ideas. Sam Taunton seems to want to fuck up my whole schedule, I'm damned if I'm going to let him take over the performances. I know he's come back from almost dying but that doesn't mean he should get all the songs. Alright, that's a little harsh, but it's taken a lot of brain power, and it's going to take a lot of the time I don't have, organising this. I don't have time for people to mess it up before I've even started. >_  THEN, after school, choir. Usually, first rehearsal back is a jolly occasion where we do sod all. Not today. We sang through the entire first number of Carmina Burana (O Fortuna), which goes up to a Bb and is the only written tenor part in an SATB lineup that I've ever seen go up there. Later, discovered that the tenor part goes up to a C! Fuck...  Get home. Alex and the kids are laughing all the time, which cuts through me like a knife. Gwen's in a piss for no reason. Bugger it, go and play the piano and get told to shut up by Jericho, who's watching the telly. I promptly respond "no" and continue practicing Last Night Of the World, which I discover to have 6 sharps. Once again, fuck, but for the reason that I CAN'T go wrong under a duet of Rachel and Scott. That'd be travesty. So I sit there, hammering away, being told that's "enough" from Alex, who's a little wanker when he wants to be. Supper. Not too bad, no reason to be pissed off at supper. Dad's constant nattering on the phone stopped me from doing my paper round. And I know that now this is all yesterday, but fuck that.  Was promptly reminded (reminded being the key word, given that I knew nothing about this until I was "reminded") that I was to put the skittles up at the St. Mary's Social thing. So, I thought, should be a laugh. Ollie and I usually natter a bit. WRONG. Ollie wasn't there, I spent my entire time feeling on my own, and (I'm not saying this is either of their faults, they're wonderful people and they didn't mind when I interjected, BUT) feeling cut out from Rhiannon and Dan conversing. Every time Dan went somewhere else, I wanted to talk to Rhiannon, I love talking to Rhiannon. But nothing came to say, and she looked at me uncomfortably, while I felt ill, wanted to retreat. I liked seeing her happy though, while she was talking to Dan. I liked seeing Dan happy while he was gloating about how strange his life as a student was. I didn't mind being cut out, so much. I did when I was interjecting and it was completely irrelevant, and I minded the look Rhiannon gave me. It was as if I was some kind of sub-human idiot. Which, it must be said, may be true, but I don't want to be reminded of the fact. And she didn't mean to do it, I'm sure she didn't, but she wanted to catch up with an old friend, which I can appreciate. In comparison to Dan (and most people, coming to think of it) I'm a little more than just a bit boring. But... I don't know, I like talking to Rhiannon, this seems more of a rant than it should.  In comparison, Mr. T's put me in for my Grade 8, taking the pressure of choice off my shoulders, I've sorted out almost all the pieces for the light entertainment, I've completed a week of my mocks already, Zoe's invited me to her B-day party, Laura's sent me an email, and I saw Rhiannon. I'm still annoyed, and very tired. But... yeah, I do have a right to be, I can be annoyed if I want. I wish I wasn't, it's all so insignificant. Heh, Dan said that I'd come home and blog about everything. Well, Dan, I did ^^.

       Today was good, yeah. It really was.  I had individual run-throughs with Sally and Rachel at lunchtime. Rachel was first, and got a bit frustrated, I think. Sally was second and we had a quite good time, we played I Know Him So Well and then we just basically struck Chess. That was really cool. Thanks ever so much Sally for making me happier than I've been in a long time, I'm not kidding. You're cool. Marry me. Well, no, although that'd be cool.  Mocks have been going quite well, thanks. Yeah, not too bad. Maths was a pain in the arse, and I've got physics tomorrow, but it should be OK. I was thinking about Sally all the way through the French reading test today though, so I might not have done too well. But I don't mind. I like thinking about Sally. I'm a little worried that Rachel won't want to continue to do I Know Him So Well as she did seem to get a bit frustrated. Hm, I'm worried she doesn't like me. I don't mean like as in fancy, I mean like as in friendly. She's nice.  Yeah. I'd say I was in love with Sally, but I'm not, so I won't. But I'm comfortable around her. That is incredibly unusual for me.  Anyway, found out Caroline's last name, then proceeded to forget it. How clever am I?  I didn't get into the last round of the GYM, to be honest I'm not surprised. I wasn't going into it to win. I was going in it to prove to myself that I'd try. And I did. And I kicked arse with the Rimsky. Not enough to win, but I kicked arse. Seriously.

Maths. Sucking. Not sure wheter it's calc/non-calc, but still.  I think I either treat this too much like a diary or I make it too boring... which one... hm.

       Right, coming to the end of New Year's Day.  Hope everyone's not too hungover... perhaps a little late to say that.  Anyway, taking my trombone into Secondwind tomorrow, Ian Brown is going to sort out the buggered-up slide and make it less up-buggered. Then I've got to do my paper round, then I'm off to Tom's for a band practice. Wouldn't it be nice if we were older? Then we wouldn't have to wait as long...  Laura's in Devon... *raps fingers on desk* She's fun to talk to. Not that other people aren't... it's just conversation topics have run out. With Laura I can go over ones I've used before, because I haven't actually done them with her. And if worst comes to worst I could have an interesting conversation about drugs, like I did before with Saz. That was strange.  This is a strange thing to say, but still... my hair feels really nice today. You know how sometimes your hair is crap? Well, mine isn't. It's really soft and manageable, and... don't let me be a hairdresser. Don't let me say things like that again. HELP!  I spent a lot of today playing FFX. Tidus is doing 99,999 a hit... git. Auron's only doing 50,000. Well, when he's at 6,000 health he does 99,999. It's unfair that he has to LOSE health to do more damage. ...I just realised half the people who read this (ie. Scott and Miller, the other half bein... alright, everyone who reads this) won't understand it, but still, you know the basic concept. Argh, buggeryfalloockle. That's the one.  I have a strange urge to write a lot. This urge is not aided by the fact I have nothing to talk about. I'll quit while I'm only marginally behind.

Tobin and his wife... excuse me, girlfriend,  were a bit odd and quite glued, although they seemed almost breaking apart at the end. Je ne sais pas.  Really knackered, and to be honest I was appaled to read in Patrick's blog that himself and Sam are going out. What?  Anyway... tired to Hades, I'll repost later. Ciao.

       *shrugs* Today, I am content. Not like yesterday, yesterday the correct description would have been "not-unhappy". Today I am content? Why, I hear you ask? Well, despite not having the chance to talk to Laura... or Fi, coming to think of it... or Nikky... since Friday (Nikky since Thursday, come back Nikky!)... Fi and Ging are doing really well, it seems, so Fi's happy, so that has a reaction with me... I'm getting on OK it seems at Les Mis, we've almost done all of it now, and we've done where I get shot, so that's all well and good... I didn't do my trombone practice today so I'm not as nervous as usual (practicing highlights errors, so if I practice I feel like I'm going to do abysmally)... I don't have to get up as early tomorrow (doctor's appointment)... I guess the only thing wrong is that I am feeling... insignificant, I guess. Not extraordinary, just... mediocre in every sense. But even in saying that... I am content.  In a typical me-style, I am beginning to get a little obsessed with Olivia, who is playing Eponine... never mind, it's the voice, I tells ya... nah, this isn't quite like when I get obsessed with people in that I fancy them too much *coughs* it's more like I want to get to know her, you know? It's... odd. I know bugger all about her, but she seems nice... and she has a superb voice... and she dies in my arms... Ohohoh, at Les Mis, while it occurs, me and Naomi (Cosette) spent about half an hour trying to work out how to hold hands. Seriously... At first, we kind of just gripped hands, and it looked like we were going to have an arm-wrestle, then afterwards we did the "gripping the fingertips" thing... which made me look like I was in love with Enjolras (who I did seem to sing some of A Little Fall of Rain to, strangely enough, when Olivia wasn't there)... seriously, it's so much simpler with Olivia, because she's very much into the contact thing, which is nice. It's very unprofessional of me to say this, but I like her hugging me. I like hugs. I get quite a few, too, cause apparently I'm quite good at hugging... see, I'm not bad at  everything , just most things.  *sighs* There are times when being unprofessional makes you feel kinda... weird, you know... not that me being weird is in any way out of the ordinary.  Despite feeling insignificant lately, I've also been feeling very, very detached from everyone, like no-one understands anything about me. I suppose, in a way, that's true, because it's fairly difficult to know when to take me seriously or not. But... I love all my friends, some in more than one way, but even so I find it difficult to relate... to get close to anyone. It's not one of those "I don't want to be hurt" things, more an "I suck at getting close to people" thing. I guess it's the subtle mix of maturity and immaturity that makes it so hard to communicate.  Oh, but I will tell you all this, despite the fact it seems a bit cheap to say it on here rather than keep it to myself - I have made a pretty big sacrifice for Lent... I have given up chocolate, in no half-measure. White, Dark, truffles, chocolate yoghurt, chocolate mousse, hot chocolate... even Galaxy is out until Maundy Thursday. Why is this a bad thing? Because... I am a chocoholic. I buy at least one 400g bar of Galaxy a week, usually, and I tend to buy at least one chocolate bar a day (Wispa, Galaxy Ripple usually). At band, I have a Milkybar in the break, which they kindly give to me. I'm not good at not eating chocolate. I've gone half a week, and that's had serious downs - I realised on Wednesday that I would not be able to get any Galaxy Ripples when I got off the bus, and felt like jumping out of the window. Oh well, that took up a paragraph, somehow. Summary - no choc for Lent.  Just one final thing - there are ironies that exist that we can't face. When you want to be with someone who wants to be with someone (as in you want to be with [specific] who wants to be with [indefinite but not you]), that's going to be hard, and it's a situation that occurs a lot, I think we have to live with it. Ignore it, fight it, or crumble. I choose a mixture of all 3. If you're in the same situation, it's up to you to decide.  Quote of the day: "They say they follow the Lord's will, Still they'd torture, Still they'd kill, To help a young man reach his prime. They say he's cursed, he's Satan's child, I'm just a boy, Betrayed, defiled, All a young man needs is time... Damn them all! While they run with the pack! They will pay For the scars on my back!"

       OK, my blog has changed name and banner... whether it has changed face is yet to be seen.  Today, I am content to be me, I guess. Although I have struck a resounding problem by my inability to make conversation with  anyone  at CAYO, which is a further testament to the fact that my sociability leaves a little to be desired. Despite this, I am feeling at peace. Not happy, not unhappy. Just... at peace.  My Grade 8 is now 25 days away. I have 25 days of practice left until what is the end of my youth as a trombonist. Post-Grade 8 is when you learn to be a master of the instrument, learning Alto Clef, joining the National Youth Orchestra (NYO), learning to lip-trill... this is my life after GCSE. However content I may be, the question still springs to mind whether I will continue to be alone during this period of my life. I feel this a question only time will answer. Which is a pain, time has never given me a straight answer in the past, I see no reason for it to do so now.  I'm sorry, everyone, I know I'm being a bit whiny at the moment and not particularly fun (if I was ever so in the first place!). I'm in an odd place in my life. I'm confused, very nervous, and very busy. The questions running through my head are ones that need answers, and ones that will have no answer. I want to help people, to know them, but at the moment I can't get close enough to anyone to be of any service. I have to ask that you don't take me too seriously. I don't want to worry anyone.

I DO NOT ENTIRELY WISH TO BE ALONE BECAUSE IT ISN'T FUN BUT I CAN'T BLOODY CONNECT WITH PEOPLE WHICH IS A PAIN IN THE ARSE TO BE QUITE HONEST.  Love, Jon Roskilly

       Up and down day. Swings and roundabouts. Butterflies and hurricanes. Snow and ice.  I'm tired. Not that that's unusual! Seriously, many work for the Jon at the moment... I so suck at all of it, and so it's hard for a mere mortal such as I. And I really need a break, one that won't come until at least the summer. I've got a few months of torture before I can have a proper break... the only people who know the position I'm in I either have no contact with or they're too smug to talk to. I can't cope, to be honest, if you haven't got that from this already.  Major plus side - ordered the 6 tickets for Bill Bailey. June 3rd, come on...  Major downside - being tired means I'm more depressed.  Major downside - I'm still feeling really ill.  Oh well, life continues to be alright. I'm not optimistic like I was a few weeks ago, nothing seems to be good for me just around the corner. But I'm still here. I'm just... Jon. I guess that's the problem.

I'm not able to talk to people, I have to hug myself every couple of seconds and I seem either really rude or really annoying, alternately. Annoying - to Laura, or at least it feels like I am being so, not cause of anything she says or does but how it sounds in my head. Rude - to Olivia at Les Mis, who I really like but don't talk to cause I can't. *cries* I've got one of the most important exams of my life in 1 month. Damndamndamn.  I really can't think of anything to say. I'm tired, I'm ill... just... ever noticed that bad days tend to be mutual?  Quote of the day: "I want to be The first man you remember.

       OK, gotta post quickerly. Gwen wants to get on. I ask you...  Me and Laura went to see School of Rock. If you're new to my blog, the important bit is the "Me and Laura", and the rest of it you can ignore. Seriously, that ruled... I'm sorry, this is me obsessing. I'll talk about the movie a bit... music for it ruled, 9.5 out of 10 and it only dropped half a mark because it said the name "Christina Aguilera". The plot was typical, and a bit dull. But what completely ruled was that during the opening adverts and such, it was only me and Laura in the room. After a while, I think about 6 people came in, but that was it. I've never been in a showing that empty. It actually felt quite good, it was like being alone with Laura... wait, I've got back to that again. Grr *thwaps self*.  Anyway, got to bugger off.

       Oh... I'd swear really violently but I'm trying to stop swearing almost altogether, so, I guess... fiddlesticks.  Um ngh... *cries* I've got far too much work on. I found out today that my Gr.8 trombone exam is... a month tomorrow, so I don't practice until tomorrow, so I've only got 1 month of practice left 'til the exam. What's the word that springs to mind? 'Damn'. There's not too much time 'til Les Mis, either, Apr.15-17, and I'm missing a few practices cause of various thingies. There's the 'damn' again. And then I've got Alice with the SDG, March 23rd; I've got Gigi, March 16-20th; GYWO concert March 27th; CAYO concert, March. 29th; CYB concert, March 15th... STRS Spring Concert, March 25th... how many 'damn's are there in one 'bugger'?  And my life is containing a lot of irony. This is irony that I am not enjoying at all. In fact it's irony that, with everything else the world's piling on me, I could totally do without, but ne'ertheless I'm in the situation where it's cropping up. AGAIN. The phrase "Why do I always do this?" springs to mind. As do hundreds upon hundreds of cursives.  I always manage to have a good side in my situations and I perpetuate this trend; I'm meeting up with Laura tomorrow, if she remembers... which rules more than a bit. I don't know whether it reverses the bad mood I'm currently in, though.  Quote of the day: "I did not live until today... How can I live when we are parted?

       Welcome to Friday, which basically counts as the last day of half term... ah, feck it >_  I need a break of some kind... this week hasn't been entirely a very good break, what with Les Mis, a trombone lesson, Ikea... today I've got to do my papers... tomorrow I've got to go and be beaten at pool... I was going to see Laura today but she wanted to move it to tomorrow and I can't do tomorrow. The word I'm looking for is 'bugger'.  It is totally not fair that some people are allowed to be incredibly cool whereas I have to be sehr dull... before you hammer me with things about how it is fair that statement was not without a touch of comedy, it's not entirely serious. But still, you get what I mean. Marx, Ging, Dan... people who get swarmed around, it's not that they're not all lovely people (cause they all rule) but once in a while it'd be nice for someone to be impressed once in a while, you know? Argh, I'm bitching and being really daft. Shush, Jon. Still love you all.  I don't know, so far I haven't really clicked with Ging. To be honest, I think that he like almost everyone else on the planet finds me very irritating indeed, but I don't know. Meh, he seems cool enough.  Roll on Sunday (Les Mis).

Can I conceal my face for ever more? Pretend I'm not the man I was before? And must my name until I die Be no more than an alibi? Must I lie? How can I ever face my fellow men? How can I ever face myself again? My soul belongs to God, I know, I made that bargain long ago. He gave me hope, when hope was gone, He gave me strength to journey on... Who am I? Who am I? I'm Jean Valjean! And so, Javert, you see it's true, That man bears no more guilt than you... Who am I? 2-4-6-0-1!   Who am I?   from   Les Mis   Love, Jon Roskilly

       There, out in the darkness, A fugitive running, Fallen from God, fallen from grace. God be my witness, I never shall yield Till we come face to face, Till we come face to face. He knows his way in the dark, But mine is the way of the Lord, And those who follow the path of the righteous Will have their reward. And if they fall as Lucipher fell, The flame, the sword!  Stars, in your multitudes, Scarce to be counted, Filling the darkness with order and light, You are the sentinels, silent and sure, Keeping watch in the night, Keeping watch in the night. You know your place in the skies, You hold your course and your aim, And each in their season returns and returns, And is always the same. And if you fall as Lucipher fell, You fall in flame...  And so it has been, And so it is written, On the doorways to paradise, That those who falter, And those who fall, Will pay the price.  Lord, let me find him, That I may see him Safe behind bars, I will never rest till then, This I swear... This I swear by the stars!   Stars   From   Les Mis   Love, Jon Roskilly

       *coughs* Excuse me. THEY'RE BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACK!!!  I phoned Laura woo ^_^. Her voice is nice to hear... hm, phoning her may be seen as a bit blatant but I miiiissed her so I wanted to say hi ^_^. Hm, are you supposed to really sorely miss someone you're not going out with? I don't know, but still, *many hugs to the returned-from-Venice-peoples*.  Still haven't heard the results of the brass band contest... *twiddles thumbs*  Scott and I went to Ikea today with the mum and the Gwen, war funlich. I got a new chair and some brightly coloured spheres. Funfun. I couldn't find me sexy light though, oh well. N'est pas grave. Scott and I had our fun, and that's all that matters.  Anyway, I really can't think of anything to say other than *ultima delight* at the peoples being back.  Quote of the day: "Red, I feel my soul on fire. Black, my world if she's not there.

       I've had a busy day today. Busy has been me.  Brass band contest was the first thing on the list of today's activities. We played well, I played OK, in general it was good. I bought a trombone duet book from the stalls and had a sandwich. We drove back, I went to Les Mis and we did the barricades and such... and I'll tell you something... hugging, holding, and singing to someone is made so much harder when they aren't there. We did A Heart Full of Love as well, and that was fun. I don't know how much physical contact N'omi (Cosette) is going to mind, cause I always envisiged the last note being sung with both singers in each others arms, and it slowly working up from clasping hands to that... I've also got to consult with Susie, who's doing Fantine, how much contact SHE minds for the Docks scene. I've got to molest her somehow, I don't know. What I'm doing at the moment is circling her and eyeing her up, and I touch her a couple of times. I don't know, truth is given to us all in our time, in our turn.  Also had NJAN practice. That was a bit of a waste of time without Tobin, it felt wrong. So instead we went through a few things then phaffed about for the rest of it. Like Tom said, it's like trying to play the drums when you've lost one of the sticks.  Libby hasn't been on, I'm actually enjoying talking to her. She's quite cool, and the fact she's going out with Tobin is actually a plus for me because it means that I don't get that paranoid thing that she thinks I'm hitting on her. Because if she thinks I'm hitting on her she cwaazy. Yeah, she's good looking and all, but she's also Tobin's property.  Stay safe, LFZ.  Quote of the day: "In my life she has burst like the music of angels, The light of the sun. And my life seems to stop as if something is over, And something has scarcely begun."

       OH MY WORD I'VE JUST MET SOMEONE FROM FACEPARTY WHO LIVES DOWN THE ROAD FROM PURITON!!! For those of you that don't know, Puriton is a really tiny place where I spent the first 3 or so years of my life... the irony is immense. Most people I talk about Puriton to think I make it up. Whoa... kinda high now...  Love, Jon Roskilly

       *swears* Alright, blogging faaaar too much!  Just been reading Laura's archives, got back to the post about when we met in town. When it occurs, that's the only GOOD day I've had recently. I've had average days, and a few bad days, but no good ones. That was fun. I'm not just going on about it cause it's Valentine's Day, I promise. Well, maybe I am. I think it's cause she's all in Venice, though, and I'm missing LFZ like nothing else cause they're all so cool... meeting Fi was great too, that would have been a good day if I hadn't forgotten to take my steroids.  ...How can the abscence of 3 people make me feel completely lost?

       *holds head in hands* This day would be great were it not for my gender...  So often I'm driven to shame on account of being a bloke. We're rude most of the time, often we're heartless, almost always we're stupid. A lot of girls I know have bitched about how blokes are stupid to me. Am I supposed to assume I'm excluded? No. I'm a bloke too. Anything said in general about man comes off for everyone, and I believe I'm included in that.  I declare it: boys are NOT stupid. Call me a prick for saying so but there are good ones of us out there. Scott, Buzzy, Brendan, Ging, Tobin, Tom and Sam, Alastair Stanley, Sam Taunton... these aren't average blokes. Maybe the average guy is a git. But spare those who aren't.  Love, Jon Roskilly

       Hello, and welcome to Valentine's Day.  People of all colours and creeds come together to smear today's name, but I'm in favour of today. Sure, it's an opportunity for companies to sell lots of furry cards, but hang 'em. Today is for celebrating love itself, not trying to make people be extra-nice to each other for a day. Can you imagine me getting MORE gooey on one day of the year? Today is one of my favourite days, because I believe in love. Being single makes it easier for me to like it.  Despite not thinking this is a day for special tokens of love or adoration I'm going to do one of those sickening valentine's messages. These are the people I'm thinking of especially today.     Laura  - Guess why? For the less intelligent of you I'm kind of obsessed with her, and also worried cause she's all not here and everything.    Zoe  - Probably cause I love her in a way I'm not sure how to describe. She's not like a sister (although to her I'm like a lillebror, apparently) but she's not like I'm... y'know... in love with her. It's kind of odd. But she's irreplaceable.    Lisa  - I really don't know her, and somehow that means I'm thinking about her.    Fi  - Cause she's fairly close despite knowing her for a ridiculously small amount of time. This thought also goes to Ging for being with her, hope that goes well!    Nikky + her boyfriend  - Nikky's just really cool, and so for that reason I'm kind of hoping nothing goes wrong ever there.    Sam/Maya/The Devil  - Cause I haven't talked to her for ages, and I tend to feel I've been a bit of a git to her...    Libby + Tobin  - They're just really sweet...    Sarah  - Cause she's kind of got a thing for me, and sometimes I think I'm a bit too grown-up with her.    Sally Grant  - She cool.    Rachel Foxwell  - I'd do anything to protect her voice, cause it rules the earth.    Mel  - Scott's kind of obsessed with her, and as such she gets a place in my thoughts.    The girls - Suz and Gwen  - Cause I looove them, even though most of the time they piss me off.    The group - Adam, Buzzy, Marx, Pete, Scott, Stanners  - I looove them, cause they rule.     Sorry if I've missed you out and you were expecting to be on there. I'm thinking about eeeveryone really, but those are the people my mind is most focused on. Love yas.  Quote of the day; "I'll buy you diamond rings, my friend, If it makes you feel alright. I'd get you anything, my friend, If it makes you feel alright. Cause I don't care too much for money, Cause money can't buy me love."  From the Beatles'   Can't Buy Me Love   Love, Jon Roskilly

       In the style of people of my hair colour... aren't funerals depressing?  Anyway, back from school early, trying to do something productive with my time. Blogging doesn't QUITE fit, but ne'er mind. Oh, but something's made me kind of grinny and also kind of worried. Some people will know what I mean, I guess.  BBC Radio 4 is commisioning authors to think of a story behind items in a "lost/found" thing in a newspaper. To me, that seems a bit of a waste of money. If you want random things with attempted plot lines that don't work, why not try reading some Sylvia Plath?  And there's a magazine on Suz's floor saying "Gareth said "I Love You"... then dumped me" as a quote from Jordan. My reaction? ...How cool would it be to say that you DUMPED Jordan? ^_^ Personally I wouldn't think twice. She may look good and all that, but I'm not really attracted to her cause she has the intelligence of a radish with breast implants.  *sighs* Laura is cool... it's kind of odd for me to say that... if you're new to my blog, you may not understand it, but I doubt that very much, so my old readers (hi Scott!) will understand it. Indeed. Nah, she's just cool. Everytime I read her blog it emanates coolness, and such. You know what I mean... pah, I don't really know what I mean, so how are you supposed to? To be honest, I don't know who "you" is... the reader? Hello, reader! Wait, I already did that one up there...  ...*hums* Ever got the urge to do something you know you're going to get rejected for? Rhetorical. Don't send me an email about that question, Sarah.  Quote of the day: "I'd give it all for a heart, If I were a king I would give away my kingdom. Treasures and crowns wouldn't mean a thing, If I only had a heart..."  From Sonata Arctica's   Kingdom for a Heart   Love, Jon Roskilly

       Ok, just to point out (cause wrong end of the stick was acquired, it seems) I like not being depressed, what I don't like is being kind of not-quite-depressed. But the comment was one more of sarcasm than anything else. Never mind, eh?  As Laura pointed out on her blog, it's 5 days 'til the thingy to Venice takes place. It's 5 days until I have to be really worried about a flight... half of the emotional ties I have'll be on it... meep, it's nicht so fun. Possibility of anything going wrong = minimal. Jon worrying factor = through the roof. Laura, Fi, Zoe, others... don't die... >_  Had the Les Mis practice today, actuellement, while I remember. It was pretty cool, cause we saw Valjean (Phil) hold an A for about 3 bars. Which makes him a git for being able to but he's pretty amazing at his high range. He doesn't really have anything low-wise though, so bwahaha. My range surpasses his, he's just higher. Git. But we did the wedding scene, where I have to amble a waltz with Cosette (Naomi), who is 5'2". So, waltzing with an 8" difference. Woohoo. No, but Naomi's pretty cool, and she's as bad as I am at waltzing so we kind of go alright there. It's quite fun doing t'old waltz with my wife. Everyone appeared to be shocked that I knew my lines for the wedding. I pointed out that we had done it once before, and that meant that I pretty much knew everyone's lines for that bit cause I'm good at picking things up. And not smug about it. Noo... we also did A Heart Full of Love, which is faster than I thought, but quite nice, and really cool to hear it working. I guess I use 'working' loosely, the biggest problem being that Naomi's lack of range means I have to do a falsetto Bb instead of her going to the one an octave above that. Which is a bit of an argh, I guess. But still, Eponine (Olivia) is a pretty fantastic singer, so looking forward to Wednesday when we do A Little Fall of Rain. It's a very sad song but it's a nice song. i_i.  Fi's not bloggèd for a bit... lame. Blog, Fi, blog! Blog! Fi, blogggg!!!!!  Anyway, must stop rambling. Ciao!  Quote of the day: "Then it's true... then... I'm right... Jean Valjean was my saviour that night! As for you... take this too! God, forgive us the things that we do! Come, my love, come, Cosette, This day's blessings are not over yet...!"  From   The Wedding   from   Les Mis   Love, Jon Roskilly

       Eugh, feeling insecure, feeling tired, feeling cold. Feeling worthless. Ever got that?  Fi's not been on, she's at a party. Laura's been on, she's introduced me to Ging who is more talented than me, and 'prettier' than me, so I'm kind of feeling insecure there. Ohh *cries* I'm not in a good mood.  I also got hacked which has kind of made me buggered emotion-wise.  I've been given a guilt trip for not wanting to hurt someone.  Please help me. I'm not good at this.

       I really want to just kind of shout at the moment. I'm not feeling very good just at this precise moment.  You know how sometimes you think that you're nice as a person? Now isn't one of those times for me.  I'm tired, I feel ill, and I'm not keen on myself.  And I can't meet up with Laura tomorrow but that's more a different topic, it's not directly involved in me feeling awful.  Quote of the day: "When they've tortured and scared you For 20 odd years.

       OK, you have no idea how long I've spent looking for this upside today! I only just got it. Here goes.  I kind of over-reacted to a situation that did get over-complicated. Basically, the situation I'm in is that I have 2 new, wonderful friends, both of which are really friendly, really caring, really amazing and both really good looking but we'll scrub round that one for the time being. The situation I've put myself into aside, what am I faced with? I went from not knowing the 2 of them and being miserable, to knowing the 2 of them and being happy (before I rogered myself!). Coincidence? Not very likely. They're friends that very quickly, somehow, have touched me very deeply, and both in a very positive way. I've never felt so close to anyone in such a short space of time (save Scott, but you all know how that's continuing), and then 2 people have come along at once. *_*. They're friends I can't afford to lose. If, in a couple of months, either feel like they want anything more (which is unlikely, let's face it) then... I don't know how I'll react then, but any man would be the luckiest man on Earth to have either of them. And I've got both of them as friends.  Quote of the day: "Just hold me now, and let it be.

       "Made a note in my diary on the way here. Simply says 'Bugger.'"  *sighs* Welcome to the complex world of... Mr. A, apparently. A month ago everything looked so simple, but here I am again. If it doesn't matter to be asked... why is it that every turn for me is over complicated? I don't think it's fair, it's so easy for people who are complete bastards but when it comes down to it, I try and be nice, and I get into things like this that I can't handle. It's not only annoying beyond belief, it's so depressing that I might as well go and destroy things.  Other than that, I'm still ill, and today's been alright, I guess.

Tomorrow, my situation since August of 2003 may change. Tomorrow, I may lose not only one friend. Tomorrow, I may be happy or sad. Tomorrow, I may decide to do nothing. Tomorrow, I might ask a question I've asked only twice before. To be honest, I'm terrified. And, to be honest, I don't know if I can do it.  Love, Jon Roskilly

       OK, already late for CYB so this has to be really quick!  Actually went INTO Boots today to try and find Laura. Didn't find her, didn't know where to look or if she was even THERE, but I'm proud of myself for looking.  Have to make a very important decision about my life soon, or ask questions to nullify the confusion I'm in. There are certain possibilities from something I've been asked, and I don't want all but one of the possibilities to exist. Bugger.  I've been very ill today.  Talked to Fi a lot at Zoe's party. Zoe's party was good apart from me only getting an hour's sleep. Meh, that's what you get if you sleep next to a fish tank with a light in it.  Taken a lot of pics.  Got into town 10 minutes too late to pick up my photo CD from Klick. Bugger.  Quote of the day: "Fuck."  From   The Sleepy Cat Song   Love, Jon Roskilly

       Let me save you.  I'm blogging from Suz's computer at the moment, so I'll have to remember to log out. Anyway, why am I blogging from here, and not being at school? Well... my voice is paralysed. Yes, peoples, with the Pates concert tomorrow, my voice has become paralysed. Hello Strepsils. I mean... seriously... fargh...  I'm also not feeling very well, to be honest. It's possible I've caught a minor version of Spanish fever - this sucks, especially because, as a lot of you will know, I don't like Spain. If you didn't know that, you probably think I'm a racist now. In actuality I have nothing wrong with the people. Just the accent, the language, the flag, the music, the way of life etc.  Les Mis, despite the fact my voice was deteriorating, was actually pretty cool yesterday. Got on better with everyone on the whole, and in fact made contact with some of the littler people, which was nice, because usually they just stand about 25 metres away. Got on alright with N'omi, there's not a lot to say on that matter, got on well with Joe, Barley, Jack, Phil, Josie, Christine and Liv. Although I'm still scared of Liv. She sat on my lap, and if you know anything about me then you'll know that's enough to make me run for the hills. Oh, and Ig, I didn't beat Josie up with a stick. I asked her and she said I didn't.  Oh, CAYO-wise, got on really well with Jasmin and Adele over the Saturday rehearsals and the bowling, so that was nice. It was better than trying to talk to Andy by going through Beccay who still terrifies me. I would have preferred if Jazz hadn't started telling people that I was in love with Adele, though. That's just... wrong...  Anyway, pretty tired, and sorry to give you this picture but I'm in a towel. I'm off to get dressed.  Quote of the day: "Her name was Eponine.

       Ahh, the Concierto de Aranjuez... if music be the food of love, Rodriguez's guitar concerto is the main course. Just let the music flow over your body...  Anyway, as I absent-mindedly blog while listening to Rodriguez's greatest work, I'll say something about how things have gone since Tuesday.  Well, Grade 8 was good, kinda. Everything went well, some things (Mahler, aural, sight reading) went very well indeed, some went alright but went a bit wrong once or twice (both Serocki movements, scales). Some things, as usual with me, went absolutely abysmally (chromatics, arpeggios, diminished + dominant 7ths). But still, 100% sure I passed, 96% sure I got enough marks for a merit. On whether I got the distinction I so yearn for... not sure, my childs. But, thanks more than a lot for lots of support ye all gave me - for example, Scott arranged a "Hooré for Jon" session at 2:40 PM, Tom managed to remember to say "Come on Jon!" at 2:40 in his lesson, Sam said "GOOD LUCK ^^" which was incredibly nice to read... just, thankee lots of people *hugs everyone who he knows who was supportive*.  Beginning to get a lot of the tickets through for Les Mis. The days stand as follows, at the moment... Thursday - Libby, Tobin, Laura, Fi, Nikky, Zoe Friday - Roskilly family (- Anthony)+ Phil, Sarah and her Nan (possibly, if I remember to tell her the number) Saturday - Grant family, Scott, Stanners, Buzzy, Pete, Curtis, Mel If you asked me to get you a ticket, and you don't see your name there, then I have forgotten. Sowwy, just club me to death with a sparrow and I'll g... don't club me quite to death, just enough to make a point, then I'll get you a ticket.  Wanted to keep this a little quiet so as to surprise some people who come to the Pates Rock Concert, but I might as well publicise it seeing as though everyone seems to know - I'm singing for Shez's band in the PRC. Should be pretty cool, I get to do 'Living on A Prayer' and 'Song 2'. There are 4 others but those are my favs out of what we're doing, I reckon. Still, funfun. Shez, Jo, Nick and Segye all rule, so it's nice playing with 'em. By the way, I have met them and played with them, we had a rehearsal aprés l'école aujord'hui. So ha. Anyway, tho, yeah. Shez has long hair *_*. Oh, and I need to remember on Sunday not to keep calling Jo short. She's not THAT short, it's just something I say.  Anyway, onto other things. Les Mis, namely. On Wednesday, we went through the ball scene. It's an uncomfortable scene to do, especially for Naomi (Cosette). Why, I hear you ask? Well, I should hear you ask, anyway. Basically, it's a scene in which she has no singing or acting part, but cannot dance with a partner in the background. So... pretty much what she has to do is stand behind me ish and look uncomfortable. Which, I have to say, makes my part feel uncomfortable. I hasten to add that this isn't her fault, more it is mine for a lack of ability to be self-involved. Anyway, it's a good scene for Marius apart from that. He gets to thwack Monsieur Thenardier. Or Joe, to use his other name. We've got a photo shoot on Sunday, starting at 2:30 PM. Eep. I don't look good in ph... I don't look good.  Argh, GYWO have annoyed me for the second time on a quite un-musical matter. I haven't been to 3 rehearsals on the trot because of concerts. Granted, that's perhaps unacceptable, and I admit to that one. BUT, and this is the crowning peice of such-and-such, they arranged an extra rehearsal (I state again EXTRA, there was not supposed to be one) next week, and told me TODAY, when I had already secured my services with Shez for the PRC. So I told them I couldn't make it. I was replied to with a rather stormy email saying I have to "improve next term". Granted 3 weeks isn't good, but the 4th is THEIR FAULT, so they can go roger themselves with something.  Oh, I'm not going to Torquay tomorrow, either. However, this one, despite the very short notice, doesn't mind me, and I actually consider this one to be of good sense. My literal first playing of the music would be in the actual contest performance. Impractical. So I'm not going to Torquay, and I AM going to both CAYO rehearsals tomorrow. So, that should please them. Yay.  Thinking along the CAYO line, have been chatting to Jasmin on MSN a bit, she's been really nice (yay!) and is probably going to come over and talk to me tomorrow. This could possibly end the spell of me having either no-one at all to talk to, or having to talk to Daniel, the amazing annoying trombonist. If Sian's there tomorrow I might see if I can talk to her too, cause we get on usually really quite well,  so that'd be nice. Yeah... I seem to get on well with female clarinet players. Oh well.  We're actually almost at the end of the Spring term, and almost at the end of this term's hecticness. HOWEVER!!!, next term we get into GCSE revision, then actually into GCSEs, and then I've got YMM, Work Experience, 6th Form Induction Week, and the GYWO tour. Let me entertain you. AND on top of that I've still got to juggle having a one-way love life. Eek.  Quote of the day:  "We've got to hold on to what we've got 'Cause it don't make a difference If we make it or not. We've got each other, and that's a lot For love - we'll give it a shot..."  From Bon Jovi's   Living on a Prayer   Love, Jon Roskilly

       Hewo world.  Alice went OK, I really don't feel like going into details, but it was goodish.  Wouldn't really be blogging if I didn't see this on Sam's blog: "Oh, and you know what? It rained. But that doesn't matter, cos it means that the plants will grow." *sings* And rain will make the flowers grow. It's a line from A Little Fall of Rain. Not that Sam knows that, in fact I'm sure she doesn't, being slightly too sensible to get into musicals like Scott and I. But yeah, I smirked. Smirkage.  Oh, Grade 8 is.... tomorrow ARGH ARGH ACK ARGH. N-e-r-v-o-u-s now. List of things YOU MUST DO and MUST NOT DO tomorrow...  MUST DO     Cross your middle finger over your index finger at 14:40   Carry a horse-shoe around   Find a 4-leaved clover   Wish me luck   Be supportive in a mental way, even though you're not with me. A few "come ons" would be nice, thankyou      MUST NOT DO     Cross fingers ON BOTH HANDS   Walk under a ladder   Let a black cat cross your path   Break your foot/arm/neck etc.   Forget what the time is at 2:40 PM   Have any kind of spilling or crashing accident   Step on the cracks in paving slabs, or the joins between slabs   Carry a pentagram. Come on, goths, you can do it for me   Sing anything by a band I don't like, because generally if I don't like them it's very bad luck to sing songs by them. My taste is final   Sing/Play With or Without You/Working Class Hero in the wrong key, or just wrong     *wishes self good luck* Love you all, will post again tomorrow.

       I don't know whether the word is "Bugger" or "Chortle".  Explanation of the above statement will come now. How would you define 'fancying' someone? Is it simply being happy around someone, is it thinking about them all the time, or is it simply that if they asked you you'd go out with them? Well, although I may not have the answer, I know what I mean by fancying someone, and it's a particular feeling I get. Anyway, thinking about about 3 people all the time. Hooray for me. Well, no. It's not actually that fun, it's quite guilt-inducing. However, it's so me-like I have to laugh about it.  Anyway, can't think of much else to write.  Quote of the day: " Every day we'll remember that night, And the vow that we made. A heart full of love  (She was never mine to keep),  A heart full of you, The words are old, but always true  (She is youthful, she is free).  Cosette, Cosette...  (Love is the garden of the young)  I saw you waiting, and I knew...   Waiting for you, At your feet.  (Let it be.)  At your call  (Let it be.)   For it isn't a dream,   (A heart full of love,)   Not a dream after all.   (This I give you this day.)"

       And so you find me at basically the end of an exhausting week. Feelings? Well...     Gigi went alright, got on OK with peoples and got £90 for some decent group playing. w00t, I guess.   Knackered.   My throat is hurting like mad, and my stomach is playing up for some reason.   My Grade 8 is on Wednesday. Oh dear.   HAVEN'T been phoned by Naomi, despite a question over it earlier in the week, when it was Sarah. I suppose that's not too different. Haven't talked to the wee Naomi a lot though.   Have Les Mis tomorrow, maybe starting at 12/1. Yay.   Have finished blog run, including Sam's. Mood = ....not entirely sure, but must remember never to dive too deep into Sam's blog.   Actually quite cold, now. Heating = not so great.   Knackered. Needed saying again.   Suddenly missing Zoe. Sorry, not sure about that one, something just clicked saying "haven't seen her in a while." Meep.   Actually, suddenly missing pretty much everyone I know. w00t.   Ordered a CD today. Hoorah!   Going to get some more food in a minute.   Realised I actually am getting breasts. Must exercise more. In conjunction, my walk feels odd. Not sure about that one, to be honest.

        Excellency, a moment. I think this goes to the heart of the matter.   It surely does.   I cannot say he is an honest man; I know him little. But in all justice, a claim this weighty cannot be argued by a farmer. I pray you sir, stop here: send him home and let him come again with a lawyer...   Now look you, Mr. Hale -    Your honour, I have signed 72 death warrants. I am a minister of the Lord, and I may not take a life without there be a proof so immaculate that no slightest qualm of conscience may doubt it.   Mr. Hale, you surely do not doubt my justice!   I have this morning signed away the soul of Rebecca Nurse, your honour. I'll not conceal it; my hand shakes yet as with a wound! I pray you sir,  THIS  argument let lawyers present to you!   Anyway, away from the world of Arthur Miller's Crucible, we enter the last night of sanity before a week of non blog. I wasn't expecting to be able to blog tonight, actuellement. Anyway, yeah, kinda pointless when I said all I needed to in my last one... peace, peoples.  Love, Jon Roskilly

       Hello le terre, I have no words, you come from God, you are a saint. Something like that, anyway.  In good cheer! Les Mis went pretty well (although I wanted to do the second act so I could show off my writing-the-letter-in-Les-Mis skills, and we only did Act 1 >_  Still on Les Mis subject, but I had to swap paragraphs so people know what I'm saying. Anyway, Susie (Fantine) and I (Bamatbois) spent about 20 minutes at least working out what we're doing at the Docks scene. So, we've gone from me basically molesting her to me getting slapped and kicked. Hoorah. Nah, it seems to work. I had a criticism in that I was singing too fast... one of the first criticisms I've had, apart from "Don't be too violent in Empty Chairs". But still, hoorah. Got a week 'til it comes round again though... *counts hours*  Ohohoh, N'omi (Cosette) phoned me ^_^. Apparently she phoned last night too, but I was out at John Y's memorial. She phoned when I was asleep, and then I had a shower and phoned her back. About half an hour conversation ^_^. That were fun, doesn't happen very often.  Anyways, yes... non-Les Mis related things... Got CYB concert tomorrow and then Gigi till Saturday, so I'm a bit, as the Jamie Oliver people say, chocka. Seriously, I'll be lucky if I blog once between Monday and Friday during next week. Can't fit conversation into hectic schedule. I still love you all though.

       Hooré for Saturday. Or not.  It hailed when I was doing my papers. Hoo-bloody-ray. I was coooold. Very cold. Yuck, evil precipitation must be shot (probably by Fi who apparently knows a lot about guns, oddly enough).  I've got John Y's memorial service tonight, and I just want to say that this is almost certainly the last thing I'm doing for St. Mary's Choir. The reception I got last night was one word - "Ah." from Frank and a number of cold looks. Well, thanks St. Mary's, if I want a warmer reception, I'll jump in the fridge.  I'm in a perpetual state of slowed-time, as I wait for tomorrow and the Les Mis rehearsal. I love it. Seriously... let it come quickly and then last for days. Love.  Anyways, I'm going to stop now, hopefully will be OK tonight...  Quote of the day: "And day by day this pathway seeks, Since her silent to love it.

       I've only got 6 mins left on this computer, and as I probably won't be on for a couple of days, I will break into song. Love you all.  There's a greif that can't be spoken. There's a pain, goes on and on... Empty chairs at empty tables, Now my friends are dead and gone.  Here they talked on revolution. Here, it was, they lit the flame. Here they sang about tomorrow, But tomorrow never came.  From the table in the corner They could see a world reborn. And they rose, with voices ringing. And I can hear them now, The very words that they had sung Become their last communion On the lonely barricade, At dawn.  Oh, my friends, my friends, forgive me That I live and you are gone, There's a greif that can't be spoken, There's a pain goes on and on...  Phantom faces at the window, Phantom shadows on the floor, Empty chairs at empty tables, Where my friends will meet no more...  Oh, my friends, my friends.... Don't ask me What your sacrifice was for! Empty chairs at empty tables, Where my friends will sing no more.   Empty Chairs at Empty Tables   from   Les Misérables   Love, Jon Roskilly

       Hello, tout le monde.  My internet's broke atm, so no MSN for me until we can fix it. That may be a week, maybe 2... this is me at the library. Hello library! Anyway, yes, sorry, won't be on MSN, which is more than bad, 'cause I can't talk to LFZN or anyone else, so... lame.  The Les Mis rehearsal on Wednesday ruled, and I'm just about counting the hours until the Sunday rehearsal. I think this is one of these situations where I'd appreciate time speeding up just a little. But yes, very much looking forward to it. It's not just the music, I really, genuinely like pretty much everyone there. Admitedly Christine (Mme. T)scares me a little, but still... Naomi, Liv, Jack, Phil, Christine, Mike, Bali, Rhiannon, and all the people I don't know the names of, you all rule, and none of you read my blog. Hoorah!  12 days 'til my Grade 8.  Quote of the day: "It's you who must forgive a thoughtless fool, It's you who must forgive a thankless man... It's thanks to you that I am living, And again I lay down my life at your feet.

       Irritated.  Les Mis went awfully - the barricade took ages because we just kept recapping, and recapping, and being told we were shit. I couldn't sing or act (no change there, then) for some reason, and I wasn't feeling well, so not pleased with that in all entirety. Oh well.  Also, phoned Fi, for someone to talk to - my working was thus; Too late to phone Lawa at half 9. Nikky is busy, apparently, and it's too late to phone her. Fi is usually up 'til about 10:30. So I phoned her, and said "Hi, is Fiiii there please?". The reply? "Chunk. Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeee" Thankyou, someone who probably wasn't Fi. This is me not being incredibly pleased... once again, oh well. I assume it was not workable it was me. If it was, then... whoops, Jon's buggered up somehow.  As usual, there's an upside - talked to Naomi (Cosette) a bit, and she seemed nice, and she's getting a lot more confident at physical acting, and it's just nice to be able to meet someone. She's nae on MSN, but still, she asked if I had a mobile. Damn you, techno-age. GIVE ME A MOBILE!!! ACTUALLY, DON'T! PLEASE! I'D LOSE IT AGAIN!  Love, Jon Roskilly

       I'm off to Les Mis soon, we're running all of Act 2, just thought I'd post quickerly before I head off.  Liv went down a lot in my coolth rankings yesterday by saying that, I quote, "All men are nobs". This really offends me, I'm sorry, I know it's a general statement that a lot of people say but it does. Why, I hear you ask? Well... I tend to regard myself as fairly a-typical as a man, in that I don't have girlfriends for s... I don't have girlfriends, I think using my head rather than my lower region and I enjoy doing Les Mis and things like it more than hitting a piece of leather round a field (not to say I don't like football, I do, but I prefer performing). In all necessities, I am a heterosexual man - I like women in that way, I have a penis, my chromosome alignment is XY, and I like Led Zepplin. But in personality terms I am neither a typical man, nor a typical woman. I am me. So I think is one of those situations where I'm being over-the-top, perhaps a little snobby in my dislike of Liv's comment. It continues to offend me, though.  That took me too long, and I have to go about now. Sorry, peoples, I'm in a raaaage. Nah, I'm not, I'm not too bad actually. Off to Les Mis. Yay.  Quote of the day: "Under the wide and starry sky, Dig the grave and let me lie; Glad did I live and gladly die, And I laid me down with a will.

       Okies! I cheated on the chocolate thing. Apparently, as it's a Sunday, and I'm doing it for Lent, it actually isn't cheating! Apparently, you can break your vow on Sundays! So I've done one Sunday and that's it, hopefully... I need to get as much chocolate eating in as I can, though, for the rest of the day, so that I can sustain myself. Jon's going to get faaat. I'm also off to Aroma, tomorrow, with the peoples, which is trés cool.  Actually, I'm feeling so much better now it's unbelievable. I know I have no chance with either of the girls I li(many is)ke, no chance at all (why throw your lives away?), but they're both cool, and at the moment I feel... kind of uplifted in a really weird way. I'm happy because I'm screwed. Not in the American Pie way. I think the mood change might be in the amount of cleaning my room has had (so much Kudos to ma mère for basically clearing out my whole room!) and so the amount of things I'm allergic to in my room has gone down fairly spectacularly. Possibly that's good for my mental state. I'm sleeping a lot better, anyway.  Les Mis went über-well today, apart from apparently the position Olivia and I are in for A Little Fall of Rain is uncomfortable for her, so we're going to try to work out how to do it proper on Tuesday. The thought pops in that me looking forward to hugging her about 4 times while we try and sort it out is INCREDIBLY unprofessional, but I don't mind that too much. I'm not a professional, so I guess people shouldn't expect me to be like one... eugh, emotions suck. Although, what rules is that I got Olivia's MSN account, so I can find out increasing amounts about her. I know little but like much. Which seems unworkable.  It's my last week of sanity next week before I get plunged into a 2-week spell of constant performance. Expect me to be very, very, untalkative and VERYVERYVERY stressed from the 15th of March until at least the 1st of April. Sorry, I can't help what I'm doing.  Inset day tomorrow. Yay!

       Can't really think of anything to blog about! Sorry,  peoples, just not very interesting at the moment. Most important thing of the day by far was seeing Phil and Christina in town. That was cool. It's a pity I was taking Arturo (Tom's Spaniard who is actually quite cool) to Sam, or I'd have talked to them for longer if they'd have let me. They're both cool... Phil's growing a beard for Les Mis ^_^ How cool.  Oh, I also went to Toby's, where we have so far composed 45 seconds of a brass band piece. It's really cool, it starts using chords based on the dorian on A, and then after a held note goes in a really cool Salsa thing. We've called it Salsa Del Charlton Kings, and after we've finished it (in perhaps a couple of months) we'll see if we can do it with CYB. Ruling.  And I'm talking to Laura ^_^. And Amy (Dorset woman) ^_^. Haven't talked to Laura in a while, though, so yay for her being on.  Quote of the day: "There's no time for us, There's no place for us.

       Okies, I was ill today, so I had a day off... which was nice, I guess. Actually, the break's done very little for my health but seemingly wonders for my mental state... the Tobin and Libby pairing have both been really nice, Scott phoned to see how I was... people are nice. I'm still confused and everything... but by tomorrow... I think the question is how I'm going to be feeling tomorrow. I'm fine now, but will that last? Hell no, but it's nice to be not unhappy once every couple of weeks.  I hate not eating chocolate! Seriously. I have £1.50, which would buy a 100g bar of Galaxy and a Galaxy Ripple. There's a pack of Mini Eggs downstairs. Ohoh, but I have found what seem to be a decent replacement - Mont Blancs. They're vanilla-type biscuits, and they're tasty. Slightly bland, but that's as a result of them being Italian (for some reason the Italians seem to not like strong flavours, possibly why they invented most types of pasta). But yes, a possible solution to the problem.  My trombone practice didn't, in all actuality, go brilliantly, but it's not too bad... I don't know. I'm going to get a distinction, honest... I won't be satisfied with anything else. I WILL get a distinction.  Haven't talked to Laura or Fi tonight, or Nikky (though talking to Nikky 2 nights in a row is an immense rarity, it seems). I'm sleepy, ill... and yes, I'm feeling alone, but the world's not too bad.

       Ever heard of the term "vicious circle"? Right, well, if you haven't you have now, and if you have then you... have, so well done, have an omlette *gives virtual omlette*. In the case of my blog, the vicious circle is only self-explanatory if you happen to be me. Around 6 billion people have the privelidge of this not being true. So, read on, Macduff...  I don't like being unhappy. Even moreso, I don't like making people unhappy by telling them that I'm unhappy, or by making people feel responsible for my mental state (which is deteriorating, mostly as a result of illness and over-work). And it is because of this I feel guilty for posting depressed-sounding posts on here. This sparks a further depression, which puts me into a cycle I cannot escape. I guess, for me, talking things through is not an option, because it furthers the problems. I hate sounding 'whiny', or in general, I hate complaining. I prefer to be optimistic... I guess sometimes it's hard.  I got the trombone score for Gigi (musical I'm getting £90 for playing in) today... it's handwritten >_ any  of the practices though... perhaps a downside?  Oh, and I found out that what is a short-term goal for me, getting into the National Youth Orchestra, would mean I'd have to leave NJAN, in all probability, because they meet over 2-week periods at Christmas, Easter, and in the summer. I think the word that comes to mind is "bugger".  This is going to further the cycle but I'm still feeling alone and confused. The major problem is it's not just one person who sparks my confusion. This makes me feel worse. And... I'm still ill.  Quote of the day: "When your goodnights have been said, And you are lying in bed, With the covers pulled up tight, And though you count every sheep, You get the feeling that sleep Is gonna stay away tonight.

       Right, this is mostly to move on because yesterday's post was depressing. Partly because I'm depressed, but we shall let that one allein.  I'm on steroids and anti-histemenes (sp?) at the same time. Result? I'm really tired, but really high. This leaves for slightly blurred speech, not feeling well, and not having a good attention span. Look, it's not a good combination, don't get on the wrong side of me at the moment, please... I can hardly cope as it is...  Basically... eeeeeeeeeeeep...

       And this is me on the Free dress day at school. What am I wearing, on this day of choice? A suit, obviously. I mean, duh.  Anyhow, Scott's back, and we give him a big welcome for being so. Because he's back and no longer in France. And he got me "Die Welt" - the German newspaper ^_^. Thanks trés viel, Scott. Oh, and he got Les Misérables, the current French edition of... c'est trés cool, and they put a version of Empty Chairs into it yay.  Oddly enough I texted Becky and Laura this morning, for the sole reason of saying "good morning". I like the ability to say good morning to people. 'Tis fun. Haven't talked to Laura for a couple of days. Sure, it's irritating for me, but still, I'm not dying yet. Maybe after another few days :p.  I've been practicing the 2 Bourrées from Bach's Cello Suites as arranged for trombone, and that's kinda mad... they're really, really... just odd, really. Fast, weird intervals, weird slide positions... mad. They're nice enough to hear but to play they're a bit of a git.  I'm in anticipation of something I don't know again, I guess. Oh well, anticipation/fear isn't the worst feeling ever. It contends but it's not quite the worst.  Quote of the day: "Da da da, Dum da da, Da diddly da da da."

Je croyais l'avoir perdu a tout jamais, Et voila, qu'Eponine se transformer en bonne fée. Le bon dieux, quelquefois, est un grand magicien, Père Noël égarré vennant au mois de juin. Et la vie, soudain est en éclaire Me cravache un cour quand la mort, M'habitait hier encore.  I also might try and get Liv to learn Ce N'est Rien in time for the reunion.  Love, Jon Roskilly

       I'm crying so much from reading the lyrics to A Little Fall of Rain in French - Ce N'est Rien. It's just so amazingly beautiful and so sweet. A bit from it is going to be my quote for tomorrow. It's so upsetting... it might be that I'm missing Liv and the rest of the Les Mis cast a hell of a lot but it's just so amazingly beautiful in French... I need a hug...  Quote for tomorrow (what?): "Ce n'est que moi qui pars, vous restez là Et comme à la noce, je serai absente Voilà sa lettre, c'est mon cadeau Quelques mois à l'avance." (to the tune of "the rain that brings you here is heaven blessed etc.")  From   Ce N'est Rien   from   Les Misérables   Love, Jon Roskilly

       I seem to have lost all my commenters... actually, let's be honest, the times I had 10 or so comments were, in general, cause Sarah forgot to say things and just recommented a few times. Well done Sarah. Anyhow, yeah, that wasn't anything to read into, it was a bit of a blunt statement.  Becky and I are currently having a kind of email rally, which is good. Keeping in touch kinda. It's good because I hate to lose touch with people, and I got on with her really well at the Les Mis aftershow deeley, so funfun.  Women problems, as per usual. C'est la vie. I don't quite take them in my stride but it's so common for me now that it's hardly a huge problem (women liking me is uncommon but me liking them is just a little more than ordinary). You learn to deal with things.  Course, there's the Carmina performance tonight and then IT'S OVEEEEEEER! Woot. I hate Carmina, hate hate hate. I hate the fact that we're doing the 2 piano + percussion version, I hate the fact that we don't have a fully trained choir, I hate the fact that the female soloist has a bad throat, I hate the fact that the baritone soloist sounds like he's been jump-started.... gah, and I hate the fact it's out of my range for most of it. So glad it's over after tonight!  Strange thing that's happened while Scott's been away, I've been getting on better with Marx, Stanners and sometimes Adam (he's a bit tempramental, in that some times he mutters to Joe that he'd like to kill me, but he's alright). But yeah. Anyway..  Si je serai tout seul, m'aiderai tu? Please, French scholars, tell me if that's right. I've been thinking about that, it doesn't seem to make logical sense but I think it's what it'd be.  Oh, and I got Silence yesterday. Yay! So, that's 3 of the 4 SA albums I have. Takatalvi is, I think, a best of type one...  Quote of the day: "While you are sleeping, I steal your earring. I light you one candle, This anger I handle. They said I won't find you, But now, I'm beside you, Lost, or you're taken, You should now by now that you're alone."

       Hello there, posting in the ol' school. GYO audition was yesterday - that was pretty cool. What was said to me as I left was "We've got a vacancy NOW if you're interested?". Confidence boost for me. I also got someone's number - a woman - but this isn't one of those "I got someone's number" things really. She seemed nice enough. I managed to waste absolutely all of my credit on my new phone (once again, thanks Shez) talking to her - I didn't realise phone calls costed that much! It was like a 20 minute call, which isn't much, and it cost me about £8. EEP. Note to self - don't be an idiot in future.  There's not a lot to do atm. The group, as it stands, won't let me join in their D+D board game, so I'm here in the music room playing on the piano, discovering how bad I actually am and blogging. Isn't that good? Anyway, though, missing Scott. We'd do Anthem and such if he was here. Thinking of that, I'm going to play that once I've finished this post, it's in my head now.  Lawa seems angry/sad, and either/or is bad, paranoia of course is setting in that it's a direct result of me in some way... um... *hugs Lawa* This is me hoping that I haven't been a wanker (ie. I haven't been me) and this has little to do with me. Knowing me the chances of that are slim. Um... sh...  Happy birthday to: Sarah for yesterday, Seb and Sam Taunton for today.  Anyhow, I'm going to go and pianise, I'll be on the ol' MSN from 5-7, hopefully.  Quote of the day: "And you ask me why I love her Through wars, death, and despair? She is the constant, We who don't care."  From   Anthem   from   Chess   Love, Jon Roskilly

       This is me saying things! Woo for words. In English.  Anyway, it's occured that the few times that women have got physically close to me (grand total of 3 people, Becky, Beccay, and Sam) that the most common action they've done is the single finger vertically pressed against my lips. In fact, it's not simply these 3 special people who have done this - other people have done the same action. I think it's because I tell jokes such as the one below.  Anyway, I'm quite happy today, I've got a lot of mobile numbers off people, and despite feeling a bit of a slut that almost all of them are women I'm happy to have got the ability to contact them.

       Q. Microsoft created a huge drawing program to be allied with the popular 'MS Paint'. It was an instant success, selling millions upon millions worldwide. It was so good, an African firm, based in Egypt, decided to spend a great deal of money importing it, which would mean a journey across some very harsh desert land. As cars could not make their way through, they had to use a camel. The relay-man was very fat, but the camel had taken his weight before. Unfortunately, the combined weight of him and the well-packed program caused the camel's spine to snap, leaving the man stranded in the desert. What actually broke the camel's back?  A. MS Draw - it was the MS Draw that broke the camel's back.  Love, Jon Roskilly

       Um... I don't understand what's brought this on but I'm going to let it appear as I feel it.  I am really, really, sorry, if anything goes wrong for any of you as a result of me existing over the next few days. I have a huge fear that something really very bad has happened and that I am directly responsible. I don't know the action which caused it, and I don't know what's happened, but I've just been completely overcome with a deep sense of regret and despair. I'm sorry. I love you all (those that I know read this) so much, and my brain isn't coping with the burden of an apparent massive guilt.  Love, Jon Roskilly

       I am feeling a bit of an arse though... for the sake of our Lord, no people trying to be witty and saying "Oh, I bet you are!" or words to that effect. I just feel small, annoying, and somewhat insignificant... I guess most people get that from what they tell me. But, you know, it's not entirely enjoyable. But never mind. Actually, don't comment on this one. I don't want a load of a people saying "I don't find you annoying" because that won't really help. Whether you find me annoying or not is marginally irrelavant - I feel it.  Love, Jon Roskilly

       I imagine I've done something more than averagely wrong... I'm not sure what but in general if something negative seems to be happening it usually is, and it's usually my fault... hm... oh well.  There's a bright golden haze on the meadow... well, there isn't, but today has had much sun. It's been in actuality quite pretty. Very hot though... Gwen was toasted, which is strange, because usually she's the one that doesn't burn. I didn't. So, maybe the sun is liking me a bit atm? Actually, thinking about it, I was outside in sun for a grand total of about 3 minutes... so perhaps that doesn't count? I don't know.  Shez has given me his old mobile, so I have a mobile now... woo, thankyou Shez, you sexy beast. Now I can text people. And when people ask me for my mobile number, I can actually stop saying "Sorry, I don't have one, but I like you a lot, so do you want my home adress?" It has nicht so much ring to it.  Oh, I don't think I said, Becky did email me in the end, thanks to Jack being a star and asking Alex who is a friend of hers. The irony in calling Jack a star is intentional (He was Javert, ie. his main song was Stars). But yeah, he's über-nice and should go out with the woman he wants, name as of yet undisclosed. Cause, you know, him being single simply does NOT work. Anyway, yeah, I have little to nothing to report on the Becky front. We haven't discussed anything, so we haven't had any interesting conversations.  CAYO practice was this morning, which ruled, cause I got to see Jazz and Adele again... tho Jazz isn't going to be there next week *cries*.  Oh, and the NJaN practice got off to a really, really slow start (we had a stand-in drummer, Ben couldn't make it) but after a long break we spent an hour or so just jamming and pretty much came up with 2 songs. Ruleage! The idea for jamming came from Tobin but the riffs came from me. Obviously. Like musical inspiration is going to come from someone else, I'm the most talented man in the world. Here endeth the sarcasm.  Anyway, yes... um... heheh. I've got stuck in that phase of just searching for things to blog about. Yeah, I'm still feeling pretty insecure but I'm not unhappy.

       I should really be doing my maths coursework in this lunchtime I have available for it, but I believe that the fact the people I love most dearly will be reading this makes this more important to me.  I want to stress something as clearly as I possibly can - I am not depressed. I am not sad, even. What I am is a little confused, and can it be said throughout the entire course of my life that there has been a time when this was not the case? I don't understand my feelings and I wait in perhaps my own limbo but no-one is to blame for this. I stress again that I am not depressed in any real way. I am not angry, saddened, nor dissapointed in anyone. My own feelings are to blame for how I am - and I don't believe that that is such a bad thing. It is better to feel and live than to simply exist.  Nothing's really... happening for me at the moment. Everything I was waiting for has gone, including Les Mis. Massive amount of PPD (post-production depression) after that. I guess that it is vaguely possible that I could be said to be waiting for the equivalent of a 'green light'. I hate to put it like that though. I'm just... sitting here, watching the wheels go round. I think whether my time comes or does not come is as of now something I have no control over, so I believe my best course of action is to take each day as it comes.  Quote of the day: "I'm just sitting here, Watching the wheels go round and round. I really love to watch 'em roll. No longer riding on the merry go round, I just had to let it go."  From Lennon's   Watching the Wheels go Round   Love, Jon Roskilly

       Recently a lot of people have called me "hot", "cute", "sexy", or "sweet". These are all entirely complimentary as far as I can see. However I'm inclined to doubt the opinions of the people who have commited themselves to such a statement. Nothing that has happened tonight has spurned this, it's a lack of belief in what people say positively to me that has been nurtured by years of sarcasm directed at me. I find myself in a fight against myself and neither side can win on account of both sides being the same.  I'm not depressed, I promise. I'm... worried, I guess. I'm worried about me. I'm worried about the next month or so for me.  Love, Jon Roskilly

       I look to the God that created man and tortured him in certain circumstances to help me here.  There is no definitive set-in-stone path in my mind - there are 2 that I could take - to do, or not to do. To ask, or not to ask. I guess to be a man, or to be Jon. I don't know what man would do. I have less idea what Jon would do. Perhaps the question in my mind is one that begs an answer, and it appears to be only quenchable by asking the question in the correct setting. What's done is done, I have to leave the past behind me and perhaps look to the immediate future. The warning sounds blare in my mind but I feel it has to be done - whether I succeed in my quest for the time to be soon or whether the timing is bad, and set in even less apple-blossomed times, perhaps is an unanswerable question at the moment. Will I 'chicken out' at this late stage? Can I give up? Or, more importantly, can I proceed and do what must be done, if the answering action is repudiation? Can my confidence suffer another blow, forcing the phrase "the higher you climb, the harder you fall" into sharp focus?  What is love?  Quote of the day: "What's done is done, And what's won is one, And what's lost is lost, And gone forever. I can only pray for a bright, brand new day, In the town I loved so well."  From the Irish folk song   The Town I Loved so Well   Love, Jon Roskilly

       From Chicago to New York - my Steve Reich CD's arrived from Preston, and that quote is used in the first part of the first song - Different Trains.  I've got a large collection of Les Mis stuff which is now residing on my wall... it needs to be seen to be believed I think but it's pretty impressive I think. Or not, you know, at the moment I couldn't care less.  I don't think I'm in a particularly bad mood, I'm just not in a good one. Confusion once again plagues my head, my brain spins out of control once more... perhaps an overly romantic description but it's how I feel. My thoughts fly apart.  Let's be blatant, I've been thinking about Lawa a lot recently, but I've also today been thinking a lot about Beccy. It's not a different obsession, I promise. What it is is that I feel very confused about what was a pretty massive difference from how we reacted first time we met. First time, she was a little disinterested, she talked to all the adults while I was kinda set apart. On Saturday we talked a lot and she was sitting on my lap, playing with my jumper and putting her arms around my neck. I don't know. People change, and she was different from how I remembered her. But am I so different now as well?  I suppose if I had to select a current mood, it would be a mixture of bemused, confused, and worried.  Love, Jon Roskilly

       Haven't blogged at school for a good long while, so here I am, blogging in the computer room. Isn't that nice?  Had my terminal task earlier, I'm pretty certain that went brilliantly. Mr. Thompson remarked that it was "excellent" so I'm hoping for a nice grade. I even managed to shove in some humour. Go me.  As if it wasn't guessable I've been thinking about someone a lot today... for minor suspense (minor being the key word (oh so intentional pun), as I think this is work-outable) I'm not saying who in such words but I'm just going to say I'm thinking about them a lot and leave it at that. That.  Actually, while I think about it, I haven't been in the computer room at all recently. Heyhey, hello computer room.  If you don't mind, I'll repost later... if you do mind, then I'll still repost later, albeit against your will.

       I got me Grade 8 certificate today. You know how when you're really proud of something? I am. Mee.  I'm actually quite confused. Let's leave that be, but still, confused Jon. But, perhaps I'm confused in the romantic sense, the kind of confusion that they sing about. Perhaps not. Actually surprisingly non-linked issue, Beccy hasn't yet emailed me. Hoping she will. She probably won't though. Oh well. Missing Lawa, like apparently she's missing me. How did I get 2 women in that paragraph?  Course the GYO audition's next week. It... kinda seems pointless in that they have asked me twice to enter without audition, and the grade entry level is 7. Not 8 with distinction. That's NYO. Next stop for me. Hopefully? Anyway, that'd rule so much. Smug level = through the roof a bit. But still. What's happening now? I can't put together a cogent few sentences...  Les Mis is finished. All of the cast, I'm in love with you.  I'm going to quit while I'm ahead. Uh... Lawa, wanna talk to ya. It's not urgent.

       I'm really, really over-tired, so I'm going to make this as brief as I can.  The Les Mis performances were cool, although to my mind they started brilliantly and ended on a comparative low (I think it would have still been a high if I wasn't judging it against the first night, though). Was über-fun to do. I'm really going to miss all of the peoples who have been really nice during it... mostly James, Harry, Josie + Chrissie, Phil + Christina, Simon, Susie, Liv, Jack, Joe, N'omi, Rhi (obviously), Barley and Tom, who is in actuality an adult-ish but he's so irresponsible it's just funny...  Prime example of Tom's irresponsibility was yesterday. I'll get onto that though, I'll go step by step. Well, afterwards, I got my banner from Scott *hugs* and got changed. Oh, actually, missed out a stage.  Went into town with all the peoples at 3ish, and we wandered round, mostly in Millennium Music where we spent over an hour buying a plectrum (there was a woman called Laura something who Shez knows. Pity Shez wasn't with us at the time. But anyway, she's cool). Met Shez, and I bought cards for Liv, Phil + Christine, Jo + N'omi + Barley, Jake, Simon, James and Josie + Chrissie (my reasoning for not getting Jack one was that I bought him one for his birthday so that can suffice in my opinion. I only have a finite amount of money). That ended up costing me £11.55. Anyway, took t'lads back to my house and went off to Les Mis. You know, then we had the performance which went well. Liv and I both cried quite a lot during Rain. In My Life was as heartbreaking for me as always.  Right, back to afterwards. We had the after show party! Woo! I played the guitar and made up a "We finished Les Mis" song and basically the entire cast joined in clapping in time. It ruled. Simon, Phil and I did Californication together and Under The Bridge... this is what you get for knowing RHCP fans. Oh, and I did a Piano + Guitar/Vocs duet, with one of the backstage crew, of Imagine, and that was pretty cool. We also did a piano duet of Peter Gunn, in which I did my tune bit and let him improv. You know how these jazz players are. Seriously, though, the guy was on fire. Not literally. We spent the rest of the time really singing through songs and swapping roles - for instance, Phil and I did the docks, Phil being Fantine and... well, I'm glad that's probably not something people got a picture of. We did One Day More and I got to be Javert! Yay! Found out Liz, Jack's mini sister, is actually... not that mini... in fact she's 16. Now, I find her good looking, so I'm glad she's not as old as I thought she was. I thought she was in like Yr9, not Yr11... that's the only recent misjudging of age that I've made where I've judged someone to be younger than they actually are. But yeah, still... über-cool thing was, she had 2 people coming to see her, and one of them was the flautist (Beccy) for GODS' Music Night, that I did the trombone for way back in October. Well, I talked to her a fair bit. I really didn't expect to see her ever again. That was odd.  Anyway, went back to Andrea's afterwards and we basically... well, sad to say but we did things like this; "Look down, look down, don't fart 'em in the eye. Look down, look down, you're here until you fart. The fart is strong, it's hot as hell below. Look down, look down, there's 20 farts to go. I've done no fart... sweet Jesus, hear my fart..." and so on. Sorry, Les Mis fans. It was incredibly fun though. Oh, and Beccy sat on my lap and we were generally closish. Which is odd, given that meeting again ever would be incredibly unlikely. But yeah, she was cool, and not so sensible as last time. Which is a good thing, believe me. But yeah... Barley got pissed on like a glass of gin. Oh, while I think about it, whisky and Pepsi is not a good mixer. Trust me. Liv thought what I'd written in her card was really sweet and gave me a lot of hugs and sat on me for quite a while. I think I'm becoming a bit of a ladies' man. Oh well, it's nice to have someone there. It would be nicer if I actually was going out with them but that's not looking likely for a while, at least. Anyway. Yeah, we watched the dress rehearsal (it was recorded) and I ruled for some of it... I'm sorry, but I did! I'm proud of me at the moment. Getting to sleep was the hard part. At the beginning I was kinda sharing a cover with James but N'omi (who Tom said probably fancied me... not meaning to sound really smug but it was guessable, she has that puppy-dog look with me all the time. Which either means she wants me, din-dins, or both)  said it'd work better if she had less room because she's smaller (like 1 foot smaller) so I went to where she'd been and head-to-toed with Harry, who's small but has really long legs so it's hard to get comfy. Anyway, so I got bugger all sleep.  But yeah. Really tired. That took too long *dies*. The thing about being over-tired is I get very depressed, it's what happens to me, so I'm kinda thinking about someone who lives near Winchcombe a lot.

       I love Liv *cries* in an artistic sense. We rule. We all rule. Bow to us.  I know, I've lost a certain amount of modesty, but seriously... if you don't count a few prop problems it went ├über-well... as far as I know I didn't quite succeed in making LFZN cry but I know I think I know I came close. Yay, I think. But still, *sighs* tonight was cool. I also got to walk back to Charlton Kings from town with 3 absolutely stunning girls, Lawa being one. I mean, seriously... über-happy.  The past 2 days have been... well, artistically speaking, the best of my life. I've been part of the first of what will be 3 stunning performances of the best musical ever, I've found out that I'm in at least the top 100 youth trombonists in Britain... I'm... pretty happy, let's put it that way. There are only a couple of ways this could be made even better.  Oh, and I'm in love with Scott, and I'm going to marry him when I'm older. Really. Nah, but still, he's cool.  Quote of the day: " Hey, little boy, what's this I see? God, Eponine. The things you do.   I know this is no place for me, Still I would rather be with you.

       Not only did I get the result of my Grade 8 through today (^_^) but Winterheart's Guild (the Sonata Arctica Album I ordered but a couple of weeks ago) came in today. The first track is cool, but I think that's all I'm going to get to listen to 'fore I piss off to the Les Mis dress.  Oh, and this is particular to Scott - you know you were talking about changing a note in a piece and making someone cry? Well, the case picture behind the CD (ie. the bit that holds it) has the words "...I can change one note and make you cry..." on it. Weird, no?  Love, Jon Roskilly

       I just keep rereading and rereading Ging's last post... Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww ^_^. So cuute.  I learnt to play Creep, which is a cool song, and so I'm quite pleased with me. I've got Les Mis in 2 days. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!  Quote of the day: "Whatever makes you happy, Whatever you want.

       There are a million things I want to say, ask, do, but I have no idea how to phrase them. I have no idea how to even think about them properly... not depressed, I promise.  *stretches* And so once again I sit here, in front of my computer, unaware of what to do other than metaphorically cling on to the virtual rope that is the internet. It makes no difference that the rope itself does not at the moment contain, wound inside it, any of the answers, and it probably won't tomorrow. It makes little difference that the entire being an emotional wreck thing isn't... entirely attractive. It makes very little difference that sitting here, typing this, means very little to me. Tonight, I look beyond this internet and take a moment to look outside my window.  Overcast, cloudy, black, the skies display none of the stars Brendan loves so much. But they're there, just subtley hidden behind a thin veil that, although it cannot be taken away, can be broken by itself. The beams of light exist beyond what we can see, what we can percieve, but even so we know they're there. Similarly I know there's something good about the particular situation I'm in, perhaps a sort of reciprocation. However, I can't see anything, so I don't know what it is. But I know that it "IS".

       Tu as entré mon âme.  Well, I'm back, and once again my views are a little clouded. I am unaware of whether I've returned to a previous state of mind but at any rate I'm in a situation that I have never been in before... damn.  Les Mis lurches toward me at the moment, and I guess it really hits me on Tuesday. We have a run from the Tech on Tuesday to the final performance on Saturday, spending at least 4 hours at Balcarras a day. It's almost over now. Lame. But still, it's definitely been worth it. If nothing else I've got to know the music, which is worth a lot to me, because I'm kind of obsessive about it now. And I've met a load of nice peoples... *cries*  *laughs* I guess I'm slightly depressed at the moment. Slightly lonely. Feeling a bit of an idiot. Oh well... see you lot later.

       Hiya.  Am at me Dad's, and blogging here takes a rather large amount of stuffal movement, and so blogging in general is more complicated. As a result, don't expect any blogging tomorrow, but I WANT TO BE BACK ON SATURDAY (I have told my Dad specifically to get me back then).  Went into town today, with Lawa. We saw 50 First Dates, which is quite cool and has Adam Sandler in. Much better film than School of Rock. Annoying thing was the screen we were in was almost full, so no getting to talk to Lawa and being all private showing ness. But still, being with her was cool. We got her brother an Easter egg from Woolies, which he will enjoy and Lawa will enjoy stealing. And we went to Starbucks, where I was all non-explorative, getting seulement a hot chocolate. Rah. Nah, but being with Lawa ruled, she still makes me swoon inside. ...Yeah, ok, stop typing now...  Anyway, yeah... *hums Can't Get You Out of My Head* I bought the Radiohead album My Iron Lung on a whim while I was waiting for mum to pick me up from town. Seems a waste of £6 when I'm not even that keen on Radiohead, but still... at least if I don't like any of the songs on the album (other than MIL) I can say that my dislike is entirely founded. I dunno, after leaving Lawa it seemed a good thing to do, spend money. Take my mind off the fact that she had to go home... in actuality, despite the fact we talked a lot in Starbucks, I know nowt more now... Oh well. I know enough to swoon.  Yeah, stop being obsessive. Something else... Oh, did no revision today. So, you know, *punches self*. That's 2 days I've missed. Yay. Although good thing is Lent ends today (it does, I promise) so I can eat chocolate again! Yay! Have done already. Lawa and Lisa seem to think Lent ends on Easter Sunday... if it does, then I've cheated but to be honest I was giving up for the period I know as Lent. If I've misjudged the boundary, surely I've kept within the task for myself?  Would like to see Lawa again tomorrow if I could. I know, shut up now...

       I have read tonight  Dave's blog , and the recent post has dismayed me, it must be said, because it works against a fundamental principle involved in the depths of blog itself. Everyone uses their blog for a different reason. Mine is a form of a diary that tells people what I am thinking, perhaps sometimes too bluntly. At the risk of sounding nasty, and I really don't mean to be here, this is a comment that can't really be taken the way I mean it; perhaps in that situation it would have been better for Dave to have kept to his non-criticism of other peoples' writings. I actually find it mildly offensive to read as I know my blog is sometimes depressed and a little angst-ridden, but I take pride in the fact I am unabashed  (in general) in telling people how I feel. I will hide names from time to time but even in that I have the ability to be so unsubtle it's obvious, which is actually deliberate. OK, this shouldn't be a rant, and in fact I don't intend it to be, I like Dave and I understand his comment. However I think it's a bit short-sighted. I read about 10 blogs in total, and up to 20 from time to time, and none are the same in usage.  Love, Jon Roskilly

       20 minutes until I can eat chocolate again! WOOOOOOOOO!  Meeting Lawa tomorrow, also woooo! We can do something *coughs*. I think I may have to lock myself into my chair to stop temptation running it's course...  I was annoyingly sickening earlier, but Fi didn't mind, so that was OK. I wasn't being sickening about Fi, obviously.  Anyway, tired. Love you all.  Quote of the day: "In my life, She has burst like the music of angels, The light of the sun.

       Let's be honest, I'm a mixture of irritated, confused, dissapointed, and bored.  Dissapointed is an easy one to cover - Haven't done my revision yet and am currently blogging instead of doing it. Not that that stops me blogging instead. Self-control that has saved Charlton Kings' chocolate, wherefore art thou?  Irritated - MSN ISN'T BLOODY WORKING RAAAAAH. *whines* I wanted to talk to Lawa and peoples... mostly Lawa, cause we're getting on really well again now, not that we weren't getting on but we were getting on less well. Meeting up on Thursday, probably, yay! Apparently there's a "Jon sit" which I imagine would be "Jon situation" which I would  imagine  to mean whether or not it's set in stone... however, I cast no judgement, I don't know for certain. This is something I won't know for certain unless Lawa tells me, because I'm not asking. If she means is it set in stone, it is for me love, I'm not leaving until about 7.  Confused - Spent the day with N'omi, which was quite cool. What was odd is that we did basically nothing, we organised it really badly and ended up with me feeling quite guilty but just whooping her at Dead or Alive 2... there's a limited amount TO do here, though, apart from the PS2 and watching Blackadder. We did both, then went round CK looking for pictures of ourselves. We found quite a few. I look awful in the Les Mis photos. Really, really awful. I stand by my comment that I look best in photos if I'm dead. I don't look that bad in the one in which I'm shot and on the floor, but I look terrible in all the others. It's partly because my hair's a bad length (irritatingly face-covering but not long enough for a ponytail or anything), partly because I look like this *grins and makes people run away screaming* and partly because I'm one of the least photogenic people on God's green Earth.  Bored - Well, just... although it's been spent with N'omi, who is pretty cool and I can talk to easily enough, the day's been pretty dull. Was spent mostly trying to think of things to do.  We return briefly to Les Mis and the Marius + Cosette situation. Now, N'omi and I have worked out that the way we've been doing certain scenes is illogical, doesn't work with the words, and would be boring for the audience. We're going to have to try and work something out. Being romantic is hard. ACTING romantic is about 4 times as hard, especially when you've got to work out what you're singing at the same time. N'omi keeps saying that she'll kiss my cheek or something in the production; I haven't yet pointed out to her that if she's been to frightened to do it in the rehearsals it's unlikely, bordering on infinitely improbable, that she'll do it in the real thing. For me, I don't mind either way, but we need to look romantically linked which I think is something we're not acheiving. Perhaps the fact that we're now friends is a minus, because looking romantic at each other would, I fear, just make us burst out laughing. It's nice to know in a way. In a purely professional sense, it's a horror of horrors.  As we continue along the Les Mis route, I'm going to propose to Liv (notice the lack of a full stop there) that we don't even  try  to fit in the rest of A Little Fall of Rain. It'd be overly rude to the musicians to give them that short notice (I've done pit work and had it done to me, it's not only irritating but mind-numbingly difficult to work round) and it'd have to be worked through in a grand total of 2 rehearsals. Including the dress. So, unless she's willing to work out some time to meet up and run through it, I don't think it's a possible. Unfortunately. I love the song.  Oh, open mic thing yestertag was pretty cool, Shez and I did Livin' On a Prayer and Bohemian Like You. I personally did Imagine, Working Class Hero, and Mother. John Lennon fan over here.  Quote of the day: "As soon as you're born, they make you feel small, By giving you no time instead of it all, Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all."

       Heh. Buggered up the day for the open mic thing at Starbucks. Thought it was tomorrow. It's on tonight. Am taking Gwen to watch and getting her a hot chocolate. Although now, having talked to Shez, I might not be able to take her on account of going into town early to hang about with Shez so he's not "bumming around town" on his own.  I'm actually kinda stuck for things to say, to be honest not so much has happened with me over 1 day. Although, discounting today, I've got 2 days until I can eat chocolate again. Yum.  Oh, and I got Fi to comment on my last post. My blog misséd her, so I got her to stroke it. And thanks Patrick for your dirty mind, I'll remember to twat you for that next time I see you ^_^.  Quote of the day: "Be still, my soul, The Lord is always with thee. Bear patiently The cross of greif or pain. Leave to thy God To comfort and to share thee. With every change, He faithful remains."

       Burned yet another CD onto my PC. Got it yesterday - Best of Deep Purple. Gotta say, although I really like it, it's not shifted my alleigance in terms of my favourite of the Big 3 being Led Zepplin. The Big 3 of course being Iron Maiden, Led Zepplin and Deep Purple. But still, nice to have Smoke on the Water and some other songs. Might try and convince tout le NJAN to do Smoke on t'Water, cause it's one of those songs that once the audience are a little quieter, all you need to do is make the guitar play the opening and they love it. Ruleage.  I was sorting through my CDs today, actually. Never knew how much dust there was on my old CDs. *coughs*. I managed to find a CD I made when I was younger and more foolish and downloaded a lot of music, and I think I'm entitled to own this CD now; all of the tracks on there I either own or have ordered and haven't got yet because it's out of stock (ie. the only tracks I don't own on an album are those on the Sonata Arctica album Silence, which has been on order for 2 years). Oh, apart from the 2 from the FF9 OST. Like I'm going to fork out £40 for a grand total of about 2 properly original tracks. They make an awful game, they can expect to be screwed over by me.  Read Patrick's blog and discovered that I am apparently a "legend". I think that's one of those "go me" moments. Perhaps something that's slightly less "go me" is that, despite my best intentions (getting up before midday), I didn't actually manage to do my papers today. I had intended to do them yesterday, but somehow I managed to get phoned by N'omi at 8:15PM... and not get off the phone until about 1AM. Possibly slightly too strange for me to kinda understand that one. *sighs* I have too many women in my life and too little idea what's going on with any of them. Go me.  I need to take Shez's belt back at some point... I might do that in a bit, I feel like a walk. Je ne sais pas. Never thought I'd say this but I'm bored out of my skull. Apart from coursework (no, I'm not doing that, buffoons) I've got sod all to do. And feeling guilty about it. I've actually done my piano practice, and I'd do some trombone practice but I've got nothing to practice, apart from techniques and when I'm bored doing that seems to seem to be counter-productive. Listening to all the music I've ripped onto my PC - 346 tracks - to try and pass some time. You know, 23 hours worth of time. If you don't count the Classic FM Mag. CDs, then I've burned all my CDs bar about 6. I think 4 of those are box set ones.  As I wander out of the door each day to phaff around at various locations, rarest of all to actually do anything worthwile, I notice in the window of The Vine a set of pictures, taken rather clumsily during an early rehearsal for Les Mis. And despite the fact I was sexy 2 days ago, I look absolutely awful in those. Seriously, the amount I look bad has to be seen to be believed. Ie. I'm not going to let any of you see it. Bwahaha.  I was thinking, you know the song from Les Mis, "A Little Fall of Rain"? Well, there's the oh-so-wonderfully-sweet last line "And rain will make the flowers grow." It crossed my mind that manure ALSO makes the flowers grow.  Quote of the day: "No-one was born to be a slave, Seek the past, and place the blame, Tell me the colours of the rain, No-one was born to be a master. In this land, we live, we die, Brace the oneness, brace the lie, To bind a ring around the fakir We will need a true rain maker."

       Oh. My. I actually rule.  Seriously, gig went so well it's not fair. Was dancing around on stage a bit, sang well, the music was brilliant and the audience were exceeding words in how good they were. I'm going to spend an hour telling you about the people surrounding the best performance of my life.  First off, I need to point this out before anything else: Segye, Shez, Nick and Jo all rule so much that even the Queen still has to write "If you in your infinite wisdom would grant me this priveledge" to them. About 4 rehearsals with me and we put on a performance better than I've done with a year's practice with other people. Just... oh my... seriously. I got to hug all of the band members, and that was cool, and I really want to steal Nick and Jo and put them in a box as my pretties. ^_^ Then I'd have pretties ^_^.  I said "Hi Brendan!" to Brendan. You know, there's not a lot to say on the subject. I said hi. He said hi back. *sniffs* It was so special...  *cries with joy* I saw Laura, I saw Laura ^_^. She gave me some nice looks when I was on stage. *dances* Unfortunately, I talked to her not so much... *cries* but still, yay, hugged her 3 times, managed to resist any jumping on and/or kissing her things, so that's all in good fun. I saw Fi too, with her hair and her leg-covering things. Which was quite cool. Oh, and I've [finally] met Nikky! First meeting in person went like this...  Hi Jon!   He!...llo....   You do know who I am, yeah?   Of course... *blank look*   From the internet?   ....int...!! OH!!! NIKKY!!! *big big hug*  Aw, she rules. Ging is superb as a guitarist, possibly the best that has ever wandered into my vision. Well done him. Lisa and Zoe and Patrick... and Digby and Sarah were also there, and they were all super-nice. Patrick was so ecstatic when he hugged me that he knocked my jaw out. Couldn't move it properly for a bit. Ouch.  Saw Jack (Javert) there, he was lighting-helping, and doing a good job of it. He was well pleased, I think. He seemed it, anyway. I also saw Liz, his sister, who I think pulled some of my hair out or something because I felt a yank and then turned round and saw her running away from me, so... but still, I'll find out on Saturday what she thought. No I won't. CAYO's not on on Saturday. Ah. But still.  Tobin and Libby were there, I got hugs from both of 'em... yay! When I come to think of it, all of the hugs were for a bare-chested Jon... wow, Jon was not only sexy but he was huggable, too. Libby was ecstatic, and Tobin was very pleased. Tobin said I'd "done him proud" and Libby broke her voice crying "You ruled!" when she went to hug me. Jon's pleased with that. I made a woman break her voice. ^_^.  Rhi was there! Talked to her for about 45 minutes about everything or nothing, was quite cool. She was looking really lonely, so I talked to her for a bit, and it was quite cool...  A woman borrowed my lipstick. Seriously. A woman asked if she could borrow my lipstick, and she did. I can forever keep in my heart that a woman borrowed my lipstick.  Buzzy ruled. He was the king of the drums. He bust they ass. No, but seriously, Buzzy ruled.  Now for possibly the ultimate in things that are so cool it doesn't make much sense. While I was singing, my gaze was caught by a woman who was watching particularly intently, perhaps slightly quizzically. I noticed a light of recognition burst in her eyes and she almost fell over with shock, shouting "Oh My God" loud enough to hear over the loudish music. I spent the majority of the set trying to work out who she was - this won't mean a lot to you so I'll explain it step by step. I met a woman on the French exchange, Sophie Wilcox, who I liked and perhaps fancied a bit but I was with Sam at the time so I got on well with her and that was that (subtle hint in that MYSELF, I managed to resist the temptation to cheat). We got quite closish on the internet, and she confided things with me about her relationship with her boyfriend (Martin, started going out with him shortly after the exchange). Anyway, her internet broke and she hasn't been able to get on for a year and a half, just about. The woman who was so shocked at seeing me was Sophie, and such an amazing coincidence it was because, although she goes to Pates, she didn't know that I could sing. She must have one amazing memory to recognise someone she knew with short hair and glasses to be someone with long hair and lipstick, with no glasses. I'm so glad she did though, because being me I would never have recognised her, I think. That's probably the last time I'll ever see her. She gave me a couple of big hugs, was über-friendly and in general was cool. Love you, Sophie.  Laura, Fi, Nikky, Tobin and Libby have all seen but one aspect of my performance skills. Laura says she likes performers, so I hope that she'll like me in the very contrasting role of Marius in Les Mis. It's A Heart Full of Love v. Suck My Kiss for today. *bows and runs off*  Quote for today: "At least I have her love, The city, she loves me. Lonely as I am Together we cry."

       Existence is surprisingly tiring... seriously. You try to sit down and exist without getting tired after a bit. You can't do it, can you? Nyah. Gotcha.  After reading Lisa's "On Weblogs" (sidebar -> links), which displays an almost angry look at those blogs that aren't hers, I've started to think about why I don't similarly draft, proof-read, and then double-check my blog posts. I think my feeling is that my posts exist in a similar manner to my speech - it all comes out in whatever order it wants to, and neither dam nor really big plastic bung will stop it. Also I try and post at least once every day (I also fail quite a lot), and as a result I can't always be certain that a large amount has happened on the day. I think my feeling is that, as a blog reader, I'd prefer to see something interesting but haphazard than boring but well-planned. Obviously, me losing readers seems to disprove that... oh well.

       Madman's Love Song (You Couldn't) Jon Roskilly  I'm here like a madman, Crying your name out in the night. I'm here like a lonely man, Trying to work out what's not right.  And you told me that you Would try to understand... And every night I wished you Were here, holding my hand.  I'm finding my footing again Just in case you strike me down I'm sure you couldn't but my Thoughts are spinning round and round.  You said you love me, and Hey, I love you too. But I think that you don't love me Like I love you.  Whoa.  You couldn't hold me in your arms A moment longer than I kept myself there. I write myself a song to stem the paranoia, To let myself know that you still care.  Whoaaa. Whoaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, ohh.  I watch the programs on TV To see the world isn't just mine. I live alone, and don't you see, That with my talking duck I'm fine.  Of course, I'd like the company That comes with having you around. What do you mean when you say That I'm not mentally sound?  Whoa.  You couldn't hold me in your arms A moment longer than I kept myself there. I write myself a song to stem the paranoia, To let myself know that you still care.  Whoaaa. Whoaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, ohh. Whoaaaaa-ahhhhhhhhh...Huagh. Ooh!  (spoken) Perhaps I've gone slightly insane. Oh well. It could be worse. I could look, smell, talk like... Well, I could BE Mr. Dubyah. That'd be hell, I'll tell you that now. Thank your lucky stars I'm not in charge of the world. I'd probably resurrect the Beatles. Even the 2 that are still alive. Eh, I'd find a way, I promise you. I could make Paul look less like Bruce Forsyth. Take Ringo back to the days before Thomas the Tank Engine. While I was at it, I could probably sedate Brian May. Give the wanker a haircut. Anyway, yes. (/spoken)  It wasn't you that turned me into me, I promise you now. I think I really need some help, I've run out of rhymes...      somehow.  Whoa.  You couldn't hold me in your arms A moment longer than I kept myself there. I write myself a song to stem the paranoia, To let myself know that you still care.  Whoaaaaaaaa. Yeah!  You couldn't hold me in your arms A moment longer than I kept myself there. I write myself a song to stem the paranoia, To let myself know that you still care.  Whoaaaaaaa... ahhh it's higheer. Oooh higher. Hiya!  Love, Jon Roskilly

       Jurassic Park has made its way into my top 5 films again. Yay for it.  Shall try to not mention what I usually mention for the whole of this post. Yep. I'm watching channel 3. Oddness. I dunno, it had JP, now it's got Who Wants to be a Millionaire?, so...  Nothing useful to blog. Oh well. Ohohoh, saw Kerry in town. That was mad. Also saw Liv (Eponine) and to be honest that was mildly painful... I've been missing her a lot, cause I got on with her really well... I've been missing the whole of the cast of Les Mis but Liv the most. She was so great to act, sing, and exist with.

       Gah, silly Countdown, interrupting Friends :(. Kill it, kill it now.  Anyway, English exam this morning. The Of Mice and Men qu... oh, excuse me, the ' Of Mice and Men ' question was very cool and easy to write about (3 pages!!), but the poetry ones left a little to be desired. What they left to be desired were good questions.  Oh, and I'm thinking about lobbying to get NJaN a name change... dunno, I'll put that out in the open to readers - What do you think about Not Just a Number as a name?  One last thing, I think the Telegraph or someone should make a blog that tells you the news. That'd be an original idea.

       Gah, I'm sorry to keep doing these moderately depressing posts. I happen to be actually quite content at the moment (mostly because I've been reading Laura's old archives from when I was all sweet and fresh ^_^).  I've been thinking today about Emma Hole, the U6 girl who died late last year. For those of you who don't know, she was driving when she lost control of the car and it crashed into another car. She was killed outright. It's just the U6 left today and I was reading through Pete Hards' yearbook and, flicking through, I'd gone past the people I know and love well; Alan Bills, Sally Grant, Pete Hards, Sam Taunton, Vicki Selby... some people I know less well, too; Ben George, Delyth Elliot, Carolyn Sheppard... and I got to the entry on Emma Hole. It was fairly short, concentrating on how kind and beautiful she was, and how she would always be remembered. I then got to thinking about Sam Taunton, who was knocked off his bike about half way through last year, and was in a coma as a result of serious head injuries. I thought about how he survived without serious reprecussions, and returned to school with us in September. It seems horrible to say it but I'm almost glad it was her instead of him. They say we pay for every survival with a death; and I didn't know Emma apart from by face. But even in that... I'm not going to forget her. Even though I have no idea what she was like.   They say time is the fire in which we burn.  -  Dr. Soran, Star Trek: Generations   Love, Jon Roskilly

       There's been a little development on the leg situation; I fear Imay have sprained my ankle. Ouch.  Anyhow, today, I've been mostly bored, but revising. In school. Tout seul. Although Tom Lowe came in and we had a natter, Tom G and I went to the music room and made up songs about body parts (It's The Eye to the tune of On My Own being one), and Joe T has helped me with my maths. In a 45 minute revision period I did 2 questions. In the words of the immortal Mini-Me... EEE! I've revised 4 subjects in total and I intend to do some music at 3... although I fear I've forgotten my books. If I have, I shall just not revise the music. I need 50% for an A*, so I'm not aaaall that fussed. I will be if I don't get 50%, though. I'll be livid. Jon Gwenlivid Thomas Roskilly.  It struck me today; I'm going to go and see Bill Bailey in a week and 2 days. Only one word can describe that realisation... WOOYAY!  Yes... Rhiannon sent me an email, which has made me miss her. She's cool and I see her not much. I see Zoe even less i_i... I see Sam barely ever but I think that's better on account of otherwise I fear I'd get killed. Possibly. Actually, quite probably.  One day more, until my exam in German list'ning, and also then in Music listening. The board who do not know the time will mark my paper in the line, one day more. "I did not revise until today, I woke up and my hair was parted. Tomorrow, I'll be in the hall, ah crap, my exams will have started."        Or not.

       *cries* I damaged my leg fouling Tom, Sam, and his father in football. Dirty rotten people who get fouled by me.  In other news, I have decided to stop being a whiny git until... tomorrow. I don't know... everyone wants to be with someone, or is with someone. Often both. Those who are with someone don't know how lucky they are, and those without don't know the bad they're missing. Does the bad outweigh the good?  Quote of the day: "The long and winding road That leads to your door Will never disappear, I've seen that road before.

       This counts as a post from yesterday. It can hardly be counted as Sunday when its 12:30 odd.  I'm going to probably regret putting this in but I'm over-tired and as such my head is a bit swosh.  I really need you at the moment. I'm so bloody tired and the fact that I'm advancing in so much isn't helping; I'm moving too fast, without anything constant by my side. I just want a sensitive hand entwined with mine, an arm around me just to let me know the world is still existing. I don't need love. Love hurts. I just need you to be there.  Who is that adressed to? Make up your own mind. It can be to whomever you would like it to be to. I'm not sure I know 100% who it's to.

       *scratches head* Haven't talked to Laura since I posted the thing about woman (Becky). Hm...  Anyhow, talking on Becky line for a sec if I may. One of her friends added me on MSN. My feeling? I reckon she's going to urge me to stop talking to Becky on behalf of her. Why do I think this? Partly because I'm the 3rd most annoying person I know, and partly because I'm just a wanker. Let's face it. Not the wanking, though. Yuck.  Went to Aroma today with 'the gang'. T'was moderately cool, though Cieran and Curtis didn't show up. These people with C in their names, I ask you. Yeah, walked round with everyone, then lost Scott and Marx in WHSmiths and so the number was depleted by 2. As is usual the Scott/Marx-less group wandered around aimlessly into RGames and the Software Store. Funfunfunfunfun.  Oh, and apparently Gwen's a senior! Well done her for doing something I have absolutely NO idea what it means.  If you're free (you being indefinite from typing but definite to who's reading, especially if it's Laura) on the 13th of June (Sunday), then CYB are playing in the bandstand in Montpellier, with me doing a trombone solo called "The Joker". I wanna have someone come and gimme a hug for playing well... preference need not be mentioned!  Quote of the day: "And I know it's only in my mind... That I'm talking to myself, And not to him.

       Hiya.  I'm in the library, and I should be doing English revision. Well, I've revised the lives of Heaney and Clarke in 5 minutes and now  I'm VERY VERY narked off with the whole idea. I don't care how many times Mrs. Spilsbury has disputed it, YOU CAN'T REVISE ENGLISH PROPERLY. It hurts to try.  Had me German oral today, I reckon it were grand. I may get all my marks taken off for saying "Ich habe nicht nach Deutschland gefahren" but still, unless they do that I think it went pretty well. That's a biggy, though, that one. I did manage to get in my random knowledge of German composers and their birthplaces though. Woo.  *waves at Laura for sake of waving at person that he... you know..*  Anyway, yeah, we got let out of school for study leave 2 days early so I actually left yesterday but I forgot to tell anyone. Ha. 'Tis OK, but it's not as good as a lot of people make out. It means I've got into 6 subjects a day revision a day early (technically it should be 2 days but I was in Gloucester buying supplies after my oral so I couldn't be bothered with it. I've done Maths and English, cope). Is that so much better than phaffing about at school?  Ack, Jazz and Ig sent me a story. Via Gwen's leg. What?  Quote of the day: "Talk to me, Jesus Christ.

       On reading Patrick's blog it would appear he is not entirely jumping around in joyful spirits at my comment on him being good-looking. As a result, I'm taking it off my about bit, but still. Patrick, I dunno whether bringing other people with me would be a good idea because I'm looking for a single person shot. If you want people with you to make sure I don't rape you or anything, fair enough =p. I know you don't like certain 'chav' spots, but unfortunately the better areas of Cheltenham happen to often have chav inhabitance. Unfortunately. For example, Sandford Park. Beautiful place but with a serious chav prescence. Up to you I guess.  Had my last EVER maths lesson today. Words cannot describe how good that felt.  Love, Jon Roskilly

       I'm really tired!  But in other news, I'm v. lonely. To cut a long story short, however obsessed I am with Laura I almost managed to go out with someone recently. She turned me down a few days ago without me asking, basically, on the grounds that she'll be going to Uni in a year (she's in L6). I don't know whether the fact that I tried makes me a git. Fact is I really want to be with someone. I feel so non-ident on my own.  Also, Patrick H., I meant you. I'm not gay, or even bi, and in that, I'm not attracted to you per se. But I do think you're the most beautiful bloke I've met. I was going to ask you on MSN (h/e you never seem to be on at the same time as me) if you'd mind doing a photo shoot for me of some of your free-running - seeming as though you read my blog maybe it's an idea to do it on here. Your choice, if it'd be 'weird' then it doesn't matter. I just wanna get some proper movement photos, and free-running has a definite elegance to it.  Apparently I look like the little reporter guy from 'Almost Famous'. I disagree - I consider him to be more of a cross between Brendan and Dan. If you haven't seen the movie, I recommend you do on grounds that it's an uncanny cross. Actually, I think both of you read this?  Oh, and in the manner of Ging (who is cool), I have to express my feelings about Jazz - I looove her, in the same plutonic manner as Ging loves Laura. I dunno, she's about as mad as me so we kinda fit!  My new song at NJaN practice didn't go so well. I'll try again next week and if it doesn't work then I guess I could sneak it into an album, just record every single instrument myself. Cause unless we can work it out next week then I reckon that it'd have to be that every part was quite dull. Oh well. Side note, Libby came to see us all today. Nice Libby.

       A Little Fall of Rain From 'Les Misérables', by Claude-Michel Schönberg and Alain Boublil, lyrics by Herbert Kretzmer   Don't you fret, Monsieur Marius, I don't feel any pain. A little fall of rain Can hardly hurt me now. You're here, that's all I need to know. And you will keep me safe, And you will keep me close, And rain will make the flowers grow.    But you will live, 'Ponine, dear God above... If I could close your wounds with words of love...   Just hold me now, and let it be, Shelter me, comfort me...    You would live a hundred years, If I could show you how. I won't desert you now.   The rain can't hurt me now. This rain will wash away what's past. And you will keep me safe, And you will hold me close, I'll sleep in your embrace at last.  The rain that brings you here is heaven blessed. The skies begin to clear, and I'm at rest... A breath away from where you are, I've come home from so far.  Don't you fret, Monsieur Marius, (  Hushabye, dear Eponine,  ) I don't feel any pain. (  You won't feel any pain.  ) A little fall of rain (  A little fall of rain  ) Can hardly hurt me now. (  Can hardly hurt you now.  )   I'm here.   That's all I need to know. And you will keep me safe, And you will keep me close, (  I will stay with you 'til you are sleeping...  ) And rain (  And rain  ) Will make the flowers... (  Will make the flowers  )   Grow.

        I need somebody to love.   Chris is being overly-optomistic at the moment in regards to my situation, as it stands. Something I will have to kill him about at a later date. His incessant bragging and hinting however does plant the feeling of some chance in my mind - what do I now have to lose?  Anyway. Haven't been feeling very with it today, neither in body nor soul. I'll explain what I mean there - I'm ill and unhappy. Although reading that merits a chuckle from me. I always find it very odd to find myself writing that I am depressed, unhappy, whatever. I feel it inside but I don't really display it that much other than on here... and I tend to wear everything on my sleeve on here. Possibly why according to Zoe my blog is the most 'revealing'. I guess to an extent that's true. You get to know me many times better by reading my blog than through any conversations you may have with me.  Oh, and to clarify, yesterday's lyrics were me-written, they're for a song I'm working on at the moment. Along with about 3 others. Oh well.  Oh, and I've filled out the NYO form. I just need Phil's signature then I can send it off and get an audition in September at Bristol. What's the word? Eep.  Love, Jon Roskilly

        The Colour in Your Eyes   The fire in your eyes grows cold, The love goes as you're growing old, And now it seems that I can see The lack of love you have for me.  The wild life is dead and gone, There is no way we can go on, And now it seems that I can see There is no way through for me.  How can I tell that you don't love me? The colour in your eyes.  It seems the tables have now turned, There is a lesson to be learned. I played with fire, and now I see That that fire is now dead to me.  I've loved you now for far too long, And only for you do I long, But now I know, and now I see, The feeling's not given to me.  How can I tell that you don't love me? The colour in your eyes.  So tell me that your eyes are lying. Stop my weary heart from dying. Don't quit on me after so long. Can't you see what you are doing is wrong?  You've cut my heart now into shreds. A million thoughts run through my head, The only way that I can see Is to cut my strings off and break free.  How can I tell that you don't love me? How can I tell that you don't love me? How can I tell that you don't love me? The colour in your eyes.  Love, Jon Roskilly

       I'm in the computer room, it's after school, and I'm slightly moist after swimming. Wet me. But yeah, I'm off to Scott's once he's finished playing D+D with the peeps upstairs. I don't mean like God and people (He probably is enjoying a nice game of chess (deliberately close to WarGames)), I mean Stanners, Marx, Joe and Buzz. I'm not playing because I'm not that interested. It's not that I don't think the game is fun (which, from experience, I can say that it is), it's more that I'd prefer to be down here writing these words into this blog. So nyah, nyah, nyah, soo-dah, now we can tickle racoons.  Chris doesn't believe me that Laura is gorgeous, so I intend to send him the pic of her in which I pretty much swooned off my chair. Scott, who is a little less straight than the majority of straight people, was convinced straight off that she was (the wording is irrelevant and, for me, likely to cause some dispute/me getting twatted if stated). But yeah, diddle dee. Oh, Lawa, to let you know, I got your text at the WCB rehearsal, during a piece we've started called "Laura". I almost died.  Thinking of WCB I kinda wanna quit. I don't have a great deal of time and for me it's just not fun at all anymore. I'm playing an instrument (the baritone) that, although it has its charms, is not by any stretch of the musician's imagination a trombone. And it's that which is its major downfall.  I've managed to skimp a little on the revision. IE. I've done pretty much none. The word I'm looking for is  probably  'whoops', but stronger ones could come into effect.  Oh, and I don't care, in about 70 posts I am going to have a "300th post" party when it comes. I would have it for all the people who have a constant blog but there are a few reasons I wouldn't do that (all involving mixing certain people with Marx, because I'm a git like that and don't want things to get too complicated). Actually, if I can post just over 70 times in the next 22 days I could tie it in with Bill Bailey... that'd take a fair bit of work though...  Long, long post. I'll talk to you all later. Unless I don't actually talk to you. Which seems unlikely, most of the people who read my blog who I don't talk to only exist in my head.  Quote of the day: "Don't tell me it's not worth trying for, You can't tell me it's not worth dying for, You know it's true, Everything I do... I do it for you."

        Angel choirs call to me "David, come home, forever to join with the music of heaven." Fade into silence, the sounds I adore, songs from on high I'll play evermore.   I'm at school. Okiedokie, that's not entirely interesting. Let me see... nope, life is particularly unthrilling today. I didn't manage to get up in any decent sort of time this morning so I missed the bus again. So it's been a fairly normal sort of a day so far. Been thinking about things, never you mind what, I don't have a big internet diary thing with which to display my thoughts so I guess you'll all have... to.... oh, wait.  Mostly I've been thinking about the different people I've had a 'crush' (hate that word, it's an ugly word) on. In general, up until this year, they've been a little younger than me or my age. Suddenly as I leapt into Y11... well, to start off with I wasn't really particularly interested in any women, moreso just moping (see earlier archives (150+ posts ago is good ^_^). After that brief bit of minor asexuality I've been 'interested' mostly in people in the L6. I doubt this is onset liking older women because in general it's half a years difference or only a little more. I don't know whether it says something about my maturity level or the maturity level of the L6 peeps I meet but it seems that in general I'm more compatible with older people. It could be argued that this is a bad move for me - it takes more to get someone to 'like' you if you're younger than them than if you're older than them (experience tells me this). But still. Observationalism.  Nächste Montag habe ich meine Deutsche Mundliche Prufung. Und kann ich nicht Deutsch sprechen. Aber meine sprechen Sprache ist viel besser als meine Schreibug. Ich kann nicht viel auf Englisch schrieben, und so es ist sehr schwer für mich auf Deutsch.  If any Deutsch-a-phones can understand that I'll be v. pleased.  AH MY GCSES START IN 2 WEEKS... SHI...

Then there can be much merriment. Actually, I should throw a "300th post" party. Or not. That could be the worst idea anyone's ever had, ever.  Oh, and I've been phaffing around with Tobin's amp for around about an hour, just fiddling with echos and stuff. And I've worked out the chord progression for David of the White Rock. How cool...

       Possibly turning green. Look at me go.  Anyhows - what with the PPD of Les Mis and all Ss is a bit painful at the moment. Going from a production in which the entire cast was close to one where to be honest at least half the people go out of their way to take the Michael Douglas, and I'm only not scared of one person there (ie. Scott), it's a bit different. Oh well. I'm a whiny son-of-a-vixen sometimes.  I am really tired and peut-être un petit peu disheartened. Never mind.

       Taking the opportunity of yet another completely randomly over-complicated situation to laugh at myself. Again. Cause, when you suck as badly as I do, what else CAN you do? Apart from suicide. That's not an option, too many people rely on me at the moment.  The band practice went pretty well. We started a kinda new song. The lyrics were like this; "Only you can help me find my home, Only you can make a path through my dreams. Only you can change the world in motion, Only you can stop the flowing of streams." And I got hit for wanting to call it "Only You". What the hell...  I love Deep Purple now. They're my favourite band all of a sudden. So, yeah. Love, love, love etc.  NJaN have now got about 3 songs that are completed/near completion through jamming, and 4 in total. Which rocks. Well, only 2 rock - "Hopeless" and "What is Love?". "Only You" *punches the rest of the band* and t'other mad acoustic one are nice and sweet. Aw. I need to sort out the lyrics to the other 2. The rocky ones have already got lyrics. "You Say You Love Me" is coming on well too but I'm not sure how well it'll translate to being played live. With any luck, brilliantly. But we all know these things very rarely go according to plan. Heh, I'm the lyricist! I never thought of that before. Wow. I rule... well, I don't, but I'm quite pleased to have that revelation. Forgive me for buzzing about NJaN but I'm pleased that all of a sudden we're getting somewhere. I thought we were going to have to call it a day a while ago, we seemed to be grinding to a halt. Actually, 'A Day' might be a better name.  I look quite a lot like a woman. Who looks like a duck. So kinda a female duck. The female thing is v.v. useful for goth stuff. The duck thing is v.v. useful for working on a farm as a spy...  Quote of the day: "Believing in you seems like a whole new religion, Which is why I have to make a decision. Do I believe in our love at first sight, Or is it time for me to stand up and fight You?"  From Not Just a Number's   What is Love?   Love, Jon Roskilly

       Not a very interesting day, actually... Youth Makes Music was good, kinda, cause the playing was good and I got to talk to Jazz and Adele, and then Meg and Ainsley, so it's all good. LFN weren't there... my fault really that, I didn't organise it very well. Ah well, could've been worse. My head is hurting, though...  Um... I can't think of anything else...  There's something I wanna say to someone but I won't. *shrugs*  Quote of the day: "Nothing you can do that can't be done, Nothing you can sing that can't be sung, Nothing you can say that can't be said in another way, It's easy."

       I would say that today's topics were childbirth, and marriage. Mostly, because I was hanging around with about 7 women and Dave Smith, who interjected with things like "I can imagine you as a mother... picking up an axe and hitting your kids with it going "NO, I WILL NOT MAKE YOU ANY MORE PANCAKES!"... course by 'you' he didn't mean me, he meant the person who'd been talking about how she would be a good mother *shrugs*.  Anyway, went into Pates today at lunch, which ruled... seriously, it did. Saw Laura and Fi, got hugged a bit by both, which ruled, talked a bit to Laura, which ruled, saw Nikki briefly which was nice but not enough to see someone like Nikki for! Everyone was really nice, including Becca (tall Belgium woman who is cool and I love), and seemed generally pleased that I was there, all apart from Rebs who turned round and said "What the hell are YOU doing here?". Aw, no, she meant it nicely, I'm sure. Also saw Shez, and Will/Matt, John, Celia, a couple of women I hadn't met before, and the old oboe player for CAYO, as well as Zoe and Lisa briefly. Really cool day seeing some of the greatest people in the world all at once. Especially seeing as I don't see them a lot. Laura, Fi, Nikki, Zoe, Lisa, Shez, John, Will/Matt, Rebs, Jo, Nick, Segye, Celia and Becca, you all rule and I love you. Come back!  Had a practice with Aural for the gig on Sat, as well, and that was fun... yeah, was cool to play with them all again... *sniffs*  Have fun at King Lear, you lot.  ...  Jazz and Scott and everyone, you all rule too, but I didn't see you today >_  Quote of the day: "The summer's flower is to the summer sweet, Though to itself it only live and die, But if that flower with base infection meet, The basest weed outbraves its dignity: For sweetest things turned sourest by their deeds; Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds."

       It's you, my darling, it's you I need... I don't know what to say but I'm here, completely unaware of what to do or what I really feel but I know what I want. Being around you puts me into paradise for a short while. I can't think when I'm not near you.  That aside, I've found the scariest person on the planet - the girl who whispers on the BT advert. "Wilson through ball to Carragher. Penalty to Carragher. Wilson top right, goalkeeper go left. Die, parents, bleed to death. Eat your appendix, rabbit. Plant a small explosive device in your colon, brother."  Love, Jon Roskilly

       So, got the CYB concert tonight, gotta leave for that in 20 minutes or so. So, I've actually gotta write this post without phaffing about for half an hour.  Went into town with Scott today, was cool, thanks Scott. Lovoo. Then had trombone lesson, which was OK, as lessons go. Meh, I dunno, the first movement of the Serocki is complex... perhaps too much so for me to learn it perfectly, and keep the other 2 going, in 2 months. I should hope not, though... well, cause I've only got a month and 10 days. Silly NYO. Oh, and I've a v. high density of gigs coming up... I'm not going to list all of them but suffice it to say there are a lot.  Worried about Youth Makes Music on Wednesday. Not for the playing, that's quite easy, but actually for the fact that Becky'll be there watching her friend... and Laura'll also be there. Laura, if you're reading this, this isn't a "pull out" thing, I wuvoo, I really want you to come. I'm just saying, it might be weird... I dunno. If Becky displays to me the same non-commitedness that she has been doing I should be OK.  Just a question: does anyone actually know what love  is  anymore?

       Hey, I know it's past midnight, so technically this is the first post of a new day... meh.  Just been thinking (well, mostly been reading Gem's blog, but you know, same difference) about next academic year. Next year, I will be able to live out the Huggies maxim, and become a 'big boy'. Seriously... next year I'll be able to have conversations with Laura and suchlike about Psychology and stuff, and I'll be able to talk to Fi in German without her criticising me all the time, and know Othello backwards... and do my Grade 7 piano... but in actuality none of it really matters. I know who I am, and going up a year of schooling isn't going to make me feel better about myself. What WOULD make me feel better about myself would be passing the NYO audition - to do this I need the NYO to REPLY TO MY EMAIL and then I'll be fine.  I'd like to say a whopping big 'thankyou' to Laura and Fi for making me feel good about myself for the last few hours. Just... *hugs lots*  Love, Jon Roskilly

       I'm sorry, my commenters... but could you PLEASE make an effort not to just randomly post just to be first? If you're that keen on posting first, read the bloody post and comment on it. Seriously, if there are posts just saying "I'm first today" hereafter I WILL just delete them.  Um... Jazz and Adele are evil and tied my shoes both together and to my legs this morning >_  I'm lost for what to write now... I haven't been on at the same time as Laura for a couple of days so I haven't been able to talk to her, which is sucky. Though I did manage to talk to Jazz and Susie a lot yesterday... sliding...

       I'm sorry, I know this is 3rd post today. I'm not just trying to push my post rate up, honest.  2 dates it'd be cool if people could make if possible;    7:30PM June 30th, Cheltenham Town Hall - Youth Makes Music (CAYO/GYWO)   7:30PM July 15th, Sir Thomas Rich's School - Summer Concert (Orchestra; Wind Band; Jazz group; solo of mvts. 2+3 from Serocki's 'Sonatina für Posaune und Klavier'; duet of 'Where I want to Be' from Chess, with Tom on the piano; first live performance of 'Madman's Love Song' by NJAN)    I won't die if people don't turn up for either (with luck, already secured 3 gorgeous people for Youth Makes Music, who know who they are (or at least Laura does)), but it'd be cool to see some people at either. I do so many gigs but the Tommies one is a bit special this year because it's our first airing of Madman, so I'm hoping it'll get a good reception... had a couple of ideas about the performance. More on that story... when you come watch it. Aha! Incentive. You see, you have something to look forward to now. Nyaha.  Love, Jon Roskilly

       Am watching Mastermind. My... it's such a boring programme... better than Big Brother though. I'm sorry, everyone, I know everyone guiltily admits to watching it, and sometimes I watch it, but I'd prefer to be bored intellectually than being bored stupidly. I'm sorry... please don't kill me.  I know that the way to get to teenage females' hearts is to be slightly rogue-ish, and a bit typical-blokey. But, I can't do that, and I am saying this for a reason - It's to try to excuse what I'm about to say. I watch the news at the moment and I cry. If no-one understands why I cry when I find out that over 100 Iraqi citizens were murdered (some cases far beyond any hope of recognition) by people who are against an invasion, I'm living in the wrong bloody world. If you've read/heard my lyrics to the NJAN song 'Peace' you'll understand that it affects me a large amount... I know it's typical me but it's so bloody senseless. You wonder why I'm depressed a lot? It's not just things directly involving me that make me depressed.  Perhaps this isn't a reasonably set-out argument. It's not meant to be. This is me getting this out, so that if the news comes on when I'm with you and I rush off to the toilet, you don't think I have bowel problems.  Love, Jon Roskilly

       I'm not even going to comment on the football, apart from to say that it was unfair.  Anyway, GCSEs are over. How do I feel they went? No idea. And, to be honest, it now ceases to matter. I've done them - I can do little more now than wait.  Not sure what to do with myself. I would go into Pates to see Laura (and other people, but I don't want my motives to be guessed, I'd rather just say them) some lunchtimes, but I'm worried about getting mauled... might just go anyway but in all realism I think I'd get annoying, so I shall probably just stay here and play Final Fantasy a ridiculous amount and do some trombone practice. What fun I have. Anyway.  *clicks tongue* This bit of holiday would be made a lot better if I didn't live in a different town to most of my friends who are also off... Tom and the Pates crew are all still at school until mid-July so I've got a while before I can meet up with any of them really... well, in school days, anyway. Fiddledeedee. What if they came back, and I'd died of being alone? They'd all be crying "Oh no, why did we leave Jon alone, with no friends?" And I'd be laughing. Laughing from my grave. Heh heh heh.  ...  If you didn't know, that was a Simpsons quote.  ...  DON'T LOOK AT ME!!! DON'T LOOK AT ME!!!  Quote of the day: "Children, don't do what I have done. I couldn't walk, but I tried to run...

       Hello from a rather Year 11-filled computer room.  OK, so I've got my difficult...er chemistry exam in an hour and a half, and am I revising? The answer lies in the fact that I'm sitting here posting, I think... I am going to crash and burn in this exam (despite this being the science I'm good at) and I don't really care. Really bad attitude, I know, but still... this is one of the subjects that I'm not going to keep doing (as with all the sciences) so as long as I pull a B I'm fine.  Got an email from Rhi today - weee! That cheered me up immensly, because it was a welcome break from shiteing myself because of the impending doom of the dreaded Chemistry exam. Oh, and I got my developed film in town just before I came in, and it's utter bollocks, really. There are like 10 actual properly developed photos, and then the rest just... well, aren't there. Shall have to look at the CD to see if any of the others work. Got a good pic of Scott but that's about it.  I leave you with news that, somewhere in Liverpool, a young boy from Bermuda is having a large amount of success in terms of his relationship with the female version of me. I wish them both the best of luck, that is unless I go to Liverpool, where I expect them to break up immediately and let me go out with Pip, the woman ^_^.

       Right, OK, Facebattle sucks muchly. Seriously. Taking-the-biscuit. 1, you have to pay to be able to do anything just about; 2, those people who decide to pay a lot can stop you from talking to someone; 3, you have to pay to even be able to read the mail you get sent. Hate. I'm mm089, by the way.  I was completing a form yesterday (not one for facebattle) and it had a 'Marital Status' question. I figured that I didn't fit any of them - the usuals were there, 'Single and not looking', 'Single and looking', 'dating', 'long-term relationship', 'married' and 'divorced'. For one thing, why is divorced one? It's like if you're divorced, you can only be with divorced people, and that you're a member of a special 'divorced' club. What a question. Anyway, the real thing is that, when I really think about it, I don't fit into any of them - I'm 'single and letting things slide'. I put 'Single and looking'. I'm not just letting things slide with  one  person here.  Anyway, thanks for your kind comments on the sting (or rather, your nasty comments about the wasp), the swelling's gone down a lot and I can use the finger now. It's still a little painful to bend and quite sore around the area, but it's much better. Nice to know that if I get stung by a wasp I've got people who will swear bloody murder on it, even if it did die.  Question of the day: if you didn't know, how old would you think I am? I'm interested in this, mostly because I'm  that  vain but still, opinion is sharply divided (Scott, I know that's in a song you sung, don't do it, ye fool). Laura says that she quite often forgets I'm younger than her, Nikki doesn't ever really have an opinion on it, cause her feelings on my age change constantly, and most people I meet tend to think I'm in the sixth form. Only once or twice have people asked me how Uni's going.  Physics exam was OK, but in true me-style I'm going to say nothing more on it.  Marital status: Single and not bad enough to stop being so.  Quote of the day: "In a sweet little village, remote and obscure, A beautiful maiden resided. As to whether or not her intentions were pure, Opinion was sharply divided."

       The comic remarks about how I have things living in my hair were, 10 minutes ago, brought into very sharp focus (with some irony) when a wasp became entangled in it. In the great tradition of wasps, this one was not particularly helpful and did not buzz its frustration home to me, but let me reach back, run my fingers through my hair in the bored way I do, and meet the tail of the wasp in a rather painful way. I cringed, pulled my hand back, heard a buzzing and swore quietly to myself in real agony before walking fairly quickly to the toilet, where I smeared the affected index finger with hand creme. I didn't care whether it was acid or alkali, I just smeared it on and prayed it would neutralise; here it seemed luck was on my side. Or, so I thought. As I looked at myself in the mirror, regarding my rather pained expression, I heard a buzzing again next to my ear and fell to my knees on the toilet floor - I had not yet been rid of the wasp (this is what proved to me that it was a wasp, not a bee), and now it wanted revenge on my neck. I squatted there for what seemed an age, while the wasp angrily buzzed around, and then I slowly stood up, removing my blazer. Once again my luck sported a brief appearance and the wasp had walked onto my blazer. I picked up the blue cloth and flicked it, sending the insect into the air. It buzzed towards the ceiling and got electricuted by the faulty light. That'll show it. I think the calmness with how I approached first the librarian (I wanted to find out if she knew what to do about wasp stings) and then the receptionist is a credit to how little I panic in general, although the index finger on my left hand is now swollen, the major difference between the affected and unaffected digits being that, unbent, my knuckle skin lies flat against my finger normally; whereas my swollen finger's knuckle juts out around half a centimetre... which is a fair way when you consider it doesn't normally do that. I can also only bend it slightly, as a result of the swelling. Fiddle-dee-dee.  Love, Jon Roskilly

       OK, it was a good weekend, only because yesterday was great, and today was meh. But yeah, shall bore you all with a routine... actually, I'm not going to be that mean. As usual will do the main points. Cause I still love you and don't want you to die of boredom.  Got up at 10...ish, took half an hour to get alive, so was in the shower at 10:30... until midday O_o. Longest-shower-ever-ever. Seriously, where most people have water marks on their fingers, I had bloody craters. Either meaning of bloody. Anyway, was hungry but it was lunchtime, and we had no readily cookable food so I went over Somerfields and got a Pot Noodle and some curry sauce. And this is the remarkable bit - I made my own curry! I even cooked the chicken (which we had before I went out, but it's horrible on its own, isn't it?), and it was lovely, and I'm still alive and not blind. Jon's verdict - good, but for an hour and a half's work, I'm not sure whether it would have been better just to have got a ready meal. Meh, satisfied though. I managed to make my own food rather than rely on Bird's Eye. The rhyme is mildly unintentional.  OK, then did trombone practice, which was actually better than usual. If I got pissed off with something I just left it (as a result of the last 2 days of practice getting so stressed that I was almost brought to tears by not being able to play the F# scale, which is surprisingly easy on the trombone i_i), and that didn't happen a lot. Even got the Db at the end of Saint-Saëns' Cavatine (which, for your information, is v. high)... admitedly not at double f but it's still impressive... I think... I'm sure 7 year old pre-grade-1 me would be floored from the shock.  Band practice started at 6 *shudders*. We had an extra guitarist, Marci, who is really good but threatened Tobin a little, I feel, so the guitar sound was a little odd, and a drummer who is immense at metal was Ben's stand-in, but as a result of this being ALL HE CAN BLOODY PLAY I'm sensing he's possibly the drummer I know that I'd consider to be the worst. At speed of fills and such, he's unrivalled (except perhaps by Adam), but he has no concept of appropriatness. In 'Peace', he did a metal beat. I ask you. He did a metal beat in Imagine. Die, die, die. Imagine all the people killing him for ruining one of the best songs in history. Gah. I can't work under these conditions. Try singing without mic over a drummer who drowns you out when you're full volume on the PA. Twit. To put it mildly.  Anyway, am in school tomorrow, so I don't have to rely on mum taking me in for my trombone lesson. She still has to pick me up, mind... I dunno, can do some revision for Physics and then hang about with Scott for a bit. Win-win.  Not sure why, but am missing Rhi...  Quote of the day: "You may say I'm a dreamer, But I'm not the only one. I hope someday you will join us; Then the world will live as one."

       Actually pretty good day. I have precious few so I'm rather overalled... it sounds overly romantic to say I'd like to live today every week of my life but it was a good day. I owe this mostly to 3 people:    Jazz   Nikki   Laura    Reasons why will be explained post haste. Chronologically, of course. Why, when people look back on this in years to come, I want them to understand my emotions of the day. Actually, no, I just want to be boring and set out, leave me alone i_i.  Had CAYO this morning, which was, although not musically better than usual really, was socially better, in that I made less of a tit of myself, made jokes which people laughed at, didn't feel as outcast in the group of my peoples, and got some hugs of Jazz which she owed me. Being hugged gets me in a good mood in general so that was a nice start to the day - thanks my love *hugs*.  Then was off to Nikki's party, which was good after my mum and myself got lost trying to find the arsing place. I texted Laura who told me it was in Withington, which was surprisingly helpful (no sarcasm), but there our luck kinda ended, on account of not actually knowing what end of Withington, what road, or... basically anything about where Nikki lived. Bugger. Found out later that Laura had got lost too... about as much help as an ashtray on a motorbike, that girl :P. Anyway, spent a long (by long, I mean couple of hours type long) just phaffing about on the piano and guitar and such, and generally being the life and soul of the party (here, there IS sarcasm. It's a fine balance.)... course, it took me nigh on an hour and a half after Laura entering for me to drum up the courage to talk to her... this is the me-being-paranoid-about-being-me thing again. The real ice breaker was me sucking at badminton so much that I let someone take my place and thought I couldn't do anything worse than I'd played it (it was fun, but I still suck), so I went and talked to Laura who offered me a seat, which I willingly accepted and filled for a couple of hours. Talking to, and seeing Laura, was really cool again, so that was really funky. Got tired and kinda lent on her a bit, which I'm not sure if she minded or not but it seemed not so I just kinda was comfy. Nikki is also  surprisingly  good at the piano. I say surprisingly because she's never mentioned it to me. Oh well, well done her, she's better than me :(. Then again I'm not all that good, so I'm not really that depressed *ties noose into rope*.  Also ended up talking to Brendan a fair bit, convinced Will that his name was Matt (he looks like a Matt, I tells ya), and discussing male labour with John. For a group of L6 peoples, I think I managed rather well.  Also had a wee chat with Laura a bit ago about... well, you can guess. She said something to me that I thought I'd find really upsetting or depressing or whatnot but I'm surprisingly OK with it... I don't know. At the moment, it's clear to everyone what I wanna do, but I'm fine with life either making that happen or not making it happen in its own time. I don't need to be soppy and express all my feelings here, you all know them. If you don't, don't hesitate to ask, and I'll tell ya. Strange, really, that it didn't detract from a great day... in fact, she ended up making me feel a lot better about the whole thing. Love ya.

       OK, just to point out, what Laura says about being able to bribe me to tell her when I post so she can have first comment is strictly true because of how immensly gorgeous she is. Tom, you're great, but you lack in the being a woman element. Although a good competitor I feel this may work against you!  Love, Jon Roskilly

       My head is marginally ow. In one word: waaaah.  I got the letter from the NYO this morning - I've an audition in September. Hussah! BUT (and this is the big smegger) the piece I can play really well and was going to do is actually 4 minutes too short for me to do it. Words cannot describe...  Only got 3 GCSEs left. I am suddenly struck with a deep sense of forboding. Ahhhh. What if I managed to screw up every exam I've done? I've only got 3 left, and so that's a lot to have smegged up. Um... oh dear. I'm sure I've done OK... am I?  I really can't think of that much to blog! Hence me not blogging before. Oh, the experiment is going... well, it isn't. If anything, it's going slower than a snail pulling a supertanker. And supertankers are quite big in comparison to snails.  Also, Lisa is as close to my webdesign idol as any can be. Put simply, she does what I want to be able to do. Basically, her site is accessible easily on my connection, but still looks good. Adam, however, seems to think that all websites should only be acessible for people on broadband, and while his websites look stunning most of the time, I have to say I prefer the ability to actually load a webpage. Well done Lisa.  Quote of the day: "On with the motley, The paste, and the powder. The people pay thee, And want their laugh, you know!"  From   On With the Motley   From Leoncavallo's opera   I.

       Experiment HDWF (or 'Experiment Hard Woof') is underway. Damned if I'm going to tell you (unless 'you' is Stanners, who I usually talk to about this kind of thing) what HDWF stands for, but this is possibly going to be the longest-running experiment of my lifetime, so... I'm not even sure it's going to answer anything, and any results can hardly be conclusive. At the moment, a couple of possible results seem to be shying away a tad. What have I got to lose?  NJaN practices are going well, and I'd say that currently "Blueshift" is out of the running as a bandname as a result of Tom cleverly pointing out that some "witty" people might call us "Bluesh*t" (I don't usually censor my blog, but in this case, I want people to be able to read that at school without feeling like I've gone off on a tangent). So at the present moment I'd say it was between these;     Aten   Not Just a Number (still in there but I don't see it being in there for much longer,  for possible legal reasons)   Nuts and Bolts    Perhaps I've missed a couple, and if so, Tom'll be sure to post the ones I've forgotten. I've had a couple of ideas but in retrospect they're pretty poor so I'm not really going to submit them. I think from now on, we have to really nit-pick at our own pieces so we can make the EP as good as possible. We've really got to do an over-perfectionist tutor job here.  Oh, and in other news, the solo with CYB went well (not as well as I'd hoped, but still well), as did the trombone quartet, and Susie came to watch which was lovely. I don't usually have anyone to talk to. Spotted Sam in amongst the crowd... which was odd, 2ce in 2 days. Must be my lucky weekend. As can be expected, I've burned quite badly on my forearms (despite wearing a long-sleeved shirt), hands, and face, despite putting on whole globules of sun block. Hoorah. My record of never going out in the sun for anything more than 20 minutes without burning is intact.  Quote of the day: "Imagine no posessions. I wonder if you can?

       Blueshift is the name of an organisation, "The Blueshift Group", who link to blues acts across a various range, and the name of the most famous album by the band "Splashdown". Is that enough to not keep it as a real prospect? In my view, no, I'm still keen on it, and there isn't (as far as I can find) a band called Blueshift. If there is, then there are plenty more colours. Like magenta. Magentashift.  A couple more I thought of; VIW - Very Important World Mice and Men  Love, Jon Roskilly

       Alright, I know I haven't posted since Tuesday... vultures, you lot. Vultures from... a country where all the people are constantly asking for more. America. Vultures from America. So, the Republicans, basically.  Simply speaking, the exams seem to be going pretty well at the moment. I don't want to go into too much detail, cause then I'd find things to get me depressed and stressed over them, and I don't particularly want that.  Saw Zoe while I was doing my paper round and she is looking über-good. With a v.v cool jacket thing, which has a hoody with ears on. Love. Nah, seriously, Zoe = attractive as ever.  And I'm beginning to figure out why I have no luck with romance (putting aside the lack of common sense).  Oh, and a possible band name - Blueshift. Out of the ones we have, that's my favourite, but I dunno. Up to the 5 of us.  Quote of the day: "My clean land, There's one who understands. A friendly soul, Lasting life in your hand."

       Currently balancing the metal thing with a loop at the end on my shoulder, which takes a surprising amount of concentration. I've never actually used it, but it's for clearing water from my trombone. You put a rag in the loop. But still, sorry if I typo this entry, the metal thing is cylindrical, just over a metre long, and with a diameter of less than a centimetre. Not even to mention that one end's heavier than the other.  Biology exam went quite well I think but I don't want to talk about it much.  Sorry, can't concentrate, this is an immense task. I'll see if I can blog later. Wooo.  Love, Jon Roskilly

       Rather worried that I'm becoming more Marius than Jon... last night was the Les Mis reunion which was fun enough (as can be expected I spent a lot of time just drifting and being me, what else is new?), but somehow (I know not how) I managed to get quite... friendly with Susie... by friendly I don't mean like groping and such but there was much leaning on each other and such. Oddness. Liv wasn't there *annoyed about that*. We watched the recording of the dress rehearsal and looking at the scenes between Marius and Eponine I just looked at the television, heard myself, saw my actions, and stuttered my way through saying "That is NOT me.". Before Les Mis I was very nervous about being huggy with women, but now... definitely a certain amount of Marius has become me. I worry about how much. Which may come across as strange - I worry about how much my personality is changing from... well, me, to someone who pretty much every person who has the slightest romantic interest in men falls in love with. But I do.  The Bill Bailey poster is sitting in pride of place next to my Gr.8 Distinction certificate (I don't care, I can still be smug about it after a long time ^_^). In't he great? Seriously, unforgettable night.  Something for Laura to be perhaps a bit jolly about - this morning at Andrea's we were watching MTV and such (they wouldn't let me watch Kerrang (thanks be to Zoë for introducing me to the station in the first place, love you)) and This Love came on and the group of 6/7 of us all sang along to the chorus when it came around... we didn't know anything else but the chorus was fun. When it came arou, hownd.  Back to exams tomorrow, with Biology. Aaaaaah.  Quote of the day: "The bombs go off, don't make a sound. How many people were around?

       I possibly suck more than anyone else ever in the history of the universe. More on that story later.  Anyway, about Bill Bailey on Thursday. He was über-superb, he really was. I don't think there was anyone in the audience who wasn't pissing themselves for pretty much the whole night. Not because they were all really old, Bill was v.v. funny. A lot of it was hysterical as a Baileyism but if I were to repeat it, or were anyone to repeat it, I imagine it'd be unthinkably less funny. His comic timing (and his electronics (such as the Wooo machine)) was flawless. Well done to both him and the tech crew at the Town Hall.  OK, people who don't play Final Fantasy, or people who do but haven't yet got round to FFX, skip this section cause it won't make sense. Today, on a shadow of a thought, I did the chocobo race at Remiem Temple, attempting to get 3 chests and finish the race first. After about 6 attempts (deliberately slower to work out the chests I woulod have to get to be able to do it), I managed it, to find my prize to be 30 Wings to Discovery. Which means I gave Auron armour with Break HP Limit. Funfun, now he's got 23,947HP. Of course after catching 10 of every capturable monster in the game (100 species, so that's 1000 indvidual monsters to catch), I had 99 Dark Matters, which means Auron also has Ribbon on that piece of armour, so he has the ultimate armour there, really, doesn't he? Got Wakka's celestial weapon today as well... funny thing with that is that I wasn't expecting him to do 80,000 damage. He's been doing 9,999 for ages and ages so seeing him do that much was a bit of a shock, really. Oh, and I don't know why, but it appears that I currently have a lack of a hardest boss in the game. Instead of having Nemesis in the "Original" creations, I have a blank, which when selected is replied to with "He's not ready yet!". Curious. Very curious. Oh, and something else I didn't expect is that Barbatos, the big guy with arms inside Sin, gives you far more levels than Varona, the "Area Conquest" creation for inside Sin, who is basically Barbatos but with more health, dealing more damage, and an immunity to armour break. What? Ah well. At least I know who to train up against. I bought 99 Clear Spheres from the training centre guy, so once I've finished the Sphere grid with everyone (I'd imagine some time next year) I'll use those. If anyone can tell me without looking at a guide or FAQ where you get some of the stat spheres from, that'd be v. helpful. At the moment I'm just wasting my money bribing things. Tried to bribe Barbatos with 3 million. That didn't work. I was livid.  Hello again, people who aren't complete geeks. Actually, most people would probably have read that anyway out of spite, thinking "What the hell?" through the duration. Oh well.  Anyway, translate this if you will, it has some reference to the geeky section above; E's cunno, Myiny... E teth'd sayh du syga drehkc tevvelimd un lusbmelydat un cdnaccvim un yhodrehk...

       Following the talk over NJaN's name change, I'm going to write this entry.  As the majority of you will know, my goal is to go through the Royal College of Music and become a full-time trombonist with possibly the Royal Philharmonic. However, my dream is to be famous as the singer for a rock band. See it as immature if you will, I don't know. It's a dream. Every song we get together, every song we complete, and every time we add another to our list of songs to record, it feels like the dream becomes more and more possible. My belief is that if I am going to do it with any band, NJaN is probably the one with the most chance. But I'm not sure we could quite make it with Peugeot's trademark.

       ...What's happened with Blogger? Um... hate. What the hell did they do here? If you don't use blogger you won't know what I mean but I get what Zoe meant by WYSIWYG now. *shudders* &nbsp; Anyway, what's been going on? Work experience went well on the whole, I think next time I go into DSP they'll be all "Hey, Jon, how's it going?" and I'll be all "I really shouldn't be here!". But I digress. Return&nbsp; ... Planet was also good, although I'm not 100% on whether I'll be getting the cheque for that. Arse. Had a concert today with GYWO, went well, and got on well with Aynsley (apparently that's how you spell her name&nbsp;O_o)&nbsp;and have made a new friend in Emily. Woo. More lovely ladies for the tour. Well, at the moment mostly Meg, Aynsley, and Emily, but you know... &nbsp; Speaking of lovely&nbsp;ladies, went to see the Cheltenham-Birmingham match on Saturday with Laura and&nbsp;Gem, and it was pretty cool. We drew with a premiership side, which is not bad. I missed our goal because mum happened to phone me just before. Bloody typical. But yeah, was cool to watch, cause I could actually see what was going on, and was with more than just myself, rather than like last time. Might go more often if that would be my company. Said goodbye to Laura for the next couple of weeks, cause I'm off, and felt really sad about that. Will miss everyone but you know... &nbsp; Oh yeah, while it occurs, cause I've got the Belgium tour and then the Orchestra course, don't really expect bloggage before the 1st of August. It'll be a really long post then, I promise. Tell you all about it (and whether I pulled (joking...ish)). &nbsp; Quote of the day: "Come home, my darling,  I&nbsp;know that&nbsp;you know that I want you here, Come home, my darling, come home, I want you here."

        Work Experience Day 3   Was actually pretty cool today. Played on an electric drum kit, did some piano practice, learnt how to use the tills, and did some trumpet duets with Ed, so that was cool. Oh, and did the Rimsky-Korsakov with the piano guy, Louis. He sight-read it O_O. Git. Played it better than Mr. T, too.  It's the summer concert tomorrow. My, is that going to be crap. None of the groups have practiced basically at all, so the only half decent things are going to be the solos, of which I'm doing 2. Phut. Dunno, all the fun's gone out of it, I wonder why... oh, that's it, yeah, I'm 4 grade standards above the music groups at school. Phut.  Almost to the stage where I'm counting down the hours to the tour. I mean, I won't be seeing everyone (not going to list them because people might get offended I didn't put their name first, even though it's probably obvious) for a couple of weeks (got the orchestra course straight after) but I'm spending a week completely with Meg and Ainsley and Bradley and peoples and it'll rule. I'm closer to Meg but I love Ainsley, she's brilliant. Hooray for Blackadder fans.  Quote of the day: "Said the shepherd boy to the mighty King, Do you know what I know?

        Work Experience Day 2   Um... I dunno, today was much the same as yesterday, and as a result I got very bored. The only real difference is that they only let 2 of us go for lunch (being the gentleman I am I let the 2 younger guys go) and then let me go an hour later. Lame. I dunno, it wasn't such a good day.  Got back to find I had 6 emails (2 are from the telegraph so they don't count), and... the other 4 are all about NJAN's recording possibilities in August. 3 were from Tom, and 1 from a studio in Cheltenham that Tobin recommended. I dunno, that one seems cool.  I'm really tired, and I've gotta go to Winchcombe tonight. Bleh.

        Work Experience Day 1   Duck, Son + Pinker is a cool place to have work experience. Not only am I doing it with Ed from CYB, we had a grand total of... oh, probably an hour's work, then we spent the entire rest of the time playing on the keyboards, pianos, and guitars. Rock on.  In other news... oh, wait, there isn't any, really... *thinks* Well, Laura's coming round on Saturday, which'll be cool, gave Mr. T the piano accompaniment to Empty Chairs today, so that he can do it on Thursday, and been thinking about the non-bald person of those 2 rather a lot.

Planet is taking up a lot of my time so I am all... busy.  Went into town with Susie yesterday, which was quite cool. We ended up not actually really going into any shops (save Ottakars and Café Roma), but we still managed to fill about 5 hours just walking around. Woo. It rained though so we had to go under a tree, then we realised there was lightning, so we went to the café bit of the Lido. 'Tis all fun. Saw about 30 people I knew in town, including Jazz and Chris from GYWO who I seem to see EVERYWHERE. Ah well. 'Twas cool anyhow.  ...work experience in Duck Son + Pinker starts tomorrow. Ee.

Um, Return to the Forbidden Planet is weird because playing 2 guitars and a trombone (no, not all at once) is complicated. Can't think of much else.  Sorry that it's so short.

       Reasonable time since I last posted. Not great, though... OK, not great. More... mediocre or mildly upsetting interspersed with good and very good.  Jo's dad is a dude, and his party was cool. Had a pint of bitter and a tropical Bacardi so I was hardly barely altered but I had some interesting conversations with Shez and Seg about alternative uses for vegetables and the like. Oh, we played well too *shrugs*. I wandered off in the middle of 'Are You Gunna be my Girl?' though, so... um... what? It's showmanship. Yeah.  After catching the train back to Cheltenham my mum decided she was going to come and pick me up from town and so I lay on a bench for a while and people thought I was a hobo. Todd walked past and I did the rising thing and scared him. Talked to him for a bit. Todd's cool. But yeah, mum didn't turn up so I had to phone her and make her take me to Gloucester. Then I went to Ross... basically I hadn't been back home for 2 days. Whoopdeedoo.  Saw Meg and Ainsley at the GYWO rehearsal, even though they didn't actually turn up for the rehearsal, just the meeting afterwards. Meg's off to Sri Lanka for a couple of weeks so I'm not gunna see her for a bit. Should be someone I can talk to lots in Holland, which is cool, cause she's nice and fun. Hooray.  Had day 1 of the 6th form induction today. Meh, the guy taking it was cool enough but he didn't say a lot for the amount he said. You know.... he spent 3 hours saying about 5 minutes worth of material, that sort of thing.  *sighs* It was pretty good on events. It's me thinking that's made it worse.

       Really good day, in all! 2nd this year only to Nikki's party, and not by much.  Let's be honest, the day looked as if it was going to be cack. I woke up to the rain hammering against my window. It cleared while I was having a shower, though, and I went into Pates at lunchtime (I caught the 94, finding it actually doesn't stop THAT near Pates... damn), and Fi was v. happy to see me (I'm not sure whether this was the main highlight, but it was lovely, and Fi's great, so wuvoo Fi), and so Dave, Fi, Todd and I (wait for it)... toddled off to the music room, where Fi and then Dave showed off their piano skills. Rebs and Celia came in, which was cool, cause I think Rebs doesn't hate me, same with Celia. Then Nikki came in, which was cooler still. As I left I got a nice hug from Fi and Nikki kissed my shoulder *confused look*. Ooh, and Lizza (not Becca, as I said on the previous post about her, sorry, it's LIZZA) gave me a nice hug too, and she rules. One of these days Lizza and I are going to actually get to know each other! Anyway, saw Libby on the way out tooo, and she gave me a hug too. Good time for hugs. She trundled off to find Tobin.  OK, so, thought was "Ah, that was nice, so, off to town to be bored for an hour or so until the practice". I was wrong, thankfully. I saw N'omi and Rose, Chris, and... Laura in town. Seriously. Laura scared me to hell, though, she ran up behind me as I was going into Regents' Arcade and tapped me on the back. Almost gave me me a heart attack. But still, after almost having an attack, my heart did that cartoon thing where it came out of my chest. Well, no, but you know what I mean. Then went to Shez's with t'band. That was cool, it went OK, and we did a thrash version of Living on a Prayer! W00t! Oh, and I walked home with Segye, and we made fun of car number plates - example: L296 TVA became the squadron car for the Transvestites' Association. Yay! Then after I got back I got a reply to my email to this oh-so-cute woman on Facebattle, who thinks I'm her 'perfect guy' and I await being able to talk to her on AIM... w00t. Seriously, she seems cool... really pretty... yay!  That's purely people-based; I also bought Maroon 5's single version of 'This Love', which rocks, and I've now got the video of it as a result of it being on the CD, and that rocks completely and utterly... and the 2 bonus tracks rule too. I also got Michael Jackson's 'Off The Wall' ...he was still black when he made that... I dunno, it's not sooo great but then I did get it for £3.  The only mild marr on the day was the fact that the prawn mayo sandwich I got from Woolworth's wasn't great...

       Finished Simon the Sorcerer 1 today... shall have to look for something more to do at some point. Like get even further on FFX. Dunno.  Met up with Adele, Ig, Elsie, Rosie, Rose, Digby, Jed, Joel and Alastair in town today. 'Twas cool. Also saw Moth, who stole my purple shirt. She did promise me she'll get it back to me somehow, though, so that's cool ^_^. I like Moth, she's all huggy. Actually, Elsie was really nice today. What she said to me a couple of times was "You should meet up with us again, you're funny, I like you". Which is nice. Pity she's too young for her opinion to count for much but still (she's going into Year 10 next year, bless). Meh, it was cool today anyway. Ig is useful to use as a pillow, whereas I am useless and kept telling Rose that she wasn't as old as she said she was, which made everyone think I was mean but... she looks really young. Good, just young. OK, that came out badly, sodd off. Yes, 2 ds. It's the Welsh spelling.  Saw the NYO on't Telly tonight. They rule. Think, I'm going to be in them next year (I'm thinking happy thoughts, happy wonderful thoughts that involve me being all over-confident).

Did trombone practice, discovered I'm still not entirely the greatest man in Britain at scales, but you know... they're actually incredibly important. Damn. Ack, forgot to do my lip exercises as well. Naughty Jon. *sighs* Oh well, shall have to do about half an hour of them tomorrow. Opportunity to make up some new ones.  I'm good, thanks, Laura, just busy. I like it. Mind is occupied.  Quote of the day: "You let my hand go, And you fake a smile for me. I have a feeling you don't know what to do.

       I've got John Rutter's 'Pie Jesu' on in the background while I write this, which is nice. Lalala.  Did piano AND trombone practice today, rather than just piano. Discovered I have 2 rather sizeable dents in my trombone slide. Bugger. Makes it a surprising amount harder to play demi-semiquavers. Oh well. Spent until about 1AM yesterday talking to Susie and Naomi before I got tired and went to bed. Meh.  Tom's gone to Center Parcs and so doesn't know that I'm going to meet the guy from the recording studio to discuss things and such on Tuesday. Oh well. I'm pretty confident about Hollow Altar being good in terms of what we need, what I'm LESS confident about is the printing being cheap. The only thing more expensive printing means really is that the cost of the CD will go up to cover it but A: We don't wanna have to put the price to about £10 just to get a tiny profit from each and B: We don't wanna have to make Jude pay lots and lots. I've gotta ring round a few places once I've worked out how many pages the insert's going to be, and made a design for the sleeve. Work.  I wonder if Lennon ever had this problem.

       What have I done today? Woke up, went into town with Scott, gave him present, he liked, saw Phil's daughter Cerri with Joel, bought Simon the Sorcerer, came home, washed my trombone, did some practice, went to Les Mis reunion/random workshoppy thing, talked a lot to Rhiannon and the Johnstones, played on Simon the Sorcerer, came online.  *sighs*  How do I feel after that?  I'll get back to you on that one.  Quote of the day: "California, California, You're such a wonder that I think I'll stay in bed.

       Gah.  Was expecting to get my new trombone today, to discover that I need to get it through the school, and as such it may not be possible for me to get it until September. Balls. Have to go into school next Monday to see the bursar about it, that being the earliest that he's in. Bugger.  Spent last night at Joe's, it was OK until I went to sleep, then everything went haywire it would seem and Scott had to wake me up cause he needed a hand clearing up vomit and stopping Marx, Joe and Adam from dying, and I got stung, by a wasp, on my foot. I was not pleased. Oh well.  Really wanna meet up with either Laura, Fi, or Nikki... the shock may come as the one I most wanna meet up with is Nikki because I haven't seen her for an age but I'd really like to see any of them to be honest.  Fragmented post, I apologise.  I did an hour's piano practice today, and I suck. Seriously, if I pass my Grade 7 I'll be lucky. I'm having to completely learn how to do scales properly, and I've gotta teach myself how to do thirds and such and I've still to choose a B piece... this all with the exam at Christmas. And I need the new trombone really quickly so I have a chance of getting used to it before the audition. Balls.  Haven't had much sleep, am feeling lonely, and apprehensive about the amount of work I have to do.  Quote of the day: "Cigarettes and chocolate milk, These are just a couple of my cravings. Everything, it seems, I like's a little bit stronger, A little bit fatter, A little bit harmful for me."  From Rufus Wainwright's   Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk     Love, Jon Roskilly

       Don't know what to say about the last 2 weeks. Different. Definitely different.  The Holland tour was sehr cool, even though I didn't really get on with anyone fantastically well. Got on with Meg and Aynsley well, as could be expected, got on OK with Emily for the first couple of days then she seemed to shy away a bit, got on with Bradley and the 2 Chrisses far better than I'd expected and was shocked to find that I was talking to Matt McDade rather a lot. Miller got H-A-M-M-E-R-E-D. I was very sensible, I had about 2 beers a night. No drunkeness for me. As a result I got a bit isolated, as shown by myself going into my room and headbanging along to Sonata Arctica on the last night. We played well, I managed to on the whole avoid the majority of sunburn, and I constantly felt like stealing Aynsley and going to live with her in a small house somewhere. For she is fun. All in all, the tour was good, despite a complete lack of me pulling. Not that that was ever my intention. But yeah, was cool... can't think of much more about Holland.  The orchestra course... was unusual. Got on with lots of people but no-one spectacularly well. Late nights were commonly spent by Dave Smith, Digby and myself talking about things in one of the rooms. Met a gorgeous girl called Beth who apparently is slightly more free with herself than I'd like but she was part of the contingent who thought I was hot (don't ask)... I let it slip away, I wouldn't have been able to trust that she wasn't already going out with someone. Ate a rather large amount of Galaxy, sucked at bowling (but ruled on the Dance game, I got an A on Standard ^_^), played the trombone a lot, sang a bit, did a couple of duets and made the orchestra piss themselves when I did the optional narration in one of the practices for "Star Trek through the years". Can now also read alto clef, which is a bonus. Got on with Sam a lot better than I'd thought I would have done (that is, she didn't attempt to stab me), and as a result was quite pleased with that. I spent a lot of time feeling very much the outsider but why change the habit of a lifetime? The times when I was involved fully in the social life I tended to make everyone piss themselves so... I don't know, I think I came off  pretty well. Last night we (Jed, Burt, Dave, Digby, Ellis, Joel and I) stayed up eating Pringles, talking, and doing comic things with cream (Dave spurted all over my face shortly after Jed let loose on my groinal region of my trousers). I did my impression  of Hitler doing his Nürnberg speech  in Swedish  and did the Star Trek narration with the volume control buggered (as in "Sp..ce... th... al... t...er" etc.) and 'twas all in fun. Met Phil Cowley's daughter. She's nice, in both meanings. Too good at the trumpet. There were 8 of them. Far too many. Anyway, yeah, the Orchestra Course was a barrel of laughs but I'm also quite glad to be away and back to sanity for a while.  You may have noticed that in both weeks I had a kind of running theme of trying to score... it's kinda because I'm trying to kinda... 'slide', I guess. Just... I don't think, even if I was about to score, that I could. I'd feel guilty somehow, like it'd be against common decency for me to do so. I don't know how long I'm going to keep myself single for. The problem is that I know why I'm doing it, so it's harder to stop it.  Quote of the day: "So you think you can stone me, And spit in my eye? So you think you can love me, And leave me to die?"
