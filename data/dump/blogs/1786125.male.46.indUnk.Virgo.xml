      Another attempt to hack the system. It seems to be working fine.  Oh, and I hammered out 2,000 words last night on magazine articles. They're like candy.

      I'm heading off to  urlLink Comic-Con International  on Friday. I'll be there through Sunday night. Stop by the  urlLink Green Ronin  booth to say hi, to try to track me down.   I'll be at  urlLink Gen Con  in Indianpolis in a few weeks too. My schedule for that is getting fuller by the day. Once again, I'll be in the  urlLink Green Ronin  booth, running demos of  urlLink Dracula's Revenge , my new board game from  urlLink Human Head Studios . For all the gory details, visit the  urlLink Upcoming Appearances  section of my website at  urlLink Forbeck.com .   In the meantime, don't forget to look for  urlLink Secret of the Spiritkeeper , my new novel from  urlLink Wizards of the Coast . It should be in stores in early August.

      Welcome to the Alliterate News Journal.  The Alliterates are a writer's group founded nearly ten years ago by J. Robert King in the Lake Geneva, Wisconsin area. Most of its initial members were employees of legendary game company TSR, Inc, and not only wrote games and novels for that company, but helped create some of the company's best-known shared universes. The particular Alliterates are noted to the left, and a number of them have their own web pages and blogs.  Since its founding, the group has grown and evolved, and its member-authors have moved on to new challenges, but the Alliterates have always served as a common touchstone for our band. Some of the group have relocated to Seattle, and new members have taken their place in the original Lake Geneva organization. The Seattle members have in turn formed their own branch of the Alliterates, and inducted new members. In addition, we have individual Alliterates living in Texas and Georgia as well, but through the magic of the mojo wire known as the Internet, we still stay in touch.  Until recently, part of that connectivity was provided by the  urlLink Alliterates  web site, which is currently down (but will return in the near future). While the site has been down, our lives have moved on - we've seen some projects come to fruition, others getting started, and in one case, one of our group becoming the President of GAMA. The purpose of this online journal is to give us a place where we can stay in touch with each other and our fans, and tell folk what we're up to.  So tune in. Here's where we will announce new projects, contracts signed, manuscripts delivered, new releases, nice reviews, convention appearances, convention reports, and other news of the day. We can be reached by email  urlLink here , and our specially-trained armadillo will get your message to the correct Alliterate.  Welcome aboard.

      Well, that's a little egotistical, don't you think? Ah well, it's good to make a grand entrance, I always say.  Anyway, on with the news ... I'm currently working like heck to finish a young adult novel for Wizards of the Coast's "Dragonlance: The New Adventures" series. I'm woefully behind schedule (read: "Already late") and trying to get caught up as quickly as humanly possible. Of course, my work for The Game Mechanics (www.thegamemechanics.com) keeps getting in the way, as does the beautiful summer weather we've been enjoying here in the northwest.  What's on the horizon? I have a couple of smallish projects I'll be working on next—a few RPG adventures and a short story. But I'm trying to line up my schedule so that I can work on a larger personal project this fall. I'm just not sure WHICH project it will be. I've got a rough outline for a "fantasy noir" novel that I've been dying to write, but I've also been getting a hankering to put together a collection of stories about my time in Japan (maybe I could be the geeks' answer to David Sedaris). Only time will tell whether I'll work on those or one of the cartooning projects that are collecting dust on my drawing board. Feel free to chime in with opinions ... I'm an equal opportunity ignorer!  So THIS is what big time blogging feels like? Funny. I thought it would be ... I dunno ... more subversive or something.

      I can feel the power coursing through my fingers already. Watch out world, the dark days of blogger evil are about to begin.   Hey wait. Isn't this how dealers get their customers addicted to crack? The first blog is free, but once you're a slobbering, blithering blogger you're at their mercy.

      While the Alliterates don't have a website at the moment, this experiment into group blogs is turning out to be fascinating. I'm very glad to be involved.  On the news front, I've been voted in as GAMA President. GAMA, the Game Manufacturer's Association, is a game industry trade association. It runs both the Origins Game Convention in Columbus, OH and the GAMA Trade Show in Las Vegas, NV every year. I'm glad to be a part of it, but it's going to be a lot of work. Few people agree to what must be done, but everyone seems to have a strong opinion regardless. I'll weather it with a smile!  My company, Legio X, Inc. publishes MWAN Magazine (a historical miniatures magazine) for the gaming public. http://www.mwan-magazine.com. We're doing very well with it. The company just purchased a miniatures manufacturing company from Canada called True North Miniatures. We produce 15mm WWII Poles, Dutch, Belgians, Romanians, Hungarians, some French and some Soviets. It's neat stuff! We also do 1:144 scale WWII aircraft models. http://www.truenorthminis.com.  My own blog, over at Donskibeat, will give you attitudes and opinions. Drop in and I'll bore you to tears!  Donski

      Well, if all has worked right, this should be going up on the Allits blog page.  If it doesn't show up, I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.  Interesting connundrum... my "old" Netscape seems to handle the posting/membership page okay.+ But, last I looked, the actual page was almost unreadable.  The "new" netscape handles the actual blog page fine, but overprints the posting/membership page.  Am I going to have to use the hated Internet Exploder to work effectively here?  -- SDS

      Some of you realize that I'm publishing multimedia study guides on various books of the Bible. This combines my Ph.D. work and my years of work in both the publishing and computer game industry. I'm not going to abandon the Alliterates and quit "trying" to write fiction. (In fact, there are some in the group who may think that the Bible itself is.   I don't happen to be one of them, but I'm not out of sorts with those of you who might. In fact, as I point out in my Jonah study guide, I have lots of friends who see many of the narratives in the Bible as "just" stories without even a historical kernel.  So, I say that to say this. After moving to Georgia, while still living in a temporary apartment as we continued to look for a house, I went into panic mode to finish my Philippians study guide before I taught a seminar during the week after E3 (Electronic Entertainment Exposition) in Los Angeles. By the way, my satellite media tour (casually known as "Whore TV" because it includes some products that, though preselected by me, PAY for their representation) surpassed its 1 million viewer goal and nearly hit the 2 million mark, this year. Anyway, I was exhausted by the time I left for E3. Then, I came back and started preparing for the Christian Booksellers Association--International Exposition. Fortunately for me, it was held in Atlanta, last week. Unfortunately for me, it was almost like the CBA Advance in Indianapolis, earlier in the year, that was the most amazing Jesus Junk convention in the world. Think GenCon is weird? Try Calvary ties with three crosses on the hill, silver necklaces made of nails representing the passion, comic books and graphic novels based not only on biblical characters (like Brian Augustyn's new retelling of Joseph for the American Bible Society's Metron label), huge bronze sculptures of Jesus washing Simon Peter's feet, Christian trading cards, chocolate candy with scripture verses on them, and candles of every shape (and denomination). The book side of the convention also featured lots of titles, but most of them were of the Debunking the DaVinci Code (sic) and diet book (The Master's Diet) books. There were Christian cookbooks, children's books with cross-promotions for Jesus' dolls, Christian sex manuals, and lots and lots of lightweight "God wants to make you feel-good books." However, we talked to about 200 independent Christian bookstore managers and might even have some distribution deals lined up where we piggyback on larger publishers.  Of course, my message is primarily on sharing a similarity between the game and game book business and this new venture with which I am involved. Independent booksellers are just like "mom and pop" game store owners. They are lazy and unwilling to try anything new unless it is dropped in their laps. They complain about similar things. The bookstore managers at CBA whine about the fact that Wal-Mart can sell the big Christian sellers cheaper, but they don't make up for that Wal-Mart pricing with the kind of personal service and discovery of new boutique products that can make the difference. The "mom and pop" game store owners get upset because Magic, Pokemon, and Yu-gi-oh (sic--just a few months and look what happens to a guy's product knowledge) are sold in supermarkets and convenience stores, but do they want to get people hooked on L5R, Initial-D or anything different? Nope! They want the low-lying fruit without ever cultivating the orchard, trimming the trees, irrigating the fields or watching a smudge-pot on freeze night. Now, I've seen this pattern repeated in multiple industries: record stores losing out to chains and online; boutique wineries nabbed and ruined by large corporations, single-screen theaters wiped out by multiplexes; small game stores losing out to online discounters and discount stores; and now, Christian bookstores losing out to the Wal-Marts. What was it about those who refuse to learn the lessons of the past?   In future messages, I'll let you know about my culture shocks in the land of red dirt and confederate flags.

      The  urlLink Origins Awards  were held at  urlLink Origins  on June 24, 2004, in Columbus, OH. Three Alliterates brought home trophies (at least metaphorically, as the trophies were not quite ready yet).    Indy HeroClix  was named Game of the Year.  urlLink Jeff Grubb  handled the game's final design.    urlLink Steve Sullivan's  short story "Podo and the Magic Shield" was named Best Game-Related Fiction, Short Form.    The Redurst Academy of Magic  won two awards: Best Roleplaying Game Supplement and Best Graphic Design, Book Format.  urlLink Matt Forbeck  handled lead duties for both aspects of the book.   Congratulations to these Alliterates and all the other winners!

      Well, well, well ... let's see what's new and moderately exciting in the world of Stan!  I recently finished the first draft of my next novel, and only a few days after the publisher ( urlLink Mirrorstone Books ) announced the release date. The book is called  Dragon Day , it is part of the  Dragonlance: the New Adventures  series, and it should be in stores in March '05. In the meanwhile, I've got to get through the second draft (and my thanks go out to my fellow Alliterates for their comments on the work so far ... they've definitely given me some ideas on how to improve the book).  While I let  Dragon Day  settle in my mind, I'm working on a new modern d20 System supplement for  urlLink The Game Mechanics , a short story for  urlLink Malhavoc Press , some cartoon ideas for myself, and a rough outline for a fantasy noir novel I want to write sometime this fall. Oh, I'm also prepping in my head to write a pair of modern d20 System adventures, one for The Game Mechanics and the other for use at a convention in September (if it goes well, I may see if the  urlLink RPGA  is interested in it).  Oh yes, and I'll be going to  urlLink Gen Con  next week. I'll be spending most of my time in the  urlLink Green Ronin  booth, but I'll also be taking part in a  urlLink series of seminars . If you're going to be in Indianapolis next week, please stop by and say hi ... I get lonely sometimes.

      My new Planescape riff, a 224-pager called  Beyond Countless Doorways , was released yesterday in electronic form. The paper version hits the shelves in October. Billed as a "Planescape reunion," BCD brings together a lot of the creative team that launched and sustained that setting in the mid 90s. And I'm happy to say the newest batch of twisted Planescape design has turned out very well indeed — and this time, without the cant.  Give it a look at the  urlLink Malhavoc site , pick up a  urlLink copy online , or check out the  urlLink trailer . Yes, that's right, as in a Flash video trailer. I've never had a trailer before; I think I may just have to "go Hollywood" full-bore from here on in. We'll do lunch.

      Busy summer for me. I've got two books to finish up before the end of the season -- both adaptations (one movie, one anime) -- and, yet I'm still going to be at Wizardworld Chicago from August 13-15.  I'll be the tired-looking guy sharing the booth with RCHarvey (famed cartoonist). We'll be number 9071-A (unless the con folk change their minds). Drop by and say "Hi!"  This will be my  only  convention appearance this summer. (Or for the rest of the year, probably.) Since they moved GenCon out of Milwaukee, I just can't drive down for the day at the drop of a hat. If they ever move it back, I'll probably start going again.  I've got a lot BIG NEWS from the last couple of months. I've had three books (two paper, one electronic) come out since June:  Thunderbirds (the novelization of the new movie) The Dying Kingdom (my first YA Dragonlance book -- and second in the series) Carnival/Circus (two short stories -- available at  urlLink www.lonewolfpubs.com )  They're all good work, and you should check them out if you get a chance. The Thunderbirds book even includes some material that didn't make the "final cut" in the movie.  The movie is good, by the way, though a bit more fast-paced than I would have prefered. (I'd liked to have lingered on some of the scenes, dialog, and SFX -- to enjoy them -- longer than they chose to. But, hey, I'm not a filmmaker. Yet.)  It was a strange experience seeing a movie of a book I "wrote," and it's odd writing adaptations to begin with. Once I get done with an adaptation, I feel like I "own" the story -- almost like I created it. Of course, it originated with someone other than me. And the original screenwriters will probably never meet, or even hear of me.  Still, it's fun and challenging work turning a screenplay into a book. The two disciplines are quite different, and each have their own strengths and weaknesses. With my writing style, which is highly cinematic anyway, it's probably not so tricky for me as it might be for some.  And, of course, I'm trying to turn out a damn good book each time, despite the fact that it's work-for-hire and not really "mine."  The other BIG NEWS is that I won the Origins Award again. This time, for Best Game Related Fiction, Short Form. Last time it was for "long form" with my final L5R novel, THE LION. (Still available!) The story that won was the Mage Knight opus, PODO &amp; THE MAGIC SHIELD. You can read it here:   urlLink http://www.wizkidsgames.com/mageknight/chamber/fiction.asp?cid=38016   And it's FREE.  Finally, for now, I've put up a new web site, devoted just to my literary career:   urlLink www.stephendsullivan.com   You can catch up on all my books and short stories there.  That supplements my ongoing, catchall site:  urlLink www.sdsullivan.com   You can check there for more news, tidbits, and links about nearly everything I've done professionally over the years.  Oh! The Alliterates site is back up, and should be updated soon.  urlLink www.alliterates.com   You can contact me through my sites, ask questions, etc.  Time to get back to work!  -- Steve Sullivan

         Hey all you out there in blogger land.       <>   I've been super busy, but here's a quick update:     <>     I'm still working hard on my next  Forgotten Realms ™ novel,  Master of Chains . It'll be done by the end of the year, and you'll be able to find it in bookstores sometime at the end of 2005.     <>      Guild Wars  is coming along just fine. I'm pleased with the story, and even though there is still a lot of work to be done, I'm confident we'll actually finish. Last week I was interviewed for a television show on Tech TV. It's called  Pulse . I've seen it once. It's a sort of news program for gamers and techno-geeks. They filmed me for about a half hour (which probably means I'll be on for about thirty seconds). I'm not sure when it's going to air, but I'll keep you posted.      <>     In other news, my brand new car blew up after owning it for only nine days. I'm told they're going to have to replace the entire engine. What a nightmare. In the end, though, I don't think it's going to cost me much, so I guess things could be worse.     <>     Hope all is well with the rest of the gang. Take care.     <>     -Jess
