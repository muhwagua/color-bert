						   All I wanted was my voice to be heard, floating away above like a bird, back down to Earth, a shotgun pointed at my face it's time for me to go goodbye human race.  The time I've spent all alone in my room deciding to take the crack or the shroom, Thrown it all away I've cleaned up my life Thrown it all away, no trouble, no strife.  Well thats pretty pathetic but meh so what.

						   This may interest the few people out there who can be arsed to look at this page. I hate people. It's true I don't mind admitting it, because you don't know who I am and consequently can't do jack about it. I hate the way you walk around with an aura of self importance and arrogance that makes everyone hate you like your a Nazi.  You think your so important and that everyone should listen to you, now listen to me..... If your one of these people.... SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!!  We don't care about your pitiful little lives you pathetic imbred ferrets.  anyway thats my rant over goodbye

						   Hello to everone there who has been lonely enoguh or just plain bored enough to log on to my web page. As the name suggests this page is devoted to randomness and how my life and sene of huour have been twisted and warped like a piece of plastic in a vat of boiling tar.   I myself hate pretty much everything and almost everyone unless they have gotten to know me. This page will be updated when I feel like it and when something occurs in my life that I think will shock/disgust/humour/upset you.  Goodbye for now people.

						   If I were to say, that I hate ray, he'd kill me with one hand, crush my pituitary gland, and then start a band, a rock and roll band. He'd play the banjo, like a stampeding rhino, take shots of brandy, get laid... he's quite randy, the old sod would soon start to choke, his wife's left him and he's stony broke, so learn a lesson from my dear friend ray.................

Is it their job to be friendly to each other but bitch behind each others back.... WHATS THE POINT OF THAT..... BE RUDE TO PEOPLES FACES its much better for you plus you'll get a few laughs. Also what is up with hugging???? How great is that........ no I don't want to get off with you... lets hug.... Whcich is great seeing as most blokes hate unnecessary touching anyway.

						   Off to france 2mo and will be arriving on saturday......... are we having an overnight stop i ask?  FECK NO over night stops are for wussies we're gonna drive from one corner of france to t'other in one day (ish) which should be fun. That is until i get sunstroke and start playing the "How many different muscles i can cramp up at once" game.  Unlike short ppl or i (standing at 6ft2) am destined to have knee and back problems later in life. I will also probably suffer brain damage as i will undoubtedly hit my head on various things killing whats left of my brain cells.  People often ask me whatit's like to be my height, whether i have to crane my neck to breath, how jesus is doing, and whether i scrath my head on low flying planes.......  I dont mind hort people i wouldn't mind being short cos then i wouldnt get cramp in my legs and back from sitting in cars for to long, I wouldnt have to be used as a stool for short people in tescos who cant reach the top shelves (U KNOW HU U R!)...................  I seem to have gone off on a small tangent...... meh what was i saying... oh yer not gonna be here in france laters dudes and dudettes

						   If I was to inform you that I was depressed or if I was angry at something you in your infinite wisdom would probably, and lets be honest here, think, "Ah thats Keith being wierd again" and dismis it as one of the characteristics of my oh so overwhlming charm and personality... please add you own level of sarcasm.  You see what some of you fail to realise is that I can be an incredibly serious person. I bet some of you are doing it even now.... shut up and look away... SHUT UP *cries*... ok so for once you were right *clap clap*  But one day im gonna be serious and u will all once again think that i'm kidding..........  Why can't people realise that if you are a little wierd like me that you can be serious and have real feelings...... ah well im off to stew now  ....... oh and before you point out stuff about angst... just think i may be aware of it and do me a favour.... shut.. the... hell....up thankyou  Laters

						   I have recently been described as, and i quote "a steel cased goey thingy" or more eloquently. "An armadillo penis."  At first I didnt quite know how to take this........ after all being described as an armadillo penis isn't exactly a high point of my day.  this then spurned rather.... how can i put this... disgusting convo about whether armadillos penis's are actually co ered with the... hard... stuf (dunnno what the technical term is). The conclusion is that no they dont because if they did armadillo's would have died out long ago because it would have been to painful for the women so reproduction would be impossible. Hence coining the phrase If u think im gonna put that in there....."  I have know idea why i am saying this but i hoe to have lightene up ur day or at least make u barf  Laters

						   Fliggoo gigoo minen brethren.   The time dawns upon us once more.... the start of a new school year, which personally I am looking forward to about as much as having my scrotum remved with a rusty razor blade and jumping into a vat of vinegar.   Just to add to the fun it is gcse year, so we can all start shitting ourselves now. Its already got to the point of my parents asking what i would want to do at uni :S. I HAVENT EVEN BLOODY TAKEN THEM YET. I have also been infromed that when i do actually go to uni my parents are going to sell up and move to scarborough. Consequently I will have no home after uni and I would nver be able to live in the south of England with houise proces the way they are. So double yay. DAMN GOVERNMENT *shakes fist angrily*  Before i bid you adieu i woud like to say a few things that i have discovered over the past few days. I appear to have lost the fear of death that i used to have, so scor one for me. However my emotions seemed to have been numbed over the past few years leaving me pretty much cold and heartless :S....... so every cloud  I have to go ponder something now.... damn thinking.... never does anything helpful for me   Laters

						   I'm back from france *not that any of you noticed I was gone.....grumble....mutter* It was a fun time, if very hot *not that you care... i was about as missed as hitler at a jewish birthday party....am i over exxagerating... mebe*....... ANYWAY  School is back soon *shudders* and it's gcse year which means i'll be having as much fun as a one legged man in an ass-kicking contest. I also have to improve my handwriting or my 'results will suffer' this means that i'll be screwed unless my handwriting gets better.  On the plus side I will be....... be.......nope wait there isn't a plus side. I have Giddings for another year, I'm still doing french, I now have Mrs Durrant for maths, no more rugby cos i'm not good enough for the yr 12 team, I will soon be getting braces and possibly surgery on my teeth.  On the plus side I will soon be able to buy soft drinks in bars and piss away money on the lottery so I'll start decking the halls shall I?.   Meh, I'll also be getting a saturday job so for once in my life i'll actually have some money for a change.

"GET A*'S IN ALL OF YOUR EXAMS OR DIE A HORRIBLE BLOODY DEATH INVOLVING AXES AND PEOPLE PISSING ON YOUR CORPSE!!!!"   Which as you can imagine along with various other teachers ramblings of "60% of my students last year got a's or above...." *BANG* "DIE MUTHAFUCKA!!"

						   It's late and i got roughly 6 hours sleep last night. I should be in bed instead I'm typing. I dont even know why because I really dont have a point to any of this. hmm...... ah wel i'm just feeling a little...... pleh *nice and descriptive*  My eyes ache and my hands are bleeding,  No rhyme or reason to the pain im feeling,  My hand iss the gun, held by a defenceless child, With my conscience hovering as the trigger.  Hm..... dont know quite where that came from.... oh well its late I'm tired and if ur confused u shud be. I don't even understand the things i do half the time. Ah well lifes a bitch and then u die, or marry one and eventually commit suicide as your days become longer and longer and all the more unbearable. If your wondering as to why I'm typing this, it's because I'm feeling a little depressed. I stirred up some of my old shit that I thought I'd hidden. Ah well..... im not an emotinoless bastard after all, but sometimes i cant help feeling.... it may be better if i were...  Laters

						   It is time for me to tell you people that dismay at my music taste......... i wont mention any names but u know hu u r!!!..... in actual fact it wont change ur minds at all so it doesnt really matter in the slightest..   I am gonna talk about hip-hop..... yes thats right many of u will be going.... "U may have a tan Keith but ur not black...." SO? Because I'm not black or don't do drugs I cant enjoy rap music. I have done only one drug and thats alcohol and very unfrequently to excess, yet I can still like people like Cypress hill hu's lyrics include, "Roll it up, light it up, smoke it up, inhale... exhale" and the song Dr Greenthumbs... anyway I am using this to bring ur attention to the fact that the lyrics don't have to be about serious things to make a very good song. When there's a good beat and the lyrics flow well then hu cares what they're saying.   I'd like to use these quotes to show the lyrical genius of some hip-hop/rap rock artists:  "They dopn't gotta burn the books they just remove them" - lyricists can make a statement, Zack de la Rocha  "Light you a blunt kiss your ass goodbye, you gassed yourself, 'cos it's a suicide"  - alright they're songs may be about death etc. but geniuses in their own right, Gravediggaz  "Brass monkey, that funky monkey" - mix of political angst and random fun, superb, Beastie Boys  "Watch as the room rocks, mentally moonwalk. Mix media slang, banging in your boombox. Verbal violence, lyrical stylist. In a time when rock/hip-hop rhyems are childish" - dude of an MC, Mike shinoda  Anyway more will come probably, try and open ur mind ppl *arf hippie talk* but seriously listen to some of the hip hop music. Not all of it is people trying to sound hard rapping over the same beat.*cough eminem cough* You will find one you like in the various styles out there.   Laters

						   I start my annual talk with my fabled few readers today about something dear to my heart.... comedy.  I hve a wide range of comedy influences *not that it does much good* ranging al across the board of the different types of comedy acts that are out there.   Firstly isthe late, great Bill Hick's. Not as well known as he deserves, the man is a genius in the way he fuses his biting political satire and breaking apart the fat, stupid american stereotype that so many comics rely upon. He knows that his people are stupid but he can point this out to them in subtle ways, such as the Kennedy assasination.   "Hey Bill stop talking about the Kennedy assasination. Its old news let it go. . ." " Ok then you dont talk to me about jesus... i mean shit if we're talking shelf life here. . ."  Combined with his political standings lies a razor sharp wit and the ability to deal with hecklers and questions in a way that some comics would never be able to manage.   Secondly Jack Dee. The man is the living embodiment of all the bitterness, sarcasm and cynicism that we, as the British people are famous for. The man has the ability to turn everyday things that we all notice into a matter for side splitting laughter. Not only this but he says everything that we have wanted to say, but have been to afraid to do so. For example when he talks about other parents   "Our three year olds reading Harry Potter" " Really? ... Well ours is smearing his shit all over the fridge door so..."   Thirdly I take Chris Rock. Now some of you may have a shocked look on your face going " But...butkeith ... he's black..... he tells jokes that we dont understand." Ok so none of you are, at least I hope your not or you will taste the back of my hand *judo pose*. Anyhoo, I would like to call him an 'astounding political figure' but he is not. However e explored the stereotypes white people have over black people on one of his tours in his infamous "Black people vs Niggaz" jokes. He tells us that not all black people are how we percieve them, but the niggaz are the ones we shud look out for.  "It aint us Chris its the media...... what are you talking about the media.... When i go to a cash machine tonight Im not looking over my shoulder for the media! Im looking for niggaz. . ."  "Who's more racist? Black people or white people? Black people you know why...... cow we hate black people too"  These men are three influences upon my life and altho i cudnt include the other comics that have made me laugh more than pop 'n' fresh getting poked *please if u have a sick mind shut up at this point*. I could have included many others except for the lack of room. Eddie Izzard, Lee Evans, Peter Kay, Chris Tucker, Cedric the Entertainer, Robin Williams, Jim Carrey and many many more.  You may have noticed i have not mentioned any women. This is a subject I will adress at a later date  Laters

						   My time is short on this planet so I should probably be using my time efficiently so that I can get all the things I want to do in the relatively short time available to me. No I'm not gonaa go on a rant about how pointless life is because life doesn't have a point. There is no destiny but what we make for ourselves, and that is a thought I cling to above all others. Basicall  some of you out there in amongst the minority of readers i have will be realising that there is not much time left in school and that you wil soon have to be making desicions for yourselves. This, to me at least, is a frightening prospect. Think about it. In a few years I will have left behind a large majority of my friends. Be completely broke due to having o pay for uni and accomadaiton *thank u mam and dad* and more importantly i wil be independent. Independence comes naturally to some but after years of being somewhere that you ont have to worry about cooking, cleaning or payiong bills I dont think that I will sit very well to this kind of life.     Also t this time in your life *and by your life i mean... mine* there is that worst case scenario niggling way at the back of your mind:  You leave school/college/uni with very few qualifications and have squandered the valuable education you have recieved. Your parents get pissed at you and believe you have pissed ur life away. You have to get a demaning job and will most likely be stuck in that job for the majority of your life. At this point you either train and work from home to try and improve your qualifications so that you can raise up in the ranks and become succesful. Or become content with the life of mediocrity that you now have doing the same job you hate day after day until you eventually rely on something to relieve the boredom/pain. Or even worse commit suicide and be thought of as a coward by all.   In my opinion resigning to mediocrity is the worst thing you can posibly do in this life. Its basically giving up early and knowing that you have the talent to succeed, but the lacking the willpower to get up of your arse and do something to change your life. Too many people are far too happy just to sit and wallow in their lives, nopt worrying about the fact that they are wasting the precious time that they have.  Anyway thats enough from me for now Im sure that most of you got tired of hearing me repeat the same words over again due to my poor word skils a long time ago anyway :P.  Laters

						   An earlier post by racheal:  you are an idiot no offence? how can i not take offence if you call me an idiot?!! you are truly a buffoon keith. bitching doesn''t have to be behind someones back-who made that up? ur bitching keith, face it. either that or ur just rude. i wonder why we don''t get on.......*ponders*   Well you are honest and thats an admirable trait. The fact that your not pretending to like me is a large point in your favour. Yes I am a bit of a buffoon, and yes I am rude. I'm just used to people never actually taking me seriously and consequently it never occurs to me that I can hurt peoples feelings. But thats who I am and if you are offended then I am sorry I offended you. *yes kiddo's I am apolagising* Im genuinely sorry that I offended you.   Btw as a footnote to my realisation that i can be a hurtful prick. I apolagise to anyone who I've offended over the years of my being sarcastic and generally bitter to anyone and everyone.

						   In a vain attempt to try and educate some of the lesser members of the select group that read my blog I will now plaec some poetry on my blog. It is a poem that I quite like........ coincidently some find it dark and depressing altho i dont know why meself. Anyway enjoy.... or dont   Do not stand by my grave and weep:  Do not stand at my grave and weep I am not there I do not sleep.  I am in a thousand winds that blow I am the softly falling snow. I am the gentle showers of rain, I am the fields of ripening grain.  I am in the morning hush, I am in the graceful rush Of beautiful birds in circling flight, I am the starshine of the night.  I am in the flowers that bloom, I am in a quiet room. I am the birds that sing I am in each gentle thing.  Do not stand at my grave and cry. I am not there. I did not die.  Yes you may be thinking that this would explain my morbid fascination with death and..... morbid... things..... .Wel ur just scratching the surface baby. Anyhooo  Laters

						   In occurance to my post about bitching:  surely by saying how much you hate people bitching then you are in fact bitching about them therefore making urself a hypocrite.......but perhaps not.....*ahem* ¬_¬   posted by bambi  This blogger is a public website, therefore it can be read by all so is merely me putting my opinions out in the open. Bitching is when you talk about people behind there back. As this is publice and available to all, *even people i dont even no* so that makes this the opposite of bitching. In conclusion you are wrong. I am not a hypocrite but you are an idiot :P No offence tho  Laters

						   I went and saw the aforementioned film *big word GO ME!!!!* and altho it looked as if it could end up being a big pile of monkey shite it was quite funny. Johnny Vegas of course gave the bulk 'pun intended' of the humour in my opinion it turned out to be in my opinion a very funny film. Pennis *as i cant remember his real name but can remember the show 'anyone for pennis?'* Was very good in his part and provided a sufficient amount of laughs. With take off's from rocky, the matrix and various other films to tie it all together.   All in al a good film.   Laters

						   "So keith, do you have a six pack?" Nope thatnks I'm happy with my buffer zone layer ty v much :)  Isn't it ironic *subject may not be ironic* that I'm in the happiest mood i've been in for a while. And because of it I'm doing what.... listening to Staind a lot more and writing more than i used to and its generally more morbid. Wierd no? I'm doing this yet i don't fel sad or depressed :s Anyhoo I've been wrting summat for a fw days now and I'm gonna give u a taste of it.....in other words a randomly selected paragraph.... enjoy kiddos  ".....Five minutes left. Time has no meaning when your not allowed a watch. Five minutes, ten minutes, three hours. This is the only place on the planet where time is truly relative. You get up when you want, eat when you want, sleep when you want. The perfect life and all you have to give up is your soul and your sanity. They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder, well then peace is in the eyes of the insane.  He could hear them through the door, he cold hear all. As far of these people were concerned he was God, omnipotence doesn’t mean shit when he was the one holding a gun. James was praying, Susan was crying, and the other two were too shocked to do anything except rock backwards and forwards. All the while muttering, “How could you do this to us? We’re your friends.”  “Friends?” The word was like acid to him. “How are you my friends? What, because the same nurse clears away the crap we leave behind?” His voice roze to fever pitch before, just as suddenly as it appeared it died. The storm over for now at least...... "  More will come soon when i finish writing this fooker.  Peace out kiddos

						   *cant place my quote of the day here as i like my testicles where they are*  It my make me sound morbid but have any of u just had the urge to grap lots of guns.... walk into the centre of town.... and just let loose on some innocents?? I know I have im just intrigued as to whether this is proof of my insanity or a normal thing for me to think.  Anyway now that I have your attention/worried looks/horrified stare I can continue........... thats what i would be saying if i actually had anything to say. Im just using this as a delaying tactic so that I dont have to do my maths homework.  Hmm i know gather round kiddies and i shall tel you a tale:   .... He could feel the cold muzzle of the colt against hisn chin. "What am i waiting for?" he kept asking himself, "no-ones gonna come no-one cares." He stayed stock still, his knees aching from where they had hit the concrete, back stiff from kneeling for too long. The smell of the spent shots lingered in the air, spilling over the back of his ford fiesta and hitting him in the face harder than that bullet ever could. If he didn't end it now it would never be over. . .at least thats what he kept telling himself. But it was true why couldnt he pull the trigger? Why couldnt he end it now and leave just like the rest of his family. Although they weren't really gone, they were surrounding him in a circle where he had laid them to rest. "I'm a coward," he sobbed to himself, rocking backwards and forwards with the gun never leaving his chin. Hewas sobbing so hard he couldn't see the door bust open and the bullet fly towards his face as the police came crashing in. . ."  Aaaaaahhh fell so much better now... vented some morbidness... bt i know its not awfully gud but srew you if u dont like it ;). Laters kiddos

Anyhoo go and listen to this track FBI File - corporate avenger. It has a good beat and is a good techno/rap/rock hybrid. I enjoy it therefore so should you. However i must warn you the majority of their songs are heavily political and kind of anarchistical *dunno if that word exists but meh* so the majority of u wont enjoy it.  Laters

						   "Keith.... im surprised..... u can run fast!!!!" - gee thanks?  School rugby starts again this year... despite it being as hot as the water i'd like to burn Giddingd with, and the ground being as hard as concrete. But because we're maly men we played through the pain...grrrrr...... then afterwards we howled like sissies.   One thing that i have noticed is that im sudenly faster than i used to be.... IM ACTUALLY RUNNING PAST PEOPLE GO ME!!! I first noticed this when Williams actually gave me a compliment.... a rarity to say the least. *is dead proud*  Ironic really, I sit on my arse for god knows how long doing no excersise and i go back to school fitter and faster than before.....

						   Right time to settle something once and for all *gets into judo stance*.  I know it may be difficult for some of you out there in the real world to know when to take me seriously.  Unfortunately for you people your still gonna have to guess. However as a little hint into what to look out for:  When I say something along the lines of 'no worries, no problem' or something similar that means that i dont mind. Difficult to understand isnt it, a person who says what he actually means :o never!!!! *apolagise for sarcasm but its necessary*  When I want to be taken seriously I will probly say something like. "an i talk to you about summat..." or summat along those lines. Instead of just barging in with talk and ruining your day like i normally do ;) However I am a compulsive liar and this may not really help some of you in your desicions. The best way is to ask me flat out and I will give you and honest answer. Simple aint it?   That'll do for now kiddos. Until next time *throws cape round shoulders* Laters

						   "Have you ever felt like a spare tyre?"  I postpone my talk on comedians for a later date, for right now im going to talk about something mind blowing... something that will change you life forever........... nah just kiding but now that ur either interested or throwing things at your monitor i can continue.  As to why I have not talked about Female comics in my previous blog deelyis is that in my opinion, female comics arent as good. Now before you start lighting your torches and start the long walk to my house in your angry mob to roast me over a fire I urge you to read what I have to say. I am not stereotyping women as unfunny, far from it.  I know some who can have me in stiches for hours upon end. French and Saunders for example are superb in what they do. All be it they are not stand up comics fair enough but their LOTR and Harry Potter rip-offs had me near the point of leakage with laughter. *that means near pissing meself i just wanted to add some decorum to this rant*  Sandy Toxfig (spelling) is however a ilarious stand up. For those of you who have never heard of her she was on old programs that ur parents *and ill people hu watch daytime tv* i.e.  Call my Bluff where she has the ability to spin amazingly funny yarns to put off other comptitors. Her stand up also has the appeal that many of the newer women lack.   The women (and im sorry to generalise) in stand up at the moment and for want of a god example ....oooh i dunno ... how about....jenny eclair. For the people out there who do not know who this comidienne is....... lucky u. Ive sen her several times on various shows where she has been introduced as 'ground breaking' or words to that effect. But in my eyes she doesnt have the necessary quick wit to make her funny. Her lines sound all so well rehearsed as if she's been using the same material for many years......... oh wait a minute...thats cos... SHE HAS!   Comidiennes similar to this have been springing up in Britain for some time now, using the same material as their male predecessors except throwing in more swearing than a Kev with his cock caught in his zip *enjoy the image why dont you* in a vain attempt to make their old tame jokes sound more funny.   And people wonder why a man has won the award for best new stand up for 8 years in a row. Imust concede to that the last one to win it wasthe aforementiond Jenny Eclair but she seemed not to know that u might want to change the 'jokes' as opposed to the swear word count to succeed fuly.

						   "lol anyone ever tell u have an over-active imagination?" funnily enough no 'insane' tends to be the preffered word  Ouch. Today has hurt quite a bit. Played rugby for the 2nd 15 (woo go me :D) and it was tough. I am nursing quite a few bruises and my shoulders and nexk have cramped up on me. All this aside i enjoyed it. I haven't played rugby for 8 monthsish and today was scary as the ground was harder than a man at stringfelows.   Then met up with you guys and proceeded to get beaten at bowling by racheal and Katie, however the rest of u suck :P...... please dont kill me... *puppy dog eyes*   Anyhoo various courseworks need meh attention  Peace out ppl

						   "You are like a hero here" ... wow...go me... *ego swells*  Today was wierd. First off we had the attack of the grangers who thought it would a brilliant idea to throw conkers at ppl.... nice one u fucking idiots..... Nice to see that great intellect of urs shining through.  RANT MODE.... ppl hu dont like me doing this turn away now  I have nothing against people from the grange and I am not arrogant enough to look down on people who don't go to a grammar school. I worked damn hard to get into this school and I'm proud of my achievements but that doesn't make us any better than them or anything. The fact is I just don't understand what runs through these peoples minds. Seriously a day doesn't go pass whithout a granger on my bus going, "Are there gay people in your school?" or "Do people try to bumrape you?" ... ok the last one i get less often but it still gets asked!! :/ THEN I try to explain that there probly are a percentage of gay people in our school and ... now stop me if im being naive... but in their school as well.. No no no they declare. Gay people don't exist except in your school. The fact is that yes there are going to be gay people but so what? There not evil or devil worshipping or anything... wierdos.  I also see a lot of bitterness from my old school mates bcos in their eyes i am now a 'boff' and i grudgingly admit that i probly am cleverer than them *not that the spelling on this site says much about that* but why are these ppl so bitter?  No offence to anyone cos some of the grangers are cool but the majority of the ones i se are complete wankers. Anyhoo off to play badminton with meh rents soon  Peace out ppl

However now my parents think im a hippy because i sit on grass and dont wear socks... i wear a vest and jeans round the house... i dont shave... i dont wash... omg im a hippy!!!   Also my parents mocked me for huggin when i said goodbye :S which is kinda wierd... my parents encourage me to be sensitive, caring all that bollox... er i mean stuff everyone should be ... and then i do it and i get mocked!!! Thus proving my point the world is against me. Alas i dont own a bong yet so i can't be dubbed a real hippy ;)   Im in a happy mood so not mucht o write in this fooker  Peace out ppl

						   ' "And to the C students, I say you, too, can be president of the united States!" The part where you also need an ex-president father, a brother as governer of a state with missing ballots, and a supreme court full of your dad's buddies must have been too complicated to bother with in such a short speech' - Michael Moore, stupid white men  Now as many of you know, I'm not a great fan of the american president George W Bush but as i dont really want to go on a rant........... i'll let someone else do it for me :D. I suggest that if you have an interest in politics of america, hate G.W or just want a good laugh at americas expense, then I recommend that u read Michael Moores 'stupid white men' which challenges several of the peoples thought on a variety of subjects to do with america.  I also recommend a completely unrelated book by Robert Ludlum. I say 'book' but any of the covert-one novel series will do. They are all superb works of fiction, with all of their basis deeply rooted in fact. 'The paris option' does so especially, and altho the majority of u would probably never think about touching a book like this, throw away those thoughts that it will be just like every other spy/acion book because it isnt'. And if ur discouraged from books like this because like Tom Clancy novels they have innumerable amounts of facts and figures that ruin the plot, then u need not worry as the book, altho going into detail, does not overflow with figures about weapons/biological warfare/aeroplanes that no-one (barring psychopaths who love weapons) want to know about  Laters

Call me a geek if u wish, brand me with that label but tbh i dont give a flying fuck ;). This game looks soo much fun it's incredible. They've fixed the bullet time in the first one (in case u r a bit of a geek like me) so that u now carry on moving the same speed as everything else speeds up which looks as fun and as satisfying as dropping furbies into a volcanoe.  Been waiting for this game for quite a while now and very soon i shall hold it in my grasp.... oh the fun.... btw for those of u that are a little scared, im not a geek as i dont get this excited over many things to do with computers, its just this game has impressed me so much. To those of u who r mocking me now i suggest u play the original, or watch the videos and if ur not computer wise then dont mock what ur pitiful brains cant understand.... jking ppl anyhoo hope i can get the money/graphics card needed to run it  Laters

						   "...and weed is not a drug ne way..."  Yes its the old debate that everyone has every so often with ur mates. Whe it comes to this i'm impartial so i get to be the big guy with the funny wig and the small wooden hammer.  So to begin *breathes* Yes weed is a drug BUT so are alchohol and nicotine the only difference being that alcohol and ciggaretes have become, to some degre, socially acceptable whereas weed to many has not. (also the two that are not frowned upon are untaxed but this isn't a political rant so i'll neglect to say that ...for now...)  I myself would prefer people to smoke weed than smoking a cigarette because at least there doing it for a reason not just bcos they want to look cool and commit suicide over a long period of time. However to some degree cigarettes are better because they have a filter in them but if weed was made legal then shps would sell it in packets and big companies would get in on the act which would make it a business as big as cigarrettes so im sure they could afford filters there.   Statistically we we'll all no someone hu does weed..... actually we all know a load of ppl that have done weed however as this is a public site im obligated not to point my finger at those ppl. Anyway my point is that it is THEIR, not ur THEIR life. As none of u are exactly pure to ur inner core i suggest that u not judge others by what thye choose to do. If it doesn't affect anyone and it's a harmless habit why should we become lord and master over other ppl?   I myself have never tried weed and probably never will [ my body being the temple it is;) ] but i have nothing against what other ppl do with their lives. However if u do anything harder than weed then ur stupid, if ur gonna go out and do heroin or some shit like that that will probly kill u then go ahead be my guest. Hell im not gonna stop u if u wanna piss ur life away after all its ur choice. whoops stopped being impartial there .....  The moral of the story being, if ppl wanna do weed let them, u have no right to stop them as it is not ur choice its theirs, however if they come to u for help saying they want to give up.... thats when u get involved. Anyhoo sorry to preach cos it aint gonna do a thing. This debate will keep on going forever most likely   Laters

						   "Your wierd d'you know that?" ..... thanks mum :/  I was gonna review the italian job and sing it's praises from the rooftops of aylesbury.... then i saw it. Now as Em and Hicks have already reviewed it i cant be pissed so check their's out instead by clicking the links to the left.  Suffice to say there are three similarities : The main guys called charlie, there is a scene with mini's, and gold is involved in the plot line... thats about it as the plot, setting, characters, ending and pretty much THe WHOLE FILM is different. Instead i've asked around and there's a large number of people who haven't actually seen teh original one :s. This however is a film i DO strongly recommend that you all watch as it pisses all over the remake and unlike the American/disney-like feel u get in this film the original has true british humour and an involving plot and storyline.  On another note teh Rugby World cup starts tommorow :D:D which is good as we will get to see England own all of the oppositioni... finnally a sport that we invented that we're good at!!

I'm now seriously out of pocket, spending my last fiver at that place... how do you ppl afford to have a social life?!? i went out what ...twice that week and im broke :/  Highlights were numerous but have mostly been mentioned by t'other ppl so im not going to bother repeating them instead go to hicks's or em's sites.  Spent today watching the rugby and i would like to say one thing.... Scotland suck... If u didn't watch them u were probably out somewhere doing something meaningful as opposed to my playing guitar and watching tv.... but anyway i suggest u watch the highlights.  On another random note, things that i am learning atm for guitar:   Nothing else matters - Metallica For whom the bell tolls - "   "  Living in a hiding place - idlewild Inhale - stone sour Wonderwall - Oasis  and anything else that take my fancy.   As i wrote this 3 fireworks so far have gone off near my house....... theres no show but the kids do love to throw them around :/ Don't blow your heads off or anything...... it'd be a fucking tragedy  Laters

						   Apparently one of the reasons that childhood obesity is in a large number is that the stores are putting sweets and snacks by the counter, which makes the children pester their parents who have to buy them. One ..... ur parents.. ur allowed to say 'NO!'. Two.. they dont 'have' to have whats on the counter, the advertising is not that bad.  The gvernment said the sweets shud be taken out of the childrens line of site... what a great idea.. shit lets put mars bars on the top shelf and move the porn down to the 5 yr old kids eyeline. That'd be far better for them at that age. The parents would just be pestered again by children going 'mummy.. what is that man doing?' as with before they don't have to answer 'Masterbating son.'   Just another example of ignorance yada yada cant be pissed to go off on a rant now so do it for urselves!! its far more fun.  Laters

Do you bottle up ur confusion? Do yo know the meaning of life? Have you ever seen true despair on someones face?   Are you scared?  this isnt a psychology form that u ring the box and i diagnose u ...... tbh i dont know what this is... anyway ignore this and scroll down and read the story which is far better than reading this random pap comments are helpful whereas insults earn u a beating.

						   Hey ho people.  Yesterday rocked so kudos to jenny etc. on the organisation front *applauds*. Everyone looked smart in their suits and dresses, with very few of u looking like pillocks, actually i cant remember anyone looking like a pillock so kudos goes to you guys too.   *yawn* my eyes are all heavy so i may go back to bed some time. CURSE MY WIERD SLEEPING TIMES!!!!!!!!!!!  anyhoo now that u have read hicksons story and gone 'wow thats really good. nice one ben' i will put mine up and u can point, laugh and generally mock me. It is on a completely unrelated subject matter and those of u that know me and know about my writing... u already know the subject matter. Comments would be nice yada yada but i wrote this due to boredom and a mixture of wierd other coincidences. Please pardon the poor grammar etc. Enjoy, or dont  *Insert witty name here*   Eight minutes. That’s how long he had left. Eight minutes until the police would run in and waste him and free the hostages. It was stupid of him to expect them to pay up, why would they? He had only taken four people and there was plenty more where they came from. After all, how much would their families miss them when they've shoved them in a nuthouse like this? No visitors here because nobody cares, not their families, not the pigs at the door and not even themselves. Ironic in a way, the pigs were coming to blow his house in and he, the wolf would be the one that got blown away.   He felt the blood trickle from the cut on his leg, staining the white hospital gown a bright crimson, the luger a dead weight in his hand. The realisation crept over him like a swarm of locusts on the fields he had spent so long spraying in his uncles blue plane. He couldn't remember the make, he couldn't remember much anymore since the 'treatment' from Dr Maloy. All he knew is that he wanted to get out, and get out now.   Five minutes left. Time has no meaning when your not allowed a watch. Five minutes, ten minutes, three hours. This is the only place on the planet where time is truly relative. You get up when you want, eat when you want, sleep when you want. The perfect life and all you have to give up is your soul and your sanity. They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder, well then peace is in the eyes of the insane.  He could hear them through the door, he cold hear all. As far of these people were concerned he was God, omnipotence doesn’t mean shit when he was the one holding a gun. James was praying, Susan was crying, and the other two were too shocked to do anything except rock backwards and forwards. All the while muttering, “How could you do this to us? We’re your friends.”  “Friends?” The word was like acid to him. “How are you my friends? What, because the same nurse clears away the crap we leave behind?” His voice roze to fever pitch before, just as suddenly as it appeared it died. The storm over for now at least.   He took a look at his companions, sitting in their respective corners in their blue robes trying to place them. He knew their names; Susan, James, Martin, and Jackie. Apart from that, he knew nothing. Were they married? Did they have kids? Where did they come from? Who was their favourite nurse? He knew none of this even though he had talked to them about those very things several times.  Except of course for the last question. The favourite nurse was Lucy; she was everyone’s favourite nurse. She was in her late twenties, brunette, tall with bright blue piercing eyes that could be fierce like a wolf, or soothing like a sunset. He wouldn’t say no anyway. Always a smile for everyone, taking time to talk to them and cheer them up when their families didn’t turn up when they said they would. Not like the other nurses. All 6”2, broad, blond and with faces that looked as if they’d been set on fire and put out with a spade. They had gruff voices and that, combined with their mannerisms gave the impression that they had been spawned from the loins of Hitler. Although it had been so long, he wouldn’t have said no to one of them either.   Three minutes. The countdown was agonising, wearing away his mind like hungry rats. They obviously didn’t believe that he would do it. “I’ll show them,” he sneered, “I’ll show them all.” He looked to his fellow actors in this play called life. Two choices faced him; he could set one of the hostages free to show that he was willing to co-operate. Or he could ‘release’ one of the hostages from their torment. A small snicker turned up one of the corners of his mouth as a thought creeped into his mind. “So…” he asked, not bothering to keep the sneer out of his voice, “Who wants to be released?”     The squad cars had been silenced a long time ago. The only sounds in the office were of the negotiators deciding upon their next move and the coffee percolator bubbling in the corner. The tension was evident on everybody’s face. The once immaculate shirts of the F.B.I had long since been replaced by sweat stained rags with ties loosened down to their ankles or in some cases lost completely. But they were nearing the end; swat teams had been posted at all entrances to the building all with itchy trigger fingers and tense nerves. Three minutes was their latest estimate, they were just praying that he would call again. They all stared transfixed at the phone on the desk, and when it began to ring took a step back in shock and surprise. “Hello?” asked the officer.  “Yes,” came the snake like response of the hostage taker, “I have decided to release one of the hostages.” There was a pause as everyone in the room let out a small sigh of relief. He continued, “I will release…   …Jackie.” He crashed the phone into its cradle and walked back to the room that he had forced them in. He took his time and sung a nursery rhyme he vaguely remembered his mother sang to him, his footsteps keeping in time to an eerie beat. “ Oranges and lemons say the bells of St Clements…” He opened the door, “You owe me five farthings say the bells of saint Martins…” He started up the stairs. “When will you pay me say the bells of Old Bailey…” He loads the clip into the gun. “When I grow rich say the bells of Shoreditch…” He loads the chamber and clicks off the safety. “When will that be? Say the bells of Stepney. I’m sure I don’t know say the bells of Saint Bow…” He slipped the key into the lock and turned the key. The bolt made the corridor echo as he stepped in, singing at the top of his voice now. “Here comes the candle to light you to bed and here come the chopper to chop of your…”  The shot could be heard by all. They never thought he’d shoot one of them, what was he doing? He said he’d release one of the hostages, this didn’t make any sense. The silence was awe-inspiring; the only sound you could hear was the irregularity of your own breath that comes with shock. Until finally the deputy said what everyone else was thinking. “Fuck…” At that instant the phone began to ring and trembling, agent Mavarian picked up the receiver. “H-hello?”  “Good. I’m guessing by the stammer in your voice that I shocked you.” He paused briefly, “if you meet my demands and free me with no warrants against my name. If you let me be truly free, then you need not worry about your precious hostages.” “We need more time…” It even sounded pathetic to him, the oldest cliché in the book. The man merely sneered down the phone and hang up. The silence returned, not a silence forged of shock, but one of contemplation. You could hear the thoughts flying across the synapses until one of the junior officers voiced his opinions. “Why don’t we just give him what he wants? We know he’s capable of killing the hostages, he’s shown us that much.” The older officers around him looked at him with a mixture of disbelief, rage and pity. “This is America boy,” one said patronisingly, “that’s not the way we do things.” As if encouraged by this the other officers became a hive of action, telling swat teams to ‘hold tight for the moment’ and ordering their double latte’s with sprinkles. After all it could be a long night and it would be hell for them without their latte’s.   They had barely noticed what he’d done. It was as if she had never been there, never existed at all. Although this was true for them all, it had been for a long time. It’s just like the old proverb: If a tree falls in the wood and no one’s around. Does it make a sound? If one of us were to fall, would anybody notice? Would any of us be heard? So as he sat there, covered with a mixture of his and Jackie’s blood he felt the sudden realisation that it didn’t matter if he killed a hostage. They would still rush in and take him down; because nobody cared about his hostage’s, they were worthless. “When will you people listen!?!” He screamed to the empty corridor, the echoes sounding like the diminuendo of an out of time choir, just like the one at his wedding. Then the thought struck him; he was married! “Sarah…” he could remember their wedding day…   …then he said, that’s ok I didn’t even want the beer!” Father was keeping the crowd amused with another of his stories of old. Regaling the with adventures he’d had gallivanting around the globe instead of being where he should have been, where he was needed. He wasn’t bitter about it, after all Father was paying for all of this, Sarah’s parents having died when she was very young and his mother running away as soon as he was put into boarding school. No I wasn’t bitter that he forgot countless birthdays and never had time for me, why would I be? All he wanted to do was grab the knife that they’d used to cut the cake and plunge in deep into – “Hey Mark!” It was Bill, Sarah’s brother. He was a likeable chap, always willing to help out if you needed it and had the unique ability to make anyone laugh. He smiled only the second true smile of the day, the first being when the fat kid fell over into the holy water. Whose kid was that anyway? “So how’s the budding new groom doing then?” he tried, but inevitably failed to keep the edge of sarcasm that he was so accustomed to. That’s why he liked him, he was always himself, never tried to hide who he was, if only he could be more like that… “You ok Mark?” he asked, “you look pretty bummed for a man who just married a model.” He merely stared at the floor and shrugged. “C’mon man lets go get some drinks.” He continued to stare at the floor. Why did he feel so scared? This was the best day of his life what was there to worry about? He shook the thoughts out of his head, smiled and said, “Yer sure, after all she’s already passed out.” He pointed to the blue Cadillac that was now home to his heavily saturated wife….  He was awoken from his reverie by the sound of the phone ringing in his hand. He didn’t want to answer; he wanted to go back. Back to a time he could barely remember but he didn’t care where it was as long as it was better than this. It kept ringing, the high pitched shrill burrowing away into his head. “Hello?” He asked to the receiver, sounding like a small child without his mother.  “Sir. We are willing to give you what you wish.” His voice sounded raspy like he’d been gargling with bleach, even his superior noticed. They waited for the reply hoping that he took the bait and they could finally end this. “Sir?” He asked. All they could hear was the sound of him breathing softly like a sleeping baby. He could picture him curled up in the corner of the room with a blanket over him, a scared man not sure what he’s doing in this life. That was, until he heard the laugh. It started as if he was coughing but it soon developed into a fully-fledged cackle. It was scary to imagine someone making that noise; it was something you expected from old horror films but not from anything human. “He’s flipped,” came the voice of one of the juniors at the back of the room. “Oh really?” asked agent Mavarian patronisingly, “What makes you think he was oh so sane to begin with? He’s in a god-damned mental hospital isn’t he?” This silence the room, Mavarian rarely spoke and never spoke with anger. The tension he was under became obvious, second divorce, supporting a kid he never got to see, failing to get promoted and having to return to his old rotting apartment every day. There was a man who needed this to go right, and it had already gone badly wrong without a hostage being released.  He picked up the receiver, the maniac laughter dying down to background noise. “Look,” he said matter-of-factly, “Just relea-,” he stopped himself in time, “let one of the hostages go and we’ll get you what you want.” Again silence reigned in the organisation room as he began to speak.  “What I want… how do any of you know what I want…” This brought many perplexed looks from the police officers cramped into the small communications room. “But… your demands?” Mavarian said delicately into the phone.  “Oh those. Well I’m sorry but I’ve changed my mind. I’m afraid that you can’t provide me with what I want.”  “And what is that exactly?” Mavarian asked, the familiar sneer returning to his voice. “Peace…”   He threw the phone into the air and with one well placed shot, blew it into fragments. He watched mesmerised as the pieces of circuit board, packaging and wires flew across the room, not caring when the door to his left burst open and a flood of large men holding riot shields, with their rifles raised surrounded him in his corner. “Put the gun down!” “Hands behind your head!” “Lie down on the floor!”  The orders cam thick and fast, he ignored them all. He realised that he had lost, he would never find peace. He raised his head to look at the nearest SWAT member and looked at him like an abused puppy looks at its owner. He looked down at the gun he held in his hand, it seemed obvious what he should do. Peace would come to him in eternity, he would finally find out who he is what he did in his life. He smiled and spoke, “Ironic in a way, the only time I’ll ever be free is when I’m trapped underground in a box.” The SWAT team looked perplexed as they stared at this man his face covered with someone else’s blood yet contorted in a peaceful smile before in a smooth angular motion he raised the gun to his temple and pulled the trigger.   *Click*   The smile vanished. His only way out and it had disappeared. He swore out loud as agent Mavarian walked into the room, his bulk shifting as he struggled to walk. The fitness tests obviously didn’t apply when you got a desk job. He was frantic, he had to get out, they were closing in on him wolves pouncing on a cornered rabbit. *Click* *Click* *Click* he was desperate.  Mavarian edged closer towards him, his footsteps a countdown heard above the shouting of the guards, the smug look of arrogance firmly set between both ears. He was the cat who’d got his cream, a kid with a secret. He wouldn’t let him win, not when he’d got so far he was so near the end. He noticed the SWAT guns were still trained on him watching his every move like empty soulless eyes.  He laughed the same laugh that made all of them shudder like the cowards they claimed not to be, he could see it in their eyes, they were afraid. He stared at the nearest one looking into his light blue eyes seeing the child he had not long left behind. The man must only be 20 a mere boy, new to the world of death and destruction his life would become. This was probably his first job, the first time having to look upon a real face when he pulled the trigger. Then looking closer he saw the reflection that was himself, lying in his corner covered in another humans blood, unsure about who he was and why he was here, only sure that he had been rejected but not knowing why. He was overcome by his own self-pity, which in turn quickly became a seething rage, he was angry at himself, angry at the police that stood over him but angriest at his father. It burned inside of him willing him to do it, to free himself from the torment and with his final thoughts of he rushed the officers…  ... He soon thought no more.

						   hmm.. why dont i liven things up and talk about god?   I'm an aethiest and am in the firm belief that even if there is a god, he's screwing me around. I will now try to explain to you all the purpose of god, heaven and the majority of religions. Strap urself in or get lost  God was, in my view, another of mans creations to try and give the people hope, and to give them something to work for. In early times this meant that Gods were there to justify why you were supposed to do something because it was gods will. By this i do not mean that the rulers invented god to rule over their people, i mean that the people themselves thought of their god/gods as their reason to do what they were doing.   This lead to the invention of the various different cultures 'heavens' which was giving reason to a confused masses as to why they died (similar to the invention of time.... but thats another subject) this meant that death would not be meaningless to these people and if they would be in paradise with a loving god then they would live their lives better. Also the creation of the various hells, provided reasons as to why people could not do what they wanted. It was created so that people on the whole would not do 'evil' things because they would be shunned by the almighty and suffer an eternity of torture. This would be enough to discourage anyone from an improper lifestyle.   So does god exist? In my opinion there is no God, no heaven, no hell but tbh i have no idea as to what happens at death. However to the people religion and god brings hope to and makes their lives have purpose then yes, he is a very real person indeed. He gives them a real explination as to what is happening in their lives and potrays infinite forgiveness.  So there ya go.. will it solve anything? no... do i care? no  Laters

						   I have never had a film move me to tears, it is a thing i have due to my stunted emotions. So alas i did not cry when watching Regeneration, although i was moved by it. As a film it was one of the most thought-provoking i have seen in my lifetime coupled with one of the most emotional experiences i have ever seen. This is supported by the unflinching realism that is portrayed throughout, reminding you that this is based on real experiences and real lives. This makes it all the more moving to watch as you pity the people who have suffered something we can only begin to imagine. It goes right up there with shawshank redemption as one of my favourite films i've seen, I recommend it to all.  Laters

						   I went today into a place i fear above even that picture of david dickinson.... *shudder*. Yes kiddos i went .. to Quarrendon.  Much to my surprise i wasn't raped or mugged or even lightly beaten. Even further to my surprise they have opened a library in quarrendon, which is of course inhabited by small, and not so small kids who shout and swear a lot. All they need to do now is teach some of them to read and this building will have a use for them....... its not that i have anything against these people.. i just think they're generally thick as shit.... whoops that came out wrong. Basically they live in a society which, like many others singles out clever people and makes them feel like shit because they are more intellgient than the masses who are of course jealous.   Hmm... i appaear to have dug a large hole....... erm... i found out today that only 15.3% of my body is actually fat, so it was all muscle all along. IN UR FACE DEMOCRACY!!   ..  *looks around* ...... diversion succesful  Laters

						   I would like to spend a few minutes talking about something thats been in the news a lot lately, paull burrel and his book...... and as this is my site none of you can stop me.   As you all should n=know by now, I am an incredibly large cynic... despite not actually knowing how to spell it. Paul Burrel released this information about a letter Diana wrote, saying she feared for her life. Now it could be a HUGE coincidence that this happen, a week or so before he released his book...... but i dont believe in large coincidences. Also he said that he didnt right the book for the moeny, he said the book was, "About the truth", well if u dont want the money.... why are you keeping it as opposed to giving at least some of it to charity?  This also begs the question 'Why didn't he reveal this little tid-bit at the time of the french-enquiry?' Even if he wasn't called as a witness, ya think it would be a piece of evidence that might just be relevant. The fact that diana was afraid there was a plot to kill her, may have been relevant to the case investingating the circumstances surrounding her death. Also when told to shut up by by her sons and told not to dredge up old news, he took the moral high ground!?! Against her sons that have probably just gotten over her death!!!!   Well perhaps I'm wrong and perhaps hes not an insensitive, greedy bastard... but i doubt it  Laters

						   Haven't blogged in a while so this is it. Yesterday i saw matrix revolutions and i thoroughly enjoyed it. A fitting end to the trilogy although some people left confused and scratching their heads... pfft idiots... ahem anywayit far and away makes up for reloaded, which in comparison to this is a pile of monkey turd.  JUst noticed i've passed the 1000 mark so woo... go all u keen socialites.  ...the irony is apparent... let it be  Onto rugby, twas a hard game against london oratry in which i was subbed at half time for the yr 12 Keirn so as to put more experience into the squad... about 5 mins later Mr Dean asked 'fancy playing for the first 15?' .. i rather stupidly agreed and then ..almost simultaneously realised i was going to die.... Luckily (for me) i didnt and instead twatted about in the flanker position trying to look as if i knew what i was doing. Anyhoo i played for the first 15 at rugby hence me = :D .. so waht if it was because one guy cut his face open and another one was concussed. I still got in didnt i?.. ahem  England vs France 2mo i hope u'll all be up watching and shouting at the english mistakes with me.   Laters

						   I was writing poetry ..not randomly there was a purpose behind it and I came up with this. It was a poem about rememberance and it seemed relevant that I should post it up with the 11th of the 11th coming up soon.   Ode to the Departed  If I could take, my final breath And fall into the murky depth. Fall down, down into the sea, Would you be there, waiting for me?  My heart is black my face is cold I don’t know why we must grow old. I need more time; I need to go back Return and get my life on track.  If I could stare, out to the sky, Stare until it hurt my eyes. If I could see all that I want, Would what I see, be you and me?  If I could have you back again, The sky would not, on my head rain. If not this then could I store, The memories I have forevermore.  will this mean anyhing to any of you? i doubt it but it does to me so meh. I'm just gonna say give money to the poppy appeal because after all, it my be cliched... but they did fight for our freedom and deserve our respect. So some time on tuesday just stop for a minute, think and pay your respects to the people that gave their lives for our country. It doesnt matter if u agree with what they did, selflesness is a trait that should be admired.   Laters

I had planned to do my xmas shopping today .. but as with all my plans it fell apart horribly in my hands.   Another thing i've experience is the bewilderment of seeing someone whos.... well 'great' doesnt seem to cover it.. at the guitar. My chin dropped  roughly |                                                           |                                                           |                                                           |                                                           |                                                           |                                                           |                                                           |                                                            |                                                           |                                                           |                                                            V Twice as far as that Also: (gee a lot today :S) I am officially most photogenic person ever.. its a fact.

						   I am becoming less and less bothered about school..... it means less to me everyday i go. The constant reminders of as and a levels are beginning to get right on my tits.  WE HAVEN'T EVEN DONE OUR GCSE'S YET!!!   ahem.... whoops...  Xmas and my 'year closer to death' day draw nearer meaning that the year is nearing an end. I look back over the past year and everything thats changed in my life and i begin to wonder how four months ago i knew very few of you. Just shows how times change don't it?  Anyhoo i forgot the reason i was writing this thing altho im sure none of you would have enjoyed reading it anyway so... *disappears*

						   Danko Jones  Two words that some of you will have heard me use a lot... or a little... or not at all... anyhoo  They well... rock! they take the majority of their style from old school funk rock (to those of you that don't know what this is... just download some anyway its good). Also its happy music for a change.  'Keith.. with happy music :O?!?!?! NEVER!' but alas folks ..tis true... this music has a damn good beat to it with a very blues/rock mixture to the vocals which gives it an overall damn good sound.  favourite tracks of mine are - 'Strut' and 'i want you' along with a few others, namely any off their newer albums. I suggest strongly that you either download them as they are awesome  anyhoooooo ... laters

I still do not know whether to take this as an insult or not ... but thankyou anyway i guess :S  On another note parents evening tonight :S ... the outcome of this evening may very well leave me grounded or if its a good evening... then i get the long long loooooooonnnnnnggggg talk about what i want to do for A level etc. Isn't school fun?

						   "She makes me... forget my name" *add funky beat* - Danko Jones   Im in a good mood, despite the huge bruise on my knee...other knee....knucle..arms...leg.. u get the picture? This should help you understand why many of the conversations we have about our house events up eventually end up at - "Why don't we just boycott it?"   Yes, so..... French Bread... now wouldn't that be a great idea (can u tell im bored and am using this as a distraction...can ya?)   Writing time.. i felt like writing another thing for the hell of it so thats what im doing now: (this is complete improv so i apolagise for the crapness/suicide it induces)  Burnt spoons and boiled carrots  He smiled. It was the first real smile he'd had in a long time, unless you count the smug ones he got when he saw someone fall over or tricked his brother into saying something stupid. He didn't know why he was happy, well he did but he didn't really believe it. Funy thing that really, humans define our lives by how much misery we feel, yet we feel the most alive when we feel nothing but happiness. This was what he tried to tell his psyche tutor but was only greeted by "...and how many times have you seen the matrix?"   He didn't care anymore though, he had what he wanted, he had all that was needed. He smiled again as he patted the bulge in his left jacket pocket. It was cold against him, the end diggin into his ribs, not hard enough to hurt but enough to remind him that it was there. He had his headphones in and was listening to another metal band shouting at him, giving him a reason to be, giving him something to hold onto. Their lyrics might be as deep as meaningful as horse shit, but it was all he had at the moment.   The taunting had gotten worse at college, people yelling at him all the time because he didn't look like them, becuase he didn't act like them... because he wasn't one of them... They went home everyday to their nice apartments that their parents had paid for and ate their nice food that their girlfriends cooked for them. What did he go home to? Burnt spoons and boiled carrots. He scratched his arms at the memory, before smirking again. His own little victory against the world every time they didn't notice, not that they noticed much about him, nothing positive anyway.   He felt the leaves crunch underneath his feet as he walked to visit his parents. He always enjoyed the walk to see them, the brown and yellow leaves falling. dancing in the wind to the sound of a mute choir, the small animals running in front of him a long the path, the grey squirrels calming him with their scurrying. It was nice to be out here every so often amongst the trees and the wildlife, to get away from the smog and machinery that was his home in the city. He wondered why they had wanted to be out in the open this far, supposedly the same reason he liked it, it was far away from anything that was common to them.  He saw the meeting spot in front of him, the old buildings spires rising up aheadof him. This was the part he always dreaded, when he finally talked to them. He gritted his teeth and walked up the cobbles and then along the row. He knelt down at the end said what he always did, "Long time no see..." Their was no response, there never was, after all they were buried six feet under and he was just talking to a marble block. He didn't mind though, he used to, there were the nights when he spent ages lying in bed at night wondering why had it happened to him, what had he done wrong, did he deserve it? The only thing left to him was the toy car that his father had left him, beautifully crafted out of silver it reflected the light in such a way that it made you think it was worth a fortune. However with time it had dulled and the shine had become forgotten, much like all things did with time.   He loked again at the grave, "Y'know.. there was a long period where i thought i hated you" he began, "But then i realised it weren't your fault. It weren't your fault that they picked on me, that they beat me it was theirs and im gonna make them pay." He felt the bulge again, just to make sure it hadn't gone anyway. "It's ok dad i know what I'm doing, i know how I'm gonna deal with it. Hopefully I'll bne able to talk to you again real soon, even though i wont be able to see you..." A single solitary tear rolled down his cheek, splashing onto his shoe like the dew drops of a new morn.   He stepped back and looked at the tombstone and read the inscription "They died how they had always lived.... together" He had always loved his parents and the fact that they took their own lives was something he never forgave them for, until now. He had realised over the past few years what they were living through, the hell of being hated by both families, frowned on by the general public and spat on by the higher classes. Hell he'd even thought of it a few times himself. The tears were flowing fully now, streaming down both cheeks in a tidal wave of emotion, "I ...I don't blame you" he spluttered before reaching into his pocket to feel the cold metal touch his sking. He grabbed hold and drew it out of his pocket...   ...he sttopped crying and wiped his tears with his other arm, his other hand warming the metal slightly. He stepped forward to the tombstone and placed the model of a silver racing car onto the pedastal. Before waving goodbye to his parents, "Until next year..." he muttered to himself, "Happy Birthday Dad" he said to the rock, before putting the headphones back in his ear, and making the trek back to the awaiting city.    Woah...... id like to apolagise to any of you that read that.... i got bored ok????  Laters

						   "I found a cure for people using their mobile phone at innapropriate times......... I call it the gun"   We lost.... by a lot.... 75 - 0. Alas, Alack etc. but it happens every year so it was no great surprise. You just know that when I'm one of the best in the clas at a sport..... that we're just gonna lose.  And to all those tha bet on Hampden i ask this one question .... why?  Anyhoo i've been spurred into action and am writing something which i mihgt post up on here sometime...maybe... yes.  I am very tempted at this moment in time to go on a rant about bitching... i am very tempted to start preeching to you all like a catholic vicar and tell you why it's so wrong. But you've heard it all before so all i can do is just ask you to stop.... it really does accomplish nothing. Just try it for a week, go without bitching about anyone for that long an you'll see how much better your life is... and thats where i sotp before i make a ranting fool/jackass out of myself.  oh yer btw... i have just been given my advent calender from my rents.... suffice to say it would appeal to those of you who are fans of 'zing zing' and the rest of the crazy gang  Laters

						   Hellooooo   havent done this for a while so yet again it is time to unleash the torrents of my mind.  ...*wwwsssshhhh* .... *wssccchhhhh* ... *tumbleweed rolls*   Twas mienen bday ont hrsday ..which was cool so thanks to any well wishers etc. However an even bigger thankyou to people who decided not to give me beats..... the fact that i had warned that i would retaliate obviously affected nothing because i punch worse than a girl. and if it did.. then hah.. gullible idiots.....  Saturday was curry day with my family to celebrate my birth.... so that has meant cake on thursday.. cake on friday and cake again on saturday... oh how i love this time of year. Suffice to say my parents drank a little alcohol and after dinner when i ent back to my cave/hovel/dank hole to play my guitar quietly, i heard shouted requests from the downstairs. A half hour later and several ''I CANT PLAY THE BLOODY SHADOWS!!!'' later they shuttup... only five minutes later to be burdened by 'Smoke on the water!' ....geez parents.. whatcha gonna do? ....if u said 'if they were that drunk.. then i'd ask them for money' then well done. You win a cookie*  *cookie is only metaphorical.. it does not exist  On a nother.... slightly more geekish note, Knights of the old republic rawks my socks off.... well it would if i was wearing any. As murphy put it 'So ur going sock commando then?' ..odd odd man. Also while im not on the subject, i played on the wing yday for rugby, and laughed as during a maul we pushed the opposition at least 100 yards back. Dear god it was funny. Also when dk stood up covered in head to toe in mud and both me and guy thought, 'Now he's even more..... yeah!'.   Also. BUY TENACIOUS D's DVD!

						    Sugar Puffs  That is the title for my blog for the day after new years.... eventful ain't it?   I have just eaten the first bowl of sugar puffs I've had in a long while. It was one of those "do i like this? ...i can't remember" moments so i had some anyway. Suffice to say i remembered why I'm not tere biggest fan. (Although as i was hungry - it was appreciated)  1) The thing on the box is a big yellow hairy monster. This is far too similar to my dad to be healthy, and seeing its face at 10.30 (or whatever) in the morning after getting 5 opr so hours of sleep is not a good way to start the day  2) "Puffs of wheat dressed in a little honey jacket" The idea that my food should be personified and should be dressed properlyfor the occasion is a sombering thought for me. I don't like the idea of wheat being dressed for my dinner in its best jacket... especially when it doesn't taste like honey :s  3) You have to eat them rapidly - they after two minutes or so become water... well milk-logged [and if anyone says anything biology related i'll kill 'em ;)] This reduces them to a kind of mush with all of the "flavour" running out into the milk. This ...suffice to say leads to a not particularly well tasting snack.  However you can put sugar on them - which perks up any meal, but with any cereal this leaves you with a see-through syrup (sp?) that decays ur teeth to nothingness.  Yes.. so another random rant to ad to the list. Now i must sleep as i am very tired, that'll explain any poor grammar or spelling mistakes... that and my normal retardishness (i dont know).

						   It is now nearing new years eve and i lok back over my christmas and pause to think abouot what has happened....   The answer is not much. Exams still await us, my legs are still different sizes :(, my parents still treat me like I'm on parol and my brother's stupidity still astounds me to no end.   On the subject of exams (its not a subject  change  as such) how many people have started revising? ...and am I right in thinking it is only, in the majority the women? Perhaps us men care less, perhaps we are willing to wing our mocks... or perhaps, like me, we find it clinically impossible to revise. After five minutes of reading something I've already learnt, in this case America in the 1920's, shouted bollocks to this, threw my books on the desk and played XIII for two hours.   The xmas albums that i recieved/bought  Danko Jones - We sweat blood Many of you will have listened to/been forced to listen to Danko Jones by me. Without going off on one - its good  Beastie Boys - Ill communication The beastie boys with 20 tracks of genius especially Sure shot, Sabotage, Get it together, B-Boyz making witht the freak freak and sabrosa. White people rapping ...and rapping well  Gravediggaz - 6 feet deep (niggermortis)  Rzarector, The Grym Reaper, Gatekeeper and price paul producing ..*doesn't expect this to mean anything* ........ *it doesn't* but its good nonetheless.  Anyho that and Johnny vegas Dvd (yay) im happy.. ish  Hope you al got what u wanted for xmas and wish you all a happy new year.   Laters

Exams finish at 1 ish, followed by a trek to costa and this of course has the joys of saying 'a MASSIMO hot chocolate please' *smiles* and trying desperately not to laugh.   This was followed by a crashing session at Jimmy Z's with Vielhelm, Matthius and Ben-ha-mine (spanish dont ya know)  .....to which end i may now have lung cancer.... meh win some you lose some.   Bring on more time for me to squander and waste doing absolutely nowt, it makes the exams nearly worthwhile  Laters  p.s ive gone over 2000 now so w00ters and stuff

						   I arrived home today to discover my room had no computer in it. The monitor was there, the leads were lying across my floor.. hell the LAN was even plugged in, but alas my tower was nowhere to be seen. I looked all aroound the house, just to see that my family hadn't been using it for something in their room .. or something i was just lloking ok? Then i discover a note that read as follow  "Keith I have broken your pc, sorry. You'll have to use mine  Dad"   Suffice to say i was not happy and about 5 minutes of swearing and shouting ensued - lucky there was noone else home tbh. I am now on my dads computer deciding whether or not i shud delete his major files as a alittle revenge......  This on its own wouldnt annoy me enough to have a shouting session with him... however, combined with the fact that i told him 'don't use my pc without asking', coupled with the fact that every time i go near HIS pc i get told not to touch in case i break something.... i hope he appreciates the irony.

						   I decided to try and write somethign a little longer as opposed to a short, and I am succeeding. Here is the first page so far - theres a lot more to come kiddo's  [ NB: bare with the beginning it's not representative ;) ]                 "....He turned the volume up on his stereo, letting the soothing sounds of various metal bands drown him in their songs of hatred and greed. He couldn’t remember why he felt bad or why his stomach was churning over, but he knew there was a reason. Why couldn’t he just sit up and stop paying attention to all the crap around him. Why couldn’t he just stand up and shout till his throat hurt like he wanted to, or walk over to him and punch him square in the face until his nose broke. These were the things he wanted, the things he longed to do but alas instead he just sat there, up to his knees in self pity looking out the window at the world that could have been…"   	I sighed under my breath. It was another one of the stories I’d been sent by a self pro-claimed ‘aspiring writer’ wanting to use me as his test subject. I just laughed to myself and threw it into the rubbish bin next to me. The last thing anyone wanted to read was another piece of angst from a bored middle class teenager. So where does this leave me? I’m sat in a coffee-house sipping my massimo mocha latte…  whatever it’s called and reading through the rest of the hopefuls. The world was passing by the windows as I looked out, whiling away the hours. A mother with her two children, pushing the buggy with the younger, more docile child held within. All the while making sure the other child did not accidentally smother it with his jumper that he’d got tired of holding. It was a scene any family man saw, the bickering between mother and son, the love of the mother shining throughout, not always visible but undeniably there.  On the other corner there was the other side of life; a young girl of about 10 years disguising herself as 16 or older. This was the saddening thing about what was happening today, people growing up too fast – childhood not existing anymore. I smirked to myself, It’d always amused me how up until the age of about 25 you strive to make yourself look older, to try and be accepted by the people you saw in magazines and on TV. Then suddenly, you became almost neurotic in thinking you looked too old, you suddenly wanted to capture the youth and childhood you had thrown away so easily in early life. I’d never really grown up, or so I was always being told. Parents, friends, teachers and later professors and bosses always asking, ‘When are you going to grow up?” To these people I always gave the same reply; “Never, I hope.”   	I pushed my musings to one side as I saw the family walk past the café and continue down the street towards the subway. The bag next to me however hadn’t moved, and was full with more short stories and reviews from the fan base, all asking for critique and ‘insight into the mind of a writer’. It was this very thing in itself that annoyed me, the way that I was supposed to be deified for using my imagination. Everyone is capable of writing, all it takes is time and a good imagination. Hell, I was far from well trained in the matter – I’d been studying chemistry at Birmingham Uni. for Christ sake! I sighed to myself and picked up the next folder, before re-ordering my fourth coffee of the day.  ‘Dear Mr. Stevens.’… I had made several books by now, some of which this person has read other wise my opinion would be nothing. Surely he must realise it’s spelt ‘Stephens’? The mind boggles, it really does. I carried on reading regardless. ‘… I ask for your advice on a piece I have written. It is a short I wrote during a troublesome time and this was my way of dealing with it.  - Mark Hallcourt, aged 15’  	‘I was cold. So very cold. The warmth of the world had been sucked away from me, the emotion-vampire draining me of my spirit. I sat on my bed curled in a ball, lying there confused I wondered about what was happening in the world outside me. Friends that were passing me by, I hated myself, I hated my parents, hated everyone in fact. I wish the pain would just go away…’  “Oh bollocks to this!” I shouted, disturbing some of the other drinkers and making one old man nearly spill his cocoa. “Trouble in paradise ay John?” A smirk blazoned across my face. The same old cliché’s everyday, yet somehow with him they never became tiresome. “Still repeating what you say are we Tommy?” I swivelled around in my chair, it was one of those steel one’s with wooden latticework, very artistic but made your back hurt something chronic. He was dressed just as he always was; the familiar baggy, dark blue jeans, ragged grey T-shirt and battered brown duffel coat. It was his uniform of a type, you never saw him without it. It was what people like him were destined to always wear. “How goes the house hunt Tommy?” The smirk was still in place, the joke we always shared when I saw him.  “How goes the diet?” he retorted, his own face now smiling along with me. “Ah touché,” I replied, looking down to see that he was right, I could stand to lose a bit of weight. Just being a writer wasn’t a particularly physical job, at least it wasn’t for me anyway.  Anyhoo.... thats that done, more will be posted when its done.. mebe. Criticism welcomed etc.  Aloha

						   *Ive just read what i wrote... you may not want to bother as its boring and pointles... dont say i didnt warn u!*  Im sat here at my dad's computer bord off of my tits. I find myself sitting here and wondering how I came to be the person I am, what happened in my life that made me how i am today. I have no great depressing life story, I have no life of amazing wealth I am mediocre. I am mediocrity with a superiority complex.   Hmm... time to explain myself to y'all i spose.  Hi my names Keith I'm an angst-aholic, I've been clean for going on a week now. I find myself spending a lot of my time trying to make myself not think. I read books and learn about other peoples lives, get caught up in storylines because they're more interesting than life. I spend hours listening to music to try and distract myself, holding in al the anger I feel just in case I let off in any direction like a pent up fire hose. Why am I angry? what do i feel inside? Hell i dunno myself thats why I sit and wonder. I once had someone say 'Your too deep for you own good' ...can't remember who it was but it stuck in my mind. However I can't say any of this to any of you in person because of the way I am. I'd just say "I'm fine" before making a sarcastic comment to detract atention away from whatever it was we were talking about. I could rant on about the government and the way that, without knowing it, we're being screwed over every day of our lives, but that would either open your eyes, or make you opinions of me crash into the ground.... ironic as this is probably just what writing this is doing.  My life stories uneventful 'A wedding and four funerals' about sums it up. My life was backwards my parents didn't care... Now thats what u were expecting right? Well thats not it, i have a damn good life in comparison to other people. and as for my experience with death - i know they ll had damn gud lives too. I've said before now that I do not fear death itself, but the wasting of a life.  I am not a religious man, i do not follow a strict faith. I question God's existence whenever I see news of famines or wars or when a young child is kidnapped and worse... It is the old question that people have never really been able to answer 'If God is real, then why is there so much suffering in the world?' They explain it by saying 'God is merely testing us' ..... no he's not, he's killing us! Like in the book of Job, it is shown that God is capable of being a bastard, which is not an aspect i want in the man that is judging whether i have had a good life or not. In the ways of god so far the best way of belief I have hard has been the Mormon religion to be honest. You die and go to a limbo with all of your friends and family - to a place where time is relative so you all appear to arrive at the same time. You then wait until the end of time where you pass on to another plain of existence and become a god yourself. Ignoring the slightly cult-like ways of this, it seemse to be a pretty positive way of thinking about death.   Why do we have wars? Humans as a species are unique in the way that we hunt animals for sport, whereas they do it merely to get their next meal. However, like these animals we fight to the bitter end to protect our territory from invasion. This is what past wars have been about (WW1, WW2). Then the nature of warfare changed, men weren't doing the fighting against other soldiers - they were dropping bombs on innocents who on the most part wanted nothing to do with the wars. Im using the gulf wars as my main example here.   Now as for how we're being screwed over. We are the most heavily taxed country on the planet (its like the old saying '60% of all figures are made up on the spot:P) and if we are not, then we are one of the most heavily taxed in the world. This would in itself not be a bad thing if we had decent services. 'Oh but we have the NHS' .... so? We have a free service yes, but a free service that is patheitcally treated and cause people to go private. The government just throws money at it and prays it'll go away. I take as my exampl when i wrenched my ankle last year. I arrived hobbling into casualty supported by my brother and hopping over to the desk i sat down. I was, not to sound melodramatic, in a rather large amount of pain. The woman behind the desk then proceeded to take my details and add to them my age etc. She then presented me with a chart of faces.. cartoon faces with different expression ranging from :D to a very angry face indeed. This was my 'pain guide' and i  was to ppint to which one looked the best. Bear in mind i am wearing a slipper two sizes two big, a coat that isnt mine, my school clothes and one leg of my trouser rolled up.. now here i was pointing at faces on a fucking chart. It's nice to be look an utter twat i shud do it more often... (ythe ironys there kiddos exploit it).I then was asked 'Can you walk' to which the answer was a polite 'NO YOU DAPPY BITCH' ...Well actually it was a 'no i cant' but hey. I was then told that they had no more wheelchairs left ... this was a hospital, an accident and EMERGENCY ward... with no wheelchairs. Instead i was presented with a wooden chair with a seabelt which loked like i was riding a book troley. There was also no wher to put my feet and the wheel didnt work so i had to be dragged.  So i waited.. and waited... a half hour later my painkillers arrived after the reception had dealt with a total of... nobody.  So then another hour and a half later the doctor sees me. I am dragged - with my foot dragging along the floor which did not help my ankle any. Suffice to say it wasn't a fun experience - i wont go into the toils of x-rays for now as i have probably written too much anyway.  That shows a portion of why I'm biter towards the NHS .. but not the rest of the world.   My predjudice towards women - the onyl girls in my old school were on the whole slags. They would play the boys off against each other and would take a role of dominance.. ironic for the times. Anyway i was the young innocent Keith back then, I was also a loner. I had the friends and all but I'd find excuses not to hang with them, excuses why i wouldn't be like the rest of them. I was the bitter sarcastic one who sat at the table and waited for ppl to slip up (every school had one). To put it bluntly, i wasn't a very nice person and in some respects I'm still the same evil bastard I always have been. Anyway i digressed.. the women i grew up with were bitches.. i could elaborate but id rather not and hell ive written too much anyway.   Why i dislike authority and the government - I have always been distrustful of any authority figure, you just know that when they;re up on that podium preaching about how they're going to fix all the problems that previous pppl have left behind that they're just preaching to the crowd. The world is one great big propaganda machine and we're taking in all of its bullshit. (do i sound like an anarchist or a hippy... no just a raving idiot as per usual). Not to go on shouting and ranting angsty bullshit.. but im gonna anyway. Im not gonna say that all people are lying to you I'm not paranoid. All you have to do is take the things people say with a pinch.. or sometimes a shovel full of salt. This is because very often they are just saying what they think you want to hear - not actually what they think or what is happening in truth.  Anyway I think I've ranted enough for one day ... even though I've written god knows how much and explained so very little... ah well one day lol.

						   Yes i am aware how biased the last post was. Why did i do it? ... why? To prove a point. Bear with it'll take some explaining.   Yes i know how the media effectively brainwashes women to be thin, to the extents of women forcing themselves to throw up, to going to have plastic surgey to make their breasts larger or their face more "beautiful". Yes it is sickening. Yes i know how women are discriminated against in the workplace and paid less. But i didn't include this in the previous statment. Why you may ask yourself if i know these things to be true did i not include them? Surely that would be logical?  i listed before a large number of reasons why i believe women to be higher up, more evil and generally as if they control what men do and say when we are around them. In doing so I showed what men contribute to the equation - they spend the whole of their lives being derogitary to women. Deep down inside every man harbours 'Inspector Monkfish' just beneath the surface. Thats what the post was showing, the fact that no matter what happens men will always blame women. They are our sca[egoats, we rant on about women becausethey dont like us, because they're immature, because they do better than us at school, because they dont fancy us and because one day they will take over as heads of the planet.  That is the only thing i believe from the previosu post - eventually women will be better than men and the cycle eill start over, with there being no equality. Apart from this u shud realise, as emma pointed out.. (i cant remember if thats true or not) that nearly everything i have listed, men do as well.   Men guilt trip, men bitch, men gossip (well not real men of course but some of you "lesser men" :P), men say 'cuh women...' just like you do, men often push people too far if they know they wont fight back, men have their own stupid sayings, some men constantly need to be complimented and are neurotic, just most women don't need it.  Why did i decide to do this as opposed to try and structure a logical standard argument? 1 - i was bored 2 - i like to fuck wit' ya and due to the dep rooted emotional problems i have this is how i do it.  I'd just like to reiterate: 'Men are from Earth, Women are from Earth... deal with it'  ... i feel a new mantra develpoing

						    Men Vs. Women   The age old argument. It is my opinion that men and women will never be equal as women have certain liberties that men are not allowed.   1) A woman can push something far further than a man (no sexual innuendos please). In other words, in an argumetn or if the woman wants information she can keep going until she wants to stop.... However if a man had done this they would have been knocked unconcious with a nearby object.  2)Women can hurt men, but men can't hurt women. Women can kick us in the balls, scratch our arms.. hell anything they feel like doing. But we cannot retaliate.   3) 'You can't do that to me.. I'm a woman!' - this is just plain unfair.  4) Women guilt trip men to make them do what they want.  5) Women can say 'cuh men..' and we, suddenly become the reason for all of there problems. Not to mention the generalising factor which i wont go into.  6) 'If you don't know why, then I'm not going to tell you'  - thats just stupid   But wait, some of you may be thinking 'Well there must be a reason'. 'Yeah...' or 'Oh I'm gonna make sure he never has kids.....'   What men are allowed to do around other men.  Insut each other, fart, burp, drink, scratch themselves, speak their minds, tell someone they look bad, say 'your stupid' without repercussions.  What men are allowed to do around women  Compliment them, have to reiterate the fact that they are joking, not be mean in any way  I notice a certain difference between the two. But is the fault the womens or the mens? Well its a bit of both to be honest. Women tend to take things more seriously than men, but men tend to be ruder and cruder than is acceptable by most modern standards.  Two quote an old bitter man:  "I saw a postcard yesterday that said 'Men are from Earth, Women are from Earth... deal with it' "   My sentiments exactly.

						   I am angry.. grr.. etc.  Mostly at myself but at some ppl that i will now list off:  1)Mrs Motteram (my french teacher). For those of you that do not know, my frenhc teacher thinks that I am depressed. Why? Because i sit in the corner of her lessons saying the answers to her questions loud enough for me and rzz to know they're right. Then when she says the answer recieving puzzled/inquisitive/hateful looks from the people around me because I got the answer when they couldn't.  She said that I should get involved more in lessons - that way I could help move the lessons on in the slow boring parts, I tried this once and i hated it, I felt like such an arrogant boffin to have to answer the questions and sit there going over the answers because people didn't understand them.  I am not alone in this, I'm sure Rob Payne, Ben Joy and Razz feel like this for the majority of the time, along with the ever-present Wardi. When we (after the mocks) were presented with a list of foundation papers... suffice to say we were'nt best pleased. I had an A.. i had 11 points away from an A* .... would doing a foundation grade help my grade any? ... no, no it wouldn't. It was the same for quite a few people, but yet we were all forced to go through the torture of answering stupidly easy questions and being told off when I moaned that it was a redundant excersise and that she was taking the piss. Ah well.. c'est la vie  2) Mr Williams - The reasons are self evident. Despite the fact I think he is  a jumped-up egomaniac.. he seems to find pleasure in telling us that we are the worst year he's ever had. All tho.. the incident that caused so much disgust.. was sick.  3) MEeeeEEEeee for reasons i wont go into   4) Coincidence  5) Bad timing  6) Bad bacon - every so often u get a packet where it just tastes like shit... just me then  Where was i going with this? .. i cant remember.. ah well my guitar calls  Laters

						   "Your a really good friend ya know that?" Yer i know.. now get outta my house before i bitchslap you."  I wish my parents would go away more often..... I have just had ppl leave my house after a few hours of fun filled activity, i then devoured a chinese within about ten minutes (chicken wings, beef and mushrooms and egg fried rice). Ad now... atm.. i am sat here with my shirt and socks off enjoying the breeze from the back door (the joys of infra red keyboards). Oh and yes.. i am in the study...  Its so much better without rules.. i can just shout CUNT!! (i did it out loud at the top of my voice) ... no repurcussions!  I feel somewhat ..fulfilled today. I have no greivances against anything, man or beast. For some strange reason I am reminded of my time spent in IT today, wherein a sequence of events occured  Fadhill: "....one such answer is double entry..." Me: "Thats a double entendre" Erwood: "Glad im not the only one that noticed" *chuckles*  what can i say.. we're easily amused, and this and snapping pencils on erwoods forehead filled up most of the lesson.   Anyhoo.. i feel  little or no anger towards anyone, not to caleb, not to ross :O, not to will c, not even to the small stubbly one (no one will know who that is... not even them).

						   Contrary to many... well one technically,.. one of your beliefs (ie emma) my last post, although a tad depressing, was not a suicide letter. This is for three reasons  1) Believe it or not, somewhere deep down i do have something called pride. (:O shocking but true). I have too much pride to 'chicken out' in my view.  2) I don't have the guts to do it - i mean come on... ergh..  3) It isn't THAT bad a problem.   There you go (for once i actually had a third point?!?!?).  Sorry for all the manic depression and random crap that my few readers may have been reading over the past ..however long...  One day i will be back to the happy cheery person i was ... in yr7 =/. Reminds me of the lyric:  '... Well since age twelve, I’ve felt like I’m someone else - Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt...'   Yes so soon it wil be a return to the normal posts as opposed to the boring depressive crap that has become this blogs life.

						   I  just spent the best part of half an hour running walking, and sitting on an electrical station (the green metal blocks on the side of the roads). It gave me time to think, reflect and ponder about the future and what this holds for me.  The reason? Well my oh so loving parents have just told me that probably at the end of this year I will be moving to scarborough, in the north of England... 300 fucking miles away... So thats just hunky dory. After a damn good week-end of hanging with Ollie, Will, Hannah and Jen in MK, along with Ollie's crew and Erwood made a camio appearance randomly. Then a nice evening where i was accoste4d by a radiator, strummed guitar and watched some good films at el casa del Racheal. Then i met up randomly today with Ben and Emma while shopping with my bro. Then when i get taken home what am i greeted with? ...... what a nice round off to my weekend that was....  It's such perfect timing as well, because the majority of my current friends I met not all that long ago so the friends i've lost favour with over the years will not miss me, and soon it will be, '..Hey dya remember tha lanky kid that hung around with us?' '....oh yer, Kevin weren't it?' (yes i am aware how pitiful it sounds, and i dont believe it ... fully). Oh year .. and why do ppl mix Keith and Kevin? ... they begin with a K so that makes it so very easy to confuse. Like Michael and Martin i spose... anyway i digress where was I .... AH YES! Angst:  I am afraid of change and as much as I piss and moan about where I live - I don't mean it. I love Aylesbury, i was born here, i could live here and i could very happily die here and be buried in the graveyard up town near the Museum. Altho I'd more likely be cremated as the idea of being underground in a box.. isn't very appealing to me. Anyhoo where is Scarborough? Well it is in the North of England 30 miles ish away (which i think i covered). Altho it does have a beach and a row of arcades and as my dad keeps telling me 'a good sixth form college' ..immediatly followed by 'but not as good as a grammar school'. The point is self-evident isn't it really?  If its better from a grammar school... THEN WHY CAN'T I STAY THERE! Damn logic, even when it works in your favour some people don't get it =/.   So why do Inot want to move to this sea-side resort and leave this 'crap-hole' as i call it so often? Because i like the taste of shit. I like this town and i can't imagine living anywhere else. Also I'm afraid of change. (reminds me of the family guy episodew 'Lois look the two symbols of the republican party. An elephant and a big fat white guy thats threatened by change...') I often say this but it's actually true. I'm not the best 'people person' in the world and making friends does not come easily to me. So its gonna be fun moving into a new city, in the north of england (and with this accent!?!). I want to stay on for a-level and enjoy my study leave we get by hanging with mates and people i already know. Not by sitting around trying to make friends with new people. New people... ergh...   Altho there is a large plus side that I would quite like. Takign my acoustic guitar to the beach and sitting out on a rock with my fet dangling off the edge, strumming away as i watch the seunset and hear the soft sound f the waves breaking around me, my feet adbbling in the water. Now that would be sweet....  Anyhoo I know that I can be a bit of a burden to carry and that sometimes I'm not really the best of company to keep and I'm gonna use this time to apolagise.  Razz - I use you for the brunt of many of my jokes, I routinely mock ya and I'm sorry man. Ya know i got your back if ya need it. Will - Your not gay, we both know that.  Rach - your evil, pure evil .. only kidding. I apolagise for the several times over the past... whenever, that i have annoyed you. Hannah - You will always in my mind be 6ft tall ;). You are intelligent no matter what people say and no one gives a flying fuck about spelling. Jen and Clare - your both quiet and I never really got to know ya that well, but i count you as friends and if i've ever anoyed/pissed you off then I apolagise.  Kt - Your kinda loud, and when i first met you - i thought a bit too loud, but i've got used to it and im glad i did. Zoe - I'll miss ya, and im sorry for everything. Shyam - I use ya for jokes man - but you ma nigger (I's a nigger) *does black handshake thing* Ollie - Bi up ya'self man! Don't think all that shizzle you know you da man. (its fun to talk like this). Dude seriously here's a spade, dig urself outta ur pit and go get slaughtered with random women. Slip in the fact ur a dee-jay (kevin and perry style) they'll be all over ya like bee's on honey. Mike - if your reading this.. your proabably as bored as i am. Carry on doing what u do man. Live life how you like it. Emma - Take anything bad I've ever said, or u ever thought i said. Put it in a big blender. I apolagise. Plus your really tinily thin ;) Ben - I'm sorry I've made a load of people call you hickson as apposed to your real name (including my family =/) and anything else collected together that ive done ta bug ya over the years.   Anyone I've missed and to all the aformentioned peolple - Live life to the full, ya don't know when something is gonna change

						   I'm at school, 'Learning'. I say learning... because if i was actually learning I wouldn't be on here now would I? What am I doing then. Well I'm updating my log, what a stupid question.. the reason why however is beacuse i have less than half of my IT class present at school today. I am in a class of... wait for it... 5. Erwood says... ''GOD I HATE MR WILLIAMS!!!". Thats it 5 people, my chemistry calss was 6, my french was 6, my Maths was roughly 15.   I am in a dictatorship, I expect good ol' Adolf to pop out of the staff room smoking a cigar and laughing at all of us. That small moustache bristling up and down on his chin. The teachers agree with us.... which is rare. They seem to think that this is a pointless excersise and a shambles. They want to be out as much as we do, Mrs Furney even says 'I wish i was out sledding'. (Erwood wishes it to be known he finds this, and me mentally unstable).   We are not allowed on the field, as that is counted as 'fun'. We are not allowed in our classrooms, because that is counted as 'shelter', we have teachers guarding the exits from our school to make sure we don't leave our classes and perhaps go home..... like everyone else in Buckinghamshire. We have less than half the school here, hell Id be surprised if we had a quarter of the school here. But we cannot leave, me musn't, we might miss out on some valuable education.... such as the sorting books and sperating large chunks of chalk from smaller ones in chemistry.   I give it a week. A week until we have to paradethe quad singing, 'All hail the new Fuhrer' and eating bratwurst while sucking down some good old fashioned Saurcraut (sp?). It's only a matter of time before the new shower block is installed....  HAIL FUHRER

						   I just got back from eating, my chippy has damn good chips :D. Have been outside in the snow playing with me mate ash and some other random ppl i know. .... Call me immature if u wish, i just dont care. It's fun to be out in the snow.   On another note .. though it will become related later.  Do I intimidate you? Does my height make you somehow think 'I have to prove myself against him' (this is mainly to the dudes, but to all of you). No? Yes?  Now picture yourself as a twenty year old man...... would you find me as a person intimidating. I am a sixteen year old lad, ok i may be tall and ..altho I seem strong to you lot, its nowt compared to most blokes. But why does this mean that men older than me feel a need to prove that they are tougher than me. It is somethign that vexes me greatly.  This culminated tonight in my one of my mates brothers squaring up to me and challenging me to some masculine ego contest. How? Well it appears that he took the fact that i threw a snowball at him in a snowball fight a little seriously.... this, despite being a little petty, seems like the argument i shouldn't have to have with a grown man. Alas it seems that he feels the need to construct a huge ball of ice to throw at me to excact his revenge. This he threw at my chest later in the evening as i was walking home to get my takeaway.... he obviously failed to take into account that ice breaks when it hits me. So it left him feeling more stupid than if he'd ave done nothing and acted like an adult.. i find it ironic that i act more mature than the people around me, who are sometimes five or so years older than me :S.   Ah well, it will continue to puzzle me i spose.  Laters

						   one word to make all happy... SNOW!!   I decided that after getting off my bus to put my dignity aside ..(yes im joking).. and had a snowball fight with the small people on my bus. Yr 9's fromt he high however, seem to be overly cnocious about their hair.  I now sit and watch the snow fall and pray some will be left tomorrow... SNOW!!  However my gloves didn't help much.. unsurprisingly... and I now have v cold fingers which makes typing an .. interesting experience.   Laters

Why? ... well i cbb to write it out on here, suffice to say we were not best pleased.

						   Guitar strings  These things ..are bastards. I had to change one over today as I was a little too violent when playing some power chords. This then led to a 1/4 of an hour of me scratching my head going.. 'How do I..?' Before deciding to suck up my pride and ask. This then led to a period of relative joy... before realising that i had spent 5 minutes fumbling like a gibbon trying to get the string to wrap around the top of the guitar. .. fifteen mionutes and several cut fingers later I had myself a fully tuned working guitar again.  Note to everyone.. don't break guitar strings... they're a bastard to change.   yes  Laters

						   I have but one mission in life - To travel to space and flip off the world....  ..... Anyway....  Today was an intriguing day...... not really, I was lying. It was a thursday - that means IT lessons. For tose of you that don't know what that entails, it means nearly a double period of us sitting around listening to Fadhill try and spak some english to us. It also involves many sarcastic jibes towards said teacher. He is from turkey/russia/a concentration camp, we just don't know. So wehn a picture comes onto the creen of a watchtower in a field.... we of course let our imaginations wander...  This is the story so far: He escaped from a camp somewhere in his homeland, leaving behind his wife and several illegitamate children to other people. He then stole a canoe and rowed down the river, from his camp towards safety. Upon arrving at said town, he realised it was impossible for him to flee the country wihtout some serious planning. His plan was as follows - He joined a computer factory and started working on the construction of minor machines. He worked his way up in the ranks (all the while learning the ways of computers) until he was, on a glorious sunday afternoon, put in charge of the boxing-up of the computers. He then, at the end of the shift, marked a box for europe and packaged himself inside of it.  Amazon then sent the "computer" to England, where it was opened up by a family in the south of said country, ful of eager-eyed young children and inquisitive adults. He then took his time to pounce, burst the box open and fled to safety. After a few months of hiding out in houses around the town he then managed to get a job teaching at AGS. ... The children are seeking medical and psychiatric help.*  (*story is fictional.... or is that just what i want you to think?) *...peels of face mask* Thats right kiddies.. I'm Stalin *Dun dun duuuun*  Woahh went a little kerazy there... ahem  Anyhoo i now have geo hwk to do, laters all

						   It's been an ... interesting week so far.  The week began where it always does... on a sunday.. But as that was uneventful in the majority I shall start with the monday. More particularly, I wish to focus on the last two periods of monday that was football with Mr. Williams.  Now, for those of you that don't know - Mr Williams is our head of year and he, as such likes to score points against us and especially Erwood. When we went down 3 - 0 to his team he said as much, shouting "Revenge.. revenge!" at Erwood. His smirk soon lessened when the tables turned....  Picture the scene: A thirty odd year old man, intimidated by people half his age. It was a spectaclar thing to be part of i must say. I remember Erwood and Robie's mirth when, unlike taking it around other people playing... he merely punted the ball in frustration when I charged at him. ...twas a glorioius day for me *smokes pipe in reminiscent manner*  On a diferent note - saw Big Fish today. (yes hannah i did actually watch it :P) It is pretty damn good... and that would be my oh-so eloquent review... Lots of timeshifts that could make for confusion, but the plot and its varied cast of people from Danny De-vito to the woman from fight club (can't remember her name :S)  Anyway.. recommend it to all - go see now.. or later, whenever.

						    Credit   today Keith spent a large majority of the day lokign around for places in which to buy credit. Keith is now tired and wants to  a) kill the head-chief of orange b) sleep  c) wash down his pasty with something resembling liquid  The tale of his adventures is long and winding... but it will be written anyway. (also as he is bored, Keith will be writing this whole post in the third person..... enjoy :P)  He was informed that the shop across the road, a respectable tesco's  express  would have credit. With this knowledge and then money he now had acquired from parents and his account, Keith charged across the road into the small breeze that had begun to form. ....Keiths family were liars, they had "run out" of orange credit, and along witht his - all the pamphlets for electronic top-up cards had, had their contents swiped, without them being replenished.  Keith then retruned home ... to his house and scabbed a lift from his brother who happened to be going to town with his biatch. They dropped him off at the newer tescos as this was convenint for them.. not so for keith. He walked inside and tried to purchase credit here, to be told that orange no longer did vouchers and that withoud an e-top up card he was like a welsh sheep.... buggered. (any oppertunity i know) Keith Registered his top-up card and mashed the key pad on his phone in a ain attempt to understand this strange piece of equipment. Twenty minutes were allowed to pass to make sure the card had registered properly, he walked into the shop and tried valiantly to buy some credit. He was shot down as the person told him the card did not work. Angered, but not giving up he decided to run into town and get some from the orange shop. This was when he discovered the gentle breeze had changed into a violent wind... which he was now walking into. Suffice to say it took a bit longer than usual to get into town.  He eventually arrived, walked to the orange shop, for they would surely have the credit he so dearly seeked?!? Alas, as it was a sunday, no such luck - the shop was closed. No problem he thought to himself, I shll go to the link instead. Now, for those of you not familiar with the link on a sunday - here's what happens. You have at least seven customers in the shop all wanting to see different phones or to return a malfunctioning one. These are all things that take time and they have a total o *drumroll* ...two staff working. One of these didnt know what he was doing and had to keep asking the other dude to help. Twenty minutes of queuing was enough to annoy him beyond belief as there was no sign of his credit happening any soon. Keith left the link with a mumble of 'fuck this'. His last stop, the last store open, his salvation neared... Woolworths. His quest was nearly over his credit within reach. He gave over his 15quid and recieved his credit. There was much rejoicing. Naute had now been calling for about half an hour, keith felt it necessary to answer this call for if he didn't nature might just pop out and bite his arse of. After this he celebrated - Keith went to superdurg, bought his pastie, started textering and began his walk home. However he had forgotten the wind....  Half an hour later a much tired Keith returned home to his loving... empty house, collapsed onto his bed and started strumming.  The end.

						   I have a really wierd thought pattern... i think my brain does actually work backwards.  On another un-related note, I returned home to find that my dad had passed his book-keeping exam today, with a score of 92%. There was much rejoicing in the household, as if my dad had been dfoing a course like this at a college.. he'd have been doing it for 9 months. He'd been doing it at home for about two.... so there was indeed much rejoicing. This meant that we went over the pub, where I consumed a gammon hock... basically a pig leg. So me = :D.   What else has been happening, well I've become re-addicted to Call Of Duty. Sad but true. "Hi I'm Keith, and I'm a shoot-a-holic. I can't help but kill those damn Nazi's... I love to here their bodies fall over, i love to see the blood..." ... ANYWAY! Enough of my moronic rambings, they have most likely driven you away by now.   Also I have a craving for.. something. I think I've had too much rock.   It's eleven twenty =/. G'night

						   The women of scarborough must be very unhappy people.   ...'Strange beginning' you may be thinking. You'd be write, it is but there is a reason for it. I was walking around the streets of scarborough last night after I had eaten a large Chicken Biryani and drunk my pint of John smiths... (northerners rock!)... we noticed that a lot of the 20-30 age group had.. certain car modifications. Suffice to say, the men of the area had bigger spoilers than the wings on most planes and they had really huge engines, coincidentally louder than most planes.  When the cars roared past us, engines revving I saw the puzzled looks of my parents towards these strange beings and felt the need to translate for them. "The engine is code Mum, - it means 'I have a small penis' " After drinking a bottle of wine between them, they began to tolerate my "humour" and instead of going 'dont be so disgusting' they merely laughed at the unsuspecting townies.   Also on another note, the women folk of scarborough are members of the local S.A. (and no i don't mean hitlers force... just think about it) I average 1 in 10 ppl will understand what I mean by this, so just to clear it up. I was being whisteld at when walking along the front by 20 yr olds and the evening dress was of belt sized proportions. ...Ya get it yet?   What else... oh yes. Turns out i drove all the way up to scarborough, to spend the rest of the time i was there driving round looking at houses and areas. I've done more u-turns than a gay plumber ... wait that doesnt make sense!! ...ah well... Suffice to say i was not best pleased.   The food was cool, everything is soo much cheaper. Breakfast - full english including: sausage, eggs, bacon, beans, fried bread and toast for a couple of quid - not like the shit you get at tesco either. This was followed by lunch - a freshly cooked half baquette, filled to the brim with cooked pork and fried onions, all coated in a shiteload of apple sauce..... quite why I'm writing down my culenary habits/tastes is beyond me.. But hey - my blog, my rules. Plus i've spent two day s chowing down on more sweets and mints ... and now rock (the seaside kind, not the granite kind) and I am on a liiiiie bit of a sugar high. I've actually had the urge to go WEEEEEEEEEEEE but didn't, as I have got some small remainder of dignity left.   What have I learned from my time in scarborough? Well all of the arcades are still tehre that I kne when i was yonug, aslas the golf course has been dug up to be used as sea wall protection. My dreams of playing guitar on the beach may soon be becoming a reality and I leave you all with a thought.   Do not be afraid of change. Without change we would never evolve.  Laters

						   My back: 'hurts like a bitch, that I did last night' (family guy reference)  The combination of excersise, walking ... and then sitting on my arse at my computer for the rest of the day; hunched over like an evil professor, appears not to sit too kindly with it.  The best thing tho? Long car journeys really help chronic back pain....   I'm gone till tuesday, which will explain the lack of 'Plitec' on your msn lists, along with the lack of witty repartee in you r lives :P. Enjoy your time without me here - all 2 ppl that i've seen over the holidays =/. Hell, you even may learn to love it.   Laters

						   For once on valentines day i was not my bitter old-man-ish kinda self. So that was fun.   A lot of time , I have noticed I am labelled at my school as being "depressed". I have noticed this more over the past weeks, that when I'm not depresed - when I am in fact quite the oppostite. (ooh the clash of tenses =/). This is quite an annoyance to me for some reason, I find it annoying having people go 'You always so depresed'... no I'm not, and how does me making a stupid and vulgar joke then qualify that statement to come into being.  After all I am going up to scarborough mid week to look at areas that might be nice to live in.. so ten hours in a car there and back to look forward to =/.   ...   sigh  ...  Anyway.. Happy, Happy!!. Despite what you all may think of my persona, how i piss, moan, take apart your lives, am pessimistic, cynical and al in all a dour bugger.. I am actually happy :D:D for reasons you all know, and if you don't - good. Your obviously paying more attention to your life than the lives of others - go you *thumbs up*. Either that or your on the wrong page and in that case *loads shotgun* ... doors to you left*  *taken from ..the place of genius  News:  I am going through a nirvana phase atm and am learning a lot of stuff, as well as improving my chords change-overs.. so thats fun.  I'm gonna have to get a job soon, my money is going down the metaphorical shitter faster than vindaloo the morning after a stag night. (queue the 'EWW' from several people) Speaking of vindaloo, how many ppl have tried it/actually like it? I have never had the pleasure of eating this intriguing dish, but that doesnt stop me comparing it to eating lava.  The reports were put together on thurs, which is really jsut an excuse for us to think up elaborate ways to hide our bad grades from our parents (one of the thigns this school has right). In reality it is their way of geting cheap labour to sort out all of the reports into pilews in alphabetically order... did i say 'cheap'? I meant free...  Oil prices incerase as the taxes go up once again fo- .... oh wait I forgot, the news has to be dummed down. I am probably alone in this - I watch the news. I say this without shame.. well with a little shame, but in the mornings i watch it and hear al the important events and aspects of the government etc. that are important to my day. At dinner time however I am bombarded with another kind of "news" , news of a cats great strugle to crawl aloong a large pipe. Or how kids from some primary school have managed to make a mosaic on one of their classrooms walls. This begs teh questoin, 'Why should I care', it's the news becoming more 'in-tune- with the common peopl.. but its gone one step too far and is dealing with pap I would expect from you've been framed or some such thing...  wow i can actually rant about anything =/  i'll stop before i go overboard.. again Laters

						   Graveltrap rock. That is my decree across the nation.   I went to the pitz yday and.... enjoyed it, surprisingly. Whats even more surprising is that ....... I enjoyed spunge's set =/. Although do not judge me yet, for there is good reason. The support was damn good with both Graveltrap and 'Never heard of it' kicking asssss. The moshnig, skanking and stuff made me all :D and this made punges set rock.... altho if i listened to cd's even now... i'd still think they suck. Highlights of the evening being when I heard two women runn over to their mates shouting "{We got cigarettes by being lesbians!!!". Also it semed everyone who wanted to crowd surf asked me to help them.. i must've picked up like twenty people =/... my shoulders are paying the price today lol. Also randomly ran into Rob and Grif who were hanging around so that was cool. Oh yeah.. it appears that all peoples minds work the same as at the beginning of the spunge set, i heard at least five people (including myself) make the same joke withing seconds of each other "I love the smell of skunk in the morning"  It appears all minds do work alike  Laters

						   It's quarter to ten as i start to write. I find myself where I usually am at this time of the evening - here at my computer. My dad is playing Call of Duty downstairs and my mum is asleep, my bros out somehwere either working or ... well not doing much.  My guitar is across my lap awaiting some strumming, but my finger callouses are gieting kinda thick, and some are kinda sore from a mixture of frantically trying to learn chord change-overs and stuff. My novel starts its ... second chapter (can't really find the right timulus to write atm) and I sit here in ponderance. It seems that at a certain age when hormones kick into overdrive (...in other words the 15-17 age group) we spend the majority of our lives trying to define them. We, as a whole I have noticed spend a lot of time worrying about what other people think/say/do/ and have started to focus to much on other people and their opinions. Where have the times of tenagers rebelling against the norm?  It appears that it has died, replaced with a huge mass of people all trying to fit in with their various social groups. You have the kevs, the greebo's, the stoners, the bitches, the punks etc... and with each of them you get the nice little group called the "wannabe whatevers". We spend to much time analysing what we think we "should" be, not on what we actually want to do. ("OH THE IRONY!!" I hear you cry, well ... before you say anything I know :P ) I mean, fuck. How many of you wan't to be sat at a computer reading this right now? You're doing it out of boredom, right? I do it all the time, you can always tell when someones been home from school, cos they leave comments everywhere on all the sites. Think, think about what you really wish you were doing right now. Think as to what that would be, or who you would rather be with..... and go for it. NO WORrYING!! I am giving everyone who reads this the ability to veto any consequences. Remember if you don't think there are any consequences, then there aren't any. Reach out and do what you want to do for a change, forget everyone else and what they may think of you for doing it, forget about yourself and your image - do it.  A lot of you have probably clicked on the cross/lowered your opinon of me/backed away from the computer by now so this will mean nothing and I will be talking to myself.... "Hey Keith" " 'Sup man?" "Not muc.. You watch the liverpool game?" "Yer i did, weren't half bad, although they still haven't quite recovered from their injury problems. Until they get their full-strength squad back, I don't think they're gonna challenge the top 3" "Hm... true..."  "You know it, by the way do you have my cd's? I can't find them anywhere" "Best check with the other Keith, I only exist on tuesdays and wedsnesdays. You want saturday through monday Keith." "Righto, I'll check with him when I next imagine him"   Well, I had a huge rant at the beginning, so I thought I'd better counterract it by going very nearly insane... just to balance out the universe and make sure the Earth doesn't collapse in on itself or summat.   ....What to do, what to say...  I'm tired, I should really be doing my chmistry coursework, but I felt obliged to keep up my blog and keep you informed of the in's and out's of my life. Except, that's never what I talk about on here, not in the slightest in actual fact. Strange in a way... ah well that's me in a nutshell.    OOh... one thing before I go. You at the back! Don't think I can't hear you sigh... I have eyes in the back of my head.... (How comethey never see us swear at them then?) It is, yet again about people. Why do people who you make quite clear of your dislike to... still find it necessary to engage you in conversation? I mean, seriously... why bother? It just makes both of you annoyed and want to try and kill small animals with HUGE..... beards.   Before i go, a list of themale gentialia  Penis, wang, shlong, sausage, pencil, hose, one eyed monster, snake, trouser-snake, manhood, cock, dick, willy, wife's best friend, meat and two veg, crown jewels, manly material, pogo stick of pleasure, maypole... ok I got bored and am making my own ones up.  I bid thee adieu, it is 20 past ten. That was a way to rid myself of boredom and help put my oxygen-depreived brain to sleep.   G'night

						    The search for boots.... or 'my saturday of stress' ]  "You can get anything you want in Aylesbury... As long as your average size, have a lot of money and get into the store at 9am before they've run out of stock" - a fellow cynic  In Aylesbury, it has become increasingly difficult for a man of my stature to by attire. I needed to buy some rugby boots, so I of course went to the first logical place, JJB. I went straight for their selection of 4 different rugby boos .. at least this was what I thought. Turns out that they were all the same boot.. just a slightly different colour. Even so i felt obliged to try them on and ordered a pair of size 11 shoes. For those of you who have not had the pleasure of seeing my feet.... they are quite wide, wider than these ones anyway as i needed clown length shoes to actually fit my girth into them. (yes that was just a por excuse to get the word 'girth' into my blog, if you don't like it.. then go screw a goat... or even worse, a gecko. They can bite like mutha-fuckas)  I went next to jakemans, which was closed. Then to allsports where they were most ingenious in their ways of enticing customers. They display on their racks three diferent styles of rugby boot, all of which would have been wide enough for my mutant feet. Alas, this was a ploy to get people into the store as I soon realised after 10 minutes of waiting for them to find  any  of the rugby boots in the store produced nothing. Eventually the dude looking for them got the manager to look for me... before returning twenty minutes later to say 'Wed ont sem to have any rugby boots at all...' 'Then why do you display them here dickwad?' ... i didnt of course say that as my father was present and he ould have beaten me with a hoover nozzle when we returned home. Instead i just said 'No worries bruv' and left, shaking my head at them. In the end i went to Oxford, bought some football bootsa as i could not be arsed with looking for any more to fit me. The end. Groovy  Remember kiddies, your not arrogant.... everybody else is stupid *dies*. I have now (in english.. and every other lesson really =/) developed this aura of pessimism and cynicism. I am far less pessimistic than I used to be and am not, as foster said "Why bother going to the sea side..... the sea'll probably swallow me up anyway..." I have NEVER been this bad.. thats greg scott erritory *shudders*. As for the cynicism.... i fully admit to that, but i prefer the term 'realist'. I may look at humanity with a critical eye, but I see no reason why I shouldn't.   A cynic is defined as: A person who believes people's motives are usually bad or selfish. In that case, yes. I am indeed a cynic, cuff me officer. No it isn't a crime yet... but cuff me ayway ;)   *shudders*  THE POINT! Thee was one i was planning on getting to.... Ah yus, I am a cynic and we believe that a lot of people's actions are selfish or have other means than the proposed ones. *Stops before going on a rant about the government.* This does not mean however that we think  everyone  does this. We know that some people are thoroughly genuine and due to our many years experience, we can tend to notice these people more than other people. (rhis aint a golden rule though, we all have our bad days). Do not judge us, we do but walk among you... that mand in the peaked cap, that woman at the bus stop and yes.. even the young woman with the pram who eyes you suspiciously as you walk past. These could all be biting cynics.. beware.  On a final note, Y'know those glasses on a long handle posh women use at the opera and such? A cookie to the first person to give me their real name. Answers in shout out form or on the back of a stamped, addresed swallow. Pelicans will also be accepted.

						   What have I been up to I hear.... no one cry. Well I'm gonna tell ya anyway because I have nowt else to do. On Wednesday I went to "play" rugby sevens at Roslyn Park in Londium. This was the national tournament and over a few days has 837 games. We started the day by having all thirteen of us pile into the green minibus, for  those of you not aware of the green mionibus, it's propbably older than most of your houses. It has one bar in the roof that rattles... now when i say "rattle".. I mean vibrates back and forwards rapidly causing a very loud noise, similar to a jackhammer. Well, thats what it sounded like at 7a.m. anyway. This would happen everytime we stopped in traffic and the only way to remedy this was to hold the bar steady with your arm. Suffice to say, in M25 London traffic, there were some sore arms by the end of the journey.  The journey weren't too bad as I had stolen the seat that actually has leg room and so I didn't develop deep vein thrombosis or it's long distant cousin .. death (why not?). However we were quite a way into the jounrey when we realised our 13... was supposed to be a 14. "Where's Payne?" Came the question from the back of the bus. "Well he's right ... erm... shit. Sir, we forgot Payne." We phoned Payne with one of the phones and pulled over into the Layby, fifteen minutes (and much rattling from the bar) later, he arived and the journey continued.   The day drew on, much as days tend to do and it was not long before the first game... which I didnt play in, but fret not! I told myself, I would play in the second. And I did... not that I did much =/. We lost all of our three games and my contributions to the match I played in was to hand one person into the ground and offload the ball.... and being kicked in the face. It was an... eventful day to say the least... Oh, on a .. kind of related subject, I have now been playing rugby since year 9 for the school.. and over that period the only trys I have scored have been for house and in training. For the school, I have scored a grand total of... *Drumroll*...    No Trys, much to Fosters disgust. I have got colours for sport twice, but I've never scored *seethes*.... Ah well.   Anyway, that was a brief tale of my day of rugger (goes into old speak). It was a jolly spiffing time I must say, I almost felt like old Mortimer as he won on the 5 for 1 at Whitchester *dies*. We have just been told the topic of this years house writing is 'Survival', so thats gonna be fun. Now, how to write something about survival without incorporating guns...  Laters, I'm off to do the shiteload of work I now have amassed

						   Haven't updated in awhile due to several hundreds of thousands of technical difficulties.  First off - my dad installed a virus software to try and stop him recieving so many worm viruses. This in turn stopped me from using the internet randomly and if i could get it to work, it was slower than a dead man walking up Mt. Everest. Then, lo nd behold., my dads computer got a worm virus and had to be totally wiped. That took two days. When the computer returned - the network did not work so i had to curse and hit and stuff to try in vain to get it to. Finally, miraculously my father managed to realise that eh had installed to much firewall software in his paranoia and decided to let me have the internet back.  Stoke Mandeville. This was a place that I had often (foolishly) thought of as being just down the road from Aylesbury. If you to think of it like this... then i suggest that you try walking there. Five miles (give or take). I decided that I would walk to visit Rach at work and alleviate some of her tedium. I thehn, upon ariving in town realised that I had forgotten where this place was. I then realiwsed it was in Mandeville and set off to walk to the hospital. Upon arriving there i had but another 2 miles to walk as a nice passer -by informed me and i set off on a jog. All in all an hours worth of exercise, altho jogging on the whole is a sport I discourage to anyone thinking of taking it up.   (disjointed thought pattern you may think. 'Damn straight' says I)  http://www.penny-arcade.com/view.php3?date=2004-03-19&res=l ^ go here to learn the internet fuckwad theory. This is why we have to put up with complete and uter twats in our lives on the internet.   Yawn,. i have more to say, but it can wait  laters

						   One thing I did forget to add. At lunch yesterday I brought the fruit that is compulsory at my house *cough* bollocks *cough*. We were hungry, but when aren't we?  Anyhow I brought two (rather small) apples for me and my brother to eat. To which my brother said, "Well one's these big definately didn't hit Einstein in the head..."  A few minutes.. and some choice words later my brother realised the error of his ways.   I think it's fitting to now quote Einstein, "There are only two infiite things in this world. The universe and human stupidity, but I'm not sure about the former." It may be a little off, but it's the best I can do off the top of my head.   Laters (see below for real post)

						    I'm not one to refuse a pretty lady...    So when Ollie asks me to blog, blog I must do.   *dies*  So what have I been up to ya big ol cockney barrel of monkeys. The answer: Revision  The ones among you that know me the most wil most likely have burned your tounge on your take-out food or fallen off your chair when reading that. Actually, you'll probably be out having a social life in your holidays and not sat inside your house reading this tepid drivel.  ...Anyhoo, my life this week has consisted of eating, sleeping and socialising. Well, I went out on wednesday and spent the majority of my life two places that I spend most of my time in. For those of you not with cryptic battery packs added to your brain (God missed them out on some of the later models, apparently they make you explode...pfft what does he know) I've been at mine or rachael's. It's been a good week, especially the getting up late parts... that is something I enjoy a lot :-D.   As for revision, yes I'm back on the point. (Aren't tangents great?) Revision is especially hard for men to do. We do not have the capacity to stare at books for over a five minute period, whereas women can. This I know is a crass generalisation for many of the female of the species cannot revise either, and to the i say.. Kudos! We should not be revising, we should be out doing crazy drugs, having crazy sex and enjoying the sunshine. That is .. if there were any sunshine.  "April showers" my family call it. "God laughing at us" is a more fair description. He is a twisted individual isn't he? I can actually imagine the scenario in heaven:  St. Peter: Aaaah summer's here again God, finally the people of Britain can leave their houses.  St. Paul: Yes, especially after that dreadful rain they've been getting.  St. Peter: They must love the break, not having to wear three layers of worrying about getting wet.  God: *Evil glint enters eye* Heh..heh.heh..  St. Peter: Erm... Sir?  God: *Kicks black clouds* Fly my pretties, fly...   Or something. Oh and in reference to the black clouds, they are not being kicked because they are balck but because they have rain contained within them. It was no a racial slur in any way, shape or form. Bloody political correctness.  On another note, I bought 'magic and medicine' by the Coral, it's brilliant. Yes. No critique here, just telling you to buy it now, or wait until woolies have one of those copies with no cover or book like I did. On the vein of music, I have 2.50 left in my bank account (it is related, honest!) with which to buy an acoustic guitar to replace my now infamous crappy one that I leant to the kids on D of E. Heh, suckers. The cheapest acoustic (although quite a nice one) is 79.99pounds. Hence my dilemma. I could buy a crappy one from argos for twenty quid... but I don't even have that :-S. Ah well.. c'est la vie.  I return to my computer five minutes later, forgetting that I had been writing a blog. The mind works in mysterious ways, doesn't it? Where was I now... nope lost it. Ah well, Just watched finding nemo again. Quite possible one of the best animated fish films of all time, second only to Sharky and George, I know it wasn't a film.. but it doesn't matter.  Anyhoo, enjoy your Easter with all your eggs while I have my .. two at most to look forward to. Don't get fat now, it'll only cause havoc with your health later in life.  The on the call Davi- ..erm Keith. Yes, Keith.

      I'm tired... Physically and mentally.  Today I have done the following:  Tidied out my brothers parking space at his flat. This involved -Raking four bin bags worth of leaves and putting them into said bags -Picking out the trash (crisp packets, carrier bags) from the place and binning them -Picking weeds and bramble out of the newly fond soil with my hands (I say newly found soil... because nobody knew it was there. It was buried deep underneath a pile of crap a foot dep. Consequently the pile of crap I had to move.)  Then came the bush trimming. My brothers wheely bin had become encovered by a bramble bush with centimetre to inch long thrns all over it. I had to -Chop the bush back a few feet.. scratchin myself a plenty -Pick up the bits of bush and place them into bags -Repeat until parents satisfied -Count number of limbs remaining Luckily the other bush that was in the way off the door had no thorns, so was trimmed easier  Next job. Painting. Two walls in the room had been donw.. leaving two walls with the window and several plug sockets and fernickety edges to paint around. This led to much annoyance as I was using the roller. This took an hour and a half to paint fully with my brother neatening the edges that i couldn't have managed with the shitty 'cotton wool on a swirly stick' i had been given.  That was an end to the physical part of my day except for the loading, next came the mental part. I had to draw a plan and measure my brothers room, as well as travelling home and measuring all of his furniture. Now i had to piece the two together, bearing in mind all radiators/plugs/light switches.  This sounds easy, but it is not. My brother neglected to tel me that his stuff would only fit in with a nanometer of space left to breathe. This led to me drawing sums and doing advanced sums in my head... and cocking them up. I mean seriously, who can do pythagoras thereom of three digit numbers in their head?  This led to me phoning people for use of their calculator, thankyou especially to ben and emma for whom 'two minutes' ... means never. Eventually due to help from raquel i had my sums... and found out I didn't have enough room.  Fuck.  Thre plans later and I've fitted everything in the room.. but the double bed has to have one of it's sides up against the wall.... ah well they can live with it.  Oh, apparently I was supposed to ring emma back... ah well shite happens  Im continuing in my mentally tired state by playing emotional table tennis with half of the population of southern england. That and it's ten and I really need to sleep (yes i'm needing earlier and earlier nights) Yawn  laters

      So my blog died completely by deleting half of it's own template =/   These things appear to self destruct after a while.. be careful zoe - Your probably next..... now all I have to do is find the counter and deelys that I  so  need.   On another note, I hate DT... more precisely I hate the fact I have all my work in for Monday. *dies*  anyhoo, of to sacrifice some chickens to the sun god and hope that he'll stop fucking with everyone.  Buh bye

      Dust annoys me greatly.  I have been packing away and tidying various things (my room has a distinct lack of items inside of it at the moment) and I have been sneezing more than an elephant with a feather stuck in his trunk (why not?). This has led to my hayfever/cold/dust combination of dead nose-itis. Also, i am slowyl but surely destroying all of my fingers one by one. I burnt one on the science day on saturday, which by the way was a lot easier than I thought. I spent the whole day playing with variuos compounds and making coloured and sparkly fireworks.   Gotta love playing with fire.  The other I cut while chopping an onion for a barbie at the flat. It's a cool flat with a kick-ass sofa and chairs, and also every games system we own in it, including my beloved ps2 which no longer resides at my home. This finger is the index, making barre chords annoying.  The third and forth were hurt during an epic basketball struggle undertaken by myself, Nustedt, Greenie, Greg, charles and Angus.. Shyam sat out. However, we weren't making him in a racist "Get away from us Darkie" kinda way; he and Charles merely sat out for most of it, 'til the ootie started. We ended up playing against half the school team in year 13 apparently, bt we only lost by about 6 points so go us.   It's been an active week, much to my disgust as I was planning on having a restful start to study leave, but it's so damn hot I just wanna go outside and run around, swim and play basketball.... Yes stragen, but hey I'm gonna enjoy study leave :D.  Study Leave rocks.  So does Dave Chapelle - Listen/watch him... yes

      Blogger has changed.... for the better! Templates galore and its own commenting system, woot!  I had a blast from the past today as I was sorting through stuff from my old school. Little has changed  Year 6 maths: "Unfortunately, Keith rarely extends himself and will perform a task with the mionimum amount of effort. He therefore rarely achieves the level of which he is capable in either classwork or homework"  Year 5 english: "Keith does not always perform to his full ability and sometimes gives careless. untidy wok." "Keith is developing a good cursive style of handwriting..." What went so wrong?  I also found scripts and stuff from when I was fagin (fag end as I was so wittily dubbed)in Oliver Twist. So yeah, been a fun time. I have two weeks roguhly 'til I say goodbye to my house and move to a flat in Broughton.   I've recently become re-addicted to www.writingforums.com... that doesn;t mean I'm actually writing anything though. Well, there is my house writing piece, but that has drawn to a stand-still.   Another surprising thing, I volunteered for this scincey day for young-uns, to help out in the physics department. Alas i shall have to wear my uniform another day as i do not own a white lab coat. Although, if I did it would be used for kinky sexual activities and not to stop spillages. Or is that the same thing?  *gives brief pause for people to regain sanity and open their scrunched up eyes as they say 'EW!'*  That was al Goodnight

      Long time.... nothing  My internet has been down and to be frank, I'm lucky to be on here right now. On similar news, I hate my network. I hope to burn it then feed its molten plastic remains to Satan himself so he can taste his own carnage.  So yes  I have to finish writing my french oral, only under a week to go kiddos! I also need to learn it, answer the questions and maybe make an attempt at learning some conversation topics.. but nah.   I fear I am becoming more insane.. I also fear that the sentence: 'All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy' is much underused in the common climate.   On other, more musical news I have recently acquired a new musical instrument that I can add to my room of instruments that I hope to have when I'm older. (For those few I haven't told, my ambition in life is to have a room of every musical instrument possible and learn to play them to at least a mediocre standard.) The new instrument I have is..... an accordian, known to some as a squeezebox. Random yes, it cost five quid and my rents bought it at an auction... they were originally bidding for a guitar for me btu it went for too much. Obviously an accordian is the next guess =/   On other music related news - Santana rock, as does the new Beastie Boys single. It's great go out and get it... NOW! I have not shyed away in my love for the beasties, they're great as many people will back me in saying.... now if only the were black like us.  I'm enjoying the new D12 album, especially a track that surprised me called 'The good die young' where the group pay homage to all of the people they know that have died over the years and about how they miss them etc. It surprised me that they've got emotioal.. well emotions, but it was a welcome surprise so you know that all those big boy rappers aren't always popping pills and raping each others mothers.   I now move onto ..rage. Rage directed at emals like this: (I've higlighted the bits i love in bold)  "if you think this is a laugh you are actually wrong!     if you do not send this email on to 15 people tonight you will have an old lady appear beside you while you are sleeping  and you when you  awake and open your eyes she will stare at you for a long long time and if you look away she will crawl onto you and start eating your body very very slowly and you will die a very painfull death and the quicker you look away the more pain you will be!      if you think it is a joke think again if you think you are so good and will delete this email believe me i warned you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! "  Where to start, except for the lack of commas, full stops and the fact that the word in s missed off the end... However it isn't the bad spelling and gramar that annoys me the most. It's the fact that someone is at home beating off* over the fact they have made a shitty email circle the globe.   *may just be laughing or smug.   So, join me in my vision of no more of these type of emails. Next time you are sent one of these, reply to it and tell them how annoyed you get when you recieve twenty seven of them a day. The worst one is the hotmail one, when you think about them logically... they're just bullshit.   Anyhoo... only a week left lads... I apolagise in advance for my behaviour over the course of the next week. I may become more insulting and I may break down your character into pieces then place them in blenders. Most likely nothing will happen and you'll all be safe from my wrath for a while.  On another note, I got meh gold certificate today. Apparently that makes me in the top 6% of the 2700 odd schools that entered =/.... but I don't believe that.

       The tale of the bed   There are some manky things in any new house, so we have been stripping these out one by one... but nothing prepared me for one item of furniture. (Warning, may be distrubing for younger readers.. that means you *points*)  This bed was, to be frank, stained an off brown colour - that was just the mattress. After we took this off and threw it in the 'room of miscillaneous crap to be thrown out' (a lengthy name, but fitting) we discovered the bed.  This bed was... a greeny yellow colour. Now this would have had to have soaked  through  the mattress and then stain the bed. The bed was crap anyway, but this was a bit drastic. After taking the head board off, which had been broken at some stage and was nailed back on with another piece of wood, we discovered a vodka bottle - a clue as to why this had happened. Lots of pushing and groaning and the bed was downstairs int he trailer, ready to go to the tip. This process was followed by many washings of my hands.   I went to my new college today and, to my suprise was greeted on something like the level of a human being. Now this may be shocking to you AGSers, but the people here a quite friendly. You call the teachers by their first names, get 8 free periods a week and wear whatever you feel like.  I shook hands with mike, I don't know what job he does exactly but he did my 'chat'. I go in for 6 subjects on wednesday and get lost because i took directions from two 'bigger boys' who didn't like my accent. ...or something.  (on another note, over half my emails now i had were spam)  I met my physics teacher (possibly) and had a talk with him about science and rugby/basketball. Friendly people. It looks to be an allright place.    I have a new favourite shop - Cash Converters. It rocks, they have more amps than god and they're huuuge. That and loads of guitars, dvd players, cd's, games and hi-fis etc. It's porbably where i'll get my new guitar from, from my new job. This is all theoretical 'cos i haven't applied or got it yet. But that's tomorrows job. It's 20 hours a week, five days a week for five quid an hour. Hundred pound a week baby :-D.  Anyhoo.. gotta go. Buh bye

      It's that time of the month again.  No i dont' plan on doing a sick, sick innuendo about the womanly cycle. I merely mean to bring up the topic of one thing.     Periods.    Only joshing, it's those questionnaire thingies people keep sending. I rarely get a chance to open my email account, and when I do i find myself with roughly 40 odd emails. A quarter of which are usually questionnaires, and the other concern 'The beth chaz wars' or as i like to label these emails... "Bullshit I don.t care about." Then there are the obligatory 'expanding girth' emails we all hate.  I write this in sunny Scarborough (and no I'm not on the beach). I am in fact typing on my dad's computer while the France game plays softly in the background. It's not much, in actual fact it's a freebie aol thing again.  Stupid fools.  Anyhoooooo, I am a little tired, i'll try and steal this again soon so i can type up random incessant babble.   Oh yeah, THREE - NIL.. THREE - NIL! Oh that's right, most people don't watch footbal that read this, ah well.   Laters

      It has been a long time   A really long time. I write this on my brothers computer at the flat of dreams and mystery. The internet is free AOL and is 56k, go me!   What has happened. Well I'm settled in here now, I've got my computer up, ps2 up and my cd's and dvd's are being taken out of their packing when needed. I have a few clothes and some comfy arse chairs to watch tv on. Only thre weeks more of living here to go, before move number two.  I can't play music very loud as it disturbs the neighbours as we found out 7.3o one morning when the guy above us turned his music on full blast. He'd forgotten there was no-one beneath and later gave us a bottle of Jasons Creek to apolagise. Nice bloke.   I have a new acoustic, to make up for the fact my electric guitar and amp are in boxes. It's a crafter d6, and it is sweet. Although Ben just told me i could have it 30quid cheaper of the internet, but hey ya can't win em all.   I live near a large pond/small lake which is cool to walk the dog and chill, but I have been finding study leave boring, with my mobile phone's ever decreasing credit being pretty much my only form of communication. On a plus side there's always the english exam tomorrow to look forward to.....  The football on Sunday, hopefully will be in the afternoon so Ill be back home from a car boot sale. I'm gettting rid of all my crap, it takese up two cars and a trailer roughly. Also I'll get to see my dad again who i Haven't since my Cousins 21st last friday. That means I have to give up my double bed (which fucking rocks!!!) for the sofa. C'est la vie.  56k sucks. It is one thing I'm missing along with cable, money and social activities. My cousins twenty first was fun though. It's always good to see your relatives get drunk and your annoying aunt fall over when trying to get into the house. (My mum literally couldn't walk, it was priceless.. if annoying). Then my bro and is gf went to their room and me and my cousin watched tenacious d live until 3 in the morning. It was a good evening. My cousin rocks, if i could have a trade-off for bro.. no contest. Am I joking? You decide.  Where shall i travel in my brain next. Oh yes the 'everyone vs wardi' thing on bens blog, I don't care if it's a closed aregument.. Ward's wrong.  ...What? .. What are you doing here..?  Put it down.. no.. * click * No, no...NOOOO!!!  * BANG *    ... * thud *   Anyhoo..   How do the exams go for everyone? I seem to be unworried, despite having done diddley-squat revision. (yes it is a word. I blame my lack of concentration on my appauling hayfever which has come upon me tenfold like the seventh plague of hell... or something. My eyes burn, my nose streams or doesn't work at all and i can't get to sleep in the heat.  God bless england, the sooner I'm living by a beach the better. (Sea air and water cleans my hayfever right up, it also cures virtually every illness i've ever suffered. My asthma used to lessen and Ecsma/exma/exsma or however you spell it would disappear.)  '....I'm just a poor boy nobody loves me...  HE'S JUST A POOR BOY FROM A POOR FAMILY, SPARE HIM HIS LIFE FROM THIS MONSTROSITY'  I'm reduced to listening to the 'air guitar' compilations.. sigh  Until next time folks

       Hello Southerners    &nbsp;  *dies*    &nbsp;  There is a language barrier between the north and south (no, i'm not bothering with my usual blathering introduction to my insane rantings.. instead i'd have a nice long pair of brackets like this you see here... Fetching isn't it, i was afraid it'd make the page look fat...)     &nbsp;   &nbsp;  *dies*    &nbsp;  So anyway, language. For example, how many of you have heard the word 'ace' used in a conversation like the following:    &nbsp;  "My old english teacher is on the bloody beach"   "I remember him, he was ace."    &nbsp;  Or     &nbsp;  "Mmmm.. bacon."   "Love it with a bit of brown sauce, really ace that is."    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Weirdo's.. plus the word grand is used to describe things oter than a thousand quid.    &nbsp;  Whatever. "What," i hear you cry, "has become of myself?"    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  ....    &nbsp;  *silence*    &nbsp;  ..    &nbsp;  Well i don't care, even though it is insanely boring. I've painted, built beds, stripped wallpaper, glossed skirting boards, filled holes, sanded wood and filler. Ripped up carpet, put carpet down, lifted and shifted washing machines, beds, mattresses, tumble drier, fridges, tables and many, many other things. Been to the laundrette twice, baught a new cooker, been down the pub a few times, went to the beach and played footy. As well as playing final fantasy X..    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  In other words, I'm bored off my tits.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  On the plus side i went to 'ROCK ON THE BEACH 2004' *cue echo effect*   the music was alright, with Reactor and Thunder being the two best bands. Imagine the darkness, but with a different lead singer who actually sings as opposed to warbles weirdly. (i don't hate the darkness before i get anyone bitching.) Then make the music a little less main stream (ie. get rid of the singles) and you've got thunder. Or something pretty damn close.     &nbsp;  Anyhoo, have to go now. Buh bye.
