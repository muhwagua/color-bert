      Rachel and I just got back from a most entertaining trip to Yosemite. Thankfully, we brought Chris along to ensure that we didn't end up as bear-dinner. This was our first trip to the Sierras and with me being allergic to the outdoors in general, I wasn't quite expecting to enjoy it as much as I did.   Took a couple of hundred pictures, at least. At least fifty were of Yosemite Falls alone, since it seemed to follow us all through our treks and raft-rides. Bad Yosemite Falls!  Hiked to Vernal Falls on Sunday morning; turns out sneakers don't make very good footwear when travelling downhill. Bad sneakers!  Tried rafting on an exceptionally calm and shallow Merced River (stream?). Raft hit the river bottom a couple of times, and Chris, being the only one with removable footwear, had to play tow-truck. Bad Merced River!   And, ah yes ! We had to hike back all the way to the raft rental place as those bastards wouldn't send out enough shuttle buses to ferry us back to the starting point. Chris had to walk barefoot, and developed some pretty blisters on his feet. Bad rafting company !  At the end of it all, we got smashed at bar in the Miner's Lodge where we were staying, and sang silly songs that should never ever be performed on stage. We were planning to make a quick stop at Glacier Point the next morning, but were too groggy to do so the next day. Bad hangover !  Ah well. Gives me an excuse to go back again. All in all, a good trip !

      So the fire alarm in our apartment building goes off last night. Now if the little alarm thingy on your ceiling is the only fire alarm you've ever heard, multiply it by a factor of, oh I don't know, a thousand maybe, to get a feel for how annoying the one from last night was.  We had to box up the cats "to-go" style; cats don't seem to enjoy that. Who wouldave thought! And, of course, there was the wonderful half an hour of awkward smiles that we spent with neighbors we'd been trying to avoid for the last year.  Turns out the whole affair was a bloody false alarm. I'm gonna buy me some ear plugs and sleep through it all the next time.

      the  urlLink Mojo Lounge  in Fremont where we watched  urlLink The Hammer Smith Band  play the blues.  Now, I had watched Chris "Hammer" Smith perform a couple of harp numbers at  urlLink David Barrett's  harmonica workshop concert a few months ago and he blew my socks off back then with a high energy performance.  Tonight, I walk into the bar, to find him wearing a harmonica  urlLink neck brace , guitar in hand, singing lead vocals. So the guy is a good singer, a good guitarist and an exceptional harmonica player! And he can do it all at once! Well mostly... :)  Not only that, he switched between multiple harmonicas and the guitar during the same song numerous times! During solos, he'd have 2 harps in hand ! And at one point, he replaced a busted harp reed in 1 minute flat after it broke down during a song (I think that's what happened anyway..).  The best part was when the entire band (bass player and drummer) joined us at our table during a break for a chat (Guess they felt obliged since we were the only people cheering through every song like idiots..). He muttered about how hard it was to find decent gigs at clubs, even after all these years. I did ask him if he'd taken lessons anytime, and he said he had, for voice and harp, ages ago. Well, it shows!  What do I learn from this? I need to figure out how to sing. And play the guitar. Think about it!. I could have call and response going between my own frigging guitar and harp!  Aaaargh. So much to do. So little time ...and energy ...and talent.   :-\

I jammed with them for about 12 songs, and, strangely enough, they didn't seem to mind. I think I did ok with the simple fills. But ran out of steam on the solos after, like, song 2.  I'm just happy they think I'm good enough to do more jams. We'll see where this goes. Time to practice.

      * Do not waste an hour wondering why line-in audio will only play through your PC's left speaker. The problem, most likely, is that your right speaker is unplugged.  Blame a cat. Any cat. I picked Stubbys.  * Upon discovering that your precious digitized audio clips are noisy beyond recognition, do not waste other people's time inquiring about sampling rates. The problem, most likely, is that you haven't set your recording device to line-in, but have left it set to microphone instead. The "noise", therefore, is a result of your microphone picking up every squeak and whisper made in the room, in addition to recording what is being played through your PC's speakers. Yes, that is exactly why your cat's howls are now part of your digitized audio.   Blame a cat. Any cat. I picked Stubbys.  * As a general rule, do not tinker with audio at 3 in the morning. Not around cats in any case. Bad things happen. Heck, don't even stay up until 3. Try catching some sleep sometime. I hear it works out quite well for the rest of the world. Then again, I shouldn't be listening to the voices in my head.

      So apparently its impossible to get anything practical shipped to any other country anymore (ok maybe except Switzerland).  I had, a few months ago, been unsuccessful in shipping a few cans of Altoids to India. (Why Altoids? Coz my momma digs the citrus flavored ones. That's why!). Mailed the package out, and it came right back with "REJECTED", or something of that nature stamped across the box.  Today I try and send out a box of CDs to my cousins, and JEEZ do I have to jump through hoops of fire. First I have to make sure that every bloody CD I shipped was manufactured in the US (What? They still make things in the US anymore?). Then I had to list em all on paper; names and estimated values. An hour later, I was informed that it was not possible to sent packages to overseas P.O.Boxes via DHL and so I'd have to ship via the "standard" route that would cost me a penny less. Yay.   :-/  I hate customs and duties and tarriffs and the like.

      .. at  urlLink PlanetGranite  in Santa Clara.  Well actually tried both hands and feet. And my nose. And knees.   And did ok.  I started on a level 7 wall, moved on to 8, and struggled very hard on a level 9 before calling it quits. All this under the expert supervision of my colleague El and one of her rock-climbing buddies, Antonio. Always nice to have good teachers when starting out on something new....  I'm very sore right now. Arms feel like someone's holding them down. Can't clench fingers and form a fist anymore. Considering that I will be learning how to ride a motorcycle at 7 in the morning tomorrow, I'm not sure if this was such a good decision.  But at least I had a great time. I have to go back and finish off the annoying level 9 wall sometime. But belay lessons first!  Ow. Hands hurt. Enough typing. Bed time.

Or,  try every flavor of potato chip served at the technical sessions.   Or,  play Java-driven first person shooter demo until I go down, valiantly, to sniper fire.

      .. for the last two days. So here's a quick roundup:    Friday     Group lunch At  urlLink Maggiano's Little Italy . Yum.   Wrapped up another band gig at work. The crowd was smaller than usual. But I think the few people that stuck around until the end ( thanks Chris! ) had a good time. So did I. Noticed that I tend to close my eyes or stare into the sky when performing in front of crowds. Ah well. Better than imagining them in their underwear...   Watched  urlLink Mitch Hedberg  at the  urlLink Improv , and was let down. Too much new material that didn't always work. Plus the crowd was a bit slow to appreciate the stuff that did work. I wouldave been happy to just watch him do his Comedy Central special all over again.   Rushed to the  urlLink Quarternote  to play at my first non-work gig with the  Red White And Blues  (which I'm apparently part of, now). We did 9 songs. Or was it 10? Doesn't matter. I didn't really know half of them anyway. And the crowd of 5 odd people didn't care. I've concluded that people have very low expectations of harmonica players. I can dish out pretty much the same crap over and over and over and over again, and everyone's happy. Good for me. Need more practice. And a louder amp.       Saturday     Played tennis with Apu in the afternoon. He's getting very good. And that serve keeps getting deadlier. I had one of  urlLink these  wrapped around my arm, and it worked!! I lasted a good hour on the court! Good bye tennis elbow !    After a late late lunch at Inn-N-Out (yum), Rachel and I headed out to the  urlLink Mojo Lounge  for their 1 year anniversary celebration. 5 hours of non-stop FREE blues!  urlLink R.J.Mischo  and  urlLink Gary Smith  are freaking awesome on the harp. And they both sing pretty damn well. More reason to take vocal lessons. Oh, and this time around, I remembered to clear my tab before I left.

The Prowler sounded great when I tested it out at  urlLink Dave Barrett's  earlier today. Good tone. Great volume. Good condition. So I bought it.   Peavey doesn't manufacture this model anymore but I did manage to find a  urlLink PDF manual  on their site. That's gonna be weekend reading material.  I dragged the amp over to practice with the Red, White & Blues later in the evening, and for the first time ever, I could actually hear myself! And all it was cranked up to was 3! I can't wait to  urlLink crank this baby all the way up to 11 ..!

      .. to " multi-function " and " all-in-one " products, and purchased a  urlLink HP PSC 2175  printer/copier/scanner at Fry's.    Now, I did not intend to purchase a  combo  product when I stepped into the store. I was, instead, planning on acquiring a regular inkjet printer, the  urlLink Canon i560 . Scanners were to be evaluated, not bought. However, one-phone-call-to-Apu later, I found myself busy testing a line of multi-function printers (He insisted that they are a safe buy, especially the HP variety; and provided happy customer testimonials).  The evaluation process was simple; Rachel had brought along with her a test sheet of paper on which she had scribbled a few color pencil sketches (the point of the scanner is so we can digitize the little cartoons she produces on occasion). Since none of the printers were hooked up to an actual PC, we simply used the copier function to produce color copies of the test sketch, and thus test the scanner at the same time.   Canon machines produced crap, strangely enough, and were out of contention immediately. The HP 2175 did a reasonable job reproducing the sketch. The  urlLink Epson Stylus CX5400  generated a very crisp copy. Rachel figured that the printers could be tweaked to print finer copies, and so we redid the settings on all printers. And this time, the HP printer performed the best. A quick check on cartridge prices, and the winner was clear.  I'm still wondering about how long before one of the  functions  in this multi-function wonder breaks down, bringing down the rest of it with it. We'll wait and see.  First, I need to get a frigging USB connection cable. These b*stards at HP left it out of the package for some mysterious reason (is listed as an  optional accessory , which it most certainly is NOT). Makes me wonder why they even bothered to provide cartridges.

      ..   tennis shoulder  .  For those of you not familiar with tennis shoulder, its a condition where your shoulder pretends to be an elbow, and hurts like one.   Sigh. I'm turning into a poster child for tennis-related ailments. Some known. Some unheard of.    Speaking of tennis, I retract my previous rant about today's tennis being overwhelmed by the all-power, no-elegance types. Early this morning, I watched the Swiss champ  urlLink Roger Federer  demolish a venomous  urlLink Andy Roddick  during the Men's finals at Wimbledon.   Federer does not possess a 140mph serve. He does not grunt when playing his shots. And does not have a double handed backhand. His is a game of precision, elegance and gorgeous single handed backhand top spin shots. He executes clean strokes with the least amount of effort required, and using the sharpest angles possible. During the finals, his minimalist approach went too far at times; at one point he squandered away a decisive game by trying to flick the ball onto an open court when the easiest of strokes would have sufficed. But such glitches aside, it was the best display of all-round tennis mastery since  urlLink Sampras  left the scene.  Apu tells me Federer was even better during last year's finals (which he also won). Too bad I missed it.

I buy coffee at Starbucks before stopping by the movies every weekend. The Century theatres at Oakridge Mall are cash-only, which usually means I use another bank's ATM to withdraw money.

      Rachel and I successfully completed the  urlLink MSF Basic RiderCourse  today.  :-)))   urlLink    As it turns out riding a bike wasn't as hard as I had originally thought. Turning, braking, swerving were all manageable at decent speeds. The problem was getting my speed up into the double digits. Being new to the world of clutches and gear-shifting, I had a rough time making the basic transition from 1st to 2nd gear. I found myself half-shifting into neutral everytime. And neutral is a bad bad place to be when trying to throttle up. Of course, I was NEVER able to find neutral when I wanted to. I wonder which genius decided to stick neutral between two other gears? DAMN YOU NEUTRAL!!  As for bikes, both of us rode Honda Nighthawks.   I tried out a Yamaha Virago at the end of Saturday's class, thanks to a minor mishap involving Rachel and her Honda. I found the Virago's crusier-style handle bars very comfortable.   However, I had a hard time generating any speed on it, thanks to my friend, the neutral gear, and so I chose to dump it for the Nighthawk during today's session.  The final session ended with an evaluation test, which involved performing tight U-turns in the form of a figure 8, a swerve, an emergency stop and an accelerated 90+ degree turn. Everyone did ok, and Rachel outscored me! Damn you woman!  Anyway, I'm feeling happy and cheerful now. We still need to take the DMV's multiple choice test before we get real licences. But I'll worry about that in a few days. Right now, I think I'm going to browse through bike listings...    PS: It turns out that the morning sessions can start upto a good 7-8 minutes before the scheduled start time! Happened on both days. Today's session started at around 7:06, going by my watch (scheduled start time being 7:15). So we weren't late last week after all!

      Its official.  I pick a Blues CD. And play is over and over and over and over again until it begs for me to stop. I'm done with  urlLink Sonny Boy Williamson's: His Best  and  urlLink Paul Butterfield Blues Band . Now I'm stuck listening to Little Walters'  urlLink His Best  collection, which I seem to be enjoying the most.  I'm hoping to steal a bunch of harmonica solos from Walters' songs, and I'm starting to find that I like his no-frills, yet extremely soulful singing just as much as his brilliant harp-playing. So he's the guy to emulate now. I'm working on  Can't Hold Out Much Longer ,  Mean Old World  and  Last Night . And  Blues With a Feeling , of course. Walters' version of this song pounds the hell out of the Paul Butterfield version. Which is saying a lot, because the Butterfield version is pretty damn good!  So much to learn. So little time.

A Nagpur court has sentenced a 24-year-old youth from Parseoni, Maharashtra to seven years Rigorous Imprisonment (RI) for 'ditching' a girl.   According to Nagpur rural police, Vilas Namdeo Uke had promised to marry a girl in 2001. Their relationship had led to her pregnancy.   The judge also slapped a fine of Rs 1,000 and, in case he fails to pay the penalty, Vilas would undergo further imprisonment of three months.      Apparently, in an unrelated sentencing, he received an additional 9 months for failure to pray in the mornings, 6 months for thinking dirty thoughts, and 200 hours of community service for failure to wash his hands after using the toilet.

Douse the almonds in chocolate, and I think can bring it down to 4, maybe even 3 minutes. Which is what nearly happened today, except that, in the presence of other people, my sense of guilt and shame kicked in a bit earlier than usual, causing me to stop after I had chomped down about two dozen pieces.

        urlLink CNN.com - Flicking -- not�swatting -- mosquitoes might prevent infection - Jul 19, 2004    Comeon! Who flicks a mosquito ?! Really ! I've been swatting 'em critters all my life, and I'm doing just fine.     Despite the Pennsylvania woman's case, Roger Nasci, a mosquito expert at a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention facility in Fort Collins, Colo., said there is no scientific basis for switching to flicking. He also pointed out that flicking the bugs off is not a permanent solution. "Unfortunately, then the mosquito often goes on to bite another person, or bites you again," Nasci said.    DUH!

        Before Coke and Pepsi muscled their way into India,  urlLink Thums Up , with its  Taste the Thunder  slogan, ruled the streets. Now bottled by the Coca Cola company, it still remains my favorite cola to this day. Last year, I was delighted to discover that it was available in Indian stores across the US, sold in the same, questionable-looking, recycled glass bottles that I have grown to love over the years.   I must point out that Thums Up, unfortunately, has enjoyed very little success with my non-Indian friends, with reactions ranging from " umm ... interesting " to ..  "..it has this, rancid, cola-that's-been-sitting-in-a-damp-room-for-a-while taste ". Too bad. They'll never enjoy the pleasures of a hot samosa and a chilled Thums Up ...  A few days ago, as I finished off another bottle of this fine cola at an Indian restaurant, I noticed that it was one of those rare bottles that carried a  Nutritional Information  sticker on it. (Nutritional information is non-existent on Indian food labels, or at least was a few years ago...). " 375 calories " it said. "Wow", I thought to myself, "I clearly remember seeing a similar sticker on a Thums Up bottle not too long ago, but one which claimed that it only contained 50-odd calories, and I KNOW that there ain't no such thing as a Diet Thums Up...".  So when I stopped by a  New India Bazaar  the next day, I made sure I picked up a bottle with a nutritional info sticker on it. And sure enough, " 57 calories " it proclaimed !!  Here are the conflicting labels. I have no idea what to make of them. A 318 calorie difference is quite puzzling..   urlLink    urlLink    If I have to justify consuming a couple of these every day, I think I'll be forced to go with the 57-calorie figure.   * shrug * .. * gulp * ... * ahhhh ...* ..

      I'm watching  urlLink  A Mighty Wind   as I type. and I think this one deserves to be on my favorites list. Its another Christopher Guest masterpiece, and, IMHO, superior to  urlLink This Is Spinal Tap . Superb  urlLink soundtrack . And absolutely hilarious dialog...    To do then now would be retro. To do then then was very now-tro, if you will.

      An India-Pakistan Cricket game took place yesterday, and not only did I refrain from purchasing some outrageously priced video or audio stream online, but I also went to bed early, refusing to stay up all night refreshing the score sheet. I checked the final scores only late in the morning, when the match was done. India was thoroughly humiliated, so its even better that I didn't bother. I think I shall celebrate my overcoming my Cricket addiction with some more mango ice-cream.

      So I had to wake up early. Very early. Like 5-am-early. To drop Rachel off at the airport. She will be in Oklahoma all week, and I have to figure out how to survive alone for the next few days. I'm hoping the cats know how to call for help, should it be necessary.  Tried out a new bagel shop,  Main St. Bagels , that has started operating right outside my apartment complex. Well, more like, was  forced  to go find some breakfast, since the kind folks at the apartment complex front office decided to play a game of  Lets-pretend-you-don't-exist  by sticking an "Away" sign at the office entrance and refusing to let anyone in, although I could very clearly see human activity on the inside. I did get in, eventually, and finally got my hands on a precious Fedex package containing Clapton concert tickets for later in the evening.  During the afternoon, Chris and I hiked along one of the trails at   urlLink Almaden Quicksilver County Park  . Although it was, perhaps, the hottest time of the day, I was quite refreshed at the end of it all and, strangely enough, was not sweating profusely. There were a few good views of San Jose along the way, and also a couple of encounters with the local wildlife (think snake and rabbit). Too bad Rachel took the camera with her. *sulk*. After the hike, we treated ourselves to some spicy Mussaman beef curry at little Thai place (whose name escapes me right now), and picked up some Mango Mochi (which I am enjoying right now..) at  urlLink  Trader Joe's  .  Attended an Eric Clapton concert at night with Apu and his roommate. >  What a fantastic show! Clapton played some of the meanest blues I've heard in ages; and what a great support cast he has! Their soulful, hear-wrenching rendition of  Have You Ever Loved a Woman  contained the best individual solos of the entire concert, although Clapton's insane guitar solo during  I Shot The Sheriff  wasn't one bit less enjoyable. Clapton switched gears in the middle of the show to play some crisp acoustic blues, mostly from his new album,  urlLink  Me and Mr. Johnson  . All numbers performed to perfection, as expected.  All in all, thoroughly satisfying, and worth every dime spent on the tickets. :)  Good day so far ...

      The   Red White and Blues   got together for a short gig at  urlLink  B-Street Billards   in downtown San Mateo on Friday.  urlLink   Disaster struck a couple of hours before the gig, when I busted my D harp during practice. Fortunately, the nice folks at  urlLink  Guitar Showcase   had plenty in stock.   B-Street Billards turned out to be a nice little pool hall with a bar, high ceilings and a decent crowd that seemed to care for the blues. We were opening for another band,  urlLink  Casual Soul  , whose lead guitarist joined us for our 7 song set. It was good to see familiar faces in the audience, Chris, Peter and Alex from work, one of Rachel's colleagues and Apu. I think we did good; the crowd appeared pleased and some folks walked up to us and let us know how much they enjoyed it! Nothing like a little bit o appreciation. :) Apu showed his by buying us dinner at the   urlLink KingFish   across the street ..
