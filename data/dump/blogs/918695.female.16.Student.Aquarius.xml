      so ever start to realize that someone you thought was your friend in all acutality isn't.That they just keep you around because they need to fill there friend quota and that you mean nothing but status and someone whos willing to give a ride. Yeah todays kind of like that.I am really disapointed because I have known them for awhile and it just sucks but in the end I think I sort of asked for it.... enough for today

      ugh..so today is another one of those days..its one of those days when you really lose faith in people and there decisions.Really I think we all would be alot better off if we all just listened to me   I am just a little bias  anyways..so I was talking to my mom ..yeah thats a first..because she saw me looking at haircolors and shit so I am just going to wait till summer and see if my hair gets naturally lighter because of the sunlight  not gonna happen but since it wont I can do whatever I want I think she said in july...

      today..hm... I went to the movies/ontario mills  the mills  with Kim and Joe.It was fun. We walked around the mall like 5 million times and we went to the rainforest cafe and had to sit right next to the damn monkey which kept scaring me (it was like holloween all over again) and then Kim was gonna ride the bull @ gameworks but she talked herself out of it.damn.Then we saw stepfords wives which was okay but nicole kidman walks funny so I was distracted by that.  So all in all today was okay but other stupid things that I shouldnt be getting upset about is getting me upset right now so I dont know...I am really just starting  to know   cerrtant stuff really might  not work out ...  oh and daniel and and ashley are still living next door.until the landlord kicks them out because there dad got into a fight with them..hmm.. i feel so bad for them..they should live with us!   or not   oh and god the stupid band playing a few houses down is ruining love song..ahh...cover you ears now.

      so disneyland disneyland was awesome I got up way to early for it being the summer but anyways we picked everyone up the freeway was packed like it almost always is.It was okay though because we where still on time to get the tickets and we went into to disneyland like right away and we first got fastpasses for spalsh mountain because the line is allways three miles long.Then ::cough Marie and Lisa forgot to wait for me and joe cough::: me and joesph went on haunted mansion lol and he did his chick laugh which everyone thought was me.. Thennn we went to the matterhorn  funny name  and it was the longest walk ever and captin hook scared the shit out of me.so we went to star tours...the best ride ever...well second best after space mountain which is closed...hehhee that was fun....after that we went on the tea cups and we didnt really fit so me and lisa got hit with the door when we where opening and closing it.thhhhen we went on spalsh mountain and right before we left the place we got on the guy told us the person in the 3rd seat allways get soaked and of coarse that was me and i was stuck in between Joesph and Marie so they where spalshing each other but the water landed on me  never ever ever accidently drink the water from that ride..it taste like shit  Thhhenn its kind of a blur but i think we then went to c.a. adventure  more like c.a. rip off  and we rode the roller coaster and it was sooo muuuchhh fun.then we ate and we had this crazy watiress lady at this really super nice restuarnt and lisa broke the peper mill thing  for once Joesph was possibly acting the maturest   then we just in the hotels chairs because they where the most comfortable chairs ever. Then we went on the roller coaster again..that was fun.Then we went on the raft ride   haha i goooot weeet  and we went inline to go on it again but it broke down soo sadd..so we went to disneyland and we walked around and we rode the train and went on pirates of the carribean.Thhhennn we i dont know but...we did ride the matterhorn again and we forced joesph on its a small world while sang really really really loud...haha so then it was late and we left and we ate at rainforest cafe and me and lisa order babby squid.yumm.but that was it...it was pretty damn awesome

      okay so I went and saw thoroughly modern Millie. I am a nerd I  love  that movie.I have to say I was disappointed. I mean the costumes and shit was okay.The sets sort of sucked but yeah.The acting was okay.I really couldnt stand the lady who  played Mrs.Meers could have done a better job.I mean she was amusing but i dont know I didnt buy it.Really it wasnt terrible but it wasnt fantastic. I am still sunburned  I complain a lot...

      Today was really long I had to wake up at like 7 in the morning and I haven't done that in like a month the driving instructor kept eating and I was really hungry but I left my money at home.  I drove pretty well until that homeless man appeared in front of the car..I swear I didnt hit him or see him . I had to pick up heather..Good times I saw me and heather saw dodgeball and around the world in 80 daysand dodgeball was awesome and I got this really cool breakfast club shirt. Then we went to joes crab shack..yep so now im really tired because im use to doing nothing.

      wow such an orignal title jess! like two people get that and the other person isnt here right now..ahh...i feel like such a loser.its 11:00 pm..nice summer night outside and im inside by my self. today was just ehh..i cant explain it.like i havent had any sleep.you know how in lost in translation everythings just so odd and yet everyone around is so serious you just dont know what to think...well  thats how today was. I woke up at what i thought was really early but it was only like 9am.We had to take my grandma to city of hope for a confermation visit for something like that.and it feels like i woke up early because last night i just couldnt sleep because it was really hot and then i went to the kitchen and the only thing to drink was coffee so i was pretty wired till about 3..i really never realized how bad tv got to be after 12.I basicly just watched that one station that me and joe watch.So i woke up and my tv is still on which is pretty crazy because normally light bothers me and i wont be able to sleep but i must have been pretty tired.On top of that i felt like crap so i thought..hmm..take some tylenol..so i took two right after i woke up.so i have to get my grandma in the car and so on right now im feeling like beyond tired and then i remember right before i went to sleep i took like 2 clartins...oh great..so i was just sort of out of it and i hadnt ate really..i was trying to be all cool about everything like i could wait and eat latter but my blood sugar was realllllyy low (like that one day in p.e. freshman year except worse) so my mom had me take my grandma in when they did her vitals..which was okay..so at first we went into this room where they took her blood preasure...but i couldnt really see when i was going through the door because i was feeling really dizy and all a sudden everything went all blury so im like falling all over but i made it look like i knew what i was doing  yeah right  it was funny the guy dan who was taking her blood presure waslike uhmm...what are you doing? so anyways and then we take her to get her blood drawn and i swear it took 30 mins..i dont know how the lady that took her blood could be a nurse because she couldnt get the vain..and i was thinking ohh shit..so i i started geting all dizzy again..lucky before i started to really feel bad bad bad she was able to finish. so anyways im siting in the waiting room and i dont know it was sort of odd..they where calling numbers but they wherent in any order..i swear it was like 2,65,19,78,14,7, and so everyone was all confused.it was sort of interesting to watch..then some guy was trying to get water (see how boring my week has been that i have to sit and explain all this) and he knocked down all the cups well...i was trying to get water for me to so i would get all dizzy again and im trying to help him and he got all mad at me and hes swinging his arms around yelling and he knocks over the water container and it goes everywhere..and im trying so hard not to laugh and everyones like oooh mmmy good how horrible!!! so anyways i tried to cassuily walk away from the pyscho which i found to be really hard.anyways by now its my grandmas turn to go in so we go in and we wait for what feels like forever to see the doctor and im just siting there in this wheel chair because they nothing for me to sit in and all a sudden someone starts pushing me...it scared the shit out of me at first but it was sooo much fun..then i got in trouble with some guy in a suit he said i wasnt supost to be playing the wheel chairs or something stupid but i had nothing to sit on so what am i supost to do so anyways i go back and the doctor is just talking to my grandma saying how sick she was...no shit...and then she could say the word platelet...it was vaguely amusing i sat there forever trying to figure out what she was saying then im like ohhh i get it...so anyways they had to send her to urgent care to stay until they get a bed so we are walking to urgent care with dan and i saw like a million beds i was sooo annyoed i tried to get dan just to let her stay in one of the empty ones he said there where "precautions" or some bull crap like that..so after they send her to urgent care we go get something to eat at the caf..so we get there and its like everyone for themselves...there where all the pyscho med students cutting in front of me...for shame...so i cut in front of one of them and they got all mad at me i was just stand there...i dont hear you.... so after that we went back and she still hadnt gotten a room so my mom was like whatever why dont i just drop you off at home..so i drove home and someone for the first time flipped me off while driving!!I am so proud...i was being extra carefull because at the time i really didnt have my permit with me (ooppps) so i didnt want to get pulled over or in an accdent...not that i normally want to but you know...so i was going about speed limit and this guy behind me is going crazy..i mean the whole deal like the yelling,the waving of the fist,the honking,the hit of the stearing wheel, so im just laughing and i was like hmmm...so i didnt let him in front of me at first and then when i did he got all mad and fliped me off as he passed me...hahahaha.so that was about all of my day that was interesting i spent the rest at home sleeping off and on..then i had to got riverside for this deal with rainbow...and now here i am... that was a long post...if you really sat through all that and read all that..you are on my cool list (a long with sebastian from heathers cruise who sang hot hot hot for me...i wish i had been there....i miss out on some german guy dancing!)

      so i begin my week of true lonerness. at least heather takes advantage of internet cafes because otherwise i wouldnt get to her about her wonderful cruise...except for the part where she may get left behind and become a lumber jack... yes one day of being stuck alone without much human contact has resulted in me rambling on and on about nothing... anyways a week cant be that long...  in other news i put a scratch on the side of my moms car...no one has noticed..yet..lets hope for awhile...

      How was your day? I figured I should ask you.. So..this is my rant for the week if you own a coffee shop/coffee bar/coffee house or some place that's primary product is coffee...And your out of coffee...POST A DAMN SIGN. So I am at city of hope today with my mom and my grandma and I don't know why but I was so damn tired.I mean I know why I stayed up but I slept in till 11 which should cancel out the staying up but no.So its like 3 in the afternoon and I feel like shit so I think..hmm..I will get a large coffee...Maybe fall asleep in a chair..Have a nice relaxing time while I wait for my grandma's cemo to be done..NOPE...I mean come on..This was going to be the high point of my day..Anyways..I think the guy realized how pissed off I was so he stamped my little frequent buyers card like 3 extra times...Which is sooo going to help me because I am not taking my grandma the next few times for cemo but whateves..I guess it made up for it....but enough of my mindless ramblings on coffee.. so I finished the a-list..It was really good and now I think I am addicted to the series
