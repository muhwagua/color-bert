       Stalled   I feel like my workout schedule is an old gas lawnmower, and I keep pulling the cord, hopiong the engine will start up... but it only sputters. Sometimes I  think  it's going to work, and it even runs for a second or two. But it just blows out dirty, smelly puffs of choking black smoke, sputters and lays still once more.  I got sick last week. The only thing that would make me feel better was about a billion gallons of orange juice, and a whole lot of mint chocolate chip ice cream. Unfortunately that kinda screwed up my diet, and I couldn't very well go lifting while I was in bed sniffling. My momentum died. I haven't been to the gym in almost two weeks.  Now, since I haven't worked out in a while, I'm tired. And since I'm tired, I don't have the energy to go work out. DAMN these vicious circles!!!  Damn  them!  I must overcome.

       C2.W2.D6   Current: 186 lbs, 14.5% BF   Okay, I haven't really been following the plan to the letter. My diet isn't strict BFL, but it's close, though I am taking waaaay too many free days... ;-)  The good news is that I overestimated my body fat percentage. It turns out I am currently about 14.5% BF, according to my nifty digital caliper.  :-)  At a current weight of -- checking the bathroom scale -- 186 pounds, that means I am lugging around about 27 pounds of fat on me, and I am 159 pounds of lean mass.  Okay, so to get down to 8 percent body fat, I have to lose 14 pounds of fat, thus bringing me to about 173 pounds. That is doable in 2 months. Or, I can gain a pound of muscle and lose 13 pounds, bringing me to about 174 pounds. Either way, I'll be at 8 percent BF and hopefully be able to see my abs.  :-)

       C2.W1.D1   Well, this is it. Challenge 2, Week 1, Day 1. For the third time. The reason I keep sputtering out is, up until now, I have had tons of other things to do. First study for the LSATs. Then write the law school essay. Then fill out the applications. Now, however, I find myself with a load of time when I come home from work. I plan to fill much of that time with getting back in shape.  It's not that I'm  out  of shape -- I can still run 3 or 4 miles without stopping to walk too much -- but I am not in as good a shape as I was during the height of my first Body for Life Challenge. Nor do I look as good. I am eager to get all of that back.  So today I begin. I went shopping last night for healthy food, and today I have had a protein drink, handful of grapes, and a turkey sandwich. Tonight I will do upper body, and probably take my Before picture. In a couple of days my digital caliper is coming, and I will be able to know exactly what my body fat percentage is.  I'm currently 187 pounds, and I'm guessing 17 percent body fat. My goal is to get down to 8 percent body fat. Assuming I gain 3 pounds of muscle, in order to have an 8% BF level I will have to weigh 172 pounds.  So in other words, my goals are: 1) Lose 18 pounds of fat 2) Gain 3 pounds of muscle  I think, if I achieve those two goals, that will mean everything else will have fallen into place.  Now, let's do the weekly breakdown:  Day 0: Jan 6  - 187 lbs, 17% body fat Day 7: Jan 13 - 186 Day 14: Jan 20 - 184 Day 21: Jan 27 - 182 Day 28: Feb 3 - 180 Day 35: Feb 10 - 178 Day 42: Feb 17 - 176 lbs, 11% body fat Day 49: Feb 24 - 175 Day 56: Mar 3 - 174 Day 62: Mar 10 - 173 Day 69: Mar 17 - 173 Day 77: Mar 24 - 172 Day 84: Mar 31 - 172 lbs, 8% body fat  (Those last few weeks are where the lost fat and gained muscle cancel each other out.)  Hmmm... If I could get down to 172 by the end of March, that would be really good. The thing is, I *know* this is very doable, as I lost even more weight last time. It just surprises me that March 31 is only 12 weeks from now, and I can actually make such a transformation in that time. Hmm....  OK, time to get back to work :-)

          Challenge 2, Week 3, Day 1   "Sure I am of this, that you have only to endure to conquer. You have only to persevere to save yourselves." -Sir Winston Churchill   It's easy to get thrown off track. Last week's injury deflated my spirits. I wasn't able to move without pain, to get out of bed without all sorts of complicated maneuvers to ensure the least possible use of my lower back muscles. So know what I did? I compensated for my pain by eating whatever the hell I felt like. I think I took at least 2 free days last week, and didn't exercise at all past Monday.  Today, I can move again. I don't know how long that ability will last, so I plan to take it easy tonight. I will still work my upper body, but do so with weight machines as opposed to free weights; free weights require too many stabilizer muscles, and I may reinjure my back.      Today's Meals    Handful of raisins (100 calories) Pepper turkey sandwich (300 cal, 20g protein), Mt. Dew (330 - bad Matt) Pepper turkey sandwich (300, 20g) Two chicken breasts, sourdough bread (500, 60g) Cottage cheese, protein drink (400, 50g)  Total: 1930 calories, 150g

       Challenge 2, Week 2, Day 3   "We no other pains endure Than those that we ourselves procure." -Spencer Dryden   On Monday night, during my lower body workout, I pulled a muscle in my lower back. It wasn't during a set itself, but between sets. I had just finished 12 reps of 210 lbs. on the leg press (relatively light for me), and as I twisted my torso left and down to pick up my log, I felt an excruciating spasm in my lower back. I was able to walk it off and continue with my workout, and on Tuesday I had no problems -- until I was about to go to sleep. As I was getting ready for bed, the pain returned, and it was worse than it had been -- so bad, that I couldn't even move without stabbing pain radiating from the muscle I no doubt pulled.  I was unable to go to work today, and unable to workout. Thus, this week does not look so good for me, BFL-wise. However, I do look thinner -- many people have commented on it -- and I am keeping to a healthy diet. Proper nutrition is, after all, half the battle.  Hopefully I will be well enough to do some cardio and maybe light weights in the next couple of days, but until further notice, I plan to postpone working out HARD until Monday. And I will, accordingly, make next week the new Week 2.  yes, I can do that.  :-)

          Challenge 2, Week 1, Day 7   Okay, I'm trying to keep to the diet today, but it will require a trip or two to Subway... as for exercise, I realized that I didn't bring my shorts or t-shirt with me, and exercising in boxers at a friend's place just isn't cool. So, alas, I think I'll have to forego the cardio today, unless I can do it tonight when I get back to Southfield. We'll see.  *** Addendum: Decided to go see Daredevil instead of getting home early enough to exercise. Great movie! Critics know nothing! Oh, and I didn't get any popcorn... but did have a couple Mountain Dews to stay awake.  :-)  It's okay, I still have a calorie deficit for the day, though pretty low protein (~65g... Must make up for it tomorrow.      Today's Meals    Scrambled eggs, toast 6" Turkey sub Mint mocha w/ skim milk 6" Turkey sub 40 oz of Mountain Dew Late-night munching (turkey breast, a buffalo wing)

       Challenge 2, Week 1, Day 6 (FREE DAY)   "No TV and no beer make Homer something something." -Homer Simpson   Conscious of the fact that I have been invited to a couple parties tonight in A2, I decided to make today, rather than tomorrow, my free day for this week. That basically means I can eat whatever the hell I want, and not exercise. Today I have eaten a chicken fajita, bag o' Fritos, a couple Mountain Dews, a big piece of meat-lover pizza... and tonight I'll be drinking lots and lots of "refreshments."  :-)  So tomorrow I have to get back on it. Cardio... of course, since I'm spending most of the day in A2, I'll have to get it done here somehow... and it's too cold to run outside without sweats (which I don't have)... I really don't want to do jumping jacks for 20 minutes but if worse comes to worst I just might have to...

          Challenge 2, Week 1, Day 5   "Being busy does not always mean real work. The object of all work is production or accomplishment and to either of these ends there must be forethought, system, planning, intelligence, and honest purpose, as well as perspiration. Seeming to do is not doing." -Thomas A. Edison    I got back late from Ann Arbor last night, and didn't have a chance to make my meals for today. This morning I overslept and didn't have a chance to go to the gym. Now I have to decide between going to the gym tonight, or driving back to Ann Arbor to see Daredevil.  Well, I definitely don't want to screw up in my first week... we shall see.  *** Update: Elizabeth made me take her to Bangkok Express for lunch... meaning I had a bit of Thai food... I asked for my Pad Thai with light oil, but who know what goes on back there. Anyway, there wasn't dripping cheese or cream or anything so it can't be  that  bad for me. It did have a portion of protein and one of carbs, though... probably two of carbs.  Here's something that may be of note: After the waiter brought the Pad Thai and I had a couple of bites, a slight wave of nausea hit me. It wasn't too bad, and it subsided in a minute or two, but I'm inclined to think it's the oil/grease in the Pad Thai that brought it on. Maybe my body is realizing that oil and grease isn't as appetizing as it used to be? I remember at the end of my first Challenge, I couldn't stand even the  thought  of greasy food. The thought of a big greasy hamburger would make me sick. Maybe today's nausea was the beginning of that state of mind's return...  Or maybe the oil was just rancid.  *** It's now 6:30 p.m. and I'm trying to find the energy to go to the gym. I didn't have a lot of sleep last night, and my energy is all off due to not eating enough today. Plus, it's Valentine's Day and I am once again left home alone. I can see how that fact would increase my motivation to go to the gym -- somewhat questionable rationale: if I get really studly, no more Valentine's Days at home -- but frankly all it makes me want to do is lay on the couch with a box of donuts.      Today's Meals    A few Combos Chicken, noodles, rice Mountain Dew Chicken, noodles (Thai leftovers), grapes Protein drink (2 servings), cinnamon apple sauce

          Challenge 2, Week 1, Day 4   "The world that we are preparing is a world of victory after victory, triumph after triumph: an endless pressing, pressing, pressing upon the nerve of power.” --George Orwell, 1984   I got in my 20 minutes of stationary bike this morning before work. Now it's out of the way and I can enjoy my day with no impending sense of deadlines! Well, at least no fitness-related deadlines (work is another story). I don't like doing my exercise at night. It means I can't relax at home; I'm always watching the clock to see when I have to get to the gym. At night the gym  interrupts  my day, and keeps me up late; in the morning the gym  jump starts  my day and gives me energy.  I don't think there's a question here.  Before pic is up (left column, scroll down). I'm pleased to see that I don't look nearly as bad as I did in the 2001 Before pic. I look much closer to the after pic -- and, comparing it to my 2001 interim photos, I most resemble week 7 or 8.  :-)  So I don't have to do too much to get back to where I was. (This reminds me of high school. Over summer break you forget everything, and then spend a couple of months in the fall reviewing.)       Today's Meals    Protein drink, bagel, little bit o' cream cheese Turkey sandwich Protein drink, red grapes Turkey sandwich with spinach Steak burrito from Panchero's ("Cheese?" "Un poquito!")

          Challenge 2, Week 1, Day 3   "God bless the snooze button, that tiny wonder of modern technology, allowing dreams to continue longer than deserved." -Unknown   I slept for 9 hours last night. As such I didn't get to the gym this morning. I will after work though... today is lower body day! I hate lower body day!  By the way, my upper body soreness is finally hitting me. I never realized how many things my pectorals are used for. Taking off my jacket is the worst! So is putting on my seatbeIt. Triceps are also sore -- I like the feeling of stretching out my arms and locking my elbows -- it makes my triceps let out a victory cry. Oh, and my biceps are sore for the first time in months and months, meaning I finally worked them hard enough. I'm not surprised -- at the end of my UPWO (upper body workout), 10 lb. hammer curls were almost impossible! Ten pounds! (That is very light, meaning my muscles were basically failing -- that is a good thing, because it means they'll grow back stronger.)  I also have to take my before pictures tonight.      Today's Meals    Protein drink, red grapes Turkey sandwich A few peanuts, Mountain Dew (got to give these up...) Turkey sandwich with spinach Grilled chicken, baked potato, BBQ sauce Double protein drink (60g protein, 400 calories)

          Challenge 2, Week 1, Day 2   "Confront the dark parts of yourself, and work to banish them with illumination and forgiveness. Your willingness to wrestle with your demons will cause your angels to sing. Use the pain as fuel, as a reminder of your strength."       -August Wilson   I never knew how soundly I could sleep until my alarm pierced my unconsciousness at 7 a.m.  I immediately realized how tired I had been, and how heavy my body felt. I was  not  ready to get up. I snoozed until after 8, and was still able to get in a good cardio workout at the gym. It wasn't as long as I had planned -- slightly less than 15 minutes -- but it did get pretty intense. I would have gone longer, but it appears I pushed myself just a bit too hard on Saturday (Day 0) during my pre-Challenge run. After a couple minutes at 7 mph this morning, my legs simply did not want to run anymore. And since I am not too keen on the idea of overtraining this early in the Challenge, I cut my losses and hit the showers.  I'm sore, and I know I'll be even more sore once tomorrow rolls around. Soreness is good, though. And since I exercised in the morning, I have all evening to relax. :-)      Today's Meals    Bagel  Turkey sandwich on whole wheat  Turkey sandwich on whole wheat  Apple, a few peanuts  Grilled chicken with wild rice  Turkey sandwich on crackers

          Challenge 2, Week 1, Day 1      "Let me embrace thee, sour adversity,          For wise men say it is the wisest course."  -Shakespeare   A comfortable bed complete with heated mattress pad foiled my plans to exercise at the crack of dawn. Got to work at 9:30, where I have been zonked all day. That's what happens when I sleep in on Sunday, I suppose.  My meals have been pretty healthy today, my only indulgence being a Mountain Dew to try to combat the effects of sleep deprivation. It hasn't worked. That's what happens when I drink Mountain Dew every day, thereby developing an immunity to caffeine, I suppose...  The plan is: Go to the gym at 6, and hit it hard. I'm tired now, but I have found that during a hard workout, it doesn't matter if I've slept 3 hours or 9 hours; I become fully awake. Unfortunately, 6 p.m. on Monday is about the busiest time of the week. A 50 minute workout will probably take me 1:15 or so. Get home by 8. Have a nice dinner. Relax, make my meals for tomorrow. In bed by 10? Ideally. Then a full night of rest, and start the process again -- this time with enough sleep to exercise in the  morning .   To possibilities!   * * *  Addendum: I made it to the gym and REALLY pushed myself hard for an hour. When I hit my dumbbell presses after doing all those flyes... Wow. A perfect 10.  Now I am completely beat. Grabbin' the shake and flax oil, gulping down some water and then enjoying a night of deep sleep. I'll get my workout logs up here soon.       Today's Meals    Cup of low-fat cottage cheese, apple  Turkey sandwich on whole wheat  Tuna sandwich on whole wheat, Mountain Dew  Cup of low-fat cottage cheese  Turkey burger cut up in whole wheat pasta, with tomato sauce, carrots on the side (this meal was delicious!)  Protein shake, tablespoon of flaxseed oil

       All aboard!   We are in a rebuilding phase. The sickness threw me, I'll admit it. But I'm preparing to get back on the train and start chugging along. I was playing around with the video camera earlier this week, and I realized, much to my chagrin, that I am putting the pounds back on. The scale says I'm around 188, and the double chin is just a little more pronounced now. It's obvious. I think that's the magic number: At 188 lbs, I start to look "beefy." (That's the word I'm using. Not husky.  Never  husky!)  Upon realizing that truth, I ran to the store (well, okay, drove) and bought a bunch of healthy food. My diet was perfect BFL for about the next DAY, and then I started slacking AGAIN. What is it with me? Why was I able to succeed so well the first time I tried the challenge, but now I keep getting knocked off course within just a few days? The answer, I believe, is work. Or, more generally, time. I lack time now. I lack the unending hours of summer, when I was taking only 6 credits and therefore able to devote hours a day to getting in shape. I mean, what else had I to do? Homework took an hour a day, maybe. I was in class for two hours a day, on average. That leaves 13 more waking hours, in which using 1-2 for getting in shape and making healthy meals is a snap!  Now, I don't have 13 free hours a day. I sleep for 8 hours. Am at work for 9 hours. That leaves 7 hours. Take away driving time and I'm down to 6.5 hours. Now, time for getting up in the morning and I'm down to 5.5 hours.  The question now becomes, how do I want to USE those hours? By far the biggest unintentional drain on my time comes from AIM. I sit down to chat and the next thing you know 2 hours have passed. It's just the nature of the medium -- what would be a 20 minute phone call takes 2 hours online. So what happens is I get home from work, lay down on the couch for a bit and watch the news, have some dinner, go online... and the next thing I know it's 10 p.m. and I have squandered most of the evening.  But is rest and relaxation tantamount to squandering? I enjoy my evenings. *Sigh*... but I knew I would enjoy them more if I had more energy. The efficient thing to do would be to wake up around 7, go right to the gym, get ready there, be at work by 9 and then BE ABLE to use my time after work for whatever I please. I could still bum around from 6-11 if I like.  Okay, I have to do this. I know I have to. I want to be in shape by the time I go to law school, but moreso than that, I want to surprise Katherine when she returns from London.  :-)  So here's the slightly updated plan:  Day 0: Feb 9 - 188 lbs, 16% body fat Day 7: Feb 16 - 186 Day 14: Feb 23 - 184 Day 21: Mar 2 - 182 Day 28: Mar 9 - 180 Day 35: Mar 16 - 178 Day 42: Mar 23 - 176 lbs, 10% body fat Day 49: Mar 30 - 175 Day 56: April 6 - 174 Day 62: April 13 - 173 Day 69: April 20 - 173 Day 77: April 27 - 172 Day 84: May 4 - 172 lbs, 8% body fat  So, that's the plan. Again, looking at the raw numbers, it pleasantly surprises me that within two months -- just 8 weeks from now -- I can be a very trim 175. I haven't been that low since freshman year in college.  :-)  Then the third month will be a breeze. The first month is always the hardest. I just have to remind myself that it's worth it. Eat healthy. You have your one free day a week where you can eat ANYTHING you want! But it's just for that day. The whole rest of the week, you *must* eat healthy -- which, remember, isn't that bad and can actually be quite tasty. Grilled chicken with barbecue sauce cut up and mixed with pasta!  Tasty tuna sandwiches! Chicken and salsa! George Foreman grilled burgers! The key is to make sure I have all the ingredients available, and have the meals ready to go.  Oh, and one more thing: I'm going to post a lot more pictures up here. And no more faking it. No more headshots taken from above, with an angle that conveniently negates my double chin. No more pictures taken in obscuring shadows. It's got to be the real deal. So here's a headshot from tonight, taken from straight on, full flash. My face will get slimmer and slimmer over the weeks. It will be a fun little project.  :-)   Today, I buy food for the week. And tomorrow I begin. Onward!

       Runnin' along...  I bought a Polar heart rate monitor yesterday, and it was oh-so-neat to watch the heart rate LCD light up when I stepped on the treadmill.  :-)   "105," said it. After jogging for just a couple minutes, it was up to 150, and I hovered between 150 and 170 beats per minute for a while, then walked until it was down to 130, and then brought it up again. I had been jogging between 6-7 mph; toward the end I pushed it up to a whopping 8.3 mph, and saw my pulse slowly climb to 180, 181, 182, 183... by this point I was pretty tired so I walked for a minute, watched my pulse drop to 140 and counting, and called it a day.  Oh yeah, then I did about 45 tough Swiss ball crunches.  Fun times! I like exercising in the morning because it jump starts my day. The problem is actually getting to the gym early enough. I'll try again tomorrow.

       Oh well.  Okay, I didn't make it this morning. But I did get 9 hours of sleep and I'm feeling much better.  :-)    Interesting article in the Wall Street Journal today: It seems heavy lifting may cause your blood pressure to get so high that you either have a stroke or an aneurism or your brain explodes or something. Some recommend superslow lifting as a solution; others say that's even worse. In any case, they say you shouldn't lift more than half your body weight, which effectively cancels out any heavy bench pressing -- I can only dumbbell press 100 or 120, max, but even that is supposedly "too much."  I'll look into this further, but I think as long as you use common sense and don't kill yourself on every set, you should be fine.

       Wow, I made it   This morning when my alarm clock buzzer drilled into my peaceful slumber, I turned it off. And instead of falling back into unconsciousness, I sat up, eyes 95 percent closed, mind even more asleep. But that tiny fraction of my mind that was awake posed a challenge to the sleeping Me: Get up now and go to the gym, or give up your dreams of getting in really good shape.  Exhausted as I was, I knew the sliver of conscious brain was correct. Had I plopped back down in bed and pulled the covers up, I would have realized that my fatigue is greater than my willpower, and I might as well have stopped striving to better myself right then and there.  But I did get up, and I went to the gym, and I exercised. And I feel better for it.

       Feelin' good  Okay, so I went to the gym tonight and did chest/triceps/shoulders. I didn't have a lot of time, so I worked my chest most, followed by the latter two. I did pretty well on dumbbell bench press, doing:  12 reps at 15 pounds each (warm-up) 10 reps at 25 pounds each 8 reps at 35 pounds each 6 reps at 50 pounds each 12 reps at 35 pounds each  That really taxed me out... I could barely get the last rep in... then I tried to do 12 dumbbell flyes at 20 lbs each but found myself dead after 3 reps. I switched down to 15 lbs and was able to get up to 12 total.  You know, it's funny -- when I was putting together the "About Me" section of the web page, I came to the "Hobbies" line and thought to myself, what do I like to do with my free time? Besides vegging out in front of the computer, that is... And I put down "reading" "writing" and "working out."  I wasn't so sure about working out -- could I consider it a hobby? Am I that into it? Well, I realize that I AM into it. A few years ago I was this dork who had hardly set foot into a gym in his life and disdained all things physical... and now I actually enjoy it. And when I'm on, I really get into it! I've read all about exercises and proper form and nutrition and all that -- I probably know more than 4 out of 5 people about that stuff now. I try to get enough protein and I drink lots of water daily and at the gym I wear tank tops and I even grunt on the heavy sets!  I also cut my hair kinda short and am growing a pseudo-goatee, so with the tank top on I actually look somewhat rough and mean, which is neat because I am in reality smooth and nice.  Anyway, enough workout-talk tonight. I am going to *try* to get up in less than 5 hours and do some cardio. I highly doubt I'll make it out of my bed, but at least I will try. Oh yeah, that's the thing... lifting is tons of fun; cardio can be kind of a drag. Cardio's much more fun when it's part of a game like basketball... just sitting there pedaling in place can be tedious and hard. But that's what I have to do to melt the fat. So that's what I'll do (no use having muscles if they're buried under a layer of flab).

       Push it!  My diet has sucked and I'm averaging 3 days a week at the gym. But I must struggle on! Only from the depths of despair has man the perspective to see the true path.  To the gym!

          Challenge 2, Week 3, Day 7   I'm not sure this is working. It seems I can only be enthusiastic about one or two things at once. Fitness may have fallen below the breaking point. I'll keep you updated.

       Not too bad   Okay, so I'm doing the BFL diet to the letter. At least, I did yesterday and I plan to today. It takes about 10 minutes in the morning to throw together a sandwich or two, shake up a couple servings of protein drink, and put it all along with a couple oranges into a bag. That takes care of my diet for the day, and it's less expensive than getting a tuna melt and Mountain Dew every day, so that's good.  :-)  Yesterday I got kinda hungry -- not a lot, but enough so that it was preventing me from focusing on my work. So I grabbed a handful of popcorn, and that tided me over until my next meal.  I kind of wanted "bad" food last night, but there were no cravings or anything, so it wasn't hard to just have cottage cheese or chicken breast with spices instead. After I lifted, I simply ate protein-packed foods until I wasn't hungry anymore, and then I stopped. Pretty simple, really.  Another benefit of eating very healthy foods during the week is that you look forward to the more fattening, tastier food, on the weekend. When you don't get to have it all the time, it becomes more of a treat when you do.  :-)

       Second week...   Okay, I got through week 1. I noticed two things:  1) The lift-at-night/cardio-in-the-morning thing works out pretty well. Doing cardio in the morning jump starts my metabolism and gives me energy throughout the day (especially coupled with the Betalean). Lifting at night works fine as long as I don't go *too* late -- that also revs me up, making it harder to get up early the next morning for cardio. On Saturday I exercise whenever.  2) My Diet Sucks. Last week I did a mostly-BFL diet for the first 4 days of the week, and then completely let it go from Friday through the weekend. I can't do that. About a year ago, I tried doing a BFL-style exercise program -- I exercised most every day, and my diet was okay, but it wasn't perfect. And ya know what happened? Nothing. I didn't gain weight, but I didn't really lose a whole lot of weight -- maybe just a few pounds.  I cannot make a transformation unless I follow the diet to the letter.  This means whole grains, 6 small meals every 2-3 hours, a gallon of water per day, and veggies. My grains have been less than whole; my meals have been fewer than six; I don't get a gallon of water and I hardly ever get my veggies. So... yeah. I know what to do. I just have to do it.

       On track.   So this is how it's playing out: On lifting days, I end up going to the gym pretty late, and pushing it hard. Then the next morning I'll do cardio before work. It's only been 4 days but this seems like an easy routine to maintain, as compared to my previous "Get to the gym every morning at 7 a.m." delusion, which left me tired for the rest of the day. Never enough sleep with that one. With  this  plan, however, the rest comes naturally.  I like it!

       Chipper YO!   I had a dream last night. I was wandering around a college campus -- I think it was a quasi-Michigan, but that's of no import -- after having driven all night. I walked into a bathroom in one of the buildings, and looked in the mirror. My eyes were leaning to the red side, a sign that I had been up all night. (Either that, or my eyes were traveling away from me at an  enormous  velocity! Sorry, I'm a cosmology geek.)   :-)  But I noticed something else: I looked older, thinner, more... rugged. My jaw line was more clearly define, and my baby fat was gone. I suddenly realized that this was a dream, and this is what I  could  look like in a few years if I keep working out! Well, I woke up, sluggish, with a recollection of the generalities of the dream, but no specifics. I looked at my alarm clock -- I had set it early so I could do cardio before work. Ugh. I didn't want to go.  As I considered falling back asleep, my mind wandered through the events of the dream. When I got to my looking in the mirror, I remembered what had happened, and what I had realized in the dream. And suddenly I was excited, and eager to go to the gym to make the dream a reality!  And now, after having done 25 minutes of sweat inducing cardio, I feel great. Absolutely great. Chipper, awake, everything.  Something else -- last night, as I was considering whether to go lifting, I looked in the mirror and noticed that my left bicep was starting to show blue veins! This is something my right bicep has shown for about a year, but never my left. Boy, was I excited.  :-)  It was after 10, but I drove to the gym with a gusto little before displayed by any Schwartz. Got in a great workout.  Things are coming together...  :-)

       Run, run, gotta run, I gotta run... Gotta run -  woooo-oooo  - I gotta run...   Went running last night! Well, jogging. Accordingto my nifty Polar, I was jogging for about 35 minutes, during which my average heart rate was 150 bpm, and I spent 31 minutes in my target HR zone of 128-169! That basically means I burned a lot of calories. (503, specifically).  :-)  Now I just have to, well, keep doing it. Actually I was surprised -- it wasn't too hard to go for 35 minutes, and with the HRM guiding me along and beeping when i got too fast / too slow, I was able to exert not too much effort that I burned out, but enough to really make a difference!  Very exciting.  :-)

       Tired. Damn stupid tired! Cycles! Tired! Crap!   When I don't exercise on a regular basis, I get tired. Very tired. Then, it's hard to get back into exercising because I lack energy. Vicious cycle. I'm sure I've talked about this before. Too much stuff going on. Concerts, reunions, dates, work. No  Me  time.  I want some me time.

       Ugh   I am never taking a Free Day again. I ate so much shit yesterday, I felt nauseaus all day, and extremely tired to boot. I don't know if that's because of my hard run from the day before, or because of my poor eating, or maybe both. Anyway, it seems very stupid to me to be so health conscious during the week, losing two pounds on average, and then throw half of it away when I gain a pound on Free Day.  OK, I think I know what the problem was. I went  out of my way  to eat bad food on Free Day. I thought, since I *have* the opportunity, I am going to make use of it. Even if I didn't have any cravings. Well that is stupid stupid stupid. This will be my new Free Day mantra:  Don't go out of your way to eat.  Feel free to have a nice burger, or some Thai food or something, if you really want one. But if chicken would suffice, eat that. If you're really craving a sweet, eat it. But don't get a box of 6 donuts and see how many you can eat. That's just counterproductive.  (Yes, I got a box of 6 donuts and saw how many I could eat. (Four.) I felt, and still feel, like a big disgusting cow. I am never going to do that again.)  I'm still tired, and I want to get back into my exercising routine after the gluttony that was my Free Day. Today is the beginning of a new week: Week Three. I have done well for the past two weeks. I will only do better over the next two!

       Pump up the JAM   My  urlLink new MP3 player  arrived yesterday, and with musical motivation I pushed myself harder than I have in years!! After 20 minutes on the bike, I realized I could do more. I  wanted  to do more. So I got on the treadmill and ran a mile.  :-)  Fun times. I think I'm starting to nauseate family and friends with my enthusiasm.  (Check out the MP3 player  urlLink link  for some hilarious Korean-to-English mistranslation.)

       Sweat   DAMN, I was pushing myself so hard at the gym last night! Once you find that balance of weight that will allow you do just about 12 reps and no more... it's an exciting experience. It is difficult to find the balance -- I don't think I've found it completely. All I know is that I was pushing myself HARD last night, for more than an hour. Highlights:   My whole upper torso, neck and face turning bright red, with little veins standing out, when I did the 20-25 pound side arm-raises -- I looked like the Red Hulk; and  Utilizing my biceps on almost every other body part's exercise, and then STILL barbell curling 65 pounds between 10-12 times for two sets! And THEN tiring out my biceps even more with a couple sets of 20 lb. concentration curls.   No time this morning to do cardio. I'll do it after work. My MP3 player/radio arrives today, so I can fill it up with 4 hours of workout music and pump up the jam even more.  :-)

      I feel so fat.  I know, that's something usually said only by bloated women on Lifetime (or skinny teens if they are running an after-school special on annhorexia) -- but I do. I remember what it felt like to be lean and trim, and as I sit here now I am acutely aware of my stomach, and double chin... or more specifically, of that bucket of fat sitting on my stomach, and the globs of fat dripping from my jaw.  Not a pretty picture, I know. Now imagine living with that every day.  Oh, by all measures, I am not "fat" -- I may be a little pudgy, but who isn't? And yet, the fact that I'm just a "little pudgy" makes it even worse, in a way. If I were just a big fattie, then I could very well accept my status as Fatty-in-Chief. It would be my new persona. I would make it my own. On the other hand, I could be just as happy (probably happier) as a skinny guy. But right now I'm somewhere in between... a skinny guy who got a little carried away with the ice cream. A fat guy who lost  most  of his flab, leaving a distinct layer of goo hanging around in its wake. Jiggly goo. Jiggly ucky goo that weighs me down and makes me feel kind of like a failure.  I have to lose it. At this point it's not about the energy -- I'm relatively energetic, although I'll admit the inevitable energy boost from working out regularly would be nice. At this point, however, it is simply about getting rid of the excess baggage I've been carrying around since... well, for most of my life. As far as I can remember, I have had a double chin. From the time I was 11 or so, I had a bit of a gut. It's not that bad, but it's there, and while its size fluctuates over time and almost disappeared once, it has still  always  been with me. Even when I was at the height of fitness on my Body for Life program, I  still  had a gut!! And then, after the 12 weeks were over, what did I do? Did I keep going until I reached my ideal weight of 170? Did I strive to lose that last little bit of flab on my tummy? That tiny double-chin whose demise was within my grasp?  NO!!!  I STOPPED WORKING OUT! I celebrated my 12 week success with a full week of utter piggitude, promising myself that I would begin another 12 week program straight away... and I tried. I really did try. But my heart just wasn't in it. Why? Because I had already lost the bulk of my flab. I had gone from 200+ to 178 in a matter of weeks. I had more energy than ever before. I wasn't  hungry  to complete the task -- to become not just healthier than I  had  been, but  as healthy and trim as I could be.   In other words, I start off great but I have no follow through. This problem has followed me throughout my life, from school to work to keeping in shape.  It's time to stop half-assing it.

      At this point, it  is  about the energy.  I am tired. I wake up tired, I am tired through most of the day. This makes it hard to concentrate in class. When I get home, I am even more tired, so I don't get through all my homework. I usually get around 8 hours of sleep, and yet still, I awake fatigued.  Quite clearly, I must do something about this.  I know what I have to do. I have to run. Since my last post a month ago, I hit the gym maybe 3-4 times, and did a few sets of bench presses in my room at home. But it's not enough. I am well aware that, when I get run down like this, I can recharge my batteries by jogging for 20-30 minutes. Just once or twice will od it. I have to do it. I must do it. Yet I have been slacking, putting it off, thinking about it, talking about it, waiting for it...  Do It Now.  I will update later.

      Back on the wagon, as we say. Frith and I went jogging the other day, and it was a lot of fun, and we pushed each other and I ran *really* hard. Finally, three days after the jog, the soreness is gone! Time to do it again.  :-)   I am working on a new Bodyforlife-style program, which I am currently attempting to implement. I kind of started it this week, though I did make some missteps. Still, forge ahead! Today I bought www.PrimalEloquence.com -- it's from a choral piece, and it refers to music's effect on the soul, but I think it works just as well as a description of a fit body. I'll wax more about that when the site is up, probably next week.  And now... okay, Frith asked me to get dinner at the greek restaurant. I know I could eat healthy there but I will probably end up sampling the pastitsio.  Hehe...  as long as I keep getting regular exercise though, this should be able to fit into my plan. Will keep you posted.

       Why I Can't Exercise, Reason 452   I got MONO. I won't lie and say I was  alllll set!  to hit the gym when I was struck down in all my glory by that damn insidious Kissing Disease. But I will say this: I am not allowed to do any strenuous exercise for about a month after my symptoms start to dwindle. As my symptoms will be here for at least a few more days (weeks?), it will be a while before I can hit any 9s or 10s at the gym.  The  good  news is that when they took my tests at the doctor, they learned that my blood pressure is 110/68 and my cholesterol is 119! Perhaps the mono lowered that just a bit, but that is still really good. This proves that I am healthy.  :-)  This, despite eating fast food all last week!

      Did 47 minutes on the exercise bike last night.  :-)  It really wore me out, and I kept my heart rate up the whole time.  FYI -- was reading the Da Vinci Code at the time, and I realized it's not that good. Quite amateurish writing. But who am I to talk? At least he's published stuff.  I also scheduled my fitness evaluation for Sunday morning! I will finally have some good body fat / weight stats, and I think they're going to measure my VO2 max also.  As far as I know, I am around 190 lbs and 16% body fat -- not so horrible. But that's just an estimate. Anyway I would love to get down to single digits!  Last night for dinner I made grilled chicken breast on whole wheat spinach noodles, drizzled with olive oil, and lightly seasoned with salt, pepper and basil. It was delicous! Today I brought my homemade turkey sandwich and a couple Zone bars -- hopefully it will get me through the day.  Lifting weights tonight on my way home from work? Possibly!

      I spent last night A) driving home, B) printing out materials for the law review write-on, and C) sleeping. I was oh-so-tired, so I couldn't get to the gym. Excuses, excuses, I know. But I've brought my ID card with me and I have shorts on under my pants so I'm going to the gym on the way home, whether I like it or not!!!  I don't like it.  PS.  My lunch today had about 1600 calories and 60 grams of fat. The funny thing is, except for the relatively sh!tty fat content, I am not totally screwed: Added to my 120 calorie breakfast of part-skim string cheese, I am only up to 1720 calories for the day. If I have a chicken breast and rice tonight, I can keep my total at around 2100 calories for the day...  Now, my BMR is approximately 2500 calories, meaning that's how much energy my body needs just to be alive per day.   Soooooo..... even if I  don't  exercise, I could STILL lose about 1/4 pound today (assuming 3500 calories is a pound).  This means that if I  do  exercise today, I could lose up to HALF a pound! Wow.

       Soon...    urlLink Primal Eloquence  is operational, albeit in a very preliminary test-page form. Eventually it will contain this blog, a nifty weight/body fat area graph, statistics, pictures -- the whole shebang. Even songs. Yes, songs!  Okay, maybe not songs.  Frith and I have decided that even though we never want to leave, we are in actuality seeing too much of each other. So we have called a two-day embargo on all things couple-related. We aren't even to CALL each other, or send text messages! How does this relate to fitness, you ask? Simple: Though we intend to jog, Frith and I usually end up laying around doing nothing, really. Yesterday morning we were totally unproductive for literally seven hours. Mind you, we COULD have gone jogging had she brought her sneakers -- and technically we *did* get exercise ;-)  -- but she didn't bring her sneakers. I wasn't about to just ignore her and go jogging myself. So... yeah.  The good news is that last week, even with the time sieve, I lost about two pounds! And Frith is down also. Our goal is to be one of those Powercouples (TM) who jog through the neighborhood together and make everybody else jealous. Yes!  So now, with some free time to try to get things back in order, I can actually make healthy meals for the day, AND possibly get to the gym in the  morning.  Possible? Doable? Perhaps? Maybe?  Maybe. Maybe!  We will see. Until then, I have to try to eat healthy at Subway for lunch today, and then after work I have to drag my tired-ass body to the gym, explain to them that I lost my membership ID card, pay $10 for a new ID card, and get on the damn bike. I'll bring the Da Vinci Code so I have something interesting (and easy) to read whilst pumping tbe pedals. Then tonight, I *have* to make my meals for tomorrow. Have to!!!  Tomorrow morning? Exercise. AND wean myself off the daily Bruegger's/Starbucks addiction.  To me-time! :-)

      "Soda causes diabetes! News at eleven."   Be wary of statistics. For a long while now, I have noted with amusement various statistics meant to frighten, cajole and persuade. At first glance, these statistics are frightening, but a dose of cynicism and a little bit of thinking will go a long way:  Sensationalism runs amok at eDiets.com: "Now here's some scary news: Harvard School of Public Health research indicates women who drank at least one sugar-sweetened soda a day were 85 percent more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those who drank less!"  Well, yes, I don't doubt the veracity of the study. Upon cursory glance, it seems quite legitimate – isn't heavy sugar consumption linked to diabetes? Yes and no. People who consume a lot of sugar are generally overweight, and obesity is definitely a cause of diabetes. But simply consuming a lot of sugar will not, in itself, cause diabetes.   Then, it is very likely that "one sugar-sweetened soda a day" will not cause an 85 percent jump in the diabetes rate. One sugar-sweetened soda a day, coupled with an unhealthy diet and lack of exercise, will. This Harvard study found a correlation, not a causation.  Not convinced? Look at this snippet from an  urlLink AP article :   "According to [the] study, the women most prone to gaining weight had increased their consumption of sugary soft drinks from less than one a week to more than one a day. On average, those women gained nine-10 pounds in a four-year period. But women who cut their intake of soft drinks gained an average of three pounds or less."    Honestly, I am not entirely sure what this means. Did the study organizers pick the women most prone to gaining weight and ask them to increase their soda consumption more than seven-fold? In any case, it is clear that there is a very fundamental question here: What caused the increase in diabetes – the increase in sugar consumption or the increase in weight?  In a nod to fair and balanced reporting, the AP quoted a press release from the National Soft Drink Association that responded to the study. The soft drink makers called the study "unconvincing and inconclusive" because it raises questions over "factors that could create inaccuracies." The article stopped there, but a quick skim of the  urlLink press release  provides the needed details:   "It is unknown whether or not this study adjusted for all of the above risk factors for type 2 diabetes or for other risk factors sometimes referred to in the medical literature such as high salt intake, high blood pressure, alcohol intake and high fat intake. If this study were adjusted for all of these confounding factors, it is doubtful it would show any risk for developing type 2 diabetes from soft drink consumption," said Dr. Richard Adamson, vice president for scientific and technical affairs for NSDA.    The moral of the story? It's easy to fall victim to scary statistics. Respond with your mind rather than your fears. Always look at both sides of an issue. And don't believe everything you read.

On average, those women gained nine-10 pounds in a four-year period. But women who cut their intake of soft drinks gained an average of three pounds or less."    Honestly, I am not entirely sure what this means. Did the study organizers pick the women most prone to gaining weight and ask them to increase their soda consumption more than seven-fold? In any case, it is clear that there is a very fundamental question here: What caused the increase in diabetes – the increase in sugar consumption or the increase in weight?  In a nod to fair and balanced reporting, the AP quoted a press release from the National Soft Drink Association that responded to the study. The soft drink makers called the study "unconvincing and inconclusive" because it raises questions over "factors that could create inaccuracies." The article stopped there, but a quick skim of the  urlLink press release  provides the needed details:   "It is unknown whether or not this study adjusted for all of the above risk factors for type 2 diabetes or for other risk factors sometimes referred to in the medical literature such as high salt intake, high blood pressure, alcohol intake and high fat intake. If this study were adjusted for all of these confounding factors, it is doubtful it would show any risk for developing type 2 diabetes from soft drink consumption," said Dr. Richard Adamson, vice president for scientific and technical affairs for NSDA.    The moral of the story? It's easy to fall victim to scary statistics. Respond with your mind rather than your fears. Always look at both sides of an issue. And don't believe everything you read.

        After his death,  Osama bin Laden went to paradise. He was greeted by George Washington, who slapped him across the face and yelled, "How dare you attack the nation I helped conceive!"  Patrick Henry punched Bin Laden in the nose and shouted, "You wanted to end America's liberty, but you failed."  James Madison appeared, kicked him in the groin, and said, "This is why I allowed the government to provide for the common defense."  Bin Laden was subjected to similar beatings from John Randolph, James Monroe, Thomas Jefferson and 66 other early Americans. As he writhed in pain on the ground, an angel appeared. Bin Laden said, "This is not what I was promised."  The angel replied, "I told you there would be 72 Virginians waiting for you. What did you think I said?"

       Mom: "I don't know if I've ever told you this, it's kind of stupid, but when I was a kid we always used to love the word Ohio. Ohhhhhh-hi-yo! Isn't it cool? A 'hi' in the middle with two 'O's around it? Ohio! Spelled the same way front and back, as we used to say when we were kids."  (beat)  Matt: "Um, no it isn't..." Mom: (Blank stare) Matt: "Backward it's  oy-ho. "  (Much laughter ensues as my mother realizes she can't think coherently before her morning coffee.)  Matt: "I'm putting this on my Web page." Mom: "Get out of my room! Go away!" Matt: "No state is spelled the same way forward and backward." Mom: "I'm sure there's one!" Matt: "I don't think so." Mom: "Maybe we were thinking of 'Dad' or 'Wow.'"

       Today I pelted someone with a stray innuendo. It was sophomoric and tasteless, yet funny and good. You will see it at the end of this post. But first, I shall whet your appetite with some well-known    THINGS THAT SOUND DIRTY IN LAW BUT AREN'T   10) "Have you looked through her briefs?"  9) "He is one hard judge!"  8) "Counselor, let's do it in chambers."  7) "His attorney withdrew at the last minute."  6) "Is it a penal offense?"  5) "Better leave the handcuffs on."  4) "For $200.00 an hour, she better be good!"  3) "Can you get him to drop his suit?"  2) "The judge gave her the stiffest one he could."  1) "Think you can get me off?"  Source: http://www.unwind.com/jokes-funnies/lawyerjokes/dirtyinlaw.shtml   Now, mine. But first, some background! (This is the part where I sneak in actual legal theories, which makes my blog not just entertaining, but  edu taining!)    The Learned Hand Formula   Learned Hand is the actual name of a famous federal judge. The formula in question tries to determine when negligence has occurred: If B   Anyway, you get the drift. There are lots of other ways to determine negligence. This is one of them.   And now, what I learned today. Telling someone that you're "going home to apply the Learned Hand formula" can have two meanings. It all depends on context. And alcohol.  Lawyers drink a lot.

       I have promised to keep a web log. In response, you -- my faithful reader -- probably bookmarked my site to check it from time to time. This is a form of reliance, and as such I have a duty* to keep the blog chock full of fresh content!  So despite my busy schedule, and the fact that homework seems to be coming at a faster pace than ever before, I feel responsible for providing some sort of legal entertainment. So, to that end, here is some righteous scorn from an early-19th century judge.  :-)  "The son...was twenty-five years old, and had long left his father's family. On his return from a foreign country, he fell sick among strangers, and the plaintiff acted the part of the good Samaritan, giving him shelter and comfort until he died. The defendant, his father, on being informed of this event, influenced by a  transient feeling of gratitude , promised in writing to pay the plaintiff for the expenses he had incurred.  But he has determined to break this promise, and is willing to have his case appear  on record   as a strong example of a particular injustice sometimes necessarily resulting from the operation of general rules."  Mills v. Wyman , 20 Mass. (3 Pick.) 207. (Emphasis added.)  Damn. It's one thing being scolded in private. But in public? For all the world to see? For the rest of eternity? That's rough.   *By "duty," I do not necessarily mean a "legal" duty, but a moral duty. I'm pretty sure there was no consideration, so there is no contract between us; and you can't claim promissory estoppel because I didn't promise anything to  anyone in particular , just to the general public. I don't think that's enforceable, because it lacks specificity. Maybe. I'm just a 1L, for God's sake!

       This relates to law school only tangentially. Please indulge me.  So MS Word was sluggish. I could feel it. Typing notes in class, it took a second or two for autocorrect to fix misspellings, or for asterisks to turn into bullets. I was miffed. I scoured the Web for speed-up tips, and one of them seemed to help (turn off real-time word count), but I wanted a more permanent solution. I wanted a fix that would hold up in the long run. I wanted... a version update.  I go to the Microsoft Web site and learn my version of word -- "X" -- is woefully out of date. I should really be using 10.1.5, which apparently is the height of coolness. I tried to download it, only to be informed that I really should download 10.1.4 first. Fine, I say. I go to download that.  Sorry , they say,  you've got to download 10.1.2 first. Regulations, and all that.  Damn you, I say, and I click the link.  The downloads progress smoothly. I open the updates. One by one, I install the patches. And one by one, what do I find?   "The application Word has unexpectedly quit."   Excuse me?? I try it a couple more times. Same result. I restart the computer, confident that would solve all my computer problems.  Nope.  I am now attempting to download version X, a 102 MB file, from the Case Western web site. The version I started out with. The version I should have stuck with.   So, what have we learned from all this? At the risk of sounding trite, the moral of the story is: If it ain't broke... it isn't Microsoft.

       I went to an interesting talk yesterday. The speaker was Samantha Power, a Harvard professor and Pulitzer Prize winning author of  urlLink  A Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide,   which examines America's reaction to acts of genocide around the world. At the risk of completely misinterpreting the point of her book, Power's thesis was this: "The United States had never in its history intervened to stop genocide and had in fact rarely even made a point of condemning it as it occurred."  And yet, despite her calls for America to  do  something about foreign genocide, Power found herself against the ongoing war/occupation in Iraq. Yes, it got rid of Saddam... but in the process, she said, the U.S. may have caused more problems.  Power believes that in the process of fighting this war, the United States brought four self-fulfilling prophecies to bear:  1.  The Iraq - Al Qaeda connection:  Before the war, the connection was specious. Now, it's stronger than ever before. The war has bonded American haters around the world. See quote #1 for why this is a bad thing.  2.  Targets:  We wanted to lessen the potential for terrorism. Yet now in Iraq, there are a  slew  of soft targets for terrorists.  3.  Legitimacy and Liberation:  As much as it confounds us, many Iraqis saw Saddam as a legitimate ruler. They were fighting for their liberation, yes, but at least the country had a legitimate ruler. Now, however, Iraqis see an occupying force that won't leave. They are still fighting for their liberation -- but now it's against what they perceive as an  illegitimate  ruler.  4.  Ineptitude of the U.N.:  The United States loves to bash the U.N. It doesn't work, we say. It's inept. Now that the Iraqi occupation is becoming more difficult, we are poised to hand off control of the situation to the U.N. In doing so, however, we will give them a black eye because the situation is a  mess.  As Power says, it's a loser of a situation, not something anyone would want to inherit. And yet, the U.N. will probably take a larger role in its rebuilding, and after 5 or 10 years when it's still going on, Americans will start to blame the U.N.'s ineptitude for a bad situation that hasn't much improved.  A few choice quotes from her lecture:  "U.S. security is undermined when everyone hates us."  "It's very useful to know things about the place that you're about to invade."  "The Bush administration  is  right: The Security Council is broken."  And, paraphrasing Robert Frost: "A liberal is someone who's so openminded, he can't take his own side in an argument."  I'm not sure I agree with all her points, but she really made me think. I am grateful for that opportunity. Back in undergrad at U of M, this is the kind of thing I was hoping for. Intelligent speakers that would enlighten. No protestors anywhere to be found. A well thought out, reasoned discussion. At Michigan,  urlLink that was not to be.  Here at Case... it is!

       In America, the legislature plays a unique role: It writes the laws. This is especially true in criminal law, where city, state and federal legislatures pen statutes delineating what is criminal and what is not.   Parts of Europe use common law principles to establish new crimes. For instance, if there are laws on the books establishing the criminality of selling paraphernalia for doing drugs, and an Evildoer decides to sell children paraphernalia for sniffing glue, then courts may find the Evildoer guilty of committing a crime  that had not yet existed!   In the Kingdom, that's cool. Here in the Colonies, that's a violation of Due Process.  But this is all neither here nor there. I just wanted to offer a brief description so that the layman could appreciate this lovely snippet out of our criminal law text. In it, a commentator is describing the wonder that is the U.K.'s common law criminal system:  "When your dog does anything you want to break him of you wait til he does it, and then beat him for it. This is the way you make laws for your dog; and this is the way judges made law for you and me."  ( The Works of Jeremy Bentham )  Ah, whimsy.  :-)

       "Who wants to tell us about  Morales?  Jeff Weiskopf. Where's Jeff. Jeff, tell us about  Morales. "  There was exactly half a second between the prof's question, and his calling on Jeff. And yet, in that instant of time, all of us who didn't remember the facts of  Morales  had hope. Hope that someone else would volunteer, and we would be spared.  Yet, even if the prof entertains the idea of letting people volunteer, he doesn't mean it. It is Russian Roulette, and we are forced to play. There are 80 chambers, and 79 are empty. But God help you if you get that one bullet.

        Res ipsa loquitur  basically means that if something in your possession hurts another person, and you don't have a good reason for it, you're negligent.   Wilson v. Spencer  summed it up nicely: "Thousands of automobiles are using our streets, but no one expects the air to be filled with flying hubcaps."  And I, for some strange and twisted reason, cracked up at the imagery. Does anyone else find it hilarious?

       I am in the midst of a fundamental shift in my world view. Maybe. Possibly.  You see, I don't want to admit it because that would mean I'm not the rabid conservative I've always pretended to be.  But we all knew that already, didn't we? My "conservatism" springs more from common sense than from any particular ideology... and yet I have embraced the conservative cause, which so often corresponds with the Republican cause.  I'm not sure I want to do that anymore. I am beginning to have serious misgivings about our foreign policy, about the war in Iraq, about our place in the world. I watched Bill Clinton's speech on CSpan yesterday, from the Dean fundraiser out in the fields of Iowa, and I found myself agreeing with him more than I disagreed.  I still disagreed  -- just not as much as I used to. When I saw that most of the things he said made a lot of sense, I cringed despite myself. But I knew a shift was taking place.  I am still a conservative, and still a Republican. But only moderately... and if I ever ran for office, I could probably run as a conservative Democrat. I don't know. This is all very confusing.  I recorded my raw thoughts into a voice recorder the other day, and I urge you to  urlLink listen to the file.  It's about seven minutes, and I sure would like some guidance.

       Our contracts professor admitted he was wrong the other day, while privately explaining a concept to a student. He asked the student to explain the concept to the class.  Student: "The way you explained it to me?" Professor:"No, the way that it  is , as opposed to the way I explained it." Finally, a dose of laughter to counteract the monotony that can be our 9:30 a.m. Contracts class. Our professor is proving to have a sense of humor -- a dry one, yes, but at least it exists!

       Found this great passage in my Contracts book. It's from the French economist Frederic Bastiat, and it describes the awe he feels when contemplating the free market that binds us all:   On entering Paris, which I had come to visit, I said to myself -- Here are a million of human beings who would all die in a short time if provisions of every kind ceased to flow towards this great metropolis. Imagination is baffled when it tries to appreciate the vast multiplicity of commodities which must enter to-morrow through the barriers in order to preserve the inhabitants from falling a prey to the convulsions of famine, rebellion and pillage. And yet all sleep at this moment, and their peaceful slumbers are not disturbed for a single instant by the prospect of such a frightful catastrophe. On the other hand, eighty departments have been labouring to-day, without concern, without any mutual understanding, for the provisioning of Paris. How does each succeeding day bring what is wanted, nothing more, nothing less, to so gigantic a market? What, then, is the ingenious and secret power which governs the astonishing regularity of movements so complicated, a regularity in which everybody has implicit faith, although happiness and life itself are at stake? That power is an  absolute principle,  the principle of freedom in transactions.   F. Bastiat, Economic Sophisms 104-105 (1922)   This man put into words what I've been marveling at for years now.

       Why keep a Web site? Why, when everyone else in the world is posting their daily ramblings online, should I make the effort to do the same? After all, what makes my ramblings any more worthwhile than others'?  Not much. Which is why my ramblings will be a secondary part of this experiment. :-)  This blog is not about me; it's about what I go through on a daily basis. It's about antiquated Latin phrases and English words that don't mean what they should mean. It's about... LAW SCHOOL.  From the millions of pages I read each day, a few choice thoughts or phrases  pop out  at me. They are words that made me stop and think, or chuckle, or often even cry. These are the words that grab my attention during the day, and keep me up at night. They are published in my case books, and said by professors and students in class. They are law school. And that is what I hope to share with you.

       I didn't think I was going to be able to make it. After a week of trying to make good progress on my paper - but failing - I found myself at home last night, with about three pages complete out of a 10-12 page paper. By 6 a.m., those 3 pages were up to 4 pages. The paper was due at 12:55 p.m.  There was no way I could make it. I laid down in bed and thought, Screw it. I'll turn it in late and get my grade docked.  But I knew I couldn't do that. I had to finish this paper NOW. I had faced harder obstacles in the past. What about all the papers I wrote in college? What about the countless 40-hour production weekends at the  urlLink Michigan Review ? What about the front-page stories set to run the next day in the  urlLink Sandusky Register , which were only half-done at 8 p.m. the night before?  Now you see that I could not give up. And while evil will always triumph (because good is dumb), I had to keep going. As they may say in one of the latest shitty incarnations of the Matrix movies:  Agent Smith : Mister Schwaaaartz. You will die today.  Me : No. It is you who will die today. (fighting ensues)  Agent Smith : Your defeat... (kung fu)... is... (flying leaps)... inevitable. Why do you continue to resist?"  Me : Because I  choose  to. (Trinity kisses me) The point is, I won. I chose to keep going, and I finished the damn paper, and it was pretty good, and I drove to school and turned it in at 12:09 p.m. (there's nothing like the jolting CA-CHUNK of a time-stamp machine to remind you that whatever goes on in the Matrix has consequences in the Desert of the Real).  Okay, my laptop battery was dying so I just went to plug in my laptop and as I was bending down to find the outlet behind the bed I somehow got a paper cut on my eye. I think this a signal that I should go to sleep.  .\.\ @

       So I signed up for a match.com account the other day (what the hell), and I was aghast and horrified to read the following in the terms of the agreement:   In the event that you die before the end of your subscription period,  your estate shall be entitled to a refund of that portion of any payment you had made for your subscription which is allocable to the period after your death.  In the event that you become disabled (such that you are unable to use the services of Match.com)  before the end of your subscription period, you shall be entitled to a refund of that portion of any payment you had made for your subscription which is allocable to the period after your disability. (Emphasis supplied)  This was not buried in some fine print in a huge agreement; this was RIGHT OUT FRONT, and you had to read it before clicking "Okay." Does this strike anyone else as a  really bad way  to send people off into the merry world of online dating? "Good luck! Have fun! Wear your seatbelt! And even if you don't, don't worry... your family will be well taken care of."  Let's go through this disclaimer step-by-step and determine exactly how scary it is.  1)  "In the event that [I] die before the end of [my] subscription period..."   Let's get something straight: My subscription period is ONE MONTH. I didn't shell out for the 6 month plan or even for the 3 month plan. No, in my eternal optimism that I would find the love of my life in the next month, I figured one month was all that was needed. So, seeing as that I am only going to be on match.com for a month, I surely don't intend on dying before that time is out. And even if I do, how much consolation is that unused portion of 12 bucks going to be?  2)  "In the event that [I] become disabled (such that [I am] unable to use the services of Match.com)"   On the surface, simple. I break my hands in a freak baking accident? I get a refund. But what exactly counts as "becoming disabled" to the extent that I am "unable" to use match.com? Would mental disabilities count? What if I snap under the law school pressure and forget how to type? Does that count? How about if I get a huge assignment, in effect "disabling" me and causing me to be "unable to use the services"? Yeah. You see how it is.  In conclusion, match.com can go to hell.  PS - I got two dates through match this week alone! :-)

       So, three hours into my Constitutional Law Catch-Up... it turns out reading the text  reeeaallly closely  is a lot of fun! I get so much more out of it, and I enjoy it so much more! The only problem is, they assign us  so damn much  reading in law school, that we have no time to read all our text really closely! We have to read fast, and then only closely examine some parts when we feel we've come to something worth closely examining. But then we're missing so much! And how do we know what's worth examining and what isn't? It all is, dammit -- it all is!  Grrrrr. I want a four point.  Oh, yeah, I guess I should mention a little something about my three month absence.  I was busy.  That's about it, really. A recap: First I had to finish up the first semester by kicking it into overdrive. Then I took my Torts final, and got the flu, and about a week later I wrote my Crim Law take home exam in another stunning all-nighter, and then two days later I took my Contracts exam. Then I went home and crashed for a few days. Hung out with old friends, made amazing new ones. ;-)  Went to the Virgin Islands -- that was fun! Came back. Came back to school. Went to Tucson! Then back to school. Worked hard, worked not so hard, worked hard again, got SICK, headaches and fatigue, got better. Currently trying to pull everything together into a grand vista of knowledge in my head.  Also during the break, about a billion friends got engaged. One friend, in addition to doing this, also got a job as one of President Bush's speechwriters. Go Lee!  And that is all. I am now back and Ready to Rumble (TM to somebody else). Okay, back to reading.  :-)

       Last night I had a dream that I kept coming in late to all my classes because I was at the coffee shop, perfecting my coffee drink. A little more milk, a little more sweetener, just a dab of cream and a pinch of real sugar, a dash of vanilla powder and...  LATE FOR CLASS!  And I didn't know whether to come into class late a few minutes late with coffee in hand, or just skip the whole thing. I think I did both, depending on what class it was.  Also, in my dream, I ran into a professor who had selected me for the judicial externship, and I thanked him... he told me the judge's contact info would be sent out soon... and when I checked my e-mail this morning it was there! Ooooooh, spoooooky........  It's nice to see my family but I wish spring break were over so I could return to my palacial abode in Cleveland  :-)

       I haven't been this happy in a while. After months -- years? -- of false promises,  urlLink match.com  finally came through. It started with a wink from her. A week-long flurry of letters led to a real live date, and finally, FINALLY, there was real chemistry. I like her. A lot. At times I feel intoxicated around her, and I close my eyes and hold her close and just savor the feeling of being there with her. She is beautiful and precious and cute and funny and delightful and delicious and she is my baby.  She is laying in my bed right now, sleeping, and I am looking at her. And I feel fuzzy and warm inside. And it is very nice.

Matt: "That bitch. She hates me. Don't trust a word she says. She's fucking crazy." MBNA: (silence) Matt: "Well, is that it?" MBNA: (looks at her shoes) Matt: "There will never be anything between us?" MBNA: "If you have any additional information..." Matt: "...yes?" MBNA: "...that would allow us to reconsider our decision..." Matt: "You would reconsider?" MBNA: "...please write to us." Matt: "You don't want to talk to me." MBNA: (silence) Matt: "Well you can wait by your fucking mailbox all you want. I'm not writing to you." MBNA: (starts to walk away) Matt: "Wait, baby, wait!" MBNA: (gets in her car) Matt: "I'll write to you! I will!" MBNA: (drives away) Matt: (to himself) "Bitch."

       Bisexual girls love me, because I am the perfect blend of masculine and feminine. At least this is what they tell me. Okay, this is what  she  told me.  It didn't last very long.  Anyway, her theory went like this: She was attracted to both guys and girls, and I was the best of both worlds. I liked to work out, and I could take charge -- yet I was also a choir boy with a love of fine music and nature, and in touch with my feminine side.  This was exemplified tonight when, even after predicting *exactly* what would happen, I still teared up when Rachel left Ross at the airport, and then the tears started  streaming  when she walked into Ross's apartment as he was listening to her answering machine message.  I chalk this up to three things: 1) I started watching the show when it came out hace 10 anos. Though I haven't watched it regularly in years, I did watch it all the time in high school... So it kind of reminds me of my childhood. 2) I am tired and stressed out with finals and school, so I am in a weakened emotional state. 3) Rachel and Monica never actually mud-wrestled together. I was waiting for that for the past DECADE, and I heard a rumor it was going to happen this year, and it DIDN'T happen, and now it will  never  happen.  So I cry. I am not ashamed at my inner woman. Indeed, I think she should help me out more often. Maybe then my house would be clean, and I'd actually have some homecooked meals to dine upon.

       I feel really bad for Darryl, the 13-year-old black kid who was  urlLink brought up on criminal charges  after he finally fought back against bullies who had been picking on him for years. (Can I say "black kid?" or is it rude? Oh well.) Apparently the kids used to hit him, pee on him, call him gay, and so forth.  But what I find interesting is this quote from a news piece about it:  Daryl, who cried at his sentencing hearing Wednesday, says kids at his school are still making fun of him daily even after all that he's been through.  "Most of the time they call me white," said Daryl, who is black. "It's better than what they were calling me before. But I've learned not to deal with them." So apparently "white" is better than "gay." I think I'm happy to hear that? Still, I don't like the fact that "white" is an insult to a black guy. I wouldn't be insulted if somebody called me "black." I guess the spectrum, then, is as follows:  Gay --> White --> Black  Okay. I'm glad we got that straightened out.

       I got a new bed! It is a queen size hunk of 18-inch-deep mattresses (that's JUST the mattress part, not the box spring), and lots and lots of Conforma foam (it cradles me). It is very squishy.... mmm, tired. The problem with getting a new bed during finals period is that all I want to do now is sleep! Well, that's all I wanted to do before too, but now I have more reason to do so. *sigh* I didn't know they would be able to deliver it the next day! I thought I would have to wait a week!  *breathe* Two days. I will be done in two days.  So far finals have gone well. Think I nailed at least 1, and maybe 2 of them. We shall see. Too bad I know *nothing* about Global Perspectives. (Yes, nothing. Literally nothing. What the hell did we do for three months?!!!!!??!!)  After the Global slaughter on Friday, I will have 2+ weeks of R&R before my 6th Circuit appellate court externship begins. That means seven weeks of a daily 1 hour commute, PLUS working my ass off on a daily basis.  Then another month and a half of laying around on my ass. Oh, and getting in shape.  Then school begins again on August 23rd... damn, they don't give us much time, do they?

       I had a recurring dream last night that my bedroom was the CNN.com home page, and my bed was where the main picture would be. And the CNN.com producer kept coming in and moving things around in my room as the stories updated. And he told me to move but I wouldn't, and so the main picture on CNN.com all last night was me sleeping. But I think for drama they put up the caption "Al Qaeda hostage." And of course it was night, so the picture was taken in that green night shot mode.  I woke up, and I *knew* my bedroom wasn't the CNN home page, and yet it just made so much sense. And I thought, maybe my bedroom *is* the CNN home page.  So I was very confused all last night.

       Grades not posted. Dammit. I have to wait until Monday. This sucks for two reasons:  1) I don't like waiting, and 2) this means I have to research and write the law review write-on entry this weekend, on the (quite large) chance that I didn't grade onto law review.  Dammit!  Points of note: Because of regulations at the court, I have started to put two spaces in between sentences.  Despite the fact that this goes against everything I have ever been taught, and everything I have ever done, it is strangely satisfying.  At the same time, I am concerned, because I have railed against the practice in the past.  Should be interesting to see what happens.  Second: Frith and I are cooking dinner tonight. She wanted to get me scallops but, upon doing a Google image search and realizing they look like little sea dumplings, I would have none of it. Disgusting! I told her. She asked if mangoes were okay. I asked her if she was referring to the fruit or to another kind of dumpling fish. It was the fruit, so I gave her the green light.  Third: My new favorite drink is a Crown & Coke -- i.e. 1 part Canadian whiskey, 2 parts Coke, all over ice. It is absolutely delicious, and I am shelling out the big bucks for the first full-priced fifth I have purchased in a long time!  (The last fifth I bought was in the Virgin Islands, but the liquor there is as cheap as the girls on the corner of Cedar and Lee, so that probably doesn't count.)  Fourth: I want to be a writer again. Ideas are slowly accumulating. Latest musing: What would happen if someone decided to hunt down all the federal judges they disagreed with, in an attempt to get more likeminded judges nominated? This idea popped up when I was told that the judge shouldn't be answering the locked office door, for security reasons. Hmmmm.....  Fifth: Now that I think about it, I should have talked about buying a fifth in this sentence. It would have been very poetic. I guess I can talk about how my girlfriend's name is Frith? That works.  That is all -- M@

       They say grades won't be up until June 7, but I tried just now, and the page said:  Check your grades Provider error '80004005'   Unspecified error   /registrar/getGrades.asp, line 93   It always worked before (told me I had no grades posted yet), so I am assuming that they are currently uploading the grades. Does this mean they will be available later today? Oooooh, I'm scared. Nervous. As long as I don't know how I did, I can pretend I am smart. But once I know how I did.....

       From the NY Times, 7/19/2004:  LOS ANGELES -- With his frustration mounting this weekend over his inability to muscle a budget through the Legislature, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger called his Democratic opponents "girlie men" and vowed to work to unseat them in November.

       Be wary of statistics. For a long while now, I have noted with amusement various statistics meant to frighten, cajole and persuade. At first glance, these statistics are frightening, but a dose of cynicism and a little bit of thinking will go a long way.  Sensationalism runs amok at eDiets.com: "Now here's some scary news: Harvard School of Public Health research indicates women who drank at least one sugar-sweetened soda a day were 85 percent more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those who drank less!"  Well, yes, I don't doubt the veracity of the study. Upon cursory glance, it seems quite legitimate â€“ isn't heavy sugar consumption linked to diabetes? Yes and no. People who consume a lot of sugar are generally overweight, and obesity is definitely a cause of diabetes. But simply consuming a lot of sugar will not, in itself, cause diabetes.   Then, it is very likely that "one sugar-sweetened soda a day" will not cause an 85 percent jump in the diabetes rate. One sugar-sweetened soda a day, coupled with an unhealthy diet and lack of exercise, will. This Harvard study found a correlation, not a causation.  Not convinced? Look at this snippet from an  urlLink AP article :   "According to [the] study, the women most prone to gaining weight had increased their consumption of sugary soft drinks from less than one a week to more than one a day. On average, those women gained nine-10 pounds in a four-year period. But women who cut their intake of soft drinks gained an average of three pounds or less."    Honestly, I am not entirely sure what this means. Did the study organizers pick the women most prone to gaining weight and ask them to increase their soda consumption more than seven-fold? In any case, it is clear that there is a very fundamental question here: What caused the increase in diabetes â€“ the increase in sugar consumption or the increase in weight?  In a nod to fair and balanced reporting, the AP quoted a press release from the National Soft Drink Association that responded to the study. The soft drink makers called the study "unconvincing and inconclusive" because it raises questions over "factors that could create inaccuracies." The article stopped there, but a quick skim of the  urlLink press release  provides the needed details:   "It is unknown whether or not this study adjusted for all of the above risk factors for type 2 diabetes or for other risk factors sometimes referred to in the medical literature such as high salt intake, high blood pressure, alcohol intake and high fat intake. If this study were adjusted for all of these confounding factors, it is doubtful it would show any risk for developing type 2 diabetes from soft drink consumption," said Dr. Richard Adamson, vice president for scientific and technical affairs for NSDA.    The moral of the story? It's easy to fall victim to scary statistics. Respond with your mind rather than your fears. Always look at both sides of an issue. And don't believe everything you read.

       We've got lots and lots of updates! Updates......  Sorry I've gone radio silent, but I've been busy with getting over the mono and getting back into the swing of things at work. I am still not fully recovered, though, and I have missed more work than I care to think about. The judge told me she didn't know how I got an A in Legal Writing because my briefs are "far too well-written for most legal writing instructors," so that's good, but I don't know if I'm going to ask to use her as a reference because my work output has been about three times slower than it should be. I really hate to blame everything on the mono, but I have just been so sluggish lately and that's the culprit.  I did pretty damn well in my classes (aside from a rogue B-), and I am in a good position for next year. I applied to transfer to a couple schools in the top 15, but odds are slim, as you can imagine. Even if I got accepted though, I really don't know what I would do. I am content here, and I have built a strong base for myself. But then again, if I worked hard at a Top 10 school and did well, I could be in an even BETTER position...  I am so tired I don't know what else to say, so now it is time to rest.
