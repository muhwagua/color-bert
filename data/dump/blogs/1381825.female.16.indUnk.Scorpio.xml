      Wow, has it really been five days? That's a little scary - I've only had this thing for what, maybe a week and a half (or thereabouts), and I already miss five days? I would bang my head on the table but I already have a headache.  First, I have a vacation update. We did drive up to Virgina and spent the night at a decently scary motel that felt like a prison cell. The only potential plus was that a major cottilion was being held in the basement, so as soon as my dad and I walked in, we gave each other a look and I could tell he was thinking the same thing I was. Free food! Alas, there was none to be found, although we did have major fun making fun of all the geeky looking guys in suits. That was pretty good. So anyway, the next day we wake up and decide that none of us really wants to go to Busch Gardens - which was OK because I really wasn't in a rollercoaster mood - but we had to decide what we wanted to do instead while we were up there. My dad and I were rooting for D.C. because it was only an hour away and we could just drive up, poke around, get a pizza at Pizza Paradisio (the single best pizza on the planet, I kid you not) and drive back home. But my mom wanted to go to Kitty Hawk because we'd never been there before and "everyone says it's wonderful" and she's "always wanted to go there" and somehow in the eight years we've been here she's never managed to tell us this. Sure, that's legitimate. I kept trying to tell her that Kitty Hawk isn't much more than a pile of sand but I just got yelled at for "painting a negative picture of the alternative". So we drive four  very  long hours out of the way to see, you guessed it, a big ol' pile of sand. Woo hoo. Great fun. So then we have to drive almost six hours back home because the freeways are kind of funky, but my dad needs a cup of coffee. So my mom proposes something else - we stop by this cute little town that "she's always wanted to go to". You'd think we'd learn not to trust her by now, but we go. I swear there was not a single non-hick in the entire town, nor was there a decent cup of coffee, and believe me we tried. So we get back in the car, miserable and coffee-less, and schlep the whole way back home. Yeah, I was pissed off. Sunday was fun though. We had a philosophy club meeting and that went really really well. I pretty much just slept the rest of the weekend. Off I go to do homework...

      I have Beatles songs running through my head. Yes, Beatles. Especially "Let It Be". That is a really great song, and I just learned how to play it on the guitar. It's really easy in case anyone out there wants to know - just G, D, Em, C, G, D, C, G. Or something thereabouts. I also have the first run of Sweet Home Alabama parading around in my brain, probably because I just learned how to play that too. It's really fun - dun dun da dun, da dun dun da dun, da dun dun DUN! Life is good. I'm leaving tomorrow afternoon to drive up to somewhere in Virginia. My sister's playing a competition up there with her orchestra, and although I don't actually get to see her, I do get to go to Busch Gardens with them the next day. And yes, Kit, I do wish I could take you with me. I need someone to talk to... Ah, well, nothing to cheer one up like Apollo's Chariot. Front row. Mwa ha ha. Perfection... I'm tired - I think I'll go to bed early. Goodnight!

      I've only had this blog for three days now, and already I almost forgot to update it! Sad, isn't it? So, now that I'm here I need something to write. The only problem is that I don't think I have anything really noteworthy to say, but hey, that's never stopped me before! So, I think I'll just talk about my day some... Have you ever taken a test and thought you totally failed and then you get it back and you do really well on it? That happened to me today in English. God, I love Mitchell. It kind of scares me that one of the easiest to talk to people I know is my English teacher, but I don't care. Anyway, I took the test today and he showed it to me during lunch because I was there to talk to him anyway, and, yes ladies and gentlefins, I got an A. A big, fat, beauchous A. Made me very happy. Then of course I had to go take another test which I totally failed. What goes around comes around, as they say, although I don't think I actually know anyone who says that. Ah well, so it goes.

      I have to share some of these with you guys - they're just too good not to. (Thanks to Joelle for sending them to me.)  Why did the chicken cross the road?  Al Gore : I invented the chicken. I invened the road. Therefore, the chicken crossing the road represented the application of these two different functions of government in a new, reinvented was designed to bring greater services to the American people.  Colin Powel : Now at the left of the screen, you clearly can see the satellite image of the chicken crossing the road.  Pat Buchanan : To steal a job from a decent, hard-working American.  Ernest Hemingway : To die. In the rain. Alone.  Grandpa : In my day, we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road. Someone told us that the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough for us.  I have lots more, but I just don't feel like typing them all right now...you'll just have to trust me, they're very funny.

      I have just been informed by Joelle that apparently when she complains to me about her teachers, I tell her to shut up and stop complaining. Which is completely true. But, given the fact that I am feeling particularly generous, I'm making the same proposition that I made yesterday for Sarah: I will more than happily come in and beat up anyone who bothers you, namely stuffy annoying English teachers with too much hair, capes, and Colin Firth-esque profiles. You know who you are. I love you too, Joelle!

      My poor friend Sarah! Her history teacher went and deserted her and she's been left with a nutty former rugby player! I'm not entirely sure what I would do in her situation. If Mitchell ever goes and deserts me, there will be some major ass kicking going on. Hey, I may be small, but if there's one thing my mother taught me is you can do some serious damage from down here! Ah, the glories of being short...  Anyway, Sarah if you're reading this, WE LOVE YOU! And I want you to know that if whatshisface ever gives you any crap, call me up - I don't care if it's the middle of class - and I will come and have a very serious chat with him. Really, I will. I love you!

      Announcement - I have discovered new and noteworthy music! If you've never heard of him, be sure to check out Jason Mraz. He's got this great song called "Remedy", which, granted, is kind of campy, but is loads of fun all the same. Plus he's really cute. He's one of those cooky cap wearers, but unlike most people who do that kind of thing he looks really really good in them. Am planning on buying his CD as soon as I can scrape up the cash, which I am really short on in case anyone feels generous.  Alright, I really need a cookie. No, I mean really. Chocolate chip would be great, but I'd take just about anything at this point. Hm, where can I get a cookie? I should start a fund - "Cookies for the Needy". Or money. Whichever's more convinient.  As Sally infamously put it in A Charlie Brown Christmas: "All I want is my fair share. What's coming to me. Preferably in tens and twenties."

      Yay! Done with all my exams and the year is officially over! As of about five hours ago (give or take a few minutes) I am no longer a freshman. This makes me exceedingly happy. Ha ha, now I have people shorter and weaker than me to make fun of! Ah, good times ahead, I can tell.  But today was also kind of bittersweet. Although I did have my last two exams today and am officially allowed to forget all my Biology, World Civ, Health, and Drama for the rest of my high school career, it was also the second-to-last day I got to spend with all my seniors and the very last day I got to see Mitchell. Ever. That was hard, although actually not as bad as I thought it would be. He gave me this really wonderful book called "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance." It's very well written and very funny, and I am totally convinced I need a motorcycle now. Well, almost totally. I nearly cried when I read the card he stuck in it. It was just very sweet, and I'll miss him a whole lot. Saying goodbye to the seniors was pretty tough, too - I just love them all so much! I think especially as a "measly little freshie" as Claire would say I have been extremely lucky to have so many upperclassman friends, but now I have to see them all off and I don't want to let them go. If any of them are reading this (and you know who you are) I'll miss you and love you forever! I was very glad I chose to sleep in the extra thirty seconds and not put on mascara this morning because it probably would have been all over my face. Same thing applies for tomorrow's graduation. You know, just in case.  And, on a happy note, I am feeling much better about my family, especially my mom. It's not exactly that her standards have changed or whatever, but more that I think I've learned to just deal with it and try to ignore it. If that's the way she wants to be, fine, I'll just do my own thing and not let her take credit for it. I've definitely gotten over being angry at her, so now the way she acts just amuses me, and that's really all there is to it. I think it's that Zen book that's doing it - thank God for Mitchell, that's all I have to say.  OK, folks, signing off now. Happy summer! Go take a nap outside if you can! It's lovely weather - it hasn't gotten very humid yet...

      Alrighty, three down, four to go! I had Biology and Geometry today. Both of them were EOCs, so pretty easy. Especially Geometry - oh my goodness! So common sense! OK, so there was like one problem that took a minute or two, but other than that, so so easy! Biology wasn't bad either. There were definetly some questions on there that I just had no idea on, but most of it was pretty straightforeward. Tomorrow isn't exactly easy, but it's my easiest of days: English and French. Shouldn't be too bad, but then on Friday I have Drama and World Civ. I've heard too that the World Civ exam is really really hard. EEK! Well, we'll just have to see I guess.   I'm really not happy with my mom right now. First of all, my sister left early this morning to go to a YMCA camp up in Black Mountain with her 7th grade class. I went on the same trip a few years ago and it was really fun and totally safe. And yet, this is the only topic of conversation around her! How worried she is, what could happen to her, asking me for the zillionth time to go over the exact itinerary of the trip for her, etc, etc. I'm going stir-crazy! Plus, she's just a little obsessed with this grades thing. I got in the car this afternoon and she handed me a book that she bought called "A Guide to Taking the SAT II in French". OK, I'm not taking this test for another two years and already she's got me studying for it! AAAAAAGH! She has no perspective. I've always had straight As in everything for as long as I can remember, and to be totally honest, I'm not an idiot! I really don't know what she wants from me. She keeps going on and on about how much harder it is to get into college, now more so than ever, but then she tells me these horror stories about people who stress themselves out in high school by taking all kinds of AP courses and stuff (which, by the way, she's telling me to do) and then being so burned out that they drop out of college. Sometimes I feel like because she didn't get to go to a major university and get an advanced degree that she's trying to live out that life through me. Every time I have an interest in something, she always manages to put in how it was her interest too. It's like I can't have anything of my own! It just makes me really angry because I feel like I'm not a real person, I'm just an extension of her. In fact, she once blatently  told  me that she was glad I was doing major academic stuff because she never got the chance to. Lately I've been feeling more and more that no matter how far away I get from my family they will always be there taking credit for everything I do and trying to live my life for me. My mom has never really aknowledged anything I've done - she just puts in how it was her love too, or look what Chloe did over here! I just feel like total crap. All I want is to just be myself, not something my mother wanted to be and never got the chance to. I want to have interests and passions and friends of my own without having to think about what my mother would have done. But I can't do that, because every time I try to do something she is always there, taking my accomplishments and bending them to fit her standards. If that's asking too much, then I don't know what to do. I just feel very lost.

      Exams are upon us! I took my first one this afternoon while everyone else got to go home and take a nap. Grr. It really wasn't bad - it was Health and she let us bring in a regular-sized piece of paper with whatever we wanted written on it! It was really nice, although I ended up not really having to use it since it was more of an "application" test. Still, it was nice to have handy. I killed my hand though - three full pages front and back. Ouch!  Well, one down, six to go. I've got Biology and Geometry tomorrow (both EOCs so shouldn't be too hard), then English (also an EOC) and French on Thursday, and finishing off with Drama and World Civ on Friday. I'm really worried about my Drama one. Part of the final is an improv activity and I am really  really  terrible at those! I'm very nervous. I hate getting up and talking in front of people, especially when I don't know beforehand what I'm going to be saying. Eek! All the others I'm not really worried about. French I need to study some just because I've forgotten half the vocab, and World Civ I do need to study but I don't really feel like it, so I think I'm pretty much set. I was messing around with the math and I figured out the formulas to calculate what I need to get on my finals to keep my As, and most of them are really quite low. I found out that if my Geometry final were a normal final instead of an EOC, I could get a -1 and still have an A. Yes, really, a negative one! That would mean that I wouldn't even have to show up for the final and would still have an A with a whole point to spare! Unfortunately, that's not really the case since it's an EOC, but hey, it's nice to know, right? Ah, the glories of easy tests and lots of extra credit. I love you, Ms. Soloman!

      It's Sunday the week before final exams and I have yet to do any truly successful studying. I'm actually not too worried - the only one I really need to study for is World Civ and that's my very last one. At midterms I managed to totally stress myself out and I just ended up getting really really sick. And I mean sick; by the time my English exam was over I couldn't see my desk anymore because it was so covered in tissues. It sucked royally. So, in an effort to not stress and because I'm just too restless to study, I have replaced cramming my brain with cramming my mouth. In the past few days I have taken on more baking ventures than I have ever, I think. This included trying a number of new things, pate a choux for one, most of which came out pretty bad but got eaten by my dad anyway. The man is a human garbage disposal, I'm telling you. So, today I'm making two classic staples: chocolate chip cookies and brownies with a chocolate glaze. You can never go wrong with those two.  Have to go watch the oven. Happy studying, for those of you brave enough to do so.

      As cirumstance would have it, I in fact did not see the Matrix today. This would be the second time in four days that I had a ticket - physically had a ticket - and did not get to use it. Oh well. Someone was supposed to try to sell it at the theatre for me, so I'll have to see how it worked out.  The reason I couldn't go, actually, was this: Chloe (my younger sister, for those of you who don't know) really wanted to see it with me. At that point, I figured that the situation was just too complicated - I'd just give my ticket to whatever adult offered to go, and then promised Chloe that we would go see it together. As luck would have it, the adult somehow managed to get a ticket, and I had to sacrifice mine because I'd already made plans with Chloe. Which actually really was OK. Chloe and I got to the theatre and tried to buy tickets (I don't remember how we thought we'd get in without an adult, but it ended up not mattering anyway.). Naturally, they were sold out. So instead of going home, we decided to go see X2 instead. It ended up being a really really great movie and we had a whole lot of fun together. As Jerry Seinfeld infamously put it, "Everything just works out even for me!" Except I still haven't seen the Matrix. I'll get there, never fear.

      Well, I'm supposed to go see the Matrix Reloaded at some point today. Supposed to being the operative words in that sentence. The problem is that the show before ours was already sold out yesterday, so it's pretty safe to assume that ours is sold out as well. This, however, is not the problem. The six of us already have our tickets. The problem is that the movie is rated R and we need an adult to get us in. But, since the show is probably sold out, there isn't a ticket for an adult. Beginning to see the problem here? Hopefully if it doesn't work out we can just sell the tickets, but I don't know exactly what the deal is with doing stuff like that. I don't know, we'll just have to see I guess.  In other news, I finally have a  urlLink website . It's very much under constuction at the moment, but hopefully I can get it up and running decently soon. All I have on there for now are some Monty Python bits, but I want to get loads more stuff on.

      OK, I need a new template - I don't like this one anymore. It bores me. My only problem is that I really don't like any of the other ones and I don't know how to make my own. If there are any HTML junkies out there that are feeling generous, I want to meet you. Tom, did you make your own? I really love it. *Sigh* I guess I'm stuck with this one until something better comes along.  Well, even though I'd already bought a ticket and was actually physically holding it in my hand, I decided not to go to the preview showing of The Matrix Reloaded last night. There were plenty of good reasons, mostly that I didn't know any of the people who were going except for Mitchell, and I felt kind of weird being someplace at one in the morning and the only person there I know is my English teacher. Just a little weird. So I sold my ticket, and actually made a $1.50 profit on it. I was sad to miss it, but to compensate I took an hour-long bubble bath, which pretty much made up for the whole thing. Plus, I figured I'd rather go with people I know and like during normal hours instead of being with strangers at one in the morning.  So, then this morning, Kit and I decided to commit social suicide and teach our health class a Britney Spears dance for our project. I was kind of worried that people were going to come up to us afterwards and strangle us, but it was actually a whole lot of fun, even though I lost my voice and now have a major headache. I think some of the other people had fun, too, actually. The best part of the whole thing was watching these big burly crewers standing in the front of the room (because Ms Edmundson forced them there) trying to dance. Side splitting moment coming, hang on just a sec.... OK, better now. Yeah, so it was pretty funny, and I'm still alive to boot!

      Because it is the SINGLE GREATEST SONG OF ALL TIME! It just makes me happy reading it! For those of you who have been unfortunate enough to have escaped the healing bliss of Monty Python thus far - and if I have anything to do with it that will change - it's from their movie The Meaning of Life, which is really hilarious.  I've been going through this period lately where I've been convinced that the entire universe is composed of completely selfish, immature, insecure idiots except for myself, and this song just makes me happy to be in it. I think this is the first time I've genuinely been sad that no one reads this thing because no one will get to see it. Oh well. If you do see it (whoever you are, and I want to know who you are - email me!) and like it, share the love!   THE GALAXY SONG  Whenever life get you down, Mrs. Brown, And things seem hard or tough. And people are stupid, obnoxious or daft, And you feel that you've had quite enu-hu-hu-huuuuff! Just - re-member that you're standing on a planet that's evolving and revolving at 900 miles an hour, It's orbiting at 19 miles a second, so it's reckoned, the sun that is the source of all our power. The Sun and you and me, and all the stars that we can see, are moving at a million miles a day, In the outer spiral arm, at 40,000 miles an hour, of the Galaxy we call the Milky Way. Our Galaxy itself contains 100 billion stars, it's 100,000 light-years side-to-side, It bulges in the middle, 16,000 light-years thick, but out by us it's just 3000 light-years wide. We're 30,000 light-years from galactic central point, we go round every 200 million years, And our galaxy is only one of millions of billions in this amazing and expanding universe. The universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding, in all of the directions it can whizz, As fast as it can go, at the speed of light you know, twelve million miles a minute, and that's the fastest speed there is. So remember, when you're feeling very small and insecure, how amazingly unlikely is your birth, And pray that there's intelligent life somewhere up in space, because there's bugger all down here on Earth.

      I need e-mail! I went through this really long phase where I was getting tons of e-mails and my inbox was all full and happy, and now I've got nothing! What is the deal?!?

      TGIF has never been more true. This has been the single LONGEST WEEK IN HISTORY! Oh, my god, it never seemed to end! It just kept going and going and going and going and even then it kept going! But now it's over! Said and done with! Finito! It's left its body and joined the choir invisible! If it were burried it'd be pushing up the daisies! It is no more! It is an ex-week! Not that it's been particularly bad, just freakishly long. Acutally, I take that back - it's not been great. I'm having a total mental breakdown. You know when you shake a soda bottle for a really long time and then you open it and it spews all over the place? Yeah, that's kind of what's going on in my head right about now. For the past two months or so I've had all this tension building up from my family and school and friends and all kinds of stuff, but I never really let myself think through it or be sad about it. It's just been sitting in the back of my brain, all shook up but not opened yet. Then, something happened this week - I don't even really know what it was - that just made me explode, and all of a sudden I've got this huge depression thing settling over my head. I've been tired and irritable and just generally sad. I've had all these really bizzare dreams, most of them that I'm either dying or in the hospital, and every time I try to think I randomly want to just break down and cry. And it happens in the middle of the night, too! It's really starting to drive me crazy. I know that as soon as I get all my thoughts sorted out I'll be totally fine, but until I do life kind of sucks. I know it's not just one thing that's making me sad, although everyone seems to think I'm just miserabe because Mitchell's leaving (I've known for almost a month now, folks!). That does make me sad, but that's definetly not the only thing bugging me right now. Ah, well, I'll get it all figured out eventually. Summer is just a few weeks away! ~ I don't know who actually reads this thing (for all I know I just write to myself), but if someone did just read through that whole thing and is suddenly worried about me, don't be. I'm not depressed or anything. I'm just kind of crazy is all.

      Good gracious, I don't even want to think about how long it's been since I wrote. Between sickness and being really busy I just haven't gotten around to it in a while.  So, update. First, I got sick. Really, really sick. I was in bed for almost six days straight! We never actually managed to figure out what it was, but my dad and I both had it pretty bad. Naturally, as soon as we got sick, my mom jumped on the computer to look up symptoms for SARS and spent the entire two weeks I was sick drilling me on symptoms. I swear that after being asked a bazillion times whether you have a "dry hacking cough" you start to develop one just to shut her up for a few minutes. I ended up being sick through my entire four day weekend and then missing two more days of school. OK, this was just unbelievable to me - tell me what you think. On Monday, I still hadn't been out of bed for about five days, but I got up to drag myself in to get makeup work and talk to teachers about makeup tests and stuff. Some of them were really sweet - Mitchell and Ms. Soloman in particular. But then I walk into the teachers lounge to talk to Mitchell and Olenchuk is sitting in a chair towards the back. He looks at me and says "Well, look who decided to show up today!" Try to imagine my state for a minute, if you will: I was really really sick, coughing and sneezing my brains out with a fever on top of that. I'm also in my big huge sweatshirt and scrubs and I'd just woken up. I looked pretty darn miserable if I do say so myself. So he comes in and is just a total ass to me. I was just standing there like, "I swear, if I wasn't about to fall over, I would walk over there and kick you. Hard." Ms. Edmundson was also really bitchy to me. She gave me extra work to do. That's right - extra ! Do you do that to someone when they're sick? No! By the time I'd gotten back in the car and was driving away I was so exhausted that I started to cry. I was just so tired and so sick... I am so glad I'm better. I do have more things that happened, but remembering all this is making me angry, and besides I have an entire essay to write today. Toodles.

      I just got back from the world's most amazing concert. My guitar teacher, Ed Stephenson (who's my idol anyway) and his band had an outdoor concert at Pullen Art Center. There are no words to describe how absolutely amazing it was. He is so incredibly talented; oh my god, I was totally blown away. And especially knowing how hard it is to do some of the stuff he was doing. Wow. He was doing all this complicated stuff all the way up and down the fingerboard so fast you almost couldn't hear it and he still kept perfect form and balance. And he's so charismatic - he kept looking out into the audience and smiling and talking to people. He's just too cool. I love him so much. If he performs again soon, I am definitely dragging a whole bunch of people there to see him. This was arguably the most fun evening I've had in a long time. Ed - I love you, man!

       More Hannah wisdom:    How To Keep A Healthy Level Of Insanity   1. At lunch time, sit in your parked car with sunglasses on and point a hair dryer at passing cars. See if they slow down. 2. Page yourself over the intercom. Don't disguise your voice. 3. Every time someone asks you to do something, ask if they want fries with that.  4. Put your garbage can on your desk and label it, In.  5. Put decaf in the coffee maker for 3 weeks. Once everyone has gotten over their caffeine addictions, switch to espresso. 6. In the memo field of all your checks write, "for sexual favors.”  7. Finish all your sentences with "in accordance with the prophecy."  8. Don't use any punctuation marks.  9. As often as possible, skip rather than walk.  10. Ask people what sex they are. Laugh hysterically after they answer.  11. Specify that your drive-through order is "to go.” 12. Sing along at the opera.  13. Go to a poetry recital and ask why the poems don't rhyme.  14. Put mosquito netting around your work area. Play a tape of jungle sounds all day.  15. Five days in advance, tell your friends you can't attend their party because you're not in the mood.  16. Have your co-workers address you by a wrestling name.  17. When the money comes out the ATM, scream "I won! I won! Third time this week!!!!!" 18. When leaving the zoo, start running towards the parking lot, yelling "run for your lives, they're loose!!"  19.

      I know it's a few days late for a proper response, but I still feel like some responding needs to be done to the recent Supreme Court decision about Affirmative Action in college and graduate school admissions, even from a normally not-so-politically active person like myself. Generally, I tend to consider myself a liberal, although in truth I am much more of a moderate and don't really belong faithfully to either political party. For example, I am conviced that medicare isn't going to work, but at the same time I support abortion rights for women. However, I firmly and angrily disagree with the Supreme Court decision earlier this week. It was a very weak and indecisive move on their part. I suppose I am more than slightly biased on this issue, namely because I am a white, upper economic-status student soon to be applying to college, but even so I am very inclined to be firmly against Affirmative Action, especially in this arena. I can more than understand the incentive for having a diverse campus - I am not saying that there are not many cultural advantages to that and I support the universities' objective in attaining one. However, this "diverse campus" should not be formed if it means the clear violation of deciding who truly deserves to get into a school. The system at the University of Michigan was exceedingly unfair and I am glad that it was abolished by the Supreme Court. This is not to say, though, that I then agree with what the Court decided. Using race as a  primary  factor in deciding who gets into a medical or law school is just as bad, if not worse in many ways, than the aforementioned case. Think about it: if you go to a doctor or a lawyer and you discover that he or she is black, or Indian, or any other minority, you will be inclined to wonder whether this person got into medical or law school, and possibly indeed into their practice, simply because they were a minority and not because they posessed any exceptional intelligence. I don't know about you, but under the current system I would probably assume that they had gotten by because of their race and not because of their personal merits. I would therefore not trust them and probably not go back to them for assistance. Until the system is completely fair and accepts or denies people from higher education based on their own intelligence and willpower and not on their race, people will never feel comfortable going to a doctor or lawyer belonging to a minority. So this "Affirmative Action" instituted by the Court is in fact working against the minorities. Let alone whether or not it complies with the Constitution; it is damaging the very people it is trying to help.  Despite all this argument, I do actually believe that an economic status-type quality should be taken into account when considering a person for college admissions. If, for example, you have a white, upper-class kid who's always been given the best of everything and despite slacking off a little gets a high B average as compared to a very lower-class black kid who has struggled his entire life and worked very hard for that same high B average, I think the lower-class black kid should be given the advantage, simply because he worked harder for the same results. But looking back at what I just said, it is really more of an economic issue than a race issue. This becomes increasingly true as the middle-class African-American population continues to rise. I am aware that this system also works against me as an individual, but I feel that it may be a much more fair way to run the system. Granted, there will be exceptions, but no matter the system there will always be some exceptions and I honestly feel that this may be the safest way to go.

      Harry Potter came out yesterday and despite the fact that I didn't get it until almost afternoon and I stopped to take a break and watch a movie, I finished it before midnight last night. It was so wonderful. The cool thing about the books is that whenever a new one comes out, I always seem to be almost exactly his age, if not right on the dot. It's like growing up with someone and watching them mature as you do and going through some of the same things (metaphorically, of course) as you are. I cried at the end. Unfortunately for me and for you, I can't tell you why because that would be spilling and that's just not cool. If you haven't read the series yet, you really should. I know I'm a dork, but I don't care. They are really  really   good.

      I have a perfectly legitimate reason why I haven't posted in like a week. (OK, so it's closer to like ten days. Big deal.) I've been feeling very introspective lately, and actually I haven't done much talking to anyone. Every once in a while I feel like I really need those few days to just kind of be alone and completely gather all my thoughts. I also end up reading a good deal and learning how to do new stuff. Case in point - I taught myself how to embroider. My grandparents' golden anniversary is this summer so our whole family is making a giant quilt for them and we're each doing one square. It's supposed to be something personal about them or our relationship with them... you get the gist. Anyway, my dad didn't have time to do his either so I ended up making two. Considering the fact that I learned how to do it the hard way, namely just by guess and check, they both came out really well. The first one I did, mine, had the words of a toast my grandpa gave once stitched on: "Two things get better with age: fine wines and Judy" in really pretty calligraphy and then in the middle there was a wine goblet with some grape vines entwined all the way around the square. The other one, my dad's, had a chain of mountains in the background with a road going off into the distance and their old car was on it, heading towards the mountains. Off to the side there was an old road sign and some desert flowers. All embroidered. Given that I was almost blind by the time I finished they looked really really good, and I was quite proud of them. Unfortunately, no one gets to see them because they're already in the mail back to California. Oh well. I have decided to stick with the embroidery though. My mom got me a book so I can learn how to do it the real way, and already it's been really helpful. She also got a book that has a bunch of alphabets in really pretty styles so I can do monograms on handkerchiefs and things. I've tried some of them and they're coming out pretty well. Since I've had nothing to read lately (I've finished everything I've got and Harry Potter doesn't come out till tomorrow) I've been working on that a lot. My dad thinks I'm crazy that I sit on my bed with my cats and take three hours to make a letter on a piece of fabric, but hey, it's actually kind of fun.  And talking of which, HARRY POTTER COMES OUT TONIGHT!!!! When the last book came out I forced my dad into taking me to one of those midnight openings. That was, well, let's just say it was an experience. One that I don't really want to repeat. So I'm just going to go ge it early Saturday morning. I've made sure that I've got absolutely nothing going on that day so that all I have to do is just read. I can't wait!  I have a new motto. I saw this really funny comedian on Comedy Central the other day and he was rambling on about depression and people with low self-esteem when he said this:  "I don't get people who say they have 'low self-esteem.' You don't need to love yourself - you just need to hate a lot of other people and grade yourself on a curve. Like I might suck but I don't suck as bad as Hitler."  This is my new way of looking at the world, and I'll tell you, it's actually really uplifting!

      Good gracious me, it has been far too long since I last posted. There are numerous excuses as to why I didn't have the time to do so, including oversleeping, partying, and just not having the energy, but I won't go too much into those because I just don't feel like it. Life has been really good to me the last few days. I've gotten tons of sleep (probably more than is really healthy), went out with some friends which was a  lot  of fun, went out to lunch with my mom as kind of a you-made-it-through-the-first-year-of-high-school celebration thing which also turned out to be a lot of fun, and then just relaxing and reading quite a bit. I'm more than halfway through the Zen book, and I managed to simultaneously start and finish Catcher in the Rye. I've decided that this summer I'm going to read all those books that people just assume you've read but that I never actually did, like Ender's Game and Lord of the Flies, things like that. So I read Catcher in the Rye and I ended up liking it quite a lot. The style was such that I really felt like Holden was talking to me. The story was kind of depressing (naturally) but nevertheless I enjoyed reading it. If you haven't, I would definitely recommend it. It's a good summer read, I think. I also absolutely adore my other book, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. It's absolutely brilliant, the way he combines philosophy and the normal story... I just love it.  My plans for today: pretty much the same as every other day - nothing! I'm very excited. I've already woken up, which is by far the hardest part of my day, so now I get to go back to bed and read. I love my life.

      It's the day before I leave on vacation, and as usual, my mom is on the rampage. Cleaning, laundry, packing - I've done it all so technically I should be off the hook but somehow I still manage to get yelled at. My dad and I call my mom's overstressing PTS: pre-travel syndrome. Which I think is a pretty appropriote name. Anyway, I got myself all packed early this morning in about 20 minutes total, but my mom started yesterday afternoon and still isn't done. How something can take me 20 minutes and her 24 hours is mind boggling. It's not like it's that hard - is it?  I really don't like traveling with my family. My mom's always that annoying woman who keeps pestering her kids, asking in the middle of the airport way too loudly if the kid remembered to pack sunblock. It's not even that she's embarassing because I don't really care all that much, but it just gets really old really fast. My dad's ok, he's very low stress almost all the time. My sister pokes and prods me to play cards with her on the plane when all I want to do is just sleep. Again, real old real fast. I can't wait until today and tomorrow are both over. I'll be at my grandparents' house, and the routine when we get there is always the same: we eat lunch and rest for the remainder of the afternoon and my aunt Janis and Uncle Daniel (the two coolest people in my family, by far) come over for dinner and we always almost fall asleep at the table because they eat dinner really late and we haven't adjusted to the time change yet. Then we go to bed and the cat, Clarabell, comes and sleep on my stomach. She only does that the first night we're there; the rest of the nights she prowls around. I'm looking forward to seeing (some of) my family. It should be (decently) fun. I kid - I am looking forward to going.  The plumber's here. As usual, the day before we leave, we have some major plumbing problem, which only adds to the stress. Hopefully it's not too bad.   As this will probably be my last post until I get back, I wish everyone a pleasant next ten days or so. Bye!

      YAY! I got my schedule today and I am really happy! Granted, I don't know who half my teachers are, but hey, I know I've got some really good ones. And the list is... (drumroll please)  1st: AG English II - it doesn't say who the teacher is, it just says "English" which either means that's actually the teacher's last name (which would be awful) or they still haven't hired someone yet (which would be funny). Hm. 2nd: AP Environmental Science w/ Nelson - don't know who the teacher is but Kit's in my class which makes me so happy! I was really worried that all the big junior kids would sit on me and be really mean to me but now I have my very own junior bodyguard. I love you, Kit! 3rd: French IV w/ Mme. Poirier - my last year with her, ever! There is a god, I knew it! 4th: Enr. Chemistry w/ Mr. Grunden - yay! 5th. GoPo w/ Mrs. Newmark - even more yay! 6th: Adv. Alg. II w/ Scicinska - I have no idea how to say that name, and I'm not even going to try.  Hee hee, I'm so happy! This year will be a lot of "lasts" for me: last year with Mme. Poirier, last year taking a science in high school, last year as an underclassman... I think that's it. There are probably more, but I just can't concentrate on them right now because I'm so happy. And hyped on cafe lattes and Johnny Depp. That helps.  (Due to technical difficulties, I'm having problems putting this amazing picture on the site. Don't know why, just am. Do yourself a favor and  urlLink go look at it . Trust me. Nothing better than a little "slovenly pleasure." Hee hee...)

      Am extremely depressed. Last night I found a website that had the top 345 colleges/universities in the country and for each one had student opinions of the academics, social scenes, and campus. I looked at a whole bunch, including most of the schools I had formerly kind of wanted to look into (and probably could have gotten into) and found out that they are really not what I want in a school. I did find two unversities that are  absolutely, 100% perfect in every way, shape, and form  and I was completely thrilled. Until I came back down to earth and realized that they are Stanford and Brown. Yeah, just a little on the impossible side. Major bubble bursting moment. *sigh* Is there nothing for me out there?

      Bleepity bleep bleep bleep. Bleeeeeeeeeep.  Yup. Here's the deal: up until a few days ago I had AOL dialup. Which sucked because 1) it was AOL, and 2) it was dialup. So a few days ago we finally got Earthlink cable. Yay! But (and this is the big but) we have Windows 98, which as it turns out, isn't so hot with the cable connection. So for the time being, we had both cable and dialup, because our address books and what not were still on AOL and we were in the process of moving them over. So one day we tried to get on the cable, but it wouldn't let us - it just wanted to do dialup. I was like, what the bleep?! and called the Earthlink tech support. I was on hold for about half an hour when the guy finally picked up and he said, "Yup, that'll happen with Windows 98 because it doesn't like having the two connections at once. But if you just get rid of everything AOL on your computer you should be fine." OK, big deal. I moved all our address books and favorites over in an hour or two, and then I purged the system completely of AOL. I even went in the back door and got rid of  absolutely everything , just be sure. After I finished, I got back on the cable connection. It wouldn't connect. (Insert very loud explitive here.) I called the Earthlink people again and was on hold for a bleeping hour and a half before the guy picked up. I talked to him for a half hour and he had me doing all kind of weird things to my computer, some of which I think permanently bleeped it up, but at the end he was like, "Uh, sorry, I don't know what the problem is. I'm gonna redirect you to a tech specialist."  (Side note: if you have to redirect me to a tech specialist, what the bleep are you?!)  So he redirects me and I wait on hold for another bleeping hour and a half before the next guy picks up, and he bleeps with my computer some more and tells me that he can't figure out what it is either so he'll have another tech specialist call me.  (Again, what the bleep are you if you aren't a tech specialist?!)  He pretty much told me that I couldn't leave my house for another 24 to 48 hours in case this guy calls. At this point it's really late at night and I haven't done any of my homework, nor have I studied for my GoPo test or the APES quiz on basic chemistry that I hadn't learned yet, and I was upset. Understandably so, yeah? So I told my mom everything that happened and she was just like, "Bleep the whole thing, I'll call those bleep-faces tomorrow and straighten it all out." So I went to bed. Not that I got any sleep; I kept having all these really weird and vivid dreams.  So anyway, I had the quiz and the test today, neither of which was overly terrible but the whole situation (not being on any sleep for starters) just made the whole thing worse. That kind of sucked.  In good news, though, we do have the cable connection back. Yay! My mom did call those bleepers today and she got a really nice guy and he pretty much fixed it, which was more than all those other stupid people could do. So now I'm all back up.  I have a massive headache. I'm going to take a nap. Goodnight.

      Today was a day to think carefully about so many things.  Why would anyone ever want to do something damaging or hurting to anyone else? Why are people allowed to get away with so many wrong and terrible things? But more importantly, why would anyone want to do these things in the first place? It makes me sad that people must lose their positions in life or have something catastrophic happen to them to make them reach this simple conclusion.  I don't understand.  And every time I think about it I want to fall down and cry. Why does anyone intentionally subject a fellow human being to such intense discomfort? Why must a woman always feel like she is being looked upon as property, as something not to be respected but taken? And why do we tolerate it?  But then today was also a day to fight against it. As women, some of us came together today in a way that finally made me proud to be a woman.   To all of you who helped, thank you. I love you all.

      Have been in a little bit of a funk all day. Not sure why, just one of those things.   Carrie had her baby! (Carrie was my babysitter when I lived in Minnesota and she recently got married and still lives up there.) It's a girl! Morgan Ann Manguson. How very pretty... I'm a surrogate aunt.  Another reason to be happy: the Squonk magazine may actually be decent this year. Why? Because I'm in charge. Not actually the editor (I don't think anyway...) but that's really just a figurehead. I'm doing all the major work. Which is good and makes me happy.  Myer is a car salesman. Which explains a lot.  And I really miss Mitchell. I was thinking about him last night and I realized that I really miss having someone to really talk to. I really hope I meet another guy like him, except a little closer to my own age, thank you.  Fritjof Capra is my new hero.

      I had a pretty shitty day today. Among other things, I was spilled on three separate times. First I was walking down the hall drinking my water and someone bumped into me and it spilled all down my front. Then at lunch, some asshole spilled milk all down the side of my leg so by the time it dried I smelled like rotten milk. Then I got caught in a torrential downpour and as I was trying to get back in the door someone dumped a can of coke on my head and it got all over my clothes too. And not only all that, but I managed to find out that one of my friends (actually, more like an entire group of them) don't give a damn about me whatsoever. I'm rather distressed at the moment. Distressed, and very tired.

      OK, so I haven't updated in a few days. I know. But school just started and I have been rather busy getting back on a good schedule and evening appointments and such. Therefore, I won't go into my normally long-winded pointless self-centered description of all things me (you're devastated, I know...) but will sum things up in a very un-Hannah-like manner. Mr Myer (English) is weird, but I'm trying to give him the benefit of the doubt before I release all hell on his ass. I'll give him a week. APES is by far the coolest class ever (!), French sucks by definition, Mr Grunden is my new hero (he's so cool!), GoPo should be lots of fun, and Ms Scicinska is so cool! So British, and so cool! I love her.  Anyway, that's rather it for the moment. Not much homework yet, but it's only the third day so I guess they're just getting warmed up. We'll see, I suppose.

      I am taking the time to relish my last few hours of summer before tomorrow we go back to the ol' grind. I think I'm going to have to go into education just so I can get this summer time off. Isn't it nice? So calm and sleepy... I do love summer. Granted I am excited about seeing friends again and some of my classes and teachers look like fun, but it's just that I'm still tired. I don't feel like I've totally recovered yet. Although I will admit, if I was to take the time to fully "recover" by my definition, it would take a lifetime. Ah well. I'm well rested enough, I suppose.  My boys have been acting so silly lately. Izzy (that's the orange one, for those of you who don't know my cats) was playing with the DVD player earlier tonight. He got spooked every time we opened or closed the machine, and he did this really elegant jump about three feet up in the air the first time we opened it. It was so cute! I love my babies so much.  Have a last pleasant summer nap, and enjoy the next few hours of freedom. Ta!

      Well folks,  urlLink the pictures are in . Unless they're just rehersing in all the pictures (which doesn't seem to make much sense) the new Harry Potter movie will feature the kids wearing normal Muggle clothes. A tragedy indeed. The upside: OH MY GOD, DANIEL RADCLIFFE LOOKS REALLY GOOD! That picture where he's holding Emma Watson, yeah, I got kinda jealous. Sad, I know. Hopefully this new director won't butcher the whole movie, and maybe if he's a really good guy he'll loan me Daniel and Rupert for the weekend (he aint bad looking either). We'll see.

      Oh, and I also wanted to mention that the thing I posted on Monday, the lyrics, are not (unfortunately) of my own creation, in case anyone was confused. They are some of the words from a Jason Mraz song called "On Love, In Sadness," one of my favorites. Just wanted to say that in case anyone mistook my genius for his...

      I know, I know, it's been almost a week. And no, I haven't been on vacation or have any other legitimate excuse. I've just been sleeping and reading and generally recovering from an overall pretty bad vacation. Here are the big details: we got to my grandparents' house in Los Altos on Thursday, they had their anniversary party on Saturday (same day I got sick) which was pretty fun, drove up with my uncle Daniel and my family to Santa Cruz and got checked out by my first blond on a skateboard (scary), didn't go kayaking for numerous reasons, including because I was vomiting my brains out at the time, flew up to Portland, Oregon on Tuesday, stayed at my parents' friend's Laura's house (she's really cool), was still sick, got everyone else sick, had a few cool experiences, and came back home on a red-eye flight at one in the morning. There were some really cool things that happened in Portland, but I can't write about them because I tried to once and the story totally lost its charm. You'll have to ask me in person. Not on IM, in person. And just to jog my memory, here are the things to ask for: 1. The Corky waiter (you have to ask for this one! It's so good!) 2. Mt Hood 3. Blonds on skateboards (although that was in Santa Cruz) 4. Jews with big noses 5. "Coffee" 6. Powell's Books 7. Jake and Clancey That should do it, I can't think of anything else. All in all, it was an OK trip; it was nice to have a change in scenery for a while, though I was happy to come home and sleep in my own bed and be with my kitties. There's no place like home.  Oh, and in other news, I finally saw Pirates last night and I LOVED IT!! Oh my god, it was so funny! Sarah and I were laughing out loud for about 20 minutes after the movie was over. It was great! Jack Sparrow is all mine, I don't care what you say Kit. Mine!  Happy last few days of summer. Enjoy them while they last...

      Oh, love, it's a brittle madness I sing about it in all my sadness Not falsified to say that I found God so, Inevitably, well, it still exists Pale and fine I can't dismiss it I won't resist, and if I die Well at least I tried  And we just lay awake in lust And rust in the rain, and pour over everything we say we'd trust Well it happened again I listen in through hallways and thin doors Where the rivers unwind, rust and the rain endure The rust and the rain so thin That I'm in like Flynn again.

      15 and a half hours. The most wonderful 15 and a half hours I can remember for a long, long time. Yes, my friends, I just woke up from 15 and a half hours of sleep. There is only one word to sum up how I feel at the moment: yumdelicious. Aahhhhh, feels good.  Still too tired to talk about trip things. Be patient. I'm going back to bed.

      Just got back from my red-eye flight from Portland earlier this morning and have been snoozing and resting up all day. I was sick for the entire trip except two days, and all the days I was sick (including today) I have not managed to get more than 30 consecutive minutes of sleep. And since I haven't been able to actually fall asleep today, it's been nearly 48 hours I've gone without sleep almost completely. I'm pooped. Have lots of stories, but more on the trip later. I'm too tired and too sick now. Hugs and kisses all around - I missed all of you.  Later...

      Yesterday was my dad's birthday, but since he was in New York, we're celebrating tonight. I'm making a dessert that I've never heard of, but people tell me it's good stuff. It's called a Boston Cream Pie. Basically it's a white cake that you split in half and fill with a homemade vanilla custard. Then, after that cools, your pour a chocolate glaze over the whole thing. So far I've got the cake and the custard, and they're resting in the fridge before I make the glaze. It's a bit messy (the top layer of my cake was being fussy and not wanting to stay together) but I figure if all else fails we can just mush the whole thing together and eat it with a big spoon. Should be pretty tasty... and I get to see my daddy. Being with my dad, eating my cake, and listening to my new CD - how much better does it get, right? A little better - I wouldn't have any homework to do... Oh well. Can't ask for everything I suppose.

      And I bought Chris Thile's album "Not All Who Wander Are Lost." Oh. Words escape me. It is so beautiful. No, beautiful is not strong enough a word. Magnificent, splendid, wonderful, incredible, magnanimous, unbelievably and unbearably gorgeous. Magical. Wow, it's amazing. I think my two favorite songs so far are "Song for a Young Queen" and "Raining at Sunset," although "Riddles In The Dark" and "Sinai to Cannan, Part II" are both wonderful too. Oh who am I kidding, the whole thing is incredible.  This music has a way of just making me so happy. Mmm, so pretty.

      Food for thought.   The Friend   There are lots and lots of people who are always asking things, Like Dates and Pounds-and-ounces and the names of funny Kings, And the answer’s either Sixpence or A Hundred Inches Long, And I know they’ll think me silly if I get the answer wrong.  So Pooh and I go whispering, and Pooh looks very bright, And says, “Well,  I  say sixpence, but I don’t suppose I’m right.” And then it doesn’t matter what the answer ought to be, ‘Cos if he’s right, I’m Right, and if he’s wrong, it isn’t Me.    - A.

      I have noticed a trend in my blogging over the past day or two. (Scroll down and take a gander if you haven't yet. Silly person, not reading my blog. Harumph.) Anyway, there have been three principal men in my lives over the past couple days: John Hannah, Chris Thile, and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. John Hannah is Scotish, Jonathan Rhys Meyers is Irish, and Chris Thile plays new bluegrassy music, which decends from old Celtic music. I think my inner-Hannah is trying to tell me something. Sssshhh, maybe we can hear it...   Go to the UK... go to the UK... go to the UK...   Hmm.

It's such a refreshing movie. So sweet, so romantic, and so uplifting. I get goosebumps at the end every time. This is why I need to go to England: to get me a nice, pretty, non-smoking, non-drinking, wholesome boy. If one exists, that is. Cambridge University has great programs for abroad people... I won't get in and even if I do I won't be able to go, but you can bet I'm applying anyway. Sigh.

       urlLink Nate  has officially made me angry today. This is what he said:   Hannah, for instance, despised the movie [Moulin Rouge], and very vocally at that. It later came out that she came in about half way through. (Or something.) So when she finally saw the whole thing with Mr. Mitchell, she apparently decided that it was ok.   First of all, no. I had seen the movie before, just in very awful circumstances (I was in a prison cell hotel room in Boone, I was sick, and it was awful outside). I did see the whole thing when Mitchell loaned me his copy, and after seeing it, I decided that I understood the movie but still thought it was stupid. And I hold to that. No, you can't make me watch it again. Twice was more than plenty, thank you. (And why it got nominated for all those acting Academy Awards I will never know. Special effects, sure, but acting? And there were actually some good movies that year, too!)  So then he goes on to say:   Well, that's my rant of the day. I'd love to see it on the big screen, and for that reason really want to see it in film club. But it is not to be; I don't think enough people are willing to see it. I'd have to campaign or something.   Sweetie, there's a reason for that!

In the morning I had the "Building as Text" thing, which was stupid, but I had Gloria and Dr Busonik was pretty cool. Gloria and I basically spent the whole time talking and goofing around. (She actually knows who Nickel Creek is! Yay!) Then in the afternoon I had Great Disasters, which was very OK, except for I had Mrs Scicinska and she just makes everything cool. I love her - she's so cute! We made bridges out of popsicle sticks and Elmer's glue. Not too bad.  But it's really and truly Friday!

       urlLink Wow . I am really glad I'm at RCHS and not an overly normal high school.  Last day of the long weekend, and I'm making bread. Breadmaking is one of those things that just baffles me. How just me, a bowl, a wooden spoon, and basically flour and yeast can come together to create this living, breathing thing is incredible. Making it is such an intuitive exercise - you have to be concious of how dense the flour is, how much moisture is in the air, but at the same time you have to be totally unconcious of it. It's an art, it really is. And I love it.

      OK kids, here's the deal. We kind of got the computer to start working again, except not really. I was doing my GoPo homework last night, and just as I was finishing and getting ready to print, it crashed on me and I had to do the whole thing over. I was far from pleased. But for the moment, it seems to be working and I am taking advantage of the situation and posting.   Guitar performance tonight. Am very nervous. I've never had to perform before and I am really not excited at the prospect. I always freeze up; something I can play perfectly on my own I always seem to screw up when my parents or even my teacher are watching. It's bad. Wish me luck - I'll really need it.

It's been all together way too long.   GoPo and Chem tests today. Chem went well, I think. Pretty easy. I thought the GoPo was alright, but the last time I said that about one of her tests I bombed it. I'm trying not to get too excited at this point.   Went as a skunk at school today. Got lots of candy and no one thought I was a cat. I was rather pleased.   Braces come off tomorrow.     Elliott Smith rocks my discman.

      Today should have been up there with the worst days in history, but it really wasn't bad at all. I was quite impressed.   English was bad, surprise surprise, but not as bad as usual, even considering the fact that it was twice as long. I think it was mostly because Myer didn't get to talk very much. That was a definite plus.   In French, we just watched a movie. Last year our class watched the first one in the series, "My Father's Glory." (Subtitles! Yay!) Today we watched "My Mother's Castle" - same plot, same awful acting. The highlight was when Mme Poirier had to leave the room for a while and there were all these really dirty double ententres that everyone picked up. Brad had to get up and rewind the tape so we could all listen to it again. We were laughing so hard. I hope we didn't scare Ms Greenwalt's class next door...  GoPo presentations today. I was nervous, but it seemed to go pretty well. Everyone else did a good job too - yay for everybody! I'm so happy I don't have to do Lieberman research anymore, although it means my inbox will be considerably less full every day. I'll cope.   Guitar went well too. I think I may have to perform next Thursday though. Crap. I don't have any pieces that I really like, except for the page of Classical Gas I found online, which doesn't really count. Drat. My goal is to be able to play that song just like Clapton does by the end of high school. I think it's a pretty easy goal, considering I can basically sight-read the whole thing so far. I would so love to be able to play that song... it's so pretty and, dare I say, sexy? It really is. Just listen to it. Not that version they sometimes play on the radio with the full band playing in the background. That one's nasty. You can't hear the guitar! Get the version that Eric Clapton plays. It's so so gorgeous.   But somehow, despite my day not being nearly as bad as I anticipated, I'm still in a rut. I'm still kind of angry at the world for no good reason. I think I may just be sleep deprived. Hopefully I'll be able to fix that this weekend. Mmm, sleep...

      Went to the ophthalmologist today. I have to get prescription reading glasses for my stigmatism, which is good because it means I won't have migraines as often as I do, but bad because, well, they're glasses. It also sucks because for insurance reasons I can't get them until November 1st, which means I still have at least 10 more days of achy eyes. Ouch.   Got some good news today. My braces come off the morning of picture day. Talk about good timing.   I don't want to go to school tomorrow. I honestly don't know if I can handle an hour and a half of Myer, followed directly by an hour and a half of French. Maybe Poirier won't be there again... that would be nice.   I've been in such a rut lately. I haven't been feeling all that well, and I'm just generally exhausted and depressed.   I need another vacation.

      It's been a while, so I figure it's time for an update.  - First, just to get it out of my system, neither of the teams I was hoping for are playing in the World Series. Drat. The good thing is now I don't have to waste my time watching any more games. - I went to D.C. over the break and had lots of fun. We met my aunt and uncle who flew out from California there and after spending a few days in the city we took them back home with us and spent a few days here. I'm exhausted, but happy. I love them - they're probably my two favorite people in the universe. I had a great time.  - While in D.C., I reaffirmed my love for Thai food. Oh my goodness, so tasty. It makes me really sad that the only two places you can get really good Thai are D.C. and New York. They're so far away! But it just makes the times you can get it that much better.  - My ring is still broken, although my uncle is going to try to send me some silver wire so I can fix it myself. - Our house is filled with junk food left over from the visit. Pumpkin bread, candy, cookies, a brownie... they haunt my dreams and tempt my tastebuds.  - According to Kit anyway, I have too much hate in my system. Chocolate doesn't seem to be curing it so far; anybody got any other ideas?  - It's Monday. Enough said.

      The Red Sox won Game 6 tonight - there will be a Game 7 tomorrow but I probably won't be able to watch it because I'll be in D.C. Oh well.  From what I saw of the game, it was pretty good. Garciaparra got four hits! I have officially nicknamed him Twitchy - if you've ever watched him bat you'll know why. It's pretty funny. In the first 5 innings I wasn't sure who to root for when the Red Sox were up to bat because Andy Pettitte was pitching for the Yankees and he is really gorgeous. Wow he's beautiful. Anyway, I'm still really happy the Red Sox won.  This is so odd. I'm really not a sports person, but I've gotten really into baseball this postseason. I'm not really sure why. It's entertaining I suppose.   This will be my last post for a while since I'm leaving for Washington D.C. tomorrow morning. Have a lovely break everyone.

      Nothing is going my way in these stupid championship series. In one inning, the Cubs went from a 3-0 lead to trailing the Marlins 8-3. I really wanted a Cubs-Red Sox World Series. That would have been great. But now its chances are looking slim.  Go  urlLink here  if you want to know what happened.

      Silly Kerry Catherine. They wanted to charge me $30 to fix my ring! Last time they only charged me about $5. This sucks. So now my ring is still broken and I have no cheap way to get it fixed. Fortunately (drumroll please...) my uncle, who's coming into town in just a few days, actually majored in jewelry making in college. Crazy, no? But frighteningly convenient. Hopefully he'll make something work.  I hate my hair. I really really do. It's awful. My mom went and got hers cut at the same place and hers looks even worse than mine. It's pretty sad. And I wanted to be all pretty for when we go up to D.C. I'm rather upset. Dustin may have been nice, but he really didn't know what he was doing. I have yet to find a hairdresser that does, though. I hate it.   Thank God for fall break is all I have to say. After 9 tests, 3 projects, and 2 papers in 6 days, I am ready for a long nap.

      Arg, just spent over an hour moving all my horserace analysis stuff for the GoPo project onto a new webpage. I ran out of space on the old Freewebs one, so I had to get a new blog and post articles that way. The silly hyperlinks were being mean to me, but other than that it does look much better now. It's also quite a lot more convenient. All is good. Except my eyes are killing me. That kind of sucks.

      I went to go see a concert today. It was the Chamber Orchestra of the Triangle, or something similar. My sister's cello teacher was in it, so she got us tickets. It was pretty cool. They had a guest double-bassist, and he was really amazing. He went so far up the fingerboard that it could have sounded like he was playing a violin! He was really really talented.   Game 4 of ALCS tonight. Shouldn't be quite as exciting as last night - that 4th inning was enough drama to last me the rest of my life. (In case you missed it, there's a pretty good recap  urlLink here , but I think it still misses the drama of Martinez throwing Zimmer to the ground. That was pretty cool.)

      The name of  Hannah  creates a friendly, sociable, charming nature, but causes you to be too easily influenced by others. While you find it easy to meet and mix, and can appear agreeable and compromising in conversation, you can become dogmatic and forceful if pressed too far. Others learn that you cannot be told what to do and you seldom change your mind once it is made up. You prefer situations that allow a degree of independence, but are reluctant to take on a demanding work-load or responsibility. In a position dealing with the public, you could do well because of your friendly personality, interest in people, and desire to please. When asked, you are able to give others good advice that you would probably not follow yourself, but must guard against being too opinionated in controversial matters.

      Got my hair cut this morning. I can't decide if I like it - it's a little shorter than I think I wanted, but I'll get used to it. I had it this length about a year ago and I really liked it, but somehow it looks different this time. Oh well. The guy who cut it, his name was Dustin, was such a doll. He was washing my hair and he actually took a few minutes and massaged my head, all the way up onto my forehead and temples. It felt so good...  He was so cute and so sweet. I know people are supposed to talk when they're getting their hair cut, but it's so theraputic and I'm just not a very talkative person, so I end up sitting there for most of the time. Dustin kind of wanted to talk to me, though, so he decided he was going to try to set me up with some guy he knows who apparently plays guitar really well. It was pretty cute. He was a sweetie - I hope I can go back to him next time. Until then, I'll have to get used to having it this short.

      I had to take my cats to the vet today. I hate doing it so much. It takes about half an hour just to get them in the crate, and then two of us to carry it out to the car. They scream the whole way there - and it's that awful heart-wrenching yell that just breaks my heart. Then we get there and the vets poke and prod them, although usually they're really nice. Until they weigh the cats; then they come back and yell at us. Izzy was 19 pounds and Louie was 25! It's bad. So then we get them back in the crate and they scream the whole way back home. I'm always worried that they'll never forgive me, but they seem to forget pretty fast. About thirty seconds after we walked in the door, Louie was chirping around my feet, which was very comforting. Izzy hid, but I have a feeling that the psychological damage is only temporary.  All is well in kitty world.

      I was looking back over some of my archives and it struck me as funny how my posts have all gone from really long to mostly one-liners. An oddity.  So, update:  - Got into an argument with Myer today and stood up for myself pretty well. It was fun. - Am actually doing way better in many of my classes than I thought I was doing. Which makes me really happy. - Discovered that I am really good at writing three-page papers in less than 20 minutes. - Remembered just how much I love the guys working at the bakery counter at Wellspring. They are all so sweet, so loveable, and so cute. They also sell Triple Threat chocolate brownies, which helps. I had one today. Yum... - Took a long nap with my cats and Chris Thile playing in the background. It was lovely.  - Had a laughing fit in the car this afternoon when it suddenly dawned on me just how funny people are. How we all take things so seriously, especially myself. I take school and friendships and all of it way more seriously than I need to, and it's so comical to me how everybody's daily shit becomes so overwhelmingly important that they forget what's really there. I just started laughing and couldn't stop. That's what chemistry will do to you, I guess.  - Consequently, decided that I'm not going to do most of my homework tonight. Napping is so much more fun.

      We go back to school again tomorrow. I'm sad - I rather liked being on vacation.   On another note (happy or sad, you decide) we have two weeks until midterms. Shudder if you will, but keep in mind that after that is Christmas vacation. 16 days of beautiful school-free bliss. I can't wait.  I've been playing around more with iTunes on my computer. It's really fun. I've made lots of mix CDs and I've even bought a couple songs. It's so cool. I burned this massive mix CD of all my favorite songs and took it on a walk with me today. I was sad when I took the longest route possible and still ended up back home only halfway through. It was so good that I wanted to keep going forever, just me and my music.

      I want to be on permanent vacation. I love being able to sleep in as long as I want, do what I want when I want... it's a luxury.   Last of the turkey and other go-withs were finished off today. I'm sad - I'll miss it quite a lot. I'm shocked that we managed to go through that much food so quickly. Now all that remains of our huge dinner is a large canister of turkey stock in the freezer. I smell turkey soup...  I just watched a thing on C-Span showing a dinner honoring Tom Brokaw. I do like him very much, and will miss him when he retires. He's a very intelligent guy. Plus his voice is beautiful. And he was really handsome when he was younger. Look some pictures up on the internet if you don't believe me.   Another luxury of being on vacation: going to bed early. Good night.

      I'm playing with the iTunes thing on my computer. Good lord, it's cool. It seriously takes all of about two minutes to burn an hour long CD.

      Mmm, the day after Thanksgiving is always a good one. Somehow, everything tastes better the day afterwards. And oh, it was so good. My dad is the best cook ever. Turkey, stuffing, gravy, mashed potatoes, brussels sprouts, yams with rum, cranberry sauce, rolls, and really good cider. Oh so tasty. Plus cranberry bread and pumpkin pie... someone kill me now!   And I just finished watching Pride and Prejudice. I love that movie so much. It's sweet and romantic without being touchy-feely. Elizabeth Bennet is probably the greatest heroine of all time. Everything about that movie is absolutely perfect.

      I swear, my fingers are cursed. Last Thursday, as I was clipping off a hangnail, I snipped my finger and it started bleeding like mad. Everything was OK since then (with the usual exceptions of slamming them in doors and things like that), but today I was grating orange peel and I slipped and sliced the skin off my thumb, and then I burned another finger when I was adjusting a rack in the oven. I really hurt. And I have to go play guitar this afternoon. Ow.  On a happier note, my house smells fantastic. Cranberry bread and pumpkin pie... and now my sister's making a cranberry-orange sauce.

      My itinerary for the next few days:  Wednesday  Bake: Two cranberry breads and one pumpkin pie. Go To: Grocery store by at least 8:00 tomorrow morning to pick up turkey and various other foodstuffs. Guitar lesson at 4:00. Do: Learn piece that I still don't know by 4:00 (in time for lesson). Try to get at least some homework done.  Thursday  Do: Wander around the house until my dad is done cooking. Then... Eat: Turkey, stuffing, potatoes, yams, cranberry sauce, green beans, brussels sprouts, and some other things I'm sure I'm forgetting.   Friday  Do: Nothing. My dad is working all day and my mom is taking a friend to surgery. My sister and I will be home by ourselves. Hopefully: Get some more homework done. I would love to have everything done by the weekend so I can really relax for a couple days. Bake: Homemade bread. Eat: Lots of leftovers. Yum. (Hence the bread - turkey sandwiches.)  We'll have to wait and see what the weekend brings.  Ahh, I love vacations.

      I really should get back into photography. I miss it. It's so therapeutic, being in the darkroom completely by myself. Taking the pictures is thrilling enough, but there is something very magical about being in a dark room completely alone, the absolute master of light. It feels very powerful. And at the end of the day, you are left with something beautiful - a work of art. I got a call the other day from a woman whose wedding I did about a year and a half ago, and she said that the only pictures she kept were mine. She had a professional there, but she liked my pictures better. I felt so wonderful. Not only did I thoroughly enjoy myself, but I made someone else happy, and helped them preserve their memories in the best way possible. It was a real high. I want to do it again, but I just don't have time. Maybe over winter break I will get out and shoot a few rolls.  After tomorrow, a five day break. I'm very happy. I need a good rest.

       "I Do"   I got a little bit of reason For everything I've done I might just serenade the moonlight  And I get so lonely in this crowd I want to scream but make no sound And yeah I'm lost but maybe I'll be fine  Cause when I'm in over my head I hear the words you said That someone out there's  Listening to the same song Feeling the same way that I do Make me a believer, pick up the receiver And tell me you feel just like I do I do  And I couldn't bear to see you walk out And leave it all behind I couldn't bear to see the sunlight  And I love the sound of rain on tin Your screen door beckoning me in And yeah I'm mad but overcome with joy  Could it be so damn naive To hope you could agree? That someone out there's Listening to the same song Feeling the same way that I do Make me a believer, pick up the receiver Tell me you feel just like I do I do  In a world that's cellophane You get so lost I know you do In a world that's cellophane  Someone out there's Listening to the same song Feeling the same way that I do Make me a believer, pick up the receiver Tell me you feel just like I do I do Someone out there's Listening to the same song Feeling the same way that I do Make me a believer, pick up the receiver And tell me you feel just like I do I do   - Better than Ezra

      We went out to dinner tonight. It was pretty awful. Everything tasted like it came out of a can. Yuck.   I can't wait until Wednesday. No school, and it's baking day. I get to make a pumpkin pie and two cranberry breads. (I'm giving one away.) I love Thanksgiving. Mmm, so tasty. Plus, I really need a break from school. My head is full. I can't take any more. I need time to empty it.  My room smells like the roses my dad gave me on my birthday. They're still alive and beautiful on my bookcase. Pink and yellow. So elegant.

      I am having too much fun with my Unkymoods. (See, it's that little icon over yonder on the left.) They're too cute - it's hard to choose just one.   I don't want to work, but I have to. I don't want to practice, but I have to. I want to sleep, but I can't. Damn.  I'm such a slacker this year. I get home, and instead of religiously doing all my homework like I did last year, I choose the things I either know will be checked, or that I know actually matter. And the Chemistry homework, just because it's kind of fun. (I'm a dork, I know.) But I just don't do the rest of it, and I feel no guilt. Last year if I got too sleepy to keep doing my homework, I actually felt bad about it. But no. This year I have no remorse about it whatsoever because I know it doesn't matter. I'm not sure whether this is a good mindset or not, but there are some assignments teachers give out that seem to have no purpose at all. Clear example: Myer's assignment to write a story about song lyrics. If someone would tell me how that could possibly help me at all in later life, I would love to hear it because I can't think of a thing. It's useless.  Man, I want to be in college.

      Not only is it the process used to create the  urlLink Sunday "Can Hed Comix" , but I find it uncannily resembles my process of getting homework and projects done.     A Little Trivia  The Sunday comic strips go through a five step process in order to be completed. If you're interested in the process, read on: 1. Come up with an idea. 2. Scrounge up some paper. 3. Get some crayons and bits of colored paper out. 4. Draw. 5. Realize the entire idea sucked to begin with, scrap the project and get someone else to do it.

       urlLink There is hope!   My dad just got back from Washington and the Seattle area, and he said that the university there is fantastic. It's gorgeous, huge - undergrad population of 28,362 -, and very friendly. All the kids there apparently look just like me. (And the boys are cute, which helps.) I think I may have found my new school. Brown is wonderful, of course, but it's far away from anyone I know and it's very elite. I'm not sure I want to go somewhere that small and that private-feeling. I've always gone to small schools, and I'm ready for a change. I think I would fit in really well in a big university because I want to study such a broad range of things. I think it would be perfect to double major in something like Chemistry and History. UW would be a great place to go.   Plus, I already have the sweatshirt. I'm practically enrolled, as far as I'm concerned.

      There is a children's story about a girl who is very lonely, and she finds a group of kittens. She puts them in their pocket, and whenever she feels lonely or sad, all she has to do is reach into her pockets and there are her sweet little kittens waiting right there for her. She takes them everywhere with her, so she can be completely by herself, but she always has her kittens with her.   I want to be that little girl.

      Got my glasses today. Yay! I can see.  The excitement of Barry Trotter continues to grow. The Picking Cap (that's the Sorting Hat, for those non Potter-aficionados out there) gets drunk and starts cussing out the houses, and Hafwid (Hagrid) also gets drunk, but fires shots out his pink umbrella. There is also a section at the back of the book entitled, "A Thumbnail Guide to the Sordid Sexual Encounters Edited Out of this Book." I'm going to stop that right there. All in all it's pretty cute so far. I have to say my favorite part, though, is Lord Valumart. Enough said.   I don't want to go to school tomorrow. Too sleepy.   (That picture below from  Master and Commander  doesn't want to show up half the time, does it? If you can consistently see it, let me know on the chatter. I'm curious to see if it's just my browser or if I really am doing something wrong.)

       Master and Commander  was indeed quite good. I'm not a huge fan of big action movies, but I was highly impressed by how this one was anything but corny. The relationship between the captain and his friend, the doctor, was really wonderful, and was the crux of the movie. Parts of it were on the gory side, but it was worth it. I enjoyed it a lot.   I also was reminded how talented  urlLink Paul Bettany  is. He was by far the best part of the movie.

      Gracious, much has happened over the past couple days. I've been so busy there's been no time to post. It makes me sad, but there it is.   Went out to a sushi bar with my dad on Thursday night. Mmm, it was really good. I love sushi.   My dad left on Friday on a trip to Washington (the state, not the city). I miss him. I don't get to see him that often, so I get very sad when he leaves. Oh well. He comes back Tuesday morning.   Philosophy discussion Friday afternoon. I had to leave early, but it seemed to be going well. And more people got to witness the incessant stupidity of a certain English teacher. Cough. He was such an idiot - he sat at his desk trying to follow what was going on, but kept getting totally lost. And whenever someone would say something rampantly anti-religious, he would nod really vigorously. It would have been really amusing if it hadn't been so sad. He's such a dolt.   Got some early birthday presents from a couple friends. A parody book called "Barry Trotter and the Unnecessary Sequel" (guess what that's parodying) and a book so I can learn Chinese. I'm excited. And a t-shirt that I can't even wear around my dad because it has a kind of dirty Monty Python quote on it. Oh well, I still love it.   I think I'm going to see a movie tonight -  Master and Commander , the new Russell Crowe flick. I don't like Russell Crowe much at all (except in  Gladiator  - that was a great movie), but it's supposed to be really good. I'm keeping my fingers crossed.

      Today was certainly not the ideal day off. It was pretty icky.  I started feeling a little sick last night, but it wasn't that bad so I just went to be early to try to sleep it off. So this morning my mom offered to take me out to lunch, which is always loads of fun, so we went. It was pretty nice - we went to the Rockford. I love that place. Afterwards, we decided to go to the mall to pick up my glasses. Finally. So we got there and started looking at the el cheapo ones because my dad wants me to try those first. The woman I went to for my prescription basically told me that even a prescription wouldn't help me because it's some funky teenage thing that I'll eventually outgrow. So basically I'm supposed to have a permanent migraine from now until after college. Great. My mom told me, though, that if I didn't like the cheap ones that we could try the prescription just in case. So I started looking through the cheap ones and first of all, they just magnify things, they don't help my problem, and second, they don't come all the way up on your eyes so you have to cock your head back to do any kind of computer work. I couldn't stand them, so I said that we should just try the prescription because my head is killing me. Conveniently enough, my mother left the prescription at home. Lovely. So now I'm tired, have a fever, and I still don't have my glasses. This is when my mom decided she wants to go blouse shopping with me. So we look around and, of course, don't find anything as usual. It was still another hour or so before we could go pick up my sister and go home, so my mom offered to take us to a coffee shop to wait. We got in the car and drove to the cafe. When we got there, my mom saw that there was a new camera store next door, so she sent me to get her drink and then come back. I waited in that camera store for what felt like forever with nowhere to sit down and nothing to do. I started feeling sick to my stomach because the air in there was kind of weird. We finally left and got my sister from school. We got home and I took some medicine for my sore throat and went to bed. I slept for an hour and then got up to do homework. I was supposed to go see my sister's cello concert but I managed to get out of it. So here I am, feeling awful, doing my homework. Some day off.  I want a refund.

      I thought I'd make a public service announcement for the sophomore chemistry classes. If you're like me and didn't have a periodic table with both the names and symbols on it, there's an online table at  urlLink webelements.com . It has some great information on it - very helpful. (My link is to the student edition, but there's also a professional one.) Plus, there are printable versions with names and symbols on them as well.   Hope this helps any of you who were struggling...

      I saw  Finding Nemo  last night. What a sweet movie! The story wasn't great, but some of the voices were just precious and the animation was spectacular. After the movie was over we watched the behind-the-scenes documentary called "Making Nemo." It was really cool - the people at  urlLink Pixar  who made the movie are all just awesome people. They had all together too much fun making this thing. That would be an  urlLink incredible place to work , I tell you. So if you haven't seen this movie yet, do. It's very cute, and incredibly well made.   In my CD player - Far Too Jones: Shame and her Sister. It's good stuff, and it's also my one claim to fame. My dad was mentioned in the thank-you section - "And thanks to Dr. Krakauer for fixing my mangled hand." It's pretty cool that way.

      Time for an update.   - The dance was last night, and according to  urlLink Mica , it was pretty awful. I'm glad I didn't go.  - I fell asleep at 5:00 Thursday afternoon, so hopefully that explains my lack of posting that day. I offer no excuse for Friday - I was tired and didn't have anything to say.  - We were supposed to go to the Mac store this morning to take classes in some of the programs (and so I could see Casey... tee hee...) but no. Instead, I have to go get glasses and get a flu shot. Icky. Not pleased.  - Last night, I went to the Cary Barnes and Noble to see my sister's art class' tea pots that they made for a project. Some of them were really cool. There was one that looked exactly, and I mean  exactly , like the Cheshire Cat from Alice in Wonderland. It was very cool. I also met someone who had already seen the Matrix Revolutions and liked it better than the second one. This seriously boosts my hopes - that's one of those movies that I don't really want to see but kind of have to anyway. Oh well. Hope it's not too bad.

       Madame Arthur   Madame Arthur est une femme Qui fit parler, parler, parler, parler d'elle longtemps, Sans journaux, sans rien, sans réclame Elle eut une foule d'amants, Chacun voulait être aimé d'elle, Chacun la courtisait, pourquoi? C'est que sans être vraiment belle, Elle avait un je ne sais quoi! Madame Arthur est une femme Qui fit parler, parler, parler, parler d'elle longtemps, Sans journaux, sans rien, sans réclame Elle eut une foule d'amants, Madame Arthur est une femme Qui fit parler d'elle longtemps.  Sa taille était fort ordinaire, Ses yeux petits mais sémillants, Son nez retroussé, sa voix claire, Ses pieds cambrés et frétillants Bref, en regardant sa figure, Rien ne vous mettait en émoi; Mais par derrière sa tournure Promettait un je ne sais quoi!  Ses amants lui restaient fidèles, C'est elle qui les renvoyait Elle aimait les ardeurs nouvelles, Un vieil amour lui déplaisait Et chacun, le chagrin dans l'âme, De son cœur n'ayant plus l'emploi, Disait: hélas! une autre femme N'aura pas son je ne sais quoi! Il fallait la voir à la danse; Son entrain était sans égal Par ses mouvements, sa prestance, Elle était la Reine du bal Au cavalier lui faisant face Son pied touchait le nez, ma foi, Chacun applaudissait sa grâce Et surtout son je ne sais quoi!  De quoi donc vivait cette dame? Montrant un grand train de maison, Courant au vaudeville, au drame, Rien qu'à l'avant-scène dit-on Elle voyait pour l'ordinaire Venir son terme sans effroi, Car alors son propriétaire Admirait son je ne sais quoi!  Oh! femme qui cherchez à faire Des conquêtes matin et soir, En vain vous passez pour vous plaire Des heures à votre miroir, Elégance, grâce mutine, Regard, soupir de bon aloi, Velours, parfums et crinoline, Rien ne vaut un je ne sais quoi!

Congratulations go to David Defoe from London, England, who was kind enough to send me the hit counter with the lucky number on it.   Mmm, chocolate brownie waiting for me on the kitchen counter.

      My hit counter, miniscule as it is, is approaching its first 1000 mark. If you are the 1000th visitor, copy the counter into an email and  urlLink send it to me . (Watch, now I've jinxed it and no one will visit my blog. Oh well.)  I love my iBook. It's beautiful. I think I want to name it, but I'm not sure what. It's very definitely a boy - that's already decided. If you have any ideas, do feel free to post them in the chatter (see - it's over yonder on the left).   Everybody should get a Mac.

      Oh my goodness. So much has happened over the past few days. It being Sunday night (almost Monday, actually) and given the fact that I still have to do most of my homework, I very much doubt I will get everything to fit in this one post. It may very well spill over into Monday. We shall see.   I think the best way to do this would be to start at the beginning...  Update:  Friday - Flex Day. Was so much fun. Holy crap, it was great. "Animal Farm" in the morning was loads of fun. It was very silly, but still very fun. It was nice to let go and be totally unselfconcious for a while. Plus Myer just looked like even more of an idiot than normal which made me very happy. Good lord, I hate that man. Anyway... - Second Flex activity, SLA, was fun too. I didn't participate much, but it was still pretty fun. And I actually signed up for it afterwards! (Although I probably should confess that I kind of have alterior motives...) - Friday afternoon: went home with Kit. Got dressed up as a devil and handed out candy. Watched Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, but got tired halfway through. No worries - we got to the two best lines in the movie.   "But then who'd walk Patrick?" "You know what my momma always used to say. 'Two tears in a bucket, mother fuck it.'"   Saturday - Went to the Apple store to look at computers. We decided on a desktop with surprisingly little difficulty. (The people at that store are so cool!) So then my dad says, "OK, great. Let's go look at laptops now." I looked back in shock and he smiled and said, "For your birthday." AAAAAH! I have a laptop! Well, it's not really mine, but it's ours and I pretty much have priority on it. A LAPTOP, GUYS! And not just that, but it's an iBook! Dude! It's pretty cool! We also got a printer and things to set up a wireless network. They had to install extra memory on the desktop and the wireless network cards in both things, so we left them at the store. My dad and I went back to pick them up around 8 that night (along with some cafe lattes, of course) and brought them home. We set them up and tried to get our Earthlink software to work. But no, it didn't. I was up until the wee hours of Sunday trying to get it to work, but eventually I just gave up and went to bed.   Sunday - Got up early to keep working on the computers. Got the laptop to work great except for the Earthlink software, but the printer would not connect, wirelessly or otherwise. I called the Apple people, who told me to call the Earthlink people, who told me to call the Apple people, who told me to call the Earthlink people... you see where this is going. All in all, I spent over five hours on the phone with these people who couldn't solve any of my problems. When I hung up with the last guy who couldn't help me at all, I realized I hadn't eaten in about 30 hours and was running on 4 hours of sleep and I burst into tears. I couldn't stop - I don't know what happened. I was just exhausted I guess. My mom somehow managed to get a hold of the Apple store, which was really what we had wanted all along, and we made an appointment for the afternoon.  - Went to the Apple store and met a guy named Casey. We had actually met him before - he helped us carry all our stuff out to the car. I want to marry him. He's so cute - really tall and lanky, dark haired with a goatee (normally I don't like facial hair, but he looked so pretty with it), big, gorgeous hands, glasses, and he smelled really nice. He had so much energy it was not funny. He just never stopped! He was so smart and so sweet; he took me through everything and we had all our servers set up and running as well as the printer working in about three hours. He also showed me some really cool things you can do on a Mac. Like I say, I really want to marry him.  - Got everything home and tried to set it up. After a couple hours I had everything up and running. It's pretty cool now. So after that I had to go in and fix a few more simple things and before I knew it, it was really late. So here I am, 11:45, doing my homework. Good times. But guess what I'm doing it on? That's right, guys, MY NEW iBOOK! HA!    I'm an Apple girl now.

      Just because it seemed like a Harry Potter-themed kind of day. Sarah sent me these a while ago, and I thought they were very cute. And a little unnerving - I think I may do some of these things...   You're Too Big a Fan When...  - You mutter nonsense latin words under your breath. - You call your least favorite teacher Snape. - Your computer says "You've Got Mail" and you run outside looking for an owl. - You get a broom for Christmas. - Every time you turn on a flashlight you mutter "lumos" under your breath. - You sort everyone you meet into four categories. (Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff and Slytherin.) - You were burned when you couldn't get through the flames of your fireplace. - You had to go to the hospital after you broke your nose running headfirst into the wall between platform's nine and ten. - You try to turn your brother into a bouncing ferret. - You point a normal things like parking meters and say "Look at the things these muggles dream up!" - You collect plugs. - You try on ever piece of silvery fabric your mom has to see if you turn invisible - Before getting up to get something, you always try to summon it first. Accio TV remote! - When it is windy you take a long branch up to a swaying tree and try to press a knot to freeze it - You try to install a flying device in your car - You spend hours tapping bricks in special orders hoping that a secret entrance to Diagon Alley will appear. - When playing chess, you yell orders to the chess players and get upset when they don't move - You poke pictures in the house hoping to make them move. - You try to find an article by Rita Skeeter in the newspaper. - You scream into the "fellytone." - You go to antique stores searching for a clock that tells where people are.    Top ten signs your kid is a wizard  10. When he enters a room there is a burst of purple smoke 9. You say, "Do you think that lawn is gonna mow itself?" But then it does 8. He gets busted shoplifting a newt 7. Can turn lead into gold, but he can't remember to take out the trash - am I right, parents?? 6. He wears shiny red satin robes - and you're praying he's just a wizard 5. Favorite discount electronics store: "The Wiz" 4. He refers to Halloween as "amateur night" 3. He's only 12, but somehow he's dating Gwyneth Paltrow 2. His favorite excuse is that "his homework ate the dog" 1. You catch him in the bathroom polishing his wand

      Sarah found this really funny thing in the  urlLink second Potter Puppet Pals . When Voldemort is killing Snape, click the "stop" button down at the bottom and use the back-and-forth arrows to find the frame where the green lines form a star. Click on the star, and it takes you to another short sketch. Follow the butterflies!   I also found a few other rather funny things relating to the Puppet Pals in my search for the new third one. The best one (other than the music video I posted below) was this  urlLink audio of the series of songs  that are apparently going to be used in an upcoming movie - The Potter Puppet Pals Adventure. Some of them are very funny. My favorite is the very last one, so even if you don't think they're great, have patience and wait for the last song to come on. It's fun.

      There's a new Potter Puppet Pals! Kind of. I don't really get it - it's very short, and pretty much just Ron listening to a song and swaying back and forth. Hmm. One site I found said to watch  urlLink this  first, and then to watch  urlLink Ron listen to the song . I think the first one is much funnier than the second myself, but see what you think.

      I found an old copy of C.S. Lewis'  The Screwtape Letters  that used to belong to my mom. They're hilarious. I'm really enjoying reading them - he very subtly and poignantly points out the intricacies of human nature when it comes to religion and the "soul." There's one letter that I particularly enjoyed that talked about how people, even without a religion, can start unconsciously worshiping other more physical things, like an object or even ideas and little nuances in their daily lives. I realized when I was reading that I in fact know a number of people who do just that - who have replaced religion with other forms of worship, just as fundamental and bad as when they were overly zealous to begin with. I also found it fascinating that Lewis constructs his hell like a bureaucracy, a kind of model of the society we live in. If you haven't yet read the  Letters , I highly recommend them.   I'm going to see Lord of the Rings again on Friday. I'm very excited.   Mmm, sleep is good. I've been getting quite a bit of it lately. I feel so much more well-rested than I did at the end of exams. It feels good. I've managed so far to selectively forget that I have to write a paper and do some other homework. Perhaps later, after I've had another nap...

      I just got back from Lord of the Rings. Wow. I mean that was just... wow. It was incredible. The music, the special effects, the acting, the battle sequences, were all amazing. I cried. Multiple times. Damn you, Sam, and your incessant ability to bring me to tears! Anyway, I need to see it again. The whole thing was just... wow. And I mean wow.      I love you, Sam.

      So. Have added several new links over the past couple days that I should probably mention. And here they are: Barrett Brooks Lisa Rachel I met them at Kit's party and they are all quite fun. So go play on their blogs. Their links are all on the left there. Also, thanks to Rachel for linking me. (I love being linked!)  Christmas is sneaking up on me and I completely didn't notice. I still have to get my mother's present. And it's at Target - quite far away. Oh, to have a driver's license! What I wouldn't give for one right about now.   The cleaning continues today. I don't particularly like cleaning much (who does) but I must say I always do feel pleased with myself at the end result. It's nice to have a house that is dust-bunny-free.   And what is with all these people talking about how bored they are over break? Enjoy it while it lasts, kids - it won't be long. Trust me.

        Your soul is bound to the  Yellow Rose : The Gentle.   "I've travelled through the land of surrender and seen it all.  I throw my heart out and keep my head up, and now I travel through the land of peace."   The Yellow Rose is associated with friendship, intuition, and fun.  It is governed by the goddess Hestia and its sign is The Intertwined Rings, or True Friendship.  As a Yellow Rose, you always look out for your friends.  You would much rather have strong ties with friends than a single tie with a lover and your devotion to your friends is clear.  You may have great intuition and be able to read emotions clearly, but sometimes you can seem distant yourself.    urlLink   What Rose Is Your Soul Bound To?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Figured it was time for a good post. Update:  Exams are over. Yay! I know three of my grades, and they're all pretty good. I'm rather pleased with myself. All that studying really did pay off. I'm exhausted, and very glad it's break. Even though I still have lots of stuff to do.   Friday night went to hang out with Joelle and Sarah et al. Our attempts to go see Return of the King failed when someone informed us that they had called the theatre and all the shows were sold out. I need to get tickets early. I can't wait to see it - I've heard nothing but incredible things about it. One review I read said something along the lines of, "To speak of how wonderful this movie is would be to weep in public." Must be pretty good, eh? Soon.  Also on Friday night, my family became the world's most pitiful Jewish family. I was gone and my dad was asleep, and since he and I are the only ones that know the blessing for the candles, the first night of Hanukkah went completely uncelebrated. It's pretty sad. I must say, though, that it was rather nice on Saturday not to have to clean out the menorah so we could put the next day's candles in. My mom suggested that we just get a big bowl of oil and set it on fire and see how long it would last. I think we may do that.   My mom, sister, and I went to see the Nutcracker today. It was pretty average; most of the dancing was mediocre at best. There were a few really good parts - the orchestra was fantastic, the Sugar Plum Fairy was beautiful, and the Nutcracker was decently handsome. He was also very talented. I was wondering just why I love that ballet so much, and I think it's because ever since I was very little, I always fantasized about being Clara. I mean, what little girl on the planet doesn't want to be defended by a gallant hero who turns into a handsome prince and takes you in his arms and dances with you? It's wonderful, and I still dream about it.   The best part of the whole thing (and also the worst) was the people who were sitting around me. We went to a matinee, so there were lots more kids and old people than there are at the evening performances. There was an old woman sitting next to me who didn't clap much, but occasionally in the middle of a piece she'd clap her hands together and go, "Yay!" and then stop as quickly as she started. It was totally unpredictable, but really funny. She'd also whisper things really loudly to her granddaughter sitting beside her. "You know," she said at one point, "those dancers are probably 14, 15, 16-year olds!" when they were very obviously in their mid-twenties. And then behind me there was this sweet little girl who kept getting confused and asking her mom what was going on. When Coffee came on to dance, she said, "Mommy, what's this part?" The mom was trying to be polite and not talk, so she didn't answer her daughter. But she was still confused, so she said again, "Mommy, what's this part?" and then when she didn't get an answer, " Mom , what's this part?" Her mom finally said, "It's Coffee, honey, now shh, be quiet." After a little pause, the girl said, "Mommy, why is she Coffee?" and the whole thing started over. It was annoying, but very cute.

       Exam update:  APES and GoPo today. Neither exam was nearly as hard as I thought it would be. I finished APES in about an hour and fifteen minutes, it was that easy. GoPo wasn't too terrible either - all that studying really payed off! At least I hope it did... we'll see when I get my grades back I suppose.   French and Chemistry tomorrow. French is really easy, so no last-minute studying going on there. I've heard some really nasty things about how hard Chemistry is, though, so I'm definitely doing some more review there. I'm feeling pretty solid about most of it though, so I'm not sure what people are complaining about. Hopefully it won't be too terrible.

       Exam Update:  English and Algebra II today. English went better than I thought it would. There were some character IDs and quotes that I had absolutely no idea on, but other than that I knew just about everything. Algebra went really well. I think I may have aced it, except for that one question that I realized I missed about 10 minutes after I turned my test in. I hate when I do that - make a stupid mistake and not realize it until it's too late. I swear, I checked my answers about 10 times and it never even dawned on me that it might be wrong because it seemed so obvious. Oh well. It was only like a two-point question, so it doesn't really matter anyway. It just bugs me.   Tomorrow is my hardest day. The thing that scares me the most is that I really feel like I know all the material really solidly, especially in GoPo. I've never felt this confident before, and it scares me a little. I know I'll do OK on both my exams, I just don't know how OK. I wish I felt better about them... but I don't and I'll just have to deal with it.

      I think I will follow in  urlLink Mica's  footsteps and ponder the ideal man.  - He must be funny. I am all together way too serious to ever love someone who didn't have a great sense of humor.  - Respectful. I fantasize about men from Jane Austen novels who hold open the door for me and are polite all around. It's amazing how far smiling briefly or offering a compliment can go.  - Taste. This encompasses a lot, and unfortunately is lacking in many people I know. I'm not so much attracted by the slovenly, un-showered type and would much prefer a guy who, while not necessarily being perfectly manicured, is at least clean. And smells nice. Having taste also means he would not make distasteful or overly colorful comments, nor would he act in an immature and repulsive manner.  - Originality. Posers are not attractive. Being unique and standing apart from the crowd are invaluable.  - Responsible. Diligence always pays off.  - Kind, thoughtful, sensitive, and all the other things that make a person pleasant to be around.   Unfortunately, such a man doesn't exist, and I am hardly the person to request him if he does, seeing as I probably don't live up to my own criteria. But I do try, and effort is always good, too.   On another note, exams begin tomorrow. Gack. My exam schedule:  Wednesday  English & Algebra II  Thursday  AP Environmental Science and GoPo  Friday  French IV and Chemistry  Thursday is by far my hardest day, not only because they're my too hardest classes, but because the political agendas for the classes are totally opposite. In APES, all I have to do to do well on a test is chant in my head, "Democrats good, Republicans bad." And then for GoPo, I chant, "Republicans good, Democrats bad." I know I'm going to walk in to at least one of those exams on Thursday and get mixed up. I'll be saying, "OK, Democrats good, Republicans bad," and then realize, "Oh crap! Wrong exam!" And then I'll have to erase everything and start over. It's sad, but true.

      A studying update:  - Yesterday, spent nearly 12 hours making The GoPo Review To End All GoPo Reviews. It's eleven pages long and beautiful. I also managed to re-memorize all 27 amendments and all the Supreme Court cases in less than 10 minutes. If I don't do well on this test it will not be my fault.  - APES exam is all multiple choice. Life is good. And I know all the terms and most of the concepts, so I should be OK.  - French. Studying not so much happening for that class.  - Chemistry needs some quick intensive review on history-type stuff, but I'm just dandy on everything else. Plus, it's my last exam, so I've got time.  - Math is a fluff. Yay for easy math classes that make sense. And even more yay for cool math teachers with British accents. Mrs Scicinska - you're my hero.  - So then there's Myer. Meh.

       Sonnet 116   Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments. Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds, Or bends with the remover to remove: O no! it is an ever-fixed mark, That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark, Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks Within his bending sickle's compass come; Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, But bears it out even to the edge of doom.      If this be error, and upon me proved,      I never writ, nor no man ever loved.    - William Shakespeare

      Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh... My neck and shoulders were really tight and I just put a heating pad on them. Man, this feels good. I should do this more often.   During APES today when we were in the computer lab, Claire pulled up my blog and I found out that the template they see is very different from the one that I do. That made me both confused and sad - I like the one I see much better. The fonts are more uniform and there aren't any table lines. If I have time over break, I'll play around with it and see what I can do.

      There was an earthquake in Virginia today. And a good sized one at that - 4.5! I felt it in my room. My head was against the wall as I was doing homework and my barrette started shaking. I could feel my whole bed tremor. The entire thing lasted for a few minutes at least. I think that may have been my first earthquake - I can't remember any from when I was in California, although my parents have told some good stories. Pretty exciting, no?

To those of you who read it and were offended by it: I am truly and deeply sorry. I meant no offense, and if there was any way I could take back what I said I would. I don't want to "compartmentalize" my friends, or leave them out of a list. It was very petty of me, and I am very very sorry. I hope you can forgive me. I have never felt so stupid or immature in my life.

I love all of you equally, and think of all of you as sweet, funny, smart, and whatever else was on there.

      Don't feel so much like doing anything productive. This is probably not good considering the crazy amount of things I have to do. I'm going to die sometime before midterms, mark my words. I'm trying so hard not to stress myself to the point of illness again, but I can feel it coming. It starts in my toes and works its way up to my head, where it stays and won't go away. I'm not looking forward to it.   There's no food in the house and I'm here by myself. I'm hungry. What to do?   It baffles me how in one year English went from being my favorite class to the time I dread the most every day. I guess I really am sensitive to the teacher I have. This scares me a little bit - how am I supposed to know my true interests and passions if my stupid teachers keep deciding for me? I wish I knew for certain. But I don't, and it drives me crazy.

      I took a walk this afternoon. It was cold enough that I could see my breath, and it was raining a little. I had my Washington Huskies sweatshirt on. I felt like a real Seattle college student. It was perfect.   Went out to dinner at this little Chinese place in the middle of nowhere. Ironically enough, Kit's dad reviewed the place a few years ago and called it one of the best, if not the best, Chinese place in the Triangle. And indeed it was very good. Scrumptious.   We rented Pirates of the Caribbean for tonight. Jack Sparrow, here I come!  I don't have to do any homework tonight because I did all the necessary stuff for tomorrow's classes last night.

      I'm too neurotic. I keep trying to work my schedule for the next two years to satisfy college admissions people, be with friends, and make me happy. I think at least one of those things is going to end up being impossible. Which makes me sad.

      So yes. Have been in the mood to (finally) update the links section. If you want to be linked, let me know and I will be happy to do so.   Rachel Ann gets linked whether she wants to or not just because I want to. So there.   There is too much going on. Squonk things and SLA things and more Squonk things and midterm things and various other club things. There are not enough hours in the day.   My junior year may very well end up being way harder than it needs to be. Two AP histories in the same year? We shall see.   There seems to be a general turmoil/crisis circulating the RCHS blogosphere. People are silly.

      Elizabeth: If I could love a man who could love me and take me for a mere 50 pounds a year, I should be very well pleased. But such a man could never be sensible and you know I could never love a man who was out of his wits.  Jane: Oh Lizzy... A marriage where either partner cannot love or respect the other cannot be agreeable - to either party. Elizabeth: As we have daily proof... But beggars you know cannot be choosers. Jane: We are not very poor, Lizzy. Elizabeth: With father's estate entailed away from the female line we have little more than our charms to recommend us. One of us at least will have to marry very well. And since you are by far the prettiest and have the best disposition I fear the task falls upon you. Jane: But Lizzy, I would wish - I should very much like - to marry for love. Elizabeth: And so you shall. Only take care to fall in love with a man of good fortune.  Jane: And you? Elizabeth: I am convinced that nothing but the deepest love will induce me into matrimony. So - I will end an old maid and teach your ten children to embroider cushions and play their instruments very ill.   You know you've seen a movie way too many times when you can recite the entire five-hour long thing line by line. But I don't care - Pride and Prejudice is still one of the best movies of all time.

      I have been contemplating lately. I think my posts used to have much more of a philosophical intent to them than they do now. I was wondering why, and I think  I may have the reason. I was talking to my mother the other day. As much as I complain about how overbearing she is and how she annoys me greatly, in all honesty she's probably one of the most well-read and most intellectual people I know. We were having a conversation the other night about life - why we're here, the intent of human existence, whether or not there is a higher power or a "plan" that unites the universe. We must have talked for about two hours before we went to bed. It was one of the most enlightening conversations I've had in a long time, and I think one of the reasons it was so wonderful was because it was just that - a conversation. You can only have a true epiphany when you are conversing with someone, bouncing your ideas off of them and letting them do the same on you. I don't think I would get anything out of posting my philosophical musings here, nor would anyone reading them. Therefore, I hope you will forgive me if the contents here do not reflect either my character or the deepest inner-workings of my soul. If anyone wishes to know me better, as several of you already do, I do not believe the best way to do so is read my posts. Not that I am discouraging anyone to stop reading, nor am I putting down the purpose of my blog. I am merely apologizing if what you read here is not the deepest of reflections. I hope one day I will be at the comfort level where I can bare my soul to the Internet-browsing world as others are able to do, but until that day, it will have to rest in an indeterminate state.

      Some new links up, including Mr Grunden's Dadman blog. It's most excellent. I've laughed and cried. (And her name's Hannah to boot. Good name choice, Grundens. Very well done.)   I've been a lazy lazy blogger lately. I'm sorry. I'll get back into it later; I've been feeling out of sorts these past couple weeks. It'll pass soon enough. But for now I feel like hiding from the world, like I want to take my bookshelf and my cats and live in the mountains away from everyone for about five years. Maybe then I'll come back and wow everyone with my brilliance and well-rested-ness. How wonderful that would be. But alas...  Half-day make-up day tomorrow. Shouldn't be too bad. We'll see. Then movie with Sarah and Joelle. Promises to be much fun.

      WE HAVEN'T LOST POWER (YET)! WE HAVEN'T LOST POWER (YET)!  This is (probably) good!  (We're still keeping our fingers crossed - more ice to come today.)   Monday    High: 33º F  Cloudy with rain and freezing rain developing this afternoon. Highs in the upper 20s-mid 30s. This morning we will have a lull in activity with perhaps some freezing drizzle with no accumulation. This afternoon, a plume of moisture builds into the state from the southwest. We are thinking that temperatures should rise through the day so when the precipitation does begin, it will be in the form of freezing rain and then change over to rain.  We may see a light buildup of ice in the Triangle area from 1/10-1/4" with a greater accumulation west into the Triad of 1/4-1/2".    (From  urlLink wral.com )  Uh oh.

      Eeek!   Sunday    High: 26º F Snow and sleet develop then change to sleet and freezing rain this afternoon and then to a light freezing rain tonight. Highs in the mid-upper 20s. A Winter Storm Warning is in effect through midnight. We anticipate a serious blow from an ice storm which will last through tonight. The northern counties will likely see a 3-5" mixture of snow and sleet. For the Triangle area at least a 1-2" mixture of snow and sleet with a .25" ice buildup. Areas south and southeast of the Triangle could see as much as .25" ice buildup. Be prepared for power outages and freezing temperatures through tomorrow morning.

      Missed the State of the Union? Here are the notes - Hannah Style.   (These are copied exactly from what I wrote down while listening to the address, so brace yourself for lots of spelling errors, grammar misusage, and probably some not-so-nice remarks. Sorry.)  - Opened with Iraq, faded into the traditional partisan ranting and bragging - Back to the war, mention of September 11 - Patriot Act - as protection against terrorism (controversial!) - Further discussion of terrorism and rooting out the terrorists, countries that harbor terrorists - Success in Afghanistan - Success in Iraq since the last State of the Union (including the capture of Saddam) - "U.S. will never be intimidated by thugs and assassins" - Welcomed Iraqi governing council member - Libya releasing nuclear weapons - keeping WMDs out of N. Korea - Giving army resources needed to win the war on terror - More fighting against terror stuff - "Stupid Democrats almost didn't let us go to war; look what would have happened if we didn't." [So he didn't really say that. He might as well have.]  - Everyone wants to be free (God told me so) - freedom in the Middle East is critical; development of free speech, press, the arts, etc.  - "No ambitions of empire" - doing this for others as our duty as Americans - Economy: been through many hardships, but is strong and getting stronger - Job growth in highly skilled professions; training required  - Education and NCLB; criticism of those who didn't like the plan ("Stupid Democrats... Damn that Ted Kennedy.")  - "Jobs for the 21st Century" - help students with math & science for job training and other areas of education  - Encouraged Congress to make tax cuts permanent - Energy: proposed legislation to modernize & make less dependent on foreign sources - Free & fair trade - S.S. in personal retirement accounts, other things that make people happy; available to everyone (except that damn Ted Kennedy) - "We must act as good stewards of tax payers' dollars"  - Budget plan in two weeks - among other things, halve the deficit in 5 years - Reform immigration laws; temporary worker laws - Control costs of medicine, "requires bipartisan efforts," applauded Congress for its efforts - Rising health care costs - improvements in the system (reduce frivolous lawsuits, gov't shouldn't be running healthcare - keep it private) [Insert mean snarl from Ted Kennedy] - Drugs=bad; use has gone down - funding to continue testing, community efforts, etc.  - Steroid/performance drugs=bad - STDs=bad - Gay people=bad - no marriage for them - People who don't let churches have money to do stuff=bad - Ex-criminals=good - help ex-cons get help upon release - Closed with patriotic feel-good stuff: letter from a girl in Lincoln, RI

Lots of skanky prom dresses to look at. Good times.   I really should be doing my homework, or at least doing something intelligent, but no. I think I'll take a nap.   My blog has gotten so boring lately - it's just my rants about how tired I am or how crappy I feel. I'm really sorry. I haven't been thinking very deeply lately, or if I have, I've felt like keeping it private and off the internet. Want to know what's in my head for real? Call me. Some of you already do.   I am becoming more and more appreciative of my friends. I am so lucky to live amongst such a nurturing, accepting group of people. If there's something I need to talk about, I can think of a whole group of people I could call in an instant. You know who you are. And I love you for it.     Thank you.

Almost there... just a few more hours. Then a three-day weekend. Yay. I haven't been sleeping very well lately, so hopefully that's all I'll be doing. And homework. That'll take a while too.

      There is so much work to be done.  Homework. Practice. Cleaning.  But somehow I don't feel like doing any of it.  I want to sleep.  And see Lord of the Rings. That is all.  Today I'm feeling overwhelmed - like I have so much that I want to (or mostly have to) do, and I can't bring myself to even get started on any of it.  I want to quit school and guitar and all my extracurriculars and just sleep for the next five months until summer comes, and then I want to go to Europe.  Blah.

      On July 24th, there will be a  urlLink Blogathon  where bloggers update their blogs every half hour for 24 hours to win money for various charities. We should do it, RCHS bloggers! It would be much fun.   In other news, today is Wednesday. But in my head it's Tuesday, which therefore means that tomorrow, although it will be Thursday, will feel to me like Wednesday; and then the day after tomorrow, although it will be Friday, will feel to me like Thursday, and then I will get to end my week feeling like it's a day early. Mostly because it is. But I like the feeling either way.   In other other news, I'm in love with life. I'm having a good day. No particular reason, just am. I'm feeling in love with everything I see - the trees, the sky, the clouds, all of it. I want to hug the earth.

      I think I shall make myself a new template. This one's code was messy to begin with, and now I've made it even worse. Icky.   First day back was not terrible in the least. Exam grades are good, and semester grades are good as well. All is well in the school world.   I think I may indulge myself in a bath tonight. I should very much like to relax a little.   I watched some of Sense and Sensibility with the commentary today. Emma Thompson is an incredibly smart woman, and Ang Lee is an incredibly brilliant director. I'm happy. They should both make more movies. On a similar note - I want to see a movie Ang Lee directed called Eat Drink Man Woman. It's supposed to be very good.   I thought my return to school would herald a revived interest in posting more often. Alas, it does not seem to be so. Not yet anyway. With any luck, I'll get into the swing of things again soon.

      School starts back up tomorrow. I am sad, but not entirely so. I'm still tired, but I think I may be ready to go back. The reason I am saddest is because I didn't get to do many of the things I wanted to over break.    Things I Wanted To Do But Didn't  - Read  The Screwtape Letters ,  The Da Vinci Code , and my collected works of Jane Austen that my sister gave me.  - Clean my room. I think I started out almost every day this last week meaning to do just that, and then forgetting until it was time to go to bed.  - Practice guitar more. I really need to do that.  - Update my template. It needs fixing and beautification.   But then there were also...   Things I Wanted To Do, And Did  - Walk to The Third Place. It's about two and a half miles from my house, and is a very nice walk.  - Sleep. A lot.  - People-watch. I went to the mall with Kit the day after Christmas and watched a lot of fun people all chasing the sales. I also went shopping a few other times with my mom and sister and we did a lot of people-watching together as well.  - Do my homework. I'm rather proud of myself that I got all of it done a couple days early.  - See Lord of the Rings in all its splendor. I meant to go see it a second time, but car troubles prevented it.  - Watch Sense and Sensibility about a hundred times. I cried at least 99 of those times.    Things I Hadn't Planned On, But That Were Fun Anyway  - Buy a formal dress. It's lovely and gorgeous and all other things good. I also got shoes and found in my closet matching earrings, a necklace, and handbag. All of it was on serious sale. I'm not sure when I'll get to wear it (prom, maybe?) but if not this year then next year for sure.  - See Peter Pan. What a sweet movie.  - See The Blues Brothers for the first time. I got goose-bumps when Aretha Franklin sang. That woman can sing.  - Learn how to bake biscotti. I made several different kinds and they were all scrumptious.  - See an Italian movie called  Pane e Tulipani , or Bread and Tulips. It was so good - it was about an Italian woman on vacation with her family. She gets left behind at a bus stop and decides to hitchhike her way to Venice. It's a sweet sweet story. I know I always have to be in a certain mood to watch a movie with subtitles, but if you are ever in that mood you should definitely watch this movie. It's so good.   I think I'll be happy to get back into the swing of things, though. I miss going to The Third Place with my dad. It will be nice to start doing that again. Perhaps I will also get back into my blogging habit - I've been shirking my duties lately.   Happy last day of vacation everyone, and a joyous new semester.

      I just had a pleasant surprise. I didn't realize we have Monday off from school. This is a great feeling. It's like going to bed on Sunday night, dreading going to school the next day, and then realizing that it's not Sunday, it's Saturday! You have a whole other day to sleep in and relax before you have to go back. Oh how happy I am!

       urlLink Bethany  found an  urlLink alternate ending to the Aicha music video  I posted a couple days ago. Scary. But funny.   I definitely didn't mean to put off doing all my homework until today. I'm not very excited about the paper-writing and question-answering I have to do. Yucky. And I've been having way too much fun writing arguments in the philosophy journal using Sense and Sensibility as my analogy. It's good.

       Happy New Year!   I just got back from seeing Peter Pan. What a sweet movie. I liked how they actually followed the book (cough cough, Disney, cough cough) and played up the real theme of the story - the pain of growing up. Peter was appropriately precious, and Hook was appropriately scary. I especially liked how Jason Isaacs played Hook; he was much more of a seducer than I had previously seen him played. I liked the movie quite a lot.

      Today was extraordinarily productive. I feel really really good.   - Got rid of my bookcase and put my old desk where the bookcase was.  - Made myself a new bookshelf with some boards and bricks. It's really cool and artsy looking.  - Cleaned out both my bookshelf and my desk, as well as parts of my dresser. I would have tackled my closet as well, but there was that pesky English paper to write.  - Wrote the bulk of the paper - most of the middle - but haven't yet done the introduction, conclusion, and filler stuff.  - Cleaned off all the surfaces in my room, so now it's all clean and pretty.   But, I still have a number of things to do:   - Finish that English paper, along with some other smaller homework.  - Finish dusting my room. You would be shocked how much dust can gather behind furniture when it hasn't been moved in a long time. It's nuts.  - Hem my curtain. It used to hang nearly to the floor, but since the bookshelf is under it now I have to hem it.  - Practice guitar. Yeah, I've been kind of lazy about that lately...   And before I forget, last night we went to see "The Fog of War." It was really interesting. If anyone is interested in the Cold War I would highly recommend it. The interviews were interesting, the editing was spectacular, and the archival footage was well-balanced. It was a terrific movie.   Mmm. Weekends.

      I will issue one (hopefully final) apology. If, in my comments, I offended anyone's religion or beliefs, please know that it was unintentional. I am truly sorry. I would very much like to close this discussion, as I feel badly about offending some people. Religious arguments are seldom productive, and I believe this one just goes to show that point. People were insulted on both sides, and if at all possible, I would like to end that. Thank you for your comments, and if you feel absolutely compelled to respond you may do so, but I shall try to refrain from responding further.   Please know also that in any comment I made, I was referring to the film and to the film only. I was most certainly not trying to make general references to any religion or religious school of thought. Once more, if anyone was offended, I apologize. It was most unconsciously done.

      Apparently my last post, which wasn't intended to offend anyone, has gravely insulted some people. I apologize. I did not mean to offend people in the least.   But  I am still not going to see the movie. Both the extreme violence and anti-Semitism are clear reasons for me not to go see it. If you want to, fine. Be my guest. I remain steadfast.   I would also like to say that people are more than welcome to argue with me on religious principles, although there is really very little to argue about. However, I would appreciate it as a personal favor if people would avoid damning me to Hell in a public forum. I do not take offense at too many things, but comments such as these are not productive and are very hurtful. Please don't make me cry again. Thank you.

      Tee hee. From  urlLink Kit/Claire's blog  comes  urlLink an amusing story : apparently God was a chief contributor on "The Passion of the Christ" and actually had his own IMDb database page. So God talked to Mel Gibson and told him to make a movie that makes Pontius Pilate out to be a good quiet guy who didn't really want to kill Jesus, and the Jews the evil, despicable people who forced him to do it? Call me crazy, but I have a hard time swallowing that one.   In a related story: "The Passion" is garnering  urlLink not so hot reviews  from many critics. Most attest to the extraordinary violence, others to the gross anti-Semitism and the extreme license Gibson takes with the account in the Gospels. Even the good reviews are given with hesitation, commenting well on the direction skills and some of the more technical aspects of the film, but steering away from the core of its plot and delivery.   And in a side note of commentary: I will not be seeing this movie. Even if I didn't find the anti-Semitism blatantly offensive, I am not one to pay to sit and watch a man (Jesus or not) being tortured for nearly two hours. It's just not my cup of tea.

      Sweet. I think my parents were going to try to drag me and my sister somewhere horrible this weekend, but we won and don't have to go anywhere. Life is good when you get to spend a whole relaxing weekend at home. Aaaah... solitude.   Tonight we're planning to go see a movie called  urlLink "The Fog of War."  It's supposed to be very good - it's a documentary about Robert McNamara, the Secretary of Defense during the Vietnam War and the Cuban Missile Crisis. I'm looking forward to it.

      If you had told me two months ago that one day I would be at school, it would start snowing, school would be canceled for the rest of the day, and I would say, "Crap! This is really bad!"

      I think I may be feeling a little better. Still haven't gotten whatever-it-is out of my system, but I can feel it surfacing. Give it time. To anyone I've been mean, rude, or downright bitchy towards in the past few days: I'm sorry. I don't mean it. I'm just angry at the world and have been taking it out on... the world. It will pass.   "This is a group of people with a sense of humor. Life is too serious for us to take ourselves seriously. We enjoy life and all it has to offer. We rejoice in the discoveries of science: the decoding of the DNA, the functioning of the brain, the wresting of the mysteries within the heart of the atom itself, the new physics, modern technology, and the computer age. We rejoice in poetry, music, and dance. We rejoice in nature.   "We also remain aware of the past and its traditions. We do not follow the traditions themselves, nor do they bind us. Rather we acknowledge them as part of our cultural past and as a source from which much of our present civilization springs forth....  "We recognize and acknowledge the value of ancient mythologies. By mythology, we mean something that while not necessarily factual, is nevertheless true. They point not to one time and event in history but to the ever-recurrent realities of the soul. As we discover more about evolution and the universe, new meanings arise. The old mysteries, as they unravel, eternally disclose new ones to be unveiled. Therefore we can hold no beliefs, only hypotheses; open to be discarded or changed at all times."   - Rosamonde Miller   Thank you, Rosa. I needed that.

      Our front room! It's pink! YAY! I was feeling very pink today, having been inspired by both my toenails and the lovely color that now occupies the walls in that room.   Last night was a flamenco guitar concert, performed by the infamous Paco de Lucia and his band. It was incredible. The first half was, I thought, much better than the second, because it was mostly solos or guitar and percussion. The second half had more instruments, like a bass, flute, and soprano sax. The worst part was the two singers they got. As my dad remarked afterwards, they sounded like a herd of dying high-pitched cattle. It was bad. Plus, they turned up the volume on the mics A LOT for the second half, so it was crazy loud. By the end, we all had massive headaches. But it was definitely worth going, if only to see the first half. Paco is truly incredible. Gives me a reason to practice, that's for sure.   The people organizing the APES classes need to stop getting in so many guest lecturers to put us to sleep and start teaching the material. Just an idea. My justification for this comment?  urlLink This  was our class today. It's a little sad.

I'm very happy.   Today was a half-day at school. No one was there, and it was a little sad. We mostly just goofed off in classes, and it wasn't miserable.   Tomorrow is my mom's birthday, and since tomorrow evening we'll be out at a concert, my dad, sister, and I cooked a big dinner. We decided to be adventurous and get a dim sum book to make dumplings and pot stickers.  The Event In Pictures  Me concentrating very hard on making the dough (from scratch!).    Aww, aren't they cute? They looked like little flowers on their plates.     We cooked them in a steamer.     Chaos ensued...    But was soon remedied.     There were lots of presents.    And the table was lovely.     Power to the peoples. And all this managed to happen simultaneously with my mother painting the living room. Ballet pink. It's very pretty.

Mmm, cute clothes.  I'm HAPPY!   But...  Major serious big ugly homework has to happen tonight, and I am definitely not looking forward to it.

      Happy Valentines/Singles' Awareness Day!  (Thanks to  urlLink Steven  for that marvelous outlook. I've firmly adopted it.)   You know, people say it sucks to be alone on Valentine's Day. Somehow, I couldn't care less. My dad always does something special - I guess living in a house with three women and two effeminate cats can do that to you - so there's at least some chocolate in the house. Part of the reason I don't really care may very well be that I've never had someone on Valentine's Day, so I don't feel like I'm missing out if I don't have someone. The holiday as a whole seems rather silly. If you want to show someone you care, try springing it on them instead of waiting for the day when you're expected to do something. I know I'd like that much better myself. I hate all these commercials out now that show women crying like mad because their boyfriend got them a necklace. Come on ladies - we're not that shallow, are we? I'd certainly like to think not.   So whether you have someone or not, happy February 14th. Enjoy the chocolate.

      Blog browsing. Because I can't fall asleep. Grr. Found some good and entertaining things. (If you aren't reading  urlLink Kit's blog , why?) I enjoy browsing.   But I also found some things that confuse me. On  urlLink Nate's blog  for instance, I found this:    Sometimes, of course, things don't go so well. There are a couple incidents concerning Hannah that've come up over the past few months...    I was totally unaware there was any kind of "incident" myself. So I say this (and it applies to everyone, really): If it was my fault, I'm very sorry. I'm sure whatever I did was unintentional, because I can't imagine ever intentionally hurting anyone, especially a friend. I would also like to add - and this very distinctively goes along with Complaint #3 below - if you have a problem with how I've been acting or something I've been doing, please tell me. There is no need to go behind my back and proclaim to the world that I've done something that I didn't even know I did. I'm being serious. I have no problems listening to people who think I've been doing something wrong. I need the criticism from time to time. Next time someone's mad at me, please say it to my face. I'd really appreciate it. Thanks.

      I would like to register a few complaints with the authorities.   1. I should very definitely NOT feel this crappy after three (count 'em - three) days in bed. I can't swallow or talk because my throat is so swollen, and even if I could swallow I can't eat because I'm still nauseous. I can't even talk on the phone it hurts so much. Plus I'm exhausted, but so feverish and sore that I can't fall asleep. It's not supposed to work this way, and it makes me angry.   2.  urlLink J. Jill  needs to stop making such pretty clothes at such outrageous prices. If they were at all reasonably priced I think I would buy out the store. But no. They don't. And then when the sale catalogs do come out and the prices are normal they're all out of everything I want. Come on, J. Jill people, get your act together so I can be pretty.   3. I don't like it when people talk about me behind my back. You know who you are. Stop it.   4. To my cats: Stop waking me up by pouncing on my stomach at three-frickin'-thirty in the morning. Your voluminous 25 pounds are not welcome on top of me that early. Sorry. You can wait the extra few hours to eat. It's not like you're going to starve - live off your body fat for a while. I love you, but you make me crazy sometimes.  I really need to get better. I don't like feeling this awful.

      Still sick... but I don't have strep, which is comforting. I've got all the symptoms, but they'll eventually go away on their own without me having to take antibiotics, which always seem to make me feel even more sick. I'm happy about that. (That I don't have to take them, not that they make me sick.)   Mmm, lots of naps today. Feels good.

      People are suddenly posting all these song lyrics that I know (which is weird - I hardly ever know the songs people post) but a month ago if I'd mentioned any of those songs or artists no one would have heard of them. Hannah, you trendsetter, you. Not really. I just like to think so.   Talking of people I like to think I discovered: Norah Jones' new CD comes out on the tenth. Excitement!  Nothing is original anymore. And it saddens me.

      It's fun to Google your own name. There's never much for me, of course, but I did stumble across a few things. I had forgotten that in seventh grade I won a silver medal in a regional French poetry reciting competition, but I found a website that listed my name. There were a few other academic award things on there, like the Duke Tip program and some smaller school awards.   But by far the nicest thing was something Scribe put up on  urlLink her profile at fictionpress.com  under the "Thanks" section.    Hannah, my pet freshie and goddess of advisory smiles, thank you so much for reigning in my evil desires to overuse the semicolon and the dash. You're right - a little goes a long way. (I did it on purpose! Ha!)    Thank you Scribe. I love you, too. (And notice - no semicolon or dash. Oh wait. Oops.)

      Today... today was a good day.   - A certain teacher tried to explain/understand/repeat some of the stuff that happened at the Kant discussion and failed miserably. It was humorous and I laughed. A lot.  - Had a test in APES, and even though I probably spent very little time (read: 5 minutes in extended advisory) looking over the notes, I think I may very well have done well, and maybe even gotten an A. It's an annoying class, but hey, it has its advantages.  - After talking to Madame Poirier about my French plans for the next two years, she's going to let me go to AP French next year. YEAH! As many people in my fourth period Chemistry class soon found out, I was ecstatic. It was good.  - Chemistry was fun. Duh. And Mr. Grunden signed me off to take AP Chem next year, which (although it was pretty expected and I honestly would have been surprised if he didn't) still made me very happy.  - Lunch was... lunch. No complaints. Talked to people and it was fun.  - Got our GoPo test back today and I did very well. Always puts me in a good mood when I do well on those tests.  - Math was fun as usual. I'm going to have to try and enjoy those classes more now because I found out yesterday that Mrs. Scicinska is leaving at the end of the year. (It's becoming a trend - my cool teachers leave me at the end of the year.) But the cool thing is that she's moving out to the area in California where my grandparents live, so we may even get to see each other. Which would be pretty cool.  - Just got home from Wellspring. (I'm sorry, I refuse to call it Whole Foods. It's too generic a name for so cool a place.) I always love going there. About half the people know me by face, and some of them even know me by name. It's a fun fun place.   Plans for tonight: homework and practice. That's all. Yay... relaxation.

      Life is funny. Elliot Smith has an uncanny knack of playing the soundtrack to my life. Today's theme song:   Elliott Smith - Rose Parade   They asked me to come down and watch the parade And to march down the street like the duracell bunny With a wink and a wave from the cavalcade Throwing out candy that looks like money To people passing by that all seem to be going the other way Said won’t you follow me down to the rose parade?   Tripped over a dog in a choke-chain collar People were shouting and pushing and saying And when I traded a smoke for a food stamp dollar A ridiculous marching band started playing And got me singing along with some half-hearted victory song Won’t you follow me down to the rose parade?  Won’t you follow me down to the rose parade?  Won’t you follow me down to the rose parade?   The trumpet has obviously been drinking Because he’s fucking up even the simplest lines I’d say it’s a sight that’s quite worth seeing It’s just that everyone’s interest is stronger than mine And when they clean the street I’ll be the only shit that’s left behind Won’t you follow me down to the rose parade?  Won’t you follow me down to the rose parade?  Won’t you follow me down to the rose parade?

      My paper's done! YAY! Now I just have to edit it and I'll be done. I would edit it in the car tomorrow, but alas, our printer is out of ink. Blast. Oh well - it shouldn't take me too long.   I'm pretty happy with it. Five pages and ten footnotes, as well as a page-long bibliography. Ah, footnotes make me smile.

      So with all this talk about the GoPo paper, I realized it would probably be appropriate to at least outline what it's on.   The assignment for the paper is to choose a Supreme Court case from the past 50 years that we think was decided wrongly and to explain why it was wrong. I chose a case from 1971 called  Cohen v. California . The case centers around a young man in California who, in protest of the Vietnam War and the draft, wore a jacket that read, "F--- the Draft, End the War" (except without the dashes). In doing so he violated a California anti-obscenity statute and was arrested. He sued and the case made it all the way to the Supreme Court. The court ruled in a 5-4 decision that the California statute was unconstitutional and that Cohen should not have been arrested. I, therefore, have to argue that the law was constitutional.   In my paper I get to cite two other important cases:  Schenck v. United States  (which all GoPo students should remember is the one with the Espionage Act of 1917) and another case called  Chaplinksy v. New Hampshire  which also involves public obscenities. In addition, I'm also citing a number of articles from mostly conservative magazines about all the negative social effects this case has had.   This is so fun - I love writing from the conservative point of view. I usually take the liberal one, but I wanted to be different this time and try it from the other side. I'm loving it.

      The GoPo paper:   It's now about halfway done. All (and probably more than was necessary) research is done. Bibliography is nearly done. Writing is maybe a third done. But it's generally outlined, so the rest of it should be decently easy.   I'm such a nerd - I really like writing papers.   Dinner was lovely. We had Mrs. Scicinska over, and she brought a bunch of her maps and aerial pictures of England and gave us a general picture of what it's like and where we should go. I'm so excited about a potential trip this summer. And now that I've got my mom all jazzed up as well it's even more likely to happen. Yay!   We also got to have Pasta y Fagioli soup and my chocolate brownies with peppermint frosting. Mmm, good stuff. I am full and happy.

      Well, it had to happen sometime. All that wonderful-day energy had to come out somewhere. And it came out this morning. At Third Place.   Rich has sold it. He has sold my gem of a hangout. The Third Place is now under new ownership.  When I found out, I nearly cried. Rich is my buddy, my pal. He was so cool. And I'll probably never see him again. Nor will I ever again have the perfect chai that he would so graciously concoct for me. I was very sad about the whole thing. Still am, as a matter of fact. I'll miss him a lot.   But other than that, things went quite well today. It was a Flex, so I saw "Gallipoli" and had the sophomore math activity. "Gallipoli" was depressing as hell, and I cried a little. (OK, more than a little.) The afternoon was a lot of fun - we mostly just got to draw on beach balls and make bubbles. I enjoyed myself thoroughly.   The incident this morning still put a bit of a cloud over the rest of my day.   Thank you, Rich, for everything you have given me. You will be sorely missed.

      It was! Another happy day! Wheeeeee!  I haven't a clue why I'm in such a good mood lately. I think it could have something to do with my two (read it - two!) full nights of sleep in a row. Mmm, sleep makes me happy.   It's also probably a general concentration of happy things in the past few days.  Such as today... - In Chemistry, got my solution dead on. Yeargh! - Did fairly well on GoPo test(s) - Guitar went mad-crazy well - I know my piece! First time in history! - Did I mention sleep already?  Plus my built-up karma from having such crappy days the past couple weeks probably helped.   It's good.  And happy.   Also: Shopaholic #4 comes out June 1 (as Emily so kindly reminded me). Smiles!  And there are still cookies. Does it get much better?

      Today is shaping up to be one of the BEST DAYS IN RECENT MEMORY.  - I got to take a nap during English because it was just a reading day and I'd already finished the book. It was nice.  - Got my letter about being a co-chair of a committee next year for SLA. I'm in! YEARGH! I will be co-chairing the Commerce, Science, and Technology Committee along with the honorable and distinguishable  urlLink Will . I am very very  very  excited.  - In APES we were assigned a group project (I think it was something about energy... whatever) in which Ms. Brongo would be assigning us groups. I was very nervous - I have a funny knack for getting stuck in a really bad group in these kinds of things. Fortunately, I ended up in a group with  urlLink Kit ,  urlLink Claire , and Carla, whom I would have been with if we could have chosen our own groups anyway.  - Mme. Poirier wasn't feeling very well, so she went to lay down in the teacher's lounge while Dr. Humble, possibly the coolest person on the planet, came and taught the first part of our class. It was awesome. He's so so cool. Then Mme. Ivy came and taught the second part of our class, and she was amazing, too. It was so nice to hear a real French accent for once. She's also really sweet and funny and made the class quite enjoyable.  - Chemistry was good. (By definition.) - No one showed up for our French tutoring session, so I got to go play outside for lunch.  - We took a practice AP test in GoPo, and (knock on wood) I don't think it was as hard as I anticipated. I know I need to study - there were a few questions that I didn't have a clue on - but other than that I didn't think it was too too bad.  - Math test was easy. Yay.  - Went to Wellspring and saw my favorite meat-counter guy. He's really fun.  - I went to the bakery section to get some bread, and the guy behind the counter saw me and said, "Sourdough loaf? Sliced?" It was so cool - he totally knew me. It made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.  - Now I'm home and the only real homework I have is Chemistry. I also have to practice guitar, but that's not too bad. I'm in a really really good mood.

      I've been meaning to post this for a while. I was in the computer lab one day, and since I'd finished all my work, I started browsing the files people had left on the desktop. I found this, and was greatly amused.    As he walked through the streets of Manhattan he noticed the many people who had turned to stone. He wondered why this was happening and wondered if there was anything he could do about it. He walked through the streets being aware of all his surroundings be careful with his every step. He heared screaming in the backround and went to find out what was happening. To his surprise when he turned around he saw the back of this huge “statue” walking around glaring at people once she stared at them for about 30 seconds she went of on her way to spot a new victim. He glanced around looking for a booth of some sort, he found one and darted into it. He picked up the phone and said trouble and he immediately transformed himself to a super hero.

      Today was pretty lovely as days go.   - Got my Chemistry test back. Smiles.  - Tried on some more YLA outfits. I have all my clothes now and have them all divided up into outfits. Don't laugh at me - this is really fun. All I have left to do is coordinate jewelry and I'll be done. I already have one outfit totally finished, so it's only two more to go. Plus casual outfits, but I have a funny feeling not too much effort will be made on those. Either way, it's fun.  - Found some funny old music I hadn't listened to in a long time. Man, I used to have really bad taste.  - Did all my homework really quickly, so I basically got to hang out for the rest of the afternoon.  - Went with my dad to Third Place to chat and sip a long-needed chai. We had a really lovely conversation. I love my dad.  - Watched The Daily Show. I  - I plan on going to bed really early tonight. Mmm, sleep. It's good stuff.   Anything bad things that happened today (i.e. failing a French test and taking a GoPo test) pale in comparison with how good the rest of my day was. I'm vastly contented right about now. Is it the chocolate and chai or am I really happy? We'll never know. But I couldn't care less.

      I got into a fight with my mom. Huge fight. It started over nothing, but before we knew it we were furious at each other. There was lots of screaming, sobbing, and even some throwing things. It lasted about two hours. Then we both cried some, apologized, hugged, and now it's over. Sigh. We haven't had this good a row in a long time. We had it coming to us. We're way too similar for our own good.

       An Exploration in How To Avoid Speaking French At All Costs (aka the Valdese Trip)   - Friday was a Flex day. I had ethics in the morning and was pleasantly surprised when it really wasn't that bad.  - At noon the French III classes piled into cars and started the three-and-a-half hour drive to Valdese, a small town near the mountains, just eight miles outside of Morganton. I was in a car with Claire, Maggie, and Mrs. Lamb. The drive was pretty fun - we mostly just talked and joked around (in English of course) but because we had to stop and get gas we were the last car to arrive at the site.  - We arrived, as I mentioned, at the Trail of Faith in Valdese, an exhibit in which a group of volunteers constructed exact replicas of many of the historical sites in the original settling area of the Waldensians in the Alps between France and Italy. We took a guided tour through the site and learned about Waldensian history. We saw some of the original homes they lived in and some interesting replicas of the caves they worshiped in.   A Brief History Note : The Waldensians were a group of French evangelical protestants who were heavily persecuted and eventually driven to live in the rocky terrain in between France and Italy. They survived there for several hundred years, but facing more persecution they decided to move a large number of their population to the American continents. Settlements were established in, among other places, Argentina, Chicago, New York, and the town of Valdese in rural North Carolina. Valdese is the longest surviving town that still has people of original Waldensian heritage.   - After the Trail of Faith, we returned to the hotel in Morganton where we dumped our things. We returned to Valdese and had dinner at a mediocre Italian place. Our table was lucky enough to have Mme. Poirier sitting with us, so we were the only group that actually had to speak French. Lucky us. It really wasn't that bad.  - We went back to the hotel and were allowed to hang around until 10:00. A groups of girls decided to play Cranium, and we had a lot of fun.  - I roomed with Elizabeth and her mother. Apparently I talked in my sleep. Sorry, guys.  - The next morning we woke up and ate the plastic food the hotel had provided for us. It was free. No complaints. Mme. Poirier also informed us that we would have to speak more French today than yesterday, since our group at dinner was really the only group that did. Fortunately, our table was pretty much off the hook for the rest of the day, so it didn't make that much of a difference.  - We drove back to Valdese and visited the Waldensian museum. It was pretty interesting - most of the exhibits had to do with the Waldensian settlement in North Carolina instead of the French and Italian history we had gotten up until then. There was a Bible that had survived through fire and many travels from the early 1500s that Ms. Greenwalt found particularly fascinating. Our tour guide was also very funny and made the whole thing that much better.  - After the museum we visited the Waldensian church right down the street. There wasn't too much there and we didn't stay for long. It was a very pretty church, though.  - For lunch, we decided to get some sandwiches and drive out to a small waterfall just outside the town. It was very nice - the weather was lovely and the falls were quite pretty. We took lots of pictures, and Claire and I had fun on the swing set.  - We then got back in the cars and drove to the original Waldensian winery. This part was by far my favorite part of the whole trip. An older man, probably about 82 or 83, gave us a tour of the operations. It is hard to describe him without doing his voice and motions, but suffice to say he was  hilarious . We were all laughing out loud nearly the entire time. It was also fun to see how they made the wine, and to listen to our guide explain each and every way they were able to cut costs. So funny.  - Although we weren't allowed to sample the wine (even though our guide put up a good fight with Mme. Poirier), we did get to sample their sparkling grape juice. It was so so good. I bought a bottle and brought it back. We'll have it tonight with dinner.  - The men at the winery then taught us to play Bocci (Boules in French) and we played in the court behind the winery. It was a ton of fun, and we started getting pretty good towards the end.  - The winery was going to be hosting a wedding reception that afternoon, so we had to leave a little earlier than we'd planned. We got back in the cars and started the drive home. But on the way, we saw a billboard advertising a Russel Stover's outlet, so we stopped and bought some really cheap chocolate. It was very tasty.  - Our car was the last to arrive back at school around 6:15. All in all it had been a wonderful trip, but I was still eager to get back to my cats and my bed.

      I just heard Eric Clapton's song, "Tears in Heaven," from all the way across the house. I immediately started crying. That song has way too much of an effect on me. I need to stop listening to it.   In case anyone doesn't know the song, here are the lyrics.    Tears in Heaven  Would you know my name If I saw you in heaven? Would it be the same If I saw you in heaven?  I must be strong And carry on, 'Cause I know I don't belong Here in heaven.  Would you hold my hand If I saw you in heaven? Would you help me stand If I saw you in heaven?  I'll find my way Through night and day, 'Cause I know I just can't stay Here in heaven.  Time can bring you down, Time can bend your knees. Time can break your heart, Have you begging please, begging please.  Beyond the door, There's peace I'm sure, And I know there'll be no more Tears in heaven.  Would you know my name If I saw you in heaven? Would it be the same If I saw you in heaven?  I must be strong And carry on, 'Cause I know I don't belong Here in heaven.   - Eric Clapton

      So. Not much to write about, really. Life is... life, and everything's OK. Can't complain.   Oh, except that my interview to be an SLA co-chair is tomorrow and I'm nervous. I really really want to be a co-chair but I know there were a TON of people who applied for just a few available positions. I'm scared. Even if I don't get to be a co-chair I'll still be a delegate, but I think it would be a lot more fun to have some power in the hierarchy. Mmm, power. It really is the ultimate aphrodisiac.   And before I forget, happy day-after-the-Ides-of-March.

      I'm getting worried about colleges. (Don't tell me I'm only a sophomore. I know this. I'm paranoid.) The only colleges I've looked at that I really really like are mad-crazy high end, like Princeton, Stanford, Brown, Harvard, et al. I don't know what I'm going to do if I don't get into one of these schools. They're so wonderful, and nothing else I've seen out of the colleges I have a decent chance of getting into are any good. Witness:  urlLink Harvard's history program  kicks serious history program ass. Stanford's  urlLink History, Literature, and the Arts curriculum  is cool beyond reasonable measure. And don't even get me started on  urlLink Princeton's religion department  (scroll down to "REL - Religion" and click "Search"). So so pretty... not to mention absolutely perfect in every possible imaginable way. I haven't found any mid-level schools that even come moderately close to matching these kind of programs. So far William and Mary, Tufts, UVA and UNC are my best options, but even UVA is really hard to get into and the others have some pretty serious faults. I need to apply  somewhere  I have at least a half-way decent shot of getting into. I'm scared.

      So. Lots of stuff has happened over the past few days. A brief recap is probably in order.   - Friday night, went prom dress shopping with Kit, Claire, and Elena. It was much more fun knowing that I already had a dress and all the trappings that go with it. Either way, making fun of all the skanky dresses was muchos gratifying.  - Got my packet from YLA. I'm on the Judiciary Committee. Yay! It's the one I wanted the most, and I get to be with people I know. Smiles! - Saturday, worked my tail off. Finished almost all my homework, did all my chores, and cooked dinner. Whew. I was in the mood to work, though, so it really wasn't bad at all. I was glad to get everything over-with.  - Slept in this morning. Mmm. Sleep is good.  - Went through catalogs with my mother to find some more YLA pants. Ordered two pairs: black and khaki. The most comforting thing about the whole process was I pretty much knew they were going to fit me because I already own one pair. They're a little short for me, but we ordered a longer hem this time. Sweet. All I needed now was one more shirt, and I would be done.  - Went to  urlLink Target  to look for a YLA purse. I was hoping to find a cute little red retro one, and I did! It's absolutely perfect, and I was very pleased. (It was also on sale for $14.99. Not bad at all.)  - While wandering through the clothing section, I stumbled across some business-y blouses. I tried one particularly cute one on, and what do you know? It fit! And it gets better - it was also on sale for $16.99! I was very very happy. Now all my YLA shopping is done, I'm on the committee I wanted, and I didn't have to spend too much. I am a happy happy child.  - Now I'm home, and pretty much all I have to do the rest of today is some more studying and... that's it. Excellent. Hannah gets to go to bed early again.

      An interesting link from  urlLink Mr. Grunden's blog . A LiveJournal written from the perspective of the, er,  urlLink rather ditzy Mars rover, Opportunity . It's pretty good.   There is something really wonderful about those nights where you come home, take a walk, finish all your homework, and all you have left to do is read about 15 pages worth of Nietzsche. Mmm, rest...  Please also note: There is a new link on the sidebar entitled "Cute Kitten Generator." I linked to it once before a few weeks ago, but now it's permanent. Go there and marvel in the cute-kitten-ness.   Definitely have a French test tomorrow. Definitely didn't bring my textbook home. Definitely don't care.   I need a weekend. Bad. Someone please make sure tomorrow goes quickly.

      After much delay, an update:   - This has been a busy week - I've had a test every day except Monday, and I will have another test on Thursday and another on Friday. These past two weeks have been kind of tough (last week especially was really emotionally draining), but I think once I get through this week I should have a while to relax. I'm really looking forward to it.  - My guitar teacher stuck his fingernail file in the light-switch and managed not to get electrocuted. He did, however, destroy a breaker knocking out electricity to a large part of the building and fry the end of his file to a crisp. It was pretty entertaining.  - This afternoon my mom and I went to JC Penny's to look at some blouses she and my sister had seen the last time they were there. I made perhaps the most successful shopping trip in recent memory. I found not one but TWO things that fit me! (OK, so they were the same thing in different colors. Let me be happy - this is a first.) And it gets better! They were perfect, and I mean Perfect with a capital "P," for legislative outfits. But it doesn't stop there! They were ON SALE! How beautiful is this! I nearly cried I was so happy. It was a wonderful moment.  - Environmental Science is actually starting to evolve into a science class. Ms. Brongo isn't nearly as political as Mrs. Nelson was, and it's really a breath of fresh air. We're memorizing chemical processes instead of all the reasons why Reagan is the devil. It shouldn't be this shocking that a science class teaches us (gasp) science, but there it is. Either way, it's definitely better now.   In other news, I   We should...   Write a campaign ad in which we make deliberately malicious and false statements, burn crosses, show graphic sexual acts and incite people to immediate violence (posing a clear and present danger) and then show the ad in a school really loudly at 3:00 in the morning in order to disturb the neighbors.   It will be fun.

      The Uglies. A terrible condition in which nothing works. Your hair absolutely refuses to do that cute thing it did all on its own a couple days ago, even with various topical chemicals those random red spots on your face just won't go away, and no matter how flattering your clothes are you can't manage to find an outfit that doesn't make you want to scream when you look in the mirror. My friends, I am currently being invaded by The Uglies.   How does one remedy this terrible illness? As I see it there are two solutions.   1. Don't do anything. Lounge around all day in your ugliness and enjoy the time spent away from all other people. There's no point in trying to make yourself presentable today, so why not get out all that ugly energy in one fell swoop? Although it may not be the prettiest thing, one ugly day every month or so is good for your health.   Normally this is what I do, especially if I'm lucky enough for my Ugly Day to fall on a weekend. But it was far too beautiful out today. The daffodils were out, and there was no way I was going to be kept indoors by The Uglies. I therefore resorted to Solution #2:   2. Make yourself pretty. Pull out that prom dress that's been sitting in your closet since you bought it in January and put it on. Get all dolled up while you're at it - put on some jewelry and perhaps even some makeup. If you have a pretty dress on, those spots on your face and your hair that refuses to cooperate will suddenly be less noticeable. After you've done that, why not get out that really cute pink summer dress and put that on, too. When all your pretty clothes are put back in the closet, put back on your normal clothes (don't look in the mirror - it will most likely reverse the whole process) and have a nice cup of tea with a girly book. I highly recommend  urlLink "Confessions of a Shopaholic" by Sophie Kinsella . Relax for a while, and remember that although you are ugly on the outside, there is no need for your inner-pretty to go away. Perhaps one day soon it will resurface again. Until then, think pretty thoughts and remember that while it's what on the inside that counts, a pretty dress now and then never hurt anyone.

      We just watched "Secondhand Lions." Stupid movie. Don't watch it. It was kind of cute, but not even extraordinarily cute, just blah cute. There was one big highlight, though. At the very end,  urlLink there was this . Made it all worth it. (This picture is actually from "Sweet Home Alabama" - another silly movie - but it was the best one I could find.)

      Today, Kit and I worked on our assignment for APES. We wrote a series of (you guessed it) haikus for our poem, and made a  urlLink totally awesome cartoon . Check it out, it's really cool.

      Today in APES, we had an assignment to draw a cartoon and write a poem about a scientific study on the detrimental effects of UV radiation on aquatic life. Inspired by the idea of writing poetry (something I normally loathe), I spontaneously wrote a haiku about the environmental science curriculum. It made Kit cry she was laughing so hard.    The Environmental Science Haiku  Save the earth because They are trying to kill it.  Republicans suck.   It was much fun. I then decided, why not write another? I was inspired by the very accurate words of Carla, whose quote you see in the second line.   Lots of useless work.  "Blow up the whole f***ing earth."  That's how I feel, too.   In my other classes, I wrote some more. (The second line of the first one translates as, "What makes you angry?")   French class is boring.  "Qu'est-ce qui te met en collère?" Take a wild guess.   Three classes over.  Now I go to Chemistry.  Pretty double bonds.   And one about the philosophy discussion today after school:   Ayn Rand discussion Philosophical bitch-fest  Two things that match well.   My incessant haiku-writing has infected some other people as well - Kit wrote some really good ones in her English class.   I think it pretty much goes without saying that as all this was going on, very little environmental science was actually happening. Teachers really should know better by now than to give me and Kit an assignment to write funny poetry and draw stick figure cartoons. (Ms. Edmundson learned that one last year the hard way.) Put it this way: We wrote a sonnet about fish dying, and had a French stick-man representing UV rays shouting, "Fire zee missiles!" It was one of the most fun classes I've had in a long long time.

      I counted. Between now and the end of the year, there will be (at most) three weeks during which I will not be stressed, angry, or upset about something, school or otherwise. This is all together way too much to handle. I need some time off.   That feeling I had about a week ago? The one where I wanted to curl up in a ball in a corner and stay there until eternity? Yeah, it's back. Dammit.

      Today:  - Writing test. Blech. Stupid.  - Had to miss Chemistry. Makes me angry.  - Squonk things upset me. Go figure.   Today was not so hot a day. Oh well. Nothing that a little sleep and some chocolate can't remedy. And Thursday is the National French Exam, so I get to miss first and second periods (sweet). I did really well on that test last year - I came in fifth in the state - but not quite well enough to win anything good. Just a medal and some certificates. But if I do better, I could win either some cash or a trip to Paris! How cool would that be! Probably won't happen, but I'm OK with that. It's just more stuff to put on that college application of mine.   Talking of which, the list of colleges is getting interesting.  Number that I'm kind of looking at right now: 9.  Number of those that I actually have interest in going to: 5.  Number that I have a halfway decent chance of getting into: 3 Number of the ones I have interest in that I have a halfway decent chance of getting into: 1. It's good.    The List  (kind of in order, but not really)  Stanford Princeton Brown Tufts Columbia Georgetown UVA  UNC William and Mary  Mmm, Stanford. Mmm, Princeton. Mmm, Brown. I would kill to go to any of those schools. Alas. I'll settle for something smaller.

      Yesterday I was listening to This American Life on NPR and Sarah Vowell came on with this hilarious story about growing up with her gun-loving father. To listen to the whole show, go  urlLink here  and scroll down to "Last Week." You can click on the icons on top to open the audio file. Skip the first four minutes or so - it's just an introduction. The story is the first one after the intro. The rest of the broadcast wasn't anything out of the ordinary, but the Sarah Vowell story was hilarious and very poignant. Laugh really loud when you're listening to it. It makes it even funnier.

      Following Danielle's example, I started writing in random words in blogspot addresses. I found some kind of good ones, and even one in Spanish. My favorite, though, was when I typed in "chocolatelover.blogspot.com" and got  urlLink this : a blog that was only posted on twice and hasn't been updated since, you guessed it, August 2, 2002. Ah, the tragedy of a lost and almost forgotten blog. And such it would have been forever if not for me. Now I can sleep peacefully - I have done some good in the world.

      While I was cleaning out my shelves, I found all these mix CDs from when I was a loser Napster user (pre-iTunes) with lots of funny songs that I apparently liked a few years ago. Good lord, I had bad taste. It's kind of fun to listen to it though. Some of them are pretty decent, or if not decent, at least fun. Like Seven and the Sun, "Walk With Me." It's cute and upbeat, and brings back lots of fun memories of dancing in the car.   But my favorite song so far is probably Trik Turner, "Friends and Family." Our drama class in eighth grade used that song as the intro music to our year-long project of writing, producing, and acting in a soap opera. Molly and I were the writers, and I also played one of the principal characters. It was a good project. Our drama teacher was also really really cool, and made the whole thing way more fun than it would have been otherwise. So Mr. Matthews, if you're out there, thanks. We love you.

      Got the Josh Kelley CD. It's lovely. Thirteen tracks, plus four bonus ones on a separate EP. Mmm, pretty new music makes me smile.   The APES final was much easier than I expected. Not only was the actual test mind bogglingly straightforward, but the grading curve added a much appreciated confidence boost. (As long as you get at least 36 of the 75 questions right, you get an A. Sweet life.) I'm glad I didn't over-stress.   My grandparents arrive at 10:00 tonight. I am excited to see them, but at the same time being around them (and around my parents around them) can be really exhausting. Tomorrow, for instance, we are waking up at an ungodly hour to drive to Wilmington. After the two hour drive, we drop my sister off at her All-State rehearsal and then have to spend the rest of the day wandering around Wilmington. Since my grandparents have never been there, and because my grandma in particular has a freakishly high energy level, I can guarantee we'll be trekking around whatever there is down there. Then we go to the concert in the evening and still have to shlep all the way home before I can crash on my sister's room's floor. (The grandparents are sleeping in my room.) Sunday my sister and I will spend most of the day - a solid five hours minimum - making dinner. Trust me, homemade dim sum takes one hell of a lot longer than you think it does. Then the week starts again, and I know with this combination of illness and company I'm going to burn out sometime around Wednesday. Be forewarned.   Anyway, I shouldn't complain. It's really not bad at all. I've got pretty music playing in the background, family is coming, I've been booted out of my room, I'm still sick... I think I'll just stop before I talk myself in a circle.   Talking of strange things, (were we? Oh, oops.) I've run into a crazy number of people in strange places today. It's uncanny.  In Wellspring: - Mrs. Scicinska - Nancy and Joseph, who used to live down the street from us - Mrs. Scicinska found someone my mom met once, and introduced us In Borders: - Mrs. Martin, my math teacher from eighth grade  It's a mad mad world.

      This is what happens when my sister asks me (on LOTS of cold meds) for help with her science homework. She had to write a poem about the digestive system. I realize the iambic pentameter isn't perfect, but hey, it's about the digestive system. Cut me some slack. I now present you with...   Ode to the Digestive System   System of digstion, how I love you, And all your peristalsis processes. Your sphincters that connect things, they are two, And let food move through your system with ease. But first we meet the salivary glands, Where we break down the polysaccharides, Through the esophagus with muscle bands, To the stomach where food goes for a ride. Duodenum - a funny word it is, For the first part of the small intestine, Then to the large intenstine, where its “biz” Is to absorb the water still within.      Then finally our journey comes to end,      When out the rectum food waste does descend.

      So watching Jon Stewart a while ago ( . I immediately rushed to iTunes, and lo and behold, they had him. Unfortunately, they do not carry the entire album (it's missing two songs) and since the list price for the album is quite a bit lower than normal, I'm thinking this is a rare opportunity to buy the actual CD for less than it would cost me on iTunes. Shocking, I know. But partially in gratitude for all the wonderful things iTunes has done for me, and mostly because I had genuine interest, I did purchase their exclusive acoustic version of "Amazing." It is absolutely lovely. So if you're like me and all your old CDs are getting worn out from extensive play and you are  dying  for some new rhythms, I suggest you give Josh Kelley a try. I promise you won't be disappointed.   P.S. Although I shall try my best, the grandparental units are coming into town tomorrow evening, and due to their visit, posting will most likely be at a minimum. I shall try, however, to keep my loyal visitors (ha) updated on the progress of my seemingly never-ending illness and the status of my work and exam schedule.   P.P.S. For my loyal visitors (ha): I'm not feeling much better. I'm currently on... hang on... four drugs and they are all making me woozy. Trust me, it's a lot harder typing when you can see two keyboards. I'm nervous about the APES final tomorrow, but not worried. (Does that make sense? No. Blame the meds.) I shall try to post more later, and hopefully then it will not only be better news, but also coherent. Freaky.

      Things That Are Over: - This week! - APES tests! - GoPo tests! - Incredibly sick feeling! (Replaced with slightly-less-sick feeling)  Now we just have to make it through the APES final (it's next Friday, folks), the AP exams (mine are both in three weeks), and finals (five weeks from now). Not good. But once that's all over - summer!   Is there such a thing as sophomore-itis? If there is, I think I have it. Work hasn't really been happening lately. Wednesday night, I came home and  literally  did not open my bag at all to do homework. I am so ready for summer. Mmm, sleep. It's a good thing.   Tonight is prom. Although I doubt anyone who's going will read this tonight because they'll be too busy getting ready, I hope they all have a wonderful time. I get to go out to dinner with some friends, so I'm very happy about that.   I leave you with the song currently playing in my room:    All I Need  Everywhere someone's getting over  Everybody cries  And sometimes you can still lose even if you really try  Talking about the dream  Like the dream is over  Talk like that  Won't get you nowhere  Everybody's trusting in the heart  Like the heart don't lie  - Matchbox Twenty

      I'm sick. I'm tired. I don't like being either one.   I also don't like having to study for two big tests tomorrow. Plus write a composition. Plus reading. Ick.  The good news: Five weeks and one day until summer. Sweet.   The bad news: Between now and then (in order), APES final, AP exams, rest of finals. Sickness and tiredness.   I feel really really gross right now.

       Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.   I can hear the soft breathing Of the girl that I love As she lies here beside me Asleep with the night And her hair, in a fine mist Floats on my pillow, Reflecting the glow Of the winter moonlight.  She is soft, she is warm, But my heart remains heavy And I watch as her breasts Gently rise, gently fall For I know with the first light of dawn I'll be leaving, And tonight will be All I have left to recall.  Oh, what have I done? Why have I done it? I've committed a crime, I've broken the law. For twenty-five dollars And pieces of silver, I held up and robbed A hard liquor store.  My life seems unreal, My crime an illusion A scene badly written In which I must play. Yet I know as I gaze At my young love beside me, The morning is just a few hours away.    - Simon and Garfunkel

      I have a couple things to say to Diane Keaton.   1. Don't try to keep playing Annie Hall when you're sixty. It doesn't work. Find a new character.  2. The choice between a grumpy old Jack Nicholson and a (relatively speaking) good-looking guy in jeans is  not  a hard one to make. When you have Keanu Reeves chasing you around your house, the intelligent thing to do is not to blow him off and go for the grumpy old guy who keeps having heart attacks.   Yeah, I just saw  Something's Gotta Give . It was terrible. If you haven't seen it yet, spare yourself the pain and don't. You don't need to picture Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson getting it on, much less see it on film. It's disturbing. Even fast-forwarded, it freaked me out.   But I also saw  Manhattan , and that is a great movie. This one you should all see, if you haven't already.  Something's Gotta Give  tried to steal a lot of the themes from that movie, but alas, it failed. It was painful. Don't watch it.

      You want more? I'll give you more.  This is a sampling (just a  sampling ) of the Religion department.    REL 363 Perspectives on Religious Ethics: Recent Philosophy  (EM)  Enrollment by application or interview. Departmental permission required. Maximum Enrollment: 15  Professor(s):  Jeffrey L. Stout    Description/Objectives:   This seminar will examine philosophical accounts of what it means to live well, focusing mainly on works written in the last half century that are relevant to issues in religious ethics: whether morality requires a religious foundation, the ethical significance of divine commandments, and the concepts of virtue, goodness, evil, horror, holiness, sainthood, faith, and the sacred.   ---   REL 242/ JDS 242 Jewish Thought and Modern Society  (EM)     No Audit  Professor(s):  Leora F. Batnitzky    Description/Objectives:   What is Judaism's, and the individual Jew's, relation to the modern world? Is Judaism a religion, a nationality, an ethnicity, or a combination of these? This course explores different answers to these questions by examining various historical and cultural formations of Jewish identity in Europe, America, and Israel from the seventeenth century to the present, as well as by engaging particular issues, such as Judaism's relation to technology, the environment, bioethics, feminism, and democracy.   ---   REL 245/ JDS 245 Jewish Mysticism: From the Beginnings to Kabbala  (HA)  Professor(s):  Peter Schäfer    Description/Objectives:  The Kabbalah, the summit of Jewish mysticism, is among the most revolutionary innovations in the history of Judaism. It transforms the single, static (and essentially male) God of biblical and rabbinic Judaism into a dynamic and multifaceted God, whose rich inner life can be explored -- and influenced -- by human beings. This course follows the historical development of Jewish mysticism from its early beginnings and examines its major themes, e.g., God, his female aspect, creation, good and evil, redemption, and mystical union.  ---   REL 252 The Early Christian Movement  (HA)     No Audit  Professor(s):  Elaine H. Pagels [!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!]   Description/Objectives:   Investigation of gnostic gospels and other writings and their significance for understandings of the origin of Christianity. Topics include: conflicting interpretations of Jesus and Paul and their messages; human nature; the origin of the universe; religious experience; sexuality; and organizational politics.   ---   POL 309/ REL 309 Politics and Religion  (EM)  Maximum Enrollment: 155  Professor(s):  Maurizio Viroli    Description/Objectives:   Close study of a number of texts that have illuminated the connection between religiosity and politics, and, in particular, the role of religious language and ideas to establish, preserve, reform, and redeem republics. Special attention will be given to the religious dimensions of revolutionary and messianic politics, and to the role that religiosity has played in the development of contemporary social movements and in the moral and political resistance to totalitarian regimes. Two lectures, one preceptorial.  ---   AMS 362/ REL 366 American Spirituality from Transcendentalism to the New Age  (SA)     na, npdf  Enrollment by application or interview. Departmental permission required. Maximum Enrollment: 15  Professor(s):  Leigh E. Schmidt    Description/Objectives:   A history of the formation of spirituality in American culture from the Transcendentalist world of Emerson, Thoreau and Whitman to Theosophy and New Thought on through contemporary expressions. Topics to be emphasized: mysticism, nature and solitude, meditation, eclecticism, cosmopolitanism, and individualism. Is the "new spirituality" really new? Is it a subversion of authentic Christianity? Is it dangerously self-absorbed? Is it a model for a religiously plural and democratic society?   ---   REL 502 Philosophy and the Study of Religion  */NC  Maximum Enrollment: 20  Professor(s):  Jeffrey L. Stout    Description/Objectives:   This course examines the impact of twentieth-century philosophical ideas on the academic study of religion. It gives attention to naturalism, phenomenology, hermeneutics, structuralism, Nietzschean genealogy, and American pragmatism, among other philosophical movements.  ---   Again, this is only a tiny, tiny sampling of what they have.

      Found some pictures on the internet of Bellingham.        The first is the tulips I described. The second is the San Juan islands just offshore. We could see them from right near the hotel. They were lovely.     This is Mount Baker. And yes, it really is only an hour and a half away from the tulips. Cool, eh?

       The Trip   (I'm going to make a valiant effort not to use bullets in this post. It will probably fail anyway. We shall see.)  From Wednesday until Sunday, my family was in a small town in Washington called Bellingham, and the village within known as Fairhaven. It's a sweet little town very close to the Canadian border. Fairhaven used to be a separate town, but since both have grown, they joined up to become one larger city - although it's probably still not big enough to be called a city.   Our traveling began very early on Wednesday morning, and aside from almost missing our first plane because we missed the bus, everything went as smoothly as could be expected. I worked on homework. A lot. We arrived at the Seattle-Tacoma airport and rented a car. The car we got had not been filled with gas, so one of the attendants came over and filled it up for us. He was lots of fun. We got in the car and drove to Bellingham. The normal route would have taken just over an hour, but my parents wanted to take the scenic Chuckanut Drive that follows the coast, so it took a good bit longer than that. I slept most of the time.   We finally got to Bellingham. We drove around in a neighborhood for a while (very cute, I might add) and then went to Fairhaven to check into our hotel. I was shocked. From where I was sitting, the village was a dump. It looked messy and gross, nothing like the cute little village my dad had described. I was totally dismayed. But we got to the hotel - a very sweet little inn - and dropped our things in the room. By that time we were starving, so we went to eat at a cafe that was attached to a bookstore. It was quite tasty.   After eating, we walked around the town a little bit. I was shocked to see that on the actual ground, the town didn't look nearly as bad as from the car. In fact, it was kind of cute. There were a bunch of little shops and restaurants and even a little park in the middle that faced a large building that had a big white square painted on it. My dad informed me that in the summers they project movies onto the screen and people come to watch them. Slowly but surely I was falling for this little town.   We adjourned back to the hotel and went to bed. I hardly slept. I don't know why.   The next morning we got up and ate breakfast at this darling place called the Harris Avenue Cafe. I can't say enough good things about it. We then decided to walk around Western Washington University, just a short ways outside of Bellingham. It was kind of ugly. Too much concrete and really grungy-looking kids. I didn't like it much at all. Afterwards, we drove another ways to an arboretum, where we climbed a tower and got a fantastic view of the shoreline and the San Juan islands just off shore. It was really beautiful.   For lunch, we went to a double-decker bus that was parked on the corner and had fish and chips. No, I'm not kidding. There really is an old double-decker bus - just like the ones in London - that sells fish and chips. And they're damn good, too.   We spent some time that afternoon walking around the harbor in the town. There was a lovely walk that traced the coast, but unfortunately a good chunk of it was under construction so we could only walk a small part of it. Either way, the weather was wonderful and we got to pet lots of cute dogs.   That evening, we discovered that  My Architect , a documentary that was nominated this year for an Academy Award and a film that my dad really wanted to see, was playing at a theatre in downtown Bellingham. We got in the car and drove over. It took us nearly fifteen minutes to find the place; silly us, we were looking for something that at least resembled a movie theatre. It turned out that it was basically a hole in the wall. We bought our tickets, and practically had to walk through the ticket booth to get to the theatre itself. It was an absolute crackup. There were a grand total of about 50 seats in the whole thing, and everyone there seemed to know everyone else. It was absolutely hilarious. On top of that, the movie was really great. If you haven't seen it, I would highly recommend it.   We went back to the hotel and to bed. Didn't sleep much again.   Friday morning I spent a good length of time working on homework. (Come to think of it, I spent a large part of my vacation working. Mrs. Newmark, I hope you're happy.) My aunt Jessica and my five-year old cousin Reagan, whom I had never met, arrived in the late morning. My aunt is an extremely critical person, and she almost immediately leapt on my hair. Yeah, that was fun. The six of us all went out to lunch at the Skylark Cafe and had quite an enjoyable meal.   Every April in the northwest corner of Washington, the tulips are all in bloom, and the people there hold a month-long tulip festival. We drove out a ways to see some tulips, and parked in a field with tulips of all different colors going on forever. It was truly a sight to see all those beautiful colors contrasted with the snow-capped Cascades in the background. It was really really beautiful.   We ate dinner at a restaurant on the water, and although the food was mediocre (except the salmon - obviously) the view of the marina was spectacular. There we said goodbye to my aunt and cousin, and returned to the hotel.   Saturday morning we ate again at the Harris Avenue Cafe. The waitress recognized us. It was cool. We also ran into some people who were also from North Carolina, and we chatted for a while. Soon after breakfast we drove out about an hour and a half to Mount Baker. It was incredible to see the transition - tulips to eight feet of snow. We got to the ski lodge and saw a huge number of people all skiing on the mountainside. It was really cool. We drove up another ways and came to another ski lodge, although this one was closed. We walked around in the snow for a while amongst the cross-country skiers and the snowshoers. It was the coolest thing to be in almost eight feet of snow and be so warm that all you need is a tee shirt. This was probably my favorite part of the whole trip. If nothing else, it made me realize that I really really need to learn how to ski.   We wandered back down the mountainside and stopped in a few places to be near the river and to take a short hike in the woods. It was quite pleasant.   Since none of us were really hungry, we just had some ice cream for lunch and then spent some time walking around Fairhaven. We went in a bunch of shops, and then retired back to the hotel to rest for a while.   For dinner, we walked a short ways to a restaurant called Coppa. This was  by far  my favorite meal of the trip. (Except maybe for the fish and chips.) We ordered a whole bunch of tapas and ate them together. My God, it was good. There was hummus and tabouleh and green salad and chickpea salad and another salad with raw calamari and crab dip and sausage with lamb and pork... suffice to say it was incredible. Wow.   The next morning we woke up freakishly early (4:30) and got in the car to drive back to Sea-Tac. We got on the plane and spent the whole day flying home. I worked on homework. Some more. Namely like four hours. As soon as we got home, I collapsed into bed and fell asleep. I'm still very jet lagged and have not yet adjusted to the time zone. Icky. But overall I had a very pleasant trip and was glad to have gone. Especially considering I was dreading the whole affair, it went really really well. Now all I have to do is cope with coming back to school.

      Some more legislative pickup lines:  - You can be my Youth Affair.  - I'm the chair of the Education Committee. We're drafting a new bill about re-instituting paddling in schools... wanna go try it out in my room? - I'll move your previous question all night long.  - I'd like to make a point of personal privilege out of you.   Again, if you have any more, let me know and I'll post them.

       The 2004 Youth Legislative Assembly Conference   Friday - I arrived at the Sheraton hotel, dropped off my things in a storage room on the third floor, and met people. Kit, Claire, Elena and I were all on the same committee (Judiciary) so we stuck together for much of the time. I met a guy named Matt, whom Kit had met over the summer at NC Teen Summit. He seemed nice, although just a little too conservative.  - We got on buses and were taken to the Legislative Office Building, where we held our opening ceremony. The Tri-Speakers made some announcements, and a woman (whose name I forget) gave a very long and boring speech.  - We adjourned to committee meetings to discuss the individual bills. Our bill was to allow the Ten Commandments and other non-specified religious articles pertaining to the history of law to be placed in the Supreme Court building, and to give other court buildings the option to do so as well. We had a consultant come in to talk with us about the finer points of the issue, and he was lots of fun. We amended the bill in a few key areas to play down the blatant unconstitutionality, but alas, it was still frighteningly unlawful.  - We returned to the hotel for free time. It took them a very very long time to get us our room keys, but eventually we got them and were able to put our things in the room. We relaxed for a while before dinner. - We went down to dinner in one of the ballrooms. The setup was quite beautiful - there were tables with candles and formal place settings. The food quality, however, did not justify the setting. Suffice to say I later regretted that I ate so much. But I was starving; what was one to do? There were a couple more boring speeches during dinner. - We went upstairs to change into casual attire, and then had a brief committee meeting in the lobby. It mostly consisted of exchanging bad pick-up lines, especially legislative ones.  - There was a talent show that we had to attend, and it went until after 11:00. Not only was it excruciatingly painful, but I was totally exhausted and really wanted to go to bed. They finally let us out, and we went back to our rooms and to sleep.  - Didn't sleep much at all. Maybe three hours. I'm not entirely sure why, but it could have something to do with Claire kicking me the entire night.   Saturday - Woke up, got dressed, ate breakfast downstairs. It wasn't bad. Plus I got to eat with some fun people I hadn't really known before.  - We got on buses again to go to the Legislative Office Building, and the General Assembly convened. The first bill was terrible - it nearly killed me - but most of the others were really fun. There was some excellent debate, and lots of other exciting things.  - For lunch, we walked down about a block to eat outside in a park. The meal itself was catered by Bear Rock Cafe, and was pretty good. There were lots of fun people, and some good discussion. I didn't really know Geoff or Jillian much before this trip, and I never realized what cool and interesting people they are.  - We walked back to the LOB and continued General Assembly. Again, lots of fun. By the time there was about one hour left in the session, our committee realized that after the bill we were just introducing was our bill, and if we went today we would only have about fifteen minutes to debate it. We really wanted lots of time - it was a fun and controversial bill - so we stalled. A lot. Anyone who tells you that it's impossible to filibuster in the House clearly hasn't seen our YLA committee at work. We called every single vote, even the ones to move the previous question, for division, and proposed tons of amendments. The other delegates, and the Speakers, got really frustrated with us, but it was extremely amusing and in the end we won out. Our bill wouldn't go until the next day.  - We commuted back to the Sheraton where we hung out for a couple hours. An interesting plan was proposed to make a certain person rather uncomfortable... but unfortunately it fell through. Next year.  - We got changed into formal attire to attend the Tri-Speaker's Banquet. The food, again, kind of sucked, and the speakers were really really (really) boring. I also started feeling a little sick, which didn't make me happy at all.  - We all went upstairs again to change into casual clothes for the dance. A few girls tried to force me into a rather skanky outfit to send me to the dance with, but I really wasn't feeling well and so opted to stay in my room while the others went to the dance. (Apparently I didn't miss too much - it was supposed to have been pretty dull.)  - In my room I watched the Britney Spears concert on Showtime. Just a little disturbing.  - The other girls came back upstairs eventually, but I honestly don't remember what time because I was almost totally asleep.  - I slept much better this time. Don't know why.   Sunday - Woke up, got dressed, ate breakfast downstairs. Same thing.  - We dropped our luggage off in the same storage room and checked out of our hotel room.  - The General Session convened again, but because of time restraints we held it in one of the ballrooms in the hotel instead of at the LOB. It was a little tighter, but not bad at all. Our bill was first on the agenda.  - After some very long and heated debate on our bill, the body passed it. That's right - the YLA of 2004 passed by two votes our blatantly unconstitutional bill. It was more than a little discouraging.  - We finished all the bills and even had time to move on to one Special Resolution.  - After debate was over on all the bills, we adjourned the General Assembly and went home. I immediately crawled into bed for a long, long nap. All in all it was a really lovely time, and I look forward to next year's event.   And in closing, some legislative pickup lines. (Some are old standbys, others are new ones that Kit and I came up with during the Assembly.) - You can bang my gavel anytime.  - Wanna go up and caucus in my room? - So about that Lemon test, I hear you're really into excessive entanglement... - You can drop your bill in my docket.  - I'm human; you're sexual; let's form a committee.  - I'm on the Environmental Committee - we do it in the wild.  - I'm on the Commerce, Science, and Technology Committee. You know, you can do anything under the Commerce Clause.  - I wanna get affirmative with your action.  I can't remember any others. If you have a good one, let me know and I'll post it.

      Probably no more posts until Sunday, when YLA is over. Unless of course I can find a computer with internet access at the hotel. But now I go off to debate blatantly unconstitutional bills that the Supreme Court ruled against hardly eight months ago. (More details when I get back.) Wish me luck!

      Today = Really Hard.   Five tests and a paper later, I'm still alive. I don't know about you, but I think that's kind of impressive.   Cookies are almost totally done. I've got one more batch in the oven and once those come out I can relax cookie-guilt free.   Definitely don't think my hair cut is happening tonight. Oh well. I'll just go to YLA with raggedy hair.   Talking of which: YLA. It starts tomorrow. If I had any energy whatsoever I'd be bouncing off the walls. But no. I'm kind of dead.   Sleep is my best friend. I miss it.

      From  urlLink Nate  and  urlLink Madeline :   Hannah, your subconscious mind is driven most by   Peace    You are driven by a higher purpose than most people. You have a deeply-rooted desire to facilitate peacefulness in the world. Whether through subtle interactions with love ones, or through getting involved in social causes, it is important to you to influence the world.  You are driven by a desire to encourage others to think about the positive side of things instead of focusing on the negative. The reason your unconscious is consumed by this might stem from an innate fear of war and turmoil. Thus, to avoid that uncomfortable place for you, your unconscious seeks out the peace in your environment.   Usually, the thing that underlies this unconscious drive is a deep respect for humankind. You care about the future of the world, even beyond your own involvement in it. As a result, your personal integrity acts as a surrogate for your deeper drive toward peace and guides you in daily life towards decisions that are respectful toward yourself and others.   Though your unconscious mind is driven most strongly by Peace, there is much more to who you are at your core.   What drives  urlLink your subconscious mind?

      Yeah, well, maybe. Just a little.  Seeing as it's summer and since I plan on taking lots of fun pics, I thought I'd go ahead and be a bit of a poser by setting up a photo blog. This template just isn't cut out for posting pictures, but I didn't feel like changing it to accommodate them. I've already put up a couple graduation pictures (courtesy of  urlLink Kit ) and some pictures of Bellingham and Fairhaven. Don't, of course, feel obligated to check that blog often - if I post something I'll try to announce it here.   Enjoy.

      So graduation was nice. I cried a couple (OK, more than a couple) times. Kit took fun pictures and as soon as she posts them I shall link to them. I am going to miss a number of the seniors beyond reason. Alas!  I really would post something legitimate. I really would. But I am exhausted and have a headache and don't feel like it right now. I'm thinking sometime in the not-so-distant future a real update will happen. Never fear.

      Last day of exams... school's over for the year... I'm not an underclassman anymore... life is looking pretty good. So I celebrated the best way I know how: I came straight home, made some tea, and watched "Sense and Sensibility." Oh, how I love that movie. Some days it scares me how similar to Elinor I am. And then other days I feel exactly the same as Marianne. Either way, that movie is just as good the 138th time as it is the first. Do see it if you haven't.   (I'm so jealous the rising seniors get to read "Pride and Prejudice" over the summer. Why don't we get to read something as cool as Jane Austen?)  Speaking of summer reading, I'm doubting I'll get to do much of my own with all the school stuff we're being assigned. There's a novel and four short stories in AP English, as well as a couple writing responses and an AP response; there's a book and an assignment in AP US History; and the newest addition is for AP French: Guy de Maupassant's "Pierre et Jean." And yes, it's the same Guy de Maupassant who wrote "Ball of Fat." Remember how that wasn't particularly the lightest or easiest read, even in English? Yeah, well, now we get to read a  novel  by him in the original language. I'm scared - I don't feel at all prepared for this. Granted, I did start skimming it after my French exam and it wasn't nearly as bad as I anticipated, but still. It's a lot of reading. And after all that we have to write a composition analyzing the family dynamic presented in the story. Also in French. I suppose if nothing else it should really help us all become that much more fluent, but that doesn't make me feel any less intimidated. What have I gotten myself into?  I spent a good part of lunch with a group of seniors today, and they were all talking about how it was their "last lunch at Raleigh Charter" and all that. I was so jealous - I would have given anything at that moment to know that I was going to college in just a few short months. College, why can't you be sooner? And it's not like I'm even going to be a senior, although it sometimes feels that way. No, I'm just a lowly junior, with two whole years left to go. Not that I don't like RCHS - I love it - but at the same time I feel ready to move on. I'd love to meet new people, do new things, live in a new place, everything. Alas. Another two years.

      Everyone I know keeps talking about how much they've studied for finals. "Oh my God, I studied for like 30 hours this weekend!" or "I totally crammed for this exam last night - it must have been five hours!" And then the inevitable: "How long did you study, Hannah?"   Well, that depends how you define studying, I guess.   I mean, I did all the review assignments, and I thought about them. I even did some practice Chemistry things, but not too much aside from the review packets. I went over French vocabulary and verbs a little. I drew funny pictures of French people and wrote stories about them in French. (OK, so that was more boredom than studying. It still counts.) I spent a solid 20 minutes looking over the notes for English and a little for Algebra II the night before the exam. That's it, really. I feel kind of bad - last year I spent  hours  studying for weeks in advance. Apathy set in big time this year, especially after APs. It just didn't seem worth doing any more work. So I didn't. I mean, the fact remains that I think I know the material, especially given that I was acing most of the review assignments without having to think too hard about them. It's not that I'm worried in particular; I just feel like I should have done more just for the sake of doing more. Is that logical? Probably not.   Go figure. Exams aren't logical.

      Finals completed: 4 Finals remaining: 2  Hours of school: 5 hours and 5 minutes Days until graduation: 3   On a scale of one to ten...  Satisfaction with exams thus-far: 8.5 Confidence about exams tomorrow: 4 (I've heard Chemistry's really hard) Happiness at school being out: 11  I'm very excited that there's only one more day of school (yay!), but on the other hand tomorrow is my hardest exam day. I need to review French pretty badly, and I've heard icky nasty things about the Chemistry EOC. That's the problem with EOCs - you can't ever fully prepare for them because there are inevitably a couple questions that you never will have seen before. I hate that feeling of staring at a question and having no idea what to do. It makes me feel really insecure. I'm hoping to keep that feeling at a minimum tomorrow.   Exams so far have gone swimmingly. English - piece o' cake. Math - not easy, but I felt pretty good about in nonetheless. APES - already got my grade back and I'm quite satisfied with it. GoPo - don't make me laugh.   I'm keeping my fingers crossed that tomorrow will go half as well as the past two days have.

      I hate clothes. I  hate  them. I hate hate hate hate hate them.   I recently ordered a couple pairs of capris from Eddie Bauer - the only store that ever has pants that fit me. I tried them on, and they were hideously off. Waist too big, thighs too small, length too long, butt way too small... the list goes on. I feel so depressed - I must have tried on every pair of pants in that store and in an act of desperation ordered the petites from the catalog. And they didn't work. So now I feel fat, ugly, and stupid. I hate this feeling, almost as much as I hate my body right about now. You know, some days I almost like being a little curvy, but when I go to buy clothes I always say, "Dammit, why can't I just be a stick like everyone else who buys pants?" The same goes for shirts - why can't I be flat? And no amount of losing weight will ever help me, because my freaking bone structure gave me these damn hips and butt and there's no getting rid of them. I spent about ten minutes in my room cursing and crying because I was so upset. I hate clothes, I hate my body, and I hate myself for being a fat, ugly pig.  I'll probably delete this post later. I'm just really upset and had to get it off my chest.

      Last day of English! Fortunately enough I was able to restrain the urge to cause him physical pain for another 25 minutes, and now I'm home free!   Well, except for the exam. But  urlLink today's Foxtrot  gives a pretty good idea of how I plan to handle that one.   Speaking of exams...   Tuesday: English & Algebra II Wednesday: AP Environmental Science & GoPo (ELPS) Thursday: French & Chemistry  I'm not too worried.

      Am happy about that. Although I find it interesting that of the four pictures of me (including the standard one) I am wearing a striped shirt in all four and three of them are the same shirt. Am I really that bland, or did they just get me on bad days? I sure hope it's the second.  Am also happy about the fact that we have 70 minutes of English left. So close...  Science Olympiad peoples left this afternoon for Nationals, leaving a gaping hole in both my classes and daily conversations. Come back, fun boys and girls!   P.S.

      Was tired and in a bad mood today. I need more sleep - this is getting annoying.   I'm in "I hate everything" mode. And it's not fun. Especially around exam time. Stupid mood swings. I hate them, too.   The only thing that's keeping me going is my new light read: "Eats, Shoots & Leaves." Read it. It's good.   Well, and the fact that there's only 115 minutes of English left. Thank God. I don't know if I could handle any more than that.   So to conclude (?), if I seem distant or annoyed, it's because I'm... distant and annoyed.

      For Mr. Grunden's fourth period Chemistry class:  Call me crazy, but I think I may have found a way to get some of the dye off your hands. This is what I did, and feel free to test me and try any or all of these steps. I have no scientific evidence to back me up, and considering I missed Mr. Grunden's speech about acids and bases I may very well be reversing science by claiming that this works. Anyway, here's what I did and it succeeded in getting a large part of the dye off my hands.   1. A hot shower. Some of the dye came off while repeatedly rubbing my hands in the hot water, so I'm sure a hot hand bath would work just as well. Shampoo may or may not have been a factor (I couldn't tell).  2. Some good ol' nail polish remover on a cotton ball. I scrubbed that for a while and then rinsed my hands in some more water to get rid of the smell. Some more dye came off then.   There are still hints of green in my skin, but the blatant color has almost completely disappeared. If anyone has any real evidence as to why this method should or should not work, or if you test it yourself and care to share your results, I am all ears. Feel more than free to leave a comment so the rest of the world can be that much more enlightened.

      Today: - Got to visit with lots of fun reptilian things in APES. They were slippery and slimy and fun all around.  - Tie-dyed in Chemistry and got dye all over my hands, as we couldn't find the gloves until  way  too late. They look quite scary and are bound to for at least the next couple days. Woo hoo.  - Got the results from the National French Exam. I placed fifth in the state and sixth nationally. Not bad. I came in second in my class - Caroline got fourth in the state and fifth in the nation (wow!). Congrats, everyone!  - Umm... that's it. I honestly thought I had a lot more exciting things to say. But no. I don't.   Except...  160 more minutes of English!

      Comments. They don't like to work sometimes. And that irritates me.   Also, I just made some brownies that I thought were very average. It was a new recipe my mom found, and it called for espresso powder. Personally, I'm a purist when it comes to things like chocolate, and really don't like to mess around by putting extraneous ingredients in. Give me my classic brownies and chocolate chip cookies and leave me alone.   On the upside, tonight is the first night in about two weeks that I actually did all my homework. Rock on.

      I went shopping today, and was painfully reminded of the never-ending difficulties people with my body shape have with finding clothes that fit or look good, let alone both. Nonetheless, I did come away with an adorable  urlLink pink skirt  from the Gap, in addition to a sweet  urlLink pink printed wrap-around shirt  (definitely not the color in the picture). I'm quite pleased with my purchases.  urlLink J.Jill , in a rare display of frumpiness, did not impress me and I subsequently did not buy anything. My sister, however, did come away with a cute top from that store.   While in  urlLink Eddie Bauer  - the only, and I mean only, store whose pants even come close to fitting me - I was accosted by a saleswoman who absolutely refused to leave me alone. I tried on several pairs of capris in different styles, and decided I didn't care in particular for any of them. She approached me as I left the dressing room and asked if anything had worked out. I replied no, but thank you very much for your help. She demanded, almost in a harsh tone, to see one of the pairs on me. A little scared, I obliged her and put on the pair that had almost worked. She kept telling me that they looked fine, that they seemed to fit me very well. I remained steadfast, saying I just didn't like how they felt, that they were too tight in some places and too loose in others. Fortunately, just at that moment, my mother and sister reappeared and helped me escape from Crazy Sales-Lady. I was eternally grateful for my narrow escape.   In other news: My summer reading list is starting to come together very nicely. There's no way I'll be able to finish it - there are at least ten tomes of over 700 pages each, all of very dense material - but I should at least get a head start. I'm very excited. Summer's almost here... can you taste it?

      I can't stop watching  urlLink "The School of Rock."  Call me whatever you want, but I think it's an absolutely precious movie. The music is good, the acting is genuine, and I'm a little in love with Zach, the guitarist. I just watched the DVD with the kids' commentary in the background, and although it was a tad irritating at first, overall it's so funny that it made up for any small (or large) annoyance factors. If you haven't seen it yet, I would offer it with my highest recommendations. It's silly to be sure, but I challenge you to find a movie so simultaneously sweet and not-teeth-gratingly irritating. Go see it.

      - Stole my mom's pink scarf when she was out this morning and wore it. Mwa ha ha.  - Just a movie in English. Nothing particularly painful, and it was decently entertaining.  - Spent APES goofing off, after briefly planning a mind-boggling easy project.  - French was... uneventful. Just the way I like it.  - Chemistry test went fairly well. I think/hope.  - Fun and interesting lecture from Mrs. Newmark's husband. Apparently history and foreign language majors are some of the lowest-earning majors. Alas. See if that stops me. (It won't.) - Easy math with cookies.  - Philosophy discussion went really well, more so than usual. Kit and I were reelected to the leadership team, and Trevor got a newly-created third position. That club rocks my socks.  - Went home, got dolled up, and went to the ballet with a friend. While certain parts of it were fairly average, the whole second half was "A Midsummer Night's Dream," which was spectacular. It was hilarious, well-danced, and did I mention it was hilarious? I had a great time.  - Got home, collapsed, and went to sleep. Ironically enough, it was the first night in the several years that I've had my bed in its place that I've hit my head on the window sill. (That part wasn't great, but everything else made up for it.)   So with such an interesting and stimulating day yesterday, what have I done today? Nothin'. Not one thing. I've been sitting at my desk for almost half an hour hoping I'll somehow get the motivation to do some homework and be productive. I'm still waiting.

      They were both in my dream last night.   I dreamt that I walked into chemistry with my new pink iPod in hand (unfortunately that was only in the dream... man, I want one of those) and moved to my seat. But Mr. Grunden had rearranged the room and he offered me a new seat not at one of the lab tables, but at one of the computer desks towards the back of the room. Perplexed, I asked why I couldn't sit with everyone else. He replied that he thought I might like it back here better, and that it would give me more time to do fun experiments. He then handed me my first assignment: a titration. All my concerns spontaneously disappeared, and I started jumping up and down. A titration! Yay! I immediately set to work, and as he went to talk to the rest of the class all seated at the tables, I put the earbuds in my ears and started the delicate procedure.   I don't think it means anything. I was probably thinking about titrations and pink iPods as I fell asleep. Still. It's odd.

      Given the evidence, I'm starting to wonder if my linking to a blog on the sidebar is a death warrant. There are multiple people who, once I've linked them, stopped posting all together. Witness: Brad, Heather, Kaj, and Trevor (although his posting wasn't too consistent to begin with). So many dead blogs... it makes me sad. But somehow I don't have the heart to remove them - I keep hoping they'll get a new breath of fresh air and become the most interesting and unique blogs ever.   Don't let that discourage you, though - if you want to be linked just let me know, either by saying so in the chatter, leaving a comment, or if you want to be really discrete you can always drop me an email.

      That's right - no more APs for Hannah. Yay! This one also went  much  better than yesterday's fiasco of an exam. Actually knowing the material: priceless.   But with the end of APs comes an excruciatingly bad evening ahead of me. Learn and memorize a page of guitar music, do three days worth of homework for other classes, and try to get some sleep. Eek.  P.S. Congrats to everyone who took an exam - I'm sure everyone did wonderfully.

      Of the multitudes of things I was supposed to accomplish tonight, only one was actually done: study for GoPo. And probably more than I should have.   The advantage: I am *not* going to repeat the APES experience from this morning. This test is going DOWN.  The disadvantage: Tomorrow evening will be... interesting. And busy. And bad.   Sophomore teachers need to be more sympathetic to APs is all I have to say.

      I'm uber-tempted by some of the new templates Blogger has. Shall I be a poser and give in to the standard template, or hold strong with this one that could use some  serious  revamping?  I'm thinking a major reinventing of the blog look (and possibly of the self) is happening this summer.

      Un post en français. Parce-que je le veux, c'est pourquoi.   Alors, aujourd'hui était... je ne sais pas. Mes grand-parents sont partis ce matin, et la maison sent très vide. Mais ce n'est pas mal - pas du tout! J'ai ma chambre, et maintenant je peux dormir seule et tout quand je veux.   Puis, les examens de AP sont mardi et mercredi prochain. J'ai beaucoup de peur, et je suis très nerveuse. (Est-ce que c'est la même chose? Je ne crois pas. Mais j'ai les deux, alors ce n'est pas une problème.) L'examen de gouvernement sera très difficile, mais si j'étudierai beaucoup, je pense que je peux faire bien. La science environnementale... je ne sais pas. Je veux faire bien, mais c'est un cours que je n'aime pas, et je ne veux pas l'étudier à l'université. Alors, pour les collèges, si je ne ferrai bien, ce n'est pas un gros partie pour m'accepter. *Le sigh*...  Au revoir, mes amis.

      I really miss having my room. For anyone who doesn't know me, or doesn't know me very well, I am extremely introverted. I can be good at pretending I have energy and am out in the open, but truthfully after a day of talking to people and being active I really need that time at home to recharge and get my energy back. But for four days now I haven't had a place to go. My computer and various school-related things are set up in the front room (that's where I am now), but my sister practices cello in here and it's so unbearably loud that I can't be in the same room, especially if I need to concentrate. The living room is out - my grandparents are in there most of the time and usually they're watching television also at an unbearably loud level. The kitchen, middle-of-the-house-slash-dining room, and basement provide few places to relax and be alone (the downstairs is cold and all the comfortable things have been moved to my sister's room for me to sleep on). I didn't even get to go to bed at my normal time last night because my sister was studying in her room and I can't sleep with the lights on and all that activity. I've been sneaking naps on my parents' bed and in the chair right next to me, but since our house is so open there are no doors to close to escape the noise and bustle coming from the other rooms.   I know this all sounds self-centered. And it is. I just feel like I haven't gotten to get my energy back in too long, and I'm getting more and more tired because of it. I need some space of my own to be alone for just an hour. Normally I can go in my room, shut the door, and think... but not until Friday.   I feel  drained .

      In Wilmington. In a cafe with wireless access.   Considering I'm running on practically zero sleep and have been up since 5:00 this morning, things are going relatively well. We got to Wilmington around 8:30 and dropped my sister off at her rehearsal. We then drove downtown with the idea of walking around, even though it was pouring rain. But did that stop us? Not with my grandparents in tow. They wanted to get around and walk, so walk (more like swim) we did. But even though we were soaked to the bone, somehow that wasn't good enough. The heavens looked down and said, "I don't think the Krakauers are wet enough yet." Several inconceivably large downpours later, I politely asked to be dropped off at a cafe so I could work on homework. I've been here several hours sitting at this table by the window with my mother, who joined me because she had a headache. My dad and grandparents visited some disappointing historic homes and walked some more. I'm glad I stayed here. I've accomplished most everything I wanted to, although I had to leave my GoPo notes at home because they were far too massive to bring in the car and I therefore can't work on the questions for this weekend. Alas. Just about everything else is finished, though, and that's a good feeling.   My sister's concert is at 4:30, so I'll probably be here until pretty close to then. If you want to be a kind soul and  urlLink email me , I will most likely get it and love you forever.   Ciao.

      Things have happened over the past few days.   - Went to one of my dad's former nurses' house for lunch a couple days ago with my parents, her and her husband, and another nurse and her husband. The food was  amazing , and the whole thing was very fun.  - Had a bit of a shopping spree at New York & Company. Everything was on uber sale, and I got five high quality tops for less than $45. Awesome.  - Put in a looooong work day on Friday. Hopefully I'll get my first check in a couple days. By my count it should be about $150. I know it's not much, but it's something. The way my job works I can only earn up to $600 dollars anyway, so I'll get there.  - Today, went to Southpoint and played in the Apple store for a while. My sister's old math teacher works there now and he was a lot of fun. And holy crap, iPods are the coolest things ever! I want one so so much... I tried the regular one and all five colors of the minis. Fun! We also bought some of the Microsoft programs made for Macs to help with file converting and things. It's all installed and happy now, and I am a happy child.  - Finished "The Accidental Tourist." It was average to mediocre until the ending, where it just went to complete crap. But then again, unless you're reading "Pride and Prejudice" what more can you expect from summer reading?

      It took me long enough, but here's the "summary" of my Boston/Maine vacation, for anyone brave enough to read the whole thing.  Tuesday - We arrived at the airport freakishly early in the morning (we haven't done that in a while because normally we just do carry-ons and don't have to check any bags, but we did this time) and after some brief confusion got all our luggage checked and the car parked. Unfortunately, when we got to the security line it was flooding out the door, and when we finally got to the front, my mom was randomly selected for the total-search-thing. This meant that we all had to go to the high security line, which in another twist of fate had a mother with at least five bazillion babies at the front of the line. Our plane wasn't scheduled to leave for another half hour, so we were fine, but this scary lady standing behind me and my sister had a flight leaving in less than five minutes. She started freaking out and breathing on me in funny ways, and I honestly couldn't tell you which was worse. Eventually she got through (although I will never know whether she made her flight or not) as did we. Almost as soon as we sat down by our gate, they called us to board. I vaguely remember thinking it was kind of funny that they just called the whole plane instead of the back rows first, but when I got to the end of the gateway I realized why. Our plane was a crop-duster. The whole plane had maybe fifty seats at most, and was arranged in rows of three, one seat on one side and two on the other. I had been on a plane like this once before, but that was flying from Omaha to Minneapolis. I somehow assumed that a flight from Raleigh to Boston would be slightly more populated, but I was delighted and amused to find that it was not the case. Even on such a small plane there was more than enough room for everyone, so we got to spread out a lot and take all the single-row seats. My sister and I had fun asking each other, "Do you want the window or aisle?" and then responding, "Yes."  - Upon arriving at Boston, we got a taxi and drove to the hotel. We stayed in Cambridge at a very nice hotel right in Harvard Square. The location could not have been better, and we spend a good part of our time there exploring Cambridge and the surrounding area. After lunch at a pleasant plaza right outside one of the entrances to Harvard and a nap, we decided to take advantage of the strange timing (about 2:30) and take the 3:00 student-led tour of Harvard for prospective students and their parents. It was fun to see the other kids on the tour - almost all were girls - but even more fun than that was their parents, and how much more energetic and obsessed they were than their children. Put it this way: my parents are lax compared to these psychos. Anyway, the tour was very helpful, as was our guide. Although I cannot say I fell madly in love with the university, I was highly impressed, hopefully enough so to go back and spend a night in the dorm as part of an official Harvard visit.  - After the tour, we went out for the most depressing Thai food I've ever had in my life, and then walked some more around Cambridge to listen to the many street performers. We sat and listened to a guitarist for a while, but were interrupted by an annoying "jazz" trio just around the corner. My dad offered to give me ten dollars to give to them to make them stop, but we then realized that instruments in the hands of the wrong people can be dangerous in more ways than one. We returned to the hotel and went to bed.   Wednesday - Our second day in the Boston area was a little more exciting. We took a subway from Cambridge into Boston near the park and proceeded to walk through the park, headed southwest into a more residential area, and then circled the park the other direction and followed part of the Freedom Trail all the way to the North End, where we walked around some more. The North End is famous for two things: one, it's the end of the Freedom Trail and is where the Old North Church is located (we quickly got out of there as it was crawling with annoying tourists as you might imagine), and two, it's the Italian district. If you manage to escape all the tourist traps along the way, there is a pleasant residential neighborhood covered with cafes and pastry shops. We debated for a while going into a pastry place to have Bill Clinton's favorite cannolis, but later decided against it. I regret to say that we did not eat anything other than coffee and gelato there, but as wonderful as everything looked, none of us were hungry.  - Before I move on, I have to mention two things we saw on the streets. Irrelevant as they are, these two people are probably my two best anecdotes from the whole trip. While we were walking through the park, we saw lots of begging people walking around. One man, however, was not asking for money, but simply announcing his weather predictions. "Eighty two degrees today! Tomorrow, seventy six, and rain tomorrow night!" I honestly couldn't tell you whether he was right or not, but he was amusing nonetheless. My second story blip takes place in the North End. While crossing the street, a taxi got mad at us and honked his horn. A man, presumably an Italian resident of the area, said in the sweetest Italian accent, "Hey, relax, this is a residential neighborhood!" Although I couldn't hear, the driver must have yelled at the guy because he then responded, "Hey, you want me to get your license taken away? Because I will. What, you don't believe me? What's your license number?" This exchange continued for a couple minutes, but eventually we moved on for fear of being the Italian tough guy's next victim. Anyway, both incidents put big smiles on everyone's faces.  - That evening we walked around Cambridge and the Harvard campus a little more before eating an uneventful dinner and going to bed. It strikes me as odd that the biggest metropolis we visited on this trip, i.e. Boston and the larger Boston area, was by far the worst for food. How ironic.   Thursday - We breakfasted at the same place we'd eaten lunch upon our arrival. While eating my croissant, a very bold finch flew up on my plate and stared at my food. I was shocked, and was so pleased that I gave him a piece of bread. After he left, another two finches came up to beg for food. As much as I loved having birds fly practically to my hand, I was a little worried about being bitten (it's probably more appropriate to say my mom was worried about me being bitten) and was forced to chase them away. Poor little buggers.  - We rented a car early that day and drove to Portland, Maine. We arrived relatively early in the day, and after checking into the hotel we asked for a lunch recommendation. Seeing as we were in Maine, we thought it would be appropriate to get some clam chowder, and after communicating this desire to the man downstairs, he pointed us in the direction of a large restaurant on the water. We walked down there only to find the biggest tourist trap I've ever seen. The walls were covered in ship pieces and various other nautical accouterments. It was hideous beyond belief. However, having nowhere better to go, we stayed, and I must confess that the clam chowder was pretty good and the view was very nice.  - After eating, we walked around Portland a bit. I'm not entirely sure what we expected of the area, but whatever our expectations they were most certainly not met. The entire place felt touristy and dumpy. The thing about my family when we travel is that we try our hardest to steer away from anything that attracts tourists since we much prefer to be around the people that actually live there. Consequently, although I have been to New York City several times, I have never seen the Statue of Liberty or the Empire State Building. We instead spent most of our time toodling around the lower-east side in residential neighborhoods, a place where you are not likely to run into many people who don't actually live in New York. You may understand when I say, then, that the town felt fake, especially having come from Cambridge and the Freedom Trail, both of which were fairly touristy. In a word, it felt icky.   Friday - We had planned on spending two nights in Portland, but having exhausted what we believed to be, well, everything the night before, we left early and took the scenic route up the coast. Parts of it were quite lovely, but since I hadn't been sleeping very well I slept for a good part of the trip. We made a few stops along the way: we spent all of about twenty minutes in Freeport, the location of the L.L. Bean outlet store (among others), and about the same amount of time in another town whose name I forget, although I can practically guarantee that it had either rock, port, free, or land (or a combination of the above) in its name.  - Since we didn't feel like getting to Bar Harbor a day early, we spent the night in Camden: another little town of no consequence on the highway. Even though it was just yet another tourist trap, we ironically had our best meal on the trip that evening. We decided to treat ourselves to a nice dinner, and found a smallish place right on the water. One of the nice things about Maine is that the further up the coast you go, the cheaper the lobsters get. I had never had lobster before in my life, and my dad decided it was high time I try it. My first lobster was, in a word, *amazing.* It was a little like a prawn, except softer and sweeter and oh so good. If you've never had one, I highly highly recommend it. And that wasn't the only good dish that night - my dad ordered that one, so my mom had salmon (excellent), my sister had a steak fillet and the biggest prawn I've ever seen in my life (also wonderful), and I had the halibut with lemon, capers, and asparagus (incredible). We also got a seafood salad to share as an appetizer, of which my favorite part was the tuna, just barely seared on the outside with an olive-y crushed sauce on top. It tasted exactly like you'd imagine the ocean to taste. All in all, it was an amazing meal.  - We returned to the hotel and had an uncomfortable night there. But we were all so happy from the meal that we didn't really care.   Saturday - First thing in the morning we got up and drove to Bar Harbor. We arrived at the hotel, and it was possibly the loveliest thing I've ever seen. We were right on the water with a little balcony and two chairs. I have tried to find pictures on the internet of the islands we could see from our room, but to no avail. Just imagine the most peaceful water with two islands right in front of you covered with trees and looking just as calm as the water they sit in. It was amazing. The sky was dark when we got there, and it looked like rain. Despite weather warnings, we tore ourselves away from the view and took a stroll around the town of Bar Harbor. It was a cute, albeit touristy (again!) town. However, just as we were walking, a huge clap of thunder struck, and rain started coming down in sheets. Although we had brought a couple umbrellas with us, they did not keep my sister and I, who were wearing sandals, from getting soaked. We sprinted back to the hotel, where we sat in front of the lobby fire for a while. After drying a little we went back to the room to wait out the rest of the rain. Meanwhile, fog started developing just offshore, and we could see it starting to roll in and cover the islands in a misty haze. It was just beautiful.  - After the rain stopped, we walked into town again and ate at a good but very garlic-y Italian restaurant. - Walking back to the hotel, the rain had almost stopped, and all that was left was a slight drizzle if anything. We were walking down the street when I suddenly glanced up. There in the sky was the perfect double rainbow. Everyone has seen a rainbow at least once in their life, but I am telling you, not only were the individual rainbows the biggest and clearest I've ever seen, but there were two of them, one right on top of the other! We stood still staring for a full few minutes, until the top rainbow started to fade in the middle at first and then little by little towards the edges. The bottom rainbow was still there, though, perfect and crisp as ever. It was truly a beautiful sight.  - And just when the sky couldn't get any prettier, we got near the marina and the hotel and saw these huge, billowing rolls of fog starting to come ashore. It was moving so fast you could see it coming closer and closer, and before long everything was covered in it. We headed back up to the room after admiring the scenery for a while, and then spent the next fifteen minutes or so out on the deck just staring at the fog covering the islands. I swear, within one minute this huge fog cloud started at one side of this rather large island and quickly swallowed the whole thing. I've never seen anything like it, and cannot find any pictures that convey what I saw and how clean I felt watching the whole thing take place. It was simply gorgeous.   Sunday - As I'm sure beach people know (and not being a beach person myself I didn't really know this), the sun comes up much earlier all the way on the coast than it does here. At precisely 3:44 AM, all four of us woke up because the light coming from the not-yet-risen sun was just too bright for all of us to keep sleeping. The sky was covered in bright pinks and oranges, and even though we were all tired from staying up late to watch the fog, we couldn't bring ourselves to go back to sleep and miss this gorgeous sunrise.  - When it was a decent hour, we headed downstairs for what we assumed would be the standard complimentary breakfast with perhaps some stale muffins and spilt cereal. On the contrary, it was very nice - everything was fresh and most of it was pretty decent. The fruit in particular was very good; we surmised that they must have had local berries there because the strawberries were just amazing. We also got to eat outside on their deck and stare at the water some more. The fog from the night before had cleared, and we saw that what we thought was just a couple islands was in fact a whole bunch of them, though we hadn't known because many of them had been hidden the day before.  - After admiring the view some more, we got in the car and headed to Acadia National Park: the smallest national park in the country. It's about 37 square miles and some change. Why is it so small you might ask? Because it's all either rocky beach or vertical hiking.  - My dad had visited this park before and had gone on one of the completely vertical hikes, complete with ladders and climbing poles. We inquired at the rangers' station about those hikes, but unfortunately they were all closed because the peregrine falcons were nesting. We settled for the next-best thing: a medium level hike with some vertical parts and some more flat parts. Basically it was like scrambling over boulders uphill for a couple miles. It was fun as hell, even if it did take a while. When we started getting closer to the top, the trees started clearing and you could see all the way straight down the rocky cliffs into the water. It was very beautiful, but my mom started getting a little scared and opted to sit down a little ways away from the very top while my dad, sister, and I continued our hike. Just a few short minutes later we reached the very summit. It was nearly a complete 360 degree view all around the park. On one side was mountains and lots of trees and rocks, and on the other was this gorgeous coast with the most crystal clear water I've ever seen, spotted occasionally with small islands. The wind was incredible, and to avoid getting knocked over (it would have been a long way to fall, trust me) we sat down on a rock and stared at the view for a few minutes. It was so beautiful and peaceful up there, none of us wanted to leave. But at last we got our strength back together and started the long hike back down, picking my mom up along the way. Somehow it seemed much shorter on the way back, perhaps because we were all a little giddy from the view.  - After the hike, we drove around the park a little more, including stopping to play on the rocks right next to the ocean. (You'd have thought we'd seen enough rocks by then, but no.) We then returned to the hotel to rest for a while, since it had been an excruciating morning. We'd all gotten sick of restaurants by then, so my dad opted to walk to the local grocery store and get us a picnic. It was lovely: we had turkey sandwiches, pickles, and cheese and crackers on our little porch, which by then was sunny and clear. My dad had also picked up a couple movies while he was out, so we stayed in for a little while and watched one of them.  - By the time dinner rolled around, none of us were very hungry since we'd eaten such a lovely and filling lunch, so we skipped dinner and just had some leftovers from our previous meal (we had a little fridge in the room: very handy). We then went for a few short walks in town and on the coastline, but mostly stayed pretty close to the hotel.  - As a general rule, I don't sleep well on vacation. Something about being in a new bed and having to share it with my sister and be in the same room with my parents unsettles me a little, I guess. I hadn't gotten more than a few hours of sleep each night since we'd started out, so when I woke up at 1:30 in the morning to all three of my family members snoring their brains out, I couldn't take it anymore. I moved the whole operation into the only place in the room where I could get rid of the noise: the bathroom. I took a couple pillows and a blanket and settled myself on the floor in there. Although I didn't actually sleep much, I bet I got more rest in there than I would have in bed, and when I did sleep I had very pleasant dreams. Still, it was probably the most uncomfortable of all the nights, for obvious reasons.  - A couple hours after I went there, I heard this loud scratching noise, like some one was dragging something heavy across a concrete floor. However, I was so tired and the noise sounded like it was coming from farther away from our room that I did not get up to investigate.   Monday - Woke up early again (blame the sunrise) and went back to bed for a couple hours, since everyone seemed to have stopped snoring. I looked out the window and realized what had caused the noise I'd heard earlier that morning. Just offshore was a large cruise ship that must have arrived in the middle of the night. We speculated for a while that maybe the captain was new and made a wrong turn and crashed into a sandbar (there is a reason they call it Bar Harbor, after all) since to enter the dock you had to go around another island. But after a few hours of deliberation and the lowering of a number of small boats to help get people to shore, we decided that it had been intentional and the noise we'd heard was the ship dropping anchor. This theory was later confirmed by some people by the shore.  - We had left this day open and unplanned intentionally so we could decide what to do that morning. My family wanted to drive up to Cadillac Mountain in Acadia to look at the view, but I was so exhausted from my cumulative sleep loss and a rough night the night before that I decided to stay around the hotel that day. We all ate breakfast together, and then they left, leaving me to my own devices. Since I knew the maid had to clean the room at some point, I took a book (David Sedaris' new book, as a matter of fact) and headed down to the lawn just between the hotel and the edge of the water. There were a few comfortable chairs set up there, and I claimed the one underneath a tree and read. I must have been there at least a couple hours alternately reading and napping because when I headed back to the room I ran into my returned family. Apparently I hadn't missed too much, since the view was very similar to the one we'd gotten the day before. Still, they seemed to have enjoyed themselves, and I certainly enjoyed myself, so everything worked out.  - For lunch, we snacked on more leftovers from the day before. Unfortunately, we had run out of bread and crackers but still had most of a piece of brie and some of this cheese-with-port stuff left. We therefore resorted to things like brie sandwiches with pickle and salami with a side of brie. It was luxurious, but a little gross. We relaxed for another little while and watched a second movie.  - In the afternoon, my sister was getting a little antsy, so I took her down to town and we got an ice cream and walked around a little. It was fun wandering into all the little touristy shops in town, all the while making fun of everything and nibbling on our ice cream. It was very nice.  - For dinner, we wanted our last night in Maine to be special, so we ate at a restaurant built on top of a dock right on the water. The food was very average - even bad - but the view was lovely, so it didn't matter much. We walked around some more before going up to our last night in Bar Harbor.  - I thought for a while about setting up out on the porch that night since I'd made one chair very comfortable with the addition of a blanket and pillow, but decided that I would probably freeze, and since we were keeping the screen door open it wouldn't much help the snoring problem. I stayed in the room, but slept very well. I think at that point I was so exhausted that no noise, not even my sister snoring in my ear, could disturb me.   Tuesday - Our last day of vacation may have indeed been the most exciting and turbulent. We woke up very early and quickly got dressed. We did lounge in the breakfast area for a little while, soaking in the last of the view, but we soon got in the car to drive to the airport in Bangor. It was a two hour drive, and we didn't know the road.  - About half an hour away from the airport, we saw a big slow-down on the highway ahead of us. We weren't sure what was going on, but we saw some cars turning around up ahead and knew things couldn't be good. When we finally got to the front, a policeman was turing cars back around. We asked him the quickest way to get to the airport, and he gave us a complicated set of directions involving lots of back ways and small roads. Pulling away from the one (very nice) cop trying to control the whole situation, I couldn't help but be reminded of this one comedian I saw who used to be a police officer in Maine. "My patrol area was about 800 square miles," he said. "My backup was a day and a half away." - As we all suspected the case would be, we got lost and had to pull over for directions at least three times. However, we were getting closer and closer each time, and we had allowed time for something like this so we didn't worry too much. The last time my dad asked someone where the airport was, they told him where to go, and then said, "It's on North Street." We all did double takes. "Wait, you mean the airport is on a  street ?" "Yeah," he said. "North Street." Shocked, we drove on. Sure enough, right there on North Street just barely past a collection of shops was Bangor International Airport. It was crazy.  - While my dad went to drop off the rental car (as it turns out, it was about two feet away from the airport entrance) the three of us ladies went to check in. Everyone was very friendly, even the security guy checking our luggage. We quickly got through all the registration stuff and headed up towards the gates. We looked at one of (really the only) screen monitors to check our gate. We were at Gate 1, but that was as opposed to Gate 2 or 3. No kidding: there were three gates in the whole airport. And not only that, but there were three security checkpoints, one for each gate. You weren't technically supposed to go through the security thing until your flight was within an hour or so of taking off, so we waited out in the "main" area. We had unwittingly allowed way too much time, even with our getting-lost-time in there, so we had about two hours to sit and wait. There were some children's toys in one little area, so Chloe and I amused ourselves with the Legos until some real kids wanted to play with them and we left.  - They called our flight on the intercom (really, they should have just yelled at us) and we went through security and headed towards the gate. While we were waiting in line, my mom overheard someone mention that our connecting flight from Boston to Raleigh was canceled, so she and my dad went up to check out the situation. My sister and I followed in curiosity. The guy typed in our ticket number and said, "Oh, uh, yeah, there's a message on your ticket, too." (Which brings up the question: when were they planning on telling us this? Not when we were boarding the plane - they weren't scanning tickets. Stupid people.) Anyway, everyone else had boarded the plane and the four of us and this other couple also traveling to Raleigh were waiting to have them rebook us. The couple, as it turns out, had a son who my dad operated on and were also staying in Bar Harbor while we were there. Small world, eh? The couple eventually got rebooked on another flight going through a different city with a connecting flight that left five minutes after their first one landed. Since there were only two more spots on that flight, they took those and the people working there kept searching for something for us. The best thing they could get was leaving three hours later and had a long layover, and the way things were going could end up being a three-legged flight. Since my dad had work the next day and this new flight thing would make us get home really late, he asked if there was anything else. The guy said there was this other flight on another airline, but that he couldn't tell whether there were seats on it or anything. We were all starting to get confused, so my dad called the airline and asked what the deal was. First the person there said our flight wasn't canceled (what?!?) but then said it was and was trying to get us booked on all these stupid things... it was nuts. Meanwhile, my dad walked down to the other airline's ticket counter and was talking to two people at once trying to get something worked out. He was being, as he later described himself, what they call a "royal pain in the ass," but we really did need to get home soon. This other airline offered us a flight to LaGuardia with continuing service to Raleigh. Perfect! We took the tickets and ran to the other security checkpoint to catch the plane that was about to take off.  - Once we got on the plane - we were the last people to do so - things went pretty smoothly. We only had to wait in the connecting airport for a few minutes because technically it was a "continuing flight" and not really a connection. One of our main worries about changing our flights the way we did was that our luggage would get crazily and mind-bogglingly lost, so when we walked to the baggage claim after we landed all of us had our fingers crossed. But lo and behold, our luggage was not only there, but it was the first to come out! Hooray! My dad went to get the car, we all piled in, and drove home. We were scarcely two hours later than we would have been had all our flights worked out. It was a pleasant surprise.   If you read that entire thing, give yourself a cookie. You deserve it.

      This morning, while cleaning the kitchen, I slammed the same part of my head into yet another painful surface. This time it was the corner of the kitchen cabinet, and believe me when I say that it hurt just as bad if not worse than the first time. Consequently, I have a bump on my head and I'm having problems seeing clearly. Ow.   I'm also packing for our trip that begins tomorrow. We're going to Boston for a few days, then to Portland (Maine, of course), and finally to Bar Harbor and Acadia National Park. I should be way more excited than this, but like I say, I have a huge bump on my head and I can't see straight. Things are feeling a little off.   I think I'm going to go take a nap.

      Went to a wedding.   Took pictures, but discovered after shooting an entire roll that my camera had once again broken and failed to advance the film. Consequently, all my pictures of the pre-ceremony and of the ceremony itself were gone. If I hadn't already been teary-eyed because of the wedding I'm sure I would have burst into tears. Not only did I feel really bad (I promised the bride, a friend of ours, that I would print the pictures for her) but I was damn proud of some of them. Oh well. That's how it goes, I guess.   Slammed my head in the car door. That wasn't fun. I had another awful headache afterwards and everything was kind of blurry for a couple hours. I am now feeling better, in case anyone was wondering.   So now I'm sitting here, with no pictures and a large bump on my head, waiting until tomorrow when I get to go through the pre-traveling fiasco that happens every time my mother travels. I'm not looking forward to it.   In case you hadn't gathered, I'm in a rotten mood.

      I went with Sarah today to see David Sedaris, one of my favorite author-slash-comedians ever. Even though I am paying for that incredible time with a nearly unbearable headache at the moment, I cannot help but feel it was all worth it.   For those of you who don't know (and shame on you!), David Sedaris is a man from the area who has written a number of books - collections of essays - about his family, growing up, and being a gay man in France. His books are phenomenally funny, but nothing compares to hearing his voice on the radio or, even better, in person. He often appears on "This American Life" on NPR, and if you ever get the chance to listen to him, I highly recommend it. He has the most unique voice I've ever heard, and in my personal opinion his stories are nothing without his voice behind them. One of my favorite episodes of "This American Life" can be found  urlLink here  by clicking the icons on the left. His bit is the first after the prologue.   Anyway, Sarah had heard he was coming into town on a book tour and invited me to come with her. The woman at the store said we should get there at least an hour early if we even wanted to be in the room, and an hour and a half early if we wanted to be able to see him. Being good and eager fans we got there a solid hour and a half early, and were dismayed to find there was hardly room to stand, even in the back. Being my aggressive self in these kinds of situations, I forced her to come with me and scout out the area for sitting room. We ended up directly behind him, but I was upset that we wouldn't be able to see his face. (The last time he came to that store my parents went to see him and also ended up behind him. This was a situation I did not care to repeat.) I therefore scooted my head around the other side of the podium only to find just enough room for two people to squeeze directly in front of the chairs reserved for the Sedaris family. After some debate as to whether we really wanted to sit two feet away from the podium and right next to the rather large speaker, we decided to go for the seats. Uncomfortable as they were, we knew we probably had some of the best seats in the house, especially compared to the poor suckers who immediately leapt upon our old spot behind the bookcases.   About an hour later, the Sedaris family started filing into the three or so rows of seats reserved for them. I briefly cast a glance, fascinated that these were the real-life people I'd read so many stories about. Then, suddenly, I stopped. There was a very pretty blonde woman sitting in the front row, and she looked almost familiar. Then I realized who it was, but just to be sure I asked the woman sitting next to me, "Is that Amy Sedaris?" She nodded yes. " The  Amy Sedaris?" I asked. The woman nodded again. For those of you who don't know her either, she's also an acclaimed comedienne, well-known for her interesting hobby of making herself as ugly as possible. Having purchased a book to have David sign after the reading, I asked politely if she would mind signing it as well. Unfortunately, she said she didn't want to sign until David did (an appropriate move, I think), and I was unable to find her after the reading. Presumably she took off - no one wanted to be in that hot, crowded room any more than they had to. I just thought it was the coolest thing to be sitting almost at Amy Sedaris' feet while listening to David Sedaris talk.   As the starting time grew nearer, the people running the show decided to start early, citing that they couldn't get any more people in the building even if they wanted to - a statement which I'm sure was absolutely true. The room was sweltering: many people had taken their books or spare pieces of paper and were fanning themselves. A worker at the store came up and gave a brief introduction, and then David himself stood up and came to the podium. The applause was incredible. Although I had heard his voice many times before, I had never seen him in person. At first I was a little startled - he somehow didn't look how I'd pictured him. But once he began to talk, I realized the voice really did fit the face and I suddenly wondered how I'd managed to miss what he looked like. He wasted little time before diving right into the reading, which consisted of a story from the book and several diary entries, followed by a brief question-and-answer session. I won't defame what he said by trying to repeat each story he told, but suffice to say I have rarely laughed harder, or heard so many other people doing the same, in my life. He was fantastic. If you desire to hear more from me about what he said, feel free to ask, but I have told the stories so many times today I have no more energy to repeat them, especially in writing. Believe me when I say he was fantastic.   After the reading, people lined up to get signatures in order of the letters they had on cards they gave out when you purchased a book. Neither I nor Sarah was for a while (we were K and H, respectively, I believe) and were both so tired and hot that we wanted to run over to Wellspring to grab a drink. While discussing our plans, a woman came up to me and said, "Here, someone just gave me an A card - do you want this C?" We immediately leapt at the opportunity, and darted over to the grocery store to grab drinks before coming immediately back and getting in line. We couldn't have waited more than 20 or 30 minutes (which, trust me, was amazing - people were waiting for hours on end) before I got up to the table where he was chain smoking and signing books. They had asked us to write our names on a post-it note before we got to the signing table in order to eliminate confusion about spelling and things like that. So when I got there, he smiled at me and said, "Are you Hannah?"  "Yes," I said. He smiled. "Are you a teenager?" "Yes," I said.  "How old are you?" "Sixteen." He got this excited look on his face and darted into a bag at his side. "I  love  when teenagers come to my shows. Keeps the audience young, you know? And I love having something to give them. " I smiled while he kept rummaging through his bag. "There's a story in the book about a rubber hand," he said, "so here you go!" and he handed me this tiny little rubber hand. He then wrote in my book: "To Hannah, it was rubber. David Sedaris." I shall treasure both the hand and the signature for a long time to come. He did something very similar with Sarah, who came right after me, except with a story about amputees that he'd told and a little rubber foot. Both the extremities provided much entertainment while we were standing together waiting for my ride after the reading.   I honestly cannot remember when I've had a better time, even though as I say I am now paying for sitting right next to that huge speaker with a headache. Trust me, it was all worth it.

      Once again, am at The Most Boring Job on the Planet. I'm currently on my lunch break, but soon enough I'll have to get back to plugging in more fun numbers and struggling through messy dictations.   However, I must confess that although my head has nearly exploded from the monotony a number of times, I have come to several conclusions as a result of being here at TMBJotP.  1. Smart people do really silly things sometimes. Like doctors (smart people) more often than not forget to reference carbon copies to other people (silly thing). As this causes me difficulty and more work, I do not appreciate it much.   2. Dictation offices are strange strange places. Looking at the transcripts they send back on the computer, there are several in which the fonts and formats spontaneously change. There are also a few that jump into hot pink and underlined text. As this causes me eye strain and general annoyance, I do not appreciate it much.   3. Macs are way cooler than PCs. Sorry if you like PCs, but that's just the way it is. I'm working on this computer which, although I'm sure is very nice, is not organized the way I'd like and does not have the keyboard shortcuts I have come to know and love on the Mac. As this makes my work longer and more tedious, I do not appreciate it much.   4. Because of all these annoyances that come with having TMBJotP, I am getting paid more. Since I am paid by the hour, the longer it takes me to do menial tasks, the more money they give me. So, I must conclude, that I do appreciate all the little roadblocks this job has put in my way. Except maybe for the uncomfortable chair that won't go any lower so my feet barely touch the ground. That's just irritating.

      At work. Bored to tears. The work I'm doing is literal number crunching - I take numbers I get from patient charts and put them in pretty Excel documents. Some doctors are nice and do coherent, ordered dictations. Most of them, however, are haphazard, long, and difficult to get through. I'm almost to the halfway point of this incredibly huge stack of papers with lots of numbers on them, and when I finish that I get to go out to Garner and look at more patient charts. Woo hoo!   Remind me to never  ever  get a job in an office.

      They've taken one of my favorite books of all time: "Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West" and made it into a  urlLink musical ? How? Who? And perhaps most importantly  why?  "Wicked" is not the kind of book that lends itself to being a musical production. It's dark, scary, and occasionally philosophical. Like I say, not really musical material. I don't understand.   Although I somehow doubt the credibility of the musical, the  urlLink book  is most definitely worth reading. Pick it up sometime. It's great. Don't try any of the other sequels, though - awful to the core.

      It's been a lovely lovely morning-into-afternoon. I woke up early for no apparent reason and spent a good couple hours reading "A History of God." I'm taking it really slow, as it's pretty dense and I find it really interesting. No need to rush. My mind was completely blown when post-modernist ideas started showing up in early Jewish mysticism - like before Christ early. Who knew? I've gotten through the establishment of monotheism and most of the development of Judaism and have now moved on to early Christianity. Although I can't figure out exactly why I find the early Christians so incredibly irritating (maybe I haven't gotten into that part enough yet), I am loving watching the evolution of religion as it evolves with the politics of the time and human consciousness in general.

       Hannah, you're a Bernese Mountain Dog!   No bones about it, you're a good-hearted, people-loving Bernese Mountain Dog. Down-to-earth and loyal, no one works or plays harder than you do. You put your nose to the grindstone when it really counts, but you never neglect your social calendar. Simultaneously strong and sweet, you're very tuned-in to the feelings and needs of the other dogs you run with. Without having to be asked, you always have a helping paw to lend and a sympathetic shoulder to lean on. "Communication" is your middle name, and when that's paired with your unswerving devotion, you get a breed that everyone respects and trusts.

      We rented the classic "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" tonight. Although we've only watched it one and a half times so far, my dad issued the challenge to watch it 25 times this week.

      It's been an eventful past couple days.   1. My sister "graduated" middle school on Friday. She's very happy about that. Now we'll both be at Raleigh Charter. Way less driving and way less hassle. We're both excited.   2. I've been  urlLink ROC-ified!  I got a job at my dad's office doing some research work, and Friday afternoon I went in for my orientation. Even though I'm really only doing temporary independent project-type work, they still had to put me through the whole orientation process that all employees do. Having never worked in an office before, I always thought the orientation scenes in movies were exaggerated. Now I know better. Take my word for it - it's  exactly  like the movies. There's a dark room with too many chairs for so few people; the walls are grey; there are no windows; and, of course, there are the stupid orientation films. I and the one other guy in there with me (he smoked like a fiend and I could smell him from across the room) had to watch two: one on blood transmuted pathogens, which didn't apply to either of us because we're not clinical workers, and one on office ergonomics. I'm not kidding. There was really a fifteen minute movie on how to sit properly and arrange your workstation to suit your needs. My mind was blown. We then had to go through all kinds of insurance things and sign lots of fun forms. Three hours later, I emerged with a name tag, a pamphlet with all the doctors' pictures and backgrounds (tee hee), and a freaking huge notebook with all kinds of procedures they expect me to read and become familiar with over the weekend. If my mind wasn't already made up before, I would now be convinced that a professorship has got to be better than an office job.   3. My sister and I took a beading class this morning at Ornamentea. We made  urlLink a nice double-stranded necklace  that, although it isn't the prettiest thing, taught us the basics of crimping and stringing. By the time the two of us got there all the pretty color kits had been taken (I really wanted the one with pink, white, and silver) so I got black and champagne, and my sister got white, teal, and black. At least we know how to do it now, and I am itching to go back, take some more classes, and learn how to make really cool stuff.   UPDATE: I added picture links to the above.

      Today: - Went with my mom to get, at long long last, an elliptical trainer. Yay! It's going to be delivered sometime next week. My dad had lots of fun coaching my mom in how to wheel and deal with the guys there trying to get a good price (which we did). What can I say? Sometimes the Jewish stereotypes are true.  - Bought a wedding present for a friend whose wedding is next weekend. We'd been searching for something for a long time and happened upon it today in the mall. It's a lovely platter at one of my favorite stores in the universe -  urlLink Williams Sonoma . I can't wait to get married so I can go to that store and register every single last thing. Mmm, yuppy kitchens with pretty equipment make my heart go pitter patter.  - Also went into  urlLink Crate & Barrel  (the other store that makes me want to get married) and got my grandmother a gift - a Cuisinart stick blender. It's the same one I bought for my mom's birthday, and she loves it so much she wanted to get one for my grandma.  - Played on iTunes long enough to find a lovely new song: Toby Lightman, "Devils and Angels." Is a new CD purchase in my not-too-distant future? Perhaps as soon as my job is solidified.

      The new Harry Potter movie - which, as I'm sure everyone knows, is coming out this Friday -  urlLink looks good . The third book was probably my favorite, so I'm rather excited. Although I agree with  urlLink Will  that the splendor and excitement of  Lord of the Rings  far overwhelms anything the Harry Potter films could produce, it doesn't stop them from being delightfully sweet films, much like their book counterparts. I plan on rereading  The Prisoner of Azkaban  in the next few days just to refresh my memory, in between  urlLink  A History of God   by Karen Armstrong, which I started this morning and am enjoying immensely.

In any case they're there if you want to take a gander.   Enjoy.   P.S. I'm having a bit of a tiff with my mother. My mood is not the best.

      And earlier than I thought we'd be, too. Awesome.   There's a more legitimate update on the  urlLink LiveJournal , but I thought I'd say hello here as well.   Guess what time I slept in to this morning?  Seriously, guess. I'll reveal the secret later.   Pictures and stories are coming soon. I promise.  Oh, and I got my AP scores. They are happy, I am happy - everything is happy!  Later.

      So. On vacation. On my uncle's laptop that's on the verge of falling apart, so I'll make this quick.   Things are going well. We've spent the past few days in Bellingham playing around and doing various other fun things. This morning we went kayaking in the bay - it was gorgeous and very fun. Tomorrow we're taking off and driving somewhere around here (I forget where). Eventually we're supposed to end up in the Olympics and Port Angeles, but I don't think that's for a couple days. We shall see. My uncle Daniel is with us now, and he's an absolute riot and is making things much more fun.   I want my AP scores soooooo bad. It hurts.  COMING SOON: Pictures.

      I wanted to take pictures of the lovely lovely pairs of earring I made this morning at Ornamentea, but alas, there are no batteries in the digital camera. Blast. I made four pairs all together: three in the class and one afterwards while I was waiting for my ride. Of the pairs from the class, two of them are silver filigree with pink and crystal beads, and the other is a vintage strand with a green bead in the center. The one I made myself is a chandelier-style earring with five pink beads dangling on the bottom and a white pearl in the center. They are all quite cool, if I do say so myself.   Tomorrow I fly out to Bellingham, where I will be for the next week-and-some. Unfortunately, I will not be bringing my laptop on the trip, so updates are likely to be few and far between. I will, however, try to seek out some form of internet access to keep this updated, so don't stop visiting me here. (While you're at it, take some time to fill out the questionnaire below. I've been thoroughly enjoying reading the responses, although I had no idea so many people had things they wanted to tell me and didn't.)   And in reference to the title, I had a dream last night where everyone was speaking in iambic pentameter, spewing romantic poems to everyone in sight. (I, unfortunately, was not the recipient of any of those poems. Alas.) It's also an increasing realization that we are who we make ourselves and nothing more or less than that. A sweeping general philosophical statement, indeed, but one I've been finding very true lately.   We are such stuff  As dreams are made on, and our little life Is rounded with a sleep.  (Prospero 4.1.156-158)

      If I get into  urlLink UNC's honor program , I'm going. It's cheap, close to home, an awesome education, and I get money to travel. Sweet deal. Their classics and philosophy programs are pretty well-known, which is always comforting, and the history isn't bad either.   On another college-related note, my parents are actually going to let me apply to  urlLink Cambridge  and  urlLink Oxford . In England. Turns out that going there is actually cheaper than going to a private college here, or sometimes even an out-of-state university. Crazy.  Also, there are  urlLink new pictures . I got bored. Sue me.   And hey, did Blogger go and change on me again? I really liked that "preview" thing and now it's gone. Alas.

      I was a good citizen this morning and wrote letters to a handful of Senators about  urlLink a bill that just passed the House  which would start school later and eliminate teacher workdays, among other things. For anyone who's taken an AP test, you know it's not fun to have practically a month less to prepare. It may be too late, but I thought I'd write in just the same.   Anywho, the rest of my day will be filled with French and vacuums. Good times in the neighborhood.

      Tuesday: Work Wednesday: Work Friday: Packing (part I) Saturday: Class at Ornamentea, packing (part II) Sunday: Jet-setting to Bellingham  Oh, I also went to see King Arthur today. It was OK, considering it didn't follow the story  at all . I was very upset. Parts of it were tolerable, though. If you're really bored and have already seen Spider-Man 2 and Harry Potter and have money to burn, go for it. Otherwise, sit this one out. Unless, of course, you don't give a damn about the actual myth and just want to see the movie for what it is and not what it's supposed to be. (Grr.)   I cleaned my room today. Mmm, clear surfaces.  The only summer work I have left is my French (which, conveniently enough I haven't even started). It's daunting, but my goal is to get it all done before I leave on vacation again. Wish me luck.

      At long last, it's  urlLink mine ! I'm so very excited. I've been playing with it ever since we got home and have come to the conclusion that this iPod thing is  way  too much fun. I've been dancing all around the house to music no one else can hear. It's great. Work finally paid off.

      I got this new book the other day. It's called "The Solitaire Mystery" and is by Jostein Gaarder - the same guy who wrote one of my favorite books ever: "Sophie's World." I read the first bit in the store but haven't read any more since because I want to wait until I get on the plane to finish it. It has a similar tone to "Sophie's World" - that same kind of philosophical roundabout feel with the occasional history/philosophy lesson stuck in. It's very exciting, and I can't wait to get on the plane so I can start it again.   On another totally random note, I think there's an Australian philosophy class reading this blog. Hey there, cool Australian kids! I'll be the first to admit that Australian high school students are probably way cooler than American high school students. Their accents are cooler, they look at maps upside down... it's just better all around.  (Woah. I just realized I'm listening to Australian music. Scary.)  The light bulb in my room just exploded. Wahoo! I only jumped about three feet in the air this time.   Tomorrow will be an exciting and momentous day. I go to Southpoint to (at last) get my iPod! Hallelujah! I'm way psyched. Unfortunately, I found out the totally awesome guy who worked at the Apple store  urlLink when we bought our computer and my laptop  - Casey - isn't there any more. He moved to the other store in Charlotte. Alas! With any luck everything should still go well. We're also going to find out how to connect this thing to a DSL port they have in the hotel room in Bellingham, so I just might get to update during our vacation.   I think I'd better go replace that light bulb.

      I had a dream last night. I don't remember the whole thing, but there are some parts that stand out very vividly in my mind.   - There were pirate ships. I was on one and there was another one filled with bad people. There was also an island where people would occasionally go and run around on the trains.  - Our pirate ship had something very valuable: an ancient something or other having to do with a nuclear thingamagig (it made sense in the dream). The other ship wanted it, and some sneaky people from their ship snuck onto ours and found out the secret way to activate it. We had to stop them from invading the ship and taking our nuclear thingamagig.  - A few people from our ship went on the island to find this plate that could stop the people on the other ship. Meanwhile, the rest of us were trying to rig up some plan to prevent the other people from getting to the part of the ship with the nuclear thing.  - We must have developed an obstacle course or something very similar, because I remember later in the dream having to go through one while being followed by people from the other ship. It was hard as hell.  - Dr. Humble was the captain of our ship, and also the director/producer of the reality show we were all starring on.  - All the bathrooms had white doors with orange ribbons on the doorknobs.  Does this compete with my  urlLink iPods and titrations dream  for weirdness? I certainly think so.

      Sometimes I feel like this thing causes more grief than it's worth. It's nothing in particular, really, but a collection of things. Why do I feel this compulsive need to share my feelings on the internet? It's more than a little perverse when you really think about it. Somehow my jealousy, sadness, desire, personality defects, abnormalities, and general incompetence are justified when the rest of the world could theoretically see them. It makes me sad that I am that dependent on other people (even those I don't know personally) feeling sorry for me to make myself feel better. Then I think, Well, if it's that bad I should just stop. But I can't bring myself to take that step and hit the delete button. No matter how sick it seems, there is something ultimately very comforting about knowing that someone else out there can commiserate with me in my misery or celebrate with me in my happiness. That when something good happens I can tell the world, and when someone or something is driving me crazy I can have an invisible and possibly world-wide shoulder to cry on. Posting on a blog is so much more satisfying than writing in a journal for the very reason that other people get to watch me develop or occasionally fall. On a similar note, I can't stop reading other people's blogs. Is it voyeuristic to want to read someone else's life and to then get frustrated when they don't update to tell me what's going on? I think maybe I need to give the whole thing up for a while just to have a break from it all, but I simply can't bring myself to do it. I just can't. But maybe I will... I don't know. I think I'm just having an identity crisis and having this piece of the internet linked to me is part of it. Do I want it? Do I really want the records - often personal - of the past year and some months published for the world to see? I don't think so, but it feels so good knowing I can post something to let people know I'm sad, or that something really wonderful just happened and I have to tell someone. I think every blogger must go through this at some point or another - it just hasn't happened to me until now. I hate this feeling.   Indecisiveness: one of my major personality flaws and yet another one that everyone now gets to see.

      More work today. This time I got to do odd jobs at the office since they didn't have time to pull the hundreds of charts I needed for my study (go figure). I read through stacks of insurance claims, fiddled around with some data I'd already gathered, and spent about five hours doing backbends and Stair Master-type steps whilst trying to file some loose papers back into their charts. There's this gigantic room filled to the brim with charts in bookcases that go all the way to the ceiling. It's pretty impressive. The problem is they're not organized in ascending order by number. Instead, there's this complicated bar coding system which unfortunately mixes them all up, but if you know where to look you can usually find what you need. My difficulty was not so much in finding the charts (although that wasn't the easiest job I've ever had) but in reaching them. The stacks were so tall I had to get a ladder, and since the logistics prevented me from taking the papers up with me, I had to climb up the ladder, look for the chart, climb down, make sure I got the right number, realize I didn't and then climb back up, find the right chart, climb down, bend down, get the papers I needed, put them in the chart, climb back up the ladder, put the chart back, come down, realize I missed a page, climb up, get the chart, climb down, put the rest of the pages back in and check to make sure there aren't any more, climb up, put the chart back, come back down and start the whole thing over. My back  kills  right now.   Fortunately, I get paid. Awesome. I am currently only a few dollars away from my dream:      Mmmm... mine.

      The Maroon 5 song mentioned in the previous post - "Woman" from the Spider-Man 2 soundtrack - may very well be the Sexiest Song Alive. (Yes, it is alive.) Don't believe me? Listen to it and then look up the lyrics. Mmmmmmmmmm... so good.

      I need a vacation. The family is starting to crowd in on my alone time. I just need to get out of the house for a few days. Thus, the countdown begins: I leave again on July 18 for Bellingham, Washington. Excitement!  Also, the new favorite song is Jet, "Hold On" from the Spider-Man 2 soundtrack. For those who have seen the movie, it's the song playing while Peter is getting dressed to see Mary Jane's show. It's sweet, romantic, and gives me warm fuzzies every time I hear it. The Maroon 5 song, "Woman," is also quite nice. I'm currently listening to the soundtrack, and I very much hope to be as delighted by the rest of it as I am with the few tracks I have already listened to.

      We lit up some "fireworks" in celebration of the big event. In truth, they were more like sputtering retarded blue flames that sparked every once in a while at the end of our driveway, but they were fun nonetheless. (And just a little reflective of the way my family likes to do holidays, I think.)   We also went to see Spider-Man. I saw it for the first time yesterday and gave such rave reviews of it that everyone wanted to see it. Although I got a little bored in the first part - it's a little slow anyway and I already knew everything that was going on - I must confess I found it very delightful overall. My mom mentioned afterwards that she looked over at me during the movie and said I smiled the most when Peter was sitting in his room doing his homework. I thought this was a little sad on my part, but I'm willing to bet that it's probably the truth. As a well-trusted critic and friend said, I give it three out of four stars.   From my room I can hear, but not see, the fireworks at the fairgrounds. They sound nice. Curse them.

      Having recently discovered  urlLink J.K. Rowling's website , I spent a good while playing around on it today. Not only are there some interesting tidbits of information hidden within, but if you are especially clever you can find some really fun things. My personal favorite? The title of the sixth book of course! It can be found through a portkey in the middle of the page, and from there you will find some interesting bricks... If you absolutely cannot figure it out, I am willing to share the secret with you on your request. Leave an email address in a comment (if I know you well you obviously don't need to leave an address) and I'll tell you. I spent at least half an hour trying to figure it out, and in the end it was really just sheer luck. In addition to the book title, there are a few other good scraps to be found - I think I've got all of them, but I cannot be sure. Let me know what you find; it would be fantastic to find something new.   Happy hunting, and good luck!

      I played dress-up this afternoon in tribute to years ago during rainy summer days. I wish I'd taken pictures.   I can't tell if I want summer to be over or not. I'm excited to go back - classes are going to rock like never before - but on the other hand I love so much the relaxation and lack of stress that summer brings.   I feel like I should say something philosophical here about childhood and growing up, but I'm way too sleepy.   By the way, I've been posting a little more frequently on the  urlLink LiveJournal  than here recently. It's really just the thrill of something new, I think. You might check there if you've been feeling lonely here. But never fear! I am not about to let my internet friend of a year and some go right now. This piece of internet will remain for now, so keep visiting.
