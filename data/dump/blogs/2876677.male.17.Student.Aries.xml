      I think I may go crazy.  My computer is next to my parents and my brother is on it but meanwhile he is also talking on the phone with John.  Nice kid I've talked to him but he's not the brightest star in the sky.  So listening to "dude...no way dude...DUUUDDDEE...that's crazy dude" is like getting run over by a car over and over and over and over.  I dont know how much more idiocy I can be inundated with.  I have to take the SAT soon and I feel all wisdom, knowledge, et cetera being drilled out of my head.  From what I hear from my brother and his friend-on-the-phone the mullet may be resurfacing as something attractive/cool.  *bangs head againt sharp object*   College is coming up soon.  I am praying for a cool, intelligent, friendly, mature Christian as a roomate.  I think I seriously may die if I listen to this conversation any longer.  DUDE!!!!  HAH HAH HAH  THATS CRAZY!!! WOAH!!!  SERIOUSLY NO WAY!!!  I feel like my ears are on crack...  I should write a book on this or film him for TV.  I bet people would buy.  Primetime or PPV  I dunno.  I wonder if there is a circus I could pay to kidnap him.  DUDE MY PARENTS SET UP THE COMP TO KICK ME OFF AT 9.  THATS SOOOO DUMB KID!  (DAD HOW COME DUSTIN DOESNT HAVE TO GET OFF?)  ummm  he is 17.  *hey what is this on my hand-oh my brain has actually started dripping out my ears*  so i was like...oh my word...dude...no way...seriously...dude...craziness...i know...wow kid...did you know in brazil they wear speedos...dude i know its crazy...well i wont contaminate you any more

      Irritation.  The school implemented a new talking rule today.  Good for them.  I really don't care because I have the ability to get serious when it is serious time.  My parents are upset because Seth got kicked out.  He is the retard.  They think it is unfair the first kid gets warned and the second kid gets punished.  Maybe so.  I don't care.  It is doubtful my class will ever have to deal with it.  Even if we do, I think I can handle a zero in a few classes for day.  Who cares.  Life is life.  Move on.  Blah blah.  Maybe there should be a blanket warning at the beginning to all kids and then the first kid gets kicked out.  I don't care.

      Who am I?  Who are you?  Is my past real?  Am I real?  Am I just a figment of a greater being's imagination?  Are you real?  Are you a figment of my imagination?  Is the physical real?  Am I just a figment of my imagination?  Is my body a projection of my soul?  Does reality exist in this world or in my observation of it?  What is time?  Is history real?

      I think I am falling...not in love.  I am falling into the early stages of wanting a relationship with someone I have a friendship with.  However, I have not yet decided if I am going to pursue it.  Am I mature enough to be involved in a relationship?  Can I acurately judge my own maturity?  Is she mature enough to enter a relationship?  Should I enter a relationship so close to leaving for college?  What does God want?  Life is so confusing.

      I am irritated.  Alot.  I went to a "Christian" bookstore *cough*in K-mart plaza*cough* and I spent about 45 minutes trying to find something Christian.  I would have left and gone to Barnes and Noble but the only reason I was there in the first place was because I had a gift certificate.  It was a time and a half.  I went up and down the two aisles that applied to me.  There was one aisle of Bibles.  I use the term loosely.  Then next aisle was concordances, and reference books and such like.  Then there were two aisles of Charismatic and an aisle of Christian fiction.  Then a Catholic aisle and a miscellaneous aisle.  No Baptist aisle.  No good books written 50 years ago aisle.  I saw quite a few books that I saw and really wanted but then I picked them up and it would say "Translated in to modern English" or "Bible references updated to NIV or NASV".  It was irritating.  There were no books older than 1995.  It was insanely irritating.  I finally bought a concordance.  Then I went to check out.  The girl was dressed rather interestingly...  Her chest was about to fall out of her shirt.  Her pants were so low and tight I could see her underwear(not just a little bit).  Her shirt was also so high I could see her navel ring.  We won't even mention the music.  Long story.  Good times.

      Pre-teens are REALLY starting to annoy me.  I go to the mall and there are all these little kids BY THEMSELVES.  Maybe I am sheltered or overprotected, but I was never just dropped at the mall to "hang out".  Actually, I wasn't even dropped off to shop until I got my first job.  My parents theory was if I was spending their money it would not just be given to me to wander around the mall by myself and shop at 12 years old.  All these little girls, with no clothes on walking with their backs arched(if you GMD) looking for boyfriends.  All these little boys, dressed up like they thugs with the baggy pants and the bling bling, limping around trying to attract a girl.  Little girls, find a healthy young boy that can walk right whose pants fit.  Little boys, get a girl who wants to get married and keep her body for the two of you.  You may find it attractive when you're in the mall holding hands walking, but if she is wearing some low rise pants and a halter top she is advertising that she is availible for another guy.  I don't know if this is the case at all malls but whenever Kevin and I go to Searstown, all these little girls are walking around with thongs on the outside of their pants trying to get noticed. Gonna get noticed by a rapist is whats gonna happen.  Do their parents drop them off like that?  Do they put them on when they get to the mall?  Parents, when you pick your kids up from the mall, ground them.  It is safe to assume that since you were enough of an idiot to drop your little girl or boy off at the mall for 4 hours, they inherited the idiocy.

      Wow.  Fun times.  I just went bowling and I am so tired.  It was good.  It was just Emi, Jenna, and I until 7:30 and then Jess showed up.  I had gotten two lanes cuz I thought more people were coming but then they didn't show so we had twice the fun.  Then at 8 I brought it down to one lane because it was just the four of us.  We had some good times.  Meanwhile, I am trying to get ahold of J Trinkle and Miss Vasel who are not answering.  At 8, I decide they just got lost(it is Miss Vasel) and stop calling.  At 8:30, guess who shows up?  Yep.  The Lost Girls.  So all six of us crowded on one lane.  Then the stupid computer thing wouldn't stop messing up when we added them in.  On the lane next to us, these college kids had showed up and were getting a little friendly.  Especially when someone got a strike.  I wanted to give them the Yellow Pages and help em find a room cuz they were in the wrong place.  Mr. and Mrs.Gomez couldn't come...:(  She wasn't feeling to well.  Pregnancy can do that to ya.  Been there. done that. never again.  Hope ya feel better.  Thank you for having your baby "legitimately".  Alot of couples have opted out of that.  Kids get really messed up that way.  Mom M,W,F. Dad T,Th,Sat.  Sunday is a coin flip.  It can be fun.  So remember kids:"Fun" now, makes "trouble" later.  A little wait will help you appreciate.  I ALMOST RAN OVER A CAT!  Ok I was on my way home and I was on this street before my street.  I don't know the name.  Well anyways I saw this gray thing slinking across the road and decided to slow down cuz I thought it was a squirrel and last time I ran over an animal, the sound made me want to throw up.  I was really glad when I slowed down because I found out it was a cat and I don't want to kill some little kids pet.  That would be sad.

      I really need to get out of this school.  It is so not helping my growth.  The words said in the hallway, the songs sung, the movies that are talked about are all definitely not what God has for my ears.  It is upsetting.  Everyone in my school is so liberal and they just keep drifting.  Socioeconomically, they are somewhat conservative, but on a lifestyle or faith basis they are following the world from a distance.  A distance that seems to shorten as time goes by.  I pray that the Holy Spirit will make some changes in the school as a whole.  Spiritual edification is not even thought of.  It would be awful to think that maybe the movies are wrong.  Maybe I should study it out in the Bible and pray about it.  Instead, I will bask in my sin and call the person who would make such a claim a backwards idiot stuck in the 1800s.  Definitely what "Christians" should say about each other.

      Physical education.  Some days it is good.  Some days it is not.  I guess it all depends on whether or not my body feels like learning.  There are other factors though too.  Amount of sunlight, temperature, wind chill, heat index, how the classes before went, what we are playing, and the other people on my team are just a few.  Today started out alright, drifted up, came down, shot skyward, and plummeted back down again.  I guess I just don't understand people.  People don't understand me though so I guess the feeling is mutual.  Speaking of being misunderstood, I am sick of people saying "You just don't understand" or "It doesn't matter what I look like.  It's what on the inside that counts."  I do understand. You are shallow.  What is on the outside does mater.  Generally, it reflects the inside.  You are probably not the exception.  Whoah!  That was a little off the beaten path. Where was I?  Oh right!  I just don't understand people.  I am wicked competitive.  I HATE losing!  I used to be the worst loser ever.  Then in second grade, I grew up.  Hasn't happened yet in my gym class.  I was a fairly poor winner too until probably ninth grade.  I have mostly grew out of that though.  Anyways, PE can be fun.  People get way too aggressive.  I mean "play hard"!  Hoo-rah!  Inside of the rules though.  Punching the ground, flipping benches, and throwing students generally are not in the rules.  I am 99%  sure that putting up your middle finger when the teacher turns his back is not in the rules.  Swearing probably goes right along with that but that is more widespread than just PE.  And then there is the making fun of people.  I find it comical when a un-named 400 pound sophmore throws a temper tantrum and hits stuff and swears and lays on the ground holding himself and over-exagerates his injuries.  I am sorry but I really want to inflict actual pain on the pansy when he does that.  Not trying to get pity, I would like to mention that I however ripped through three layers of clothing and my knees, tore open my elbow, received a huge gash to my lower back, and scraped my palms today.  I did not lay on the ground and try to get the gym class to surround me and ask if I was ok.  I got up...then walked over to the side and quietly sat down because my knee hurt.  I feel bad for the seniors.  Sure they say absolutely idiotic stuff but they deal with a lot of unwarranted aggression.  The sophmores, who in general are...the coolest kids I know *cough**nose grows*, give the seniors alot of verbal and physical abuse.  The seniors for the most part don't have much to say back.  I admire the amount of verbal crap they take.  I see them tense up, and then let it roll off.  Not too many people do that today.  I mean after so much, problems escalate but hey what can you do?  BTW me falling I know that must sound funny because it also involves me being "active".  Here is the deal yo.  I was bored in gym.  I didn't want to participate because I have no skill and can't outrun your grandmother.  Yes I meant the one with the walker.  So I just kept walking and then Mr.Doan would walk up and tag me and I would smile and walk back and tap the dumpster and then I would walk back and do it again.  And again.  And again.  Well then something unexpected happened.  I walked through and picked up a cone.  Then I took off as fast as I could.  Again, this is not to fast.  Well I am running and running, trying to get back to the dumpster as fast as I could and I am looking backward to see if I am about to be tagged.  Sidenote:  Me running is dangerous.  Me walking and looking backward is dangerous.  Me running and looking back is a volatile mix.  On the my erratic journey across the blacktop, SO CLOSE TO THE DUMPSTER, my feet had a little disagreement about something(I couldn't hear too well cuz my ears are so far away and I didn't want to stop and ask at the time), and then the blacktop and I had some one-on-one time.  I ripped through my second favorite pair of pants.  No not the gym pants.  I was wearing these awesome pajamas under my pants as I always do and now I have holes in my knees and this wonderful spot where the blood dried.  mmm...That was a joy to pull from my leg.  Then I did my homework.  Mr.Gomez I put my heart into that paper.  Actually, just some blood from my wrist.  It was an awkward place for a band-aid so I just decided to bleed on the paper.  Not too much.  Just enough to remember me by.  I got the package in the mail.  It said "STRAIGHT TALK" on the front in cool letters on the front and my first thought was "I don't remember joining any supremacy groups."  As it turns out, it was just a little dvd on BJU and "the facts" about campus life.  funny stuff...

      Today was good.  I decided when I woke up not to let anything get me down.  It didn't work but I still had a good day.  I really feel lighter with the burden of bitterness off my shoulders.  It might have something to do with fact I have stopped eating though too.  I got a compliment on my writing today.  I was told that even though the person doesn't agree with my point-of-view that my journal was well written.  How cool is that?  Now its not as if this compliment came from an English major but still it was nice.  Today was good.  I got caught up on some work, shot at the breeze, and sat bored out of my mind in study hall.  I really wish I could leave...more often than I do.  It is boring.  I have nothing to do except listen to the seniors.  Let me tell you firsthand, as a survivor of the mind-numbing, hearing about car engines and freshman for 50 minutes is not fun.  Independence is what I need.  I don't know.  I guess I can wait although it is pretty boring being seventeen.  Not much different than the boredom of sixteen.  I didn't accrue any rights or priviliges.  Just a day.  It will fade away.  So will everything else though I guess.  Everything reaches a peak and then just fades away.  Your body, intelligence, wealth, and some other stuff too I guess.  Vanity, vanity, all is vanity.  You know what's nice?   Holding someone real close and feeling them breathe.  Feeling their chest rise and fall.  Feeling their heart beat next to yours.  Not that I would know. ;)  I guess what I am trying to say is

      Life is lonely when you have to re-establish trust.  I feel like I can't trust anybody now actually.  When one person stabs you, it makes you wonder if everyone else is getting ready to.

      Well wisdom kicked in and I deleted a post.  If you read it then you read it, but if you didn't than you dont need to know content.  Needless to say it was not appropriate of the Christian I am striving to be.  I really need to learn to cool it and turn the other cheek.  Definitely going to be an area I need to work on.

      The coolest thing ever would have to be...intelligent conversation.  I love talking to people and piquing their brains for information.  Questions!  I love those.  I like answering questions with a question.  I like being answered with a question.  Its fun.  I like getting out a three-hundred pound concordance and searching for verses.  It is definitely much easier to open up a Bible program and have all the references pop up on my screen for almost any given topic, but it just isnt the same.  Books are just fun.  Not to get off the subject too much (although it is my blog so I can do what I want...), my library is driving me insane.  If a person from 200 years ago were to go to a present day library I think they would be appalled.  25 rows of DVDs compared to 10 rows of books.  This is very irritating.  Libraries today are filled with the likes of  Scary Movie , brand new computers with flat panel monitors, and  Seventeen  magazine.  All this worthless depravity and no Paul Bunyan or Soren Kirkegaard.  I will find you hard-pressed to find any book that does not have pictures, or a liberal slant, or a book written over 20 years ago or one about God from anytime.  However Harry Potter is always in stock.  Why they even have curtains around some computers for "personal viewing".  How wonderful.  Where is the education in a place supposed to house our knowledge?  We as a people are going downhill.  People can't read a two page paper but they can sit through Return of the King.  No one knows how to use their imaginations these days...  I hate it.  My kids are being read CS Lewis to bed and are listening to Bach.  People are just dumb.  I have been dumbed down to some extent.  You definitely have...

      Well its been about...three days since I last wrote to my journal.  Long time.  The only reason I am writing now is because I can't sleep.  I have been up since two.  I had the WORST dream I have ever had!  I am not exaggerating.  It frightened me.  It was not a horror dream.  It was a normal day...with twists.  Awful, gut-wrenching twists, that tore my soul in two.  It was like a premonition of today.  I am really hoping the dream is not foreshadowing what is to come.  If it is I will throw up.  I spent from 2:00-3:30 thinking about it.  At that time, I thought it was the yesterday, and I was sickened and just could not go to school.  At about 3:30, I realized that it could not have been a Monday in my dream and that it was "just a dream".  I spent the next half hour or so praising God that these people I had dreamed about had not said the awful things they said and done the awful things I thought they had done.  I was so thankful because in my dream I was shocked these people were doing all these things.  People I respect, People I trust, People I look up to were all doing horrible sin and everyone was participating.  It seemed like everyone was ignoring me and no one cared what I was saying about God.  I left in disgust.  Only one person left to follow me to see why I just walked out as if he could not understand why.  I told him I could not believe he had just said the things he talked about.  I could not believe he had sunken to the levels of my peers.  With sadness in his eyes, he left.  I rejoiced thinking he had repented.  I went back to talk to him more only to see him back doing the same things.  He looked at me with hate and told me never to come back .  It killed my heart.  The dream was so intense so real.  I pray it doesn not happen.  It has already been four and a half hours and it stills feels real and personal.  My hero feels shattered and broken.  I do not know if I can face him.  I do not know if I can go and look at him and think of him the same as before.  It was not him.  I know it was not him.  I know it was a dream.  I know he did not truly say the words echoing in my head.  I know he did not do the things seared into my memory, flooding back across the screens of my eyes every time I close them.  The suffering was so intense, the debauchery so real, the hate so painful-it was real to me.  I hope I can get over this dream.  I know everyone was awful but for some reason even in the dream he is the only one that seemed unnatural.  The only one I truly could not believe was sinning so grossly and profanely.  The one who initiated it.  I pray I can concentrate today, but my heart still hurts from my wicked imaginations.  I wish I could wipe this dream away.  Only I know that the man I saw in my dream is real.  He is inside my hero, inside you,...inside me.

      I was downloading the newest version of Quicktime about...2 hours ago and decided to watch a movie clip from online.  Well I chose Setve Job's Macworld Expo keynote speech...Wow it was two hours long...Very charismatic though...made me want a G5...during the keynote he had a few of people come on stage to talk about their product.  The only one I can remember is the Microsoft Office 2004 lady because she was SOOOO drunk.  I mean she was swaying ALOT and just looked plastered.  I couldn't believe it.  If she was sober, and that was Microsoft's best, they have some problems...Well at least I got some work done while I watched.  I learned what teraflop means too.  Cool word.  Tro, teraflop,... this week had some good "t" words.

      i am getting frustrated with people making up stuff.  they see 10 seconds of one incident and make up 10 minutes worth of gossip.  Seriously, my business is my business.  Noone has a life so they talk about everyone else.  I am getting sick of "Christian" school.  In math class, if you want to say "This isn't going to help me in real life.", go ahead, you are probably wrong, but go ahead.  In Bible class, however, I just do not understand how my "Christian" peers can talk and not pay any attention.  ITS THE BIBLE!!!  It important for our spiritual growth!!!  We are learning how to intelligently defend our faith!  ISN'T THAT IMPORTANT TO ANYONE???  *takes deep breath*  I need to better obey the rules.  I have made a genuine effort in dress code and I need to read the handbook and try the other stuff.  Lead by example...and then never come back.

      i feel wicked lonely...and i don't know why...its this unfathomable and inexcapable lonliness...i don't think i could be more lonely if everyone on the earth died...i don't think i could be less lonely if my best friend showed up right now...its like an invisible wall seperating me from humanity...boy do i hate being a guy...seriously in the locker room today the talk was just absolutely disgusting...learned a new word actually...wonderful! bet i will use it often...i just wanted to tear into everyone of them and tell them what perverts they all are.  doubtful they would care... i really need to be away from all people...seriously EVERYONE IS JUST WICKED myself included.  will tomorrow be better? was today bad? better than yesterday???  what does the future hold?  a wife? a family? a job? celibacy? homelessness?  drug addiction? illegitimate child? christian ministry? opulence? poverty? intelligence? stupidity? a life-changing accident? death of a loved one? country ruled by a dictator? OH TO BE IN HEAVEN.  jenna said "tro" in her prom prospectus and wow isnt that the hottest word ever.  definitely at least a word of the week.  Don't let drowning ruin your summer.  Paddle smart from the start.  I want to go to NYC and bask in my lonliness amidst a swell of humanity.   i dunno.   i am just exhausted...

       I was outside making sure my dog didn't run off while she did her business and I really wish she would just run away...or die.  Seriously she is like 90 something years old and she hasnt died.  Actually she is somewhere in between 98 and 105 according to my calculator.  She really is just holding on.  LET GO AND DIE!!!  well anyways that wasnt even close to where i had intended to go with this blog...I just thought it would be romantic to be kidnapped...Like if I was in college and my g/f had my friends like jump me and take my to her...that would be suprising and romantic...now i dont think it would be romantic vice versa and i would never want to put my g/f through thinking she was being kidnapped. anyways...just my wierd little thought for the day...

      DOCTORS LIE!!!  well i had to get eyedrops from the doctor yesterday and boy are they fun!!!  she tells me they may cause slight burning or irritation...apparently it would be undoctorly to tell a patient that they have found a way to bottle hellfire and that i am supposed to "make a pouch(with my lower eyelid), drop some in, close my eye, allow eye to dissolve. repeat on other eye."

      Well I have heard way to many guys say "I've never cried" or "I haven't cried since I was a little kid".  Frankly I hope its a lie but if its not then I don't see why you think not crying EVER makes you stronger or more masculine.  I mean I don't cry often but I do cry when things happen.  Like when my one of my best friend's sister dies then I cry.  Or when somebody who I really care about tells me they have had sex before marriage and have a STD, then I cry.  I just isn't worth it to hold it in.  Life is way too long to hold it all in every time something goes wrong.  Life is way too short to let it hold me back.  Crying just makes things better.  If you hold all the tear's in, you are drowning your soul.  I really wish I wasn't sick today.  I missed school.  I am missing church.  I MISSED MRS.BODANZA'S PIZZA!!!  Shout out to Jess Booth.  You are a nice kid.  Sometimes I wonder how our school got so lucky.  Sorry for ever being mean to ya. Remember:It's ok to cry.(well not about everything cuz then your just a pansy.)

      Wow!  I am...actually I don't know how I feel...not really happy not sad...just in the middle...Well today went well I guess...but I have not written about Sunday yet...My pastor prayed for me specifically in Sunday morning service that the Lord would help me with all I am trying to do...it was the most moving thing ever...I cried...then Sunday night all these families came up to me and said they were praying for me in their devotions and I wanted to cry again...i love my church...everyone is so nice...Well today I woke up with no voice and a wicked sore throat...well i tried to speak and i could speak it just hurt alot and my class told me that my voice sounder better and deeper and more manly...well i guess that is sort of a compliment but my voice is going to go back and what then???

      Spring is in the air Everywhere I look around Spring is in the air In every sight and every sound.  Such a beautiful day.  I feel like doing a load of laundry and hanging it outside.  It smells so nice.  I have not been alive for very many springs but I love them so much.  I  could be 1000 years old and never have seen Spring too many times.  Bathing in the sunlight walking in the rain.  Spring is so beautiful.  After Winter's long painful travail Spring has finally been born.  It makes life seem so whimsical and carefree and everyone seems happier.  I know I feel rejuvenated.  I turned in an application to Old Navy and I really hope I get a job but if it is not the Lord's will then it is not the Lord's will.  Let it be...  I think I may be bipolar.  I dunno but the weather really does have an effect on my attitude.  *Shouts for joy*

      Well I went to get a job at 9:00 on a Saturday night...what an experience! i went to PacSun and my friend said that they usually start hiring in May(I love having the inside scoop) so I went to the Gap where a woman I highly suspect to be pregnant told me that I had to be 18 so I moved on to Old Navy where I impressed the manager with how well dressed I was and he gave me an application.  Well tomorrow in between services I need to go get Diana's info for a reference.  Guess what!!!  Gap and Old Navy=SAME COMPANY!!!  (same discount) YES!!! Barnes & Noble discount too and Banana Republic but it is doubtful i will be able to shop there with a discount lol.  !!!At pacsun there was this rack that said 9.99 on it so I asked if everything on it was 9.99 cuz it was wicked nice stuff that i have wanted all winter and she said YES!!!  wow unfortunately my excursion that was meant to earn money ended up with me buying a rack of clothing at PacSun but how can you pass up 9.99 for really nice sweaters, jackets, dress shirts and long-sleeve tees??  The answer:YOU CANT!!!

      Mmm...Today was absolutely stunning...I went outside early this morning and the birds were singing and it was absolutely beautiful.  Amazing!!!  I don't know if you know but spring is my favorite time of year.  Well I need to find a job because Bedford is just not fun to drive to or in.  People are so rude.  I mean how much quicker are you going to get somewhere by cutting me off, or honking your horn at someone, or swearing or anything.  Even if you do get there quicker did the ends justify the means?  Why cant everyone just be happy?  I am totally inconsistent with my formatting.  I love that.  Well anyways I am going to apply at Old Navy, and the Gap and hopefully PacSun but I am not quite sure how my mom will feel about that...  I really need clothes and an employee discount wouldn't hurt the cause.  Well today was absolutely the most beautiful day since a long time ago.  I drove with my windows down (and the heat on because an unnamed passenger thought it was too chilly and that he might catch a cold.)  mmm...fresh spring air...bare feet in the wet grass...delightful...well i am off to get work. urlLink Hint Hint

      Apparently lack of sleep is not only dangerous when you are driving but also when you are home alone.  I fell asleep while I was doing Economics and I had a dream I was stabbed to death while I was sleeping.  What a comfort...Well now I am really tired and I can't go to sleep because I am here by myself and I just predicted own death.  Abraham Lincoln had a dream about dying and look what happened to him.  Also being stabbed to death is in my opinion one of the worst ways to die.  I would much rather have the blood sucked out of my neck(Hi Hannah).  Apparently "some people" find vampirism abnormal but  "unnamed others" find it wicked hott but now is not the time or place to discuss such things.  I need a rotweiler or a gun or both.  I need a big  guard with "MOM" tatooed on his shoulder.  HYMNS!!!  That will help my nerves!!!  HYMNS GRAPEJUICE AND A GOOD BOOK!!!  unfortunately  i am too afraid of the man in the hooded robe who stabs me repeatedly in the back of the head to actually go get my book or juice so I will just sing "Come Thou Fount".  my house is way too dark and creepy...I wish Jesus would bodily come forth or an angel...pretty much anybody.  You know what would be nice... if Mr.President were to knock on my door and offer Secret Service protection(from myself).  Actually if someone were to knock on that door I would have a heart attack and die and save my murderer the trouble...What a coward...i can wait till i am old enough to own a gun cuz in moments like this i need it.  i think getting married will help because then i will have another human to talk to and also the protection instinct will kick in...sorta like when a mom lifts a car off her kid.  how does the kid get under a parked car anyways?  where is the driver to this vehicle?  something to think about...

      I lied...well not on purpose...but anyways i said a few days ago that everybody has enough time just not the right priorities.  well come to find out i dont have enough time...i have school then homeschool then work then friends...sad life...well now i would like to add a couple ministries and i dont know where to fit them...so thankful i dont have a g/f cuz she would probably have to go...heartless but i would have to have divine intervention for me to believe that God wants me to be in a relationship right now even if someone did want me...well actually people have shown interest i just had higher standards so they dont count...well anyways back to my non-life...i think i may have to drop work(or sleep) which means i would also have to drop my phone and eat the contract but that would mean that i would have to drop my car insurance too and i need that to get to school and any ministry or anywhere AND i would have to empty my savings for books and stuff cuz my parents want me to buy my own books for responsiblity AND I WOULD MISS MY PHONE SOOOO MUCH!!!well actually now that i have been thinking about it i guess i do have time just not priorities...i could be working instead of writing and i could only go online to talk to BJU and i could sever any and all human relationships i have...but i would prefer that God would hold the sun for me.

Contest YAY! link).  well now i gotta go back to my beloved, the keynesian theory of economics.  oh how happy she makes me.  we will be up till 11 getting to know each other better (inserts sarcastic yay!)

      Everybody loves some good competition, especially free-market economies(just putting some new knowledge to work).  Well anyways my brain was overloaded so I decided to write a 'lil entry.  This blog needs a name.   Happy Flowers  just isn't milking the goat if you GMD.  I know it was  Dead Souls   but some people aren't well acquainted with the Russian classics and thought it was a bit morbid.   urlLink Send your name   If your blog name is chosen, your name will be put in a hat with 100 of mine and if it is pulled you may be eligible to recieve a nice unspoken passing thought from me.  Good luck and may the best win.  Few will enter, I will win.

What a blessing!!!...unfortunately i did not get all my other 3000 projects done...I think i have given up studying for the SAT and ACT  I just need to relax...if college is anything like this I think I am going to die...I need a girlfriend!

      Well I think I might pass out!  I am writing my research paper, doing pre-cal h/w, and i just got this lil poem and even though the end is doctrinally unsound I thought the rest applied to my life so I posted it.  I knelt to pray but not for long,  I had too much to do.  I had to hurry and get to work  For bills would soon be due.  So I knelt and said a hurried prayer,  And jumped up off my knees.  My Christian duty was now done  My soul could rest at ease.  All day long I had no time  To spread a word of cheer.  No time to speak of Christ to friends,  They'd laugh at me I'd fear.  No time, no time, too much to do,  That was my constant cry,  No time to give to souls in need  But at last the time, the time to die.  I went before the Lord, I came,  I stood with downcast eyes.  For in his hands God held a book;  It was the book of life.  God looked into his book and said  'Your name I cannot find.  I once was going to write it down...  But never found the time.'

I have a feeling I am going to be pretty much poor for the rest of my life.  well its not whatcha got its whatcha ...(insert happy maxim here)...well church starts soon so i guess that is all for now

      Hey!  Wow I guess quite a few people have read my 'lil journal!  That makes my day.  Well actually God made my day.  And I was already happy before that because today in English my contact fell out and so during lunch I called my mom to ask her to bring me one so I could see driving home AND she said my PACEs had just arrived when I called.  I am such a dork.  I am so excited about homeschool.  How often do you hear a kid say that???? Not often.  I am very irritated.  As you know if you read through all my pet peeves (apparently a difficult task), you would know that I absolutely ABHOR being told GOOD JOB in PE.  well anyways after dodgeball in PE today all the guys said GOOD JOB Dustin!  It was NOT a good job!!!  I was a total klutz.  Now on a day I actually participate I do not mind Nice try or something to that effect but NEVER can anything I EVER do in PE be considered a GOOD JOB!!!  Oh almost forgot that I have to make a list of 100 things I like. I think I will make that a seperate post.  BTW Jess you can find my web journal at http://triquetta17.blogspot.com

      HOLY COW!!!  I AM SUCH A JERK!!!  I almost cried.  I did something irreprehensible.  I am so embarrassed.  I made a young lady come after me.  I feel so bad.  Ok Well here is what happened...I was at BJU this October and it just so happens I walked up and down the aisle on the bus and made friends with everybody.  Seriously...I made my presence known...which is very unlike me...usually I am quiet and laid back when I go somewhere new but on the BJU trip I EXPLODED...well anyway back to this young lady...One of the people I made friends with was a young woman Jaspa.  Well anyways we were talking on the way home and we exchange addresses and she gave me a picture of herself and I am not in the habit of keeping pictures of myself on myself so I gave her my student ID.  well on the back her picture she wrote the following message "Rusty it was awesome to meet you and get to know you.  You're a pretty cool dude (and a gentleman!)" and then I PROMISED TO WRITE TO HER!!!  well anyways we went home and I put her pic w/ all the other pics I have and everytime I went by it I thought of my promise.  but i am lazy and a sloth and from what I have found did a very "guyish" thing (apparently most men do not like writing letters either).  TODAY HOWEVER i got a letter in the mail from guess who.  thats right JASPA BOUCHARD!  I felt SOOO bad. to make matters worse i open the letter and she says that she has NEVER pursued a young man IN ANY WAY NOT EVEN IN A LETTER!!!  I have caused a young woman to break her principles and I am mildly flattered/embarrassed.  WHAT A JERK!!! well anyways thats it for now

       urlLink One Year Anniversary  Bush Flash Dot Com-Your major source for all your propaganda needs.  I thought this was an interesting bit of film.  Just so everyone knows, I am against war.  War entails having people kill people.  I am against murder. "Thou shall not kill" does not have a wartime clause.  Turn the other cheek.  "What about protecting our rights?" you ask.  We have no rights.  Jesus was killed and he did not fight back.  He did not allow his disciples to fight back.  So a dictatorship might not be the best political-economic system.  That is alright.  I am against trying to pacify madmen.  I am not a pacifist.  Non-violent resistance.  If they win, they win.  So we have no rights.  Do we need the freedoms to be Christian?  No.  So quality of life is not the best in Communism.  The church flourishes under great persecution.  Think church at Smyrna.  Night.

      Well today I went to school more preppy than I normally do(I felt very "casual CEO").  Well anyways it was a good day at school.  I got home and changed before my grandparents(who are staying with us this weekend) saw me.  I decided to go "Hipster Scout" this evening.  Needless to say, the reaction to me dressed this way was quite interesting.  No one understands why I like to dress this way.  Not even me.  Some days I like prep*  Some days I like Hipster Scout.    *By prep, I do not mean Abercrombie, AE, or Aero.  I mean nice clothing.  Like Gap, and Banana Republic and Structure and occasionally Old Navy has some nice clothes.  When I say prep, I mean nice classy looking clothing.  Not faded ripped up shorts and tees with "Abercrombie" written across the front in permanent marker.

      I have decided that the guy I marry  has  to be somewhat athletic. I know it might be tough to get someone to marry me...but at least give me partial athleticism. Just for a second, I was watching this Dad play baseball with his two boys tonight. It is sad to think that I could throw a baseball better than this man. One of his kids was as tall as my waist, and he wound up and lobed it right into his fathers glove like a champ. Pop on the other hand, managed to hit his child 3 times with the baseball...as I was walking by. I had no idea how long they were there, but all I know is that those boys took a beating. Good intentions had become hazardous.  So yeah. Athletic. I don't think I want my little boys/girls coming to me all bruised and swollen..."Honey, what happened??" "Oh nothing Mom, we were just playing catch with Dad." So first date...you must show me that you can throw a baseball, football, and shoot a three pointer. For the kids, of course. And besides, I would like a little competition.

      I broke the internet.  I was trying to find out my body fat percentage online.  Every site I went to said error.  Apparently, according to the only one that "worked", I have -30.8% body fat.  It said being 5'11 and 105(roughly) lbs. and having a 28" waist line was unhealthly.  Hey, I may be a little on the thin side but at least my stomach is flat.  Just kidding, I would rather have a little pudge(VERY LITTLE) than nothing at all.  I swear I eat all the time.  6 meals a day is what my dietician recommended.  6 meals a day and 4 sets of 10 repititions for each muscle group.  Yeah, the eating six times a day is hard enough to fit in, but working out is just not my thing.  So I will wither away and die before I graduate.  So sad.  C'est la vie.

      First off, BOOYAH!  I got hired at Staple's.  Now on to my post.  I was reading an article on the Presidential race in a periodical I receive and I was suprised at how non-biased it was.  It was amazering.  It gave links to both President Bush and Senator Kerry's websites so a voter could be informed by the candidates themselves.  It did not try to drag down either candidate or build either candidate up.  It just emphasized the importance of voting and being politically active.  I was astounded.  Usually every journalist tries to influence his readers nowadays, instead of just presenting the news without his beliefs.  That periodical was  The Collegian  which is put out by BJU.  I was amazed.  Props to BJU for teaching their journalism students to report the issues fair and balanced.  BTW  I am not a journalist and I have an opinion.  Vote for Alan Keyes 2004.  Holla!  *leaves*

      Today I had an interview with an Italian crime lord.  I have been looking for employment with organized crime but was not expecting to find it at the place I applied.  Actually, I had a list of questions to ask me interviewer when we were talking.  I did not ask them.  It was a one sided story.  He asked me no questions.  I told him no lies.  He was scary.  He made references to "The Family", alot of violence, and for some reason he also used the term "blood" to describe things of the color red.  He said and I quote "The customers and the employees are my family when they are inside this store.  If you don't take care of a customer, I will take of you.  You see this picture.  These my two little girls.  This store puts food on their table.  You treat the customers bad, they don't come back.  They don't come back, these doors close.  These doors close, no food for my little girls.  No food for my little girls, I come after you."  I am dead serious.  Then he went on about how I need to get an education.  How I shouldn't have to live this life forever.  Then some more violent quotes and a little bit of language.  It was fun.  I don't think an interviewer has ever sworn before.  The office was dimly lit and added to the effects.  All in all it was just something else to tell my kids.

      Someone lied to me.  Someone who has always been seemingly upfront about everything.  It was a very inconsequential thing to lie about.  This person is intelligent enough that I would have thought they would have realized I was intelligent enough to know that they were lying.  Trust=broken.  Also, in other news, today was the day.  Everyday for the past two weeks, those who know me well have been betting on when my mania would end.  Usually it lasts for 1-6 days followed by a long pessimistic depression.  Today, the glass ceiling shattered.  The floor went out too.  I really am upset and it all started with one comment I heard from someone I would not expect to hear it from.  Hopefully, the happy thoughts come back quickly and stay for a long time.  Until then, the glass is not even half-empty.

      Well, I for one am very glad a certain someone got rid of the background music to his blog. Who's with me?  In other news, I have decided that as soon as my kid can walk, they are going to be potty trained. This  will  happen. I had a fun little experience with a 3 year old this past Sunday that I never want repeated. Ever. **sterilizes hands again**  Humm, so did you hear they are making a new 50 dollar bill? Yeah, I know. Looks like I'll have a more difficult time printin' em out. Darn those new hues. This makes my life so much more stressful. How will I pay for my TrippleX clothes? The skinny girls get all the deals. **shrugs** Recently I purchased a parachute, and might I say what a wise investment. They are colorful, durable, a little tight but modest enough, and they serve a dual purpose. I am currently unemployed, but I think modeling could prove to be an excellent career choice for me sometime in the near future. Everyone needs some wholesome Jenna: A picture of perfect health. Perhaps I could enter a pageant for a few bucks? I would need money to spend on a personal coach though. So if you would like to sponsor me speak up. Personal coaches are the best, you pay them to fluff your ego and fill you with a false sense of pride. Whoa, *idea*, I could totally pull that one off. I mean getting paid to sit down, eat and lie? Who could pass that up?....ahhh, so many jobs for the Jenna, so little time.   Speaking of time, look how much I just wasted yours. Comment if you luff me.

      You kill me.   Every day.  Your decisions hurt.  Watching you walk down that road tears at my heart.  I hate myself for letting you do this to me.  You have never made one right decision since I met you.  Yet I stand at the end of the road.  Waiting.  Standing.  Dying.  Wishing you would let me help you.  For the foolishness of my heart turn around.  I love you.  Please don't do this anymore.  I wish I could do something-anything-to turn you around.  I pray to God.  I cry while you ruin your life and the Plan that should have been.  Vulnerant omnia, ultima necat.

      The only person I hate is me because I know what a horrible person I am.  However, so many people drive me insane.  Stupid girls and their need to be "loved."  They will do almost anything to be in a relationship and to have a guy say "I love you."  Apparently, being insanely jealous is not a sign of unstable insecurity but rather just another way for a guy to show how much he loves a certain girl.  Girls are also way too emotional.  Everything is about being "fair" and "love".  Wrong!  Life is not fair.  Get over it.  Stupid guys and their need to "meet people."  Yeah...how about you get over yourself and your desire to have sex with every girl you see.  While you are at it, pull your pants up and find a girl who knows what clothes are.  Oh yeah, wear a t-shirt...one with sleeves, I have no desire to see you stomach or your armpits.  Guys...I really just don't understand.  I have no desire to do a majority of the "guy" things my friends do.  I have no desire to belch or fart on anyone.  I have no desire to be belched or farted on.  Can someone explain to me how guys think?  I also have no desire to hear your problems.  Well, unless you are willing to listen to advice.  If you are going to be dumb again, then don't talk to me.  Ever.  Also, if you make a girl who is my friend cry, unless she was in a mood at the time, do not expect me to be chummy with you.  I also have no desire to hear about what you and your girlfriend/boyfriend did last night...or ever.  I have no desire to see you and your girlfriend/boyfriend "in action".  Get a room.  If you had a bad relationship experience with someone in high school, which you will, do not go back to them two days later after you spent six hours crying to me about it.  They have not matured.  Obviously, you have not.  I can be mean.  If you are dumb and I say something kind a few times do not expect me to do so indefinitely.  Eventually, I will blow up in your face.  Depending on how dumb the mistake, it may take several months to several years.  Eventually, I will tell you in a less than tactful way how I feel about you and the stupid decisions you repeatedly make.  I make exceptions for those who are unsaved.  That is it.  Otherwise, grow a little.

      "One can't complain. I have my friends. Someone spoke to me only yesterday."-Eeyore  I think Eeyore is an inspiration to us all.  Or at least he should be.  His short, yet deep sayings have an impact on us all.  It may be the fact the I am overtired or that someone at Dunkin Donuts enjoys slipping a little something extra in my croissant but everything is really funny...and blurry.  The room hasn't stopped spinning since I got home.

      Some people think evil is on of the most compelling arguments against the existence of God.  Actually, it is one of the best arguments in favor of the existence of God.  What is the definition of "evil?"  Merriam-Webster defines "evil" as "morally bad or wrong; wicked."  Evil means that things are not as they should be.  They have departed from good.  That would mean there is a standard for goodness.  Scholar C.S. Lewis said "I wouldn't have known what crooked was unless I knew what straight was."  In order for somebody to complain about the problem of evil, there must be some transcendent standard of good that it departs from.  That can only be true if God exists.  Can we have moral laws without God?  Atheism, or materialism, teaches that only material things exist.  Moral laws are immaterial and they exist.  Good and evil are both immaterial.  Neither is a physical object one can empircally observe.  Sidenote:  In order to be an atheist, one can neither love nor hate.  In essence, one can neither believe nor disbelieve anything.  "Conciousness" is just random firings of synapses causing action.  Everything happens by chance and nothing can be predicted because everything happened by chance.  We have no free will.  If my synapses fire and I shoot you, it is not my fault.  Technically, I don't exist because "I" am just nerve cells and chemicals.  The death penalty has no purpose because it is not really a penalty.  There is no suffering.  There is nothing to fear in death.  The collection of nerve cells stop firing.  That is all.  PS  This blog is not real.  It is a figment of your imagination.  "I" use the term imagination loosely since you do not really "imagine."  I have no free will and had no choice but to author this blog.  So if "you" disagree, I would apologize but I cannot choose to.  Random chance has prohibited me from it.

      I had really good intentions last night.  My plan was to go out, come back, read my book, and write a report.  I went out and came back...  I usually don't go to bed until 2 and am still wide awake when I go to bed but last night for some reason I was wicked tired and couldn't concentrate on reading.  So I crashed...and today I suffer for it.  I did manage to get a lot of good books on the effects of nuclear radiation.  ...I skimmed one.  Whopops.  What can ya do?  Well I should go.  Last night was fun even though I didn't do what I was supposed to.  Actually, it was probably fun  because  I didn't do what I was supposed to.  PacSun was fun...to say the least.  What a good time...and a memory to tell my kids.  I hope my kids won't do wierd things for money.

      A well-known local speaker gave a little speech on acceptance.  It got me thinking.  I used to change to be accepted.  Now my goal is not for my group to accept me, but to find a group that accepts me.  Clarification: I have decided not to conform to be accepted, but to find a group that accepts "me."  Yeah.  Well anyways, today is definitely a manic day.  I was as bit crazy during study hall.  It was fun.  I think I am going to go to the library and put this energy toward my research paper.  Bye.

      There is alot of food here.  Actually, I have been eating all day.  Someone actually commented on it.  She said, "Everytime I have seen you today, you have been putting food to your mouth."  So true.  What's the problem with that?  Breakfast-Cereal Bar.  Brunch-Croissant.  Lunch-Pizza(quarter).  Early Afternoon Snack-Animal Crackers.  Mid-Afternoon Snack-Ice Cream.  Late Afternoon Snack(Now)-Pizza(whole).  I can't wait for dinner.  I'm a glutton.  So what?

      Well, the race to beat Jenna for best looking blog has been a long one.  I joke of course.  However, in all seriousness it has been quite irritating doing all the little html thingies on my own just guessing what they are.  Sunday night I probably spent two hours getting the banners to look right.  Then last night I spent around an hour adding a "Blog's I Read" section and a counter to the bottom of the page.  Tonight I added a "Contact Me" link and for some reason the font would not change so if it wants to be a thorn in my side then I will just leave it.  Well, not for long, because it is driving me insane.  I just need to figure out how to fix it.  I was told I had no life because I spent so much time on my blog.  Just so you know, the average American watches at least three hours of TV a day.  I do not.  Is it worse to spend three hours watching TV or typing and problem solving?  Something to think about.  Also several people have told me recently I should work out.  I say to you, bah humbug.  I need to gain weight first.  Which I am trying very hard to do.  So after I gain 40-60 pounds...I  may  consider serious physical activity on a daily basis.  Don't quote me on that.

      I take no part in, and do not endorse the advertisement of the "Cat and Girl" comic strip. My co-blogger seems to think it is...funny. However I, along with the rest of the population do not understand this type of humor.  I claim no responsibility for the so called 'humor' you will see on this blog in the form of comic strips.   *Edited for spelling by Site Administrator*

      The term "gay" is widely overused/misused and does not sound anywhere near as intelligent as some of its alternatives.  Also, objects and events do not have a sexuality or personality.  If used in reference to a person, it does not usually have any meaning nowaday.  If used in remark to sexual preference, generally the person referred to is not "gay".  Actually the term "gay", does not actually have anything to do with one's sexuality, rather it refers to a joyous or happy mood, and was stolen by the homosexuals to make them sound more personable and well happy.  Some useful alternatives are  alert, animate, animated, blithe, blithesome, bouncy, brash, carefree, cheerful, cheery, chipper, chirpy, confident, convivial, festive, forward, frivolous, frolicsome, fun-loving, gamesome, glad, gleeful, hilarious, insouciant, jocund, jolly, jovial, joyful, joyous, keen, light-hearted, lively, merry, mirthful, playful, presuming, pushy, rollicking, self-assertive, sparkling, spirited, sportive, sprightly, sunny, vivacious, wild, zippy  if referring to one's mood.  If referring to sexuality, try  homosexual, homophile, inverted, lesbian, queer .  If in need of a derogatory term try...well actually I have decided it would not be good to help you be unkind.

      I was listening to Kiss 108 yesterday and I heard this awesome love song. "All of You is more than enough for all of me For every thirst and every need You satisfy me with Your love And all I have in You is more than enough  You are my supply My breath of life And still more awesome than I know You are my reward worth living for And still more awesome than I know  All of You is more than enough for all of me For every thirst and every need You satisfy me with Your love And all I have in You is more than enough  Youre my sacrifice  Of greatest price  And still more awesome than I know  You are everything You're my coming king And still more awesome than I know   More than all I want More than all I need You are more than enough for me More than all I know More than all I can say You are more than enough for me"  Just kidding, I don't listen to secular radio (unless you count laura ingraham).  Actually, I heard this song in a church.  The people in church thought it was about Jesus.  If it was on the radio(I don't know if it was), people would think boy/girl.  Who is to say which is the right interpretation.  All I am going to say is that a song to God/about God should at least mention him.  This is not winning anyone to the Lord(which is supposedly the purpose of "Christian" artists getting their music played on MTV and such like but I would like to point out that music is not for evangelization but for worship.)  Also this song is not evangelizing anyone.  Its a boy/girl love song.  Christians fall for so much dumb stuff.  Time magazine said "The message of  Friends , in other words, is that there is no normal anymore and that Americans--at least the plurality needed to make a sitcom No. 1--accept that."  So many Christians watch  Friends  because its "funny" or "entertaining" but they "don't support it's beliefs".  By watching a show, you say you are fine with what goes on in it.  Time realizes that.  Why can't Christians?

      Well Friday on Jenna's roof, the outdoors were beautiful and I thought I should sleep outside tomorrow night.  Then Saturday night, Jenna says "torg and i are sleeping outside tonight" apparently she also had that idea out on her roof.  So I thought well if Jenna is doing it too, then it must be a good idea.  Wrong.  Note to self:  If Jenna ever says "I am doing...", don't do it.  Sleeping outside in April in dumb, and now I am sick.

      Well last night was wicked fun.  I was bored so I called up a friend and had that friend call a friend while I called another friend to see what we could do.  Fortunately, no one had any plans (probably due to the lack of a social life...at least in my case).  Well Emi couldn't go anywhere because of family game night so we had a guy's night which I suggest we do regularly.  I had fun and I think they did.  Stu and I went over to Jenna's.  I drove by her house once cuz I didn't want to be first and then came back because his station wagon was there.  So I go in and he isn't there!  It is his brother.  Apparently they don't communicate and did not realize they were going to the same place at the same time...  Well anyways I was the first to arrive so Jenna, the torg and I played pool.  It was a good thing no one was watching.  Then Stu showed up and we walked to Dunkin Donuts.  Then we walked back.  (We got food while we were there.)  Then we went on to Jenna's roof and Stu gave an astronomy lesson.  Very informative.  Then we played pool.  I don't remember who won or if anyone won.  I think we may have stopped or something.  Then we played go fish.  Good times.  Then stu left and we took some personality quizes.  Then I left and got home late.  Like breaking the law late.  After midnight late.  Mum didn't care I was late which was cool 'cause usually every second counts after I am late.  Then this morning she wakes me up at some ungodly hour and asks if I am going on the bike hike.  I am like I was out past midnight, I have a wicked hangover and YOU WANT TO KNOW IF I AM GOING ON THE BIKE HIKE!!!  I think she realized that was a no.  Then my car broke today.  So sad.  It is really broked.  It is at the garage or something.  Meanwhile I am being nagged to buy a car but I am waiting till I find the right car.  Oh wait I did...and they said no you dont need a new car the one you have runs fine.  *scowls*

      Most people like you feel at ease in situations requiring verbal ability, attention to detail, and linear, analytical ability. Whether you know it or not, you are a much stronger written communicator than many, able to get your ideas across better than others.  It's also likely that you are methodical and efficient at many things that you do. You could also be good at math, particularly algebra, which is based on very strict rules that make sense to your logical mind.   You've got a healthy love of life and a killer instinct. Chances are you hate rules, and don't plan on getting old. You're flexible and friendly on top of being innovative and smart. In short, people respect you.  You're extroverted and love being in the spotlight. Your mantra is "work hard, play hard"  you like to live life to the limit.  Your intelligence seems to be the trait that you most value in yourself of the five main traits that affect confidence. You also seem to appreciate this characteristic in others.

      Hey!  Its summer(almost).  You know what that means right?  Yup.  Take off your clothes.  It is way too uncomfortable to wear at least loose pants and modest tee-shirt.  So guys take off yours shirts and throw on some long shorts that you wear so low it looks like you are pants.  Ladies, put on some short-shorts, or some really tight capris that are really low and a really tight top that show your stomach and has a low neckline.  Its gonna be a party.  Spring break.  Woo-hoo!

      Wow I love my license.  Freedom is good.  Like I got to go to Worcester to FACA then to Target then to Dunkin Donuts then back to FACA then to Pizza Hut in Leominster.  Good times.  I managed to be back for curfew.  For once...  I was worried 'cause I was cutting it close but I made it.  People at FACA are so wicked friendly.  You have no idea how many new people I met.  And the people I have met before all come up and talk to me.  I haven't been there since like January and they all recognize me.  The youth pastor thought I was from Texas.  I have no idea why...  Anyways...the reason I went wasn't there...so sad...  I wish things were different...my life is going to be an interesting one...i am definitely determined to make an impact...negatively or positively is something only time will tell.  i want to get married...tommorrow...i already have a wife picked out...and a house...and a job...

      I am so tired.  I need a vacation.  Or rest.  Or alone time.  All three would be nice.  I have no idea what is going on.    I am so confused and tired of it all.  I can't think straight.  I gave up caring so long ago.  Unfortunately, it has turned into widespread apathy...  Everyone is so messed up.  I did have one minor epiphany today.  I used to be that way.  Oh  Whose Line?  was a  little innapropriate last night...  DERR!!!  It always is.  Sometimes(rarely) just a little, most of the time it is just filled with perverseness.  Why even put it on that channel?  Hello???  It is going to be bad.  Think about it.  Wow I was a retard.  Unfortunately a majority of people still are...

      Age as a reflection of emotionally impactful events:  Wow!  Alot happened this weekend.  Not like "I was wicked busy this weekend" (I was though) but like several big things happened.  I had a while on the trip home for introspection.  I realized (or at least now believe) that it is not the passing of time itself that makes one older, but rather the events that occur with the passing of time that change us.  I am probably not the first to have this revelation but it was at least original to me.  I had a lot of major trials this weekend. A few I passed.  Many I failed.  I have learned from all of them though.  Where I will go depends on if I apply what I learned.

      Wow.  The past two days have been crazy.  We will stick to school(good crazy) and not talk about the bad crazy stuff.  Word of advice.  Never sneak out of your home through your window.  Bad idea kids.  School!!!  OK The past two days I have been a servant in 5th grade and 2nd Grade.  Both have cool teachers.  Both have generally cool kids.  I am kidnapping Luke, a second grader, the coolest little kid in the world.  I said to Mrs. Palacios "That kid is so cool.  I wish he were my little brother."  She said "I KNOW!  He is the cutest little kid ever.  I want a son just like him."  Me too.  I felt bad for neglecting the other kids a little but he was cool.  There was this one kid, no names, who was clingy and annoying all day.  I thought it was pretty cool that no matter what I did I was cool just because I was 17.  Respect is nice.  I like little kids.  They say so much random stuff all day.  I am excited about being a parent.

      Kids today (and the rare adults that act like kids) are just...off. Like my tennis coach, who is 53 going on 16, and uses phrases like, "duuuuude", "sweet man" and "whoooaa, awesome!" He shafted Evan and I today. Didn't show up to the lesson. I wasted time, gas, and money. He should seriously think about growing up, this is not the only time it has happened. Jerkmo.  Anyway about 'kids'. There is something wrong with at least half of the kids ages 5-15, then after that the percentage increases. I was walking through a store today...and this kid was walking towards me next to his mother. Now this kid was 'normal looking', about 14. And by normal I mean black sweatshirt, knee-waisted oversized pants, and in dire need of a haircut and bath (I didn't smell him from where I was, appearances can be a great indication however.) So as he and his dear mother were walking, he started to growl. Growl like a rabid pit bull. I was like, whaaat? --as I move a little faster.  He was sane, if that's what you're thinking, but yes, he was still in fact, growling. I was sketched out and tried to forget it. But then I realized I needed to go back the other way to find my mum, and as I turned around, I caught another glimpse at the nice young teenage boy. He had taken off his ratty baseball hat, wound up, and smacked his mother in the back of the head with it. Hard. And then again. I got scared and ran away. That is the kind of kid who you can share a cupcake with at lunch, then at the next meal he pulls a gun on ya.  I blame it on TV. And drugs. Well, weed and power rangers/pokemon.    Let me hear ya holla, street balla! (leave a comment, basketball player)

      I have been reading this really good blog for quite a while now and it has really got me thinking.  The name of it is  urlLink Hot Abercrombie Chick  which is funny because stereotypically it would be thought of as a dumb liberal blonde's blog, but it is a conservative college girl who is very articulate.  I love reading what she has to say.  I need to get more involved politically.  I can't vote but I can speak.  People need to here the issues.  Correctly. The media is leftist.  The public schools are biased toward liberalism.  The government is socialist.  Kids are being raised to not read.  Just watch TV and listen to what they have to say.  I mean if they made it to TV, they must be right.  Right???   If anyone else wants to get involved email me.  I am going to think of ways to get out there.  Make the issue known.  Intelligently.  Too often, conservatives just go out and get made to look like idiots by people who confuse themselves.  *Speaks out*

      No one "won" or "lost".  That makes some feel less important than others.  Anyways also I was right on some points and and my co-bloggstress was right on others.  We will not argue about who was right about which points.  Just know that I love my Deep Dish.  Have a good night.  Don't break another bed.  That was embarrassing last time you did it.  I felt your fall at my house.  Sleep in.  Catch up on what you missed.  I was truly frightened this morning.  Much love...

YOU DO NOT OWN MCDONALD'S!!! 5. I don't care that you can beat me up.  Actually it is attractive. 6. I can't believe you don't know what Crispy Creme is. We are SO taking a road trip. 7. Did you go back and change what you wrote? 8. Really, it isn't?  *is stunned*  OWW GET AWAY FROM ME WITH THE TASER!!!  ~am I allowed to eat the pizza?

Don't put false words in my mouth. 4. I own McDonalds. 5. Get over the fact that I could beat you up. 6. What is this Crispy Cream? I do not lie. 7. I SAID IN THAT PARTICULAR SENTENCE. Next time, try reading. 8. YOUR WEIGHT ISNT ON YOUR LICENSE.   -lock yourself in a room with a pizza. dont come out. ever.

      Rebuttal- 1. Since when did I say you drank only rum, idiot.  I mentioned both rum and the bubbly.  I do not recall implicitly stating  rum is synonymous with bubbly . 2. You are always drunk.  You have gotten used to it. 3. I vividly recall you saying "I love Walmart".  "It is an awesome store."blah blah blah 4. McDonald's does not deliver and last time I checked your name was not Jim Cantalupo. 5. You still beat men. 6.  LIAR!!  I know you have a Crispy Creme every minute on the minute. 7.  All as a noun- He gave his all.  as a pronoun- You are all I need.  as an adjective-   All the windows are open  as an adverb- a room painted all white  8. You lied about your weight on your license.  So how can anything else you say be trusted?  BTW I did not speak, I typed. Much love.

      Let me throw you back into reality.   1. Rum is not bubbly. Idiot. 2. If I were drunk at the time of my post: muy tipong woiulf l0oke lifae thids 3. I do not frequent 'Wal-Mart'.  4. As I have previously stated, I own McDonald's. They come to me. 5. I do not have a husband to beat on. 6. I have never been to Crispy Cream. 7. The "all" in the sentence, "The boys are all tired." is an ADJECTIVE. Sit down, I am right. And good luck on your SAT's.  8. My statements are verifiable, yours are ridiculous.   -Just don't speak anymore Dustin, you're embarrassing yourself.

      Sorry Fred.  I didn't mean to misquote you but I have just recieved info that it is actually, "Der Wille Zur Macht".

      Not to throw mud or lower myself to my un-named co-blogger's standard BUT I ask you "Can you really believe this girl?"  For instance, DID YOU KNOW that this young lady starts out the day with rum.  Jcarlos287: breakin'out the bubbly triquetta16: i wanted to talk to your parents tonite about the way you dress but apparently you all are skipping church to get drunk Jcarlos287: alright patty...i need to go get drunk now triquetta16: just dont drive home like that Jcarlos287: we have a designated driver patty Jcarlos287: and some people find my fat hanging over my pants attractive Jcarlos287: so whatever  Can you really trust a girl like this?  How do you know she wasn't drunk when she wrote her post?  Also on the obeisity issue, drop a pant size or ten before you try to talk about my fat.  Seriously,  if you have never met "her", I would encourage you not too.  If you would like to see "her" go to Wal-mart.  She will be in the Plus size section(Large sizes  for girls who need to drop a few)...or McDonald's.  It is not a sight you will forget.  She also is a husband batterer.  She can become extremely violent if you try to take her Crispy Creme.  She denies this of course.  The first step in the healing process is admitting you have a problem.  Also "unnamed girl", all is a noun, pronoun, adjective and adverb.  Leave comments about your feelings toward my co-blogstress.

      Readers:  Should we be worried? My co-blogger (and I won't mention any names for privacy sake) is starting to develope early stages of domestic violence/condecending attitude/uncoltrolled temper/feirce rage without instigation/adult male immaturity. On top of that, he eats too much. Example:  Jcarlos287: why do you threaten me so? triquetta16: i dont recall threating triquetta16: i recollect an imperative command  and later...  triquetta16: i want something to read Jcarlos287: grab one of those ten pound books you love triquetta16: *grabs book* triquetta16: *throws at jenna* triquetta16: *walks away*   Can we help him? Or is it too late... We need massive amounts of time to change his entire personality and put him on a diet. Is this even possible though...I dunno. He loves his PIE. This is too much for me to deal with right now...please help. **leaves**

      Sidetrack:  I like being able to blog from anywhere.  It is wicked convenient.  I have found a spectator sport I enjoy spectating!! X-games.  I love the skateborders, and bicyclists.  I think the stuff they can do is crazy cool.  It is so much cooler than shooting a ball in a basket.  I mean throwing your skateboard and jumping and flipping and landing on it requires crazy skill.  I am definitely going to Germany to watch the German version of the Xgames-Circle of Balance.  It is crazy how good these kids are.

      Well I really have some interesting acquaintances.  As I was talking to one, he suggested that monogamy is a marriage ruiner.  WOAH!  Stop the conversation.  I was like WHAT??  Apparently, men were just not made for one spouse and causing them to be with only one woman is going to cause psychological problems and will cause a rift in the marriage because the man's needs are not being met.  HOLD UP!  I said so You think we should not get married and just sleep with whoever.  He said No no no.  There are certain benefits to getting married but a man needs a woman on the side.  I said So you advocate for polygamy?  Him-No.  A man needs one steady woman and a woman on the side with whom he has no emotional attachment that changes on a regular basis.  Me-SAY WHAT!  So you think there is just this pool of women floating out there that don't want to get married?  They just enjoy being tossed from man to man.  Him-No.  You are totally distorting what I am saying.  They don't have to be unmarried.  They could have a husband and a boyfriend too.  Me- So you wouldn't mind if your wife cheated on you?  Him-Um...err...I guess not.  Me-YOU GUESS NOT!!!  You were not even thinking about the emotional side of a relationship are you?  YOUR PLAN DOES NOT WORK.  IDIOT!(I didn't say idiot.  It isn't generally a debate winner.)  Him-Well a man being constricted to one woman doesn't work.  It causes resentment toward your spouse.  Me-How?  What did she do?  Him-Well not being able to  express [emphasis mine] yourself causes emotional blockage.  Me-What the heck is emotional blockage?  Him-Well being with only one woman causes emotional blockage.  So a man needs--Me(cuts him off)-I did not ask for the cause.  I asked for a definition.  Stop repeating yourself.  Get back to me when your views are better defined.(end conversation)  GRR!!!  I hate idiots.  They are just so prevalent.  And they have no idea what they are saying.  Just dumb excuses for acting on base impulses.

      Wow.  ACT is about 100 times easier than SAT.  It all depends on POV I guess.  Some people I tested with did not think the time limit on the ACT was long enough.  It was short and I did take most of the time in each section but the questions were much easier.  The SAT is very wordy and also very biased.  Also, on the SAT, I always had the tendency to answer the question from a conservative POV but the I realized the author is liberal and went with the liberal interpretation of a passage.  ACT had very little bias in my opinion(or at least a conservative one) and it was a lot more in the language of the common people.  I mean here and there a question would try to trip me up but if I read the question it wasn't that hard.  Math was a bit different.  I forgot a calculator so I had to do all the work the long way so I just guessed on the last ten when I only had a minute left.  I definitely "spanked the ACT" though.  I can't wait to get my score.

      Dustin, here is the lengthy blog you wanted. So deal with it, you asked.  Sooo boreded. Someone needs to come over my house and play with me. I had some friends, once, but they cancelled. NOTE: This is not in any way appreciated. When you make plans to do something with a stinkin' person, do it. Otherwise, don't commit kids- just say no.  And   how   do people not know what Plinko is? What is this madness? Its PLINKO. Every good American citizen should know this. yes, they should. It is a ridiculous, stupid, awesome game. I *heart* plinko.   I seriously have nothing to do, **eats a spoonful of frosting**  and we have no food in our house. It is sad. People come over and offer us food stamps. Well I mean they would...if they came over...instead if canceling...and no, I am not bitter.  Ok so I was just told that I "jive." Umm..what? I have absolutly no clue what that means, or how I do it. So if ya know, give me a holla in the comments, yo.  By the way, when I am bored I am not funny. You do the math.

      I can barely breathe. I've lost my will.  This morning school was canceled because of flooding.  I thought Alright.  Then I went back to bed.  At 10:30 Miss Schnakenberg called.  She wanted me to come do banquet stuff.  I just decided to go with the flow.  I definitely could have used my day off for better things(ACT, homeschool, research paper...) but whatever.  I went and had a pretty non-OK day.  I started out with feelingsof general apathy but that progressed to emptiness.  I really am sick of the faade.  I don't care about the banquet.  I don't really care about the school.  Its not like I have any friends at school.  I don't hang out with anyone from school.  I just go.  Everyone in my class wants me to go to the banquet.  Why?  Why should I go?  I don't care.  I really wish I went to public school.  The moral atmosphere is just the same.  Sure maybe some actions are subdued but a worldly attitude is still at the core of my school's heart.  They may not have sex in the closets at school but but if these same kids went to public they would not be any different than anyone else.  If my whole class went to public school there is not one person in my current class I would talk to.  I am pretty sure the feeling is the same.  I don't really care.  I am almost out.

      I went shopping.  For food.  It was fun.  I bought alot.  Actually, I wandered around the produce section for a while looking at the variations of vegetables.  I had no idea.  I just walked around looking dumb wondering "What am I going to do?"  Then Miss Vasel showed up.  What a blessing.  She helped me pick out onions and peppers and salad mix.  Then we went shopping for other stuff.  We picked the prettiest boxes and bottles.  It is the only way to shop.  Fortunately, the good stuff was the cheap stuff.  I saved $13.00 with my Shaw's card.  That was exciting.  I pretty much emptied out every section I went to.  There is no more chicken, pineapple, or oriental salad mix.  So you should wait until tommorrow morning to go to Shaw's.

      I am buying two computers soon.  Well, one by the end of the summer and then one by next summer.  One is an 1.25Ghz PowerPC G4 eMac with 1 GB of 1GB SDRAM DDR333, a 17" CRT screen with a Superdrive(DVD-R/CD-RW), 80 GB ultra ATA hard drive, and an Airport Extreme card.  Then next summer, for college, I am getting a 14" iBook.  Sooo excited.  Nerdy too.  But whatever.  C'est la vie.

      triquetta16: Memorial Day is a celebration of murderers who were brainwashed to think that their cause was worth killing other people over triquetta16: so I will not be watching any parades or planting any flags triquetta16: and then the people are brainwashed into thinking these people are heroes triquetta16: jumping on a grenade to save people is heroic, killing people to promote capitalism and democracy is not Jcarlos287: you are against all war? triquetta16: unless Jesus Christ comes down and says go to war against this country then yes I am against war Jcarlos287: so, back in the day when the israelites fought....that was wrong? triquetta16: we made be blessed but America is not God's chosen nation and God has not told us that it was our purpose to go into other countries and kill them to promote freedom triquetta16: no.  israel was told directly by God, do this, exactly this way Jcarlos287: uh huh triquetta16: Israel was fulfilling God's command to get rid of filthy sinful nations triquetta16: we are just killing people who might be a threat to our defense Jcarlos287: question: If you walked in your house and someone was attacking someone you loved and the only way to stop them was killing them, what would you do? triquetta16: and then in retrospect we say "oh look how we helped all those civilians" but at the expense of hundreds of thousands of lives triquetta16: i would not kill them Jcarlos287: liar triquetta16: i would not Jcarlos287: remind me never ever to chill with you in a bad neighborhood triquetta16: i would get in there way and try to stop them...but someone loves that person too and who am i to kill him over my loved one triquetta16: God loves them both equally Jcarlos287: like i said, make sure your wife and family know that triquetta16: taser, and tranq. gun would stop him just as efficiently as butcher knife or real gun triquetta16: without killing him Jcarlos287: oh because everyone had a tazor or a tranq. gun on hand triquetta16: well intead of buying one that uses bullets by one that uses tranq. darts Jcarlos287: pretend you are in a situation where it was either the attacker that dieds, or your loved one triquetta16: it is not like tazers are that expensive either triquetta16: i am not God triquetta16: i refuse to play God Jcarlos287: i refuse to watch while someone attacks my child triquetta16: however if my loved one was saved I would chose the attacker because chances are if I killed him, I would be sending him to hell Jcarlos287: Guess what? God put you in control of your childs life, to protect it no matter what triquetta16: not something i want to spend the rest of my life thinking about triquetta16: (forcefully sending someone to hell) triquetta16: what do you think about that triquetta16: would you choose a saved loved one or an unsaved attacker? Jcarlos287: i would protect the thing God had entrusted me to triquetta16: and send someone to hell to save the physical body of someone who would be going to Jesus' side Jcarlos287: number one: who is to say my child is saved? Number two: who is to say this attacker will be saved? triquetta16: this is all ethical debate. triquetta16: i don't believe in ethics.  i believe in morals. triquetta16: Thou shalt not kill triquetta16: one of my moral rules...given to me by God triquetta16: i do not feel the need to argue situational ethics since i am a moral absolutist.  i had thought you were too Jcarlos287: ethic    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (thk) n. A set of principles of right conduct.  A theory or a system of moral values Jcarlos287: the two are practically synonymous triquetta16: Situational ethics refers to a particular view of ethics, in which absolute standards are considered less important than the requirements of a particular situation. triquetta16: The standards used may, therefore, vary from one situation to another, and may even contradict one another. This view of ethics is similar to moral relativism, and is contradictory to moral universalism, and moral absolutism.  triquetta16: Moral absolutismthe belief or theory that there are absolute standards against which moral questions can be judgedsuggests that morals are not determined by societal or situational influences.  triquetta16: not one of the ten commandments has an instance when breaking it is acceptable Jcarlos287: do you believe in capital punishment? triquetta16: the two are polar opposites triquetta16: if God smites a person for murder then yes.  however, the executioner is just as guilty of murder as the condemned Jcarlos287: eye for an eye Jcarlos287: i believe that is in the Bible Jcarlos287: no? Jcarlos287: God smites the person with an executioner triquetta16: Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:   But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.   triquetta16: direct quote from jesus triquetta16: Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.   But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;  That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.  triquetta16: resist not evil.  do not kill someone trying to kill you.  do not cower.  but do not kill Jcarlos287: what if in the act of "not cowering" you killed the attacker? triquetta16: i mean by "do not cower" stand firm, tall and fearless.  show them you have nothing to fear in death but that you are unwilling to kill Jcarlos287: you can do that in less then 10 seconds? what are you going to do? make a speech? triquetta16: no.  posture resistance and the look in a person's eyes can say alot about fear Jcarlos287: there is a man attacking your wife. he is 6'5 and jacked. you are in an ally. you think youre gonna stop him? triquetta16: sending someone to hell is irreversible, by not killing them i am simply giving God the chance to lead them to him triquetta16: no. i hope she would stand firm with me and we would die together Jcarlos287: did you know God gives up on people? he gives them over to their wickedness and no longer tries to reach them triquetta16: FYI, Ted Bundy, serial-rapist/murderer is now saved and in heaven Jcarlos287: good for teddy triquetta16: he raped tortured and killed almost a hundred women.  he was caught.  Jesus did not give up on him.  One of the victim's families kept witnessig to him and he was savef triquetta16: saved* Jcarlos287: give up was a wrong term Jcarlos287: but still triquetta16: still after all that man did he got saved triquetta16: God loves all his creation Jcarlos287: good Jcarlos287: "it repenteth me that i have made them" triquetta16: which is a greater witness killing someone or letting them kill you Jcarlos287: you cant say that without saying the other triquetta16: do we go to the same church? Jcarlos287: yes triquetta16: i believe all the verses you are using for crime and punishment are old covenant.  we are learning in church that the new covenant is SO much better.  all the verses i have used are new covenant Jcarlos287: i used two verses Jcarlos287: one was old covenent true triquetta16: old covenant verses Jcarlos287: does the other still stand true? triquetta16: both were Jcarlos287: I KNOW triquetta16: neither do Jcarlos287: but latter still applies triquetta16: that murderer is just as wicked as i, except one thing i have jesus Jcarlos287: i agree Jcarlos287: bottom line: i would lay down my life to save my friends. that is Biblical. I would die to save them, but I would not have them die, that is not their choice Jcarlos287: i told you i agree with that Jcarlos287: and i would protect that which God have given me stewardship over triquetta16: it is my choice not to kill.  it is their choice to murder.  if my friend wants to murder to protect themselves so be it triquetta16: i refuse Jcarlos287: i am saying there is a line between murder and defence triquetta16: nope triquetta16: thou shalt not kill.  PERIOD triquetta16: statement ends there Jcarlos287: i will have to get back to you on that triquetta16:i think generally most people are so egocentric that they would kill the one the aggressor triquetta16: i still feel very strongly about my beliefs Jcarlos287: as i do triquetta16: also think what a testimony cassie bernal was at columbine triquetta16: she didnt lunge at the kid with the gun.  she took the bullets.  she stood tall and unwavering. Jcarlos287: i would like you to realize that that is completely irrelevant triquetta16: i also feel the new testament completely backs up my view triquetta16: one NT verse about it being alright to kill the agressor is all i need triquetta16: it is not irrelevant Jcarlos287: YES it is triquetta16: why do you think so? Jcarlos287: because Jcarlos287: he wsnt attacking her friends Jcarlos287: hah Jcarlos287: as i recal he pointed the gun AT HER Jcarlos287: we discussed this already triquetta16: you really cant think of anything good can you. Jcarlos287: i would die in that case too Jcarlos287: DO YOU REMEMBER THE STORY triquetta16: killing to save a friend is no more noble then killing to save yourself Jcarlos287: he didnt give her a chance to answer before he shot her triquetta16: yes he did triquetta16: she said "Yes. I believe." Jcarlos287: do you get my point? triquetta16:  i have to leave though so we can debate later...btw find a NT verse that says defending yourself is ok and murdering to protect a loved one is acceptable triquetta16: no you have no point Jcarlos287: bye

      To the fat sloth of a worthless piece of flesh and a waste of oxygen sitting in front of the computer(AKA-Pat):  Some people seem to think is kosher to deny that they are wrong repeatedly after I have shown them what is correct.  urlLink Swallow your pride Patty.   Other then that, I do not appreciate you stealing my cool stuff from my posts on my blog. It shows little to no originality on your part. Perhaps I would be fine with it if you credited myself with bringing it to your attention. But you have not. What a shock.  Not directed to you>> I feel the need to vent majorly: I am really really sick of someone and I can wait till they take off and hopefully grow up. If I hear them complain or whine or falsely accuse me of one more thing I might drive a spike through their forehead.   Have a nice day.

      Any more comments about Patty's use of grammar/choice of spelling will be deleted.  If I am not feeling lazy.  So anyways, tennis is cool.  I want to learn how to play(well) because tonight was wicked fun.  Then I spent forever looking for shorts, but I couldn't find any I cared for.  I did buy three new shirts though.  Not anything I need.  I have no idea where to put all my t-shirts.  I never have enough dress pants/shirts but that is just because I can never find ones I like...or they are $90.  Shorts either.  Well, in seasons past I have never had trouble finding shorts but this year I just don't like the styles.  I would just wear pants all the time but that can get hot and they don't allow for great range of motion for tennis which I now love and need to learn how to play well.  Volleying is definitely my thing although returning looks like it could be fun.  I.  Heart.  Tennis.

      I am tired.  I need shorts for summer.  Luckily, I got a job and am now "rolling in the dough".  Seriously, my job pays wicked well.  In other news, I am excited about next school year.  ALOT!  I will miss a few people.  Miss Warren looked like she was going to cry when I left.  I love Miss Warren.  She is like a second mom to me.  She would be a crazy awesome mother.  She doesn't have any kids though so that stinks because I know she really wants one.  C'est la vie.  Comment.  now.

       urlLink    This was a healthy human baby before it was torturously murdered inside its mother.  I have no idea how any normal human being could perform such a "procedure" repeatedly.  It is absolutely sickening.  These women who talk about their "rights" disgust me.  That baby's face looks cute even though it was horribly multilated.  Some selfish woman had her beautiful child killed so she could lead an uninhibited lifestyle.  I am outraged.

      I LOVE THE RAIN!  Oh my word.  You have no idea.  Seriously...we need to go walking sometime(I don't jog...).  Everyone thinks I am wierd, but I love just going outside when it is raining and just sitting and let it pour down on me.  Or to go for a walk and jump in all the puddles and just enjoy God's creation.  well anyways...one of my teachers stopped over.  she is nice.  so anyways...i am making a technology proposal for an organization...I wonder if a minor can be a technology officer in an organization.  well anyways...

      Humm...so here is my thought: Anyone who comes up to you and says, "Let's go to Ozzfest." should be shot. But umm..not much is up. Seeing as I cannot use AIM, and it is indeed raining, I have very little to do. Well actually I could read or something, but let's be serious. I really want to go play in the rain. No one likes to though. I have no one to go jump in puddles with me. I remember when I was little, I dragged my brother and sister out in the rain with me and we jumped in puddles and got totally soaked. Apparently my mum didn't appreciate that much, because when we got inside I got a spankin'. Other then the pain at the very end it was a good time. I would do it again. It's no fun alone though. A few weeks back I went for a nice 3 mile run in the pouring rain. Best run of my life. I love the rain. What can I say? I like being crazy and stupid and fun sometimes; just let it go, run in the rain, forget everything. Someday I'll teach someone to smell the rain, to smell the seasons. Have you ever smelt the rain? You haven't live till you have. Someday that someone will remind me to slow down and remember to smell the seasons or stand in the rain for a moment, stopping time. Someday. Until then, I am sitting here writing because people seem to enjoy the idiot box so much it renders them useless.   The best things in life are free. It's the simple things people miss everyday that make me happy.

      No one cares about anything good or godly...or so it seems to me.  I just wish someone would say "Let's go witnessing" or something...instead of "Let's go to Ozzfest" or something.  so anyways...what's up jenna?

      "I try to carefully weigh the message against the objectionable content. Even if the movie has a good message, I won't watch it if there's too much swearing or dirty language, gratuitous violence, or any sex whatsoever. You have to decide where the line falls for you. "  1.I try carefully to weigh the message against the objectionable content.  Christianity teaches that salvation is by faith not by works.  God does not measure our good works against our bad works on a scale.  One sin tarnishes every good thing we could do and it damns us.  A little leaven leavens the whole lump.  Christians today, however, do not apply this spiritual truth.  As a whole, we try to justify what we watch by seeing if the overall message is good.  One curse, one act of violence, one bit of nudity or sexual innuendo is enough to damn a film.   Any of the films good works are nullified by any sin in the film.  Our holy God will not allow sin into his presence because it would tarnish His glory.  We should not willingly set sin before our eyes and ears.  Movies have a way of putting sin in a good light.  Homosexuality, murder, pre-marital sex, extra-marital sex are all examples of things the movies make look good.  No consequences.  Do what feels good.   2. Even if the movie has a good message, I won't watch it if there's too much swearing or dirty language, gratuitous violence, or any sex whatsoever.  Too much swearing?  How much is too much?  In our family, it used to be one swear was too much and we changed the show.  Then it was decided that every show has one swear nowadays and so it was upped to two.  Then three.  Then four.  It is a progression.  Following the world from a distance is still following the world.  Are you, a finite human, capable of making a decision about how much sin is acceptable in ones life?  Coincidentally, God says in the Bible we are not to allow sin in our lives.  So the call isnt actually up to us.  Gratuitous violence.  HmmmWhat is gratuitous violence?  Well Gratuitous violence is violence that is unnecessary or that does not portray wartime violence or violence that actually occurred (Jesus crucifixion) OkPeople have sex all the time.  Is that acceptable?  Can I watch a portrayal of a married couple having sex?  OF COURSE NOT!  It dulls your mind and exposes you to things you should not be exposed to.  The same with violence.  It has been proven by studies that people who watch movies portraying ANY type of violence or listening to music with violent lyrics are more likely to commit violent crimes.   3. You have to decide where the line falls for you. "  This implies that there are no absolute standards.  You can decide for yourself what is acceptable.  There is no absolute moral standard regarding movies.  If we say that we can decide what is acceptable, we are taking God out of the picture.      It is doubtful anyone has taken the time to read this entire article.  If someone did, it is unlikely they will change.  Most Christians today could be (and are) slapped in the face with Gods truth and would not do anything different just because they enjoy their sin.  Cest la vie.  I will pray that anyone who reads this might be positively affected.

      I am so messed up.  And confused.  About myself.  Someone once said "We barely knew each other, we didn't know ourselves."  So true.  I have no idea why I am this way.  I often wonder "Why does [insert name] think that way?"  New question.  Why do I think this way.  Not necessarily "Why do I think about that particular thing?" but rather "Why do my thought processes occur this way rather than another way?"  I wish I could control how and what I thought about.

      The term "gentleman", in the true meaning of the word, has nothing to do with manners.  It has to do with being of the "gentry", or noble birth.  The term was twisted to mean the manners which were expected of nobility.  Technically, a gentleman is someone of high birth not good manners so no mattter how well-mannered I am, I can never be a gentleman.  A gentleman can actually be one of the worst mannered people ever.  Such is true with "sportsmanship" also.  Sportmanship is not a list of noble qualities in an athlete but rather the way athletes act.  The way athletes act is going downhill.  i.e. Intramurals.  Shoethrowing, water bottle throwing/smashing, throwing/kicking the ball across the field would all be considered poor qualities in a losing sportsman or even a sportsman who may be winning but does not agree with a referee's call.  The "must win" attitude can be frustrating too.  I paid $25 to play in every game, not to be able to say "My team won every game".  Also, if you have the minumum amount of required players, then you should not be able to draft from other teams for an extra player.  Especially when someone from your team is the one who spends the majority of the time sitting out and that person from the other team plays in your game and then their own teams.  Retarded.

      I really do think Google is doing a  urlLink good thing . I mean sure you can have your little right to disagree with him and whatnot...but making shirts and memorabilia that mock his speech and looks is just kind of immature. Go ahead, dislike him and the way he leads and the decisions he's made...but lets all be adults here. Google is trying to take us as Americans slightly out of elementary school and I respect that.   On another not so pleasant note, I despise someone. They actually make me sick, but they are in my heart and prayers at the same time. Apparently this person thinks I will get a kick out of them mocking every aspect of my life. ie. my house, faith, friends, opinions, politics, and even my own future. Seriously, they think I'll find it funny. Thankfully God has held my tongue on many occasions. Otherwise I would forcefully verbally crush them into crud. This person went from being a life long friend to...I can't even describe it. It hurts though. Good friends are really, really hard to come by. I hope that anyone who is willing to be a decent friend to me will find that I will stick with them til the end. In this case though, I've been tossed aside, thrown into a stereotype, and then not even considered. They bring me down. I'll be there if they ever need me, and I'll let them know that, but for now...  Time to sever a friendship.

      People demand freedom of speech as a compensation for the freedom of thought which they seldom use.  Everyone one wants to be able to "speak their mind" or "express themselves without fear of reprisal".  No ones thoughts are orignal.  People are just shallow mouthpieces as saying the same thing in different ways.  No one thinks of new ideas.  They just say what the "cool kids" say.  I should note that "cool kids" does not mean I am referring to teen in this post ANYWHERE.  This is about the global populus as a whole.  Everyone goes with the flow.  Even the "anti-flow" or those who "rage against the machine" are just another cog in the machine blindly stumbling down the highway to hell.  The truth is that individualism is a myth.  Someone somewhere does things just like you.  The more people there are, the less unique any one person is.  You may be a deviation from my system of belief but you are not original or alone in doing so.  Don't fool your self.  The belief in free will does not allude to original thought.  Have a nice day. Sincerely, Your fellow puppet

      Ugh...I have to work at Staples today @ 10.  At least it is not that early.  It still bites though because I have been there long enough for the whole "Yay! This is fun" feeling to wear off but not long enough to subconciously associate myself with Staples.  In other news, due to circumstances out of my control(an authority over me has done something) I am totally out of the Lord's will.  Sorta.  I know that I am to obey authority "in the Lord" but I do not think they made the right choice and I really cant do anything without the authority's help.  So I am stuck, feeling awful about not being where I am supposed to be, praying the authority will see what I am saying, and trying to make the best of what I have right now.  So if you wanted to pray for me I would appreciate it.  In other news, this is the closest I have ever been to turning in a research paper...I finished it at 5:00 yesterday...It was due at 12:30...c'est la vie.  at least I am working the time down.  In 6th grade, I turned one in three months late. My parents wouldnt even let me open Christmas presents until like February.  It was a time.  Well my pizza is ready. *leaves*

      I work up at 4:30...stupid birds...Then I made something to eat and fixed my blog.  Now I am cooking macaroni and posting.  It has been a long time.  I am getting a little sick of people.  Thus, I have found lyrics(slightly modified) that fit how I feel about how everyone in my school treats each other.   I am the son And the heir Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar I am the son and heir Of nothing in particular  You shut your mouth How can you say I go about things the wrong way ? I am Human and I need to be loved Just like everybody else does  I am the son And the heir Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar I am the son and heir Oh, of nothing in particular  You shut your mouth How can you say I go about things the wrong way ? I am human and I need to be loved Just like everybody else does  There's a place, if you'd like to go You could meet somebody who really loves you So you go, and you stand on your own And you leave on your own And you go home, and you cry And you want to die  When you say it's gonna happen "now" Well, when exactly do you mean? See I've already waited too long And all my hope is gone  You shut your mouth How can you say I go about things the wrong way? I am human and I need to be loved Just like everybody else does   Also, sidenote: I am also out of this wretched school in 13.5 days.  No more listening to idiot Christians talk about Ludacris and Eminem.  "My Band" and "Milkshake" ARE NOT APPROPRIATE!!!!!!   Oy vay.  AND THE BACKSTABBING!  Oh my word.  Two faced has a new definition.  Its not like public school is any better but hey I expect it from the unsaved.  I also think they will notice a difference between me and them.  Also, there should be a lot more people in my class.  These past three years have been really different from what I am used to.  I can't take my peers shallow stupidity much longer.  14 days of peace.  That is all I want.  And my food.  *leaves*

      What a stylish new design. This, I like. I mean it screams "cool blog." Also, I am glad to see the 'Cat and Girl' comic has been left behind. :o) I never understood it anyway. Blogger has a fun new layout also. Whoo! Spring fever!  P.S. Are we putting comments back in?

      Well today has been a busy one.  I have been home all of about 30 minutes since 7:50 this morning.  Today, my dad locked himself out of his car so he had his co-worker, Tamika, drive him home.  She is totally awesome.  She is from the South.  Actually, she was raised for most of her childhood in the Chesapeke Bay area like myself.  I have talked to her a few times before but tonight we talked and she is cool.  My dad gave her a tour of the house and she was all compliments.  I felt wicked ungrateful as she went through my house. "Three bedrooms!"  "Two computers"  "THREE FLOORS!!!"  "A LAUNDRY CHUTE!!!THAT'S SO COOL!!"  "You have your own computer!?!  I love this desk!!!"  She was so nice...and she is wicked funny too.  What a blast.  Then at church tonight a "guy" was saw my phone on belt and was like "Oooh.  An LG picture phone.  How much did you pay for that?"  So I told him.  He got out his LG phone and said "Guess how much?"  I said "Free?"  He smugly replied "Yep.  It works great too.  Its not like I need a color phone."  It irritated me.  I do not try to be showy or ostentatious.  I never try to thrust what I have in other people's faces.  I actually try to hide or downplay what I have.  I enjoy what I have and I am blessed but I do not try to show it off.  I have a cell phone.  I don't have a purse.  I wear it on my belt.  I worked hard for my phone.  I am not to trying to flash around what I have...but I have it.  And I don't like people who are...ergh!? what's that word...grr..."stupid will have to do...I don't like people who are stupid and get upset because I have nice things or I have more than they had when they were 17.  I worked at McDonald's for 2 years and now I work at Staples.  It isn't like I was handed nice clothes or my car or my phone or my computer.  I worked hard and I got em.  I don't try to flaunt but I shouldn't have to hide what I have so other people don't get upset.  Why can't people be like Tamika and be happy for me instead of like "him."  Well, I need to go  Write my paper   Read and revise the UN charter   Read Hamlet   Finish organizing  Affinity    Write a mission statement for my charity   Think of a wicked good name for it   Find someone to put the graphic in my head on paper   Find support for the charity   Do lots of other cool stuff  *toodles*

      I like making references to literature or music in my blog, especially when it is an obscure work of art.  I dunno...It makes me feel...cool...intelligent.  I still haven't thought of a title for this post.  Hopefully, it is a good one.  No one has commented since Jenna and PP left.  Come back...I need readers...I also need my first paycheck...it is as good as spent...so anyways...i stole a copy of hamlet today...i think i will go read it...i hear it is a good read.

      I am going to put two songs on here.  Comment on which you think is "Christian."   Song #1  I'm not a perfect person There's many things I wish I didn't do But I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I'm sorry that I hurt you It's something I must live with everyday And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears Thats why i need you to hear  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is You [x4]  I'm not a perfect person I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I've found a reason to show A side of me you didn't know A reason for all that I do And the reason is you    Song #2  All of you is more than enough for all of me For every thirst and every need You satisfy me with your love And all I have in you is more than enough  You are my supply My breath of life And still more awesome than I know You are my reward worth living for And still more awesome than I know  All of you is more than enough for all of me For every thirst and every need You satisfy me with your love And all I have in you is more than enough  Youre my sacrifice  Of greatest price  And still more awesome than I know  You are everything And still more awesome than I know   More than all I want More than all I need You are more than enough for me More than all I know More than all I can say You are more than enough for me    A girl in my class had the audacity to ask my teacher to play the "un-Christian" song.  I was shocked.  Hello, I go to a Christian school.  One would think if a kid was listening to the wrong music they wouldn't ask the teacher to listen to it in class.  I was bored so I looked up the lyrics to the song and then I put up the lyrics to it and to a song the teacher considers "Christian" because I thought the lack of difference was funny.  No one on the street who heard both songs would ever tell the difference.  No wonder the kids in my school listen to secular music.  Even they don't see the big difference.  There isn't one.

      The Bill of "Rights" can bite me.  That's right.  We have no rights.  If God blesses our nation with freedom, then so be it.  However, I do not advocate going around killing people to obtain what I believe to better for me or even my country or even the world.  Also in response to a statement from my co-blogstress, "We do not need persecution.  We need revival."  Persecution leads to revival.  It strengthens our faith.  It revives our spirit.  Feel free to write back.

      Questions to my co-blogger and anyone else that feels like adding their 2.5 cents. I love hay-pennies. Why do they no longer exist? Back to my little point...  You are against war. "Thou shalt not murder." -What exactly does this statement entail?  All  war? Let me ask you a simple question. Will God command one to sin? Now let me answer. No, He will not. He cannot tempt any man with sin. So then, when God commanded the Israelites to attack various and numerous peoples, was it sin?  Was it murder? I understand those were different times/circumstances. War is war. So if you mean all war then we should talk. Perhaps that is something to think about.  I'd rather not discuss the current war too much. Makes me sick you see.  You also have an interesting outlook on persecution. -My thoughts. We don't need rights. We don't deserve rights, or freedoms of any sort. What we do deserve is death. However, Christ died to free us. Free us from sin, yes. But He also died to give us a life so that we might live for him. You claim the church flourishes under persecution. I agree. Christ is worth every bit of torture imagined and more. You say you do not desire freedoms. But freedoms are what we in America take for granted, because we have known nothing else. None of us understand what it means to be truly persecuted. Until we have been stripped of everything we have it isn't fair to those that are persecuted to say that we want what they have. In reality no one wants to be tortured. It is not on anyone's to-do list. Kids do not say, "I want to be tortured when I grow up." It is horribly sad that the Church grows more under communism and whatever else then it does when it is given freedom. America and every other religiously free country is a pit of lazy lukewarm Christians who eat their meals and forget to pray for the persecuted, forget to witness to their neighbor, and who do not attend church except for when it is convenient. Their Bible collects dust while over in China, each single page is treasured and books are collected after months. But do you recall the Pilgrims? What was their reason for starting up this fine country? Oh yeah, I do believe it was for freedom of religion. They were being persecuted. They did not like it. They moved. God was with them, and established America. Freedom of religion.  Also, I draw your attention to the Great awakening. Thousands were saved. Why? They were not being persecuted and were allowed to practice. Try that with the commies.  We do not need persecution. We need revival.  Sending missionaries is also a feat when they are not allowed into countries. Sending them requires freedoms. You do not need freedom to serve Christ, but God has set up these freedoms for the furtherance of His Word.   Again, all we deserve is death. Nothing is needed to serve the one who died in our place.    Freedom is a blessing.

      Wow.  Some people think it is wierd I have my life planned out fairly well.  Well I have a plan and whether it happens or not is totally not in my hands.  I actually know a young girl who has her life planned out to a much greater extent and she has for quite some time apparently. I just have a list of qualities I am looking for in a wife, a general idea of what I want to do for a career, the names, gender and birth order of my 4 children.  Actually I have three of the names picked out(the boys') and a name suggestion for a daughter but I will leave that one up to my wife.  My only real desire is that it stay with the Gaelic theme I have.  Woohoo!  I love my heritage.  Well I mean the nations I am from, not necessarily my individual ancestors.  Anyways, if you see any honest Baptist girls who love the Lord and have vampire fangs, give me a ring.  Or tell them to go to BJU.  All in all, the moral of the story is "It is not bad to have a plan."  Don't procrastinate.  Illegal narcotics are bad.  Buckle up.

      Someone who should know be better but doesn't because he is a retard said something extremely irritating.  "I don't know why you don't want to go to a ball game."  Umm...you have known me for a very long time.  I have NEVER ever enjoyed watching soccer, hockey, basketball, baseball, football, and pretty much any other mainstream sport.  Unless someone I know and like is playing I do not enjoy watching sports.  I enjoy watching people I can identify with.  I don't identify with those sports.  If you want to take me to a classical symphony, awesome.  If you want to take me to an art gallery, great.  I even like watching extreme sports.  For some reason I identify with those athletes more than other athletes.  I love skateboarding, BMX biking, surfing, snowboarding, sky diving, etc.  People are always telling me I want to grow up to fast.  I like being young, I just want people I identify with.  Generally, they are older than me.  The age gap between me and "them" is lessening.  Hopefully, I don't die of boredom before I get there.

      Legion  Enveloped in a sentiment, a sound that rushes over me. Engage an impulse to pretend I have a faith as pure. Not forgetting what it means to dream. Indulging everything. Entertaining thoughts that I've the strength of those I yearn to be. Cheers and tribute greet the saviours. Reckless thoughts survive. Anachronistic and impulsive.  And what will happen? Will I dream? I am too scared to close my eyes. For a second please hold me. None can change in me these things that I believe. But I don't know what happens now. I am too scared to close my eyes.

      Julie, its official.  I have decided to judge you and at the same (also  first) time, I will know personally attack you.  You are an idiot.  Wow.  I stand in awe of how dumb you are.  That was THE SINGLE MOST IDIOTIC THING I have ever heard(Maybe I exaggerate a little...but not much.)  I know(actually hope) it wasn't your attention span that caused you to miss this but in the ohh...SECOND LINE I apologized to Seth.  I can handle the fact I upset people.  I am at peace with that.  Everyone upsets someone at some time.  You have to learn that you can't please everyone.  You are the upset one.  It is your problem to deal with not mine.  When did I blame?  There is a word for you...If I could spell it I would use it.  nuch schlepp!(Thanks grams.)

      If your name is not Seth, Julie, or Jenna, it is unnessecary for you to read this post.  Right off the bat, I apologize for saying you are anti-Semetic, Seth. Secondly, it would not hurt one of you to start reading entire sentences or paragraphs.  I, at the top of a comment, direct it to a certain person, and you respond to me as if I said it to someone else.   Instance #1 of misinterpretation "Dustin- I took offense to the comment you made to Julie regarding her heritage. Not only was it sarcastic, but you called her...arrogant?"(From Jenna)  I said "I love your need to point out your heritage.  I thought I would too.  I have decided to be proud(not arrogant) of where I come from."  I did not call Julie arrogant.  I said I was not being arrogant due to the fact that "arrogant" seems to be your catchphrase for me.  Instance #2 "**cough** Back off Jules."(from Jenna)  When did I directly attack or fight with Julie?  Intance #3 "As for Dustin: It seems that you forget what you write and then refuse to back yourself up, so I'm going to try to help you out. TO START, you wrote, " I have decided to be proud(not arrogant) of where I come from." I am quite proud of my heritage, believe it or not. If you question my values on my own family history, you will want to take it back... be VERY aware of that."(from Julie)  When THE HECK have I EVER questioned your values?  You jumped into the middle of a disagreement between Seth and I and act as though I personally attacked you before I even knew you existed.  Instance #4 "You said you were holding yourself back to an extreme extent. Really, what do you have to say to someone you have never met and tried to outwit? What do you have to say to me that you are holding back so darn much? Because if you believe your balls have finally dropped, and that you have the right to say I am arrogant about my past, just try telling me what your holding back."(from Julie)  LEARN TO FREAKING READ!  I did not say I was holding back about anything you said.  I was holding back on Jenna's need to jump in attack me and be very two-faced.  ALSO, I NEVER CALLED YOU ARROGANT!?!  Instance #5 "You also claimed that Seth was anti-semitic. If you look at Seth's journal under the date - 5/19/04, you said: " I do not appreciate your anti-Semitic idiocy." Either you have extreme short-term memory or you are just ignorant, because he is my best friend and we also dated for two years."(Julie)  I did not forget saying this.  I never said I didn't say it.  Sidenote:5/17... It took me forever to realize there is no 5/19...  Instance #5 "you about doing the same EXACT thing to Seth, and now you are doing it to Rosey and Annie as well. Just quit trying to be a higher authority."(Julie)  WHO IS ANNIE?  WHEN have I EVER mentioned her?  Instance #6 "you attempted to wave your little IQ around to impress me. every mannerism of yours that i have experienced is dripping with arrogance."  HOLD UP!  When have I tried to wave my IQ around.  Day 1 I acknowledged your IQ was higher than mine.  I am SO far from arrogant.  Don't talk about judging people you don't know and then call me arrogant.  It is hypocritical.  ALL THREE OF YOU misinterpret EVERYTHING I say and call me arrogant.  There are so many more...I have things to do though.(I bet that is probably  arrogant )  Anyways, Julie I have never said anything bad about you...so other than me calling Seth an anti-Semite...I have no clue what your beef is.  I would suggest you move on and forget about me as my importance is miniscule in the scheme of things.  Jenna, words cannot even express...  Seth, I would also suggest you find a way to let go of your bad feelings and lighten your load.  Also, I miss my spot on the blog.  I felt loved.  ;)  I wish things had not gone this way or this far.  You are pretty cool.  Julie, I don't know you.  At all.  I do not try to say ANYTHING about your beliefs because of that.  I would appreciate since you are older and hopefully more mature, if you could do the same.  Bottom line is I DON'T MATTER.  Stop wigging out over everything I say.  If you have a comment, I have a comment link.

      OK!  I am no longer saying the pledge in its original form.  It upsets me and I believe it to be idol worship(Pledging my allegiance to a flag) "I pledge allegiance to the United States of America and the ideals for which it was founded upon, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."  Also the Christian flag... "I pledge allegiance to Christ, my Saviour, and His kingdom, Who, through His crucifixion and ressurrection, provided life and liberty for all who believe."  Another thing that irritates me is people's obsession with proper observance and respect to A FLAG!  ...Meanwhile, the Holy Bible is under the dirty laundry...maybe.  Also, people stand for the national anthem but no one stands for Scripture reading.  Irritating...

      If I get invited to another leadership conference, I will flip.  Every one that I get, is just another fancy letter saying "You're smart.  We want you at our conference.  It is 6 days long and costs about the same as a year of tuiton at school.  We offer scholarships, but only to minorities.  Sorry, I don't know why we sent this to you.  Well, at least you can save the $50 invitation.  Oh, you can tell colleges you were invited to this conference too.  Oh, you were already accepted to college?  Nevermind."  I would love to go to one of these conferences, especially the lastest one, the Presidential Leadership Conference.  Basically, I get to choose the Republican or Democatic Presidential thing in New York or Boston, respectively, and watch and even participate a little bit.  Sadly, I do not have this kind of cash.  If you know any billionaires looking to help a poor white kid, let me know.  Seriously, let me know.
