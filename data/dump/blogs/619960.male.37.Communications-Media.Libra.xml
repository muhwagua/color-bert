      am off to toronto on friday for a week's teaching with my good friend pete ward at the anglican theological college. looking forward to sharing some stories, nuggets and worship tricks across the water. will also be catching up with some friends who first introduced me to the delights of belgian trappist beer - feels good to know that the finest beer in the world comes out of our tradition eh?!

       moving right along   Beer drinking Christians, dogs walking around, sitting around, tongues hanging out of windows eating bugs. What is all this? What are we seeing? It's not all tidy and neet and quantifyable is it. I don't even totally know what I'm saying. This is our life - going around trying to see what we can see, as clearly as possible - to hear rightly - and still not totally knowing. That's fine though.    We're finding out that we're "in process" and don't have to "be there" yet. We're being on a journey and we're finding partners to travel with. We're starting not to say  "come on in the church, this is the end of the line, we're all perfect here, and if you're not we don't really want to fool with you too much."  We are learning that a thought process like that is total crap and we're casting the crap aside. Didn't the Catholics figure out long ago that you can have a beer and be a follower of Jesus at the same time? Do they even think twice about it? Or is it just American evangelical Christians who have gotten hung up like that?    Am I rambling? Yes. The newest wave of emerging church leaders, apostolic planters, etc. are breaking those old molds. They don't (we don't) even recognize the molds any more.  "Oh, we were supposed to be poured into some freakin' mold and be like you guys - I'm sorry."  We're sorry, but we won't be poured. We won't be molded - not by that. We will get those molds, those shells out of the way so God can get His hands on us and make us into something that possibly even the "church" won't be able to fully recognize. Let's become unrecognizable - Jesus did.

       the dog story:   a dog is walking down the road.  as he walks, he notices that as he moves his feet the trees move.  "feet move, trees move; feet move, trees move" he thought to himself - he is happy, life is good.  then, after his walk, he sits down and starts to wonder over the events that just happened.  but, as he sits he notices that when his butt is down the trees stop moving. "butt down, trees not move; butt down, trees not move," he thought to himself - he is happy.  he thought to himself, "my world is complete - legs move, trees move; butt down, trees don't move."  all life came to an understanding and he was happy, and the world had meaning - all he has is defined by his walk, tree, sit, tree life style - everything is centered, he knew his purpose.  one day as the dog was sitting on his butt contemplating the world around him, his master called him for a trip to the beach - the dog had never gone to the beach, and he was excited about seeing all that he had heard about.  as he lay on the back set of the car he was happy - the world was good; his life had meaning and he was off to the beach.  as the car approached a light and stopped the dog picked up his head and looked around - all was good, the world was centered; he laid back down to sleep.  the ride was long, and as the car was driving down the freeway the dog looked out the window - and his world fell apart before him.  his butt was down, but the trees were moving - this was impossible, and against all he knew  - how could this be?  the dogs world needed to be redefined.  did you ever notice that some dogs riding in the back seat of a car just can't sit still as the car is moving?  that's because, as long as they keep moving they do not need to redefine the world around them.  modern people are dogs living a complete life, some are pacing around the back seats of cars, ignoring the change that is taking place around them - postmodern people are riding in the back of the car.  some are walking around, trying to keep their world in a logical order, like moderns - while a great many of us are riding with our faces out the windows and our tongues hanging out in the wind.  yea, it can get sloppy, and on occasion we get a bug in the mouth - but it's fun and we are loving it.   punk monkey    just a little something i felt i needed to share from your friends at http://www.ginkworld.net

      Hey Alan, you guys drink  beer ?! Is this allowed for christians? ;-)  We JesusFreaks also have good connections to Vineyard, to  urlLink Manhattan Vineyard . Mike Turrigiano, his wife Char and others often visited us last years. They are kind of spiritual parents for us. Last visit has been at Easter, at our annual leader meeting. Very nice and caring people!  At our meeting Taade (one of the guys who has been in Chile, see below) told us from these guys in Chile. He said, it's exactly the same we have in Germany - it's just another language. And it was very funny to hear of their festival, and to hear they called it Christock - similar to Freakstock. (BTW: From 1999 to 2000 we've had Froststock, a small festival, or should I better say freezetival, at the same place where Freakstock happens.) God bless these guys there! I hope some day I can meet them, see what happens there...

       Chile   Last March, a group of young leaders met by the beachside to discuss the things the Lord is doing among the youth in their nation. They looked at some of the ways people are doing church in new ways. One of the most significant developments is led by Fernando Gallegos who started a church named " urlLink Rejected and Despised ". They have planted two and are now serving a vision which seeks to reach all the subcultures of their nation.  The event was attended by people from various other nations including two guys from the  urlLink Jesus Freaks  in Germany. They were of great encouragement as they shared the ways they are making disciples.  After this event, they all had a three day party. They called it  urlLink Cristock  and it was attended by over 2,000 people.  The youth in Latin America is owning the vision to reach the emerging generations in the continent.

      A  urlLink friend  who I work with and I have been frustrated over the price of what some ministries are charging for just basic worship and media images.  We thought it would be cool just to give Lakeview's weekend and teaching stuff away so we put together all of the original and royalty free stuff that we have used (we also use comp images that we can't distribute) and post them online for free.  You can find them  urlLink here .  There is generic title slides (Lakeview logos have been taken out) and some background slides (for teaching and worship).  All are set up around a metaphor.  We know how strapped churches can be financially and I have been priviledged to work with a really talented artist so spread the word and steal the images if they are worth while.  Everything is free and we hope to add another 30-40 weeks of images a year.  If you know of any churches that are struggling in the area of media images, let them know of the site.

      Hey people - PEOPLE! PEOPLE!! I'm glad you've all come together here today to see the unveiling of such an ultra cool thing - akingdomspace. Where is akingdomspace? Everywhere! If you answered anything else, please restart the quiz and begin again. We are everywhere. We are at Search Party. We are in Lexington, Kentucky, USA - at least this part of "we" is, are, whatever.. I think this will be an amazing touchpoint for many in the world to be able to see whaas hatnin'.    I've actually never used Blogger before. My blog (there's that funky word again - is next week the due date for a new term?) ...as I was saying, my "blaaahhhg" is independent - meaning it's not "powered by blogger." It's powered my me. I'm a web designer so it was easier for me that way.     Here I am though - part of the team. I'm glad to be here. Thanks, Andrew, for asking me to be part of this thing. I'm in the ongoing process of planting a new faith community in Lexington - it's called  urlLink Vine & Branches Christian Community . Some kind of hybrid between cells and house churches - relational ministry - integrating ancient liturgical "stuff" with new freeform "stuff" - et cetera. We're a small group that meets in my home. We go to bars and coffee houses - we drink beer and coffee. We wait for God to connect us with people here.    I'm married to Liz, for 14 years next month - yeee haw! I'm 35 years old. We have 4 great kids from 12 to 6 - busy life. I also know that Kevin character down there and the folks at  urlLink Vineyard Central . God brought us together a year ago and we love these guys. We're learning from them. The way God has been connecting me with so many people around the states and world who are doing/seeing/thinking similar things is amazing. I look forward to much more of this. God's Grace be with you!

      I've spent ages trying to think of a snappy introduction, but guess I should probably just take a deep breath and go for it! I feel like I'm in very hallowed company, being allowed to sit on the table with the grown-ups overhearing their dinner conversation- so thank you for inviting me! My name is Abigail, and I'm in Sheffield, UK.  God's shaking  everything  up for me at the moment, but I'm mainly involved in a group called Home, which is one of the clusters of small groups at St Thomas Church, Crookes.  We're a group of 50 or so young adults trying to work out how to be church with integrity, in a way true to who we are, and also seeking to release the creatives.  I'm also personally interested in releasing the prophetic in the cluster, and having a safe space for us baby prophets to be free to have a go (and quite often mess up!).   There's quite a lot of exciting stuff happening here in Sheffield at the moment- feels like a fresh wave is coming imminently- and so I'll try and be brief in what I write (though that does tend to be a problem!) Anyhow, enough waffle, I'm going to sit back and listen now. Man, it's so good to be part of something! I love it! ps. if you're interested, I'm currently pulling together a website at www.cedarlily.com which contains my blogs- I'm teaching myself html so it might be a bit ropey, but feel free to have a nose round.  God bless!

      this is too cool.  i love the idea, the community and the ability to connect in deep and meaningful ways.  as i look at my life, and the life of those around me, i see changes taking place on deep personal levels - and this blog is one of those deep levels, or it could be - and prayerfully will be - as time moves on.  reach, teach, connect, comfort, embrace, commune, and most of all - love.  truth is in the narrative - and it is found in the heart of the story.  here's an interesting site note - when you do a spell check on this blog, the world "blog" goes up as a miss-spelling.  just my little punk monkey mind working -  blessings, punk monkey

       Norway: making disciples of the Vikings   The following is a report from Reinhold Scharnowski, European Coordinator of the Dawn Movement, from the third national Dawn Conference in Kristiansand, Norway in January 2002:  "Since 1993, a Norwegian team has been working to encourage a national evangelistic process through saturation church planting. During the 1996 conference, younger, radical leaders were reconciled with the more traditional part of Norway's Christians. Around 800 visitors, almost half of whom were under 30, joined the over 230 participants at this year's conference for the plenary sessions. In November 1996, Christian leaders set the target of planting 500 new churches by 2005; this year, church growth researcher Ommund Rolfsen reported that 146 of these have been planted so far, and that a national process of church planting has begun - though the target date may need to be put back. The number of new churches each year is growing constantly: between 1983 and 1993, 14 new churches were planted each year; the number is now 23 per year. According to Scharnowski, the most important developments visible at the conference were:  The Norwegian State Church is planting new churches Around one quarter of the new churches are being planted by the Norwegian Lutheran State Church. This is surprising for many, because most European state churches still work with a strict parish system.  The baton is being passed on The baton is being passed on to the new generation. Stefan Christiansen reported that the first "Jesus Revolution Church" had been planted in Oslo, with plans for new churches in Marseille, Barcelona, Milan and Munich as well as more 'New Generation Churches' throughout Norway. Leo Bigger, Swiss church planter and leader of the ICF Zurich, also spoke about planting churches for the new generation. In Norway, such new generation churches are no longer viewed as an unwelcome intruder, but as necessary new forms of church - new wineskins, but with respect for the old. "During the conference, I regularly saw young leaders being hugged and blessed by their elders," says Scharnowski.  Strategic unity There is a strategic unity and growing excitement about reaching the nation through planting all forms of church, from Lutheran through Pentecostal to completely new forms. Stefan Christiansen, who was viewed as a rebel only a few years ago, today preaches beside a Lutheran Bishop and the leader of the Pentecostals. Theology and structure gave rise to few discussions; the aim of achieving the unfulfilled missionary task brings great unity. Sten Sörensen, leader of the Norwegian Dawn team, believes that in 20 years, there will be 1,000 new churches in Norway

       Christian music musings.  The Gospel Music Association handed out its version of the Grammys, the Dove Awards, last night. How nice that we have our very own ghettoized awards ceremony, complete with Christian celebrities to host them. Anyway, surfing around brought me to  urlLink this article  about the state of so-called contemporary Christian music. I found this quote quite interesting:     It's becoming clear that most non-Christians will be no more attracted to a genre called 'Christian Music' than Christians would be attracted to a genre called 'Buddhist Music.' By ditching the label Buddhist Music, prominent Buddhists like Duncan Sheik have won a hearing among non-Buddhists for their music and their ideas. Christians who won't abandon the label 'Christian music,' even when doing so will bring this music and its lyrical content to more non-believers, are making a serious and critical mistake.     And then I saw some relevant links on  urlLink Karen Ward's  blog.  An invite.  I'd like to pass along an invitation to all to subscribe to an email newsletter I send out on the topic of evangelism on the Internet. You can read more about it  urlLink here . I'm about to upload the latest issue.

Q64    jesus speaks of a kingdom without ownership.    when we begin to attempt to broker this kingdom  we join those weeping with regret.   we do not sell this thing called the kingdom...

      jonny baker, from london, england. i've been blogging for exactly one week, learned my first piece of html in the process (making a link - wow!), and now i find i have been invited to join a global blog.... weird week! hi to all. it's early in the morning here and i can't think of anything overly inspirational to write to introduce myself. i'm involved in grace, an alternative worship community. i've also been in youth ministry for 14 years (don't let that put you off). i run a small record label, proost. love all things creative. i guess the reason i'm here is because andrew has slept in my lounge! cheers

      I guess we're supposed to introduce ourselves in this first blog.  At least that's what everyone else is doing.  So here's the boring formalities...My name is Mike Bishop and I am a church planter (sounds like an AA meeting - I often feel church planting is one long AA meeting).  To be more accurate, I am a willing participant in the Church God is building in West Palm Beach, Florida.  My wife and I moved here last year, had a baby boy, and started a baby church.  Somewhere along the way I decided to launch a website to chronicle our journey and called it whatischurch.com.  We were inspired to start blogging by everybody's blogging hero - Andrew Jones himself.  I say "we" because ours is a community blog like akingdomspace.    Okay, now that the formalities are over, let the fun begin.  It seems to me that one of the common pieces to the "where do we go from here" puzzle seems to be a theological and practical (those should bleed into each other, right?) understanding that "the Kingdom of God is among us."  Two of my heroes (and literary mentors) at this stage in my life are N.T. Wright and Dallas Willard.  They have been valuable friends on our journey this past year.  I believe, unless we grapple with the implications that the Gospel of Jesus is "The Kingdom is here and available for real life," we will simply be repackaging the consumer spiritualities the modern church helped to create.  That's what I'm thinking about most days...well, that and changing dirty diapers.

      Hi, I am Jakob Salzmann from Germany, 22 years old. When Andrew asked me for blogging here, my first thought was ...eeh, which was my first thought? But I remember my feelings, I was very excited - for he was asking me! Wow. But the longer I thought about, I asked myself: Who am I for that he asks me to take part at this great blog project?! I am just a boring student at a theological seminary which is in a small village at the ass of the world, as we say in Germany. The next city is just a small city, only 6000 people live there. And the next bigger city is Cologne, hours away, and I get there just may be one or two times a year. Normal people, I mean people who don't know anything of God I just meet in holidays (three times a year). At this seminary everything is about schoolstuff, about theology. We talk, for example, about the structure of verse 4 in Psalm 32 and we spend hours, I mean weeks! in discussing the role of women in church, or about what Barth thinks about dialectic. And this continues at our homes. (We live together as students in private houses...) For example today in the kitchen Andi asked me about my lecture I've had in NT Theology about how Bultmann and others understood &lambda;&omicron;&gamma;&omicron;&sigmaf; in John 1,1ff. This is our everyday life. Well, really not interesting for people who read this blog, isn't it? We just hang around on our "holy hill", don't know what is going on outside.   What I want to say is that I really don't know if I have to tell you anything. I am actually not really involved in any network. Well, I am a  urlLink JesusFreak , and there I am part of WorldWidePizzaService, which is our mission section - but it is just small, there doesn't really happen big things. (I mean in WWPS, not at JesusFreaks. JesusFreaks: We have a very nice festival in summer:  urlLink Freakstock . Ask Andrew...)  I sent Andrew a mail and said, sorry, but I am not the right man. Like Moses, in Ex 4,13: "O Lord, please send someone else to do it." What should  I  have to share with you? Later I thought about it, and I remembered my prayer: "...enlarge my territory." (you know it, Jabez, 1 Chr 4,10) May this invitation to blog here be an answer? O Lord, it is too big! But Jabez' prayer continues: "Let your hand be with me." And I also remembered Moses, who had to hear answer an angry God, who wanted  Moses  and not someone else to go. Just trust and go when God calls you.  So, that's why I am here at all. I will try to blog here, guessing it is  Gods  will. I hope we get to know us better. See you!  (Hi Andrew - this is my revocation!)

      hi everyone. i'm karen ward, a church planter and roving god watcher in seattle, washington. when i got my invite from andrew to be on the blogging team, and i read about how kingdom bloggers would be networked all over the globe, i thought, this is massive... this is an organic living example of "emergence theory" becoming a reality in the global church.   all of this jives with this book (from a non church vantage point) that i recently read called  urlLink "emergence- the connected lives of ants, brains, cities and software"  by steven johnson. it is not an "easy read," but is a quirky, fascinating and hugely relevant foray into the science of complexity and the rising theory of emergence (as the "bottom up" organizational paradigm that is increasingly guiding research across a myriad of disciplines). emergence theory already underlies the internet, and will increasingly inform the patterning of the 21st century church (as this akingdom space blog is a prime example).  about the title of this post. when i got the blog invite, i also thought of those catchy global aide songs that were popular back in the 80's (when i was in college), where people swayed and sang "we are the world, we are the children..." well, in many ways, kingdomspace blogging is a making a reality of something that was formerly and mostly swayed.  we are the world. we are god's children. we are helping to connect what god is doing all over the globe.  cheers!

      Thanks to Andrew for the invitation to join this team.  I never thought I'd say this, but it's an exciting time to be a Mennonite. Churchwide the question of raising up young leaders and reaching unchurched young adults has reached a fever pitch. I'm pretty convinced this time of transition from the modern world means creating new spaces for young leaders and young adults. A hearty welcome into existing churches may work for some, but the vast majority of the emerging culture simply will not connect to existing congregations in my denomination (big news flash to most of you, right?)  Pray that God will strengthen my voice on this subject, and that those with ears will hear.  Peace.

      "Proclaim every day the good news that we are saved. Proclaim his glory to the nations, his mighty deeds to all people" (1 Chronicles 16). This is what David said to the Levites when he charged them with the responsibility of singing praises to God.  Today I have to do the same thing. There are about 20 bloggers that are in tune with what God is doing in their world and I will be asking them to put their voices together on one blog page. It will eventually be released on akingdomspace.org (not there yet so dont go there, uh uh, dont go there, girlfriend). I expect there to be 100 bloggers soon and having them speak from all over the world will be a great way of making known what God is doing.  BTW - the word "praise" means to publically acknowledge. Praise is not praise unless it is shared or made public. It is also something that we do to each other, not to God. The word "Hallelujah" means 'Hey you, go ahead and publically acknowlege Yahweh.' I think Blogging will become a great way to do that.

It's now on this month's edition of  urlLink Next-Wave  along with several others from some in this very company of bloggers - Andrew (both Jones and Careaga), Mike Bishop, and I'm not sure if Jason Evans is in this bunch but he has something up there on house churches as well. Have fun!

      Just joined akingdomspace. Thanks Andrew for the invitation. I'm currently networking young prayer leaders for an event called  urlLink Connect Europe . Maybe you can help:    a. who are the young leaders (under 35) in your nation who are leading a national prayer movement for their generation, or who are pro-actively rallying young people to pray for the nation?  b. who are the young leaders (under 35) in your nation that do not yet lead such a movement, but have the potential to kick-start something like that within the next two years?     urlLink Mail me  their names and e-mail addresses and earn a free pint of beer (or milk when you're American) when we meet in Prague. :-)

I think pouring it on the ground would be slightly out of place seeing as you're still alive. I'll be checking out this Route 66 place too Andrew C. You'll be there too - maybe you can join our ever growing Guinness / microbrew outing. I am very excited about getting together with so many significant people in the Kingdom - and some kinda big shot speaker types too. Being together with people who are seeing and hearing the same things will be an amazing thing. Just maybe some of us can get online somewhere while we're there and post some reactions on the conference. We'll see. Talk to some of you guys tomorrow!

      According to  urlLink a new study  about the life of churches in the USA,  urlLink small churches still dominate the religious landscape . From the news report: "American worship is lopsided toward small congregations, fewer men in the pews, a once-a-week gathering and few newcomers at the service." Moreover, "'Most worshippers are not involved in small groups in their congregation,' the study said. Also, 'in an entire year, most people did not invite even one person.' ... On the bright side, the report said it dispelled several myths about congregation life, such as that most worshippers are retirees or that congregations lack forces for change." From  urlLink CT's Weblog .  For Newcastle Brown Ale  or just about any other microbrew available in St. Louis  (which  is  home to Anheuser-Busch, the anti-microbrew), I suggest a trip to  urlLink Route 66 Brewery  in St. Louis's Union Station on Market Street.  urlLink Here  is one review of the products available there. The food is decent, too, as are the prices.

       grow your own! (church planting network)   this is karen ward (in the pacific nortwest region of north america).  my latest project might have been motivated by jealousy, but god can use even that, to plant seeds for the kingdom.  on some post (on the blog of alan creech), i found out about an organic church planters group that was started in the heartland of the united states called the  urlLink "midwest greenhouse."    immediately, i sent alan an e-mail saying "can i come out and play?" then, i realized that in order to play, you had to be in proximity to the playground... and i was 2000 miles (3218 kilometers) away. oh lord, what to do... well, maybe we'll build our own swing-set here in "cascadia" (our own little neighborhood of washington, oregon and british columbia).   knowing that each context is different, we will not ask alan to export to us a ready-made, "add water and stir," carbon copy of the playground kit they are using in the midwest. what god wants, i think, is for us to share the same spirit, yet grow our own local expression and network. ironically, "growing your own" is what people out here are known for. our region is a haven for free spirits and "do it yourselfers," and our pioneer spirit is evident in everything from our local microbrewed coffees, to our kickin' microbrewed beers.  today, i'm meeting with two other seattle church planters, eugene cho of  urlLink  quest  and dwight friesen of another  urlLink  quest,   to talk about what kind of swing-set we can build in our soon to be formed "northwest hothouse,"  a place to disciple one another, to re-create, to share, to discern, to grow in the knowledge and fear of god, and to otherwise play in the fields of the lord in the pac northwest (so stay tuned...)

      have just returned from toronto doing a week's training at wycliffe which is an anglican college. surprise surprise they were facing the same issues as the rest of us - struggling church, old forms of church no longer connecting, and were hungry for ideas and connections with new things that might work.... we did our best to spark their imaginations and creativity. but it's clear that the shift we all bang on about is happening all over - up the revolution....

       urban, suburban, rural, does it matter???   I was ranting on  urlLink my blog  on Saturday about the fact that I - yes I - live in the suburbs. Oh my Gaaawwwwdd!!! I won't go on and on about it here again. I probably did too much there. The question that arises out of my thoughts and talking to other friends is this: Where are we? Where are we who are (what are we anyway?) - who are trying to do this "nuevo church" thing - to reinvent how the community of Christ is lived out on the planet??? Are we all in the inner city? Are we all doing exactly the same things in the same ways? I think the obvious answer is no -> I point to my brother's reference to "liking rainbows" below. Some of us live in the suburbs. Some of us like it and not because we are greedy, self-absorbed, isolationist Christians. Most of the people in my neighborhood are around my age actually. I think we just live where we live. As I said the other day, we who are in the Kingdom need to be anywhere there are those outside the Kingdom - we need to infect every neighborhood and village."   I'm excited about meeting a bunch of wild people in St. Louis at Search Party in a few days. Just being together with people who are as weird as I am for a little while will be a good thing. See you there!

       urlLink Christianity  is growing robustly, according to historian Philip Jenkins, who says the quintessential Christian of the future will not be a white male surbanite but a poor brown-skinned woman from a huge city in the Third World.

       urlLink Fall and rise of Christianity In his latest book, "The Next Christendom: The Coming of Global Christianity," Jenkins says that the center of Christianity has moved southward and the typical Christian in the world today is a Latin American or African woman. Currently, Europeans make up about 28 percent of the world's Christian population, down from 70 percent in 1900, said Dana Robert, a theology professor at Boston University who has written extensively on global Christianity. By the year 2050, six nations will each have over 100 million Christians, Jenkins projects. Only one, the United States, represents the "advanced industrialized world." The other countries are Brazil, Mexico, the Philippines, Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire). Jenkins notes that "traditional heartlands of Christianity" such as Britain, France and Italy are absent from the list.

       the vine   I just created a new community blog for our - well, for our community. I know it's a ch, chu, "church" but I try not to use that word as much as possible if not only to get away from my own baggage. It's called  urlLink "the vine" . I was obviously inspired by this thing. We're a small bunch and this blog has just gotten started but I hope it will be a very cool way for others to look into what we're doing in a real way - oh, and Kevin Rains is very jealous that I have done this - so I told him I would help them set one up as well - the revolution has begun!

      Andrew J., thank you for pointing us to so many terrific resources and for bringing us together at A Kingdom Space. Thanks for writing "The Time of the Turtles." I wonder if that turtle on the 24-7 Prayer site has "fallen under the power" and is "laughing in the Spirit" or carrying on in some similar manner. :-) Thanks also for referring readers of TallSkinnyKiwi to  urlLink G-Force , which I spent much of the weekend trying to learn. I'm thrilled to find an alternative to PowerPointless. If you have any G-Force tips for me, please send 'em my way. Thanks. -- Andrew C. P.S. -- I noticed at the end of the FAQ for G-Force, Andy O'Meara, who created the software, wrote: "G-Force is dedicated to God and His uncanny patience. 'If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free' (Jesus, John 8:31-32)." Pretty cool stuff.

      "God's secret plan has now been revealed to us; it is a plan centered on Christ, designed long ago according to his good pleasure.  And this is his plan: At the right time he will bring everything together under the authority of Christ--everything in heaven and on earth.” - Eph. 1:9,10    Jesus is the Center.  Our group keeps coming back to this amazing reality.  It's very easy in this new time to get caught up in "what works" or what will work in our churches and miss the simple, glorious power of Jesus being the foundation of everything we do.      I heard  urlLink Gordon Cosby  tell a story one time about a seminar he did for a group of megachurch pastors.  The seminar was called, "Vision, the Destroyer of Essence."  It's easy to see how "seeker-targeted" groups can make the mistake of missing Jesus along the way, but what about us?  Are we putting our trust in a new form of church (or worship or mission or community) that will take the world by storm?  Or, are we willing to follow "God's secret plan" that was sculpted millennia ago, that  He  will bring everything under Christ's authority?    Let God build his church.

       a "new" way of evangelism   I am, we are, I think alot of people are - wrestling with a new way to do evangelism. It's new for what many of us have been trained to do anyway - probably not "new" as a whole. I mean I seem not to be the only one who's trying to look past that cold-call, bring people to a crisis decision quickly, kind of thing - on to a much slower, relational connection, walking with people on a long journey inward kind of thing. I hope that makes sense.   Not feeling like you haven't done successful evangelism because you don't have a list of 20 people who've been "saved" in the last 6 months. Maybe you've built some beginning relationships with 3 new people who are outside the Kingdom in that time, and you have begun to "be Jesus" to them over the long haul. Then at some point perhaps it becomes more "official" and they enter a period of cathechesis, of teaching and pre-formation, pre-belonging to the community of faith, and then they are a full member of Christ and the community. See what I mean?   I think the Catholics and Anglicans among us may have a little greater understanding of this. Looks like we all need to learn from each other - that God works and speaks everywhere and we need not to block Him off at the pass.

I feel drawn to plant a church, to bring people out of the Matrix and into something real. But I'm not sure I'm the one. Neo is coming along somewhere. I feel like I'm heralding this new thing in my denomination, bringing people on board, like Trinity and Neo. But at least at the moment, I'm not the one in the trenches. This is one weird post.

      Greetings from Prague! Just wanted to write about Derek Chapman and Amy MacDonald's wedding that I went to yesterday- it was amazing!!!  God only told them to get married a week ago, as part of the Epicentrum Prague worship event (a follow-up to what happened in Austin, Texas last year).  It's been a busy week pulling everything together, but a joy to serve them and be a part of what God was doing.  It was costly for them to do their wedding this way, without family around and without all the minutely planned details, but it was a wedding which was true to them and to what God is doing in and through them, and it was a real blessing to be a part of it.  With Derek and Amy being prophets, the wedding had a significantly prophetic edge (in terms of the church and where Jesus wants to take it as his bride) that I think we're all going to be processing for some time yet. But, in summary, it was cool!! And Andrew Jones looked extremely funky in his morning suit and biker boots!

      Some news from Cincinnati...  God continues to open doors. This week Owen and Sandie are going to Chicago to help equip some urban missionaries. They were invited by friend Bart Campolo to speak to the City Directors of the Mission Year program. Mission Year places young people in urban neighborhoods for 1 year to live in communitiy with each other while serving and blessing urban neighborhoods. They do an amazing job of incarnating the gospel in some difficult places. The potential for them to plant reproducing house churches is enormous. I think the Brocks hope to inspire some of that while there. More info on Mission Year  urlLink here   Dave and Jody are going to Columbus this weekend to teach at the Urban Center for Spiritual Formation. This is a new initiative led by our friends Mark and Jen Palmer from the Landing Place (a network of simple churches, ministries, and other cool artsy stuff). I’m assuming they’ll be teaching on spiritual formation in a community living context. I’m not sure. Dave’s not sure either. He probably won’t know till he opens his mouth and starts teaching this Saturday! Ahhh, the gift of teaching...   I’m buying tickets today for a trip to the east coast and Quebec. Joe Boyd and I are going there to build relationships with several church planters. Our goals are simply to learn from them and encourage them. We’re hoping that some partnerships will develop over time. There are several emerging networks on the east coast (as well some established ones we hope to see as well) and Quebec. The current plan is to go to Boston, New Hampshire, New York, and then drive to Quebec. The trip is being generously funded by DAWN ministries. More on this one as we get closer to the trip...

      Author Douglas Rushkoff ( Cyberia ,  Ecstasy Club ,  Media Virus , etc.) recently posted a fascinating piece about the renaissance occurring in global culture today -- tying together loose ends from art, mathematics and physics, media and of course the Internet. He writes about the change in perspective brought about by Renaissance art, and compares that to the multiplicity of perspectives occurrring in culture today. Here's a snippet:  The evidence of today's renaissance is at least as profound as that of the one that went before. The16th Century saw the successful circumnavigation of the globe via the seas. The 20th century saw the successful circumnavigation of the globe from space. The first pictures of earth from space changed our perspective on this sphere, forever. In the same century, our dominance over the planet was confirmed not just through our ability to travel around it, but to destroy it. The atomic bomb (itself the result of a rude dimensional interchange between submolecular particles) gave us the ability to destroy the globe. Now, instead of merely being able to circumnavigate "God's" creation, we could actively destroy it. This is a new perspective.  From his essay  urlLink "Renaissance  now ?"

      interesting, is it not, that we spend the better part of 18 years telling children that they are not allowed in "grown-up church" only to ask why, as adults, they are not in church?  the reasons?      1.  kids cry!  praise God, some expression of emotion in church. 2.  kids squirm!  after a 40 minute boring sermon and dead songs - I SQUIRM. 3.  kids don't understand!  heck, 99% of the times adults don't understand (and the 1% they do, they don't get it right.)      i remember one of the very first churches i served as solo pastor (i was going to say "pastor solo" but then figured that would be too "star war-ie") i gave a "children's message" (usual a sign that we were about to kick the kids out of the church) after the service an elderly man came to me and said that that was the very first time in 50 years he actually understood what was being said.  too many churches take to heart the kjv of scripture where it says "suffer the children unto me" - not remembering that the word "suffer" has changed in meaning.  we need to embrace our children, the best way a child can learn to pray is to see their parents pray; the best way a child can learn how to be a cheerful giver, is to see their parents give with a cheerful heart.  it does not matter how "cool" our children's program is, during worship - nothing is cooler then seeing tour parents worship a loving and true God.      - just my thoughts.

       what do we do with the kids!?   That's a huge question for a lot of us who are planting churches in a new paradigm. Do we have "Sunday School"? Do we put them in a different house or room with a baby sitter if we're doing house church? What!? It seems the answer is coming back to a good many of us that it is high time the kids be treated as part of the community and allowed to participate in community activities, meetings, etc. like the adults. It's an integral part of the new ecclesiastical revolution if you ask me. So, how does that look? How? Rob Graham from  urlLink Levi's Table  e-mailed me about this, suggesting a new forum to discuss this. I thought - team blog! So we have started a new blog devoted to the ongoing discussion  urlLink what do we do with the kids!?  Take a look - you may even want to be a part. We have people already from one end of the US to the other, and New Zealand.

      i have a new job! this may come as a surprise to people that know me well as i've worked for youth for christ for 14 years now. but it's time for a change... i will be working for the church mission society as their national youth co-ordinator starting on 1 september. cms are a mission agency, strongly linked with the anglican church. they've been around for 200 years and have done fantastic stuff down the years all round the world. but like so many organisations they are wrestling with what it means to do mission and what church should now be like in the new cultural context we find ourselves in. to try and develop new approaches of mission and church cms have set a new department 'impact' - this is the department i will be part of. youth for cms is age 16-25. the positioning of the job in this department is an exciting move i think. the job is to help develop a mission movement amongst youth in the uk and also to link and join in with a global mission movement so the links via blogs and all that could grow. youth congregations, emerging church, and all that.... are very much part of the brief. i'll let you know how it goes!

      we have been talking about the difference between "community" and "tribe" on the e-group " urlLink postmodern_theology " and i got to wondering.  as a postmodern people we claim to want to be connected, and with the possible accepting of this blog - what community do we have?  most of our "postmodern sites" operate in our respective vacuums, with the possible exceptions of  urlLink jordon cooper,  urlLink  next-wave ,  urlLink ginkworld , and  urlLink seven  - we just don't "connect."  i think, before we can say we want to develop community - we need to be willing to truly be connected.  and when i say connected, we need to speak beyone "special events" that happen once a year, and only for those who can afford to get hook in - john

           A new day for a new generation. 100,000 people attended  urlLink The Call New York City  on Saturday 29th June. The prayer/worship event ran from 6am until 6pm and was held at Flushing Meadows - also known as the field of dreams. 16,000 people attended  urlLink The Call England  on Saturday 13th July. The prayer/worship event ran from 10am until 9pm and was held at the Madejski Stadium, Reading. 200,000 people attended the  urlLink Catholic World Youth Days  in Toronto between 22 and 28 July.    Also read some of the stuff Jonny suggested on  urlLink 'churchless faith' . Gives good insight in why people leave the church. Alan Jamieson interviewed 108 people who have left churches in New Zealand and was surprised by what he found: people were not leaving 'mainline' or 'traditional' churches, but evangelical or pentecostal/charismatic churches, predominantly between the ages of 30-45, the vast majority held key leaderships positions before leaving, and had done either full-time Christian study/work, they had been involved in churches for an average of 15.8 years and the majority retain their faith while leaving the church.

      i spent the weekend in the san francisco/oakland area this past weekend and i found out something very interesting.  i was looking for a particular church and only had a general cross streets as a location (14th and market).  as i was searching for this church i decided to stop and ask some of the other churches where the church was.  i approached a roman catholic church and through a small inforced window the women told me that she thought that they were the only church in the area.  i turned around and right across the street was a very large lutheran church - they ministered in the same city, on the same street on blocks next to each other and believe it or not, neither knew the other was there.  the luthern church had no idea where the other church was, and had no idea there was a roman catholic church across the street - how could this be?  then it dawned on me - most of us have no idea who lives next door to us, so what makes me think the church would be any different?

      don't know if you've come across the book 'churchless faith' by alan jamieson. it's a piece of research of in depth interviews with people who have left (mainly evangelical/pentecostal churches) as to why they left and how they are pursuing faith now. it's both fascinating and compelling.  anyway the author/researcher is in london in sept giving a lecture/seminar at kings university. i attach details below that pete ward sent me. if you are interested in going  urlLink e-mail pete    Got Alan Jamieson author of Churchless Faith coming to The Theology Mission and Culture Seminar at Kings College London on 25th Sept 12:30-2:00  The session will be in The Department of Education and Professional Studies, Waterloo Bridge Wing The Franklin Wilkins Building.There will be posters in the Lobby giving a room number.  Alan is from New Zealand and his recently published  book is about the spiritual journeys of evangelicals who have left the Church.  This is obviously a key area for most of us to consider.  His paper is titled  Churchless faith - coming and going from evangelical churches

      Here's a verbatim from my own blog,  urlLink the wonderful world of eggbert :  I'm checking out  urlLink The Rise of the Creative Class  by Richard Florida. It's a look at creative and innovative people as a social group, and how they transform communities the more they are concentrated in a community.   I saw immediate parallels to what's happening in not-yet institutionalized new christian faith communities (that's cynical. We'll never institutionalize, of course!) forming around the country. My guess is that a large portion of those in these faith communities are among the creative class. Hmm...

      Sometimes it feels like I'm gliding on something so huge, so "of God", that it takes my breath away. Reading everybody's blogs, listening to stories, yearning for some fresh wind of the Spirit that is blowing so strong right now in our world - it's huge. And it's small. An orange house in Prague. A woman winging it in Seattle - a postmodern Lutheran! who would have thought it. Prayer ministers. Artists. Theologians. It's a great time to dance, to knock off a few sacred cows. It's huge, but it seems rather simple, too. I often try to make things complex, but having a little God party in your home - it takes a little planning (who's bringing the potato salad?), but it can also just kind of flow. We're getting a hot tub tomorrow, and my wife and I both thought, "now there's the start of a great house church!". Peace and blessings.

I am also bummed that I cant make it to  urlLink TOMFEST  which starts today I think. Actually, they changed the name to Portico.  Tim is leading the DJ night and he asks for prayer:  Tim and Xeia say: "Really we are simply a group of freaks who have found a niche this year :)  we would appreciate prayer! please pray about the festival, it IS a Christian-run fest, most of the bands are followers of the Way, but there are humans there, and where they go, sin follows.. please pray for the impact that these bands can make, that they would be bold with His name not only on stage, but in how they walk and talk and set an example to the thousands of kids there. please pray that this year wuld be a year of artistic discovery and worshipful release of gifts and talents.. that our humble efforts (simply a group of artist types somewhat organized intoo an installation/worship expression/interactive opportunity) would bear fruit greater than we could ever expect.. (thru Him alone..) also, we would appreciate specific prayer for saturday night, every year at this festival they have a token 'dj' night, incorporating some aspects of dj and rave culture into the flow and stream of subculture already evident (punk, goth, hiphop, avant..everything loud and colourful).. this year we seem to have been given this task .. we hope to lift up His name, to show how not only are many lovers of Jesus in this culture, but that God inhabits the praises of His people within it's expression. we hope to run from a contemplative possibly liturgical ambient-media environment to a loud, Jesus -celebrating expression of rhythm, colour, light, sound, texture, harmony.. in His sweet Name and arms.. tim and xea westcott"

       Top Ten Signs Your Group is Getting TOO Small.   10. You can follow up on all group members without leaving your house. 9. Your daughter sets out her dolls, so there is only one empty chair. 8. During Prayer time you find yourself quoting Matthew 18:20 "Where two or three are gathered..." 7. Every Chair is the empty chair. 6. Your usual waitress at the restaurant where your weekly men's small group meets asks, "Will anyone be joining you this week?" 5. You over hear your son explain to a friend, "Naw, she doesn't always talk to herself. Just during small group discussions." 4. You say, "Tonight we're going to pray for the empty room." instead of the empty chair. 3. When you join in prayer and you have to hold your own hand. 2. You decide to grow the group by encouraging schizophrenia. 1. Worship involves: You, a guitar, and 5 cardboard cutouts.  -from Volume 1, Issue 14 of  Small Group Dynamics-Byte Size , a free twice a month email from The Small Group Network @  .

      Next week, 23-26 August, EPL will gather 55 young prayer leaders from 14 European nations in Herrnhut, Germany for a time of prophetic prayer and fellowship. We believe it's a 'kairos' time to see the birth of youth prayer movements all over Europe. Please stand with us in prayer: that the Lord will accomplish all that is on His agenda and that the Holy Spirit will move mightily. At the moment Saxony is suffering severe floodings and the centre of Dresden (that most of the participants have to cross) is under the water. So we could also use some extra prayer for travel mercies. More information on the event:  urlLink http://www.joelnews.nl/connecteurope.htm .

      This came to me from Spencer Burke at TheOOZE.      urlLink  SOULARIZE: A LEARNING PARTY   OCT. 15 - 18, 2002 MINNEAPOLIS, MN   EXPLORE the mystery, adventure, and community of ministry in our emerging culture. Join other artists, musicians, storytellers, church leaders, church planters, theologians, and community advocates. Over the past four years at Soularize, people have found refreshing and challenging ways to connect with other church leaders who are wrestling with ministry in the 21st century (whether you call it postmodernism, emerging generations, or the next church). Soularize 2002 will expose you to the latest trends, tools, authors and speakers and have the surprise moments that have made Soularize a unique and inspiring conference.   AUGUST 31ST IS THE END OF EARLY REGISTRATION for Soularize 2002 at $199 per person ($125 spouses).   If you've been thinking about going, you might as well save some bucks and sign up now!  (There are special discounts for multiple team member registration too.) After August 31, the cost is $249.  urlLink http://www.TheOoze.com/Soularize    We know we?re reaching leaders in the emerging culture that are bi-vocational-if not multi-vocational-so scholarships are available based on need.   Soularize's unique edge is our speakers and experiences. For example:    THE REVEREND BERNICE KING, daughter of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., is one of our featured keynote speakers.    urlLink THE DAMAH INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL TOUR --three days after the 2002 winners are announced, we will host the first stop on the 2002 Tour of this festival of spiritual experiences in film.  urlLink http://www.damah.com/films.html    SOULARIZE WORKSHOPS come from our community, so it's virtually all the authors, speakers and friends that you've come to recognize, and a chance to meet in person many of those names or aliases you've run into on the phone or online.  Brian McLaren, Liquid thinking,  urlLink Rudy Carrasco ,  urlLink Tom & Christine Sine , Dan Kimball, Denise VanEck, Chris Seay,  urlLink Karen Ward , Tony Jones, Holly Rankin, Mark Oestreicher, Heather Kirk-Davioff,  urlLink Jordon Cooper , Joel Vestal, Andy Harrington, John Franke, Doug Pagitt   LARGE SCALE PUBLIC ART--Tour guides/docents will help us explore the emotional, aesthetic and spiritual impact of art in the largest urban sculpture garden in the U.S. and how the church might contribute to the arts.   INTERACTIVE LABS including video editing, digital photography, art expression, cyber café, theology pub, song-writing studio, experiential worship installations and screening room (bring your own videos). If you are a musician, you might want to consider joining our house band "The Dirty Worship Band" led by Tim Taber formally of The Prayer Chain.   15 MINUTES OF FAME - many conferences have representatives from companies come and tell you what you need, trying to sell you their wares.  At Soularize we reverse the roles.  Publishers, record companies, stock art buyers, etc. come to discover the new resources of the emerging culture.  Bring your CD-Rom, your manuscript, your demo tape, or instrument and you'll have a chance to meet and talk with people that you'd have a difficult time meeting outside of the Soularize context.   If you love to learn in a hands-on relational way, and like the idea of a schedule with longer lunches and open evenings for discussion with fellow travelers, I hope that you'll check out the website and that we'll see you in Minneapolis in October.  urlLink http://www.TheOoze.com/Soularize

       urlLink Freakstock  (01.-04.08.02) It has been a great festival again. Around 5000 people have been there. Every day GoD encouraged me and gave me a hopeful heart... It was good to be with many of my friends again, to be with my family ( urlLink jesusfreaks.com ). (Read also  urlLink Andrews weblog .) Great to see for me was that there are similar groups in Chile (Christock) or Norway (SubChurch,  urlLink dpFestival ). SubChurch in Oslo and JesusFreaks Germany have the same roots: Martin Dreyer and his wife (JF) and also Morten Holmquist (SC) have been on this houseboat from YWAM in Amsterdam (maybe in 1990?), where they hung around with David Pierce and his band No Longer Music. After coming home Martin started the JesusFreaks and Morten the SubChurch - without knowing of each other! But GoD made his thing: The groups are very similar to each other, also in Chile. Good to see that we are not alone on this planet, with this idea in our heart which GoD gave us.

      Greetings of peace to those in the Way all around the world. I am posting today to ask for your prayers for some of least of these among our brothers and sisters.    I attended a Christian boarding school in Pakistan growing up. Some of the best days of my life were lived in this crazy place called Murree (named after Mary the mother of Jesus--tradition says that she traveled there with Thomas and other pilgrims after the death of her other son James in 62--there is a tomb for her in Murree). Murree Christian School was attacked by terrorists Monday. Many people were killed.     Please pray for the families of those killed. These deaths impact the families in many ways. The families are already a persecuted minority being poor Christians in Pakistan. With the passing of their father or older brother in this incident many have now lost their primary source of income.     Please pray for the continued safety of the students and staff at MCS.    Please pray for the families that are giving their lives and children for the message of peace in Pakistan.    Pray for the attackers in this incident and for fortitude for those in the Way in this situation that they would find a way to love their enemies and in so doing enact the divine in their midst.     I'll be updating my blog with links to the story as they come available-- urlLink theyblinked.blogspot.com .   Peace to you my friends,   Dan

So Vaux and Grace and Epicentre are inviting anyone interested in mutated church to join them in a transgenic experiment upstairs at Horse (not with a Horse). Intended as an informal opportunity to talk-shop, exchange ideas and develop relationships. We want London Zoo to be a place where the M25 alt worship scene can come together in a relaxed context. To encourage, cross-fertilize, sharpen and envision.  Upstairs at Horse: 124 Westminster Bridge Road, SE1 Transport: Lambeth North (30 secs) Waterloo (5 mins) Time: 1/8/02  8pm   probably worth mentioning too that there is also a get together for anyone involved or interested in alternative worship on the monday night at greenbelt 8pm in seminar tent 2.

Andrew is there already (fighting the 24-7 bulls), as well as Derek and Amy, whose  urlLink 'prophetic wedding'  we celebrated in Prague last June during the Inspiration Bohemia event.    The Americans like it big and up-front: a new movement known as the  urlLink '30-Second Kneel Down'  is sweeping the nation as high school students boldly kneel in prayer for the teachers, students, and administrators of their schools. The vision of this movement is 'to see a generational awakening come to the youth generation around the world, in order for them to reap a last days' harvest.'

There's lots of potential for a church planting movement in Oxford... this will be one to watch. These guys are sharp. Here's arecent email describing their decision... also he asks for some input (feel free to send them an email with any ideas... I also think it'd be great if some of us pursuing this decentralized,network of simple churches stuff would send them an email an say "Welcome aboard!" If you wanna do that his email is: Planterdudes@aol.com   Here's the email he sent us...     > "Well, we've done it......... the Veritas CoreCommunity came together Sunday  > night and we've decided to launch 2 home churches on October 13th.

       urlLink SEE YOU AT THE POLE  This week, on Sep 18, over 3 million youth around the world will pray for their nation. See You At The Pole started in Texas in 1990 with just a few young people and has been growing ever since. It is now in 20 countries and is one of the largest youth prayer movements in the world. Read the  urlLink SYATP History  and find out how to be a part. The tragic shooting at Fort Worth church in 1999, where 8 young people died, was a SYATP event. I was in Fort Worth that night, as a kick off to the Boaz Project. I feel this is a movement that God is using powerfully. They have already seen their martyrs and might one day see the great outbreaking of God''s grace that they are praying for.

       urlLink Barna  on Sep 11. : Church attendance spiked for several weeks after Sept. 11, but it was a short-lived revival. By November, attendance numbers had fallen back to the same levels as before the attacks. ___Barna found little or no change over the last year in the percentage of Americans who read their Bible regularly (41 percent), attend church (43 percent) or pray (83 percent). The percentage of unchurched Americans remained constant at 33 percent.

      This morning’s requests: a San Franciscan is going to London and wants a postmodern church. An English girl is moving to Glasgow  - same request. What did I suggest? Always different, of course, depending on who and what background they have, but I suggested Grace in London and a new church start in Glasgow led by the Christian Associates (based in Netherlands). The Glasgow team are very cool. One of them is French. They are hanging out in the Rave/Dance party scene and bringing life to the city of Glasgow, which is quite a tough city.

       encouraging news today.... last year one of the best weeks of the labyrinth tour was at feltham young offenders institute (a prison for young offenders). the lads there seemed to get loads out of it. the chaplain was delighted. anyway to cut a long story short, the prison raised some funds and arranged that YFC would make them a labyrinth cloth with all the necessary bits (TVs, bucket, stones etc...) so that they can run it regularly themselves in the prison. the kit was delivered yesterday. good eh?!

      had a wonderful time at refill in denmark this weekend. great to meet with 400 crazy danish youth leaders and see what they are up to! there were a few things that were particularly good. one was that on the saturday morning they had invited a business school (secular) called the kaos pilots (a school training people in creative and innovative approaches to business) to work with them to think about how the church needs to change to connect with youth in denmark. about 30 people came from the business school and worked in small groups. the ideas arising from this are being written up for everyone. then in the evening they had a collection to set up a fund so that people could apply for money to kickstart their new ideas! i thought this was some really out of the box thinking on the part of the planning group. the labyrinth was also set up and running. there was a club approach to worship being tried in the evening by some people looking to start a church in the techno scene in copenhagen. i was doing some training on alternative/creative approaches to worship that seemed to go down well. there are some guys in denmark who have realy pioneeered for youth miistry there - they are doing research in social trends amongst youth, running a youth ministry course and at the weekend unveiled the 'reflektorium' which is the first danish youth ministry journal. this is going to come out twice a year. so lots to be encouraged about. i felt very hopeful.....   one curious thing happened to me that is probably worth recounting. i had a train tciket from odense to copenhagen to return to the airport and it was a resreved numbered seat. it turned out that a danish pastor, dan was on the same train as me. he also had a resrved seat number. when we looked to see where each other were sitting it turned out that we were next to each other. that was a really nice moment of feeling god was with me even in the small detail....

       Spencer Burke is a great guy....  I had a great time having lunch with Spencer Burke today. Most of you know that Spencer and Dave Trotter co-founded the ooze. They met with Next-Wave's founding editor, Rogier Bos, in 1999 when we were all beginning our adventures in cyberspace....As Next-Wave and the ooze begin their 5th year, Spencer has been busy doing some great stuff, Soularize, Soularize worship CDs. the ooze community with nearly 10,000 registered users, and about 75,000 visitors a month, Seed Stories, Etrek and much more to come....When I got the idea to start Next-Wave I was discouraged, thinking that not much was being done to foster missional churches to reach the emerging culture...It didn't take long to figure out that there was nothing to be discouraged about, God was busy raising up leaders and building his church....It's been fun to see Him at work and it will be fun to watch what He does in the years ahead....

       Amaze  I met with Jackie Sewell yesterday.  After many years working with Anglican Youth ministry, she’s pursuing a new dream.  She wants to start Amaze, an arts and spirituality space for teenagers.  It will have safe prayer space, workshops to enhance creativity and spirituality and offer referral services as need me.  A focused prayer space for teenagers.  We dreamed together and explored how our dreams overlap in terms of art and spirituality and monastic movements, and how they differ in terms of her focus on youth, while  urlLink Graceway  started out as 20-30’s and as people grow and join us, as proved to nourish people across the spectrum.  Pray for Jackie.  Its a cool dream and a lot needs to happen for her.  I offered to build her a simple website.  When that happens, you’ll be able to drop in and say Hi and encourage her.

       A Picture of the Kingdom    Another image from the history of the Church:   From Cyprian (who said "The example of living is given to us in Christ.")   taken from his treatise "On the Advantage of Patience":    But what and how great is the patience in God, that, most patiently enduring the profane temples and the images of earth, and the sacrilegious rites instituted by men, in contempt of His majesty and honour, He makes the day to begin and the light of the sun to arise alike upon the good and the evil; and while He waters the earth with showers, no one is excluded from His benefits, but upon the righteous equally with the unrighteous He bestows His undiscriminating rains. We see that with undistinguishing equality of patience, at God's behest, the seasons minister to the guilty and the guiltless, the religious and the impious-those who give thanks and the unthankful; that the elements wait on them... And that we may more fully understand, beloved brethren, that patience is a thing of God, and that whoever is gentle, and patient, and meek, is an imitator of God the Father; when the Lord in His Gospel was giving precepts for salvation, and, bringing forth divine warnings, was instructing His disciples to perfection, He laid it down, and said, "Ye have heard that it is said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and have thine enemy in hatred. But I say unto you, Love your enemies, and pray for them which persecute you; that ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven, who maketh His sun to rise on the good and on the evil, and raineth upon the just and on the unjust. For if ye love them which love you, what reward shall ye have? do not even the publicans the same? And if ye shall salute your brethren only, what do ye more (than others)? do not even the heathens the same thing? Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect."     Maybe patience is one way that we point to a "story that is bigger than our own"???

      I find the following subject a fascinating dimension of thinking and reflecting on Church and mission in a 21st century Aotearoa New Zealand context…what are Christian authentic communities? Where do they live out their communal existence? How do they live that ‘existence’ out in terms of the missional challenge of the “gospel”? And, how do they contextualise and communicate that gospel? New Zealand is a mission field with very real challenges for Jesus-followers. Both challenging and exciting!   "Ah, who will ever count the centuries examined in the margins of our books?”   This is a quote from the Jewish poet/writer, Edmond Jabes, and it forms the central inspiration of my book, “ urlLink  Living in the Margins  ” (appears to be out of print).   “… To live in the margins of tradition is to live in a vital space of interpretive activity that keeps the "book" living, growing, expanding with new commentary and enlivening questions. Many small Christian communities occupy this marginal space, living on the edge of tradition -- in the margins -- attending both to the claims of the tradition to which they belong and to the claims of new, unexpected situations. In a sense, marginal Christian communities are both "inside" the book and "outside" the book, with the margins of interpretation mediating between these two spaces …”  Terry A. Veling (Aussies and Kiwi’s will find an essay distillation of the above book in his essay – “Margin Writing and Marginal Communities: Between Belonging and Non-Belonging” – Published in  urlLink  Pacifica   9 / February 1996.)  Not an easy read, but who knows who reads this, and what they like reading, so, for an on-line example of his writing see: " urlLink  Levinas and the Other Side of Theology  ." He has some good things to say.  (In academic circles,  urlLink  Emmanuel Levinas   (1906-1995) is recognised as one of the most important philosophers and religious thinkers of this century. His work has significantly influenced many "postmodern" thinkers such as Jacques Derrida, Maurice Blanchot, Luce Irigaray, Paul Ricoeur. He has also influenced Jewish and Christian leaders and educators, including Pope John Paul II. However, his  thinking is not generally well known to a broader audience.)

       Thanks to those who prayed    We kicked off  urlLink Xpressions  last night.  It was a great night of creativity and community through storytelling.  Great to have some fellow theo-blogians turn up -  urlLink rachel  and  urlLink paul  although it should be noted that neither told a yarn.  I've had a first draft go at a theology of storytelling on my  urlLink blogspot  and the possibilities of storytelling as a communal and mission tool amongst the emerging culture.  I'd appreciate any feedback.  The other thing I still have to get my head around is the link between local narrative and God's big narrative, but there's always tomorrow.  Thanks for all the prayers. Continue to pray for the non-christians who turned up.

        Japanese philosopher Kirtaro Nishida   said that religion is a raft that sails on the endless sea. If so, then we must be vigilant that we don't allow our preoccupation with the business on the raft to displace God's business. I like Meister Eckhart's prayer. "I pray God to rid me of god," which is a prayer to the ocean of God to rid us of the gods of the raft.

It will begin by targeting 13 to 19 year olds, with the specific thought that these young people will then bring their families and friends. This strategy should prove effective in the Hispanic/Latino communities in the United States. I'm excited for Marvin and team, and I look forward to visiting. Marvin is a pioneer in the area of breaking your high school group down into small groups - he was one of the first to do so years ago (there is a term for that, but I don't remember it).

      Hello to all! Just got back from the BGCT convention in Waco Texas and was able to witness the vote on passing the "World Missions Network". Its a definite step in the right direction for the Baptist and hopefully will help in leading the way for other large organizations to take another look at what missions can, and in many cases should look like. They are going to work to connect individuals to existing groups that would fit their calling as well as help network people together that may have similar visions for what can be. In addition to the individual, it also sounds as if they want to work along side of groups that look like The Boaz Project, among others. Groups that are out there in the big bad world doing amazing Kingdom work without the big church, mega organization budget. And the best part of all...no one has to sign the Baptist faith and message!   I'm excited to see what it will look like.    urlLink

      the music of eminem has caputerd more than the imagination of out culture.  i listen to it and it grabs most of me.  kids love it and their parents hate it won't let them listen etc and once again we push them away.  maybe its the pain, the honesty, the beat, but his music hooks me.  its narrative, its powerful and its teaching us about who we really are, hate filled and fearful. is it that a mild and invisible kid has made it so big rapping about his pain filled life, it makes me wonder if he were black would we be so concerned, it might be expected of a kid from the inner city.  not trying to incite anything just a question, does it scare us so much becuz he was so every kid growing up and any of our kids or even us for that matter could be where he is.  it is a great opportunity to talk to kids about it, i have already had several conversations about it with my two oldest boys 17 & 14, they love the music yet are concerned what it tells their peers to be and act out.  just some thoughts

       urlLink   Teen boys in my neighborhood were overly excited about the new  Eminem  movie, 8 Mile, just released. The movie has exploded. I didn't want them to see it, but then realized that they were going to see it and all of their friends were going to see it - it's the event of the month. So I spent some good time the next day asking them about the movie, deconstructing it with them. But clearly this guy has captured the collective imagination of a nation of restless youth:  urlLink  "8 Mile" opened at $50 million+ this weekend  . I'm praying for opportunities to reflect on biblical values and perspective and to share the Gospel with the many who identify Em's story.      Photo at right is of Eminem in middle school       Update: It was a bunch of little Mexican guys who were really excited about the movie. I gotta go figure that one out. Especially as the film distributors estimate that 20% of the audience was Latino.

       Unity  At the time of Jesus unity prayer in John 17, not one of his disciples had a NT bound between two pieces of leather…it would be years later when Peter, Paul and John, Mark, etc would write their epistles and gospel stories. There was no NT. Jesus wasn’t praying that all believers would unify around a position but it was a prayer and call to unify around a Person.  The Gospel is clearly delineated for us in 1 Cor 15:1-4. When Paul said, “I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel-- “ Paul was directing his thoughts at the Jewish legalist who were aggressively teaching and binding the old rituals and laws of a by gone era. This was a different gospel; it was a Jesus PLUS religion (Jesus + circumcision = salvation). Paul condemns them for such! (Gal 1:6)   Our denominational party lines (fences) have spawned more denominations than they have united. There’s an interesting passage in 1 Cor 1:10-12 where Paul encourages us “to speak the same thing” as opposed to shouting our different party slogans from across the fence. The phrase “speak the same thing” is a political term describing “unity of allegiance.” Our allegiance is not to a thought or a doctrine. These are the materials that build fences. Our allegiance should be to the Person of Jesus Christ. He’s the rally pole. He’s the One unity is built upon. It’s only right that Xians “speak the same” slogans of allegiance to Jesus alone. Jesus was crucified for all believers. He’s not divided. He is the common bond and He alone deserves our undivided allegiance. I thank God I am not saved by my logic or my hermeneutic, I am saved by Jesus’ perfect living and dying.  Have you ever noticed that when someone attempts to dismantle any section of the fence, he is either vilified or venerated?

       urlLink Research on USA church   " . . .  Americans are less likely to attend religious services than 10 years ago but that the remaining faithful are turning to conservative Protestant, Catholic and Mormon churches. Nationwide, Catholics remain the largest religious group in the country, with more than 62 million "ahderents" -- a category devised to reconcile differences in the way denominations count members. The Southern Baptist Convention is second with 19.8 million adherents, followed by the United Methodist Church, with 10.3 million; an estimated 6.1 million Jews, observant and non-observant; the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, 5.1 million; Mormons, 4.2 million; the Presbyterian Church (USA), 3.1 million; and the Assemblies of God, 2.5 million."

I dumped the archives and opened up the entire history of the site, all the way back to the first blog entry in April. You can now read the whole conversation and watch it develop. Where we're going, we dont need  . . archives!  3. I added a Google search engine.  4. I added a comments section, on the advice of  urlLink Jonny B  who got it from Paul  urlLink Prodigal  Fromont.    - Can someone please help me out. Go to comments and donate $14 to entation.co.uk - Pay Pal will not let me pay at the moment because they do not recognize Czech Republic - which means all my Pay Pal money (and I do have some) is locked up in their system and making them all rich off the interest - all because I happen to be in Prague and not Portland or Preoria. If one of you does this, all our readers will not be hit up for a donation - and I do want to keep the site commercial free. Thanks.   As you read through the site, please feel welcome to add comments and links.This way we can extend the conversation out into other countries, contexts, narratives, etc. Lets build out this site laterally as well as chronologically, or synchronically as well as diachronically (to apply Saussurean linguistitic theory)  . . .or  . . .  in other words . . .  AM I MAKING ANY SENSE?  OK . . how 'bout . . . . just go ahead and enjoy the site. Yeah!

      New York Times -  urlLink Scandal Is Stirring Lay Catholics to Push Church for More Power  "As the nation's Roman Catholic bishops prepare to meet in Washington on Nov. 11 to complete their policy on sexual abuse by priests, they are confronting the most organized and widespread challenge to their power from the laity in the church's modern history."

       Some Good books I've read lately    I've read some good books in the last month or so:  Steve Sjogren's The Perfectly Imperfect Church, Bill Hybel's Courageous Leadership, and Michael Slaughter's Unlearning Church.    I always like to read Steve Sjogren's stuff. Steve is the launching pastor of Vineyard Community Church. His efforts at " urlLink servant evangelism " and his willingness to share his ideas, have given a number of church leaders a simple way to express the love of Christ in their communities. A few years ago, when I was really having a tough time personally I heard Steve speak at a conference. His topic "Six things I learned when I almost died." I can't remember the six things right this second, but I do remember that I was impacted by the idea that we should do the tasks that God has put in front of us. For me, at that time, my ministry tasks were to be the defense attorney for the skating ministry at the Ranch, and  urlLink Next-Wave web magazine . Steve's book is refreshingly simple and practical, a must read for church planters.    One of the things I read between the lines of Bill Hybels' book is that leading a megachurch and an association of churches can do some damage to a person's psyche and family life. I guess that's why Hybels writes about "courageous" leadership, the kind that comes with a price. For a guy who's mission in life has been "to turn atheists into missionaries", he has survived the journey long enough to have some important things to say on the subject of leadership.    I first heard Michael Slaughter at a seminar on breaking the 800 barrier in church growth about ten years ago. He is an engaging speaker. At this stage of his life and ministry he has set aside the discussion of church growth barriers to address the changes that face church leaders in the light of the postmodern cultural shift. I was challenged to renew some individual spiritual practices. I was challenged to think about what church might be like 10 years down the road.     What's interesting about each of these books is the vantage point of the authors. All "successful" pastors who have done well. All who have wisdom to share about the journey for church leaders. There is a lot to learn from these writers.

      A lot going on in the world of the enchanted Kingdom so I notice. I am still a little unsettled in Montana, but more and more at home with Jesus. One of the families in our house church in Missoula, The Colbry's are in Mexico celebrating their anniversary and planting Jesus in Villages in Mexico. I am really excited about this. They are working with existing ministries to share the message and help out villagers in Mexico.   Suprisingly in a pagan dominated city of Missoula, their is an all city gathering of Churches. While it is all protestant and includes a network or family of house churches. I see a lot of growth potential for this.I plan on working with some Orthodox and Catholic Churches to help bring them into the fold.  I am excited to see it grow and work  with the existing ministries to show that us "outsiders" or house churchers aren't really on the outside. We just are a little strange and consider  ourselves aliens in a foreign city.   Been off blogging for awhile while I develop a new eministry for the folks who have left church, are leaving church, or are just looking for a safe place to leave religion behind and just cling to the Jesus of the New Testament. It's called The Journey. I will keep you all posted and you are all in my prayers.    Be God's

       urlLink  Florence   was born in Ghana, raised in London, and now lives in SunnyCalifornia. Her crew of teen girls has been studying Scripture and performing dance. Last night they did a few numbers at the  urlLink  CCDA   conference (an  urlLink  annual U.S. urban ministry event   - it's not over yet; Vinay Samuel speaks this morning). Florence hosted a Spoken Life, spoken-word type event inside the CCDA CyberCafe. The photo below is of some of the girls, post-event, checking their email at the CybeCafe. These are some of the same girls who are featured in the " urlLink  Kings Daughters in Training  " video at the Navarro Avenue Film School.       Isn't life better with a Mac?

I stumbled across this piece yesterday which is one of the most challenging:   urlLink Cyprian's Third Testimony   This piece is 120 theses describing the Christian community. Some will sound peculiar to our sensibilities, but most are pretty intense.

        Message from Wolfgang Fernandez, one of our bloggers and one of the key people behind this site on  urlLink Howler's Update   "Friends, it's been over a month since I have come here...it has been a real hard month for me and my family. I have resigned from my role in Dawn Ministries, the organization that serves the movement that I have promoted for the last 20 years. I will take a six months sabbatical. I have left Egypt (the place of refuge) and I'm now in the desert. It will be a tough time but I expect to meet God in a way that I have never known Him before. I plan to share here my journey towards my land of promise.

      Another house party worth talking about at  urlLink What is Church?  "The event was held at the Rickard's house - a cool, 60's style Florida home complete with terrazzo floors.  . .   Imagine a dim candle-lit room, Enya playing in the background, the light from the visualizations dancing off the walls, minds full of God. Remember, the context for the experience was John 6 - Jesus as the lifeblood and food - a huge feast of him. So we're sitting there and I'm imaging that this is how the disciples felt after the last supper."

      One account of the house party last week in Switzerland that we attended from Derek and Amy's  urlLink blog .  "House party in Lausanne extravagant! The mansion-the Mercy Ship Y-Wam base- surrounded by vast fields of whispering cow bells...Bryce had filmed the front of the house and was projecting it onto the house at the same angle he filmed it, creating an eerie virtual effect which you walked through and into. Into a house with many bands, VJs and DJs doing their thing in an electrically alive manner, and all the while the Presence of The Almighty hovering. Truly a blast-and we all felt like stars! Seeing Andrew's house in Prague being sampled from, and our lives being mixed as part of the international celebration of being Christ followers transnational, transdenominational, transcendant-in short, it rocked! Isn't it just good to line up in this great and funky army of The Almighty!	" A longer report is at  urlLink Tallskinnykiwi

       urlLink     Soon it will be a New Year. This year I have come along ways. I feel as if God has been getting me ready to do his work. Blogging has been a great learning tool. Reading all of what other people are going through and then learning from them and sharing what God has been doing in my life. I feel as if I have started to make some really great foundations on which to build for the future.  KingdomSpace  and all those who are on this team have been key. I especially want to thank Kevin Rains, Alan Creech, Jason Evans, Chris Smith, John O' Keefe, Chris Alford, John and Sidney Wallis, and a few unknowns for their encouragement,prayers,and wisdom. You guys are a great rag-tag bunch of God's people. I love you. And hope I have the pleasure of meeting you in person. Have a great New Year of being God's People.

      Presenting the worlds first  urlLink Inflatable Church!   Available for purchase or rent, this church can be set up on a vacant piece of land near you!         'This fantastic air filled building is 47ft long by 25ft wide & 47ft high. The attention to detail is heavenly complete with plastic "stained glass" windows, airbrush artwork which replicates the traditional church. Inside it has an inflatable organ, altar, pulpit, pews, candles and a gold cross. Even the doors are flanked by air-filled angels. The church can be built in three hours and dis-assembled in less than two'     Revolutionary stuff! A step towards incarnational mission - No longer will we expect people to have to come to us, we can just pick up and go straight to them!  Its not that different to a lot of churches I've visited over the years though....must take plenty of hot air to keep it going!  On the up side - no more long and torturous building projects!

      In the 24-7 prayer guide of operation world (see Andrews entry below) they write that 50 % of the active Christians in my country Germany are 50 years or older. In the next 30 years most of them will have moved to the other side of the line....leaving an even smaller number of Christians - unless we learn to make church relevant for people living NOW....

       Summer Jesus downunder (warning: long rant)  The Word became human being and … lived among us.  Which means that Jesus grew up a Jew, telling Jewish jokes with Jewish accents, playing Jewish sports and Jewish music and hearing Jewish stories of origins.  The word became human and … lived among us Jews.  However, 2000 years later, Jesus Jewishness seems to have been lost.  I remember vividly a Chinese man in Canton, China telling me that Jesus was a Westerner.  And so, over time, this Jewish baby has become wrapped, not in Jewish swandling cloth, but in holly and mistletoe, in snow and Santa.  The word became human and .. lived among a Northern hemisphere.    Please hear me, there’s nothing wrong with that.  In fact, that’s what the Word is meant to do.  It’s meant to dwell in the culture around it.  John Drane talks about the Word being a seed, planted, that grows in another culture.  Jesus needs to take root in Jewish soil, in American or English soil.    The danger is not that Jesus grows in Northern Hemisphere soil, but that Jesus is given to the world as the Northern Hemisphereness Word.  In reality the Christmas message asks for the Word to dwell among us,  for the seed planted in the land of the long white cloud, for God to dwell among Kiwis.  Take for instance the Church year.  The church year includes 4 weeks of Advent, leading up to Christmas.  Now, in the Northern Hemisphere, this all gets tied up with the longest night.  The earth is dark and frozen.  The body cries out for sun and for warmth.  Then just after the longest night, when the cry of light is loudest, comes the birth of Jesus.  Hope dawns.  Days start to lengthen.  Summer will come.  And so the earth’s rythms are mixed with the birth of Jesus.    If Jesus is a Northern Hemisphere Jesus, wrapped in Northern Hemisphere symbols and rythms, then it will be easy to leave Jesus behind as we head for the beach and the barby.  Downunder we celebrate Advent and Christmas in summer. Our light is long.  The days are warm and humid.  We’re all closing down for our summer holidays.  These rythym’s of earth need to get mixed up with the birth of Jesus. And so the birth of Jesus is about us in the South entering our annual Sabbath rest. It’s about God mixed with play, for on the 7th day God rested.  It’s about the full warmth and vigour of creation.  This Jesus who comes to us as God ablaze with energy and with power to renew the cosmos. This Word became human being and … needs to live among us [Kiwis].  May the Word, who became human being, truly live among us this Southern Hemisphere Christmas.

       urlLink Spencer Burke  has posted a great article on the Church at  urlLink theOOZE.com :  The present incarnation of Christ is the church. We are not alone in our struggles, nor are we the only ones walking the "labyrinth." Whether we are part of a house church or a mega church, we are ultimately part of THE church. Budgets, formulas, programs—they're incidental. If the focus of the emerging church is just three things: the inward journey, the outward journey and journeying together, we have a common, unifying bond.   urlLink [read more]

       Synergy  The anglican minister phoned yesterday.  The community I'm part of,  urlLink Graceway  have been exploring moving from a rented hall to their church as a place to develop our arts and spirituality dreams.  If you're a regular kingdom space blog reader, you'll also know that I've been having coffee with Jackie Sewell, who wants to start an arts and spirituality centre (Amaze) for teenagers.  We've been exploring the mutually benefical aromas.    The anglicans rang to suggest to us a joint lease - Jackie in the manse, Graceway in the church and are having an emergency meeting before Christmas to approve this if we want, possibly taking possession late January.  So a few months of vague dreamings over coffee could suddenly be a reality.  Graceway leadership are meeting on Friday to talk.  Graceway community are talking by email, having checked out the building a few weeks ago.  It's all happening very quickly.  Please pray that decisions made are cool for all and that all feel involved as much as they want to be.

      Hey folks - I'm baaaaccckkk! OK, enough of that. I've been, like several it seems, reading The Younger Evangelicals by Robert Webber. I tried to start reading it at the beginning but got bogged down - had to start skipping around. I've skipped to chapter 7 - Ecclesiology. Very interesting stuff. I want to put a couple of quotes here for your benefit. I think this, just because of it's basic content, a very significant book. It's actually the first book that's really dealing with what's going on in the emerging church in a holistic way. We've had others that have dealt with Postmodernism, etc. but not with the whole emerging church phenomenon.   quote one:   "The Constantinian church became so enmeshed with society that it soon served as the 'caretaker' or 'chaplain' of society. By being enmeshed with society and by offering prayer at its various functions, the church created a kind of 'civil religion' that legitimated the social order. It became the moral teacher for all citizens, calling upon them to live good, moral, and upright lives."   That may have been said before but it's still huge. He menitons too the connection later to the  liberal social action agenda  as well as the  conservative agenda in politics.  These tactics are not the answer.  He quotes John Green as saying something very key to the rising ethos of the emerging church:  "...we are made to be light in the darkness–calling people to the road less travelled, to a costly discipleship that rejects the materialism, nationalism, militarism, classism, racism, and sexism of the American culture for the cross of Christ."   I'll quote more later - good stuff. I hope a lot of people read this book and their eyes are opened.

       urlLink Bono interview with Larry King   This is from last Sunday.  KING: If there is a God, he must be angry at a lot of this.  BONO: I think God is very angry at the moment, and I think there is -- I think it's shocking what is going on in the world. And I think it is an extraordinary moment.   Right now, I can tell you this. Our age will be remembered. This moment in time will be remembered for three things: the war against terror, sure; the Internet, probably; and how we let an entire continent, Africa, burst into flames and stood around with water in cans. This is not acceptable. It is not acceptable to let people die because they can't get the drugs that you and I take for granted. That means -- you have to ask very hard questions of ourselves if we're doing that.

Here's a definition from the site:   ...a relationally-based, missionary movement dedicated to reaching contemporary culture, establishing new communities of faith devoted to one another, and creating new delivery systems for equipping, and resourcing existing churches...   They are having their first gathering of associated leaders in January. I'm sure this group will bring about some amazing things in the Kingdom. I won't be there, but I'm sure some of you will so make sure we get a report.

      Some creative ways to share your love of God, his creation and eachother. More right urlLink  here .   Sand confession:   Take a smoth tray of sand. Symbolise in it why you ache, why you are disconnected from earth, from others, from God. Ask a friend to smooth the sand and remind you that God heals and renews.   With friends:    Find some chocolate gold coins. Take a coin each. Give the coin to someone and share one thing you are celebrating. Receive the coin and listen to one thing your friend is celebrating. Eat chocolate and say the prayer of community.   "Lord, we come before you not alone, But in the company of one another We share our happiness with each other, And it becomes greater We share our troubles with each other, And they become smaller May we never be too mean to give, Nor too proud to receive For in giving and receiving, We learn to be loved We encounter the meaning of life, And discover You."

      Hi from Slovakia. I met with Marsh Moyle of  urlLink Citygate.org  yesterday, after arriving from  urlLink Vienna . He has a great training ministry for east europeans and has many papers for download on his site. Hey = the header on this site doesnt appear on this vintage computer in this mountainside cyber cafe. Is that because it is old or do we need to work the site over?

       Churchgoers as tourists?   Kiwi,  urlLink Mike Grimshaw  (Canterbury University, New Zealand), in an essay that I’m reading at the moment,   Tourist, Traveller, or Exile: Redefining the Theological Endeavour  , describes the representative of popular religious piety/praxis in terms of their being “tourists” (an expression, not necessarily used or inferred in the same way by the likes of Pete Ward, and Gerard Kelly in his interesting little book called  urlLink Humanifesto  written in the style of a travel guide). No doubt, quite a provocative way of talking about many Christians and their experience of church.  The authentic Christian experience is typically a constructed and mediated one – most commonly the Sunday morning experience! The “tourist” seeks an authentic ‘travel’ experience by a ceremonial and spiritual holiday away from the mundane concerns and claims of their everyday, real world by participating in a service of worship [implication – an experience disconnected from their ‘everyday’, ‘real’ world]…  ”As such, the clergy are primarily tour guides who weekly shepherd the tourists through a spiritual quick-stop tour, a greatest hits/snapshot/souvenir/tick-the-boxes experience that contains enough difference and content to hopefully excite, yet enough support and comfort so as not to upset.” In this the aim is not an ‘everything-included-in- the-price’, package, for that would undermine the tour operators aim of continued patronage. Rather it is deliberately incomplete with just enough to perk sufficient interest in repeat visits.   The “tourist,” as distinct from the “traveller” (orthodox theologian) and “explorer (modernist [and most likely ‘Postmodern’] theologian),” is the unthinking, religious amateur, with insufficient willingness or motivation to be anything other than one who is “guided” and has everything laid-on for them. One quite content with the superficial and the mediated; one who will not stray off the tourist bus, or beyond the most prominent sites in the tourist guide. The “tourist” is more than comfortable with “the security of pure cliché.” The tourist relies absolutely and unquestionably on the tourist guide. Theirs is the journey that “is expected to include the manageably different, the accomplishable challenge and experience that are to be found and located within a controlled and demarcated tourist zone.”  I’ve stretched his analogy a bit, but it’s been an interesting lens through which to reflect on and think about my church (in general) experiences…on what ‘church’ is, and on what ‘going to church’ is about.

       Embodied prophesy   Random thought 1  -  I grew up in a setting where prophecies are all talk.  And often talk in King James English.  I have enough trouble understanding Shakespeare let a KJV prophesy.    Then I stumbled across the Old Testament prophets.  People who use their bodies to speak of the Tomorrow.   Random thought 2  – I was moaning to Al Roxburgh (an "immigrant" who I respect immensly) about how hard church planting was, and how often other ministers don’t understand me and judge me by modernist indicators.  He shrugged and said, “what do you expect.  What you’re doing is prophetic.”    And it suddenly clicked.  If  urlLink Graceway  just is, it is prophetic.  To do nothing more than live .. to  just drink beer and loves Jesus and tells stories and runs art exhibitions … is to get heat.  Why?  Because it’s embodied prophesy.   It’s a challenge to the way others are.     urlLink Alan Hirsch  commented on his blog;  “Ours is not merely an apostolic role in establishing new ground for the Gospel and church, but must be by nature a prophetic one as well. I find this the most painful aspect of my ministry--an almost total rejection/marginalization from the established church which I am so committed to."    Again, embodied prophesy.  Tonight I pray for all my fellow embodied prophets.  We who have thrown off the KJV English.  We who by the very act of living, feel marginalized.  Long may the Spirit pulse in our veins.

        "It’s like the world’s been drinking too much coffee," Pete Greig writes in the  urlLink 24-7prayer E-bullit . "Everything seems jittery. Watching the news feels like a soap opera with too many story lines crammed into a single show. Bush and Blair are intent on disarming Iraq of weapons they can’t find while Saddam Hussein and Robert Mugabe do panto on the world stage. Osama is off somewhere hanging out Dr Evil and Elvis, terrorising the world in whispers. Meanwhile Russia can do whatever it likes to Chechnya, and North Korea is busy sending postcards of their various nuclear arms factories to world leaders who are far too busy looking for weapons of mass destruction near oil fields to read the post."  "Meanwhile a UFO cult led by a dodgy old French pop star is busy trying to  urlLink clone  their (fantastically balanced) followers whilst in the middle-east everyone continues to blow everyone else up – normally on buses. At such times it’s easy to resort to extremes – either becoming too intense or too blasé. As Christians we cannot avoid the issues just because they’re complicated, burying ourselves in the trivial pursuits of local church activity or obsessing about the latest Reality TV series as if that really was reality. Paul urges 'that requests, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for… all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives.' (1 Tim. 2) Our prayers matter at times like these, and – believe it or not – world leaders desperately need such spiritual back up."    "In the midst of so many crises I’ve been wondering why so many wives of world leaders – from Nancy Reagan and Lady Di to  urlLink Cherie Blair  – seem to resort to astrology and New Age wacko stuff. My hunch is that they know the truth about their husbands and are terrorised by the notion that world peace lies in the hands of a man who can’t remember the name of the cat and farts in his sleep. They need to believe that a higher intelligence is pulling the strings of power than the one struggling with flat-pack furniture in the garage. Well, the good news for the president’s wives is that there actually is a higher power at work, promoting and demoting their husbands. The church of Jesus Christ has been appointed to exercise authority (rather than power) in prayer and in practice. We really have been raised up ‘for such a time as this’. Even when we are surrounded by trouble, Jesus says, “Take heart! I have overcome the world." (John 16). We don’t need to rush around like Corporal Jones yelling ‘don’t panic!’ We need to pray."

        "God yes, church no." This is what most non-Christians tend to say. Or: "I want to experience God, but I don't want to be part of them" (read: the Christians). An added problem is that many Christians can't explain in normal (non-religious) language what they believe.    Realizing this, the Evangelical Broadcasting Company in Holland decided to do something they had never done before: ask a well-known non-Christian TV host (in this case Catherine Keyl, the Dutch Oprah) to make a series of six programs on  urlLink 'seeking God in the Christians' . A search for authenticity which would force Christians to come out of their cosy subculture and open up their lives and explain in normal language who Jesus is and why living as a Christian is as real and relevant as could be. The series was broadcasted around Christmas and drew a lot of response. I think it's fair to say it was one of the best programs on Christianity aired on national television.

It's time to get back to that basic message. The world has gone nuts. We could all use a little more love, faith, hope and forgiveness."

      Yes - I just looked at foneblog - looks great - our blogging engine is called bluelog and will be available soon. Jarda, who is a part of our community here and lives in our basement, is adding the final touches - like support for many languages. 2 weeks ago, Yarda took over as CEO of  urlLink ATLAS.CZ , one of the largest web portals in Czech Republic. He now has a lot more work to do, with a staff of 40 people and 2 million  subscribers - he has his work cut out for him. He will be connecting his blogging engine with his portal, but has promised that we can all use it. Now I just need to get a mms phone that will allow me to either capture images at a low resolution or reduce them small enough to use. Speaking of technology, I was thinking of roadtesting Apple's new Keynote presentation software at a conference in Switzerland next month, although I will probably use  urlLink Arkaos  VJ 2.2 which is my next step up from  urlLink G-Force , which i have used for 3 years. Anyone else using VJ software for presentation. digital storytelling or preaching?

       liquid church is finally out - published in the usa by hendrickson and paternoster in the uk. it really is a fantastic book to contribute to the reimagining of church and mission in our current context. i hope it gets a wide reading. pete uses zygmunt bauman's notion of solid and liquid modernity to speak about solid and liquid church. he does a lot of theological work to underpin a new way of speaking about church. it seems to me that this new way of speaking is essential if 'language makes the world'.  there are lots of things that i could highlight from the book but it really is the overall opening of discussion and imagining that is why this book is so welcome. to say that we need to re-imagine church or that it isn't working (for those outside it) or that it needs to change isn't news any more but there aren't many people who have offered the resources to help rethink the landscape. thanks to pete for offering us a way forward here.i fear it will be perceived as a threat by many who either have too much of a vested interest in church remaining solid or who see the invitation to engage with consumerism as selling out. change, mission and engagement with culture is always a risk but in my view it is one we have to take. pete's descriptions of three mutations that church has made in its solid form as heritage site, refuge, and nostalgic club are all too painfully visible. and the point about these is that whilst they may indeed be working as such for some people for many others they don't and they mitigate against mission. that is the whole point of why the whole thing of church needs rethinking - so many people involved in mission find the church bit the stumbling block. it's certainly true in youth ministry. pete doesn't offer any off the shelf solutions - it's more an opening up of discussion or imagination, but i hope that this does help open up new possibilites.

      been thinking lately about leadership in the church lately and how money and all that have created a problem we cant solve.  it seems the church is full of people who have been trained to do nothing but ministry.  there is nothing wrong with this yet i feel it may be one fo the causes for the church's inability or unwillingness to change traditional ministry models.  i may be way off with this but maybe its a dose of self preservation at work in all this reluctance to change.  i have been feeling lately that the whole professional staff model just doesn't work.  when all your income, identity and ego is tied up in professional ministry and there is nothing else for you to do to support yourself then there may be a fear to change anything about the system, even when you know it doesn't work.  did God ever intend for us to create a class of professionals in the church that can do nothing but ministry.  i know there are many people who don't fall in this quandary but i keep hearing some pretty lame excuses form people in the tractional system when they are confronted with a need to change, we change programs, worship styles, curriculum but ignore more basic issue like structural adjustments that need to be made.  the church needs to change or large portions of it will die in the next few decades.  but if we have created a system that so many depend on for sustenance is there any hope of it happening.    i would love to hear your thoughts about this, am i full of it?

      Last thursday evening we had our second Sapphire Training. This is a practical training for people who want to plant Jesus-groups (housechurches, simple churches and organic churches). We were with eight people, which is a nice group. After the meal we had some time to get to know eachother. This is what we did:   We took some chocolate (from Côte d’Or) with questions in the wrapping about friendship. Then we chose someone to share the chocolate with and told that person one thing we were celebrating. We listened to eachothers stories and ate the chocolate together. After everybody had shared something with another person, we gathered again as a group and said the prayer of community:     Lord, we come before you not alone, But in the company of one another We share our happiness with each other, And it becomes greater We share our troubles with each other, And they become smaller May we never be too mean to give, Nor too proud to receive For in giving and receiving, We learn to be loved We encounter the meaning of life, And discover You.   (From: Be our Freedom, by: Terry Falla)  This is a really nice practise to make friends or to celebrate excisting friendships. Feel free to try it yourself. You can let me know what happened  urlLink here .

      Gordon MacDonald made an interessting remark. He said that in Germany in the 1930s many pious, bible believing Christians trusted Hitler because they had heard the rumor that he - like them - was reading the moravian paroles (a kind of daily scripture reading very popular to this day). When he started doing things that were not in line with scripture they did not dare to critzize him ("He must be a pious man if he reads the paroles") but said: "Well probably he has access to information that is not available for us therefore he is doing things we simply cannot understand). MacDonalds conclusion: "NO political leader - no matter how much we may sympathize with him  must be permitted to do whatever he wants, without us questioning him, simpy because he seems to be inclined towards our beliefs."

      i was just putting aubrey to bed and got a glimpse of the fathers love. at one month (and a couple of days) she is tiny, only vaguely aware of what is going on around her and i only really hear from her when she's dirty, hungry, bored or needs someting. every now and then she'll smile or act like she knows who i am or something.  that's kind of how i am with god. the only time i really talk to him is if i have made a mess or need something. sometimes, if things are really good i'll give him a nod.   but i found myself whispering in aubreys ear "I love you soooo much" and knowing that is what the heavenly father is saying to me. "Jason, I love you sooo muuch."   no strings attatched.  i wish i heard from you more but i'll take every second i can get and my heart will swell when i do hear from you.

       when the church sucks the life out of ministry...   i received an email back from a young lady that for the past 2 years (first 2 years in college) ran a downtown homeless ministry on her own. she visited our church sometimes, and many of our people ministered with her from time to time. i emailed her to get the details for the new semester, and here's the reply:   Hey Aaron,   I am sorry to say that no, I am not doing the homeless ministry any more... I am involved with my church now, so my time for activites is limited . If you do have anyone interested in starting up a ministry, I have a bagillion New Testaments at my house that they are welcome to have. Downtown Phoenix is an awesome place to minister, I miss the guys down there. They were really cool...     i feel deflated that a church would busy a revolutionary to the point they give up their passion, and ministry...

      "Turn around, for the Kingdom is about to come". Everywhere - in micro- and macrocosm - the Kingdom calls and motivates us to turn around; to think differently, to accept paradigm shifts.

       Prayer   Bombs started landing on Bagdad about 2:30 pm New Zealand time yesterday. A quick ring around and a  urlLink group  of us gathered publically in the local village square after work (7 pm). We had pre-prepared a short service. We laid out some candles and used chalk to write on the pavement an explanation of what we were doing. We read Scripture, thought about children, lit candles, prayed the Lords Prayer.   It was nice to be public with our faith. A number of bystanders joined us, thanked us or lit candles and moved on. It was beautifully peaceful, with the fountain splashing and candles glowing.   We'll do the same again tonight.

        Who could ever have this stupid idea that God is a man-made reflection of our desires and ideas? Feuerbach did not know the living God who is ever so often different from what you want him to be... An excellent article in German "Do not let God go", based on Jacob´s struggle with the Almighty (ending up in a painful injury) by my old friend Jens Kaldewey spoke to me directly. Right now, it´s not so much the success stories that mean something to me but the struggle of the great Saints with their God; like Theresa of Avila who said "God, if that is the way you treat your friends, no wonder you have so few". Undoubtedly, the mistake is always on our side. But God is not an easy partner. No wonder - He is God! Maybe there are some of you out there reading this blogspot who are secretly dissapointed by God or by what they thought was God. Tell him your pain, struggle with him - but stick to him!

       Conflicting Leadership Styles  Consider this paradox  ...Faith communities lead by ministers who are "pastoral types" generally don't grow, but you can't grow unless you care for people. (Crop rotation doesn't count as growth) If a community becomes a spiritual hospital, focused primarily on bandaging wounds--it tends not to develop the muscular faith necessary to engage the postmodern world. I wonder--are pastoral care and visionary leadership incompatible?   Comment & Question:  I authored a blog titled  "Grace A wakening"  I discontiunued that blog at the end of 2002. I am ready to begin blogging again...but I need someone to help me design a cool looking blog...anyone have a contact for me?

      Marc, the nice guy from Joel News wrote about what is happening in Berlin:   JN438-2. PRAYER FOCUS: 50 days of prayer for Berlin   From Easter to Pentecost the Berlin city network 'Together for Berlin' is calling the church to prayer for their city. A booklet has been produced in German and English to provide specific prayer information.   Let's pray that the '50 days' will fan the spirit of prayer in Berlin and elsewhere, that people will be ignited with new love for their city, and that churches of all sorts would be motivated to join in.  Coordinator Kerstin Hack writes: "In German there is a saying 'Not allowing anybody to steal the butter from your slice of bread' - meaning 'Not allowing anybody to take from you what is rightfully yours'. More and more Christians in Berlin are fed up with the enemy having stolen so much 'butter' right from under our eyes and we are more and more motivated to start a godly revolution against this. We are grateful for all the support we get in this endeavour from other cities and places. Thanks for joining hands with us!"  Get the booklet and join in. The English version is for free (download).   urlLink English version for Download   If you want the German verison in Print mail to shop@down-to-earth.de (it costs 3 Euro + postage) and is really nice (if you understand German).  Here in Berlin we are really excited about all the encouragement we get from outside of Berlin (Germany and the World!) - joining hands and prayers with us to make Berlin a God place.

      To understand the present it is good to look at history. Right now I am reading  urlLink The secret of their strength  - which can be downloaded. A book about a movement of people during the time of the reformation who lived as communities of believers, shared their lives, faith and possession, took the words of Jesus seriously, believed in the Holy Spirit to dwell in them and guide them. A movement that grew like wildfire with thousands of people deciding to follow Christ in the course of a few months and years.  For the crime of following Christ, but not accepting the established church as "supreme authority" they were killed by the sword, fire (burning them on a stack), drowned, shot, driven into houses that were then set aflame....thousands of our brothers and sisters. I did not know this. History told me that "some bad catholics" persecuted the "good protestants", but no one told me that "the good protestants" also turned around and killed their brothers and sisters in Christ.  Apart from some gruelsome details (have your tissues or vomiting bags close at hand) it is fascinating reading how they lived and built their communities, followed Christ in their daily lives, understood the Bible (they dared to try to follow the commands of Jesus)...they were true revolutionaries. Men and women to be admired - and followed.

      Hi everyone. We just moved this site back to its original address. The conversation we had last year was a great one. Then it stopped. We need to start another- I am open to suggestions. How do we want to use this site? At present, it is the largest, longest running international Christian blog site. But still, if we all dont need it, I would be happy to kill it and start something else. I was hoping that more developing countries would be involved but that has not happened. Lets see if we can extend the technology to them as well as an invitation. In the meantime, this is your site.What do you want to do with it? oh yeah - I put a comments link on the site.

      Thought a lot about the whole issue of church and social action recently.  And discovered a great book (a friend sent it to me as a gift - friends are great) and read it in one go.   urlLink Bart Pierce: Seeking your brother. Restoring compassionate Christiantiy to the church.     A fascinating book, describing how one church is aiming to reach out to their community. "If you will take care of the ones nobody wants, I will give you the ones everybody is after" was a word God spoke to the pastor Bart Pierce, himself a drug addict.  And he acted on it.  He describes not only the various way the church is reaching out to the poor, destitute and needy in Baltimore where they are located and gives practical advice on how to go about. But he also shows that passion for god and compassion for men are just the two sides of the coins of love. Their church is an example of both: They experience long, deep intimate times of sensing the presence of God and being close to Him. And they reach out in compassion to their city in a meaningful practical way: Serving single moms, streetsleepers, hungy people and changing whole blocks - one at a time.  The church has often split the two aspects of serving Jesus. Some churches focus on the "Martha" aspect of caring for  the "human" Jesus by caring for people. Other focus on the "Mary" aspect of ministering to the "divine" Jesus by ministering to him in worship, adoration and contemplation.  However we need both "Mary and Martha" for the church to be a place where Jesus and people are welcome.  The book is encouraging, practical and most needed in this time of increasing spiritual and practical need. I highly recommed it to anyone hungry for wholesome Christianity.

      Some spotlights from the Gathering of the Lutheran and Catholic Churches in Germany:  - One newspaper headline about the Kirchentag (Church gathering) read: "Germans want one [unified] church." We also wanted one unified nations - but now 10 years after the wall came down are still in the process of learning to accept, understand and love the members of the "other" Germany....that had been separated from one another for 40 years. How can unity and understanding work in the "nation of the church" after 500 years of separation?  - I asked a pastor what characterized the spiritual power of the Waldense Christians that survived persecution, inquisition and all the rest of it. He simply said: "Their live. They took the sermon of the mount litearal!"   - Talked with one member of the  urlLink  Normal Generation band  a christian band popular in Germany, about Christians and artists. He said that most christian (music) artist find it hard to see that anything that is not explicitly worship music can be art, too. We spoke about the fact How God enjoys to be worshipped by beauty and general expression of mankind even if it does not have an explicit christian label on it. He recommende I read  urlLink Imagine. A vision for Christians in the Art , in his opinion the one book he would give to every Christian artist in Germany if he had money.... .

      When I talked to people about the  urlLink Transformation Videos  which are a documentation of how God is changing whole communities through a praying, unified and responsible church, people asked me again and again:  "Who is the preacher on the video?"  It made me sad to realize how often we have exchanged the dynamics of the kingdom of God, transforming societies, people groups and nation (the salt of the earth) to mere preaching. What a pity. For all of those who are sitting through thousands of boring sermons through their lifetimes and missing the experience of God working through them to transform their world. And a pity for all of those who never get a chance to see the kingdom of God first hand because the christians are busy listening to sermons. What a pity!!!

      Most of you probably read about Nullsoft's Waste that was online just a couple of hours and then pulled.  It is a p2p file sharing product that is for a closed network.  I don't know if any of you got it but it would be an amazing tool to share worship media and resources with over a closed group of people (Waste limited itself to 50 users).  Just an idea.

      As I expand the list of blogs I try to keep up with, the need to automate the process of "which blogs have changed since the last time I read them" has become greater and greatter.   The solution for this is something called RSS, which is a way for content providers to provide an index to their content.   I run a program which scans the RSS feeds for all the blogs I have subscribed to, and I get a list of the posts which are new since the last time I looked.  Right now, 5 out of the 21 blogs I follow have RSS feeds.   Calling all bloggers, please please please check with your blog software to figure out how to generate an RSS feed.  I am currently using  urlLink TypePad  for my  urlLink faith-rambling blog , which is a subscription service and it provides an RSS feed for everyone.  I understand that currently blogger/blogspot only provide RSS feeds for the "Pro" level blogs.  I don't know about any other blog services.   For Mac users, the software I am using to both read AND post to all my blogs is  urlLink NetNewsWire .  Sorry, don't know what PC users are doing.

       I just read a very interesting techincal paper.  It was about extending the Java programming language, and as a way of making his point, the author of the paper decided to only use words of one syllable, and then to allow himself to define words of more than one syllable in the course of the paper.   If you have PDF reader, and you can deal with a technical discussion of programming languages, you can  urlLink read the paper , but for this blog, the thing which was so interesting to me was the last part, where the author reflects on the process of writing the paper.     ...    I would like to tell you what I have learned from the task of designing this talk. In choosing to give up the many long words that I have come to know since I was a child, words that have many fine shades of meaning, I made this task much harder than it needed to be. I hope that you have not found it too hard on your ears. But I found that sticking to this rule made me think. I had to take time to think through how to phrase each thought. And there was this choice for each new word: is it worth the work to define it, or should I just stick with the words I have? Should I do the work of defining a new word such as mirror, or should I just say “looking glass” each time I want to speak of one? (As an example, I was tempted more than once to state the “ly” rule for making new words that change what verbs mean, but in the end I chose to cast all such words to one side and make do. And I came that close to defining the word without, but each time, for better or for worse, I found some other way to phrase my thought.)   I learned in my youth, from the books of such great teachers of writing as  Strunk and White , that it is better to choose short words when I can. I should not choose long, hard words just to make other persons think that I know a lot. I should try to make my thoughts clear; if they are clear and right, then other persons can judge my work as it ought to be judged.   From the work of planning this talk, in which I have tried to go with this rule much more far than in the past, I found that for the most part they were right. Short words work well, if I choose them well.   Thus I think that programming languages need to be more like the languages we speak—but it might be good, too, if we were to use the languages we speak more in the way that we now use programming languages. All in all, I think it might be a good thing if those who rule our lives—those in high places who do the work of state, those who judge what we do, and most of all those who make the laws—were made to define their terms and to say all else that they say in words of one syllable. For I have found that this mode of speech makes it hard to hedge. It takes work, and great care, and some skill, to find just the right way to say what you want to say, but in the end you seem to have no choice but to talk straight. If you do not veer wide of the truth, you are forced to hit it dead on.   I urge you, too, to give it a try.    From "Growing a Language", by Guy L. Steele Jr.

       Prophetic flashmobs and other stuff     Last week I joined a prayer event in Llanelli that could best be described as 'prophetic  urlLink flashmobbing '. Flashmobs are sudden gatherings of people at a predetermined location at a predetermined time, who basically do something wild and creative together, and then continue their journey. A sort of postmodern version of a Blitzkrieg. Heidi Plympton from England took the initiative - she sensed God was saying to her to do a prophetic prayer and worship tour on three 'hights': Llanelli in Wales, and Glastonbury and Salesbury in England. A small core group prayed into this and gave a 'trumpet call' in their network. Whoever felt led to come, joined in and brought whatever God told them to bring. Some fifty people showed up. It was an experiment with a refreshing freedom in the Holy Spirit in which a special prophetic-creative synergy developed. Not something to talk about, but something to experience.

      I just got home from a cool lunch meeting.  It was with Dan - my local denom guy - and Paul Kaak of  urlLink CMA .  We were talking about the possibility of doing a CMA Greenhouse in SoCal some time next year.  I know it's been done before in our area, but we may make another run at it.  I've known about Paul through  urlLink Jason ,  urlLink Kevin , and some others.  Cool dude with some good insights about the Kingdom.  I really like the way he has a passion for an organic expression of the Kingdom of God, but isn't antagonistic toward the traditional/institutional approach to church.  He's well balanced and has a good heart.  He clearly cares about following Jesus with integrity and encouraging others to do the same.  After lunch, I had coffee with Dan and talked about some stuff in our local association of churches.  In particular, he told me about some possibilities that are only just dreams at this point, but if they were to develop . . . spine tingling ministry stuff could happen.  I almost don't even want to think about it because there's so much potential there, and yet so much potential for it to get really screwed up.  I need to breathe a little before I think about it any more.

Experts said the figures based on a sample of 8,561 households across the country are the most comprehensive to date.

      Some unfriendly people in Germany have written some very unfriendly stuff about me. That´s okay. People are free to say what they want. The problem is, that that their homepage is quite popular, so it is high up in Google. Whenever someone types in my name at google their bad stuff about me turns up on page one of the search. So anyone looking for me first gets to read that junk about me! YIKES.   Can you help me kick them out?   The best way would be to ask all of your friends to make a link on their homepages to one of my homepages. That should get my own pages higher in Google and should be enough to kick them out of the first page of the google search! (providing you really have a number of nice friends...)  The Link could be to any (or even better all !!!) of my pages:  http://kerstinpur.blogspot.com [my German personal blog]  http://berlinrocks.blogspot.com [Stories about God and Berlin and both] http://www.downtoearth.de [My internet shop for stuff on transformation of cities and people]  THANK YOU (and your friends!)

       urlLink via Religion News Blog  Islam will be the most widely practised religion in the UK by 2020, according to British and Muslim magazine editor Sarah Joseph. She says mosque attendance is expected to outstrip church attendance over the next 16 years. Estimates suggest that anywhere between 10,000 and 50,000 people a year convert to Islam in the UK, which is currently home to approximately 1.8 million Muslims. "We are the second largest faith in Britain and will be the largest practising faith in Britain by 2020 if you use church and mosque attendance as a measure," she told the GDN. Sarah Joseph does have a stake in saying such things but it is an interesting comment.  Islam is growing very fast in the west and will continue to have more and more of an influence.

      Hi everyone, this is Andrew. I want to thank everyone for contributing to this discussion over the past (almost) two years. This blog will be winding down and will pop up on another blog system (Typepad) that will enable us to do some new things and do all things better. The theme will continue to be what God is doing around the world. I will try to get more non-Western bloggers to be involved this time- something that I had tried to do but never succeeded. The conversation level will also be upgraded to an in-depth discussion of missiology in the global emerging culture. I will be sending out invitations shortly, and if you would like to be one of the bloggers who contributes to this conversation, then please email me tallskinnykiwi at hotmail.com The name may stay the same (or you could suggest a new name) but the address will change - i will put a link here when we have it. Sometime this month. Thanks everyone.  Andrew Jones

      From the  urlLink New York Times  Microfinance is a long way from the world of venture capital where Mr. Khosla, a partner at Kleiner Perkins Caulfield & Byers, a venture capital business, and a co-founder of Sun Microsystems, has earned a formidable reputation as the man with the Midas touch. But in February he said he would start working part time at his company to spend more time with his family and on his passion: supporting microcredit initiatives for impoverished regions. The Share program, or Society for Helping and Awakening Rural Poor Through Education, was founded in 1991 by M. Udaia Kumar, who had been involved in providing training programs to poor rural entrepreneurs. The program has reached 300,000 needy families with loans totaling $75 million.  It goes on with this An estimated 3,000 microfinance initiatives serve the world's poor but a scarcity of money has limited their expansion. More than 70 percent of them serve fewer than 2,500 borrowers each. Only 30 microfinance initiatives have grown to serve more than 100,000 poor borrowers. One of them, the pioneering Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, reaches more than three million borrowers. A total of $4 billion has been disbursed since Grameen started making loans in 1976 with seed loans starting as small as $35. The majority of the microfinance initiatives struggle to find grant financing and to stay in business. The money they do receive is often in small grants of $5,000 to $50,000. The ventures are typically viewed as risky propositions for loans from commercial banks. But advocates hope Mr. Khosla's evangelism for the initiatives will help them increase support from mainstream institutions. Some microfinance projects are tapping into commercial financial institutions. In India, the Grameen Foundation is starting a company called Grameen Capital India in partnership with Citigroup and India's leading ICICI Bank to help microfinance initiatives get guarantees for financing. And business leaders and entrepreneurs are increasingly seeking to support microfinance organizations because of their financial soundness and broad social impact, said Julie Stahl, program officer of the Grameen Foundation USA. "We are seeing a groundswell of support coming from leaders in the high-tech and venture capital worlds," Ms. Stahl said. Bob Gay, managing director of Bain Capital; Mike Murray, a former vice president at Microsoft; Rob Glaser, founder of RealNetworks; and Craig McCaw, a pioneer in the wireless industry, for example, have all been involved with microfinance projects. It was heartening, Mr. Khosla said, to see that the entrepreneurial principles of Silicon Valley applied just as well in rural India and Bangladesh. "Granted, they are not as profitable as Google, but they have the same level of social impact."

      andrew - it's good to see posting :)  i have tried over the past, but life seems to be getting in the way - but i am back - as you are back - as we are all back :) (just could not do a "you and me" thing - needed to bring the whole community in) - i will, as i have promised on other blogs, to be active - proactive and not reactive :)   i think it would be a great idea to expand the global voice to others - i love hearing the voices of people all over the place - i have been feeling a touch in my heart to head overseas - just trying to figure out where God is telling me to head - ireland? england? australia?  only God knows, and right now it's a secret :)   pax

      one day jesus took his disciples up the mountain and gathered them around him. as they gathered he looked at each and everyone of them with a smile on his face. he then turned to them and started to teach them by saying:   "blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. blessed are the meek. blessed are those who mourn. blessed are the merciful. blessed are those who thirst for justice. blessed are you when you are persecuted. blessed are you when you suffer. be glad and rejoice for your reward is great in heaven."   as jesus was speaking the disciples started to talk among themselves;  peter looked around and asked, "are we supposed to know this?"  andrew, looking puzzled, said, "do we have to write this down?"  james, franticly looking for something to write with whined, "will we have this on a test?"  philip, pushing james aside said, "i have no paper."  bartholomew, with a tear in his eye said, "do we have to turn this in?"  while john complained, "the other disciples didn't have to learn this."  matthew, looking up at jesus said, "could you go over this again?  judas, shaking his head said, "what does this have to do with real life?"   just then one of the local pharisees asked to see jesus' lesson plan. he wanted to know the scripture used, and quoted and he also desired to know the hermeneutics used to structure the lesson. he inquired of Jesus, "where is your anticipatory set and your objectives in the cognitive domain?"   Then, Jesus wept.

      I checked out my other neglected  urlLink blog , and decided to change my template. After doing that I started checking out the other blogs that I have been neglecting to look at for quite some time. Lo and behold, I check out a kingdom space and what do I see? It is the exact same template that I picked for my blog. Well, to save embarrassment, I quickly changed my template. I was looking at the pink one with the Barbie head, but thought different when I thought of explaining the whole story to my kids. (Just doing this is wearing me out. I'm weak....)   I have been making failed attempts to get into blogging on a regular basis. My last post anywhere was in March! Before that it has been touch and go.   I am at a transition in my life. My father passed away in November, I have been feeling the push of God to move into  pastoral counseling (the call that I have been ignoring until recently) and find myself reevaluating my priorities. I am sure of one thing..God has yet again picked a fool to do something. I would like to sit back and watch it unfold, but He won't let me.   I leave with 2 things.  1. Check out my blog...(please)Leave comments/criticisms etc.. 2. As the "emerging" church are we becoming more missional? And if we are, do we then become submergent?  urlLink Chuck

      I had a brain burp.    Are we  (really)  converted  to Jesus. Consider this angle...   In the Middle Ages the everyday language reflected the Christian life. The world was permeated with transcendence reminders; the sound of church bells, the music, the literature, architecture, everyday language and expressions ("God be with you", upon my soul," etc.). All these reflected the central elements of a story much larger than our own story. It wasn't football season it is was Advent season. Western culture no longer has the same worldview.   We've lost the larger story of mystery and transcendence. It didn't happen overnight but through the centuries. The Enlightment dismissed the idea that there was an Author. Western world rejected the mystery and transcendence of the Middle Ages. Mystery and transcendence was replaced with man's confidence in science, progress, and pragmatism (the Age of Reason). In the era of postmodernism we've been left with our smaller stories. It's not Pentecost; it's time for spring training. Our lives now revolve around the smaller stories of politics, little league baseball, soap operas, and rap music? Our best expression today is not, "God be with you," but, "Have a good day." The only story beyond our own is the evening news; which make no sense outside the context of the larger story. They are simply arbitrary collections of scenes and images, which lack a bigger picture to fit in.    Because we live within the framework of this western worldview we all, to one extent or another, become convinced that who we are is inextricably tied to our own self-redemptive story. Becoming a Christian doesn't alter a lifetime of western world influences and images, nor does sitting in a church building or a house church. Unconsciously, we live our daily lives within the context of our smaller story attempting to manipulate life’s circumstances and surroundings eager to make our existence a more palatable one with a secondary hope that maybe the One who can spin the earth and resurrect the dead will show up and rescue us from life’s pain.   Coming to know Jesus means we detach our hearts from every competing smaller story. It’s today’s Christians only hope of moving the human existence of our smaller story into the context of the bigger story; where a purposeful adventure (called the Christian life) is lived. Only in the bigger story does pain and suffering make sense. Only when our stories become a part of the larger story will a grassroot movement rise to the task of turning their comunities (and the world) upside down.   It's a little unnerving (for me) to think that a movement naturally flows from the bottom up. Not sure if that's a commentary on my faith (probably is).   I am praying for God to disrupt and unnerve us.

      "Surely we need theologians with humility and imagination, and poets with the discipline and intellectual integrity of scholars."   I like the way you phrased this  :)   Those of us who are gifted as stewards of faith communities in particular need to live out of both the head and the heart. This isn't an easy thing to do...  "What is a theologian supposed to do these days?"  You know, reading these posts I recognize the ambiguity of my own calling, really.. my ambiguous relationship to myself. I tend not to trust my left brain dominance, but in my insecurity I sometimes live out of that place. I've wondered whether my own journey on the road to wholeness will empower me to greater faithfulness, or whether greater faithfulness is really rooted in stronger connections.. a more faithful community. In other words, perhaps my own completion is more bound up with a local expression of the body. Perhaps the complementarity and wholeness that is really necessary for any local church is just that.. a corporate wholeness. "If all were an eye.."  If all were left brained or right brained, if all were head or heart.. if all were poets, or theologians.. We really do need one another, our strengths and our weaknesses, but we all tend, as john pointed out, to think "that is the true bug" or "this is the true bug." Its tough for the left brained people to really value the more process intuitive, more process oriented left brained ones. But until we walk in that kind of love and mutual honoring, I wonder if there is really hope for change..  "Is it the role of the theologians to keep us rooted in the Big Story while the poets shape 'new stories in faithful missional communities'?"  Maybe .. but I suspect its the role of all us to stay rooted, and shape those stories together as we live in the life of Jesus day by day. "To be a member is to have neither life, being, nor movement, except through the spirit of the body, and for the body."  Pascal

      There have been some great posts on this subject of theologians and poets. I tend to think that theologians have gotten it backward. The church does not serve theology. Theology serves the church. I think the modern church did buy into the idea that it has to serve its theology and those statements were the distinctives of Christian faith. The fact is, faith is not merely a statement but a relationship. Knowing God is not just knowing about God. It is knowing God relationally. I think those statements are essential at a base level to get to know God just as it is important in my relationships with other to people to know something about them. But I could never say I really know someone if all I know about them are facts. I need to experience relationship with the other person to really know them. Theologians need to be followers of Jesus in a real and living, incarnational, way before they begin to work out their theology. Their lives in the community of faith and in relationship with God is what should shape their theology. The church is not a piece of stone that the theologian chisels away at to make it into something. The church is a living organism that should shape our theology tempered by the ways in which God speaks to us through his Spirit and the word. So I do think there is a definate need to have a working theology that does give us an orientation to what we believe and why as  Andrew said, but I think this theology should lead to practice and even be shaped by it.

       the church must put itself at risk by going out into the world.    This very evening, at a church-wide dinner, I heard the statement "we live in uncertain times."  Much like we have heard "we are at a cross roads" or "this is a defining moment".  We have heard all these before, from politicians, pagans, pastors and peasants.  Economies, conflicts and ideologies create tensions in the present and fear for the future.  Truth be told, we live in the most certain of times.  And have for over 2000 years. We know what the future holds.  We know what is required of us, individually and corporately as the board of belivers (local and universal).  I thank Andrew for his response and the concept of the church taking risk.  Wish I had come to that conclusion as clearly as he did.  And I beleive that to be the role of the theologian in these times (certain as they are)...relate the relevance of Christ through the simplicity of the Gospel.  Help us bridge the division within the institutional church by reducing the complexity we have created for denominational or control reasons.

      I'm thinking we still have a skewed view of what it means to be a theologian. Does it mean that we are ivory-tower dwellers who are not practitioners? It may have degraded to such a thing, but I think it is just that - a degradation. I don't believe there is such a thing as a non practicing theologian in scripture. We have those who are living the life - living out the call of building the Kingdom, in the community as well as outside. But they are teachers, thinkers, contemplatives, those who work out problems and have the gift of helping to disseminate the solutions to their siblings.  I'm not sure about the poets instead of thing. I'm not sure the two are mutually exclusive - poets and theologians - perhaps we have some hybrids about. I think theology is important. It's important for us to know what we believe and why - to know the underworkings and not merely the surface of our faith. Real theologians help us all with this. They are not what we have made them to be. That might not be too bad but it's not nearly as useful as what I've been referring to.

      Len wrote: 'Ultimately, we may need poets more than we need theologians... we need people who are rooted in the Big Story, inwardly transformed by the Spirit of God, and shaping new stories in faithful missional communities.'  I like that. But still, where has the Big Story come from? Who told it to us? Did they get it right? Can we really trust them? Or do we imagine that we can simply go back to the source and read it with undistorted vision? Maybe, but I think it's very difficult to escape the voices in our heads saying, This is what it means, or That is what it means.  My feeling is that we could  understand  things a lot better than we do. The product of that understanding would not be a new dogmatism; it would have the vitality and relevance and interdependence of a conversation or a story-telling or a weblog. But there is a danger that postmodern Christians will become as unthinking and complacent about their Big Story as modern Christians are about their statements of faith. Surely we need theologians with humility and imagination, and poets with the discipline and intellectual integrity of scholars. Or is it simply that we need both?  So this is my question: What is a theologian supposed to do these days? Is it the role of the theologians to keep us rooted in the Big Story while the poets shape 'new stories in faithful missional communities'?

      [11/23/2002 11:35:12 PM | john o'keefe] i will admit that i posted this on "ginkworld: inside the mind of punk monkey" first - but i needed to post it here also - it just fit.  "there i was, sitting high on the top limbs of a tree looking down on the world wondering where i would travel next. as i was looking over the trees, i noticed in a clearing two bugs walking and fight with each other over who was a true bug. the first bug said, "i have six legs and three body parts, and that is what makes a true bug." the other simply looked and replied, "how silly. i have six legs and three body parts also, that does not make you a true bug - i have antenna, and as every living thing should know - antenna are what makes a true bug." the first bug thought for a second and answered, "i do have antenna, but not only two. mine are hair like antenna all over my body, so that must be a true sign of a true bug." the second simply shock his head with disbelief, "how could you be so silly? that is not the true sign of a true bug." but, just before the second bug could continue a large bird came swooping out of the sky and eat both bugs. as it stood there i asked, "why did you eat those creature?" the bird replied, "they were bugs." then i added, "but they were arguing over which was a true bug. neither thought the other was a true bug." to which the bird replied, "it doesn't matter much what they thought, they were bugs and they both tasted like a bug." and with that the bird flew away."  pax  john

      One of the newer missional networks does a good job of distinguishing between mere doctrinal correctness or even doctrinal allegiance and incarnating the gospel faithfully in our current cultural context..  "We are not focused on doctrinal uniformity. While acknowledging the indispensable importance of doctrine, it is our conviction that poor doctrine—conceived of in the typical systematic sense—is not our chief challenge. Our chief challenge is to rediscover the simple, but profound story lines that Scripture contains. Creation, fall, redemption, and future hope are dramatic narratives that we can apply to all areas of life. No one lives from a set of abstract theological propositions, especially when they have been torn from their context of an ongoing Story. We actually live from a sense of Story that shapes our imagination. As Christians, we seek to let the biblical Story shape our imagination. We don't have to write it again, but we have to be faithful actors who enter into the story and make it a lived reality. Or, in the image Paul uses, we are now in the position of young architects discovering a wonderful foundation already laid by a master architect. We have to creatively work out what sort of building was intended and faithfully build upon that foundation. In our journey toward discovering ever-growing clarity of biblical truth, we do not claim to know everything. Our desire and heart is to walk in humility and to invite others to journey with us as we press forward toward the fullness of truth, toward the day when we shall know Christ as we have been known."  Ultimately, we may need poets more than we need theologians.. we need people who are rooted in the Big Story, inwardly transformed by the Spirit of God, and shaping new stories in faithful missional communities.

      "the church must put itself at risk by going out into the world."  YES!  Oswald Chambers wrote that we are to be broken bread and poured out wine for the world. I don't think he meant that only individually.. after all, Christ is a body.  Jean Vanier writes that security is the greatest danger.  "But when a community has enough members to do all the work, when it has enough material goods, it can relax. It has strong structures. It is fairly secure. It is then that there is danger."  Community and Growth  Our wealth and security are killing us; these idols have almost prevailed in my generation.

      I agree with Jody's point about the seige mentality of the institutional church, and the need to work both inside and outside the sanctuary - if I followed the argument correctly. But I'm inclined to play the part of the pedant and dispute the reading of Matt.16:18 ('upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hades will not [prevail against  or  withstand] it').  1. “Gates of Hades ( pulai hadou )” looks to me like a semitic idiom for death or proximity to death. For example: ‘…[the Jewish martyrs] cried out in a very loud voice, imploring the Ruler over every power to manifest himself and be merciful to them, as they stood now at the gates of death’ ( pulais hadou )’ (3 Macc.5:51; cf. 3 Macc.6:31; Job 38:17; Ps.9:13; 107:18; Is.38:10; Wisd.16:13; Odes 11:10; Ps. Sol.16:2).  2. I think that  katischuô  with the genitive must have a dynamic sense: ie. 'prevail against' or 'overcome' rather than withstand (cf. Jer.15:18 in the Septuagint).  Jesus is saying, therefore, that the 'gates of hades will not overcome the church'. But his point is not that the church must be always on the defensive. I think what he is saying is that as the disciples undertake a mission that will bring them into conflict with hostile political and spiritual forces, that will put their lives at risk (cf. 24-27), they can be reassured that nothing, not even death, will ultimately overcome the community that is based on the confession of Jesus as the Christ. The statement is important, therefore, precisely because the church  must put itself at risk by going out into the world . So maybe we're back where we started but by a slightly different route.  (If this sort of comment is out of line in a postmodern theology discussion, tell me, and I won't do it again.)

       A few weeks ago  I asked the congregation if there were any ministers in the audience. To the credit of one gal, who was cogzinant of my question and the biblical teaching, she slowly raised her hand (half way). Soon all the others sitting next to her raised their hands. Later I was told the one gal who raised her hand first told the others,  "...hey, this is a trick question."   The other two hundred assembled that day didn't raise their hand. That's significant.   If the Xians assembled in the catacombs in first century were asked the same question what they would do? Would they look around for their "Minister" or would they all raise their hands without giving the question a second thought?   I've decided that the primary problem among Xians today is not apathy, although there may be plenty of that, but institutional forms that have usurped the "priesthood of all believers" to the point that Xians don't even know the teaching, much less practice it! No wonder we don't understand  ** "road stories."   **** In the last half of Luke’s story and throughout the book of Acts we encounter a series of “road stories.” Everyone is going somewhere: Jesus on the Emmaus, Philip on the road to Gaza, Peter on the road to Cornelius, Paul on the road to Damascus. These road stories beg an answer to the question; where is everyone going? The answer is they are moving away from their spiritual center, Jerusalem, and out into the world.

      It's all in the verb.  Regarding the church: "The gates of hell shall not prevail against it." We have grown up with the idea of the church as fortress and should the very gates of hades lay siege against these stained-glass walls...those gates shall not overcome the bastion.  They shall not prevail!  Once they arrive, they will come no further.  How the heck do gates prevail?  The verb colors the understanding of the idea.  Gates aren't mobile and hell isn't marching in to barricade the church...rather, the concept is of the Kingdom growing and expanding until it will overcome the gates!  The verb we misunderstand gives rise to the church as a human institution...once in place, it is here to stay and to be maintained in like manner: static.  Once an institution becomes self-aware, the mission changes from one of substance over form to self-preservation and status quo.  Leadership, real or self-appointed, can manage from this standpoint much more easily.  We will not be prevailed against or upon.  When believers start to ask questions or worse, compare the institution to what the church of Acts was about, they find themselves as written earlier, beating their heads against the wall.  Been there, done that, plaster in my scalp as a reminder.  Maybe it isn't, "Father, why are you doing this to me and leaving me here?" but "Father, what are you trying to teach me that my ego, pride and intellect are blocking?"  Those lessons are probably what the Father's true intent for the community of faith, how we should be truly living in the community and how we build the kingdom one relationship at a time.  I appreciate the concept of sanctuary and until our westernized isolationist view of restricted hospitality is refined to serve the community as it once did, the church will ned to be sanctuary to both believer and pagan...knowing my church isn't a very open place to the lost.  Perhaps an openess there will result in a greater openess outside the facility with our homes and lives.  The great struggle will be to maintain faith, fellowship and unity inside the established church with a small group committed to being the church and trying to do kingdom work along side those who do church, as they have been raised and believe.  We face a very similar challenge to the early church trying to cope with the overpowering Hebrew tradition in light of a new way of being God's people.  It's all in the verb...being rather than doing...  Jody

      Todd  "There's got to be theology behind the madness."  Agreed, but so often the theology, good and necessary and even sometimes right, hasn't taken us to good places. Or worse, it has remained just good theology divorced from incarnation..  thus gnosticism. Then too, good theology has sometimes been oppressive because "knowledge is power" and those who know and can put it into words have used their superior knowledge to control the show. After all, who can argue with the theologians? Particularly when they have several letters after their names   ;)  (Maybe in fact theology is too important to be left to the theologians, who after all are subject to the temptation to guard their turf just like others with power. But the gospel view was always from the bottom up).  That's why in some ways I think that the incarnation of kingdom purposes is more important even than the words. When we have to point to the mystery that is incarnate in our lives, then we have something to talk about. We have to not only have the answer but BE the answer, be God's YES to the world.  The best criticism of the bad is ultimately not new answers but a new way.. a practice of the better way. And this is finally the best reason to leave old structures too, so that when asked we don't just offer more words.. another answer.. but something concrete..  "how can we "do church" in order to best facilitate the production of these recreated people??? "  We do it by being it, because ultimately we don't want merely redeemed individuals but transformed communities. Reconciliation is meaningless apart from transformed relationships.

      Fred…   I hear a lot of vision in you, and a willingness to take risks and move in new directions. I wish for you a place to explore those new directions, because I believe you will create an invitational space that will empower and release others to build something more relevant to the changing culture around you.  At the same time, this would minimize your personal frustration and launch you into a place of ministry that is more conducive to your own heart.  So, I think the question you need to ask yourself is this: Is God calling you to stay and bang your head against the wall? Sometimes he does do so..  Or is God using your frustration to send you a different message? Is he trying to birth something new through you?  It isn’t likely to be born if you stay where you are.  Kevin, I am personally really glad to hear you questioning church as outreach program. A church is first a community, and as we love one another we become naturally inviting to those around us. Mission is rooted and grounded in community. Where this isn’t true, mission becomes merely a program and we lose interest. On the other hand, if we merely go in nice communal circles we forget what our love is for. Mission also empowers community.  Alan, “God’s purpose is to re-establish His kingdom on earth.” I remember hearing somewhere that “The Kingdom of God is creation healed.” I like that.  A friend of mine likes to opine, “The church is the dating service.. but sometimes she thinks she’s the date.” LOL. Here’s one from Howard Snyder:  "Church people think about how to get people into the church; kingdom people think about how to get the church into the world. Church people worry that the world might change the church; kingdom people work to see the church change the world. "  len

      fred... hey, jeff here from seattle... no background, just unsolicited advice....oh, i guess you did solicit it... as we look upon nature, we observe gravity and see how it brings things from the heights to the depths, some times the things transform prior to hitting the ground.  sometimes they never make it.  moisture at 20,000 feet above sealevel often is snow.  as it nears 0 sealevel or the ground, it may have transformed to rain, sleet, fog, or it may have vaporized, offering none of the life giving moisture that it could have. in recent political history we see how uncle ron preached the benefits and joys of trickledown economics.  as the big companies are allotted more money (or less taxes) that will result in more money, jobs, more products at smaller prices, meaning that the people at the bottom of the socio-economic rung will have more.  right?  well.... no.  rather the rich invest the money, becoming richer and further alienating them from those these tax breaks were (hopefully) intended to benefit. the religious right believes that if we can get more christians into political office then our country would again become a christian nation, with trickle down morality, saving the furthest and farthest out.  right?  god help us if that ever happens! most holy spirit led movements do not begin at the top and trickle down - whether in the church,  the world or anyplace else.  they start at the bottom, with the least likely to succeed.  a baby in a manger.  a struggling priest.  a nun who cared.  a doughnut served warm & fresh off the conveyor belt (oops thats a different kind of movement)... christ never asked permission.  nor did he ask for forgiveness.  he didn't need to.  he moved as his father prompted.  do we?  do we need to apologize for what we feel god stirring in our heart?  who's permission do we need to have in order to love god w/heart, soul, mind & strength and our neighbor as ourself? the question is, as a shepherd are you called to guard the flock, leading them to safe pastures?  perhaps you need to assign yourself a new title more open to upending the flock a bit, making them more apt and open to new comers and what it will take to reach those outside the 4 walls of the flock. my 2 cents....jeff

      I just wrote an article on my webiste  urlLink here .  It's an early thought that I'm just begining to work with.  But, I think it is a good subject to discuss here, as well.  Basically, I'm questioning the attitude that "church" should exist primarily as an evangelism outreach program.  I'm wondering whether we might be doing ourselves a disservice with our "seeker sensitivity".  I'm wondering if church shouldn't be a time for the members to give praise and thanksgiving to God and to receive training, exhortation, and encouragement.  I agree with the apostle Paul that we should not do things in church that cause the unsaved to think we have gone nuts or they will never believe our testimonies.  But, I'm really starting to wonder if in making church an evangelism event rather than a maturity event, we have given something up.

       I'll provide a little background  and then pray for wisdom and godly advice.  I've been a part of a church that has transitioned from a traditonal institutional church to a contemporary institutional church. Situated in the applachain mountains (West Va.) sets us  a little further back on the postmodern curve. Many good changes have been made but most of the change has been in form. Great worship, superb worship leader, a peer group who wants to move forward but at times seems afraid and admittedly doesn't know how to get from point A to point B.  The problem I am facing is that I am only one of seven shepherds. In this leadership group there's also 3 paid ministers. We meet once a week to discuss members; problems and ideas. With the plurality of leaders and such a diverse group it's not often we end with conclusions. Often I pass ideas along. The comment is something like, "Fred's making us think out of the box." But that's where it dies as with most other ideas. We have a campus ministry and I made the suggestion that we pay $25 a head to have a college student share their perceptions, experiences and understanding of church and Christians. The investment to learn from someone outside our four walls about perceptions and impressions of us and, at the same time, afford us opportunities with the pre-Christian is, I feel a good investment. I suggested Credit Card Debt Revival where we pay off someone's credit card once every month or two. I suggested we create safe places for the pre-Christian similar to the  urlLink Andrew's idea stated in his blurb of The Court of the Gentiles.  No movement. They listen, but it seems to end there. We did discuss an inheritance the chuch is going to receive in the next couple of months and, interestingly, there was decsion there.   As a fisher of men; my tackle box is filling with new tools and ideas. More and more it's a passion and desire of mine to incorporate and take ideas from theory to practice. But, my is it frustrating!  I have to be honest and admit that I am not sure how or when one can proceed in a group such as ours. Should I expect the consensus of the group? Should I take risk and act on my ideas without the groups blessing? Anyone want to jump in here ____

      Although I think (and I've experienced this) there will be and maybe should be a certain degree of "reaction" at the beginning of something new, it can't stay in the realm of reaction or it goes nowhere. I think that's fort of what you're saying Todd. There's going to be a degree of getting rid of the old in order to make way for the new - I think that's fine and good - needs to happen. BUT, if we have as a foundation for these new things we are doing only the disgust for former things, we have a lousy foundation - winds will blow - we will fall down.   There's got to be theology behind the madness.  I mean by that - we have to have a good solid positive reason for doing what we're doing, and we must know what it is. Why am I starting this new church or community of faith? What is my purpose? What is a "church" anyway? You've got to have a good idea of what that is before you do these things. Why "simple church"? To be cool? To NOT be something else that's not so cool?? I hope not. There is a thick, deep theology behind why this movement is happening in the church at large. Let's get hold of that and go forward.  Here are a couple of quesitons: What is God's purpose? What is He trying to accomplish? and What can I do to best help bring that about? - well, do that.  I think His purpose is to re-establish His Kingdom on earth - to bring it all back into line. I think His purpose is to recreate us into the people He intended us to be (spiritual formation - transformation). I think the church, the Christian community, is a tool for that purpose - a formation ground. So, that being so, how can we "do church" in order to best facilitate the production of these recreated people???  Our ecclesiology should flow from the answer to that question.

      David, I don't pretend to have anything figured out nor do I have the expectation that I ever will, but I do relate a little to what you are saying. I think many house church's started because of dissatisfaction with the institutional church only to start to form their own institution and subculture. I agree that belonging is very important but my question would be belonging to what? I think if we just create a space to belong with no substance to it two things will happen, people will either make their own meaning which can lead to fragmentation instead of community, or they will become disenchanted and leave. Whatever type of ministry you start should have a missional focus that is doable and understandable and something everyone is committed to beyond just "let's get together." You may have already thought of this I know it may sound academic, but I have seen many movements start without any purpose beyond, "church sucks." So many new churches make the mistake of changing the form without addressing the substance so it just becomes the same old church with cooler music and technology stuff. That only lasts so long. What is the purpose of your community David? Is it outreach by bringing people to the community? Where do you hope it goes?

      i have spent the last few years fully devoted to "non-traditional" church, house church or simple church as some call it. Lately through prayer I have found it lacking.  somewhat it fails to reach out to my own desires and needs from the church. it also tends to be isolationist. we often talk about being missional and then forget all about it.  we still haven't moved from Sunday Morning Church to lifestyle christianity. so i venture out making partnerships to create something new that hopefully will encourage team leadership, radical discipleship and creativity. I was raised in the Christian Church/Church of Christ affiliation. And while I have often considered them very legalistic, I am partnering with an old friend to plant a postmodern fellowship that will be more of an outreach, a safe place to explore Christianty rather than just a haven for Christians.   What are your thoughts about things that are important in reaching out to this day and age. Heck I am 23 and I still don't have my generation figured out. Other than one key thing. WE NEED TO FEEL LIKE WE BELONG.

      i think it needs to be a both/and to truly grow and bless all people.  i was not raised in the church so i have a different idea of what it's all about.  when my wife and i started to attend a large church we noticed that as we walked in the door - she went to the right, with the women, i was pulled to the left with the guys and our daughter was sent to 'the room" as she called it - only to comr togather as we were leaving - a family church that broke-up the family - interesting.  now, i would agree that there may be times when breaking people into groups would be good - but the main problem we found is that it became a program.  when we finally stood our ground and refused to "break-apart" we got strange looks and even fell out of fashion with some people.  balance is good, as long as we do not place more value on the plates we use on the scales -   pax john

      This is a good one to wrestle with. I grew up in a church that did integrate the kids for the beginning of church and then had them go to a children's church for teaching. Children were integrated almost fully (except maybe nursery age) into the Sunday evening service. I can see pros and cons for each. I wonder though, is it really a bad thing to have times when people come together based on an age or social affinity (newly married, married with kids, etc.) ? I think we sometimes feel as if it has to be an all or nothing kind of solution when maybe it is a both/and (I think that is kinda postmodern isn't it:). I know our church is wrestling with this now. We have venues where people are together for small groups and other things based mainly on geography which is good, yet we have people who are struggling to get connected with others in their age group (especially those with kids). So I like Andrews balance and I think we have to balance any approach and provide both kinds of opportunities. What do others think?

      I don’t have a particular problem with segregating children from adults. There are always going to be some things that can be done more effectively or more efficiently in a socially homogeneous group. I’m pretty sure that if we made children and adults do things together all the time, we’d all be clawing at the walls before long. But I do think that continuity of discourse is an important postmodern virtue. As soon as a pragmatic segregation (eg., for the purpose of teaching) becomes a ‘cultural’ or ‘social’ or ‘linguistic’ segregation, then community begins to suffer. Part of the postmodern agenda, surely, is to knock holes in the cultural boundaries between church and not-church, but also within the church – between traditionalists and progressives, between moderns and postmoderns, between thinkers and feelers, between word-based and Spirit-based spiritualities, between different social and racial groups, between men and women, and between young and old. Let the children be part of the conversation, I say. Incidentally, last Sunday at the  urlLink Ichthus  church in London we go to, we had kids being prophesied over, waving banners, and writing their thoughts and drawing pictures from God on a big roll of paper as part of the service. Old-fashioned charismatic kitsch maybe, but it all helps overcome the disjuncture between their spiritual life (if they’re allowed to have any) and ours.

      The whole 'uncomfortable' thing has always poked at my mind. Aren't there people in other contries who are willing, literaly, to die for the chance to worship? But most Americans don't like it if we have to sit w/in 6 feet of anyone else.  Is it postmoderns who are bothered by children in worship or is it only the long-time-churched?  I don't think I have the answer, I'm just thinking out loud.

      when arron and i were discussing the idea of children in church, the blog came into our talk.  the idea of children in worship is one that interests me greatly.  it is amazing to me, we spend years telling kids they are not welcomed in church (because we have a "special" place for them) then, when they are older, we wonder why they won't step foot into the church.  if we see the emerging church as a movement closer to community and family, then putting children in the back room will not due - no matter how uncomfortable some may become -   pax

      Hey people - on the children thing, a little while back some of us were talking about this thing, blogging about it individually and it ended up being formed into a team blog called  urlLink What do we do with the kids?  It lasted a little while and then kind of petered out for some reason. Maybe we just talked it out as much as we needed and that was it. There is some interesting stuff on there though - worth a read to anyone interested in integrating children into the life of a Christian community. Like I said, it's sort of a "dead" blog but all the posts are still there - check it out from the beginning at the bottom.

      i have been pondering this question for a while now.  it seems that what i never hear in the postmodern discussion is the voices of children, its as if we dont have any or they are being ignored, maybe its not that serious maybe its just that a lot of postmodern people dont have kids yet.  i have always wondered why we segregate kids out of our corporate worship, the only time they seem to be wanted inour church is when we need a quarom (sp) for a business meeting.  maybe its an outgrowth of public education and the way it segregates everything by age.  maybe we are too stuck in the isolation mold and when we think kids are ready to do real worship maybe its because they just dont want to be involved with big church because it so boring for them.  maybe the whole model of songs and a sermon needs to go away so we can explore new ways of corporate interaction with GOD.  maybe i am asking too many questions. :)  anyway thanks for bringing this one up we need to think long and deep about it or we will create another irrelevant expression of worship that kids and then adults will ignore.

       theology of children in postmodern worship...   just want to throw out an idea that john & i kicked around a bit this weekend...in our  urlLink church , we have all ages in our worship service: from babies to the oldest. here's why: i want to raise my own child in the context of "the church" as family, a movement of all ages, instead of the concept of "church" as babysitting and "big church". traditional christians that "try" (consumer-oriented; "great band", "relevant" teaching type comments) our church love it -- unless they have kids..then they want to drop them off in a "class" for the hour.  as we kicked this around, john brought up Jesus' words about bringing the children to Him. we laughed that he didn't appoint Andrew a children's pastor, Peter for youth, etc. etc.  any thoughts? anyone else working through this in the corporate worship setting?

       did God ever play one of those games on you?      did you ever have one of those experiences where you thought one thing, and something very different happened? well, i had one this weekend at the "upstairs leadership conference." my first thought was that i was going to be in the middle of a bunch of southern baptists, and this is going to be weird. but i tell you what, it was actually great. sure, there were some who could not get past the shaved head, the earrings, the black cloths - and more - but all in all, i was made to feel very welcomed and very accepted. many people actually like what i had to share about postmodern theology, and ministry in a emerging church.   but the best part of the whole experience was getting to know to groups of people - and let me share a bit about each group:    THE BRIDGE : this group of people is fantastic. aaron norwood, and all the people, were open, loving, kind, welcoming and best of all - postmodern. it was great to talk with people who "get it." anything i wanted, they went out of there way to get me - a pure servant heart - and need i say, "a kicking worship band."    THE GATHERING : this groups was wonderful. they were like sponges, wanting more and more of all God was offering. doug and his team invited me to share with them at their church (word of grace) when i was finished at the confrence. i was made to feel very welcomed and the meeting we had that night was one filled with questions and wonderful insite.   as i look back on the weekend, one thing came to be, that if nothing else would have happened this would have been worth it all - the bridge and the gathering got to know each other, even if just a little - a new relationship can now start to form. some of the people attend both services and not their leaders know each other - and like each other - and the process of building the kingdom can now take hold. i praise God for all he is doing and all he is striving to do, as time moves on.   pax  john

      One thing it took for me was to get out of the safety of my comfort zone. It's a long story but two significant things for me were that a) i read the biography of troy perry who founded the metropolitan church (a gay denomination) - i think the book is called 'don't be afraid anymore' and b) i went to a gay church to see what it was like and meet some people. and surprise surprise guess who was there? God! I had and still have theological questions and even differences maybe - that's not what i want to get into discussing - but having crossed a border and looked back things look very different to what they did before making the journey.

      I would agree with John that we should love others unconditionally and engage in their lives. I think there is a natural tendency for people to rank sins and the severity of sin as we see in our legal system. People forget that God sees sin as sin and that Jesus himself was criticized for hanging out with the worst of sinners in his day. I think may Christians confuse politics with people. I have heard one Christian say that he does love those who are gay but when they try to make their lifestyle a political agenda that everyone should just accept as normal he opposes it, just as he would oppose an adulterer doing the same thing. I don't know how easy it is to hold that balance but I think we need to love someone where they are at not where we they can get to if we change them. That is why the love the sinner hate the sin slogan is tired and worn out for so many. You have to actually love someone for that statement to be valid at all. No love is displayed so all that is seen is hate. I don't know what it will take for us to move beyond this.

      In response to Fred's post I would have to agree that we can get too caught up in forms and forget what may need to be reformed (I know play on words). I have seen some churches that claim to be "postmodern" (an eagerness to be labeled is probably a warning sign) that are nothing more than church with some new technology and the latest fads. I think many attempts can be a kind of pseudo change that is more a reaction to some new found freedom without any thought about what needs to be changed and reformed. I do think that there are wonderful traditional churches out there that have not sold out to a modern, prefab, church in a box, type of faith. So I would agree there is a place for both. Heck, I think we could learn much from the modern model both positive and negative as long as we keep the balance between reform and form.

      it seems that no matter how much we talk and how much we do, interaction with the gay community scares us, enrages us, maybe it should enliven us.  i taught a 5-6th grade sunday school class once on sin and tried to make the point to the kids that GOD sees ALL sin as SIN and that some arent worse or less worse than others, yet when i mentioned this one the kid said it was a sin and worse than others.  when i talk about it with adults it is clear that many evangelicals see homosexuality as the mother of all sins.  why do we always need to categorizes everything?  is it the capitalism we worship or is it something more basic in our dna.  talked to a man once who runs an international ministry who is very outspoken against the gay community, well one day the leader of the local gay community meet with this man and asked him to stop targeting them and focus on adultery for a while.  well the backlash from the christian community to my friend when he began to speak out about adultery was far worse than anything the gay community gave him.  arent we just suppose to love others no matter where they are, what they believe, who they love?  am i missing something, shouldn't the church be celebrating tammy faye's work instead of questioning it?

      Reading the Tammy Faye story, somehow reminded me of the missing minister story I read about a few years ago and then saw on the news magazine 20/20.   Barre Cox, a 33-year-old youth minister at MacArthur Park Church of Christ in San Antonio, vanished on July 12, 1984, leaving behind his wife and 6-month-old daughter. His car was found vandalized on a deserted country road, and his ID was located in a nearby ditch. Local police, the Civil Air Patrol and the Texas Rangers mounted a massive search, but ultimately gave up on the case.  Sixteen years later he's discovered in White Rock Community church (gay community) as the preaching minister.  urlLink [...more]

      tammy faye, you caring, loving, heartful person - so wonderful.  i like the articale in  urlLink charisma online   dealing with tammy's ministry to gays - it's wonderful to know that there is actually life after ptl.  she is right on the money when she says that the church needs to be a hospital and not a courtroom.  while i can't picture anyone giving her a hard time for her calling, i am certian there are people in the church who will condem her for her actions.  i remember being told by a member of a church i served as senior pastor that i was not welcomed in her house because i hugged and held the hand of a man with aids - so closed minds are all over the place.   i think what tammy is doing is right on target - she is not condeming those outside the church - instead she is loving them and caring for who they are - let God work in their lives and let God change who they are, on God's time and in God's terms - as understood between God and the person.   pax john

      My thanks to John for the invitation to participate and for the kind words my first attempt produced.  I guess I am a part of the community of faith that may emerge from the current/institutional church.  The first blogs I have read here have given me ideas/hope in how to serve the Father without being seen as a devisive force within the church.  Addressing the needs of those feeling the same way while maintaining our focus on Christ is crucial and I look to ya'll (yes, I can say that...I am a native Texan) for ideas and support.  Somedays, I am so frustrated with the situation and swear I will bail out until He calms me and reminds me that He too, wore the same skin and dealt with the same institutions and mindsets...and that in spite of our power-trips and prejudices, He loves us anyway!  We are so blessed by the Savior!  Be God's, Jody

       I just received the following e-mail from a brother whom I repect as much as anyone .  I am really not that impressed with all the new externals for doing church. What I see as needing changing is the institutional mindset, the religiosity, the doctrinal traditions that are not rooted in Scripture. I believe we can have a newness birthed by the Spirit with external forms both new and old. Last Sunday I visited at my son's church in Dallas -- a Bible church with 2,000 members, a loud band, projected songs (of which I only knew one) and a preacher who dressed casually -- in a sanctuary that looked like a warehouse and a "stage" with no pulpit. The previous six Sundays I had been attending the Episcopal Church of St. John the Divine, which had about 1,200 present in a sanctuary with an ornate altar down front, processional and recessional with robed choir, vestmented clergy, cross-bearers, etc., kneeling-benches, going to the altar and kneeling to receive Communion. I totally believe God was present and experienced in both places, but my personal aesthetics and emotional bent were served much more at the Episcopal Church rather than the Bible church. My wife, on the other hand, would vote for the Bible church rather than St. John's if those were her only two options.  What I want to see is Spirit and spirit, Christ-centeredness and Bible-teaching, a loving fellowship and a sense of reaching out with the gospel others. And I see that in both my son's Bible church and at St. John's Episcopal.   If I could add commentary to the above it would be ... "The traditional church continues to meet the needs of many; likewise the post office continues to run even though we've got e-mail, what the emerging church is doing is e-mail, and the established church has the postal routes." ...I can't remember whom to give credit to for that thought, but I like it...what say you?

      Hey.. things are getting busy here  :)  SOmeone offered pancakes... allow me to accept your offer, and raise you two eggs.  Two years ago when we left the traditional setting we pondered what we wouild do with all the time we freed up. A few weeks later my wife awoke one morning, rolled over and looked me in the eye and said.. how about we host a pancake breakfast downtown for the street crowd?  I returned her gaze and said brightly... "Yep." Two weeks later we were in an underused space downtown flipping cakes on Sunday morning at 10 AM. We started Christmas morning and continued til we lost the use of the space at the end of May.  Part of the glory of the experience was the discovery of a premade pancake mix imported from our neighboring province of Alberta. What is unique about this mix is that it uses both whole wheat and rapid rising yeast. These are simply the best pancakes you could ever experience.  When we discovered how good they were, it inspired us to greater feats. Every week we made real whipping cream and fresh apple sauce to go on the cakes.  You can imagine the response downtown.  "er... is this heaven?"   LOL  Cost us a fortune to feed a hundred people a week though.. you know, about $10 US  ;)  john, I wanna join in the affirmation from the crowd. Many thanks for hosting the PM mail list, and thanks for this list. The gift you give us in your thoughtful and compassionate presence is immeasureable. Thanks for your honesty, unpretentiousness, and your kingdom heart. You've blessed me.  On the topic of "outer courts." The other thing we did just before we left the IC we start a prayer meeting among others feelling the outward pull. It resulted in a public meething we called "Solomon's Porch." That too ended after about six months, though there are signs of rebirth. But our thinking was similar to the outer courts idea, and of course you can find several references to the Porch in the book of Acts.

      andrew, i like the idea of moving deeper discussion on this topic (court of the gentiles) to your opensourcetheology site.   the inability to thread on blogs makes ongoing conversation and cycles of building thought rather cumbersome. perhaps these communal blogs that keep popping up should try to move serious threads or comments to a system that can be aggregated and preserved? or not. the other thing is the overlap. the few communal blogs i am a part of have some overlap that could be fruitful:  postmodern_theology.blogspot.com christianity.blogspot.com opensourcetheology.net kingdomspace.com  cheers. urlLink d

      hi  urlLink jonny  checking in to join the fray. interesting to encounter someone else in london. maybe we should hook up andrew as we're in the same city - be nice to hear some more about what you're up to.... strange it takes a postmodern theology blog initiated on the other side of the atlantic to find out about you though :-)

      I appreciate the comments, people. Let me respond to a couple of points. Incidentally, you're welcome to post feedback on the  urlLink OST  site if you really get exercised about it – I don’t want to clog up this blog with  my  problems.  First, the issue of ‘safety’, which was never really a major part of the argument, needs some clarification. The court of the Gentiles was ‘safe’ in the literal sense that it was as close as the Gentiles could get to the place of God’s dwelling without incurring the death penalty. It seems to me that that represents a rather powerful idea, one which is validated by Jesus’ words about it being a house of prayer for all nations – so perhaps it is safe in the sense that it has theological legitimacy. But my bigger concern is that this space should be safe from overzealous, predatory, proselytizing Christians and from the stifling effect of Christian culture, etc. Apart from that, I would not disagree with what has been said about the ‘unsafeness’ of  urlLink entering the temple courts , the difficulty of the Christian way, and so on.  Secondly, my feeling is that the primary value of the outer courts analogy is that it stands as a corrective to the prevailing mentality of the church. The point is, Dan, that broadly speaking we  are  too ‘ urlLink entrenched in our patterns of religious practice ’. Because this is a biblical analogy, because it starts from the church’s perception of itself as a sanctuary within the world, the exclusive dwelling of the Holy Spirit, the picture may help believers find a way out of the closeted, closed-minded environment of the church back into the normal world. A ‘court of the gentiles space’ may not provide anything that ‘the people of the way should not already be doing over a few drinks at the local pub’, or whatever. The problem is that, by and large, they’re  not  doing it. You’re way ahead of us. It raises an interesting point: arguably the believers needs the court of the Gentiles more than the Gentiles do!  Thirdly, at the moment  urlLink here  in London I’m assuming that this ‘space’ will need to be both structured and unstructured. Yes, I think it should fundamentally be a way of life in the way that Dan has described (‘24/7 every fricking place we go’), but my fear is that if there is not some level of intentionality and organization about it, people will eventually drift back into their churches, back into their customary ways of thinking, and shut the door behind them. We need to  learn  how to do it. But there are various ways of providing that input and organization – and how we do it will depend a lot on the cultural and religious context in which we’re working. I guess, though, I would like to see the implications of this sort of thinking worked all the way up from the natural everyday interaction of ‘people of the way’ with those around them, through larger community structures (which may look not at all like church), to the more rarefied level of culture, worldview, ideas, etc.   Thanks for listening.

      hey all.   fred  urlLink commented  on liking andrew's quip about creating a space between the church and the world. andrew used the metaphor of the court of the gentiles of the second temple in  urlLink his post .  it may be simpleton dan coming out here, so forgive me if this sounds too easy, but isn't this "space" of which andrew speaks, albeit in its simplest form, merely our lives? the patterns of existence that we choose to enact? this really isn't an organizational movement is it? do we need to run out and create some inbetween organization that facilitates the creation of this space? are we really so inbred as communities that we have no friends outside of our little groups? are we so oddly entrenched in our patterns of religous practice that normal kingdom hospitality is not this very space of which we are speaking? go to a bar with your community! take some of your community to your next office party! what is it that a "court of the gentiles" space would provide that the people of the way should not already be doing over a few drinks at the local pub or on the course or at gameworks or any number of natural cultural events/locales?   i resonate with andrew's idea. in many ways we do this in our  urlLink community  here in c.texas (in fact i am far more concerned about our inner courts than figuring out the outer court). i think that we would frighten most conventional church goers in the very fluid oddity that is the warp and woof of our community life. we may be the exception, but most of us have a lot of friends on the margin of the church and firmly entrenched in other religious communities. the safe space of which andrew speaks is the hospitality we engage in; the sharing of life; the long walk over many years together. the problem i have with a generalized, organizational "safe space" is that it is a space without face. it is like  Seeker Sensitive Service 2.0 .   maybe i missed the point. help me andrew. what is it about this inbetween space that is unique? i read your  urlLink post  on  urlLink ost . well structured. your 3rd point sums much of it up i think:    The Court of the Gentiles was not a place of organized, official, programmed activity—other than the selling of sacrificial animals and the changing of money for the purpose of paying the temple tax, of which Jesus appears to have disapproved. We might think of it as essentially a place of presence, being, community, communion, congress, prayer, meditation, a place of proximity to God. The Court of the Gentiles is where the temple overlaps with the world. It is a place where people may safely approach the presence of God, but it could also be regarded, at least in our postmodern context, as a place of escape both from the world and from the sanctuary-a transitional arena, where people move between the secular and the sacred.    my thoughts are simply this:  we don't need a place of "presence, being..." we are that place 24/7 every fricking place we go. MY LIFE is where the church "overlaps with the world." your life too. we embody the presence of the other. our gathering everywhere we go opens the "safe space" of which we now write.    cynical dan pipes up:  no one will come to a physical space crafted by a church as a "safe place." "the world" does not give a shit. they would rather the church actually dare to do something  unsafe  for a change. perhaps something that will really change the world? perhaps something that would get a few people crucified? "the world" (man, i hate that phrase) yawns at our little strategic organizational architectures as they walk away. maybe someone is actually changing the world down the street...  no insult intended.  fight me. ;-)  peace- urlLink d

      not sure the idea of safety sits well with me.  were the temple courts really a safe place to come and listen.  didnt a person risk being identified with the radical nature of the teaching make it risky to be even seen listening.  i understand what is behind the idea of creating a place were people can explore, yet the idea of safety seems contrary to nature of what will be risked, sacrificed and changed if they decide to join in.  maybe i am wrong but one of the problems i had to overcome as i decided to follow was the idea thats is all free and easy to do, now i feel at times as if i was lied to in the beginning.  maybe we are talking about two different things maybe not.  anyway just a thought

      I took part in an Alpha course meeting last night (do you know what I'm talking about?) which illustrated very well I think the need to develop some spiritual 'common ground' between believers and non-believers  and then learn how to live there . It was one of those situations where the believers wanted to be reassured and the cantankerous non-believer (an Australian who was an adherent of some obscure eastern sect that believed, among other things, that all religions are equally viable routes to God) wanted to know why Christians were so damn smug. We did our best to hold a civilized conversation but it was across a huge gulf. The questions and answers simply weren't connecting. Alpha has a lot going for it: it goes a long way towards providing a natural and neutral environment to explore the meaning of faith, but often it only serves to highlight the fact that neither Christians nor non-Christians know how to behave when they get there.

      andrew perriman, and others, have asked the million dollar question, "By the way, how are we supposed to use this blog? Is it meant to be interactive, like a discussion board? Or just a number of personal blogs interwoven?" - ok, that is actually "questions" - your right.  the answer:  yes.  yes, it is designed to be interactive, like a bb - people bouncing ideas off each other and seeing them grow.  yes, it is designed to be a place where personal blogs can be interwoven to build community and connection.  think of it as an organic garden - some plant, some water, some watch, some harvest - and all benefit from the bounty.  for me, one thing that keeps coming to the surface is the idea of community - we all talk about it, most of us write about it and yet most of us live in our limited physical communities - i believe that the internet is a great place to expand that community base.  i love the idea that no matter where i may travel, i could have developed a friendship with someone in that area - that's very cool.  i am going to az this next weekend november 11 and 12) to speak at a leadership conf (called "upstairs), and i am going to spend time with aaron norwoord (he's the man to eamil for more info - email address is on the side under "the gang") and others i have met on line - i am excited, not because i get to talk, but because i get to share time with aaron and the people at the bridge.  for me, and i think for most, i would love this community to define what is happening here, and not by words but by actions.  while i may have some basic ideas, it is all of us who contribute and give it life.  the more voices, the more ideas, the more involved, the easier it will be to define what we - as a community - are looking to accomplish.  this is a "breeding ground" for ideas for doing ministry in the emerging church - so if we all work together we can strive to be something more then just "me" and "you" we can actually become "us."  what do you think?  what do you see as the possibility of this blog?  pax john o'keefe

      Someone has said that a heresy is any deviation from an accepted standard within a religious group. I can think of at least three distinct areas where deviations within a group and resulting conflicts can take place.   1.	A shift in the accepted doctrinal stance 2.	A departure from Biblical moral standards 3.	and when there’s a departure from normal relational standards.   When Gandhi said, "… if it were only for Christ, I would have gladly become a Christian." He was reacting to the latter of the three. Arguably, (and it's of my opinion) relational heresy is the greatest obstacle to the spread of the Gospel.  Jesus said that you could judge the genuineness of his disciples by their relationships. (John 13:35). Doctrinal purity is necessary; moral purity is essential; but we can have both without relational purity and fail to be His disciple. Paul described this in 1 Corinthians 13:1-3 when he speaks of three kinds of churches; the doctrinally correct (verse 1), the spiritually gifted (verse 2), and the socially attuned (verse 3). Without relational purity, Paul says, we’re nothing.   Through the years we've all experienced random acts of love and kindness within our Christian communities. But the present emerging church, it appears, is modeling a standard of relational purity that has the potential of demonstrating the transforming nature of the gospel unlike the previous generations. This is key if there is going to be a penetration of postmodern America. For the Gospel message is best proclaimed out of a community of love.

      John, I also want to say thanks for the invitation to join this blog. I'm not especially good at keeping up with these things, but I'll do my best. I'm in London working with Christian Associates on a  urlLink church plant , also scratching our heads wondering how to establish an 'open community of faith for the emerging culture'. Churning out the slick phrases is easy, making it happen is something else! I'd like to hear more about what Abigail's up to in Sheffield.  What intrigues me at the moment is the possibility of mapping out an area between the church and world, that is neither church nor world, where believers and non-believers can interact in a spiritually and relationally significant way. I have tried to develop this idea  urlLink elsewhere  after the pattern of Herod's temple, which had a large outer courtyard (the Court of the Gentiles) where Jews and Gentiles could mix. I would like to know whether a model like this might not offer a useful way to reconceptualize being church in a postmodern environment. Anyway, that's where I'm coming from - or is it where I'm going? No matter.  By the way, how are we supposed to use this blog? Is it meant to be interactive, like a discussion board? Or just a number of personal blogs interwoven?

      Hi, just wanted to say thanks for the invite to join this blog. My name is Abigail (a.k.a. Cedarlily), and I'm in Sheffield, UK. This blog is pretty timely for me: there's currently a lot going on at my church (St Thomas', Crookes), and there's a gang of us scratching our heads as to how exactly we're going to do church. Things are shifting, we're desperate for things to be more organic and less constrained by meetings, but we're still in the early stages. So to be able to hear what you guys are up to, and maybe ask some (hopefully not too ignorant) questions, is really cool.  I'm also really interested in the postmodern theology side of things, as I've just started a MA in Critical Theory & Cultural Studies, and I'm finding it hard to know how to appraise all these theories in the light of the Kingdom. So if this is a space where you're grappling with various -isms and philosophies under God's perspective, that'll really help my head from exploding! Anyhow, will step back into the sidelines now, just wanted to say hi.  Toodle pip Abigail

      wow,  this is great... another blog to check out and write on...i enjoy it...  just before we started to go to the church we attend now, my wife and i had decided that we were not going to settle into another rut of obligation...we didn't want to feel we had to be there in fear of judgement if we missed...our problem lies in having to get four children up, dressed, ready and then pretend to be super spiritual when we arive in the parking lot..  some of our better arguments have been on the way to church (go figure).  so, we knew that we wanted something different, something where we felt we belonged without feeling the pressure to measure up to unrealistic expectations. we needed change...  change tends to make me run the other way. i didn't want to start over again. i didn't want to be caught up in some poilitics driven group...even though i wanted something different, i didn't want change...my therapist(Jesus) and i are working on that little quirk..we went from church to church, yet never felt welcome..sure there were the smiles and hand shakes, but the feeling wasn't there..there was no genuineness in the actions shown...we had the feeling that if we never came back that no one would would ask where that odd couple with the 4 kid were..  i remember talking with a friend of mine about a church he had started a couple of years ago..the only reason we never went before was we thought that having a church service at 1pm was too rebelious.(that coming from the token punk christian 13'r family). we went and fell in love with the very first encounter..we didn't have the argument on the way to church. we didn,t have to hurry to get there because we had to fight with one of our children to get dressed (in fact they dress themselves) not only that but we also found a community, not just a group of prople speaking some unknown dialect of christianese, but a community of like minded souls looking for a relationship with God and others...  i know , i know  good for me, huh..  we don't have all the answers, but we are willing to admit that..we don't always practice what we preach, but we are striving to do so(we all need a starting point)...we do love each other and others....not in words but in action..  so for $19.95 i can send you my book,"how to be super spiritual in an spiritually deprived community" ...it will bless ya...  ok, I AM KIDDING!!! i don't know what came over me...please forgive me...  i say all this to agree that, yes we need to "shift" we need to change our perspective...we need to look at what we do and ask why we do it...like right now, i am looking at why i ramble on like this...it's genetic! mom did it, dad did it(who said opposites attract).i do it and my kids do it..  my wife does it also, but will deny it.  a side note: after church we all head downstairs to have a meal...every week..   that is where the real ministry is..  pancakes anyone?  God bless,  urlLink chuck

      rhythm is a mysterious thing for me lately, meaning its been hard to find, i think there is a certain rhythm to life and i have wondered at times about music and how certain songs just calm me or pump me up and if its the rhythms inherent in the music.  not sure if that makes any sense but if it does what does that say about our theology, shold it have certain rhythm that make it accesiblle to people and if your rhythms are different will you fail to connect to it.  its liek worship music, contemporary, traditional etc maybe its just about rhythm.  maybe rhythm is something we have missed for too long in our desire to quantify, instead of trying to prove a GOD of order why not just enjoy a GOD of rhythms

      This weekend I got thinking about rhythm in my life..  Maybe it was the bicycle ride in the cold weather that did it; pumping those pedals up and down.. up and down.. round and round we go..   I realized that in that rhythm there was also movement. I was making progress toward Blockbuster, looking for an obscure video that they apparently had hidden somewhere.  It seems like we all forge our own rhythms; and those rhythms give us a sense that all is well in the world.   For example, in my family Saturday morning is pancakes and a family brunch. We rarely have a breakfast on this morning, and we almost always sit down together for a meal. It's more reliable than almost any other meal in the week.  It could be that I make great pancakes. Ok.. I KNOW I make great pancakes. But it's more than great pancakes that brings us together.  It's a commitment to being a family; to knowing one another; to sharing a relaxed meal and catching up on events of the past week that we may not have had time to share.  It strikes me that we have some rhythms that are individual, and some that are communal.  Over time rhythms can shift. I have a hard time changing beats, but there is real value in making those shifts.  Changing the usual rhythms also shifts perspective. When we step outside the normal routine, we see things in a new light.   Initially we may only notice our discomfort and pine for the old ways. I'm loathe to think about leaving our Saturday brunch behind, for example. But there may come a time when we have to make that shift.  Two years ago we abandoned a rhythm that had given shape to our lives for all our married years.. 16 of them. We quit attending a Sunday service.  Whew.. that was a confusing time. We didn't know if we were coming or going, up or down, black or white, wrong or right. We just knew we needed a change.  Eventually our questions birthed some answers, and those answers birthed new questions. We looked at our faith in a new way, and we looked at the church from a new place. We even began to read the bible in new ways.  At the same time, we became aware that we were upheld by older and more foundation rhythms.. internal rhythms of prayer and reflection, community and dialogue. We became aware of rhythms so deep they were like unheard music.. music older than time itself. We became aware of being upheld in the hands of Love.  Eventually we find a center that anchors our soul, and we can relax and let new cadences emerge. It becomes an exciting process of discovery and of wonder.  Meantime, we enjoy the pancakes and the sharing around our Saturday brunch.

        a good theology:    what does it take to create a "good theology?"  i believe many churches have "bad theology" - some have very bad theologyies - but that's another post.  here is what i have been working on centering on the development of a postmodern theology -   it needs to be:   simple :  complexity coems from our individual desire to please everyone, and in turn pleasing no one.  relevant and timeless:   to be today while knowing yesterday  transparent and honest:   no hidden agendas, no hidden thoughts  flexible:   not ridget or fixed  scriptural:   based on a solid reading of the teachings of christ - a "christology" if you will.  collective:   breed and based in community.  more to follow - as i think about them.   pax

      Laurie  I read your post and it brought me to tears.. Not exactly a solution, but I want you to know that the heart of the Lord is broken for you and for so many because we have strayed so far from the most basic definition of Christian living.. "See how they love one another!"  I hear your heart to be in real community.. a people on a journey, and committed to one another and to being the church together.. a community of life, light and love and in that light a witness to the darkness around them.  The modern church is really all but incapable of such a thing. And so there are many of us.. you would probably be surprised just how many... beginning to build something new.  It is about making a new start.. and not merely new paint for the old thing. No one puts new wine into old skins...  So my encouragement to you.. and my prayer for you.. is to find just a few others who are trying to be the church for one another.. and then in that growing strength to begin  to reach out with that love. One hand reaching in.. and one hand reaching out.  It's hard to make that new beginning. Why? Because we have all died trying to renew the old thing.. and now we have less faith and less strength for a new venture.  And even rebuilding means some simple structures.. and we have no faith in structures.  So it takes a kind of leap of faith into newness. ANd maybe that leap is truly a faith leap... a divine spark and a gift from above. And, as you point out.. you can't make that leap alone. The leap is made relationally not only individually. So the divine gift is first a gift of community.  So Lord of the church, connect Laurie with the few who are going to new places.

      Yes, this is good stuff, and it's good to be thinking through all the various ways we connect with our communities.  There is not just one way, and we need to flex to the various needs presented to each group of people God puts in our path, whether electronically (for some), or merely those in proximity to each of us.  The methods and approach will vary.  That is what we all need to understand, and learn to follow the leading of the Spirit in our own lives.  I grew up in the kind of church where, if someone noticed a need/problem, a committee was formed, a program was developed in hopes to do something to meet that need.  I grew up with that kind of behavior modeled to me.  That may not be so bad, and some people may have been reached in that way.  But now I am struggling with re-learning behaviors and habit patterns.  Subconsciously I find that I wait for someone else to do the things I need to take responsibility for on my own.  Now I see that in many situations I need to just step out and do things...without depending on some organization to do it with me or for me!    Len, I appreciate your approach and desire to invite people in...this is just the kind of thing I want to be doing.  But I struggle.  It's difficult to do on my own.  I feel isolated and alone and without support.  I feel that the Christian community around me is not "there" for me to lend a hand.  I don't know how to go about following through with the vision I have.  This may just be me--my struggle and difficulty may all be in my head--but I find I want to blame my inability to act on some deficiency in the local church.  So...the challenge for local churches today may be to model this behavior of caring and supporting one another--in prayer and in action--on more of a personal level (without feeling we need to develop programs and have committees!).  I have, for some reason, begun to reach out online to get some of that support.  And there is some there...through prayer and ideas and so on.  But how do I get my local Christian community to be *there* for me, when I feel they aren't?   I NEED TO BE THERE FOR THEM!

      Andrew,  as I reread your post this morning I see a lot more there. Good stuff. Our networks are diverse and multilayer. I guess I would restate the challenge like this: "How do we sustain and influence this diverse and multiplayer network, reconnecting Christian and non-Christian elements, while maintaining a real and incarnational presense in embodied communities of faith?"  My wife and I have to date taken the approach of simply inviting people into our home on Sundays. Then during the week we connect with individuals who need our time and attention primarily, and then as we have time and energy with others. And we encourage those connections randomly within the community also.. though to date we still are the center of that initiative. THis needs to change.. but because our group is mostly needy and only about 30% Christian, it's a challenge to build that kind of caring.

      Andrew wrote "Maybe, then, the real problem is not the distance of the pastor from the church but the distance of the church from the world."  Interesting rephrase.. but I don't think the two can be separated.  I agree that we participate in more than one community. Anyone who is on the net much and is serious about their relationships will soon be connected to a broader network of relationships.  But we all have limited time and energy. Our most significant opportunities to share the gospel are where people can see us living the gospel; and that witness was never meant to be an individual one.. it was meant to be corporate. So, while its important and significant for my family to connect personally with our physical neighbors, its even more important that we witness in our relationships to a different way of life, different priorities, and real caring for one another.  That means we need a community base. It's very difficult to build a community base of witness if we are spread through a 15 mile radius.  My point is incarnation.. a physical, historical and fleshly manifestation of the truth. Lacking this we only have a modern propositional apologetic and reasonable sounding excuses about truth and witness. The church must be an embodied presence, and faith is participation in truth embodied in a faithful community.  So, I am not arguing that we abandon our multiple or electronic communities. I am arguing for a center of embodied presence. If we fail in that one, the others wont' be worth much.

      We associate postmodernism with a high level of diversity, fragmentation and complexity. I suppose a pastor will feel strongly connected to one particular expression of Christian community. But surely for most people now the experience of community is far from straightforward. As a family we have the community of people in our flats, our neighbours, we are part of a loose network of friends in the area, most of them parents of our children's friends, we belong to a conventional church fellowship, we are part of a church-planting core group which I hope will develop into a rather extensive cross-border community, we also feel connected to a genuinely global community of friends that we have met in various parts of the world and try to keep in touch with.  For me the challenge at the moment is how do we sustain and influence this diversified, multilayered network, and in particular how do we reconnect the Christian components with the non-Christian components. But I think it has a bearing on the preceding discussions in that it suggests that a much more integrated, interlinked, networked approach is needed - at least, this is where 'postmodernism' is leading us. Perhaps in the long run we will have to break apart the close-knit, consolidated traditional church communities so that people can make new connections. Maybe, then, the real problem is not the distance of the pastor from the church but the distance of the church from the world.

      I posted some links (I think) to some radical islamic stuff.. radically critical of fundamentalist islam.  I agree that if we look only at the extremes we have a distorted view. I recently blogged on this that we have to maintain dialogue with those in the middle and not demonize the entire group.  Interesting debate re: living in the community where we are connected and serve. I think we have made it workable to not do so, but I think there are many things we do much less well when we don't live in close proximity.  Let's face it.. we just don't take the physical reality of teh community we serve as seriously when we drive 10, 20 or 30 miles to our home. I assume that we have to know and love the physical community we live in.. get involved in issues critical to its life, and not just the inner llife of the church but the physical life of the community where that church is rooted.  But if there are riots or death in the streets.. and we can drive 30 miles away and forget about it..

      aaron from phx here for my not-even-monthly check in....  jeff raises good questions -- i think they are applicable in many places. here in phx, it seems, that the metroplex is so connected with freeways, etc., that 25 miles is like next door. i live about 20 miles from where my church meets on Sundays, but we meet for community groups all over the city; mine is about 5 miles from my house. weekly activities are regularly all over the city. while most of our church live on/near ASU campus, we have many driving from as much as a 50 mile radius.....  distance does create some challenges, but it also offers more opportunity to serve people in a wider area. i guess it depends on your motivation for living "away" from your church (although, if church is a verb, not a noun, then i live in the same house with my church, the same neighborhood, and the same city).....whatever.

      ahhh yesssss.... jeff from seattle here aggain for my monthly check in... a great place to start is with thinkig about community.  do people really want it? do they have it already and are using church for something else? i mean, why not sanction off churches to particular communities like they did in the past (or like the mormon church does - i think?) where people are welcome to visit, but their time, talents & treasures are utilized at their local parish?  because.  because that would suck.  i mean who wants to be spiritually vulnerable with the people down the street?  who wants to be held accountable for their actions by fellow church goers from the same neighborhood?  nobody.  if i flip off one of my neighbors while i'm driving to work, i don't want them to confront me in church on sunday.  its much more comfy to go to the big-assed church on the other side of town,  or in the next community, where i am anonymous, can get my fill, then be on my way w/o having to shake anyone's hand.  i don't need a pastor for anything than to give me a damn entertaining & challenging sermon.  i don't want him calling me, stopping by or emailing me.  that bugs me - my free time is my free time.  just a summary of things i've heard, thought, said & feared hearing.... perhaps the question should be asked - is church really a faith community?  should it be considered that in our post-postmodern culture?  is that what people really want, or are they seeking church & relationships there based on a sentimental memory that was experienced through their mom & dad or grandparents?  ???

      This is a good point John but I do not think it is simple. For instance, there are times where a church is located in an area that is too expensive for the pastor to live in based on what the church pays him. Now he could get a second job to make that work but I think that can be counter productive as well. Now if it is strictly preference and the pastor could live near the church I think that is the best option in most cases. In my case, I just can't afford to live near the church. Yet I am about 15 miles from the church so not too far and many in our body live near me. Also, I think the consumer mentality of people in our congregations also plays a role in what we consider a local community. Just because a church is in one community does not mean that the people actually live there in some cases (and the community can be quite large). At our church, we have people coming from a 30 mile radius. So I do think it would be best for a pastor to live in the area that they pastor but I think we do need to look at both sides of the equation. If that is the expectation, the body has to make it possible for the pastor to do so and we need to change the mentality of our people from consumers to committed locally.

      i got to thinking the other day after speaking with a man who was a pasotr in a town about 65 miles outside of las vegas.  he was "the pastor" of the church, and lived in las vegas.  he said that he would travel to the town on weekends, but he like living in vegas.  here's the problem i am having with all this - i think if you are pastoring a church you need to live in the community the church is located - for me, it's a given.  when we were living in chicago we live across the street from "the lasalle street church" (a "large" church located on lasalle between "moody church" and "moody bible school").  the church was all right, but the pastoral staff did not live in the area - many lived in the suburbs a good hour or two away.  how can one minister to a people, if you don't live with the people?  if we were to send a person to mexico, we would expect them to live in the town they were ministering too - why do we have a different expectation with our pastors here?  i will admit i am still processing all this, and i would love to know what others think - as a postmodern people (pastors) should we live with the people we minister too?  your ideas would be greatly welcomed.

      jon, i agree - the links cause pain.  when we search for what is bad in different faiths, we need to hold a looking class and see ourselves.  we look at the islamic faith and see only the far right, yet we in usamerica (within the christian faith) have the far right (those who claim christianity is for the "white race" - as if there is one - only) to the far left (those who just talk about what needs to be done, and do nothing).  when we look at extremes to define the whole, we miss the point.  we should never see the extreme of anything as the all of anything.   if we look at christianity in usamerican, as an example, we see major problems with the faith that could cause those outside to not want to come in - we speak a good game, but do very little to solve any problems - i know, some will say that over the past many good works have been formed to help with the poor, the hungry, the hurting and the homeless - really?  many of the "chriatian hospitials" are some richest for profit organization around (most are not even owned byn the christian organization they are named for).  we have given billions to "fight hunger, homlessness and cloth the needy" - yet all we did was create huge business' that care more about keeping the structure going then solving the problem.  before we look at the "evils" of those who have a different tradition then we do, we truly need to look into our hearts and clean our own house.   pax

      On the pacifist issue and the current American policy... someone sent me a newsletter looking at ISLAM. I'll quote from it then comment.. ... Islam As A Philosophy by Bryan Hupperts   "Nazism was as much a spiritual movement as it was a political philosophy, yet no one has a problem labeling these goose-stepping, brown shirted goons as ‘bad guys.’ And what did the Nazis believe? They believed in world domination, in the eradication of a specific group of people, specifically the Jews, that it was either "Submission to their way of thinking," .. or death!    "Submission. Oh yeah, that’s what the word  Islam  means. Anyway, we quote the horrible historical statistic that the Nazis murdered 6 million Jews, while forgetting that they also murdered 4 million Gentiles (mostly Christians). While cloaked under a false spiritual guise misusing the name "Christian," they were in fact a spiritual and political philosophy devoted to world domination.    "Quit thinking in terms of tolerance for a moment. Thank God our national leaders during World War II weren’t concerned with being tolerant or we would all be speaking German, Russian, or Japanese! Forget Islam as one of the world’s ‘great religions’, and think of it as a political and spiritual philosophy. Now, if Islam really means ‘peace,’ explain this:    "Muslims are bent on destroying Israel and her allies (meaning they want to exterminate the Jews). So were the Nazis. Muslims also believe that their beliefs need to be exported to the whole world and all people brought under their domination. The Nazis didn’t invade Poland and France for the water! Muslims also believe it is perfectly acceptable to kill non-believers, or to lie to further the cause of ‘jihad’ (holy war). Further, they applaud when their own children are sacrificed ‘in the flames’ of suicide bombings. Come to think of it, so did the Nazis."   There is much about Bryan's argument that is convincing, and of course I haven't included the entire letter here, but there is also much about his position that bothers me.   First, much of his argument applies equally well to fundamentalist Christians. Let's face it, there are hundreds of thousands of American Christians who are quite ready to go to war in the name of Jesus. How are these so different from the Islamic fundamentalists?   Second, his argument paints all Muslims as equally guilty by association with their religion. This simply isn't accurate. It may be politically useful to paint all Muslims as Nazis or as warmongers filled with hate, but it simply is not the reality. When we divide the world into black and white we inevitably leave out a lot of data that doesn't fit our paradigm.   Let's take it from the other side. Currently Bin Laden paints all those in the west as hateful, irreligious, immoral warmongers. Is this accurate? Of course not. There are many who pray for peace, and who do not see imperialism as a good thing. Bin Laden sees America as a Christian nation. Is this accurate? Of course not. Canada and America are secular states, Canada more so.    In the end, freedom of religion, freedom of speech and the separation of church and state are worth preserving. Muslim's have a right to their beliefs and demonizing them as a group doesn't move toward dialogue or understanding.   I read Bin Laden's letter at the  urlLink Observer . There is much distortion in it. But what surprised me were the points where I sympathized.

      when people see you, do they see christ?  i'm not talking about some "metophor" - i'm talking in your face, 100%, in all you do christ.  do they see christ in you?  for those of us who walk in faith we need to remember that it is not what we "say" that defines postmodern christianity, it is what we "do" that defines it.  we have to remember, no matter how much we would like it another way, we are not the only ones defining christianity - theose outside the church are also defining postmodern christianity also.  our goal should be to find common ground, to here the voices of those who are not "insiders" and seek there wisdom.  on a "modern-evangelical" plane, this is impossible, because all we do is defined by us, not others.  but on a postmodern post-evangelical view, this is not only very possible - it should be a requirement.  if we are truly striving to define who we are, we need to see how others see us.  i remember once sitting in a group discussion with a group of people i had just met, and we were all sharing first impressions.  the idea was that we first write down how we saw ourselves - and to as honest as we could.  then, we would share with each other - and the requirement was that we could not get mad at what others said - and let me tell you, i was one pissed puppy.  but then i realized, the way i saw myself was not the way others saw me - i realized that my defination of "john o'keefe" was not the defination of "john o'keefe" others had.  this little experiement opened my eyes and allowed me to change so that who i was, was what others saw -   i think andrew perriman at " urlLink  open source theology  " is doing some every cool stuff, that excites me - and gets me thinking about possibilities.  i have to admit that over the past i did not read his site, for many reasons (mostly i got burned out on reading and needed a break) but i am glad i found it again - and i would suggest all find it again.  it is quikly becoming a "first read" for me in my day.  as i start to develop a deeper undersing of what he is writing - i love it.  now, i will admit that i may not have the whole "open source theology" down, but the idea of having an open source is exciting - sharing the "codes" of our faith so others can help build it - too cool for words.   pax

      there's an old cletic tradition of (what my grandfather use to call) "walking to no place."  the idea was simply to go out for a walk and go where the road leads - of if you want, where off the road leads.  it was a time you could spend with yourself and God - a way of getting closer to both.  sometimes he would disappear for hours.  when asked where he went, he would just smile and say "that's between me and God."  (my grandmother always said he was at the pub)  when he came home he was happier, and seemed at peace in a deep and meaningful way - i wounder if the idea of a labyrinth is the same?  it's worth a walk, it's worth the time to get to know yourself, and who knows, you could get to know God a bit better -   pax

      I was an elder. No more; I just recently resigned because of the subtle and continual dismissive statements thrown my way by the other elders. My ministry model (POMO) was considered an aberration while there’s was considered the norm (modern). Actually I over stayed my time trying to make things work.   On another note I just finished writing a book titled, “ A Mobile Church For E.P.I.C. Times: Moving Across Faith Community Borders ." Leonard Sweet did the Foreword; Andrew Perriman (Open Source Theology and a contributor to this site) wrote the Introduction and Brian McLaren and Sally Morgenthaler did back cover blurbs. Book should be avaliable in 3-4 weeks.

      i'm not sure if i want an "elder" - in the realm of age - in my life.  as of late, all the older people i talk with seem to want to judge me and tell me that what i think and how i feel is wrong.  it's hard to listen to "wisdom" when it is designed to condem and control.  when i speak with elders, i am told how to act, what to think and when to think it.  if i think outside their evagelical reality i am tage a "anti-christian" and ignored.   so, maybe i would rather have a good elder - someone who would guide without judging; someone who will share, without demanding i do everything they say and how they say it.  maybe we are all looking for that elder, the one who cares, the one who loves, the one who listens - more then the one who talks.  maybe, just maybe - when the time comes and we count the clock - we will be the elder's we desire - and not the ones we dread -   pax john

      I'd give about anything for a good elder or two in my life.  Recently I've been participating in some meetings with other local ministry types in which I'm typically the youngest one present (35).  These experiences combined with where I am in life have made me desperately hungry for something like an elder.  There are times when I don't want to talk to anymore peers or young radicals. (frequent these days)  I need wisdom!!  Having said that, an elder, from a biblical perspective, is not merely an old person.  Age is not even the main ingredient.  Let's steer clear of arrogance and make sure we are being equipped to serve in that ministry ourselves, by God's good grace.

      Elders, John Wayne, Gandalf, Mel Gibson.. a metaphorical tour de force  ;)  So how we we value what has gone before without setting our own feet in that fine box of concrete?  I agree we need elders.. in particular, true elders who have not made the mistake of confusing the vehicle and the journey. Its incredible, but there really are some old dudes (and dudesses) out there who are still alive and risking. When you meet them you know them. They are a profound blessing and a witness to the wind that blows where it will.  As for those who are still living in the modern world.. God bless em. Let them live and let their monuments die with them. They won't mind, and we can move on into the new world, mobile and living in tents, not building altars and tabernacles. Or rather, building those things in human hearts..

      re-elders  John Wayne is a symbol of Americanism.  The independent spirit, the do it my way or be blasted into kingdom come.  Because of this pioneer mentality, each generation seems to have the need to seperate itself from previous generations and pioneer a new path instead of improving/extending the old paths.  Even our parents generation, paved a new path and rejected the paths of their fathers, and each generation refuses to admit that they might have errors in their path.  Our generation is even worse, we get tired of a path after a few months.  We have the consumer mentality that every three months everything needs to change.  Top ten songs don't last long, we move on to the newest music, with the coolest beat.  Our gadgets change with the wind, and our culture just keeps reinventing itself.  Growing up in different cultures, I noticed several differences.  One was that each generation didn't feel the need to build brand new paths.  They were content to walk the old paths, just improve or extend their reach.  Much like the farmer, who passes the farm to his son, then passes the farm to his son etc...  The farm is the same, but the tools change as the leader changes.  So I think the problem is not that elders are bad, we've just got an individualistic society that can;t see beyond itself.  The great question is not what kind of elders our parents were, but what kind are we going to be.  In some of the things I hear, and some of the things I see/say it seems that we may be a chip off the old block after all.  When my son hears me rant and rave about the elders around me, then one day he too by learned behavior will probably rant and rave about my selfish ways.  It seems to me that we need to find some Gandalfs (elders).  We need to show our children that their is a legacy that we belong to, and we must continue.  While much has changed the lack of vision beyond our own lives is still alive and well.  Let us find the diamonds amongst the coal and treasure them, but let us not discard the diamonds simply because the coal is in the way.     urlLink Saint Alford

I think this is the case of Hollywood meddling again.    urlLink To quote him:   "This is a movie about love, faith, hope and forgiveness, He died for all mankind. He (Jesus) suffered for all of us. It's time to get back to that basic message. The world has gone nuts. We could all use a little more love, faith, hope and forgiveness."

      Re: Elders  My parents certainly aren't perfect.  But, they aren't pure evil, either.  They are of a modern mindset.  And yet, there is much I have learned from them and much I can still learn from them.  I understand you have been hurt, John.  But, to simply dismiss all that is "modern" as evil and wrong is to miss out on much that is good and worthwhile. Sorting out what is worthwhile from what is waste may be hard work.  But, we owe it to ourselves to not simply dismiss our elders because they are old.

      My guess is that when people start talking about venerating the bones of their ancestors, the statement is only partly an affirmation of the value of traditions, elders, forebears, etc., and shouldn't be taken too literally. More usually it's an attempt to  correct  something that has gone awry in the present - such as an obsessive need to be innovative, trendy, radical, cutting edge, cool, etc., or modern evangelicalism's inability to appreciate anything prior to or outside the Reformation traditions. As for Jody's remarks - when has it ever been different? There has always been a tension between the old and the new, stability and creativity, institution and individual, consolidation and mission. It was true for Israel; it has been true for the church. We have to put up with it. I just thank God that the Spirit constantly renews.

      Re elders: I don't know if it is an American thing or human instinct to build monuments to ourselves...the tradition has been that the current generation of elders builds the next generation's churches to suit the elders, not those who will inherit it.  The music we sing is what the church lay/staff leaders listen to.  The architecture, interior design and location are pleasing to those guiding the process, with little thought given to those it should attract and retain.  A long range plan is a nice way of saying we need to build something and provide the rationalization for the expense...even in economically uncertain times, it is a matter of faith and not the Dow Jones.  Opposing a building program is seen as unfaithful.  But the question becomes: does ministry drive facility or does facility?  The elders I worship with place the facility at the fore with the people development something that will take care of itself...  And as I was raised, I am hard pressed to publically disagree with the elders.  At most deacons meetings, I have sat on my hands because I didn't want to come across as opposing these fine men...and they are.  Many made the sacrifices to start a church years ago in a part of town that no one else would.  They fought in Korea and Viet Nam, they built homes and businesses and were faithful to the church.  They taught my children and myself much of the faith we have today.  I respect them for their work and their wisdom in the past and the present.  But I long to remind them that the Great Commission was to make disciples, not buildings.  Most new Christians have no background in religion and hence the hectic layout of the church (after several renovations and additions), the level of the youth praise band's volume and the use or not of power point are not the big deals...it's all about how the believer re-presents Christ and makes Him relevant and real in their lives.  Maybe children of the Depression like to have the stability and security of brick and mortar around them.  And there are a lot of folks needing to feel the arms of Christ around them.  Abba Father, to speak the truth in love, please help me!  Help he to be respectful and to be willing to hear the other perspectives, to look for your will and not my own idealism/ideology about you.  Father, teach us your people to be the church and not do church!

        our elders?    i had a discussion this weekend with a group of people who are big on "connecting to past generations" so we can learn from them.  but here's the problem i am having with this idea of seeing "elders as all knowing" - they screwed-up so much, what can they truly teach?  how can we look to a "past generation" for "advise" when we think differently?  what can a modern person teach us? (excluding what "not" to do).  i am not sure all this talk about "letting the older generations teach us" is truly valid - maybe if we see it as "learning from their mistakes" i could see it, but then that is more negative then i desire to be - what i have found is that our "older generations" of christians say things like, "you think just like us, except you use different words" - but we don't, a postmodern person does not think as a modern; i do not think like my parents.  i don't think like an evangelical - i use different words, because they have different meanings.  i see things fundermentally different; i start at a different point and i move in a different direction - what can a modern generation teach?  i have found that when people say, "we can learn from past generations" what they mean is  - if they are the past generation, "do as i say."  i am having a rewal hard time processing this idea that we need to respect the generations before us - i think it was len sweet who said (and i am paraphasing) that postmodern people "venerate the bones of our ancestors."  i'm not sure that is true.  just some random thoughts on the subject.  pax

      is community limited by boarders?  is it limited by distance?  is it limited by other physical groupings?  i don't think so.  i think true community transends all that we see and know - we are defining the new, not redefining the old.  community, to me, seems to be a grouping of people who can feel the hearts and minds of others - building friendships based on emotion, not what we look like.  let's be honest, if we were all to meet, before this little exersize in community building, whould we truly be friends?  based on our pasts, and who we know in the "real world" would we select each other as people we wanted to hang out with?  many, when they see me coming, move to the other side of the street - because i look "scary."  so, i wonder - would we all be friends in "the real world?"   and john, i love the buechner quote - killer.  pax

      I think online community is different.  It's certainly not a substitute.  And it's not a shortcut.  But, I know true friendship and true community is possible over the Internet.  Maybe not for all people and maybe not on a large scale.  But, I have a few very close friends now that I met just 18 months ago.  We have been through so much together and they are the guys I turn to when life gets rough.  We pray together.  We share our deepest stories with each other.  We share our fears and our dreams with each other.  When my life came to a crashing halt 1 year ago, these are the guys who stuck by me.  We've never seen each other face to face.  We've never layed on hands in prayer.  But, these men are true friends and pieces of an important community in my life.

      Gosh, how many Johns are there?  I am not John.  Woohooo...  But I'm hearing what you're all saying.  Yea, online communities ARE community of a sort, but very much lacking from the kind of community we experience with the locals.  And yes,  touch  has a lot to do with creating a deeper sense of community.  (Loved the "piece" by the way.)  But I think that in addition to touch, some other things that create more depth of communal relationship are  time  spent together,  doing  things together,  eating  together, helping one another with  physical  needs, and just being in close  proximity  with one another in the good times and the bad.  Online, we can choose to go away when we wish, or not be there if we're just not interested.  When we're working together side by side, we must deal with one another's idiosyncrasies whether we want to or not.  So, the online community can be helpful and enriching, but far from satisfying.  One thing I keep asking myself is:  Am I spending so much time online that I neglect the community around me?   It is often so much easier for me to sit and type in the comfort of my own home, I struggle to get out to be with people.  Not so good.  But, if the sense of community I get here is satisfying some need in me (to talk with people from other frames of reference with different perspectives I might find helpful)...this is some level of important communication.

      john, whihch john is this anyway, i know after posting this, but its hard to tell on the site :)    i agree with you about the level of intimacy you can have through web relationships although there are some pretty cool things that happen.  i had lunch with a friend a few weeks ago and had been reading his blog prior to our meet, and the week before christmas had two people come visit from saint louis and he had read my blog and me his.  what was cool about both meetings was we already knew where to begin, one a person i had known for a while the other brand new.  but for me its the touch that makes the intimacy work, i wrote a  urlLink piece  about it a while back.  i have had many conversations with people about this topic but i still come back to the touching thing.  when we actually feel a person, see their eyes, hair, posture, etc we know them in ways you can never achieve over the net.  i am not sure we will ever be able to replace that i mean touch.  i think its how we are created.

      Good questions. There are definite levels of community. I am a member of my  community  here in Nishinagane-cho (a civic division of about four blocks). But of course being a member of that community comes no where near the sort of community that I find with the people who live in my house. The internet community, for me, is somewhere in between those two. It is enriching and I enjoy it, but I don't think it is any kind of substitute for an actual "touching" community of faith.  I don't feel I can really, deeply get to know a person through the internet, at least I have not yet.

      John and Andrew, I thank you for your dialog.  Several months ago, I was startled by the fervent anti-war stances taken in several of the postmodern web and blog sites, some against the war on a philosophical basis, some against this particular circumstance with Iraq and some pointedly antagonistic of the president.  This old American History major (economic/constitutional/diplomatic emphasis) and currently novice student/participant in postmodernism has probably oversimplified the situation: modernism vs. postmodernism or establishment and anti-establishment.    From the faith side: how do we bring the modern church more into line with the mission that has been diverted by tradition and ease?   In trying to explore this, I have been for the most part humiliated or rejected and have developed an instinctive negative reaction for anything proposed by the "establishment" leadership of the church.  But it is still the body of Christ and seeking to build the kingdom.  I may not be happy with every aspect of the delivery system but it is the bride of Christ...  From the armed conflict side: we don't have enough information to determine if war is "acceptable", therefore we must oppose it until it can prove itself or we will oppose because war is bad.  On the other hand, we don't have all the information but those in positions of authority say there is enough proof to warrant military action.  I am not speaking for blind faith or ideology in automatically agreeing with the leadership of our country...but at a certain point do I rely on their placement as civil authorities and my requirement to obey them?   As believers, of whatever denominational or philosophical bend, are we accurately re-presenting Christ to those who don't know him in our reaction to the war?  Most non-believers describe Christians as being against a lot of things. If we oppose the war, are we being seen as "anti-establishment" or as peacemakers/caregivers?  Should we endorse the military action, then are we being "establishment", anti-Islamic and imperialistic or are we being obedient, proactive and seekers of justice and mercy?  It's late and this is a big issue get one's arms around.  Folks, I don't have the answer.  And I must admit to what could be called a bias...before his election, I had several occasions to work with the man that will make the call.  Personally, I have to factor that in.  I digress...it's not about them or about us, it's about Jesus.  In whatever stance we take, are we, the body, appropriately re-presenting Christ to those who don't know Him?  His reputation must come before our politics.

      John, I know what you mean. I'm inclined to see it simply as a problem of scale - I'm not that sold on the autonomy and inviolability of the nation state. But in the end, isn't it just a question of power? The oppressed are powerless, whether they are children or adults. The West is powerful and is in a position with respect to Iraq to intervene with reasonable prospect of success. Moreover, we often hear it said that as soon as American troops enter the country, the Iraqis, including the military, will rise up against Saddam - in other words, they will step up to the plate as soon as they think they've got a chance of hitting the ball (have I got the metaphor right?). But that remains to be seen.  By the way, is there any difference between a modern and a postmodern theology as far as these issues are concerned? I would have thought a postmodern theology would be less inclined to warmonger. Is that right?

      andrew - i see what you are saying, but could there be a difference between a neighbour and a country?  i would get involved with a neighbour who is abusing they children - but in a country we do not have only chlidren - but adults who can "take control" of the problems themselves.  i am not sure we should jump in, when the people - who are mostly adults - are not steping up to the plate themselves.  how do we figure in this fact with our desire for war?    pax john

      John, that sounds a bit fatalistic to me. If you knew that your neighbour was severely abusing his wife and kids and storing unusually large quantities of ammonium nitrate in his garden shed, would you simply pray that God would use that family for his purposes? Now maybe you're not perfect either; maybe you row with your wife; maybe you're driving your teenage kids up the wall with your ranting about their behaviour; maybe you give your colleagues at work a rough time; maybe you don't always remember to declare everything to the IRS. But does that disqualify you from intervening? Surely God could use you to bring justice to the oppressed and protect the innocent, and then sort you out at a later date? It would be better, of course, if in taking action against an unrighteous and dangerous neighbour you recognized the obligation to act righteously yourself.

      andrew - thanks for the psalms thing - i never knew that.    i understand what you are saying about the idea of a "legitimate" government.  i agree that all governments have problems, and that is my point - we can not see the govenment of iraq as "wrong" - at best we can see it as "different."  we can not judge another, without having that same judgement falling upon us.  our goal should be to pray that God uses iraq for his purposes - and if we get in the way, we are getting in the way of God.   pax

      But John, surely there is no  ideal  legitimate authority - every national government is going to have some skeleton or other in its closet. Paul appears to have regarded Rome as a legitimate authority; but Rome was an idolatrous imperial power, established by force and invasion, which did not hesitate to intervene violently in the internal affairs of subject peoples (including Israel), which came to be perceived as a deeply anti-Christian power, and which ultimately came under divine judgment (Rev.18). It also seems to me that God can use the most unjust and illegitimate of nations to bring about his purposes if he wants to. What happens in the Bible, though, generally is that the unjust instrument of divine judgment also, sooner or later, finds itself judged.  By the way, it was Psalm 82:4 - maybe the author was using a Catholic Bible. The Psalm also has a universal perspective (verses 1 and 8) that may make it particularly relevant in the current circumstances, though usually these references to the poor and needy apply  within the people of God .

      jody - thanks for the post - but i think the author got some things wrong - first their mention of "the us government is a legitimate authority."  is it?  under the principles set forth by the article the author fergets that a revolution is not a "just war" - so, the "battle for independance" of america was "unjust" making america "non-legit."  there is no way around it - the "founding fathers" were not a "legitmate authority."  besides, would not the goverment of iraq be seen as a "legitimate authority?"  the other thing is the authors call to psalm 81:4 has nothing to do with the needy - the author mis-quoted.  81:4 says, "for this is required by the laws of israel; it is a law of the God of jacob."  maybe they figured no one would look?  pax john o'keefe

      I can't claim authorship or research on this...but wanted another perspective. Jody Sneed   We all know how we feel - but this guy took "rules" of a just war provided  by Historical Christian writings and did a check list.  Interesting - may help answer some questions. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Possible war with Iraq - Just or Unjust?  How are Christians to view this possibility?  One thing is certain. Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi leadership have behaved  badly and the regime must stop ... (list of wrongs)  The issue is - what is just.  Does going to war with Saddam Hussein fit the criteria of justice? The most systematic treatment of a just war in antiquity belongs to Thomas Aquinas. In his Summa Theologicae Aquinas outlined what is now considered to be "just war" theory. He not only discussed the justification for war but what activities were permissible in fighting a just war.  From Thomas Aquinas and later writers, these principles have become accepted as "the rules of engagement" for a war that is justified:  Principles of the Just War . A just war can only be waged as a last resort, after reasonable attempts to bring justice have been exhausted. . A just war can only be waged by a legitimate authority. People, vigilantes, terrorists do not wage just wars; only a legitimate government is permitted to wage a war that can be considered justified. . A just war can only be fought to redress wrongs that have been committed.  . A first strike attack on a nation that has committed no atrocities cannot be considered justice; that's aggression. . A just war can only be fought with "right" intentions. War is not justified to gain control of another nation, it's assets or it's people. If the right intention for going to war is not present, justice is not present. . A just war can only be fought if there is a reasonable chance of success. Deaths and injury incurred in a hopeless cause are not morally justifiable. . A just war can only be fought if the ultimate goal is to re-establish peace. More specifically, war is not justified if the situation in a country cannot be reasonably expected to be better after the war than before. . A just war must never allow the force used to be disproportional to the need. Nations must be prohibited from using force not necessary to attain the limited objective of addressing the wrongs that have been committed. . A just war must employ weapons and tactics that discriminate between combatants and non-combatants. Innocent civilians are never permissible targets of war, and war can only be just if every effort is made to avoid civilian casualties.  When you look at these criteria, the United States seems to have a pretty strong case to stop the threat that Saddam Hussein poses to humanity, especially his own people. The US Government is a legitimate authority and does not bear the sword in vain (Romans 13:4). Besides, Psalm 81:4 commands us to "Deliver the poor and needy; free them from the hand of the wicked."  As long as the intention of war with Iraq is to redress wrongs and not to acquire the assets of the country, and as long as required inspection for banned weapons is repeatedly rebuffed, I believe war with Saddam Hussein is both legitimate and just.  Hussein has shown himself to be an evil dictator. He has consistently lied about his chemical and biological weapons program. He has been less than forthcoming when pressed by the UN weapons inspectors, both after the Persian Gulf War and in advance of this one. He has brutally murdered untold Iraqis who have dared to resist him. These facts are indisputable. Without question he fits the description that the Church Father Augustine gave of those who are rightly condemned and against whom war is justifiably waged:  "The passion for inflicting harm, the cruel thirst for vengeance, an unpacific and relentless spirit, the fever of revolt, the lust of power, and such like things, all these are rightly condemned in war." (Contra Faust. xxii, 74).

      Like John, I read Kevin Miller's "PPM” (Proponents of postmodern ministry) rant. It’s unfortunate that the most significant thing said was contained in a mere two sentences.   Brian McLaren, an author of several books on postmodern ministry, writes in his latest that he has "a desire to move beyond a critique of modern ministry (a hobby that can be dangerously preoccupying)." And he and others are beginning to offer something creative and generative.   Instead of following up and providing insight on reconstructive ministry ideas (maybe he didn’t know enough to articulate this point) Mr. Miller sarcastically puts a negative spin on the creativity of this emerging faith community.

      I'm afraid natives are going to have to accept the baton the immigrants pass you; monuments and all. It's unfortunate but it appears that current leadership just doesn't get it; and it doesn't appear that they are willing to consider the future of the next generation of leadership. They're so busy doing ministry indigenous to their time that they are essentially brain dead to your ideas and understanding of ministry. So be ready to inherit the monuments of modernism. Funny how history repeats itself.

      Fred you got to be an elder? man, i never made it that far. i usually was the one to run against the incubant deacon/board member. i played along with the ruse as long as i got to play dress up christianity so i would seemingly be accepted by "normal" folk.  i was once allowed to be a part(or is that apart) of the pastor search committe. i think i lost ground with my"peers" in this conservitive pentecostal church when i said i believed that the day of the shout was no longer relevant and we needed to too look for a teaching pastor. for the rest of my time at that church i was never asked to run again, never asked my opinion, never asked to speak.  it wasn't as if i were asking to sacrifice a goat, or filling the baptismal with jello. i wanted, and still do, to be taught. discipleship is such a foriegn concept to most churches. pastors seem to be more concerned with numbers than with the state of their sheep's souls. on a more positive note: we have found a more progressive church in our area. thatt is no small feat when considering the size of our community(8000 people)  sometimes one voice is too much, other times it's not enough.  peace,   urlLink chuck

Paul calls for the church to not associate with this "believer".....not because he is sinning sexually, but because he is PROUD of it.  i think this would apply in many cases. homosexuals welcome. yes. offered the "new bread of purity and truth" (1 cor. 5.8). yes.

         the issue:  homosexuality     i have been wondering how we deal with the issue of homosexuality in a postmodern church.  are we "opening and accepting?" or  are we "open and transforming?"  Even still, if one postmodern/emerging church says it's ok, and another says it's wrong - is that cool?  do they allow each other to have the same point of view?  if they differ, can they still worship togather, once in a while?  i have heard that the word for "homosexual" should actualy be translated as "pedifile" - i wonder.  it seems to put a new light on the subjest - anyway, what do you think -   pax john

      this all makes me wonder, how do we define evil?  i had a friend who always said, "i don't know what it is, but i know it when i see it."  but that seems just out of place - what is evil, and it it evil if one person does it - and not evil if another person does it?    pax john

       What does true community mean? Does it mean developing the character of Christ in each individual that lives in community?    How do we discern  true community  from  community ?  Hey, I also perfer team leadership, but team leadership (in my thinking) doesn't equal true community. Team leadership can be proactive, reactive, passive, good or bad depending on the character and filters each leader brings to the team. Currently, many faith communities are lead by baby boomers...who often wear modernism's filters. And one of the faliures of modern ministry is the neglect (or possibly a misapplication) of discipleship. For too long we have assumed that a new convert will develop kingdom character—Pray with them, baptize them and they will automatically live by kingdom principles (which are countercultural). God saves him/her...they become part of the (true?) faith community...give them a regular dose of linear, rational preaching & teaching and "presto" they have developed the mind of Christ. We know better. People don't overcome the old life that easy (which by the way is much more natural and easier to live). We have to provide a forum that helps people learn to seek reconcillation instead of legal assistance; to walk the extra mile and to turn the other cheek.   From my experience (—and I am painting with a broad brush here) we still don't do this well. Maybe some communities do…if so I'd love to hear their stories. Modernism created some monsters that will not roll over and die each time we point them out...I see the above paragraph as "one of those monsters."    I guess what I 'm attempting to say is that we're all traveling along this continuum of time and, for me, it's often difficult to see clearly (maybe) because we don't fully understand or see what lies ahead. But as we travel through this POMO tunnel (headed to something else called another era) we all encounter the remnants of modernism. All transitions must put up with remnant of the past (especially early on---the further into the tunnel we travel the fewer leftovers). Remember the Jews who wanted to carry circumcisions into a new era?    So my point: maybe we talk "emerging and new era" but (unknowingly) continue to practice much of our ministry in a modern context. What say you?

      This is just about relevant to the preceding posts. The Archbishop of Canterbury gave a talk on Benedictine holiness today at Trinity Church on Wall Street entitled 'God's Workshop'. The text is  urlLink here , but you should also be able to access the webcast from the home page. It's worth reading, partly because Rowan Williams is cleric  du jour  for a lot of people, but also because there seems to be a widespread feeling that there is a lot that the postmodern church could learn from monasticism.  A couple of reasons for this hunch suggest themselves. One is that the monastic disciplines are rule-based rather than personality-driven - they provide an escape from, or at least an alternative to, modern leader-centred ministry. Another is that we are, many of us, acutely aware of our lack of spiritual depth - a lot of techniques, yes, and some facility with spiritual gifts, but not a lot of depth. Perhaps Fred's paradox arises partly from seeing pastoral care as curative, therapeutic, rather than as a community-based journey into spiritual depth and maturity. I'm sure we need to mend the damage that has been done to people, but real healing may come from developing an  alternative way of being  that in itself both restores the soul and offers a credible and useful spiritual resource for contemporary society.

      Not sure I see a paradox, but I do see the need for a different frame.. so how's this..  Faith communities that don't utilize team leadership aren't really "communities" but corporations, with hierarchical structure. No wonder growth is numerical (crop rotation) rather than by conversion, transformation, and going deeper (organicly.. deeper roots, internal growth).  But where there is a team, and where there is true community as well as real mission, we have something more in line with Eph.4. And notice the context of Eph4, a passage where we usually talk about gifts and leadership, is community. I think Pauls real message here is often neglected.. it is the wholeness of the body that is in view, and not a map for leadership. But hey. if we leader types are self-focused, what's new?  Here is a nugget from Jim Wallis 20 years back showing the dynamic of nurture and vision.  "Both vision and nurture are key to community. Without nurture, a community will soon exhaust itself in pursuit of the vision. WIthout vision, a community will become stuck in self-preoccupation and travel in circles. With only vision, a community soon loses any quality of love. With only nurture, the community soon forgets what its love is for.."

       Conflicting Leadership Styles  Consider this paradox  ...Faith communities lead by ministers who are "pastoral types" generally don't grow, but you can't grow unless you care for people. (Crop rotation doesn't count as growth) If a community becomes a spiritual hospital, focused primarily on bandaging wounds--it tends not to develop the muscular faith necessary to engage the postmodern world. I wonder--are pastoral care and visionary leadership incompatible?   Comment & Question:  I authored a blog titled  "Grace A wakening"  I discontiunued that blog at the end of 2002. I am ready to begin blogging again...but I need someone to help me design a cool looking blog...anyone have a contact for me?

         back in the loop:     well, i have been "out" for a while - healing with my daughter and our friends.  one thing that i have come to in all this is that when life bites, sometimes it is best to say nothing.  i have found that the ones who have effected me the most are those who have just prayed for us and did not try to "explain" way the pain.  but that is central, i believe, to a postmodern community of faith.  sometimes, noting is everything and less is more.  as we look to developing emerging communities of faith, let us keep the connect in our hearts and minds - and always remember that God is true and real and He needs no help from us in the healing - well, he may waht us to change a bandage every now and them - but the healing is in His hands.   as we define "community" how do you see the interaction of those who are hurting with those who "are not" (i tend to think that everyone is hurting, just that some are willing to admit it)?  as we strive to become a "new kind of christian" (sorry brian for stealing) how do we define that in terms of healing and helping?   pax john

      Something I posted on my blog this morning that I thought this group might find of interest:  urlLink Postmodernism is dead  (Props to  urlLink YouthSpecialties  for the find.) This essay contains much food for thought, but the gist of it is:   Postmodernism, then, was about the deconstruction of the dominant institutions of the Modern and the discrediting of the corresponding metanarratives that gave life to a host of real and perceived social injustices. While PoMo certainly nurtured some excesses, there's a good argument to made that it was a necessary phase in Western society's evolution toward stronger and more productive modes of social organization.    So, what's next? The Network Age, according to the author of this essay.   If we think about our lives here in the early moments of the 3rd Millennium, we can probably see any number of ways in which we're part of an emerging networked social order, and the network itself serves as the best metaphor I can think of for where we are and where we're going now that the big deconstruction is behind us. From a technological and social standpoint, few things have exerted as massive an impact on Western culture over the past few years as the Net - the result of spectacular parallel developments in personal computing and electronic communications. In some cases our migration into the network has been conscious and explicit. E-mail, for instance, has provided us with an easy and inexpensive means for staying in touch with friends and family, in many cases including people we had simply lost touch with before e-mail. The Web is now a primary source for news, to say nothing its role in helping foster communities of interest. Whether you're looking for barbecue recipes, researching vacation sites, seeking people who can provide information about a rare condition your child has been diagnosed with, investigating dog breeds, searching for clues about your family's genealogical past, discussing the merits of the new Peter Gabriel CD, or whatever, there has arguably never been a technology more ideally constructed for the exchange of information and ideas than the network.   In other cases, our colonization by the Net has been hidden from our view. The fact is, in most developed areas of the planet, it's nearly impossible not to be shaped by the network unless you have adopted a highly informed and aggressive opt-out strategy (ie, living in a cave). If you have an ATM card, you're a citizen of the largest network in the world. Driver's license? Credit card? Home loan? Student loan? Discount card for your local grocery store? If you have any of these, you're in the network. Give facial recognition technology another five years and you'll be assimilated by simply appearing in public without a mask.      For better or worse, contemporary culture is network culture, and it's important to understand that network culture is by nature distributed culture. Modernism was about centralization, but the Network is decentralized - it is ubiquitous and omnipresent, although no less rigorously structured. Our relationships with institutions were once conducted around the site of the monolith - the bank, the church, the school, the county courthouse, these were all physical places and to transact business with the agency in question, you had to transport yourself to the physical address of the institution. In today's corporate lingo, we might say that these official relationships were "institution-centric." Networked, distributed culture, though, is "citizen-centric" (though we'd do more justice to the actual character of the relationship with the term "customer-centric"). The locus of these organizational interactions depends less on the address of the building where the offices are and more on our IP addresses. The institution is everywhere there's a terminal, a critical distinction in understanding that the Network Age is polylithic in nature. This suggests profound implications for the makeup of organizations, because now you can be an active participant in any number of social activities without having to centralize yourself. A congregation of 1000 people can share a worship service from 1000 separate locations, for example.   This piece is definitely worth reading and thinking about.

      my rant.  apologies to aaron, but what you posted was a little too familiar, heard it coming out of my mouth not too long ago.  i'm sick of being sick.  i'm sick of my passion for the kingdom of god expressing itself as judgement and disapproval of others who are just stupid people like me trying to somehow manifest christ to a broken world.  i'm sick of being called on it, and having to admit that i am wrong.  most of all i am sick of the feeling of seperation between those who "get this whole emergent thing" and the rest of the church.  my brain still thinks that it is time to re-imagine what it means to be the people of christ in a postmodern age.  but why is it making me sick?

      rant: i'm sick of other pastors. i love them, don't get me wrong. but, why can they not be true to what God asks them to do, be themselves, and let their church function as God gives them the church (people)?   there are 2 things that never fail  to happen when i am in a group of "ministers". really, this is no church in particular. really.  1. "they" always try to  "use"  our people to promote their programs. this is exponentially multiplied if other Bridgers are present with me.  example : yesterday i took 2 of our guys to lunch with a bunch pastors -- i sat in the middle. on either side of each of them, they were being heavily recruited to help another churches program (one-guitar; one-keyboard). i am kingdom-minded, but this stuff is silly, and it always happens.  2. "they" have always just started some "alternative" worship service, and it is always "just like what you guys are doing". yeah, right.    it's probably better.  it's probably better planned, more pollished, and has better, more relevant, hipper teaching. (i  know  the band isn't better, though.) but, what we do is out of the gifting that God has given us, and the conviction that church is the people, serving is the essence, loving others is NOT optional, being real is the only honest way to be on the journey, the worship gathering is the  overflow of Christ  in our lives, and our substance and style is as honest as we can be before God. so, i'm glad they start something  like  ours--too bad their  overflow  and  honesty   isn't worthy enough for their main worship gathering.

      when we think of community - do we see a people in action, or a people in stagnation?  you see, i have been thinking lately (too much time on my hands) that if we actuly got off our "pews" and started to truly do some work in faith we actuly could solve some social problems - we could actually help people get their lives in order - and would that not be cool?  instead, we like to talk about it - and do nothing (except write a check) - so, is community verb or a noun?   pax

      For most of my life I've thought of myself as a radical. With my discovery that postmodernity and premodernity fit my perspective more than modernity, and judging by the reaction of some local friends to this part of my journey, I still fit the category.  Then again.. I am hopeful that more will join me. The root of radical is radix, meaning root.. and getting to the root of meaning, the root of culture and the basic realities of the inbreaking reign of God is where I want to be.  But is being radical really so.. well, radical?  And is even deconstruction really all that new? At least in some aspects, I don't think so.   It seems to me that the gospel must always be recontextualized for each generation, and that each generation has to reach back to the roots. Otherwise, the cultural accommodatoins and accretions of centuries eventually bury the message under human detritus.  Way back in the 11th century, after years of walking in the way of Jesus, and deconstructing the lost jewels of the kingdom all around him, Francis of Assisi was on his deathbed. To his brothers he said,  "Let us begin again. For as yet we have done nothing."

      Postmodernism is dead? Really?  I know that in the aesthetics world, postmodern art belongs in the 1980's. Fair enough. We moved from shading and darkness and smudgies (postmodern) to continuity, crisp distinctions and compositions. Very well. But what about church? I am guessing that most of the people writing these blogs attend or lead churches that are structured with a high modern style, manage them with a top down, hierachical, leadership model, and try to communicate knowledge with a strong enlightenment bias. At least in the world of ecclesiology, we have a long way to go. Is it possible that the Americans are coming to the table LATE . . . and then leaving before dessert? Just thinking out loud.

      Reading  urlLink deepdirt , when I came to the comment about being perceived as the ghost-in-the-machine.  I stopped, something about that catalyzed with the emotions/thoughts which resulted in the rant I posted here.  I've been bugged about how hard it can be,  to be "emergent" and in relationship with those who don't care at all what Bruggerman or Caputo think.  Something about the language of the postmodern dialog drives a wedge between people who are exploring postmodernity and those who dont' care about it.  I'm guessing that the divisive underrcurrent in the terminology of the dialog was probably purposeful and useful on the epistemological battelfields.  In the church, where winning arguments is less important than loving Christ by loving each other, maybe there is another language we could use to talk about these things, a set of nouns and verbs which are less judgemental of what has come before.  Maybe the first thing we need to re-imagine is postmodernity.  -Michael

      Tuesday night I had the opportunity to connect with a friend and mentor about an upcoming opportunity he has been offered.  He has been asked if he would be willing to be interviewed, along with a couple others, for a large christian organization's study on church planting.  What question will the interview attempt to tackle?   "What is a successful church plant?"   When he told me, we shared a short laugh as our minds began to revel in cynicism.  But on another level, I think we began to grieve a bit. Beyond what we know of this organization and what it is attempting to do by gathering and cataloguing information from practitioners, I think we felt a bit frusterated.  I foresaw, in the pending interview, that feeling of frusteration that you get when someone attempts to interpret what you said into the answer that they  hoped  you had said.  So we began to discuss the hypothetical interview, and I discovered something that I had not expected to: there is no such thing as a successful church plant--in any measurable sense.  The first question that needs to be answered in order to give the conversation context, is "What is a church?"  And that, I fear, is a question too large and distrubing for the interviewer to ask.   The questions that will be asked will discuss size, property, leadership, and finances.  Things that can be quantified systemically, and arranged in boiler-plate "cookie cutter" templates, for others to go out and lay across their environment in order to "accomplish" a church start up.  As we discussed this interview, two polar camps of thought arose--the belief in "arriving" at success, and the belief that one never "arrives".  Those in the first camp analyze their systems for efficiency, arranging and rearranging their storefronts like merchants, attempting to find the right combination for maximum attractiveness and effectiveness.  The latter camp of thought, to which I personally subscribe, holds personal and communal transformation(something that cannot be manufactured through processes) as the dominant priority of our activities within community life.  In this reality, an unsettling revelation creeps in--the one and only medium of transformation, in any lasting and fruitful sense, is the work of the Creator in the hearts of people we share life with.  That being true, the greatest thing we can do in our communities to aid that interaction is to provide an environment of belonging--so that those experiencing Christ and those who've yet to experience Him share the same space.    It was the first time I'd actually realized that I don't believe in success in terms of communal life--ongoing or initiating--outside of equipping our communities to love and enabling them to live as true reflections of Christ incarnate.  Or at least I don't believe that success for those communities is measurable.  Organizations have both success and failure.  They are measured by parameters set in accordance with goals and vision.  Their systems can be altered, rearranged to produce different outcomes.  True organisms do not have success or failure.  Instead, they are living and breathing; and whatever cyclical aspects of life and death, fruitfulness and pruning they grow through, they are neccessary and unavoidable.    The only way to reproduce an organism is from within.  You cannot analyze an organism and copy its physiology and interaction with the world around it.  Should you attempt that, you will only manufacture a cheap robotic imitation, incapable of reproducing life.

      One of my big problems with all the talk about POMO is a lack of definition to what it really is. I want the best representation of Postmodernism put forward.  urlLink Modern Reformation  did an interview with Richard Rorty, a postmodern philosopher, about his views. Here are a couple quotes:    MR: How would you define truth in contrast to the ways we have usually thought about it?    RR:  I think that it is a mistake to try to define the word "true." We call beliefs true if we think ourselves justified in holding them. Justification is relative to particular audiences and circumstances. There is no such thing as absolute, unchallengeable justification (though, of course, there is such a thing as absolute, unshakable conviction). But since truth is an absolute notion (we don't say "true for you, but not for me" or "true then, but not now"), you cannot define truth in terms of justification. Nor can you define it any other useful way, as far as I can see. If one says, for example, "true beliefs are beliefs that correspond to the way things really are," this is entirely unhelpful, since we have no test for how things really are apart from the test of whether we are justified (by our current lights, given our present circumstances, to certain audiences) in describing them in a certain way. The very absoluteness of truth makes it an indefinable and unanalyzable notion.   Confused? Don't feel bad, it's just a subjective feeling. The thing he doesn't even address is objective truth-- something that is true whether or not is recognized as true. As one of the  urlLink atheist bloggers  I read said, "An objectively true statement is one that is true regardless of whether it is believed. A subjectively true statement is one that [is] true simply because it is believed."     MR: You've made some intriguing comments about Christian theologians and churches selling out robust versions of Christianity in exchange for cultural clout. Do you find, as an outsider looking in, that this contributes ironically to its irrelevance?    RR:  No, I'm delighted that liberal theologians do their best to do what Pio Nono said shouldn't be done -- try to accommodate Christianity to modern science, modern culture, and democratic society. If I were a fundamentalist Christian, I'd be appalled by the wishy-washiness of their version of the Christian faith. But since I am a non-believer who is frightened of the barbarity of many fundamentalist Christians (e.g., their homophobia), I welcome theological liberalism. Maybe liberal theologians will eventually produce a version of Christianity so wishy-washy that nobody will be interested in being a Christian any more. If so, something will have been lost, but probably more will have been gained.    This was highly convicting. Most "postmodern evangelicals" are liberal theologians in disguise. Ironically, they are welcomed by our secular philosophers.

      When the Okanagan Mountain Park fires were first raging near Kelowna, one of the earliest impressions I had was of the natural cycle of regeneration. I remembered a special I had seen on the American National Parks system in 1989 where the ecologists and forestry specialists recalled that before the days of managed forests, fires were part of a natural cycle. When European settlers arrived, our interests focused on control and management; we were concerned with safety, and with economics.   But like other kinds of interference in natural processes, we were messing with mystery. We were out of our depth, but convinced that we knew best. The natural seven to ten year cycle of small fires ended. The result was a build up of fuel, and old and disease ridden forests. We were profoundly conservative, and ignored the risks of that conservatism.   When fires are allowed to occur naturally and more frequently, the result is renewal and regeneration. Small fires have less fuel to use, and are not as hot. As a result, they tend to stay near the ground and don't make their way to the crown of the tree. Bark has a certain resistance to fire, in particular the thick bark of pine trees. There are usually few branches down low, and so a cooler fire is less likely to make it to the crowns of trees, where it can be fanned by the wind and do the most destruction.   Furthermore, a cooler fire doesn't destroy the ability of the tree to reproduce. And it doesn't harm the soil, killing important bacteria and destroying nutrients.   I wonder.. if the church was less concerned with self-preservation.. if we were less concerned with management and control... if we were concerned with love and transformation and not conservation... would we experience a natural cycle of death and rebirth? Would we remain more in touch with our culture, changing and adapting to changing times? Would we have experienced less destruction when change finally came? Would we have healthier family (community) systems?   Thankfully, God remains sovereign (see also Job 7:14 and following) and the cultural shaking that is occurring is resulting in the death of an old system and the birth of a new and healthier one. We are returning to our roots. We are less concerned with management and control and security, and more concerned with life. But the cost to get here has been immense, and could have been so much less if we had been less afraid of change.   I have had an image in mind as I wrote these words. The image is a painting of a pine tree by a local brother named John Revill. It's hard to convey the impact this picture made on me the first time I saw it. John had stopped by to visit and brought the newly finished picture with him. It was as if I was looking beyond the tree itself to God's idea of the pine tree. I saw the truth of it; it's deep beauty and purpose. The tree seemed to have an inner light. John's ability to work with a variety of media and textures was powerfully evident... the image itself seemed alive.   It calls to mind Psalm 1..   How blessed is the one  who does not walk in the way of the wicked, Nor stand in the way of the sinner, Nor sit in the seat of the scoffer.. For he will be like a tree  Planted by streams of water, Which yields its fruit in its season, And its leaf does not wither..

      The following is a research paper I wrote for my pastor on postmodernism. It's long, poorly written, and I don't expect you to finish it. But maybe you can help me if I misrepresented aonyone's views.    Introduction   When being asked to define postmodernism, I just sort of blink with apprehension, because it’s like being asked what color is a rainbow? Many people don’t realize that the way people think has changed from intellectually categorizing certain essential distinctives, to experiencing a variety of… well… experiences. Reminiscent of The Matrix, my glib reply is "I know what postmodernism is, but I can’t explain it to you. You will have to see it for yourself.” Obviously, postmodernism is very frustrating to many people, and is usually received with suspicion and skepticism. In this essay I will attempt to demonstrate that postmodernism is not indefinable, nor is it something to fear. I will explain by historical and philosophical methods how postmodernism came about, what it is, and how Evangelical Christians can respond. My hope is that after reading this essay postmodernism will be viewed as a very interesting and challenging way of thinking about and relating to God.   Let’s go back to the rainbow analogy. A rainbow is comprised of many different colors. No one color can be used to describe it. It is, in itself, a symbol of diversity that displays a colorful image of different colors, not mixed, but alongside one another. This is a key idea to understanding postmodernism. Modernism, if you will, has become just another color in the rainbow. Now, ironically, many modern Evangelicals, or modern thinkers for that matter, don’t even know what the word "modernism" means.    What the Heck is Modernism Anyway?   In the Christian context, the word " urlLink modernism " was used by Pope Pius X to describe the endeavor to reconcile the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church with the conclusions of modern science. It was a methodology of thought in which certain Biblical questions, apologetics, and the theory of dogma would be validated by rational, scientific explanation.  The Enlightenment, represented by  urlLink Descartes  and  urlLink Hume , along with  urlLink Galileo  and  urlLink Sir Isaac Newton , brought forth a type of thinking that was purely rational and scientific. The scientific method and pure rational thinking became the authorative way in which we came to know truth (Epistemology). If you had no empirical proof of what you thought was true, you were treated with skepticism. This, of course, has been around even before the Enlightenment. St. Thomas Aquinas’  urlLink works  are written with very little style or creativity, because his aim was to be as scholarly as possible in his approach to whatever questions came his way, and of course, we know Aquinas was heavily influenced by the logical realism of Aristotle.    What these philosophers were trying to accomplish in there thinking was the goal of laying down objective foundations.  urlLink Stanley J. Grenz  says, "The Enlightenment epistemological foundation consists of a set of incontestable or unassailable first principles on the basis of which knowledge can proceed. These basic beliefs must be universal, objective, and discernible to any rational person". One of the foundational beliefs of the modern age was in science, and it was crowned as the method in which all things can become known. The most widely accepted position of the modern era was scientific naturalism, in which spirituality became nominal and superstitious (see  urlLink David Hume ).    A Little History   How this relates to the Church is hugely important. After Aquinas we had Luther’s reformation and after the reformation the church fragmented into what we now call "denominations" that either became liberal, or conservative. The conservative denominations were able to agree on five fundamental truths that were articulated in a series of booklets called  urlLink The Fundamentals  published around 1909. The articles were written to identify the foundational doctrines of Christianity that were, at the time, under heavy scientific scrutiny. The five foundations were The inspiration and infallibility of the Bible, The deity of Christ, the substitutionary atonement of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, and the second coming of Christ. Liberal and conservative theologians disputed these foundations heavily for the next decade, until the great earthquake of Darwinism rocked the religious community.  During the 1920’s fundamentalist Christians were publicly humiliated by the Scope’s Monkey trial. Scopes was a public school teacher in Tennessee where you couldn’t teach anything that was against Biblical creationism. He taught evolution and therefore broke the law and was brought to trial in 1925. The case drew huge attention, and even though Scopes lost the case, the fundamentalist Christians came across embarrassingly ignorant and public opinion drove Christians from the public square and they stayed quiet until the 1980’s ( urlLink Blinded by Might ). It was not until Jerry Falwells’ Moral Majority delivered a crushing blow to its political opponents that forced the public once again to deal with Christians. It seemed as though utopia would return, morality would be legislated, and God would eventually win back the heart of society. The problem was, the people’s thinking had changed, and the church had not.   In the 1960’s and 70’s growth in Para church organizations like Campus Crusade for Christ, the Navigators, and the Jesus People exploded, and they took traditional churches by surprise. The movement was unlike any they had ever seen. People, like my parents and my pastor, were meeting in small dorm-rooms or apartments, breaking the bread and singing worship songs with nothing more than a guitar. They would reach out to people in a variety of ways, helping people move, inviting their friends to diner, and yes, by cold-turkey evangelism. There is actually a documented movement in the late 60’s and early 70’s called the " urlLink Jesus Movement " where hundreds of thousand of people were saved.  There were all kinds of movements in the 60’s and 70’s that marked the very beginning of the postmodern movement we see in full fledge today. What was this revolution all about? What were they revolting against? There is a myriad amount of answers to these questions, but in short, it was against the sterile and traditional modern approach to life. People didn’t want to wait until marriage to have sex, people didn’t want to live in the block communities of suburban America, women didn’t want to live in the home baking brownies, men didn’t want to go to work eight hours a day in a suite and tie, and people didn’t want to grow up having the same unspiritual life, going to a church affiliated with some irrelevant denomination.    A Little Philosophy   The type of revolution society was going through was the great earthquake the modernism, and it was no surprise. In fact it was foreseen by a philosopher named  urlLink Frederick Nietzsche . Nietzsche is best known for the atheistic aphorism, "God is dead," but not known for why he said such an offensive thing. His philosophy, in my opinion, sheds light on what exactly happened during the great philosophical earthquake of the 60’ and 70’s, and he has also had large influence on the postmodern thought of today. Let me state now, I go out on a limb with this thesis. I am not a philosophy major, nor do I have any ordained merit, but I find too much in common with Nietzsche’s ideas and our current state postmodernism.  Nietzsche was very influenced by the philosophy of nihilism.  urlLink Alan Pratt  defines it pretty well, "Nihilism is the belief that all values are baseless and that nothing can be known or communicated. It is often associated with extreme pessimism and a radical skepticism that condemns existence." In my opinion Nietzsche wasn’t a nihilist, but a victim of it, though he desperately tried to fight it. The encyclopedia also stated, "Nietzsche argued that its [nihilism’s] corrosive effects would eventually destroy all moral, religious, and metaphysical convictions and precipitate the greatest crisis in human history." Nietzsche agreed with Ludwig Feuerbach’s teaching that God was merely a being postulated by projected human reflections ( urlLink Robert Solomon ). In other words; monotheism was created in the image of man.  urlLink Eugene Rose  comments, "The type of god fashioned by men was not the omnipotent Creator of all revealed in the person of Jesus Christ,  the God who could raise the dead . On the contrary the fashioned god is a mere human idea, not revealed to faith and humility but constructed by the proud mind that still feels the need for 'explanation' when it has lost the desire for salvation. This is the dead god of the philosophers who only require a 'first cause' to complete their systems…"  This type of reasoning made Nietzsche insists that there is no absolute foundation that can be known apart from our perspectives. He  urlLink writes , "there are no facts, only interpretations." Also, in  urlLink The Will to Power , he writes, "That there is no truth; that there is no absolute state of affairs—no ‘thing-in-itself.’  urlLink Eugene Rose  added, "This alone is Nihilism of the most extreme kind." Nietzsche despised anything that was dogmatic or claimed to have unassailable authority. He threw out the philosophy of metaphysics (the idea of true, transcendent being, i.e. God, absolutes), and instead brought forth an epistemology called "perspectivism."  Perspectivism teaches that the more perspectives one has, the closer to the truth one becomes. There are many perspectives. There is a religious perspective, a moral perspective, a scientific perspective, and an aesthetic perspective. A good example of perspectivism is in our poetic descriptions. It is better to say:    Her beauty is so captivating  That the very light she gently reflects  Is blessed beyond words  Before it can express her wonder To my eye     instead of saying, "She weighs 107 pounds, has blond hair, blue eyes, and has such and such measurements." The measurements may be a more descriptive and accurate way of describing the girl, but expresses little in how the beholder  relates  to her.  Nietzsche’s approach isn’t entirely deconstructive. He goes forth his notorious, " urlLink Will to Power " philosophy which can best summarized by saying people act in accordance with there desire for value, esteem, worth, and strength. He encourages people to "create themselves" like an artist would create artwork.  His philosophy is very experimental, individualistic, and revolutionary. It rejects all that is held true and valued, and seems to promise liberty through what is forbidden and contemptible; that is our own self-actualization.  Two postmodern philosophers, in particular, carried on the Nietzschean tradition.  urlLink Rorty  drops the notion of an absolute truth for his own ideas of  urlLink pragmatism .  A pragmatist has no absolute theory of truth but holds that our knowledge and beliefs help us cope and negotiate with reality. He advocates that the point behind any theory of truth is to help us decide what is good to believe. Rorty thinks his ideas of pragmatism covers him from the irrational position of relativism, but his views are marginalized by his own philosophy of liberal ironism. A liberal ironist is one who does not think his own ideas of his view of the world are right in that they correspond with some reality that is foundational. The ironist is committed to promoting a society in which there is a harmonious dialogue of our views with a growing circle of people. The irony, so to speak, is that Rorty can only believe and state that his view is better than others, but it is not necessarily true ( urlLink also see D.A. Carson ).   To the other postmodern philosopher,  urlLink Michel Foucault , truth is not something that is uncovered, but some thing that is fashioned by men. No one simply knows truth, but truth is known for something. This type of thinking can become very deconstructionist and aims to find the ulterior motive for power behind every theory of truth. Take today’s politics for example. A political leader my state something true about the state of the nation, but it is written off by his opponents because the truth he is advocating is not for the truth itself, but for his agenda. Foucault follows Nietzsche in the Will to Power doctrine that one must become free from the indoctrination of what we are, and in turn, "become oneself" to have value. He worked this method out in the arena of sexuality. He believed that there is no one way to understand or practice sex (he was gay), and all that is taught about sex is induced from a societal power struggle to contain mans inner freedom of sexual expression.17 Foucault died of AIDS in 1984 ( urlLink also see D.A. Carson ).   So What is Postmodernism?   Again,  urlLink Grenz  sheds light on this muddled goop by clarifying, "Postmodern thinkers maintain that humans do not view the world from an objective vantage point but structure their world through the concepts they bring it." In light of the ideas put forth by Nietzsche Rorty, and Foucault, we can construe three main tenets (or pillars) of postmodernism, and they work dialectically. First, we have nihilism; an indifference towards truth, a disintegration of value, and a vague sense purposelessness are at its root. Second, we have perspectivism; nothing can really be known in the absolute sense, yet truths still can be discerned for reasons relative to the given point of view. Third, we have the perfect product of the former two, pluralism. Pluralism is everyone’s friend in that it states that there are choices, choices are good, and no choice is superior to another. A classic example of such thinking came from the mouth of  urlLink Bishop Melvin Talbert  of the United Methodist Church when he responded to Larry King about his religious beliefs, "I believe my God is large enough to be inclusive of all human beings who were created in God's image and that includes those religions that are not Christian." He later added in response to a rebuttal, "For me, salvation in Jesus Christ is the way, and what I try to do as a Christian is to live that example. My responsibility is not to convert all other religions, but to live the Christian faith in the face of those religions.  Are you going to say that my -- our friend on the show tonight who is Jewish is on the wrong path?  That's God's choice. That's God's judgment, not mine." (Italics added for emphasis) That statement is the culmination of all three of these philosophies. Talbert is indifferent towards the traditional Christian belief that Jesus is the exclusive way to God, he speaks from his own perspective (i.e. the words "For me"), and carefully includes all other "ways" to God as being equally valid.  Tolerance is the single most important, if not absolute, virtue of postmodernism. Go back to my description of postmodernism being like a rainbow. No one color makes up the rainbow, but the diversity of colors. Diversity (not necessarily unity) is the highest value in the postmodern ethos. The more points of view we have, the better grasp we will have on truth. The more ideas that are included the more appealing the philosophy will be. The more ethnicity we have in society, the better the society will be.  The more inclusive the religion, the more spiritual it is. This is where people make the mistake of rushing to condemn postmodernism, when really what they are condemning is a consequence of it.  What postmodernism has at its heart is a critical agenda. It goes after whatever claims to have an infallible knowledge, even science. Science no longer has, or never had, adequate answers to questions as to Why are we here? Who are we? How shall we live? People want a deeper sense of truth than the facts, appearances, or even their own experiences. Things that were formally rejected, like religion, spirituality, mysticism, and "other (eastern) religions," are more accepted than ever, and whatever the ethnocentric mainstream was is rapidly waning.  urlLink Greg Boyd  sees the advantages of this:   At the same time, however, this postmodern perspective has served to expose the narrowness and arbitrariness of the Enlightenment assumption that reality can be exhaustively defined and understood by empirical categories. Postmodernism has been helpful in revealing the arrogance involved in the modern, Western, chronocentric, elitist, intellectual tendency to dismiss every other worldview that has ever existed as "primitive" and "superstitious."   The playing field has been leveled.   Obviously, this is can be very confusing. Rationally speaking, people would not want a "choice" when it comes to the absolute certainty of things. People don’t want to be presented with a choice of different kinds of medicine that will ale their sicknesses, they want be presented with the right medicine that will cure them. But at the same time, however, people are in a state of nihilism. Nothing we choose really matters. What are we to do? In my view, people believe what they think matters. People want to be told the truth, they want meaning and significance, and they want to make a difference. They want something real, true, and authentic, but they find themselves unable to know if anything is real. Ironically, people find themselves in a constant crisis of faith; will they believe in what they think is real or will they doubt. If we only read our Bibles and paid attention to Paul when he says we live by faith, not by sight.   Response and Adaptation   Lets go back to the time of the 60’and 70’s and examine the Christian culture when my pastor came to Christ. At a leader’s meeting, He retold the story of his upbringing in Christianity, the rejection of it, his conversion, and the fellowship he had with believers. His upbringing in a rural Baptist setting, where everyone knows each other, is typical of central Iowa. His rebellion against the church/religion was most likely inspired by the tremendous hypocrisy he saw in the lives of his family members and neighbors. After God got his attention through a number of unusual near-death experiences, he got involved with a group of Christians that called themselves the "Jesus People". He recalled the genuine love they had for each other, the relevant worship music, and their piously authentic ceremonies of baptism and breaking the bread. It was a group of people who were genuine in their beliefs and truly loved the Lord. This was a great example of a postmodern Christian experience.  Many people at the  urlLink Rock  experience the same things. You hear so many testimonies about an upbringing in a semi-Christian environment, disillusionment with religious people and the church, rebellion, repentance, and a new refreshing experience with people of the same age living in true communion with God. However, this is not something new or necessarily "postmodern."  urlLink Augustine  tells of a similar story of his conversion in the Confessions. Also Soren Kierkegaard, the father of the philosophy know as Existentialism, went through the same experience very dramatically.   Just before Nietzsche was born (1844),  urlLink Soren Kierkegaard  also saw the horrible effect modernism had on Christianity. Growing up in Denmark under the extremely strict religious education imposed on him by his father, Kierkegaard developed an absolute contempt for what he condescendingly called "Christendom." He didn’t hate God, or the teachings of Christ, but what the church had become. In one of his more outrageous  urlLink journal entries , he writes, "Christianity does not exist." Also, in  urlLink The Attack upon Christendom , he also writes, "New Testament Not True." At first glance, he sounds heretical, but he develops a very funny sense of irony, poking fun at the complacency of his social era’s lack of real faith. He would sarcastically comment about how in Denmark, "everyone was a Christian", and on the wide path to heaven instead of the straight and narrow. No one was on the wide path to destruction, for how could they be? The Danish church was a state church that you were born into; you were born Christian. You would go to church and the priest would lecture about faith and the sacraments and that would make you a better Christian. Kierkegaard hated this. He developed a deep contempt for this superficiality and went through his own time of empty rebellion while he was in college. However, he became extremely depressed and found little solace in the wild social life he partook in. He turned incredibly inward, and in his profound inwardness he became intensely individualistic and reflected much on why he existed and for what existence he had to live for himself. Hence, he became the founding figure of existentialism. In this mode of thought, he became conscious of certain absolute truths that he had to make choices about, and how he related to them. (see  urlLink Phillip Cary )  The first truth he had to face is that we must make a choice. Second, each person, as an individual, must choose between God and the world. An atheist does this, as well as a Christian. He writes, "This is the eternal, unchangeable condition of choice that can never be evaded—no, never in all eternity." To Kierkegaard, even if a postmodern pluralist were to say, "God and the World aren’t absolutely different," this would be refraining from choosing, and thus be a choice. Kierkegaard teaches that either every man must present himself before God, or live mundanely in the pettiness of bourgeois society. The third truth that Kierkegaard expounds is that, "God has been merciful to us, demonstrating his grace to the point of being willing to involve himself with every person." What Kierkegaard is so passionate about is having a living, breathing, and personal relationship with God. ( urlLink Quoted from this )  Kierkegaard brought the "personal relationship with God" theology to a much higher and more personal (or existential) level. Kierkegaard never set out to prove the existence of God; in fact the thought the idea of proving God’s existence was foolish. It would be like a court of law trying to prove a criminal existed, instead of proving that the accused, who does exist, is a criminal. Why would you try to reason in conclusion to existence, instead of reasoning from existence to conclusion ( urlLink Quoted from this )? Kierkegaard’s entire philosophical project is to make faith difficult, like the faith demonstrated by Abraham’s sacrifice of Isaac. Kierkegaard called this the "Leap of Faith" and for him, faith is how we come to know things for certain.  Kierkegaard disliked "objective truth." He felt it was meaningless to existence, and would have no bearing on how people lived if it was known. He boldly proclaims the absolute truth of Christ and how little it mattered to the people standing right in front of him, Pilate asked, "What is truth?" And with such a question, it was crucified. Kierkegaard was more interested in what he calls "subjective truth." Now this is where it gets confusing. This sort of truth is characterized by how it relates to the absolute truth. The straight and narrow road is not a literal road, but how the journey is lived ( urlLink Quoted from this ). This is the most important kind of truth for Kierkegaard. The following quote sounds very postmodern, and is the most direct statement about what he means:   Truth is not a sum of statements, not a definition, not a system of concepts, but a life. Truth is not a property of thought that guarantees validity to thinking. No, truth in its most essential character is the reduplication of truth within yourself, within me, within him. Your life, my life, his life express the truth in the striving. Just as the truth was a life in Christ, so too, for us truth must be lived. ( urlLink Edifying Discourses )   Reduplication means to live out in life the challenges of what one thinks, to be what one says. Kierkegaard had a problem though. How could he to communicate this truth to people without it becoming marginalized by the chronocentric modern method of intellectual categorization? He desperately did not want to be another footnote of consciousness, for that’s what happened when people wrote books about truth. He felt that subjective truth was too deep and to insightful to be communicated directly. So he turned to what he calls "indirect communication." He wrote long-winded novels and discourses under pseudonyms (false names) to offer multiple perspectives filled with philosophical irony about the relation they all had to truth. This all seems nauseatingly complex, but a man who communicated his "subjective truth" very well, inspires Kierkegaard ( urlLink Palmer ).   Jesus never proved he was the Son of God to those who demanded proof. Jesus simply put forth his teachings, his character, his miracles, and implored his followers to have faith in him. Comically, when Jesus was asked about what the kingdom of God was like, he would say it was about, "a man who sowed good seed in his field," "a mustard seed", "like yeast that a woman took and mixed into a large amount of flour", "a treasure in a field," "a merchant looking for fine pearls," and "like the owner of a house." He rarely ever said what he meant, but by doing so, caused people to come out of the complacent lull they had drowsily fallen into by listening to the teachers of the law. Jesus caused the people to think and relate to the parables that he often gave without explanation.  Communication is the challenge of postmodern evangelism. It is all based on the method of language in which we present the truth. I remember my pastor sharing about his experiences of living and evangelizing in Boulder, Colorado. Armed with his Bible and the fire of Christ’s message burning in his heart, he boldly proclaimed the Gospel. However, he quickly found out that sharing the Four Spiritual Laws with people was ineffective in bringing people to Christ. He was not alone in his experience, and a new method had to be developed to communicate the time-old truths of the Gospel. Hanging out at the arcade playing pinball sharing with onlookers, he told of the awesome changes Christ made in his life. My pastor’s mantra "Experience God, not Religion" was born, and it is a concise synopsis of what Kierkegaard emphatically tried to say through his bizarre, cryptic style.   The church has had large fear of postmodernism, because it seems as though all truth must be discarded and everything must be approached nonrationally. Leonard Sweet in  urlLink Postmodern Pilgrims  teaches that Churches must become "E.P.I.C." (experimental, participating, image based, connected communities) in order to communicate the truths of Christ. This is a helpful acronym to keep in mind; however, in my view, this is a narrow treatment of postmodernism because postmodernism still includes rational approaches to knowing truth. Many postmodern evangelists think postmoderns have thrown the baby out with the bathwater. They have not. Rational approaches of knowledge are just another one of the perspectives used to find out if something is true. The best rational evangelistic tool that challenges informal pluralism is the teachings found in Josh McDowell’s  urlLink More Than a Carpenter . Either Jesus is the way, or he is not.   However, postmodern people do not want another argument proving Christianity. They would rather see a Christian living by what he says, rather than listening to what he says. A bold Christian life is no longer about standing up with a microphone blathering on about the virtues of purity, but actually living pure in the midst the peer pressure of immorality. Postmoderns would rather see a life changed and lived with conviction, than hear about why it is good to be changed. People want to experience God spiritually, not mentally. One of biggest movements that the church has ever witnessed is the wild fire spread of Pentecostalism. In the last 30 years no other movement has even come close to the record growth it has seen32. In the past, it was labeled "cultic" and "flaky" for its unorthodox practices, but many Christians, desiring to experience true spiritual power, have experimented with it. People, like my own parents and many Rockers, have moved on to a Pentecostal denomination in search of a more intimate spiritual experience.  Postmoderns want to be active in their beliefs. It is important for the Church to allow people to participate in ministry, leadership, theological dialogue, and even the messages, so their beliefs can be relevant to their lives. People want to be participants in the body of Christ, to have a role, and a purpose, instead of being a simple observer. All of this calls Christians to take their faith more seriously.   Postmoderns are moved by images as well as words. Movie clips illustrate feelings, and other nonrational concepts in ways never before imagined. The movie The Matrix inspired deep reflection on faith, reality, and religion. It gave a great working picture of the modern philosophy of Descartes, and the struggle between knowing what is real and what is not. Mark did a superb job using The Shawshank Redemption to illustrate hope. The pictures can say things that statistics never could, but that doesn’t mean that you replace black and white text for pictures, otherwise you run the risk of dumbing down everything you say. A popular conjunction of these two methods is in John Eldridge’s book Wild at Heart. He uses both pictures from movies and his own words to clearly communicate his ideas.  Postmoderns long to have community. It is ironic that in an intensely individualistic culture, where we all are trying to become ourselves, we long to be connected to each other. In a support letter I received from a campus missionary commenting on the variety of reality love shows (Joe Millionaire, the Bachelor), he wrote, "We just can’t seem to get enough love stories! It seems that our society is relationally deprived." If there is one thing that determines people’s acceptance or rejection of Christianity, it is by how they are received within the Christian community. Will they be welcomed and accepted, or ignored and snubbed?   As far as I am concerned, the Rock is doing an excellent job allowing its members to experience and participate in the authentic spiritual life communicated by its leaders. The use of stories, images, participation, and a sincere community has fostered the growth of hundreds of lives. Some things to grow in, however, would be a greater emphasis on worship and bible teaching. Remember, modern Christianity became superficial; postmoderns will not tolerate superficiality in any way. A perfect example of this genuine hunger was articulated by a small group leader’s comments at the last leaders meeting, "In this year of leading small group, I have never had to teach from the Word as much as I have this year.” People are hungry for truth the Bible teaches, but they aren’t sure how to understand it.  It has been a pleasure for me to write this. I could go on longer about what we can do to reach out to postmoderns, but that was not the focus of this essay. The purpose I had in writing this essay was to help people love God with all their mind, as well as our heart, soul, and strength. Also it must be said that postmodernism is in its infant stages and is always changing, and that is why philosophers are cautious to define it. Nevertheless, we have an enormous opportunity to relate with our culture, and I am excited to be a part of a movement dedicated to making Jesus Christ attractive to the outside world.

       Wineskin(s)  urlLink Darryl Dash  facilitates a collaborative blog called  urlLink Leading Dying Churches .  A fantastic group of thinkers(not unlike this group) contribute to meaningful and regular discussion there.  Today I ran into a  urlLink post  which I found to be particularly interesting.  The question posed here by Sandy is one that I hear frequently, and one that I believe may implicate some very drastic results for the church as a whole, depending on how we wrestle with it.  Here is is: Old wineskins A long time ago, I spoke on Jesus' image of putting new wine into old wineskins. My friend Sandy e-mailed this question:  "In response to your message, I'd like to ask a provocative question: Is it a waste of time to try to change an "old" church into a "new" church? Should new churches be started from scratch rather than trying to convert or adapt established churches? (Do you think that's stretching the "old wineskins" metaphor beyond Jesus' intentions?)"  What do you think?  My Response:  I think that this will become, if it hasn't already, one of the central questions of our progression as the church. I've got some thoughts that I'm sure coincide with Leighton on the issue, but an important contemplation may be--What if we are all the same wineskin, and not various independent ones? Then what? How would we adapt and provide for an atmosphere of tolerance and inspiration, for freedom and adaptation? How would we wrap our arms around the entire wineskin and carry it into the future?  Even in the ancient church time, the people of God had factions of belief. But it seems to me that one of two things will happen as shifts in culture increase the disparity in our factions. Either we will snap back together and embrace our diversity, allowing each his own place in creating our future, or our elasticity will be stretched to the point of rupture, and the split will create pain and cause the church to turn in the ugliness of humanity upon itself. I hope that is not necessary.  With that thought, how can we become a people that act as a catalyst for the former? How can we encourage and embrace our own diversity, making room for all to contribute in their own way, without allowing us to become divided because of our varying forms?  What do you think?  How can we/should we wrestle with our diversity while retaining the integrity of our singularity?

      "Since the revelation given in the Scriptures embraces a complete system of truth, every single department must sustain many obvious relations, logical and otherwise, to every other as the several parts of one whole. The imperfect development, and the defective or exaggerated conception of any one doctrine, must inevitably lead to confusion and error throughout the entire system."  urlLink A.A.

      Modern American Christianity is a diverse multiplex of trends. No longer do the labels “Catholic” or “Protestant” neatly categorize the trajectories of the post-Reformation era we live in. Protestantism is so hopelessly fragmented that entirely different words are needed to describe the variety of movements and trends within. Liberals take on a theology of social activism, while the Reformed hold tightly to the teachings of John Calvin and the Westminster Confession, Modern Evangelicals focus on the piety of conversion, and Pentecostals look to the “baptism of the Holy Spirit” for a true union with Christ. Needless to say there has been much more diversity than unity; however, there is no reason to despair. Brian Mclaren optimistically says that there is as a “new kind of Christian” emerging from the postmodern culture that seeks to be more than just a label. Ironically, this “new kind of Christian” has been labeled the so-called “emerging church,” which seeks to be a like-minded community with a solidarity that transcends the arbitrary pigeonholing of yesterday’s spiritually bankrupt Christianity. They claim that the Church has failed Christ’s followers, the world, and most importantly, God.   I have fervently sought to understand this movement because I am a part of it. I realize that no matter what direction I take in my theology I must engage postmodern culture, because I am of a postmodern generation. Of course I could always retreat into a comfortable Christian bubble that floats on the rubber raft of fundamentalism. However, that would only help me become a moralistic cynic of today’s pagan revelry; I think the Church has plenty of those to go around. However, that would only come at the expense of my conscience. Circling the wagons and isolating from the world is not an option. Yet at the same time I look at the version of Christianity that took to the streets and airwaves in the last 50 years, and I find myself categorically embarrassed. There are plenty of silly images that come to mind. Huge “mega churches” catering to “seekers,” arenas full of people weeping for healing, sweaty televangelists preaching with a big-ass leather bible in hand, and little tracts with 4 spiritual laws and a bridge on them are all characteristics of a Christianity that you and I hold in contempt. And let’s not forget the vulgar contributions of the Religious Right and Christian talk radio. Just about every piece of rhetoric that comes from them can only decry the evils of abortion, gays and lesbians, and “working women.” So, it is without question that 20 to 30 something Christians want to be known for something different; the question is what?  Younger Evangelicals are going through an identity crisis. We know pretty well what we don’t want to be, yet we have no idea what we want to be. A friend of mine pointed this out to me when he said he always chuckles at the slogans on Gen X church bulletins that say, “We are definitely not your parent’s church!”  We’ve made our claims on different styles of music, different ways of doing church, and we’ve even discarded the practice of systematic theology as an artifact of modernity. Unfortunately, we tend to castigate those who study it as “arrogant”, “pharisaical”, and “divisive.” And most tragically, we are painfully ignorant of our own Great Tradition of Church history. We are only becoming simply another movement within “Evangelicalism” stereotyped by coffee houses and acoustic guitars. Is this really the best we can do? Are we really going to be more than just a label? What does being a member of God’s Kingdom really mean?   After reflecting on these questions for some time, I have come to agree with the author of Ecclesiastes who wrote in Solomonic prose, “Nothing is new under the sun.” If our generation is to have any spiritual significance we must do what every generation who is of the community of God must do. We must listen. We must listen to what God has to tell us and we must listen to one another.   Modern Evangelicalism’s project was to establish Scripture as inspired by God, inerrant in word, and infallible in faith and practice. Because the increasing secular scrutiny and textual criticism of the Bible in the early 20th century became so fierce, scholars like Carl H. F. Henry wrote voluminous amounts of books and articles defending the authority and veracity of the Bible. This single foundation has been heavily defended for the last two hundred years so that theologians like Charles Hodge and B.B. Warfield could sift through the text and extract propositional truth in order to build a coherent doctrinal system. One might be able to scoff at the effort of a complete and final “system” of the Bible’s truth, but we must remember that this was (and still is) the way that Modern Evangelicals sought to listen to God. Whether or not this project succeeded or failed is irrelevant, but one thing it did prove is that Christians are, as Stanley J. Grenz would say, “a people of the book.” If we are to listen to God at all we must listen to the message of Scripture. It is as if we are like Charlton Heston of the NRA, raising a rifle above his head saying, “From my cold, dead hands!” So we are with the Bible.  My favorite books of the Bible are those of the Old Testament prophets. The most common command throughout their narratives is to “listen,” “hear,” and “give ear” to the spoken message of God. Sadly, most of the messages delivered through these men were not taken seriously because the people did not take God seriously. Those that did, tested their words, and sought after a greater knowledge and understanding of God and his revelation. Listening is the proper response to God rather than arbitrary mantras of meaningless praise (Luke 11:27-28). Those that listen to God want to “hear” Him so that they might obey Him. So much of the disgust our generation has with systematic theology is that it becomes mere knowledge that puffs up the ego. If we applied one tenth of all that we know about forgiveness, we would truly be a grateful people. Unfortunately, many believers fail to understand the gospel they profess and live in a perpetual state of guilt, bondage, and fear. It is as if they looked into a mirror and quickly forgot what they looked like when they turned away from it (James 1:22-25). It is no wonder that task of the prophet is so arduous! The message is not hard to understand, but seldom heard.   Today, listening has become an increasingly difficult task. If God is to use us at all in this transitional age we must learn how to tune out an obscene amount of “noise.” Our culture is constantly distracted by television, magazines, newspapers, billboards, books, CD players, radio stations, websites, emails, MP3’s, shopping malls, schools, our family, friends, acquaintances, co-workers, and even our own depraved minds! One has to ask how it is even possible to concentrate on something unseen! Even in our churches we get bogged down in the petty business of determining if our worship is “experiential,” if the bass was loud enough, if the latest greatest Christian band is actually Christian, if the book your reading is biblical, or if churches should or shouldn’t be “seeker-sensitive.” I sometimes wonder during these heated “worship wars” if the believers that are trying to be “sensitive” to “seekers” are even seeking God!    If our generation is going to have any spiritual significance we must listen to what God is saying to us. We must not become anti-historical reformists, always trying to be different, but learn to reflect on the Great Tradition of the church. As Thomas C. Oden has said, “Tradition enables reform.” Finally, we must try to understand what is really going on in the world around us so we can meet its needs. All of this demands an attention span. We must quiet our minds, and be still so that we may know who is God (Psalm 46:10). As Oden says, “The completeness and fullness of truth in the apostolic testimony always seeks to become freshly appropriated in new hearts, new cultures, and ever retranslated into new languages and symbol systems. For the Spirit is working throughout history in all times and places to bring the incarnate eternal Word into our hearts effectively.”  I remember sitting alongside the Mississippi River in St. Paul a couple of years ago as a broken man. I was so angry with God; I refused to speak to him. I just sat there, smoking my tobacco pipe, listening to the flowing water for hours at a time. The only distractions were the occasional barge that would chug by and the twig I would sometimes dig in the dirt with. It was in these quiet moments that I was able to hear God speak to me. I would open my Bible to Isaiah 46 and read about the heavy idols I was carrying and how God longed for me to turn from my own self-glorification. Sometimes during my daily twattle I look back fondly on that time in my life. It was a turning point—a point of change. It was a change that I could not have done without, and neither can we. We must listen, or we will be nothing new under the sun.

      hey john et al,  I've been absent from this blog for a long time.. but I'm hoping to stop by a bit more often. blessings to all in the new year!  Here's a provocative thought from Bonhoeffer..  "During these years the Church has fought for self-preservation as though it were an end in itself, and has thereby lost its chance to speak a word of reconciliation to humanity and to the world at large. So our traditional language must perforce become powerless and remain silent, and our Christianity will be confined to praying and doing right to our human brothers and sisters. Christian thinking, speaking and organizing must be reborn out of this praying and this action.. It will be a new language.. the language of a new righteousness and truth, which proclaims the peace of God with humankind and the advent of his kingdom.  Dietrich Bonhoeffer, "Letters and Papers from Prison"

      one day jesus took his disciples up the mountain and gathered them around him. as they gathered he looked at each and everyone of them with a smile on his face. he then turned to them and started to teach them by saying:   "blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. blessed are the meek. blessed are those who mourn. blessed are the merciful. blessed are those who thirst for justice. blessed are you when you are persecuted. blessed are you when you suffer. be glad and rejoice for your reward is great in heaven."   as jesus was speaking the disciples started to talk among themselves;  peter looked around and asked, "are we supposed to know this?"  andrew, looking puzzled, said, "do we have to write this down?"  james, franticly looking for something to write with whined, "will we have this on a test?"  philip, pushing james aside said, "i have no paper."  bartholomew, with a tear in his eye said, "do we have to turn this in?"  while john complained, "the other disciples didn't have to learn this."  matthew, looking up at jesus said, "could you go over this again?  judas, shaking his head said, "what does this have to do with real life?"   just then one of the local pharisees asked to see jesus' lesson plan. he wanted to know the scripture used, and quoted and he also desired to know the hermeneutics used to structure the lesson. he inquired of Jesus, "where is your anticipatory set and your objectives in the cognitive domain?"   Then, Jesus wept.

      [ i originally wrote this for  urlLink my blog , thought it might be of interest to readers here as well.  it provides a framework for talking about how it is possible for two differing views of the world to be true at the same time, even if they disagree on some things  ]  here's a quotation from the book  urlLink Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance , (also available to read on-line  urlLink here ), referring to the discovery by Lobachevski and Bolyai that non-euclidian geometries existed and were just as logical and mathematically valid.    It wasn't that the proof was alarming.  It was its rational byproduct that soon overshadowed it and almost everything else in the field of mathematics.  Mathematics, the cornerstone of certainty, was suddenly uncertain.  We now had  two  contradictory visions of unshakeable scientific truth. true for all men of all ages, regardless of their individual preferences.  This was the basis of the profound crisis that shattered the scientific complacency of the Gilded Age.   How do we know which one of these geometries is right?   ...  And of course, once that door was opened one could hardly expect the number of contradictory systems of unshakeable scientific truth to be limited to two.  A German named Riemann appeared with another unshakeable system of geometry which throws overboard not only Euclid's postulate [ that through a point, there is is only one line parallel to a given line ], but also the first axiom, which states that only one straight line can pass through two points.  Again there is no internal contradiction, only an inconsistency with both Lobachevskian and Euclidian deometries.  According to the Theory of Relativity, Riemann geometry best describes the world we live in.  -- excerpt from urlLink  Chapter 22       i think we are in a period where theology is going through a similar shift.  alternative theologies are being explored which are based on different assumptions than classical theology, that possibly explain our complex world better.   as tempting as it is to hold on to a conceptually simpler "Euclidian" theology, maybe we need to be brave enough to have a theology in which space is curved and parallel lines, somwhere in the heavens, do finally meet.

      Ever visit a “postmodern/emerging” community of faith and the experience was anything but postmodern?   If anything, one could call it a “hyper-evangelical experience” – you know, a standard “saddlecreek” church with louder music and cool haircuts.  I have been there, done that and even have the t-shirts.  Over time I have received many emails from people who have asked me what I think a “postmodern/emerging” community of faith would look like?  To be honest, I am not sure – that would totally depend on the community, the people, the vision, the heart, the art, the joy and the grace of the people connected to the community – but i think there are certain “cores” that a postmodern/emerging community of faith has that are important (in my opinion) to the nature of the community.  When I share them (those that I see as “core”), some get very defensive in replies.  It seems that they saw their community of faith as “postmodern/emerging” but they did not see any of the cores in their communities.   Still, many seemed to want to know what I thought the “form” of a postmodern/emerging community of faith would be.  It seems that they needed answers – but I like it better when things are designed for people to develop questions, not for me to give my answers.  My understanding of a “postmodern/emerging” community of faith is, as all things, based on two very important ideas “form and function.”    The Assumptions of Form:  Form is the visible, the seen structure and the tangible.  It is what we can touch, and touch can be defined as something felt and seen.  Its texture can be described and its “feel” can be expressed.  If your form is identical to the general form of all others you are saying you are no different, or at least show no creativity, from any other.  When the church made the move from the traditional to the contemporary, form was changed.  Creativity took hold and a new texture was designed to meet the changing tastes of the people.  So, it goes, a move from the contemporary to the postmodern/emerging demands a form change, a new texture based on new views, patterns and structure.     In the postmodern/emerging community of faith I believe form takes on two different, and very important, “forms.”  The first of these forms is general structure and the second is governance.  Let me start with the idea of general structure.   I see general structure of a community of faith falling at two ends of a spectrum.  On one end the “stand-alone” and on the other end, what I call, the “corded.”      The form of structure   The stand-alone, is a community of faith that may, or may, not be connected to a denomination; they may, or may, not be receiving funds from other church.  For all intents and purposes they are on their own.  Their staffs are not being paid by another church, nor are they part of another churches staff, and they are not under the control of another ministry.  The key to a stand-alone is that it can express the theology it finds central to scripture and the way they see the scripture in the life of the people they desire to minister too.   On the other end of the spectrum is the corded community of faith.  These communities of faith are ones that are directly tied to a “mother church.”  The pastor is one of the pastors of the larger church and is usually under the direct control of the senior pastor, and the board of the “mother church.”  They count on the mother church for money, man power, meeting place and equipment – they are connected via an “umbilical-cord” to the mother church – hence the idea that they are a “corded” church.  Now, on the surface, there is nothing wrong with this structure, to truly be birthed a process of maturation needs to take place where the mother feeds the child for a period of time – but then a birth needs to take place, for it to truly be able to express itself as a postmodern/emerging community of faith     While these may be the two extremes of a spectrum I do recognize that many churches fall somewhere between the two ends.  Generally speaking, corded communities of faith (corded at any level) can never be “fully postmodern/emerging” because of their relationship with, and to, the modern mother church.  Over the past few years I have spoken with many “associate pastors” who serve in a hyper-modern corded communities of faith and they have expressed their concern about not being able to fully express what they believe needs to be expressed.  With few exceptions, these corded communities of faith seem to be designed to keep the “college age” members of the church happy and to let their parents think they are doing something cool for their kids.  In short, the modern mother church sees a “postmodern/emerging outreach” as simply another program.     Another aspect of the “structure” form of a postmodern/emerging community of faith is that it tends to be far less program driven and more people driven.  While project, short-term ideas abound, “major programs” are not embedded in the postmodern/emerging community of faith.  Postmodern/emerging communities of faith are not program driven.  In fact, they are not programming anything.  Programs are a modern design and work well with modern people, but no so with a postmodern community of faith.  If a group of people gathers for “home churches” and they have children and youth – a youth group is naturally formed.  If, a youth gathering is needed for the larger community of faith it can grow out of that gathering, it is naturally organic and develops from the heart of God’s call.     On a personal level, I tend to the stand-alone community of faith; because a true postmodern/emerging structure needs to be creative and less central then in modern church.  Postmodern/emerging structure allows for people to get involved and not sit on the sidelines.  If the structure is not designed to allow for creative expressions, then a postmodern/emerging structure is not in place.  Which brings me to the second point of form, governance.      The form of governance   Governance, in general terms, is control.  In a modern church this control is rigid, central, authoritative, business minded, controlling and very unidirectional.  While this structure may vary in its intensity all these parts are present in a modern community of faith.  For example, some modern churches may be less rigid, but that does not change the fact that they are a modern church.  While governance in a postmodern/emerging community of faith is divested, empowering, encouraging and interactive.     Governance of many churches in USAmerica is not based on scripture – sorry, but that is just fact.  I know, as you are reading this you are saying, “not my church.”  But it’s true.  All churches in USAmerica have governance based in either state laws or IRS code; all churches – plan simple fact.  Generally speaking, this is not “wrong” its just fact. Look around; every modern church that claims to have a “biblical model of leadership” is actually governed based on the cultural laws of the individual state they are in.  In fact, most modern churches I know of have simply taken the “constitution” (which is not a biblical concept) of other “larger, successful” churches and changed the name to fit its needs.  What I find interesting is the fact that while state law tells you want you need in the way of “corporate offices” most do not define the way those offices are defined in a church.  The modern church has taken the historical corporate and military view of leadership and defined the roles of leaders in the modern church on those models.     In a postmodern/emerging community of faith “leadership” is truly discipleship, a teaching relationship between people where Christ is the center.  People in a postmodern/emerging community of faith that govern are seen in terms of a mentor, one who helps people along a path.  A postmodern “leader” is less leader and more artist, less CEO and more friend – this idea of a system that is freeing and trusting is hard for a controlling modern mind to grasp.  They, modern Christians, believe for a true church to form, someone must be in control – and a postmodern/emerging Christian sees God as in control and trusts that the person is following God’s call on their lives.  Trust is an essential part of a postmodern/emerging structure of governance.  True postmodern/emerging “leadership” is seen as a team, where the roles interact and change as needed; again, trust is central to a postmodern structure.  Trust is an “unseen” quality – if you trust me, I will know even though I cannot touch it, and that leads us to the second part of this article “function.”      The Assumptions of Function:   Function is the unseen, the unspoken, that which is felt and not physically touched.  While form may show a certain quality, function can be seen as an expression of that quality.  So, the question begs to be asked – what is a “postmodern/emerging community of faith function?”  What are the “unseen” qualities of a postmodern/emerging community of faith?     I find that function falls into two qualities, theology and attitude.  Let me start by saying that I do not believe a postmodern/emerging community of faith is defined by music or age.  While these may be part of a postmodern/emerging community of faith, they do not define the community.     While it may seem silly to say that a postmodern/emerging community of faith needs to have a postmodern theology function, I am surprised how many just don’t.  Rewrapped evangelism, or fundamentalism, will not work.  Before I go further I need to explain that there is a difference between a postmodern theology and a modern theology.  But “liberal” is not necessarily a postmodern theology.  Postmodern theology is not conservative nor is it liberal.  Both those concepts are modern and linear and make one select “a side.”  Modern theology is centered on evangelistic systematic theology, and in the great formation of the cosmos a postmodern theology can never be systemized – there can be no such nothing as a “postmodern systematic theology” (even though some have tried, and are still trying).  While a debate can be made for what is and what is not part of a postmodern theology, and we debate that regularly on the egroup “postmodern theology,” I think certain parts of a postmodern theology are, a willingness to be open and allow for an honest exchange of ideas, a willingness to examine all aspects of theology and see what has a direct tie to scripture, a desire to not be “hard lined” in a particular theological tradition, a desire not to be tied to tradition at all, a knowledge that skeptics are welcomed and healthy and a desires to go beyond what others say we must.  If all that is happening in a church is a rewrapping of evangelical theology, then no matter the form the function defines it as a contemporary modern church.     The next function is that of attitude or “environment.”  This is the ultimate of the unseen, yet it is so very important.  When I walk into a modern contemporary church I “just know” because of the way I am treated.  Usually, the only people to even acknowledge I am alive are those handing out bulletins.  People walk by without even the simplest of exchanges, and if I make the first move I am ignored.  Yet, when I enter a postmodern/emerging community of faith I am made to feel welcomed, because people want to know me – they want to make a new friend and experience a new way of seeing things.  Last year (before i went into hiding – but I am out now) I had the opportunity to speak at the Upstairs Leadership Conference in Phoenix Arizona.  While I was there I was invited to attend The Bridge, a postmodern/emerging community of faith.  When I walked in, I knew it – it was not the music (though that was great) but it was the people, people came to me and talked with me (and they had no idea who I was).  People actually sat by me and opened conversation with me – something that would never happen in a modern contemporary church.   I knew that I was in a place where people wanted to know me, and no for any other reason but for myself.     This is very important to a postmodern/emerging community of faith’s function – why do you want to know the people who attend the community of faith?  Is it to share Christ?  Is it to make sure I return?  What is the reason?  If you want to know me because you want me to join your church, then you want to know me for false reasons – and not for me.  Your motives are not pure.  If the reason you want to know me is because you want to share with me Jesus Christ, then you do not want to get to know me – you have an altered-motive, no matter how altruistic that move is, it is not because you want to know me.      Closing   I usually try to end what i am writing by trying to tie all together, but not today.  What I desire to do is close with a question; one that I believe is very important and needs to have an honest answer.  If the form and function of a community of faith shows no real difference from a modern contemporary church how can that community of faith claim to be postmodern/emerging?

       I'm excited about connecting with people doing similar things on the internet. It's happened already quite a few times. I look forward to more connection and mutual encouragement, prerhaps through this blog. We met the folks at Vineyard Central like that. I've met people in California doing something like we are who pray for us regularly. They are the church at  urlLink Matthew's House .   I'm also looking forward to meeting some of these people face to face at  urlLink Search Party  in St. Louis. This is going to be a very cool event. I'll post more about it after I get back.

       I just want to post something else because I can! I've invited the other two members of our community who presently have web access to join in - we await your arrival! I also want to say that I know Kevin Rains will be extremely jealous to see that I already have this thing up and running. I love Kevin and all the wonderful people at  urlLink Vineyard Central  in Cincinnati. They are our good friends - Tracy (aka: Stacey, Lucy, Darcy, or Dorcas), Dave and Jody, Tawd, Angie, Owen, aaand the rest, there on Viiiineyard Isle. OK, too silly.    Seriously, though, we're learning from these guys - they're a bit farther along in this thing than we are. God connected us with them last year - almost a year ago now - and we have been building a great relationship ever since. They're even going to come down and do a retreat for us soon. Good things are on the horizon.

       We are a small house-based community (not house "bound" but we meet in a home) and as I've mentioned before here, a part of our holisitc vision for building this thing is the inclusion of children. They have been pushed aside by the church for far too long and it's time to break down those walls no matter how uncomfortable it is for us "grown ups." Apparently, and not surprisingly, we're not the only ones with this concern. Just yesterday, a new blog was created as a public discussion of this matter. It's called  urlLink What Do We Do With The Kids!? . Please check it out. right now in participation on the new blog are people who are doing church in a new way from California, Kentucky, Florida, Missouri, and New Zealand - more to be added soon. This is a very important part of this revolution we're all going through and worth spending some time on.

       Yeeeaaaahhh Molly!!! You went and done it! Cool! I think you are right in your thinking about "doing what we can do now." I think we focus far too much on some "great" thing we think God wants to do through us. He is constantly doing one huge great thing through all of us and what we mostly need to be doing is just participating in that. As members of His Kingdom, everything we do communicates that to people - bad or good. Anyway, there's a balance of simply "being" and being intentional about expanding the Kingdom.

       Wha'd I tell ya?  Yes, I figured out the trick.  I was missing one step.  Anyway, I will try to recreate what I did yesterday.  Let me see if I can do a paragraph or if that is pushing my luck.  This is suppose to be a new paragraph.  Right on to what Alan was saying about not just "being".  Robert and I were talking about something similar about a week ago, how strange.  We were asking ourselves what we were "doing" for God, other than preparing ourselves acedemically for the future as God has called us to do and "hanging out".  I think we (Robert and I) spend way too much time thinking of what grand ordeal God wants us to do instead of spending that time doing little things that make a big difference.  Something as simple as taking our adorable little dog to a children's hospital or a nursing home and visiting with people, God's children, our brothers and sisters in Christ.  What would that take?  Maybe two phone calls and an hour or two of time?  Nothing compared to the joy that would come from it, not only for the visitees (is that a word?) but also for Robert and me (and our dog!).  I have found that when you do something for the glory of God, no matter how reluctant you are, you are always blessed by it in some unexpected way.  Not that anyone doesn't want to do these things but, you know, there is always something else that needs to be done.  Somthing that has already waited a week or two and could wait another day, like organizing my closet or wiping out my cupboards.  No, I don't do these things, they are just examples!  Anyway, my point is that we can do little things all the time instead of waiting for a big sign from God to carry out some huge plan.  Not that the big things aren't good but I think that God wants us to do what we can "right now" as well.  Many of us are doing small things daily that we may be unaware of, smiling every morning at my neighbor watering her flowers as I go out the door to work, letting the person with two items in his hand in front of me and my cart of gorceries in the checkout line at the grocery store, these may seem meaningless, but people do notice and are touched by these small acts.  We can almost always be doing more though.  The small daily acts are just a start to other acts of kindness.  I think that Robert and I should set a goal of how often we are going to do something (like take our dog to visit) on top of the daily acts that come almost naturally.   Well, there it is.  Hopefully it was not a waste of your time to read.  Later.

       Hi, I am trying for the third time to post a blog.  I am feeling very incompetent.  Of course, this will end up being the one to post because it sounds ridiculous.

       I've been thinking lately about our mission. What is it? Are we here to just be here and hang out with each other or are we supposed to be doing something else? Well, I think we're supposed to be doing something. Jesus did something. The apostles did something. People aren't called to start communities of faith or "churches" simply to "be there." I don't think they are anyway. What is Christianity about? OK, sort of a long answer... here's part of it - maybe the core: it's about God loving the people that He created, seeing that they had become something far from His original intention (which is not good, not healthy, harmful, etc.), and His doing what it took to bring us back to where we are supposed to be - that we, through what Jesus did, can be fully transformed into the kind of people God created us to be. That's basically what it's about.   Now, does God want that for some people and not for others? Big theological question. What do you think would make sense of a loving God? ... Yip, I thought so - that's what I think too - of course not! He wants us all to be what we're supposed to be. So, here's where the earlier question comes in. "What is our mission as a community?" I think, simply, it is this: to continually be and do what belongs to being a part of that transformational process - of being recreated in the image of God - AND to "invite" other people to walk this same journey of transformation with us.   Being and inviting others to be as well. Inviting more by example, by living naturally our transformed lives around others, by loving as God loves, and yes, by talking about this new life that we have. I hope someone who is not a "Christian" sees this. I hope you get in touch and tell me why you have read this and what you think about it (positive or negative). That's it for now.

       Last night's gathering was a good thing. Meaghan (she's an 11 year old member of our community - who happens to be my daughter) was our facilitator. She came up with the discussion and lead us through the questions. We had a great discussion time. I think we learned some helpful things about ourselves. I told you she wanted to do this - and she did. I look forward to telling more children of the kingdom exploits from vbcc.   Robert graduates from Seminary on Sunday! Woo hoo! Congratulations Robert. Congratulations to his wife Molly too here out in the open, for graduating with her Masters from UK (that's not England, it's the University of Kentucky) in Social Work. We're so glad they are a part of our community and do not look forward to their leaving.

       We're doing a blog lesson after our community meeting tonight. If you want to make a new paragraph, you must actually use html tags to tell it where that is supposed to happen. Like this...   This is the new paragraph. OK, now if you want to put a link in the middle  - you'd do this - go look at  urlLink this cool site  I found today.

       Hi, everybody!  It's been forever, it seems, since I've made any contributions in here, but I've had some ESO problems with my computer (ESO=Equipment Superior to Operator).  I see now why Robert called it Netscrape--I thought that was just a typo.  But now I'm on Explorer, and that should be much better.  Large print for us mature types, too!   I tried the other night to share some insights that I had gotten while reviewing some teachings I did @ VBCC, but.....(refer to above).  So, I'll try again.  It may not be as good as the first time around, but we'll see.   I was going through my notes on a teaching I did about a month ago called "Worship Heals".  I actually got a lot out of it, through the insights of the others participating in the discussion.  Robert had made a comment that really stuck in my brain, which I'll share with you.  We were talking about 1 Samuel 16:23, where David plays his harp to calm down Saul when the evil spirit came upon him, and the relationship between that verse and the part musical worship plays in the Christian's life, when Robert made the comment that Saul was like an immature Christian, who uses worship music as a sort of crutch, being either unable or unwilling to spend the time to commune with God on his own to upkeep his relationship with God.  He relies more on the worship leader or team to get him "into the throne room".  David, however, is like a more mature Christian, who spends lots of time alone with God, producing his own "worshp experience".  This goes beyond whether a person is mucisally talented or not; it's an attitude thing.  David took responisibility for his relationship with God and initiated contact, whereas Saul rode on the coattails of others.  Anyway, I don't think Robert actually verbalized all that, but that's what God ministered to me through what he said.  Good stuff, I think!   I have a prayer request for anyone out there reading this who believes that God is our healer, etc.  I just found out that an uncle of mine has cancer and has been hiding it from the rest of the family for about 6 months.  Please pray for him, his kids, his siblings; for healing, for comfort, for understanding, for faith (I'm not sure how dedicated a Christian he and his family are).  I'll keep you all updated as I get more info and I know we'll be hearing good things soon!  I've been praying a long time for salvations to come to that branch of the tree, as well, so the harvest is ripe!

       Back home from Search Party - glad to be back. It was a great time but I always miss my family when I'm gone somewhere like that. Looking forward to this week in our meeting time. My daughter Meaghan will be facilitating the meeting this Wednesday. She has it figured out what she wants us to talk about and everything - cool! That's all for now I guess.

       Here I am again. Another full day at Search Party - Len Sweet, Andrew Jones, wTodd Hunter, Doug Paggit, more good music and conversations. I'll try to boil it down a little - Len Sweet and Andrew Jones started off with a discussion on glolocalization - things getting smaller because of the internet - talked about what "the church" is, etc. Here are some of the thoughts that I jotted down as I was listening:    If we are going to redefine what we call "church" then we need to redefine how we talk about church. So, in the accurate definition of church, is it still not a good thing? It seems to me, in this accurate view, that WE are the church - that we who are "in Him" are that new entity. And this, to me, is where I see that that term "the kingdom" and that term "the church" become synonomous. If we are "alive in the kingdom" then we are a "part of the church" and so in order to enter the life of God's kingdom, one must enter the church, and as we simply are the church where we are, we infect the cultures in which we live with the living kingdom of God."    There was a panel on "e-tools" - using the internet as the church. Interesting. Can we have "church" on the internet, in chat rooms, message boards, and on blogs? Good question. Can there be any real community built in these ways or is it merely a way to hide from real community? I think we put too much weight on "the internet" or "the tv" or some other thing. These things are not the problem. They just are what they are. The problems are in us. If we are trying to hide then that is our problem anywhere and it needs to be transformed out of us. blahhhhhh....   Todd Hunter on creating missional communities instead of "churches" that people "join." Good stuff. Rethinking what it means to be a pastor - back to ancient model of spiritual director - helping people toward transformation. He also encouraged us to not quench the work of the Holy Spirit. Yes, there are excesses and stupid things but we cannot live and do effectively in the kingdom what we need to do without Him. Here's the quote"  You cannot do what you need to do while being suspicious of the Holy Spirit. Don't use the excesses of others as an excuse.    Doug Paggit's workshop on new ways to view leadership in the church was great. 6 metaphors on leadership: shepherd, military, chaplain, coach, ceo, entertainer. The new way: organic gardener - gooood stuuuff! This gardener thinks about all the things that naturally produces a good garden. They facilitate what causes good growth in the garden - soil, weather, time of year, what to pull out and what to add (natural). It's a balance between "letting" and intentionality. Very encouraging - very God I think.   Now we're here about to go to bed. It ends tomorrow - there is a party in a park with several things going on. Then we go home on Sunday. That's all for tonight.

       One mo time. I'm very tired so I probably won't write much. Today was a pretty good day. Chuck Smith Jr., Todd Hunter, Roundtable discussions, workshops, more very cool music from this group Madison Green - good stuff. I'm bringing a CD home - agressive acoustic afro celtic - sharp. Also was in a workshop with and met Andrew Jones today - that was pretty cool. We had e-mailed and blogged back and forth but only "met" today. More talk on this "apprenticeship to Jesus" kind of being a Chrisitan - seems to be the underlying theology going on. It's good but I still (and I mentioned this today) want to bring the mystical union thing back into the equation. I think we don't want to lose that - that, to me, is what it is. All flows from that - and yes, it's about full and holistic transformation of the person.   After the thing closed down a good bunch of us went out for a "beer night out." Yes, that's right folks - mature Christian leaders out drinking beer - wow - is that really still an issue? Let's get past that please. Had a good time of connection with Jason Evans of Matthew's House in San Diego. We had a good talk. I'm glad we met like this. Mark, Aaron, Sef and I ate lunch with Andrew Careaga - that was a good time. He's doing some workshop tomorrow on something - good guy. More tomorrow perhaps - night night for now.

       OK, I'm here in St. Louis. We've been here all day. The conference started at 7pm tonight. We got there a little late without having a chance to eat before so we were all starving. We walked into a high liturgical mass type setting - celebrants wearing robes, incense, candles, eucharist. It was pretty good. I little weird. I had the distinct vibe that this was the liturgy of the host church (united church of Christ) "trying to play Catholic" - just saying that's how I felt. Anyway, it was OK. Brian McLaren spoke on changing how we view what a Christian is - we should, he says, rather become apprentices of Jesus - be on a journey - learn how by following the example of the Master. I think this is fine - IF we dont' loose the real notion (reality) of mystical union - of inner oneness with God by the Holy Spirit. I think we can't follow crap if we don't have that connection first. I won't get into all that right now, but I may later.   Met a couple of people face to face that I have known via e-mail - Karen Ward quickly, and Jason Evens from California.  That was cool. We went out to eat at Applebees and are now back in our room. Thank God for a laptop and internet connection. I'm going to join my comrades in the hot tub now and talk a little treason - have a good night.

       I'm going to  urlLink Search Party  tomorrow for 4 days of hanging out with a bunch of people who are trying to figure out how to do something similar to what we're doing here. Speakers, roundtable conversations, workshops, worship, serious networking with all kinds of cool people - and a big ole beer party - Guinness - good for your health!   I've already e-met a bunch of people who will be there and will have the opportunity to actually hang with them face to face. I'm exicited about it. Driving there with two guys from here (one actually from Seatle and one from Lex - new friend Ashley McGlone who is also in the process of starting something radical in this town). My comrades at Vine & Branches will be meeting without me tomorrw night - praying for me. Maybe I'll get to post some comments about the conference while I'm there! If can get online somewhere I will.

       Alright, so now I'm bloggin'.  This will make attempt #2, because NetScrape ate my last blog.  Anyway, I suppose I should say something about something, or "weigh in on some important social issues" as the media hype on the logon screen says.  Tonight, ladies and gentlemen, I want to talk about fly fishing.  That's right, I said fly fishing.     The general consensus among southern fishermen--the best and most knowledgeable of the entire breed of fishermen in general--is that fly fishing is for yankees and people who don't have lakes in their state and are having to be happy with second best.  There have even been numerous speculations among the great southern largemouth fishermen about the relative flexibility of the fly fisherman's wrist, which seems (to me) like something that would help them perform superior casting maneuvers.  For some reason, this aforementioned superior wrist-agility seems to have been a humorous thing to regular fishermen.  It even seems, I recall, to have been perceived as something derogatory, although I don't know why such a thing should be considered a shortcoming, especially provided that it would help perform fancy casting operations.   Anyway, it seems that perhaps, for once, the southern largemouth fishermen's wisdom may be mistaken.  Yes, occasionally the planets align, water spins down the drain backwards, and the regular non-fly fisherman of the south makes a blunder.  Alan has opened my eyes.  Now I see that fly fishing is a serious sport, requiring hours of preparation, a rather large monetary investment, an impressive amount of equipment, and a graduate degree in entymology (provided one wants to tie realistic flies).  Alan's wrist, oddly, doesn't seem abnormally limber, and he's from Kentucky so he's only a "borderline" yankee.   Now you tell me: what red-blooded American male wouldn't want to spend all his free cash on mountains of equipment, learn a skill that will absorb hours of time over the years, and have a perfect excuse to stand in the woods and drink beer?  Pretty much every worthwhile hobby available to the American male, of which I am aware, requires those elements: 1. Shiny Equipment, 2. Absorb Time, 3. Stand in Woods, 4. Drink Beer.  The more equipment it takes, the better.   Nobody will ever sell me on golf.  Golf looks like it would be less fun than pulling out my bridgework by hand and then chewing tacks.  It also looks about as interesting as... well, about as interesting as any game involving somebody wearing mismatched clothing and a beanie bludgeoning some tiny little ball around on the lawn until he finally coaxes the stupid thing into a tiny hole at the base of a plastic flag.  The scary thing is that this is supposedly the game of choice among America's financial bigshots and the intelligensia.  That fact alone tells me that America is in trouble.   When quizzed, golfers tell me they persist in playing their game of choice because it relaxes their mind.  That's all very well, but I can relax my mind by smacking myself on the head with a mallot until I black out.  What this game needs is some excitement.  Lets play it in teams and only use one ball.  We'll call it Rugby Golf.  Now there's a game!  Try to get the little ball into the hole on your side of the fairway while the other team tries to block.  Everything's fair, so you get to high-stick and run around.  It'd be great, and it would be more entertaining on TV.  Watching Chi-Chi Rodriguez beat the ever-living crap out of Tyger Woods with a five iron while Jack Nicholas sinks a birdie on a par five just before catching a putter in the mouth and losing his dentures would be better than watching that hushed, docile little crowd huddled together timidly behind that little rope while some senior citizen calmly taps in a ball any day.   In any case, fly fishing sounds pretty cool.  It's gotta be way better than golf no matter what.     End of Blog

       Hey, everybody!!  I tried this last night and couldn't remember how to get my entry posted, so I lost it.  I see my error now, so let's try it again. I was surfing the net last night (also a new thang for me), and came across a very encouraging site for IFES Ireland, or the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students--Ireland, to go the long way 'round.  It apparently is an organization of students ministering to other students in Ireland, which is way cool.  I, of course, had to e-mail them and tell them how cool they were, and that I'd be praying for them.  I have an idea that God is going to use the Internet to help me get over there and get my vision (OK, God's vision for me) up and running.  It's all so exciting!  I have the that feeling that there's something way cooler than I ever imagined just around the corner, but also that feeling that I have no idea what in the world it is.  For a control freak like myself, that's a very scary feeling, but also surprisingly exhilarating.  Pray for me that I recognize the way cool thing when I see it, and that I don't, "Run away!", like ol' Sir Robin of Holy Grail fame.

       We've been doing this lately - we rotate monthly who in our community facilitates the meetings we have. For a long time as the pastor, I was doing them all - doing way too much, even in this small simple setting. It got to me and I started realizing it was making me not want to do this and it was doing the others no good to not be "trained" by doing. So, we now rotate. It's been a very good experience and I think we are already richer because of it.    Now, in relation to that, yesterday, after I picked her up from the horse barn from her lesson, my daughter Meaghan (11) asked me for the second time, "Daddy, when do I get to do church?" I mean, she was serious, and we talked about it, and she had real ideas about what to talk about and what to sing, etc. I said, yes she could facilitate the meeting. We'll do that soon. Later that night, some of us were talking about the vbcc website - we have people profiles of all of us (or so I thought) - and she asked if I told about her on the site - "I'm a part of the church too you know" she said. Wow! I've been talking a better show than I've been living on this "include the children" business. This week I will be putting photos and bios on the "who" page of our site for all of the children - they are a part of the church too you know!

       Yeeeee Haaaaaw! Debi is among us! Well, she was among us already in the physical world but cyberly speaking (new term?) it's cool that one more community member is able to post to this thing and put out there who we are. We are branches connected to the Vine - one more branch now on "the vine."    As a "church" we consider ourselves an extended "family." And like any family, we have conflict from time to time - i.e., we get on each other's flippin' nerves. That doesn't feel good, but it's normal and we are committed to dealing with it - with one another - and working through it. We open up about vulnerable things and try to keep the air clear. Some of that "air clearing" went on last night, and although it wan't the most comfortable thing, it was a very good thing. I think the Holy Spirit really "inhabits" times when we open ourselves and just lay it out there. God help us to keep being that way! We are one as a body of believers, and God is working in and through all of us toward the transformation of everyone in the community. We can't hide from this process. If we do, we won't get very far down the path.

       Hey, everybody!!!  As Alan said, I'm connected to "the net" now, so I must, I must, I must POST!!!  Just got home from VBCC--a great time as usual.  I say that in faith this time...I left early to go hang out with some neat people from Bulgaria who live here in KY now (for 6 months so far).  I work with one of them and am really having fun getting to know them better.  As anyone who knows me for more than say, five minutes or so can tell you, I love anything that smacks of the "global community" (heavy on community); anything of the outside world at large.  It's just so cool to me that a "country girl" who grew up in central and eastern KY gets to end up knowing people from several different continents!  I haven't read all of the postings so far (sorry, Alan), so I don't know how much Alan has told you all about all of us.  My dream is to travel to Ireland, live there, and work at art, music, and young people (hopefully combining the three).  I get frustrated sometimes, thinking I'm spinning my wheels here in Lexington and not doing much about getting over there, but I have to trust God and know that He knows what He's doing, and that He's working on the vision, both for VBCC and for my personal dream.  I'll get there in His time. OK, it's late and I don't want to write the whole book in one sitting, so I'll sign off for now.

       Plans are coming together for the booster shot retreat - that's what I'm calling it. Our good friends and siblings from Vineyard Central are coming down to do a retreat for us at the end of this month. I think that's when it will happen. I think this will be a very good thing - a spiritual booster shot - encouragement - confirmation - wisdom. Our whole community (all 6 of us) and 8 of those guys will be together for the better part of 2 days. Eating, worship, prayer, talking, ministry, more food, more of the rest. I'll write about it when it happens.

       OK - it's official now - I can tell. Dave Nixon, abbot of Community House in Cincinnati - Vineyard Central founding pastor, poet, marathon runner, amateur chef, etc. - has agreed to serve on our advisory council. I respect him highly and am greatful that he has agreed to be a part of what we're doing - of what I'm doing - in this way. I look forward to crying and whining to Father Dave on a regular basis - hopefully not too much. Thanks Dave!    Had a good Greenhouse meeting today. We talked a good deal about hospitality - how our culture is not built on this principle and in fact helps us not be that way. We have to, as ambassadors of the King, go counter in this - to open our homes, open our lives to people. I'm challenged to do this more than I do - to make time to be hospitable.

       I've aked my friend Kevin Rains and one other (whom I will say later when and if he accepts) to serve on the vbcc advisory council (board). He has graciously agreed. I'm very glad of that. I think he will be a great addition to that group to whom I make myself accountable in this church plant. Thanks Kevin! Thanks too, to the guys who have been serving in that role for the past two years - thanks for your prayer and advice and support.  I feel like this is the cusp of a "next step" for us as a community. I'm not totally sure what's in the next step. I think I sense some of it, but God knows and the Holy Spirit will lead us there if we open ourselves to be lead. I do - I open myself as the leader of this bunch - lead us Holy Spirit, into Your will for us.

       We had a great meeting tonight. It is Brian's turn to facilitate for the month of May - good job tonight. We talked about having trouble in life - that it WILL happen, and that we can have hope through it because HE has overcome the world. We talked about the responses and choices we make in the midst of trouble or trial. It was a good talk - many life experiences shared - very practical. We also had fun. Molly's family was in and her mother and brother and nephew came - good to have them. I think they had a good time - probably a different experience for them, meeting in a house, but they seemed to have had a good experience.  I go to the  urlLink Greenhouse  gathering on Saturday. Brian may go with me. It will be good for more of us to be there. It's a good thing to be connected with this network of planters.

       I have to tell you God is glorious.  I especially think that when I see how beautiful nature is. Some times I just take God and Him being in my life for granted.  I don't think to think about it.  Maybe doing this will help me to focus more on Him.  I had entered some thoughts in my own blog and I was thinking how I didn't mention God much or even at all and I was kind of feeling guilty.  So I figured that I would at  least try to be more concious of that.  Have I totally confused you?  I have confused myself.  I am awful at putting into words what I feel. It is a glorious morning and I have a lot to do today.  The house is a mess and there are errands to run and we have our Community meeting tonight.  I always love having people over.  I feel God has blessed me with the gift of hospitality.  I just wish I could get the mess under control so that when an opportunity arrives I don't have to freek out and work for days to get an area ready.  I truly envy those people who have 6 kids, a perfectly neat house, work a little outside the home and make lots of money for what they do, homeschool and still have time and energy to have intimate times with their spouse.  And belive me I know they are out there.  Shame on me!  Shame on me!  I should be happy and grateful for what I have and I have A LOT!  Great children and a wonderful husband, a nice house and food to eat, and clothes on my back.  Shame on me! I pray that God bless you all and the you to realize that you are.

We made pizzas, talked, laughed, a little beer flowed, and Debi brought Mead (ancient drink - made from fermented honey) - wow! This stuff is goooood! Why have we let this fall to the ways side? Anyway, I think Robert and I are going to try and make some - in the monastic brewing tradition of course. I'll let you know if it works out. Matt brought chocolate pies - we ate some of that - had coffee - and went for a walk around the neighborhood. It was a good time. We were being a community - that's what we do.

       Hi, again...I forgot earlier that I wanted to recommend a really good movie to everyone.  I told the community a little about it the other night, but I want to share it with anyone out there who is interested in the history of "mountain music" or "bluegrass" or "folk music", whatever you like to call it.  The movie is called "Songcatcher", from the book of the same name, starring Aidan Quinn and some other fine actors (I really didn't notice the others--Aidan Quinn is in it, that was enough for me. :)  )  I rented it on DVD and liked it enough to watch it twice, the second time with the director's commentary. (DVD is such a cool toy!)  I will mention that if you have kids, you may not want to include them in viewing this until you've seen it yourself--there's some sexual content that may be objectionable to some.  I won't say any more than that because it will give some of the plot away and then Alan will be mad at me. :)  Anyway, I highly recommend this movie!

       Hey, everybody--sorry it's been so long since I contributed.  I feel a lot like our friend Dan, who says he doesn't like to say anything unless he's got something to say.  I don't want to come in here and just type for the sake of typing--I want it to be actually of interest to someone.  (I know, I know, you're thinking, "But she's not like that when I'm talking to her!")  Anyway, I wanted to put my two-cents-worth in about Wednesday night. I also thought it was a very good time, and a good talk.  I was a little worried there at first, though, Robert.  I thought for a minute there that you were gonna go all "fire and brimstone" on us, hangin' out in the OT and all.  It was good, though.  I've been doing a lot of meditating lately, as most of you who read this know, on prioritizing my life and getting rid of the "deadwood"; those activities and things that are in my way,  physically and emotionally and spiritually and every other -ly.  Knowing which things we are doing "for God" are actually important and pleasing to Him is a key to contentment, I think. I also wanted to share a little something with you all that I ran across in the Lexington Herald-Leader, of all places.  Last Sunday's paper had a section about Father's Day and several letters from fathers to their children, advice for their lives and such.  One of the better ones included a poem that I thought was really cool, so I wanted to share it with everyone.  It's titled, "My Symphony", by William Henry  Channing.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I did. "MY SYMPHONY" "To live content with small means, to seek elegance rather than luxury, and refinement rather than fashion, to be worthy, not respectable, and wealthy, not rich.  To study hard, think quietly, talk gently, act frankly, to listen to stars and birds, babes and sages, with open heart, to bear all cheerfully, do all bravely, await occasions, hurry never. "In a word, to let the spiritual, unbidden and unconscious, grow up through the common.  This is to be my symphony." Isn't that cool?  I also wanted to let everyone know that I have applied for a new position within my company with a little more money and responsibility, and it's looking really good for me to get it.  In fact, I was told by my supervisor that I am the person they actually had in mind for the job, but it was policy that they had to post it and announce it for everyone to have a chance to apply.  So if you all would keep this in prayer, that I would get the position if it's what God wants for me (if He wants something better, I'll take that instead :))  Also that if I do get the job, I'll be given the grace to handle the apparently intensive training that goes along with it.  Thanks! P.S.:  Also please keep in prayer my uncle, whom I've mentioned before--he's back in the hospital and apparently not doing all that great.  I know God's in control--God, help all the other family members (and Kenneth himself) to know that, also.

       Seems I always get on here at night after our meetings - there's my set way. Anyway, another good night. We had a full house tonight - the McGlones were over again - always good to have them hang with us. Matt also visitied tonight for the first time. He found our website and e-mailed me - then he was here tonight. It was good to have him with us. We had alot of fun - talked about "doing the word" - being more than just someone who does the compartmental "spiritual" things but one who lives their whole life abiding with Christ - constantly growing and being transformed. We talked a little about the whole notion being discussed by Brian McLaren, Dallas Willard, etc. about being a "follower of Christ" and not just haing the name "Christian." We discussed how this living it out is not being legalistic - that we are cooperating with the work of God in us on a constant basis - loong haul. It was a good talk. That's it for now.

       We all have a tendacy to get set in our ways and it is hard to change.  I should know because I have to make myself remember to come here and at least put something in.   I wanted to say that Robert's talk has stuck with me.  I actually thought about it just a short time ago.  I appreciate the fact that everyone has taken the time to "do" the discussion.  I know it has been a bit of a relief for Alan.   I also want to let you all know that I appreciate you and I truly enjoy when you come over.  I don't like getting the house ready but you all are always welcome.  I will just scoot all the clothes out of the way on the couch so you can have a place to sit.  You all are part of my true happiness. I think we should all try a bit harder to come here and share with each other.  Sometimes we think of things when we aren't around each other and this is the place to share it.  Just a thought.

       Tonight was good. Robert is on his turn at facilitating the meetings this month. We talked about "being happy" and all we pile on that - how we look for it and what is real vs. false happiness - good discussion.  urlLink Ashley McGlone , his wife Mary, and their boys Levi and Noah came to hang with us in our meeting tonight. It was good to have them here. It's cool that we're connecting with people here in Lexington who understand what we're doing.

        Where's everygody at!? Well, I'm here. Nothing spectacular happening in the community at present. Well, not that anyone can see anyway. Pehaps God is doing something "wonderful" at least, even if we can't see it yet. I suspect that is the case. I'm almost finished reading Brian McLaren's book  urlLink More Ready Than You Realize . This is seriously effecting my view of how to "reach people with the good news." I love it! I want our whole community to read this (don't worry guys - it's an easy read) and be effected by it. I'll write more about it later.

       Here's what we did last night: we went out to eat at a restaurant, talked as we ate, and then went to see The Lord of The Rings. It was a very good time. We had a good time just hanging out with each other and had some good conversation.   And let me tell you, I'm a late bloomer on this movie - I just saw it for the first time last night. I have been waiting for 20 years for this to be done justice to in film - I was not disappointed. I think I was on the verge of tears throughout the whole movie - just overwhelmed. Not just with the film - it was beautiful and extremely well done, but with the Kingdom undercurrent - overcurrent. I read those books 20 years ago and didn't see it so clearly then but as I watched this, it was so clear. Very good stuff.

       I'm not sure what I just did, but there's a paragraph somewhere out there in the ether....oh well, let's try again. I realized that it's been quite a while since the last time I checked in here, so I took the opportunity to catch up on my blog reading for like the last week....there's some good stuff there!  Congrats, Molly, on a successful blog attempt. Oh, yeah, and also to you and to Robert for graduating from your various programs. I had the chance yesterday to attend my first Greenhouse meeting, and I was very impressed, as I suspected I would be.  Lots of good input from all the participants.  Alan tells me I only met like half of the usual bunch, so I'm looking forward to meeting the other half soon. I met one girl who has a connection to someone getting ready to go to Ireland for a year (!) for missions.  I'm maybe a little bit jealous, but as Cara said for herself, I know I'm not spiritually or financially ready to jump into that just yet.  I do plan to pray for her friend and the team she's going with, though.  If I can't go myself just yet, I can at least pray for those who are going.   We talked a lot about things during the meeting like prayer walking, which I've heard about and even attempted before, but now I'm more fired up about the idea.  I really don't even know any of my neighbors, and those I know I don't really hang out with.  My apartment has always been just kind of a place to sleep in or veg out at, and my "life" really has always taken place "out there".  I've been wanting to start a program of walking for exercise with little success--maybe if I add this little twist it'll be something that's not just for my benefit and therefore something I might actually do. :) We also discussed the finer points of cooperating with other churches in our area in ministering to the city with no real agenda other than getting out the Good News....in other words, with no competition motives.  A simple idea, but seemingly chock full of obstacles and implications. It was refreshing to hear that these other people, whom I have much respect for and look to as mentors of a sort, are going through the same kind of issues we face in dealing with "building-oriented" churches. Alan, you'll be pleased to know that I visited the discussion board at the vbcc website, and amused to know that I didn't know it existed.  I even put my two-cents'-worth in! (Which is probably about what it was worth.)  Please understand that I'm a first-time traveler to the World Wide Web, and there are things I find fascinating that I'm sure all y'all are oh, so blase about.  Anyway, it was cool to find yet another way to connect with people all over the world and find like-minded folks.

       I have been here in front of my computer most of the evening, catching up on my blog reading (I actually made it through my  entire  list tonight!), and something interesting occurred to me, inspired by  urlLink Stephen Shields'  blog entry for June 23rd, where he debates the relative merits of online vs. facetime relationships.  Maybe it's just me, but there's something very "early church" about reading  "The Epistle of St. Kevin to the Lexingtonians"  or  "The Apostle Alan's Letter to the Church at Cincinnati" .  Tongue in cheek, to be sure, but think about it.  We read each other's writings as they become available, distribute what we receive (in the form of quotes) to other churches in our regions, and learn from each other what it means to follow Christ, even though we may only meet each other a few times a year (or maybe never, in the case of some of our brothers and sisters overseas).  I'm not trying to make a case for online-only community, but I  am  saying that there is much merit (and a healthy dose of Biblical precedent) in what we are doing here.  I'm not sure why I felt impressed to write this; maybe someone needs some encouragement not to lose heart, to keep on writing and sharing.

       Alan, I think the only thing we  didn't  do last night was blow smoke--we sucked up a good bit of it, second-hand, though.  I'm sorry that I forgot the Chick Tracts, but the praise and worship was very exciting!!  And it was way cool when Robert got up on the table and started preaching to everyone there.   (Oh, wait, that was the parallel universe nightmare version.  Never mind.)   I think Common Grounds worship was a definite do-over (and over and over...).  It was great seeing Linder Souzer again, and her sister was a great addition to the mix.  Finally, another woman who's not afraid to speak her mind! McCarthy's was cool, too; I'm just sorry I wimped out on my "half" of Guinness.  The one really good thing about Guinness is, it fills you up way before it makes you drunk (at least, that's my experience).  I think that if I were the type to have time to "hang out" in a bar, it would be one like McCarthy's (and not just because I'm looking for an Irish man!).  It was a very relaxing, low-key kind of atmosphere, with pictures of the Founding Fathers on the wall (you know, Mick Collins and Dev and the boys). As far as the discussion at Common Grounds goes, the one thing I took away that made the most impression on me was the "potluck" analogy that Linda made.  Being a community is much like participating in a potluck dinner.  Everyone has something to bring to the "table", and to fully experience the dinner, you have to sample a little of what everyone has brought.  This means we all feed each other, and we all benefit from what the other folks have contributed.  If someone in the group is famous for their sweet potato casserole and they don't bring it, then everyone has lost out on part of the "community experience."   (I'm not sure if I'm saying this in a coherent manner--it's always a bad idea to start writing food metaphors just before dinner.)   Anyway, the point is that we all have unique giftings to offer a community, even if we think we don't, and the community loses out if those giftings aren't utilized.

       Last night we did things a little different. We met in a local coffee house that we all like called Common Grounds. It has a great atmosphere. There were 8 of us with our good friend Linda from Cape Cod and her sister Cathy. We had a great discussion - more on the "rule of life" in Romans 12 - very good talk. Obviously we drank coffee too - and yes, cleaned up after ourselves and put money in the tip jar (please do this if you're going to sit in a place like that for 2 hours). We will be doing that again - we all really had a good time.  After, we stood out front talking for another while - some of us went home - then Debi, Matt, and I went to a local Irish bar called McCarthy's - very cool place. This is, by the way, not just a bar with an Irish name - it is seriously an Irish bar. There are times you can walk in and hear only Irish accents in this place. Anyway, more good talk, and one smooth pint of Guinness later, we went home. It was a good night with the community - living community. I hope somebody else gets on here and talks about how good it was so I don't sound like I'm just blowing smoke...

       OK, I'm FINALLY bloggin'...here we go......    Hanging out @ VBCC for the last month or so has really been a breath of fresh air.  I've seen so much that just clicks with what's been inside of me for most of my life following Jesus (about 17 yrs).  But for the last several years, even though I've grown & seen a lot, parts of me have shut down.  When I first gave my life to the Lord it was in the context of community.  I went on a youth retreat (callled Youth Encounter the Savior) without knowing hardly anyone there.  But I found such acceptance & love it made it easy for me to see Jesus & how much I needed him.  I wanted to experience what I was seeing. It was something worth laying down my life for .  These people came from all walks of life but had this common bond.  Soon after that weekend I became involved in a little prayer group with some kids I met at the retreat.  The group grew from 5 of us to around 50-60 within just a few months.  Most of these were teenagers like me.  It was real community.  It was messy.  Fun.  Exciting.  We just simply got together each Thurs night to worship & pray for each other.  This experience shaped me for the rest of my life.  In good ways, but it also has made it hard for me.  Most other church experiences I've had fell short of this community experience.    But lately God has really been chasing after me in regard to community.  I think, in a lot of ways, I've romanticized it.  I've longed to be in a group of friends where I can let it all hang out...be myself warts & all...and still find that love & acceptance.  As important as that is, it's kinda one sided.  Community is hard work (at times).  We have to give. We have to allow people to finally point to some of those warts & say, "you know, that's really ugly.  It's holding you back from being who you can really be."    Last Wed night we talked about Romans 12 in context of community.  I've spent the last week chewing on that chapter & have been challenged with how little it's focused on me & my needs.  It's much more about deferring to one another.   offer your bodies as living sacrifices   (v1).   Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought.  (v3)   each member (of the body) belongs to all the others   (v5)    Be devoted to one another.  Honor one another above yourselves   (v10)    etc etc    I've spent the last 9 months living in what was supposed to be a sort of communal living arrangement.  But it's only worked out so far for 2 of us to share the house.   Had some friends over Sun night & we started talking about relationships.  My roommate (Joseph) & I started talking about different fights we've had.  It was pretty funny.  But we could see how for whatever reason (God?) we've both committed to this friendship & we've really slugged through a lot of issues.  It's seems like it's kind of unusual for 2 guys to commit to a friendship at this level.  Because we are so different, we've both given each other plenty of reasons to say "the hell with it" and quit the friendship.  But God is forming a sort of David & Johnathan friendship.      I don't know why either of us have had the grace this time around. How many relationships have I let fall by the wayside, just because my needs weren't getting met?...or because it was just too much work?      Do I enter into a church/community looking for how it can meet my needs?  Will I be fed?  Will I like the worship?  That's important stuff, I know.  But is it the most important?  Or is it like seeking 1st the kingdom of God & all these other things fall into place.  Do we seek to pour ourselves into other people's lives & then find ourselves surprised at how much of our own needs are met in the meantime?

       I read Alan's blog for the day on his personal blog, and decided to check out  urlLink Jeremiah Smith's  blog.  Understand that when I check out a new blog, if I like the initial entries I see, I scroll down to the beginning and read all of what's shown chronologically.  It helps me get a sense of the person, and I'm maybe a little bit anal. Anyway, there's a prayer there on his June 14th entry that I liked really well, so I thought I'd reproduce it here for you:  My Lord God I have no idea where I am going. I do not see the road ahead of me. I cannot know for certain where it will end. Nor do I really know myself, and the fact that I think I am following your will does not mean that I am actually doing so. But I believe that my desire to please you does in fact please you. And I hope that I have that desire in all that I am doing. I hope that I will never do anything apart from that desire. And I know that if I do this you will lead me by the right road though I may know nothing about it Therefore will I trust you always though I may seem to be lost and in the shadow of death. I will not fear, for you are ever with me, and you will never leave me to face my perils alone. Thomas Merton (1915-1968)  Very good stuff!!!

       Yeah, Robert!!! It must have been, as my dad would say, that "you just weren't holding your mouth right," whatever that means.  Anyway, as Alan says, now you have no excuse. "Pssst! Get a Mac!"  :) I like what you said there,  "just as the bread and wine...so are we joined to Christ without ceasing to be individuals..."  That's good stuff--did you think that up yourself?  I think I'm going to need to meditate on Romans 12 for several days before I'm able to even scratch the surface of what's there for us as a "rule" of life in community.  What we discussed was very good, and deep, and deserves much more thought on my part before I try to pigeonhole it.  One thing Alan said that I thought was particularly good was his differentiation between "conform" and "transform"; that "conformity" is an outside-in, more temporal kind of change, whereas "transformation" is an inside-out, eternal change.  Good stuff. I got a copy of the tape from my former church--the speaker's name was Desmond Frey (pronounced  "fray" ), and he's the dean of Rhema Bible Training Center in Bonn, Germany.  I will post my notes from the tape on  urlLink The Scriptorium , but one thing I will tell here.  He referenced a couple of scriptures together that I had never thought about in conjunction with each other before; Isaiah 55:10-11 and John 1:1.  Together they read,  "As the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return to it without watering the earth and making it flourish, so that it yields seed for the sower and bread for the eater, so is my word that goes out from my mouth:  it will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose of which I sent it......In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."  This is also going to take much meditation to glean what God wants me to from it.  What I have so far is this:  Not only did Jesus accomplish all that He was meant to before He went back to the Father, but, in virtue of the fact that He lives in us,  we  will not go back to the Father before accomplishing all that He intends for  us .  This is very encouraging, but I am sure that there is much more that God wants me to learn through this before He's done with it. Well, it looks like the Vine & Branches Singles Group (otherwise known as Brian, Matt, and myself) will be going to a Lexington Legends game tomorrow night.  (They are our local "farm" baseball team and I have never seen them play.  It should be fun.)

       Okay!  Hot dog!  This is the first time I have actually gotten the blogger to work on my own without Divine Intervention (or at least Alan's Intervention).  Last night, we spoke briefly about religious communes.  I commented that there were very few actually "orthodox" Christian communes out there.  It seems like the ones that succeed are the wierdos!  Think of all the communes and communal groups you've heard of--at least the major ones--and you'll see what I mean: the Shakers, Oneida, the Branch Davidians, etc.  The Shakers believed Mother Ann was the female incarnation of Christ... Oneida shared sexual partners (or, rather, the leader "shared" everybody's wife if you want to be exact)... and so on.  The real Christian groups falter more often.  Why are the ones that seem to work and function the longest usually wacko?  Well, first, I think it's harder to be "orthodox" (ok, it's a really formal sounding word that gets people ticked off and thinking about nit-picky arguments over doctrine, but that's not what I really have in mind) and still hold a community of believers together in love.  Unorthodox groups usually reject the Trinity.  A quick study will bear me out on this point.  Faith in the Trinity gives Christianity the vision of a perfect society existing in God.  There is role-diversity but co-equality.  Jesus can say his Father is "greater" than he is and that he "does his Father's will," while the two enjoy a basic, essential oneness and equality in Godhood, power and glory.  That's a hard vision of society to bring into actual being.  How many times do our leaders allow themselves to be "on the same level" as the people who submit themselves to them?  How many times do we look at the different "roles" in our society as being different in terms of prestige?  How often we try to "lord it over" one another!  It is hard to bring the Trinitarian life of God into actual, social existence because it runs against the grain of all we've been taught.  Cultic groups that throw out the Trinity (and the Incarnation of Christ too for that matter) don't have this problem: if you're an absolute Monotheist minus the Trinity, you have a totally different "vision" of the perfect society--one where an autocratic dictator sends down external laws to be obeyed.  That "vision" of society is easier.  It's the broad highway we find ourselves on each and every day in our culture, instead of the narrow one that Christ calls us to, the one where we must "in honor, prefer one another," let the "greatest among you... serve," and keep the "unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace."  Second, cultic groups often simply attempt to reproduce the personality of the leader within all the individuals involved.  Our God is one, but is still three distinct Persons.  Orthodox Christian teaching requires us to allow each other's creative impulses and opinions to interact.  We've all heard that Proverb that says, "As iron sharpens iron, so a man sharpens his brother."  Iron can only sharpen iron where there is some friction!  When leaders hammer down on their followers and create a questionless environment where nobody ever disagrees, nobody gets sharpened!  Sure, it's easier that way, but it accomplishes nothing in the way of spiritual progress.  Friction wears down an engine, but without any friction at all an engine will never accomplish anything or move anything whatsoever.  Better to occasionally have to change the oil and repair the parts than to let those parts spin forever without contacting or rubbing together and never move!  Just as the bread and wine in communion become the body and blood of Jesus without ceasing to be bread and wine, so are we joined to Christ without ceasing to be individuals with distinct personalities, likes and dislikes.  The high road of interaction and real community (instead of conformity to a list of rules and demands) is a hard, narrow road--exactly the hard, narrow road Christ called us to--and "few there be that find it."  Whether we live in a "commune" or simply interact as a Christian community, there's something to be learned here.  When we let Jesus Christ be our example and the pattern for our lives, and the Trinity be our blueprint for society, we set ourselves upon a difficult but rewarding journey.  Let's follow it, take the path less travelled, and find a better life in the place where it leads.

       Last night was good I think. Everybody else can chime in if they want. We did communion first - entering in through what Jesus did. We each went up to the "altar," lit a candle, said out loud something we were thankful for, and received Christ in the eucharist, went back and sat down to meditate. We sat quiet for a minute or two, then sang a song - great song by Dave Nixon of  urlLink Vineyard Central  called Your Mercy. Then we prayed for each other - layed hands on each other and prayed for whatever. We got some coffee and proceeded into a discussion of Romans chapter 12 as "a rule of life." Thanks to  urlLink Mark Palmer  of  urlLink The Landing Place  in Columbus, Ohio, a good friend, for being the catalyst for this talk. We looked at the whole chapter as one thought and saw an overall rule of life for Christians - from general laying your life down to God as sacrifice, to recognizing who you are, to living in community - in love for those inside - to loving those outside and living in peace. Good stuff! Then we hung out and had more fun as usual. That's it for now.

       Daggone it! I just had this great entry all typed out and went and hit the wrong button.......Oh, well, let's try again.... I had a very interesting lunch with some folks from the "traditional" church I came from to help with VBCC....they told me about the special speaker they had at church this morning.  I can't remember his name, I think the last name was Frey and he was from Germany (ring any bells?)...anyway, he talked to them about the house church movement in Europe and how this was the "trend" now.  His three main points were (get this!)  living intentionally, living relationally, and living generously. Hmmmmmm......I plan to get the tape of the service and listen for myself; it should be a good one.  I have to admit, I got amused at how excited these folks were about hearing these concepts (and, maybe a little superior, too.  Mercy, Father!)  I really hope they take the message to heart and realize that it was God's voice they heard today, but I know that this is a very difficult message for a "faith" church to get hold of.  Pray with me that this sparks some positive changes.

       I've been checking out some of the blog links on  urlLink Alan's blog , and you all should check out Amber Bishop's July 5th entry at  urlLink Whatischurch .  I think we can all agree with her sentiments there.

       Well, I see Alan has told all the stuff I was going to say.....man, you took my answer!  Actually, he's right--it was a very good time.  No mead or any other "enhancements" this time, but we still managed to get through it. :) I'm really looking forward to hearing more from Todd Hunter and the others who spoke at the Search Party thing; what we heard last night was very encouraging.  We listened to the talk on the "story" of the gospel not being merely about getting to go to Heaven when we die, but also about getting to live the story of Jesus while we're here.  One of the major things I got from the talk was Todd's definition of "believe":  to place one's confidence and trust in.  I probably have heard this definition before, but it seemed fresh last night.  There's a real tendency to say, "I believe in Jesus" in the same way as we might say, "I believe in gravity," as a head knowledge kind of thing.  The real turning point is that heart knowledge of "I put my trust in Jesus, not just in the 'sweet by and by', but every day for all aspects of life."  I know I have to consciously shake myself sometimes and say, "Hey, wait a minute! Who's side am I on anyway?  Oh, yeah, the  winning  side!" That's not to imply any we vs. them attitude towards people, just towards God vs. Satan.  Anyway, the concept of "story" was a good one to hear.  Keep 'em coming, Alan!

       We met last night - good time. We talked about what was going on in our lives. Many times when we do this it's just regular stuff - not always wild and terrible things going on. Conor was bitten by a Rotweiler last week - doing fine - just one nice "puncture wound", as he likes to call it, in his right arm. Debi sang at a 4th shindig in Indiana and got to share with a family about her Grave's disease - how she is recovering from it - medicine being backed off, etc. Brian's having a hard week at work - worn out - Matt too - things getting hectic. Robert and Molly continue to plan on moving back to Tulsa in August, which, as the abbot, I have told them time an again is strictly forbidden - they're not listening!  We prayed a little while. Then we listened to  urlLink Todd Hunter  (who's coaching me in this church plant) talk (via CD) about "rehearing the Church's story" from the  urlLink Search Party  conference I was at in St. Louis in May. Very challenging, paradigm busting stuff. Then we talked about how we can live in that new story for a little while - good stuff. I think we are getting to a good place - understanding why we're here - what God is doing with us - how through our natural relationships with people, and not through some program, He will work through us to help people walk into His Kingdom Life.

       Hi, it's me again.  I just wanted to let you guys know that Alan helped me set up my own blog this afternoon. It's called  urlLink The Scriptorium , and I'm so excited to have my own space to speak in, so I don't take up quite so much space here.  I'm starting to notice that my entries here are getting longer and longer, so I thought it was time to have my own "venue".  I'll still post here, too; just maybe not so many rabbit trails. (Maybe.)

       OK, I'm back again....just wanted to update you on the finding of the gunpowder guy and do a little  urlLink Ashley McGlone -inspired venting on one of my soapboxes for a paragraph or two. I was able to hook up with a friend of mine from work, Krasi Ianeva, and her husband, Boko, who are from Bulgaria, and we went downtown in Lexington to see the fireworks.  Needless to say, this adventure started a bit late, since it's best if you wait 'til it's dark before you start shooting off those things.  So we got downtown and staked out our standing spot around 10PM.  We had with us one of Krasi and Boko's friends, Milen, also from Bulgaria, and it was a good time.  I was amazed when I looked at my watch and saw that the show had only lasted about 15-20 minutes, because it seemed longer.  There was so much packed into such a short time. After the fireworks, we went to Milen's apartment, where Krasi had started dinner before we left.  She is such a good cook! And, yes, we ate at, like, 11PM.  Another of Krasi and Boko's friends, Zdravko (also Bulgarian) came over and we all hung out, eating and drinking Heinekens (OK, singular for me), and I got home at around 1AM.  I had to be up by 6AM for work, so I was one tired puppy today.  But I had such fun, it was worth it. OK, now for the soapbox.  I just finished reading Ashley's blog for July 1st (link above), and was inspired to look up an old book in my library that has a great quote in it.  Ashley talks in his blog about how the church treats "disenfranchised" people, gays in particular.  I e-mailed him with this quote from "AIDS: Ministry in the Midst of an Epidemic" by Wendall W. Hoffman & Stanley J. Grenz: "While most Christians find homosexual practices sinful, we must nevertheless consider the extent that current attitudes toward homosexuality in society and in the church actually serve to compound the problem....To what degree are homosexually oriented persons driven to the gay community....because they are unable to find community within the wider society and more specifically within our churches?  To what extent have we as Christians been guilty of sinning against persons with a homosexual orientation because of our failure to show love and to offer them the true fellowship they are seeking?  The church is called to be a community in which fallen creatures can find fellowship and reconciliation with God and with one another." Sharing this with you all is not meant to be a condemnation of anyone; rather, it is meant to be an encouragement to those who are reaching out to this group of people who desperately need to know that God doesn't hate them, but desires relationship with them just as He does with all of us. It is also meant to point out just how important this ministry can be.  Lives actually hang in the balance, not just eternal lives but earthly lives.  I guess I can get off the soapbox for now.  If anybody has any comments, go to the  urlLink discussion board  and let's talk about it. Debi

       Hey, all!  It's the 4th of July--which, in keeping with Alan's apolitical stand, is a great day to kick back, sleep late, catch up on some blog reading, and then go watch some guy blow up a lot of gunpowder! (Only a minor dig at you, Alan; you know I'm growing closer to your views on things politic every day.) We had a great time at the gathering last night--Alan actually "went short" and meant it (that's not why it went great, tho').  We did the evening office, which I'm still getting used to (where's the "three hymns and a poem"?).  I enjoyed it; it was a good spiritual time and we discussed what we had read afterward, which I suspect is not always done with the traditional evening office.  We missed Molly and Robert (things were much quieter, for some reason).  I really wish they could have been there, but they're out in Tulsa, spyin' out the land.  I have to admit that I'm really conflicted about this.  I want God's best for them, and if Tulsa is what He wants for them, then OK;  but I have really grown to love them both in the short time I've known them and hate to think of them moving halfway across the country.  Thank God for the internet, I guess! OK, I know I'm a website novice, but I really didn't know that Alan had his own blog set up.  I should have known that one outlet wasn't enough for him!  Anyway, I took some time this morning to go there and catch up on reading his "deep thoughts" (and also the not-so-deep ones).  Re: the "love shack"; I read what you had to say and as I was, I remembered a song from the early 90's from a Christian band called Jacob's Trouble (anybody remember them?).  Anyway, the song is called "Lovehouse"  and I thought I would share the lyrics with you all so you know that the concept is not just an 80's phenom.  Here goes..... LOVEHOUSE Love, baby, love is getting hard to find/Don't seem like much to go around/Peace, baby, peace is like a river/But it's been flowing underground too long/There's a place I know where we can go...//CHORUS: Come on down to the house of love/This is the house where love lives/Come on down to the house of love/This is the house, this is the place//Kick, baby, kick it back and stay a while/Forget all about your best laid plans, man/Shake, baby, shake it loose and celebrate/Lose your shoes and join the dance/Dance, dance, dance/Come on in and find peace of mind... That's an abbreviated version, but you get the idea.  So now I'm going to make myself presentable and go see Men In Black II with Brian and Matt--yee, haw!!  Then I hope to hook up with some friends from work and see if we can't find a guy who's blowing up a lot of gunpowder.  "It's a good thing," as Martha would say. Later! Debi

       Our retreat on Saturday was a very good thing. We appreciate very much Dave and Jody Nixon and Kevin and Tracy Rains from  urlLink Vineyard Central  for coming down to hang with us and infect us with some of their wisdom. We had a great time. We ate, talked, sang, worshiped, prayed, talked more - good stuff. We were very encouraged. I think it confirmed in us that we really are going in a good direction - we just had to see that we were. It was good to have that "outside" view. Connectedness is a good thing. It doesn't have to be institutional. Get some cool friends you respect and love to come look at you, talk to you, etc. It doesn't have to be some big fancy thing. Again, thanks to those guys!

       We had a great time last night at our monthly potluck!  (We did miss Kathy and Joy, who couldn't make it.)  We basically made it into a birthday party for Brian, who turned 36 on Tuesday. After dinner, we all (even the kids) played Trivial Pursuit, my favorite game in the world.  It was great fun, even the part where everyone talked and shouted at once (although I may not have seemed like I was having fun, I was).  I absolutely adore Alan and Liz's kids.  They are lots of fun, especially now that they're getting older.  It's interesting, too, the things you find out about people by playing Trivial Pursuit with them--the subjects they know a lot about give you good insights into who they are.  We found out last night that Matt is well able to hold his own with Alan and myself  (not bragging here, it's just hard to find people who want to play with us because we think we know it all) .  But of course, we had to let Alan win, since he's the Senior Pastor and all  (OK, did everybody catch the sarcasm drippin' there?) .  Anyway, it was great fun, even if Alan  did  win--again!

       Romans 12   From   The Message   So here’s what I want you to do, God helping you:  Take your everyday, ordinary life – your sleeping, eating, going-to-work, and walking-around life – and place it before God as an offering.  Embracing what God does for you is the best thing you can do for him.  Don’t become so well adjusted to your culture that you fit into it without even thinking.  Instead, fix your attention on God.  You’ll be changed from the inside out.  Readily recognize what he wants from you, and quickly respond to it. Unlike the culture around you, always dragging you down to its level of immaturity.  God brings the best out of you, develops well-formed maturity in you.   I’m speaking to you out of deep gratitude for all that God has given me, and especially as I have responsibilities in relation to you. Living then, as every one of you does, in pure grace, it’s important that you not misinterpret yourselves as people who are bringing this goodness to God.  No, God brings it all to you.  The only accurate way to understand ourselves is by what God is and by what he does for us, not by what we are and what we do for him.   In this way we are like the various parts of a human body.  Each part gets its meaning from the body as a whole, not the other way around. The body we’re talking about is Christ’s body of chosen people.  Each of us finds our meaning and function as a part of his body.   But as a chopped-off finger or cut-off toe we wouldn’t amount to much, would we?  So since we find ourselves fashioned into all these excellently formed and marvelously functioning parts in Christ’s body, let’s just go ahead and be what we were made to be, without enviously or pridefully comparing ourselves with each other, or trying to be something we aren’t.   If you preach, just preach God’s Message, nothing else; if you help, just help, don’t take over; if you teach, stick to your teaching; if you give encouraging guidance, be careful that you don’t get bossy; if you’re put in charge, don’t manipulate; if you’re called to give aid to people in distress, keep your eyes open and be quick to respond; if you work with the disadvantaged, don’t let yourself get irritated with them or depressed by them.  Keep a smile on your face.   Love from the center of who you are; don’t fake it.  Run for dear life from evil; hold on for dear life to good.  Be good friends who love deeply; practice playing second fiddle.   Don’t burn out; keep yourselves fueled and aflame. Be alert servants of the Master, cheerfully expectant.  Don’t quit in hard times; pray all the harder. Help needy Christians; be inventive in hospitality.   Bless your enemies; no cursing under your breath.  Laugh with your happy friends when they’re happy; share tears when they’re down.  Get along with each other; don’t be stuck-up.  Make friends with nobodies; don’t be the great somebody.   Don’t hit back; discover beauty in everyone.  If you’ve got it in you, get along with everybody.  Don’t insist on getting even; that’s not for you to do.  “I’ll do the judging,” says God.  “I’ll take care of it.”   Our Scriptures tell us that if you see your enemy hungry, go buy that person lunch, or if he’s thirsty, get him a drink. Your generosity will surprise him with goodness.  Don’t let evil get the best of you; get the best of evil by doing good.

       Hi, guys! Just a quick "praise report" about last night.  One of the things we did last night was pray for various needs of ourselves and others--I had a prayer request on behalf of one the young men at work, Paul, whose grandfather (who raised him) had had what was thought to be several strokes and is in ICU.  I spoke to Paul this morning and told him we had prayed for his grandfather.  He thanked us, of course, and let me know that his grandfather's condition is now much less serious than they had thought.  It wasn't strokes, it turned out that Paul's grandfather is diabetic and had been warned against eating foods high in potassium.  The family didn't realize that tomatoes and cantelope have lots of potassium, and apparently they had been eating a lot of those.  So the reaction of the elevated potassium levels shut down his kidneys temporarily and caused stroke-like symptoms.  Paul said his grandfather should be out of ICU and into a regular room by tomorrow.  Praise God!!

       Good meeting last night. I was sort of fried so Liz lead the meeting. More on Romans 12. I swear I think you could spend your whole life on this thing and still not totally get it all. We talked about verse 3 - the "estimate yourself soberly" one - not thinking too highly of yourself. Everyone shared about ways in which they perhaps thought too highly of themselves and how we could go about correcting that. It was good - brought out some of our stuff - honesty - good. We prayed for a little bit, then celebrated the Eucharist (we always do this).  Our meeting times aren't always or even often spectacular. If we tried to make them that way, it would be rather fake anyway, so no point. And thinking that they have to be something like that every time we meet is against the grain of our philosophy of community. It would cut against the "long-haul" and the "more than a meeting" mentality that we're trying to foster in one another. We're not about getting everything done in the once a week meeting. It can't be done - was never meant to be done - so we don't try to do it. Our formation into the image of Christ is a wholisitc thing that happens all the time, by many means. We're not about "quick-fixes" either. Things don't generally work that way in the spiritual life. We are in process. It's a long haul thing, not an instantaneous fixer-upper.  I hope all that makes some sense. We live as community. We go along doing what we know to do. We listen and evolve as we need to. God transforms us along the way.

       Just checking out some other blogs & saw a cool posting on finding rest.  It was on  Laura O.'s blog Record of My Insanity  urlLink    Reminds me of a passage in   The Message  .  I have been holding on to these verses for a while now.  It seems God keeps bringing me back to this truth.  We don't find our rest in things, accomplishments, etc. etc. etc.  We find our value, our worth, and our rest in him.  We do make it so difficult.      Matthew 11.  Are you tired?  Worn out?   Burned out on religion?  Come to me.  Get away with me and you'll recover your life. I'll show you how to take a real rest.  Walk with me and work with me - watch how I do it.  Learn the unforced rhythms of grace.  I won't lay anything heavy or ill-fitting on you.  Keep company with me and you'll learn to live freely and lightly.

Anyway, I'm up here to hang with him tonight and also  urlLink Jason Evans  from  urlLink Matthew's House  in San Diego. Jason's coming into Indianapolis for some conference and is swinging over here tonight after he flies in to hang with us. Very cool. The whole thing is amazing - how God has woven so many of us together who are doing similar things from all over the country, through the internet. Now we're getting together with each other. Very amazing - very encouraging.  Kevin and I have become very good friends over the past year and a half - God has really given us that gift. I'm grateful for it. He's a very good man - and he's purty cause he looks like me! I've also gotten to know Jason over this past year - via meeting online, seeing each others sites, talking about our communities, etc. We actually got to hang some in person at Search Party in St. Louis in May. Tonight will be fun. If we solve any of the great problems of church planting in the 21st century, I'll let you know. We may just drink beer and laugh. That'll be good too.

       This weekend I have spent most of my "spiritual time" on searching the Scriptures on the subject of tithing, inspired by the ongoing debate at  urlLink Rachel Cunliffe's blog .  I blogged my results on  urlLink  The Scriptorium ; it's too long to try to reproduce here, so go there if you're interested.   The bottom line is that I don't believe tithing is supportable as a "doctrine", but a really good idea, especially if you're not disciplined about listening to God telling you where to give and when and then  doing what He says .  I do, of course, think that  living life open-handedly is part of being a Christian; I just have a problem with the concept of coerced giving to support the "machine" that some churches have become.  I should say that VBCC has never gone down that road--here your giving is entirely between you and God.  I actually think it would be cool to do the "...and the believers shared everything in common" thing; logistically, in America, I'm not sure how it would be implemented.  Anyway, I'm not trying to reproduce the debate here--I just wanted to share what I've been doing with myself this weekend and invite anyone interested to read what I wrote.

       We've been talking about Romans 12 for a little while - as a rule of life. I wanted to post a bit of the outline for what we discussed in this past weeks meeting. This will give you an idea of some of what we've been talking about. Here goes...  We started with a quote (longer than this actually) from The New Man by Thomas Merton - on spiritual identity   "But if my true spiritual identity is found in my identification with Christ, then to know myself fully, I must know Christ. And to know Christ I must know the Father, for Christ is the image of the Father. The "identity" which begins to make itself known and felt within me, under the action of the Holy Spirit, is the identity of a son of the Father: a son who is re-created in the likeness of the only Son, Who is the perfect Image of the Father. The beginning of self-realization in the fullest Christian sense is therefore a sharing in the orientation which directs Christ, as Word, entirely to His Father. And here we truly enter into the deep mystery of God."    "All of us, gazing with unveiled face on the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as from the Lord who is the Spirit."  –2 Corinthians 3:18  "Do not conform yourselves to this age but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and pleasing and perfect."  –Romans 12:2   Transformed is same word - metamorphoo - to be changed into another form - to be transfigured.  What form are we being re-made into?  According to 2 Cor. 3:18, into the image we are to be looking at - gazing at - with unveiled faces - into that same image - the image of Jesus the Lord. The word "gazing" or "beholding" is "looking at as in a mirror" - has to do with reflection - gazing as into a mirror.  We look at Him and see ourselves in Him - our real selves - who we really are - not the illusion - not what has been stacked up on top of the real. We allow Him to show us who we really are and we become that by His activity in us.  "Glory" has to do with how something seems - it being apparent to those who look at us. I've heard it described as "manifested presence." It does have to do with manifestation for sure - something being brought out in the open for all to see. That's it. the more we look at Him and allow Him to show us and make us into who we really are, the more we will look like Him - the more apparent it will be who we are, who we are a part of.  We've been talking about Romans 12 as a rule of life. A rule of life is something to spend some time on, wouldn't you think? We're going to spend some time getting to know this. If we think we've known it already, we're going to lay that all down and pretend like we're ignorant. Then we're going to allow God to teach us what that all means all over again - in a fresh way, forgetting our presuppositions.   > Talk about how your life has been transformed in some way  > Has your view of how transformation happens changed at all - how?  > What are some things we can do as a community to cultivate a life of "gazing" and transformation?   It was a good conversation - and we will continue to have it until we re-learn some of those things we thought we already knew.

They will remain blog team members on the vine so they can tell their story from where they're going. We're looking forward to hearing about what they do there.

       Here's a nice Vine & Branches quote from our friend Thomas Merton (from The New Man):   "...this new life in us is an extension of Christ's own risen life. It forms and integral part of that new existence which He inaugurated when He rose from the tomb. Before He died on the Cross, the historical Christ was alone in His human and physical existence. As He Himself said, 'unless the grain of wheat fall into the ground and die, it remains alone. But if it die, it brings forth much fruit.' (John 12:25) Rising from the dead, Jesus lived no longer merely in Himself. He became the vine of which we are the branches. He extends His personality to include each one of us who are united to Him by faith."   Meaty, chewy stuff - chew the cud for a while...

       Robert and Molly are moving to Tulsa next week. We're sad to see them go. It's exciting to see them move into a new stage of life though. We will be praying for them as an extended member of the vbcc family constantly. I think they're going to start some kind of "thing" in their house - sounds interesting. We're taking them out next week to celebrate our friendship with them. We'll miss them.  We have a new friend it seems - Kathy and her daughter Joy. We're looking forward to getting to know them more.

       I went to the Cincinnati Celtic Music and Cultural Festival yesterday, and had a wonderful time.  I'll tell about most of it on  urlLink The Scriptorium  later today sometime, but one of the better things I did while there I thought would fit better here. I attended an interesting but far too short lecture entitled, "Anam Cara:  A Life's Journey", given by Rev. Andrew MacAoidh Jergens (I assume he is a Rev. somewhere in Cincinnati, but am not sure where).  The lecture was only a half-hour long, and didn't begin to cover all that was in the accompanying handout.  I could have listened to this for an hour or two, at least.   Anam cara , for those who aren't familiar with the concept, means "soul friend" in Irish gaelic.  Rev. Jergens' definition is,  "A friend who is an equal who shares your spiritual journey."  Here, from the handout, are the  Seven Qualities of the Soul Friend Tradition:  1.  Great affection; a personal relationship, rather than a professional or technical one. 2.  Mutuality, non-hierarchical, a relationship of mutual blessing.  Sometimes there were elements of the master-disciple relationship, but the persons involved considered themselves as companions along the way. 3.  Common values and common vision of reality. 4.  Challenge, or accountability.  A willingness to challenge one another, springing from the trust and affection of deep friendship, rather than from an unequal relationship. 5.  God-centered, God being the soul friend in whom all other friendships are united.  True soul friends do not depend on each other alone, but root their relationship in God. 6.  Transcends geographical separation, the passage of time, even death.  For the Celt, who saw the border between this world and the next as very thin indeed, even death could not break the bond established in soul friendship. 7.  Value both companionship and solitude. Does any of this sound familiar?

       Just in case anyone is not aware of it, today is  urlLink Alan's  birthday!!  Everyone visit his blog and give him a shout out on the big 3-6.  Dude, you're catching up with me! (OK, not really, but it's fun to think of that way.)  We're having our potluck tonight and I suppose there might be a cake or something.....we'll see.

       Matt, Debi, Liz and I (and my whole family) are here in Cincinnati tonight - at  urlLink Vineyard Central  getting ready for tomorrow's regional worship event, super allgroup, whatever you want to call it. It has been great just hanging out, meeting people, eating, working, getting ready. It's a very cool thing to do something together with many other parts of the Body. We are NOT alone you know. Tomorrow we'll be really acting like we're not separate. We will be demonstrating that we are one. I think we're all excited about it. Our family is suffering the great hospitality of the Brownhouse tonight - I don't know if we can stand it. It infects you with the desire to go and do the same - to invite people to come stay with you and serve them. I want to do that. I'll blog more tomorrow night and let you know how things go. Pax vobiscum.

       OK, our community meets together on Wednesday nights - that was last night - the 11th. Here was out interesting topic of conversation:  I want to do something a little different tonight. This is a signigicant date - sept. 11. A terrible thing happened today, one year ago. Terrible things happen every day. Things happen to us, to our families, to our friends. People do evil things to other people. It's the way of things in this sick and fallen world. You'd think we would be used to that.  What are we about though? Are we about those evil things? As children of God, brothers and sisters of Jesus - are we about getting back at those who do evil things? We should think about that very seriously. We should be very serious about what we think the Kingdom of God is all about.  I want us to go over a few scriptures on this significant day and talk about them. I'm not sure if many people will be focusing on these scriptures today, but we are.   Romans 12:17-21   Do not repay anyone evil for evil; be concerned for what is noble in the sight of all. If possible, on your part, live at peace with all. Beloved, do not look for revenge but leave room for the wrath; for it is written, "Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord." Rather, "if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by so doing you will heap burning coals upon his head." Do not be conquered by evil but conquer evil with good.    Matt. 5:38-48  (Lev. 19:18 > love your "countrymen", hate your enemies)  "You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.' But I say to you, offer no resistance to one who is evil. When someone strikes you on (your) right cheek, turn the other one to him as well. If anyone wants to go to law with you over your tunic, hand him your cloak as well. Should anyone press you into service for one mile,  go with him for two miles. Give to the one who asks of you, and do not turn your back on one who wants to borrow. "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I say to you, love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your heavenly Father, for he makes his sun rise on the bad and the good, and causes rain to fall on the just and the unjust. For if you love those who love you, what recompense will you have? Do not the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet your brothers only, what is unusual about that? Do not the pagans do the same? So be perfect, just as your heavenly Father is perfect.    Ephesians 6:12-13   For our struggle is not with flesh and blood but with the principalities, with the powers, with the world rulers of this present darkness, with the evil spirits in the heavens. Therefore, put on the armor of God, that you may be able to resist on the evil day and, having done everything, to hold your ground.   > How hard are these sayings to you?  > What do we do with these principles?  > What might need to change in your outlook upon deeply considering these things?

       Had a good time last night. We hung out as usual, prayed a shortened version of the evening prayer from the liturgy of the hours (only one Psalm - 62 - and the Reading - 1 Peter 5:5b-7). That went well. We prayed in choir style, reading it back and forth to each other - males one stanza, and females next. My daughter Katey did the reading. We went around in intercession at the end of the office.   We then talked about a great article by Brian McLaren that several people were linking to yesterday -  urlLink Dorothy on Leadership . Amazing article - one of the best on leadership that I've ever read I think. We talked about that and what we saw as desirable in a "leader" - good discussion. Then we ended in the Eucharist - Conor, 8, and Meaghan, 11 distributed the host and cup. It was a good time. Brian, who will soon have a computer, actually stayed till like 10pm! Boy usually is home in bed by then. He's on vacation.

       A few photos over there to let you in on what goes on around here. I haven't posted on here in a while. Our last meeting was a good one. Lester visited with us. We prayed our evening prayer, had a good discussion on the James passage from the Reading on "be a doer of the word and not a hearer only..." - good insights. We had our first "tele-church" meeting as well. Robert and Molly, who've moved to Tulsa, called us and took part in our discussion time via the speakerphone. That was very cool - good to hear from those guys. We miss them. They're still on the blog - they should be on here telling you what's going on with them themselves - we'll work on 'em.  Then at the end, we celebrated the Eucharist. This is two weeks in a row where we've had a literal "spilled blood of Christ" thing happen. One of the kids bumped into the chalice and spilled some of the wine - the blood. It was kind of cool really. The last time it happened before last week, I had just said the words "spilled blood" and it went down - that was good.  What about the discussion: it was a good one - talking alot about the "doing it anyway" thing that Debi mentioned down there. We talked also about the process - hearing > orienting yourself to God > transformation > doing that comes as a matter of that transformation. Good stuff. We're growing as a community I think.

       I started to post this on The Scriptorium, but decided it was better here instead.  I'm catching up on my blog reading after my "hiatus", and got to  urlLink Alan's  entry of October 16th re: transformation in the context of community.  The highlighted phrase  "do it anyway"  reminded me of a song I've not heard in a while by Ceili Rain, entitled (oddly enough)  "Do It Anyway" .  I thought it might be edifying to share it with the rest of you:  You're scared to put your face in the water-- Do it anyway You're scared to color outside the border-- Do it anyway You're scared if you say that they will laugh at you-- Do it anyway You're scared of what I say 'cause it might be true Do it anyway--do it anyway--do it anyway You're scared if you join up you still won't belong-- Do it anyway You're scared that if you leave--you'll be gone-- Do it anyway You're scared to let your friends depend on you-- Do it anyway You might surprise the both of you--so Do it anyway--do it anyway--do it anyway What if you're wrong--and what if you're right What if you walk the walk--and fight the fight You're scared that that next peak is too high for you to climb-- Do it anyway Afraid that they will start to laugh if you start to cry-- Do it anyway You're scared to tell the world what you're doin' here-- Do it anyway You're scared to say "I love you" right in my ear-- Do it anyway--do it anyway--do it anyway

       Had a good talk with my roommate the other day about worship.  We were talking about how much of our own worship experiences have been more sentimentality and less meeting with God.  We do the "thing" whatever that is & expect God to bless us.  It can even protect us from meeting with God - because we all know that an encounter with God can often result in some kind of awareness of our own sinfulness & need for change.  Or at the very least, just doing the routine helps us keep up the good image.  Later that morning, I opened up the next chapter in Thomas Merton's book,  Contemplative Prayer  and read this.  He's talking about meditation, but still a very similar experience.  Pretty cool stuff.   All methods of meditation that are, in effect, merely devices for allaying and assuaging the experience of emptiness and dread are ultimately evasions which can do nothing to help us. Indeed, they may confirm us in delusions and harden us against that fundamental awareness of our real condition, against the truth for which our hearts cry out in desperation.  What we need is not a false peace which enables us to evade the implacable light of judment, but the grace courageously to accept the bitter truth that is revealed to us; to abandon our inertia, our egoism and submit entirely to the demands of the Spirit, praying earnestly for help, and giving ourselves generously to  every effort asked of us by God.     A method of meditation or a form of contemplation that merely produces the illusion of having "arrived somewhere," of having achieved security and preserved one's familiar status by playing a part, will eventually have to be unlearned in dread - or else we will be confirmed in the arrogance, the impenetrable self-assurance of the Pharisee.  We will become impervious to the deepest truths.  We will be closed to all who do not participate in our illusion.  We will live "good lives" that are basically inauthentic, "good" only as long as they permit us to remain established in our respectable and impermeable identities...Such "goodness" is preserved by routine and the habitual avoidance of serious risk - indeed of serious challenge.  In order to avoid apparent evil, this pseudo-goodness will ignore the summons of genuine good.  It will prefer routine duty to courage and creativity.

       Abbey of Gethsemani...Aaah...3 days of silence.  OK it was more like 2 1/4 days because on Monday God knocked all my nice "duckies in formation" all over creation.  I reacted poorly.  Became an ass.  Became?  OK, maybe I just went to new levels of assdome.  Anyway, fumed (pouted?) the whole way to Trappist, KY because things didn't go my way.  Great start for a spiritual retreat. Oh well.   Got there in time to eat, go to Compline & hear Father Matthew's talks. (Yes, Alan, He ROCKS!)  He spoke of living in God's favor and easing into the rhythm of life rather than trying so hard to make things fit.  (Ducks in a row?)  It reminded me of the 1st time going skiing.  At first I hated that stupid ski lift.  But I learned once I relaxed & went with it, rather than trying so hard I was able to jump right on & go with it.  Set the pace for the next couple of days.   The rest of the trip seemed to be all about "the journey".  I started reading Eugene Peterson's   A Long Obedience in the Same Direction .  It's meditations on the Songs of Ascents (Psalms 120-134 the songs sung by Hebrew Pilgrims on their way up to worship in Jerusalem).  Really great stuff that flies in the face of our instant society.   Had this beautiful experience walking up one of the wooded trails to the Hill of Statues.  I walked it very slowly trying to take it all in.  Beauty of the setting.  Statues and signs all along the way.  It's actually like walking through worship installations.  I stopped at each point, took pictures, spent time meditating, writing down my thoughts & prayers.    Through the whole experience God spoke very clearly about living in his grace.  In a very simple way God reminded me over & over about how far reaching His grace is.  The Abbey bell tolls every 15 minutes.  All along the way (I took about 3 hours on this "journey") I could hear the bells.  No matter how far I got I was always within the sound of the bell.  Even at one point when I got off the path, stuck in these thorny plants taller than me I heard the bell. Great image of my life story!   I loved attending the prayer offices.  Yes, I even did the Vigils at 3 am both days. Of course unlike the monks I went back to bed!  God neatly wrapped the whole journey thing together on Wed during the prayer offices.  We chanted Psalms 120-134.   One last thing, ran across a cool little book in the library.   A Celtic Benediction  by J. Philip Newell.  Heard of it, Debi?  I think you'd like it.  It's a book of morning & night prayers based on the 7 days of Creation.  Here's one of the prayers:       For the first showings of the morning light and the emerging outline of the day thanks be to you, O God. For earth's colors drawn forth by the sun its brilliance piercing clouds of darkness and shimmering through leaves and flowing waters thanks be to you. Show to me this day amidst life's dark streaks of wrong and suffering the light that endures every person. Dispel the confusions that cling close to my soul that I may see with eyes washed by your grace that I may see myself and all people with eyes cleansed by the freshness of the new day's light.

       One of us is playing monk this week. I even got to cut Matt's hair before he left for his retreat - I told him it was his novitiate vow. Hopefully he comes back and shares his collected wisdom with us.  He went to the  urlLink Abbey of Gethsemani  near Bardstown, KY. It's the former earthly home of Thomas Merton - only about an hour and a half from here. My friend  urlLink Kevin  said I should put up a Gethsemani retreat primer for those whove never been. Here's the short version:  - if you're a guy try to get in the Monastery wing - much more monk-like  - go to Vigils (night prayer office at 3:00am) at least once while you're there - very cool  - the guest library is a great resource - spend some time in there  - make SURE and go to Father Matthew's talks after Compline (last prayer office at 7:30pm) each night in the side chapel - not to be missed - a great character - lots of wisdom stored up in his 80 something year old frame.  - go walk in the woods  - don't try to do too much agenda wise - rest, pray, eat, rest, take naps, read, pray, etc.  More later...

       Good time last night. We talked about our lives, about the Anam Cara "soul friend" celtic tradition a little - good stuff. We prayed together an abbreviated Evening Office from the Liturgy of the Hours - we start in a time of silence - one Psalm, the antiphons, the Gloria, the NT reading - we listen as we read and pray - then we talk about what we heard. We've done this a few times now and the conversations always end up very good.   Although it's very  liturgical  in one way, it ends up very  organic  as a way to meet. The Evening Office is just there, for that day. I didn't pick it. We pray that - we listen to that, to hear what God is saying - we talk about it. It's very cool. I think this is turning into the default way for us to gather when something else isn't planned. I think it's a good thing. It's regular. It's steady. It's intentionally focused on God and what He says to us in His Word. It listens to His Spirit. It doesn't depend on the charisma of a man - of any of us.  Last week was my birthday. We met (it was our monthly potluck - we did Brian's b-day like this too) and had a little "thing." They gave me.... a bell. Yes, a big black iron bell worthy of a monastery church tower (not quite that big) - an awesome gift. I can't wait to get it set up so I can ring it. I can see that ringing thing happening on a regular basis. You might even be able to hear it if you try hard enough...

       Well, I guess I couldn't handle it. I'm at my parents' house for Thanksgiving - we're just sitting around - so I have to blog. Having more than one place to blog is weird too. Where do I say what I want to say? Well, "my" blog is not a blogger blog. I update it manually and I don't have the software here so I'm hangin at the Vine tonight. I guess this will work for what I've been thinking about today. It even sort of relates to Robert's blog down there (Live! from Tulsa!!).  I was at work today. We have a laid back atmosphere there - it's very cool. Today at one point we were sitting around looking at old photos of each other, laughing, etc. One of my coworkers happened to ask me about my Catholic background. She had been raised in the Catholic Church - she and her husband both - but her experience was not good apparently. She did not connect with faith in Jesus through that vehicle. They were "saved" later, through someone sharing with them in a more "moment of salvation by praying a prayer of reception" kind of deal. I informed her I wasn't raised Catholic - I became Catholic "on my own" - I became a Christian through that vehicle when I was 13. I was raised "unchurched."  I think this took her aback. She didn't quite know what to think about that. She and one other person said - "that's amazing" - meaning it was amazing that I had "accepted Christ" and had actually become a Christian through the Catholic Church. Interesting. Not that I haven't heard things like that before. She wanted to know more about that story - so I told her. It was funny. I think at one point she began being "concerned" about me (in a polite way) that perhaps I wasn't a real Christian. Note - I've just put that thought in her head. I'm not saying this "against" her at all. I'm just sharing a story to make a point. She asked me if the Priest in the catechism had actually shared with me the Gospel story, forgiveness of sins, etc. I said, "of course - it's all right there in the catechism - who Jesus was/is, why He came and died, the whole picture of the core of our common Christian faith." Something like that anyway. I mentioned that no one may have said to me "do you accept Jesus as your personal Lord and Savior?" but that the whole conversation, the catechetical presentation was an offer - an offer laid out to be accepted.  I think she was fine. This interaction just brought that issue to the forefront. Am I not "saved" because I didn't pray this "sinner's prayer" with someone who "shared with me" a certain version of the gospel story??? Maybe you think I'm not either. Well, hmmm. Obviously I think you're wrong. I don't think the revivalist argument holds water. If I have a deep faith and trust in Jesus, in the Father and the Holy Spirit and I live this faith daily am I not "in Him?" I think I am. Not because I do things, but because of the faith that was spawned by His Grace - that has made me alive. Now, I'm not actively within the Roman Catholic Church at this time. That is not because I think it to be illegitimate or "not Christian." That's ignorance! I didn't "get saved" and leave what I thought to be Babylon. Again, ignorance. I have simply moved with what I thought God was leading me to do along the way. That's not the point though.  What about this? Do we have to have a particular moment in time to harken back to in order to be considered truly Christian? Or can our faith grow and develop and become mature and we just ARE a Christian and we might not really "know" when the Holy Spirit took up residence in us??? I strongly think the  latter most option to be the case. We may well have a "moment," but I would never accept that it's necessary. This community - Vine & Branches - is not one where you'll see emotionally charged "altar calls" or even offers to pray a sinner's prayer, ever. We are in Him. We are walking this transformational journey. We walk this journey of faith in the world, in and among those who aren't walking it. We live it openly and are ready to "offer" it to others if they are open. Then, perhaps, they will come along side us and begin walking in the same direction and find the wonderful surprise of faith growing in their hearts eventually. That is what we pray. That is our evangelism.

       Well, here's my long awaited blog.  Alan is going to hate me because it is going to be really short (as I am blogging at work during my last 5 minutes of the workday).  I might just rant a little.  What ever happened to evangelism?  When people think of evangelism, I think they think of Robert Tilton (see pastorgas.com for lots of fun, by the way) or one of those guys that went down in the 80's for fraud.  In my job, I get to talk to pastors non-stop, pretty much all day long.  One thing I've noticed: evangelism is on the back burner... I know that from what they tell me they spend on it usually and what outreaches they do as a church.  It drives me crazy that we keep the truth of Christ shut up in a building!  We keep the "salt" in the shaker, the candle under a bushel, and try to hide what God intended to be "a city sitting on a hill."  What ever happened to personally sharing our faith in respectful ways with other people?  What ever happened to doing something with the gospel?  The scary thing is I don't know what happened to it in my own life either.  The cares of this world get to us all, and I'm no exception from the rule.  Sometimes I wonder if we really believe this stuff.  How would I live if I really bought it?  How would you live?  Robert

       I've got a little simple coffee house church thang with me and my friend Steve, and sometimes his wife Joan - meets on Monday nights. We had a very good time this last Monday talking about a Thomas Merton quote - it's pretty thick - so thick we'll be talking more about it next week. I look forward to it. During the conversation we got into the fact that spiritual formation takes a loooong time - that the whole quick-fix mentality when it comes to this is right out the window. We talked about how we need to work things out when we get hold of new truths or whatever. We can't just say "OK, done with that one, on to the next" - it may take us years to really wrestle out what we've gotten hold of. So we're wrestling. Here's the quote...   Love in fact is the spiritual life, and without it all the other exercises of the spirit, however lofty, are emptied of content and become mere illusions. The more lofty they are, the more dangerous the illusion.  Love, of course, means something much more than mere sentiment, much more than token favors and perfunctory almsdeeds. Love means an interior and spiritual identification with one's brother, so that he is not regarded as an "object" to "which" one "does good." The fact is that good done to another as to an object is of little or no spiritual value.  Love takes one's neighbor as one's other self, and loves him with all the immense humility and discretion and reserve and reverence, without which no one can presume to enter into the sanctuary of another's subjectivity. From such love all authoritarian brutality, all exploitation, domineering and condescension must necessarily be absent.   Good stuff big Tom - chew on that stuff for about 10 years.

       Here's the "Christian quotation of the day" from  urlLink CQOD :  "Let him who cannot be alone beware of community.  He will only do harm to himself and to the community.  Alone you stood before God when He called you; alone you had to answer that call; alone you had to struggle and pray; and alone you will die and give an account to God.  You cannot escape yourself; for God has singled you out.  If you refuse to be alone, you are rejecting Christ's call to you, and you can have no part in  the community of those who are called....  Let him who is not in community beware of being alone.  Into the community you were called -- the call was not meant for you alone; in the community of the called you bear your cross, you struggle, you pray.  You are not alone even in death, and on the Last Day you will be only one of the great congregation of Jesus Christ.  If you scorn the fellowship of the brethren, you reject the call of Jesus Christ." ---Dietrich Bonhoeffer (1906-1945), Life Together  Just a little something to stir up discussion.

       Wow, it's been over a month since I posted in here! I actually haven't had a whole lot to say that fits this context lately, so better to say nothing than ramble.....and so the rambling begins. Those of you who have checked in at  urlLink The Scriptorium  know that I am currently reading  The Springs of Contemplation , a Thomas Merton book. I've been sharing quotes there from time to time, and something I read the other night sparked a thought process I thought would be good for here. Here's the quote:  "The desert life was a life of non-conformity....The desert people were  protesting  against the union of Church and empire under Constantine. When the church became a respectable establishment, people started going into the desert....they simply wanted to get out because they thought things weren't authentic anymore....Monks were the great supporters of orthodoxy. What we have to look out for is the fact of living in a trapped society. This society blocks  qualitative  change while it foments  quantitative  change."  The thought occurred to me that Merton was saying that the desert fathers were the first protestants, as in "protest-ants". They protested against the Church becoming "respectable" and therefore somehow not authentic. It got taken over by the "establishment" and turned into something that bore little resemblance to its beginnings. In the same manner, we in the "emerging church" are becoming the protestants of Protestantism, if you will. The "protest-ants" are always the ones who are trying to steer the Church (universal) back onto the path set forth in the New Testament. The desert fathers, Martin Luther, Asuza, and now us--we all wanted the same thing--to try and follow the roadmap left for us in best way we know how. I happen to think that the house church "movement" is the way to best accomplish that given the society we have now. We simply must continue to seek God and make sure that we don't fall into the trap of thinking that now we have it all figured out and no more "tweaks" will ever be necessary. God never changes, but people do, so our half of the relationship will always be changing as we hopefully grow ever closer to the beings He created us to be in the first place.

       I'm really just posting here because everytime I go to this site I see nothing...I hear crickets chirping.  Quiet.  Quiet.  Peaceful quiet. Oh well.  Partyin' with the Creeches tonight.  Looking forward to that.  Last Wed night the community got together for the usual fare.  We hadn't met for a couple of weeks because of Thanksgiving & then bad weather.  Good to be back at the Wed night thang.   Yeah, I like these guys.  Good people to hang out with.

       Back home. Our community met last night and I talked a while about some of the things I experienced at the Allelon gathering. First we prayed the Evening Prayer together and celebrated the Eucharist. Then I yapped and we talked about what went on out there in Idaho and how that is affecting Vine & Branches - what it means for us, etc. Like I said before, I feel like I, we, are a part of a new family. That's a good thing. I think God has drawn us into these relationships. We had a good time talking about all that.  Also, I had gone out there with something floating around in me, an idea about vbcc, something I was praying and thinking about. I had shared it with some others and wanted to wait till I got back from Boise to talk to the community here about it. So I did. Looks like very soon, probably in March, we're going to begin hosting a monthly gathering in a public place. This is a step for us. It took me a while to feel it out and see if this was a legitimate step to take. I think it is. As we talked about it last night, it seemed we all felt comfortable about it - even somewhat excited.  Why? Well - 3 reasons really:  It will be another expression of our community's life and worship - us being us in this other context; It will be us being us "out there" as a missional step, creating another arena where friends can stand beside us to see who we are, some of who God is, and perhaps join with us in focusing on Him; Finally, and not so insignificantly, it will not merely be about Vine & Branches Christian Community, but about the Body of Christ in Lexington. We want to "sponsor" this monthly gathering and invite people who are parts of other bodies to participate with us. So, our friends will be there, with no pressure to become a part of "our little club." We will all be cultivating a focus on God together and building each other up. Hopefully even friends from other networks in other cities close by will also join us from time to time.  Think free-form monastic liturgy - worship installations - Eucharist - interactive teaching - music for worship and not performance - singing the Psalms - hanging out and touching base with old friends and perhaps making some new ones. As cool as this is going to be, it will, by no means, become the "main thing" of our community. Our primary expression of community life will continue to be, as it has always been, the small, intimate communities that meet in homes (or other places if need be). We just felt it was time to express ourselves as a faith community in this way. I hope some of you reading this who may be close can come hang out with us sometime. I'll keep you posted on when, where, and all that. That's it for now. I just wanted to put that little update out there. Pax Vobiscum!

       Heeeyyyy!! Sorry it took me so long to get back. I just now got to a computer. I'm in Eric Keck's office here - Eric is a trip - very cool guy. If you're visiting on a Thurday night you'll want to check into his garage for poker and beer - fuuunnn. We'ver rounded things up for the weekend now. Some folks are hanging around waiting to go eat. It has been a very good time. Allelon will be - is - significant. This is a new friendship - a family - bearing one another's burdens. It's a good thing. God has done this thing as a favor to many of us - and as a favor to His growing Kingdom on earth. More details later. I gotta go eat. Jason Evans is standing behind me now causing trouble - that boy needs help! I'm very much looking forward to seeing my family tomorrow. God's Grace be with you!

       Sitting here in Boise, Idaho in an internet cafe with all these weird guys standing behind me watching me write this - Kevin Rains, Malcolm Hawker, Mike Bishop, T. Freeman - some known to some of you. Very cool bunch of guys. We thought we'd come look around downtown Boise for a little while before going back to eat with some other folks in Eagle. It was a good flight here - not very eventful - thank God. It is 45 degrees f. here in Boise - amazingly warmer than at home. I look foward to the happenings to come tonight, tomorrow and the next few days. I'm going to let some of these other guys blog and get off here now. We'll all keep you informed. Thanks for praying for me vbcc! I'll see you next week.

       Last night we had a very cool meeting. We got together a little early, due to the fact that we watched "The Last Temptation of Christ", and it's a fairly long movie. We, of course, ate first, prayed for  urlLink Alan  and his flight and trip to Idaho for Allelon. Then we settled in to watch the movie. It was, I must admit, pretty interesting. The best I can figure, the concept of the book from which the movie sprang was drawn from the passage where Jesus was tempted in the desert after His baptism. At the end of that passage (see Luke 4:13), it says that Satan "left Him until an opportune time." Apparently the author interpreted the time of Jesus hanging on the cross, waiting to die, as an "opportune time." It's a plausible story, for the most part, but there were some areas that I thought were rather unlikely, such as the beginning of the film where Jesus is portrayed as somewhat of a pansy, for lack of a better word, doubting His calling as the Messiah and being apparently unable to tell for certain if the "voice" He heard was God or Satan. Overall, it was a pretty good movie and somewhat undeserving of the bad rap it has garnered over the years. By the time the movie was over, it had snowed quite a bit, so Brian, reverting back to his "head usher" days, went out and swept off all of our cars. What a nice boy he can be sometimes! :^) Oh, yeah,  urlLink Liz  made the most wonderful tiramisu, and gave us leftovers to take home! Yum-yum!!

       Nobody's posted here in a while. I guess we're all too busy posting in our own blogs. Here's where you can read what's going on in our individual heads:  urlLink Alan ,  urlLink Liz ,  urlLink Debi , and our latest vbcc blogger,  urlLink Matt .   We've all seen LOTR The Two Towers lately and have some interesting thoughts on the spiritual parallels we've seen. You don't have to push these by the way. Tolkien was a Christian ans put them in there on purpose. Of course there will always be those things that speak to us as particular people on a journey, or community.  Here is a big snip from my blog (post of Dec. 24) concerning this community, the vision, etc. It's probably just as relevant here - not that anybody reads this thing.   The other thing about having this vision is that it is always being judged by everyone around you. They don't even have to say anything - you know. "How's your 'church' going?" "How's it going with your 'thing'?" Now, what does all that mean? I can never straightly answer that question because everyone who asks it has something different in mind when they ask it. Well, not really. About 90% of them have one thing in mind - "How many people do you have now?" And when you answer whatever you answer - when I answer whatever I answer, it's me we're talking about here - you get a range of looks and comments. I don't know what to do with that. I'm sort of tired of it. Maybe that sounds bad but it's just a fact. I just want to be what we are - to do what we're supposed to do - and not answer a bunch of questions about it.  I guess part of it is that I quite do not like feeling like a dork in front of people. I don't like not having the answer that would make me look good in the eyes of the asker. And I usually don't - so that makes for some uncomfortable sessions. I know, I know, I need to get over it and just answer what I answer. Yeah, I agree to a certain extent. I also think that people who go around asking these questions need to stop being ignorant - stop being so single-minded as concerns what the answers mean - what they should be. Of course that's not going to happen any time soon. So, I'll just have to suck it up and keep giving overly complicated apologetic answers. Maybe that's education. And as I go along maybe I'll get less insecure about the answers as well.

       Here's a quote from Gordon Cosby of Church of the Savior in Washington, DC. I am officially adopting this quote for our community and Gordon Cosby can come whoop me if he wants to - here we go...     We will commit ourselves to an intensive love effort with a few people. We will be committed to smallness.  Large numbers tend almost inevitably toward depersonalization and institutionalism, toward a lessening of commitment. So we resist the temptation of numbers and the power that comes through numbers.   This is where we are now. We have stopped looking for numbers. We have come to realize that while we are called to be missional, to "be Christ" to the world around us and to invite, by our lives, people into Christ with us, we are about the building this small community of people into truly transformed people. This small transformed community, and others that will spring from it, will be signs to the world.  Oh, and we're having our first monthly public gathering, the one I was talking about before, on  Saturday, March 1st, at 5:00pm at the Church of The Apostles - 1321 Trent Blvd. in Lexington.    We want to thank our good friends at Apostles for their generosity and honor them for showing a spirit of unity in the Body of Christ. Thanks guys! Hopefull we'll see some of you there to hang out with us.

       Wow! It has been a long time since I have written here.    Once again Matt did an awesome job of facilitating the meeting.  We talked about self worth and what it meant to us.  Great stuff.  We took a lot of rabbit trails, but in all we talked for a long time.  It is interesting when someone puts a question to you that you don't think about very often.  You just seem to feel good or bad and don't consider where it is coming from.    Ephesians 1:11-14 in "The Message" says some good stuff.  You all should read it.

       We had a good meeting last night as  urlLink Liz  said.  urlLink Matt  started his month of facilitating with a discussion on Isaiah 58 - the true fast - with a twist. We talked not so much about the poor and opressed and downtrodden that we might go to downtown and then leave, but about those who may be "opressed" and "poor" in some way who are in our lives, who are among us all the time. This, we discussed, could be each other at times. It could be anyone we work with who is not desirable or unloveable. It was good. We prayed and listened for a while - prayed for each other - ended up praying for Matt - some encouraging things came out. And we talked about the monthly gathering that we're going to do. Soon - March 1st - that's a Saturday night. We don't know where yet but have some good ideas. I'll let you know. We're excited but not feeling pressure - this is good.

       I intended to put this up last week but never got to it. This is the little teaching I did at our first monthly Gathering - taught for about 10 minutes or so and then we openned up for comments - that wendt very well - some good things were brought out.   vbcc monthly gathering ::: teaching for march 1, 2003    We possess the prophetic message as something altogether reliable. Keep your attention closely fixed on it, as you would on a lamp shining in a dark place until the first streaks of dawn appear and the morning star rises in your hearts. First you must understand this: there is no prophecy contained in Scripture which is a personal interpretation. Prophecy has never been put forward by man’s willing it. It is rather that men impelled by the Holy Spirit have spoken under God’s influence. —2 Peter 1:19-21    We are the prophetic message of God to this world.  The source of this “prophecy” is God, not us. We must  keep our attention closely fixed  on that source and live in a way that is constantly aware of His presence and of how that presence interacts with and effects our lives – how it transforms us. It is a matter of this course of life, this prophetic life, closely fixed on the source, that we become  shining lamps in a dark place.   As the  streaks of dawn appear  and the  star arises in our own hearts,  it then rises in the world around us. We are the dawning of the Kingdom of God on earth, along with Christ – in Him.  We must understand, though, that “I” am not the prophecy. “I,” myself alone, am not the prophetic message to the world. Vine & Branches is not the whole light in the dark place – neither is Church of the Apostles, or Vineyard Central, or Ordinary Community. Being here together tonight we are living that prophetic message. So, it’s not about our personal thing. We are parts of a whole.  And this is all ultimately about God breaking in – into our lives, into our world, influencing us by the Holy Spirit. Ultimately, we should be people filled with and impelled by the Holy Spirit – a prophecy to the world spoken under God’s influence.

       You knew it was going to happen - digital camera > tons of pictures > here are some from our last night's Ash Wednesday meeting.          > the living room - eucharist set up on the bench in front of the fireplace - after we sang, we individually went to kneel and receive communion, then got up to receive ashes on our heads with the encouragement: "remember, you are not God, and you can do nothing without Him." > the food - always the food - humous, grapes, carrots, pita bread - woo hoo! > the matt - his big fat greek birthday! he got this cool icon and the dvd of bfgw.      > saint brian with his ashy head - "remember, he is not God" > another view of the eucharistic set-up - an icon of Jesus the teacher at top.  That's it for the photos. We chanted the psalm of evening prayer for Ash Wednesday, had a good discussion about balance and sacrifice - and about life's struggles and how they are a part of "life" and our notions of how we handle them when they come. Then we worshiped with a song and went into the eucharist and to ashes. It was a good time.

       Last evening we had our first official "thing", or larger group gathering. Friends came in from all over, from Nicholasville to Cincinnati. It was great meeting new folks, like  urlLink Rachel , and good to see other friends again, like  urlLink Kyle  and the  urlLink Rainses . We had a really good time of hanging out with coffee and cookies and such, then got into some organized focusing on Jesus through the daily office. We sang (or chanted) the Psalm, which was very cool and a little foreign to some (probably most) of the participants. Then Alan spoke a little about the Scripture reading, and we had a time of open discussion of what was said. The participatory thing is very cool. Then we moved into a time of worship through song and communion. Afterward, of course we hung out and "fellowshipped" some more, as we used to say, then a bunch of us went to Bearno's pizza for the obligatory after-"thing" meal. It was just so great hanging out with a large bunch of folks with similar mindsets. I'm looking forward to doing this each month. Oh, yeah, look for lots of photos, probably both here and at  urlLink Alan's site --he had his new "toy" (digital camera) in use last night.

        Last night was out second monthly Gathering. It was a small group but a very good time. The standard vbcc crowd and the incubating seed of St. Patrick's Church. We did the catacomb candles in the sand station - 3 in the center (trinity) and each person lights their candle from that one and sticks it in the sand. There's a photo down there. We chanted the short evening office > reading > I did a short teaching on dying, rising, being centered on God from 1 Peter (the notes to that are below the photos). We had a great discussion surrounding that > very good time of singing in worship - Pete, Matt, and Debi did a wonderful job of leading that time.                     vbcc gathering ::: teaching ::: april 5, 2003     “Realize that you were delivered from the futile way of life your fathers handed on to you, not by any diminishable sum of silver or gold, but by Christ's blood beyond all price: the blood of a spotless, unblemished lamb chosen before the world's foundation and revealed for your sake in these last days. It is through him that you are believers in God, the God who raised him from the dead and gave him glory. Your faith and hope, then, are centered in God." —1 Ptr. 1:18-21     "Realize that you were delivered from the futile way of life your fathers handed on to you."    Lent  — The season of crucifixion - of dying in order to be reborn - in order to share in the resurrection. What is the point? Here's one thing. Many of us did not have a “way of life" handed down to us that was a very positive thing. Possibly all that was given us was abuse and negativity - not the best legacy. Well, you don't have to live in that futile and worthless way! Sometimes we just take what's handed to us. We don't see it as optional, we just let life happen to us and roll with it. This is not necessary. Sometimes we need to roll against it!   Realization  — Getting something solidly lodged in your mind as real and true.  This is what we must do with the fact that we have been delivered from these futile ways that were handed down to us. We must do the “work" that belongs to that realization - getting it into ourselves.   Actualization  — What's real in our minds actually becoming real in our lives - out here!  How can we be so confident that it's true? Because it wasn't like somebody paid money for it - not some earthly and temporary guarantee. It was bought with the ultimate sacrifice. Through Jesus - Man & God - laying Himself down totally for us - opening His Life to us so that we could have it! Not just look and say “there's Jesus the God-Man - look how cool He was." No. So that we could look and be transformed into what we're looking at - and be cool too!  It's not ourselves, though, that will get us there. We don't even get started without Him.   "It is through Him that you are believers in God... your faith and hope, then, are centered in God."    Centered in God  —  “but you don't understand - I have this happening to me and that happening to me."  OK, well, join the club. Things suck sometimes - sometimes really bad. But where is our faith and hope centered? Where is it focused? We've got to look on through the crap and see Him. We have to allow Him to be our center no matter what.   Centered in God  — Here's that term again. I love this phrase.  We have to be doing the work that belongs to making Him the center.  He won't be the ACTUAL center if all we look at is this and that around us. There must be a center thread that goes through all of life - a center thread that is there even in the middle of a world of crap. So, let's take this opportunity to refocus - to realign the center - to die and be reborn - to give ourselves up and dive into the Life of the Resurrection.

       Wow. It's been almost 2 months since we've updated here. That's not good. Anyway, I want to try to remedy that with some quotes that I thought were worthy of discussion. I'm on the  urlLink Christian Quote of the Day  email list, and for the past week or so, the "theme" has been quotes about church unity. I thought I'd share some of the better ones (or rather, the ones I thought most worthy of discussion). So, talk amongst yourselves!  The attentive reader will notice two items about the New Testament, as he comes to the end of it. For one thing, there is no book of church order, laying down a code of rules for the worship and organization of the communities: [there is] no book corresponding to the Book of Leviticus. The other thing is that the writings are all meant for communities, not for individuals: they reflect and presuppose the life of a society or fellowship. Even the private notes of Paul to Philemon and of the presbyter John to Gaius are addressed to these individuals as members of the church; and Luke's two volumes are intended primarily--but only primarily--for the Christian education of his friend and patron Theophilus. ~James Moffatt (1870-1944) **************************************** It is true that the New Testament uses the term ekklesia for the spiritual reality of the body of Christ and also for the assembly, in which the genuineness of the spiritual reality of every individual professing member cannot be known. To this extent, the exact membership of any individual church and the universal church at large cannot be known and is thereby invisible.  But even this invisible membership is very visible in the reality of life. As for membership in an invisible church without fellowship with any local assembly, this concept is never contemplated in the New Testament. The universal church was the universal fellowship of believers who met visibly in local assemblies. ~Robert L. Saucy, The Church in God's Program **************************************** While the local church is not the total body of Christ, it must be seen to be [that body's] particular expression in its worship, ministry, and mission. It has authority to preach the gospel and administer the sacraments, but does not possess that authority in isolation, only as part of the total catholic Church. The authority of the local church can never, therefore, be absolute or autonomous, for, if it [asserts such authority], it denies that it is a part of the larger body and confuses the Church of God with its particular expression in the local church. It therefore requires a structure which allows it to act with the authority of the Church of God--because it must be Christ to its local community--while, at the same time, demonstrating that it possesses such authority only because it is part of the total Church of God, whose authority is derived from its organic relationship with Christ, its Head. ~Ian P. M. Cundy, "The Church as Community"  Again, these quotes are shared to spark discussion, whether in agreement or disagreement.

       OK, I mentioned the advisory council of Vine & Branches below. I thought you might want to know who that is. I wanted to have a few people who are close to me, whom I respect a great deal, and who would understand what I was going planting this funky church. These guys are seriously top of the heap people. They are guys I can go to and whine and cry to and get advice from, as well as just good ole support. I appreciate them very much.   They are as follows in alphabetical order:     urlLink  Peter Matthews   - a wonderful Anglican lad who has become a great friend. He is now in the process of planting a new missional faith community in the Anglican tradition called St. Patrick's here in Lexington. They already have a blog -  urlLink check it out .    urlLink  Dave Nixon   - a wise "old" monk. Dave is the Abbot of one of Vineyard Central's Community Houses. I like to call it the Abbey of Our Lady of Norwood. He, along with some others, got VC started a few years back. I've grown to love and respect Dave a great deal.   urlLink  Kevin Rains   - a great man. Dude, he even looks like me! God has knit Kevin and I together in a special way over the last two years and I love and respect him greatly. He's a pastor and spiritual director to those in St. Elizabeth's house church and the Vineyard Central network.   urlLink  Steve Thompson   - Another one of these friendships that is a gift from God. Steve is a pastor in Michigan and is getting ready to start a new journey in life helping to plant a new church there.   This is a rich treasure trove of friendship, wisdom, and support. I am grateful that they have agreed to be a part of what God is doing through Vine & Branches here in Lexington and beyond. I am nothing but honored to lay them before you. I hope it shows how absolutely cool we are to have such a great host of advisors.

I'm thinking about inviting the board members (advisory council of vine & branches) to join this blog team. That might be interesting - to hear what those guys who are close but "outside" this community are thinking and saying. Might be a good thing. We shall see.

       People often ask me, "how's your church going?" Interesting question to try to answer given the nature of our "church." See, I have to put it in quotation marks it's so funky. Anyway, I think the answer these days is, "it's going fairly well." I really think it is. I don't mean by that that we are "growing" and that we now have 50 people. We may never have 50 people in this community. I mean I think we are learning what it means to be a community of people on this journey together for the long haul. I mean we are getting on each others' nerves - that's a community thang. I mean we are dealing with it and moving on and recognizing how God is forming us through one another. It's really good stuff. It's too bad this kind of "growth" and "success" doesn't show up on many people's radar screen. So, we keep on walking down the path together. I'm sure we'll pick up a few stragglers along the way, but we keep walking, helping each other to stay focused.

                      Happy Pentecost!   50 days after Passover,    Harvest in the Jewish calendar. For us, the celebration of the fulfillment of    a promise - the coming of the Holy Spirit to us. Jesus promised his friends    that when he left, he would not leave us abandoned - that he would send us another    helper. He was sending us His own life - the same life that He had walking around    here - the Spirit of God to dwell in us. That's all, just a real metaphysical    connection to the eternal substructure of the universe, to God, the eternal    one - that's all!!! If we receive this gift He has given us, we open ourselves    to something HUGE - much bigger than a set of beliefs or even a commitment to    a bunch of cool people. Those things factor in but they are not the core - they    eminate from the core of spiritual union with God through the indwelling Spirit.    Amazing. Amazing that we would think of this as anything other than mind-blowingly    gigantic in its significance to us and to the world.                  We had a great celebration with our own small community and several friends    and freinds of friends. That milling around up there is what we like to call    the &quot;sacrament of fellowship.&quot; It IS a part of the &quot;service.&quot;    That's a little off-culture to many, and we have to keep re-brainwashing ourselves    to know that as soon as people get there to come together in one place, things    have started - it's happening.    The Antiphon for our chanted Evening Prayer last night said this:  On the    day of Pentecost they had all gathered together in one place, alleluia.     This is the context in which the promise was fulfilled - in the context of community    - of US, gathered together in one place.That's what   Pentecost      is:  Us, gathered together in one place for this reason - to receive eternal    life - to open ourselves to the life of God to come dwell in us and make us    alive like Jesus.  It is the life of eternity breaking into the world, doing    the work of creation, of recreation in us, through us, around us.             We had fun in community. Great fellowship; great worship; great conversation.    I think we were built up to go out and be the people that God has created us    to be - that He is continually recreating us to be.

        Gathering at  urlLink Apostles  this Saturday - the 7th - at 5pm  - if you're able, come hang with us. Like I've said before, it's not about "joining our church" but about getting together as the wider body of Christ in the area, or if you're just curious about what we do or who we are as Vine & Branches, come too. We're going to try and stick with this first Saturday of the month thing for this meeting. So, if you can't make it this time, same time next month.  Pax vobiscum.

        urlLink Matt  posted this on his blog - from the Northumbria Community in England. I post it as a poem and a prayer for the Community of Vine & Branches.    If you want your dream to be, build it slow and surely. Small beginnings, greater ends. Heartfelt work grows purely. If you want to live life free, take your time, go slowly. Do few things, but do them well: simple joys are holy. Day by day, stone by stone, build your secret slowly. Day by day, you'll grow too; you'll know heaven's glory!

       Well, it's Sunday morning and it's raining. Nice to sit in the silence and listen to it. We just had our 6th, yes 6th monthly "Gathering" last night. Great time of hanging out and getting to know people. Meet Brian and Heather Sherwood from NKy. Cool couple. Looking forward to spending more time with them. Great time of conversation and pizza at Bearno's. I don't know about the rest of you but I wouldn't mind a change of scenery for our meal after next month's  gathering. I don't know what else to call it. I don't want to say service or meeting.  Anyway, I've just been thinking the last couple of days about my time in the institution. You know, the place were it's all focused on the man in charge and the "show" were you can be impressed by his "spiritual gifts" on display and the amount of material goods he has acquired. Anybody been to that one? It's playing ever Sunday morning at a few venues across this land. I used to be apart of that. Every Sunday morning was like preparing for a rock show and I was one of the roadies, in fact, I was the head roadie. make sure the sound and the lighting are right, fill the seats with the people, push them to the front, provide security so nobody could get close to the "star." Have to stay insulated from the common "fan" so the annointing won't leave. Because you know, when you come into contact with imperfect people the Grace of God will flee. Funny what I use to think and believe what "church" was all about. It was like working a job.  My former pastor was and is,as far as I know, a good and decent man. I learned a lot and grew up in my spiritual walk with him. I admired him and some of his qualities, I never wanted to be like him but the longer I am removed from "churchworld" I can now see that his type of attitude is destructive in the church community. I just can't fathom the concept, and never have, that the sheperd shouldn't be close his flock. The whole time I was attending Rhema that was what was taught. "Don't get involved or too close to your sheep." Something inside of me was screaming "NO,NO,NO." I remember a time when I wanted to schedule a meeting with the pastor, the top dog. So many level's of red tape. I had to be pre-qualfied to see if I was "worthy" of the pastor's time. Of course, I never was. Of the three years that I attended Rhema Church I never had one conversation with anyone on pastoral staff. Hello! Does this sound normal to anybody else?  That's enough for now. I'll rant some more at a later date.  We are not the only community in town but come check us out. We are not trying to steal you from any other church. The Body of Christ should know each other, so come hang with us.  Brian

       I got this in my email this morning, from the  urlLink CQOD :   "In conversion you are not attached primarily to an order, nor to an institution, nor a movement, nor a set of beliefs, nor a code of action--you are attached primarily to a Person, and secondarily to these other things...You are not called to get to heaven, to do good, or to be good--you are called to belong to Jesus Christ. The doing good, the being good, and the getting to heaven, are the by-products of that belonging. The center of conversion is the belonging of a person to a Person."  ~E.

       I know that mostly what I do here is post quotes, but this one is as good as the last, so I must share it with everyone. This also comes via  urlLink CQOD :   "Suppose Christianity is not a religion but a way of life, a falling in love with God, and, through Him, a falling in love with our fellows. Of course, such a way is hard and costly, but it is also joyous and rewarding even in the here-and-now. People who follow that Way know beyond all possible argument that they are in harmony with the purpose of God, that Christ is with them and in them as they set about His work in our disordered world. If anyone thinks this is perilous and revolutionary teaching, so much the better. That is exactly what they thought of the teaching of Jesus Christ. The light He brought to bear upon human affairs is almost unbearably brilliant: but it is the light of Truth, and in that light human problems can be solved."  ~J. B. Phillips (1906-1982),  When God Was Man  [1954]  Sounds a lot like some people I know talking...

       Thought I'd stick this up here.   Just in case anyone has bothered to drop by.  It's a prayer from Thomas Merton's  Thoughts In Solitude .   Let this be my only consolation, that wherever I am You, my Lord, are loved and praised.  The trees indeed love you without knowing you.  The tiger lilies and corn flowers are there, proclaiming that they love you, without being aware of your presence.  The beautiful dark clouds ride slowly across the sky musing on you like children who do not know what they are dreaming of, as they play.  But in the midst of them all, I know you, and I know of your presence.  In them and in me I know of the love which they do not know, and, what is greater, I am abashed by the presence of your love in me.  O kind and terrible love, which you have given me, and which could never be in my heart if you did not love me!  For in the midst of these beings which have never offended you, I am loved by you, and it would seem most of all as one who has offended you.  I am seen by you under the sky, and my offenses have been forgotten by you - but I have not forgotten them.  Only one thing I ask:  that the memory of them should not make me afraid to receive into my heart the gift of Love - which you have placed in me.  I will receive it because I am unworthy.  In doing so I will only love you all the more, and give your mercy greater glory.  Remembering that I have been a sinner, I will love you in spite of what I have been, knowing that my love is precious because it comes from your own Son, but precious even more because it makes me your son.

       I'll lay down the first of my latest Merton gleanings on you guys on the Vine. Amazing how these words continue to echo down through the years, calling us to pay attention, to wake up and understand. This is seriously good, practical stuff.   The spiritual life is first of all a  life . It is not merely something to be known and studied, it is to be lived. Like all life, it grows sick and dies when it is uprooted from its proper element. Grace is engrafted on our nature and the whole man is sanctified by the presence and action of the Holy Spirit. The spiritual life is not, therefore, a life entirely uprooted from man's human conditions and transplanted into the realm of the angels. We live as spiritual men when we live as men seeking God. If we are to become spiritual, we must remain men. And if there were not evidence of this everywhere in theology, the Mystery of the Incarnation itself would be ample proof of it. Why did Christ become Man if not to save men by uniting them mystically with God through His own Sacred Humanity? Jesus lived the ordinary life of the men of His time, in order to sanctify the ordinary lives of men of all time. If we want to be spiritual, then, let us first of all live our lives. Let us not fear the responsibilities and the inevitable distractions of the work appointed for us by the will of God. Let us embrace reality and thus find ourselves immersed in the life-giving will and wisdom of God which surrounds us everywhere.   -Thomas Merton; Thoughts in Solitude, chapter 10

       I thought I would put those quotes from John of the Cross on here just to have them here for us. Nobody seems to have paid much attention to them on my blog. I think it was too much. Anyway, there are always times when we feel like goofs - like we aren't spiritually mature at all. Sometimes it's because we've done something stupid or maybe it's because we don't feel anything going on inside us - we don't feel like we're connected to God. Real spiritual maturity is mostly having a realization of what really is. I mean to say, to be truly spiritually mature is to have a good grasp on reality - real reality. OK, here we go - Spanish mystics rock!   ...many of these, lured by the sweetness and pleasure which they find in such exercises, strive more after spiritual sweetness than after spiritual purity and discretion... the gluttony which they now have makes them continually go to extremes.  These persons, in communicating, strive with every nerve to obtain some kind of sensible sweetness and pleasure, instead of humbly doing reverence and giving praise within themselves to God. ...when they have received no pleasure or sweetness in the senses, they think that they have accomplished nothing at all.  These persons have the same defect as regards the practice of prayer, for they think that all the business of prayer consists in experiencing sensible pleasure and devotion and they strive to obtain this by great effort, wearying and fatiguing their faculties and their heads; and when they have not found this pleasure they become greatly discouraged, thinking that they have accomplished nothing.  ...They are, in fact, as we have said, like children, who are not influenced by reason, and who act, not from rational motives, but from inclination. Such persons expend all their effort in seeking spiritual pleasure and consolation; they never tire, therefore, of reading books; and they begin, now one meditation, now another, in their pursuit of this pleasure which they desire to experience in the things of God.  These persons who are thus inclined to such pleasures have another very great imperfection, which is that they are very weak and remiss in journeying upon the hard road of the Cross; for the soul that is given to sweetness naturally has its face set against all self-denial, which is devoid of sweetness.

        Good time last night , I thought. Great discussion around those two quotes. They seemed to bring several things out that really confirmed the "kind" of faith we are practicing. I really appreciated what everyone said. Good stuff. Thanks, too, Matt, for teaching me the chords for  Holy Holy Holy  - I'll be working on that.   Retreat:   I'm thinking we'll stick with  June 11-13  unless things just get too funky and nobody can go. I'll get them to send the registration form - it's not confirmed until I send in the money. Once again, let's all really try to make it. Thanks.   Pax vobiscum.

       I got this in the  urlLink CQOD  daily email the other day. Since it refers to group dynamics, I thought it'd be good to post here to ponder:  "Above all, the group must keep remembering that true growth in grace is not to be achieved by our own efforts or contriving, but must be received as the gift of God's Spirit, working in and among us. The work of the group is to keep open the channels of receptiveness through study, discipline, prayer, and self-offering. When a group learns to live in this faith, it can keep the lines of endeavor tentative and sensitive to new headings and possibilities, on the one hand; and, on the other, move forward resolutely under such light as is now given." ~John L. Casteel,  Spiritual Renewal through Personal Groups  [1957]  Just a thought of encouragement as we gather tonight.

        A Quote from Thomas Merton    In our age everything has to be a "problem."  Ours is a time of anxiety because we have willed it to be so.  Our anxiety is not imposed on us by force from outside.  We impose it on our world and upon one another from within ourselves.  Sanctity in such an age means, no doubt, traveling from the area of anxiety to the area in which there is no anxiety or perhaps it may mean learning, from God, to be without anxiety in the midst of anxiety.   As I've read this over and over, I have no doubt that I sometimes struggle with anxiety.  I don't like being anxious.  I don't like feeling stressed.  I agree with Merton that I think some of that we certainly bring on ourselves but the bigger question to me is how do we learn "to be without anxiety in the midst of anxiety?"  Thoughts?

       Hey. Since we're back on here I thought I'd lay a few thoughts down about the community I've been having lately. In a few conversations here and there I've said to all of you who are a part of this thing that I feel like, sense, whatever, that  there are some evolutionary changes coming soon for Vine & Branches . I think these are going to be good things - things that God will use to help make us more the community He wants us to be - moving closer to the goal of transformation in Him.   Part of it will be a bit of stepping up of what we are already doing as far as liturgy goes.  This goes along with the "life of liturgy" thing that I've been talking about. Part of that is me and part of it is this whole community. It's not so much a total shift as it is just "kicking up a notch or two" where we're already headed. Folding into our community life more of the rhythm of the liturgy where we can.  I believe part of it, too, will be just a  ramping up of our common "owning" of the vision for vbcc . I do need and want to lead properly and part of that means to listen and then lay out overarching vision for what's going on. But it's not just about me for sure. We all need to walk into it - live in it. All that is just to say sort of taking a step further into what we already are and want to do.   Sooo - this Retreat...  I'm still waiting to hear from  The Ark in Berea  about going there  June 11-13  - our original date. It's much closer but a little more expensive than The Close, at  $45 a night per person . I'm pretty sure meals are included though. And, they have air conditioning, I think. Let's try hard to all do this thing. Dave and Jody Nixon from Vineyard Central are going to come down and lead this thing for us and bring a couple of the interns that are living in their house. This will be a very cool time.

           We had a great time meeting on our deck last night. The  urlLink vbcc  crew hadn't been together like that in a while. We decided to put the deck furniture to work for the community, and perfect weather helped. It was a very good time of hanging out, prayer, and discussion. I can feel more times on the deck to come. I put more photos on my fotopage this morning -  urlLink check it out .       Part of the Psalm from last night:   May the Lord answer in time of trial; may the name of Jacob's God protect you. ... Some trust in chariots or horses, but we in the name of the Lord. They will collapse and fall, but we shall hold and stand firm.    Last night's Reading:   Come to the Lord, a living stone, rejected by men but approved, nonetheless, and precious in God's eyes.  You too are a living stone , built as an edifice of spirit, into a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.  -1 Peter 2:4-5   There was more, but these are a couple of the things that jumped out at us as we prayed the evening prayer last night.  Another night of God inhabiting the liturgy for us  - the Psalm being perfect for where most of us are at in our lives right now - very encouraging as we read it back and forth to each other. And the big thing in the Reading from 1 Peter that stood out was,   "You too are a living stone..."   Wow. That's gigantic. We too, like Jesus, are living stones. We are being built into a building of the spirit - to house and show forth the Life and Nature of God on the earth.  That's what it's all about  - that's the huge thing we're all doing. And it's not necessarily spectacular or visible at all - not in the way we think of things being "visible." It is the regular life we have all been called to live. The real life of the Spirit that was created for us in the beginning. I said at one point last night that my great desire for the community of vine & branches was to see us  get   the regular, long-haul Spiritual life  - that our lives are about this constant transformation in Christ - into who we were created to be. If we get that and live it, that would be so huge. That would be miles beyond even being healed of a disease - it really would.  Oh, and there's that part about, just like Jesus also,  "...rejected by men, but approved, nonetheless, and precious in God's eyes."  I suppose we should not be surprised about the first part, but also not be so discouraged about it either because of the second part. Good stuff.

       I got this quote from the  urlLink CQOD  email the other day and thought it would be good to share here, not because we need to practice this more, necessarily, but more because it spoke to me of what we're trying to do as a community and as a confirmation that, slowly but surely, we're getting there:  Within the life of the church, the paths of the single and the married should not be allowed to diverge. The shared life of the Christian community must become a context in which the differing gifts can be used for each other. There is much still to be learned about this. Are the homes of married Christians an added support for the single? Is the availability of the single Christian put at the disposal of his married friends, for "babysitting" duties and the like? And what is true of the mutual support of married and single needs to be true in a wider way of the care exercised by the married and the single for each other, so that nobody's home life becomes completely cut off from support and help. ~Oliver O'Donovan (1945- ),  "Marriage and the Family in The Changing World"   We may have a ways to go, but we  are  getting there...

       I just wanted to say that I thought the retreat this past weekend rocked! (in a very contemplative, quiet way).  :-)  The Nixons were great.  It was a pleasure getting to know them better.  I was certainly encouraged listening to them share about communal living, contemplative prayer, service to others, etc.   I hope we'll continue to be intentional in setting aside times like this in the future. It was really helpful to me personally, and I know I'm not alone.

       Since we've been discussing lately the integration of the "spiritual" life and the "ordinary" life, I found today's quote from  urlLink CQOD  especially fitting:  "Prayer and action, therefore, can never be seen as contradictory or mutually exclusive. Prayer without action grows in powerless pietism, and action without prayer degenerates into questionable manipulation. If prayer leads us into a deeper unity with the compassionate Christ, it will always give rise to concrete acts of service. And if concrete acts of service do indeed lead us to a deeper solidarity with the poor, the hungry, the sick, the dying, and the oppressed, they will always give rise to prayer. In prayer we meet Christ, and in him all human suffering. In service we meet people, and in them the suffering Christ." ~Henri J. M. Nouwen (1932-1996),  Compassion  [1982]

       No, we haven't forgotten. We will not let it drop out of memory.  The Vine & Branches Community Schola moves forward.  Kyle and I were talking more about it last night and I think we'll go back to the original idea of studying some of the Church Fathers, especially at the beginning. Some of it may be a little thick but I think, well worth it. I'll be looking through some of the early basic teachings and we'll have something to read through.  The plan, loosely, is to have our  introductory meeting in early September . I'll put up more details later. Looking forward to it.

       As many of you know from reading my blog, I've been listening to a great message that a friend of mine did called   urlLink A Mixed Drink . &nbsp; In this message, he looks at how the Bible views alcohol and basically concludes that alcohol is one of the many good things given by God meant for our enjoyment, within moderation (i.e. no drunkenness).&nbsp; That's the view I hold as well.  &nbsp;  To get more to my question . . . many Christians today use wine during communion.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, we follow that practice at VBCC.&nbsp; One question that Chris touches on is using grape juice vs. wine for Communion.&nbsp;&nbsp;How does a faith community handle Communion when someone who is a struggling alcoholic becomes a part of that and shares in Communion each week?&nbsp; That's not an issue with VBCC now but what about down the road?  &nbsp;  Thoughts?

       This might be a silly suggestion, if it is just say so.  My feelings won't be hurt, I promise.  We talked some this past Tuesday about some practical ways to share things as a community.  Alan mention some good ones, (garden, Sam's Club, helping each other) and I meant to suggest one other.  What about  sharing   books ?  Perhaps we could include a complete list on the VBCC website?  I don't know . . . just a thought.  It seems a bit silly for all of us to be buying books when someone in our community may own it already!  Thoughts?

       I hate to only ever be posting quotes on here, but it seems like every time we get together and deal somewhat seriously with a subject, it comes up in my  urlLink CQOD  email a day or two later. Just as a little disclaimer, I realize that this quote  could  (by some) be read as a kind of "rebuke" of our planning stages, but I don't see it that way. I see it as a kind of confirmation that we're on the right track, that we're trying to move away from some of the things Mr. Reid is talking about. And, too, if you notice the date of the quote, it also tells us that we Christians have been struggling with some of these issues for quite a while. Anyway, with no further ado, here's the quote:  "This is the age of the conference and study group--people talking about what they know they should be doing. In a subtle way, talking about something becomes an excuse for not doing it. This new bolt-hole of the conference and study group is not confined to the local congregation. It is a painful fact of life in the central structures of the churches. We have a welter of reports, commissions, surveys, liaison bodies, and so on. They have the appearance of progressive thinking and readiness to face change, combined with the function of being delaying devices. They are the sacraments of current Christianity, and its dilemma. Outreach is a move from power structures to meekness structures, and, in spite of the fact that Christians believe that it is the meek who shall inherit the earth, they show (as in the ecumenical movement) a distinct reluctance to relinquish power-structure thinking. ~Gavin Reid,  The Gagging of God  [1969]

       Well, looks like we're ON! Matt has graciously offered his place for our monthly  vbcc schola  meetings. So, we'll be meeting on High Street on the  second Sunday of each month, at 3pm (say 3-4:30) .    Our first meeting will be Sunday, September 12.  We will discuss what materials we'll be reading, how thing will work as far as reflection papers, etc. Again, no pressure to be involved. Peace. Looking much forward to it.
