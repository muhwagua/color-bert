        I'm Expecting A Kid!!   Those who know me may ask: "How is that possible, Gary? You don't even have a girlfriend." Well, I will tell you: my niece is coming down to visit for a week or two (two, hopefully). I'm pretty excited about it. We usually have a lot of fun together, plus it's always nice to have someone around who will get me off my ass to go do things (having my niece or nephews down pretty much equates into a temporary excercise program for me, which is a good thing). I'm already thinking of cool things to do with her like hitting some art museums, getting her own Blog started, playing some tennis, shooting some basketballs, eating lunches out, a library visit perhaps, and maybe even a trip to the beach (even though I hate the beach). It'll be fun.  This week I've been...   Listening to : I can't get "The D" out of my head or off my Windows Media Player. Tenacious D rocks, my friends. "Wonderboy", from their CD, is one of theirs that I've been listening to over and over again. I also found a crazy Tenacious D track called "Spiderman", which starts off with the theme song to "Spiderman" and then segues into complete lunacy with a musical play-by-play of "Spidey", some guy named David Dark, and "Sassafrassqatch", chasing each other around stage and engaging in "ultimate championship fighting". At one point, one of them whips out their weiner; though I'm not sure who. The whole thing ends with that David Dark guy getting pooped on by Sassafrasssquatch. Complete madness, I tell you!  On the stereo in my room, I've been playing a lot of Hendrix, mostly unreleased jams and outtakes. Jimi was simply amazing.    Reading : Kurt Vonnegut Jr's "Slaughterhouse Five", a very creative and interesting book.   Watching on TV : NBA playoffs (I'm rooting for Kings and Celtics in their conferences, the Kings overall), CNN Headline News, re-runs of "Whose Line Is It Anyway?", Howard Stern, and  "Politically Incorrect". A nice  melange  of news, sports and dick jokes.    Downloading : Tenacious D, baby! Plus I downloaded a few Blondie songs, and am currently jonesing to hear some Dio.   Eating : Still on my 1-meal-a-day diet and doing okay with it. I eat one meal a day, and can have pretty much anything I want (Pizza, to my utter sadness, is off limits). The rest of the day and night, when I'm hungry, I eat apples and oranges, and at night I allow myself a cup of green tea with some milk and honey in it. I'm surprised how well I am doing with it actually. The only set back I had was the week my cat died and even then, I didn't go overboard like I well could have in that circumstance. Drinking a little too much Pepsi though (with my meal). Normally I'd just make Iced Tea with Equal in it, which is better for me than Pepsi, but  I get lazy sometimes  (this is what's called an "understatement").  Tea time!!

        The Daniel Pearl Execution Video   I just watched the Daniel Pearl execution/propaganda video and I am pissed. Sickened and pissed. I am sickened by the minds of people who could murder a person, in cold blood, and consider it "just" (or even "sane", for that matter), and I am pissed that American television isn't airing the video. I feel that every American  should  see this video, if for no other reason than to gain perspective into the mindsets of many of the people we must deal with on a worldwide basis. And they must be dealt with, especially now, because the threat is very, very real. But mainly, I feel, it is important that we, as Americans, see the video because we need a dose of  reality . Shock treatment, if you will. It's a different world now, and Americans are  targets . We can no longer travel anywhere in the world as simple tourists. As of Septmeber 11th, hunting season on Americans is open and there are hunters out there looking for  us ; for you, for me, and for any other Daniel Pearls out there that they can get their murderous hands on.  One other very important thing about the Daniel Pearl video that Americans need to know, is that he was killed not just because he was an American, but because he was a  Jewish  American. Once again, religion rears it's ugly head. The people who mudered him made him recite many things including the fact that he was a Jew, his Father was a Jew, and his Grandfather was a Jew. They made him make dissenting statements about America's support of Israel as well; all the more reason why Americans should see this video. The people we are dealing with over there are not so different from the Nazis we fought in WWII except they are poorer and less organized. Just what the world needs: Third World Nazis.   Did I mention that they are delusional as well? At the end of the video, they threaten to kill more Americans until their demands are met, demands which include us giving them some F-16 fighter jets that they say we owe them. Sure Mohammed, that'll happen....NOT! I don't mean to be so flippant, but how much more unrealistic a demand could there be, especially at this point in time?   Look, the Middle East is a mess and it  always has been . We are not going to change things over there by sending more American soldiers over there; the only way to change things over there is to wipe out what's there and begin again with a clean slate, which is just not going to happen. To be honest, it needn't be our business to change things over there anyway. If it weren't for their precious oil, we probably wouldn't need to have anything to do with those people at all. What we need, more than anything else, is to change things  here . We need to find and utilize alternative fuel sources and we need to stop buying oil from the Middle East. Period. Let's get the folks who are responsible for what happened on 9/11, and then let's get the hell out of there. Let them do to themselves what they will, and lets just take care of America and our fellow Americans.   That's my 2 cents.   Gary

        Memorial Day 2002   Today was Memorial Day, the day America "pays tribute" to the people who have lost their lives supporting the higher causes of Freedom and Democracy and the American Way. And how did we, as Americans (myself included), "pay tribute" to those people? We barbecued, we went to the movies, many of us slept in all day and/or watched TV all day, we went to the beach; for the most part, business as usual. We really should've had nationwide celebrations and tributes to those people whose blood was spilled and lives lost, something that would've equated the importance of their sacrifices to our daily lives; instead we got a few war movies on cable. We are, for the most part, spoiled people and spoiled people normally don't think about what it takes to keep our living standards as high as they are. If so many courageous men (and some women) hadn't died on the battlefields throughout the years, would our lives be the same today? Instead of dancing to fresh rap grooves on Total Request Live, perhaps we'd be goosestepping to the beat of  Deutschland Uber Alles  on Der Fuhrer's Requests Live (oddly enough, still hosted by Carson Daly). Perhaps, instead of watching "Friends" on Thursday nights, we'd be tuning in to a show called "Comrades". At the very least, we should all take a few moments on this day to remember what Memorial Day is  really  about and to say a quiet "thank you" to those who perished.   What I did today: Slept in. Worked on the PC for a few hours. Watched a Saturday Night Live marathon on TV. Played my guitar. Took a nap. Downloaded Blondie songs and Wilco's new CD from Limewire. Watched more TV. Took a few moments to remember the folks who died throughout the years, enabling me to do all of these things today.   Peace.  Gary

        Rocking With JB and KG   My Memorial Day weekend, thus far, has been spent almost entirely sitting on my ass in front of the PC. A lot of the time was spent working, but for the last 3 hours tonight, I've been downloading and listening to Tenacious D songs from Limewire (I don't have a CD burner, so you record company execs out there need not worry: if I like the music, I'll buy the CD). Jack Black is becoming one of my favorites; it seems he can just about do anything and do it well. Last night they re-ran the Saturday Night Live episode he hosted awhile back. I thought he was great throughout the show, which was a pretty good one by SNL standards. Plus, "the D" appeared on the show as well. I guess watching that put me in the mood for some JB and KG tunes tonight. If you haven't heard the Tenacious D CD, do yourself a favor and check out "Dio", "Tribute", and, if you don't mind explicit language, "Kielbasa". OK, I'm out of here; it's way past my bedtime and I have a lot of sitting on my ass to do tomorrow. Rock on!

        In Praise Of ....Tommy Lee ?!?!?   In my last post I touched on "the dumbing down of America", and in this one I am going to praise the new Tommy Lee CD. Go figure. I happened to catch him playing his song "Hold Me Down" on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (a show I normally do not watch) and really hated it. Not so much the song, but Tommy himself, and his guitarist. Tommy's vocals were pretty rough, but that didn't bother me much. What  did  bother me was that, quite often, he would adopt a pseudo-British accent when he sang. Very strange. Very lame. Lamer yet, when Tommy played guitar and sang, he would smile at the camera/audience with a "look at me ladies, I'm shy and sexy" smile, which simply made me ill (guys with tattoos all over their bodies and huge nose rings just should not be behaving in that manner). When I saw him do it the first time (and he did it a lot), the word "poser" came immediately to mind; a word that I've rarely used since the late '80's/early 90's (the "hair band" years). His guitarist bothered me too, but not for his looks or his behaviour, but because his guitar playing sucked. He'd go off and do a Cobain-type solo (complete with Kurt-style over-the-top guitar effects) and it would leave a gap, sonically, in the song. It all seemed weird and out of place in the song anyway. Luckily, in the CD's mix, the guitar (and everything else) comes together in a cohesive manner and sounds just right. Sure, Tommy still seems to be singing with a British accent at times, but overall, his vocals are decent, the songs are catchy and the CD is well produced. I would recommend Tommy Lee's "Never A Dull Moment" CD to  most  people. By no means is it another "Electric Ladyland" or "Physical Graffiti", but it's a very enjoyable listen, and that's good enough. Enjoy!

        Politically Incorrect ...No More   I am extremely disappointed that "Politically Incorrect" has been cancelled. We hear the term "the dumbing down of America", and this is just one more step down that road. Worse yet, I heard that "PI" is being replaced by a new show starring... Jimmy Kimmel. Now, don't get me wrong, I have nothing against Jimmy Kimmel, and I've enjoyed almost everything I've seen him in, but his humor is markedly less intelligent and thought-provoking than Mahr's. Mahr's show, filled primarily with debates about current political issues, was always done with a wicked comedic edge and a viewpoint that you seldom see on national television. He spoke for a lot of us whose views are considered minority viewpoints. For that, I'd like to say "Thanks, Bill". "Politically Incorrect" will be sorely missed.

        VIRTUAL ANUS (that's me!)   Here goes nothing.....  I'm going to use this forum to voice my thoughts and opinions, but mostly to complain and whine about things. Many of the things I will be complaining and whining about will be things that, if I actually put some effort into them, I could change if I weren't so busy complaining and whining about them here.   Sometimes the things I have to say will be insightful and witty, and sometimes they will be boring and stupid and will make a loud sucking sound as you read them.  By the way, if you came here looking for an actual virtual anus (and why, exactly, would you be doing that?), I hate to disappoint you, but the only anus here is me. Which, I suppose, would make me an "ani". Or maybe not.  (cue loud sucking sound)   OK, I'm outta here.

        Nightmare   WARNING: Not For The Sqeamish!!   I'm NOT kidding!!  I had a really bad dream last night which really gave me the creeps. It's probably the most horrifying dream I can ever remember having. Here goes...  I dreamt that I had a mass of tiny pin-sized white worms boring holes into my body while I desperately tried pulling them out. I was throwing them to the side in giant handfuls. Some poked out through tiny inflamed holes on my legs and belly and I pulled them out, some came out, but some broke off inside. At one point, I pulled a giant worm out from near my ribs and was shocked at how large and slimy it was. As I pulled it out of my body, I could see the rest of it pulling out under my skin. While I was extracting that one, the little ones were still working. They ate my right forearm almost hollow and through a hole in the skin (more like a tear) I could see them squirming around inside, eating me alive. I kept reaching into the hole, pulling out worms; sometimes handfuls of them, looking like bloody spaghetti. I kept getting the feeling that I was being overcome, that resistance was futile, that I was a goner for sure.   Then I woke up.   I am not a dream interpreter, but I know this one can't be too good. My guess is that it's about dying and the inevitability of death. If we dream dreams for a reason, then the true purpose of this one is a bit baffling to me since I already know and accept that death is a certainly in life, and that someday, I will die. Maybe it's a forewarning of a terminal disease, like Cancer, for instance. Maybe it simply means that time is running out, a wake-up call, if you will, to do the things that need to be done before it's too late to do them. But then again, maybe it's just a dream and nothing more. I don't know, but it gives me the creeps to think about it. It's all speculation, but one thing is a definite certainty: I'm not eating spaghetti for awhile.

        This week I've been...    Listening to: Jimi Hendrix -  urlLink Band of Gypsys (Live at the Fillmore East) CD    Playing: Still playing a lot of "Dr.Mario", which I got into again while on vacation.  Reading: I'm more than halfway into Robert Louis Stevenson's "The Strange Case Of Dr.Jekyll And Mr.Hyde", written in 1886. I've seen the movie and TV shows, but the book is much more interesting than I'd remembered from those. I found a website just now where you can  urlLink read the book online , which is pretty cool!  Watching on TV: Mainly my usual late night shows (Howard Stern and Politically Incorrect). Last night I watched the 2002 NBA Draft. Tonight, I watched "The Crocodile Hunter" (Finally! A new one!!), and two shows where they reveal magician's secrets. Pretty interesting stuff!  Downloading: Nothing. I deleted Kazaalite when I had my computer problems and the site has been down all week so I haven't been able to download it again (which really pisses me off!).   Eating: Not as steady as I was before vacation (Wednesday was especially bad), but getting back on track again.  Feeling: Not happy, not sad, just ...ehh (which is a little more upbeat than "Blah").

        "Blah"   The last two days I've spent just trying to get back to my usual routine, both at home and at work. I really threw everything out of whack during my vacation last week, and now I'm paying for it. I'm feeling very burnt out and totally ...."Blah". My lower back is bothering me again also, so I've been resting in bed a lot, and ultimately napping, which is making it extremely hard for me to get a good night's sleep when I finally do go down for the night. I toss and turn all night long, hardly sleeping at all. Today, I woke up half an hour before the alarm went off, which sucks much ass. Between naps, I've been playing "Dr.Mario" and listening to Hendrix. Not very productive. "Blah". At work, I came back on Monday and they had a new girl they hired doing my usual job, which didn't sit well with me. I let them know that I was unhappy with that arrangement, so hopefully that'll change. I was supposed to be off tomorrow, as per usual, but they need me to work it now (they're short-handed), so that also sucks major ass. "Blah".

        Saturday/Sunday   I got up around 2pm and started working. I got a bunch of packages ready to mail (my usual routine), but I never got to the post office. Instead, I watched "Vacation" again with my niece and then made her a tape to practice guitar to. After that, we played some "Dr.Mario". My two nephews were supposed to come down and stay the night and finally got here around 6pm. I played with the boys for awhile in my room. The little one would stand on a blanket on my bed, then I'd pull it from under him so that he'd fall on his booty or else the older nephew and I would hold a blanket across the bed so that the little one would trip over it and fall on his face. Don't ask me why, but he loved doing that, so that's what we did for half an hour or more. I tried showing the older boy how to play "Dr.Mario", but he was having trouble with it and soon grew bored/frustrated. My Mom and nice went out to pick up dinner (mmm...Sonny's!) while I spent some time with the older boy looking at and trading basketball cards with him. When the food arrived, we chowed down, big time, once again. After dinner, I put a tape on for the little one (he loves the Japanese TV show " urlLink Johnny Sokko And His Flying Robot ",  just like I did as a child), and then me, my niece and my older nephew went out and played catch with the football awhile, and then, after that, we went to my room and played "Dr.Mario" some more. After a bit, we came out and watched "Vacation"... again! My older nephew hadn't seen it. The little one had already crashed with Grandma at that point and then halfway through the movie, my niece crashed too. After the movie, me and my nephew went outside around 2:30am and threw the frisbee for quite a while. We played "Dr.Mario" until my nephew fell asleep, and then I played it myself until around 5am.  I slept like crap that night. My nephew took my comfy pillows and quilt and I just couldn't get comfortable. My Mom and little nephew woke me up around 1:30 pm, but I wasn't ready to get up yet, then they did again around 2:30pm. I got up then, but was still very tired. I ate breakfast (Burger King Ham, Egg & Cheese Croissants...yum!) and then woke my niece up, who had been in bed for around 13 hours. Bum! I had my niece practice her guitar with the tape I had made for her while my older nephew played "Dr.Mario". Eventually, me and my niece ended up playing "Dr.Mario" again. It's funny, I hadn't had that game out for at least five years (probably more), and now we can't stop playing it. I went out to the living room with the boys and played with them awhile and we wound up watching the last half of "Aliens". Around 8pm, their Dad arrived and everybody got packed up and left for home. I must've been in bed about half an hour later. I slept 'til around Midnight, got up, ate dinner, washed clothes, worked on the PC, blogged, and went back to bed sometime around 3am. I was hoping to get some real sleep before I got up at 10 am for work.  You know, that's the bad thing about vacations: they always end.

        Friday   Friday, I got up around 1:30pm, got ready to go, and we left for the  urlLink Museum Of Fine Arts  by 2:30. I had never been there before, so it was a real treat for me. There are just so many great things there, and I enjoyed looking at almost everything, from the Monet paintings to the Hindu shrine, from the ancient Egyptian idols to the the Blackfoot Indian elkhide gloves, so it's hard to say what I enjoyed most. I guess I liked the ancient Roman and Greek art the best. Not so much for the actual art itself (although several beads in a Roman necklace were almost mesmerizing with their beauty), but because of what they were and where they had been. Necklaces worn around ancient Roman necks, statues formed by ancient Greek hands;  it was like looking back into the past, and I love that. My niece enjoyed the Mexican pottery the most, also because of it's age (some of it almost 2000 years old). One of the things I learned from my visit is that we, over time, have lost something very important. If you look at plates, vases, and furniture from the past, you'll see intricate ornamentation, craftsmanship, and beauty. Look at the same things from today, all mass-produced and ultimately disposable, and you will see what it is that we are missing: artistry, craftsmanship, and beauty. It's the little things in life that make it so beautiful. After we left the museum, my Mom suggested we hit the  urlLink Salvadore Dali Museum  while we were there, which was a great idea. This was the third time I'd been there, but the first time for my niece. We breezed through the non-Dali Cubism sculpures exhibit (they had a Picasso there), and I acted as tour guide for her. My niece is kind of hard to gauge sometimes, I couldn't tell if she was bored or enjoying it. She did say she liked two of Dali's masterworks best, especially " urlLink The Hallucinogenic Torreador " and " urlLink Discovery Of America By Christopher Columbus ". I hope she enjoyed her time there as much as I did. After we left there, we went looking for some grub. We finally settled on Red Lobster (Mom's fav) and the three of us chowed down. I had the "surf and turf", but had to send the steak back as it was undercooked. The lobster was a little undercooked too. Everything else was great though, and we had a good time, so it was all worthwhile.  From there we went to Park Plaza and hit the Sound Exchange (records/CDs/videos) and just looked around. Everything was too expensive for my liking and none of us bought anything. We went to a thrift shop after that and bought nothing there either. On the way out, we walked over to a bargain shop (I think that was what it was called) and my niece found some skincare stuff she wanted and I found some blank cassette tapes for a killer price (five 90 minute Maxell tapes for $2.50 + 10% off) and bought a bunch of them.  From there we went across the street to Blockbuster and rented FIVE movies! My niece, still on her Leslie Nielson kick, picked out "Naked Gun 33 1/3", "Repossessed", and "Wrongfully Accused", and I picked out "The Jerk" and "Vacation". I figured if she liked Leslie Nielson's humor, she'd like Chevy Chase and Steve Martin too (she did).  We went for ice cream at "Missing Links" and then stopped at Walgreens for Goobers and some Starbucks ice coffees (movie snacks) before returning home. Ahhh, the joys of being off my diet!  We watched movies all night long, taking a break from them only once, when we went outside and played catch with my mini-football. That was cut short though, when a bat flew low over my head several times. Flying bastard! So, we went back in and watched movies until somewhere around 6am, when we went to bed. We wound up watching  all five movies  that night!

        Thursday   I didn't go to bed around 4am like I thought, in fact, I didn't make it there until around 5:30am. I wound up watching the last 3 episodes of "Police Squad!" with my niece again (she can't get enough of that show or of Leslie Nielson). I woke up around 2pm (my niece was already up watching "Police Squad!" again) and, instead of going out for the day as I had planned, we decided to stay in. I ordered from Bradford Pub and we chowed down (me on Nachos, she on Steak-N-Cheese hoagie). Afterwards, we watched a little of the Marx Brother's movie "Horse Feathers" (just a little, my niece didn't get a lot of the jokes) and then "The Pink Panther Strikes Again". Later, I went to my room (by myself) and played "Dr.Mario" awhile. My niece came in after a bit and I worked with her on guitar some more. I taught her part of AC/DC's "Back In Black", Led Zeppelin's "Dazed And Confused" and "Communication Breakdown", Muddy Water's "Mannish Boy", Cream's "Sunshine Of Your Love", and Green Day's  "When I Come Around". She has trouble fingering the notes and moving from position to position, but she catches on fairly quickly. Later we went out and played catch with my mini-football (I've about given up on Frisbee with her!). It felt awesome outside tonight! Overcast and windy...sweet! After that, we came in and watched most of "Young Frankenstein", but we both got bored with it. I put on some of my old tapes from the late '80's /early '90's instead, and we watched a little "Beavis & Butthead" and some old "Saturday Night Live's". Pretty mellow day today. My niece has already gone to bed, I'll be going to mine shortly. Tomorrow: the museum!

        Wednesday   Got moving around 2:30 pm today. Got showered, and then me, Mom, and my niece left the house around 3:15 pm. We went to Goodwill (I get books cheap there), but there were slim pickings today and I found nothing worthwhile except some LP's (which including some Hendrix),  but all were just too thrashed for my liking, so I bought nothing. We went to another thrift shop, but the results were about the same. We went on to Seminole Music where I checked out prices on acoustic guitars. I figured I'd talk to my sister and brother-in-law this weekend about getting one for my niece, so I needed some prices to give them. From there we went to Express Music, which is run by a guy named Perry, who I dealt with a lot back in the late '80's/early'90's. He had a halfway decent guitar there for $99 (a blue Aria), so I told my Mom about it and she, surprisingly, decided to buy it for my niece right there and then. She got a tuner too, at my insistence. We went from there to Sonny's, where we chowed down ...BIG TIME. I was stuffed! By the time I got home I had a major headache that has lasted all night long. I played around with my niece's guitar awhile, then I played around on the PC. We went out for ice cream after that, and after we got home I went back and did crossword puzzles with my niece. A little later, we watched "Spaceballs" (Rick Moranis was hilarious!) and then "A Shot In The Dark" (Peter Sellers was brilliant!). It is almost 4am now, and I am pooped. My headache is still raging too, so I guess I'll take a pill and hit the sack. My niece is still wide awake and doing more crossword puzzles. Don't know when I'll be up tomorrow. I still need to do my PC stuff, but there just hasn't been any time.

        Tuesday   I woke up early from the thunderstorm we had this morning and went back to my Mom's room where my Mom (who took today and tomorrow off from work) and niece were awake from the storm as well. I jumped into bed to torment my niece a bit and eventually fell asleep. I woke up around 1pm and got her up too. We had some lunch (Sloppy Joes and potato salad) and then watched the rest of "Airplane!" and 3 episodes of "Police Squad!". It was a pretty yucky day out so we didn't go anywhere. We went to my room and played "Dr. Mario" for awhile, until later when my Mom took my niece up to the pool. That's when the day went sour. I was thinking about what the three of us could do for dinner when they returned with a bag of Taco Bell in hand; Taco Bell for them, that is, none for me. I was pissed. I couldn't believe my Mom did that. I wouldn't have slighted either of them like that. No consideration whatsoever. And to make it worse, not only was there no apology, but my Mom tried to make it out that, somehow, it was my fault that she didn't pick me up anything (she never admits she's wrong about anything, no matter what). So I sat on the couch and watched TV by myself, not saying another word to either of them, while they ate dinner. My feelings were hurt. They ate their food and then they went back to my Mom's room together. That was about two hours ago, and not a word from either one of them. What a fun night. Thanks, Mom!  Finally, I got my niece and we went outside and threw the frisbee until it got boring, then we went back in and watched the "David Blaine: Street Magic" (that guy is awesome) and then the last 3 episodes of "Police Squad!". I worked with her on the guitar awhile, showing her a few more easy tunes (including "Whistle While You Work" and "Twinkle Twinkle Little  Star"), and then we watched "Naked Gun 2 1/2". It is almost 5am now and she just went to bed, I'll be going to bed myself, shortly. I have a feeling we aren't going to do much tomorrow, other than sleep.

        Sunday/Monday   Well, my niece has been down since Sunday night, so I've been occupied with doing stuff with her mostly. Sunday night we played frisbee after dark, and I started her up with her own Blog, but we didn't do too much otherwise. Monday, we went to my work to pick up my paycheck and then on to the bank to cash it, then we went over to Largo Mall and hung out awhile. We had icre cream at the Marble Slab, where they mix whatever toppings you choose (like chocoloate chips, oreo cookies, shredded coconut, etc..)  into your ice cream right in front of you on a frozen marble slab. Pretty neat. Then we went over to a pet store and looked at and played with puppies, kittens, rabbits and ferrets for a bit. We were going to go bowling next, but my niece didn't put on socks, so that was out. It started to rain then, so we headed home. We stopped off at China Beach, a Chinese restaurant nearby, and chowed down. I had their Onion Pepper Steak with a side of steamed Snow Peas (which, by the way, rule), and my niece had the Shrimp Egg Foo Young. We got home, stuffed, and then I ran to the bathroom (nature didn't just call, it screamed) and my niece started panicking because it had started raining hard. She immediately turned on the Weather Channel (in addition to bugs, snakes, asteroids, and other stuff, she's afraid of tornadoes now too). We watched Saturday Night Live on TV awhile, then we went to my room and taught her how to play "Happy Birthday" and "Itsy-Bitsy Spider" on my guitar. She had been wanting to learn how to play the guitar and those were easy enough songs. She picked up on them pretty quickly and did fairly well. We went out soon after that, and played catch on the porch with a basketball, then a football. We  went out and played frisbee in the rain for awhile finally. This ended when two drunken neighbors began arguing and fighting inside their home. We went in and I hooked up my old Nintendo, which I had to clean because I discovered that an old cat of ours had pissed/sprayed all over it (it had been many years since I had it out last). I hooked it up and she played Dr.Mario (my favorite Nintendo game) for awhile. Later on, we had a late supper and sat on the couch and watched "The Naked Gun" and half of "Airplane!" before she got tired and went on to bed. I went to my bed soon after and read another Sherlock Holmes story before I fell asleep.

        The last few days, I've been...     Listening to : Not a whole lot lately. I have a  urlLink Robin Trower CD  in my CD player in my bedroom, but I haven't played it for days.   Reading : Currently reading "The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, a collection of his Sherlock Holmes stories. Very enjoyable stuff. I also find it pretty cool to be reading stories from a hundred years ago. They seem so modern, reminding me a great deal of the TV show "Columbo", which I'm sure was inspired by Conan Doyle's tales.    Watching on TV : Tonight I watched "Osmosis Jones" (because I've always liked Bill Murray) and also the Lennox Lewis/Mike Tyson fight. "Osmosis Jones" was ok. Some funny parts, but it never seemed to decide whether it was a kids movie (the little girl and the cartoon action seemed geared to the kids) or a grown-ups movie (the sex references, the violence), so I enjoyed it at times, and it bored me at times as well. It's not a bad movie, but it's not that great either. I probably wouldn't watch it again, and I don't think I could wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone.    The Lewis/Tyson fight was actually fought last weekend, but I wasn't paying $50 for Pay-Per-View to see it live. It was a much anticipated fight that fell flat. Tyson never had a chance. Lennox Lewis was bigger, smarter, and seemed to have more desire to win than Mike Tyson. Towards the end of the fight, Tyson was hardly throwing any punches at all and it seemed that only part of him (just his physical body) was in the ring. It's sad to see a once great fighter like "Iron Mike" Tyson so deteriorated and dominated. I hope he does the smart thing and retires. As for Lewis, I like seeing a well-spoken and smart boxer as the champion, but he is just too damn cocky and egotistical for my liking. When someone starts referring to themselves in the third person, I find it hard to embrace that person.   Downloading : Nothing. I deleted almost everything on my PC (trying to locate my corrupt files) and all of my download programs are gone. I made back-ups of a bunch of my files today in preparation for the wiping of my hard drive.   Surfing : If you'd read my previous post, you'd know I was checking out cows.   Eating : When Mom and I were out today, we stopped at Missing Links (a golf range with  the best  ice cream) and I had their awesome Lemon milkshake. Sweet! I had Sonny's for lunch (sliced pork, baked beans, coleslaw, garlic bread) and leftovers for dinner. I'm off my diet for the next 10 days (while I'm on vacation), in case you couldn't tell! I'm still not as bad as I was before though. For instance, I didn't get french fries with my meal at Sonny's. In the past, I surely would have. I've quit eating fast food almost entirely. I might have salads or something along that line, but fried foods are out, diet or no.   Feeling : Feeling okay. I'm looking forward to having fun this week, but I have a few problems to contend with (wiping and re-loading my PC, money issues), so my outlook is not entirely rosy.

        Holy Cow!   Mom and I were out running the usual Saturday errands and we ended up in a Hallmark store where Mom picked up a few Beanie Baby bears that she was looking for. While we we there, I saw a display that caught my eye. The display was for "Cows On Parade", collectible ceramic figurines that feature cows in unique and sometimes quite interesting and humorous designs. The one I liked best there was called "Daisy's Dream", and features a cow jumping to catch a frisbee. You can see it by clicking  urlLink HERE . It is completely silly and absurd, just the kind of thing that appeals to me.  It reminds me of those ceramic Jesus sports scenes, like  urlLink the football one , where Jesus is running with the ball and one kid is blocking him and the other is  attempting to tackle the son of God . Incredibly silly and ridiculous, and I absolutely love it!  The other Cow figurine that caught my eye is called "Aggie", which, for some reason, reminds me of a Salvador Dali painting called " urlLink The Hallucinogenic Torreador ". You can see "Aggie"  urlLink HERE . Compare the two yourself and see if you can perceive a connection. I think I connect it through Dali's use of colors and dots and also with the image of the bull, which, in typical Dali fashion, is painted as an optical illusion.    I think what I like best about these "Cows On Parade" collectibles is the creativity of the designs. I found a website where you can see all of the different designs, just click  urlLink HERE , and it'll take you there. After looking through the site myself, I found a few worth mentioning: "Beehive Bovine" (no one that I've seen has yet connected it to it's obvious inspiration: "The Far Side" cartoons), "Disco Cow" (with it's glitter-ball shirt and gold astro-sign medallion), "Infinity" (I'm a sucker for anything celestial anyway), "Nascow Stockyard Race Cow" (he has wheels on his hooves, racing goggles, and flames on his hind quarters like a dragster...too funny!), "Sky Cow" (really cool), "Cowabunga" (pretty funny surfing cow), "Four Seasons" (very pretty), and "Mooonwalk" (a cow in a spacesuit). There were some Van Gogh inspired ones that were nice and a few psychedelic ones that were pretty cool too. Check them out!  I didn't buy any of the cow figurines at the Hallmark store (if I had, it'd be the frisbee one for sure), but I enjoyed looking at them and can certainly appreciate the creativity. It's kind of scary, though, that I'd be so into something I discovered in a... (gasp!)...  Hallmark store ... you know, a...  " chick store ".  (shivers)  Okay, I think I'd better go grab a beer, sit down in front of the TV, watch sports, and scratch myself until I feel manly again.   Moo!!

        SonOfABitch   Big computer troubles again. I tried to run the ScanDisk the other night and it would hit a certain point and then the computer would completely freeze-up. I called Gateway's technical support a few times, talked to a few different techs, and they did everything they could do but it didn't correct the problem. I tried everything I knew how to do as well, so the next and only thing left to do is to completely wipe my hard drive and then re-load everything again. What a major pain in the butt  that  is! I've had to do this a few times in the last couple years and let me tell you, if you haven't had to do this yet, it is incredibly time-consuming and tedious. It totally sucks ass, my friends. I am not looking forward to this at all. I guess I'll do this on Monday or Tuesday since I need the PC up this weekend for business.   On a positive note, I am now officially ON VACATION!! Woo-hoo!! I have the next week off and my niece is coming down, so it should be a fun week. If only I didn't have to deal with the whole PC mess...

        The NBA Finals Are Over   Was anyone surprised by the outcome? I certainly wasn't. This had to be the most boring NBA Finals ever. I'm still yawning. The Nets were hardly suitable competition for the Lakers, they couldn't even manage to win a single game in the series. Shaq dominated as usual, nothing new about that. He's a good guy and all, but he is just so much bigger and stronger than anyone else in the game, that it's hard to cheer for him: he's  expected  to dominate. The Lakers have won three in a row now, and it appears that they will continue to win many more NBA Championships. The rest of the league can only hope Shaq retires soon.

        Review: "Silence Of The Lambs" & "Hannibal"   In the past few days I've had the opportunity to read both of these Thomas Harris books and watch both films. Here are my thoughts on them...   The Silence Of The Lambs : The book is absolutely brilliant. The writing itself is wonderfully done and the depth and detail are stunning. I started reading it and I just couldn't put it down. Completely absorbing and highly recommended.  The film version is lacking some of the depth and detail, but it is so well put together that the things that got lost from book to film are hardly missed. This is one of the few rare instances where the film version is at least equal to the book version, if not better. Wonderful performances throughout (Anthony Hopkins was frightening in his intensity and Foster was just superb), great screenplay and flawless direction. No false notes here, everything stung of shocking reality. Highly recommended.   Hannibal : Unfortunately, I can't say the same things about this one. Don't get me wrong, the book is wonderfully written, very detailed and engaging, but the story and characters get a bit cartoonish and cliched at times, almost as if it were written for a comic book. The story is, quite often, a bit far-fetched. For one thing, there's the whole revenge-by-feeding-Lechter-to-the-pigs scenario, dreamed up by the "evil rich guy" character (who is no different from the kind you'd find in scores of bad Hollywood flicks, usually, the straight-to-video type) who comes complete with his own hired goons. The most unsatisfying part of the book isn't the cliches though, the part that really disappointed me was the way the creator seems to have completely betrayed his own creation at the very end. After the first book, and most of this one, I felt I got to know the "Clarice Starling" character, well enough to know that how she came out at the end of this book would be completely out-of-character for her: it just wasn't believable. She would have had to of gone completely insane in order for the ending to be somewhat credible. I think that Harris was either going for pure shock value, or else the ending was merely Hannibal's dream, but not credited or written as such. Had Harris stuck to reality and simplicity (two things that worked very much in his favor previously), had he left out the "evil bad guy" character altogether and written the story about Starling's attempt to locate and arrest the fugitive Lechter, but still utilizing Florence and the Italian Police Inspector in the story, it could have been great. As it is, I find it hard to recommend. The movie, to it's credit, eliminated the terribly ill-conceived ending from the book, but that still wasn't enough to save it from mediocrity. Unfortunately, the cliched characters and the silly "death-by-hogs" scenario were still in place, several imporatant characters that played heavily in the book's plot were written out of the movie (some of their traits and actions were added to existing characters, but that only served to make the characters seem a little more over-the-top), and Julianne Moore's portrayal of "Clarice Starling" had more in common with Sigourney Weaver's "Alien" heroine than it did with Jodie Foster's original take on her. Moore completely lacked the warmth and humanity that made Foster's portrayal so believable and touching. Anthony Hopkins was good, but his performance was less intense, and some of the actions of his Hannibal Lechter character seemed out-of-character for a man who is supposed to be a genius. For example, when he first met the Italian Police Inspector, he acted in a protagonizing manner that only served to draw the Inspector's suspicions. Is that the way an international fugitive trying to start a new life would behave? "Hannibal" is contrived and mediocre and, just like the book, I find it hard to recommend.

        This week I've been...     Listening to : Nothing at the moment, but I did download some MC5 songs and a few Iggy Pop & The Stooges tracks the other day. I'd always heard that they were great bands and I'd always been curious to hear them, so thanks to KaZaa (lite), I finally have, and I enjoyed them both. They were different than I had expected, more rock than punk, which is preferable to me anyway. Iggy Pop's voice at times reminds me of Mick Jagger, sometimes Lou Reed, and sometimes Jim Morrison. Good stuff.    Reading : I just finished Thomas Harris' "The Silence Of The Lambs" and am well into the follow-up, "Hannibal". Usually the book is much better than the movie, but the movie-version of TSOTL, as far as I can remember (I saw it a few years ago), is just as good as the book. It plays very closely to the book (which is very visual and flowing, just like a movie) and little of import got left out. I haven't watched the movie version of "Hannibal" yet, but I am downloading it (at this very moment) so I will watch it when I finish the book. I'm jonesing to re-read Kerouac's "On The Road" again, but I probably shouldn't because it really makes me want to say "fuck it all" and hit the road. I would love to travel the country like he did. Sigh....   Watching on TV : Nothing much. Mostly CNN, Howard Stern, and "Politically Incorrect". I got to watch "Insomniac" (with Dave Attell) tonight, luckily. They moved the times it airs and it's harder to catch anymore. I absolutely LOVE Dave Attell's comedy! He's one of the funniest guys around.     Downloading : "Hannibal"   Eating : My diet went off the rails on Saturday when my sister came down. I had a gyro (from Stavros) for lunch (plus one of his Baklavas) and then I had Nachos for dinner followed by some ice cream and cake (for her birthday). Not very healthy, but oh well, it was just one day of naughtiness. When my niece comes down next week, I'm sure my diet will go on hiatus, but I'll be back on track after she leaves.    Feeling : I don't feel as depressed as I had been feeling: almost upbeat, but not quite.

        Doom And Gloom (And Shit)   Lately I've been having an overwhelming feeling of doom. I don't think it's just me either: I see an underlying sadness almost everywhere, sometimes even in smiles. Things are going wrong. Very wrong. I haven't felt that "we're ok, and we're going to be ok" for a long time now. The feeling nowadays is that "it's coming, we won't know when or how, but it's coming". To me, "it" doesn't necessarily mean another terrorist attack either, "it" can just as easily refer to the continuing breakdown of our society. In truth, I'm more afraid of that than any terrorist attack. Where have common sense and good manners gone? Honesty and integrity? Personal responsibility? Anyone? Bueller? Bueller?

        My weekend   My sister, brother-in-law and 2 nephews came down Saturday evening and stayed til about 11:30 pm. Me and my bro-in-law rat-hunted (he bought a BB rifle for the occasion), I played frisbee with my older nephew (we played catch with a football too), I chased my younger nephew around the house and tickled him, we ate some killer food from Bradford Pub (I had my usual Buenos Nachos), and we had some cake (my sister's birthday is on Monday). I played around on the computer with the kids a bit too, even playing them a clip of Hendrix from Woodstock and an episode of "Beavis & Butthead" that I'd downloaded. I probably should have just let the older kid watch the B&B episode though; the younger one kept saying "ass munch" afterwards. It was a pretty fun night.

        ...And The Crap Keeps On A-Pilin'   So my brother-in-law came down and we tore through my Mom's closet looking for Mr.Rat and guess what? There was no rat to be found. I thought his only way out would be through the closet door, but the clever bastard found another way. Apparently, he opened up our fuse box (which is in my Mom's closet) and made his way out through that (there is an opening under the box). The box is behind a door and is four or five feet from the floor. He must have climbed up my Mom's dresses to the shelf and then nosed open the electric box enough to climb in. How he even knew that the fuse box door was a door is a mystery to me. How he knew that behind the door was an exit is also quite amazing. I hate rats, but I  really  hate clever ones. The million dollar question is: where is he now? I have a feeling he found his way out, but, you never know. You just never know. At least my Mother is home and sleeping in her own room tonight, so that's a good thing, but man, what a shitty situation this is! I will be keeping my ears and eyes open for along time; of that, I am sure.

        What A Crappy Week!   So true, and mostly due to that damn rodent, who, by the way, is still unaccounted for. I checked the traps every day and he still hasn't set them off. There is only one way out and he has not gone out that way or it'd be quite obvious (I closed it off and duct-taped it very, very well). The only other way out would be if he had eaten a hole through one of the two far walls which are obstructed with my Mom's clothes, but I have not heard any chewing or gnawing sounds. My brother-in-law is supposed to come down tonight and we are going to do a "hard target search of every gas station, residence, warehouse, farmhouse, henhouse, outhouse, and doghouse in that area". Or something like that. This "fugitive" rat will be caught tonight: dead or alive. My Mom has slept at a friends house for the last four nights and is wary of going into her own room or using her own bathroom now. Myself, I have had a very hard time sleeping all week and I've missed two days worth of work on account of our unwelcome houseguest. I went to work yesterday and yawned all afternoon long, I was so tired. I finally had a full night's sleep last night though, but I missed Game 2 of the NBA Finals in order to do so. I had laid down for a nap around 6:30 pm and started reading "The Silence Of The Lambs", which I didn't put down until I dozed off a few hours later. I didn't get up until 9:30 this morning. I really needed that "nap".

        Rat Update   It appears that the rat I saw behind the stove and the one trapped in my Mother's bedroom closet are one and the same. He must have travelled along the drain pipe from the kitchen the length of the house and came in again under my Mom's bathroom counter (I have since sealed off all of the holes he could've entered in through). That's the good news: it was just one lone rat. The bad news? The rat that I trapped in my Mom's closet is still there, alive and well.  Yesterday evening, the Pest Control lady came over and set several big traps in there. I checked on the traps today and they are still set. He hasn't touched them. Rat bastard! My Mom has since hauled ass. She has been staying over at a friend of hers the last two nights. It's just me now: me and a rat in the closet. Hopefully, when I get home from work tomorrow, I will find that he has taken the leap into eternity.  Find out tomorrow: same rat time, same rat channel.

        This week I've been...     Listening to : still on my Tenacious D kick! Will it ever end? I hope not.    Reading : I just finished Kurt Vonnegut Jr's "Jailbird", and have now started Woodward & Bernstein's "All The President's Men".    Watching on TV : the NBA Finals have begun, but I'm not much interested in the outcome. I'd like to see the Nets win, just because  they're the underdogs, but I think the Lakers will win it for the third time in a row. I don't really care either way. Haven't watched much TV otherwise.    Downloading : Live Tenacious D tracks mostly. I also downloaded Howard Stern's complete live radio broadcast from September 11th, 2001. I got very emotional listening to the events of that day, reliving them again. I hope it doesn't merely turn into "a historical event" over time and live on only in history books. I hope that the shock and the anger and the horror that we all felt that day, should  never  be forgotten.    Surfing : Thanks to the books I've been reading, I've been looking on the internet for more info on Sacco and Vanzetti, and I found a couple of sites that had audio of Nixon's Watergate tapes. Sacco & Vanzetti  and  Watergate figure into the storyline of "Jailbird", and "All The President's Men" is, of course, the story of the Watergate break-in and cover-up.    Eating : I have been slipping on my diet lately, not badly, but I just haven't been as faithful as I should be.    Feeling : Melancholy. Sigh.

        When The Cat's Away...   It was a normal evening up until about 12:30 am when I first heard ... it . I had been working on the computer, trying to respond to my numerous emails when I heard a  "scratch...scratch...scratch"  sound coming from the kitchen. At first, I thought it was just my cat in the litter box, but I quickly remembered that my cat was no longer here (he had died recently), so I supposed my Mom was out there fixing something to snack on ...but, when I turned around to look, I could see she wasn't in there.  "Scratch...scratch...scratch".  The range of possibilities of what could be making that noise narrowed considerably, and none of the possibilities made me happy: it was either a  very  large cockroach, or ...a mouse.   In the 25 plus years that I've lived here, I had never seen a mouse in my home, but I've seen more than my fill of roaches. I went out to investigate. I opened one of the doors under the sink and what I saw disheartened me greatly: mouse turds, and big ones at that. I ran to my room and quickly loaded my BB gun.  "Scratch...scratch...scratch". I came back to the kitchen minutes later with my BB gun in one hand and a flashlight in the other. I was ready to kick some mouse ass. I slowly pulled out the top drawer in the kitchen counter (slowly, because I didn't want anything jumping out in my direction) and saw nothing. The scratching had stopped. I pulled one more drawer out, again, slowly. Still nothing. It wasn't until I had all four drawers pulled out that I saw little chunks taken out of a piece of wood between the counter and the stove. I saw a lot more mouse turds, big ones, and I also got a good look at how it had likely entered my home.  My Mother had gotten my Brother-In-Law to do some plumbing work for us a few years ago, and where the drain to the kitchen sink leaves the house, he had left a gaping hole around it. Anything that wanted in, could easily get in through this hole. My Brother-In-Law wasn't a plumber-by-trade then (ironically, he is now), he was merely a landscaper who just considered himself a handyman. More accurately,  my Mom  considered him a handyman. I did mention that my cat had died recently (about three weeks ago), and his departure may be the reason this mouse has been so bold as to enter my home. My cat used to go under the counter from time to time, and I never knew why he'd want to go there as it was filled with cans of pesticides and cleaning stuff and seemed a rather unhealthy and unenjoyable place to hang out. Now that I think about it, perhaps that was his way of making his presence know, saying to the mice and rats and whatnot: "not in my house, you suckers". I miss my cat badly. I sat down on the kitchen floor and waited patiently for the mosue to show himself, flashlight in one hand, loaded BB gun in the other. It was then just past my normal bedtime, somewhere around 1:00 am, I should have been in bed, dreaming dreams. Rodent-free dreams. Instead, I was laying in wait like a hunter waiting on his prey: a would-be mouse assassin. Suddenly his head appeared and I was even less happy than I was before. This was no mouse, this was a ...rat! From the size of his head, I'd say thay he must've been about six inches long from rat nose to rat ass. I aimed the BB Gun towards his head, which began gnawing on the wood piece between the stove and the kitchen counter, and fired. He seemed to have heard the metallic "clink!" of the gun firing and the sound of the BB hitting the wall behind him and he seemed confused for a moment ...then he suddenly disappeared back behind the stove again.  Somewhere between first hearing the scratching noise and removing the drawers, I had pushed the stove in closer to the wall. I didn't know it then, but I had trapped him in. There was no way out except through the gap between the stove and the counter and there was a piece of wood blocking his exit, the same piece of wood he had been gnawing at even before I had completely trapped him. Why he was gnawing on it before, I do not know. As soon as I had figured out his situation, I pushed the stove in as far as I could, I put all of the drawers back in, closed all of the cabinet doors and grabbed some heavy items (full water bottle, tool box, a brick) to put in front of the doors, and then I ran back to get my Mommy.   When I went back to her room and told her of our uninvited houseguest, she became as unhappy as I was, if not more so. She likes rodents as much as I like televangelists. She was no help to me. I wanted her to hold the flashlight for me so I could get a good shot at the thing with the BB gun, but she wanted to remain out of the kitchen. She was beginning to freak out: "I'm scared!", she cried. I asked her if there was anyone she could call this late at night and she thought of someone and called them. Luckily, they had a rat trap that we could borrow. As she was leaving to go pick it up, I asked her to get some rat poison at Walgreens while she was out. So she left. A few moments later, Mr.Rat appeared again and began gnawing at the wood again. I took another shot and missed. My BB gun isn't very powerful, and it is very hard to hit what you aim for with it. The rat disappeared behind the stove again. I looked under the stove to see if any part of him was exposed (looking to get another shot off at him) and I saw his black tail flickering around. I began to hate him even more than Jerry Falwell. My Mom came back with an armful of anti-rat supplies. She had a big rat trap (with a piece of a Slim Jim as bait) which I set and laid out in front of the opening between the stove and counter, she had two glue traps which I laid around the hole in the floor, and she had a pack of mouse traps which were useless on rat this size. I had taken all the drawers out again to lay the traps and now I put them all back in again, also blocking the cabinet doors with the water bottle, the toolbox, and the brick. My Mom also propped a chair up against one door to make extra-sure that the rat wasn't getting out. I pulled the stove away from the wall a little so he could get out of his trap behind the stove and into the new and deadlier traps I had set for him. The waiting game had begun. It was now well after 2:00 am and I  had  to get to bed. We were short-handed at work and it was sure to be a busy and hectic day; I needed all the sleep I could get. So I went to bed.  No more than 30 minutes had past when my Mother began shrieking. There was, she screamed, a rat in her bedroom closet. So I got out of bed, put on my shirt and shorts, grabbed my BB gun, and ran back to her room. I was pissed by then. "What the fuck?!!?", I thought, "Where are these bastards coming from all of a sudden?"   My Mother was laying upright in her bed staring at her closet. "He went in there!" she exclaimed. I went over to her closet with the flashlight (her closet light no longer works) and saw nothing. If he was in there, he was trapped. There was only one way out and I'd have a nice clean shot at him (hopefully), plus I had a found another brick and would not hesitate to hit him with it. I waited awhile, lying on the floor with gun in hand and ready to shoot whatever moved. But alas, nothing did. It was getting later and later and I  really  had to get to bed or I would have to go to work with little or no sleep or else not go in at all. My Mom said that this one was about 4 inches long from rat nose to rat ass, so I thought the little traps she had bought at Walgreens might work on this one. I had her put Slim Jim in and I set them and laid two of them in her closet and two under her bathroom counter, where she said she had heard him come out of. Next, I closed her closet door and grabbed a rug and some towels and stuffed them under her closet door he couldn't get out. I told my Mom to call our Pest Control company and to try and have someone come and get rid of our two trapped rats. I left my BB gun with my Mom, showed her how to use it, and then I went back to bed. Half an hour later, Mom was shrieking again. The rat had pushed the rug back out from under the door and had poked his head through, and, as my Mom told my sister later that morning: "he was looking right at me!". My Mom was still laying upright in her bed, and had apparently been staring at the closet door the whole time I was in bed. She had tried to fire the BB gun, but never took the safety off. I went to the door, with BB gun and brick in hand and waited for him to poke his head out one more time. He did not. Eventually, I pushed open her closet door, slowly, hoping he'd run back in there. He did not. Then I had an idea. The vacuum cleaner was laying right beside me. I had my Mom plug it in and I turned it on. I was planning on sucking the rat into the opening of the vacuum, which should hold him securely, and then I'd take him into my Mom's shower stall to execute him with the BB gun and/or brick. Instead, the vacuum scared him into running back into the closet. I could see him run between two suitcases in there. He had a black tail.   Was this the same rat from the kitchen?  I had certainly hoped so. The thought of a single rat in the house gave me the willies, but to have two?  In one night? The word "infestation" came to mind. "Please, let this be the same rat", I said to myself. I closed off my Mother's closet door just like before and went looking for something to better secure it. I found some wood and placed it on top of the rug that was jammed under her closet door, hoping this would weight the rug down, making it impossible for the rat to push it out. I laid my trusty brick down on it too. Then I went back to bed.  Ten minutes later, my Mother began yelling "Shoo! Shoo!", and I was soon back in my her room, chasing the rat back into her closet. She had taken a shot at it with my BB gun and had missed.  It was now about 3:45 am and there was no way I was going to be able to get up for work in the morning now, especially if I was going to have to keep getting on out of bed to shepherd this stupid rat back into my Mom's closet. I got serious: I got the duct-tape. I took the rug out from under the door and tossed it, then I duct-taped the large piece of wood to the bottom of the door and to the carpet in front of the door. There was still a gap, so I duct-taped the brick to the door to fill it. There was no way that rat bastard was getting through this unless he was Mighty Mouse himself. I asked my Mom to call my work and let them know I wouldn't be going in (I knew she'd be up all day) and then I went back to bed...again. I couldn't sleep very well, I kept anticipating more screams from my Mother, and also the noises that would be normal in the house on any other night, were now accompanied with mental images of rats making these noises. I decided to read to take my mind off of everything, and read I did. The sun was shining through my window as I had finished the book and soon after that, I finally fell asleep. I slept for about 4 or 5 hours and got up after noon. My Mom was out in the living room, sitting in a chair in the corner of the room with her legs up on a footstool, with a broom at arm's length. She wasn't taking any chances. She had not slept. I went back and checked her closet door; the rat had not gotten out. She said the rat quit trying to get out sometime around 5:00 am. She thinks that was when he got tired and went to sleep. She also thought she heard a trap go off, but isn't really sure. I asked about the one in the kitchen and she thinks she heard something, but again, she wasn't sure what it was she heard. Our Pest Control company is due out anytime, so I'm content not to have to be the one to open my Mom's closet door or the doors under the kitchen counter. If there  are  dead rats under the sink or in my mom's closet, Pest Control can dispose of them. And if there are two live rats in either location, then Pest Control can contend with them. After the rats have been dealt with and Pest Control has left, I will seal off that hole in the floor. I may also be ready to get a new cat soon. There's no way to replace my departed feline friend, but it'd be nice to have another cat around, if for no other reason than to say to the mice and rats and whatnot: "not in my house, you suckers".

        Conan O'Brien Is A Funny, Funny Man   I've watched "Late Night With Conan O'Brien" since Day One (though less frequently lately due to my job), and he has never failed to make me laugh. His show features some of the most original and risk-taking comedy ever to appear on Network Television. Conan was also a writer on two more of my favorite TV shows: "The Simpsons" and "Saturday Night Live". So when I say that Conan O'Brien is a funny, funny man, it is not unfounded. As further proof that the man measures very, very high on the Comedy-O-Meter, I have supplied a link to the text of his address to the graduating Harvard Class Of 2000. This is one of the funniest things I have ever read, ranking right up there with the writings of both Groucho Marx and Woody Allen. This is pure Conan, on his own and without a safety net, just a man and his words. Funny, funny words. If you like to laugh (and who doesn't?), then click  urlLink here  and you will. For as I have said before: Conan O'Brien is a funny, funny man.

        All Alone In A Crowded Room   Tonight, I went to a party and was miserable. Almost as soon as I arrived, I was ready to call it a night. It was, by any standard, a great party. They had a nice buffet, free beer and sodas, and my friend's band played live for everyone. They had a professional DJ there as well, and a dance floor to dance on. It should've been a great night, and I'd be willing to bet, that for almost everyone else there, it was. But for me, the party was akin to a slow, agonizing death. I looked around the room tonight and I saw other folks having fun and enjoying themselves; drinking, dancing, laughing, etc... and I felt so distant from them all, removed, completely detached from everyone else. It was if I was on the outside looking in, yet again.   I don't know what it is with me, but I rarely enjoy parties. I know that I'm extremely self-concious, and being in a crowded room only amplifies that feeling, but that wasn't the problem tonight. I don't think it's that I'm anti-social either. I know I may seem awkward and shy at first, but once you get to know me, you'll find that I'm a real pain in the ass; a real  fun  pain in the ass. Perhaps it's just that I'm not comfortable in that kind of setting; I prefer a more casual, more intimate setting. I'd much rather talk and joke with friends than dance with them, I'd much rather wear a T-shirt and shorts than a dress shirt and slacks, and I'd much rather play in a band than watch one. In other words: I'd rather have been doing something else, somewhere else, than doing what I was, then.   So that was my night, once again, all alone in a crowded room.

        Procrastination 101   I have a ton of work to do and it all has to be done by 3pm tomorrow. So far, I've done NOTHING. Instead of doing what needs to be done, I've Instant Messaged with a friend, played around on the computer, watched TV (NBA playoffs: half of the Nets/Celtics game, all of the Kings/Lakers), talked to my sister on the phone, ate 2 oranges, played around on the computer some more, and am currently doing this. I am the Master of Procrastination, the King of Goofing Off, and the Lord Almighty of Laziness. So now, I'm off to do what I should've been doing all along. I will have to stay up very, very late to accomplish the things I need to do, and in all honesty, I will probably have to finish tomorrow what I can't tonight. I either rule or I suck (I'm not sure which). I guess I'll have to think about that... ummm... later.   The Master has spoken.

        This week I've been...    Listening to : I have Miles Davis' " urlLink Kind Of Blue " in the CD player again. I had been playing Jimi Hendrix's " urlLink Electric Ladyland ", " urlLink Axis:Bold As Love ", and  urlLink "First Rays Of The New Rising Sun " when my nephew was down.   Playing : Playing Dr.Mario off and on... still. I have a few other games, but they all suck. I'm not a big video game person, so I'm fairly content with just playing Dr.Mario. It's just for relaxation anyway, not a hobby.    Reading : Nothing at the moment. I've been dying to start on the Sherlock Holmes book that I mentioned before, but just haven't gotten to it.    Watching on TV : I've been watching "Whose Line Is It Anyway?" regularly, and Howard Stern on and off. Stern's been boring lately. I don't like the shows where he has phony, silicon-enhanced women on just to gawk at them. I like him better when he's joking with his crew and with his " urlLink Wack Pack ". It reminds me of when me and my friends would hang out (when we were teenagers) and just crack on each other mercilessly. I've also been watching " urlLink Dennis Miller Live !" weekly, and the " urlLink Curb Your Enthusiasm " reruns that HBO has been showing.    Downloading : Well, I somehow blew seeing "Star Wars Episode 3: Attack Of The Clones" in the theater, so I'm downloading it now. I can't believe I missed it. I've seen every one of them, from the original one to the last one, in theaters. Maybe it'll return somewhere around here one more time before it's gone for good, I really want to see it on the big screen.    Eating : I got back on my diet, but my Mom and one of my managers at work have convinced me to abandon it. They said eating one meal a day wasn't very good for me, and besides, I really couldn't see that I was losing anything. Back to the drawing board.   Feeling : Tense.

        Smoked Out   I work part-time at a Wendys restaurant. I do that so I can have some steady income, since my online auction money comes in when it comes in, and also because they have extremely flexible hours. It's just a little nothing job: little pay, but also very little stress or responsibility either. Today, however, I almost walked out.   When I got into work today, I found a really surreal scene: smoke heavy in the air, people coughing and gagging, yet still working as they normally would. The hoods over the fryer and grills, which would normally pull the smoke out of the kitchen, were not working. I didn't find out til later that they had not been working since Saturday afternoon. Had I know that, I would have walked out right then. I could barely catch my breath, I was coughing uncontrollably, and I felt like I was choking on toxic fumes or something. My lungs aren't the in the best shape anyway; about a year and a half ago I had a flu that did some damage to my lungs. I just stopped wheezing earlier this year. As I write this, my diaphragm and my throat are sore from coughing, and I am wheezing heavily. I am not happy. What really pisses me off, is that it could have been prevented.   The other managers told me that our Store Manager was being cheap; he didn't want to spend the money to have someone come out and fix the hoods immediately, so he scheduled someone to come out tomorrow to work on them. We are shorthanded at work as it is, we have six people less than what we should have, so he's already saving a ton of money on labor. The money was there to remedy the problem and he opted instead to have everyone to suffer just so he could save even more. To put us into a situation like the one we faced today is totally inexcusable and unforgivable. He's done other highly questionable things before that all stem from his cheapness, but this was the last straw for me: I am ready to quit. In fact, I just called in sick for tomorrow (Tuesday) and I am going to start looking for a new job.

        Wiped Out   I woke up thinking I had slept in too late, til 5:00pm or something, but it was only a little after Noon. I had barely slept again. It was storming outside, so I did what any reasonable person would do: I woke my nephew up and dragged him outside into the rain. We wound up having a mud pie fight (Jess got a lucky shot off on me: right in the face!) and then we played Frisbee for a bit after the rain stopped. We jumped in the shower together, fully clothed, and rinsed the mud off our clothes in there. I cooked lunch for us after that. I made Chicken Cordon Bleu with Ramen noodles. Chef Gary! I was pretty beat by then, so I rested on the couch while Jess did  urlLink his Blog  for yesterday and listened to the '80's metal I downloaded last night. After he finished, I played with him on the PC awhile, making our own art using  urlLink Lite Brite  first, then Windows Paint. When we got bored with that, I tried playing Dr.Mario, mainly for an excuse to lay down in bed, but Jess was bored and wouldn't let me play/rest in peace. After a bit though, my Mom said it was time to take him home so we packed up his stuff and they split. I was relieved that I was free to rest, but at the same time, sad that he was leaving. He behaved better this weekend than he ever had before and we had a better time because of that. After he left, I goofed off on the PC, downloading AC/DC videos and rare songs that feature Bon Scott. That's about it for my night. I need to do laundry still, but after that: BEDTIME!!!

        Catching Up   I can't believe it's been almost a whole week since my last entry, but indeed it has been. Here's what I've been up to all week:   Monday & Tuesday : Well, the first half of the week I really did very little of interest. I worked my usual schedule, then when I got home, I ate, then played Dr.Mario in my room while listening to Miles Davis' " urlLink Kind Of Blue " CD and cassette tapes of my own demos. After that, I'd goof around on the PC for a bit and eventually hit the sack, playing Dr.Mario until I was tired enought to sleep. That's about it. Sad, really.    Wednesday : As usual, I was off. I ordered Buenos Nachos from Bradford for lunch and worked on sorting cards at night. I was supposed to rehearse with John Paul, but he never showed...that's twice now. Never called either. I called him later at night and he said he had to work late again, that's why he didn't come over. A call would have been nice. I had been playing guitar and listening to demo tapes on and off for several weeks getting ready for him. Very disappointing.    Thursday : Thursday was a lot like Monday and Tuesday. When I was goofing around on the PC, I downloaded AOL Messenger so I could talk to Billy about me coming up to Georgia to help him record. It looks like that trip may not happen now. Details at a later date.   Friday : Ah! Finally something of interest! My older nephew, Jesse, came down. My Mom went to pick him up while I was working, and shortly after I got home and showered, the three of us were together and chowing on Sonny's for dinner. Sweet! We were stuffed! Me and Jess went to my room and played Dr.Mario and listened to Jimi Hendrix CD's for awhile. I grabbed a Hendrix video, and a Stevie Ray Vaughan video as well, and played a little of each for him. He liked the playing-with-the-teeth, playing-behind-the-back, playing-between-the-legs, and the other cool moves that both guitarists utilized. After that, we went outside and threw the Frisbee for a bit. It was after 11:00pm when I decided to take Jess for a walk. We walked about a half a mile over to Walgreens and we played in their drainage ditch. Huh? You played in a ditch at eleven o'clock at night? Yes, that is correct. I showed him a few kid things that I remembered from when I was a young-un including how to make a whip out of certain long weeds (perfect for chopping down other tall weeds) as well as the beauty of  urlLink cattails . When I was a kid, I used to love those things. When they are just the right age and get really soft, you can hit them and make them explode into a dandelion-like snowstorm. Just like I thought, he loved them! He had so much cattail fluff flying that it looked like it was snowing! When we walked around the building heading to Dunkin' Donuts, the fluff was even flying in the front of the building as well! It was great! Anyway, as I said, we went over to Dunkin' Donuts and I got us some milk and donuts. After eating there, we went into Walgreens and looked around (I had a few dollars burning a hole in my pocket) but saw nothing of interest. Bought an Arizona Green Iced Tea and headed on home. We got back around 1:30 am and I helped him write  urlLink his Blog . After that, we went on to bed. He crashed immediately, I played Dr.Mario, tried to sleep, but mostly tossed and turned all night.   Saturday : I woke up around Noon, got out of bed a half hour later. I'd hardly slept. It was raining hard and had been thundering and lightning for a while. Jess was still crashed. Eventually, I got him up (by blasting Hendrix's "EXP" at an excessive volume), and the three of us went to a thrift store in Pinellas Park (the one me and Mom just missed last weekend). It was no big whoop. I bought a cassette tape rack there for $3 and Jess got a Sherlock Holmes book ("The Hound Of The Baskervilles") for a quarter. Mom bought a bunch of toys for his little brother too. She dropped me and Jess off at a different thrift store in St.Pete and we looked around there for a bit (Jess got a nice red and white button-up shirt for $2) and then we walked over to Marbos, a chinese restaurant, and chowed down on their buffet. We were stuffed yet again! We walked over to Wonderwater next and we bought a few football and basketball  cards in the 3/$1 bin. I found some of those Little Tite snap-tights that I'd been looking for for months now and they were on sale 5/$1, a great price! I bought 28 of them! I wished I could've gotten more, but they had no more. We went over to K-Mart next and we bought several boxes of basketball cards, some for me and some for him. We took the bus home from there. When we got home, we opened cards and we traded some with each other; no big pulls, but it was the most fun I ever had opening packs of cards. We should do that more often. After a bit, Mom droves us around looking for more cattails, but all the ones we found weren't quite ready yet. We ended up over at Walgreens drainage ditch again. Jess had a field day. Mom let us use her cane to whack them and we had the fluff flying everywhere! He did all that he could reach, so we went to Checkers, grabbed some chow, and headed on home again. It had been a good day and it was turning into a pretty nice evening too. I was laying in bed playing Dr.Mario and Jess was laying on the sleeping bag I laid out for him listening to a Hendrix CD when all hell suddenly broke loose. I was playing my stereo louder than usual since Mom was out in the kitchen, but she had gone to her room, unbeknownst to me, and wanted the stereo turned down. So, did she walk the entire 15 feet from her room to mine and politely ask me to turn it down? Hell no. She decided that the best way to handle the problem was to behave like a child. Our contentment was shattered by sudden screaming and pounding on my bedroom wall and by the crashing of my cassette tape collection falling from the shelf on the wall where she was pounding. Really tactful woman, she, totally irrational. I was in disbelief and I was furious. How uncivil an act was that? If I thought her TV was too loud, I wouldn't have gone to her room screaming and knocking her videos to the floor, that's aggressive behavior. If a man had done that to me, blows would have been exchanged. I told her never to do that again and she told me I could move out anytime. I see. So, apparently, it's okay for her to bully me and destroy my property simply because it's her house. That is some fucked up reasoning there. The whole thing left me shook up and I zoned out for a while. Meanwhile, Jess was hoping I'd do something fun with him. I finally hooked him up with the  urlLink Mini-Mizer  and he did that for a while, then we listened to music on the PC together. I downloaded a lot of '80's metal bands like Dio, Judas Priest, AC/DC, Dokken, etc.., and he enjoyed a lot of that. I also downloaded some videos of KISS (he really liked Gene Simmons), AC/DC, Ozzy (with Randy Rhoads), and Dio. We played Frisbee a bit while the videos downloaded. We were both exausted so we hit the sack. Jess read a little more from the Sherlock Holmes book until he fell asleep, and I played Dr.Mario up until about an hour ago when I decided to get up and write all of this. I am extremely tired, but I'm in that crazy zone where I'm feeling just too tired to sleep. My eyes are bloodshot, my feet and legs are sore, and I really should be in bed sleeping; but my mind is wide awake. I guess I'd better go and try anyway.

        This week I've been...     Listening to : I threw on a CD (disc 2) from Jimi Hendrix's  urlLink Experience Box set  and have played that a couple of times in the last few days. That's about all I've realy listened to the last few days.    Playing : "Dr.Mario"...still.   Reading : I had been reading that Tim Allen book, but now I'm done and will be starting a new one. I'm really leaning towards the Sherlock Holmes book I picked up at Goodwill a week or so ago which contains "A Study In Scarlett" and The Hound Of The Baskervilles".   Watching on TV : I've barely watched TV on all weekend. Tonight, I had the picture on, but the sound off.    Downloading : My local newspaper did a story on newer bands that have an older feel to them, so I downloaded a ton of stuff from these bands to check them out (the beauty of filesharing). I really liked what I heard from  urlLink The White Stripes  a lot and will be buying all three of their CDs eventually. Just a guy on guitar and a girl on drums, but they have a big sound. Great stuff! Black Rebel Motorcycle Club was also really, really good too. From their name, I was excpecting something really hard and heavy metal, but it wasn't at all, in fact, some of their stuff was very acoustic and even Doors-y. The Vines were decent, as was Mars Volta. The Hives were ok, I liked some of their stuff. And You Will Know Us By The Trail Of Dead was alright too, but their ridiculously long name won't help their popularity much. It was nice to hear some new music, it was even nicer finding some that doesn't suck, and it's nice to know that, somwhere out there, Rock & Roll is still alive and kicking.    Eating : Don't ask. Terrible week for me dietwise. I'm still doing better than I was a year ago, but not as well as I was doing a month ago.   Feeling : Very uneasy about my future. Everything is a mess.

        Return Of The Blahs   I stayed up late playing Dr.Mario again; yet another case of being too tired to sleep. Blah. Finally, after awhile (probably around 4:00am), I was tired enough to sleep. I woke up with a strong feeling that I'd overslept, but when I looked at the clock it was only 9:45am. Nice. Blah. I went back to sleep, and then, after what seemed like only 10 minutes later, woke up again. It was 12:45pm. Blah.  Time and I just don't get along, and it's getting worse the older I get.  I got up, tunrned on the PC, and showed my Mom some cool stuff I'd found while surfing the net the night before, all of which I found on  urlLink Dre's List-O-Links .  The neatest site I'd found was one that let you  urlLink create your own plastic toy . I made some of various family members. The one I made of Mom really looked like her too! I can't wait to show this to my nephews, I think they'll enjoy this one and the  urlLink Lite Brite  one a lot. My personal favorite:  urlLink The Farting Dough Boy . If you know me, you'll understand. I also got a kick out of  urlLink Jesus Christ Superstore , which features action figures of famous religious figures (they all come with some kind of machine gun!). These have to be seen to be fully appreciated!  So, I showed Mom these various websites I found, then I readied my eBay mailings, and then I cooked two big Porterhouse Steaks for Mom and I. They were good, but I wish I had a barbecue grill to cook them on, they would've kicked about 25% more ass that way. We went to the Post Office and were heading out to hit this thrift store near Parkside Mall, but when we got there it was closing. I didn't feel much like being outside as it was so damned hot out (plus I was feeling Blah), so we went back home, where I played Dr.Mario for a couple hours. After that, I played around on th PC for a bit then decided to hit the sack early. I grabbed the book I'd been reading (mainly in the bathroom up til then), Tim Allen's " urlLink Don't Stand Too Close To A Naked Man ", and went to bed with it. I finished the entire book. The book, by the way, is pretty funny (laugh-out-loud funny in some parts) and pretty darn insightful. The writing is a bit schizophrenic though, jumping from one thing to another without much of a link between, but it's still a worthwhile read.  So now it's about 2:40 am, and I guess I'm heading back to bed, Still feeling a bit Blah, but hopefully I'll be better after  a good night's sleep .  Yeah, right.

        Grumble   I slept like crap last night...again. I may have gotten only 2 or 3 hours of sleep again (if that), then went on to have a very rough day at work (we are extremely short-handed right now with five people having quit this week). After work, I find out that my Mom and sister never worked anything out about my nephew coming down. I was expecting my Mom to have him at our home when I got off work (she was off all day today). That didn't happen. I was none too happy about it either, especially since we told him he could come down this weekend and he seemed to be looking forward to it a great deal. I know I was. As it turns out, he has to be up there for football tryouts or something at 9am tomorrow. I just can't understand why my sister couldn't have called and let me know that as soon as she knew that (she said she found out about it earlier in the week). Very inconsiderate. I wouldn't have minded the change of plans so much had she let me know that there was going to be a change of plans before  the very night I expected him down . Heck, the way I've slept the last two nights it would have almost been a relief (I really don't have enough energy right now). Right now, I'm pretty disappointed and very, very tired.

        Wednesday/Thursday   My friend John Paul was supposed to come over tonight to learn some of my songs (so he'd be rehearsed a little for when we jam with his drummer in a couple of weeks) but he never made it over (got stuck working OT at work). I was really, really looking forward to jamming tonight. Hell, I barely slept last night, I was so psyched about it. I played guitar in bed for a long time and had to get up and record a new idea as well. I had music going through my head everytime I tried to clear my mind. Anyway, he said we can do it next week. I hope so, because he's going to need to learn some of my stuff  before  we jam with his drummer, because he's not much of an improviser and a lot of my newer material is heavy on riffs, so it won't be just leaning which root notes to play.   Speaking about not sleeping last night, I think I may have gotten only about two or three hours of sleep in total (if that). I stayed up way too late reading certain  urlLink transcripts of the O.J. Simpson trial , the ones pertaining to the jury itself, hoping to find some insight into the reasoning behiond the jury's verdict in the case. I didn't find a clear-cut reason for it, but I found a lot of pettiness, ignorance, pig-headedness, bullying, childish behavior, whining, and racism among the jury members themselves. Not all of them, of course, and not even the majority of them, but among many of them. Even Judge Ito stated, during the trial, that these people were behaving "like children". I understand that it was an extremely long and stressful trial, but some of the things these people did and said to each other and to the deputies working with them, were just plain ignorant.  I also found it baffling that one of the good jurors was dismissed because someone sent the judge a letter saying that the juror was trying to sell her story to a book publisher and the judge  never took the time to investigate the accusation before dismissing her . She was one of the few white jurors on the jury, and she later stated that, after hearing the evidence she heard, she would have voted "guilty" even if that meant a "hung jury". This one dismissal changed everything, and it appears to me to be a case of jury tampering (the prosecution certainly thought so). The juror denied the story and has never written any book, unlike several other jury members who remained on the jury. It was a disgraceful trial in almost every aspect.  Tonight (almost all night long ...again), I read transcripts of some of the sidebars that we never got to hear on TV. Man! Lawyers can be vicious!  My nephew (the older one) is due down tomorrow. He's going to spend the night, maybe overnight on Saturday too. We'll do some cool stuff on Saturday for sure and we'' play outside a lot tomorrow night too, I am sure as well. I should probably rest up so he doesn't wear me out. Ok... BEDTIME!!

        This week I've been...    Listening to : Still have one of the Hendrix at Winterland bootlegs in my CD player. Played a few cassette tapes in the last two days too: Bill Cosby " urlLink Himself " and Steve Vai " urlLink Passion & Warfare " (paid .50 for each at Goodwill). One of Cosby's finest performances. The Steve Vai tape was interesting, but just not the kind of music I can get into at all. He's technically brilliant, but he lacks the soul I like in my music. I also listened to a bit of Maria McKee's " urlLink You Gotta Sin To Get Saved " which is an awesome album. A whole lotta soul in that girl, and as an added bonus, her backing band on this album was  urlLink The Jayhawks , one of my favorite bands. Unfortunately, the tape hasn't held up well over the years and is now fluttering a bit. Time to hunt down the CD!  Another tape I put in (that I also need to find on CD ) is Patti Scialfa's " urlLink Rumble Doll ". Patti sang with Bruce Springsteen for years (now she's married to him too) and she put out one solo album, this one, and I love it! She has a really unique voice, very reminiscent of Ronnie Spector.    Playing : Still playing a lot of "Dr.Mario"...will I ever tire of it? Yes. But probably not for a while.    Reading : Most of the way through Christopher Darden's "In Contempt". Just got to the section where they start the trial. I thought Johnnie Cochran was a lying weasel before ever reading this book and it turns out that I was correct in my thinking. What an asshole.   Watching on TV : Hmmm, what have I been watching? Well, not a whole lot. CNN mostly. At night, I've had Howard Stern on, among other shows, but I haven't sat down and watched any of it. It's all background noise while I'm at the computer.   Downloading : Oh, I did download a TV show off of Kazaalite and watch it. It was an old episode of " urlLink The Young Ones ", one of my favorite British comedies ever. This episode was "Demolition". I really love that show! I should see if it's out on DVD. If it is, then I'll need to buy me a DVD player so I can watch it.    Eating : I asked Mom to pick up some Moosetracks ice cream for me and she did. What was she thinking!?!? I know, I know... I shouldn't have asked in the first place, but I did. I'm an idiot sometimes. So... my diet this week is pretty much shot.     Feeling : pretty good, regardless.

        Lazy Sunday   Lazy, indeed. I slept, or more accurately, stayed in bed, until 4:00 pm. I got up with a sore back, most likely due to how I was positioned in bed playing Dr.Mario the night before. I went to put my PC on and get online, but found that my modem was not connecting. I unplugged it and let it sit before re-trying it, but it didn't fix the problem like it usually does. I gave up and decided to eat lunch/dinner. My Mom brought home Publix lemon herb chicken (blah, had it twice this week) but she also picked up two sides from Popeye's Chicken: rice & beans and their mashed potatoes & gravy. They ruled! After chowing, I went back to bed and played Dr.Mario for a while (yes, I'm a slug). Eventually I got bored and started reading "In Contempt" again.  Later at night, I went out to check the PC again (Sunday is my eBay listing day) but it was still not connecting. I called Verizon, my cable modem company, twice, but got absolutely no help from them. I am not real happy with those folks. I'm supposed to have broadband, but when I try to open videos on websites (like on comedycentral.com), I have to chose the 56k connection rather than the broadband connection or else it won't play right. For $42 a month, broadband had better be broadband. I'm considering trying DSL or else going with Roadrunner. Anyhow, it wasn't until about 10:30 that my connection started working again, too late to list any auctions tonight. I'm not real happy about that either, that money helps out a lot.  So now it's 11:30pm and I'm getting ready to do my laundry. Pretty boring day.

        Saturday   So... as tired as I was last night, I somehow managed to get only 5 or 6 hours sleep. I stayed up too late (somewhere around 6am) playing Dr.Mario again so I figured I'd just sleep late and put my Post Office stuff off til Monday. Instead, I got up around Noon, did all of my mail work as soon as I got up, went to the Post Office a little earlier than usual, and then headed up to my sister's house with Mom.  The rain wasn't bad at all on the drive up, so we stopped at two Salvation Army stores along the way. I picked up a Bill Cosby's "Himself" cassette (in awesome condition) and five paperback books including "Lord Of Flies" (I read this back in middle school and wanted a refresher), "Macbeth" (it's one of the New Folger Library versions, which I really like), Tim Allen's book "Don't Stand Too Close To A Naked Man", and two others in a cosmic vein: Carl Sagan's "The Cosmic Connection" and Arthur C. Clarke's "The Promise Of Space". Not too shabby for a grand total of $3.00. When we got to my sister's house, only my older nephew was home. The others, minus my niece (who was staying at a friend's overnight) got home shortly after. I did a few things on my niece's PC with my nephew (I started a blog for him), but a friend of his came over and he disappeared into his room pretty much the whole night long (playing video games). I didn't do much with my younger nephew either. He was occupied with catching bugs outside most of the time, then later, with watching his brother play video games. With the two boys off doing whatever, I worked on my niece's computer pretty much the whole time I was there.  That thing was a mess! I had a lot of work to do in order to get it running well again. For one thing, she had no anti-virus protection on it and hadn't for months. I downloaded a free one for her and it said there were 76 virus/virus mutations on her PC. They're gone now. I downloaded the updated version of Explorer and a bunch of Windows updates for her. I downloaded Window Washer for her too, which cleaned up an enormous amount of space on her hard drive. I ran Scandisk and it found errors on her hard drive that it corrected. I defragged her PC last. It seems to be running OK now. I probably should have let her continue suffering with the damn thing though, since she doien't do what I tell her to do with it. I set it up to run Scandisk and defrag and other programs every Sunday night, all she has to do is leave her computer on, yet, she never does. If I'm the King of Procrastination, she's the Queen of Lazy. We wound up leaving around 10:30pm, after I got a haircut from my sister (shaved almost completely bald). It rained a little on the way home, but not too bad. We stopped at McDonald's for fruit parfaits, but they ran out, so we had hot fudge sundaes instead. Earlier, we had Steak & Cheese subs from Publix, which weren't bad.  I'm glad we went up there, even though I didn't get to do too much with the kids (I played with their cats and dogs more than them), it was a nice change of pace nonetheless.

        Tired   Weird past couple days for me. I've been staying up until 4:00-4:30 am reading "Chickenhawk" and then sleeping terribly the rest of the night. Been going into work with barely any sleep, then feeling nauseous at work from the lack of sleep from lack of food (I don't eat before work). I guess I need to cut that late, late shit out on nights where I work the next day.  Anyway, I finished the book and have started a new one: Chris Darden's " urlLink In Contempt ". For those who don't know, he was one of O.J. Simpson's prosecutors. Should be an interesting read.  Haven't been doing much else all week. TV watching is at a minimum, been playing some Dr.Mario still while listening to Hendrix or my own demo tapes (trying to develope more song ideas). Tonight I downloaded a bunch of crank calls from "Crank Yankers". The ones with  urlLink Tracy Morgan  (from SNL) and  urlLink Wanda Sykes  have been the funniest! Wanda Sykes especially ("there's a turd in my car!"). I loved her last season on "Curb Your Enthusiasm" too (when everyone thought Larry had an ass fetish!) and on the Chris Rock Show. Funny lady! No big plans for the weekend, probably just going to chill. I don't get paid until Monday, so without funds I'm pretty much grounded. That's cool though, I don't feel much like doing anything anyway, other than catching up on some sleep.

        "The Royal Tenenbaums"   I'd been wanting to see this movie for awhile, so on Monday (I didn't go to work that day), I downloaded and watched it. I was expecting a hilarious farce but I found something much more sublime. It features a unique brand of storytelling, clever writing with subtle, character-based humor, and fine acting performances throughout. This is the story of a father's redemption, but it's much more than that. The three Tenenbaum children are all geniuses, child prodigies, but none have been able to figure out one simple thing: how to be happy. They are all unique, yet they are all suffering. Only the mother seemed to be happy, especially in her work, but as she admits to her new suitor, she hasn't been with a man for a long, long time. None of the characters are one-dimensional, which is refreshing. Also, you never quite know where the movie is heading, just like life itself. I'd definitely recommend this one to most people.

        This week I've been...    Listening to: Jimi Hendrix at the Winterland Ballroom, San Francisco, California, from 1968. He did 6 six shows in three nights there on October 11th-13th, and I've been listening to the official release (long out-of-print), " urlLink Live At Winterland ", which features performances culled from all three nights. I also have  urlLink 3 bootleg CD's  that feature almost all the shows in their entirety and have been listening to that as well. I've also been playing some of the tapes I made of myself (rough ideas and whatnot) and am trying to get some material ready to jam with my friend, John, and his drummer, Jimmy, in a few weeks.   Playing: Still playing a lot of "Dr.Mario". I'm officially addicted.   Reading: Nothing at the moment. I'm going to start a new one tonight or tomorrow, probably "Chickenhawk".  Watching on TV: I have "South Park" on ("Insomniac with Dave Attel" comes on after it), but am not really watching it. I haven't watched TV much this weekend.   Downloading: I downloaded a bunch of Stranger songs, but it's not as good as I thought they might be (going by the show I saw on friday). The Stranger songs I heard performed live by  urlLink Damn The Torpedoes  (their lead singer is the singer from Stranger) sounded way better than what Stranger actually recorded. Live, the songs rocked hard, but the Stranger originals are often a bit too cheesy for my taste (especially the keyboard parts).  Eating: It's been a rocky week for my diet. I haven't went nuts or anything, just had a couple naughty days. I will get back on track again starting tomorrow.   Feeling: A'ight.

        Friday/Saturday   I've been having a pretty cool weekend! Friday night I went out to Gasoline Alley to watch my friend's band, Blue Condition, play. My friend Sue picked me up and I hung out at her place for awhile before heading over there. Sue and I started drinking Bourbon & Cokes almost as soon as we got there! I had 4 of them, but somehow managed not to get hammered (I rarely drink, so it doesn't take much anymore). My friend's band put on a fun show, but they had problems (mainly with the sound guy) and their set came out very uneven. The band that followed them was great though. They're called  urlLink Damn The Torpedoes , and are made up of guys from several prominent local bands (Stranger, Foreign Legion, the Bobby Friss Band). They ROCKED. The whole band was solid, they were great! I was impressed with the lead singer a lot (the guy from Stranger), especially the way he worked the crowd, but as we were leaving, more than halfway through their set (it was about 1:15am and Sue had to be up for work at 5am), the singer said something like "what, you're not going to say goodbye?" and gave me a strange look. It took me a moment to realize that everyone in the place was looking at me and laughing at me. That really pissed me off. He didn't have to do that. It had been a totally enjoyable night up until then.   Saturday, I did my usual Post Office run and went to Goodwill stores with Mom. The first one was a new store and it kind of sucked ass. I only found one book I thought looked interesting. it's called "Chickenhawk" and was written by a Vietnam War helicopter pilot. My Dad fought in the 1st Cavalry Division in Vietnam,  which relied greatly on helicopters, so I thought it'd be an interesting read for me. The other Goodwill we went to was much better. I picked up a few paperbacks (including Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein"), but the hardbacks are where I really scored big. I normally don't buy hardbacks because 1) I'm a cheap ass and paperbacks are cheaper, and 2) If I buy a hardcover book, I want it to be in perfect condition (for my permanent library), and since most that I find in Goodwills aren't in top condition, I pass on them. But they had a great sale on hardcover books that day, 4 for $1, so I went nuts on them. I bought 3 Stephen King books (It, The Dark Half, Four Past Midnight), an awesome book on Venice (filled with a ton of photos of locales and Venician artwork with complete descriptions of everything), a beautiful Reader's Digest series of classic books (the books are in gorgeous condition) including books by Nathaniel Hawthorne, Jules Verne, Rudyard Kipling, and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, among others. The prize of the Reader's Digest series for me is the Conan Doyle one which contains both  "A Study In Scarlett" and "The Hound Of The Baskervilles", neither of which I've read before and both of which I've been jonesing to read. I also picked up some books that I probably would not have picked up had they not been just a quarter each, like Christopher Darden's book (one of the O.J. Simpson prosecutors), Magic Johnson's autobiography, and Bill Cosby's "Fatherhood". I picked up an Anne Riice book too (I'd been wanting to read some of her stuff for awhile), but it looks like a dog tried to eat it! I figured for a quarter, I'll take it anyway. I got around 21-22 books in all and it cost me just a little over $8.00 for everything. You can't beat that! I'll be set with reading material for a while!

        Quicktime   Man! This week is whizzing by! Where has the time gone? I know I spent a lot time downloading music last night, and I spent most of tonight Instant Messaging and filesharing with my friend Sue; I guess that's two whole evenings right there. Eh, at least it was time well spent and enjoyed. I have also been playing  a lot  of Dr.Mario lately, a little too much time spent there actually (that shit's addictive). I have a lot of cool things on my plate this weekend though. I'm planning on seeing "Star Wars: Attack Of The Clones" on Saturday (finally!), and may be heading over to a friends tomorrow and then going out to see another friend's band playing live (Blue Condition at Gasoline Alley, Clearwater, Florida at 9:30pm). I also want to go book hunting at a few Goodwill stores this weekend too.  Should be a fun weekend!   *****************************************************************************  Oh, and happy 4th Of July to everyone! You know, no matter how many problems we have, no matter how much we bitch and complain about it, the United States Of America is still the greatest country on the face of the Earth.  Freedom, baby, there is no substitute.

       This week I've been...   Listening to: Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock, 1969. I have 3 different CD's of this performance ( urlLink 1 official release , 1 official release that's out of print, and  urlLink 1 bootleg ) and have been listening to all three of them. I've also had  urlLink Donovan  and  urlLink Howlin' Wolf  on the CD player as well.  Playing: Still playing a lot of "Dr.Mario", nothing's changed there.   Reading: Nothing at the moment. I'm having trouble deciding what to read next. I've got a lot of unread books, but nothing I'm really dying to read right now. I really want to read some more Vonnegut and Sherlock Holmes books, so I may be heading to the library this weekend unless I find something good at Goodwill.  Watching on TV: Not watching much of anything lately. I watched " urlLink Insomniac " ( urlLink Dave Attell  is great) last night, and that's about it. "Politically Incorrect" ran it's last new show on Friday (unjustly cancelled), so hopefully they'll rerun some of the older ones before disappearing altogether. I'm really going to miss that show (as I ranted in a previous blog).   Downloading: A bunch of stuff!! I finally reloaded Kazaalite so I've been downloading a lot of my current favs (Tenacious D, Dio) as well as stuff I absolutely must have around (Eddie Izzard). I also downloaded the brand new Los Lobos CD (" urlLink Good Morning Aztlan "), but haven't heard it all the way through yet. I need to take a trip to Circuit City or Best Buy soon and pick up some of these CD's, especially The D and the new Wilco CD.  Smiling: I got my niece started on her own blog two weeks ago, but she never added anything to it. That changed on Saturday! I checked her page, and to my surprise, found that she finally made an entry on her own! I can't explain why, but that makes me very happy.  Eating: Back on track with the diet again. Haven't been eating apples much though. Not much of anything at all, really, mostly drinking Iced Tea (sweetened with Equal).  Feeling: Feeling okay: a little up, a little down, but always with a strong undercurrent of doom, probably due, in some part, to the warnings of possible terrorist attacks on the upcoming 4th of July holiday.

        Labor Day Weekend: Friday   I had a short day at work and have been playing around on the computer since 3pm. I downloaded most of the new Rush CD, I liked what I heard, but they just aren't writing at the same level as they did in '80's. Also on a music related note, my friend Sue just told me that Los Lobos is coming back here on November 6th! I know where I'll be that day! Woo! Hoo! I'm very excited about that. It sounds like I'll see a bunch of my friends there too, it's going to be great! Money is tight right now, but where there's a will, there's a way!   I also downloaded some of the new Jimmy fallon CD tonight too. I like him from SNL, and I like a lot of his CD, but it gets just a bit too "frat-boy" for me, especially during the stand-up comedy part of the CD; some of the songs are pretty cool though.   I've been working on several trades on the computer as well, pricing cards and going back and forth with many different people, so it's not all been play. I've got a lot in the works. Trading is sometimes more tedious than it's worth, there's lists to make and emails to write (back and forth and back and forth, etc...), but sometimes it is a pleasure. One guy I trade with in particular, he's always very easy to deal with and a nice guy all around. I bid on and won a few cards on eBay tonight and got some killer deals, but again, money is tight, so I probably shouldn't have spent anything this weekend. I guess I'll have to put a bunch of cards up for sale this weekend, I really could use the additional money right now anyway.   I haven't done much else tonight. Earlier, I watched "Everbody Loves Raymond" on TV, and then I watched the Basketball World Championships off and on. Nowitzki hit some killer shots and his German team seemed to have all of the momentum at the half, but Paul Pierce (this guy is awesome) and Ben Wallace came on strong in the second half and the USA won again. Speaking of Ben Wallace, I'm still pissed the Magic ever traded Big Ben to Detroit, but I understand they needed the cap room for Grant Hill. They had no excuse for trading Bo Outlaw though, that was just plain stupid. If the Magic still had those two guys, man, what a team!  Well, I guess I'm heading to bed; I've got a long weekend, but also an awful lot to do.   Peace.   Out.

        Tired   I am so damn tired of being tired. Last night I barely slept again, only getting 1 or 2 hours of sleep throughout the night. I got up before my alarm again and eventually called off at work (my chest was feeling strained/tight again). I surfed the internet looking for help with my sleep problem and found some info. It looks like I actually have Insomnia, from what I read, but after talking with another friend tonight, I'm starting to think the Slim Fasts I've been drinking might have something to do with it. The sleeplessness really started somewhere around the time I started on the Slim Fast. I'm going to limit the Slim Fast use to before 5pm and see if that helps at all. I may have to quit Slim Fast altogether if that doesn't make a difference. I got a lot of card sorting work done, got to jam with my friend John for an hour, but the whole day I've felt like a turtle in the fast lane, dragging behind while the day whizzed by. On a positive note, I paid my friend John another $20 for his 4-track (I've paid $40 so far) and he said he will sell it for less than $200. He didn't say how much he wants, but any savings for me is good. Okay, time for bed!

        Busy   I've been a very busy man these last few days, putting in 12-14 hours a day in working on my  urlLink basketball card trade page , making tradelists, pulling and organizing cards. I have cards all over the house and now I'm finally getting them all together and organized and listed for trade/sale; it's a colossal undertaking. I giot the web pag up and running over the weekend and have added a bunch of lists, but Ihave a lot more to do. I'm doing the trade page so I can trade cards for cards I want but also to find good ones to sell on eBay (all of my best ones have already been sold). I have an enormous amount of work ahead. I'm not sure why I started all of this now, I have enough going on in my life and should probably be using my time more wisely, but this stuff does need to get done eventually or else I'll never get rid of all these cards.   One of the things I  should be  doing with my time is recording a demo tape. My friend will be by tomorrow to jam again and I'm sure he's expecting a tape of my music to practice with. Maybe I'll do that while he's here tomorrow.  My back has been so bad and then I got all involved with the card stuff, I haven't picked up a guitar for a week (very unusual for me).   Speaking of my back, the Aleve has been working fairly well; I still have pain but not enough to miss work over. The main problem I'm having now is sleep... still. Today I went to work without having slept a wink. I didn't take a nap or anything when I got home either, and I'm still up. It's crazy. Last night in bed, somewhere around 1:30 or 2:00 am, I started thinking about a storyline for a screenplay. My mind went off on it's own basically, off on a tangent, going through details, characters, and possible scenarios, and before I knew it, the sun was shining through my window. A little while later, my alarm clock went off. I absolutely refused to call in again, so I got up and went in. I dragged through the day, but I made it. When I got home, I saw the mess on the table (the cards) and started working on them; I didn't even eat dinner until an hour and half after I got home because I went straight to work (and I was hungry when I left work too). I think I must be going insane. Something is wrong with me, something mentally perhaps; I'm just not quite right and haven't been myself at all lately.

        Better   I didn't fall asleep until about 5am (after getting up at 4am and eating) and I was out of bed by 11:30 am: not really a good night's sleep, but an improvement. I'm feeling a lot better today, all around. I got a lot done on my card-work, I hooked up my Mom's new VCR to our old VCR and recorded my Johnny Socko tapes for my nephew (I may have to redo them though, the tape ran out before I got them all recorded), plus I felt well enough to take an evening walk. I was out walking for about 20-25 minutes under a brilliant full moon. Not a bad night! It wasn't a bad day either. Mom stayed home today and we had Bradford Pub for lunch (I had Nachos, she had wings). Somehow, we managed to get through the day without getting on each other's nerves! I think it helps that she was in her room a lot and I was out in the dining room a lot. Well, it's about that time... here's hoping the sandman delivers again!

        Damn...   I can't believe what a mess I am at this point. I was in bed by 12:30am last night and by 10am, I had gotten maybe 30 minutes of sleep, an hour at the very most (in bits). After barely sleeping last night, I'd have thought I would have fallen asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow, but that didn't happen. Did I forget how to sleep? My mind just would not shut down. I tried to think of something pleasant (thinking about what I'd do if I won the lottery) and that's all it took; my mind started exploring every possibility and it simply would not stop. Hours passed and my mind was still exploring the subject. Am I insane or something?  So, I got up around 11:00am, after lying in bed for an hour unsucessfully trying to get a few winks before the alarm went off, and felt like shit. My chest was feeling tight, and my right foot was sore from the walk last night because I didn't put shoes on before walking (I have a tiny broken bone in my foot that gets inflamed from time to time), and I was feeling completely wiped out...again...beyond exaustion, if that's possible. I was adamant about not calling in to work today, no matter how shitty I was feeling, after all, it was only a 2 1/2 hour shift (just lunch rush) and I'd be back home shortly, so I went in. I was lucky that they put me in the back, collecting money and giving back change; real easy work. I made it through my shift and dragged myself home. I was limping by the time I got home, from my sore foot. I got home and tried to sleep, but even then, after barely sleeping for days, I still could not fall asleep. I am feeling fatigued beyond belief, and it's unbelievable to me that I still am not in bed sleeping. I decided to take a trip to Walgreen's tonight and I picked up 1) Aleve, for inflammation, 2) Doan's for my back pain, 3) some herbal sleeping pills, and 4) some Celestial Sleepytime tea. I feel like the Terminator of Sleep. I am primed and ready to kick sleep's ass. So now it's about 12:30 am, and I am heading to bed. I took the Aleve, I drank some tea, I am going to take the Doan's and sleeping pills after I shut down here, and I hope to finally get a full night's sleep, a peaceful night's sleep. Wish me luck.

        Another Wasted Day...Almost   I went to bed last night around Midnight and read in bed. The plan was to read until I tired out, but instead I read until almost 4am; I finished the book I was reading. I tried to sleep but wound up just tossing and turning all night long; no matter what I did, I could not get comfortable (because of my back). At one point I opened my eyes and the sun was coming through my window; so much for a good night's sleep. I tried forcing myself to sleep ("go to sleep now, you must go to sleep"), but of course, that doesn't work. I finally got up around 8:30am, 2 hours before my alarm was set to ring and called in to work. I was extremely hesitant about calling in sick to work yet again, but my back (and midsection) was just so sore and I was also having some discomfort in my chest, so I figured "better safe than sorry" and did what I had to do. I called my Mom's Employee Assistance Program, which is supposed to reach out to family members as well, but they couldn't offer any medical help to me other than mental counseling. I looked around the internet for som answers and some help, but found neither. At this point, I hadn't slept but a wink or two here or there, if that, I was ready for bed again, and I assumed I'd wind up sleeping the whole day; this day looked like a total waste.   Luckily, things changed.   I woke up at 2:30pm, not sure how much I actually slept, but I know it couldn't be much; a thunderstorm woke me up around 1:30 or 2:00 and kept me from sleeping. So I got up. I worked on cards for a few hours, making lists of cards for sale/trade; it's long and tedious work, but absolutely necessary if I'm ever going to get rid of all these cards. Later, my friend John surprised me by dropping by, which is a true rarity. I showed him 3 new riffs I was developing, we played around on the computer and talked a bit. I lent him my Kurt Vonnegut book, "Slaughterhouse Five". After he left, I instant-messaged with my friend Sue for awhile, which was cool. Then my friend Rob called and I was half listening to him while still IM'ing Sue. He wanted me to call him back later, which I really didn't want to do (I don't have a whole lot to say, and besides, I hate talking on the phone). I tried, didn't get an answer, so I took a walk around my neighborhood. I walked 3 blocks, up and down the streets. It was pretty humid out, not a nice night for a walk, but at least I was out doing it... finally. I'd been wanting to start evening walks for awhile; I'm hoping to make it a habit.   So the day started as a total waste, but I got to talk with my 3 closest friends, I got some work done on my cards, and I took a walk; I got some things done today. Not too shabby...  It is now just after Midnight. I am heading to bed to read a book (not sure which yet), and I'm hoping to get myself a good night's sleep.

        This weekend, I've been...     Listening to:  I've had Lenny Bruce (" urlLink The Originals Vol.2 ") on a lot, and continuing on with the "Bruce" theme, I was playing a Jack Bruce CD (" urlLink Harmony Row ") tonight! If only I had a Springsteen CD ...   Reading : I started the autobiography "Man Of Honor" by  urlLink Joseph Bonanno  (the mob boss). It's pretty interesting reading, but since I already know that he died of old age (and not in jail), I know it's going to skimp on details and pass on any incriminating truths. Still, it's an interesting look at one of the Mafia's key figures.    Watching on TV : Hmmm...well, I had Howard Stern on while I was working on cards last night, and I had CNN on for about 15 minutes today; that's about it really. Oh! I did watch Dennis Miller Live! tonight; forgot about that! I've had a headache all night from playing Computer Games, so I haven't been in the mood for TV at all.    Downloading : I think I've downloaded all I'm going to download for a bit. I'm downloaded out.    Playing : "Star Wars:Galactic Battlegrounds". Very cool game ala "Age Of Empires", I played for about 5 hours tonight, which gave me a killer headache and eyeache. I took some aspirin a while ago and the headache and pain in my left eye are finally beginning to fade. Note to self: don't over do it on the game playing!   Eating : I am drinking 2 Slim fasts a day and eating one meal with veggies in it. I still tend to snack on what I shouldn't though (yesterday: Muenster Cheese, today: Buttered Popcorn). Losing weight is tough, especially for someone like me, someone with absolutely no discipline. Zero. Zilch. Nada.    Feeling : Tired, actually. I would like to just sleep for a week.

        The Times They Are A-Changin'   Well, I am getting some kind of bullshit mixed message from my stupid part-time job. For the last 2 weeks, my back problems have gotten bad and I've had to call off or else take off early from work on several occasions. My bosses seemed to understand (and even appeared genuinely concerned about) my back problem and besides, they they finally hired a few more good people so we aren't hurting at work like we were for awhile; I didn't think my taking time off as needed would be such a big deal. But alas, the new schedule came out today and they chopped mine to bits. They changed it so that I did not have my usual Wednesday off and decided to give me Friday off instead. Not too a big deal, I could've swung with it for one week, but then they also cut my remaining hours nearly in half. I wanted a part-time job, but 16 hours is barely a job. I questioned the head manager about it and he explained that when I called in or left early it hurt them because they have no one to cover for me. Three or four weeks ago, this would have been absolutely true, but now we have enough good people who are already trained and could easily cover. I think the real reason they are doing this now is to make sure that the new people they hired are getting enough hours so that they won't go off looking for another job. See, they schedule most people from 11am to 2pm for lunches, after that they only need about 3 or 4 people to stay til 5pm. There aren't many hours to go around to begin with and most of the new hires want hours. It doesn't take a genius to put two and two together. I don't know why he had to bullshit me about it. I'm not delusional, I understand that they want less hassle and want someone dependable in place, but all they have to do is ask anyone "would you work til 5?" and my shift would be covered. It's really not that big of a deal...or so I thought. So here is my plan: since I have more time on my hands, I will have more time to look for a new job, one that offers insurance, so that when I am in pain, I can get medicine and won't have to suffer through it and call in to work. Voila! Problem solved!

        "How I Spent My Day-Off" by Gary Thomas   I was off on Wednesday, as usual, but this Wednesday I actually got to do some fun stuff. I got up around 12:30 pm (actually slept fairly well for a change) and by 1:20, I was on my way to the movies with my friend Sue. We saw the new Austin Powers movie, "Goldmember"; it was my third viewing (I'd seen it downloaded from the internet), her first. We laughed our asses off! This is a hilarious movie and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who likes to laugh. After the movie, we stopped at Marbos, a Chinese Buffet that we both like. I chowed down on peel-and-eat shrimp, fried clams, meatballs, I ate a mussel, almost ate a piece of sushi (the waiter took it away with my plate before I could try it), ate my favorite noodles (they're really thin and have egg, mushrooms, shrimp, poirk, and other stuff in them), ate a little of a few other things too. As always, I had my bowl of tapioca pudding at the end. I was STUFFED. No joke! On the way home from Marbos we stopped at Salvation Army and I picked up five more books (3 books in a Star wars trilogy, a Dean Koontz book, and "Apollo 13"). Almost as soon as Sue dropped me off at home, my friend John came over and we rehearsed my music for a good hour. Man, some of it sounded pretty darn good, if I may say so myself. I'm really looking forward to the jam with him, his drummer, and his bassist/keyboardist. Now I just need to get a bunch of it recorded so they'll have some idea what I'm playing. I guess I know what I'll be doing in my spare time (or  should  be doing, anyway). After John left, I started playing around on the computer and downloaded a whole bunch of cool stuff. I wound up playing Age Of Empires II and lost track of time (like I always do when I play it!), and before I knew it, it was bedtime! I listened to Lenny Bruce's Originals Vol.2 CD while in bed. What a day!

        Lately, I've been...     Listening to : Lenny Bruce. I have his Carnegie Hall concert on CD and have been playing that in my room while playing Dr.Mario. This is a great show: brilliant, funny, and heavily improvised. Great stuff!   Reading : I keep meaning to start the Sherlock Holmes book, but it still hasn't happened. I haven't read anything for a couple of weeks now. I really should back to reading nightly.   Watching on TV : "Curb Your Enthusiasm". I love this show, but I especially enjoy the one they're re-running tonight (and all week), where everyone thinks Larry has an ass fetish ("I am not an ass man!"). I haven't watched TV much at all other than this show (they re-run 2 episodes a week on HBO), "Whose Line Is It Anyway?", "Insomniac with Dave Attell", "Everybody Loves Raymond", "The Simpsons", "Saturday Night Live", and CNN Headline News. I will occasionally watch something on TLC or Animal Planet, but for the most part, that's about the extent of my TV watching nowadays.   Downloading : I downloaded some more Lenny Bruce stuff today, I want to find some complete shows (Curran, Berkeley). I downloaded some Carlos Mencia shows the other day too. I am a comedy fanatic!   Eating : I am revamping my diet, adding Slim Fast to the mix. I am still eating less than ever before, I hope that counts for something, but I'm still not exercising (my back is just too bad).    Feeling : Anxious, like I'm at a turning point. There's a lot that I am in the process of changing at the moment.

        Friday/Saturday   Friday was just like the days before it: near sleepless. I got about 3 hours sleep and couldn't even get that until 10:30 or 11:00am. So, I called in to work again. I missed 2 1/2 days this week due to that shit. Just terrible. My mind just won't shut down when I try to sleep. I'll lie down and try to think of pleasant things and then I'll start trying to rationalize the things I'm thinking of, down to every last detail: "How could this scenario be possible?", and then I'll break it down in my mind and explain how it could or could not be possible before moving on to the next thing. I'm insane, and I know it.   The other thing I do is time-checking. I'll lie there awhile, note that I'm still not asleep, check the clock, and tell myself "if I fall asleep now, I'll only have 7 hours of sleep". Then I'll toss and turn for another hour, and check the clock again. Before I know it, the sun is coming out. I need to figure out how to sleep again, since it seems I've forgotten how.  I struggled to get through Friday, but I was able to sleep a little better Friday night/Saturday morning. Not because I've figured it out again, but because I was just flat-out exausted.   Saturday was an improvement. I got up after sleeping for 6 hours, checked a few auctions I was watching on eBay (lost both) and went back to bed again for 2 more hours. I didn't sleep but maybe 30-45 minutes out of those 2 hours though. I got up again, got my mailings ready for the Post Office, then went to the Post Office and mailed everything.   When I got back, my sister, my niece and my younger nephew were here waiting for us. They were supposed to be here a while earlier, but they stopped to shop first. We took off to Goodwill and were there for awhile. Goodwill has raised their prices. I was loving getting cassette tapes for .50 each, now they're a dollar. I liked getting my paperbacks for .50 each, now they're a quarter more. My booty from Goodwill today was: (1) cassette tape (John Cougar's "Nothin' Matters And What If It Did?") and 4 paperbacks (George Orwell's "Animal Farm", Mark Twain's "Adventures Of Tom Sawyer" & "Adventures Of Huckleberry Finn", and Mario Puzo's "Omerta"). Not too bad for $4, but it would have been GREAT for $2.50, like it used to be.   After Goodwill, we were trying to figure what to eat; me and my niece wanted Sonny's, my sister wanted Mexican food, and my Mom was undecided. We wound up at Red Lobster. My Mom said that's what she really wanted, and who was I to deny her? Woo-hoo! Or so I thought. They managed to fuck up my meal in many ways. First, they didn't give me a silverware set-up. I finally had to ask for it when they brought out my meal (I borrowed a fork for my salad). Then, when they brought out my meal, they forgot the Shrimp Scampi. I had to ask the waiter if he took it down on the order, he said he did but the kitchen must have overlooked it. When he came back, I had to return my steak. I orderd it Medium and got it Well Done. It was so dry, I could barely chew it. I got it finally,  after  I was full. I had to take it home in a doggy bag. For the inconveniences, they gave us 3 free desserts; just what we needed. We were so stuffed from everything else, we wound up taking the desserts home too. It was about the worst dining experience I have ever had at Red Lobster, and I've had other bad ones too (undercooked lobster is  the worst !).   On the way home, Mom pulled into to Walgreen's back parking lot: Cattails!!! My little nephew, Austin, had a ball! I showed him how to make them explode and he was in heaven, just like his brother was when he was down a couple weeks ago. He had Cattail fluff flying everywhere, and I mean  everywhere . The Pharmacist in Walgreen's drive-up window was watching him go to town on the Cattails and she seemed to be enjoying it as much as we were. That was very cool, and a relief. I was worried they might get annoyed or angry with us, but they weren't at all. She even grabbed another Pharmacist and they were both smiling and laughing at my nephew and his exploding Cattails.   From there, we went home and I went running to the bathroom (upset stomach still). I came out and played around on the guitar with my niece, who has not been practicing her guitar playing at home like she was supposed to be doing. I showed her my effects pedals and helped her with a Green Day song she likes. We went out to the computer and I played AC/DC songs for them (Austin loves "Highway To Hell", to my Mom's dismay). Of course, I had to play "Big Balls". My Mom  really  likes  that  one! I showed my sister some of those IPIX Virtual Tours I found when I was surfing the net the other day. She really liked that.   They left somewhere around 9:30pm. I followed them out to the car and mooned my niece, my nephew and my sister, consecutively. They were laughing their asses off. I walked back into the house, in their headlights, with half my ass out. Being an Uncle is good.    The rest of the night I spent Instant Messinging my friend Sue and watching the re-run of the Jack Black episode of Saturday Night Live. Awesome show! Jack Black was great, but Will Ferrell was THE MAN. I am going to miss the hell out of him next season.   Well, it is 2:38am now, so I'd better try and hit the sack. How successful I'll be is anybody's guess, but I'm going to try anyhow.   Peace..out.

        Tuesdaywednesdaythursday   The last few days are a blur to me. I haven't slept well all week. I went home from work early on Tuesday and then I called in sick today. It's almost as if this week has been one very long day (hence the title of this entry). Let me see what all I've done this week....  * I worked a lot in my room, rearranging things in there to accomodate the guitar equipment that I magically rediscovered. I also had to make room for my new 4-track as well.   * I listened to several CD's while cleaning (and also while playing Dr.Mario). They include Chris Bell's " urlLink I Am The Cosmos ", George Carlin's " urlLink Classic Gold ", and Jimi Hendrix' " urlLink BBC Sessions ".  * I had Bradford Pub for lunch on Wednesday, my usual Buenos Nachos, which ruled as always.  * My friend John was supposed to rehearse with me on Thursday, and once again, he did not show. This is not good. Very disappointing.  * I tried the adapter to the new 4-track on my old 4-track, and guess what? It works. I just need a new adapter, then I'll have 2 working 4-tracks!  * While looking for my old unfinished songs and lyrics, I dug out some of my old Diaries from 1990 and 1991 and read some of my entries. Emotionally, I was up-and-down a lot back then, everything was "life and death". Youth... I've since stabilized (well, for the most part, anyway).   * I worked on a schedule for myself, trying to ration my time. The main reason I did this was to put aside additional time each night for bed, hoping to get myself a good night's sleep more frequently. I am also going to start taking my back pills at night too. I have to do  something , I certainly can't go on the way I have been.  * I've been surfing the net. I checked out  urlLink Ray Romano's website  and watched outtakes from his show there. I also found a few virtual tours of places like  urlLink Evatone  (where I used to work) and  urlLink Graceland  (for my Mom).   * I've been working on a few basketball card trades on the internet this week as well. I definitely have to make a trip to the Post Office this week.

        Wiped Out   For the second night in a row, I barely slept. Unlike the numerous other times I've made it through the day without having slept, it caught up with me today... with a vengeance.  I just haven't been able to sleep at night, due mostly to my back problems, and when I do sleep, it's usually not "a good night's sleep". I toss and turn all night long, and before I know it, the alarm is ringing. Today I had to leave work early because I was just so wiped out. I had no energy, I had an upset stomach (I don't eat before I go to work, which probably didn't help me either), the heat of the kitchen was bothering me more than usual, and I was just flat-out tired, yawning like mad. To make matters worse, when I got home, I was dropping things, knocking things over, and then I (nearly) shit myself. I'd heard before how long distance runners lose bowel control because they get exausted, fatigued, and that is what actually happened to me today. Unbelievable. I have probelms sleeping almost everyday, some days are better than others, but I think the level of sleeplessness that I've been encountering lately is an indication that something is not quite right. I don't know if it's the mattress, if it's my diet, if it's stress or anxiety (my mind is usually reluctant to shut down at bedtime), or what, but something is wrong. I've tried sleeping pills, but they didn't work for me. I gotta do something and soon; I can't take a whole lot more days like today.

        Woo-freakin-hoo!!!   I am literally jumping with joy!! I went into the spare room of ours looking for my lost allen wrenches, but they weren't to be found. However, I found something much, much better: my long lost Wah pedal!! I thought it inadvertantly got put in a box of items I gave to Goodwill a year ago! I looked high and low for it and and finally, reluctantly, wrote it off as "history", resigned to have to fork out some mo' money for a new one. But, lo and behold, here it is! It was lost and now it is found! Woo-hoo!!   Speaking of my lost allen wrenches, I spent most of the night working on setting the action and intonation on my guitar. What a major bitch that was! I'm glad it's over and done with. Whew! I got off to a very shaky start though, since my wrenches have gone missing, so I had to borrow one from a friend of my Mom's who was nice enough to go out and look through his tools for one that fit. That was very nice of him to do, and it helped me out enormously!  Before I got down to work, I went to Walgreen's with Mom and picked up some blank tapes for the 4-track. I want to start recording stuff as soon as I familiarize myself with the recorder. I can't wait! Life is getting better!  Well, for some of us anyway. A new girl started working at my job today. She is really nice, intelligent, looks sort of like Justine Bateman and sort of like Sandra Bullock too, and appears to be someone who you'd think would have a bright future ahead of her. However, she is 5 months pregnant already (she's 19) and apparently (from what I heard from others), doesn't even have a boyfriend or husband. Whether that is true or not, I will find out later, I'm sure, but I get really bothered by this trend of young women or girls, getting pregnant before they've had a chance to experience life, before they've had a shot at becoming somebody or following their dreams, and then, doing it alone, which only makes it worse for her and the child. It's a real shame. I saw how my sister's life has been since she got pregnant early (at 16), and I know how hard things have been for her, that she feels like she lost part of her life (the best years), that she never really had a chance to live, always bogged down with the responsibility of parenthood. At least she didn't have to do it alone though. I feel really bad for this new girl, and like I said to my friend Sue earlier, I don't even know how to react to her when and if we ever discuss her pregnancy. I'm sure we will eventually, it's so dead in the afternoons at Wendy's that all we have to do is talk. It's hard to be happy for her when I know the kind of struggle she's going to have, and I don't want to make her feel bad about herself and her life either by bringing up how hard it's going to be. Tough situation.

        This weekend I've been...    Listening to: I have Miles Davis' " urlLink Kind Of Blue " in the CD player still. I've also been listening to some of my old jams with friends in my cassette player.    Playing : If you've read it once, you've read it 1,000 times: Dr.Mario. Still.   Reading : I still haven't started a new book yet. This week I'll start the Sherlock Holmes book for sure.    Watching on TV : Stand-up comedy on HBO, mainly. I watched  urlLink David Cross'  "The Pride Is Back!" for about the 5th or 6th time and also Eddie Izzard's "Dressed To Kill" for about the 12th time. Both are absolutely brilliant. I tried watching some pre-season NFL football on Saturday night, but it was just too boring for me. I lasted a half an hour before I had to move on. I guess I lose some guy points there.    Downloading : I downloaded a bunch of  urlLink Eddie Izzard  stuff that I had deleted from my computer before (when Gateway told me I had to wipe my hard drive). I'm very glad to have that stuff back: Eddie rules. Also, I gave in to temptation and downloaded " urlLink Goldmember ". It was awesome! I am still planning on seeing it in the theater though; this movie, like the other Austin Powers movies, is one that I could watch 100 times and not get tired of it. Mike Myers is phenomenal!    Eating : The diet is over. I didn't feel it was working, so now I'm playing it by ear until I devise a "cunning diet plan" ("Blackadder" reference there, did ya get it?).    Feeling : Anxious, very ready to get on with things. Progress is near, hopefully.

        Guitar Shop   Feeling inspired tonight, I took my guitar apart and cleaned all of the metal hardware (except the machine heads), the pickups, I fixed my volume/tone control knobs (I had been missing a knob and a screw for ages), and put brand new strings on. It looks nicer than it's looked in a long, long time, but my fingers are still burning from the damned Naval Jelly! I guess I should have worn gloves like the label said. Oh well.  The next job with the guitar will be to re-set the intonation, which is a big pain in the ass. I may re-adjust the action first though, another pain in the ass job, if I'm feeling adventurous enough. We shall see...  I talked to my friend John tonight and he offered me his Fostex 4-track recorder for $200, which is a fair enough price (I looked on the internet and found used ones for as low as $97), but he's really doing me a huge favor by letting me pay it off $40 a month, which is only $20 per paycheck! How cool is that? He said he'll bring it over next Thursday, when we're supposed to rehearse again. I can't wait! This will be an enormous help to me in composing my songs. I have had a 4-track of my own for years, but it doesn't work anymore, hasn't for years, and I don't know if it's something internal or if it's the adapter. I pawned it once and the stupid ass pawn shop sold it to someone while I was still making payments on it. I made them get it back from the guy they sold it to, and ever since then, it hasn't worked worth shit. I think either the shop or the customer (who was none too happy about having to return his purchase) sabotaged it in some way, because it ran beautifully before I pawned it. I really can't wait to have a working one again! Woo-hoo!

        Thursday Night Blues   Blues? Yeah, I don't know why, but that's just how I'm feelin' tonight. I'm not sad or depressed though, in fact, I'm in a pretty good mood. It's a  positive  kind of blue.   I am currently listening to some Brazilian rock/pop music, a band called Legio Urbana. A kid I work with, Felipe (who's from Rio), told me about them. He said they were a "rock" band, so I downloaded a few songs. I was expecting something a little harder, a little heavier than this (it's more like "lite rock"), but this is alright.   I had been reading a web journal all night that I found on the SNL newsgroup. It's a little graphic (languagewise), so I won't post the link here. The young woman who writes the journal works in an adult video store and has some real horror stories to tell. She is also part of a comedy improv group called "Baby Wants Candy" (from Chicago), so it was pretty amusing too. It was definitely a very interesting and enjoyable read, though not for puritanical types.   Last night I put a tape on of a jam session I had with some friends back in 1993. I re-discovered an old song of mine that I had completely forgotten about. It has a killer riff! I'm going to work on it, add additional parts, and make it even better. I also came up with a 2nd guitar part for another one of my old songs, "Blues All Around", so I may start playing that one again. I had originally scrapped all of my older material (I wanted to go in a different direction, musically), but there are a few older ones I think I'll revisit; I just need to tighten them up lyrically and musically.   My part-time job is becoming an even bigger bitch. Two of the managers actually made fun of me for taking Tuesday off ("Ooh, my lungs hurt!"), which I couldn't believe. They have me work in smoke. I choke, gag, cough, wheeze, and strain my diaphragm at work, then I go home and continue coughing and wheezing and continue dealing with the sore throat and diaphragm, feeling so bad that I had to call in sick, and  that's funny to them ? Very uncool. Then they changed my schedule. I now have to come in half an hour earlier every day. Why? Because school starts next week and we lose several people. We are already running with 5 or 6 less people than we're supposed to and now it gets worse. To top it off, my pay increase was supposed to have gone into effect two weeks ago and it hasn't shown up yet. I am so over this job.

        Lately, I've been...     Listening to : Nothing much lately. I've had Wilco on in my room, listened to some Dio on the PC, but haven't really just kicked back and  listened  to anything for awhile.   Reading : About 2 months ago I started a Dean Koontz book, but between my sleep problems and the book not holding my interest, I put it down and haven't read anything since. Last night I picked up my Sherlock Holmes book "A Study In Scarlet", the first Holmes novel by Sir Athur Conan Doyle. Great stuff, as always.    Watching on TV : I've been watching "Home Improvement", "Everybody Loves Raymond" (2 episodes), and then "Seinfeld" during the week, with re-runs of  "Saturday Night Live" thrown in for good measure. I've also been watching "The Sopranos" and "Curb Your Enthusiasm" every Sunday and then watching them again, many times over, throughout the week. Half the time, I'm actually on the computer while all of these shows are on and only half watching them.    Downloading : I haven't downloaded anything for awhile; nothing new I'm interested in at this time.    Playing : I've been playing "Boggle" on the PC still, that's it really.   Eating : Too much. I have discovered turkey burgers and am loving them!   Feeling : In a MAJOR rut. All I do anymore is work (more at home than away), eat, goof off on the PC and watch TV. That's my life.

        Back Again   I haven't been blogging very much lately, unfortunately, not by choice. I've been running on very little sleep for awhile now, going to work, working on my card/eBay stuff when I get home, and just haven't had the energy or focus to write at night. I haven't been doing a whole lot other than working. There have been a few days where I started working on card stuff ten minutes after I got out of bed and didn't stop until bedtime. I have been getting a lot done though, that's the only good thing to come of this. I'm either sleeping a little more at night or else I'm getting used to not sleeping much; it's hard to say. I feel like I'm in a dream sometimes, and a few times I've gotten dizzy. Often, I'm unfocused and have trouble concentrating. I'm tired of having sleep problems and have pretty much decided just to go with it rather than focus on it and fight it. My new motto is "whatever". I am going to try blogging more often since I really enjoy writing, but for now, it is bedtime and I am done for tonight.

        Wiped Out Again   I have barely slept for the last few days and I am getting worn down again. I had both of my nephews down this weekend and only got a few hours sleep on Saturday night. I went to bed much earlier on Sunday night (beat from playing with the kids) but somehow only managed to get a few hours of sleep. I was so tired that I laid in bed for almost an hour with my alarm blaring and was a half an hour late for work. I did not want to get out of bed. I feel like shit. I can't focus/concentrate very well, I don't feel like doing anything, I feel exausted, my body is sore, and my eyes are bloodshot. I tried going to bed early tonight (around 8:30pm), but I just couldn't sleep then and had to get up. I am a wreck.

        Lately, I've been...     Listening to : Not much, really. When I'm in my room for extended periods, I've been playing tapes of myself playing guitar or else just playing the guitar.    Reading : A while back I started a Dean Koontz book, but it didn't really hold my interest, and then I started having sleeping problems and haven't read anything since. I need to get back to reading again, I enjoy it a lot.   Watching on TV : I've gotten a new evening TV routine. From 6pm to 8pm: "Home Improvement", "Everybody Loves Raymond" (2 episodes), and then "Seinfeld". I just realized that each of those shows stars a stand-up comedian. Hmm....interesting (or maybe not).  I  was  watching "The Simpsons" from 6 to 7, but then they started rerunning a handful of the same episodes over and over and I got bored. I usually watch Howard Stern from 11pm to Midnight, and in between, if I watch any TV at all it is usually 1) CNN Headline News, 2) Saturday Night Live re-runs, 3) Animal Planet/Discovery Channel/History Channel (basicaly, anything considered "educational"), 4) "Curb Your Enthusiasm" re-runs (the new season starts soon!), or 5) miscellaneous comedy (stand-up specials, classic sitcoms, or humorous talk shows). "The Sopranos " begins a new season this month and I'm looking forward to that. Basketball season isn't far off either....   Downloading : I downloaded a bunch of Foo Fighters tunes tonight. They did some very cool covers of some old songs, "Baker Street" and "Baby Hold On To Me". I also downloaded some Hendrix too. There are a couple of new Hendrix releases available by mail-order only  that I haven't gotten yet. I will though, soon hopefully. I downloaded some Matthew Sweet stuff the other day too.    Playing : Not much at all. Mostly I've been playing "Boggle" on the PC, but it kind of sucks. A lot of words it uses are highly questionable (foreign or ancient words), and a lot of valid words it doesn't recognize (like "scam" for one).    Eating : I'm doing better than I did last year at this time, but I know I can do better. I haven't had Pizza for many, many  months, I cut way back on milk, eggs and bread, I don't eat ice cream, cookies, or pies anymore either. But, I do eat Ritz crackers with peanut butter and honey on them, buttered popcorn, Muenster cheese, and I drink a 2-liter of Pepsi every week, so I'm still not doing as good as I could be.    Feeling : Better than I have for awhile.

        Back And Blogging   Man, I can't believe it's been a whole week since I've blogged. It's been an up and down sort of week, really good (I worked out a few killer basketball card trades, my friend John cut the price of the 4-track I'm buying from him from $200 to $120, and one evening, I got to take a walk on the beach with my friend Sue) and really bad (I had to go to work with less than an hour of sleep one day and with only 3 or 4 hours of sleep the very next, I got into an argument with my boss, and I lost a card that was supposed to be sent tomorrow in one of my trades). My sleep problem caused me a lot of trouble at work on Monday. I discussed having short shifts all week with the manager who makes the schedules (I'm taking it easy until I can get an appointment with a doctor for my back and sleep problems) but my boss (trying to do me a favor and give me more hours) changed my schedule without telling me and had me working a longer shift on Monday. So, when I went in on Monday with less than an hour of sleep (I went in solely because it was a short shift, normally I'd have called in),  he got pissy with me when I told him I wasn't going to stay later. I think it has passed, and I don't think it was me in particular he was mad at either (he yelled at 3 or 4 people that day). Luckily, since Tuesday night, my sleeping has gotten better throughout the week too. I'm still working with shorter hours at work until I can get my back looked at (which may take awhile). I can always ask to stay later if I'm feeling good that day, so it could be to my advantage doing it this way (although financially, it's a crippler). Since I'm working less, my paychecks will be smaller for awhile...so what did I do to help with the loss of income? That's right... this week I spent $40 on basketball cards on eBay and bought a $25 ticket to the Nov.6th Los Lobos concert. I also have a huge mailing day tomorrow that will probably cost me about $30-$40. I  really  need to put up a bunch of cards on eBay this weekend and get some money coming in again. well, I guess I'd better get to bed; if I get moving early enough tomorrow (and if the weather cooperates), I may be going up to New Port Richey to watch my nephew's football game.    I'm outta here!

        I'm Still Alive   And that's about it. My sleep problems have been getting worse and worse. It's messing me up all day long, everyday, and it's killing my wallet because I'm losing so much time at work. This has been going on for about 3 months now. I've tried sleeping pills (herbal), Nyquil gel caps, herbal tea, Tylenol PM pills and nighttime flu/cold liquid as well, I've tried going to bed earlier at night, later at night, I've tried counting backwards, I've tried thinking happy thoughts, I've tried not drinking caffeine anywhere near bedtime, I've tried snacking before bedtime, and a bunch of other things...still, I barely sleep anymore. I have tried figuring out what the cause might be, and everytime I think I'm on to something, it doesn't add up out. I don't think it's any one thing anmore, I think it's cumulative. It's getting worse because I keep adding to my worries.  I'm really crazy about this girl I work with. I want to ask her out (in fact we're supposed to go to a few museums together the next time our work schedules allow) and maybe I'm more worried and scared about it than I think I am about the whole prospect. She's awesome; smart, funny, beautiful, and we really click when we're together, but I'm ...well...me. I can't get over my inadequacy issues, feeling that I'm not good enough for her, not rich enough (at all), not physically fit enough, and on and on and on...and maybe I'm sabotaging myself to avoid the inevitable rejection and heartache if I pursue her. That line of logic would be: if I don't sleep, I don't work. If I don't work, I don't see her and I don't get paid. If I don't get paid, I won't be able to take her out. Since she works with me, she'd see that I'm not at work and would know that my paycheck would be very short, so I'd have a valid excuse for not taking her out...of not getting any further involved...of not getting any further attatched...thereby lessening the chances of my getting hurt again. I don't necessarily believe this is true, but at this point, she is the main thing that occupies my mind, other than my terrible financial situation. I think it's because my problems are beginning to intersect that my sleep is sufferring more, now than ever. I don't know what to do. I'm in bad, bad shape and I'm in risk of destroying what could possibly be the best relationship I'll ever have.

        Lately, I've been...     Listening to:  I had on Jimi Hendrix "Live At Woodstock" last night, haven't really been listening to too much. My niece gave me her Alicia Keys CD tonight (she didn't want it anymore), so I'll probably be listening to that shortly.   Reading: Still working on Anne Rice's"The Witching Hour". Stayed up all night and day reading it on Tuesday/Wednesday. Still have a bit more to go. It's a little long in parts, but really good nonetheless.   Watching on TV: "The Simpsons", "Everybody Loves Raymond" (2 episodes), and "Seinfeld" is my usual evening fare. Other than the occasional basketball game or documentary, I'm not watching much TV. Sundays has been my main TV night, but my Sunday night lineup has changed: "Curb Your Enthusiasm" is over for the season (REALLY short season!), but there are still 2 more new episodes of "The Sopranos" to go!   Downloading: I downloaded a bunch of Johnny Cash (stuff from his last 2 "American" CD's, I only have the 1st one), Little Steven (I downloaded Pearl Jam and Jackson Browne covers of his great song "I Am A Patriot", plus a handful of his songs...I've never really heard him before, only heard  of him ), Cat Stevens (I am loving "Trouble" and "Don't Be Shy"), and also a bunch of Pearl Jam live covers (The Beatles, The Who, Cat Stevens, etc..). I can't get the Cat Stevens song "Trouble" out of my head. Pearl Jam did a nice cover of it.    Playing:  Football. Not a video game, but two-hand touch football. I had my niece and 2 nephews down over the weekend and we played that and ball tag, and then today, Thanksgiving Day, I wound up playing two-hand touch football again with my nephews, 2 of my brother-in-law's brothers, and 2 neighborhood boys. I am beat!   Eating: Thanksgiving Day....need I say more?   Feeling: Sad, anxious, depressed, and happy.   I had a nice happy weekend with the kids, but then I learned that my Grandmother died on Saturday evening, which really saddened me. We corresponded a lot by mail up until five years ago when I quit replying. She was in poor health then too and I got tired of having nothing positive to say to her about myself, of complaining about my life, so I stopped writing. Her last letter has been on my desk for five years now, waiting for something, anything, good to happen so I could start writing again. I wish now that I had written her anyway, but it's too late for wishes now.   On top of my Grandmother dying, the girl I'm crazy about at work still hasn't gone anywhere with me yet (she said she wanted to). I only get to see her for a couple hours at work per week right now and I want to see her more, outside of work. I'm getting the feeling, she doesn't feel the same though. Everyday it's: "Are you feeling up to doing anything today? No? You're sore? Okay." She is very much pregnant (8 months now), so I'm not sure whether she's blowing me off or if she's really unable to do anything. I really like her a lot, (and this sounds absolutely terrible) but I hope she really does feel lousy and is not just trying not to hurt my feelings by rejecting me outright.    I'm also tortured with the feeling that I am never going to find someone, that I will die alone. Life has been very unkind to me in the love department. They say: "Good things come to those who wait", but how fucking long must I wait? Goddamn!  Speaking of waiting; I'm also waiting, still, for Curtis, a bass player I used to work with at Evatone, to call me about getting together to jam. He said a few weeks ago that we need to get together and jam, my friend Sue gave him my number, and I have a drummer ready to go too, Jimmy (from my friend John's band), but as of yet, no word from Curt. This waiting around shit is killing me.

        Lately, I've been...     Listening to : Primarily old "You Bet Your Life" radio shows. I love Groucho's humor and these old radio shows are just full of it. Humor, that is. I also got to listen to Los Lobos play live at Jannus Landing on Nov.6th. I went with my friends, Sue and Rob. It was a good show, not the best I've seen from them (they had some sound and equipment problems), but well worth the ticket price. They played (in no particular order): "In the Neighborhood", "Hearts Of Stone", "Luz De Mi Vida", "I Got Loaded", "Don't Worry Baby", "Big Boss Man" (Cesar started this one to kill time until David's amp started working again; it had died as he started "Colossal Head"), "Colossal Head", "Malaqe", Neil Young's "Down By The River", an Allman Brothers song ("Don't Keep Me Wonderin'"), among many others. Here's the setlist that I found on a  urlLink Los Lobos website :  Malaqe>  Maria Christina  Don't Worry Baby  Evangeline  Oh Yeah  Colossal Head>  *Big Boss Man>  Colossal Head  Hearts of Stone  Luz De Mi Vida  Done Gone Blue  The Neighborhood  I Got Loaded (w/Lovelight verse)  Down By The River  Runner  Runner  Runner  Cumbia Raza  Encore:  Don't Keep Me Wonderin'  I'm not sure what "Runner" means, and I don't think it's 100% in the correct order either, but close enough. I really love Los Lobos, they're such a great band! I also ran into into a guy I knew from when I worked at Evatone, Curtis, at the show. He's a bass player and he said we should get together and jam. I'm all for that. Sue is supposed to give him my number so we can hook up. I can't wait!   Reading : I read all 3 of Grouchos' books "Groucho and Me", "Memoirs Of A Mangy Lover", and "The Groucho Letters:  Letters From and To Groucho Marx" in the last week or so (all very enjoyable) and have started an Anne Rice book, "The Witching Hour". I've never read any of her books before, but she writes beautifully and I'm sure to pick up more from her.    Watching on TV : "Curb Your Enthusiasm" has been killing me week after week. It's definitely the funniest show on television. I've been watching that, "The Sopranos" and basketball a lot. Not too much else. Great "Sopranos" this week! Just awesome!   Downloading : Old radio shows, especially Groucho Marx material. I've also downloaded some from his contemporaries like Fred Allen and Jack Benny, and some old radio serials.    Playing : I've been playing "Grand Theft Auto" a lot. Morally, it's a terrible game and it should be shunned...but man, it's fun! I guess it's ok to be evil as long as no one gets hurt.   Eating : I just started walking again tonight. I need to keep that up. As far as the eating part goes...I'm eating too much milk and butter again. Mom keeps making pumpkin bread and it begs to be slathered in butter. I'm trying though, and I'm still doing better than this same time last year, but I can still do a whole lot better.   Feeling : I don't know how I'm feeling...anxious, I suppose. I have two young women that I am semi-involved with at the moment and it is torturing me and pleasing me at the same time. I'm pleased that I've got some interest there, but also worried that it's going to end with me getting hurt yet again. One lives in another state and we've conversed a bit over the internet, and the other I work with. She is pregnant (with someone else's child) and has some other problems (big ones) besides that. She's a handful, but we get along so well. I'm really not sure what to do. My own confidence about myself is a whole 'nother issue. Plus my health issues. Besides that, my finances are killing me as well. They keep cutting my hours at work (I'm down to 10 1/2 this week) and I absolutely have to look for a new job. I've got a lot going against me and most of it is of my own doing. I've made my bed, but I don't want to lie in it. I want a new bed.

        Rock Bottom Has Been Hit   Just when I thought things could get no worse, things got worse. I started averaging about 2-3 hours of sleep a day (not even in a row!), and some days I did not sleep at all. It got so bad that I decided to take a week off from work (which turned into two weeks) to try and break the cycle I'd gotten in. That didn't help very much, not at all, actually. All it wound up doing was causing me more stress, financial stress. Plus, I haven't gotten to see the girl at work who I really, really like for 2 weeks now (I really miss her too) and I'm worried that maybe I've lost any or all ground that I've gained with her. I'll find out Monday, when I return to work.  I went to the doctors last Monday and he prescribed Restoril (Temazepan), which has done almost nothing for me. I'm still having a ton of trouble getting to sleep, often not falling asleep until daylight, but once I'm asleep, I do sleep now. We'll see how well I get up on Monday (yay!).  I don't think my doctor cares very much about my well-being; neither he nor his nurse even bothered to take my blood pressure. I mentioned my back problems and he completely ignored it. All he really did was ask me a bunch of questions, listen to me breath for a minute, and then he wrote a prescription. I was expecting a checkup or something, to find out why I've been having these problems lately, but I got almost nothing and it cost me $55. I won't be going back to him. I'm going to have to start working A LOT. I've needed to get a new job for awhile, but I NEED to be working 40 hours a week now. I am so far in debt, to everyone it seems, and I HATE IT! My Mother's birthday was last week, and instead of buying her something nice, I had to borrow $200 from her so I wouldn't bounce some checks I'd written. I hate not having money and I need to do something soon to get some. My Mom put some pants on her Sears card for me so I could get a better job, but the pants are miscut and unwearable (they look like clown pants). It's been one setback after another all year long. I hope things start getting better soon, I really need a vacation from rock bottom.

        Last Week: From Christmas To Now   Christmas Eve was disappointing to me. Instead of wrapping the 4 CD's I bought Mom for Christmas and giving them to her the next day at my sister's house, I went back to her room and gave them to her that night. She was busy wrapping presents and she totally dismissed my gifts. Her reply was "hand me that box over there." Not even a "thank you". Later, I did get a "thank you" when I brought her some scotch tape that she'd asked for. Nice. She gave me my gifts before we left for my sister's. I got 2 Jimi Hendrix CDs: "Wild Blue Angel" (single disc) and "First Rays Of The New Rising Sun" (which I already had), The White Stripes "White Blood Cells" CD (with a special bonus DVD), Beck's "Sea Change", and Dio's "The Beast Of Dio". I also got a big can of Poppycock (yum!), 2 jackets, a shirt, and a CD game ("Pharoah"). Of course,  I  thanked her for everything.   We left for my sister's house around 9am on Christmas Day. The kids were already awake, which kind of sucked; I always have fun waking them up on Christmas morning. They tore through their presents. I surprised my nephew with the CD he got. He thought he was getting AC/DC's "High Voltage" CD, but I gave that to my brother-in-law (along with a $10 Blockbuster gift card) and gave him Dio's "The Beast Of Dio" CD, which he had wanted even more. I also gave him an assortment box of football card packs. I didn't give my niece the "Vacation" video that I'd bought her, I decided to keep it for myself because it's an "R" rated movie, but I did give her the handheld Simon game, batteries, a deck of Uno cards, and the glow-in-the-dark frisbee. My younger nephew got a whoopie cushion and 4 book/Hot Wheels cars combo packs, which he really didn't seem at all interested in them. I could have saved myself $25 and not bought him anything, I probably would've gotten the same reaction from him. I gave my sister a $20 gift card for Books-A-Million and I gave my Mom the aforementioned CDs. At my sister's house, I received 2 gifts. First, I got a coffee mug from my older nephew. His other grandmother took him shopping and bought various gifts for him to give. Later, when we were leaving to go back home, I thanked him for the mug and he replied "what mug?" My niece got me a Christmas card.   I was real disappointed in my sister and brother-in-law. I had asked them to get the kids to make cards for their grandmother (and hoping they made one for me too) but they didn't. At least my niece personalized her card to me, which was great, my older nephew made some effort, but the little one did nothing for anyone else and that seems to be ok with his parents. I'm afrraid they're going to grow up to be spoiled little brats who take everything for granted, who appreciate nothing, and who think little of giving back. That worries me.   We had a nice Christmas dinner, my sister made meatloaf with vegetables (mixed into the meatloaf) and Stouffer's Macaroni and Cheese (which rules). It was better than it sounded to me a few days before. I played outside with the kids (with the football) for awhile, and later played my older nephew's "Grand Theft Auto: Vice City" Playstation 2 game with him for awhile too. Not a game I'd have given a child (my niece's boyfriend gave it to him). It was  extremely  violent, and far too realistic. Fun though.   On Friday, I switched with someone at work and got to leave early. I was able to make a doctor's appointment (I was still really congested, my sinuses were killing me, and my ears were plugged and achy) and went to the doctor's at 4pm. $55 later, we dropped off my prescriptions at Walgreens and headed to Best Buy to exchange the Hendrix CD that Mom got me (the one I already had). I exchanged it for a special edition of Los Lobos' "Good Morning Aztlan" CD that comes with a bonus disc. I also bought the 2 CD version of Hendrix's "Wild Blue Angel" CD. Sweet! She had to get a refund on a video she bought at Toys 'R' Us (I did it for her) and then we decided to go up to my sister's again (to pick up my niece, who was supposed to come down this weekend). Of course, my niece made other plans. My sister said "you should have called first", which pissed me off. Why does it always have to fall on us (me and my Mom)? Why can't  they  ever take the responsibility? I was none too happy. I decided to have my older nephew down instead, since he said he wanted to come down. The next thing I know,  both  nephews are coming down. This pissed me off as well. Nobody bothered to ask me if I wanted both kids down (I didn't), instead, my sister asked the 5 year old if he wanted to come down. I was the one who would ultimately have to babysit the two kids, to do stuff with them, yet it never occurred to my sister to ask me first. I wasn't feeling well, I tried to get out of it, but apparently my sister wanted to have a weekend without any kids around, so I got stuck with them both. I like having the little one down by himself. I don't like having the little one down with any of the others. He's yoo young to do most things the other kids can do, and he always wants to be included in everything I do with the other kids, so he limits what I can do with them. Pretty much all we can do is play catch and watch TV, and that's about all we did do. I had a lot of stuff planned and I got to do almost none of it. Besides him limiting what I can do, him and the older boy argue and fight constantly, so that situation just wasn't much fun for me. My niece is supposed to come down next weekend now and I'm going to try and get her down on Friday, by herself.

        Lately, I've been...     Listening to : Nothing the last few days, mostly been sleeping.    Reading : Finally finished "Cavett". I have ambivalent feelings towards the book. Some of it was interesting and informnative and some of it seemed obnoxious and boring. Not sure what I'm going to start next...probably "Helter Skelter".    Watching on TV : "Everybody Loves Raymond", "Saturday Night Live",  and various History Channel and National Geographic Channel shows. Not much for TV lately.    Downloading : I downloaded a bunch of comedy stuff; CD's of Brian Regan, Jim Breuer, and Richard Jeni, as well as a bunch of hilarious radio appearances from Regan and Breuer. I've gotten behind on my CD buying in the last few years, there's so much out there I want now. I'm thankful that I'm able to download this stuff to hear it in the meantime.   Playing : I broke out my "Caesar III" game and played a bit. I like the game a lot, but I still haven't figured out how to run a city without losing money and pissing of my citizens. Sounds a bit like me in real life!    Working : One of the girls I work with is a major bitch and is getting worse. She's always trying to tell others what to do (while being a lazyass herself) and she's always sticking her nose in everyone else's business. I went home early today (another employee wanted to stay later so we switched) and she kept busting my balls over it ("What time are you  supposed  to work until?"), as if it were her concern. She's been doing my usual job lately too, running the drive-thru register. She had been making comments about how come I always get to do it and apparently she's complained to the managers about it. She's been there a lot less time than me, but because she used to be a manager at a different Wendys, and because one of the managers is her buddy, she thinks she should have run of the place. This doesn't sit too well with me, not at all. I don't like my job enough to put up with that kind of shit for long. We will be butting heads shortly.    Eating : I haven't been drinking any Slim Fasts lately, but I also haven't been eating a whole lot either, and I have been trying to be more watchful of what I eat, if that means anything.    Feeling : I'd be feeling OK if I could just shake my leftover flu problems. I'm still very congested and I still have an earache in both ears (and one ear is still closed). I have a headache right now from it all. I was going to go to the doctors tonight, the walk-in clinic, but I found out it costs $70 just for the visit and said "fuck it, I'll live with it awhile longer". I'll have to make an appoointment for next Tuesday or Wednesday, whenever I'm off early enough to go, at my "regular" doctor's office (the one who gave me a half-assed lookover last time). I hope it goes away on it's own, soon, but knowing my luck, I doubt it will. I'll probably have to continue being miserable for awhile more.

        Feelin' Like Dookie   I'm still not over the flu yet. I'm still really congested and am wheezing like mad. In fact, when I was lying in bed trying to sleep last night, I was being kept awake by my own breathing sounds. It sounded like a school of whales talking to each other. On top of that, my left ear is bothering me a bit and my right ear is "closed". Besides being physically uncomfortable, I am having trouble hearing too. I feel like I have a towel wrapped around my head. There are only 4 more days til Christmas and it looks like I won't be able to shake everything before then, which really pisses me off. I had high hopes of having the kids down a lot during Christmas break, but at this rate, I doubt I'll be up to doing much. It's typical of the way things have gone for me all year though, I shouldn't be surprised. I thought 2002 would be a great year for me, but it's been a major disappointment. I hope 2003 makes up for it.

        Christmas Blues   The general concensus in my family (i.e. my Mom and my sister) is that Christmas is "for the kids", which I think is total bullshit. The adults get neglected in the gift receiving department, yet we're the ones doing all of the buying, all of the working for the money to buy the gifts...why should we be left out of the receiving end? Don't get me wrong, I'm not being greedy or anything, I enjoy buying things for my family too. I like trying to pick out things they'll like, maybe stuff they wouldn't normally buy for themselves, and I like seeing their smiles when they are pleasantly surprised by something I gave them. But why shouldn't that be reciprocated? I, for one, like the idea that someone would take the time to pick out a gift especially for me, based on my likes and dislikes. It means that someone knows me well enough to shop for me and it also means that someone cares enough to put themselves out for me. I don't think those sentiments are for children only, nor should they be, but in my family, it appears that's just the way it is and I hate it. The main problem, and one that no one will likely admit to, is procrastination. Everyone waits until the last minute to do the Christmas shopping, nothing is ever budgeted, so we usually end up short on money. This translates into: the kids will get theirs, the adults will have to do without. I'm guilty of procrastinating too, but I usually try to make the effort to get everyone  something . After all, how much enjoyment is there in watching children who have everything, who have way more than I ever had (some even more than I have now), opening even more gifts that they don't need or appreciate, and often, don't even want? I say "let the grown ups have some fun too".

        Lately, I've been...     Listening to:  I listened to the newly remastered "Smash Hits" by The Jimi Hendrix Experience last night, which, as I said before was  the  album that got me started with Hendrix and with the guitar. I played along with it on guitar a bit too. I also listened to disc 1 of the David Cross' new comedy CD that I bought the other day, "Shut Up You Fucking Baby!". He feels the same way I do on a lot of issues, like religion (in particular), and ridicules all the right people. I also had on AC/DC's remastered "Highway To Hell" CD, and then put on the remastered version of "Stevie Ray Vaughan's "Couldn't Stand The Weather" CD, rocking out while I cleaned my room.    Reading:  Still working on the Dick Cavett book...slowly. The personal stuff on him is incredibly boring for me, but he has great insight into comedy and comedy writing and he also talks about Woody Allen and Groucho Marx a lot (two of my comedy idols), so it's not a total snoozer or without merit.    Watching on TV:  "Everybody Loves Raymond" and "Seinfeld", some basketball, and "Tough Crowd" (Colin Quinn's show). Other than Howard Stern now and then, that's about the extent of my daily TV viewing right now. I did watch a re-run of "Friends" tonight though.    Downloading:  I downloaded Little Richard doing a Leadbelly song that I enjoyed hearing back in the day ("Rock Island Line"), and I tried to download the newest Jimi Hendrix CD on Dagger Records (his family's record label), "Baggy's Rehearsal Sessions", but was unsucessful. I only got half of one track downloaded and then I was cut off (by the other user). I'm dying to hear that CD, but won't have money to order it until tax refund time.    Playing:  No games at all. I did get Mom to pick me up another civilization building game, "Pharoah", the other day, but I have to wait until Christmas to open it. It looks really cool. It looks like I'll be able to build Egyptian pyramids, temples, and even the Sphinx. Sweet! I still haven't played my "Caesar III" game, which I bought several months ago. It's a civilization building game too, only based on ancient Rome rather than Egypt. I love those types of games, "Age Of Empires", "America", "Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrouds"...fun stuff!    Eating:  Mom's been bringing food home all week. Tonight we had Boston Market chicken (with mashed potatoes and spinach), but I wasn't real crazy about it. I think Publix's chicken is better, and I've had better mashed potatoes and gravy elsewhere. I hadn't tried Boston Market before, and I don't think I'd want it again. Last night's supper was awesome; mom brought home a gyro and a small greek salad from Stavros! It  kicked ass !! The night before that, when we went up to my sister's, I had Papa John's pizza, then later, on the way home (after the Christmas show and after shopping my ass off), I bought us Chik-Fil-A. The night before that, we had McDonald's Filet-O-Fish sandwiches. I've been munching on chicken nuggets at work, fries to once in a while, I need to knock that shit off again. I quit eating anything at work for a long time.    Feeling:  Not bad...wistful? I dunno. I feel better that I finally wrote my Grandfather, that's for sure. It's been almost 4 weeks since my Grandmother died and I had wanted to write him sooner, but I kept putting it off (I got really sick too, so at least I have an excuse).   I'm looking forward to Christmas next week (5 shopping days left!). I know I'm not going to get much, and I HATE getting up early to travel up to my sister's house, but I always have fun with the kids once they get up and start ripping open their presents. Hopefully we'll be bringing at least one of the little shits home with us that night. I really need to get some money coming in so I'll have something for when one or more of them come down, and I still need money to buy the last 2 Christmas presents that I need to get. What to do, what to do...  Susan, the pregnant girl from Wendys (the one I was crazy about) came in sometime Tuesday with her newborn baby (so I was told) . I'm glad to hear they're both healthy and well. I guess she's planning on returning to work at Wendys in a month or two. I don't know how things will be between us anymore, the way she left without saying anything to me kind of left me feeleing rejected, neglected. I suppose there's always hope, always a chance that we could get together still, but at this point, I'm not feeling it anymore, and it seems like an alien idea to me now.

        6 Shopping Days Left!!   I  almost  have my Christmas shopping done..yay for me!!! I spent a small fortune (for me, anyhow) on Christmas this year. I hate having shitty Christmas Days, but it'll probably be pretty thin, on the receiving end for me, again this year since no one really has much money. At least I did my part to try and make it better. I got my sister a $20 gift certificate for Books-a-Million, I got my niece a handheld Simon game, batteries for it, a glow-in-the dark frisbee, and a video ("Vacation"), my younger nephew is getting 4 beginners books that each come with a Hot Wheels car, he'll probably get a few Fart Bombs too, as will my older nephew, who will be getting a Dio CD ("The Beast Of Dio: Greatest Hits") that I still need to buy. I'll probably get him some football cards too. My brother-in-law is getting AC/DC's "High Voltage" CD, which I originally bought for my nephew (I forgot he liked Dio better). I may keep the "Vacation" video for myself since I would prefer to get my niece a Pinball game for her PC. I bought myslef Jimi Hendrix's "Smash Hits" CD tonight. This was the album that got me started with Hendrix and with guitar playing. I got my Mom 4 CDs too (Van Morrison, Rod Stewart, Barbra Streisand, and Elvis) which she picked out, with my assistance. I just hope I haven't overspent, since I still need to buy a few things. Luckily I got some money in today, which helps a lot, but as of right now, I have no idea how much I have left, if anything. I think I still need about $20 to finish up my shopping.  The one Christmas blunder I made, which cost me about $60 total, was freeze-dried space ice cream. I thought it was going to be a really cool, different, gift to give the kids, but I took some up tonight to let them try and and  they hated it . Fuck! I ordered extra last night because I didn't think I'd have enough to go around and it appears they  don't want any . Great. What a waste. I guess I know what I'll be snacking on for the next month. I really could've used the money for something else, I knew I should've had them try some over the weekend when I was up there. That would've saved me $35.     Austin Sings   We went up to my sister's again tonight for my youngest nephew's Christmas show that his daycare puts on every year. He just stood there last year but he was more animated this year doing gestures and singing a bit. He looked really shy up there on the stage, which is way different from how he is around family. In fact, I was hoping he'd grab the mic and break into "Big Balls" or "Highway To Hell", like he was singing earlier in the night. That would've been hilarious! I sat between my niece and older nephew and we laughed and joked during most of the show, when the other kids were on. Before we left for the show, everyone chowed on Papa John's pizza, everyone tried and hated the aforementioned freeze-dried ice cream, and then, as we were leaving to go to the Christmas show, I tackled my niece on the front lawn. She was walking to the car with her boyfriend and I came up fast behind her, grabbed her, and took her to the ground (not without care, I wouldn't hurt her). She never knew what hit her! Her Uncle Doug was laughing his ass off! Later he said that it was the highlight of his whole night! I embarrased her after the show too. First I bared my buttcrack in the parking lot, then when she said her goodnights and was walking to her parent's car, I started waving my arms and yelling (in as retarded a voice as I could) "Bye, Dana! Daaaa-Naaaa...bye! Bye, Dana!". Everyone in the parking lot was looking at us! She kept walking towards her car as fast as she could without acknowledging me. I knew I got her though. It was great! It's good to be an Uncle.

        Brrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!!   I am freezing my balls off! Our heat/air is broken and it is cold inside this mofo, 56 degrees last I checked. I have a space heater thats keeping my room fairly warm, but out in the living room...fuhgeddabotit. COLD. I spent the night at my sisters last night and barely slept. She has a stupid dog that kept me awake, plus I had no blanket and a hard pillow, then the boys woke me up early with their big mouths). After I got up, Mom made me my favorite breakfast, "Dippy Bread", which, in high society, is also known as French Toast. Me and my sister went out for about 2 hours shortly thereafter. We hit the USA Flea Market, Encore Music (my Mom wanted to get my nephew a recorder, so I got one for her), and then to Fantastic Toys. I  almost  bought a new guitar pedal at Encore. Boss put out a new wah/univibe pedal called a Virtual Wah that kicks ass and was only $150. I might lay it away next week when I'm down. I started to this time, but then I started thinking about my bills and backed off at the last minute. After me and my sister got back, I workied with my niece on her guitar a little bit. She needs to practice without me, but she never does, so she's progressing painfully slow. Me and Mom stayed up there tilll about 6:30 tonight and then headed on home, to our icebox of a home. We went up yesterday afternoon, after hitting the new indoor flea market (I bought 7 cassette tapes: Ratt "Out Of The Cellar", Cat Stevens "Greatest Hits", KISS "Destroyer", Mark Knopfler "Local Hero", AC/DC "Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap", Prince "Purple Rain & "Around The World In A Day" and I also picked up a nice hardcover Stephen King book, "Rose Madder", all for a total of $9.00), and after I talked Mom into heading up. I'm glad we did, we had a good time. Mom took me and my oldest nephew out to the mall and we had a good time looking at Spencers gifts. They have all kinds of funny, neat, and cool gags and toys there. My nephew loved it! We went over to Toys 'R Us next and looked around there. Mom got me a computer game there, "Pharoah", where you can build Egyptian cities. Looks cool! After that we went to Circuit City and I bought my nephew AC/DC's "High Voltage" CD for Christmas. I also bought myself David Cross' new CD too, "Shut Up You Fucking Baby!" (it's a 2 CD set and was only $14, I couldn't resist). We wound up going for Chinese food after that and we took it back to my sister's place and chowed down. It was ok food, I've definitely had better, but the prices were good. I played with the boys awhile and later, I taught me older nephew how to play Poker and helped him with Solitaire too. All in all, a pretty fun weekend.

        Lately, I've been...     Listening to : I haven't been playing CD's at all lately, mainly listening to stuff I downloaded on the PC (see below).    Reading : "Cavett", a fairly boring semi-autobigraphy of Dick Cavett. Why? I keep asking myself that same question. I always thought he was someone who found himself to be extremely funny and clever, a very egocentric person, and quite frankly, a bore. So why am I reading an autobiography on the man? Because he was friends with Groucho Marx and Woody Allen and because he had Jimi Hendrix on his television show, not once, but twice. I guess I'm just hoping the book will talk about those folks. I'm a good way through it, and still no luck there.    Watching on TV : I am loving Colin Quinn's new show "Tough Crowd". It's a bit like his NBC show that was pulled prematurely, but it still features a small group of comedians just talking and joking amongst themselves, riffing. Good stuff. Still getting my daily dose of back-to-back "Everybody Loves Raymond" as well as "Seinfeld" too (most nights).    Downloading : A TON! I downloaded Chris Robinson's (from The Black Crowes) solo debut "New Earth Mud" (what I've heard of it, I loved), Uncle Tupelo's CD "Anodyne", all of Ryan Adams' solo work as well as some of Whiskeytown's stuff, some Woody Guthrie (I had never heard him before, only heard  of  him), and the last two Wilco CD's (which are brilliant). I really need to start buying CD's again, I'm getting way behind. There's a lot of good stuff out there nowadays it seems.    Playing : No games right now, just surfing (the net) and playing guitar.    Eating : My freeze-dried space ice cream has arrived and I've had 2 packs already! I may have to order more before Christmas at that rate!  I chowed down at Wendys today. I ate a burger and a fry, which is extremely rare for me. Normally I'll eat a few chicken nuggets, if anything. I haven't really been eating much due to the flu, but when I do, it's usually the wrong stuff. Like yesterday, I ate about 3 chicken nuggets at work, then I ate Sonny's for dinner and had a cup of hot chocloate later at night. Not a ton of food, but the wrong stuff.    Feeling : Dissatisfied. I'm just not happy with my job, my social life, my finances, my living situation, my band situation (I still don't have one), or anything else in my life. I've been thinking a lot about my Grandfather and the rest of my family up in Pennsylvania and I've been contemplating a move back home in a couple years. I don't know that things would be any better for me up there, but I miss the family an awful lot and I miss Cochranville a lot too. I have to start taking care of business here soon.

        Still Crappy, Only A Little Less So   Rough week thus far! I went to work on Monday and survived, but I only lasted an hour and a half on Tuesday. I was sweating profusely almost as soon as I left my house. I got so hot at work though, it felt like I was overheating. My stomach was queasy too, my nerves shaky, and I was coughing up phlegm; not exactly the guy you'd want serving you in a restaurant anyway. They wanted me to stay until 3, but I had to go then, at 1. I needed some cool air more than anything. It was better at home, but I've found that our A/C is no longer working for some reason. I'm still pretty stuffy and congested and my ears are still popping, but I'm better than I was a few days ago. I'm just hoping it's all done with by this weekend. I'm supposed to go up to my sister's a for my nephew's basketball game (the 1st of the season) and then we're going to do stuff with my niece, including bringing her here to stay overnight. There's supposed to be a meteor shower at 4am on Saturday morning and I'd like to take her outside to see it if it's possible (it may rain here) and if I can get her ass up to see it. If I'm still feeling shitty, all those plans may change. I hope not though, I really enjoy the time I get to spend with the kids, and it's good for me physically too; they're usually good for a few hours of outdoor excecise for me!

        Still Feeling Crappy   I went to bed hours ago but I've been coughing and spitting so much, and feeling so warm, that I finally had to get up again. I'm supposed to be up for work in about 6 hours; who knows what time I'll actually fall asleep? I guess I'm not going in. I really hate to call in yet again, but I'm in no condition to work around people. My cough is really bad, and I know I'll be coughing up blood before long. They'll get by without me, they always do, but I feel really bad this time because the cool manager did me a favor and changed the schedule so I'd have 3 more hours today and now I'm not going in at all. I've been trying to go in more consistently anyway, since I've missed so much time already these last few months, but something seems to come up every week. It's been one thing after another, but never any good things, always crap. I am sick and tired of being sick and tired. I doubt if I'll be well enought to have my niece down as planned either. This sucks!

        Feelin' Like Crap!   I've come down with a cold or a flu or something and now I feel like shit. I'm super congested and my body aches. I called in to work for tomorrow (a 12 hour notice) and I got the "guilt treatment" from my boss. When I told him why I was staying home, he said "I've had one all week too... have a nice day off." "I've had one all week too.." Like I don't get what he  really  means, that he was sick and still came to work and there's no reason I shouldn't be able to work too. In other words "You're a pussy". "Have a nice day off"? He thinks I'm full of shit too, the bastard, but I know it's him who's full of it. He speaks with a phony, "friendly voice", but there is a palpably strong undercurrent of bitterness, of spite. I think he  really  hates me. I'm an annoyance to him. I can't blame him for it entirely, I've brought a lot of it on myself, but still...there's no reason to talk to me like I'm a child except that that's likely how he feels about me. I'd prefer brutal honesty to his fake sincerity, his false friendliness. Besides, it's not like Wendy's is the promised land; it's a shit job and I damned well know it. If I never saw him or his restaurant again, I would care less. Good riddance, in fact. I'm sure he feels the same way about me too, even though he pretends to be my buddy. I hate phonies.   I spent most of the day and night in bed, sleeping and reading. I finished "The Vampire Lestat". Really good book, but I'm wondering why she (Anne Rice) glossed over the homosexuality of the characters; it was obvious that all of the vampires were gay or bisexual, but she always kept that notion vague. Since they all seemed to be gay, I think she should have explained whether the gayness was part of being a vampire or it if was just this specific group of vampires that were gay. She alluded to it in one part, but it weasn't really clear, especially since it was obvious that some were gay  before  they were made into vampires. Anyway, I liked the book a lot, even more than "The Witching Hour" (which seemed a bit too long because of all of the "historical" details ), and I'm looking forward to picking up more from her. Hopefully, I'll hit some Goodwills this weekend when my niece, Dana, is supposed to come down. I just hope I'm well by then.

        Lately, I've been...     Listening to:  Tonight, in my room, I was playing the Jimi Hendrix "Blues" CD, which is incredible.      Reading:  I'm most of the way through Anne Rice's "The Vampire Lestat" which is really, really good.    Watching on TV:  "The Simpsons" and "Everybody Loves Raymond" (2 back-to-back episodes). I also watched "The Sopranos" on Sunday and again on Monday. I can't wait until the next one, the season (and perhaps, series?) finale. I predict that either Tony or Meadow will die. You heard it here first. I've also been watching the Friar's Club Roasts on Comedy Central. They had a new one with Chevy Chase, and then they've been replaying all of the others. Really funny stuff! Gilbert Gottfried, in particular, killed me during the Hugh Hefner roast.    Downloading:  I downloaded the Mr.Show movie "Run Ronnie Run", which was hilarious! I don't know why the studio refuses to release it in some form. As James Lipton would say: it ...is ...brilliant. Thank goodness for Kazaalite and for whoever had it, making it available there, or else I may have never seen it. I also downloaded David Cross' new CD "Shut Up You Fucking Baby!", which was also quite brilliant. The flipside of "brilliant" would be "stupid", which leads me to mentioning that I also downloaded some Beetlejuice stuff from Howard Stern's show. Beetlejuice is more than "stupid", he is "gloriously stupid". Beet is  tha man !   Playing:  Nothing. Mainly been reading, working, and watching TV.   Eating:  I don't see that I've lost anything since I started drinking Slim Fast, but in all honesty, I don't stick to it by the letter either. I also don't excercise other than when I have the kids down and that isn't helping either. I still drink too much milk, and eat too much butter. Those seem to be the hardest for me to do without. I probably drink too much Pepsi too, when I should be drinking water.   Feeling:  Disappointed. Hurt. Sad. Susan, the girl from Wendy's that I liked a lot, came in to Wendys to pick up her check (she may have one more coming) but she hardly spoke to me and then she left without even saying goodbye. If I ever wanted to know where she stood, I think I found out, and that saddens me so much that I don't even want to think about it.  I'm also a bit angry at one of the other girls I work with, who is being a total bitch. She has barely worked at the store, and in the small amount of time she's been there, she's called off as much as or more than I have, but suddenly she's trying to dictate what position  I  work in. She wants the "easy jobs" for herself and doesn't care who she pisses off to get what she wants. She's a lazyass. On Monday, all she did was talk with her buddy, one of our managers, while another girl did her job for her and got no help, and then the lazy bitch wanted to leave 20 minutes early! Asshole.

        What's Up   I finished reading Anne Rice's "The Witching Hour" last night. I liked a lot of things about the book, but there were some things in the story that I found confusing, logically, which took away from it a little. However, that didn't stop me from picking up 2 more Anne Rice books at Goodwill today! I picked up a nice softcover copy of "Servant Of The Bones" and a beat up copy of "The Vampire Lestat". I also picked up a nice hardcover copy of Stephen King's "Dolores Claiborne" and another book called "How To Increase Your Word Power". I didn't need to buy any more books, I still have a backlog of books to read, but usually I enjoy the hunt just as much as the read. I bought 5 cassette tapes at Goodwill too (I bought Mom six as well). I picked up Talking Heads "Stop Making Sense", Chicago "Take Me Back To Chicago", Boz Scaggs "Hits", Billy Joel "Glass Houses", and Roy Orbison "Mystery Girl". They all looked to be in great shape. The total for the 11 cassette tapes and the 4 books was less than $20 ...not too shabby!  All night tonight, I've been pulling, scanning, and listing cards on eBay. I have enough scanned for tomorrow too. I'm hoping for a $200 weekend next week. I may be asking too much though, since I started most of the auctions off at what they usually end at, rather than my usual $1 opening bid. We'll see how it goes. I did it that way this time because I am tired of seeing my good cards end for nothing. The $37.50 Tracy McGrady Upper Deck UDX parallel card #'ed /100 that ended for $1.00 (minus the $.30 listing fee and the $.25 that Paypal took out) was just too much for me. I paid $6.50 for it.   Sadly, I found out yesterday that the girl from Wendys (who I was hoping to go out with) quit on Wednesday. I should see her on Monday, when she comes to pick up her paycheck, and I'll talk to her then... maybe. It might be my last hope for anything with her. I doubt anything will happen now though. That's too bad, for her and for me. We could have made each other very happy, possibly for the long run. I felt really good around her.  I still need to write to my Grandfather. It's been a week since my Grandmother died and I haven't talked to him at all. We're not close otr anything, but I still feel I have to say... something. It's really awkward. My life is no better today than when I was 18, I'm a very unhappy, depressed person, I hate myself and my life, but I'm supposed to say something positive to him? Something uplifting? I will try, I have to, but it won't be easy.

        Wasted Wednesday   I was off on Wednesday, but instead of doing any of the things I had planned on doing (housework, watching the 1st "Lord Of The Rings" movie, etc...), I spent almost the entire day in front of my computer talking to Gateway tech support people. Yay for me!! I deleted a firewall program from my computer because it seemed to be causing problems, but then it locked up my Internet Explorer and I had to delete some things from my computer to get rid of it totally. Unfortunately, the things that were deleted (as per the firewall's instructions) were key to my operating system and it completely shut me down. I had to wipe my hard drive, not once, but twice and then had to re-install  everything . I had to wipe it twice because one of the many techs that I spoke to had me do something wrong. I spent about 12 hours on the PC restoring everything, and didn't get to bed until 2am. I fell asleep much, much later. What a piece of shit day.

        Lately, I've been...     Listening to : Nothing lately. When I've been my room, it's been to read or sleep.     Reading : I just finished Stephen King's "The Stand". Great book, maybe the best King book I've read thus far, but I was a bit disappointed by the last scene with Flagg. It really felt anticlimactic to me. I like what I've read here, but I would like to read the full, unedited version someday. It'd be be neat to see what all he left out.  I think I'm going to read his "Danse Macabre" next, unless I did out a Hendrix book or two tomorrow.     Watching on TV : Not much so far this week, just been reading and playing guitar a lot. Mom brought home the first Lord Of The Rings movie and I hope to watch it tomorrow when I'm off. I haven't seen either of them yet.     Downloading : I downloaded a bunch of Mike Nesmith songs (solo and with the Monkees), plus a bunch of Gilbert Gottfried appearances on the Howard Stern Show. Man, I wish we got Stern here.      Playing : Nothing but my guitar, unless playing with the cats counts.    Working : They cut my hours a bit from last week to this, and I left 1/2 hour early today (I got everything done early), but I may pick up a few extra hours on Friday.     Eating : Meatball sandwiches for dinner, all week so far.     Feeling : Anxious, but hopeful. Waiting and hoping for my tax refund to show up in my checking account. I really need the money! I'm also getting really anxious about my music again. Whenever I start playing more often, I get frustrated because I should be out there, playing in a band, because I am good enough to do that.

        It's Going To Be An Interesting Week...And Other Random Thoughts   The Bucs won the Super Bowl tonight so people here (in the Tampa Bay area) are very excited. Fireworks were going off around my neighborhood  almost as soon as the Bucs scored their final touchdown, and TV coverage (I just turned the TV off moments ago) of Tampa and Ybor City showed a lot of people still out partying and celebrating. I'm not a big football fan (I did watch the game though), but almost everyone I work with are big Bucs fans, so they should all be in great moods this week.   I listed 50 auctions this weekend, so I'm hoping to have money coming in again soon (no telling when the tax refund will come in). I get paid tomorrow, but that's pretty much history. I got a little in today, but I turned around and bought a killer tie-dye shirt on eBay (red, white, and blue ...$29 with shipping). I'm starting to pick up some clothes here lately, which is not my norm. There are a few other shirts on eBay that I'm watching too (hoping to buy some more as soon as I get some extra money).   I'm off early on Tuesday and Friday (so far) this week and I'm off on Wednesday, so, since I'll have the extra home-time, I'd like to get some stuff done around the house. It's pretty much a pig sty. I need to clean my room, my bathroom, the kitchen, the living room, vacuum everything, dust, move stuff out of the living room, move other stuff in, clear my cards out of the living room and dining rom and bedroom and move them into the spare room (which needs a big time cleaning too). The place is a royal mess. Also, if my tax refund comes in by mid-week (which I really doubt it will), I'd like to re-screen the porch for Mom.   I'm hoping to get my 4-track hooked up and operating this week too. I need to buy a bass again, for recording with. I also need to buy a head for the speaker cabinet I got from Sue, and I'd really like to buy the Boss V-Wah pedal, which absolutely rules. I started some new music in bed last night and I'm really dying to do something with my music.   I have a lot of hopes and dreams pending.

        This Weekend   It's been a lazy weekend so far. I laid down to read this afternoon (I'm a little more than halfway through "The Stand"), sometime after 2pm, and wound up falling asleep, sleeping until around 7pm. Woke up feeling groggy. I got up because I had to list some auctions tonight, which I did, but I wound up only doing re-lists (in other words, I didn't have to do much work at all). I half-watched "Shallow Hal" while listing. I love Gwyneth Paltrow and am a Jack Black fan too, but the movie was a lil' cheesy, not many laughs. We didn't go anywhere today, didn't do jack. Very boring day. Tomorrow looks no different. I suppose I will try and watch the Super Bowl tomorrow. I'm not a big football fan, I'd rather play it than watch it, but since everyone around here is rooting for the Bucs to win (I live outside of Tampa), I guess I should. I don't think I've ever watched a Super Bowl game in my life. I also want to list about 25 more auctions tomorrow night too, so I will have to get off my ass at some point and scan cards to list. Ho-hum...

        Taxtime Is Sweet   I filed my taxes tonight and woo-hoo!! I'm going to be getting back  more than twice  what I had originally thought! Yes! I was expecting about $250, but I will be getting almost $640. I will be able to pay off my debt to my friend Sue, give Mom $100 or $200, take Mom out to dinner (Red Lobster here we come!), buy all of the Jimi Hendrix CDs I'm missing (the Dagger Records releases), and still have some money left over! Sweet! I opted for direct deposit, so I'm hoping to check my bank account soon (possibly even next week) and find a very pleasant surprise sitting in there! Yay for me!!

        Lately, I've been...     Listening to : I just got in a new Hendrix CD that I ordered, " urlLink The Rainbow Bridge Concert ", a live 2 CD set (live in Maui, Hawaii 1970). It sounds GREAT! It's supposed to be remastered and it definitely sounds like it is. It's not on an "official" label, so it's almost a bootleg, yet it isn't really. Very weird CD, but glad to have it nonetheless! I've also been playing my newly aquired Scorpions " urlLink Blackout " (remastered) CD a lot, too. It rocks!   Reading : I've started Stephen King's "The Stand". I'm sure I'll be reading this one for awhile as it's around 750 pages long! Whew! Great book, thus far...    Watching on TV : Not much at all. "Everybody Loves Raymond" and "Seinfeld" mainly.    Downloading : I downloaded a lot of early Scorpions stuff I'd never heard before (it's a lot different from their later stuff, but still enjoyable), and some Scorpions-related music like the Michael Shenker Group and UFO, neither of which I'd really heard before. This is what I love about being able to download stuff, the experimenting, checking out new music. It's an invaluable aid. If only people didn't burn the music they've downloaded, thereby eliminating the need to purchase CDs, the record companies would have little to complain about, and everyone would be happy.    Playing:  I still haven't been playing any games lately.    Working : I'm scheduled to work all week, Monday through Friday, which is a change for me. My feet are sore, but things are going well. The bitch is gone all week, which is nice, but it looks like she'll be back next week. I'm learning more Spanish at work too, since I'm working with Nery everyday.     Eating : Mom's been making fattening food lately and I have been eating a little at work everyday. I don't eat a ton, just the wrong stuff. The only time I eat vegetables is when they come on a burger. I guess I've given up on Slim Fast for the time being.     Feeling : Feeling more upbeat then I have for a while. I think it helps to have money in my pocket and it's also been good for me to have kids down on the weekends, keeps me active.

        Busy Weekend!!   I wasn't planning on doing much this weekend, especially since I'm scheduled to work more next week, but my plans changed. First off, I decided to have my older nephew down this weekend since he didn't have a weekend basketball game this weekend (he'll be playing most Saturdays for the next month or two). Me and Mom went up to get him Friday afternoon (Mom took the day off, I was off by 2pm) and we stopped at a few Pawn Shops on the way up. I wound up buying a ton of CDs, 18 in all, for only $40. The beauty part is that 13 of them were brand new, still sealed! I gave my Mom one of them (Glen Campbell), kept 8 for myself (Blue Oyster Cult "Don't Fear The Reaper: The Best of Blue yster Cult -remastered and sealed, Scorpions "World Wide Live - remastered and sealed, Jim Croce "Photographs & Memories: His Greatest Hits - remastered and sealed, AC/DC "For Those About To Rock" - remastered and sealed, John Popper "Zygote",  Kenny Wayne Sheppard "Trouble Is", Green Day "Nimrod", and 1 other), sold 5 on Saturday (2 Jackson Browne, ZZ Top, Grand Funk, and The Grateful Dead) for $24, sold my nephew 1 for $3 (AC/DC "Back In Black" - remastered), took one to Circuit City (The Cars "Greatest Hits") and traded it for a brand new remastered Rush CD ("Permanent Waves") and even got $2 and some change back for it! The Rush CD wound up costing me about  forty cents ...sweet! I still have 3 sealed ones that I want to sell (Beach Boys, Chris Isaak, and .38 Special). I'll probably list them on eBay next weekend (hopefully, I'll get another $20 back on my initial investment). It was kind of like the old days again, just scamming away! I used to be quite the scammer back in the day, I guess I always will be.   During the course of my Pawn Shop and record store excursions on Friday and Saturday, I also bought 2 Jimi Hendrix tribute CDs ("Blue Haze" & "Acoustic Ladyland"), Scorpions "Blackout" (remastered), Rush "Moving Pictures" (remastered), and Sam Kinison's out-of-print "Louder Than Hell" cassette (used for $2). Whew!   I didn't spend the entire weekend music shopping however, as I said before, my nephew came down to visit. We played Rummy a few times (I won everytime), played Uno (with Mom too), played with the cats (he hadn't seen them before), played with the guitars and my keyboard a bit, looked through my books (he borrowed Larry Bird's "Drive" autobiography), ate, ate, ate (burgers, chili, and potatoes on Friday night, meatball subs on Saturday night, and french toast and sausage Sunday afternoon, and watched a championship football game on Sunday (Bucs/Eagles). However, the highlight of our weekend was the trip(s) we took to Celebration Station on Saturday night. Mom and I surprised him good! We told him we were going clothes shopping next (we had already been to the Post Office and a record store), that we were going shopping for "socks and underwear". It was pretty cold out (Mom brought us coffee after awhile), but we rode Go-karts and Bumper Boats for an hour or two, until we left to go to another record store and Circuit City, then on home to eat dinner. After dinner, since we both had our Celebration Station wristbands on, and since they were still intact and valid, we went back to Celebration Station and rode Go-Karts for another hour! It was killer!! I was blocking people and cutting them off, running them into walls and each other, and even slammed a few myself...it was awesome!! My nephew loved it too! My Mom took some pictures of us going around the track, I can't wait to see them...I'll bet I was smiling like a crazy fool!! It was great fun, but man do my muscles ache now! Ouch!

        Lately, I've been...     Listening to : I've played The White Stripes' first CD (self titled) a couple of times this week. Some really great stuff on there. I've mostly been reading in my room, without music.    Reading : Almost done with the Sam Sheppard book, only 3 or 4 pages to go. What a messed-up confusing case that was! The book ends with Sheppard still in jail, little did the author know that the case would be in and out of the courts for another 40 years! Nor did he know that Sheppard would go free eventually (I researched the case on the internet while reading the book). He definitely did not get a fair trial, that much is obvious. I think he did murder his wife though, if not by himself, then with help, but he was most certainly involved.    Watching on TV : I watched a few movies ("The Apostle", "Apocalypse Now Redux"), been watching "Everybody Loves Raymond" again, "Insomniac" (Dave Attell's show), "Curb Your Enthusiasm" reruns, and that's about it really. I've mostly been downloading stuff on the PC.    Downloading : A lot! I discovered that Bob & Doug McKenzie had a second comedy album ("Strange Brew") and that they also guest DJ'ed a radio show, which was also available for download. I really wish "Strange Brew" was out on CD, I'd definitely buy it! I guess I need to start hunting for the cassette tape and/or the LP. I also downloaded Bobcat Goldthwait's "Meat Bob" CD, which is long out of print (I'd been looking for it for years). Besides comedy, I discovered The Donnas and like what I've heard (very Ramones-ish). I also downloaded a bunch of live Stevie Ray Vaughan songs tonight, mostly Hendrix covers, and a lot of Frank Zappa & the Mothers Of Invention stuff that I'd never heard.      Playing : No games still. Maybe this weekend, when my nephew comes down. I still haven't played my "Pharoah" game that I got for Christmas.     Working : That annoying bee-yatch got on my nerves earlier in the week (bossing me around, volunteering me for work), but luckily she's going to be out for 2 weeks due to surgery...yay!!  I'm scheduled for 27 1/2 hours next week, which for me, is a shitload of hours. I started taking vitamins, so hopefully I will make it in everyday. If only the cats will stop messing with me while I sleep...   Eating :  Too... much... cheese.   Feeling : Feeling alright, I guess. Not sleeping well or much (damn cats), but otherwise OK. Things are looking up in some areas (finances, health) so I can't complain too much.

        More Of The Same   Two weeks into the new year and things continue to suck ass. I started having sleeping problems again last week, continuing through last night (hopefully better tonight). If the sleep problem wasn't bad enough, the two kittens keep fucking with me all night long, walking on and/or licking my head, sticking their faces in mine (tickling me with their whiskers), getting up on things they shouldn't be/knocking things over, etc...I missed two days of work last week because of it. Plus, my ears were still bothering me a bit (better today though). On the bright side, I listed cards on eBay this last weekend and am doing pretty good thus far ($127 made in a day and a half with about 40 more auctions still running), and I got put in for a raise at work ($0.15..oh boy). More good stuff, please.

        Lately, I've been...    Listening to:  I played Wilco's "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot" a couple times. I haven't been listening to much in my room lately.     Reading:  Almost done with Ellen Degeneres' "My Point...And I Do Have One", which is very funny. I especially enjoyed her Iditarod story!       Watching on TV:  Hmmm..well we got the new cable and I've been checking out a lot of things. Trio plays old "Late Night With David Letterman" reruns, and I try to catch them when I can. I used to get in trouble all the time when that show originally aired because I'd stay up til 1:30 am watching it and wouldn't get up for school the next morning! Those were the days... I've also been watching a lot on Discovery Civilization including David Frost's Nixon interview and I like Nixon even less now. Watched a few "Married...With Children" episodes too. My old TV-viewing schedule is all out of whack! I hardly watch anything anymore that I viewed regularly, say,  two weeks ago. Howard Stern has been boring lately. It's all strippers and lesbians lately... boring stuff to watch. Did I just say that?    Downloading:  I discovered Randy California's "Kapt. Kopter & The (Fabulous) Twirly Birds" album. His songwriting was pretty disjointed, but his guitar playing was exceptional. I've also discovered The Ramones. I've always known of them, but never really  listened  to them. I downloaded their first three albums, most from remastered CDs, and I like what I've heard. I've also discovered that Doyle Bramhall II has three solo CDs that I never knew about. I loved his work with Arc Angels and from what I've heard from his "Welcome" CD, it's very much in the Arc Angels mold. Really good music! I'm going to have to keep an eye peeled for his stuff when I'm music shopping.    Playing:  Nothing. I've been sleeping, watching TV, and downloading, and that's about it. No time for games.     Working:  Things are OK at work I guess. That bitch is still on my nerves and apparently we lost two people this week (neither bothered to call in or give notice). Also, this one guy, who gets on everybody's nerves, got on mine the other day. He's rude and does shoddy, sloppy, and often unsanitary, work. He needs to be fired, but they'll never do it because he shows up everyday. That's sad.    Eating:  Been eating a lot of cheese lately, hoping to quell my upset stomach. If I'm still on a diet, I know nothing about it.     Feeling:  Been feeling groggy all day. I napped for a few hours, but I woke up feeling groggy still. My throat hurts too and I'm still congested. At least my ears are feeling normal again. I love Winter but I hate the cold/flu season that Winter brings.

        Monday Blues   I was about 40 minutes late for work today. First I overslept (the bed was soooo comfy), but then I just couldn't get out of the bathroom in time to catch the bus. After I got to work, I wound up spending a good part of the afternoon in the men's room there too. Nature called and boy, did I answer! I think that Mexican food is  still  kicking my ass! Although, I did have an upset stomach last week too... perhaps it's my medicine (almost over the flu, but still have ear discomfort, some congestion and wheezing, though not as bad as before). We were busy at work today, and besides my tardiness, two other people didn't show up at all (no calls either) so we were short-handed. Nobody really complained about me being late though, which was nice. I snagged a free lunch while there, unbeknownst to my boss. After I got home, I spent the rest of night downloading music, mainly Los Lobos and Randy California songs (I'd never heard Randy California before last night, only heard of him, but I liked what I have heard thus far), and playing with the kitties. I still haven't named them yet. My niece suggested calling the ornery one "Doctor Evil" and I kind of like "Doc" for him, the other one I started calling "Mini-Mew", but I don't think it's going to stick. "Socks" (for the black and white one) and "Smokey" (for the gray one) could stick, but the names are just too bland and common for my liking. Their previous owners called them "Zip" and "Tucker" but I don't like those names either. I might call the gray one "Toonces" since he kind of looks like "Toonces (The Cat Who Could Drive A Car)" from SNL. Maybe not. I don't know. Naming the cats is much harder than it should be! Well, anyway, that's pretty much how I spent my whole night tonight. I do have things that I needed to do, but I did nothing of any importance tonight. I'm off early tomorrow (so far), so I'll probably (possibly) get back on track then. Or not.

        This weekend...   I had my niece down this weekend and she kept me busy the whole time. On Friday night, after work, Mom and I went up to pick her up. We didn't get home til about 9:30 or 10pm (after we stopped for food at Sonic, Taco Bell, and then Sonic again) and by then it was too late to do much of anything that night. It was cold outside all weekend, so we couldn't do anything outside either, which is unusual (we normally throw the frisbee and/or play catch). Yet, somehow, we stayed up til after 4am Friday night. We played Rummy, listened to music, talked, played around on the computer (looked at 3-D pictures, looked for pictures of Italy, Germany, and England, and looked up medieval torture devices), and before we went to sleep that night, we looked through my books (she started reading "Animal Farm" that night and read all weekend when she had the chance). Saturday, we were up fairly early considering we hadn't slept much or well (the cats kept waking us throughout the night; me in my bed, she in a sleeping bag on the floor). Mom made us French Toast and after awhile we went shopping. We stopped at Pawn Depot (she bought a Boyz II Men CD there),  then we went on to Best Buy. She bought a CD/radio walkman, batteries, and mini-earphones, and I bought 4 CDs: The White Stripes' " urlLink The White Stripes ", Chris Robinson's " urlLink New Earth Mud ", Wilco's " urlLink Yankee Hotel Foxtrot ", and Ben Harper's " urlLink Burn To Shine ". From there we stopped off at Parc Resale and Goodwill and I bought a squirtgun ($0.25), a jumprope ($0.10), 2 cassette tapes ($0.50 each: Men At Work "Business As Usual" and Marc Cohn's self-titled debut), and a handful of books ($0.50 each: Edmond Rostand's "Cyrano De Bergerac", Paul Homles' "The Sam Sheppard Murder Case", Shakespeare's "Henry IV, Part One", Ellen Degeneres' "My Point - And I Do Have One", and Ken Kesey's "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest". Not a bad haul. Afterwards, we all went to eat at Carumba's, a local mexican restaurant. Before we went in, we stopped in the store next door to it, a little hippie head shop basically, but they had something that intrigued my niece: beads. She wound up making her own necklace, with some input from me, and it turned out really nice. She loved it and wants to go back again already. In the restaurant, the food was decent, but the waitress was really bad and left us hanging way too long. We all left there completely stuffed though. We got home and I had to run to the bathroom immediately. My stomach went crazy all night long, making odd, loud sounds and I was farting like mad! Ugh! Regardless, me and my niece had a good time. We played Rummy again (I remain unbeaten), listened to music on the computer and in my room, looked through my college Humanities books, and talked a lot. We went to sleep at 5am that night, but luckily the cats left us alone (after forcing the door open though).  Sunday was mostly spent in bed. We slept til around 3pm, and after we went to drop my niece off, I came back home, put Wilco on, and went back to bed. I didn't feel very well. I don't know if it was from the mexican food or from sleeping poorly all weekend, or whatever, but it had me feeling extremely ... blah . I stayed in bed until a little after 8pm and woke up still feeling lousy. Because of that, I didn't list anything on eBay tonight. I will have to start up again next week.

        Happy New Year!   Here's hoping 2003 is an improvement over the shitty 2002, which sucked ass!  As the new year begins, I am still getting over my flu (still congested and wheezing, still having sinus and ear problems, and I've also got an upset stomach), I'm dealing with an insane eBay buyer (he said 7 of 10 of the cards I sent him were missing from the envelope, but now it appears that he has somehow lost them), and my finances are rough...very rough (I hate owing people and I owe a few right now). On the plus side, we just got two kittens today (they are getting into  everything , but they're really cute!) from a friend of my mom, we're due to get a new cable company tomorrow and we'll get a  ton  of channels with the deal (it will be a nice, much-needed, improvement), and my niece is due down this weekend to spend some time with us (Friday, hopefully). 2003 is off to an uneven, but promising, start so far...    Lately, I've been...    Listening to: My new CD's! Los Lobos'  urlLink "Good Morning Aztlan " kicks ass, as does Beck's  urlLink "Sea Change " and The White Stripes'  urlLink "White Blood Cells ". The Jimi Hendrix Isle Of Wight CD's ("Wild Blue Angel") are decent too. You can't really go wrong with any Hendrix recording, but I'm not sure why they found it necessary to make a  urlLink 2 CD set   and  a  urlLink single CD set  (that is nearly identical to disc 1 of the 2 CD set) of this show. It wasn't one of his best shows to begin with, the PA troubles are annoying, and he was clearly unhappy at the end of the show. I'm not really complaining too much though, it's nice to have this entire Hendrix concert on CD finally (much of it has been released in bits and pieces since the early '70's). I also picked up Patty Scialfa's  urlLink "Rumble Doll " CD again! We went over to the pawn shop where I sold mine before and they had one, probably the same one! Aka Mrs.Bruce Springsteen, I love her singining and the songs are really catchy... glad to have this one back in my collection!  Reading: I finished reading Vincent Bugliosi's "Helter Skelter", and will probably start reading Stephen King's "Danse Macabre", which I picked up at Goodwill yesterday for $0.75.   Watching on TV: Nothing much at all. I watched a little tonight only because I wanted to sit down with the kittens. I wound up watching a few "Whose Line Is It Anyway" episodes, and "The Man Show". There just wasn't anything good on TV today (or even lately). I can't wait to get all those additional cable channels tomorrow!  Downloading: I downloaded a bunch of Charles Manson songs and interviews and clips this week, to compliment the book I was reading. I also downloaded a ton of Bill Cosby albums that I'd never heard before (I never knew they even existed). Manson and Cosby... that's a hell of a combination, eh?   Playing: I played a little bit of Super Mario and Dr.Mario yesterday while checking out which games still worked and which didn't.  Working: I was tricked into giving up a few hours this week to that bitch that I complained about before. Her husband lost his job and she was trying to pick up hours this week, so I told her that if I was still scheduled to work till 5 all of the other days I worked this week, she could have my 5 1/2 hour shift on Tuesday (since I still wasn't feeling well). She went back to check the schedule and said I worked til 5pm all week, so I gave her Tuesday. Turns out, I work til 2pm, not 5pm, most days this week. I only had two 5pm shifts and I gave her one of them. Bitch!    Eating: Everything in sight. The holidays are over, so I will go back to being more selective.   Feeling: Tired of being sick. Tired period.

        One Week Later...   Still not feeling 100% yet. Now, it's one of my tonsils that is bothering me, plus I have a stuffy head, a sinus headache, and earaches. I'm about ready for a coffin. It's always something anymore. I haven't been doing much in the last seven days because of how I've been feeling. I haven't went anywhere but work and one trip to McDonalds and I haven't done much except watch TV and work/play on the computer. I did well this past week with my auctions, but now I have to wait for the money to come in; some will come in quickly, some not-so-quickly, and some won't come at all. I need some NOW. I need to give Mom some too. I'm going to try to get my niece down this weekend, so I'll need money for that too. Hopefully I'll be up for some running around by then.  I don't have much to say right now, so i guess I'm going to sign off. More later...

        Pissed   Here it is, $133 later, and I'm still not feeling well. I'm better than I was, but for $133, I should be weller than a motherfucker. I slept 2 or 3 hours last night, in total, so that didn't help me out much either. Damn cats kept messing with me all night (wanting attention), plus I started feeling very warm and couldn't get comfortable. Right now, I have a monster headache, my nose is still stuffed up, my ears ache, I feel warm, and I am dead tired.  I should go to bed early. In fact, I think I will head there shortly (after I take the trash out).

        Lately, I've been...     Listening to : On Friday night I bought Deep Purple's "Come Taste The Band" (the remastered & expanded version) at Walgreens (a true "impulse buy") and enjoyed it a great deal, especially the song "Rat Bat Blue", which kicks major ass. I also got in my Hendrix CDs from Dagger/Experience Hendrix (they shipped  fast ) and listened to "The Baggy's Rehearsal Sessions" (great Band Of Gypsys stuff). I also listened to the Jerry Seinfeld CD I won on Bidville ("I'm Telling You For The Last Time"), which was very funny!   Reading : Nothing. I still haven't finished the Carl Sagan book I was reading, but I also haven't had the urge to pick it up again.     Watching on TV :  "Insomniac with Dave Attell", "The Simpsons", "Dave Chappelle's Show", "Everybody Loves Rayond", "Saturday Night Live", "Trading Spaces", "Blackadder", "Monty Python", and basketball (about half).    Downloading : Deep Purple!! I'm on a Deep Purple kick! I want to start picking up their remastered CDs soon, especially "FireBall", "In Rock", "Machine Head", and "Burn". I don't think "Burn" has been remastered yet though. "Stormbringer", another I'd like to pick up, probably hasn't been done yet either.    Playing : My old handheld Poker game. It's so basic, but I love it. It's a good time killer.   Working : I haven't worked a single day this week. I got sick... again... and missed 4 days of work or 14 hours (I was scheduled light this week anyways). They make it seem like a huge affront to them that I'd missed all week, like it was a giant problem, but it was just 14 hours and I was only scheduled to work til 5pm just one day, so I couldn't have inconvenienced them much.     Eating : My usual sick food: McDonalds Cheeseburgers. I also had some Pineapple Upsidedown cake that Mom made midweek (it ruled). I've also been eating English Muffins a lot too. I really haven't been eating much... but you couldn't tell that by looking at me.    Feeling : PISSED OFF. I spent all of my income tax and paycheck money and was expecting a smooth and happy future. I didn't expect to get sick again, and I certainly didn't forsee having to come up with $55 for a doctor's office visit, and no way in frigging Hell did I know I would have to spend $78 on medication. Mom footed that bill because I am flat broke, but I should be able to pay her back this week with my auction money. Besides the financial drain, it was/is no fun being sick. My sinuses were  killing me ! The pressure in my face was so intense that I felt like ripping my face apart at times. My nose was stopped up, running, and inflamed. I was blowing my nose constantly, which caused my ears to become irritated and inflamed as well, which made my head and jaw hurt. I felt like shit all week. My nose is still stopped up, but luckily the pressure is gone from my sinuses and I don't feel as listless as before. I'm just tired of being sick. It's always me. I spent the previous weekend solely with my Mom and my nephew, but only I got sick. What kind of cruel joke is that?     Planning : Jams!! I had to add this category as I have some great jam plans in the coming month or so. First, my friend John quit his band finally (they wanted to become an "all '80's" band) and now he wants to take his music back into the studio to make a demo and he wants me to help him with it. He also said he's going to try and help me with my music too, including finally getting that jam with his old drummer set-up. I can't wait for that! I would also like to get my Wendys manager and his roomate into the rehearsal studio to jam soon too, and I'm  still  waiting on Curtis' hand to get better so we can jam. I think him, Jimmy (my friend's old drummer), and I would be a great combo, and if John wanted to join in, that might be interesting as well. I can't wait to get playing with people again. It's been about 10 years, I think, since I  really  got to play (my stuff).

        This Week ...So Far   Sucks. Sucks hard. My little stuffy head turned into a cold or flu. I was up til 5:30am Monday morning with a stuffy nose, stomach pains and the big "D". I missed work that day, and then the next day, today, I just wasn't feeling up to going in (my throat was achy, scratchy and my ears and head were sore, plus my nose was stopped up still) so I called off again. I  hate  calling in for work. I always feel like a jerk when I have to do it, and I do it fairly frequently. They must really hate me at work. I don't blame them either, I would've fired myself long ago, but I really get the feeling they think I pretend to be sick a lot and I don't, really, I get sick  for real  a lot, more than most folks for some reason. It really sucks.  This  really sucks.

        The Weekend   My weekend started off great! First thing in the morning, my IRS check had been deposited in the bank! I immediately gave Mom $300 and divvied up the rest between me and my friend Sue (who I owed $200 for an amplifier cabinet). I worked on Friday, got home, and soon after Mom arrived (and with a whole lot of argument), we headed up to New Port Richey to pick up my nephew (as had been planned all week long). I had planned on buying my Mom dinner at Red Lobster with my tax money and was planning on doing that after we picked my nephew up, but all she did was bitch and complain and argue about going up there. It makes it very hard to do something nice (or  want  to do something nice) for someone who acts like that. Nonetheless, we picked up Jesse and went out to Red Lobster for dinner. I had a steak and shrimp pasta dinner, plus I ordered a ton of appetizers for us all to chow on. We were all stuffed by the time we left there (for $85 we damn well should be), and we all had a good time there, even Mom. Jesse has been working on improving his manners, it was very noticeable, so I complimented him on it. After dinner, we headed back to our place. we tried stopping at a few places on the way home (the money was burning a hole in my pocket), but everything was closed. We stayed up really late on Friday. We went out around 12:30am or 1am and played frisbee for awhile. We hit the sack around 3:30am or 4am. jess played with my handheld games for awhile (Yahtzee, Uno, Connect Four, Poker, Checkers, etc..) while I read myself to sleep.   On Saturday, we slept in late. After we finally got up and moving, and after Mom finally got home (she picked  the worst  time of the day to go run errands, knowing that we were limited by time on Saturday due to the All-Star stuff), we went to the pawn shop near my house and looked at baseball gloves and CDs there. I bought 2 sealed CDs that looked to be of the non-promo, non-record club variety. What this means to me is simple: exchange. I paid a total of $6 for the 2 CDs (Mariah Carey & Keith Sweat) and then I took them to Circuit City and traded them in for two CDs that I really wanted (I got $27 in credit): Robin Trower "Bridge Of Sighs" (remastered and expanded) and Doyle Bramhall & Smokestack "Welcome". Sweet! Unfortunately, after I got home I noticed the booklet for the Bramhall CD is bent on one corner... I hate stuff like that! I'm incredibly picky when it comes to my CDs. Anyhow, after that we stopped at Dunkin' Donuts and I bought us a dozen donuts to take home and chow on while we wathed the NBA All-Star events for Saturday. me and Jess watched the second half of the Rookie Game, then went to my room and played cards (Rummy, I clobbered him) and listened to music until the other cool All-Star stuff was coming on (3-point contest, 3 on 3, Slam Dunk contest). I ordered Sonny's for us all (we chowed on baby back ribs) and Mom went out and picked it up. I bought again ($35). We ate and then watched the All-Star stuff. later that night, Jesse (and me, partly) watched "Dracula 2000". I saw it before and thought it was ok, Jess loved it. He was jumping in fright at several parts!   On Sunday, we got up around 11:30. I woke Jess up with a few Wet Willies and then threw all of my pillows on him. We were supposed to go see "Lord Of The Rings: the Two Towers", but wound up not doing that. Mom was complaining about time and driving, so we cut that out of our plans. Instead, we went to the Thrift Store (where I took his brother, 2 weeks ago) and we shopped for an hour and a half. Mom waited in the car the whole time. I'll never figure her out. She complains that the kids never do things with her, but she makes herself unaccessable, standoffish. She was with us, but she wasn't  with us , and she very easily could have been, and I tried to include her in stuff. Anyway, after an hour and a half of shopping for clothes for Jess (he bought a ton of shirts including a camouflage T-shirt and a Dennis Rodman Bulls jersey) we went over to Specs where I bought a few CDs and a Video. The video was "Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery" (widescreen version with deleted scenes) and the CDs were Zebra "Zebra", HSAS "through The Fire", and Doyle Bramhall "Jellycream". Again, after I got home, I noticed that the Bramhall over was bent, as was the HSAS cover... dammit!! Nice quality control, record company jerks! We were headed home from Specs, when I suggested eating at this little Mexican restaurant on the way home. Mom bitched about that, but we ate there anyway. Again, I paid ($35). It was pretty darn good food. The Chili Rellenos were ok, I've had better, but I loved the shredded beef tacos and the rice was great. We headed home from there and before long, we had to take Jess home, meeting his Dad halfway. I started to get a stuffy nose early Sunday morning and it dogged me all day Sunday.

        Lately, I've been...     Listening to : I have KISS' "The Elder" on right now,  and the other day I had on Green Day's "Nimrod" CD. I also listened to my "new" Billy Squier's "Emotions In Motion" tape (which rocks) while I was fixing my Mom's door (which my nephew broke down).    Reading : Right now I'm working on Carl Sagan's "The Cosmic Connection" (pretty interesting book), and since I watched "Dolores Claiborne" the other night, I'm planning on reading that book next, although the Vietnam book I bought at Goodwill on Monday ("Once A Warrior King") is awful tempting too...   Watching on TV : Last night I half-watched "Lord Of The Rings - The Fellowship Of The Rings" again. Watched a little bit of David Letterman the other night (Kate Hudson was on), some Conan here and there, my usual "Everybody Loves Raymond" (need some new episodes to watch, it's still funny, but getting old fast) and "Seinfeld", and that's about it. Not been sitting in front of the TV much lately, mostly in front of the PC.    Downloading : For the first time in ages, I have been downloading... nothing. Well...nothing for the last few days anyhow. Over the weekend I did get some Hendrix stuff back, downloaded most of Steve Martin's "Pure Drivel" CD audiobook, got the HSAS CD "Through The Fire", and I got my Bob & Doug McKenzie stuff back ("Strange Brew" & "Guest DJs").   Playing : My guitar. Still waiting for the day when I will be able to jam again.    Working : Not much, but since I've been running auctions more frequently, enough for now, I suppose. They don't have enough hours to go around. That's the story anyhow, but the truth is that they're cheap asses. They could have one or two more people on til 5pm everyday if they really wanted to.    Eating : Nachos, nachos, nachos. My diet is awful. I eat too much cheese and drink too much soda (Fusion).     Feeling : Anxiously, nervously, awaiting my tax refund which is supposed to be in by Friday, but I'm hoping it comes earlier. However, there's still a possibility that it won't come at all because the question they asked for my electronic signature, given the available answers to choose from, wasn't exactly correct. I hate the not-knowing, and I'm anxious to spend the money and pay off some debts. I'm hoping to have a great weekend, and the extra money is critical. My older nephew is supposed to come down, it's NBA All-Star weekend, and we're going to watch basketball, chow down, and hopefully, hit some flea markets, Goodwills, pawn shops, and whatnot. It should be a fun ass weekend!

        Monday... So Far   Today started out really crappy. I woke up an hour before my alarm was supposed to go off, then barely slept at all the next hour. I felt like crap when I finally got up. Mom stayed home today, so I managed to make it to work only 5 minutes late. Afetr getting there I found that they'd changed my schedule since I left on Friday. Now they had me working until 5pm today, which normally would be fine, but I almost called in sick today because of how I was feeling and only went in because it was a short day (til 2pm). My cranky boss gave me a hard time about leaving, questioning me about why I wanted to go, where I'd be going, and then making some snide remark about me using the time to "play", like any of it is his business. So I left at 2pm as  I'd planned. Mom got me and we went over to Goodwill where I bought 6 cassette tapes (Beatles "Sgt.Pepper", Aldo Nova "Aldo Nova", Billy Squier "Emotions In Motion", The Byrds "Greatest Hits", The Hollies "Anthology", and The Monkees "Then And Now ... The Best Of"), a book (" urlLink Once A Warrior King " by David Donovan), and 2 padded Maxell cassette tape cases. Grand total: $8.75. I'm not sure, but I think the Billy Squier and Beatles tapes may be bad. It may just be the B deck of my cassette player that is going bad or needs cleaned. Afetr Goodwill, we stopped off at a Greek restaurant I'd never been to before ("Athenian Gardens", I think) and got a gyro and a greek salad for just $6.20. It was awesome! The gyro was struffed, and the salad was pretty good sized and was pretty tasty too. I will have to go back there again. I chowed down! After lunch, I got the mail and was happy to see a payment from a late paying bidder in there, until I opened it. The guy is from Germany, and apparently, he decided that paying me Euros would be a good idea. It wasn't. I needed the money badly too... very disappointing.

        Sunday   Today was kind of crappy, though it should have been great. My mom, my nephew, my sister and I went over to  urlLink Lowery Park Zoo , over in Tampa. I had never been there before, everyone else had though. I loved it, but my nephew was a real pain in the ass. He was more interested in climbing the railings and running than in the animals there. He doesn't listen, doesn't follow directions, and it's probably due to my sister just not disciplining him at all. I would have beat his ass today, but all he got was many, many talkings to. Besides him being a problem, my Mom had trouble walking so I had us all sit down for an extended, and way overpriced, lunch which caused us to lose a lot of time. We ran out of time and missed out on the petting zoo and a few rides for the boy. I did have fun there though. I loved seeing the two Florida Panthers they had there (who were agitated by the presence of a Leopard in a cage behind theirs), a Red Wolf (who was running the perimeter of his enclosure, which was right next to the Deer area), a huge Buffalo (who was itching him head on tall tree, making it sway, he was so powerful), a  urlLink Sumatran Tiger  (a little on the skinny side, who was roaring a bit), two  urlLink Manatees  (one was eating lettuce, the other kept doing underwater revolutions, spins), and a  urlLink Black Bear  (who was sleeping in a hollowed out tree trunk). I loved the Bald Eagle too, it was gorgeous! They had some Orangutangs and some Chimpanzees there too, but it was sad seeing them in the zoo like that, not looking happy at all. I loved the Manatee area though, with it's reptile displays (they had a bunch of different Rattlesnalkes) and underwater view (with various fish, turtles, ducks, and Manatees), but the area that had the Panthers, Wolf, Bear, Alligators, Owl, and Flamingoes was my favorite. There was supposed to be a Grey Fox in the Bear area too, but I didn't see him at all. The Otters were MIA too. The freakiest thing there was in the Free-Flight Bird Aviary area. they have an spot where you can go upsatairs for a better view and I was up there looking at the various birds and their nests when someone there pointed out that, hanging up above our heads, were bats. That gave me the willies! Everytime I got under a roof there, for the rest of the day, I looked up, checking for bats. I think Austin liked the Sting Ray petting area the best, since he didn't want to leave there (and only left after I threatened to spank him in front of everyone there). So anyway, it was a fun trip, though not a perfectly happy time was had. It got worse when we got home though. Austin, my nephew, was doing something he shouldn't have been doing and wound up breaking my Mom's door down, which pissed me off  a great deal . That door was a bitch to hang, and i didn't appreciate him tearing it off the hinges because of his horseplay. Did my sister yell at him? Smack his ass? Nope. She said "he didn't do it on purpose!" and came to his defense,  comforting him . Maybe she'd like to hang the goddamned door for me, because I sure as hell don't know how I'm going to do it now. He ripped a chunk out of the doorframe, where I'd have to put the hinges, and it split the wood. He left without saying goodbye to me. Never apologized either. Didn't have to, I guess, seeing as how "he didn't do it on purpose". What a crock.

        The Weekend Is Here!   I picked up 3 extra hours at work on Friday and was also told I'd be given a new pair of work shoes, which'll save me about $30. Not a bad day! Later that night I started to read Stephen King's "Danse Macabre", but I don't think I'm going to finish it. I didn't know it was a book about the horror genre, a scholarly essay on it. The back cover made it sound like another great Stephen King horror novel, very disappointing. I don't know what I'm going to read next. I read "Death Of A Salesman" the preceding two days (I would  love  to see it done onstage sometime).  On Saturday, my 5 year old nephew, Austin, came down to visit. We took a bus to a big thrift shop and I bought him 5 shirts (cost only $8.50) including a tie-dye, an Orlando Magic shirt, and a Florida Gators shirt. After that, we walked across the street to Marbo's, a chinese restaurant, and I chowed down! He hardly ate a bite (a total waste of money). After dinner, we had to wait for the bus out in the cold (50 degrees) for about 1/2 an hour, which sucked. Later, after we got home and warmed up, we sat down and watched "The Lord Of The Rings - Fellowship Of The Rings". I really loved the special effects in this movie. It's just too bad they left in so many Hollywood action-adventure cliches. Still, I'm hoping to catch the 2nd one while it's still in the theatres.    On a sad note, I found out soon after I woke up that the Space Shuttle Columbia and her crew perished in the skies over Texas today. Very sad, tragic news. As I said ealier today in my SNL news group, sometimes it's taken for granted just how dangerous and how important an astronaut's life is, and sadly, it takes disasters like this to remind people. The people who died in the sky over Texas today were more than just astronauts, more than just people with families and lives of their own, they were also symbols of America's pioneer spirit, of freedom, of progress, and of dreams. Their loss today, is our loss. A nationwide loss. A worldwide loss.    My heartfelt condolences go out to their families and friends, as well as to the folks at NASA.

        Sleepy Sunday   I spent almost the entire day on the living room couch going in and out of sleep while CNN war coverage played on the TV. I've felt shitty all day and night, no energy whatsoever. Later at night, I half-watched "Legally Blonde" (predictable, formula chick flick) and then talked on the PC with my friend Sue awhile. After that I put on "Dirty Work" (Norm MacDonald's movie) and am half-watching that. There are some funny parts, but it has a thrown-together-at-the-last-moment feel, not great. In between the couch, the computer, and the movies, I ate lunch, dinner, and had a few peices of rum cake. I guess I'm going to head to bed shortly. Well... that's my day.. very lame.

        Is It Me?   I am not very happy with my sister right now. She was supposed to come down on Saturday with two of her kids to "celebrate my Birthday", but instead she came down and treated herself to a day at the beach, a mini-shopping spree, and dinner out. First off, she had mentioned to my Mom earlier in the week that they'd like to go to the beach in the early afternoon and talked about me coming along with them. Well they went to the beach (Sand Key), but I didn't get to go. My sister never called and asked if I wanted to come along (I did), and never stopped by to see if I wanted to go or anything. I waited until 4:30pm before they finally showed up here from the beach. Since they were all sandy and were going to shower anyway, I asked my niece to help me out in the yard for a few minutes first, to sort and bag a pile of trimmings from the other day. My sister came out and weeded the planter while me and my niece bagged the trimmings. It was cool that they helped out. I played out in the yard with my nephew a bit, killing ants and destroying ant hills. After a bit, we went out for dinner at the Chicago Grill & Dog House, but first, we stopped at  Target where my sister bought stuff for herself and my nephew, then at Payless Shoe Stores where she bought shoes for herself and my niece. This is when I started getting really pissed off at my sister. She didn't get me anything for my Birthday, not even a card, yet, she bought my nephew two more action figures that he really doesn't need (and whose behavior clearly didn't merit recieving two new toys...he does what he wants, when he wants) and sandals for my niece, which she really didn't have to have (although she does deserve something special for having a straight A report card). I don't recall, when did the the tradition of giving gifts on Birthdays get abolished? What happened to gift-giving? What happened to tradition? What happened to Birthdays being the day you show your love and appreciation for the person whose Birthday it is? I understood her not giving gifts at Christmas, with three kids to buy for and all, but I do not understand why she couldn't put herself out for me on my Birthday. Target had CDs. She couldn't spend $10 fucking dollars on her brother? I mean, is it me? Am I wrong on this? I felt totally disrespected. To make me feel even less important, the two kids made cards for me and didn't even bother to bring them along. My sister, knowing she wasn't going to do shit for me anyway, should have made sure to at least bring those along. But no, that didn't happen. Happy Birthday to me! After she finished her shopping spree, we went to dinner at the Chicago Grille & Dog House where I finally got the Tamales I'd been wanting all week. Unfortunately, my Mom wound up paying for everyone's dinners, which I had told her earlier that she should not have to do. So, to sum up, the way my sister "celebrated my Birthday", was to spent the day at the beach without me, spent part of the evening shopping for herself, and then enjoyed a nice dinner on my Mom. I don't know, maybe she was confused. Maybe she thought it was  her  Birthday. I don't know when she became such an inconsiderate asshole, but I'm glad I only have one Birthday a year to get shit on.

        I Had A Birthday...   I did have a Birthday on Thursday, but didn't really do any Birthday stuff. I wound up working out in the yard all day, cleaning up Palm fronds and screening that my Brother-In-Law left behind (he cleaned up our Palm trees and started re-screening the porch). I worked on our front planter; trimming bushes (nasty ass Holly), pulling weeds, and cutting down trees that are beginning to take root in there in and grow (Palms and Oaks). John Paul called to wish me a Happy Birthday and let me know that practice was called off that night. I wasn't too disappointed; the yard work had my hands all sore. I had wanted Tamales for my Birthday dinner, but wound up eating BBQ chicken instead. Later, Mom took me to Big Lots and I bought myself a few things (CD storage cases, 2 videos, a Hendrix CD, some Boo-Berry cereal, toothpaste, tea bags...some stuff Mom was buying, but I wound up paying for everything) and then treated Mom to ice cream and myself to a Lemon milkshake at Missing Links. It seemed more like her Birthday than mine. The kids called me to wish me a Happy Birthday though, that was nice, and I Instant Messaged with Sue for awhile, which was also cool. For the most part though, my 34th Birthday was pretty much ...eh.

        Lately, I've been...    Listening to : I picked up several new CDs lately and have been listening to them: Dave Attell - "Skanks For The Memories" (hilarious!), Tenacious D (finally got it! great stuff!), Eddie Izzard - "Definite Article", and Jimi Hendrix - "Midnight Lightning/Crash Landing" (a Russian 2-on-1 deal). I also picked up a few others that I haven't gotten to listen to yet including a new Paul Simon compilation, Pete Droge - "Necktie Second", The White Stripes - "De Stilj", and Richard Thompson - "Across A Crowded Room". I picked up the Droge and Thompson CDs while Pawnshopping today ($4 each).    Reading : Still nothing. I have a few books I'm dying to start too (my Second City book and a Vietnam War book I bought long ago). I will probably start readng again next week (hopefully).    Watching on TV : CNN mainly, War coverage. I've also been watching Colin Quinn's "Tough Crowd" and Bill Maher's "Real Time", both of which deal with political issues and The War. For comic relief I've been watching "Everybody Loves Raymond" and "Da Ali G Show". I also watched "This Is Spinal Tap - Special Edition", which I bought at Big Lots on my Birthday. That's about it lately, just lot and lots of CNN.   Downloading : Nothing. I've been buying what I want on CD and haven't been listening to much otherwise.   Playing : Still playing my goofy old Connect Four handheld game at bedtime.    Working : Took most of this past week off, no idea what my schedule looks like for next week yet. My main manager hassled me about taking time off this week. I could have easily taken the entire week off. He always makes some smart assed comment about me being "independently wealthy" whenever I take time off, as if I were totally dependant on that shitty job for money. I think I'm going to start looking for a better job soon. There's a Costco up on 19 that is going to be opening soon and it looks like they're paying $10 an hour to start. I certainly could use that kind of money right about now, no idea what the shifts/hours are like though.    Eating : Between my Birthday and being on vacation, I've been eating garbage, delicious garbage. We had Pizza from Mike's tonight (they gave us free brownie's with it), and tomorrow, it looks like I'll be eating Tamales for dinner.    Feeling : Not quite as anxious as before, but worried though, more about the state of The World more than my own personal problems though.    Planning : Thinking on getting a better job still, thinking on moving eventually, thinking, thinking, thinking, but likely no action in the immediate future. If my sister's family moves further North and my Mom goes too, I will need to start doing things on my own, and that's going to take some hard planning, some hard work, and some hard getting used to.

        Mini-Vacation Begins ... Now!   Yay!!!! I'm on vacation!!! Yay!!!! Yay!!!! Yay for me!!!! I worked all day today then I came home and worked all night... I am ready for that vacation! I have 5 full days off now, but they are jam-packed (as I noted yesterday).   I didn't go out tonight as planned; Al couldn't make it and I don't think JP really wanted to go very much, which worked out well for me as I wanted to list some auctions tonight (and did). JP said he may back out of Thursday's jam too (no drummer, and Al's not sure if he can make it). I suggested playing here, just me and him, but it sounded like he didn't want to play at all. He's too busy outside of the band. I don't know how he ever expects to do much with the band if he can't make time to practice  at least  once a week. I'm pushing for twice a week, myself. If it were up to me, we'd be playing four nights a week, every week. You don't get tight playing two hours a week together.   I am still working on getting my stuff together musically (equipmentwise and songwise), and I think I am going to go my own way as soon as I can. I might work with him and do my own thing on the side too...whatever works. I would love to quit Wendys and make a living just playing music and selling stuff online. I hate having a boss (boss es , actually), I hate having to get up early (ok, early  for me ) to go to a job that bores me, I hate having to wear a stupid uniform, I hate having to shave everyday (ok, twice a week), and I hate dealing with stupid people on a daily basis.  Self-employment is the only way to go.

        Monday, Payday   I got paid today, not much, but I gots me a bottle of Jack Daniels and a 12 pack of Pepsi, so I'm doing a'ight. Don't know when I'll get into it though; tomorrow I'm supposed to go out with JP and Al to Boomers for their open mic night (to look for a drummer). We also may practice at JP's work for a while on acoustics in case we want to play a few songs at Boomers (I really don't). Thursday is my Birthday, but I'm supposed to practice with JP and Al over at Circle that night. Friday, I'll probably be going up to New Port Richey to buy envelopes and hit Pawn shops (and possibly to bring my niece or younger nephew down), and Saturday, my sister and two of her kids (my older nephew can't come, he'll be away playing in an All-Star basketball game in Orlando) are supposed to come down for my Birthday, but like I said, we may have one of them down a little earlier. Sunday is my auction night, so that pretty much leaves only Wednesday to drink some Jack and chill (I still have a full bottle of wine in the fridge too). I am off from 5pm Tuesday night until 11:30 am Monday morning. I took some time off to get stuff done around the house, but it looks now like I should have just taken the whole week off. We're supposed to have company down from Pennsylvania next week (a cousin and her family) or the week after and the house is an absolute shithole. My Mom is off all this week too (I didn't know that when I took the time off), but it's not likely that she'll get too much done on her own. Plus there's that whole War thing. I have a feeling it's not going to be a very relaxing week. I'm probably going to need some Jack Daniels before it's over.

        Weekend War Watching   I spent almost the entire weekend on my couch watching The War unfold un CNN. I stopped for a little while on Saturday and tried to hook up my 4 track recorder, but I couldn't get it to do what I wanted and I couldn't find the manual, so back to the couch I went. I stayed up until nearly 5am last night watching a 4 hour battle (at the Iraqi port city Umm Qasr)  as it happened . I was tired as hell, but I couldn't go to bed until I knew we had it under control. I don't think I'd have the patience to be a good soldier; I would've wanted to go in immediately and get it over with.   A lot of things happened in The War this weekend, but one of the biggest stories was the capture and exploitation of 5 American POWs. Iraqi TV (and also Al-Jazeera TV) aired footage of the five captured US soldiers as well as footage of several dead American soldiers, some of which appear to have been executed (shot in the forehead & abdomen), which, of course outraged US officials. The video wasn't show on TV here, with the excepion of it being shown on "Face The Nation"; apparently the powers that be don't think we Americans can't handle uncensored/unsanitized news. They did the same thing with the Daniel Pearl video. I think it's a dangerous thing, sanitizing the news like that, getting to see only what certain people want us to see. I'm sure a lot of people might even change their stance on The War if they actually had to face the ultimate reality of war: death. The same goes for all forms of Capital Punishment as well; it's one thing to support ideas, ideals, but seeing the real truth behind them is a whole 'nother thing.   Some other events that happened this weekend have been simply unbelievable. US troops shot down a UK plane (killing UK two pilots), a US soldier (a Muslim) threw grenades into the tents of his brigade's commanders (killing one, injuring many), we accidentally shot missiles into Turkey and Iran (though now it appears that it was Iraq who fired into Iran), we got shelled when Iraqis, who appeared to be surrendering, opened fire instead (this apparently happened on two separate occasions this weekend), and we lost several soldiers when they drove down the wrong street and were ambushed (these include the 5 POWs who appeared on Iraqi TV). A lot of terrible, costly errors.   It is after 2am early Monday morning, and US troops are just outside of Baghdad (last report said 60 miles), so things are going to be getting very hot, very soon. Monday should be a very eventful day, to say the least, and with the exception of a few hours (I have to work and run to the bank), I will likely be on the couch watching all day long.   Peace.

        Da War   Not to trivialize it with my title, but the War in Iraq has officially begun. I have very mixed feelings about it. On one hand, Hussein is a very bad man and certainly should not remain in leadership. On the other hand, I question Bush's motives for going into Iraq, for putting our soldiers lives on the line. At first, Bush claimed that it was Hussein's connection to Bin Laden and the Al Queda organization that was his motivation for going into Iraq, then, after it was obvious that the connection between Hussein and Bin Laden was dubious at best, his reasoning changed. Now, the reason for going into Iraq was because Hussein has ignored UN resolutions and refused to disarm. It was to be a pre-emptive strike, to prevent Hussein from doing naughty things in the future. This part, I'm with. The last thing America (or the rest of the world, for that matter) needs is a nation with nuclear, chemical and biological weaponry and an eagerness to sell them to people eager to use them. If we were certain he has those weapons, he should be taken out. he's a legitimate threat. However, after getting support from only a few nations, and facing much resisitance from most, Bush's reasons seemed to have changed again. Now, it's all about bringing freedom to the Iraqi people. But it's also more than that. In his spoeech the other night, one of the first things he had to say to the people of Iraq was "do not burn your oil wells". The following day, after the first strike had occurred, I heard on CNN that there is a plan for the next Iraqi regime to be installed has agreed to let US oil companies come over and take over oil production in Iraq. I'm not a big believer in "coincedence", and seeing that Bush is a Texas oil man, this whole "oil" thing really makes me suspicious of his true motives. Oil for blood is not someting I would or could support, so I'm not wholly for or against this war because I just don't have enough facts to decide one way or another. However, as far as the troops go, I will support them and hopefully, they'll all make it home safely and soon. Only time will tell for sure exactly how Bush's War will play out, whether he was right or wrong, whether his motives were good or bad.   I've been tuned in to CNN everyday since the War has begun, tuning out to watch a little basketball, Bill Maher's show, and "Da Ali G Show" (it can't all be war, war, war). I was blown away from some of the reporting this time out (I followed Desert Strom very closely as well). I was impressed by the telephone camera traveling with the 3rd of the 7th Cavalry (Garry Owens unit, the one I was named after, which my Dad was with in Vietnam), rolling into Baghdad along with the tanks. Also the footage from Baghdad was amazing. I mean, actually seeing the bombs hitting their targets from right inside enemy territory? Unreal. However, I do think some of the reporting crosses the line into irresponsible journalism. I don't think they should be intervieing the soldiers and pilots at this time, distracting them. They are on a mission and need to stay focused. Cover the war, follow the soldiers, but do not interfere looking for a story or a subplot. We'll be watching it anyway, no need to search for additional drama. There is nothing more dramatic than war itself.  As I mentioned, I turned off CNN and watched Real Time with Bill Maher tonight, and I must say, that show really made me proud to be an American. I was very impressed with Maher's class; instead of bashing Bush (which he had been doing before the war began), he chose instead to express support for the soldiers. He interviewed 3 veterans (one from WWII and Korea, one from Vietnam, and one from the Gulf War) and delved into subjects like healthcare for veterans (or lack thereof) and the differences between the generations. It was very informative, very interesting, and very important. He went on to have a panel discussion which included Tim Robbins, who is very much Anti-war, and the whole discussion was captivating. They expressed and exchanged opinions, actually  talked , said things that mattered, all the while respecting each other's opinions. It really made me proud that I am an American, that we have that freedom to express ourselves, to discuss things that matter to us, openly and freely. It was really moment of bonding, and I sense that the audience felt that way too, because when he broke from the panel to the next scheduled bit, the audience didn't seem ready to go yet. I certainly didn't. Bil Maher handled a touchy subject with care and class and I appreciate what he did on his show tonight.   Peace.

        Da Weekend   My niece, Dana, came down for the weekend. We went to go pick her up Friday night and din't get back home with her until about 9pm. We stopped at Wok Out on the way home and got some Chinese food. I tried something different this time, Shrimp Lo Mein, and liked it a lot. I also had a Shrimp Eggroll, Snow Pea Pods (which Dana and I shared), and some awesome Ma-Cau-Skee Fried Rice. We chowed down!   Actually, we chowed down all weekend. Saturday night, we went out to the Chicago Grill & Dog House and had Beef Sandwiches and Tamales, and Mom had a Teriyaki Chicken. As soon as we got home, Dana ran for the bathroom; I think the tamale did her in! They were nice and spicy hot!   Dana spent almost all day Saturday working on her Math project for school. I helped her when she needed help, but mostly laid on the couch all day, half-sleeping. We played Rummy later that night (I won, as usual) then watched Saturday Night Live together (Salma Hayek/Christina Aguilera). It was a pretty good show! During Aguilera's first song, I switched over to "Da Ali G Show" and watched it for a few minutes. I showed Dana some of his stuff on Friday night too, after we got done playing "Beach Head 2000". I don't think she liked the game much, but she liked Ali G.   On Sunday, I worked with Dana on finishing up her Math Project (a 3-page report about Hypatia, and a Word Search). We finally got it all done. She should get an "A" on it (hopefully). After we finished with that, we went out on the porch and played "Crazyball". It's a game we play with paddles and a warped rubber ball. The "Crazy" part comes from the warped ball; you never know which way it is going to bounce! We had fun doing that. We played until her Grandma and Mom picked her up around 4pm. They had her brothers with them and I got to mess with them for a few minutes before they all split.   We really didn't get to do too much fun stuff this weekend due to the Math project, mostly just ate. Besides Chinese food and Chicago Grill, Mom picked up donuts on Saturday and ice cream on Sunday. I kind of figured it was going to be that way, what with all of the schoolwork she had to do. She had 2 other projects that we didn't get to. She may be back down in a couple of weeks to work on them too. Next week, we may have her two brothers while the others go to a bridal shower. The boys are usually a pain-in-the-ass when they're down together, so I'm going to try to just get one of them, unless it's just for the day, then I can handle that.

        Lately, I've been...     Listening to : To the Jack Bruce and Eddie Izzard CD's I got on eBay, mainly (Jack Bruce's "Monkjack" and "Somethinels", Eddie Izzard's "Unrepeatable").    Reading :  Well, I've been reading the latest Guitar World, but that's about it. I just haven't been in the mood to read lately.    Watching on TV :  "Everybody Loves Raymond", "The Simpsons", "Seinfeld", "Fear Factor", "Saturday Night Live", "Da Ali G Show", "Real Time with Bill Maher", "Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn", "The Dave Chapelle Show", "South Park", and "Insomniac with Dave Attell". I'm also watching Letterman's show tonight; he's out sick and Will Ferrell is hosting it!   Downloading :  I downloaded some of the songs we went over in practice tonight, but that's about it. I just haven't been doing much downloading lately. For the most part, I bought most of the stuff I'd want to hear anyway.    Playing : Not practicing everyday like I should, but a couple times a week I'll play for a half hour to an hour. I've also been getting to play with JP and Al for 2 hours a week, which is great for me! Gamewise, I've been playing the hell out of my old handheld Connect Four game at bedtime. I played a bit of Beach Head 2000 this week too. I can't wait to get my nephew Jesse down to show him that one, he'll love it!   Working : Not working a lot of hours, and liking that. I've been tired as shit lately (not sleeping well at night), so the short hours are a blessing. They put me on for a few extra next week. I usually have Wednesdays off, but they didn't give it to me this week or next either.     Eating :  The wrong shit, as always. Plus, I drank a small bottle of Jack Daniels this week (over three days). I'll drink a small glass of Jack & Pepsi and that'll do me for the night. I'm glad I've learned not to overdo it. It's no fun getting too drunk.    Feeling :  Upbeat for the most part, still a lot of anxiety though. I get to make music with other people now, so that helps to pick me up. I'm buying equipment and clothes for playing out with a band, so things are moving in the right direction, but slowly. I think I'll always be somewhat depressed as long as I'm fat, I just don't like myself like this and it keeps me alone.    Planning : This weekend, my niece is coming down. We'll go get Friday night and bring her home on Sunday night. Not too sure what we'll be doing yet. She has a bunch of school projects she wanted me to help her with, so a lot of time will be spent working, I guess. Neither of us really have any dough right now, so that limits what we can do too. I'd like to take her to the Renaissance Fair, but that's $14 each and you need money to do things there. I'd also like to take her to the new Chicago Dog place on East Bay. They have some killer tamales there, and their Chicago Dogs are kickass. I'd like to try their beef sandwich and their Reuben sandwich sometime too. Maybe we can hit Goodwill or some pawn shops or something. Again though, stuff that requires money. We'll see what happens.

        Jam Night   I jammed with Al and JP again tonight, still no drummer though. Al and JP switched on and off on bass, we'll still need a bassist too, unless one of them wants the job. We actually did some "work", going over several covers (Jimmy Eat World's "The Middle", Tom Petty's "American Girl", and The Ramones' "I Wanna Be Sedated", Eric Clapton's "Before You Accuse Me", and Stevie Ray Vaughan's "Cold Shot") and working on a few originals, including the two I introduced last time. JP wrote a new chorus for my reggae-ish song in A, but I'm not sure about what he added as it changes the whole feel of the song (I wanted a really mellow, peaceful, dreamy song). We'll have to work on it some more. We went over a couple of JP's songs too. I wanted to jam on a couple more of mine that I'd been priming this week, but we never got around to it.

        Waiting, Waiting, Waiting...To Rock!   I have the money for the expensive guitar pedal I want, but none of the eBay auctions for it go off until tomorrow night. It's killing me. I am so anxious to have this thing in my hands, though with eBay, there's no guarantee I'll even win it. Luckily, there are a couple of them on this week. What it is is a Foxrox Captain Coconut 2 pedal, which will give me  the  Hendrix sound. It's really 3 pedals in 1: an Octavia, a Univibe, and a Fuzz. I already have a Wah, so if I can get this pedal, I will be abale to emulate, and hopefully build on, the Hendrix sound. I can't wait! The pedal costs $399 new, but they've sold on eBay for as low as $300, which is about what I'm counting on.  I'm supposed to jam again on Thursday. I can't wait! I have a few more of my own songs I want to introduce this time, and hopefully jam on. John said he wrote lyrics and some music for my reggae-ish tune in A. I hope it fits with what I had in mind. We may have a drummer this time too, which would be awesome! It should be fun. I'm probably going to play through JP's miked up Fender amp rather than through the Marshall amp this time; my tone sucked horribly last time. I'll have to bring along my fuzz face for distortion. I should bring my tuner too, I forgot it last time. I'm ready to rock, baby!

        The Headache From Hell   GodDAMN! My head is killin' me ova heah! I went in to work today and the place was filled with smoke again, like it was several months back. The ventilation hoods over the fryers weren't working and that kept all of the fumes and smoke in the kitchen for us all to breathe in (one girl is pregnant, that can't be good). It was awful, choking, stuff. I was coughing quite a bit and that gave me a big headache. Luckily, I had a short shift again today. After work, I took a bus to the bank to cash my paycheck and the bus had a vibration problem, shaking like mad when it stopped. This helped to make my headache worse and it aggravated my ears. Later, I played guitar awhile and that also made my head and ears continue aching. I took an Aleve a few minutes ago, hopefully that'll knock it out. If not, I'm headed for bed.

        What's Up   I finally got to jam! Yay!! Me, John and Al got together at Circle Studios and played for about 2 hours. We started off with one of John's songs, "Free Spirit", but pretty much the rest of the time was spent on my stuff. John started coming up with lyrics for two of my songs (an uptempo song in B and my mellow reggae-ish song in A) and I added a solo section to "Free Spirit" that may or may not remain (Al said it sounded like Santana). We also jammed on my funky D jam (D7-G9-C9). I played ok, but not as good as I can. Most of the problem was the PA, but the bass (Al played bass on my stuff) was a little too overbearing, and I could hardly hear the amp I was playing from (a Marshall 1/2 stack). We really needed drums to get everything flowing better. It was awesome playing again. The jam situation is me in my element, I love it! We're supposed to jam again next week...can't wait!  Been buying a lot on eBay lately....I had some real steals this week. I won a Jack Bruce CD, "Monkjack", which is out of print, for just $5.75 (which includes shipping). Oh, I forgot to mention that it is still sealed  and  it's a Japanese pressing! What a deal! I also won a brand new book, "Second City" (the history of the Second City comedy troupe), which comes with 2 CDs of Second City sketches (featuring a ton of SNL folks) for just $9.29 (which includes shipping)! Tonight, I won a new, unopened box of Fender guitar strings (12 packs) for just $34 (includes shipping). That's less than $3 a pack! Sweet! eBay is freakin'  addictive !

        Monday Night Getogether   I went out to Limey's with John and Al on Monday night. They had an open mic night and they wanted to check it out and also talk about playing together (which I think was a waste, when we could've just p[layed together). There were some talented people playing there, but none were very impressive. The first guy on is in a band called "I Alive" and he sounds just like almost any other singer out there today trying to sing in that Eddie Vedder/Dave Matthews (growling, screaming, hiccuping) mix ala Creed and so many others. I bores me and also makes me wonder how they can fake that over-emotionalism night in and night out. The second guy looked like he wandered in from an '80's metal band. He was ok, but definitely not a singer. The third guy was quite older than the rest, maybe late 40's. He started off with a Hendrix song "Up From The Skies") and had a good voice and played well, but he stayed on too long (he must've done about 10 or 12 songs, whereas everyone else did about 3 or 4) and didn't emote enough personality or charisma as to hold the crowd's attention. By the end of his set nobody was listening to him, or even looking towards him, but were all conversing with each other and had their backs to him. The guy after him was OK. He had a Ben Harper thing going for him, but the stuff he was writing definitely needed a bass or a lead guitar in it to help fill in sonic gaps, it went on too long repeating the same chord changes, plus I couldn't make out anything he sung. It looked like he was going to keep on playing for awhile and so we split during his set. I find it hard to believe that this is a scene John wants to join in on. I really don't find the idea of playing to people's backs very enticing. I'd much rather blow people away with rock power, than bore them to tears with acoustic doldrums. I had 2 Jack and Cokes while I was there, but didn;t get buzzed or anything. I hadn't drank alcohol for so long, I figured 2 drinks would have done me in! On the way there, John's wife, Doris, was on the cel phone blabbing away (quite loudly, actually) and never spoke a word to me, not even a "hello". I really hate cel phones. They are a pet peeve of mine, them and the people who use them like they're in their own little world, like they don't have acknowledge or be polite to the people around them because they're "on the phone". After we got our drinks and sat down, she became more cordial and we all joked around a bit. Al met us there after awhile and he was pretty cool to joke around with too. Other than the smoke and the boring music, I had a pretty good time. We're supposed to get together next week and jam, so that will be cool.

        Lately, I've been...    Listening to : I've listened to my new Eddie Izzard CD's ("Glorious" and "Dress To Kill"), my new Bloodrock CDs ("Bloodrock" and "Bloodrock 2"), and my Doyle Bramhall II "Jellycream" CD. I love the Izzard and Bramhall stuff, and there are a few good songs on the Bloodrock CDs, especially "Fantastic Piece Of Architecture" and "Melvin Laid An Egg" from the first album, and "D.O.A." from the second.   Reading : Still nothing at all. Been playing my Poker handheld game before bedtime.   Watching on TV : "Everybody Loves Raymond", "Saturday Night Live", Basketball (NBA), Robert Klein "Child In His 50's", "Seinfeld", "The Simpsons", "Fear Factor", the last Tyson "fight" (against Etienne), "Insomniac with Dave Attell", "Dave Chappelle's Show", and "Real Time with Bill Maher". I'm so glad Bill is back on TV, his voice and opinion should definitely be out there, especially nowadays. I've also been watching lots of CNN Headline News, waiting for the inevitable war with Iraq that Bush is pushing for.    Downloading : Nothing lately.    Playing : Mainly my handheld Poker game before bed. I've also played "Beachhead 2000" a bit, and I've done a couple crossword puzzles from a program I found (I've had it in my room for years and forgot all about it).    Working : See the previous post....missed two days this week. We have some new lady at work, Samantha. She seems to be a bit of a crackhead or wacko or something. Not quite right in the head.    Eating : Starting today, I am going to cut back again on cheese, milk, soda, fried foods, fast foods, eggs, bread, and other stuff that I probably shouldn't be eating anyway. I was doing ok for awhile, but then I fell back into my old ways. I've also been chowing on my Samoas, the girl scout cookies. It's that time of year again, and I've gone through 4 1/2 boxes in the last week.    Feeling : Anxious, as per usual, just waiting for things to happen.    Planning : Going out on Monday with John Paul and Al to discuss "the band", jamming, and whatever. Hopefully we will actually get together and play sometime next week. Still haven't heard anymore from Curtis. I think we could have meshed well musically.

        Why Do I Keep Fucking Up?   Not just a Neil Young song, but my current mantra as well. I start going good and then WHAMMO ...another fuck up! I missed a whole week of work 2 weeks ago, and since then I was doing fine (late still, but no missed days) and then WHAMMO ...I miss Thursday and Friday this week. Thursday I woke up tired, groggy, and late. I would've been 1/2 hour late for work anyway, plus it was rainy out, and I had barely slept all night (anxious about playing with my friend's band), so I called in sick (they had extra people at work anyway). When you miss as much as me, missing even one more day is bad, but then had to miss on Friday as well. A storm on Thursday knocked out my cable modem and I couldn't get online at all. I have a bunch of auctions running and a side deal in the works, so it was imperitive that I get back online immediately. Of course, the best they could do timewise was between 12 and 6pm on Friday. Naturally, I was scheduled to work 11:30am to 5pm, so WHAMMO ...fucked again. I can only imagine the things they must say about me at Wendys. "Why is he still working here?" "What a dick." "Can't we just fire him?" "Sick ...again? Yeah, right!" "He missed because  his computer isn't working ?" I can't say I'd blame them either.      My Musical Dilemma   I mentioned something about playing with my friend's band. John got ahold of me and wants to get me into his band. His band actually broke up and he's in the process of getting another one together again. Unfortunately, I have very low expectations for this  incarnation because he's not fixing all of his problems. His lead guitar player from the 1st incarnation of his band doesn't play lead all that well (he's a much better rhythm guitar player), so John wants to bring me in on lead. But, John has never told the guitar player what he thinks of his playing and seems insistant on keeping him around. This is going to cause many problems. For starters, my playing style as a guitarist is to play rhythm and lead as if it were the same thing. I don't really want or need a 2nd guitarist, and if I did, I could just use John, who also plays guitar. So I'm going to have to conform my style to play with the other guitarist who isn't very good to begin with (not that I'm all that either). On top of that, since John can't tell the guy that his playing isn't so great, John wants me to let the guy do some of the leads too. I have a feeling that whole situation is going to be very, very touchy. To make matters even worse, John has already suggested that me and the other guy may have to switch off and on on bass as well. This was a major problem with his original lineup, where he had a keyboard player who took turns on the bass with the lead player and their rhythm player. One guy, one instrument; that's the way I'd prefer it to be. Also, he's talking about doing some acoustic gigs, which I have no desire whatsoever to do. I have a vision of what I want to do musically, and I know that John's style and vision is different than my own. If we can mesh everything, it might work, but that's a big "if" and with the other guitar player in he mix, it seems even less possible. I guess we'll jam and see what happens. I just want to play again, really. I'm even considering playing bass for my friend, just to be out playing. I know though, that over time, I would get irritated with the questionable lead playing. My friend already is, which is why I don't get keeping the other guy around. Problems, problems, problems...nothing's ever easy.

        Ugh!   So... I spent all morning (from 1:30am until 11am) wiping and reloading my computer with the help of Gateway's tech support. All had been going well, I was almost done loading everything and nearly ready to go online, when I ran into a problem and had to call tech support again. The other tech people had been great, I had been lucky, but my luck ran out this time. I knew almost immediately that she did not know what she was doing; she was having me do things that didn't have anything to do with the problem I called in about (my computer was starting up in normal mode, but it looked like safe mode because the display settings weren't set right). She had me delete drivers for sound and video (which caused problems), and she had me running around in circles of futility (everything she had me do led to the blue screen of death). She seemed totally clueless. I was getting angry and frustrated (I knew she was way off, plus she didn't appear to listening to me at all), and I almost hung up on her several times (so I could call back and get someone else to help me), but I figured she must have some knowledge that I didn't, being a tech support person and all, so I stayed with her. Eventually she had me take my computer apart and check the motherboard (again, nothing do with my original problem). She had me checking capacitors and I found a bad one, for the memory, and now I have to have a new motherboard shipped to me and then I have to redo everything all over again after it arrives (and after I can schedule a service person to come over and install it). Fuck... me. While I'm glad we discovered the bad capacitor, it may explain why my memory drains so fast and why I didn't notice any difference in my PC after I installed a bunch of extra memory (problems I've mentioned to other Gateway tech people before), my original problem was still unresolved. After I hung up, I thought about it and then went and fixed it myself. All I had to do was leave it the way it was, go forward and connect to the internet, then go to the Windows Update site and download a new display driver. Voila! Problem solved. I'm back online now and everything is running smoothly. I'm really not looking forward to doing this shit all over again.

        Back Online... For Now   I think it's official: I hate Time/Warner cable, or "Brighthouse", which is what they're calling themselves now. They supply my Roadrunner cable modem service. For the second time this year (we only switched to them this year), my service got knocked out and stayed out for almost three days. I had problems with Verizon from time to time, but I never lost service for more than two days. I run auctions on eBay and need to be able to communicate with potential bidders and auction winners. I went up to New Port Richey on Friday night, everything was fine, but when I returned early Saturday morning, I couldn't get online. We had had a big storm in the area and I guess it knocked the cable modem out (the cable TV worked fine). That's what happened last time too. They finally got everything up again around noon today, but now my computer is whacked-out. It looks like Windows ME has been corrupted. I can't play any of my MP3s (it says those file types are unsupported), I can't open my Outlook Express (it says I may be out of memory or my disk may be full...neither is true), and Windows now longer remembers any of my passwords, no matter how many times I put them in. There is also an Internet Explorer icon on my desktop that wasn't there on Friday, that I didn't put there, and that won't let me delete it. It looks like I'm going to have to wipe my computer ... again . I'm really pissed about that. So... I guess I will have to start on the wiping and reloading soon. Grrrrrr!!!!!!!   Here's a rundown of what I've been up to all weekend:   Friday   We drove up to New Port Richey in a rainstorm. The power went out at my sister's house shortly after we got there. My brother-in-law and me headed over to Bourbon Street to see tha Zebra concert after a bit. My friend Sue was supposed to go too, but she opted to fight me in a Kung-Fu showdown instead. Wuss! We got there at 7:30pm, but they still hadn't opened the doors yet. I saw 7:30pm on the  urlLink Bourbon Street website ; I didn't realize that was just the time the doors opened, I thought that's when the show started. Boy, was I wrong. There were a few other folks standing out in the rain too. I thought that was pretty jerky. They should have let us in instead of letting us get rained on. Eventually they let us in around 7:45. We sat around waiting for my sister to show up. She finally got there around 8:15. We ordered some food and drinks. I had jalapeno poppers (awesome...they served cheddar ones and cream cheese ones) and I ate some of their wings. They were weird tasting and pretty hot too, my sister didn't want hers, so I had a few. I only drank cokes (at $2 a pop), no alcohol. The first band, Cheeky Monkey, came on around 9pm. They were pretty good, the chick singer/guitarist especially, but their choice of cover tunes wasn't exactly my cup of tea (plus the chick seemed to sing about cocaine and getting high an awful lot...a problem there?). They must have played for at least an hour. We had good seats, at tables, right up front to the side, but as soon as Zebra got close to coming on, everybody made their way up there and blocked our view. I had to stand for the rest of the show... and it was a really long show. Zebra played for about three hours. They did everything off their first album, a bunch off their other two, some new ones from their forthcoming CD, a Montrose cover, and four Led Zeppelin covers ("The Ocean", and for their encore: "The Immigrant Song", "Black Dog", and "Rock-N-Roll")! They were awesome! I couldn't believe how well they transferred what they did on their albums to the live stage. I thought they would lose a lot, sonically, but that wasn't true at all. Randy Jackson, the lead singer/guitarist was hitting some amazing notes, vocally, and was tearing it up on the guitar. The drummer was a monster, way more impressive live than on CD. I couldn't believe just how good he was. Later in the set, he did a drum solo... it was intense. The bassist was great too. He played bass, sang back-up, played keyboards, and he even sang lead on a cover song, Montrose's "Rock Candy". He was really cool, very friendly (I got to talk to him very briefly). He said that after the show, the band would be hanging out and would sign autographs for everyone. How cool is that? Well, it would have been cool had everyone not bailed on me. My sister split around 11:45. She said she was tired. And my brother-in-law wanted to leave after Zebra left the stage the first time. I had to twist his arm to stay for their encore (the all Zeppelin encore). He bolted after that, so I don't even know if they played another encore. I was getting tired by then too, but I still wanted to stay. They weren't much fun to be with. When the bands were playing, they never moved, never smiled, never spoke...nothing. I had no idea whether they were enjoying the show or not. I think the only time my sister moved was to check her watch. I would have had a lot more fun if a certain someone hadn't of wussed out.    Saturday   We brought my nephew, Jesse, home with us. We left there around 2:30am, got home around 3:30am (after stopping at Walgreens). We stayed up a little after that and then crashed for the night. I didn't have any extra money this weekend, so I didn't get to do much with Jess. I took him to my band practice at 5pm. We jammed with that drummer, Larry, from Thursday night. He looked to be around his mid to late 40's, not as old or as grizzled as I had imagined. He was ok, did a good job, but wasn't very impressive. He'd be a solid, steady drummer and that's about it. Me, JP, and Al weren't at our best that day, all of us blowing parts during one song or another. I'd still have to say we're getting better each time out though. We played all of the songs we've done the last few times, plus I threw out "Hey Joe", just to have something to play. Larry said he had two other bands to try out for and he'd get back to us, which I'd imagine was his way of saying "thanks, but, no thanks". We may have another drummer this week, Jimmy, the old drummer for the band. He's really good. Jess looked like he was getting bored, but he said he had a good time and liked the music we played. On the way over, JP took a sharp left and his acoustic guitar case fell on Jesse's head. It hit pretty hard, but luckily, he was ok.  Jesse wound up playing a lot of Beach Head 2000 on my PC this weekend. I showed him how and he went to town on it. We went out to eat at Denny's (Jess had never been there) and we chowed down. I had a double cheeseburger and fries, plus a strawberry sundae. We usually never order dessert, but we did tonight. I wound up drinking Jesse's strawberry shake too. His eyes were bigger than his belly. I was stuffed. We watched basketball a little after we got home. We stayed up late on Saturday. At 3:30am, I was ready to hit the sack, but he wanted to watch "The Silence Of The Lambs", so we wound up staying up til nearly 6am.    Sunday   We didn't do much at all. I played with Jess a bit on the couch, playfighting. Jess played Beach Head 2000 for awhile and I watched basketball until I couldn't keep my eyes open any longer and went back to bed. I woke up at 10:30pm, and Jess was aleady gone.  I was sleepy all night. I had to be up at 8am for the cable guy on Monday, so I planned on staying up a little, and then going back to bed until 8am. I wound up staying up all night. Sunday was a total waste, but I did do a little laundry, so at least I did  something .   Oh yeah... JP called me today and I am definitely going to the Crosby, Stills, and Nash concert on Wednesday! Yes! Unfortunately, the ticket will cost me $85, it's at Ruth Eckerd Hall, but I can take my time paying him for it. Sweet!

        Jam Night   No drummer again tonight, but I noticed an ad for a drummer on the bulletin board at the rehearsal studios when we were coming in. JP called and talked to the guy. We're going to get together with him on Saturday, from 5pm to 7pm. He said he's played for over 30 years, so he's probably a bit of a geezer. Hopefully he'll work out okay, but at the very least, we'll get some practice in with a drummer. We went through a bunch of songs tonight, not the whole list that JP wanted us to go through, but a lot of them. We played most of them a couple times each, to get them tighter and to fine-tune stuff. We're getting better all the time, but we all have areas that we need to improve on: I still have work to do in the solo department (and in the amplification/tone department), Al's bass is a bit clunky at times (he's playing with a pick), and JP needs to work on his guitar playing more. I talked to JP about his guitar the other day, and tonight he admitted that yeah, he did need to work on it. No one has said anything to Al though. I think I'm the only one who notices, but I hate to criticize him because he's graciously switched from guitar to bass because of me, so it'd be like adding insult to injury coming from me. I'm normally not hesitant to speak up though, in fact, I often find myself to be the only one doing so. Tonight I corrected two songs that they had been playing slightly wrong, JP argued at first about "You May Be Right" (they weren't playing the F# chord during the chorus), but later realized that it sounded right the way I told him, so all is well. Anyhoo...we'll see how it goes on Saturday. I won't have much time to work on my solos between now and then though. I'm a little worried that the drummer is going to keel over in sonic agony when I break out into the lead for "Crazy Little Thing Called Love", which I am currently mangling. We shall see...

        Lately, I've been...     Listening to : I threw my new Jayhawks CD (" urlLink Rainy Day Music ") on, played it a couple of times, and loved it! Some of the songs sounded almost like "Deja Vu" era Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young. Great CD.    Watching on TV : "Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn", "Real Time with Bill Maher", "Fear Factor" (the only 'dumb" show I watch), and reruns of "Everybody Loves Raymond", "The Simpsons", and "Seinfeld".   Downloading : I downloaded several  urlLink Carlos Mencia  shows. He's a very funny comedian, kind of like a cross between Don Rickles and Sam Kinison. I also downloaded several tracks from The Folksmen, from the soundtrack for " urlLink A Mighty Wind ", the folk music "mockumentary". It's basically a folk version of Spinal Tap, made by the same people who are in Spinal Tap (Guest, McKean, and Shearer). Some very amusing stuff, but it's probably much funnier in the movie than taken out of context on a soundtrack CD. For instance, folkies often sing songs about train wrecks or coal mine disasters. So, The Folkmen did a song called "Blood On The Coal", about a train that wrecks inside a coal mine (it went in the wrong hole). Brillliant idea, and funny when it's explained, but if you hear the song on it's own, you probably won't get the joke right away. I'm dying to see the movie, but it's not showing  anywhere  around here. Dammit! I also downloaded some stuff from a band called Mooney Suzuki that my friend Rob recommended. I haven't heard any of that yet.   Reading : Nothing still. I suck.   Jamming : I've been practicing up on some of the covers JP wants to do. Tom Petty's "American Girl", the Stray Cats' "Rock This Town" (I like the song, but I don't want to cover it), Fastball's "The Way", Queen's "Crazy Litle Thing Called Love" (which I  really  don't want to do), and Clapton's version of "Before You Accuse Me". We play again on Thursday...no word yet on whether or not we'll have a drummer that night though.   Working : Uhhh... no.   Buying : See above. Actually, not having a job wouldn't stop me from buying stuff. In fact, I did buy two Hendrix CDs on eBay (Russian imports), but they haven't been paid for yet.     Eating : Today: for both lunch and dinner, I had Boston Market TV dinners (country fried chicken) and raw carrots. Yesterday I had Arbys (Giant roast beef sandwiches) and some potato salad. I've been chowing on ham, potato salad, and deviled eggs that Mom made on Sunday. Still drinking too much soda.     Feeling : Nervous. Not sure why...maybe it's the uncertainty of my job situation. I also came down with a cold or something, been real congested the last few days, but it's going away.    Planning : Short term, it's  urlLink Zebra  on Friday! I can't wait! My brother-in-law and sister are going and my friend Sue had better go too (or else...kung-fu time). Long term, I need to get a new and better job. I will start looking next week.

        Jobbed   I think I'm going to try and get a job doing something I like this time, like working in a record store, a guitar store, a videostore, or a bookstore...maybe even a library. I've mostly worked in restaurants in the past. I used to like them because they allowed you to do your job and then go home. No major hassles, and no major responsibilities. I've been a dish washer and a cook at many, many restaurants, fast food and "real" restaurants as well (Wendy's, McDonalds, Sizzler, Knockers, Chilis, etc..). I also worked at a grocery store, Kash-N-Karry, in the meat department, for several months. I hated that job with a passion. I've sorted mail at a pre-sort place too, which I will refrain from naming for, soon-to-be, obvious reasions. I actually found that work relaxing, but the pay was lousy and the women that ran it were total ...ummm... "c-words". That's right, they were total cunts. They used to keep their offices well air-conditioned, but they'd shut the air off out in the warehouse where we worked. It was, basically, a sweat shop. Nevertheless, I've worked for them like three times now and I've quit on them each time because of the way they treated me and the others. The last time I worked there I told them I wanted to work in the office (due to my, then-recent, back injury), but they saw that I was a machine operator at another job and they decided that that's what I was going to do there. They had me pulling trays of mail off the sorting lines and loading them into mail carts, which absolutely killed my back. I did that crap for two or three days and then I quit. The job where I hurt my back, which shall also remain nameless, was decent at first. I started there as a temp and enjoyed the work, which was mostly hand assembly stuff. The best thing about that situation, was the lack of any real responsibility. Like a restaurant job, you go in, do your job, and then go home. However, after nearly two years of working as a temp, I got hired as a regular full-timer there (for the health insurance). It was a cake job at first, I just unloaded CDs out of a machine that puts CDs together and put them in trays onto a skid or else I loaded those CDs into a machine that wrapped them. Again, I had very little responsibility and I liked that. Now don't get me wrong, I worked hard, and I always gave my best effort, but I didn't want a lot of responsibility mainly because I didn't want to have to deal with the managers. Bosses annoy and intimidate me, especially the weasels one I had at this particular job. Unfortunately, the cake walk only lasted a little while. The manager there decided that we should have a larger workload, but with no additional pay. Almost overnight, the job became less enjoyable. I eventually took on a lot more responsibility there, for the raises in pay, and that was the beginning of the end of that job. The weasel factor grew more and more intense, the workload got overwhelming (tons of mandatory overtime, plus I often had to do other peoples work for them because they refused to be trained), the machinery was frustrating (I had to call for maintenance almost nightly), office politics grew tiring, and before long I had had enough. That job screwed me up in many ways. Physically, because of the back injury I suffered there, but also mentally. I no longer cared anymore. I had given my all and got nothing in return for it but headaches and an even larger workload. I did my job to the best of my ability, even with all of the additional responsibilies placed on my shoulders, I always busted my ass, but did I ever get any appreciation or thanks? Never. Just "why didn't you do this" or "what happened to that". I saw that a few others there, who never busted their asses, never seemed to have the stress that I did, and I started wondering what I was busting my ass for when no one else seemed to care. It was all pointless. All of it. And not a damn thing I was doing there made a bit of difference in the world. Life's too short to waste it sweating over nothing. So... I quit there and went back to school, to community college. I lasted there only 2 1/2 semesters before I ran out of money. I hadn't planned anything, going back to school, I just  went for it . I should've planned everything out beforehand; I had no idea of what I was getting into nor any idea of how things worked there. I was only there a short time, but I got  a lot  out of it. I learned that I was still capable of working hard, and that I was capable of getting good grades when I put my mind to it (I got all A's, except for one B in Algebra), something I never did when I was younger (I dropped out of High School). But the most important thing I got from my return to school was the reopening of my own mind. I found myself again. It was the two semesters of Western Humanities that did it. I found a renewed love for the arts, for history, and for creativity. I started reading again, reading more in a single year than I had read in my whole life, and I went to museums. I started feeling alive again, mentally, and I decided that I had to start making music again...that was me, that's who I am. I decided to take a year off from having a "real job" and tried working on my own (selling basketball cards) and working to get a band going. Unfortunately, I was lazy, I didn't sell often enough, and so I wound up getting even further in debt. I had to get a job again, had to do it fast, so I went back to restaurant work again, back to Wendy's. That's the job I just quit.  So this time, when I start looking for a job again, I think I'm going to try and find something that I would enjoy doing, something I could do  for me .   I guess the first sentence was sufficient, huh?   D'oh!

        Unemployed   Leave it to me, in these times, when many, many people are suddenly finding themselves out-of-work and are looking for jobs, to quit mine. I am officially unemployed now, having called and quit my job a few minutes ago. I was thinking about going in tomorrow, doing it right and giving them a real two-weeks notice, so I tried standing up and moving around for a few minutes (to see if I'd be able to handle doing light work) and after 10-15 minutes, I started feeling strain in my back and had to sit down. There's no way I'd have been ready to go in tomorrow, maybe not even Tuesday, and that would have caused me to get fired anyway, since I'd have missed two weeks at that point, and since Wendy's policy is to fire employess who miss two weeks of work. It's a shit job, and I wanted to quit eventually anyway, but I still feel bad for not giving any notice (12 hours is all they got). Given the situation with the possible firing and the back pain, it was about the only option I had really. So... I guess I'll sleep in a lot this week. That will be good for me, especially since I've been struggling with sleep for the last several days. I figure I'll start job hunting in two weeks, so I'll have plenty of time to rest up between now and then. I'm going to try and sell some Michael Jordan cards in the newspaper, this week perhaps, and if I can get $500 for them, it'll help keep me afloat for a month or two. I don't want to be out of work for long, for financial reasons obviously, but I also don't want to completely slip into my natural routine of being a night owl, which I always do when I'm off from work for more than a day or two. It might be too late for that already, though. I've been going to bed after 4am, this morning it was 7am, and I'm sleeping (or attempting to sleep) until late afternoon. I need a day job so I can do the band thing at night, so I have to be up in the mornings to first find, and then go to, that job.  Sigh...  It's going to be a trying few weeks.

        Lately, I've been...     Listening to : The only CD I've played of late is Billy Connolly's "Billy and Albert" CD.    Reading : Man, I might as well take this category out. I haven't read jack... for months. I've got a whole stack of books that I  plan  on reading, but I just haven't gotten to them yet.   Watching on TV : I've been on the PC a lot lately, so I haven't been watching too much TV. I've watched "Everybody Loves Raymond" (starting to get tired of the same old episodes, but still funny), "Insomniac with Dave Attell", "Real Time with Bill Maher", and CNN. The war in Iraq is dying down and the TV coverage is dwindling, so I haven't been watching as much CNN as before.   Downloading : A lot lately. I downloaded and watched Ali G's movie "Indahouse", which was hilarious (I need to get that on VHS or DVD now). I also downloaded "Old School" and "Orange County", but I haven't watched them yet. I downloaded a bunch of Tenacious D clips that I hadn't seen before, including Jack Black's first appearance on Conan O'Brien (he was very, very funny), the first 2 parts of the D on the Andy Dick Show (when Andy tried to get Kyle to join  his  band, Hellacious A), and an adult-oriented cartoon of a D song made by Ren & Stimpy's creator, John Kricfalusi!    Playing : I guess you can call it "playing"; I've been working on my Blog the last couple days. Changed the title, the design, added a counter, and changed a few things here and there. I've still been playing my handheld "Connect Four" game at bedtime all week too.    Jamming : Jammed on Thursday with Al & JP. Pretty productive night, plus we laughed and joked around a lot too. Too bad Vince, the drummer, didn't show up again. He might show up next week, but he's not dependable at all (apparently, he has a lot of problems at home, plus he pulled a hamstring). I need to learn solos for a few covers and get very familiar with the 20 songs that we're going to run through next Thursday.    Working : I've missed 6 or 7 days of work this past week and a half. They are not happy with me there at all. I can tell when I talk to them on the phone, they sound annoyed. That's ok, I'm ready to quit Wendys anytime now anyways. If my back/sides aren't better by Monday, I might just quit then. That way, I can rest a week or so, get my back well again, and then start looking for work. If I'm not well soon, they'll have to can me anyway. They allow people to miss 2 weeks, but after that, it's company policy to fire you. I spent a few hours last night looking for job openings on the internet. A lot of local businesses put their job listings online and hit many of them. Home Shopping Network is hiring still. I should really go there. Also, I checked the paper and saw that Enterprise Art is/was hiring a part-time worker (20 hours a week), and I would love to work there, around artistic people and in a nice air-conditioned environment.   Buying : I bought a Jimi Hendrix promo CD for Woodstock that features a video on it. Including shipping and insurance, it was $6.05. I probably didn't need to buy insurance, but it's in a cardboard sleeve and it'd be easy to get damaged during shipping.   Eating : I've been chowing down all week on Boston Market TV dinners (the chicken ones with mashed potatoes) and raw carrots. Good stuff. I had a Stavros Greek salad tonight, and Mom made Pineapple Upsidewon cake again... oh, yeah.   Feeling : Frustrated as hell. Between the back and side pain, my sleeping habit being screwed up, losing work, having no money, and not being able to go anywhere or do anything, it's been a really frustrating, shitty, week.    Planning : Next week will be quite interesting. I may not have a job anymore, but I need to quit there anyway, so I guess I'm "planning" on quitting or getting fired, if that counts as a "plan". I plan on going to the Zebra concert on Friday regardless of what happens with work. Other than that, with my job situation up in the air, I really can't plan on too much right now.

        Day & Night   Well, I managed to miss another day of work. I just could not sleep last night, my mind wouldn't shut down, plus I was having trouble getting comfortable because of my back. I was supposed to be at work at 11:30am, but at 8am I was still wide awake in my bed so I got up and called in. I told them I won't be back til Monday. At the time, that wasn't absolutely necessary, but now, tonight, I'm suddenly having a lot of pain in my left side, especially when I bend to the right, so I'm glad I did that now. I need to find me an open grave and just jump on in. I feel like I'm 64, not 34. After I called in, I stayed up til about 10am before heading to bed again. I slept til about 3pm and got out of bed around 3:30pm. I just could not sleep well at all.  Tonight was band practice night and we played for our usual two hours. Again, no drummer. We went over a Fastball cover and a few of JP's originals and I changed the arrangement on one of his songs ("Promise You The Moon"). Everybody was pretty happy with the new arrangement. I also threw in a riff I was working on at home this past week (B-A with a bass line I came up with) and I came up with 2 more parts for it on the spot (E-A / C#m-B-A-G#-F#-G#-A-B). JP was singing something over it, not sure what, but it sounded pretty cool. Time flew by pretty quickly. I'm still really unhappy with my sound. Every week it's a different amp and a different sound for me. I went to do a solo on a blues song, which should be a showcase for me, but I had nothing, no sustain whatsoever, a dinky little weenie tone, and I sounded like  shit . I'm always too loud or too quiet, and am almost always unhappy with my sound. I need my own amplifier...soon.

        It's Official: I'm A Dumbass!   I should be in bed right now. In fact, I  was  in bed for awhile, but I got up because I had an idea for a television parody that I couldn't stop thinking about. It's a spoof of "Gilligan's Island", done as a television promo for a "Survivor" type show or a trailer for an upcoming movie, featuring short scenes, snippets. Most of it would be based on scenes from "Apocalypse Now", but there could be a little bit of "Lord Of The Flies" mixed in too. Really  dark  humor. Here are some of my ideas:  Early on, there'd be a scene where the Professor presents one of his crazy, far-fetched inventions ("that just might get us off this island") to the castaways, but instead of being happy, they look at each other nervously, with pained expressions on their faces. Now the Professor, he'd be played just like the TV character would, but the others, at this point, would be done reality television style. He wouldn't understand their reactions, he'd be quite confused, and then, from a back/side shot, we'd see a club strike his head causing him to go down. The castaways would have a look of horror on their faces, and it would cut to the Skipper, who had just clubbed the Professor over the head, telling the others "it had to be done, he'd obviously lost his mind... a satellite dish made out of coconuts...come on!"   I also thought of scenes where the Skipper terrorizes the others including the Howells, where he has Thurston's bloodied head under his foot and is telling him "you may have been a billionaire back in the real world, but here on this island, you're my bitch!", Mrs.Howell protests, and he bitch slaps her. There might be another scene where he claims Mary Ann and Ginger as his own, forcing Gilligan out into the jungle to fend for himself, and maybe another where we see the Professor tied up, locked in a bamboo pen or maybe even his head on a stick (also, ala "Apocalypse Now"). There are lots of interesting possibilities here.  Another of the scenes I envisioned would be a take-off on the scene in "Apocalypse Now", when Martin Sheen's character is going in to kill Brando's character. If you've seen the movie, you'll remember the scene where we see a close-up shot of Sheen emerging from steamy black water, his face painted in camouflage and a determined look in his eyes...you remember, right? OK, in my bit, we'd see Gilligan's camouflaged face emerging from the steamy black water (of the lagoon, obviously), the camera rising upward to reveal his silly, bright white hat on his head. He'd be going in to kill the Skipper, who, at this point, would be shaved bald like Brando in the movie. The Skipper has gone mad, crazed with power. When Gilligan finally does him in, it would be done just like "Apocalypse Now", with the shadowy silhouettes, but everytime we see Gilligan strike the Skipper, we hear the Skipper go "oof!" or "d'oh!"..whatever that noise was he made.   For the ending, it'd have to be really stupid, like going in close on Gilligan after he's killed the Skipper, his unspoken thoughts playing as the soundtrack ala "Apocalypse Now", but then a coconut falls on Gilligan's head as he's thinking, he makes that stupid face he makes when a coconut falls on his head, and then he drops out of the frame.   The End.    It's stupid, yeah I know, but at the same time, it's totally brilliant!

        Boycotting The French   As we all know, many Americans are pissed off at the French because of their lack of support and cooperation during the early stages of the War in Iraq. Outraged Americans have already taken to calling french fries "Freedom Fries", and now there is a movement coming together to actively boycott all products from France. To show my solidarity with these great, patriotic Americans, I am, as of right now, officially boycotting French Poodles.   That's right, French Poodles.   This is no empty threat either, I mean it, no more French Poodles for Gary. I know it'll be hard at first, but I'm willing to make that sacrifice for my beliefs.   I am hoping, however, that it will be a short boycott, because I could really use a French Poodle right about now.  Oh, and I have also decided to boycott the city of Paris, Texas, cartoons featuring Pepe LePew, and french ticklers.   Take that, you French bastards!

        I Smell A Ratt... Or Not   Damn. I guess I won't be going to the Stephen Pearcy show this Friday. My sister and brother-in-law are passing on it and I don't want to go alone. I always dug Ratt, at least their first few albums anyway. Even though the rest of the band won't be there, it would have been cool to hear Pearcy singing his old '80's Ratt material ("Lay It Down" was a fav of mine). Oh well, there's still Zebra next week, another '80's band, and that's one hell of a consolation. Zebra's first album is a classic, and they did some really good stuff after that one too. These guys were way better than the average '80's hair band of their day. They always presented themselves as real musicians and backed it up with their songwriting and playing. Staying away from the leather outfits, hairspray, bad videos, and power ballads, these guys rocked for real. They were a power trio, which was unique for the '80's too, and I will be seeing them next week! Yes!!

        Feelin' Alright... Finally   Yesterday, I woke up with almost no back pain at all, surprisingly, and I still feel alright today. Once in a while I will get a slight twinge of pain, but I can live with that. What a huge relief. I will be able to return to work on Thursday and hopefully things will get back to normal. I need to start working a lot more hours than I have been, to get some money coming in again. There is a bunch of musical equipment I need to buy still (a good combo amp, a few pedals, a 2nd electric guitar), plus it's always nice to have spending money. It would be smart to start saving some money too, though that's not likely to happen anytime soon, with my lack of self-control.   I spent a good portion of the last two days playing my guitar, something I need to continue doing. There is often too much time spent not playing at all, and as a guitarist, not playing means not growing. Besides, with the situation I'm in now, where the other guitarist in the band is playing bass, I want to be the best I can so he doesn't start wondering "why the hell is that guy playing guitar instead of me?" ...if he isn't already. I haven't spent much time working on the covers we're supposed to do... I really hate learning songs note-for-note. To me, that's not being a musician, that's being a playback machine. Besides, I'm lazy as hell and learning songs note-for-note takes time and effort, work, and who the hell needs that? This probably explains why I have about 100 or more original songs lying around (on tape and in my mind), all incomplete. I have about forty 90 minute tapes filled up with various incomplete songs and musical ideas. What a mess. Who's the King Of Procrastination, the Lord Of Laziness? Why, it's me! It's me!  Hey, at least my back feels better.

        Independantly Wealthy   That's what my main manager at Wendys says about me, that I must be "independantly wealthy" to miss so much work. Now  that's  a laugh. I called in today to check on my schedule, but also to call in for tomorrow. I will have missed an entire week now due to my back problems, which isn't much time when it comes to back problems, but is an eternity when it comes to my job. The manager I talked to tonight sounded irritated with me (he's the same one who insinuated I was missing work due to my family being down), like my calling off work is a personal slap at him or something. I'm in a lot of pain. I don't need  more  bullshit to deal with. I've got enough, thank you. But I know better. I know I'm in store for a slew of snide remarks and petty put-downs when I return, which is yet another reason why I'm not looking forward to returning. But return I must. I am broker than a muhfukka. I have enough to pay my Gateway bill, I should have enough to pay my Student Loan bill, but I will have to find money for busfare, band practice, the Post Office, my eBay account, and money for the two concerts coming up (this week and next) from somewhere. I get paid next Monday, but that paycheck should be pretty shitty. This is why every working American should have healthcare, to avoid Catch-22 situations like I'm in now and have been in for awhile. How can I ever get ahead if I'm missing work due to injury, but don't have the money to get the injury worked on because I'm missing too much work and can't afford it? It's a terrible sentence, yes, but an even more terrible way to live.

        Lately, I've been...     Listening to : I haven't put any CDs on for a few days, only listened to a little of that new Jayhawks CD I bought (what I heard sounded really good).   Reading : I still haven't started reading anything new, and never finished that Carl Sagan book I started months ago..    Watching on TV : CNN, Bill Maher, CNN, Da Ali G Show, CNN, Saturday Night Live (w/Ray Romano/Zwan), CNN, Trading Spaces, CNN, basketball, CNN, The Simpsons, CNN, Dennis Miller, and CNN.    Downloading : I downloaded a bunch of stuff from Zwan. After seeing them on SNL, I wanted to hear what they sounded like on CD. Never being a Billy Corgan fan myself, I figured, since he's always been critically acclaimed, that it might be worth checking out. What I heard was OK, I really don't enjoy Corgan's voice at all, but the guitar playing was good and some of the songs were enjoyable. I downloaded a bunch of stuff from Zwan's bassist, Paz Lenchantin, too. She's a babe, a good bassist, and some of the things I heard from her were pretty interesting.     Playing : Still playing my handheld Connect Four game at bedtime.    Jamming : I really need to keep practicing the songs I'm supposed to do with JP and Al, but I've barely played anything since the last practice. I tried playing my guitar today (I got my MXR Phase 90 pedal in and wanted to check it out), but I only lasted about 10 minutes before I had to quit. The pain in my back got too great. I did start a song in that 10 minutes though, an Otis Redding-type R&B number in B (B-D#-E-C#m). We're supposed to play again on Thursday, and JP said he might be over on Tuesday night as well.    Working : I haven't worked since last Tuesday, and may be calling off tomorrow too. I've rested like crazy, but the back pain has only slightly lessened. It still feels like I've been punched in the back.    Buying : I will be bidding on Doyle Bramhall II's out-of-print debut CD in about 25 minutes, a rare sealed copy. I hope I can nab it relatively cheap (the last sealed one on eBay sold for $40). I haven't bid on anything else for awhile. (NOTE: I was outbid and lost the CD)   Eating : Too much soda, not enough water and vegetables. I am working on it again.   Feeling : Frustrated and angry. The situation with my back is pissing me off a great deal. I'm missing work, which means I will be short on money, and because I'm short on money, I can't afford to go to the doctors, hence the frustration. I am tired of always having something wrong with me.    Planning : I wanted to go to two concerts this month, but I may not be going to the Stephen Pearcy (of Ratt) show this Friday due to lack of funds. I will if I can though. I don't want to miss Zebra next week though, I  must  go to that one!

        A Weekend On The Couch   I've spent the last four days, including the entire weekend, almost entirely on the couch. I got up to eat, to use the bathroom, to check my mail/auctions on the computer from time to time, and also spent some of the time in my bed, napping, as well, but almost the entire weekend I was couchbound. Here's the really shitty thing: my back  still hurts . Regardless, I plan on going in to work tomorrow, where I know I'll get jumped on for missing time last week, where I'll get spoken to like I'm a liar, where I'll get reemed for not completing the paperwork they gave me on Tuesday (which got lost or thrown out since then)... maybe the couch isn't so bad after all.   I'm really ambivalent about my job...on one hand I need it and am glad to have it (it helps take care of my main bills, the hours are flexable, it's near impossible to get fired from it no matter how much I fuck up, it's close to home, the work is easy, and the hours are short), but on the other hand, it's a shit job (I get sick of breathing bad air from the fryers, I get sick of being brow-beaten, no insurance, low pay, no future, I have to shave and wear a uniform, and the hours are short). If my back wasn't so bad, I would have gotten a better job already, but I'm worried that no other job is going to put up with my shit like this one does. I wish I could get my back well. Losing weight would be a big help. I'm going to have to go back to dieting, eating better and healthier, again. It's just so hard, living at home, where Mom does the grocery shopping and the cooking. It's hard to set and maintain a strict diet when I have little control over what foods I will be eating. I guess I'm officially on a diet again... starting tomorrow (I can't start tonight, Mom made Lasagna). I'll do what I can.

        CNN's Aaron Brown   Aaron Brown makes me want to shoot a staple gun into my forehead. Why? Because his forehead is not in reach. I first became aware of him during the events of 9/11, getting all emotional and sappy, almost sermonizing, during his news segments. Awwww... a sensitive man, how special. Besides, I got the feeling he was saying things he felt he should be saying, not necessarily things he actually felt... fake emotionalism (the worse kind). He comes across like a huge phony, and a real big wussy too. Look, I just want a newsman to give me the news, that's all, just the news. I don't care about his personal feelings and emotions, I don't care about him at all, I just want the freaking news! Recently, during the War in Iraq, he really made me angry when he began rounding up and interviewing parents of American POWs and KIAs, pulling that same faux emotional crap with them, but worse yet, feeding off of their pain. There was no reason to bother these people, other than his/CNN's own need to fill air time. Leave those people alone, you asshole! That shit isn't even news anyway, it's exploitation. So, to express my own personal feelings and emotions regarding Aaron Brown, I really feel, honestly, that Aaron Brown is a total hard-on.     A Not-So Good Day   I woke up very sore and very tired and laid in bed with the alarm blasting for a good 30 minutes. As soon as I tried getting up and moving, I found that my back wasn't cooperating. I started having spasms in my back with streaks of pain and I knew there was no way I was leaving the house to go to work today. I tried calling in to let work know, but the phone was busy every time. I wound up laying on the couch, mostly asleep, until after 2pm and then I tried calling my work again, to let them know what was going on, but again, just a busy signal. Not good. My Mom went up there for food awhile later and told them I had tried calling and that I was going to miss Friday too, but she didn't talk to the manager. Later that night, Jim (another of my managers) called. I told him what was up and that I would be out tomorrow too. He insinuated that I was missing work because I had family down, which was not the case at all. In fact, I only saw my cousin and her family for about 15 minutes during the day, when they made a pit stop before heading out again. I can understand if they'd want to fire me, I miss a lot of time, but I don't understand why they'd think I'd lie.   I took several Aleve pills today and drank a shot or two of Jack Daniels (mixed w/Pepsi). It took the Jack Daniels to get me out to jam with JP and Al tonight. I wanted to call off badly, but it was too late, the time was booked and it had to be paid for. I made it through OK, not much pain. I started a song before JP came to get me tonight, just warming up, and we wound up jamming on it tonight. Very Pink Floyd sounding, pretty cool, and different from anything else we do. JP added some vocals to it (with some lyrics he came up with on the spot) and Al played bass on it. They sounded pretty darn good. Too bad the drummer didn't show up though. That guy Vince, who drummed for us once before, said he was going to drum for us tonight, but he was a no show/no call. We ran through a lot of songs, mostly JPs originals and a handful of covers. I'm not too fond of doing "Crazy Little Thing Called Love". I played ok, I could have done more, but I wasn't happy with my sound. The amp I used this time was way better than the last one I used, the clean sound was great, but when I used my Captain Coconut pedal, I didn't get the sound I had wanted. I had set up the pedal with my little Peavey amp in my room, but it sounds different with a different amp. I really need to buy an amp, so I can build the sound I want and keep it set up. Anyhow, we played for the usual 2 hours and I learned a few songs... we're progressing as a band, but very slowly.   My cousin and her family got back here about 10:30pm tonight. I had the kids make more snowflakes and farts (see the previous entry) and I drew monsters with them. I had been instant messaging with Sue, but I inadvertantly left her hanging to play with the kids... sorry Sue! They're all heading back to Pennsylvania about 6am, so it was the last I'd see them. I wanted to say goodbye to Kristie and the kids, but when I went back to say goodbye, everyone was already in bed, so nothing was said. Gary was out with me for awhile before heading to bed, but I didn't want to say goodbye to him only. I'm surprised Kristie didn't say goodbye or "thank you" or anything, that was kind of disappointing. I guess she'll see my Mom in the morning, she'll probably say something to her then.

        A Good Day   Well, my day off did not go entirely as planned. I had just fallen asleep around 4am when my 8 year old cousin. Jonathan, started screaming and crying, followed by footsteps and voices up and down the hallway. I got out of bed to see what was happening  just as the paramedics were arriving . It seemed he had had a seizure; twitching, eyes rolling back, losing control of his sight and legs. He has Diabetes too, so it was pretty worrying to everyone. He got taken to All Children's Hospital in an ambulance. It turns out that he was severely dehydrated, and luckily had nothing to do with his Diabetes. He's fine now. I finally went back to bed around 5am, after things settled down, and slept til 1:15pm. I felt a whole lot less sleepy than I had all week, but my back was still very bothersome. My sister and Austin, my 5 year old nephew, got here around 2pm. Austin met and then played non-stop with Jonathan's brother, Kody, another 5 year old. I eventually went outside with them and played ball with them (they were hitting a whiffle ball with badminton rackets). After a bit, Jonathan, his Mom (my cousin Kristie), and Gary Smith (Kristie's boyfriend) came back (they had been out to the Pier) and we all played catch with my blue mini-football. It started raining and we all played out in the rain awhile, until it started lightning and thundering. After the rain stopped, we all went up to the pool here in my neighborhood. The 3 boys were in the pool swimming when I surprised them by suddenly jumping in, cannonballing 'em! Whoosh! Me and the boys got into many, many splash fights (I also made a point of splashing my Mom, Kristie, Gary, and my sister...everyone sitting poolside) and swam around for awhile. The water was fairly warm, surprisingly, but it was cool and windy out and soon the two youngest boys got cold and got out, shaking. Soon after, we split for home again. We all sat around talking while the boys played and ate, then I got on the PC and started looking for fun stuff for the kids to do. I found a bunch of cool stuff. My favorites were  urlLink Make-A-Flake , where you design your own snowflakes, and I found a cool  urlLink Fireworks  page, where you set off virtual fireworks...it's brilliant! Me being me, I also took the boys to a  urlLink Creat-A-Fart  page and they loved it! We had fun for an hour or so, even their mom came over and did stuff with us too (making farts, fireworks, and sand art). Everyone hit the sack by 11pm and I cleaned up, did some laundry, watched a little TV and wrote this, relaxing with a cup of coffee. Even though this day got off to a rotten start, all in all, it was a good day.

        Lately, I've been...    Listening to : I haven't really been listening to much lately; been too busy in the evening and too tired at bedtime to put anything on. The last thing I had on was at bedtime, a Woody Allen stand-up comedy CD, that I played last week/weekend.    Reading : Again, I've been too tired at bedtime to start reading, which sucks because I was hoping to get into the habit of reading at bedtime again.    Watching on TV : CNN War coverage primarily, along with my usual nighttime routine of Howard Stern (only if it's a good one), Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn, Real Time with Bill Maher, and sometimes "Everybody Loves Raymond" in the evenings. I also got to watch "Saturday Night Live" (Bernie Mac/Good Charlotte...crappy show) this past Saturday too, in between jobs. Mainly it's been news, news, news, though.   Downloading : I downloaded a few KISS songs today, stuff from the "Killers" CD. I'd never heard the four "new" songs that KISS included on that compilation CD before and was curious. It wasn't very good, and definitely is not worth buying. I also downloaded a few Vinnie Vincent songs too, but I haven't listened to them yet. I don't remember him or his playing very well and wanted to see what I may have missed.   Playing : I haven't jammed for almost 3 weeks. I played in my room by myself for a few hours yesterday though, mostly getting my Captain Coconut pedal set-up. I can't wait to hear what it sounds like with a good amp. We're supposed to play this Thursday for sure, and we may have Vince playing drums for us again....better than no drummer at all.    Working : They scheduled me to work on Wednesday, which is supposed to be a day off for me, so I told them I couldn't do it. I called off twice last week because of back pain, so they schedule me extra hours this week? Stupid, stupid, people. Also, I have company down from Pennsylvania this week, they knew that, but I guess they didn't think I needed a day off to spend with them. Oh well, it's their problem now.   Buying : I bought an MXR Phase 90 pedal on eBay the other day and am anxiously awaiting it's arrival. I also bought a new printer (on credit) from Gateway and got it in already. I need to hook it up tomorrow. Tonight, I hit a few music stores (Best Buy, Borders, and Specs) and bought 3 CDs. I didn't buy anything at the first two stores (Best Buys' selection sucked, but their prices were good; and Borders was the exact opposite of Best Buy, great selection, shitty prices), buying all 3 CDs at Specs. I got two comedy CDs I'd been trying to find for a long time now, Richard Jeni - " urlLink Greatest Bits " and Brian Regan - " urlLink Live ",  as well as the new Jayhawks CD, "Rainy Day Music urlLink  ", which came with a limited edition bonus CD with six bonus tracks! Sweet!   Eating : All the wrong stuff. I had a steak & cheese hoagie for dinner tonight and then later ate a buttload of Mom's Pineapple Upsidedown cake, which rules. Other than the mushrooms that were on the hoagie, I ate no veggies whatsoever, which is a big problem with my diet. I need to become a major salad-muncher. That, and I need to eat smaller portions. Oh, and I need to drink more water and less soda. Oh yeah, I need to excercise too. But first, I need to have another piece of cake...   Feeling : Tired more than anything. My back is still bugging me, so I haven't been sleeping too well. I'm planning on sleeping in tomorrow (which is actually today). My sister is supposed to come down with my nephew to visit with our cousin (from PA.) and her two boys, so I don't know how long (or  if ) I'll get to sleep in though.    Planning : Two cool concerts this month: Stephen Pearcy, ex-lead singer from Ratt, on the 18th and  urlLink Zebra  (yes!!!) on the 25th. I am going to Zebra no matter what, but I may also go to the Pearcy show too since my sister and brother-in-law like Ratt. My brother-in-law said he'd go see Zebra with me too (my sister isn't sure who they are). Hopefully, my friend Sue will be going to the Zebra show too... if not, I may have to throw down some Kung-Fu on her until she changes her mind. Hiiiiii-YAAAA!!!

        Work, Work, Work   I've been working my ass off for the past several days getting the house ready for our company. I've thrown out about 12 bags of garbage and gathered up about 14 boxes of stuff for Goodwill. I've cleaned several rooms, did repairwork, scrubbed, labeled, sorted, etcetera, and I am pooped. They are due in sometime between 9am and 1pm, it's 6:15am now and I still have a shitload to do. My shower/tub and toilet haven't been cleaned very well yet, the refrigerator needs cleaned, I have to tape on a tablecloth to the porch table, the living room and my bedroom need vacuumed, the blinds need dusting, there's a pile of stuff on the dining room table that my Mom needs to sort through, still some stuff in the spare room that needs put away, I need to do some laundry, I need to shower, I need to sweep the porch again, the kitchen floor needs to be mopped, and on and on... fuck me! My Mom has done a bunch, but I've been doing most of the work (almost all of the heavy lifting) and my back, feet, and legs are really sore. I would love to take Monday off from work, but my boss is already going to lay into me about missing Thursday and Friday last week, and missing Monday would really be pushing it. Besides, Monday is payday and I gotsta git paid. I'm supposed to go and Jam with JP with that band tonight, but at this point, I'm thinking about calling that off. It's just too much. I  need  to rest. I'm taking a break right now, drinking a cup of Jack Daniels and Pepsi, and totally not looking forward to the day ahead.  This afternoon I took an old amp I had stuck away in a closet over to Johnny's House Of Guitars and got $35 for it. Glad to get it, but I'm sure I lost money on that deal. My friend Scott owed me money and gave me that instead... don't rememeber how much, but I'm sure I got screwed. It's been sitting in a closet for at least a decade. We took a ton of stuff to Goodwill and I stopped in at Good Vibrations music where  I bought a Hendrix tablature songbook ("First Rays Of The New Rising Sun") for $25 + tax and checked out an MXR Phase 90 pedal they had there. It was beat to hell, but sounded great. They wanted $60 + tax for it and it didn't have it's box. Later, after we got home from the Post Office and lunch at a Chinese Buffet, I won an MXR Phase 90 pedal on eBay, supposedly in "like new" condition with it's box, for just $65. Sweet! We ate out again, later that night, at Denny's. We were both tired and I definitely wanted a sit-down meal.   I'd better get back to work before I get the notion to go to bed... I'm certainly ready for it.

        Pain   It appears that the company from Pa. will be down for sure now, likely arriving sometime late Sunday or early Monday, so I've been busting my ass around the house getting things in order. Unfortunately, a lot of what I've been doing involves physical work and that means only one thing for me: back pain. My back is killing me. I missed the last two days of work due to the back pain, but instead of resting my back, I've had to keep on working. My Mom can't do much lifting and stooping, so I've had to (not that I can handle it much better). It's a chore getting off the couch right now, and I don't mean mentallly, but physically. I'm hurtin'. I've been popping Aleve's like they were candy but they're not helping much. I've thrown out about 6 full bags of trash, 3 doors, 3 drawers from an old desk, and a huge stack of cardboard boxes, in the last 2 days, most culled from my sister's old room, which my Mom uses like a storage shed. It was filled with cardboard boxes and desk drawers full of various stuff that she didn't know what to do with so she stuck it in boxes and piled it all in the room. Tons of Avon stuff too, lipsticks, perfumes, jewelery, lotions, etc...most unusable after all this time. It was a fucking mess. You could barely walk in there. I got it sorted out for the most part, but there's still a lot to do in there yet. I still have work to do on the front porch and in my bedroom and bathroom as well. I worked some in my bathroom already, I've cleaned the counter, under the counter, removed wallpaper from the shelf and from the mirror, I cleaned the mirror well (got all the glue off it), and cleaned up the mess my brother-in-law made of the paneling (I had to paint with White Out), but I need to clean the tub/shower and the toilet still. I would also like to get the WebTV and the new VCR hooked up in Mom's room too. It doesn't look like I'm going to get much relief anytime soon.

        Uncertainty & Doubt   We are supposed to have family from Pennsylvania down for a week, I've been working around the house and yard cleaning things up for them, and now my Mom says tonight that they may or may not be down, she isn't 100 % sure. They are/were supposed to arrive here this weekend, so it is really uncool that they haven't confirmed this with my Mom yet, especially since they will be taking her bedroom when they come down (she's planning on sleeping on the couch). Seems very inconsiderate to me, but as noted below (see "Is It Me?") , there is no shortage of inconsideration in my family. I've already done work outside getting ready for them, I worked in my bathroom tonight and will be working on the front porch tomorrow and in my bedroom and living room (and probably more in my bathroom) sometime between now and Saturday night, when they are/were supposed to be here. I need to clean the refrigerator too. My back is killing me, my legs and feet are sore, and I'm going to be very pissed if they do not show up.   I was supposed to jam tomorrow night, but that has been called off now (for the second week in a row) by the other two guys (who have stuff to do). I'm not very happy about the progress we're making as is, and canceling practices only makes things worse. John Paul said he may be by on Friday to practice with me, so that'll help (if he actually shows up). He said he talked to Al about just sticking to bass and Al seemed receptive to it. This would be great for me since I've never really been comfortable playing with another guitarist (too limiting for me). Me and JP are supposed to go to a jam with some band he knows on Sunday too. They have a horn player, a keyboardist, a percussionist, a bassist, and a guitarist and we're going to jam with them to see if we fit. It could be a very interesting jam. I just hope I'm on my game that night. I'm not sure what will become of either band situation. We're still searching for a drummer in one band, not getting very tight due to lack of practice, and the other band looks interesting, but we'd have to play a lot of songs we don't dig and we'd have to play them pretty much note for note, which is something I really dislike doing. Again, uncertainty and doubt prevails.

        Day Of Surprises   My first surprise of the day came when I woke up and looked at my alarm clock. I thought it might be around 9 or 10am, but it was actually 2:30pm. That was an unpleasant surprise. I stayed up too late reading ("The Amityville Horror") I guess. I was hoping to stick to my early riser schedule of late.  Later in the day, I was sitting on my bed playing guitar, still in my underwear, when JP comes walking down the hallway! I jumped up and threw some clothes on immediately. How embarrassing. That was another unpleasant surprise, but it was also a nice surprise that he came over. He had been knocking at my window and at the front door and I never heard him (my ears still haven't opened up yet and my hearing is pretty bad). I showed him some stuff I've been working on in open G tuning, including some stuff I had been working on when he showed up, and that Allman Brothers type song on slide. He said he liked what he heard. He was kind of in a rush though, and wanted to work on that new song of mine that he wrote lyrics for. We worked on it for awhile, some give and take, and I think it'll work fine now. His changes got changed back, but not entirely, and we kept his lyrics. I showed him what I'd written for it and he didn't like them much, since I wasn't sold on what I had either (dumb rock cliches, but I had wanted to make them that way on purpose), it was an easy decision to chuck them. We talked a little, and he said a lot of the same things I have been thinking about in regards to our musical differences, so we're on the same page in many respects, but we are definitely going in two different directions musically, and he recognizes that as well. Before he left I showed him that Hendrixy song I started yesterday, in C#m, and he said "that's the kind of stuff I wish I could write", but also implying that he wouldn't really know what to do with a song like that. So... I guess I'll have to take things as they come for awhile, see how they play out.   Shortly after he left I received my third surprise of the day... and the best one. I had been dying to get that Led Zeppelin 3-CD live set that came out this week, especially since it was on sale at Best Buy for just $16.99, but I'm flat broke right now. I sold an extra Hendrix CD I had lying around to my friend Rob for $8 and an extra Hendrix tape for $3 (he's going to pay me on Sunday) and I had one other CD I though he would want, but he passed. I would've had enough if had bought it. By this afternoon, disappointed, I had pretty much given up on it. Around 6pm, Mom finally got home. She stopped after work and picked up dinner (Popeyes) and she also picked up something else...the Zeppelin CD I'd wanted! I couldn't believe it! How cool was that? You know, I don't remember the last time anyone did something like that for me... it was a really nice thing for her to do, especially since I already owe her so much. She stopped at Target and they had it for even less than Best Buy (a 3-CD set for $15.99...amazingly good price). After dinner, and after Raymond (I love that show), I went to my room and put it on and finished reading my book. Great CD, even better surprise.

        Lately, I've been...     Listening to : I had on a Big Head Todd and the Monsters CD single yesterday, I'd forgotten how good they were, especially that "Sister Sweetly" album of theirs. Today, I had some Dio on, "The Very Beast Of Dio". Dio rocks.    Watching on TV : "Everybody Loves Raymond" and "Seinfeld", but mostly "Trading Spaces", "Changing Rooms", "Ground Force" and "While You Were Out", though I haven't been paying a lot of attention to what's on the TV, it's just on.    Downloading : On a Los Lobos website I found David Hidalgo talking about specific songs that influenced him and I downloaded all of them, stuff from Albert Collins, Louis Prima, The Beatles, Pantera, James Brown, Howlin' Wolf, Savoy Brown, and others. I'd never heard Savoy Brown before, and I never really listened to Albert Collins much either, so I downloaded a bunch of their stuff as well. Some really good music there. While surfing the net today, I discovered that Rhino Records, through their  urlLink Rhino Handmade  division,  is releasing a bunch of rare Doors material in conjunction with  urlLink the Doors' website/Bright Midnight label  and I found some of that material, a 1970 concert from Detroit. What I've heard from it is great and I plan on buying it, as well as all of their other releases, as soon as I have the money.    Reading : Nothing right now.   Jamming : I've only been playing with my acoustic since I've been sick. I came up with a couple things in open tuning (in G), and last night I worked a bit on that song that JP wrote lyrics to (and changed the music to), but today I got the electric out and have been playing all day. I came up with 2 really cool songs. One of them is based on a bassline that I came up with on the acoustic last week (in F) and I added an Allman Brothers sounding leadline over it, played on slide no less, and the other is a Hendrix sounding jammer. I'm really enjoying the stuff I'm writing, so much so that I'm dying to get my own thing going. I think I may play with JP still, but I will likely keep my material to myself and just focus on his stuff when I'm playing in his band. Which reminds me, JP was supposed to come by before practice tonight to work on that song of mine but he was a no-show. Nice. I'm kind of glad he didn't show though, that gives me more time to write lyrics for that song myself.   Working : Not at all. Still waiting to get over whatever it is I have.   Buying : Not a thing. However, I am jonesing to buy the new Led Zeppelin live CD ("How The West Was Won"). It's a 3-CD set and Best Buy has it on sale for just $16.99 this week... I have to find some way to get it.    Eating : My diet has been consisting mainly of homemade hamburgers (with bacon), McDonald's Cheeseburgers, and oatmeal cookies. I'm about ready to dig into a Boston Market chicken dinner though (with my raw carrots on the side). Getting back to normal, slowly but surely.      Feeling : I've been feeling frustrated and disappointed. I'm ready to be well and get on with things. Physically, I'm still feeling pretty crappy, but better than I have been as of late. My ears are still semi-closed, I'm still wheezy, and my nose is stuffy, but my energy has picked up and the sore throat is entirely gone.    Planning : I plan on getting better, getting auctions listed, getting a job, getting some new musical equipment (amp and a new guitar), paying some bills, getting my own band, and getting a car. I would settle for any of these right now.

        Weird Night, Weirder Mother   Ok, so I tell my Mom about last night, about how I kept changing temperature, and she tells me that she turned the A/C off and then turned it back on later, in the morning. When I was having chills, she thought it'd help me if she turned the air off, but then I guess she started getting warm too, because she turned it back on later. Me, I was so out of it and disoriented, I had no idea she was doing any of this. Nice.   Anyhow, I just got back from the doctor's. I'm loaded up with more free medicines including more antibiotics (Augmentin XR, which are huge) and more decongestants (Entex). I also got a prescription for more of that cough syrup with Codine, which I was hoping to avoid since it makes me too tired, keeping me all out of whack, sleepwise. I am so glad he's been giving me the freebies. I'd really be in much worse shape, financially, if he wasn't doing that.   So... it looks like another week of the same old shit: heavily medicated and out of it. After the new medications run out (if they work), I can start the Allegra. I'm hoping I will feel better by Friday, at least, so I can start putting up auctions again. I wish I was well enought to jam tomorrow night; JP is bringing in a bongo player/percussionist to jam with them. I would have loved that. I talked to him yesterday, I also talked to him about that new song of mine that he had worked on and he played a bit of it for me. He not only changed the chorus structure a bit, but he changed the rhythm patterns and the flow of the song. I told him not to play that one on Thursday because we need to work on it still. The chorus he came up with was pretty bland too, and too much like everything else he's done. I want to make it better, stronger, with more soul. He doesn't put any soul into his singing, something I gots to have, and when it comes to songwriting, he really doesn't seem to understand "flow" or "groove". He's going to come over on Thursday, before practice and we're going to go over that one. We really need to start writing together, instead of him taking my songs and running with them. I've never yet been happy with the results the way we're doing it now.

        Weird Night   I wanted to stay up until around 11pm last night, to get my sleep pattern back to normal since I got up at a normal time, but around 7:45pm I became totally fatigued, my left arm (from the elbow down) and leg (from the knee down) began aching, and I started getting chills. I had to go to bed immediately. I had a blanket and a quilt on but was still chilled all over (except for my head and neck, which were really hot), so I turned my fan all the way down, and that still didn't help. Finally, my Mom brought me a second heavy quilt from her room and that was a little better. At 10pm, my Mom called me to take my pill, as I'd asked, and I did. An hour or so later, I got out of bed and took 3 acetominaphen pills (they're like aspirin), hoping they would help. After a couple more hours, I started getting hot, too hot, I was sweating all over, so I took the second quilt off, then I took the other quilt off and wound up with only the light blanket on and still I was sweating all over. After a few hours of this, I started feeling normal again and eventually put on my regular quilt again. I stayed in bed until 7:30am, when I had to get up and eat something. I hadn't eaten since noon the day before, so I had two oatmeal cookies and some water and headed back to bed. I don't think I slept all night, maybe off and on briefly here and there, but I was pretty much awake and conscious all night long. I think I dreampt a bit, but I was also aware that I wasn't really asleep too. It was a really strange, shitty night. I'm heading for the doctor's office again, in about an hour. I had made the appointment earlier yesterday, at the doctor's request, before last night's weirdness happened. I really hope I get well soon, and quickly ...I am so over this crap.

        Memorial Day   Here's how I spent Monday, Memorial Day: I woke up around 10:30 am, watched about 5 hours of the Trading Spaces marathon on TLC, ate Arby's (tried the new Pot Roast sandwich), and then went to bed around 5:30pm. Truly, a memorable Memorial Day ...not.   I'm still not feeling totally wonderful yet ...I still have some congestion and my ears are semi-closed (with some hearing loss), but for the most part, I am much better than I was. As per my Memorial Day activities, I'm still not sleeping normally and I am still not getting anything accomplished. The new sleep schedule for me now is to get up in the morning, stay up until late afternoon, and then go to bed and stay there until the next morning. I've been spending about 14 or 15 hours a day in bed these last few days. I'll get tired and have to lay down, but then when I'd normally get up, I stay down (I still have a serious lack of energy). I thought the tiredness was the Codine, but I ran out of Codine a day or two ago. I am about to run out of the other two medicines today or tomorrow. Because of all the sleeping, I haven't taken my medications when I'm supposed to, so I have some leftover (I should have finished all of it today). I still haven't went back to the doctors or made an appointment to be seen. I'm trying not to, actually. I just can't afford it and I do not want to continue borrowing from Mom if I don't have to. I will give it until later this week and if I'm not better by then, say Thursday, I will go in again. I have to go in to pay my bounced check and the bounced check fee anyway. I guess that means a 3rd missed band practice as well. Nice. I haven't done any eBaying either, so I have no new money coming in. I need to get well soon so I can get paid soon. If I'm better, I may go to the flea market this weekend and set up a table. I need to do something, and quickly. Before I know it, my Gateway bill will be due again (in about 2 1/2 weeks) and I'll be scrounging for money again. Life is sucking pretty damn hard for me right now.

        Not Yet Wonderful   I'm feeling a little better than before; my throat is better, the congestion is greatly reduced, and my sinuses aren't nearly as bad, but my ears feel no different. They still feel like someone has inflated balloons in my ears, a lot of pressure and discomfort, and my hearing is still impaired. I've been taking antibiotics (Omnicef) since Saturday; shouldn't there be an improvement by now? I have enough left to last me until Monday, and if there's still no difference, I guess I will have to go to the doctor's again (another $55 that I don't have to spend). My cough syrup (Promethazine with Codine) is almost out, and my decongestants (Histex) run out on Tuesday. That's when I start taking Allegra. I think it's probably the Codine, but whatever it is, something has been knocking me out everyday. I am only up for about 5 hours at a time, then I sleep for 7 or 8 hours. Needless to say, I haven't been very productive. I've been watching TV, playing  urlLink marbles  on the PC, and playing guitar in between my "naps". I just haven't had any energy at all. Yesterday morning I was at my most active all week: I sat on the porch and played guitar for about an hour, between 7 and 8 am, then I came in and watched TV. I saw a Steve McQueen movie I hadn't seen before, "Junior Bonner", which was pretty good. I tried staying up all day, to get back to a normal sleep pattern, but it only lasted until about 2 or 3pm. I went to bed and woke up around 12:30am and went back to bed around 4am. I woke up this morning around 8:45am. I pet the cat, Stevie, who woke me up, and then I got up and had coffee and donuts. I made the coffee (and cleaned the coffee maker) while mom ran for donuts. Since then, I showered (for the first time all week), played marbles on the PC, and ate lunch. Not much activity, but at least I'm doing a little more each day. I hope I can stay up all day and get back to a normal sleep pattern, but I just took my Codine, so I don't know if I'll make it past 2 or 3pm again. I have to get a few packages mailed today too, so I need to stay up. Right now, I'm waiting on the mail, to see if I'll have any more packages to mail today. I'd like to list some stuff on eBay tonight too, some CDs and a digital camera that doesn't work (the batteries need to be re-charged). Hopefully, I can get to that tonight too, before my "nap".

        Down Man Being Kicked   Okay, so the doctor's visit was already an unplanned expense, but then, just to make my life worse, I bounced the doctor's check on top of it. My bank is taking a $27 fee for the bounced check, and rather than holding the check for a day, they've sent it back to the doctor's so I'll get to pay an additional $30 fee. Fuck me. I don't have any money to waste on shit like that, certainly not $57. The thing that really pisses me off is that I had the money, it was in transit (I moved it from Paypal to my checking) and it was just waiting for the bank to clear it. If they'd have cleared my Paypal money first, before doing my checks, I would have been okay. I hate my bank, maybe all banks are like this nowadays, but they just don't give a shit about their customers and they just don't use common sense. So, the pittance I made on eBay this week ($107) was pretty wasted. It's going to pay bullshit fees rather than the bills I had planned on paying with it. Now I'll have to borrow money from Mom again, which is something I desperately wanted to avoid doing, or else I'll have to start selling or pawning my belongings. Life really fucking sucks. I'm taking a shitload of medicine, but it doesn't seem to be doing much (the hearing in my ears is at about 50%, and still painful; my throat is better, but still a little sore; I'm still congested, but not as bad as before). I can't start working until I feel better, or at least until I can hear again. I'm down and life is kicking the shit out of me. Thanks, life. Needless to say, I am not a happy camper right now.

        Lately, I've been...     Listening to : I put on my George Carlin "Classic Gold" CD (disc 1) and fell asleep to it a couple times the past few days. My ears are still too inflamed to listen to music.    Watching on TV : I haven't really been watching much of anything, or at least paying attention to much of anything, mostly sitting in front of the PC or else in bed. I did watch "Saturday Night Live" this weekend (great show...Dan Aykroyd hosted for the 1st time ever), I re-watched my favorite episode of NOVA (where they build two medieval trebuchets), and I watched a movie, "The Last Tango In Paris", which was nowhere near as good as I've heard critics make it out to be. In fact, I got bored halfway through it and was ready to change it. Marlon Brando was just plain weird in it, and the dialogue was just dreadful. Maybe that's the way people talk to each other and relate to each other in France, I don't know, but most of it made little sense to me. Also, some of Brando's improvisations, besides being weird, seemed awfully stupid, especially the part about his father making him milk cows before a date, getting cow shit on his shoes, this suppoosedly being the reason he's such a jerk in the film. Still, Brando brought a lot to his character, while the character of his lover, Jeanne, was left quite underdeveloped. There were some worthwhile moments in the film though, some great acting by Brando (when he speaks to his dead wife), but overall, I think the movie was highly overrated and fairly boring. I also tried watching "Scream, Blacula, Scream" again, but I lost interest and near the end, during the movie's climax, I tuned out altogether.    Downloading : I downloaded a few Johnny Winter songs this morning. I started writing a song on guitar last night and I came up with another part to it but I felt it was too similar to a Johnny Winter song, "Mean Town Blues", from Woodstock. I downloaded it and compared it and the part is pretty similar, but is used in a different way. I don't know if I should change it or not, after all, with blues, almost everything is borrowed from someone else. I listened to tow versions of his song, studio and live, and liked them so much I downloaded a few more to check out. I don't think I've ever had any of his albums, but I may have had a cassette of his back in the '80's. I should get some of his CDs.     Reading : I haven't started anything new yet. I've been struggling to get sleep lately (from my sore head/ears), and I didn't want to waste any "bed time" reading.    Jamming : As I mentioned, I started wring a blues song yesterday, it's in open tuning (G) and some of it is with a slide, some not. I also sat for an hour the other night and went through all of my old songs and played many again for the first time in years. Some of my stuff isn't bad, usually the music and melodies are great, but the lyrics are always too weak, too simple and bland. I may throw a couple of them in at the next band practice, if there is one. I still havent' talked to JP about quitting yet. I'm still undecided. I think what I may do is just keep my songs to myself until I've finished them, not letting him re-write or add anything, that way, if I break away, I will still have my own material. I can accept playing in his backup band for now, but I have trouble with him putting his name on my songs, especially in cases where I'm not happy with what he's added. He wants to get the new one copyrighted already and I'm not gung-ho on that idea at all. I need to call him to let him know that I can't play this week either. My ears haven't opened up yet, still inflamed and painful, and the amplifiers would absolutely kill me, like daggers in my ears. I hope to be ready next week though.   Working : As if. Because of all the delays, I'm thinking that, as soon as I'm well, I will go to Olsten Staffing, a temp service I've worked for before, and work as a temp for a bit, to get some money in quickly.    Buying : I have no job, no extra money, a ton of bills, and people I owe money too...I can't afford to buy anything. However... me being the impulsive shithead that I am, I bid on and won Doyle Bramhall II's out-of-print debut CD, still sealed, for $19.50 (includes shipping). I've seen it sell for twice what I paid for it. Luckily, payment is due in 30 days, so that gives me time if I need it.    Eating : My diet for the last 5 or 6 days has consisted soley of: McDonald's Cheeseburgers, biscuits (with apple butter), chicken noodle soup, and I've also been drinking a lot of hot tea, water, and Gatorade.    Feeling : Like life has kicked me in the sphincter yet again.   Planning : I'm planning on getting well. All other plans are on hold until then.

        Doctor's Visit   I just got back from the doctor's office, and it appears that my days as an amateur diagnostician are over. The white circles on my tonsils and throat are not Strep, but ulcerations caused from all of the coughing and whatnot. D'oh! I got in and out of there in a little less than an hour, which wasn't too bad. The best part: he loaded me with freebies! I got four bags of free medicine: antibiotics, nasal spray, and pills for my congestion. I only have to buy one thing, a Codine cough syrup. I mentioned that I lost my job because of all the time calling in sick, and I also mentioned that the last antibiotics he prescribed cost me $75 and didn't work, and I think he took pity on me, hence the freebies (which helps me out big time). He also gave me free Allegra allergy pills and gave me a refillable prescription for those (5 times). I talked to him a little, asking him why I keep getting sick and asking  how I can prevent it. He said it's most likely allergies, which have been a problem my whole life, but hadn't been too bad until late last year (perhaps around the time we got the new cats). I hope the Allegra works, it'd be nice to get back in the flow again, instead of always falling behind.

        What's Up Doc?   Well, I will find out soon. I have to go to the doctor's today. They open shortly and I'm going to try and get in. Besides the congestion, the coughing, and stuffy sinuses, it hurts like a bitch to swallow and my ears are getting worse and worse, more and more painful. I keep getting feverish too. I checked on the internet last night and found that I have  all  of the symptoms of Strep Throat. I looked in the mirror, with the aid of a flashlight, and the back of my throat is  bright red . There are also little white circles on my tonsils and throat, they look like canker sores or something, all symptoms of Strep. It's too bad I have to pay the doctor for a diagnosis when I already know what I have. I wish I could just call up and get a prescription. But that's not the real world, and I ain't Elvis. I also can't afford to go to the doctors. With no insurance, I'm going to have to borrow money from Mom, which is the last thing I wanted to do. I may have to sell or pawn something to pay her back. This sucks on so many levels, it ain't funny.  I have done very little these past days, other than watching TV or playing on the computer. I certainly haven't been sleeping. I just can't stay asleep for more than an hour at a time before the throat, the coughing, and the congestion get me up. I feel terrible; run down and beaten. I was supposed to have my niece and both nephews down this weekend while their parents did something special together, but that's not going to happen now. My Mom's going up there instead. I've been doing a lot of thinking too, mostly about the band situation I'm in. I'm really leaning towards getting out now. I don't like the situation, I don't like the direction JP wants to go in (nor do I like the directions he won't allow us to go in), and I don't like his laziness when it comes to learning covers. I learned the solo to "Crazy Little Thing Called Love", but when I played it with the band last time, it sounded like total shit. I said at the time that they must not be playing something right, and his reply was along the lines of "well do something different then", rather than "ok, I'll see what's wrong and fix it". I looked into it myself and I think they're playing the first part of the solo section wrong. Instead of playing Bb-D,  I'm pretty sure they're playing G-C, which totally throws the solo off. I really dislike his lack of professionalism in that area, and the lack of commitment to the music. I also don't like the additions/changes he's made to my songs. I had hoped he'd make them better, but he usually makes them more common sounding. I want to get to a whole 'nother level, musically, but I don't think I'll get there with this band. I may not be ready to play with the band this week because of my ear infection and Strep Throat (which is highly contagious), but I should be back the week after. I will have to have a talk with him sometime in between. He won't be happy, especially since it looks like we're finally going to have his old drummer playing with us, but I told him it would be a see-and-decide-later situation with me when I entered into it.  Who knows, maybe he'll have a change of heart... or maybe I will. I guess we shall see.

        Le Miserable   That would be me. I haven't slept yet, even though I tried to sleep several times last night. My ears are absolutely killing me, throbbing, plus I can't breath well, I'm coughing a lot, phlegmy (I hate that word: phlegm...yuk!), wheezing like mad, and now I've developed conjuctivitus or something in one of my eyes (it may have spread to both as everything looks hazy to me right now). I'm a fucking mess. Earlier, yesterday, I got dizzy a bit and nearly fell over, probably because of my ears. Mom brought home McDonald's cheeseburgers, my "sick food". Everytime I get really sick, that's the only food I want to eat, comfort food, I guess. She also brought home some Ginger Ale and 7-Up for me. I mostly sat in front of the TV all night (I finally watched "Orange County", which was pretty decent... very funny individual performances throughout), until 1am when I tried to go to sleep on the couch. I just couldn't get comfortable there, so after an hour or two, I got up and went to my bed, and tried to sleep again. I started getting really hot and the wheezing was driving me mental and I just couldn't sleep. After an hour or so of trying, I got up again and watched TV. Around 6:10am, I had my mom take my temperature, since I couldn't figure out how to read our stupid thermometer when I tried earlier. She had the same trouble that I did. It's nearly impossible to read, really poorly made. On her first try, she said I was about normal, but the second time, she said it was right about 100. Both times, it took her almost a full minute to read it, so I'm thinking my temperature might be higher. I certainly felt like I was burning up. I put a cold compress on my head and took some aspirin and tried to sleep, but here I am, up again, and still awake. Shit. I've said it before: I am sick and tired of being sick and tired. I wish I knew why I get sick so frequently. I wonder if it's our air vents (in 30 years, I don't think they've ever been cleaned out or replaced), or whether it's something in the air (we live next to a highway, plus, across the street is the dump, where they burn trash all day and night). All I know is that I've had this same illness 3 or 4 times this year already and that just shouldn't be. It even happens the same way each time, with the post-nasal drip/sore throat/stuffy nose phase, to the heavy congestion/runny nose phase with the earaches (from all the coughing and nose blowing). It seems like I keep getting the same exact thing over and over again and I wish I knew why so I could prevent it. In the meantime, I will be out of action for a few more days at the least. I'll tell you what: if I'd gotten a new job already, I'd be screwed...big time.

        Frankenstein   As I mentioned in my previous post, I am feeling pretty shitty. I decided to go to bed early, 2am, as I had begun feeling even worse. I started reading a book to help me get sleepy, but I guess I picked the wrong book because here it is six and a half hours later and I just finished reading  the entire book . I can't believe I read the whole thing! The book I chose, as you might surmise from my heading, was Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein". It wasn't an easy read because of the language of the period, but it was an enjoyable one nonetheless. Quite different from what I'd expected. Having seen several of the old "Frankenstein" movies, I'd assumed the book was going to be similar, but it was much, much different. I heard the last Frankenstein movie, the one with DeNiro in it, is supposed to follow the actual book, whereas the others got the Hollywood treatment (totally sensationalized and only vaguely similar to the book). I can't see DeNiro as an eight-foot tall monster, but I can see why they chose him, after all, his character in "Cape Fear" is very similar to the monster in the Mary Shelley book. I will have to check that one out. I guess I will go and try to sleep again, though with the throbbing in my ears and the inability to breathe through my nose very well, that may not be such an easy thing to do. I don't know which book to start next: "Les Miserables" or "Lord Of The Flies", but I have a feeling I'm going to begin one of them shortly.

        Lately, I've been...     Listening to : Except for a few things I downloaded on the computer the other day, nothing at all. Between my toothache and my earache, I've been in the mood for silence.    Watching on TV : "Tough Crowd", "Everybody Loves Raymond", "The Simpsons", and "Seinfeld", the NBA Playoffs, "Inside The NBA" (with Ernie, Kenny, and Charles...more entertaining than the playoff games), "The Osbournes", "Jackass", "Fear Factor", and "Trigger Happy TV". I'm pretty disappointed in the new "Trigger Happy TV" episodes. The original British series was outstanding, always clever and ballsy and funny, then they went and Americanized it, and now it's nowhere near as good, in fact, at times, it's pretty stupid. By the way, I'm usually doing stuff on the computer when the TV is on, so I don't actually watch TV as much as it seems I do; it's usually just on in the background.     Downloading : After the Ben Harper concert, I downloaded some of his stuff, rare stuff I hadn't heard before (covers, live performances, whatever...). I haven't done anything since then, though, like I said, I've been in the mood for peace and quiet.    Reading : I started and finished "Proof" (by Dick Francis) this week. It was a good book, interesting, exciting at times, and well written, but I kind of guessed where it was heading and the wine and horse racing stuff, though interesting, didn't really hold my interest. It would make a more exciting TV show, in the Columbo vein. I'm not sure what I'll start next, but the way I'm feeling, I should be in bed a lot this week and will want to read something.      Jamming : I cancelled out of practice for tomorrow. I haven't practiced all week either, because of my ears. They feel clogged, have since the last practice. I'm sure the concerts haven't helped either. I talked to JP tonight. He worked more on that new song I started last week, even made a slight change to the music (which shouldn't hurt anything). He may practice with Al anyway. He was talking about going into the studio again in June and re-recording some stuff and maybe recording some new stuff, including the new song I started. He said when he goes in, he'll do it all under his name, not the band's name, since he's footing the bill. I'm not sure what that's all about; is he being vain or is he hinting that me and Al should contribute money to the studio project? I'm confused. I'm in a weird situation with him anyway, and this just muddies things even more. I'm in  his  band, doing  his  music, and  his  choice of covers... it doesn't feel as much like a real "band" than it does a "backing band". If we're really a "band", then I think we should all have a fair say in what we do "as a band". We still haven't worked in any of the covers I suggested, but we've learned new ones he's throw in since. I'm getting frustrated already. I just have to remember that playing in a backing band is still better than not playing at all. I think I need to work harder on putting my own band together.     Working : I listed auctions this week, but I still haven't begun looking for an actual job yet (aside from scanning the newspapers). My sleep schedule is still out of whack, with me going to sleep sometime after 8am and getting up sometime after 5pm, so unless I change that, I will remain unemployed.       Buying : I broke down and bought that Otis Redding 3-CD set the other day and then I bought my Mom a purple purse for Mother's Day. I haven't bought anything besides those two purchases.    Eating : Mostly TV dinners, Stouffer's BBQ chicken strips and their nasty ass Lasagna (sucks bad). I had been on an Oatmeal cookie kick, but sadly, I ran out a few days ago. Must...get...more...  I'm thinking about making a BLT tonight, but that will take some effort, and I'm not really in the mood to put out any effort. I might just go for another TV dinner...   Feeling :  Like shit. My throat, sinuses, and ears are bothering me a lot. My jaw is still sensitive due to the bad toothache I've had all week, and I feel a headache coming on. Like I said, like shit.   Planning : I'm planning on eating something and then going to bed sometime afterwards. I also plan on getting up sometime tomorrow. That's about it for now.

        Mother's Day   For Mother's Day this year, my mom got the house to herself all day (I went to bed around 6:15am), I bought her a purple leather purse on eBay (she's a purple freak), and I watched my two nephews while my sister, brother-law, niece and mom went out to dinner at my mom's favorite restaurant (Arigato). I woke up & got out of bed when they all got here. I re-loaded Beachhead 2000 on my computer for my older nephew, Jesse, and put the "Spiderman" movie on for the younger one, Austin. This bought me enough time to wake up and get myself something to eat.   I made hamburgers for me and a hot dog for Austin. After chow, I took the kids outside to play for a bit. I played catch with Jesse (whiffle ball plus plastic scoops to catch with) and Austin "killed ants", his favorite pastime, with a spray bottle filled with warm water and dish soap (we probably have the cleanest ants around). It was hot and humid outside, so I decided to try something with them that I used to do when I was a kid, something fun that would keep us cool: I make a poor man's slip'n'slide for them.   I taped 3 trash bags together and hosed them down with water, then poured dishwashing liquid all over the bags, making them slippery. The kids loved it. They were sliding and flopping all over the place. I was spraying them down the whole time too. After awhile, everyone came back from dinner and came around to see what we were up to. One of my sister's friends, who we both grew up with, Jenny, showed up with her daughter. I wound up hosing everbody down, then I had the boys flop into mud and told them to go hug everybody. It's good to be an Uncle. I hosed myself down too and hugged Jenny, my sister, and my niece.   After we got changed and dried, we went in and me, my sister, Dana (my niece), and Jesse, looked through family photos for awhile. We went out and put on an old family video for Dana. I found a tape from when she was around 10 years old and was acting like a total dork and wanted to show it to her. She was so embarrassed, she couldn't believe it!   They all left around 8:30pm. Once again, I got into an argument with the younger nephew. I'm glad his mother actually took my side this time. He was picking his nose and I told him to use a Kleenex (which was maybe 8 feet away from him) and he responded by making a smartass face at me and sticking his finger up his nose even further. His mom jumped on him for it and then he went off and pouted. His mom said to just ignore him. He kept staring at me like I did something mean to him, and then he started talking shit about me ("I don't want to see Gary's face anymore...he's mean...he's a jerk!") as he left to stand by the front door. And then he started mocking everyone while we were watching and laughing at the video. Neither his mom or dad did a thing about it, so I yelled at him and told him to cut the shit. I hate always having to be the "bad guy", but goddamn,  someone  has to discipline him. Finally, his mom set him straight, told him to come back over there and stop acting like a jerk, explaining that I was was right to tell him to stop picking his nose. I hope she keeps doing that, otherwise he's going to turn out to be a jerk when he grows up, not respecting anyone. I love my family, but they really piss me off sometimes.

        Ben Harper Concert   Last night was terrible for me. My toothache got worse and worse all night (like a dumbass, I kept messing with it). The weird part: the tooth that aches is actually a crown, not a real tooth. I'd had a root canal several years ago, so there shouldn't even be a nerve there, but it is incredibly painful and sensitive right now. Do nerves grow back? I tried going to bed early, but only stayed down a few hours.  I got up and got my mailings ready and goofed around for awhile. Around 4am, I got back into bed and started reading "Proof" a book by Dick Francis. I got tired and tried to fall asleep, but after a bit, I had to get up again to put some Orajel on my toothache. It was after daylight when I finally fell asleep. I kept going in and out of sleep all day. I started worrying, that between the toothache and lack of sleep, I wouldn't be able to go to the concert. I forced myself to stay in bed until 6pm. I wasn't tired, but the toothache was causing my jaw and ear to hurt. Regardless, I got up and got ready to go to the show. I'm very glad I did.   JP arrived about 20 minutes later than he'd planned, but we got to Ruth Eckerd Hall and were in our seats in plenty of time. The opening band, Mofro, came out and promptly knocked me out. They were great! I had downloaded some of their stuff the other day to check them out, but their CD does them no justice. The singer played some wild ass harmonica, very reminiscent of Robert Plant's playing on some of the early Zeppelin albums, and had a great, bluesy voice. Their keyboard player had a very Doors-like sound on a lot of songs. The whole band was great, really. They played for about an hour. After their set, JP ran out to the lobby and bought their CD (as well as Ben Harper's first CD as well). I'll bet he's glad he did that now.   After the stagehands cleared Mofro's gear off the stage, Ben and his band, The Innocent Criminals came out. Wow! What a great show! Ben was in very good voice, and his guitar playing was excellent, but what really blew me away was when he sat down and played the slide guitar. He was just phenomenal. His bassist took two solos during the show and was impressive (very, very funky). The percussionist was really something special too. Hell, the whole band was great! They played:   Don't Take That Attitude To Your Grave Excuse Me Mr. I Shall Not Walk Alone Brown Eyed Blues Temporary Remedy Everything Ground On Down Sexual Healing Steal My Kisses Diamonds On The Inside Touch From Your Lust Alone So High So Low Burn One Down   1st encore: Please Bleed Walk Away Waiting On An Angel Roses From My Friends Pleasure and Pain Blessed To Be A Witness  2nd encore: With My Own Two Hands/War   They played about 3 hours, including 2 encores! For the first encore, Ben came out alone and played a short acoustic set. It was great getting to hear him play like that. Right before he went into "Waiting For An Angel", the sound system went out. He played anyway. With no amplification, we all had to be absolutely silent so we could hear him. That was really something, a very strange and beautiful thing. Leave it to one asshole in the back to try and ruin the moment for everybody. Ben, heard almost as a whisper (or a prayer) was singing this really beautiful song, and some jackass yells out "Louder!!!", to everyone's disgust. During the next song, the same idiot yells out "The best slide player ever!!!" He yelled it again and someone else yelled out "Shut up a-hole!!" ... I swear I saw Ben flash a brief smile at that. Thankfully, the system came back up again, so only 1 1/2 songs were interrupted. After a few more acoustic songs, the band came out and joined him again and they played several more songs. At the end of the set they thanked everyone again and it looked like the end of the show, so everybody started heading out. I saw that they hadn't turned anything off onstage yet, nor had they brought the house lights up, so JP and I hung out a little longer. Glad we did: they played a 2nd encore! They did "With My Own Two Hands" with a bit of Bob Marley's "War" mixed into it.   After the show, JP headed out to the back, to try and get an autograph. There were about 20 or 30 of us out there, but people began leaving after an hour or so. Eventually there was just JP, me, and six others (two couples, two other guys). Ben's percussionist, Leon Mobley, came over and talked with us and signed things for some people. He seemed really nice, shaking everyone's hand and chatting with us. We saw Ben come out and go to his bus and one of the guys yelled for him to come over and he said he would. Maybe ten or fifteen minutes later, he did. What a great guy. He was very gracious and friendly, thanking all of us, shaking everyone's hand, and signing things for everyone. He signed the cover of his "Welcome To The Cruel World" CD that JP had just bought between sets and he even signed the CD itself (without JP asking him to). I usually don't ask for autographs myself, but I had him sign my ticket stub. He hung out and talked for maybe ten minutes. He was talking about how he liked seeing a nice cross section of people at this show (the older, Ruth Eckerd season ticket holders mixed with people my age and the teenage crowd) and said that he had even had several generations of one family at one of his recent shows. I said something like "yeah, good music can cross any boundry" and he seemed genuinely appreciative of that (he even made a point to shake my hand again before he left). Pretty darn cool...

        No Power, No Luck   I went to bed early last night as planned, at 1am, but I didn't get to sleep until around 9 or 10am. Almost as soon as I laid down, the electricity went out. Without the fan next to my bed or the a/c running, my room got stuffy very quickly. I just could not sleep. I tried, for a good hour and a half, but eventually, I had to get up.   I went in to check on my mom, to make sure her alarm clock wasn't going to get screwed up. She seemed concerned, so I lit some candles, grabbed the phone book for her and she called the power company. The power was out for my neighborhood and the surrounding businesses (very strange sight, sort of like that Twilight Zone episode where Burgess Meredith finds himself all alone after a nuclear blast), but they said it would be back on by 3am. It didn't come back on until 4:30am.   In the meantime, I played guitar. I sat outside with it for awhile, then came in and played a bit (by candlelight). I came up with some song ideas and lyrics for an older song. I was dead tired by then though.   I tried to lay down on the couch, it was cooler in the living room than in my bedroom, but a minute or so after I laid down, the power came back on. I went over and turned my computer on (to make sure the outage didn't harm it), but that was a mistake. I wound up playing  urlLink the marble game  until sometime around 8am, when I finally went to bed again.   I had a very hard time sleeping, even though I was tired as hell. I got up around 2:30pm. My alarm was set for 2pm, but instead of getting up, I just laid there.   I did get up eventually, after I remembered that an eBay auction I was watching was going to be going off very soon, an Otis Redding 3-CD set. I got there with 11 minutes left on it, and won it for $11 plus $3 shipping. It is brand new, still sealed, and the seller is someone I've dealt with before, so I know it'll be well packaged and mailed quickly.   After that, I went out to check the mail and I found that they tried to deliver a package I had been waiting for for a couple of weeks (2 Hendrix CDs), but I hadn't been up to sign for it, so now I have to go pick it up or wait until Tuesday or Wednesday to have them re-deliver it. Yay. I had also missed the bug lady, our exterminator, who had been here sometime after 1pm. My mom didn't leave the door unlocked for her or leave a key, even after I told her I probably wouldn't be up when she got there, so she only sprayed outside, not inside where we really need it. That's two misses, here's the third and shittiest of them all: I found out I had won a pair of tickets to the Ben Harper concert from the Weekly Planet website, but since neither me or my mom check our answering machines messages very often, I learned this only an hour and a half before their offices would close for the weekend. I had to pick them up, in Tampa, by 5pm or else lose them. I lost them. I called all of my friends and family, but couldn't reach most of them or else they couldn't do it. That could have been a lot of fun. I was going to give a ticket to who ever picked them up and give the other one to my nephew, so he could see his first concert. Shit.

        Lately, I've been...     Listening to : I had Ben Harper's "Burn To Shine" CD on today...great album! I'd forgotten how good it was. I can't wait to see him live on Saturday! Woo hoo!   Watching on TV : Right now, an old "Monty Python's Flying Circus" is on, but I'm only half-watching it. This week, the only show I've really been watching is "Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn". I've had shows like "The Daily Show", Howard Stern, "Crank Yankers", and basketball (the NBA Playoffs) on too, but I only half-watched those. I just haven't been paying much attention to the TV this week. I did watch a movie the other night though, "What Do You Say To A Naked Lady?", which was movie by the people who made Candid Camera (Allen Funt). It's a look at how people react to sex, different generations, from a very '60's perspective (it was released in 1970, I believe) complete with dopey, hippie-dippy songs throughout. Very cheesy, but interesting. Plus, it contained a lot of nudity and that's enough for me ; )   I also tried watching "Scream, Blacula, Scream" too, but I barely paid any attention to it. Seemed amusing enough though.    Downloading : I downloaded the new Ben Harper CD and gave it a listen. Pretty good stuff, though not quite as good as "Burn To Shine" or some of the others he's put out, but definitely worth buying. I also downloaded Television's "Marquee Moon" CD. I'd never heard it before (I hadn't heard  anything  from the band), but I've always heard great things about the album (from music critics/reviewers), so I gave it a try. I heard four or five songs from it earlier today and I really like what I heard. The guitars are really good, very interesting and inventive. I'm not a big fan of that style of singing, but it seems to work well with the music. I liked it. I'll have to buy it eventually.    Reading : I read "Once A Warrior King" by David Donovan earlier this week. It's the story of his time spent in Vietnam as a "military advisor" to the local Vietnamese fighters. Very interesting read, and from a different perspective than I'd heard before.    Jamming : We jammed tonight with Jimmy, the drummer from the old incarnation of this band. His band (the other half of the old band) hasn't practiced in ages and he must be getting tired of not playing. I don't think he'll be back next week (he's going out of town), but we may have him back after that. He's better than any of the others we've played with. We played a new one that I came up with earlier today and JP added lyrics to it. It sounded really, really good and everyone dug it. I think it's called "Get Back Home" right now, but JP may change the lyrics still. We really didn't do many originals tonight. JP's "As Low As It Gets" and "Promise You The Moon", which I changed again.. more singing at the beginning, no more guitar part. It's coming together slowly and is sounding better all the time. We also did his GAB song, but I would like to work on that one more. Since the chord changes are all G-A-B in the verse  and  chorus, I'd like to make each section sound more distinct. Plus, JP does this little lead line, a signature lick for the song, but he's only doing it once, as an intro, and I think he needs to do it again. We did a ton of covers, butchering some, kicking ass on others. We added a couple of older songs to the mix, "Feelin' Alright" and "All Right Now", plus I threw "After Midnight" out and we jammed on that one too. We also played Sheryl Crow's "If It Makes You Happy" and a Sister Hazel song (not sure what it's called). We did "You May Be Right", "Old Apartment", "The Way", "Before You Accuse Me", "American Girl", "Stuck In The Middle", and "Crazy Little Thing Called Love". I finally learned the solo (mostly) for "Crazy Little Thing Called Love", but when I played it, it sounded way off. I think the music they're playing beneath it was wrong, maybe in the wrong key. I'll have to check on that. It was disappointing. I thought I had finally nailed it. It was a pretty loose practice tonight. Al and I even jammed on several of the riffs that I kept throwing out. It was pretty loud too. Jimmy plays pretty loud, and I found myself turning up a lot tonight to match him. I had some sound problems tonight, I kept picking up radio on my guitar or pedal (maybe the combination of the two). Weird...   Working : I haven't started looking yet. Next week, hopefully. I got up earlier today and I'm going to head to bed earlier tonight, so I should be getting back on track. I have my scanner, I'm online again, so I will have to list a bunch of auctions this weekend, well, Sunday anyway. Got that concert to go to on Saturday night. I might list some tomorrow. I really need to get some money flowing in.     Buying : Nothing. I owe everybody and don't have much coming in, so I've resisted tha temptation... so far.    Eating :  Little Debbie oatmeal cookies! I had Arby's tonight (roast beef sandwiches). The rest of the week I've eaten: a Boston Market TV dinner (country fried chicken), eggs, waffles, hamburgers, corn, keilbasa, and tomatoes. I'm dying for something good (translation: something bad for me) like pizza or Stavros again.    Feeling : Tired, out of it. I have a headache coming on too (my ears are sore from the noise level tonight).   Planning : My plans are pretty much the same as last week. I plan on getting my sleep schedule back on track so I can start looking for a job. I need to get a job, then, I need to lay away a nice Amplifier. A second guitar would be nice too. I would love to get an SG, if not another Strat.

        To Ben!   The guy in Virginia with the Ben Harper tickets emailed me saying he sent the tickets out today (via Priority mail)! Sweet! I got ahold of JP and he said he'll go with me. He's going to let me knock $20 off of what I owe him for his ticket, so now I owe him $60 (CSN wasn't cheap). I think I'll send the guy $45 for the tickets: $25 for mine, $20 for JP's. He'll be out $25, but it's still better than being out the full $70. Woo hoo! I'm excited! This is going to be great!   In other news, my new scanner arrived today, but instead of hooking it right up, I connected the adapter from the new scanner with my old scanner and it worked. The old adapter must've went bad. So now I have two working scanners. I wish I had known beforehand that it was just the adapter, I could've saved $120. Oh well... at least I'm up and running again and will be able to list some auctions this week. I just have to get some money flowing in here... and soon!

        To Ben, or Not To Ben...   I may have a pair of tickets for this Saturday's Ben Harper concert coming but I won't know for sure until tomorrow. I checked out the message board on  urlLink Ben's website  and found someone with a pair that he can't use (his trip to Florida has been cancelled). The guy's in Virginia, so if he can't do something with them soon, he'll be out the $70 he put into them. Of course, me being without a job and having no friends willing to put out face value for a ticket, I simply can't afford $70. So... I asked him initially about trading for them and he said that's a possibility (I could send him some CDs or something), maybe a half trade/half cash thing, but I let him know that, because of my situation, I could only do about $40-$50 for them. He really would like to see the tickets used, plus he'd like to get something for them (as opposed to nothing), so it looks like he's going to send them out to me tomorrow and then we'll negotiate further from there. They're really decent seats too (not that there's a bad seat in Ruth Eckerd Hall), Row N, seats 15 & 16. Now I just have to wait to see if he's going to send them, and then I have to find someone willing to buy my spare. I've already asked Sue, and now I have to check with JP and Rob. If I strike out all around, I might just take my nephew, Jesse, who's never been to a concert. It's funny; when I had a job, I never went anywhere or did anything, and since I quit, I've went to two concerts and may be heading to my third. Go figure.

        Can't Catch The Z's   I can't get my sleep schedule back on track. I went to bed early (well, early  for me ), around 2:15am, and here it is after 7am and I'm still awake. I got out of bed about a half an hour ago; my mind wasn't shutting down and I couldn't get comfortable to save my life. I  feel  tired, but I'm up and sitting here typing this. I got into bed and started thinking good thoughts, happy thoughts about my own little Utopian world... but then I started obsessing on that stuff, so I switched up and started thinking about money, which is a bigtime bedtime no-no and monly made things worse. Then I had to get up to pee. Plus, my sore throat is sore, and bothering me. add to that the cat, who kept wanting to get pet or else, when he was sleeping, kept me mindful and alert so as not to roll over on him. Ugh! I can't win!   I don't know that it's going to get any better anytime soon either. Money is going to be a big concern for awhile and will no doubt, continue to keep me awake when I should be sleeping. I tried to hook up my scanner tonight (so I could sell some cards and CDs online) and found that it no longer works. I had to order a new one (thank goodness for Gateway and their credit line), but it won't be here for another 3 to 5 days, temporarily cutting off a possible source of money for me. I have about $50 to my name right now, which I nearly spent on Ben Harper tickets last night (I lost the auction), and I need a minimum of $200 to get me through the month. There's no getting around it: I need a job. However, it's going to be nearly impossible to start looking for one with my sleep schedule so out of whack. I have to get normal again somehow but when I try to sleep, well, I believe I've already explained that. It seems my life is a series of Catch-22 situations, one after the other. Sheer madness.

        Jesse's Birthday   I didn't think I was going up to New Port Richey afterall, but I made it. I didn't fall asleep until nearly 10am. I picked up and started reading a book ("Once A Warrior King") at bedtime. That was 3:30am, and then I kept on reading and reading and reading until way past sunrise. I got through half the book last night. I just wasn't tired, plus I had been on alert since the gray cat found a roach crawling up my wall shortly after I got in bed. Freaked me out. I jumped out of bed and killed it, but then I kept looking around, making sure there were no more. I hate those fuckers! We usually don't have many here, and rarely do I ever see them in my bedroom. We have an exterminator spray here regularly, but it must've worn off already because I see (and am killing) about one per day lately. She sprays again on Friday... so hooray for that. I finally got to sleep around 10am and slept til about 3:15pm, when my Mom woke me up. That was enough sleep, I guess. I didn't feel too bad, so I got up, showered, and we left for New Port Richey. We hung out at my sisters for about 15 minutes waiting on the kids grandparents to show up. After they arrived, we split for Red Lobster. I had my sister take me to Circuit City while we waited for a table (it was only a couple blocks away) and I bought my nephew a Scorpions CD ("20th Century Masters", a "best of" collection). I gave it to him later, after we finished eating. I kept teasing him throughout dinner about which CD I bought ("Brittany ...something, or maybe it was Backstreet something... hmmm"), but he was pretty happy with the one I picked out. We all chowed down big time at Red Lobster. Myself, I had a jumbo shrimp cocktail, a caesar salad, shrimp pasta, and a sirloin steak.  Mmm-mmm... good! We also had some chocloate cake at the end, for my nephew's birthday (Jesse and his Dad, whose birthday was last week, each had their own cake actually). His dadhad  invited along another couple and their kids along with us for dinner, so their were 13 of us in the party. The guy he had invited along, Eric, used to live across the street from me. We grew up together, so I goofed on him and joked with him during dinner a bunch. His wife doesn't know me, and Eric didn't introduce me, so I'm not sure what she must have thought about the loud fat guy who made the bad jokes (that would be me). After dinner, we headed back to my sister's and I played outside with Jesse and his sister, Dana, until about 9:30pm. We were hitting a tennis ball back and forth to each other. My little nephew, Austin, was being a jerk. He kept getting in the way, kept picking on my other nephew, making fun of him everytime he missed a ball, and then whined until his Dad got sick of hearing it and made Jesse give him a turn, which turned into about 10-12 turns. Then he got his skateboard out and kept doing it in the space where we were playing tennis. He's spoiled beyond belief. My sister's fault. I told him, if he was my kid, his ass would be burning from the smackdown I'd have laid on him. His parents threaten to, but then never follow through, so he knows he can get away with almost anything. He has no respect for adults, does what he wants, and refuses to listen. I have a strained relationship with him. The other two always get along great with me, and we always have a good time. I'm hoping he'll change his ways eventually, more importantly, I hope his mother changes her ways with him. After we came in from playing outside, I played around with Jesse on the computer, showing hime some of the fun or funny sites I've found (snowflakes, the DJ site, and the fireworks one). I find all kinds of cool stuff at listolinks.com, a great site. Me and Mom split for home around 10:30pm and got home about an hour later. I've been playing around on the PC since then. I'm about ready to head to bed shortly; I want to read some more, and hopefully, fall asleep at a decent hour so I can get back to my usual sleep schedule. I really need to get a job soon.

        Food, TV, Spiderman, MTV, A Birthday, & More Food   What a boring night. I ran around a little this afternoon, to the post office, to the bank, and then to Stavros for my greek salad and a gyro, then came home and chowed down. I'd been jonesing for a Stavros Greek salad for days. After that, I played around on the PC for awhile and then I wound up taking a nap sometime around 7pm. I got up around 8:30 and then I half-watched "Oceans Eleven" (the remake... pretty good movie... I'll have to watch it again though). I was going to watch "Saturday Night Live" tonight (it was a live show tonight), but I absolutely HATE HATE HATE the guy who was hosting this week, Ashton Kutcher (an untalented prettyboy), so I boyotted the show. Instead, I watched "Spiderman" ... finally. I just may have been the last person in America to have seen it. I thought it was ok, there were some cool parts, but then there were some parts that just made me scratch my head and ask "why" or "how". For instance, where did the high tech Spidey costume suddenly come from? Surely it cost more than the $100 he got from the wrestling match, and he didn't get a job until well after the Spidey costume appeared, so how did he get it? I didn't think the Green Goblin made much sense either. He had Spiderman alone on a rooftop and could have killed him, eliminating the only person who could have destroyed him, but instead, he tries to get him to be his buddy? Didn't the Goblin already kill a bunch of people whom he considered threats? And yet, here he has  the greatest single threat  to him, isolated and vulnerable, and he  lets him go ? Ok....whatever. My other complaint was the action scenes, the computer animation. Other movies have done much more realistic jobs with the computer animation, the last Star Wars for instance, but a lot of the scenes in "Spiderman" looked almost like they came from an arcade game and just weren't very convincing. The physics just weren't true to life and you can't convince the eye any diifferently. It was an okay movie, but they should've worked a little harder to get everything just right. Anywhoo... I have to go to bed again shortly, gotta get up a little earlier tomorrow to head uo to New Port Richey for my nephew Jesse's birthday. He'll be eleven tomorrow. I asked him if there were any CDs he wanted (I love giving music). He surpised me and asked me to get him a Scorpions CD... how cool is that? Everyone else his age is listening to the typical MTV dreck, just like his sister (I think my niece is beyong saving, musically ...MTV and BET have her soul), but my nephew has promise. I always feel like Yoda talking to Luke Skywalker when I talk to my niece about music "trust not the MTV, young Skywalker, for evil it is." But my nephew already has CDs of Dio, AC/DC, Dokken (all stuff I got for him), and now he wants some Scorpions. It's still a long way off from Hendrix, Dylan, the Beatles, and other classic bands, but it's a start. Beats the shit out of Eminem, 50 Cent, and Brittany Spears. We're all supposed to go out to Red Lobster for dinner tomorrow. I hate doing that though, because his grandparents  always  end up buying for everyone. They're rich and can afford to do that, and I guess his grandmother enjoys doing it too, but I always feel like a mooch having them pay for my meal. It'd be nice to be able to return the favor sometime, but neither me nor my Mom can afford to do it. I hate being in that situation, so that's bad, but on the plus side,  I'll be eating Red Lobster for dinner  .   (kicking it Homer style)  Mmmmmmm......(drool).....lobster.

        Lately, I've been...     Listening to : The last CD I put on was Zebra's first album, but that was almost a week ago. I haven't spent much time in my room lately, where I normally listen to my CDs.   Watching on TV : "Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn", "Real Time with Bill Maher" (no more live shows until late July, dammit), "Insomniac with Dave Attell", "Seinfeld", and Howard Stern. I haven't been watching much TV lately.   Downloading : Geez, everything. I had to wipe my hard drive and re-load everything, then I had to load and download all kinds of stuff that I had on my computer before. I got Kazaalite back and I downloaded some stuff like George Carlin's "Napalm and Silly Putty" 2 CD audiobook, a bunch of stuff from the "A Mighty Wind" soundtrack, and Graham Nash's "Military Madness" (which I just can't get out of my head).    Reading : Nothing, unless browsing through the Guiness Book Of World Records (1995 edition) while on the toilet counts.    Jamming : We jammed on Saturday and we jammed tonight too. We had a drummer on Saturday, but no drummer tonight. Jimmy, the guy who drummed in JP and Al's previous band, was going to show up tonight but he backed out. He said he'll  be there next Thursday though, so that will be very cool. We ran over a few covers tonight ("American Girl", "The Way", "You May Be Right"), a few of JP's songs ("You Can't Run", "Promise You The Moon", "There For Me", the GAB one), and then we spent awhile working on one of my songs (I had the music, no lyrics) which got worked around a great deal. It's different than the way I had envisioned it. I'm still not sure about the changes made. I will have to put this one together on my own, with lyrics and vocals, if I'm going to get it to sound the way I want it to. They don't hear the same thing I do.    Working : I haven't started looking for a job yet. My sleep schedule is way out of whack, plus I've been really busy this week between going to concerts, jamming, and my computer problems. I need money, so I will have to start looking very, very soon..    Buying : Nothing. I have a little money in my Paypal account, but I'm cautious about spending anything until I know that I can cover my bills. Or, until I see something that I just have to have, which is a frequent occurance.   Eating : I've been eating TV dinners mostly (my Boston Market chicken dinners), eggs and waffles, and Pop Tarts. Single people food. I'm dying for a Stavros Greek Salad. Maybe tomorrow (later today, actually).    Feeling : Out of whack and all mixed up. As I mentioned, my sleep schedule is all screwed up, sleeping all day and staying up all night, but that's my natural sleep pattern, so on one hand it's great, and on the other it's terrible because it must be changed so I can get a day job. I usually don't go anywhere or do anything, but I've had 2 band practices and 2 concerts in a single week, which is unheard of for me. I'm glad not to be working a shitty job anymore, but I'm also not happy about not working nowhere. I need the security of having guaranteed money coming in. My back is feeling better, but I am still extremely congested (have been for awhile now).    Planning : I am planning on getting a new job, that's my number one priority. I also plan on buying an amplifier, job or no job. I need it as soon as possible (if we get Jimmy to drum for us, we may start playing out very soon). I really need to sell some more cards, online and in the newspaper, something, anything.

        CSN   Woo hoo!! I got to see Crosby, Stills, and Nash play live tonight (at Ruth Eckerd Hall) and they were absolutely fantastic! What a great show! The seat I had was awesome too; almost dead center and only 13 rows back from the stage. JP had an extra ticket (his wife decided she didn't want to go, not her type of music) so I took it. I'll have to pay him back for it though. It was $83, but well worth it to me. We arrived late, JP was running behind schedule, and CSN were already onstage playing when we got there. We didn't miss any songs, luckily. I found the set list on  urlLink their website :  Carry On/Questions Wild Tales Marrakesh Express The Lee Shore Deja Vu Military Madness Wasted On the Way Wounded World  Dirty Little Secret Almost Cut My Hair Southern Cross  15 minute break  Helplessly Hoping Cathedral In My Dreams Feed the People Lost Another One Ole Man Trouble Guinnevere Half Your Angels Our House Dark Star Wooden Ships  1st Encore  My Country Tis of Thee Woodstock  2nd Encore  Teach Your Children   They sounded great, all three of them. They looked good and looked like they were having a great time onstage, especially Crosby, who joked around a lot. His voice is still extremely strong, and Nash's harmonies were always right on the money. Stills was hard to understand when he spoke (he sounds like a cross between Marlon Brando and Bob Dylan nowadays), but his singing voice and guitar playing are still great. I was in awe, especially when I paused to think about these guys, about their history. Individually, these three guys have been in some of the best bands of the sixties: The Byrds (Crosby), Buffalo Springfield (Stills), and the Hollies (Nash). They played at Woodstock together (along with their sometime bandmate, Neil Young). Stills was friends with (and jammed with) Jimi Hendrix. He even had Jimi play on his first solo album (as did Eric Clapton). Nash knew Hendrix as well, and was present during the recording sessions for Jimi's "Axis:Bold As Love" album (he even made "footstomping sounds" on one track). Nash was also friends with George Harrison. One of the songs they did tonight, "Lost Another One", was dedicated to "the quiet Beatle". He also played with Joni Mitchell, as did Crosby. Crosby's played with Bob Dylan, the Jefferson Airplane, the Grateful Dead, and many others. Wow. That's a lot of musical history there. Absolutely awesome. And then, if all of that wasn't impressive enough, the guy they had playing keyboards, Mike Finnigan, played organ on Jimi Hendrix's masterpiece, "Electric Ladyland". Holy fucking shit. Awesome just isn't strong enough a word. Great musicians, great show. JP was much cooler to go to a show with than my sister and brother-in-law. We had a good time and even hung out afterward (he wanted to try and get autographs). We saw them all come out and get into their buses (each had their own) but they didn't come over to sign or talk or anything. That stuff didn't matter much to me; I was satisfied with just seeing and hearing these guys play live, in person. Woo hoo!!  By the way, I found a guy who put up pictures from  urlLink the Zebra show I attended last Friday . I don't know how long the photos will be up or how long the link will be good for, so check them out while you can!

        Spread the Word   I really, really hate telemarketers. Now, finally, there is a " urlLink National Do Not Call Registry " where you can add your number to a list of phone numbers telemarketers are not allowed to call. Yay!!! It's free too! Double yay!!! It'll take a few months for it to go into full effect, but it's good for several years (mine is registered until 2008).  If only they could devise something like this for spammers too....

         urlLink Saturday 8     What's the one memory of your childhood that makes you laugh everytime you look back?    I wrote about this a few weeks ago, but it's the one that makes me laugh the most, so here it goes again. It was the time me and my friend, John Paul, covered the side of his mobile home with dog shit. We were out in his yard trying to play soccer, but there were piles of dog shit all over his yard (he had two big dogs) and it kept us from enjoying ourselves. I remember that I got a stick and flung a pile from the yard onto the side of his trailer ... and it stuck! We both laughed our asses off at that. It was so funny to us that we began going around the yard looking for more piles of poo to fling onto the side of his home. Before long, it was dotted by many, many piles of dog shit. His home looked like a chocoloate chip cookie. Needless to say, his parents weren't nearly as amused as we were.  In fact, they were pretty pissed. Befuddled and pissed. I got sent home immediately and JP had to hose off the trailer. I think he got grounded too. Still, a very funny memory to me.     Everyone had a favorite toy, pet, blanket, etc. What was your favorite thing as a kid?    My teddy bear. I got it when I was a baby and I still have it today. It's missing an eye and some fur, but it's still with me.    What was the most idiodic thing you did when you were a kid?    I wrote about this in greater detail a few weeks ago as well. It was the time me and my friend, Mike, moved a newspaper box into the middle of a highway. I had wanted to move it onto the median, to confuse and irritate the newspaper delivery man, but Mike let it drop halfway across the road and took off running. A few minutes later a car hit it. It was a really dumb and thoughtless thing, but it wasn't my intention at all. As far as I know, the driver was not hurt, though his/her car must have had some damage to it.     Who was your best friend as a kid?     John Paul. Also known as JP, John, and Paul. We've been friends for about 28 years. He's like a brother to me.  We're still friends today, but not as close as we once were (we grew apart a bit during High School when he moved away). Besides being my best and oldest friend, he's also my bandmate.    Is there anything that you did when you were a kid that you still do to this day? For example, you might have a bad habit of biting your finger nails.    I'm keeping my bad habits to myself! I have enough going against me as is!   Who did you look up to as a kid?     I don't think I ever had a role model or anyone that I looked up to as a kid.     What was your favorite snack as a kid?     I have no memory of a favorite snack, but I absolutely loved Chef Boyardee Pizza. My Great Grandmother used to make it for me and my sister when she'd babysit us. She was a wonderful woman. I wish she'd lived long enough for me to get to know her. My sister and I have fond memories of her.    What's your fondest memory as a kid?   Probably the summer I went up to Pennsylvania by myself.  It allowed me to get away from the turmoil in my own home back in Florida, but more importantly, it allowed me to get to know my grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. I have a lot of great memories from that time. I also gave the opportunity to appreciate how wonderful a place it was that I had come from. I may have lived in Florida nearly my entire life, but Pennsylvania is my true home.

        Lately I've Been...    Listening to : I had my new Rowan Atkinson ("Live In Belfast") on the other day, but I was busy cleaning my room and really didn't pay much attention to it. One of my speakers is still broken down, so I just haven't been listening to much lately.      Watching on TV : "Everybody Loves Raymond", "The Simpsons", "Seinfeld",  "Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn", "Insomniac with Dave Attell", "The Dave Chapelle Show", and "The Daily Show". That's about it this week, I've been spending more time in front of the computer than in front of the television set.   Downloading : I've been downloading and listening to a lot of unreleased Bill Hicks performances. Killer stuff. I also downloaded a Mitch Hedberg performance and liked that a lot too.    Playing : I've been playing some PC games a lot lately,  urlLink Marbles  and  urlLink Diamond Mine/Bejeweled . They keep me amused.    Reading : I read "Lord Of The Flies" this week. I know I read it when I was younger, or at least, I was supposed to read it. Good book, but  I wish the author would have went into more detail about how they got there, even though it doesn't really have anything to do with the point he was wants to get across.   Jamming : Played tonight with JP (vocals/guitar), Al (bass), Santana (percussion), Ronnie (saxophone/flute/clarinet), and a drummer named Chris, who was really, really good. It was a really good jam. We jammed on several covers: "Feelin' Alright", "Before You Accuse Me", "Wild Night", "American Girl", "Stuck In The Middle", "Sunshine Of Your Love" (with a killer sax solo and an extended jam at the end that I came up with), "Oye Como Va", "Black Magic Woman" (JP played bass and Al played acoustic guitar on those two songs) and "Can't You See". We did some of JP's originals ("Promise You The Moon", a new one JP wrote called "At Night", "Opportunity Knocks", "What She Loves"), Santana's "Subway Joe", my new one ("Goodbye"... the one in Em which JP created the melody for) and an old one of mine called "Stay Or Go" which I only played because Ronnie brought a clarinet tonight. The music for it is cool, old timey, but I hate the lyrics I have for it, which is why I usually don't play it. The drummer started several Zeppelin songs and me and Al jammed on "Rock 'N Roll" a bit. We started off the night just jamming on a blues in E, and we also had a pretty good and lengthy jam in Am. JP started coming up with lyrics for it and added a chord change (G-Am) and I came up with some riffs for it. It sounded great. I wish I had taped it. It was a lot of fun. We were there for four hours, we probably played about three hours altogether and stood around bullshitting and joking around the rest of the time. Very cool night. I am really looking forward to playing more with these guys. I have to get a good amp though, the one they have there just don't cut it. It's either nice and clean or it's super heavy metal distortion, no middle ground. The one I have at home is just too small. I should go over to the Pawn Shop and try to make a deal for their Marshall if it's still there and if it works well and sounds good.    Working : I need to get job hunting. Maybe tomorrow Mom can run me to a couple places.  It's been too rainy and hot this week to go out looking on my own.    Buying : Nothing. No money.      Eating : I've been eating mainly Stouffer's Fish Filet/Macaroni & Cheese TV dinners, Campbell's Chunky Chicken soup, and Rice Krispy Treats. I also had a Boston Market Teriyaki Chicken dinner and Taco Salad this week as well. I've been eating more than I had been, so I have to cut back again. Mom shouldn't have bought the stuff for Rice Krispy Treats.    Feeling : Same as last week: anxious, yet hopeful. I'm feeling better than I have been, physically and emotionally. I'm really excited about the band situation right now and I have a much clearer idea of what I want to do with my own music. But, I'm really anxious about my finances, and my ears still aren't better yet, still popping and clogged (a big concern for me).      Planning : I have to get a  new amp within the next month, so I need to come up with a lot of money fast. I'm planning on going jobhunting and getting a job, and I'm planning on listing cards on eBay this weekend. I also plan on working on my music more than ever before. Things are looking a little brighter all the time.

        Change   If you know me, you'll know that I've been doing a whole lot of soul searching lately, trying to figure out who I am, what I am, and what I should be doing with my life. I keep having these nagging feelings that I should be out there, doing something, anything, to help make the world a better place. Now, I'm not so egotistical that I  think I can go out and change the world all by myself, in fact, I've had serious doubts about whether or not it was even worth the effort. I mean, how can a song change anything, really?   This brings me to Graham Nash. I saw Crosby, Stills, and Nash in concert earlier this year, and since then, I've visited   urlLink Graham Nash's website  several times. I noticed that he has a message board on his site, where he can, and does, communicate with his fans. He's someone who has put politics and social issues into his music for many years, someone who's fought for many good causes, and I thought he might be able to answer a question I had... so I left him a message on his message board. To my amazement, and to his credit, he answered me. Here it is:   Hello Graham, I'm a musician and I am having an internal struggle of sorts. I have the feeling I should be doing something, saying something about the world, about America, about politics and other issues of the day, rather than just singing songs about love (finding it, losing it, being in it).The problem I have and the question I'd like to ask you is: do you think singing songs about these things can actually change anything?  Gary   GN: Any time you put your heart on the line things will change. You, the world around you. Take courage and get working. Silence is agreement....  Best,  Graham    Beautiful. With such few words, he managed to say a lot. "Silence is agreement." Wow. You know, it's funny he said that, because lately, I've been listening to a lot of  urlLink Bill Hicks'  material (man, we could really use a voice like his now), and his message was similar, that we've become sheep in this country, silently accepting whatever is thrown our way. Many of us don't like the way things are going with our country but by being silent about it, we are essentially agreeing to every bit of it. In fact, we are encouraging more of the same. I don't want to be a sheep anymore, I want things to change... so I am changing. I just have to figure out what my strengths are. Music? Writing? Humor? It's going to take some more work and soul searching to figure it all out, but I am going to do it, I am going to find a way to speak out, and I am going to try and make a difference. I am a man on a mission.  Thank you, Graham Nash.

         urlLink Monday Mission     1.What is the difference between  spirituality  and  religion ?   Spirituality is believing in something you can't see, but keeping it within yourself. Religion is believing in something you can't see and trying to make others believe that they can see it too. I dislike religion in a big way.   2. What is the difference between someone  listening to what you say  and  hearing what you say ?   There should be no difference, but I know that sometimes I'll listen to someone speak and realize later (sometimes seconds, sometimes hours) that I didn't hear a word they said. Their words didn't enter my brain, just bounced off my head. It usually happens because the person speaking to me has ignored the fact that I was busy with something else at the time and decided to talk to me anyway just because they felt like talking. When people talk, it should be a mutual thing.      3. What's the difference between a  Father , and a  Daddy ?   There's probably a good Catholic priest joke in there somewhere! As Father Flannigan said to the alter boy, "just call me Daddy". Too bad I couldn't find it. Anyhow, to answer the question, to me, there is an implied difference between the two. "Father" sounds strict, like a disciplinarian, distant, cold, whereas "Daddy" sounds soft, caring, and affectionate. I think being a "Daddy" sounds more enjoyable, but you have to have some "Father" in there to keep the kids on the right road.    4. What's the difference between  being married  and  living together ?   Committment. Marriage is a lifetime committment, while living together is always having an open escape route. I'm not sure how I feel about living together before marriage. I guess if you're unsure of how much you really love the other person or of how much tolerance you have, then it might be for you. If it can prevent a possible divorce down the raoad, then it has some benefit to it. .      5. What's the difference between  growing up  and  growing old ?   Well you have to "grow older" to "grow up", but "growing older" and "growing old" aren't necessarily the same. Growing "old" means nearing the end, whether it's a boring activity or someone's life.   6. What's the difference between getting  what you want  and getting  what you need ?   For something to be considered a "need", it must make a difference in their life, in their wellbeing. A "want" is everything else.    7. What's the difference between  punishment  and  discipline ?   "Punishment" is the penalty a person receives for doing something wrong. "Discipline" in training that person not to do anything that would merit punishment.    BONUS: Can you hear me calling you?    Sorry, I had the stereo up too loud. You just can't listen to AC/DC quietly.   Today's Comment Question: Do you eat breakfast, or just skip it and wait for lunch?   I usually skip it. By the time I get up, it's lunchtime anyway.

        Dead Tired   I went to bed late last night, but then I got up again; just couldn't sleep. I guess the pot of coffee I drank last night didn't help any. I've been awake about 30 hours now. I went ahead and stayed up all day to help me get back to keeping daytime hours (I need to go job hunting next week). I played guitar for awhile in bed and then I got up and wrote lyrics for that new song in Em that I came up with the other day (the one JP added a melody line to). I added a few new parts to it as well and it sounds really nice. My lyrics though... I always second guess them. They're never good enough. Plus, I wrote them on the toilet, and that seems to take away from them as well. The rest of the day, I've spent in front of the computer, not really doing much of anything, just trying to stay awake. I did watch an old John Wayne movie this morning, "True Grit", but I got distracted and missed the last 10 minutes. I don't really care though. Today has pretty much sucked for me. Yesterday was kind of cool though.   Yesterday, Mom and I went out to run errands and we wound up hitting a bunch of record stores as well. Other than the three doctor's visits and a trip or two to Walgreens, this was the first time I've really gotten to go anywhere in about 7 weeks. I wanted to hit Specs really bad. I saw a CD in their clearance bin there the last two times I went there, a John Frusciante CD (from the Red Hot Chili Peppers), that sells on eBay for $30-$45. They had it for $7.99. I wish I hadn't of passed on it before, twice no less, because it wasn't there anymore. Since I had been there last, they had lowered the prices on the clearance CDs from $7.99 to $1.88. Someone got very, very lucky.  I wound up spending $10 there. I bought 4 CD's: Randy Jackson's China Rain (Randy is Zebra's lead singer/guitarist), Brian Auger's Oblivion Express, Masters Of Reality "Live At The Viper Room", and Sacred Sources: Live Forever, a compilation of unreleased tracks from the last tours of Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Bob marley, Marvin Gaye, and John Coltrane, compiled by Carlos Santana. I already had a copy of that one, but I know I could sell it fairly easily. After I got home, I looked at mine and saw some lights marks on the CD, so I wound up opening the new one and swapping the discs (I'm really picky about my CDs). I'm going to put it on eBay, unless I sell it to my friend Rob first. I listened to the Randy Jackson CD first, but I was really disappointed in the condition of the booklet. I saw that the case had been cracked, but I didn't notice that the booklet had been indented and bent because of it. I'll have to get a new one now, or maybe not; I wasn't too fond of the CD, too hair-band. There were a few good songs, but overall, it was weak. His Zebra work is way better.  I listened to the Brian Auger CD next and liked some of it. When it sticks to jazz fusion, it's pretty interesting, but when the singing starts, it just sounds dated. I'll probably sell it. I haven't listened to tha Masters Of Reality CD yet, that one should be pretty good. I also picked up two cassette tapes at Specs (Dio's Inferno - "Last In Live" and "The Best Of Cat Stevens") for only $0.88 each. Unfortunately, I just found out that the Dio cassette is a 2-cassette set, and they had another one there too, I'll bet it's the second half...dammit! I may not be able to get ther for a few days, and at $0.88, it probably won't be there when I return. We went to a few other stores in St.Pete but I didn't buy anything else. I should've bought the "Bagger Vance" soundtrack they had at one store though; it sells on eBay for more than twice what they had it for.    After all the running around, we were hungry and so we went to Sonny's and chowed down on all-you-can-eat sliced pork. Mmmmmm....sliced pork. After that we came home and vegged out on TV the rest of the night. We watched Trading Spaces, boxing (Lennox Lewis fought Vitali Klitschko, who received a really nasty cut over his eye), and then we watched some bull riding. I shit you not... bull riding.   And then I drank a pot of coffeee and here I am.   The end.

        I Found Something To Say   In my mind, for awhile now, I've had an idea for a different way of life, a life in which no one person can ever possess more money than he will ever need or spend, while others go homeless. Should CEO's be paying themselves million dollar bonuses while their companies are failing? Of course not. Should anyone be out of work while others work mandatory overtime? If workers earned more or if the cost of living were less, why couldn't those hours be shared? If workers controlled the means of production, and if wealth was distributed fairly and equally, no one would be homeless or jobless, no one would be left behind and forgotten. I have had ideas about giving the government back to the people, of cutting the fat cats and their corporate masters out of the equation, and I think I've found the answer. The funny thing, it's been here all along. The answer? Socialism.  urlLink Albert Einstein supported it , so I know it can't be too far from the right answer.  I found a site that shares my views on the government and religion, and offers more insight into Socialism than I can.  urlLink Click here  for some info. Capitalism works really well for the ones with money, the rest of us work for those people. That's why the rich continue to get richer, and the poor continue to get poorer. Socialism is human oriented, it's looking out for one another rather than trying to screw each other trying to get to the top. There is a lot of discontentment in America today; we know we're not going in the right direction, and a lot of us want change. Here it is. More people need to educated about it, they need to learn that  urlLink Socialism is not Communism , that Socialism is not anti-American, and that Democracy and Socialism can co-exist in a Socialist Democracy. Do yourself a favor and at least look into it.

        Something To Say   I get the feeling I should be doing something, something important, but I have no idea what. I've thought about writing a book, doing stand-up comedy, writing songs, etcetera...but I have a big problem: I have nothing to say. That's not entirely true, what I really mean is that everything I have to say has been said before, and by people who could say it better than I ever could: Bob Marley, Jimi Hendrix, John Lennon, Bill Hicks, George Carlin, and many others. But even then, having things to say and saying them doesn't mean much unless something changes because of it. Unfortunately, nothing ever seems to get accomplished by mere words alone. Action, that's where it's at, but who wants to stick their necks out and be a martyr, especially if no change would actually come of it? Our country is in an awful state, the world is in an awful state, and everyone seems to know it already. Would one more voice change anything? Would one more martyr mean a thing? It's like those monks who burned themselves to death during the Vietnam War; they didn't change a damn thing, and in the long run, they died for nothing. Footnotes to the Vietnam War, that's all they became. Still, I feel like I should be doing something, and I've had that feeling for a long time now. I wonder if a lot of people feel the way I do. I think it would be great if we could get together and take our country back from the millionaires, billionaires, and corporations and give it back to the people, make the government work  for us  again. But where do you start? It seems the only way for there to be a change is through revolution, revolution of the mind, and revolution in the flesh. But how does that begin? Could it start with one voice? One martyr? I suppose these are dangerous thoughts, but these are dangerous times, are they not? I, for one, am tired of working my ass off and barely getting anywhere, busting my ass to make the rich folks richer. I'm tired of being a sheep. I'm tired of not saying things that I feel need to be said.

        Lately I've Been...    Listening to :  I had AC/DC's "Back In Black" on the other day. Mostly been listening to stuff on the PC.   Watching on TV : More than usual this week: "The Simpsons", "Everybody Loves Raymond", "Seinfeld",  "Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn", "The Daily Show", "The Howard Stern Show", "Dave Chappelle's Show", "Insomniac with Dave Attell", "Cambodia's Killing Fields" (a documentary about Cambodia), "South Park", "Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones" (watched it a few times this week, all the way through and in parts), and old episodes of "Match Game" and "Saturday Night Live".    Downloading : I downloaded a bunch of stuff from John Frusciante, the Red Hit Chili Pepper guitarist, probably about 50 songs. Some pretty interesting music there, I plan on picking some of his stuff up, though it will be tough since most of his CDs are out of print and expensive. I also downloaded some Bloomfield, Kooper, and Stills "Super Session" cuts, and a few tracks from Tricky"s "Maxinquaye" CD. I had heard he was really great and I wanted to give him a listen. Some was really nice and smooth, but some of it I wouldn't want to listen to again. I loved his "Wonder Woman" track off a later album though, which he did with Flea and Frusciante.    Reading :  I haven't started anything new yet, but I think I'm going to read "Lord Of The Flies" next, then probably Stephen King's "It", which I've been wanting to read for awhile.    Jamming : No jam this week, and not because of me this time. However, JP came by for a few hours during the day today and we did a bunch of talking and playing. I played him most of my new stuff, and we wound up jamming on a new one I started last night, in Em (Em-C, arpeggiated). I added another part to it (D) and he came up with a really sweet melody on keyboard. We were both liking it a lot. He also played the melody on guitar and harmonica and it sounded nice anyway he played it. We may do it as an instrumental. It's really mellow and soothing. He's planning on going into the studio (to make a demo of his material) and he gave me a CD of his songs to listen to and a list of 19 songs he'd like me to narrow down to 11. I'm supposed to help him in the studio with guitar parts, but he wants to get a lot of people in there to work on it too, including other guitar players. Kind of a weird situation.    Working : I hope to go looking for a job next week.    Buying :  I bought a CD on eBay, Rowan Atkinson's "Live In Belfast" CD, which is really hard-to-find (I don't think it was ever released in the US). I spent $25 on it. It's still sealed, and the last one on eBay that was sealed sold for somewhere around $30-$40. I wound up selling one of my guitar pedals to pay for it (and am using the leftover money to pay my Gateway bill).   Eating : I've been eating a lot of Stouffer's (fish filet/macaroni & cheese, barbecue chicken/potato bake) and Boston Marken (Teriyaki Chicken) TV dinners. I've also been eating tapioca and rice pudding. I didn't ask for pudding, Mom just bought it, and if it's the house, I will eat it. Same with nachos. She bought the makings for taco salad but never made it, so I've been eating nachos, which I shouldn't be. On a posistive note, I am eating less, I used to eat about twice what I'm eating now, but I'm just not eating healthy. Most of the food I eat is high in sodium and fat, plus I'm drinking soda way too much still.   Feeling :  Anxious, yet hopeful. Physically, my ears are getting better, but they're still not back to 100%. They are still popping and feel full. Plus my stupid palate is bothering me since I cut it open yesterday.    Planning : There is too much I want to do, and need to do, to list.

        I Suck   Who else but me could cut their palate on a piece of pita bread? I was sitting here enjoying the second half of my Stavros Greek Salad and I cut the top of my mouth on the corner of a piece of pita that I was shoveling into my mouth. My stupid ass. It was bleeding for a while, just stings now. I hope it'll heal fast.

        My Cats Suck   I woke up around 1:30pm and came out to the dining room and was quite unpleasantly surprised. I had three stacks of basketball cards sitting on the table that I was planning on scanning and putting on eBay, and apparently, the cats had been on the table this morning (where they know they're not allowed to be) and knocked them all over the fucking place. Some had claw or tooth marks in them, completely ruining them. I was absolutely furious! I put the smackdown on both of the cats and made them stay out of the front of the house for two hours. They're lucky I didn't beat the shit out of them, I was so mad.   I watched TV and mellowed out some, though they still got on my nerves a few times tonight. They're just so stupid. They don't learn. I've had about 30 cats in my life (it may be hard to tell from this post, but I really do like cats) and these two may be the dumbest I've ever had. I chase them out of the dining room today and one of them runs into the only room in the whole house where they're not allowed to be, the hobby room. Everytime I've ever caught them in that room, I've chased them out of it yelling at them loudly and usually smacking them on their way out. Yet, that's where this idiot chose to run. So... I had to chase his ass out of there, kicking him on the way out, and pissing me off even more in the process. The same one later tried to sneak past me when I opened my Mom's door tonight to talk to her and that drives me nuts. Everytime they do it, they get yelled at, yet they continue to do it all the time. Another thing one of them did tonight, which they both do a lot, is get underfoot. They sleep in the hallway right where it meets both the kitchen and living room, and when me or my Mom try to walk down it, especially when it's dark, they don't move out of the way, often causing us to trip on them. I've watched them do this, they see us coming, but they don't budge until we've rammed into them. They also try to cut us off when we walk past their food bowls when they're hungry (trying to lead us to their bowl), causing us to either trip or ram into them. They're just so fucking stupid. Or stubborn. Or maybe both.   It's hard to tell which they are, but here's a prime example of what I'm talking about: they sleep on our dining room chairs a lot, and one day my mom knocked one of them off the chair so she could sit down and eat. Immediately, before my mom could sit down, the cat jumped back up on the chair. She knocked him off again, and he immediately jumped back up on it again. This happened  five or six times , no exaggeration, before she finally had to kick his ass away. So, I ask, is he stubborn, or is he really, really stupid?   Either way, these two suck.   Sometimes, anyway.

         urlLink This-or-That Tuesday     1. Newspapers or magazines?   I tend not to read either. When I want some news, I put on CNN, and when I want any other info, I go to the internet.   2. Books-on-tape or regular books?   I've had a book-on-tape, some Tom Clancy novel, for about 5 or 6 years and I still haven't put it on. Maybe if I had a car, I might listen to it in there, a little every day, but it's just too long to hold my attention.     3. Paperback or hardcover?   I like paperbacks because more because I can buy used ones really cheap and because I don't care as much about damaging them, casuing wear and tear, because they're usually easy enough to replaceable. Hardbacks are fine too, but I'm always worried about messing them up, damaging their spines.    4. Fiction or non-fiction?   I have no preference really, a good book is a good book.    5. Sci-Fi/Fantasy or romance novels?   Sci-Fi allows you to use your imagination, taking you to different worlds, exploring technology. But romance novels? They're nothing but soap operas in a book, junk food for the brain.     6. Borrow from library or buy books (either new or used)?   I like to buy my books, mainly because I never know when I'm going to feel like reading.    7. Subscribe to magazines or buy on newsstand?   I used to subscribe to a lot of magazines, but I don't have any subscriptions right now. Money is tight, plus, the internet gets me most of the info I would want from my magazines anyway, and without any trees having to get chopped down for paper, which is a definite bonus.    8. Current best-sellers or classic literature?   Classic literature. I never read much when I was younger, so I have a lot of classic literature to catch up on.   9. Read books once, or re-read favorites every so often?   I generally only read them once, since there are so many unread ones still sitting on my bookshelf.   10. Here in the U.S., we have two hot best-sellers...former First Lady Hillary Clinton's memoirs, and the new Harry Potter book (coming out June 21). If you had to read one, which one...Hillary or Harry? Why?   I'd choose Harry. Hillary is still in office, so I seriously doubt she'd come absolutely clean on everything. It'd just be her spin on things at the moment, and reading that seems pointless to me.

         urlLink Monday Mission      1. The most hateful comments I've ever had are from the post I made taking a stand against Cock Fighting. How do you respond to hateful mail and comments?    You anti-cock fighting bastard!!! My cock is out of work now because of you and your anti-cock fighting cronies!!! He's very, very angry about it too! You'd just better watch your back mister, because one of these days, when you least expect it, my cock is going to come down hard on you!!! My cock will go medieval on your ass!!! Beware...  Actually, I've never gotten any hate mail so I haven't had to do anything. If I did, I suppose I'd either 1) respond to the writer, politely explaining my views, or 2) delete their email and block them.     2. I often think twice about taking a stand on things, because I get this nagging fear I will loose some of my readers or become a target of those who disagree. But I usually ignore it and post on it anyway. What sort of topics have you taken a stand on in your writings? Did it get the reaction you expected? What subjects have you avoided? Why?   My regular readership amounts to 1 person. I think I can can pretty much say what I want to say without fear of losing her, but even if there was a chance of that, my blog is mostly for me; it's my thoughts and opinions on things, my life, and my feelings. I'm putting myself out there in blog form and if you don't like my blog, you probably won't like me anyway. Conforming, just to suit people who probably wouldn't like me anway, makes little sense to me.   3. I read a post over at SnarkyBitch.com where the author describes "The Top 10 Reasons I Won't Read Your Blog." While I try not to commit these sins, there are things I do that cause folks to drop me from their Blogrolls. What would you add to the list of "Reasons You Won't Read a Blog?" What are some of the reasons that you stopped reading someone's Blog? Do you tell them you've stopped reading? Wouldn't you like to know why someone quit reading yours? Or do you care?   I don't like reading blogs which go into politics or religion too much. Both subjects are fairly distasteful to me, especially the latter. Also, when I'm blog surfing, I immeditely quit reading any blogs where the person speaks like this: "Yo peeps! Ur nt gnna gess whut happnd 2 me 2day!" I fucking HATE that shit. It makes me especially sad when I see college students doing it. I also won't read blogs from girls writing about 1) how absolutely wonderful her boyfriend/husband is, how cute he is, and how much she loves him, or 2) what a total asshole her boyfriend/husband, or ex-boyfriend/ex-husband, is, or 3) how so-and-so stabbed her in the back when she told some other so-and-so what she said about yet another so-and-so... schoolgirl shit. I also don't enjoy the ones where people describe all of their personal ailments, so I probably wouldn't read mine much either. If there's some cool linkage, or if the person writes well and has a great sense of humor, I will usually stick around and check those out   4. Do you like to tweak and tinker with your website and blog? Or would you rather have a simple solution so you can concentrate on other things?    I enjoy the writing more than the tweaking and tinkering. I just don't have enough knowledge about HTML to get into the nuts and bolts of the webpage/blog. If there was a simple solution, I'd like that way better, not so I could concentrate on other things, but so I'd finally be satisfied with my webpage/blog.    5. Would you take a ride into outer space if given the chance?   Absolutely! Words probably couldn't describe how truly awesome that would be.   6. Are there any songs, that when you hear them, make you just want to get up and start dancing ?  I don't dance. Fred "Rerun" Berry ruined dancing for fat guys.    7. Speaking of music, I read a humor article recently where the author said he can't stand it when people give him "Mix CDs." (In case you don't know, Mix CDs are audio CD compilations that folks make of music on their PCs and give to you for your listening pleasure) He said it reminded him too much of teenagers who made love song "mix tapes" in High School. Have you ever made a "Mix" CD or tape for someone special? What was on it? Did they like it? Are you sure? Has someone made a"mix" just for you? Did you like it? Which one comes to mind? What made it so memorable? What songs were on it?   Yeah, I did that for a girl I liked once. She said she enjoyed it, but I don't know whether she did or not since she never mentioned it, or any of the bands on the tape, again. It was mainly music I liked a lot that she hadn't heard before, stuff I thought she might like considering the stuff I know she liked already. Bands like Wilco and Matthew Sweet. Not sure what all else I put on there. I didn't give it to her just because I fancied her, I've made mix tapes for other people too. I like sharing good music and turning people on to new stuff. No one's ever made a mix tape for me.     BONUS: Where does my hope come from?   Wal-Mart?  *********************************************************  I've been overdoing it on the "memes" lately, but this one looked fun, so here here's another (I don't know who originally published this):   5 details about your appearance right now:   1) nearly naked (sorry, I know I lost everyone right there) 2) wet 3) hairy 4) clean 5) toweled (I just got out of the shower)   5 things that everyone should know about you:    1) That I rule...hard.  2) That I live and breath music.  3) That I find bathroom humor hilarious.  4) That I'm a good person. 5) That I abhorr religion.    5 things that make me happy:   1) Happy Pills.  2) Smiling faces. 3) A really good breeze. 4) Good food. 5) Rain.     5 things that disgust you   1) Shit.

        Lost In A Dream World   Weird night last night. I went to bed around 6pm, dead freaking tired, but I wound up playing guitar and writing lyrics instead of sleeping. I got up again around 8:30pm turned on the PC and TV and zoned out for a few minutes before deciding I just had to go to bed again. I got up to take three Tylenol PM's just as my Mom got back home. When I woke up today, I thought I had dreampt all of that, and about letting her in the front door and helping her carry groceries in. As soon as she was in, I took the pills and went to bed right afterward. I slept pretty good, getting up only once to pee around 6:30am. I dreampt a lot, strange dreams too (including some swinging neighbors that I don't have, a wandering boy named Toby, and a crowded hallway and bathroom that was supposed to be mine). I heard a song in my dreams, something called "Golden Ships" or something like that ("Golden Skies"?), and I dreampt that I learned how to play the song (E and A were the chords, the A having a descending major line). Unfortunately, after I woke up, my mind turned to trying to remember whether or not I let my Mom in the night before or if I'd dreampt that; I never got the chance to bring the song into the real world before I forgot how it went. Shit. Good thing I recorded the songs I came up with last night, writing down lyrics and everything, or else I may have forgotten them too. One is called "(I Love A) Rainstorm", another called "My Eyes Betray Me", and a third that I don't have lyrics for. That one is a blues, a real Delta Blues sounding song with some cool guitar parts. Anyhow, the sleep did me some good, but my ears and sinuses are no better. I have enough antibiotics to last through Monday, my throat is better again, so that's enough, but the Zyrtec, even though I have enough of it, isn't doing much, if anything, for my sinuses and ears. I took an early dose of Zyrtec today. I'm supposed to take it at bedtime, but my sinuses and ears were really bad this morning and all afternoon, so I took one early. I'll take another before bedtime tonight, maybe it'll help. If not, I may switch back to Allegra on Monday.         urlLink Saturday Scruples     1. You own a restaurant and serve fresh rolls with every meal. Often they're returned to the kitchen seemingly untouched. Do you serve them again?    No way. For starters, the cost of the rolls should be figured into what the people paid for their meals, so there's no reason to be so cheap. Secondly, it wouldn't be worth the damage to business that would occur if word got out that I was recycling food in my restaurant.    2. In a close fight for re-election, you learn that your rival recently had a nervous breakdown. Do you leak this to the media?   Sure. If he's unstable, he probably shouldn't have an elected position until he was well again anyway.    3. You have a clear view of an attractive neighbor who does yoga in the nude. Do you ask this person to draw the curtains?   Hell no. Let me re-emphasize that: HELL NO. And if you go and say something, I will kick your ass :)

        Sleepless In (Someplace Other Than) Seattle   After spending the entire weekend doing almost nothing but sleeping, I've spent the last two days nearly sleepless. In fact, I went in to the doctor's yesterday without having slept at all that night. I stayed up until sometime around noon and stayed in bed until around 7pm, but I hardly slept while in bed. Instead, I played guitar, tossed and turned, blew my nose, and coughed a lot, but mostly, I just laid there and thought about stupid shit. I get all involved in trying to think of stuff to dream about and soon I begin focusing on all the details of the dream and before I know it, several hours have passed. I'm pretty sure I slept less than 2 hours during that time, and not in one block either, but choppy sleep here and there. Last night I went to bed at 2am and at 7:30am this morning, I'm up out of bed again, not having slept at all. Will I ever get back to normal again? Even semi-normal would be nice.    I missed it on Monday, and since I'm bored shitless and desperately need something to do, and since the 3 For Thursday this week is too personal for my liking, here is the Thursday edition of my   urlLink Monday Mission   ...enjoy!   1. In my work Outlook inbox, I have 343 unread email messages. Most of them are newsletters I've subscribed to but not had time to read. It is a bit intimidating at this point, and I am tempted to delete them all and start fresh. But I am that way in many things, relationships, art projects, and more. Have you even just totally trashed something you were working on because it wasn't going the way you wanted? What happened? Did you start over again? Was it better?   Sure have! I "trashed" my entire backload of songs that I'd written, probably a hundred songs altogether. I didn't feel any of them were good enough, they didn't reach that higher level that I hope to attain someday. What happened? I started writing new material, more in the direction that I wanted to be going in. The music is much better, I feel it more, but I still have a terrible time with lyrics because I can't sing to save my life.    2. My friend was contacted out of the blue by someone from High School at his work e-mail. He wondered how someone found him and I told him to try putting his own name in Google.com to see what happens. Have you ever contacted an old friend out of the blue over the internet? How did it go? Have any old friends or lovers ever contacted you? Did it flatter you or freak you out?   I've looked up a few women that I've known. I never found much, just a few phone numbers, but contacting any of them out of the blue with numbers that they did not give me personally, would be really creepy, stalker behavior. I'm a loser, not a stalker.   3. I am the forgetful type. I need lists. I need notes. Oddly, I've found if I write something down to remember it, the mere act of writing makes me remember it and I seldom ever refer back to the paper again. What is the most important thing that you have ever forgotten? Did it have any negative results? How did it all turn out?   I probably have a really interesting anecdote about forgetfulness, but alas, I have forgotten it.    4. In America, we are currently suffering through an overdose of "reality" programs on television. Survivor, Fear Factor, The Amazing Race, Big Brother, The Bachelor and so on. Which of the "reality" television programs do you think you would have a chance at winning? Why? Would you ever actually consider signing up for one? Have you?   I watch "Fear Factor" from time to time, but that's the only "reality" show I watch, though I'd certainly not want to be a contestant on that show; there's no way I'm eating the kind of nasty shit that they eat on that show. I could care less about any of the other reality shows. I don't watch them and I wouldn't want to be on them. Although, if I had to choose one, "Survivor" might be the most interesting choice. I like the idea of testing myself and surviving in the wilderness, but I wouldn't enjoy the hokey "voting off" stuff. The backstabbing and lying would be no fun at all.    5. Do you allow commenting on your blog? Why?  Have you ever considered removing/adding that function? What was one of the worst situations you've found yourself in due to blog comments?    I have a Zonk Board for people to comment with if they choose, but so far, it's only been me and one friend who use it. The worst situation? Uhh ..typos, I guess.    6. Have you found any cool shareware/freeware applications/scripts/tools recently? Yeah? Tell me more!   I couldn't live without Webroot's Window Washer program. It cleans up the old hard drive very nicely. Fast and easy. There is a free trial version downloadable on the net, but the full program is well worth the money.    7. I've mentioned it here before, but one of my favorite terms I've heard a Minster use was when he refereed to a "pet sin." Which is when you live your life right for the most part, but you have this one secret thing, this one bad thing that you do that is wrong for you to do, that you won't give up, even though you know you should (and sometime criticize others for doing). Now I am not asking to know what it is, but do you have a "pet sin?" When did it start? Are you trying to give it up, or are you just reconciled to the fact that you will always have it? Would anyone think less of you if they knew about it?   I don't care about religion and I don't believe in God, so I don't buy into the notion of "sin". Is there something I do that I probably shouldn't do? Well, I suppose I have some homophobe tendencies. It's weird, being fairly liberal and all, I support a lot gay issues, but I also catch myself speaking of gays in a derogatory fashion around family and friends who do the same. I guess it's an environmental thing, though that's not much of an excuse.   BONUS: Am I loud enough?   I'm sorry, did you say something?      Lately I've Been...    Listening to : Nothing at all. Since my one of the speakers blew on my stereo, I haven't felt like listening to music in my room.    Watching on TV : "Seinfeld", "The Croc Hunter" (live specials all this week), NBA Finals (during Croc Hunter commercials... go Spurs!), "The Howard Stern Show", "Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn", "Dave Chappelle's Show", and a few movies. I watched a bad Vincent Price/Charles Bronson movie called "Master Of The World"...real cheesy stuff. It's based on a Jules Verne novel, and in the right hands, I think it could have been a much better movie. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I also watched "Rolling Thunder", which wasn't very good either. It was a dumb, "Death Wish" type of movie. Besides the thin plot, Tommy Lee Jones was underused and William Devane was absolutely wrong for the role. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I also watched "Psyche-Out", a Jack Nicholson movie from 1968 that was just horrid. I couldn't tell if they were celebrating the hippie movement or exposing it as fraudulent and unrealistic and I don't think the moviemakers knew either. Very bad movie, not recommended to anyone. Jack Nicholson was wasted, and his "guitar playing" (he was supposed to be a musician in the movie) ...it was the worst attempt of someone trying to look like they're playing guitar that I've ever seen. The only thing "good" about it was that it gives a look into the hippie lifestyle from the actual time period. Dean Stockwell was decent too, I guess.    Downloading :  I downloaded some Norah Jones stuff for my Mom to hear (she said she liked it). I played some of it for her before, but she forgot. Norah played a "free" concert in my town last night (you had to pay for reserved seating, but general admission was free) and I didn't get to go...dammit. I would have loved to have gone to see her.    Reading :  I finished "Les Miserables" over the weekend and haven't started anything since. I was a little disapointed with "Les Miserables", but that may be due to the book being an abridged version. Hugo's writing was wonderful, especially the way he narrated the story, but there seemed to something missing, like the absence of any relationship beween Jean Valjean and Fantine. It goes from her paying the Thenardiers to watch her child, to Valjean at her deathbed with her expecting him to have brought her child back to her. I saw the movie version, the one with Liam Neeseon, Geoffrey Rush and Uma Thurman, and it bridged the two scenes with a relationship developing between Fantine and Valjean and it also showed more of Fantine's hardships. I wonder whether that stuff was cut out of the abridged version or whether it was added in by the film's screenwriter's. Victor Hugo's original novel is well worth reading, but until I read the unabridged version, I'd say I prefer the film over it.    Jamming : I had to cancel out of practice this week. My ears are still bad and I only have 6 days of antibiotics so I don't want to risk aggravating my ears even more. I'm not happy about this at all. I really enjoyed playing with Santana and Ronnie so much last week, I was looking forward to playing with them again.    Working : I wish.    Buying : I spent my last $6 on a Rare Roast Beef sandwich (with Boursin cheese) at the Red Onion Deli yesterday. I'd been wanting to try one for a couple months. It was pretty good, and even though the Boursin cheese tasted strange to me (I'd never had it before), I would probably order one again.    Eating : Besides my above mentioned meal, I've been chowing down all week. Mom went nuts at the grocery store and bought a bunch of killer food/junk food. Stouffer's Fish with Macaroni & Cheese dinners, Boston Market Teriyaki Chicken dinners (this stuff is awesome), tapioca and rice puddings, oatmeal cookies, popcorn, soda out the ying yang (root beers, cream soda, Pepsi, 7-Up), tomato juice, chocolate milk, nachos (she bought nacho chips and shredded cheddar cheese to make taco salad with, but I've used it to make nachos...I'm a cheese freak), plus she bought some Jose-Ole mini-tacos that kicked ass. I may be sick, but my appetite is well.   Feeling : Frustrated beyond belief. I am so over being sick ...it's pissing me off very much.    Planning : The same things I've been planning for the last five or six fucking weeks.

        Another $55 Gone   I just got back from the doctor's, $55 shorter, but with another batch of freebie medicines (what really helps me out a lot). For the congestion and sinus stuff I got some Zyrtec; for the ears and throat I got some Levaquin; and I also got a powder inhaler to help with the congestion. I hope this stuff finally knocks whatever it is I have out of my system. It's been over five weeks of dealing with this crap; hopefully, this next week will be the last. Physically, it's been a real pain in the ass, but financially, having no job and no income, it's been a real killer: three doctor's visits ($165) and 2 prescriptions for cough syrups ($35). That's $200 I didn't have to spend. I hope this was the last doctor's visit I'll have to make for a long, long time.       urlLink Wednesday What-Ifs?     1. What if you had to choose whether to die in one week, or, starting tomorrow, live your life backwards until you cease to exist (meaning, you wake up tomorrow and it was two days ago, and the next day it was three days before that, and so forth, through your entire life, until before you were born)?   That's a strange one. Would life make still make sense to me going in reverse? I mean, if actions have reactions and then you reverse it, wouldn't you continually be dealing with the outcomes of things that haven't happened yet. Everyday might seem like a new crisis and you'd probably feel like you had no absolutely control of your life whatsoever. I don't see any point in going backwards, it goes against everything we are as human beings. I'd constantly lose everything I've ever learned and I'd never be able to change anything because what's happened already will happen tomorrow. I hate to say it, but I think I'd choose death over life in this case because life in this instance would likely be a life of utter madness and confusion.    2. What if you had to choose whether to die tomorrow, or live out the rest of your life as a tree?   I'd gladly live out my life as a tree, swaying in the breeze on some mountainside, preferably. It'd be a new experience, that's for sure.    3. What if you had to choose whether to, starting next week, live out the rest of your life alone in Antartica (with enough supplies to last but zero hope of rescue or escape) and be allowed one day of "going home" per year, or agree to go with the friendly aliens that landed in your backyard to explore other worlds for the rest of your life without ever once returning for even a visit?   I'd choose the alien scenario over the Antarctica scenario for sure. In fact, I'd choose that over almost any scenario you could offer. I think it would be truly awesome to travel through space and explore the unknown. It'd be an honor to be chosen.   4. What if you had to choose whether to be imprisoned five days per week for the rest of your life, or contract sudden, incurable amnesia, and never remember who you really were or see anyone you loved again?   This one needs a qualifier: would prison sex be part of the prison deal? If so, I'd opt for the amnesia. If I had to have my ass continually pounded by prison thugs, I'd pray for amnesia anyway. If it was solitary confinement, then I'd take the prison option.    5. What if, upon your death, you had to choose whether to unsuccessfully roll that big boulder up that hill in Hell for eternity, or simply cease to exist?    I'm a lazy bastard, so I'd choose non-existance over hard manual labor most of the time anyway.

        More Wasted Days   Since Saturday night, all I've done is sleep. Sure, I've been up here and there to eat, and a few times I sat on the couch and watched TV, but almost the entire time, I've been in bed. Whatever it is I had, it seems to be coming back again. My throat is sore again, I'm congested and coughing, and my ears are aching again. I've been taking Allegra for the past few days but it hasn't helped at all. It looks like another doctor's visit is in my immediate future. I'm really bummed out. I was hoping to be well by now. Being down with this crap, it's hard to take care of business, and I have a lot of business that needs taking care of. Besides that, I can't really afford another $55 visit right now. It's been a month now, why can't I get over this shit? It's really pissing me off.      urlLink This-Or-That Tuesday     1. "The Munsters" or "The Addams Family"?   I'd rather not watch either, but if I had to choose one, I'd choose "The Addams Family".   2. "The Sopranos" or the "Godfather" movies?   The first two "Godfather" movies are absolute masterpieces, and the third one is pretty decent. "The Sopranos" are hit and miss, some brilliance, some bullshit. I'd have to choose the "Godfather". The best "Sopranos" episode isn't as good as either of the first two "Godfather" films.    3. "The Jetsons" or "Lost in Space"?   Ugh. I've avoided both all my life. If I had to choose one though, I'd take "The Jetsons" because I cannot stand that faggy little doctor in "Lost In Space".   4. "Superman" or "Batman" (either the TV shows or the movies)?   The "Batman" movies. Tim Burton...Jack Nicholson...need I say more?   5. "Sex & The City" or "Friends"?   Even though "Friends" has gone stale, I'd still have to choose "Friends" over "Sex & The City", which is a total chick show.    6. "The Wizard of Oz" or the "Harry Potter" movies?   I'd choose "The Wizard Of Oz", but only if I was allowed to turn the sound off and put on Pink Floyd's "Dark Side Of The Moon" as the soundtrack. I love the way they seem synchronized. I have always hated that movie itself though, ever since I was a child. The "Harry Potter" movies are nicely made, with good visual effects, but there are just too many stupid elements in them for me to enjoy them thoroughly. If I had to choose bwteen the two on their own merits, I guess I'd choose the "Harry Potter" movies because I really hate the singing in "The Wizard Of Oz". Musicals suck.   7. "The Simpsons" or "King of the Hill"?   Easy one. "The Simpsons" is one of the most brilliant TV shows ever created.    8. "Grease" or "Saturday Night Fever"?   Automatically, I'd choose "Saturday Night Fever" because it's not a musical. I freakin' hate musicals. Besides, "Saturday Night Fever" was a pretty good movie anyway.    9. Old prime-time soaps: "Dallas" or "Dynasty"?   I would choose neither. Soaps are a total waste of time and mind. The only way I could choose would be based on their hot chick factor. "Dallas" had Victoria Principal, but "Dynasty" had Heather Locklear. "Dynasty" it is then.   10. Not very thought-provoking this week...do you prefer TV shows or movies?   Movies or television, it doesn't matter as long as it's good. I'd be just as happy to sit through a brilliant film as I would a brilliant TV show.

         urlLink Saturday 8      What if a million dollars fell off a back of a truck. Would you keep it?    If no one saw me take it and if the money wasn't traceable... HELL YES. For one thing, if you have a million dollars and are stupid enough to allow it to fall from a truck, or even allow it to be in the position where it  could  fall off a truck, you don't deserve it.   What if you were most powerful person in the world. How would you use that power?   I would try to do good for people, try to make everyone's life better, not just my own. I would set limits to how much money and property any one person could possess, I'd make people share the wealth. However, I would certainly see to it that me and mine lived very well.    What if you had exactly one year to live. What are the three things you'd want to do before you died?    Travel across the country, compose and record an album, and, umm ...score (as much as possible).    What if you could change one thing about the world. What would that one thing be?   I would eliminate religion entirely. People wouldn't be able to hurt and kill each other in the name of their god's name anymore. Churches and their riches would be given back to the people, to feed and to house the poor. Without religion, peace in the world would almost be possible.    What if you could take one thing back. What would that one thing be? What is something you said, something you stole, something you did wrong?    Something I did wrong, when I was young and stupid, and I will leave it at that. Sorry, but it's too personal.    What if you were stuck on an island forever but had all the water, food and shelter you needed. What would be the three other things you'd bring with you?    I would absolutely have to have a guitar, a lifetime supply of guitar strings, and a wonderful woman to share the island with.   What if the internet didn't exist? How do you think people would communicate?   The same ways they did before the internet existed: telephone, letter writing, morse code, whatever.    What if everyone liked each other. What would we complain about?   About who likes who more: "You like him better than me", "She likes me more than you", etc...

        The  urlLink Friday Five     1. How many times have you truly been in love?    Grrrr....I don't like these questions. Several times. I'll leave it at that, since the result is still the same: me, alone.     2. What was/is so great about the person you love(d) the most?   Since I didn't end up with any of them, it's hard to consider any of them the person I loved the most. I'll just speak of the last girl I fell for, and what I liked about her most was her smile and the way she laughed when I'd say something funny. Grrrr... next question.   3. What qualities should a significant other have?   She should have a great sense of humor and intelligence, She should be soft, strong,  patient, loving, caring, romantic, and up for almost anything fun. She should smell good, have kind eyes and a pretty smile. But, most important of all, she should love me, really love me. She should also be real, not imaginary. Next question.   4. Have you ever broken someone's heart?   Me? Well, maybe once, when I was a teenager. I used to talk to a friend of my sister's on the phone a lot and we always got along well. Eventually we met in person. We talked, held hands, and liked each other just fine. Then, the next day, on my birthday, we went out to the movies together and all she did was eat, eat, eat. She was a fat girl, and me being a fat guy, I just didn't want to be with someone who wasn't as ashamed and embarrassed of being fat as I was. I was embarrassed by her. It was really my problem, though, I know that now, but I wasn't mature enough to deal with it then. She was really nice to me too. She really liked me a lot, and I think I just might have broken her heart. I don't know for certain though, since we never really spoke again. I believe my sister told me that the girl eventually slimmed down, because of me, she said. Too bad I couldn't have seen past my own deficiencies, we may have had a good time together and maybe even slimmed down together.    5. If there was one thing you could teach people about love, what would it be?   Women always complain that men are jerks, but they're the ones who make it possible for jerks to thrive. They create more jerky guys in the world because they always choose the jerk over the nice guy. Therefore, I would teach women this: start going for the nice guys in the world. You do that, then soon the jerks won't have any women to be jerks to. They'll have to start changing their jerky ways or be alone. If you keep going for the jerks, and I guarantee you this, there will never be a shortage of jerks in the world. Women shouldn't settle for anything less than a man who will treat her right.

        Lately, I've been...     Listening to : Nothing. I blew one of my speakers in my room and I haven't listened to anything since ...dammit.   Watching on TV : "Everybody Loves Raymond", "Seinfeld", "Insomniac with Dave Attell", "Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn", "Monty Python's Flying Circus", "Blackadder", and movies. I watched "Jerry Maguire", finally...I think I must be the last person in America to have seen it. Good movie. I also got to watch "Vanilla Sky", after missing it repeatedly for the past two weeks, and loved it. Great movie. I think I've enjoyed all of Cameron Crowe's work so far. I think I saw another movie this last week, but I can't remember right now.  Oh...it was "The Andromeda Strain". It was a pretty good movie, really interesting and well done, but a bit dated.   Downloading : I've been downloading a bunch of Blackadder episodes. I watched a few too, some that I'd never seen before. Brilliantly funny stuff. Rowan Atkinson kills me. I want to get all of it on DVD someday.   Reading : Well I started reading Victor Hugo's "Les Miserables", but I haven't picked it up for days. I've been going to bed too late to read before bedtime.    Jamming : We played with two new guys tonight, Santana (a percussionist) and Ronnie (sax & flute), at their warehouse. They have a room inside of their lawn service warehouse set up really nicely. They were pretty good, especially Ronnie. He made a big difference on a lot of the songs we played, especially "Stuck In The Middle" (where he played sax) and JP's "Promise You The Moon" (where he played flute). Santana is pretty good, but I get the feeling he's the leader of his band (their band is broken up/on hiatus, pending the return of their drummer, who is injured) and he tends to try and direct everything too much, ending songs when he wants them to end rather than letting the musicians play it out. The first thing we jammed on was my Los Lobos-like song in E, but I added a change to D then Db rather than going to the song's usual chorus. It sounded great. We played "Before You Accuse Me" and it was ok (I'm not big on that one), we played "Feelin' Alright" (which was decent), jammed on "Tequila" then into "Break On Through". I tried playing "I Got Loaded", but JP didn't know the words and I had to try and sing it, but I sucked, and it didn't get far. We played that new song that JP and I worked on the other day, but it still needs work on the chorus. Ronnie played the riff with me and it sounded really cool, Van Morrison-like. We also tried playing Van's "Wild Night", but it didn't turn out real well since neithe Al nor me had played it before and we didn't know the chords. We did "Mustang Sally", but we did it with my own funky rhythm pattern. I thought it sounded great, but JP kept jumping in on the turnaround too quick, not going with the flow. We ended on one of Santana's songs, a two-chord song, which was alright. He had certain percussive parts to it that we kept blowing, never having heard the song before, but it was ok. We didn't have a drummer again, and that's becoming a problem. JP and Al want to try going acoustic next time. I guess I'll give it a shot, but that's definitely not where I want to be going with my music. Oh, I showed Al that Allman Brothers-like song I came up with but he thought it was too much like one of theirs. I guess I'll can that riff, but I might be able to work something with the rest of it.    Working :  Not working still, but I'm dying to get out there and get looking for a job. I have to get my sleep schedule back on track first.    Buying : Nothing, unless you count the two Filet-O-Fish sandwiches I had tonight.    Eating : This week: two Filet-O-Fish sandwiches, oatmeal cookies, I had ham & green beans with potatoes (all canned) several times this week, kielbasa and pasta, and a Boston Market chicken dinner & raw carrots. Over the weekend, me and Mom watched a documentary on Hershey Park and we both started jonesing for chocolate. We had to make a late night Walgreens run and we got chocolate milk and ice cream. I got Chunkey Monkey from Ben and Jerry, and this killer waffle cone (the cone bits are covered in chocolate) vanilla ice cream (with caramel swirled in it) from Edy's. Sadly, we didn't get any actual Hershey's choclate though. I haven't been eating a whole lot, much less than usual.    Feeling : My ears are still messed up, they were popping like crazy tonight, and I'm still prety congested. I have a headache coming on right now. I'm not sleeping well either, so I'm pretty tired feeling too. I don't feel good.    Planning : Everything. Planning on getting myself, my life, back on track and moving forward. Just waiting on myself to get well so I can start.

         urlLink 3 For Thursday    There is no new one this week, so I'm using last week's questions:  Topic: Growing Up   1. What were 3 Summer Night games you used to play growing up?    Kick The Can was a big one, as was Capture The Flag. We also played Kickball out in the street, more of a day game, but we played it into the night as well.    2. What were your 3 favorite board games to play?    Checkers and Monopoly was it for me. I don't remember playing any other board games. We had Operation and I loved playing Battleship whenever I could, but they're not really board games, are they?     3. What were 3 mischievous/fun things you used to do?    Three? You don't know me very well, obviously. I did tons of fun/mischievous things, I wouldn't know where to start. I can tell you the three most bizarre things I ever did for fun though:  1) Me and my friend JP were out in his yard one day trying to play soccer or something. Our play was impeded by the many, many piles of dogshit in his yard (he had a couple big dogs at the time), so we cleared the field by taking a stick and flinging the poo off the field, which was a good idea, and onto the side of his trailer, which probably wasn't such a good idea. We must have had about 20 or 30 piles of dogshit sticking to the side of his house before his parents discovered what we were doing. They could not believe we were doing this, they were totally mystified, and very pissed.  2) I live along a busy highway, with a ditch and a fence separating the road from my backyard. As a kid, we used to throw things over the fence at the cars. Not a very smart thing to do, looking back, but great fun at the time. Besides throwing the obligatory fruits and vegetables, we'd hollow out potatoes and fill them with every condiment we could find, a nasty mix. Myself, I enjoyed throwing weird stuff, stuff no one would ever expect to fly into their car in a million years. I'd throw whole loafs of bread or unopened packages of hot dogs, always aiming for the open window and sometimes actually getting in in! Again, these people probably could not believe we were doing this, they were likely mystified, and probably pissed. I know my Mom was. She'd come home and half the food in the house would be gone.  3) I liked doing things that were strange and absurd. One time, I wanted to move the newspaper box from the front of my park to the median strip of the highway, just to confuse and piss off the newspaper guy (I guess confusing and pissing people off was my thing). So my friend Mike and I were moving it, probably around 2 am, and we were halfway across the highway when Mike dropped his end and ran off giggling. I couldn't move it myself, so I dropped mine and ran off too. Someone at the corner trailer had heard us and I saw their curtain open, so we hauled ass from the roadside. As we got around the corner I told him that was pretty stupid and asked him "what if someone hits it". Just as I was saying this, there was a very loud crash followed by very loud screeching and squealing. We turned toward the road, knowing immediately what had happened, and saw the top of a car lumber past us, with a wall of sparks 10 feet high in front of it. They drove like that all the way down the road. We were scared shitless. We knew we were going to get busted for sure, after all, someone had seen us and everyone one in the neighborhood surely heard that ungodly screeching. Mike ran all the way home and I ran into my house, quietly as possible, and went straight to my bed where I yelled "Mom! What was that noise?", trying to create an alibi for myself. She said something like "I don't know....go back to bed". I kept an eye out, from my bedrom window, and I kept my ears open, listening for an ambulance (I had no idea whether someone had been hurt or not). Eventually, I saw a police cruiser come down the street into the park. He drove slowly, and right past my house. I thought it was all over for me. Strangely enough, we never got caught, in fact, we never heard more anything about it, except from our friends in the park the next day, who asked if we'd heard that loud noise. One kid heard it and he lived five blocks away. My guess is that the driver was drunk, I mean it'd be hard to miss a giant newspaper box in the middle of the road. And since there never appeared to be any investigation, I assume the police thought the driver had hit the box in their drunkedness. It was more scary for me than fun, but it was definitely mischievous, even though it wasn't intended, by me, to be as dangerous as it turned out to be.   4. What were your 3 most favorite toys? Do you still have any of them?    How can "3 for Thursday" have four questions? I'm freaking out here, man! Anyhow, to answer the question/s, my favorite is probably my teddy bear. I got him when I was a baby, up in Pennsylvania and I still have him. He's missing an eye and some fur, his blue ribbon is long gone, but he's still here. My Big Wheel was a toy that I loved to death. Man that thing was fun! I wish I had a Big Wheel now, though it'd have to be much larger. I don't know what other toys I would consider a favorite, most simply came and went, the Star Wars stuff, the GI Joe stuff, etc... If my bike counts, then I'd choose it. I loved riding it through puddles, jumping off of it at full speed like a stuntman, popping wheelies...good times.

         urlLink Wednesday What-Ifs?    1.  What if you had to wear one item of clothing every single day for the rest of your life?   I think I'd wear a loose-fitting robe, like what Jesus wears in all those pictures of him and like they still wear in Arab countries today. It'd keep the sun off me when I'm outside and it would cover all the naughty bits, yet it would still be cool and unrestricting. Ahhh...  2.  What if you had to stay in one town/city and never step foot outside its lines for the rest of your life?   I'd move the hell away from here, that's for damn sure! My first thought would be to choose New York City, since it has so much that appeals to me (museums, entertainment, nightlife), but Asheville, North Carolina is awful tempting too since it has a lot of cool stuff (music, arts) and it's got much more nature to enjoy (the best of both worlds, almost). I really love my hometown of Cochranville, Pennsylvania too. It's small, not a whole lot to do, but life is enjoyable there, peaceful. Tough one. I guess I'd choose Asheville. NYC is just too crowded and expensive and Cochranville is just too small and not varied enough.  3.  What if you had to eat and drink only one kind of food and one kind of beverage for the rest of your life?   Mexican food & iced tea.  4.  What if you had to pretend to be someone else for the rest of your life?   Would it just be me pretending around here, or would I actually possess that person's life and fill their shoes? If it's just me pretending around the house, I'd say Jimi Hendrix, since I'm a guitar player and I consider him the greatest guitarist ever. If I had to have someone else's life, complete with all of their possessions...well it wouldn't hurt to be a rich guy, someone living a life of luxury. Hugh Hefner or Bill Gates, perhaps. Hefner's old, but he's still got  the life . Bill's got the money to have  the life  if he wanted it, so either of them would be fine with me.   5.  What if you could only have one of your five senses (touch, sight, hearing, smell, or taste) for the rest of your life?    Sight. I figured it'd be hearing since I'm a guitar player, but without the sense of touch, I'd probably be a lousy guitarist. I love being able to see, and I think I'd miss that more than anything else. People, their reactions & expressions, smiles, women, art, TV, butterflies, clouds, snow falling from the sky, birds in flight... I'd miss seeing life more than I'd miss touching it, hearing it, smelling it or tasting it.

         urlLink This-Or-That Tuesday    1.  Cats or dogs?    Cats. Dogs are fine, but they require more time, work, and patience. Cats are good pets for lazy people like myself. Plus, they don't slobber all over you or try to hump your leg. I have a strict "no humping" policy when it comes to my pets.  2.  Butterflies or birds?    Awww... I know it doesn't sound real manly, but I think both are beautiful. I guess I'll go with butterflies though, since I've never seen a Hitchcock movie about menacing butterflies.   3.  Horses or cows?    Cows. They're both big and powerful, but I think, if it came down to it, I could take a cow, whereas a horse might be able to kick my ass. Plus, cows have that whole "steak" thing going for them... little do they know.   4.  Turtles or snakes?    I really wouldn't want either as a pet; reptiles don't do anything for me. I guess if I had to have one as a pet though, turtles are the more entertaining animals to watch. They eat, they walk, they swim, they stick their heads in and out of their little shells. Snakes eat and sit there. Plus, some snakes are poisonous, which sucks. In fact, the prospect of a rattlesnake crawling into my sleeping bag has totally put me off of going camping. Who needs to wake up with a pair of fangs in your ass? A kinky vampire, perhaps, but not me. I'd only have to worry about turtles if I went skinny-dipping in a pond filled with snapping turtles.   5.  Frogs or grasshoppers?   Frogs eat mosqitoes and I hate those little blood-sucking bastards, so definitely frogs.   6.  Lions or tigers?   Both are awesome, but Tigers have vibrant colors and they also have that whole striped thing going for them. Gorgeous animals. It'd almost be an honor to have such a beautiful creature rip my throat out.  7.  Elephants or mice?   I don't think I'd want either in my house. Here's how I see it: an elephant could easily kick my ass, whereas I know I could kick the shit out of a mouse, even the most badass, Steven Seagal-like mouse you could find. But on the other hand, mice give me the creeps (especially that Mickey bastard) and I could ride on an elephant and stomp on my enemies. Hmmm..this is a tough one. I will go with the elephant because, in my neighborhood, people will hassle a guy who has mice, but no one messes with a guy who has elephants.   8.  Porcupines or aardvarks?   Who the hell would want a freaking porcupine? That's a pet for S & M freakos only. The only thing I could possibly do with a porcupine is chuck it at someone I hated. I'd definitely choose the Aardvark. Besides  not  sticking you with sharp, pointy quills, they eat ants and I don't like ants. I'm very anti-ant.  9.  Unicorns or dragons?   This is a trick question. You didn't say whether the dragon was friendly or not. I wouldn't want a dragon that would kill me and my family and destroy my village, you know? I would want one that obeyed me, one that would fly me wherever I wanted to go (to work, to 7-11, to the Super Bowl), one that would barbecue chickens for me with his fiery breath, and one that would destroy all of my enemies (that means you, Mike, you prick). He'd have to be house-broken too, because there's no way in hell I'm cleaning up dragon doody. That all said, if the dragon isn't friendly and won't obey me, then I'll take the unicorn. They're boring, they won't destroy my enemies for me, but they're decent chick magnets.  10.  Thought-provoking question of the week: You live in a rather dumpy apartment. A friend offers you a chance to be a roommate at a new place s/he is moving into, but they don't allow pets. You have a pet. Do you find your pet a new home and take the new place, or do you keep your pet and stay put?   That's easy. I'd forgo the new apartment. I can't stand people who abandon their pets, especially when they've had the pets for years. That makes me sad. I'd like to climb upon my dragon or my elephant and destroy those people.

         urlLink Monday Mission    1.  What habit do people have that drives you crazy but doesn't seem to bother anyone else?    It drives me crazy when people buy into and practice religion. That, and smoking in public places.    2.  Have you had any expensive car trouble recently?    No, the upkeep on Matchbox cars is fairly inexpensive. Not having a real car, that's all I have for that answer.  3.  How do you feel about mothers who breastfeed their children in public? At what age do you think they should stop?    I feel they should share. I don't think they should ever stop sharing. You know, we have a tendency in this country  to "dirty up" things that are perfectly natural and normal. I don't mind public breastfeeding. Go for it. When should they stop? When the kid's buddies start coming around asking for some? I don't know exactly, probably before pre-school, most definitely before college.  4.  Do you recall the first item from your youth that became an "antique" and made you feel old and how you felt?    I have some underwear that come close to being "antique", but I don't think that's what is meant here. I don't know about all that "feeling old" jazz, but the first thing from my youth that became highly collectible was my Mego Star Trek dolls, from back in the mid 1970's. How does it make me feel to know my toys are someone else's collectible? Like I probably shouldn't have thrown Capt. Kirk up on my roof and left him there to rot.   5.  Do you like rainy days/nights? What type of weather makes you feel relaxed?    I love the rain. Day or night, it's all good.  6.  Have you ever found that you have become that which you once ridiculed?    No, I think I've always held unemployed fat bastards who still live at home, even though they're in their 30's, in pretty high regard. I think the only people I ever ridiculed were really stupid people. I'm a lot of things, but I'd like to think I'm not that.  7.  Have you ever sent an e-mail to the wrong person? What was the most embarrassing experience you remember?    I've sent emails to myself on accident, but hardly anything to get embarrassed by.  BONUS:  You know, you got me spellbound what else can it be?    A gas leak?

        My Current State Of Wonderfulness   Status: Partially Wonderful  I still haven't shaken my ear problems and I am due to run out of this current batch of antibiotics tonight. Not good. I can't afford another doctor's office visit either. I still have some congestion too, but I'm not as worried about that since I'm almost always congested anyway (because of my allergies). I would like to have my hearing all the way back though. I don't think that's too much to ask. I've had to deal with this crap for about three weeks now... I'm beyond over it. I want to be alright again so I can get on with things that need to be done. If I'm not better by tomorrow, which doesn't seem likely, I will have to call the doctor's and try to get a prescription without coming in for a visit. I tried doing that the other day, but he insisted that I come in. This time, if he insists I come in again, I will have to tell him "I can't". I don't know how they'd react to that. If he won't help me, I guess I'll just have to start taking the Allegra, for my allergies, and hope that it helps with my ears somehow. This shit sucks. We should have universal healthcare in this country. No one should be in the position where your finances dictate your health.

        I Have Company!   Mom and I went and picked up my nephew earlier in the evening. We didn't stay too long at his house; I was pretty anxious to get going. He hadn't eaten, so we stopped at Wendys and Jesse got some chow. Later, as we were almost home, we stopped at the Walgreens down the street. Before we went in though, we went out back, to the retention pond, and we beat the stuffing out of a bunch of  urlLink cattails . Man! We had the cattail fluff flying! We were both covered in it. We're going to go back up, probably tomorrow, to cut some down, bring them home, and blow them up with firecrackers. We're going to have cattail fluff flying  everywhere ! I bought a bunch of junk food for us at Walgreens, including two pints of Edy's Dreamery Ice Cream (New York Strawberry Cheesecake & Coney Island Waffle Cone), a box of drumsticks (the ice cream treat), pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds (unshelled), and a box of donuts (for breakfast). That, my friends, is $14 worth of junk food.. believe it or not. We chowed on the Strawberry Cheesecake ice cream after we got home... man, that was good stuff!  I played with Jess on the PC for most of the night. I showed him a bunch of funny FARK photoshops on the FARK site, and then we wound up working on his page a bunch, completely overhauling it. It's got a whole new design, plus it's loaded with "goodies" now! He just needs to start writing in it more. He's only done two entries all year. I hope the new look and the new links and gadgets will get him blogging more often. I think it's a great, positive activity for kids to do. I worked with him on his grammar and spelling too. He had fun with it, plus he learned some new things, so it was time well spent.   I'm obviously still awake, but he crashed on the couch around 2am, after "Metal Mania" (on VH-1 Classic) ended. I don't know when I'm heading to bed. I'm not really tired, more hungry than anything, and I haven't been going to bed until daylight lately. I should try to get some sleep though, otherwise, I'll have to go through the day with little or no sleep and that would be bad. I'm going to need all the energy I muster up tomorrow, between band practice and keeping Jesse entertained.

        My Hairy Shower Buddies   Ok... I'll admit it, right here, right now, for all the world to see: I shower with hairy guys... regularly. Of course, those hairy guys are Jimmy and Stevie, my two male cats. Jimmy, my chubby black & white cat, has been joining me during my showers for awhile now. Sometimes, even leads me to the shower, the same way he'll lead me to their empty food bowl, like he wants me to turn the shower on for him.   When I'm in there, Jimmy usually sits on the ledge, outside the shower curtain, and will peer into the shower to see what's going on in there. I usually play with him by aiming the shower head at the curtain and he swats at the streams as they hit the curtain and sometimes he falls in the tub! Today, I noticed, he swatted at the stream while his tail and one leg were fully in the tub, getting soaked! He didn't seem to mind at all! Sometimes I'll stand under the shower so that the water will trickle down my arm to my fingers and I'll drip water on him. He usually just drinks the water.   My favorite cat, the late Fluffy, did that too. Fluffy would also swat at the drips as they'd fall. I still miss Fluff a lot.   Jimmy also licks the water off the curtain and spickets as well. His brother, the smaller gray cat, is a lot less daring. Stevie usually stands off and observes, but today he got up on the ledge and got a little wet. His tail especially. He didn't go for the streams though, so I poked at him through the shower curtain and he'd bite at my finger, but he'd rather run off then risk falling in the tub. The little chickenshit...   My friend JP has a wacko cat that actually  loves  showers. I'd never heard anything like it. JP says the cat runs around inside the shower, under the water and everything! I wonder if Jimmy will eventually get to that point. That'd be kind of cool. The only downside might be that he'd start wanting his own private showers and by the time I'd get mine, there'd be no hot water left!

        On The Horizon...   We're supposed to pick up Jesse, my older nephew, tomorrow night (which, I guess, is actually  tonight ). He's going to stay until Sunday night. I had wanted him down for a full week, just like last year. I kept asking my sister about having him down and she never bothered to get back to me about it or make plans with me. Hell, she never even asked him if he wanted to come down like she said she would. So now, with school less than two weeks away, with his football season beginning, and with him having company next week, I only get him for  four fucking days , with only a single day to prepare for his arrival and plan things we can do. I guess I'm lucky to get him for the four days; my sister didn't even try to work with me on having my niece down this year (she spent a week down here last year). My sister's really been pissing me off for awhile now. It seems like she'll bend over backwards for her wealthy in-laws, but when it comes to her own family, me and Mom, it often seems like she could care less how we feel. I like seeing the kids and doing stuff with them, so does my Mom, but my sister lives an hour away from here so we don't get to see them much. However, quite often, my sister comes down this way to go to the beach with the kids and she doesn't even show us the consideration of stopping by to say hello... even when I've asked her to. She's always too busy, too inconvenienced... everthing's a hassle with her. She even quit exchanging birthday and Christmas gifts with me, saying she doesn't think it's fair that she be expected to buy me something when she can't afford to. Christmas, I can understand: she's got three kids to buy for, so it's not that big a deal to me (I still bought her gifts anyway, not expecting anything in return), but not giving gifts on birthdays is too much. Birthdays are about the person whose birthday it is, it's their day to feel special, to feel loved. You just don't blow off the birthday of someone you love, it's not right. On my last birthday, she came down here and went shopping, buying stuff for her, my niece and my younger nephew, but she couldn't even see fit to pick out a $10 CD for me. It's not that I feel like I have to have more stuff either, it's about seeing the little joys in life taken away, the family stuff, the traditions, the considerations. They say it's the thought that counts, and it's true, but it seems like my sister's becoming more and more thoughtless all the time. Enough about her... it bothers me too much, makes me angry, and there isn't anything I can say or do to make her change her ways anyway.   I talked to JP tonight too. Jimmy, the drummer, isn't going to make it to practice this week. This is not good at all and it really worries me. He's only available one day a week, and sometimes, not even that. If the band starts doing well, his lack of free time could stall, and possibly prevent, the band's progress and success. I would like to be getting together  at least  twice a week to play. We're progressing at a snail's pace. JP wants us to go into the studio in a month and we've barely played together at all! JP, Al, and I are going to get together on Thursday (at Circle) anyway and try to tighten up our rhythm and try out some new ideas (mostly mine) with the songs JP wants to do in the studio. I was going to bring Jess along, but now that's it's mostly going to be working and arranging, I don't think that'd be a good idea. Maybe Mom can take him swimming that night.

        The French-Banana War   Yes, I am watching Eddie Izzard.. again. I should be in bed, and in fact  I was  in bed for awhile, but I couldn't sleep, so I just got up. I slept maybe 3 hours last night, so I should've fallen to sleep as soon as I hit the bed tonight, but I didn't. I suppose some of it is my own fault, since I didn't just  go to bed  when I went to bed. I put my new Mitch Hedberg CD on and listened to it in bed (along with Stevie, who wanted some attention), but then, after it ended, I tried to sleep but I couldn't. I started thinking about music, and then I played guitar in bed a little bit, and then I tried to sleep again but I still kept thinking about music, and by then I was feeling warm and sweaty, which made me uncomfortable, but I was also uncomfortable because my sheets were on me sideways... ugh! Why can't I just be normal? I'm dead tired, really. What is wrong with me? Oh well, at least Eddie is on "the tuber"... and that's pretty darn cool. Ciao!

        WTF!?!?   Man. I think I've been hacked. Around 4am, as I was shutting down for the night, I suddenly started having weird PC problems, mainly with Explorer. Things started freezing up, then a deleted item wouldn't delete, so I restarted my PC and it wouldn't start up right (the screen looked like safe mode, with the big icons and stuff). I hit con+alt+del to see what I had running and there was something listed as "unknown" in there. I immediately shut off my PC and as it was shutting down a strange box appeared on the screen. I caught the word "frequency" and saw numbers spinning by and quickly pulled my cable modem plug. Next, I started up again (it still looked like safe mode, but wasn't) and went straight to Kazaalite and downloaded a firewall. I thought for a minute and then decided to do a system restore and that straightened out the big icon/safe mode deal. I had to reinstall the firewall again, but I'm up and running and everything looks normal again.    Whew!

        On The Issues   Wow! I just found a great site that I thought I'd share! It's called " urlLink On The Issues ". It lets you see how all of the 2004 presidential candidates (and all other elected officials) feel on the issues based on their voting record and on comments they've made. It's really a fantastic tool for learning and research. I'm still researching all of the candidates for the upcoming election and I want to be sure to support the right person. Right now,  urlLink I'm supporting Dennis Kucinich . In my opinion, he is  exactly  the kind of person we need in the Oval Office. For instance, here's what Kucinich said about the economic divide in this country:   Economic inequality is the result of two and a half decades of government policies and rules governing the economy being tilted in favor of large asset owners at the expense of wage earners. Tax policy, trade policy, monetary policy, government regulations and other rules have reflected this pro-investor bias. We propose the introduction or reintroduction of a package of legislative initiatives that will close Americas economic divide and address both income and wealth disparities.   The concentration of wealth is a problem because it distorts our democracy, destabilizes the economy and erodes our at our social and cultural fabric. Too much concentrated wealth leads to too much concentrated power and begins to undermine our participatory democracy.    Unfortunately, I don't think he'll be able to get the Democratic Party nomination since he's so progressive (like there's something wrong with that). You never know though, sometimes longshots pay off. Either way, I'd like to find a "backup candidate" to support, just in case. Most of the others are just so middle-of-the-road, politically, though... I guess I'm off to " urlLink On The Issues " to do some more research.

        Stupid Corporate Automatons   I was busy all night last night listing auctions on eBay (I listed 79 of them last night, a personal record) and today I receive an email that they've cancelled several of my auctions because of a violation of policy within my auction descriptions (which has been in my item descriptions all year). The violation was this line:  "I accept Paypal (for cards ending under $2, winning bidder agrees to add $0.30 to the price to cover Paypal costs)"   The reason I had that line in there was because a lot of my auctions (the majority) were ending at $1.00, of which eBay takes $0.40 (the $0.35 listing fee + a 5% ending price fee) and Paypal* takes another $0.30 (minimum), leaving me with a "profit" of about $0.30 per card, which is not even a "profit" at all, since I paid $1.00 or more for most of my cards. I put the $0.30 Paypal fee in there so I'd make at least $0.50 per card. That's fair enough isn't it?  Well, apparently to eBay it isn't (or whomever reported me to eBay). It's a violation of their rules. Ok, no problem: their site, their rules. I went and edited the "offending line" out of 118 auctions, which was a time-consuming pain-in-the-ass, but hey, their site, their rules.  The thing that really burns me up is this: none of my auctions  can  end for less than $2 anymore. I now start them all at $2 or $3. The offending policy violation  isn't even applicable . So, in reality, they cancelled some of my auctions for nothing, and I can't just re-list them because I deleted the scans from my computer, so now I'll have to re-scan them all too. Bastards!   I miss the old days when people used common sense and discretion. Too many huge corporations, too much automation, not enough dealing with people and their problems on a one-on-one basis. They didn't have to cancel my auctions. They could have just emailed me and asked me to take the line out. I certainly would have complied. But no... rather than using some common sense, or showing me some courtesy, they just zap my auctions like it's nothing. Nothing but my time and my effort.  *Just to note: Paypal was bought by eBay awhile back, so in reality, if I sell a card for $1, it's eBay, the corporation, that gets $0.70 of the dollar, leaving me with a measly $0.30. Nice, huh?

         urlLink Monday Mission     1. Have you ever had, or known someone who has had, a "Mid-Life Crisis?" What happened? Is there such a thing or is it just an excuse?   I haven't, no, and I'm not sure I know anyone who has. I know there are people in the world who use it as an excuse to behave like assholes though, cheating on their spouses and whatnot.     2. Have you ever had a dream so vivid, that you woke up with certain emotions towards a person for what happened in your dream, even though they didn't do a thing to deserve it in real life? What did you feel and and what was the dream?   No, I can't say that I have ever had that occur.    3. How do you express your creativity? Have you ever made money from it?   I make music and I also write (in my blog) a lot. I also use my creativity when my niece and nephews visit, trying to think up fun stuff to do with them. I have made exactly $1 playing music so far.     4. Has anything you created ever been stolen? How did you handle it?   Not that I know of, no.    5. Do you think downloading music via file sharing is "stealing?" Is taking songs without paying for them any different than someone taking your work without your permission?    No, I do not feel that just downloading songs is stealing. If you can listen to songs on the radio and TV, why not on your computer? The only difference is, I'd get to decide which songs I hear. However, if you burn the music to disc, then I'd say that is stealing because you have the music in the same format intended for consumers to buy.     6. How do you feel about the RIAA targeting everyone (parents, teenagers, grandparents) who share songs over the Internet with expensive lawsuits? Should they be selective in who they subpoena, or should all who violate copyrights be treated equally? Or are they going too far? Should the music be free?   The RIAA are a bunch of greedy scumbags. They don't want to change with the times, so they try to sue people to keep things the same. The thing is, times  have  changed and so must they. The RIAA is anti-technology and anti-consumer. There is no good reason a CD should be almost $20, other than pure greed.   7. On the same thought, what do you think pay-per-song concepts such as iMusic and BuyMusic.com? Will they succeed? Is this the solution? If not, what is?     This seems to be what the public wants, but I still think there should be a division between songs downloaded just to check out and songs downloaded so I can burn them to disc or put on an MP3 player. I don't think I'd want to pay .99 per song if I'm just going to listen to it once and say "nah".    BONUS: Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday?   I  was  myself yesterday, who were you?

         urlLink Monday Madness     1. What one thing do you wish would never have been invented? Why?   Religion. It divides people, causes them to do horrific things in the name of their god, makes them feel superior to others who don't believe the way they do, and on and on and on. It's the worst thing mankind has ever done to itself, and it seems irreversible and unending. Religion will die when mankind does, and more likely than not, religion will be the reason behind the destruction of man.    2. If you could change the speed limit on the highways, what would you change it to?   20 M.P.H.   People are too concerned about time and getting to places as fast as possible... why? Stop and smell the roses, I say.    3. What word or words do you misspell consistently?   None that I know of. I used to misspell religion "religeon", but my Humanities teacher alerted me to it and I corrected myself. My main problem is typos.    4. What wealthy person is the least deserving of their fortune? Why?   I don't have any one specific person in mind, but many people in the entertainment industry are way overpaid. It's sickening that an actor or an athelete could make 100 million dollars in a single year, while a school teacher could never make that much in two lifetimes spent teaching.   Billionaires sicken me too (and those with more money than they will ever need or could possibly ever use), with money just sitting in banks making them even more money, while so many people out there could use that money to put roofs over their heads, to feed themselves, cloth themselves, to educate themselves... billionaires are hoggiest hogs at the trough.

        Busy... For A Change   I spent most of yesterday working on my auction/card stuff. I pulled cards the night before, but I changed my mind on some and went back and pulled some different ones. Then, I scanned them all and listed them on eBay, sent winners notices to the folks who won auctions last night, took a short break, and then went through my boxes of cards looking for even more cards to list. I was working from 6:30pm until almost 4:00am.  Today, I'll be scanning and listing more cards. I listed a  shitload  last night! Sixty auctions! I was proud that I'd managed to get  fifty  up last Sunday. I'm going to try to get 70 up tonight. We'll see...  I'm hoping to have Jesse (my older nephew) down next Friday, to spend the week with me. His mom isn't being very helpful with that. I need to call and talk to him about it today. I think he'll want to come down. The only problem is, I don't have any money right now, but there a few cool things I think we could do anyway. I still have firecrackers left over from the 4th of July, and cattails are ripe right now (extra loose and fluffy)... put those two together and you get instant fun! He'd probably like to come to my band practice on Thursday too. He was impressed before, back when we didn't have a steady drummer or a horn player in the band, he'd probably enjoy it a lot more now. I'm always trying to think of stuff we could do that won't cost anything, or very little. I'm sure I'll find some fun things for us to do.

        Me & My Cats   I'm pretty annoyed. Someone left me a crappy note on my zonkboard, saying that I treat my cats badly (now deleted), and it really pissed me off. I shouldn't have to explain myself to some stranger on the internet, but I can't just let their assumption that I'm some kind of an "animal abuser" slide by without a reply either. So here: I do not treat my cats badly. I feed and water them, care for them, I pet them and play with them, and I give them both plenty of attention, each and every day. They are healthy, happy cats. Do I get pissed off at them every now and again? Absolutely. One of them likes to get into stuff he shouldn't and the other is very destructive (to the point of being anal about it). Should I just let the cat chew on items he finds on the dinner table, when he shouldn't even be on the dinner table in the first place? Should I simply allow the other one to dig all the way through the backdoor frame (I can see daylight through it now) or tear up the carpeting in the hallway completely (he's got the fringes shredded already)? No matter how much you love your pets, you have to stop them from doing shit like that, and sometimes that involves yelling at them, chasing them out of places they shouldn't be, and smacking them. I certainly wouldn't do anything to hurt them though, and I don't appreciate being judged as some kind of animal abuser. I would love it if I never had to do any of that stuff, but sometimes I have to, because they have to learn not to do that shit anymore.   I'm also a bit hurt that this person read through several pages of my blog, staying on for more than 24 minutes reading it, and didn't have a single positive thing to say to me, choosing instead to make a negative, ill-informed judgement upon me. That's not cool at all. It's like they overlooked anything good about me to focus on one single incident that I wrote about (I was angry and blowing off some steam), and which they took the wrong way to begin with. Thanks for that.

         urlLink Weekly Wrap-Up      1. What song (new or old) do you secretly enjoy, but publicly ridicule? Why?   I don't think I do that with any songs really. I'm pretty varied, musicwise, and I take pride in the many different types of music that I listen to. However, when it comes to choosing cover songs to play with my band, there are some bands, like Loverboy, for instance, where I'd say "no way" to covering their songs, even though I enjoy their music.    2. Do you carry a purse or tote bag or backpack? If so, what's inside?   Once a week I carry a bag with my music gear in it (to band practice), but I don't carry anything around in my daily life, no.    3. Describe your dream job. Why did you select this one?   I would love to work in a cool record/CD store. Why? Because I love music and I love turning people on to new music and vice versa. It would have to be an independant record/CD store though. You just can't interact with people in most chain or mall stores, plus you are forced to sell crappy music.   4. You are given an opportunity to live anywhere in the world, expense free, but you can never move again. Where do you live? Why?   It'd have to either Pennsylvania (the area I come from) or North Carolina (several of my friends rave about Asheville).    5. What do you like about living in your particular city? Would you recommend it to others as a good place to live and work? Why?   I like the thrift shops and pawn shops. It's an ok place to live if you like low paying jobs, old people, mosquitoes, cockroaches, porn shops/strip clubs, and hot weather.    6. You have a superpower. What is it? What do you do with it? Do you tell anyone?   I always thought it would be cool to stop time. I used to lie in bed and think about it all the time (when I should have been sleeping), especially after hearing about the concept of "wormholes" (gaps in the fabric of time/space). I thought about how cool it would be to find a wormhole, wondered how it would work, how you'd get back, etc... I lost  a lot  of sleep thinking on these things. I also wondered: "What if you could make a person's individual molecules simultaneously move faster than the speed of light... would that person travel backwards in time?" It's no wonder I've suffered through major bouts of insomnia, thinking of stuff like that. What would I do with a power like that?  Anything I wanted to . The world would be mine and I would be free to do whatever I wanted. No one could stop me. I had that power, I don't think it'd be safe to tell anyone; it'd be too dangerous.      7. What five people, living or dead, famous or not, do you wish lived on your block?   Jimi Hendrix, Groucho Marx, John Lennon, and my two best frends, John and Sue (no awwww'ing, ok?).

        Score!!   I just got back from hitting a couple thrift stores and man, did I score!! We went to Salvation Army first and I couldn't believe how many Stephen King and Anne Rice hardcovers and paperbacks they had! And the prices were outstanding: $1 for hardcovers, $0.50 for paperbacks! I should have bought all they had, but I left the ones that I already had or already read. Here's what I got there:  Hardcovers:  "The Book Of Dracula" (27 vampire stories from authors like Bram Stoker, Edgar Allen Poe, Charles Dickens, etc..) "Lasher" by Anne Rice (this is the one I passed on last week at a different thrift store... for $5) "Hearts In Atlantis" by Stephen King "Insomnia" by Stephen King "Collected Writings" Sigmund Freud "Bad As I Wanna Be" by Dennis Rodman (I know... it'll be pretty stupid, but he was a great basketball player and I got it for the NBA stories)  Paperbacks:  "Cry To Heaven" by Anne Rice (large paperback) "Different Seasons" by Stephen King "Roadwork" by Stephen King "The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger" by Stephen King "Othello" by William Shakespeare (I already have this one, but this is a newly revised edition) "Twelfth Night" by William Shakespeare "Miss America" by Howard Stern  Total price for 13 books: $10.00  Woo Hoo!!  From there we went on to Goodwill and I had some more good luck: I found a nice hardcover of "The Return Of Sherlock Holmes" by Arthur Conan Doyle! Yes! I love his Sherlock Holmes stories! I also picked up a hardcover of "Son Of Fletch" by Gregory McDonald, a semi-beat-up hardcover of "Needful Things" by Stephen King", a softcover of "Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee" by Dee Brown (about the "systematic destruction of the American Indian during the second half of the nineteenth century"), and a paperback of "I'm Not Really Here" by Tim Allen. Those cost me about $7.00. I also bought 3 cassette tapes for $0.50 each: Sammy Hagar "Three Lock Box", "John Mellencamp - "Dance Naked", and the soundtrack to "All The Right Moves" (to sell on eBay... hopefully). Mom found an Orlando Magic throw blanket (whatever they're called) that I snapped up too ($4). I didn't do as good there as I did at Salvation Army, but I'm happy with what I got. I didn't plan on spending $25 today, but I did!

         urlLink The Friday Five     1. If your life were a movie, what would the title be?   "From The Cradle To The Couch""   2. What songs would be on the soundtrack?   There'd be a lot of original music, from the key scenes where I'm just sitting on the couch playing guitar. I'd have Hendrix's "Voodoo Child (Slight Return)" playing during a really intense, action-packed scene where I'm cleaning my room. I might have Three Dog Night's "One" (you know the song "one... is the lonliest number") playing during the scene when I'm on the toilet and run out of toilet paper.    3. Would it be a live-action film or animated? Why?   Live action. My life isn't entertaining enough to be a cartoon.   4. Casting: who would play you, members of your family, friends, etc?   Jack Black would play me and Roseanne Barr would play my mom. There probably wouldn't be any other roles, not until the sequel "From The Couch To The Comfy Chair".   5. Describe the movie preview/trailer.   The entire movie trailer would consist of me eating a ham sammich while my Mom yells at me for not taking the trash out.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  I had Iron Maiden's "Somewhere In Time" cassette on the other day. I haven't been listening to much though; I just haven't been spending much time in my room (where my stereo is).     Watching on TV:  "The Simpsons", "Everybody Loves Raymond", "Seinfeld", "The Daily Show", "Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn", "Insomniac with Dave Attell", "Trigger Happy TV", "Reno 911", "Primetime Glick", "Shipwrecked", "Trading Spaces", "Jackass", "I'm With Busey" (the only show I feel guilty about watching), and CNN. I also watched Day 6 & Day 7 of the "Running Of The Bulls", from Pamplona, Spain. I don't like animal cruelty, but it's usually the people who end up with injuries, not the bulls, so in that respect, it's not much different than Boxing or Bull Riding. I respect the traditon of the event, which goes back six centuries, but it is a pretty jerky thing to do when you think about it. Now, the Bull Fighting stuff... I don't go for that at all.   Downloading:  Lots of comedy: Emo Phillips, Lewis Black, Mitch Hedberg, Jim Gaffigan, Todd Barry, and Doug Stanhope.    Playing:  I haven't been playing any games, and really haven't played guitar much either (except for last night and tonight).     Reading:  Nothing still, though I have "It" set aside to read.   Jamming:  JP, Al, Jimmy, Ronnie, and I got together tonight at Circle Studios for band practice (Santana's out of town) and we played for three hours. Well, we actually played for a little less than 2 1/2 hours since we were late setting up. We ran through a set and a half (the sets that me and JP put together last Thursday) and it went pretty smoothly, though we're still not real tight and we still make mistakes here and there. Overall, it was a good practice. We played "Blister On The Sun", "Old Apartment", Old Apartment (barenaked ladies), "Wild Night", "What She Loves" (an original), "Opportunity Knocks" (an original), "All For You", "The Way", "You Can't Run" (an original), "American Girl", "Crazy Little Thing Called Love", "Stuck In The Middle With You", "Love The One You're With" (first time we played it together, pretty damn rough), "I Wanna Be Sedated", "Sleeping Forever" (an original), "Authority Song", "Had A Girl" (an original), and "Rock This Town" (first time we played it together, rough, but not too bad). Ronnie brought beer, which helped loosen everyone up. The room was comfortable and sounded good too. We hung around for about 40 minutes afterwards, just bullshitting. Not a bad night.   Working:  I was supposed to apply for a job at the hardware store post office earlier in the week, but I never did. I've been getting up too late in the day again (anywhere between 1:30pm-3pm), which makes getting a job very difficult. I might do it tomorrow, but I also need to pull cards to list on eBay over the weekend. We'll see.     Buying:  I did ok on eBay last week, so I spent a little money this week. I ordered 2 comedy CD's:  urlLink Louis CK  ("Live in Houston") and  urlLink Mitch Hedberg  ("Strategic Grill Locations") through their respective websites. Both CDs are available  only  through those websites too, so once they go out of print, they'll become impossible to find. So I said "fuck it" and ordered them. Yay! There are a couple more I'd like to order when I can afford them (a new Hedberg CD in August, Jake Johannsen "Live At Cobb's", and Harland Williams is supposed to have one out soon).   Eating:  Not really watching what I eat at all. Mom's been buying a lot of junk food (pudding & oatmeal cookies) and soda, so it's tough to eat healthy with that stuff around.  I'm going to start walking in the evenings again (I know...I said that last week too) and I think I'm going to start up with the Slim Fast again. I eat smaller portions nowadays, but I just need to cut way back on the sodas and pudding.   Feeling:  Not bad. If my back wasn't bothering me still, I'd probably say "damn good". The weird thing is, my back pain is coming from the lower left side lately, which is odd for me (usually it's on the right). It feels different than usual too, deeper, if that makes sense.    Planning:  Sometime in August I'm supposed to go into the studio to lay down guitar for JP's CD. Come September, I imagine we're going to start playing out (hopefully) so I will need to get an amplifier and a second guitar by then. I will have to get a job sometime soon, I can't pay bills  and  buy stuff with my eBay money alone.

What are 3 events in history that you would have liked to witness?   1) Woodstock, 1969. 2) The life, death, and "resurrection" of JC. 3) D-Day, The Normandy Invasion, Omaha Beach, 1944.   3. What are 3 world or local events that have taken place in your lifetime that has changed how you live your life  or has made you see things differently?   Hmmm. I'm having a lot of difficulty with this one. I don't know that any event has suddenly altered my way of life or my way of thinking about things.    BONUS: If there could be one event/tragedy that has taken place in the past that you could prevent or erase, what would it be and why?   The invention of religion.

        I'm A Loser, Baby....   Aw, Hell. I never did get off the PC and do anything last night. I finished only two out of seven tasks that I had set aside for yesterday. I finished one more today and started another, so I'm a little more "on the ball" today, I guess. Although, here I am on the PC again, writing about things I should be doing instead of  actually doing them . The irony is not lost on me.   Man! It is hot in here! That's one of the reasons I'm not getting much done, it's just too damn hot in the house. The A/C is cranked and it's still well over 80 in here, humid and stuffy. I don't feel much like doing anything except jumping into a nice cool swimming pool, which, unfortunately, I don't have, so I just sit on my fat ass and do very little.   I played guitar a bit today, but I cranked it too loud and now I have a massive headache. I believe the title of this post says it all.

         urlLink Wednesday What-If's     1. What if you had to choose between winning $10,000 cash or an all-expense paid vacation, to the location of your choice, worth the same amount?   At this point, I'd definitely have to take the cash, no matter how great a vacation $10,000 could buy. I needs the green!   2. What if you had to choose between backpacking around Europe for a month or spending a month in the Caribbean?   Backpacking around Europe seems much more interesting to me. The only thing is, I'd want someone to go backpacking with me. It wouldn't be much fun alone.   3. What if you were offered the opportunity to create your own vacation spot -- what would it be like?   4. What if you were offered the opportunity to create your own resort hotel -- what would it be like?   Question 3 and 4 are the same for me: an island resort, nice and secluded, with very few people there; just resort staff and a handful of guests. There's be a swimming pool trail that would run indoor and out, throughout the resort (almost like Venice), and be heated in some areas. You'd use the trail to get around the resort. There'd be jacuzzis in every room, lots of candles and plants, a fully loaded bar and refrigerator, and each room would have an automatic moonroof, where you could sleep under starlight if you wish. There'd be huge dinner buffets with all kinds of great food, and live music after dinner (well known acts). The beaches would be clean and clear, and each room would have it's own private beach area. There'd be palm trees and greenery everywhere, really tropical and lush. Man... I wish I had a place like that, I'd be there right now.    5. What if you were offered the chance to vacation on another planet with a few other contest winners -- would you accept?    Of course! It'd be such an honor, how could anyone even think about turning down such an offer?

Oh man, have I become the internet equivalent of the old lady in Vegas who sits in front of her slot machine all day?   Good lord.   I need to get off the PC and get something done... now!

         urlLink This-or-That Tuesday      Audience Potpourri Participation!    1) DVD or VHS?   I don't have a DVD player yet, but I prefer DVDs. Tapes are just bad; they tend to get damaged too easily.    2) Best Literary/Movie Villan: Voldemort (Harry Potter) or Sauron (LoTR)?   Neither, the best movie villain is Dr. Evil. However, the Lord Of The Rings villain is the better of the two I have to choose from.    3) Meat: rare or well-done?   More rare than well done for me please, but not totally rare.   4) High Speed Internet-Cable or DSL?   I've never used DSL so I have no idea if it's any better than cable.    5) Women: 1-piece bathing suit or Bikini?   I always thought bikinis were for slimmer people and one-pieces for heavier people, but I guess it depends on the woman and how comfortable she is with her body.     6) To be fair--Men: Boxers or briefs?   Briefs, but I like boxers too.   7) Beer or Liquor/Wine?   Most beer tastes like pissy swill, so definitely liquor/wine.   8) Coke or Mountain Dew?   I prefer several other soft drinks to either of them. Of the two, I'd be more likely to drink a Mountain Dew.    9) In honor of my 10/18/03 nuptials: Morning or Afternoon/Night Wedding?   Afternoon. Mornings suck! Besides, you don't want to be up too early or you'll get sleepy at night and that would take the fun out of the wedding night.    10) Carpet or Hardwood Floors?   I like them both. For comfort, carpeting is the way to go. For appearances, well, it really depends on the room.    11) American cars or foreign?   American cars are just fine.    12) Cutest TV Twin: Mary-Kate or Ashley Olsen?   Who cares? Wait until they're adults and then ask me.    13) Coffee: Caffeinated or Decaf?   Caffeinated, baby!   14) Thought-Provoking Question of the Week: Computers: Do they make life better or worse? Why?   They make life better, of course. For starters, any and all information you need is right there at your fingertips. You can talk to friends anywhere in the world for any amount of time and it costs nothing extra. There are online auctions where some great deals are to be found. You can meet new people. You can visit museums and galleries without ever leaving your chair. And on and on and on...

         urlLink Monday Mission     1. Have you ever been in a situation where you were worried sick about something/someone and your mind played out horrible outcomes? What was the situation and what did your imagination come up with? How did it all turn out?   Traffic on the roads here is pretty bad and there have been a few times when I was concerned that my Mom might've ben in an accident, nights when she wasn't home at a normal time and she hadn't said anything about going anywhere after work. Luckily, she's always made it home safely.    2. Are there any superstitions that you believe in, or just do out of habit? Do you feel like it makes a difference?   No way. I am anti-religion, so if I'm going to put down someone else's superstitions, it'd be hypocritical to have my own.   3. Spiders, mice, insects, blood, being home alone at night...some folks I know told me that those things really scare them. What frightens you?   Flying cockroaches make me run like a little girl. I'm not too fond of the non-flying sort either. And some spiders, the fast ones with the hairy legs... ick!   4. Has there ever been a time where you were too proud to ask for help? What was the situation, and did you ever finally ask?   Sure. I always refrained from asking my Dad for any monetary support. Even when I really needed some help, I didn't go to him. Now, my Mom, that's another story...   5. Have you ever had, or do you have In-Laws (or the non-marriage equivalent) that you just don't like or do things that drive you insane? What are some of the things they've done that almost drove you over the edge?   My brother-in-law always drove me crazy when he lived here with us, but since they all moved out, we get along a lot better. He used to loaf around the house all day with his Dad (a bigtime alcoholic) and a buddy of his, while my pregnant sister worked and went to school. He did some other  extremely  uncool things as well, but I won't get into all of that (letting sleeping dogs lie). Pretty much the main thing he does that pisses me off nowadays is he'll smoke around me, knowing it bothers me.   It's his brothers that bug me now. I hear things about them that really bother me. One of them, who currently lives with them and pays no bills there, steals from them (even from the kids) and is usually drunk. The other brother that bothers me, doesn't live with them anymore, but he used to, and he'd always be getting drunk around the kids. He even spit in my nephew's face once, when he got angry at him. Very uncool.    6. It has been said that you can tell how a man will treat his wife/girlfriend by watching how he treats his mother. Do you think that is true?   It might apply to guys who are looking to marry someone like their mothers, but that's not me. Me and my mother, we disagree on almost everything and argue about almost everything. We have a love/hate relationship if there ever was one. I wouldn't want to be in a situation like that with a wife/girlfriend. I'd want that relationship to be more about caring and love than about who's right or wrong about stupid, petty shit.    7. But then, there is the other extreme. Do you know any men that are just a little too close to their mothers? You know the kind, they won't make a decision on their own, can't do their own laundry and so on? How did that relationship work out for you? Any stories to tell?   Yes, I know men like that, in fact, my brother-in-law is like that. His relationship with his mother doesn't really affect me any. I may have to hear my sister bitch about it now and again, but that's it really.     8. What did you do last night after the sun went down?   See my previous entry: worked!   BONUS: Radio, what's new?   Nothing. It continues to suck ass.

        Work, Work, Work   Busy afternoon! After I ate lunch, I de-strung my acoutic guitar, cleaned it, re-strung it and tuned it (I discovered I need a fret job... bummer). After that, I went through a few boxes of cards and I pulled a bunch more to list. I pulled a bunch yesterday and set them aside for today, but I wasn't happy with the selection, so I grabbed some different ones. Then I scanned about 50 of them and spent the majority of the night listing them. I think I listed all of them except three, which I changed my mind about. I normally only do about 30 per night, but I was cooking tonight! Then, after the auctions were over, I had to send out winner's notices. I'm going to have a lot to ship this week, but that's fine, it means I'm finally getting some money in, which means I'm going to be able to pay my bills this month. Whew!  I was planning on putting my application in at the hardware store's post office tomorrow, but it doesn't look like I'm going to get there until Tuesday. I need to get a haircut sometime between now and then, and I need to do some laundry too. I don't have any clean pants to wear there. I'm not looking forward to the daily bus riding again though, but whatever. At least I'd be working. It's supposed to be around 20 hours a week, which kind of sucks, but then, is kind of cool too. I'd have time to continue looking for a better job, time to practice guitar/learn new songs, time to run auctions, and time to work on my newest project: a book.   I'm working on a humor book, and am about 10% done wiith it. I just need to come up with about 80 more hilarious ideas, a forward, and then I need to put them together in a readable form, and illustrate them. I also need to figure out how to get published. I know I will need a literary agent already, but I don't know if I'm supposed to copyright the material first or after I get the agent, or wait until I find a publisher. I will have to dome some bigtime research into all of this. 2003 is turning out to be a pretty productive year for me!

        Ch-Ch-Chia   I am now, officially, White Trash: I boughts me a Chia Head! Ok, so I didn't buy it because I thought it would look good in the living room or anything like that, I bought it to have something fun to do with my nephew when he comes down (hopefully to spend the week this week or next), so I'm not  totally  White Trash. Not yet, anyhow. By the way,  urlLink THIS  is the exact one I bought. I named him "Larry".   Mom and I went out to run errands this afternoon and we hit some thrift stores while we were out. I paid $2 for "Larry", who was still brand new in his box. I also bought three cassette tapes: U2 - "Rattle & Hum", Tracy Chapman - "Crossroads", and Bill Cosby - "Those of You With or Without Children, You'll Understand", which were $0.50 each. No really fantastic finds today. I saw a couple of books I wanted, but the stores had them overpriced, which pisses me off. They all get their "merchandise" for free, so why do some of them have to charge so much? For instance, there was a paperback edition of Anne Rice's "Lasher" for $4.99. The usual going price for that same book at Goodwill would be $0.75, and $3.00 for a hardback edition. You could say I'm fussing over nickels and dimes, being cheap, but for me, that's part of the fun of hitting those kinds of stores, the bargain hunting.   I also stopped by Music Mart and bought a pack of acoustic guitar strings while we were out. The G string on my acoustic is unraveling at the second fret, so I had to get some new ones. I must've had this set on for a very long time, because the brand I normally use (Guild Phosphor Bronze) doesn't appear to around anymore. I had to settle for D'Addarios. Eh. The guy had a problem with my debit card and ran it through a few times; I hope I didn't get overcharged. Must check that out....  My plans tonight are pretty boring: scan and list auctions on eBay. That's about it. I'll be starting that soon, by 7pm and will be going at it until about 11:30pm.   I would like to begin taking evening walks again too, now that I have a Walkman to use. I might do that after the auction stuff is finished. We shall see.

         urlLink Weekly Wrap-Up     Topic:  Physical Injury     1. Describe a childhood memory in which you sustained a physical injury. It doesn't have to be a serious injury, only one that you remember distinctly. What happened?   I remember when I was in elementary school, there was an elevated bar which I was supposed to run up to, jump, and grab. I ran up to it, jumped, and the next thing I know, I'm looking at clouds. I missed the bar and landed, hard, on my back. I had to go to the hospital and get X-rayed. I was stiff for awhile, but the pain eventually went away.    2. If that particular memory was not about your worst physical injury, what was/is? What made it so bad?   My worst physical injury involves my back again. I hurt my back at a job when I tried moving a very heavy skid with a palette jack that wasn't designed for that particular type of skid. Someone in the warehouse had used the wrong one, so when I went to pull it, I pulled it with my back rather than with the jack. I had to go to the doctors and missed a bit of work. Eventually I quit that job, but the back pain never fully went away and sometimes it flares up really bad (like now, for instance).    3. How well do you handle pain? Have you always had a high/low tolerance? If so, when did it change?   Ok, I guess. I mean, I go on living, dealing with it... what else can I do? I deal with it on an almost daily basis. I should be used to it by now, but it's still an aggravation to me. I think I handle actual pain better than I do the annoyance and inconveniences caused by the pain, not being able to do certain things, limited motion, stuff like that.   4. Do you take external medicines when you are hurt? Why or why not? Do you try/use alternative therapies? Why or why not?   Of course! Why suffer when there are products to help you get better or to suffer less? Never tried any alternate therapies though... I wouldn't know what to try.   5. Describe a time when you were hurt and it wasn't as serious as you thought. How did you feel before and after?   A couple of months ago I had a terrible, extreme, pain in my side that limited my movement and I was sure it was a kidney or my liver or something like that. After several days, the pain started lessening and eventually it went away. It was probably a puilled muscle. I was concerned, then relieved.

        The Friday Five    1. When was the last time you cheated?   I don't like cheating, in any form or for any reason. I'd rather win on my own merit, pass a test with my own intellect, and as far as relationships go, cheating is something I simply could not do. I mean, how could you ever face that person again, knowing that you'd betrayed their trust?   The last time that I actually did cheat on something was earlier this year, when I was playing a computer game (Beach Head 2000). I used a game cheat for unlimited life, to keep the game going; I didn't feel like starting over again and again, everytime I got "killed".    2. When was the last time you stole?   Ummm... about three months ago, when I was still working at Wendys. A chicken nugget here or there, a frosty once in a while, maybe a sandwich on the sly. I have no guilt about it whatsoever. They cheated on their food costs, so the little stuff here and there that employees too was no big deal.    3. When was the last time you lied?   I don't know. I really don't like lies and I hate lying to people. Pretty much the only reason I'd lie at all anymore is to protect someone's feelings.     4. When was the last time you broke or vandalized another's property?   About three months ago, at the Zebra concert, when I accidentally broke a chair. I was standing next to the chair I had been sitting in before the show started, and I put a foot up on the seat and it busted through. I don't know whether it was half-broken already or whether it was my doing, but either way, I didn't tell anyone about it. Being a fat guy, I didn't want the additional embarrassment.   5. When was the last time you hurt a loved one?   I try not to do that ever. I don't think I ever do it intentionally, but a few months ago, I did do it unintentionally, though I wasn't wrong in what I did. My nephew, Austin, who is five years old and very spoiled, tore my Mom's bedroom door off the hinges and I yelled at him over it. His mother, my sister, immediately jumped in with crap like "he doesn't know any better" and "it wasn't his fault". She made me look like a jerk for disciplining him, so he took it that I was being abusive towards him for no reason at all. For a long time afterward, he hated me, said I was "mean" and that I hurt his feelings. I'm sorry, but a five year old kid has no business doing anything that could tear down a bedroom door. I jumped on him because his mother didn't. If he had been my kid, he would've had an ass beating to go along with the yelling, so he'd remember never to do that again. But then, I'm "mean", so, whatever...

        This Election May Be Rigged/Vote Kucinich Anyway   OK, I had my Mom do the  urlLink political candidate test  (see the post below) and her #1 match was Kucinich too, which is incredibly unlikely since her politics are much different than mine. Is the test rigged so that Kucinich comes out #1 everytime? Has anyone had a different #1 selection?  Regardless, I looked over Kucinich's politics on  urlLink his website  and I have absolutely no doubt that he is the person we need to lead the country. He says things that the others wouldn't dare and he wants to change things the others wouldn't want changed (because it would affect their own financial interests). Here's what he says about Labor, for instance:  "Labor has stood almost alone while corporations have cut wages and benefits, slashed working hours, tried to undermine wage and hour provisions, reneged on contracts, and jettisoned retirements through bankruptcy strategies. The current clamor for corporate accountability calls for honesty in stating the numbers, and faithful custody of shareholders money.  Yet there needs to be equal concern for those who created the wealth through their labor because the attacks on unions are a means of redistributing the wealth upwards. As union membership has declined, the disparity of wealth has increased. Since 1973 union membership has dropped from 24% to 14%. And the share of aggregate income of the poor, the middle class and the upper middle class has declined. Congress has not passed an increase in the $5.15 minimum wage even though the inflation adjusted minimum wage is 21% lower today than in 1979.  Since 1981 the share of income of the richest 5% of this country has increased more than 40% while that of the lowest fifth has decreased more than 20%. An even starker contrast arises. According to Business Week, the average CEO made 42 times the average workers pay in 1980, 85 times in 1990 and 531 times in 2000. Forbes Magazine points out that the number of billionaires increased from 13 in 1982 to 149 in 1996."  Absolutely true. I've seen firsthand how corporations have more rights than their employees, how they use and abuse their employess. It's sickening how greedy and hoggish the corporate scum in this country have become, hoarding the majority of the wealth and giving their workers as little as possible. The fact that the average CEO today makes 531 times more than the average worker says it all. Spread the wealth you greedy fucks! Does money make you lose your humanity? Why not look out for your fellow man, rather than looking into how much you can screw him out of his share of the pie? That shit really pisses me off. It also bothers me that it doesn't piss most Americans off enough to do something about it. Not me. I went to Kucinich's site and offered my services. I'm going to do what I can to fight for what's right.

        The 2004 Election Results Are In!   I did a quiz today to see which 2004 presidential candidate most represents me and my ideals and here are the results:   1.  Kucinich, Cong. Dennis, OH - Democrat   (100%)    2.  Kerry, Senator John, MA - Democrat   (91%)    3.  Gephardt, Cong. Dick, MO - Democrat   (88%)    4.  Edwards, Senator John, NC - Democrat   (79%)    5.  Dean, Gov. Howard, VT - Democrat   (77%)    6.  Lieberman Senator Joe CT - Democrat   (76%)    7.  Moseley-Braun, Former Senator Carol IL - Democrat   (70%)    8.  Graham, Senator Bob, FL - Democrat   (70%)    9.  Sharpton, Reverend Al - Democrat   (57%)    10.  Libertarian Candidate   (26%)     11.  Bush, George W. - US President   (11%)    12.  Phillips, Howard - Constitution   (5%)    13.  LaRouche, Lyndon H. Jr. - Democrat   (0%)     Click  urlLink HERE  to see which one represents you the best.   I don't seem to agree with Bush much... no surprise there.   It was right on the money about Kucinich too. I don't know if  urlLink Dennis Kucinich  will get the nod, it's doubtful since he's not a middle-of-the-road type of politician and he doesn't have the wealth, power, resources or political-insider/interest group buddies that some of the others have, but I'm hoping he does get in... somehow. I think we need a progressive and human-oriented leader, now, more than ever.   I am going to  urlLink his site  right now to see what I can do to help.

         urlLink 3 for Thursday       Topic: Your City/Town    1. Where do you live?   Clearwater, Florida   2. What are 3 attractions/cool things about the city you live in?   1) Close to St. Petersburg and Tampa (bigger cities with more to do).  2) Lots of pawn shops and thrift stores. 3) It rains a lot in the summertime.   3. What are 3 things you want in your city that it doesnt have?   1) Seasons. Winter isn't much different than Fall, just a little colder, and Fall isn't much different from Spring.  2) Labor Unions. There is very little job security down here and a lot of companies skirt labor laws to save themselves a few bucks (like scheduling people to work 39 hours a week instead of 40, just so they don't have to give their employees any benefits). 3) A really good record store. Around here, it's tough trying to find CDs from bands that aren't mainstream. There is a Borders in St. Pete that has a decent selection, but there's a lot that they don't have too.   4. What are 3 natural things (mountains, lakes, etc.) in your area?   Well, developers have pretty much destroyed most of the natural beauty here, especially where I live. There used to be small wooded areas and farmlands, now it's strip malls, industries, and an Autoway lot.    1) The beaches. 2) Tampa Bay. 3) Clouds.   Bonus: What are the things you liked best/or disliked about the town you grew up? or If you lived in several places, what was your favorite place and why?    My main complaint about Clearwater has always been that it isn't anything like the place I originally came from... and adored. I came here from Pennsylvania, the Cochranville/Atglen area, and it was a wonderful place to live. It had woods, cornfields, creeks for fishing in, hills, snow, lightning bugs... a lot of natural beauty. Most of my relatives were there; grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, distant cousins, etc... The people there seemed more friendly and neighborly too. Here, I am surrounded by very little natural beauty, almost no relatives, and neighbors who don't care to associate with one another.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  I was listening to something the other day, forget what now. Oh, boy. I'm too young to be senile already, aren't I?   Watching on TV:  Back to my early evening pattern of watching "The Simspons", "Everybody Love Raymond", and "Seinfeld". I've also watched "Primetime Glick", " urlLink Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn ", "The Daily Show", "Trading Spaces", and "Band Of Brothers" this past week.   I finally got to see "Minority Report" last night too... wow! It was a little uneven in parts, but the special effects, the futuristic gadgets, the scenery/sets, and the action sequences, were all well worth watching. Tom Cruise was really good too. He played a police officer in "Pre-Crime", an idea which worked well for the film, and is a pretty frightening concept. The scene where the "spiders" enter into people's homes to get retina scans was especially scary, in an extremely Orwellian kind of way. I think it was the people's reaction to the "spiders" that really bothered me the most about them. I'd definitely recommend "Minority Report" to most people.    Downloading:  I've been downloading  urlLink Wilco  ("Yankee Hotel Foxtrot Demos"),  urlLink Loose Fur  (Jeff Tweedy's side project), Jay Bennett (formerly of Wilco) & Edward Burch ("My Darlin" is beautiful), The Minus 5, and some  urlLink Zebra  stuff from their second two albums that I hadn't heard in awhile ("Hard Living Without You" and "He's Making You The Fool" are as good as anything on their classic first album). I also found some live performances from Randy Jackson (Zebra's singer/guitarist) with him doing some Beatles and Led Zeppelin covers on a 12-string acoustic guitar ("A Day In The Life" and "Rain Song" are superb). I downloaded a few tracks from Donnie Iris too, an '80's one-hit wonder. He had a top 30 hit with "Ah! Leah!", which was kind of cool. I remembered hearing his "Love Is Like A Rock" before too, which wasn't as good.  Don't panic RIAA jerks: I didn't burn anything to disc, just giving them a listen. Florida radio, in my area anyway, is terrible. You won't hear  any  of the music that I downloaded on Florida radio. This is why I think the RIAA people are making a stupid mistake going after filesharers; I've discovered a lot of great music through filesharing, stuff I couldn't hear anywhere else, and I've bought a lot of it as a result. Sueing your customers is a stupid move, RIAA.   Playing:  I played  urlLink Bejeweled  a little, but it's gotten too annoying.  I have the trial version of the game downloaded, and it keeps track of how much you play it, and now that we've (me and Mom) played it a bunch of times, it keeps trying to get us to "register" the game, which is their way of saying "buy it". It costs $20 or something like that. No thanks. Other than a little of that, I haven't played anything other than my guitar.    Reading:  I started reading "It" the other night, got through page 1, and then put it down. I got very tired suddenly and just didn't feel like reading. I may pick it up again tonight.    Jamming:  Regular band practice has been called off this week (Santana's out of town and Jimmy can't make it this week), but me, Al, and JP are supposed to hook up tomorrow night over at JP's and go over some stuff, fine-tuning the songs we're working on.     Working:  Still nothing. Goodwill never called back. I may go job hunting again tomorrow, but I might be better off waiting until the kids go back to school. There just aren't many jobs in the paper or online that 1) appeal to me, or 2) I'm qualified to do.    Buying:  Nothing. I bid on a CD by Television (" urlLink Marquee Moon ") today, on eBay, but I lost it.     Eating:  Spaghetti and Meatballs... all frigging week. I don't want to see another meatball for as long as I live... or until I'm in the mood for Spaghetti and Meatballs again. We had pork loin tonight, which was killer.   I haven't been drinking much soda this week, a good thing, but I have been drinking a lot of coffee (I don't know if that's bad or good).    Feeling:  Physically: sore and tired. My lower back has been bothering me for awhile now. Too much sitting in front of the PC, I suppose. JP is going to let me borrow his Walkman cassette player tomorrow so I'm going to start taking walks at night again. That should help with my back some.    Mentally, I'm torn. On one hand, I really need a job and will likely take any old job I can to get the money rolling in again, but on the other hand, I can sustain myself selling basketball cards until I find a the job I really want. I have a lot of basketball cards I can continue selling on eBay and I'd like to get them cleared out of here, but I need a full-time job if I'm ever going to get ahead. I can't do both and play in a band. I don't know what to do.   Planning:  Planning on walking in the evenings, planning on playing out with my band soon, planning on getting a job, sooner or later. Finding love and happiness would be nice, but sadly, they're still not on my agenda.

        Funny Money   I found an interesting site (to me, anyways) while surfing today and I have to share it. It's a collection of drawn on, stamped, mutilated, and written on, U.S. currency. It was collected by the people who run a North Carolina burrito joint. I got a kick out of the creativity of some of them, especially the homemade Homer Simpson dollar bill and the "love ONE another" bill, but then, I'm easily amused. If you have a little time to waste, check it out  urlLink HERE . Enjoy!

        Down And Out in Dullsville   I just don't know what to do with myself. I sit in front of the PC repeatedly throughout the day, clicking on the same sites over and over again, not really doing anything at all. In between PC sessions, I eat, I play guitar, and at night, I may watch some TV. Other than this past weekend, when I listed some auctions on eBay, and last Thursday, when I practiced with the band, this has been my daily routine for a about two weeks now.   Boring!  Now, the guitar playing is good, I'm learning a bunch of cover songs to play with my band, but the rest of the day is almost entirely wasted time. Wasted  life . I need to get a job and I need to get a job very, very soon. Not just for the money, which I desperately need, but to help kill this continual boredom as well.   I'm bored shitless.   It's been rainy here, off and on, it's hard to tell what the weather is going to be like from one moment to the next. One minute it is extremely hot, in the 90's, the next it is pouring down rain. Sometimes, I'll look outside and on the right side of my home it is sunny and on the left side it is raining. Florida weather is weird. So... I haven't done anything outside, just been stuck inside the house day in and day out. Hence the boring daily routine.   Dull, dull, dull.   My lower back has been killing me for awhile now too, probably from all of the sitting I do. Too much PC. Like I said, sometimes I just sit there and click on the same things over and over again, like I'm missing something.   I am in need of a life.  On the positive side (and I try like hell to find a positive side), I am playing in a band, I am learning songs so we can begin playing out, I have money due in from the eBay auctions, I am learning new things on the PC all the time, and I'm constantly finding humor, intelligence and creativity online. I'm constantly surprised, amused, and inspired by "online people", through their blogs, websites, and newsgroup posts. I wish I had more of it around in "real life".

         urlLink This-or-That Tuesday      Topic: cartoons    1. Bugs Bunny or Daffy Duck?   Bugs is cooler, but Daffy makes me laugh. I get a kick out of him running around like an idiot going "woo-hoo! woo-hoo!"   2. Tom or Jerry? 3. Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck? 4. Rocky & Bullwinkle or Boris & Natasha?   I don't really care much for any of these. I'm not much of a cartoon watcher.  I've always enjoyed the Looney Tunes though.    5. Road Runner or Wile E. Coyote?   Easy one: Wile E. Coyote. He's like a genius, only not. The Road Runner is just plain annoying.    6. Sylvester or Tweety?   Tweety is as annoying as the Road Runner, if not more so, with his big yellow noggin', so Sylvester is definitely my choice.   7. Popeye or Bluto?   Neither, I like Wimpy ("I'll gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today").    8. South Park or The Simpsons?   The Simpsons! The greatest cartoon sitcom ever. South Park is great, but Homer J. Simpson reigns supreme. D'oh!   9. Jetsons or Flintstones?   I've never really bothered with the Jetsons, so I'll go with the Flintstones. However, I'd rather watch the Honeymooners, the show the Flintstones ripped off.    10. And finally, the eternal question asked by all good Scooby-Doo fans: Velma or Daphne?   I thought I had no life, but if there are people actually debating  that  question, then I'm not so bad off.   Besides, it's no contest: Daphne was a fox.  (Don't panic friends, I'm just joking about that.)   (Or am I? Hmmm........)

         urlLink Monday Madness     1. Have you ever attended a concert? If so, who; and how old were you when you attended your first concert?   I've seen The Stray Cats, Gregg Allman, Stevie Ray Vaughan (twice), Jeff Beck, Neil Young, Sonic Youth, Bob Dylan, Jason & The Scorchers, Eric Clapton, BB King, John Prine, Lyle Lovett, Wilco, The Jayhawks, Los Lobos (three times), Zebra, Ben Harper, and Crosby, Stills, and Nash (among others).  My first concert was Sha Na Na (stop laughing). I must've been around 8 or 9 years old at the time.   One of these days I'm going to make a more detailed list of them (with dates and songs played) since I found setlists for many of them on the internet. I also found that many of the shows had been recorded and are available on CD (bootlegs). I think it'd be neat to hear them again. I still have my ticket stubs for almost all of the shows.   2. What is the biggest ride or rollercoaster that you've ever been on? Were you frightened to go on it?    I've only been on two rollercoasters, both at Disney World: Space Mountain and Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. I don't know whether Space Mountain is the bigger of the two, but it's my favorite one (I have fond memories of riding it with a girl I really adored).   3. Is there an annual 'festival' that you make sure you never miss? If so, please tell about it; if not, is there any annual event that you like to attend?    No, not really. The Renaissance Fair comes around every year, and I always want to go there, but so far, I've never gone.

        Still Productive, No Longer Bored   These titles... I'm such a dork, and I know it. It's true though: I am not bored.   I am sleepy.   I just got done listing more cards on eBay, I listed 72 auctions in three days. Hopefully, they'll pay my bills this month. I need money bad. I need at least $85 this coming week, at least $75 the week after, and anything extra (riiiight) is owed to Mom, JP, and the guy who sent me his Ben Harper tickets. I've only sent him $25 so far, I plan on sending him another $20-$25 as soon as I can. Besides all of that, I need to buy and amplifier and a second electric guitar within the next month or so. I will need them when we start playing out. Needless to say, I need a job.   No word from Goodwill yet. I guess I'd better keep looking.   I talked with my old Wendys manager, Barry, tonight. He's a good guy. He called me out of the blue earlier in the week so I called him as soon as I knew he'd be working. He just wanted to shoot the shit. We mostly talked about about basketball and about how everyone was doing. I was sure he was going to ask me to come back, but he didn't. However, he did mention that they lost a few employees and are losing another one next week (a hint?). I'm glad he didn't ask though; at this point, with my financial situation being what it is, I probably would have settled again and went back to Wendys. I want to do something better this time, something I'd enjoy doing.   Good thing I have the music thing going, or I'd be going crazy. I worked on cover songs almost all day today, figuring out a bunch of songs by ear and with sheet music/tablature.  I guess I'm heading for bed now, my back is killing me (still), and as I mentioned before, I am quite sleepy.   You know, I never did start reading "It" last night. I don't think I'll be starting it tonight either.   Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz......

        Bored, But Productive   I'm bored to death now, but I had a pretty productive day today, for me anyhow. I got up around 9am today, and started working on learning cover songs, playing along with the mix CD that JP had put together for us. To my surprise, I discovered that he had added a handful of newer songs on to the list of covers we're supposed to learn, newer stuff, most of which I'd never heard before. We'd never discussed these new songs at all. I didn't like Jason Mraz's "The Remedy" (too busy) or Matchbox 20's "Unwell" (kind of bland, boring), but I did like the songs from Jack Johnson ("Let It Go") & Train ("Calling All Angels"), though I'm not sure we could pull off the Jack Johnson song. For one thing, Ben Harper plays slide guitar on it at the end and there's no way I could pull that off; Ben's too damn good. Also, there isn't a lot of instrumentation in the song, which would leave a lot of us standing around twiddling our thumbs (we are a sextet right now). Anyway, I worked on learning a ton of cover songs today, played for a couple of hours, and then I sat at the PC and looked up tablature/sheet music for a bunch of other cover songs, stuff I'd like to cover, stuff I think the band could pull off well. Some of the songs I'd like to try are "Bertha" (the Los Lobos version of the Grateful Dead song), "One Time, One Night" (Los Lobos"), "Alone" and Steal My Kisses" (two Ben Harper songs), "32-20 Blues" (Robert Johnson), "Hey Hey What Can I Do" (Led Zeppelin), "What's So Funny About Peace, Love and Understanding" (Elvis Costello), and "She's Tight" (Cheap Trick). I would really like to learn Cheap Trick's "Reach Out " too (I've never seen anyone cover that one), but I couldn't find any music for it. I'll have to learn it by ear. So anyway, I did that pretty much all afternoon. Later on, I scanned a bunch of basketball cards and listed them on eBay. I was interrupted by a phone call from JP, who was returning my call from earlier in the day. I had worked on my solo for his "Promise You The Moon", extended it and cleaned it up, and I wanted him to hear it. He really didn't say much, so I'm not sure what he thought about it. We talked about music and the band for awhile. After we hung up, I went back to listing cards, finishing up around 10:30pm, and leaving me bored shitless. There isn't jack on TV (I had missed "Minority Report" while I was listing cards) and it's too late to practice songs (Mom's in bed), and I've checked all of my usual internet haunts, and now I'm bored to death. Maybe I'll read something. I've been wanting to start on "It" (the Stephen King book), maybe I'll do that tonight. Then again, I should probably just go to bed.   Hasta la vista, baby.  I'm out like Grandma's teeth.

         urlLink The Weekly Wrapup     Stormy Weather    1. Do you like stormy weather? Why or why not?   I love it. It's very soothing to me. Thunderstorms have a way of bringing things back down to Earth, of reminding me that I'm part of it all, part of the world, part of nature. Plus, the power of nature is awesome to behold.    2. What do you do when a storm breaks in the middle of the night?   If I'm up, I will usually grab my guitar and sit out on the screened porch, watching the storm and strumming along with it. If I'm in bed, I will usually lay there and try to enjoy it before I fall asleep.   3. When you were a child, where did you think the thunder and lightning came from?   From the sky, the clouds. I don't know that I really gave it much thought though.    4. Describe your favorite and/or worst stormy memory.   One of my favorite storm memories was when me and my sister played out in a hurricane. I can't remember which one, it was back in the mid '80's, I think. Anyways, it was  pouring , we were completely drenched, and the wind was nearly lifting us off our feet. It was awsome!   The worst was  urlLink the tornado that hit our elementary school , killing a few children and destroying the school. I didn't like stormy weather for a long while after that, but I learned to love it again.

         urlLink The Friday Five     1. Do you remember your first best friend? Who was it?   Sure, it was my cousin, Andy. We were born within a couple months of each other. We were the first grandchildren in the family.    2. Are you still in touch with this person?   No, unfortunately. With him in Pennsylvania and me in Florida, we lost contact before our teen years and never got back in touch. Just too many miles and years between us now.    3. Do you have a current close friend?   I have two. I talk with Sue more often, but I do more stuff with JP.    4. How did you become friends with this person?   I worked as a temp with Sue, and JP was my best friend growing up (he lived on the next street from me).   5. Is there a friend from your past that you wish you were still in contact with? Why?   I had a friend, Ed, who I loved hanging with. He was a musician too (I never thought about it before, but  all  of my friends are/were musicians). I used to hang out over at his place a lot. They, him and his roomate, my friend Scott, had their place set up with amps, P.A, and drums, right in their living room (we called their place "Scott & Ed's Rock Palace"). We used to jam all the time. Ed would also come over here and watch "Kids In The Hall" with me, almost every week, which was fun. We'd laugh our asses off. Unfortunately, he betrayed Scott, sending him to prison. Scott had an outstanding warrant on him (he violated his probation, traffic stuff) and Ed turned him in to the police at his girlfriend's urging. See, Ed's girlfriend used to date Scott and after they broke up, she started hating him (it was mutual, I guess). Ed and Scott had been best friends for as long as I've known them, they were like brothers, so it was a  huge  betrayal. I was shocked. We all were. I couldn't believe Ed had done that. It was unthinkable, and unforgivable. I haven't spoken to Ed since.

        Lately I've Been...    Listening to:  I had my Dave Attel "Skanks For The Memories" CD on yesterday and I listened to my "new" Van Halen (first album) cassette today.   Watching on TV:  I really haven't been able to sit through much TV  lately. I'll start watching a show and then I'll lose interest and go play guitar or play on the computer or something.     Downloading:  I downloaded a couple of versions of "Feelin' Alright" (Traffic & Dave Mason), to compare them with the Joe Cocker version that JP put on the CD of covers for the band to listen to.   Playing:  No games, just playing guitar.     Reading:  Nothing at the moment.   Jamming:  We practiced tonight, Al, Jimmy, Santana, Ronnie, JP, and me. We played about 3 1/2 hours, til about 10:30pm. It was  really  hot there tonight, even with the a/c cranking we were sweating our asses off. My fingers kept getting sticky and I had to do "the dirt trick" on them again to dry them off. I need to bring some talcum powder next time. Still, I kept on playing, almost non-stop. Me and JP wound up working on songs while the others went for cigarette breaks. Before one break, I debuted my funky version of "Stuck In The Middle". I got the feeling the others didn't like it, but to my surprise, JP liked it a lot. He said he'd like to keep doing my version. We ran through a whole bunch of covers: "Before You Accuse Me", "Can't You See", "Feelin' Alright", "Oye Como Va", "Sunshine Of Your Love", "Stuck In The Middle", "Wild Night", "Low Rider"," The Way", "Wonderful Tonight", "You May Be Right", "Crazy Little Thing Called Love", I Got Loaded", "If It Makes You Happy", "Little Wing", "One" (the U2 song), and "Blister In The Sun". Ronnie wasn't in very good spirits tonight, kind of out of it. He'd worked out in the sun all day today and just wasn't into jamming tonight. He wound up splitting early, so I  still  haven't gotten to play "Little Wing" with him on it. He hadn't learned "I Got Loaded" yet either, and then JP had trouble singing in key on that one, so we changed keys three times. It doesn't look good for that song, which is too bad. "Oye Como Va" is a bit disorganized, and "If It Makes You Happy" seemed to drag on, we need to play it a little more uptempo.  We did a few originals too: "Had A Girl" (which sounded really cool after I added some cello-sounding guitar lines to it), "Promise You The Moon" (I blanked out and forgot all of my lead lines on this one), "At Night" (which is now called "Sleep Forever"), and I had Al show me how to play "Find My Way" and we jammed on it a bit. We did Santana's "Subway Joe" again too.  I think it was an ok jam tonight, not great, but ok. We still need a lot of fine-tuning. Oh, and I couldn't tape tonight! Santana took the recorder home. D'oh!     Working:   I put an application in at Goodwill (Gandy) today and tried to put one in at Olsten Staffing, but Olsten gave me the runaround. One lady was trying to find me an application and I told her I couldn't do heavy lifting because of my back so she started suggesting some things I could do. She went in the back and a few minutes later, another lady came out and told me she "wouldn't feel comfortable" putting me on a job since all of the jobs require lifting "25 pounds or more", which is a fucking lie. They hire people to do hand-assembly work, including the elderly, so I'm sure I could have done  something . I had worked for Olsten for over two years before and I left on good terms with them... you'd think that might have meant something to them, but it didn't. Assholes.    Buying:  While I was at Goodwill, I spent the last few dollars I had in my checking account and bought 10 cassette tapes for $0.50 each and three paperback books for $0.75 each. I also picked up a watermelon scented candle. The tapes I got were Van Halen (the first album), Van Halen "1984", Stevie Ray Vaughan "Greatest Hits", the Vaughan Brothers "Family Style", The Black Crowes "The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion", the Allman Brothers Band "2nd Set", Eric Clapton "From The Cradle", "ZZ Top "Greatest Hits", Iron Maiden "Somewhere In Time", and Guns 'N' Roses "Use Your Illusion I". All of the tape cases looked shitty, but the tapes and the j-cards inside them looked nice, some brand new. I put new cases on them when I got home. Sweet! The three books I bought were "Moby Dick" (I've never read it), "Interview With The Vampire" (I've read this before, but the book was in nice shape), and "SeinLanguage" (I have the hardback, but I wanted a paperback to enjoy anywhere).      Eating:  I had Stouffer's Fish Filet with Macaroni & Cheese a couple times this past week, a couple Boston Market Teriyaki TV dinners too. I had ham, potatoes, & green beans a couple times, with some cornbread even. I made breakfast yesterday and had eggs and kielbasa. I had a Bacon McGriddle for breakfast this morning (the one McDonalds owed us from Sunday) and it wasn't as bad as the greasy sausage McGriddle. Still, I don't think I'll order either of them again. I haven't been snacking much. Still drinking too much soda, but less than I have the last few weeks.     Feeling:  Physically: tired and sore. My lower back is inflamed still and I got maybe three hours of sleep last night. Not a great combo. Mentally, I am worried about money again. The bills are coming in and need to be paid. I had hoped I could just go to Olsten and be working on Monday. Assholes.   Planning:  I am planning on getting a job as soon as possible. That's my main focus right now.

         urlLink 3 For Thursday     Topic: pets    1. Have you ever had pets? If so, name 3 (names and/or types) that youve had. (Pet rocks do not count).    My first pet that I can remember was a bunny rabbit named "Charlie", whom I had as a toddler back in Pennsylvania. I still remember feeding him veggies. I've had scores of cats through the years, my favorite of all being Fluffy, who, sadly, died last year of a stroke. I'd had him for more than ten years. He was a good little boy, the most lovable cat you'd ever meet. I had another die on me, Puggy, who was still a little kitten when he died. We had to put him to sleep as he had stomach tumors, cancerous, I believe. I also had a dog growing up, a little mutt named Buster, who me and my sister used to fight over. He was a nut. He'd become "Crazy Dog" if me and my sister goaded him enough, and he'd run like a maniac all over the place, jumping on furniture, zipping up and down the hallway, basically going nuts. When he got older he developed arthritis and dry skin, started losing hair, and was kind of forgotten about, which I still feel bad about. He was a good dog who deserved better, you know?    2. What are 3 things you love or hate about pets?    Love: 1) Companionship 2) They're cute, soft and cuddly 3) Fun to play with  Hate: 1) They die 2) Fleas 3) Dookie    3. What are 3 types of pets that youd never have?    I wouldn't want a snake. They're too damn boring. I wouldn't want a tarantula as a pet either. Ick! Also, some folks have pigs for pets and I wouldn't want one of them. Can you imagine having to clean up pigshit off your carpet? Double ick!   BONUS: If your pet had to have expensive surgery or lifetime shots (like insulin for a diabetic animal) would you put your pet through it, or make the hard decision to put them to sleep?    We've had to put a few animals to sleep. It's really rough, but sometimes there's no other way. You don't want your pet to suffer, to live in constant pain. If there's a way to keep them around, where they wouldn't be in pain, and could live normal lives, then that's always the first option. Believe me, if I could have saved Fluffy after he had his stroke, I would have done whatever it took to keep him alive and well. You just don't abandon a pet merely because he's old or ill.

        The Heat Is On   My stupid lower back is killing me again, and has been for the past few days. It got so bad yesterday, that around 1pm or 2pm, I just had to go lay down. I wound up staying down for much longer than I'd anticipated, til 11pm. The heat in the house isn't helping me any either. It's been in the 90's here, even in the house, with the A/C blasting away. I got up before 7am this morning, and I managed to stay out of bed all day. I had the heating pad on my back for awhile and I popped several Aleves, which helped to ease the pain a bit. The heat is still kicking my ass though. Ugh!   On a positive note, It looks like I'm getting my sleeping habit normalized again. I was up at 9:30am yesterday, before 7am today, so I hope to go job hunting tomorrow. I have band practice tomorrow night too, so it looks like Thursday should be a busy day for me. I just hope my back problems will have disappeared, or at least, lessened, by then.  The last few days, I've been practicing the new cover songs we're supposed to be playing tomorrow, playing along with the mix CD that JP made. I don't think "Rock This Town" is going to work with me on guitar; Rockabilly just isn't my style. Also, "Go Your Own Way" may or may not work. JP said they played it before, so I'll see how it sounds with a second guitar. "I Got Loaded" should turn out real well, especially if Ronnie learned his sax parts (Ronnie is supposed to be there this time). "Low Rider" might not work out so well. JP said he was going to learn the riff on harmonica, but I'd bet anything he hasn't done that. I learned the riff on guitar, so maybe we could double up the line with his guitar... we'll see how that one goes. Also, Al and JP have been playing the bridge to "My Old Apartment" wrong and they taught me the wrong way to play it as well. I think I figured the right changes out, so I'll throw it in at practice if we do that one. JP won't be happy. JP thinks just because they had good audience receptions to the songs before, there's no reason to change things now. I'd prefer we did it right. I don't necessarily think we should stick to the same sound, I'm all for doing our own thing, but I do think the correct changes should be intact. I have to show them the right changes for the solo part to "Crazy Little Thing Called Love" as well. They've been playing that one wrong for awhile now too. I don't know about those guys. I wonder sometimes whether they're lazy or deaf. They don't seem to put much into learning songs. I also worked out a very funky version of "Stuck In The Middle", but I just know they won't like it. It'll be an interesting practice, that's for sure. Plus, like I said, Ronnie should be there tomorrow, so hopefully we'll get some actual jamming in, which I love doing. I should bring some blank tapes along to record it. I've been wanting to do that for awhile now.

        Underachiever Blues    I just finished taking the Classical Intelligence Test (Revised) at   urlLink PsychTests.com   and it gave me an IQ of 126. It said that I am smarter than the average person. This is a relief, because as I've gotten older, I was sure I was getting dumber. But it's also a reminder of how little I've accomplished with my life. It also said I should have no problem succeeding in academics or in life in general, but here I am, unemployed, in debt, with success nowhere in sight. I'm smarter than the average person, but I'm not doing as well in life as most of them. There are probably a lot of very stupid people who are making more out of their lives than I am with mine. So what does it all mean? I think it means that it takes more than intelligence to succeed in life. Whatever it takes, I seem to be missing it, so how smart can I really be? It's funny how little 126 means in the light of day, here in the real world.

         urlLink This-or-That Tuesday     1. Strawberries or blueberries?   I eat strawberries much more than blueberries, don't know which I prefer. I guess it depends on how they're used. I'll take a blueberry pie over a strawberry one, but I'll take a strawberry milkshake over a blueberry one. Just raw, on their own, probably strawberries.   2. "Legally Blonde 2" or "Terminator 3"?   Reese Witherspoon is much easier on the eyes than Arnold is, but I'd much rather watch "Terminator 3". I'm looking forward to seeing it sometime soon.    3. Hamburgers or hot dogs?   I like them both, especially grilled, but I'll usually choose hamburgers over hot dogs. I love a good Chicago dog though.   4. Boating or hiking?   I like hiking, as a concept, but I've never really done it. I would like being out in nature, it'd be relaxing, and it could be really fun if I went with someone I liked a lot. But, there's the heat factor and the sore feet factor to consider as well. My Dad made me scared of boating when I was younger, but I have gone on a cruise since then and enjoyed it a great deal. Small boats are iffy with me, bigger ones are cool though, and I love the seabreeze. This one is a toss-up.   5. Suntan lotion or sunblock?   I didn't realize there was any difference. I'm not a beach person at all, not much of an outdoorsman. I have no idea.   6. "Big Brother" or "The Amazing Race"?   And these are....? I think they might be reality TV shows, but I'm not sure. I don't watch either, if that's what they are.    7. Beach Boys or Jimmy Buffett?   I usually don't listen to either, but I think Brian Wilson is a musical genius. I would definitely choose Brian Wilson-era Beach Boys over Buffet, but I'd probably choose Buffet over non-Brian Wilson Beach Boys.   8. Grow your own produce or buy from supermarket/greengrocer/farm stand?   I would absolutely love to be able to grow my own veggies. My grandfather, up in Pennsylvania, does that , out in his backyard garden.  For now though, it's the supermarket/greengrocer/farm stand.   9. Drive with car windows/top down, or with air-conditioning on?   Depends on the weather, doesn't it? Down here in Florida, it's usually pretty hot out, or else it's rainy, so most of the time I just use the a/c.    10. Go away for vacation, or stay at home?   I would love to go away for a vacation. I'm home too damned much already and quite tired of it.

        "D.A., Meet The D.A."    I am shocked, saddened, and disappointed. My favorite NBA player, Darrell Armstrong, the heart & soul of my favorite team, the Orlando Magic, was arrested last night for assaulting a female police officer. *Sigh*  Darrell has always been one of the "good guys" in the league, participating in scores of charity and community events off the court, and giving everything he's got while on the court. He's one of the hardest working players in the NBA. He was a superb role model and he was probably the last NBA'er I'd expect to see on a police blotter. And yet,  urlLink here he is . From reading the arrest report it looks like it was a nothing little incident that just got blown out of proportion in the heat of the moment. He's always been a very emotional player, I've seen him cry after tough losses, and it looks like his emotion may have gotten the best of him this time out.   I understand that everybody makes mistakes, I'm not writing D.A. off as a human being or anything, but if he did what he is accused of, then his days as a role model are over, and that's unfortunate because he was a great one, one of the best.  Two other arrests have been made on NBA players in the last two days, one very surprising and one not surprising at all. The first, Kobe Bryant, was arrested on a sexual assualt charge, which seems very unlikely knowing Kobe's demeanor and upbringing. He says the charges are "bogus' and I hope they truly are. The other player that got busted is Damon Stoudemire, arrested on drug charges... again. He's been up on drug charges twice before. He lucked out the last time, when the evidence was thrown out due to illegal search and seizure, but this time the idiot tried taking his weed aboard an airplane.

         urlLink Monday Mission       1. Can you think of one single decision you made that changed the course of your life. A decision where if you had done something else, everything would be different now?   I can think of two extremely important decisions I made, less than 20 seconds apart, that, had I not made the choices I did, would have changed my life significantly. In fact, my life would most likely have ended. One night, the restaurant where I was working had just closed and I was in the back cleaning up when I heard a loud crack, glass shattering, and frantic shouting. I ran up to the front to see what was going on and as soon as I came through the swinging door I saw. Charles, our dishwasher (an exchange student from Nigeria) was slowly going down to the floor, dropping the glass plates he was carrying as he when down. I noticed blood pouring from his ear, the one that faced me. I think I started to ask "what happened" before I understood the situation. I saw my manager with his hands up, panicking (I saw real fear in his eyes), I saw an arm over the counter with a gun in it, I saw my co-workers behind the counter (including my sister) and I knew what had just happened. I sized up the situation and made for the back exit before the gunman had time to think about what to do with me. One of the police officers later told me that she was sure the gunman would have shot me (he had murdered several people already, during other robberies). I had made the right decision to head for the back exit. Almost as soon as I started running for the back door, I'd remembered that I saw a car pull up in the back parking lot about 10 minutes before, so I ran for the freezer instead. My gut reaction was "don't go out back". That saved my life as well. As I learned at the trial, the gunman had a partner and he was waiting out back. Two quick decisions, less than 20 seconds apart, not only changed my life, but saved my life as well.    2. Or maybe you think "the fates" have it all planned out for us. Do you think every life has a pre-determined course, that we will wind up at point X regardless of the decisions we make?    Who knows, all I can tell you is that I don't feel like a puppet attached to some cosmic string. Life feels random. But I can't rule out anything. It'd be close-minded and arrogant of me to totally dismiss fate and destiny altogether. I don't believe in God, the biblical God, but I haven't ruled out a higher power altogether. We don't know everything, we're but a small speck in a massive universe; all of our learning, our knowledge, our science, may just be a tiny glimpse into what is real. After all, we have a limited perspective, no?   3. Do you think that it is that left up to us and random chance to decide who we are with? Are we are guided to the person we were meant to be with or could you be with the wrong person while "the one" is still somewhere out there?   They say that there is someone for everyone, but so far, there's been no one for me. I don't go out very much, never have really, and that, among other things, has cut down on my chances of meeting someone. Meeting people is random, the right place at the right time. No one has knocked on my door guided by destiny.    4. Do you like to drink and get drunk? When was the last time you were drunk or hung over? What was the occasion? How did it feel at the time? How did it feel the next day?   I enjoy a drink now and then, but I don't like being totally drunk. I used to drink a lot, back before I turned 21. One night, I drank so much that I passed out the moment I hit my bed. I woke up the next morning, fully dressed still, and covered in vomit. I had thrown up while asleep, which could have killed me had I not been sleeping on my side. I was shocked and angry. That was the end of heavy drinking for me. Nowadays, I'll drink in moderation, I'll get buzzed, but I never get totally shitfaced anymore. I liked the freedom from inhibitions that being really drunk provides, but I hated the hangovers and the loss of control. I like to be in control of my faculties.    5. On the same topic, have you ever done anything you regret while "under the influence?" What happened? Do you remember it or did you have to be told?   Hmmmm... I don't know. When I got wasted, I normally wasn't mean or anything, just silly. I remember being told that people had to walk me home before, which I didn't remember. Apparently, I was so drunk I couldn't even stand up straight or walk more than a step or two. Oh! Wait! I regret getting my stupid "Cheri" tattoo. Had I been sober, I would not have 1) started it, or 2) let my brother-in-law finish it (I'd passed out).   6. Were you/are you able to resist peer pressure in school/college? How? If not, what did you do that you wish you hadn't?   Anything I did I did because I wanted to, not because of peer pressure. I've always been my own person. I've never really done things to "fit in" or because someone else said I should. I've turned down drinks and drugs on many, many occasions.    7. What things are better left unsaid?   Things that will unnecessarily hurt someone's feelings.    BONUS: Isn't this world a crazy place?    It's crazy! Crazy! Craaaazy! Everything must go!!

        The McGriddle = McGross   I just had to try McDonald's new McGriddle sandwich, and this morning, I finally did... unfortunately. It just doesn't work for me, not at all. After a few bites, I began tearing it apart and eating the ingredients separately. I wanted to try one of each, the sausage and the bacon, but they screwed up at McDonalds and gave me two sausage ones, which are especially greasy. I finished eating them about 30 minutes ago and I still feel queasy. I feel like puking. Way to go McDonalds.

        I... Am... Spent!   Wow. Yesterday was quite eventful. I started my day around 3:30pm, getting out of bed after having slept very little. I'm not sure that I slept at all, actually. I shaved and showered and got dressed and soon afterwards, my sister and her three kids came down.   They were having some 4th of July stuff going on up at my neighborhood's Rec Hall (free food, some games) so me, my Mom, and the three kids went up there. The first thing I noticed when we got there is that the people around here, though nice people, really are a strange looking, Jerry Springerish, lot. The boys threw darts at balloons on a board and won some crappy prizes, they took individual rides on a go-kart-type vehicle driven by some pre-pubescent freckled girl, and then Jesse, the older boy threw baseballs at the dunk tank, dropping a friend of my Mom's into the water while she was taunting him. My niece didn't do anything, just sat down and watched. I took her over to get some food and we stood around under the large tarpaulin tent that covered the grill and the food tables and we ate our food. Not long after that, it started raining.   It was pouring down hard, complete with thunder, lightning, and huge wind gusts that threated to topple the tarp. It actually lifted it up a few times, so we a bunch of us had to physically hold it down. I had one of the ends and the rain was soaking me. A few times, I had to put all of my weight and strength into it to keep it down! My little nephew, Austin, started acting like a crybaby (my niece is afraid of everything and she gets him worked up too) and I started arguing with him while I was trying to keep the food tent from flying away. Eventually, my Mom went out in the rain and brought the car around and took the kids home. I couldn't leave yet because it was just me and three women on my side and I was the main person holding our side down. I guess I could've just said "See ya!", and gone home too, but I didn't. I waited until my Mom came back, and then I waited until some guy came over and replaced me. I didn't mind helping out, but I was pissed off because I missed my chance to talk to a cute girl I used to work with at Wendys.   After we got home, we had dinner. I had just had a burger at the Rec Hall, so I didn't eat much. Me and my niece had Taco sald, and the others had Chicken Cordon Bleu with Stouffer's Mac & Cheese.   After dinner, I took the boys outside and we played catch with the mini-football. Austin lost interest and found something else to do, and me and Jess threw the ball around for long time, even after it started raining again.   Since it wasn't lightning anymore, I thought of something we could do in the rain: I had them build a dam in our gutter, out front, along the road. They loved it! All three of us were grabbing dirt, rocks, and grass, anything we could find, to hold the water back. The water kept busting over the top or around the sides, so I grabbed some bricks and reinforced the dam for them. It held up well. In fact, it lasted all night long and is still there, holding water tonight. Austin enjoyed it so much, he even built a second dam about 10 feet behind the first one.   While it were building the dams, it had grown dark and fireworks were going off all round us. The kids had brought a bunch of fireworks with them, so it wasn't long before we broke them out. They had some really cool ones: roman candles, jumping jacks, firecrackers, and a bunch of large ones that shot up in the air. I had never really done fireworks before. When I was a kid, my Moms idea of "fireworks" was a box of sparklers, and as an adult, I never really had the urge to do them. I got the hang of it pretty quickly and I set them all off without any problem. It was a lot of fun. I even let Jess light some off. Between us, and the guy down at the other end of our street, it looked like war zone, and sounded like it too. The smoke in the air was thick. It was surreal. The boys had a ton of jumping jacks with them, so we took the inside and untangled them, put them in a bowl and went back out to set them off. These work well when you throw them up in the air, sometimes they zoom off in a stream of smoke, so I was lighting them for the boys and they got to throw them. Austin went in after a bit, but Jess and I continued til after Midnight. It it weren't for the stupid mosquitoes, it would have been a totally enjoyable night. Those suckers bit us up!  Inside, we all sat around my Mom's room talking and laughing at each other for a long while before everyone went off to sleep. Everyone but me, that is. I was up til 5am (I found some  very interesting  facts about President Bush and his family), and then after I went to bed, I couldn't sleep. My muscles felt strained, probably from holding down that food tent, my feet were sore from all of the standing I had been doing, and I just couldn't get comfortable. I got up for around 11:30am to take some Aleve, stayed up for awhile watchiong "Changing Rooms", and then went back to bed around 1pm. I was down until almost 8pm tonight. I slept some, but I still feel really tired.

        Independance Day   Today is the 227th anniversary of our nation's independance from England. This should be a day of national celebration, national pride, but this year, I'm feeling neither celabratory, nor prideful.   We lost 2,795 people in the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001. Spurred on by revenge, fear, paranoia, and to a small degree, the search for justice, President Bush employed our military in both Afgahnistan and Iraq, killing well over 7,000 civilians in these two countries. That's a conservative figure. It could be well over 10,000 civilians deaths due to U.S. bombing of these countries. This number includes men, women, and children. Our bombs weren't discriminatory. The numbers for non-civilian deaths in these countries is well over 11,000, and could possibly be twice that amount.   What possible justification could there be for us wiping out so many human lives?   Finding Osama Bin Laden? We still haven't found him. Finding Iraq's "weapons of mass destruction"? Damn! Apparently, we're the only ones with weapons of mass destruction over there! Oops! We accomplished neither of the things the President told us we were over there fighting for ... so how about ... ummm ... giving freedom to the people? Yeah! That'll work! We gave the people freedom, from the Taliban, and from Saddam Hussein. The ones we haven't killed yet are surely enjoying the wonderful freedom that we've given them.   What a crock of shit. Who would believe such garbage?   The majority of the American public, that's who.   Our government has us pegged. They know they can get away with anything they want to anymore. Bail-outs for corporations that lay off their workers while their executives give themselves million dollar bonuses? You betcha! That makes no sense at all, but, whatever! Tax cuts that benefit the wealthiest people in this country more than anyone else? The wealthy have it better than any of us already, but Washington thinks they need more relief? OK, sure, why not! Screw us over all you want Uncle Sam, we've got our beer to keep us stupid and we've got plenty of new reality TV shows to keep our minds off of the things that really matter! Our government has a blatant favoritism of the wealthy and powerful in this country, and for corporate rights over individual rights. Why would our government favor the wealthy? Because all of the seats in our Senate, our House Of Representatives, and in our Oval Office are filled by millionaires. Many of them, billionaires. Who better to look out for the rich and the powerful in this country than the rich and the powerful themselves! If you think they're looking out for we, the people, well then, you, you're stupid. Go back to watching "Fear Factor", Jim Bob, I think they're going to be eating a sheep scrotum next.   The few folks who are still capable of independant thought, who try and speak out against what they see wrong with their government, are labeled as treasonous, anti-American, and they often have their livlihoods affected. Bill Mahr had his show cancelled by ABC after making a criticism of our military, and the Dixie Chicks were boycotted by angry Americans because they criticized President Bush. McCarthy-era politics are alive and well, here, in the new millenium. The political atmosphere today is not unlike that era either, filled with fear and paranoia. America is greater than that, or at least, it once was.   So our Government is corrupt, criminal, and a vast majority of our people are stupid sheep who do what they're told...  boy, does that make me proud to be an American! My eyes are welling up with tears of national pride.   America is the greatest country in the world, but it needs a tune-up, maybe even a complete overhaul, if it's going to survive into the next Millenium. We aren't perfect and we aren't indestructible. The Roman Empire was once the greatest nation on Earth too, but where is it today?   So today, on this Independance Day, I salute the people who have given their lives to make this country great, I curse and speak out against those who tarnish her greatness, and I say to you:   Go and BBQ America, have yourself a beer, watch some fireworks, but please, take a few minutes and think about the state of America today, and then think about what you can do to make America better tomorrow. It's still  our  country, and we can still take her back from the powers that be and make her great once again.   Peace to all.

        Lately I've Been...    Listening to:  Nothing on my stereo, some old Zebra on the PC.   Watching on TV:  I haven't been paying much attention to TV shows this week. I've watched a little of each of my usual shows, but I don't think I've sat through a whole show all week. I have watched a couple of movies though, "Lion In Winter", which was great, and "Ali", which was pretty good.    Downloading:  I downloaded some more Bill Hicks stuff, but it's hard finding what I need from him.     Playing:   Bejeweled, on the PC.    Reading:  I started an Anne Rice book, "Servant Of The Bones", but I only got a couple pages into it. That was several days ago, and I haven't picked it back up yet.    Jamming:  I jammed on Monday this week. I'm supposed to be learning a bunch of songs for next week, but I haven't even started working on any of that. I've played a little on my electric the other day, and I play my acoustic in bed almost everyday, before I fall asleep.     Working:  Still no job, still not looking.   Buying:  I bought a 6-pack of Budweiser for the last band practice (I still have 4 left) and I bought a copy of Maxim (Drew Barrymore made me buy it... she's hot).    Eating:  I had two McDonalds Filet-O-Fish sammiches tonight, I've been eating Jose Ole mini-tacos all week, we had a broiled london broil and some white rice the other night (which kicked ass), and I've had some rice pudding (low fat). I am still drinking too much soda.    Feeling:  Frustrated and useless.    Planning:  To get my shit together real soon. I am getting nothing accomplished. I'm going to bed too late and am getting up way too late. I need to get some income rolling in here and soon. I need to get a job, I need to sell some cards on eBay, I need to wash clothes, I need to clean the kitchen, my bed room, I need to shave... I need to do a lot of things and I am doing nothing. I just don't have any motivation. I need a kick in the ass, some inspiration. Sigh...

        Last Night   I didn't go to bed shortly after writing my last post, in fact, I didn't make it to bed until after daylight. My dumb ass. I did have another weird dream though. I'm sure it's of no interest to anyone, not even me really, but I am compelled to write it down. This one starts off with me and Will Ferrell. He has some sort of vehicle that looks like a lawn mower minus the handle, and wrapped in a loop around it is a colored plastic ribbon, for steering. In the dream, you sit behind it (I'm not sure if you sit on a detached seat, on some cardboard, or on the ground) and you control the direction with the ribbon, like you would a sled. A lot of the dream is fuzzy, I remember riding around the countryside and struggling to steer it, trying to avoid collisions, and I think at some point I was being chased by cops. Then, I remember riding this stupid thing down a highway and up over a huge bridge, high up in the air. As I got over the top of the bridge, I saw the the road ahead is missing a large section and that people are falling in the water below. The next thing I remember, I'm swimming in the water towards a small outcropping of sand and bushes next to the other side of the bridge. Greg, a childhood friend, is with me by then. As I sit on the sand embankment, I realize that it is moving and that I am sitting on top of a crocodile. I grab his jaws shut and Greg stabs him repeatedly until the croc is dead. From there we start looking around the wooded area behind us, looking for a way back to the mainland, and then I saw a skull, sitting up on a tree limb. I started looking around and discovered that there were a lot of skulls, everywhere, some on sticks, like warnings. It's fuzzy here, but I remember making it through to the other side of the woods, back onto the highway. Dreams are weird.

        Weirdness Continued   I knew it. I fucking knew it. If I went to bed to "nap", I just knew I wouldn't be getting back up around "9 or 10am". I didn't. I got up around 7pm. Big difference. Ugh! I went to lay down around 6am but I just couldn't sleep, just kept tossing and turning in bed. I know I was awake until 8am at least. Then, after I finally managed to fall asleep, I kept having strange, vivid, dreams. I remebered two of them after I got up, but I only remember one of them right now:    The Bear Dream: The first one I had involved a giant black bear and some police officers. In the dream, I was walking through a wooded area, like a small park, and I came across a big white ball the size of a basketball that looked like a little powdered donut hole. In the dream I took it as bear poo, an unusually large specimen.  I stepped on it and it looked like it was one of those powdered donuts but filled with pecans, nuts, so I knew it came from a bear. This worried me, so I started walking, very cautiously, back to the building I came from, which seemed like a church or a church building. Halfway there, I spotted a humongous black bear at the edge of the woods. The bear looked pretty fake to me, like it could be a guy in a bear suit, but it was drooling and was much larger than a man. Frightened and nervous, I ran for the building. It's a little fuzzy here, but I remember seeing the bear through a doorway, he had entered the building too, so I warned everyone in the "church" and had them evacuate. They panicked crazily. I ran out the front door onto a busy highway and saw a whole bunch of police officers and cop cars gathered somewhere down the road, about to raid some building, so I ran out there and got a few to come back to the "church" just as the raid began. They went into the back room and then I heard gunshots and saw some sort of struggle. The bear was dead. It gets fuzzy again, and then I remember going out back where two policemen, Officers Twist and Connor, are now shooting at birds and whatever creatures they see, somewhere back behind the "church". I recognize that some of the birds they are killing are endangered, so I raise a fuss with them. It gets fuzzy again, but I think they ignored me, and then I remember running down the street and getting another officer, a black one whose name I've forgotten, to come and stop them. He puts three of the birds (2 speckled brown ones and one other) in a plastic evidence bag and we talk about the incident. I want the officers charged fro killing the endangered birds and the black officer explains that they were full of Adrenalin after the bear incident and were just blowing off steam, trying to get me to forget about pressing charges. It's fuzzy here because I remember seeing a warehouse with a stack of huge bean bag chairs and on the top was a dead bird, "a biggun'" I called it, which looked like an ostrich or an emu. I was assuming they had killed it too, but my Mom said it had died last week and I was angry and confused that she had just let it decompose up there. At this point, I'm under the impression that the black officer is going to help me press charges against the other officers as he's carrying the evidence bag with the dead birds in it and I'm following him back to the "church" building. I stop to shut the warehouse door or to get the dead bird down, I forget which, and when I get back to the building, which seems a lot like my own living room, I find the officer gone and the bag of dead birds laying on my dining room table. I took it to mean that the black officer was counting on me to just let it drop, which angered me. I woke up around this point.   Very weird dream. I wouldn't even begin to know how to interpret it. Anyhow, I'm going to try and go to bed again soon. I've only been up for 6 hours, but I'm still kind of tired, even though I certainly shouldn't be. The weirdness continues...

        Weird Times Again   Jesus. I just can't get my shit straight. I'm  still  trying to get a "normal" sleep schedule. Sunday night, I stayed up all night long and went to bed at a decent time, but then I wound up staying in bed for over 14 hours, waking up around 5:30pm Monday. When I got up and saw the time I said "You've gotta be shittin' me". I couldn't believe it. Then, because I got up so late on Monday, when it was time to go to bed that night, I just wasn't tired, so I stayed up until almost noon on Tuesday before I got so tired I  had  to go to bed. But then, after I got into bed, I couldn't fall asleep! I wound up laying there, playing guitar for an hour or more and then, I basically just laid there for a couple hours before I finally fell asleep. I got up a little after 10:pm later that night. I probably should've just stayed there and tried to sleep til morning. Now, it is almost 6am, Wednesday morning, and I'm wide awake. In theory, I should be waking up in about 2 hours, ready to start my day, but I've got it all fucked up. I think I'm going to try and go to bed shortly, while it's still dark out. Hopefully, I'll nap until 9 or 10am, long enough to help get me through the rest of the day, and maybe then I can get to bed at a "normal" time tonight. We shall see...

         urlLink This-or-That Tuesday     1. Lemonade or Ice Cold Beer?   On almost all occasions, I'll go for the lemonade. Once in awhile though, a nice cold beer is good.   2. Swimming pool or beach?   I really dislike saltwater in my mouth and eyes, sand everywhere, and cuts on my feet from broken shells, so I definitely prefer swimming pools. However, I won't go to either if they're crowded.    3. Long weekends here & there, or a 2-week vacation?   You have time to enjoy yourself on a 2-week vacation, but there just isn't enough time on a long weekend.    4. Destination: Acapulco or Hawaii?   Acapulco, I suppose. I love mexican food and I love clear blue waters, so that'd be a killer mix.    5. Destination: Mountains or Beach?   Mountains. I'm not a beach person at all.    6. Hotel/motel/B&B or camping?   The former. I like camping  as a concept , but it's never been as much fun as I thought it should be. Maybe I just haven't gone camping with the right person.    7. Carefully planned vacation, or play it by ear?   A perfect vacation would combine a little bit of both. It's good to have an agenda, but spontaneity is part of the fun.   8. Sneakers or sandals?   I've never worn sandals, so I can't really compare them to sneakers. Sneakers are all I ever wear.    9. Air-conditioning or fans?   A/C and crank it, please.    10. Concerts in the park or baseball games?   Baseball games are long and boring, so I'd much rather go to a concert in the park. Besides, if you go with the right person, a concert in the park can be fun and even romantic.

        Jam Night   We got together tonight (Monday) to practice, rather than on Thursday, our usual jam night (Al's going out of town). It went well enough, but it just wasn't as good or as much fun as last time. This time, we had Jimmy (JP and Al's old drummer) on drums instead of Chris (who no-showed at band practice with Santana's band the night before), and we didn't have Ronnie on sax/flute, which really made a huge impact on our sound. I much prefer Ronnie being there. We all missed him.   We ran through JP's set list and did covers of "Breakdown", "Before You Accuse Me", "Can't You See", "Feelin' Alright", "Wild Night", "Sunshine Of Your Love", "Stuck In The Middle", "Old Apartment", "Sympathy For The Devil", and "Little Wing", which I threw in. We tried doing "I Got Loaded" too, but it didn't go down too well since Al and Jimmy don't really know it. We also did some of JP's songs: "At Night" (he may change this title), "Promise You The Moon", "Opportunity Knocks", and we also did Santana's "Subway Joe". We didn't do much jamming tonight, sticking instead to fairly straight versions of the songs from the set list. We were there for about 3 hours and played for about 2 1/2 hours.   I did ok on lead, but I'm still rusty after having barely played my electric guitar the last 2 months while I was ill. I did ok, screwed up a few times, but most of the stuff I screwed up on is stuff I've never played lead on before, so I had to wing it. Speaking of "winging it", I thought "Little Wing" turned out really well, but the other guys were kind of iffy on it. Of course, I played the Hendrix version and my rythym section played the Stevie Ray Vaughan version, so we weren't all on the same page, plus, we all wanted to hear Ronnie's sax on it. We'll have to try it again with him.   I thought Jimmy did a good job. He's not as loose as Chris, but he's a very competent drummer. Besides that, seeing as how Chris didn't show at Santana's practice last night (which pissed off Santana's bassist, causing him to quit Santana's group), we're lucky to have someone dependable like Jimmy.   After practice, JP and I worked on figuring out what songs to play, which to try, and which to scrap, from the set list. JP wants to add some more current songs to the mix, which is fine, as long as he doesn't choose crappy ones. He wanted to do a Barenaked Ladies song called "One Week" but I refuse to do that one. It's used on some TV commercial, which is played ad nauseum, and I've really come to hate it. We have a ton of cover songs on deck, songs to learn, so I'll be working my ass off learning 'em until the next practice, which is about 10 days from now. I'd like to finish some of my own songs and add them to the lists too.   All in all, I'm not as happy as I was after the last practice, but I'm still hopeful that we'll get it together and make some good music.

        Saturday Night/Sunday   Santana's party was rough. For starters, we got there about 4:30pm instead of 2pm. JP was running late and then he got lost on the way there. Some fugly chick walking down the road distracted us and he missed his turn. Secondly, the stage wasn't set up very well either. I was standing way off to the right side of the stage and could barely hear the rest of the guys, and to make matters worse, I was positioned right on top of a fire ant mound. Yay! If all of that weren't bad enough, it was hotter than hell out there, and of course, my dumb ass, I wore a long-sleeved shirt and pants. Duh! I thought I was going to have a heat stroke!  After we finally got situated, which took awhile (JP kept having sound problems), we began the first set. It was awful. I was awful. We were awful. I completely blew the intro to "Authority Song" (and made a few other boo-boos too), JP's acoustic wasn't coming through the PA, JP forgot the lyrics to one of his songs, Ronnie kept walking off the stage and disappearing (I had to improvise leads that Ronnie usually does), Jimmy's tempo on drums wasn't consistent, and John (Santana's keyboard player) was trying to play along with us and didn't know most of the songs. It was terrible. The people that were there were nice and complimentary though. It took awhile, but I learned to just say "thank you" when people say "you sounded great", when I know we didn't.   Between sets JP, Doris (JP's wife), and I went into the house for some chow. The buffet was not impressive. Chicken wings, baked beans, pasta salad, and some kind of goulash. I was expecting mexican food or something. I didn't eat anything anyway. I was too heat beaten, I probably would've puked if I'd eaten anything. Doris was telling me I screwed up a few times during the set and I concurred. She wasn't telling me anything I didn't know already. Eventually, me, Doris, JP, and Al went out to Santana's Florida room and talked and joked awhile before heading back out for the second set.   The second set was much, much better. I moved the amp in, closer to the other guys, but I still had to stand off the stage, out in front, plus the fire ants were even worse there, I got bit a few times and was constantly brushed them off my pant legs and shoes. It wasn't an ideal place to play, but I managed.   Like I said, we were much, much better during the second set. We wound up skipping a couple of songs from the setlist, since we were running out of daylight. Near the end, Santana had everyone play "Hot, Hot, Hot", and at that point JP and I split from the area. We have a mutual dislike of that song. JP was done for the night, but I got back up and played some more. One of Santana's friends, Mike, joined us on a few more songs. He played Clapton's "I Can't Stand It" (which I'd never really played before, but did ok with) and we did "Mustang Sally" (which sounded pretty decent), then John, the keyboardist played "Proud Mary", which I faked my way through. I had to solo during that one, not sure of what key I was playing in. It wasn't pretty, but I got out ok. I played until it was dark, or more accurately, until John broke into a Richard Marx song.   After we got packed and ready to head out, JP, Doris, and I had a talk about the band outside Santana's house. During the party, Rich (Santana's sound guy/brother-in-law) talked to all of use sepearately about having a permanent sound guy, telling us we needed one because of the size of the band. He also talked to Doris and JP and said something to the effect that Santana, Ronnie, him, and John (the keyboardist) were a package deal, which didn't rub either of them right. We came to the decision that we would have to scale the band down to a 4-piece unit, which is fine with me (although I'll really miss Ronnie's sax). A huge band would be too limiting. Most bars wouldn't have a stage that would fit us all. Plus John (the keyboardist) kind of rubbed me and JP the wrong way as well. He's pretty good, but he seems kind pretty arrogant. I feel bad for Santana, putting all of that time in with us only to be discarded like that, but I guess it's his own fault for trying to make Blue Condition into a new version of his own band. I mean, I really don't think Rich was talking to us about all that stuff without Santana's knowledge. Santana had to be behind it. So next Thursday, it will be the four of us, over at Circle once again. To be honest, I prefer playing at Circle, their AC is much better than Santana's.      After we split Santana's, we headed over to JP's parent's house. Doris met us there too. We talked and joked for a long while. I've always liked his parents, even after they forbid JP from playing with me when we were kids. They started off here in the park too, but they got out and did well for themselves. They have a really nice home now. I know it's a cliche, but they're good people.    I finally got home around 11:30pm and to my surprise, my nephew Jesse was here. I'd suggested he come over earlier and it worked out well. We made paper airplanes and then went to my room where Jesse played my handheld "Yahtzee" and listened to some tapes (Van Halen & Twisted Sister). I was dead tired and got into bed while Jesse played. After a bit, he went to bed (back in Mom's room) and I did too.   I slept terribly. I don't know if it was from the heat all day or from my sinuses, bit my head was killing me. I don't know how much, or how little, I slept, but it didn't seem like much. I got up around 8:30am, took some Aleves, and went back to bed. I slept until Mom woke me up around 11:30am.   I got up and we ran out to the flea market. I picked up six cassette tapes for $0.25 each (Stevie Ray Vaughan, Chicago, Bill Withers, The Animals, Hootie & The Blowfish, and 1 other), a deck of playing cards (a quarter), that "Russia House" CD (that I'm going to sell on eBay) for $3, and another cassette, Joe Walsh's "the Confessor", for a dollar. Jess bought a handheld "Hangman" game for $2. If he wouldn't have bought it, I would have.   From there we ran an errand over to JC Penney's, and then we went to Sonny's for lunch. I chowed down on all you-can-eat pork. We had that jerky waiter again. I don't think he likes me. I know I don't like him.     When we got home, Jess and I made paper airplanes, this time out of heavy sketch paper, and we drew designs on them. Jess made an "F-4 Jet" and I made mine the "FART-100" (aka "The Ass Kicker'). We also drew targets for the BB gun too. It was still too hot outside to fly the planes or to shoot the BB gun, so we played Rummy (I creamed him) and listened to music until about 6:30pm.   We had a ball with the planes. We had them flying really well. A couple times they flew up on the porch and Jess had to climb the ladder to get them down. Another time, mine flew over in Haggie's yard and Jess retrieved it. Eventually, both of them found their way on top of the house, so we played with the BB gun instead.   I hung the targets on the ladder (between the steps) and we took turns shooting. Jess had several bullseyes. His bullseye was a smiley face, mine was an ass, mooning. I got a bullseye too, but sadly, I didn't hit the ass. We did that for a long while.   I had Jess check to see if the planes blew off of the roof and they did. he was happy about that. We retired those planes and we made two more. We took them outside, but they didn't fly very well. These two were experiments, we folded the paper side to side, rather than top to bottom. We came in and we made two more "normal ones". We drew designs on these two; Jess called his "The Stealth" and mine was called "The Night Flier".  We took them outside and flew them for a long while. We had fun. Jess had his flying like crazy, a lot of hang time. Mine flew long distance too, but nowhere near as often as, or as far as, "The Stealth".   We came in, had ice cream, and then I put "The Naked Gun" on for Jess while I played on the PC. He's asleep now, and as soon as I finish blogging, I am heading to bed myself.   I guess I'm finished now.

        Grrrrrrr!!!!!!   Nothing's going right today. The flea market was terrible. Mom and I went there (after going to a couple yard sales here in the park) and by the time we got there (Noon), the place was a ghost town. Very disappointing. A few of the sellers said that it picks up a lot on Sundays. I need to go back tomorrow anyway, so I guess I'll find out for myself.   I saw a CD there today for $3 that I thought I could sell on ebay, but wasn't sure, so I left it there. After I got home, I checked eBay and it sells for $10, so I'm going to go back tomorrow and pick it up. I also saw a Stevie Ray Vaughan tape there for $0.25, but the seller had his booth packed up and I couldn't get to it. I'll likely pick that up too.   I bought 3 tapes today: Fleetwood Mac's Greatest Hits", Journey's "Greatest Hits", and a Bryan Adams greatets hits called "So Far, So Good", all for $2.  The same seller also had an unopened 7-pack of Maxell 90 minute tapes for $3 and I snagged it as well.     The mailman disappointed me again today. No cassette tape-filled packages, and only 1 payment, a small one for $5.11. I need money  bad . I wrote a check for over $22 at the Post Office today (we stopped there after the flea market) and I have a $50 check outstanding (my student Loan bill) and I think all I have is about $5 in my checking account. Now I'll have about $10.11. I have about $100 fue in and it'd better get here soon or I'm up shit's creek. To make matters worse, I found out that Gateway charged me $35 for a late payment last month. It was maybe a day or two late; whatever happened to grace periods? Thirty Five bucks is an awful lot to charge someone for a late payment, very unfair.   JP is running late today. he was supposed to be here by 2:30pm. Not a big deal, but like I said, nothing's going right today. Grrrrr!!!!!

        Saturday, So Far...   I slept terribly last night. I'm not sure I even slept at all, really. I stayed in bed until 10am, until I had had enough tossing and turning. My throat is sore, probably from my fan, which I had on high (the last two nights). I think Mom messed with the AC again. I came out, turned the PC on and had a flurry of eBay illiterates to contend with, people asking for my address again (after I sent out late notices). I sent every one of them my info after the auction ended, and even if they lost that info, they could have gotten my address at any time by going through eBay's Checkout feature right on the auction page. Needless to say, I'm not starting the day off in a very good mood.   On the bright side, Mom made breakfast this morning (bacon, eggs, & toast) and we may head over to the 49'er Flea Market shortly. I'm thinking about setting up there, to sell tapes and books, and I want to see how much business it's doing. I may have to go to the much, much larger Wagon Wheel Flea Market, or else head on up to my sister's and do the one near her house. It's going to be a couple of weeks before I start, still waiting on about 500 tapes to get here.   I talked to JP last night and we argued about one of his songs. I have a solid idea for one of his songs, but he's stuck on his way of doing it and I had to talk him into trying it. Next time we practice, we'll have to try it and tape it, so he'll hear what I hear. He's going to pick me up around 2:30pm this afternoon to go to Santana's party, where we're playing our first gig together.   I'll be back later tonight, blogging about how that went.

        Fried Day, August 29, 2003   I slept terribly last night, and wound up sleeping in late today, til just after 11am. I still feel pretty sluggish, and my allergies are bothering me again today. I wish I could just snap out of the funk and feel good. It's a nice day out again, but I'm stuck inside as usual. I have a lot of stuff to do. I need to get all of my auction stuff packaged and ready to mail out tomorrow. I have to do my mailings early tomorrow too, due to the party at Santana's that my band is playing, so I need to have it all ready to go tonight. I just don't much motivation to do anything (that sluggishness that I spoke of). I just just bring out the tape player, rock out, and get that stuff done. I need to do laundry, clean my room, and take the trash out too. I probably also should play the guitar a little too. I need to get moving. I think I'm going to throw some coffee on, bring out the tape player, and get cracking.   Yeah, that's the ticket.

        Eh.   I didn't get any (much needed) payments in today, but I did get a cassette tape-filled package. Unfortunately, the condition of the tapes leaves a lot to be desired. Some are just fine, some are so-so, but some are pretty bad, with torn inserts, cracked tapes, sun warped tapes, and water damage.   What the hell do these people do with their tapes?   I've always taken good care of my CDs and tapes, I don't get why people trash their stuff, especially CDs, which will last a lifetime and beyond if taken care of. Seems like a no-brainer to me.  I paid $17 for this lot of 42 tapes, a little more than I should have paid (considering re-sale... I try to pay about a quarter each), but it had a lot of good titles and I was buying it, in good part, for myself (especially the Dokken tape, which went right into my player). Here's a list of everything in the lot:  Aerosmith "Greatest Hits", Aerosmith "Pump", Beastie Boys "License To Ill", Bad English "Bad English", Bon Jovi "Bon Jovi", Bon Jovi "New Jersey", Bulletboys "Bulletboys", Cinderella "Long Cold Winter", Alice Cooper "Trash", Def Leppard "Pyromania", Def Leppard "Hysteria", Dire Straits "Money For Nothing", Dokken "Under Lock And Key", Europe "The Final Countdown", Faster Pussycat "Faster Pussycat", Faster Pussycat "Wake Me When It's Over", Great White "Twice Shy", Billy Idol "Billy Idol", Billy Idol "Rebel Yell", KISS "Smashes, Thrashes, & Hits", Loverboy "Wildside", Yngwie Malmsteen "Trilogy", Motley Crue "Shout At The Devil", Motley Crue "Theatre Of Pain", Motley Crue "Girls, Girls, Girls", Motley Crue "Dr.Feelgood", Poison "Look What The Cat Dragged In", Queensryche "Operation Mindcrime", Quiet Riot "Metal Health", Quiet Riot "Condition Critical", David Lee Roth "Eat 'Em And Smile", Scorpions "World Wide Live", Skid Row "Skid Row", Slaughter "Stick It To Ya", Tesla "The Great Radio Controversy", Twisted Sister "Stay Hungry", Van Halen "1984", Van Halen "5150", Warrant "Dirty Rotten Filthy Stinking Rich", White Lion "Pride", White Lion "Big Game", and Whitesnake "Slip Of The Tongue".   I have several more lots due in, and I really hope they're much nicer than the last two were. I'm going to have to start being choosier about the lots I bid on and I'll probably have to start bidding less for them. I'm getting just too many that I can't sell for $1 because of their condition. I'll have to start a $0.25 or $0.50 bin for the crappier ones.  I hope my order of tape cases comes in soon too...a lot of these tape cases are just... yucky. Ick!

        Bad Mail Day   I got three payments in the mail today, which is good, but I didn't get the big one I'm expecting. The ones I got today were nowhere near enough to cover the $50 student loan check I mailed out today, but they will cover the $7.00 I owe Santana (weekly rent on the rehearsal room). I'm really in a tight spot moneywise. I still have a bunch of money due in, enough to cover what I need, but now it's a matter of timing, hoping the money arrives before my checks clear. I hate this shit. Grrrrrr!!!  I had another lame eBay buyer to contend with today too. One of the envelopes I received contained $6.00 cash in it... and nothing else. No note mentioning which auction the $6.00 was supposed to be paying for, no item number, no email address, eBay ID, or any other identification. Of course, this person didn't follow my invoice instructions either and email me with their address, so I have nothing to match it up to. Idiot.    Besides not getting the money I need in today, I didn't get any cassette tape-filled packages either... dammit. I can't wait until they start rolling in, I'm going to be like a kid in a candy store.   Mmmmm..... ca-a-a-ndy.... (gurgle)  I'm really looking forward to them arriving, and every day they don't is a disappointment.   *Sigh*  Hopefully tomorrow will be a good mail day.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  I played a few of the tapes I bought recently: Guns 'N Roses - "Use Your Illusion 1", The Cure - "Disintegration", and REM - "Eponymous". Had a few others on too.   Watching on TV:  "Everybody Loves Raymond", "Seinfeld", "Saturday Night Live", "The Daily Show", "Columbo", Quincy ME", Bull Riding, and CNN. I watched an old "Hawaii 5-O" the other day too, but I really didn't care for it, too dated. I watched an old movie too, "Scarecrow", with Al Pacino and Gene Hackman, but I tuned out partway through it and missed the ending. It wasn't bad, but it just didn't hold my interest.   Downloading:  I downloaded a ton of Wesley Willis stuff. He died last week. A very unique artist, to say the least. Rock over London, rock on Chicago. Burger King, home of the Whopper.    Playing:  Nothing lately.     Reading:  Still haven't picked "Moby Dick" back up. I usually read in bed, but since I've gone back to normal hours, I go to sleep when I go to bed now, no reading. I'll have to make time for it during the day.     Jamming:  We practiced last night and ran through Sets 2 & 3.  Something was off last night and I think it was the drumming. Jimmy is a decent drummer, but he seemed to be lacking energy last night. A lot of the material seemed to fall flat. The rest of us played ok, though we still made small mistakes here and there. We're not tight yet. We really need to practice twice a week, but Jimmy can't do it. Grrrr! We're playing at Santana's party on Saturday, so that'll be like another practice. After that, we have to go into the studio for JP's CD, and we're going to start playing out here and there.   Working:   No job still, no prospects either. There wasn't jack in the paper on Sunday. I'm still selling cards on eBay, so that helps a lot. Plus, I'm still getting tapes in, gathering more and more "stock", so hopefully I can start selling them at the flea market sometime soon.    Buying:  Lots and lots of cassette tapes. Before I left for practice last night, I won another lot, 40 tapes, for $16. That's a little more than I should be paying  (I would like to keep it down to $0.20 - $0.25 each), but there were some great titles in the lot that I wanted for myself. Some of the better titles are Led Zeppelin - "III" & "Coda", Rush "Rush", "2112", "All The World's A Stage", and "Permanent Waves, Van Halen "Diver Down", The Clash "Combat Rock", Nirvana "Nevermind", and The Cars "Greatest Hits". There's also stuff by Billy Joel, KISS, Judas Priest, Joe Satriani, Queensryche, Steve Miller, Brian Setzer, and others. A very good lot.    Eating:   Mom made Chicken Divan (chicken, broccoli, cheddar cheese, bread crumbs, and a mayo sauce) twice this last week and it kicked ass. We had Chicken Cordon Bleus last night. For lunches, I've been eating tuna fish, Stouffer's Fish/Macaroni & Cheese dinners, oatmeal cookies, and peanut butter. I've been drinking orange juice, milk, water, iced tea (with Equal), and I had a beer last night... no soda at all! Yay!     Feeling:  Up and down, hopeful, but anxious. Physically, not too bad. My biggest problem right now is that I keep getting sleepy during the day.  My back hurts from time to time and my sinuses are a pain in the ass, but that stuff is nothing new.    Planning:  Again and again and again: I gotta get a job. Next week, hopefully, I will be able to go out and apply at a few places.

        So Good, For So Little   My "great day" is breaking down already. I received an email today from someone who bought a card off me on eBay who said I sent him the wrong card, which I did (my dumb ass), but then I also recorded that I sent the same card to another buyer, who won the card that got sent to the other guy, but he hasn't bothered to contact me about it. I have no idea what, if anything, I sent him now.   What a mess.   On top of that, another buyer (from Germany) said he sent me payment a month ago for a card he won... but I never got it. Of course, he sent cash (against my advisement), so there's no way to trace or verify his payment.   Yay!   Then, the mailman went and left me disappointed. I didn't get any payments in the mail, and worse yet, no packages filled with goodies.   Damn.   As if all of that wasn't enough of a pain, it's also the time of day where the heat outdoors begins to overwhelm the AC inside and it's starting to get very warm in here. Grrrrr. So much for happiness...   *sigh*  I'm starting to get sleepy... I think I'm going to go take a nap.

        So Far, So Good   I slept pretty well last night, for a change, and am feeling pretty good right now. I got up at 8:35am and JP was here unloading his equipment (he brings his stuff over on practice days). We talked for a few minutes before he split for work. As he was leaving, I was bidding on yet another cassette tape auction on eBay and won it. I bought 29 tapes for $8.50 (includes shipping). Highlights from this lot are Cat Stevens "Tea For The Tillerman", Bruce Springsteen "The River", The Police "Zenyatta Mondatta" & "Synchronicity", Lynyrd Skynyrd "Gold & Platinum", Styx "The Grand Illusion", Def Leppard "Pyromania", and Aerosmith "Toys In The Attic". Not a bad start to the day!   Hopefully, this day's going to get better and better too! I'm expecting tapes and tape cases in and they may be here today and I'm expecting some eBay payments in and some of them could be here today. Also, I have band practice tonight, and I think it might be a blast with all of us gearing up for Saturday's "gig". This could be a  great  day!  Oh! I found out something cool when JP and I were talking this morning: Jimmy is supposed to lining up a gig for us and it's a paying gig. I thought the band made like $100 a night, but JP said it's more like $200-$250. Sweet!

        My Newest Endeavor   I've been thinking for awhile now about doing something I enjoy for a living, and I've started to act on that idea. I love music more than anything else, and working around music would be heaven to me. I haven't heard of any openings in any of the CD stores around here, but I probably wouldn't enjoy working in them anyway (imagine  me  suggestive selling Britney Spears or Fifty Cent), so I'm going to try and start my own music-related side business.  I'm starting off with cassette tapes. I don't have a job and can't afford to buy lots of CDs or DVDs, so for the last two weeks, I've been buying cassette tape lots on eBay, partly for me, but also to gain some "stock". I bought about 250 tapes so far, at about $0.20 each, and today, I bought about 250 more, also at about $0.20 each. I won four lots of tapes, here's a breakdown:   Lot #1  - 35 tapes + 3-drawer cassette case for a total of $10. Includes: The Beatles "1967-1970", The Cars "Greatest Hits", Bob Seger "Stranger In Town", Bruce Springsteen "Born In The USA", Elvis Presley "Number One Hits", Boston "Boston" & "Don't Look Back",  AC/DC "Live", ZZ Top "Eliminator", and Van Halen's "OU812", "5150", & "1984".    Lot #2  - 26 tapes for $10. Includes: Kansas "The Best Of Kansas", Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young "So Far", David Bowie "Lets Dance", Cheap Trick "At Budokan", Creedence Clearwater Revival "Chronicle", Genesis "Abacab", and REO Speedwagon "Hi Infidelity".   Lot #3  - 120 tapes + 3 cassette cases for $14. This is a mystery lot. I have a list of artists, but don't know any individual titles. Contains 95% country music, which may sell well around here. Some of the rock artists included in the lot are: Billy Joel, Bob Seger, Boston, and Fleetwood Mac.    Lot #4  - 71 tapes for $14.27. This is another mystery lot. They didn't list any of the tapes included, but from the scan I can see titles by Billy Squier, Joe Walsh, The Clash, Jethro Tull, AC/DC, The Honeydrippers, The Cars, Judas Priest, Foreigner, and Motley Crue.  I already ordered brand new tape cases, so the tapes will all look nice after I'm through with them. I figure my costs are about $0.33 per tape ($0.20 per tape + $0.13 for a new case), although it's likely a little higher since some of the tapes probably won't be sellable (I think I can count on that).   I'm thinking I can start off by selling them for $1 a piece at the flea market (or wherever). I'd like to sell some of the better ones for a little more, but then I think that having good titles in there will draw people to my table, so I might be better off selling them all for $1 each. I'm just worried I'll get "cherry-picked" and have a table full of crappy ones.   In the beginning, I will also be selling used paperbacks (Stephen King books mostly), basketball cards, and eventually, I would like to have some CDs and DVDs to sell as well. I will probably offer trades for that stuff at first and keep an eye out on eBay for deals. If I'm successful with it, maybe I'll be able to do it full-time someday. That's my dream anyway.  In all honesty, I'd probably consider it a minor success if I could sell enough to pay for the stuff I buy on eBay. I could put together a great collection for myself and sell off what I don't need, or don't want, to pay for them. I could certainly live with that.  In the meantime, I've got a shitload of tapes coming (about 400 due in after I pay for them all) and I'm really looking forward to their arrival! I will sort through them, put them in new cases, chuck the bad ones, and try to listen to them all.   That is my idea of great fun.   How sad is that?

        Blues On Tuesday   I don't know what's going on here, but for the second night in a row, I don't think I slept more than an hour or two. I tossed and turned for hours, totally awake, before finally getting out of bed around 8am this morning. Just like yesterday, I had had enough.   I hope my insomnia isn't coming back, especially not now, when I've finally got a normal sleep schedule. I had it for several months last year and it was a really tough time for me.   Yesterday, I happened to look in my blogger archives to see what I was doing the same time last year and coincedentally, I was struggling with insomnia. I wonder if it's something in the air this time of year that does it to me (I have allergy problems).   Whatever the problem, I am up... tired as hell, but up.   I started moving the little TV from my room into Mom's room (hers quit working) when JP called me back. We're not practicing on Thursday this week, but on Wednesday instead, and practice for Tuesday is off. We started tallking about transportation again (it may be a problem this Saturday), and he wound up brow-beating me for awhile about my job and transportation situation. I don't think he understands just how incredibly screwed up my situation is. For instance, he's talking about me taking a bus over to Tampa for work at a bank. I had to explain that 1) getting from here to Tampa via the bus would be a major task involving several bus transfers, and it would take a lot of time and money to get back and forth each day. In fact, to catch the bus in the morning, I'd have to be up by 5am, and if we're playing until 11:00-11:30pm at night, it wouldn't give me much time to sleep, not enough for me to function on. 2) I don't have any clothes suitable to wear in a bank and it would require hundreds of dollars for me to get some. 3) I don't have any job experience that make me desirable to a bank: Wendys and production work. In other words, it'd be an unrealistic situation for me. He said Al knows of a job opening in telemarketing, but there's no way in hell I would do that, no matter how much I need. I need a job and I need money, but I refuse to surrender my principles for either. He doesn't understand that, but then, he works in telemarketing himself. He says I should just go back to fast food then, for some quick cash, but I said "no way". My resume is crap as it is, if I get another fast food job on there, it's going to push the one "good" job I had, Evatone, off of many job applications. We've had the same conversation a few times before, it's always the same: he says I make too many excuses, I say I'm just being realistic. I've neglected myself for two decades, twenty years of not taking care of myself, of choosing "easy" over "smart", and it's not going to change overnight. I'm moving forward and I'm going to try to do it right this time and I will not settle for less.   Back to Mom's TV...

        Monday Blues Continued   Well, I got my first lot of cassette tapes in, almost 100 of them, and I have to say: "eh". Here's what was in there:  ABC - "How To Be A Zillionaire!", AC/DC - "The Razor's Edge", Adam Ant - "Antics In The Forbidden Zone", Aerosmith - "Permanent Vacation", The Alarm - "Standards", Art of Noise - "The Best Of The Art of Noise", The B52's - "PartyMix/Mesopotamia", Bauhaus - "Burning From The Inside", Big Audio Dynamite - "The Globe", Billy Idol - "Whiplash Smile", Blondie - "The Best of Blondie", The Cure - "Disintegration", "Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me", & "Mixed Up", The Damned - "Mindless Directionless Energy: Live At The Lyceum 1981", David Bowie - "Let's Dance" & "The Rise And Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars", Depeche Mode - "101" (2 tapes), "Catching Up With Depeche Mode", "Music For The Masses", "Songs Of Faith And Devotion", & "Violator", Devo - "Devo's Greatest Hits", Echo & The Bunnymen - "Porcupine", Elastica - "Elastica", Erasure - "Crackers International" & "The Innocents", Eurythmics - "Revenge", Extreme - "Extreme II:Pornograffitti", Faith No More - "The Real Thing", Fine Young Cannibals - "The Raw & The Cooked", The Fixx - "React" & "Shuttered Room", A Flock of Seagulls - "Dream Come True" & "Listen", Jane's Addiction - "Ritual De Lo Habitual", Jesus Jones - "Doubt", Kajagoogoo - "White Feathers", King - "Steps In Time", Led Zeppelin - IV, Lush - "Gala", Men At Work - "Business As Usual", Metallica - "Ride The Lightning", Morrissey - "Kill Uncle", Motley Crue - "Dr. Feelgood", New Order - "Technique", Nine Inch Nails - "Pretty Hate Machine", Nirvana - "Nevermind", NitzerEbb - "Ebbhead" & "Showtime", The Other Ones - "The Other Ones", Ozzy Osbourne - "No More Tears", Pet Shop Boys - "Retrospective", R.E.M. - "Eponymous" & "Out Of Time", Rollins Band - "The End of Silence", Siouxsie & The Banshees - "Peepshow"& "Superstition", Social Distortion - "Social Distortion", Soho - "Goddess", Split Enz - "The Best of Split Enz The Story Never Repeats", The Sundays - "Blind", Suzanne Vega - "Solitude Standing", Talk Talk - "The Party's Over", Talking Heads - "Little Creatures" & "Stop Making Sense", Temple of the Dog - "Temple of the Dog", 'Til Tuesday - "Voices Carry", Vanilla Ice - "To the Extreme", Yaz - "Upstairs At Eric's". Soundtracks: "The Adventures of Ford Fairlane", "Dream A Little Dream", Prince - "Purple Rain", "Pump Up The Volume", "Singles"  These two weren't listed but were mixed in the box with the others: Cocteau Twins - "The Pink Opaque" & N2Deep - "Back To The Hotel"  I didn't list the cassette singles because I wasn't buying the lot for them. There were over 20 of them.   I paid $15.05 for the whole lot, which was described as a "great lot of cassettes", but there was no mention in the description about water damage to several of them (some of the tapes felt damp when I unwrapped them from the bubble wrap and many of the covers to the cassette singles are ruined), there is writing on some of them, inserts missing on a few of them (including, sadly, David Bowie's "Let's Dance", which I was really looking forward to), and I already found an erroneous cassette in one of the cases (Metallica's "Ride The Lightning" case had their "One" single inside of it). All of the cases are filthy and worn with many of them cracked. The Nirvana "Nevermind" tape is cracked (the tape itself); none of that was mentioned either. I haven't went through everything real well yet, but it looks like there's still enough decent stuff to make this purchase worthwhile (hell, for $15, I can't complain too much), several will definitely go into my collection, but it definitely wasn't the "great lot" that I was expecting. Here's hoping the next lot is much bettter.

         urlLink Monday Mission     1. When was the last time you helped out a friend in need? What was going on that made you want to help?   Probably not since I got screwed over helping a "friend", more than 10 years ago. It's not that I won't help out friends anymore, it's just that I have less of them around nowadays. I'm more selective about who I call a "friend" now. Besides, all of my friends are doing better than I am, so there's been no need of my aid. If it counts, I help out my sister when she asks for my help, monetarily or otherwise.    2. Are you a "pet" person? Do you like to keep pets or would you rather not bother with them? Why?   I like to have pets around, but I don't think I'm a "pet person". I wouldn't want to live in a zoo or anything, but having a few around for companionship is nice.    3. In a dating or married relationship, is it possible to change someone to be more like you want them to be? Have you tried to or had someone try to change you? How did it turn out?   No one bothers with me, so I can't answer that for myself, but I have seen friends of mine changed by women, yes.    4. In your opinion, why is it that some married people have affairs? Is it ever justified?   First off, I don't think it is ever justified, no way. If you're someone inclined to fool around, if one person isn't enough for you, then don't get married, don't lie to someone you supposedly love, don't go back on your vow. Cheaters are selfish assholes. Why do they do it? Because they are selfish and egotistical. Maybe they aren't satisfied with what they have already, maybe they aren't getting it enough at home, but there are remedies for that (communication, therapy, creativity, etc..).    5. Do you tend to make the same mistakes over and over? Got any examples?   I always take the easy route, especially when it comes to jobs. Hence a resume filled with Wendy's, Kash-N-Karry, and temporary work. It's put me in a bad situation where I'm not qualified to do anything better, even though I'm quite capable.    6. What do you find distracts you the most when you are trying to concentrate?   Noise.    7. What do you know "now," that you wish you knew "then?"   That my life will be crap unless I learn to drive, get a car, and stay physically fit. Women say "it's who you are  inside  that matters most"... what a crock of shit.    BONUS: What's the matter with your life?   Bad management.

        Mo' Monday Blues    My Mom just emailed me and told me that my (Great) Uncle Bob died today. Apparently he died a week ago, but no one bothered to tell us until today. We used to be pretty close, but my Dad drove a wedge between us and the rest of the family. In the last 20 years, I think I've seen him maybe three times, just randomly, when we happened to run into each other at the flea market or wherever.   Uncle Bob was my Dad's Uncle, my Great Uncle, and he was a pretty neat guy back in his day. He raced cars, was in the Navy, built model airplanes, and played guitar. Eventually, Uncle Bob gave me his acoustic guitar, the same guitar I always got in trouble for playing with (when I was a kid, visiting over there). I think it may have been my first acoustic guitar period, but I'm not sure anymore. I certainly played it a long time and I learned a lot on it. I've always been happy that he saw to give it to me. I've always wanted to show him what I did with it, how much I've learned, but like I said, my Dad caused a rift in the family and our families have never been as close as we once were, so that never happened.   That's too bad.   So long, Uncle Bob, and thank you.

        Monday Morning Blues    I slept very badly last night. I don't know how much (or how little) I slept, but it doesn't feel like much. I kept tossing and turning all night long. My undersheet is pulled off the bed at the top corners from all of the moving around. I wound up getting out of bed at 7:30am because I had had enough. It was really aggravating me.   I should be job hunting today, but I don't have any busfare yet and there wasn't jack in the newspaper yesterday, so I guess I'm doing nothing today. Grrrrr!!! I have got to get moving on the job situation (have I said that enough?). Talk about aggravating...  On the positive side, I had Pineapple Upside-Down Cake for breakfast... awesome!

         urlLink Monday Madness     1. What is your favorite form of art, and why?   I've always been attracted to music. Even as a toddler, I remember having a love for music (as a 3-4 year old, I used to grab a stick and pretend to sing along with records, entertaining my family) and I've always kept music around me. As a kid, I collected KISS records, I collected Monkees records, and as a teenager, I amassed a huge cassette tape collection, and later started collecting Jimi Hendrix. Most everything got sold along the way, but today, I still have a huge Hendrix collection, I have a huge CD collection, and I am starting to get a cassette collection going again as well.    Why is music my favorite art form? I don't know, it just is.    2. What, in your opinion, is your greatest artistic talent?   I'm a musician, and sometimes when I play, I will hear things that others won't. Like with JP, my bandmate, I'll add stuff to his songs that I'll hear in my head, but that weren't there before.    3. If you were given a blank canvas and some oil paints, what would you paint?   Something psychedelic, colorful. I'm not very good at drawing realistically. I can do cartoony stuff, but when it comes to shading and detail, I just don't have the patience. Maybe that's why I like music so much: the instant gratification.     4. What is your favorite subject to photograph?   Things that I find amusing. The last pictures I took were of my nephew Jesse covered in a in storm of cattail fluff and of my cats, doing various silly stuff.    5. Are you musically inclined? Please elaborate!   I think I answered this already. I am a musician. I play guitar and can play bass. I can also play the keyboards a little too. I am in a band now (we're supposed to play at a party next Saturday, our first "gig" together).

        Sunday   I "worked" most of the day today, scanning and listing cards on eBay. I got 85 auctions up tonight, a record for me. I also won another auction tonight too, a lot of 36 cassette tapes for just one dollar... unbelievable! Actually, shipping on the tapes should be about $5-$6 bucks, so it's isn't just one dollar, but still... great deal! Some of the best titles in the lot are Def Leppard's "On Through The Night" & "Pyromania", J.Geils Band's "Freeze Frame", Robert Plant's "Now And Zen", Queen's"Live Killers", Ozzy Osbourne's "Blizzard Of Ozz", AC/DC's "Who Made Who", and Van Halen's first album. The rest is a strange mix of Pop, Rap, and Metal (a lot of it sucks, and will be re-sold).   I've been on and off the PC all day, as usual. I watched "Men In Black II" on TV today. I wasn't real thrilled with it. The special effects were cool, but the script was pretty stupid. Hollywood people must think the American Public will buy anything. Then again, I think movie did do well at the box office, so...  I looked in the paper for jobs today and couldn't find anything. I need to find something very soon. I'm starting to get worried.    I'm guess I'm going to be heading to bed soon. Unfortunately, there's some idiot neighbor of mine blasting his stupid stereo, so I'm not looking forward to laying in bed listening to that crap. Thump, thump, thump... thanks, jerk.

        Friday/Saturday   Friday night sucked. There was a Jimi Hendrix show on Trio that I'd never seen before (Jimi on the Dick Cavett show) and my stupid ass, I fell asleep on the couch about 1/2 hour before it came on. Dammit! I was in and out of sleep most of the night before I finally got up from the couch sometime around 1am. I played around on the PC and watched TV a bit (I watched the first half of "Bullets Over Broadway") before falling asleep on the couch again. I don't think I totally fell asleep again at all though. The cats started their playtime around 5-5:30am, running and scratching and playing, the garbagemen came sometime after the cats settled down and they woke me up, and then around 7am, Mom came out and started baking, making plenty of noise. I finally got up around 7:40am and went to my own bed, sleeping until a little after Noon.   This was the first day all week I haven't been out of bed around 8am. I thought I might have screwed that up, but luckily, I am tired now and will be heading to bed shortly, so I'm still on track.   Today was boring as hell. I did get to leave the house, but only for about 15-20 minutes, just long enough to take my mail to the Post Office and come home. I asked Mom about going up to my sister's, but she didn't want to. She didn't want to go to Goodwill either. I'm really sick of being home all the damned time. The rest of the day I played around on the PC, watched TV, and ate. Yay.   The only cool event all day was someone from eBay offering me 42 cassette tapes for $17 (delivered). That comes out to about $0.40 per tape. I'd bid on this guy's auction earlier, but he had a reserve on it and I didn't meet the reserve. He emailed me and offered them to me for $2 more than I bid, and I took him up on it. Some of the better titles in the lot are: Motley Crue's "Shout At The Devil", Aerosmith's "Greatest Hits", Dire Straits' "Money For Nothing", Yngwie Malmsteen's "Trilogy", Queensryche's "Operation Mindcrime", Scorpions' "World Wide Live", "Quiet Riots' "Metal Health", Def Leppard's "Pyromania", and Dokken's "Under Lock And Key". The rest is all '80's rock, stuff like Billy Idol, Van Halen, White Lion, Bon Jovi, Faster Pussycat, Tesla, Cinderella, etc... a lot of hair there. Now I just need some money in my Paypal account to pay for it. I should have it soon. Hopefully.   I have to send out 2 winner's notices and then I'm heading to bed.

         urlLink The Friday Five     1. When was the last time you laughed?   A minute ago, at something I wrote. I laugh a lot. The last  big laugh  would be last night at band practice, when JP, on a percussion instrument, played a familiar rhythm I instantly recognized as the awful song "Fish Heads". No one else knew what we were laughing about. That song's been a running joke between us for about 15 years.    2. Who was the last person you had an argument with?   My Mom, a couple days ago.    3. Who was the last person you emailed?   My last email was to eBay, about a suspicious email from "eBay customer support" asking for my password and user ID. I keep getting those, almost daily. Sometimes they say "eBay Security Check" too, but they're all bogus. Someone out there is trying to scam my info. I feel sorry for the less savvy people who actually fall for it.   The last individual I emailed was to someone who had one one of my eBay auctions. I sent an invoice.    4. When was the last time you bathed?   I showered last night, before practice.    5. What was the last thing you ate?   I had a bacon cheeseburger from Checkers before I left for practice last night. I ate around 6pm. That reminds me: I'm freakin' hungry!

        Jam Night   Last night's band practice went ok, I guess. I was pretty tired going in and didn't play very well, but strangely, no one else seemed to notice much. Everybody seemed real pleased with the practice. Maybe it's just me.   Before we got rolling tonight, we goofed off a bit. Just for fun, I threw out "You Shook Me All Night Long" by AC/DC and we played it a little (we sounded like shit) and then I threw out War's "Low Rider" and we jammed on that a bit too (which sounded pretty good). We had the full band there last night, all six of us, and we ran through set 1, set 2 and part of set 3. Here are the set lists as they stand now:  Set 1 "Old Apartment" by Barenaked Ladies "Wild Night" by Van Morrison "What She Loves" an original by JP "Opportunity Knocks" an original by JP "All For You" by Sister Hazel "The Way" by Fastball "Promise You The Moon" an original by JP "You Can't Run" an original by JP "American Girl" by Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers "Crazy Little Thing Called Love" by Queen "Stuck In The Middle With You" by Stealers Wheel  Set 2 "Had A Girl" an original by JP (we may alternate this with U2's "One") "Love The One You're With" by Stephen Stills "I Wanna Be Sedated" by the Ramones "Authority Song" by John Mellencamp "Sleeping Forever" an original by JP "Little Wing" by Jimi Hendrix (alternates w/ Marshall Tucker Band's "Can't You See" & Eric Clapton's "Wonderful Tonight") "Before You Accuse Me" by Bo Diddley (as done by Eric Clapton)  "The Middle" by Jimmy Eat World "We Don't Need Much" an original by JP "Sunshine Of Your Love" by Cream "Go Your Own Way" by Fleetwood Mac  Set 3 "Blister In The Sun" by Violent Femmes "Feelin' Alright" by Dave Mason "Steal My Kisses" by Ben Harper "The Curtain Falls" an original by JP (alternates with JP's "Something More") "If It Makes You Happy" by Sheryl Crow "Circle" an original by JP "The Difference" by the Wallflowers "Rock This Town" by the Stray Cats "You May Be Right" by Billy Joel "Subway Joe" an original by Santana (may alternate with Carlos Santana's "Oye Como Va")  JP threw "Before You Accuse Me" back in the set list on his own and I'm not real happy about that, especially in set #2, where we already do two Clapton songs. We will likely replace it with Stevie Ray Vaughan's "Cold Shot" and we're also talking about doing Steve Miller's "Jungle Love", so "Before You Accuse Me" may well be history. I really don't enjoy playing it anyway, which is odd, because I love playing the blues.   We added Ben Harper's "Steal My Kisses" to the set lists tonight, and we wound up working on that for awhile. Al, JP, and I had our parts pretty much down (there's one small bridge that we need to figure out though), but the other guys hadn't heard the song before and weren't sure what to play. It didn't have the energy it should have. We'll have to work on it more.   It appears we're going to go ahead and get booked at some places. Everybody else seems to think we're about ready. I still think we need more practice. We're going to play at a party at Santana's house on the 30th (8 days away), so that should be a good gauge of where we're really at.   I really need to get some money and fast. My equipment just isn't good enough. I need a bigger amplifier, my guitar needs work done on it, and I would like a back-up guitar on hand. I'm going job hunting on Monday, but I'm considering selling off part of my Jimi Hendrix CD collection for some fast money. I just know I'll regret it later though. I'll need to figure out something soon though, if we're going to be playing out very shortly.   I played JP's Eric Clapton model Strat tonight. I hadn't played it but once before, and wasn't impressed with it then. But tonight, after playing mine and then his, I think I like it a lot. It's very crisp and biting and it's louder than mine (it has a built-in pre-amp). It also stays in tune much better than mine.   I had tuning problems all freaking night. I had to drop out of one song because it was way off. I think the battery in my tuner died and it gave me the wrong tunings, so I replaced the battery and re-tuned... all in the middle of a song. Ugh! I hope that doesn't happen when we play live, that would  suck .    We practiced until 11:30pm last night, and by the end of the night, I was dead tired. My feet hurt, my back ached, and I was drenched in sweat. I should've taken a nap before practice (I tried to, actually) because Early Rising and Late Night Jamming do not go hand-in-hand.   Before we left for the night, Santana wanted to try out some lyrics he had for one of my songs (the E9 one with the bass lines), so we worked on it a bit. I didn't really like what he was doing. He sang something about a woman getting naked in front of a mirror and then him rubbing oil all over her... that was in verse 1. There's no telling where it went from there.   We're practicing again on Thursday, and JP and I will probably get together on Tuesday, possibly with Al.

        Early Riser Blues   Today marks the third day in a row I've been up around 8am, a major accomplishment for me. I'm getting up ok, but man... come 10-11am, I start getting really sleepy. I can hardly keep my eyes open. I'm trying to stay busy, but when the sleepiness hits it's overwhelming. I want to take a nap, but I just know that if I do that I won't be able to get to sleep early tonight and that'll derail my new "early morning lifestyle". As always, everything has to be a struggle for me.   I mentioned I was trying to stay busy; so far today, I cleaned off the front porch (swept, re-potted & hung some plants, cleaned off the patio table), cleaned up around the house some, did some laundry, and played guitar for a bit. I've also been on and off the PC all day as well and I had the TV on, but there hasn't been anything worth watching on TV today.   I think that's why I'm blogging now, because I don't really have anything to say, I'm just trying to keep busy.   I have band practice tonight, so that'll keep me busy later. I may not be able to blog about it until Friday though, depending on what time I get home tonight. I've been trying to go to bed before Midnight and I got home at 11:30pm afetr the last band practice.   I should probably be going to bed around 11pm, but I'm having a tough time adjusting to not watching "The Daily Show" and "Tough Crowd" from 11pm-Midnight. I love those shows. Of course, they do re-air them the following evening between 7-8pm so I could try to catch them then, but that's my "Everybody Loves Raymond" & "Seinfeld " TV time. Man... I gots it tough, huh? Ha!

        Another Day In Paradise   I was in a really good mood all day today... until Mom got home. We got into a huge argument tonight. She ran two errands for me in the last week and both times, she screwed them up.   We need ink for the printer and Office Depot is right next to where she gets her hair done, so on Saturday (when she was getting her hair done), I asked her to pick the ink up for me and I wrote the type I needed down for her: "BCI-24". She came home with BCI-21. She said they didn't have BCI-24's, and she wasn't sure whether or not my "4" was really a "1" (the extra lines would have clued me in). She called me from her hair place before she went to Office Depot, so I really don't understand why she didn't call me from Office Depot if she was unsure, rather than buying the wrong ink.   I tell her all the time "if they don't have exactly what I need, don't buy anything at all", so it frustrates me that she went ahead and bought it anyway. I still have no ink and now she has to make another trip to return the wrong kind. Obviously, I wasn't very happy about it and we got into a small argument over it. Somehow, it's my fault that she bought the wrong thing, because I should have done it myself. You can't argue logic like that, so whatever... I just let it go.     Today she ran another errand for me: she was supposed to pick up a few card supplies I need (she works right by the card shop). I called her this afternoon at work and had her write down exactly what I needed (jersey-size top loads and team bags). I even gave her my last two team bags to take with her so she'd get the right thing.   She didn't.   She got the top loads I'd asked for, but instead of team bags, she bought the much larger (and more expensive) graded card sleeves. I needed the team bags badly. I need them to package up the cards I sold on eBay, to mail out tomorrow. I really wasn't very happy about this, not at all. We wound up getting in a huge argument over it. She just will not admit she's wrong. Even after I tell her over and over "if they don't have exactly what I need, don't buy anything at all", she still buys the wrong stuff and then she gets all defensive and angry when I get mad at her for buying the wrong stuff.   And I was pretty angry. I need to package up the cards I sold so I can mail them out tomorrow and now I can't, which may cause me some trouble with the auction winners. I'm also angry because whenever we argue about this, Mom uses driving against me, like a weapon.  See, I don't drive. I never have. When I was 16 my Dad promised to get me a car and teach me how to drive, but he never did. Then, my younger sister got pregnant a year or two later and my Mom got her a car and a license, but she never got me set up. I was forgotten, neglected, in that area. Years later, when I really wanted to get a car, my Mom told me I'd have to move out if I did because if I had a license and lived with her, it would raise her insurance premiums. I couldn't afford an apartment and all of the expenses that go with that, so I had to forget about getting a car.   Eventually, a friend of mine taught me how to drive her car and I eventually got a restricted license, but by then, I was deep in debt and couldn't afford to get a car. I'm still in debt, so I still don't drive. It's a sore spot for me. I feel utterly helpless at times, like I'm stranded, like the whole world is moving and I'm stuck in one spot. It makes me angry too, because everyone else I know is driving but me. I also didn't think it was fair that my younger sister got a car before I did, got put on the right path, while all I got was put off to the side. Like I said, it's a sore spot for me, a vulnerability.   But that's where Mom always hits me in these arguments: "I just won't run anymore errands for you, you can go do them yourself!" In boxing, that would be considered a "low blow". You see, to get to that card shop myself would require 4-6 buses (4-6 bus tickets: $5-$6.50) and at least 2 1/2 hours of travel time. Not to mention standing out in the heat and/or rain at the bus stops waiting for the buses. Sure, I can do this stuff myself, but it's a  major  pain in the ass for me. It takes her just 10-15 minutes to run there after work, so I don't see it as a big deal to ask for her help.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not a total jerk, I know it's still an inconvenience for her to run errands for me, and I try not to ask her to do it too often. I certainly wouldn't ask her to run back and forth to the same places over and over again, but now she has to. She's got to take the wrong things she bought back for refunds, which is why I tell her all the time "if they don't have exactly what I need, don't buy anything at all". I feel bad because now she has to make these extra trips and I'm not happy because I didn't get the things I needed.   I'm not quite sure why she got so angry though. To me, it's simple: she screwed up. If it was me, I'd have just acknowledged that. Instead, she immediately starts getting defensive (passing the blame from her to me), then she starts yelling at me, and then she got nasty and vindictive (with the driving stuff). After that, it was straight on to totally irrational (complete with tantrum). All the while, the only thing I got as to why she is angry is that she's tired of my complaining when she screws up, although she completely refuses to acknowledge that she screwed up at all.   Irrational and illogical.   After an hour, I went back to try and talk to her again, to reason with her, hoping she'd calmed down, but she was fast asleep. Maybe she was just tired and cranky today, who knows? But now I am in a really bad position. I have one more errand I need her to run for me.   She usually mails stuff for me on Wednesdays, but she was going to do it on Thursday this week...tomorrow... and I have no idea if she's going to do it now or not. Of course, I have no money for busfare either, so even if I want to go do it myself, I can't.   I'm pretty much screwed.   Damn, I was in such a good mood today too.   I even took some time this morning and hooked up Mom's new VCR for her. I was hoping to surprise her.  I guess I got the surprise.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  I had Jefferson Airplane's "Surrealistic Pillow album on the tape player a couple times this week, and I played some of  ZZ Top's "Greatest Hits" today as well (jamming along with it).    Watching on TV:  "Everybody Loves Raymond" and "Seinfeld". I also watched some "Saturday Night Live", "The Daily Show", "Late Night with Conan O'Brien", Bull Riding, and CNN. I haven't been in much of a TV watching mood lately. However, I did watch a movie yesterday, "Three Days Of The Condor", a Robert Redford movie. It was decent, but I don't think the romance thing between him and Faye Dunaway was very believable (too much, too quickly). Redford was great in it though, and it kept me interested, but it was a bit too convoluted in parts. The plot was pretty similar to the "Fugitive".   Downloading:  Nothing at all.     Playing:  Grand Theft Auto... the original one.     Reading:  Nothing at all. I started "Moby Dick" a week or two ago, but haven't picked it up since.     Jamming:  Tuesday night's practice over at JPs was cancelled (by JP), we're still playing tomorrow night though. I practiced for an hour or more yesterday and I played for little while today.       Working:  Not yet.      Buying:  I spent just a little over $31 for the two cassette tape lots I bought on eBay (over 170 full-length tapes, plus about 20 singles), and I won a brand new case of 400 cassette tape cases for $45 (I still need to pay for it though).    Eating:  On Friday, I had pizza (from Dino's) that kicked ass and over the weekend, Mom made spaghetti and meatballs again.  Since then, I've been eating a lot of hamburgers. I've also been eating tuna fish, yellow rice, Little Debbie oatmeal cookies, tapioca pudding (low fat), and pork. I haven't had any soda except for the small Pepsi that Mom brought home the other night, just drinking iced tea, milk, and orange juice. I think I'm eating a little better lately and I'm definitely better off without the 2-liters of soda I'd normally be drinking.    Feeling:  Upbeat. Hopeful. Somewhat nervous too, anxious about getting a job.    Planning:  Planning on getting a job. That's #1 on my list.

        Getting Normal   The last two days, miraculously, I've gone to bed before midnight and I've gotten up around 8am... like a normal person! I just need to get a routine going and keep it going; going to bed and getting up at the same times each day. If I can do that, I can finally go out and get a daytime job (the sooner, the better).   Besides the money, I need to get a job to kill my boredom. It's so boring around here all day. I go from watching TV on the couch to playing around here on the PC, and then back to the couch, and then back to the PC, etc... in between, I eat and play with the cats. Sometimes, though not often enough, I play guitar.   Yawn.  At least I'm getting on the right track though, finally moving forward. I can take some consolation in that.

        Score!   I had another great win on eBay today, even better than my last one! I won a lot of nearly 100 cassette tapes for just $16 (includes shipping)! Six of them are still sealed! Some of the better titles in this lot are The Firm's "Mean Business",  Fishbone's "Truth and Soul", T Rex's "The Slider", Black Sabbath's "The Collection", Nirvana's "Incesticide", Steve Miller Band's "Greatest Hits - 74-78", Iron Maiden's "Powerslave", Ozzy Osbourne's "Speak Of The Devil", Eric Clapton' "Backtrackin", James "Laid", Living Color's "Times Up", R.E.M.'s "Green" & "Out Of Time", Metallica's "...And Justice For All" (sealed), Queen's "Greatest Hits" & "Classic Queen" (both sealed), and The Jayhawks' "Tomorrow The Green Grass" (sealed). The rest is a mixed bag of hard rock, metal, and alternative stuff (Judas Priest, WASP, Phish, Tom Waits, Billy Joel, Dinosaur Jr, The Cult, etc..). This is going to be a fun lot to go through! Woohoo!

         urlLink Monday Mission       1. Are you good at responding to emails and/or Blog comments?    Yes.   2. Does it make you crazy when people won't reply to your emails even though you know good and well that they are reading them?   I recently wrote to one person who never responded back, but then, my email could've been deleted since they don't know me. Perhaps they thought I was a spammer or something. It's no biggie. I get more angry with people who send a whole bunch of emails when they could say what they need to say in one. Or emails that start off with "dude, ..."   3. What's the most unusual thing you've had inside your body?   *cough*rectalthermometer*cough*   4. What person from your past would you most like to run into and visit with for an afternoon? Why them? What person would you like to not ever see again as long as you live? How come?   I would love to see Shane and Rosie again. They were a married couple who befriended me back in the '80's, before they moved to Texas. Great people. They opened my mind up in a lot of ways, let me know it was ok to go against the grain, to dismiss religion, and to speak my mind. I don't think I could ever thank them enough for that.    I never want to see my Stepmother again. After my Dad died, I asked for a couple of his things for myself: his coin box, where he kept the shrapnel they removed from him in Vietnam, and his baseball card collection. She basically called me greedy and selfish, and tried to make me feel bad for asking. It's not like I asked for any insurance money or any other money (he lived very well and had a healthy bank account). Besides, with the baseball cards, I helped put a lot of those sets together by trading my own cards to get cards that Dad needed, and a lot of those cards in Dad's collection were cards that I'd get for my birthdays and sent down to me from my grandmother in Pennsylvania. My Stepmother kept everything for herself. Well, ok, she didn't keep  everything , after all, she gave me his hankies, his socks, and a couple of his baseball caps. Ahhh... such cherished mementos... that rotten bitch.      5. What was the last bad meal you (or your special someone) paid too much for? What's the story there?   My sister's in-laws treated us all to Steak & Shake a year or two ago and we got terrible, shitty service. They screwed up my burger order and the waitress said she'd get it fixed for me, but she never did. She was just plain awful. Others in our party weren't very happy either. I haven't been back.    6. If out-of-the-blue you were forced to find a new career, if there was just suddenly no need for your field of expertise, just what job do you imagine you would seek out? Do you have any skills you can "fall back on?" (If you stay at home or are a student, adjust to fit your situation)    I don't exactly have a "career" going on now! Or a "field of expertise" either, for that matter. All I have is my music and my hobbies. I have a good ear for music and a keen eye for collectibles. That's about it.    7. If you were to open up your own restaurant, what would it be called and what type of food would you serve? Describe the "feel" of the place (the decor, the music, etc).    Hmmm... I've never thought about anything like that before. I don't think I can answer this one. I like too many kind of foods, so it would be impossible to pick just one type, plus I like different settings for different occasions, so that'd be too hard to decide too. How about... a chameleonesque restaurant? It would change it looks and menus from day to day or week to week. I'd call it "Schizophrenia", or just "Schizo's", for short.    BONUS: How long can you stand the heat?   Not very freakin' long... A/C, please, and  crank it !

        Ups & Downs   So... I wound up staying awake all night Saturday night, not going to bed until around 6:30pm on Sunday. We were supposed to have someone come over and fix our hallway floor and my Mom graciously told the guy, Earl, that I'd be up at 9am on Sunday. Now, I woke up at 5:30pm on Friday and 6pm on Saturday, so I have no idea why she would assume I'd be getting up at 9am on Sunday. Nonetheless, I had to stay up all day Sunday to accomodate him since my Mom would be at church from 9:30-Noonish.   He was supposed to be over sometime around 9-10am, but he didn't show up until well after Noon, long after my Mom got home from church. That didn't make me happy. I could've gone to bed and gotten a little sleep at least.   Earl and his wife, Laura, were here working the floor until after 6pm. They're a pretty talkative couple, nice people though. Earl plays guitar too, and Laura is a metal fan. I was telling her about seeing  urlLink Zebra  at Bourbon Street a few months back, so I went to show her the  urlLink Bourbon Street website  and lo and behold: Zebra is playing there again in October (on the 17th)! Woohoo! I am there, baby!   The question now is: will Sue be there?    While they were working on the floor, I was stuck out in the living room. When I wasn't talking to Earl and Laura, I was sitting here in front of the PC. I had actually blogged earlier in the day, but the post got lost when I opened a link and it opened in the blogger window instead of opening in a new window. Dammit.   I bid on and won a couple things on eBay today. One of the them was a lot of cassette tapes, about 80 of them, which I won for a grand total of $15.05 (includes shipping). Sweet! Some of the better titles in that lot are: AC/DC's "The Razor's Edge", Aerosmith's "Permanent Vacation", Blondie's "The Best of Blondie", The Cure's "Disintegration", "Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me", & "Mixed Up", David Bowie's "Let's Dance" & "The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars", Faith No More's "The Real Thing", Jane's Addiction's "Ritual De Lo Habitual", Led Zeppelin "IV",  Nine Inch Nails' "Pretty Hate Machine", Metallica's "Ride The Lightning", Nirvana's "Nevermind", R.E.M.'s "Eponymous" & "Out Of Time", Prince's "Purple Rain", and also, Temple Of The Dog's sole album. The rest is mostly New Wave stuff from the '80's (The Fixx, Flock of Seagulls, Devo, Depeche Mode, Bauhaus, Talking Heads, etc..) which I'm really looking forward to since I've never really listened to that stuff much. I can't believe the price though. For the cost of 1 brand new CD album, I got 60 cassette albums (approximately 20 of the 80 tapes I won are cassette singles... Guns 'N Roses, Queensryche, Billy Idol, etc..).   The other auction I won goes hand in hand with this one: a box of 400 unused cassette tape cases. Yay! No worrying about dirty, nasty, sticky, broken, cracked cases! I paid $45 for them, which is less than $0.12 per case. Not bad at all! The best part is that these are the clear/black ones, which are much harder to find than the clear/clear ones. I plan on buying many more cassettes lots on eBay (and maybe outside of eBay too), so they'll come in handy. I also plan on selling any doubles I get as well as tapes that I don't like, so it's good to have new cases around for that reason too. Who knows, they may pay for themselves someday.   When I get a job and start working, I'm going to start putting ads out for tapes. I figure I'll offer $0.25 each and see what I get. I would love going through collections and boxes of tapes to see what's there. It'd probably be like walking down memory lane for me since I used to have a very large tape collection myself back in the day. I probably had about 3,000 tapes in all.  Another cool thing about buying tapes, I could turn my niece and nephews on to a whole variety of music they'd never hear otherwise. I don't lend my CDs out, but I'd have no problem lending them my cassettes. Plus, any doubles I get, I can pass on to them if they want them. It'll be cool.  Anyhow, after Earl and Laura finished in the hallway, I went straight to bed. I was friggin' beat! Even so, I had a hard time falling asleep (I was hungry), and even after I fell asleep, I got up twice to pee. The second time I got up to pee, I stayed up. That was around 12:45am. Not a whole lotta sleep.   Strangely, Mom was still up, watching a Gene Kelly movie. She said Gene Kelly was "marvelous". It's unusual for her to be up so late, and it's even more unusual for her to describe something as "marvelous".   I had a bunch of auctions that ended tonight, while I was sleeping, so I sat up and sent out winner's notices to people. It took a lot longer than usual since I had so many auctions running this last week. Unfortunately, they didn't do too well. I lost money on all of them. In fact, one of the cards, which I paid $8 for (it books for $30), sold for just $1.78. Damned economy. To make matters worse, of that $1.78, I'll only get to keep about $0.95 after Paypal and eBay get their fees. Yay for me.      While I was sending out notices, I'd remembered again that I hadn't eaten since 9am (when Mom ran out for Dunkin' Donuts Croissants). I guess I did have a pretzel around 5pm, but no meal or anything. I cooked up 2 burgers and made a small salad. After that, I tried going to bed again, but that didn't last long. I started feeling warm, plus my mind is overactive again tonight (thinking about the future), and then I started playing guitar in bed, which didn't help either. So, I got out of bed again.   I guess I'm staying up as long as I can today. Hopefully, until 8pm or 9pm at least. I'm tired though, really feeling it, so I may go back down anytime, there's no telling. I'm such a freakin' mess.

        Work Sleep Work   I stayed up late pulling basketball cards for my auctions and went to bed around 4:30-5am. I was out of bed again by 7am. I just could not sleep. I worked on card stuff for awhile more before heading to bed again, sometime around 9am. I "slept" until 6pm. I tossed and turned and layed there awake more than I actually slept. I got out of bed feeling completely unrefreshed.    I wound up working on card stuff after getting up too. I scanned cards and listed auctions all night. I found some old Star Wars Finest cards that I had stored away for a couple of years and listed some of those too. I'd noticed, entirely by accident, that some of the Refractor parallels from that set were selling for up to $20.50 each, so I listed all 7 that I had.   Man, it would be nice if I was actually able to make enough to buy the amplifier I need. I'm sure I'll make just a little more than enough to pay my bills and that's all. Certainly not enough extra to do anything important with, probably enough to buy a CD or two and pay for my band rehearsals.   Like I've said 1,000 times in the last few months: I need to get a job.   But when?  I need to get a day job so I can make music at night, but I'm having a really rough time switching over to daytime hours. I don't remember it ever being so hard to do before, but it's kicking my ass now and keeping me from getting the job I so badly need. I don't know what the problem is. Most of the time, I just can't get comfortable enough or sleepy enough at night, but other times, I might be dead tired, totally beat, and I  still  can't fall asleep. I just don't know what the problem is. It's like my body won't let me sleep until the night is over and the day has begun. Maybe I'm a vampire and don't know it.   A big fat slacking vampire... Count Slackula.   "I vvvant... to suck... your blood... dude."   Whatever the problem, it is a  big  problem and I need to find some way to resolve it. I absolutely have to get a job, and fast.

         urlLink The Friday Five     1. How much time do you spend online each day?   Geez... a lot. Especially since I quit my job a couple months ago. I'd say about 5-6 hours a day, sometime even more. Some times,  much, much more .   Yes, I know I'm a loser. But I do run auctions online, so  some  of that time is working, it that lessens my loserocity.   Loserositude?   2. What is your browser homepage set to?   Google.com   3. Do you use any instant messaging programs? If so, which one(s)?   MSN Instant Messenger 6.0. I only talk to two people online, my friend Sue, and once in awhile, my niece.    4. Where was your first webpage located?   On WebTV. I wonder if it's still out there...   5. How long have you had your current website?   Since May of 2002.

        It's Official: I Suck!   I turned off the TV last night at 2am and fell asleep on the couch. Or, more accurately,  tried  to fall asleep on the couch. Sometime around 5:45am, as usual, I got up to pee. Then, I went to my own bed and tried to sleep. I had a really hard time falling asleep (between my sinuses, Stevie wanting pet, and the music running through my head), but I finally did.   When I woke up today, I heard cups or dishes rattling in the kitchen, a sure sign that Mom was home, and I thought maybe she stayed home from work, so I got up to see what was going on. She was home from work alright, but her workday was over.   Somehow, my sorry ass managed to stay in bed until 5:30pm.    I couldn't believe it. I stared at the clock and mumbled "You've got to be kidding". I guess all the days of little sleep caught up with me all at once. All that time spent awake, trying to get my sleep schedule reversed so I could finally start getting up in the morning (so I can finally go out and get a job), shot to hell overnight.   The really sad thing is that I still feel tired; not refreshed at all.   I really suck.

        Jam Night   I just got back from band rehearsal about 20 minutes ago... whew! We played for about 3 1/2 hours tonight, solid playing time, with about 40 minutes downtime betwen sets. Unfortunately, we didn't have Ronnie tonight (he had a health problem), but it didn't really hurt our sound to badly. We are really starting to come together. Some of JPs originals sounded better than I've ever heard them, and we did a decent job on most of the originals. We are starting to develope our own sound, noticable on covers like "Stuck In The Middle" (more upbeat and funky than the original) & "Love The One You're With" (more "rock", less "acoustic" than the original), which pleases me a great deal. I kept throwing out ideas and suggestions all night and JP was getting a bit weary of it, but after hearing some of the improvements I made, he changed his tune. We are starting to get some communication going too, which is great.   The not so great part: my solos. I really need to work on strengthening my solos. I wing them too much. I should develope a set solo for each song and wing it from there rather than having nothing planned each time out. Tonightit was worse than usual because Ronnie wasn't there, I had to wing solos that  he'd  normally take. Some of them though, "Rock This Town" and "Crazy Little Thing Called Love", with their Rockabilly solos, are  always  troublesome for me. I'm a blues player, a rock player, so the Rockabilly stuff feels really foreign to me. It doesn't come natural to me. I just need sit down and learn those solos note for note (or close enough). Grrrr!  We started off the night jammoing to one of my songs, the funky one with the E9 and bass lines. It sounded pretty darned good. I need to throw some lyrics on it and maybe we can work that one into our sets. We ran through all three sets tonight: set 1 (very strong), set 2 (not as strong) and part of set 3 (pretty strong). During one of the breaks we sat around and worked on the set lists some more, making them flow better. The guys are talking about playing out within the next month. I'm iffy on the idea. I don't think we're quite ready yet, but we might be in a few weeks. Also, we're supposed to record in the studio next month and I think we should finish that before we start doing gigs. I'm worried that we can't give both things 100%, and I don't want the studio stuff to suffer. I also have a problem not having my own amp yet. I really don't want to bring my little Peavey amp onstage with me, it's too puny. I might be able to borrow Al's Fender amp until I get a job and can buy my own amp.    Al, JP, and I are going to get together on Tuesday to do some 4-track recording at JPs and the whole band is going to get together again next Thursday (hopefully Ronnie will be back too). Things are moving along nicely.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  Well, as I mentioned, I rocked out to some Dio and Dokken yesterday (both were "best of" CDs) and I also played my Fleetwood Mac "Rumours" tape yesterday. I've been listening to my newest CDs as well: Zebra, Todd Barry, and Jake Johannsen (which I just got in today). I still have a speaker down on my stereo. I need to get it fixed as soon as I can afford it.     Watching on TV:  "The Simspons", "Everybody Loves Raymond", "Seinfeld", "The Daily Show", "Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn", "Real Time with Bill Maher", and that's about it. I've been busy with PC, not watching much TV. I tried watching Woody Allen's "Shadows and Fog" again this morning. I watched about a half an hour of it and I couldn't take any more of it. He's just not as funny as he used to be. He's more annoying than anything.   Downloading:  I downloaded some stuff from Prince ("The Black Album" and "The Gold Experience"... neither were very good, not worth buying), and a bunch of Steven Stills' Manassas stuff (I liked that a lot more). I also downloaded some Rodney Dangerfield and some Ween ("Pure Guava"), stuff I haven't heard before. I listened to a little bit of the Dangerfield album, liked what I heard, but I haven't listened to the Ween stuff yet (I love their "Chocolate & Cheese" album).   Playing:  I played a little Grand Theft Auto (the original) the other day. I finally got it back on my PC.   Reading:  I started "Moby Dick" last week but haven't picked it back up since. By the time I get to bed, the last thing I want to do is read. I need to make time for it again, by going to bed earlier.    Jamming:  Practice got cancelled last night, mutually, but I cancelled out tonight. We are still going to practice at Santana's warehouse on Thursday though, so at least we'll get some playing time in. JP said he's going to record the next practice on his 4-track.     Working:   I wanted to go out and put an application in at this place down the road (assembly/production work) on Monday, but it stormed all day Monday, and since then, I haven't been able to get my schedule normalized yet (it's a 9-4 job). Hopefully by Friday I'll have my shit together and be able to put an application in.     Buying:  The other day I ordered Jake Johannsen's "Live At Cobbs" CD off CD Baby and that's all I've bought this week. It was more expensive than I liked ($19 and some change) but I've been a fan of Jake's comedy for years and I'm glad to have his CD in my collection.   Eating:  Mom made a killer roast yesterday, with potatoes and carrots... it ruled. I've been eating tuna fish a lot lately, which is really different for me, usually followed by one or two Little Debbie oatmeal cookies (to kill the fish taste). I haven't had soda all week. I'm going to try and eliminate it from my diet as much as possible.    Feeling:  Like absolute shit.   Planning:  The same old stuff: get sleep schedule on track, get a job, buy the equipment I need, lose weight, and on and on and on. All long term stuff. I don't have any immediate plans except to go jam tomorrow, do laundry, and clean the house (especially my room).

        Wednesday... So Far   I just can't catch a break. I went to bed around 1:30am and just could ... not ... sleep. I know I was still wide awake at 3am, and I was out of bed at 6:30am, and in between, I may have dozed off here and there, but I would not call any of it "sleep". I went back to bed around 8:30am and "slept" until noon. By "slept", I mean I set the alarm clock for 10am, eventually fell asleep sometime around 9:30am, then woke up and re-set if for Noon. I may have had a grand total of 2 hours sleep all night. I am so messed up.    Part of my sleep problem is that I am a night owl by nature, and forcing myself to go to bed early is very unnatural to me. Another part of the problem is my stupid bed, with it's uncomfortable spring mattress (sometimes it'll feel like I'm laying on something but there's nothing there). Another part of the problem is my bad back, which makes getting comfortable a problem. Yet another problem is Stevie, one of my cats, who sleeps with me at night. He's always wanting pet, and when he does finally settle down, I'm always concious of where he's at (I don't want to roll over on him), so I'm never 100% asleep. Still another part of my sleep problem are my sinuses/allergies. Last night was especially bad, with one side of my head all stuffed up. Also, temperatures mess with me badly. It's either too hot or too cold, hardly ever is it exactly right, nice and comfortable. Is it any wonder I'm so messed up?   So... I called JP and cancelled for tonight. He wanted to go over his place and do some recording (me, him, and Al) on his digital 4-track recorder, but I just can't do it tonight.   I feel like crap.

        My Tuesday (Part II)   So... I did no cleaning and no laundry, but I did rock out. I threw on Dio and Dokken CDs and finished (well,  nearly  finished)  urlLink my Music Collection page . It took several hours to do. I now have all of my (non-Hendrix) CDs and cassettes listed, now I just need to list my cassette singles (cassingles... ick) and my LPs and then it's all done.  urlLink My Hendrix list  is still unfinished too (what a job  that  is).   No practice tonight. Al had to work late, JP was iffy and I don't feel well (between my allergies, the heat in the house, and my sleep schedule, I'm wiped out), so we called it off. We may get together on Wednesday and go to JPs for some recording. That means I'll definitely need to practice before we meet. Probably not tonight though.   As I said, it is  hot  in this mutha, 85 degrees (and probably hotter near the windows). The A/C has been on all day and night (it usually is), but it just can't keep up with the heat. We need a new home with new duct work and insulation, this place is screwed.   I guess I'm not going to do anything the rest of the night except play on the PC and watch TV. I can't wait until bedtime though, I'm ready.

        My Tuesday... So Far   Well, I didn't go to bed at midnight like I'd wanted, rather, it was about 1am when I hit the sack. I got out of bed at about 7:30am this morning. Between the time I went to bed and the time I got up, I'd been out of bed twice (to pee) and had several odd dreams.   One of the dreams I remember had me and Mom driving down what looked like some rural highway. She was driving, but I reached out at a steering wheel in front of me and asked her why it was there. "Don't touch that!" she screamed, just as I touched it and it fell apart. Next, she drove up into a lot full of run-down rusty old tin buildings and had me, on the sly, throw the parts in there, to get rid of them. Oddly, "the parts" now seemed to be just an antenna. As me and Mom were leaving the lot (or  a lot ), I saw my friend Billy, who was apparently using one of the buildings as a rehearsal studio. He called me over to talk and I told Mom I'd be a few minutes and Billy talked to me about music (he's finally serious about playing and seems to have moved back away from country music). He then introduces me to his two bandmates (he didn't have a drummer yet), who appeared to be Asian brothers, as they set-up their equipment. Mom is bitching that she's been waiting "three hours!", so I tell Bill that I have to go. Before we leave, I give him a Music magazine that I pulled from the backseat, open to the musician's classifieds section and give it to him, so he can find his drummer. Next thing I know, Mom and I are crossing the street on foot (I have no idea why we are out of the car), when down the road coming at us is a speeding vehicle carrying half of a three-story house.  It is out of control and coming right at us. I yell "Run!" or something to Mom and we make for the other side of the street (where I think the car might be now) as the house spills off the vehicle and comes hurling at us, smashing everything in it's path with a terrible force. For a moment it looked as if it was going to hit us, but it just missed us and slammed into a bunch of those rusty buildings instead. Following the first vehicle with half a house is another one with the other half and it too is out of control. This one comes hurtling off as well and appears to slam into a shopping center up in the distance. I hear screams and reports that a lot of people have died. Somewhere around here I wake up.   Not exactly "sweet dreams". Very odd stuff.  As I said, I got up around 7:30am, went to the bathroom, came back and threw my new Zebra CD on ("No Tellin' Lies" & "3.V", remastered, on 1 CD). I checked out stuff on the PC for a bit and then I made an omelette.   I learned something new today: broccoli doesn't belong in an omelette. I fried up some mushrooms, whipped up some eggs, and then I tried something new: I added broccoli to my omelette. It wasn't very good. It wasn't bad either, it was just... weird, like it didn't belong there. Even with the cheddar cheese, it just tasted odd. I ruined one of my favorite cups this morning too, the big purple insulated one. I put in it in the microwave trying to make some tea and it got nuked. It's totally mangled now. What a mess.    I've been waiting for JP to come by, he was supposed to drop off his equipment this morning as he, Al, and I getting together over here tonight for more practice. It's 9:30 and he hasn't shown up yet. I guess he's not coming by. I hope he hasn't forgotten about practice tonight. I need to practice badly. I haven't played since Thursday night. I really need to get into the habit of practicing everyday. I don't want to be the weak spot in the band, which is how I feel right now.   I'm planning on doing some cleaning and some laundry today. I have the house to myself and can work in peace and quiet (actually I'll be rocking out, so screw quiet), so I guess there are some advantages to getting up early! I'm up at a decent time again, if I can maintain it and keep getting up at the same time everyday, I can start looking for a job soon (which I desperately need).    More later tonight.

        My Monday   Monday was as bad as Sunday for me, maybe worse. I went to bed around 3:30 Sunday morning and layed in bed, awake, for almost 4 hours. I may have nodded off for a moment, I'm not sure, but by 7:30am I got out of bed, tired of tossing and turning and sweating. She said she didn't, but I think my Mom must have messed with the thermostat over the weekend. It doesn't take much of a temperature change to make me uncomfortable. Anyhow, I got up around 7:30am and stayed up until 2:30 pm. I just couldn't stay up any longer. I did nothing worthwhile all day long, mostly playing around on the PC. I did break away from the PC long enough to watch "The Last Castle" though, finally, but I missed the first 10 minutes of it. It was an ok movie. A little too unbelievable in some parts, but Redford was great. I played guitar in bed for awhile before finally falling asleep sometime around 3-3:30pm. I had hoped to sleep until midnight at least. Instead, I was out of bed at 8pm, feeling all groggy and shit. Mom was already gone (doing her church stuff) but she left an Arbys potato on the counter for me, so I cooked up 2 plain hamburgers and chowed down. Man, that was good. Then, I parked my fat ass back in front of the PC and half-watched the Denis Leary Roast again (don't ask me why). That just ended and I am still sitting in front of the PC. I still feel groggy and shitty and I can't wait until midnight, when I am going to hit the sack. Man, am I fucked up or what?

         urlLink Monday Mission     1. Have you ever been looking forward to something so badly that you were just crushed when it never happened?   That is the story of my life. It's happened so many times, the incidents have all blended together to become the continual letdown that is my life.    2.Have you ever been told about a wonderful present that you were never given? Maybe they went as far as telling you exactly what it was, how wonderful it would be and how much they would have loved for you to have it, but for whatever reason, they wouldn't be giving it to you after all? How did you feel about that?    When I was a teenager, around 16, and lived with my Dad, he told me he was going to get me my first car and teach me how to drive. It was supposed to be an old Chevy, a '57, I think (it wasn't important to me what kind of car it was), maybe even a fixer-upper that we could work on together. It never happened. He never got me that car. He never got me any car, and he never taught me to drive. How did I feel? After 18 years, and after my Dad'd death about 12 years ago, I still feel hurt and betrayed. Had he done that for me, helped me get a car and taught me to drive, there's no telling how my life would've turned out. My guess is that it would have turned out for the better, since I'm 34 and have never had a car or a driver's license.   3. What is the longest time you've ever kept a secret from someone, or, are you still keeping it? How did it feel to keep it so long? Can you think of a situation you were in where a secret should never have been told?   That's the thing about secrets, you tell it and it's no longer a secret. Next question.    4. Have you ever been lied to by someone you trust with all your heart? How did it feel when you found out that trust had been broken?   I've had my trust broken a few times with a few people. I think every one has experienced that at some time. What's there to say about it except "it hurt my feelings"? There's not much you can do to avoid that situation except to guard your secrets, your confidence, and your heart better.     5. When, if ever, is it acceptable to tell a lie? Are "white lies" any different than the "real whoppers"?   I generally don't make it a practice to lie. I'm a pretty open person and I'm usually very honest. The only times I  do  lie are when someone else's feelings may be hurt or to avoid hassles.    6. How are you on forgiveness? Are you able to easily forgive someone who's hurt you?   I may forgive, but I never forget. It's like that old saying goes: "Burn me once, shame on you. Burn me twice, shame on me".    7. What song gets your feet going and your energy flowing?   There are so many, it'd be impossible for me to name just one. Let's just say "hard rock" does it for me.    BONUS: Why not come dancing?   Uh, because I don't, and I won't.

        My Sunday   I finally went to bed last night sometime around 4am. I put my new Todd Barry CD on, got into bed, threw on the headphones, and laughed my ass off in the darkness. I was worried that my mom would hear my laughing in there, in the silence, and think I had gone nutso. Man, that CD was great. I wound up listening to the whole thing  twice , before falling asleep sometime after daylight. It had been raining when I got into bed and it was still raining when I finally turned the stereo off and tried to sleep. I played guitar for a little bit too, and of course, Stevie came in and wanted pet a few times as well, so I have no idea what time I actually fell asleep. If I had to guess, I'd say it was around 8am. I got up around 2pm and had some lunch (tuna fish), and then I layed on the couch and pet Stevie awhile. I was starting to get drowsy and eventually, I went back to bed again. I stayed down until 7pm. I got up and went to the bathroom with today's newspaper. After a bit, Mom had dinner ready and we choweed down. It was a really good dinner. She bought T-Bone steaks, broiled them, cooked up some fresh broccoli, and bought potatoes at Arbys to go with everything. Man, it was good! By the time I finished dinner, it was 8pm and time to list auctions on eBay. I didn't have any scanning to do this time, it was all re-lists (re-listing items that didn't sell before) and I got 110 of them up. By the time I finished with that, the Denis Leary Roast was on Comedy Central and I went and watched it. It wasn't as good as most of the roasts I'd seen. Pretty disappointing, actually. I eventually walked away from the TV and worked on my blog a bit. And then, well... this is then, I mean now... whatever. It's 1:30am and I should be heading to bed but I'm not really tired. I'm not really anything. I just am. And that was my Sunday.

        "A Mighty Wind": My Review   When "A Mighty Wind" first came out earlier this year, I'd wanted to go see it very, very badly. Unfotunately,  no one else I knew wanted to go see it with me. Also, it was only playing in out-of-town theaters (it had a limited release), so I wound up missing out on it altogether.   Until now.   I'd downloaded it awhile back and finally decided to watch it tonight, instead of doing the smart thing and going to bed at a decent hour.   I'm glad I stayed up.   What a great movie! Christopher Guest did it again! Bravo! He is the absolute master of the "mockumentary" (a term I hear he detests). After co-starring in (and co-writing) "This Is Spinal Tap" (the original "mockumentary"), he went on and co-wrote (with Eugene Levy) and directed "Waiting For Guffman" and "Best In Show", two highly enjoyable movies. And now, he does it again with "A Mighty Wind". Like all of his films, the humor is laid back, subtle, and very clever. "Sublimely hilarious" would be an apt description of all three films. As always, this movie features a talented ensemble cast, bringing to life a host of fresh, funny, and often, wacky characters. Fred Willard, in particular, had me in stitches ("Wha' happened!?!). Besides all of that, this movie features some truly great folk music as well, created by, and performed by, the cast members themselves. I've been wanting to pick up the soundtrack for this film since it first came out. There are some really nice, catchy folk songs on there! Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara's folk ballads are especially good. They made some gorgeous music together, folks.   When I get a DVD player, this is a definite purchase. I'd highly recommend this movie to anyone who can appreciate subtle humour, but if you're looking for dick jokes and wisecracks, this one ain't for you.

        In Limbo   In limbo, that's right, somewhere between night and day.  So... I  almost  stayed up all day. D'oh! I wound up going to my room around 5pm and read for awhile (I started "Moby Dick") before falling asleep sometime around 6pm. But then, I out of bed again around 10:30pm, and am still up (obviously) which kind of screws everything up. I guess I'm going to try going to bed again shortly, but I don't know how well I'll be able to sleep. I feel pretty shitty right now, really groggy. Ugh!  I finished reading Stephen King's "Different Seasons" this afternoon... very good book. I'd recommend it almost any  mature  reader (not for the kiddies). Here's a fun fact: three out of the four novellas in this book have become movies. Other than the Bible, has there any other book that has spawned three different movies? The movies made from this book are "Stand By Me", "The Shawshank Redemption", and "Apt Pupil". I've never seen the latter movie, but the other two were great.   Man... I'm tired.   On Sunday, I'll need to list cards on eBay (got bills to pay), so I'll need to be able to stay up until 11pm tomorrow. But, I also need to go out job hunting on Monday, so I'll need to be up in the morning too. It's pretty important that I get out of limbo and into a "normal" schedule  a.s.a.p . I'm a night person by nature, so it's always been a bitch for me to stick to a "normal" schedule. I can do it when I have to, but I need to do it everyday or else I fall back into my night-owl ways. I just don't operate like a normal human being.   OK, I feel like I am beginning to ramble now, so I'll be ramblin' on.

I'm trying to stay up all day again (I failed miserably yesterday), at least until 9pm or 10pm. Secondly, I'm bored shitless and I need something to do to keep me awake. It's been raining all morning/afternoon and I am super tempted to just go to bed, snuggle up in some warm blankets and go nitey nite. Thirdly, stop asking me stupid questions, voice in my head, or I'll hit you with a brick.

        Just Say No... To Howard Dean   I've come to the conclusion that Howard Dean is definitely not the right person for the job of  President of The United States. I looked into his positions on the issues and I was turned off right away at his pro-gun, pro-NRA stance on the gun problem in America (a non-issue to Dean). Over 30,000 Americans die because of gun-related deaths every year but Dean doesn't even consider it a real issue. It's disgraceful, if you ask me. Then, the other day, he was caught in a blatant lie, a blatant attempt at telling people what they want to hear just to get their votes. He tells union supporters that he has no interest in raising the retirement age, but that doesn't jibe with what he's said in the past. Here is what he said to the union folk:   "I have never favored Social Security retirement at the age of 70, nor do I favor one of 68."  - Howard Dean at  the AFL-CIO Democratic presidential candidate forum, Aug. 5, 2003   And here's what he's said in the past:   "The way to balance the budget, Dean said, is for Congress to cut Social Security, move the retirement age to 70, cut defense, Medicare and veterans pensions, while the states cut almost everything else. 'It would be tough but we could do it,' he said."  News story on a breakfast meeting Dean held with reporters by Miles Benson, Newhouse News Service, March 3, 1995   And more of the same:   "I absolutely agree we need to reduce theI mean, to increase the retirement age. There will be cuts and losses of some benefits, but I believe that Sen. Packwood is on exactly the right track."  Howard Dean on CNN's Crossfire, Feb. 28, 1995   And the not-so-past:   "Just six weeks ago, Dean told NBC, 'I would also entertain taking the retirement age up to 68.' "  Deborah Orin, "Is Dean Being Honest? Well, Define 'Honest,' " New York Post, Aug. 8, 2003   Besides all that, he seems to support prayer in public schools, something I am dead set against, and he is wishy washy on a lot of issues, preferring to let the states handle the problems themselves, which isn't always good. Is this the guy we want as our leader? I don't want him, that's for sure. I'm still very much for Dennis Kucinich, but I had considered Dean as a "backup", in case Kucinich can't garner enough support to win the nomination. Now I'm going to focus more on Bob Graham or Dick Gephart as my backup candidates.   Howard Dean may be the Democratic frontrunner right now, but for me, he's out of the running.  Of course, if I had to choose between him and having Bush back in office, he'd be back in the running again.  Sometimes, you just have go with the lesser of two evils.

        Hypocrisy, Arrogance, & Death   I went to  urlLink FARK  today and saw  urlLink yet another infuriating article  that makes me even more angry with my government (if that is even possible at this point). Apparently, the U.S. used "napalm-like" firebombs over in Iraq, and our military has the gall to defend their usage.   Freaking napalm... unbelievable.   Don't get me wrong now, I understand that war is hellish by nature, it's not a pretty thing and there are plenty of horrible deaths incurred in any war, but napalm? Come on! We make a big deal out of the way Saddam Hussein tortured people and yet, it's ok for us to use a weapon designed to cause the most extreme, excruciating pain imaginable?   For those who don't know, napalm is a gooey mix of melted styrofoam and gasoline. If you get hit with napalm, you burn.... and you burn, and burn and burn. It doesn't come off you and you can't really estinguish it. It's a horrific way to die, and for those who aren't lucky enough to die right away, it has to be the worst pain imaginable.   I just don't get it. How can we, as Americans, as people who are supposed to be concerned with Human Rights, allow our military to use such nasty weapons? The hypocrisy is maddening. I am totally understanding why we are so hated in the world. We tell nations to do as we say, not as we do. We punish other nations for breaking the rules while we do as we damn well please. America is the most powerful nation on the face of the Earth, but we are also the most arrogant.   And it just isn't the napalm, it's many things. For instance, the massive bombs that were dropped (also during the war), on a crowded restaurant in hopes of nailing Hussein. It took awhile to sink in before I realized just what that really meant. We wiped out a lot of civilians in the hopes of killing one man. Wiped them out. Killed, injured, mutilated, maimed, burned, destroyed... men, women, children, babies... to get one man... who, as it turned out, wasn't even there when the bombs fell. How arrogant is that? Terrorists kill our civilians and it's a worldwide tragedy, but we killed Iraqi civilians like they were nothing, like they didn't even exist, like their lives didn't matter because they weren't Americans.   It's sickening.   I'm sickened.   I have never been more ashamed of my government, of my country, than I have since Bush and his fascist cronies (don't even get me started on Rumsfeld and Ashcroft) took over.   I love America, but I do not like what we are doing or the direction we are headed.

         urlLink The Friday Five     1. What's the last place you traveled to, outside your own home state/country?   Unfortunately, the last place I traveled to was the 1982 World's Fair in Knoxville, Tennessee. It's unfortunate because I love traveling but haven't done it for over 20 years. Man... just thinking about that makes me sad.    2. What's the most bizarre/unusual thing that's ever happened to you while traveling?   One year, when I was a kid, we went up to Pennsylvania during Christmastime. One day, during that vacation, I was outside, all by myself, sitting in a tree at my Grandparent's house, just looking at the asnow on the hills and cornfields and enjoying the solitude. When I tried to get down from the tree, I slipped and my foot got caught between two limbs and I was left hanging upside down. I couldn't quite touch the ground below, and, because of the winter clothes, I wasn't able to reach back up to the tree limbs. I tried to get myself out of this situation for awhile, but it was hopeless. I was helpless. Everyone else was in the house and there wasn't anyone around to help me, so I did the only thing I could do at that point and scream for help. I really felt stupid having to do that, and I felt even more so after my Dad had to come outside and rescue me. I had yelled for awhile before he came out and was starting to get worried, so I was quite relieved when he came out and freed me from the tree, even though I felt like a moron. Everyone got a good laugh out of my dilemma, including me.    3. If you could take off to anywhere, money and time being no object, where would you go?   Europe. More specifically, I would love to visit Italy (Venice, Rome, and Florence), England (London), Ireland, Scotland, and Greece (Athens and Crete). I don't care much for France, but I would love to see the palace of "The Sun King" in Versailles. I think I'd have to hit Amsterdam, and there are places in Spain I'd like to visit as well.   Hell, if money and time we no object, I'd want to see it all, baby!   4. Do you prefer traveling by plane, train or car?   One of the best things about traveling is getting to see the places you're traveling through firsthand, up close. Cars are the best for doing that, so I'd say car travel would be preferable.   I've never traveled by train, but I'd like to, someday.    5. What's the next place on your list to visit?   I'm someone who would go anywhere, anytime, if given the opportunity. However, at this time, I have no car and no money, so I have no list.

        Still Up   Well, I had planned on going to bed early, but that never happened. In fact, I still haven't slept yet. I went to bed and read more of "Different Season's", the Stephen King book, and before I knew it, it was daylight out. After awhile more, it began lightning pretty bad and it got me out of bed. It's raining right now, not pouring or anything, but the lightning is extremely loud and sounds very close. I have mushrooms frying on the stove, the beginnings of a kickass omelette, so I guess I'm staying up awhile longer. All day, most likely. That's fine with me, I need to get my sleep schedule normalized so I can get a job. I plan on going out on Monday and applying at this place down the road that's hiring for production work. Man... that lighting  is  very close! Damn! I'm outta here... I have eggs to cook anyway.

        Why The RIAA Sucks Ass: A Breakdown   Rather than going to bed early, as I'd planned, I went and downloaded a bunch of music instead; music that they don't play on the radio (in my area, anyway), and music I wouldn't have been able to hear otherwise. To me, the fact that the RIAA wants to stop me from doing what I did is proof that they are a bunch of total nimrods. It's a great tool for consumers to discover new music and every argument against it is just arrogance and/or ignorance. Let's face it, most radio stations suck and you will hear more music during an elevator ride than you would in a whole night of watching MTV. Hell, had it not been for word of mouth between fellow music lovers, I probably wouldn't have ever discovered these bands in the first place: The Mooney Suzuki and Queens Of The Stone Age. My friend Rob told me about The Mooney Suzuki and I downloaded stuff from them before and liked what I heard, but it's been so long since I heard them, I felt I had to give them another listen. I am  definitely  going to be buying their CD "Electric Sweat". It rocks. I heard my bandmate Al mention Queens Of The Stone Age tonight (we were talking about Dave Grohl) and then I found that Mark Lanegan (from The Screaming Trees) sang on some of their stuff and I had to have a listen. I've only listened to 2 songs so far, but I like what I've heard and may buy eventually buy all of their CDs.   See that, RIAA? See how it works? It's  to your benefit , you ignorant a-holes.    More namecalling? Ok: the RIAA are a bunch of stupid arrogant turds.   There is no reason a CD should cost nearly $20. None whatsoever. If they would only take their heads out of their asses for a moment, they would see that they could cut back on certain expenses and pass the savings on to the consumer. What costs am I referring to? How about the free CDs they send to every record store for "in store play"? I have several friends who work in record stores and they've all told me what I already knew: the vast majority of those CDs  do not get played . They get sold on eBay by the people who work in those stores. Cut those out, and then, how about this idea: stop the lawsuits against music lovers. They could save tons of money, money that would have been spent towards pointless litigation. Pointless, because it will not end filesharing. In fact, in the end, it will only serve to strengthen public hatred towards the Recording Industry.    I think it's safe to say the RIAA is already on shaky ground with the public anyway.   People are tired of being gouged for music that they love. Charging $18 for a single CD is ridiculous. You should be able to buy a whole CD for $10 (or less). Also, I've heard a lot of people complain that most CDs today  suck  and aren't worth the $18 price tag. There are also a ton of people out there who only like certain songs; they're not going to buy whole CD no matter what, and the RIAA is completely ignoring them... ignoring an entire market! The "singles" market in America seemed to have faded away with 45's and "cassingles", but the demand for "the hit song" did never went away. The RIAA doesn't listen to consumers and now they're paying the price for their arrogance and/or ignorance. They don't seem to be willing to make any compromises with the CD buying public, so the CD buying public has made their own changes.   Enter CD-Rs.  Personally, I don't support people who make burns of CDs they like  instead of  of buying the CDs they like. I do think it's ok to download a CD in order to listen to it a few times in order to see whether it's worth buying or not, but ultimately, you have to buy the CDs of bands you like in order to keep those bands signed to a label. If they don't sell many CDs, they won't be putting out too many more records. It's very simple to understand.   Call it a Catch-22.  People want to support their favorite artists, but many, myself included, would rather not support the RIAA anymore. They've made it abundantly clear how they feel about we consumers. Unfortunately, the RIAA holds the copyrights, so no matter how much people hate the RIAA, they have to be included in any viable solution. If they choose to hear the public finally, they would cut the costs of CDs in stores an they would create an inexpensive download site so people could download individual songs if they choose. Hell, they could even have a machine in every record store that would burn and properly label CDs filled with songs of the buyers choice. All they'd need is a music database to select from and a professional quality CD burner/packaging machine.   It's quite clear to me: the RIAA should be investing their time and money in computers and fresh ideas, not in lawyers and pointless lawsuits. As rich and as powerful as they are, they should be on top of the technology game, not impeding it's progress.   But hey, it's like I said before: the RIAA are a bunch of stupid arrogant turds.   And that's probably an understatement.  So endeth my rant for today.   Onward, to bed...

        Thursday   Today (Thursday) was a mixed bag for me. It started off badly, very early Thursday morning before I'd went to bed, with my PC screwing up. I downloaded Zone Alarm when I had that hacker scare last week, but I'd forgotten that removing Zone Alarm isn't as simple as clicking "Uninstall". It removes a few key files along with it, screwing up my Norton Anti-virus and system restore functions. I ran a system restore before I went to bed and it looked like it had resolved everything, but when I got up this afternoon and tried to get online, my computer wouldn't even let me get to the desktop. I had to keep booting and re-booting over and over, going in and out of safe mode, constantly ending up at the Windows blue error screen (the blue screen of death), but finally, I got to my regular desktop. I uninstalled Norton and later re-installed it, but it's still not letting me do a Live Update, so I have limited virus protection right now. I'm not very happy at all. I think I'm going to have to wipe my freaking hard drive again. I'm sick and tired of having to wipe my hard drive every few months. It's really pissing me off. I need to get a job and then get a completely new computer, loaded, and with the best, most up-to-date software I can afford.   For a few hours tonight, I got away from the computer bullshit and jammed with the band over at Santana's. Jimmy missed the first 2 hours of practice, so we had no drummer for most of the night, which sucked ass. We did ran through a bunch of covers and some of JP's songs, but everything felt like it was lacking something (it was: drums). When Jimmy finally showed up, we ran through a bunch of covers (including "Authority Song", "The Middle", "Rock This Town", "Feelin' Alright". "Go Your Own Way", "Can't You See", and "You May Be Right") and JP's "Opportunity Knocks" before we quit for the night. I'd never played it with the band before, but "Go Your Own Way" turned out really, really well. I was pleasantly surprised. I'm still not sold on Jimmy though. He's a decent drummer and all, but he just doesn't have enough time to spare for the band. We all want to start playing together twice a week, but he's the only one who can't do it. What happens if we start getting some gigs? We can only play one gig a week? Does that mean practices are out then? It's not a good situation. In the meantime, Al, JP, and I are going to keep practicing over here on Tuesdays like we've been doing, but it just isn't the same and we just aren't progressing as quickly without a drummer.   I think I'm going to bed early tonight (early for  me  anyhow); I have a monster headache.

         urlLink Wednesday What-Ifs     1. What if you were offered the opportunity to have an operation that would increase your intelligence, but noticeably decrease your level of happiness?   No thanks. I'd rather be happy and content than a super genius.    2. What if you had to choose between an operation that would leave you without hands, or an operation that would leave you with no feet?   I need my hands to play guitar, to type, to use the remote control... for almost everything. All I use my feet for are for walking and playing "this little piggie".   3. What if you had to decide whether to risk your life and give a kidney to a dying relative whom you've never met, but whose kidneys match yours exactly?   Hmmm.. that's a toughie. I'd probably say "no". Voluntary surgery like that isn't something you do for just anyone. I mean, there are people out there now who need kidneys and I'm not standing in line waiting to give one away.    4. What if you could have an operation that would allow you to morph into any animal at will, but would steal your ability of human speech?   That sounds like a fair trade off. I could soar like an eagle  as an eagle,  but I couldn't talk? Sign me up. I would probably be a bird right off the bat, but then I'd want to be a cougar for awhile.    5. What if you could have an operation to change one thing about yourself -- what would it be?    I'd request a reverse-cashectomy, where the surgeon would implant loads of cash into my checking account. Actually, if I could have an operation to change one thing about me it would be a stomach staple operation, to make me lose weight.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  I had Matthew Sweet's "Girlfriend" cassette on today (a great album). I played Bill Cosby's "Himself" cassette the other night, at bedtime.    Watching on TV:  "Home Improvement", "Everybody Loves Raymond". "Seinfeld", "The Daily Show", "Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn", "Real Time with Bill Maher", CNN, "Larry King Live" (he had Howard Dean on... I'm still not sold on him), and, over the weekend, I watched me some Bull Riding.     Downloading:  The other day I downloaded two songs to show Jess on guitar, but other than those two, I haven't been downloading anything lately.    Gaming:  I played a little bit of Deer Hunter last night... very boring game.    Reading:  I finished Howard Stern's "Miss America" book yesterday and started Stephen King's "Different Seasons" last night. The first short story in the King book, "Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption", was great. Now I want to see the movie again! I wasn't too thrilled with the Stern book though. I remember enjoying his first book, "Private Parts", when I read it a couple years ago, but this one seemed much cruder and Howard seemed even more full of himself than ever before. I was glad to have finished it. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone but die-hard Stern fans.   Jamming:  We (JP, Al, and I) got together over here tonight and worked on songs for a few hours. I hadn't practiced since last Thursday (because of having Jesse down) and Al said he hadn't either, so a lot of time was spent going over what we went over last week. We didn't get much accomplished this time out, but the way I see it, any practice time together is beneficial. We're getting together again on Thursday too, with Jimmy (drums), Santana (percussion) and Ronnie (sax/flute) backing us. JP is going to push the studio time back a month or so. We just aren't ready yet.    Working:  No job, no prospects, not really looking yet. I need one bad though.   Buying:  I splurged and bought a couple CDs online last night: Zebra's "No Tellin' Lies/3.V" (2 on 1 CD... hard to find around here) for $14 (includes shipping), and Todd Barry's "Medium Energy" (which is only available off  urlLink his website ) also for $14 (including shipping).   Oh, and I just bought a Crocodile Hunter  urlLink "Danger Ware" card  (it contains an actual piece of his khaki uniform on the card) for $7. I know... I'm a dork. What can I say? The Croc Hunter kicks ass.    Eating:  Ugh! All weekend while Jesse was here it was junk food day and night: lots of donuts, lots of ice cream, and lots of soda. Since he left, I've been chowing down on Muenster Cheese and Roast Beef (too lazy to make a sandwhich, so I just ate it by itself), waffles, and ham, egg, and cheddar cheese omelettes. I have some Root Beer left and a little bit of Pepsi, and as soon as they're gone: no more sodas for me (at home anyway).    Feeling:  I'd been feeling like shit up until this afternoon (3pm), when I got out of bed feeling alright. I was even woken up before noon by the lawn people mowing outside my window, but I still got out of bed feeling good. Go figure...   Planning:  We're probably going to start playing out in September, so I need to get an amp. Therefore, I will need to get a job. That is my main focus right now: get a job.

         urlLink (A very late) Monday Madness      1. What's a situation in your life that you felt totally unsure in, or lacking in confidence in?    I'd never really worked with or around tools before I started working as a machine operator running CD packaging machines, and I never really felt comfortable doing it. The actual machine operating work I was ok with, but it took awhile before I got somewhat comfortable tinkering with the machines. Unfortunately, the bosses there liked feeling superior over the employees so they made it an even more uncomfortable environment.   2. What aspect of your life do you feel that you have the most confidence in dealing with?    I'm a musician and I feel very confident arranging music. I'm not the best guitar player or songwriter out there, but I have a good ear for music and I'm secure in that.    3. Is there any one outfit you own that when you wear it, you feel totally confident or able to take on the world?   I'm a fat guy, so anything loose-fitting and dark works for me, but I never ever feel totally confident or like I'm able to take on the world. The world kicks my ass regularly.

         urlLink Monday Mission     1. When you take a vacation, do you ever suffer from Internet withdrawal? Or maybe the nagging urge to blog or read blogs? Or are you glad to be away?   I haven't had the opportuntity to go away, so I can't answer this one.   2. Have you ever been "furloughed" (told to take time off work without pay) or laid off? How did that impact your family dynamics? Your finances? If not to you, have you seen it happen to anyone you know? How did they handle it?   I've quit jobs, but I've never been laid off, so again, I can't really answer this one. I've heard about it happening to people I know, but I don't know how they handled it since they weren't close friends.    3. If you fell on hard times, what is are some non-essential reoccurring luxury expenses (cable TV, TiVo subscription, cigarettes, high-speed net connection, newspaper, daily Starbucks coffee, etc.) you would give up to save money?    When money is tight, like it usually is for me, I usually just quit buying stuff. I usually don't go out or do anything either, so that cuts down on expenses.    4. On the same thought, what is the one non-essential expense you would NOT give up?   Cable/cable modem. If I don't go out or do anything, at least I have something here to keep me occupied.    5. Would you ever ask your family (parents, in-laws, relatives) for financial assistance? What would be some of your concerns about asking for help? Have you ever asked for it before? Did it go well?   My Mom helps me when I need help (and when she can), and I've borrowed money from my sister before, on rare occasion (always paid her back right away), but I never asked my Dad for a cent.     6. Has a friend or relative ever borrowed money from you? Who were they and how much did they want? Did you ever get paid back, or did it matter? Did you feel compelled to keep an eye on them to see if they spent it wisely?   My sister and mother have borrowed money from me too, yes. I don't remember how much, sometimes a little, sometimes a lot. If I have it, I don't have a problem with lending it. They always paid me back. The only time I got burnt lending someone money was when a friend of mine and his pregnant wife came to me for help. I got screwed out of a couple hundred on that one. He gave me years of run-arounds and hassles before I finally said "fuck it". He is no longer a friend of mine.    7. Imagine you won a tax-free gift of $7,000. The only stipulation on the gift is that it must not be invested or saved, and must be spent before 2004. How would you use the money?   I would buy two new guitars, a Fender Strat and an Epiphone SG (@ $600 each), a Marshall combo amp for playing clubs with (around $700), and some pedals and pedal upgrades (around $800). So that's $2700 gone. I would then pay off my Gateway bill (around $700) and buy a new computer: a completely loaded Dell (probably around $1800). I would give Mom $1500, and I then would spend $125 on clothes, $100 on CDs, and then I'd take the last $75 and take Mom out to dinner at Red Lobster.   BONUS: Whatever happened to unity?    Umberto Unity?

        "Inside The Actor's Studio" - Questionnaire    Here are my answers to the set of questions originally put together by Bernard Pivot and asked by James Lipton at the end of every episode of "Inside The Actor's Studio":    What is your favorite word?    Peace. Strangely enough, my second choice was "fart", because it's a silly word and it makes me laugh.    What is your least favorite word?    Nigger. It's an ugly word no matter who uses it or how it's used.    What turns you on creatively, spiritually or emotionally?    Intelligence, beauty, and laughter.   What turns you off?    Hatred, negativity, and greed.   What is your favorite curse word?    I don't cuss a lot, but I do use "the F word", with it's many wonderful variations, from time to time.    What sound or noise do you love?    Rain on the rooftop, laughter, the sound of a Fender Strat played through a large amplifier (with minimal distortion).   What sound or noise do you hate?    The sound of a ringing phone, plus anything that keeps me from sleeping: the lady next door hammering in the morning, the lawn getting mowed, booming car stereos, etc...   What profession other than your own would you like to attempt?    I would probably enjoy being a writer of some sort. I think I could be a decent school teacher though.    What profession would you not like to do?    Telemarketing.   If Heaven exists, what would you like to hear God say when you arrive at the Pearly Gates?    "Hey, given what you had to work with, I wouldn't have believed in me either!"

        Worn Out!   I got up around 1pm today (Sunday) and then watched another Pink Panther movie ("A Shot In The Dark") with Jess, worked with him on the guitar some more (I taught him the riffs to "Rock You Like A Hurricane" and "Back In Black"), and then we went outside and threw the baseball for awhile. We came in from playing ball all hot, sweaty and worn out. I think we wore each other out! I know I'm still beat. Around 5pm, he was ready to go home. I helped him get everything gathered up and by 6pm, he was heading home.   *sigh*  I'm glad to have some rest time now, but I always miss having him around to do stuff with. We keep each other pretty busy. I will try and get his sister or brother down next, though, with school starting up soon, I'm not sure when that'll happen.  I think I will be cleaning all day tomorrow. With all of the activity from this weekend and past week, the house is a little messy. And by "a little messy", I mean, it's a freakin' shithole. We're supposed to have someone come by to look at the floor in the hallway (it's giving way) and on Tuesday, JP and Al are supposed to jam here too, so I really need to get the house in order.  At some point, I need to get on the job hunt again too.   *sigh*

        Saturday/Sunday   I got Jess up at 5am and watched half the football game with him (turning to rugby during commercials and halftime), but by 6:30am, I  had  to go to bed. I stayed there until 2pm. I probably slept about 5 hours, which just wasn't enough. I was dragging all day long today, yawning, rubbing my eyes, just plain  tired . I got out of bed anyway, ate, and then watched TV (Bull Riding) a bit before I got moving.   The first thing I did with Jess was get the Chia seeds planted in the Chia Heads. It was an icky mess. I don't think mine's going to turn out too good. I had a lot of trouble getting the seeds to stick in the grooves. Jesse's looked really good though, all of the grooves filled. We put them out on the porch to get some sunlight, though there wasn't much of that available today.    After the Chia stuff, Mom took us out to get milkshakes (Missing Links!), and on the way there we stopped at a thrift store I'd never been to. It was pretty crappy, but I bought three paperback books there (for $1 each). I got: Stephen King's "Cujo", Al Franken's "Rush Limbaugh Is A Big Fat Idiot", and "Terrible Swift Sword" by Bruce Catton. After we got the shakes, we went over to Walgreens and I cut down about 20 cattails to take home.   My plan was simple: strap firecrackers to the cattails and watch them explode! Unfortunately, it didn't work out as well as I'd envisioned. Firecrackers just aren't powerful enough; they only blew up about an inch of cattail. I'd need M-80's to do the job right. So... Jess and I wound up having a cattail fight and man, we had the fluff a-flying! It looked like a snowstorm outside! We were both covered in cattail fluff and were spitting it out of our mouths. It was crazy! I took a bunch of pictures of the scene, I hope they come out OK.   I needed to shower anyway, but I  really  needed a shower after all of that. I was so tired, I felt like I could have passed out there in the shower. After the shower, I laid in my bed for awhile, drying off, but mostly just laying there. I could have went to sleep then very easily.    But I stayed up. I stayed up and watched more Bull Riding on TV while Jess played on the computer and Mom cooked dinner. She made spaghetti & meatballs and it was great. It turned out really well (it's hit and miss sometimes). I had some bread & butter and a little bit of wine with it. Good stuff!   After dinner, I went back to watching Bull Riding while Jess played on the PC. Eventually, I got motivated and I took him to my room and worked with him on guitar. He doesn't play enough at home, so his fingers still aren't used to the fretboard and he still isn't used to holding a pick. I keep telling him (and his sister too) that they need to play everyday, just practice something, anything, to get their fingers accustomed to the frets and to get their coordination down with the pick. I devised a short riff that he can play, which will ultimately help him get his fingers used to making power chord forms. I told him, that if he practices what I taught him, even if only for one month, I think he could be able to start learning songs. I hope he will do it, but I'm not counting on it. Once he gets home, everything changes, just like with his sister.   After the guitar lessons, I took him outside and we played catch with the mini-football for awhile. It's funny... it's just throwing a ball back and forth to each other, but it seems like more than that, a bonding activity. I guess it's a guy thing. We did that for awhile, until my back got too sore and the mosquitoes got too annoying.   We came in and we watched "The Return Of The Pink Panther" and we laughed our asses off. Jess seemed like he was in a really good mood tonight, but he also seemed like he was pretty tired himself. He crashed around 2:30am. I'm getting ready to crash very soon, myself.     He goes back tomorrow. I don't know how much more I'll get to do with him before then. I was thinking about taking him on the bus down to Goodwill and Salvation Army, but I don't really have any more money to spend. I'd like to work with him on the guitar some more (I still have to re-string his sister's guitar too), and I'd like to take him to see "Terminator 3" too. Even though he's seen it on the PC already, it'd be well worth seeing on the big screen. He wants to play catch with the baseball again too. He really enjoyed that. I did too. So much to do, so little time...

        Friday/Saturday   Jess and I stayed up really late last night and we both woke up around 2pm. I still felt tired, not refreshed at all. We had donuts for breakfast (new ones...mom had gone to the store in the morning), and we played around on the computer for awhile. I finally figured out how to install "Deer Hunter" and we played that for a bit (it's a pretty boring game).   I was going to start doing the Chia Heads today, but I screwed up and didn't let the seeds sit in water overnight (so we can't do them until Saturday afternoon now). I'd wanted to see them sprout before Jess left, but it might not happen now.   We played with the cats awhile. I tied a long plastic string to Jess' pants and he ran around the house with the cats chasing after him and the string. He nearly ran Jimmy out of breath chasing after him! Jimmy was panting, and then he went and laid down on the air vent for a few. Mom brought home Subway for us and we chowed down. After a bit, we went outside and played catch. Jess had brought down two gloves and a baseball.   Man.. I am way out-of shape. I used to be able to do stuff like that with such ease, now it's a struggle. It didn't help that it was so hot outside, I was sweating my ass off. We came in and watched baseball on TV for awhile, something I hadn't done since I was a kid.   He wants to get up at 5am to watch a Tampa Bay Bucs game being broadcast live from Japan, so we went to bed early, around 10pm. He fell asleep, and I  tried to , but I just wasn't able to fall asleep. I am dead tired too. I should have fallen asleep as soon as I hit the bed, but then, I'm not normal. I back got out of bed around midnight to use the bathroom and I wound up reading more of the Howard Stern book I started (in the bathroom, then in bed). I tried to sleep again, but just couldn't do it, so here I am... blogging.   I have to wake Jess up in about 2 1/2 hours for his game, so I guess I'm staying up until then. "Real Time with Bill Maher" is on the tube now, so I'm going to go and watch it.

How late?   I'm unemployed. I sleep in every freaking day.    3. Aside from waking up, what is the first thing you do in the morning?   I get up and I take a leak.    4. How long does it take to get ready for your day?   What's there to get ready for? On the off chance I have to go somewhere, it usually takes me about 15-20 minutes to get ready.   5.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  This week I listened to both of my new comedy CDs, Mitch Hedbergs's "Strategic Grill Locations" and Louis CK's "Live In Houston".  I also had Sammy Hagar's "Three Lock Box" tape on. I think the tape may be bad though, it screeches in my player sometimes.    Watching on TV:  My usual shows: "Everybody Loves Raymond", "Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn", "The Daily Show", "Real Time with Bill Maher", "Insomniac with Dave Attell", "Seinfeld", "Home Improvement", "The Simpsons" and "Saturday Night Live".   Tonight, I watched two movies with Jesse, my older nephew. They were: Jackie Chan's "The Big Brawl" (not a great plot, but a very entertaining movie) and "The Return Of The Living Dead" (which is chock full of dark humor).    Downloading:  I downloaded a movie that I'd wanted to see really badly when it was playing (in a limited run) in the theaters, but which, unfortunately, I wasn't able to see: "A Mighty Wind". I haven't gotten to watch it yet.    Gaming:  Nothing lately. I picked up a PC game today, "Deer Hunter", but when I tried to install it earlier tonight, it didn't work.     Reading:  Of all of the great, classic novels that I have sitting here unread, I chose to begin reading Howard Stern's "Miss America" before any of them.    Jamming:  We were supposed to get together tonight at Circle Studios, just me, Jp and Al, but when we got there, the guy told us that we never booked time for tonight... which is bullshit. He gave us shit when we played there last time because we took them up on their "buy two hours, get an hour free" internet deal (he said it was intended to be for new bands, not bands who play there regularly). He was being real dicky about it, and so I think he screwed us over this week  on purpose . I was right there with JP when he booked the time with the guy last week. He tried to blame it on us, but JP did the smart thing and walked away instead of arguing with the guy (it would have been pointless).  So we stood outside Circle talking for a few minutes and I offered the use of my place to practice tonight. At first, Al said he was just going to go home, but thankfully, he changed his mind and came over. We played out in the living room for a few hours, going over JP's originals, and we got a lot of work done. We worked on arrangements mostly, and some of my suggestions went over pretty well with the guys. The only suggestion of mine that got rebuffed was with "Circles". It has a country sounding chorus that just doesn't sound right, to me anyway, with the rest of this Nirvana-type song. My playing was pretty bad tonight. I really didn't sleep last night, literally, and was a little lagging in the Energy and Prescence-Of-Mind departments. We decided that we, JP, Al, and I, are going to start practicing over here on Tuesday nights and then have the full band practice at Santana's studio on Thursdays (he'll be back next week). This is a very pleasing developement! Al left around 10:15pm or so, and JP split around 11pm, after spending some time goofing off with me and Jess. His old trailer was taken away yesterday (replaced with a new one) so we went over and looked at the old lot. He was hoping to dig up some old Star Wars dolls he'd buried under his house! Ahhh...the good old days...    Working:  No work, no prospects, no nothing.    Buying:  We hit a few thrift stores today (Mom stayed home from work today) and I picked up four cassette tapes for $0.50 each: Fleetwood Mac's "Rumours", Harry Connick, Jr's "We Are In Love", Jefferson Airplane's "Surrealistic Pillow", and Paul Simon's "Graceland". I also found Monty Python's "Instant Record Collection" tape for just $0.25! I bought a PC game, "Deer Hunter", for $0.80, one of those round tap lights for $0.50, a pair of gorilla slippers (each one looks like a hairy stuffed animal) for $2, a cool little calculator for $0.50, and a Chia Head (for Jesse, so we both have one) for $2. We also stopped by Specs and I bought two copies of Masters Of Reality - "Live At The Viper Room" for $1.88 each (I think I can sell them for more on eBay), a 7-pack of 90 minute Maxell tapes, and I finally got my Dio "Live In Line" cassette 2 (I bought part 1 a month ago not knowing it was a 2-tape set), and I bought a second set for Jess as well. The three Dio tapes were $0.88 each. I bought bottled water for all of us while we were out today too ($3). Last night, I spent $14 on snacks for Jess and I.     Eating:  Pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds all day today, drumstick ice cream cones, Strawberry Cheesecake ice cream, tacos (a that killer Mexican restaurant on 66th street), chicken quesadillas, donuts... basically: crap. Delicious crap, yes, but crap all the same.    I'm drinking way too much soda too. I told Mom not to buy any more after what we have runs out. I really need to get off of (and stay off of) soda, for good.    Feeling:  Tired, tired, tired. I haven't slept in about 40 hours.    Planning:  I'm planning on going to sleep...  as soon as possible . Beyond that, it's all a haze right now.

        Sleepytime   It's gotta be the weather; cool and overcast, looking and feeling like it's going to rain any minute. It's been like this for about three days now and that's about how long I've been wanting nothing more than to sleep, sleep, sleep, all day and all night. Heck, it's not even 6pm and I'm ready to go to bed right now. It's crazy. I thought I could use the sudden abundance of sleep to get my sleep schedule straightened out, so I set my alarm this morning. It went off from 11am until 12pm, while I selpt through it, finally getting up around 12:30pm. I have no energy, no motivation, only the urge to snuggle up in bed and sleep. A couple weeks ago, I couldn't get to sleep to save my life, and now that's all I can do. I'm about as screwed up as they come, folks.

        The Blues   Airing on PBS all week is a terrific series about Blues music called " urlLink Martin Scorsese Presents The Blues ". I caught the first episode yesterday and I watched the second one tonight. Well done, and well worth watching for fans of the blues or for anyone wanting an introduction to the blues.   Besides getting to see some great archival footage and hear a lot of great music, each episode is directed by a different director, so each episode has a different feel to it. Sunday's was directed by Scorcese, my favorite so far, and tonight's was directed by Wim Wenders.   My only complaint thus far is the editing in of newly recorded performances of modern artists. It seems pointless, or more accurately, it seems like a blatant attempt to sell the new box set, featuring these newly recorded tracks. Now, don't get me wrong, I loved seeing Los Lobos doing J.B. Lenoir's "Voodoo Music", but not spliced in half with J.B.'s original song so that you only get a partial performance from either. It's kind of annoying.   "Martin Scorsese Presents The Blues" airs all week this week on PBS, and repeats three times per night.   For my fellow Jimi Hendrix fanatics, the episode that airs on Oct. 2nd will feature some Hendrix blues performances! Sweet!

         urlLink Monday Mission     1. US presidential candidate Wes Clark said recently that the American people are "really embarrassed" by the Bush administration, though no source was quoted and no figures were provide. Do you believe this is true? As a US citizen, are you embarrassed by President Bush?   I am extremely embarrassed by the actions of Bush and his administration. He's been incredibly arrogant, in almost every way imaginable. For example, he made it clear to the UN and to the rest of the world, that the US will do whatever we want to do and no one is going to stop us from doing it. In handling the situation like that, he not only showed the world how arrogant the US is, but he diminished the power of the UN as well. Then, after "winning" the war in Iraq and not having a solid post-war plan, Bush has the nerve to ask the UN and the rest of the world for their help and support. That was just one example of Bush's arrogance and stupidity, here is another: Bush avoided serving in the Vietnam War when he had every opportunity to do so, and yet, he had the nerve to fly aboard a Navy Aircraft carrier, in a Navy jet, during a time of war, acting like a hero for the cameras. I thought that was very disrespectful to our military, who were actually putting their lives at risk. What about his tax cuts for the wealthy? Or Cheney's ties to Halliburton, the American company given extremley lucrative contracts in Iraq? Or Bush's blatant favoritism of Christian charities, or the constant Christianspeak during news conferences, which was particularly disturbing and inappropriate during the Afghanistan and Iraq wars where he and his administration were saying the war wasn't "Christianity versus the Muslim religion"... he is an embarrassment, absolutely.    2. Do you have good friends in countries other than your own? Which is the furthest away? How did you meet them? What makes them such a great friend?   No, unfortunatley, I don't have any friends in foreign countries.    3. Are there any models of automobile on the road that irritate you when you see them?   No, not really. Not having a car myself, they all look pretty good to me.    4. When you were in school, did you ride the bus? Do you have any school bus horror stories? What really went on in the back seats anyway?   No, no horror stories, unless spitting out the window on people counts. Mostly we just joked and cracked on each other.   However, a friend of mine, while on a school bus, saw a little girl get her head run over by a different school bus, but I didn't see it myself. I'd imagine that's something you'd probably never forget.    5. Last week, I asked what sort of things a man should never say to a woman. Now it is time to turn the tables. There are a few things a woman can say to a man that can totally emasculate him. Such as: "Hold my purse." What sort of things should a woman never say to a man?   I hate when women make fun of men's... ummm... size. I hate it, even if they're not talking about me. People are born with what they're born with and picking on things like that seem cruel and petty to me. It's like jerks who make fun of small-breasted women, and now you see a lot of those women getting implants, scarring and disfiguring themselves so they'll feel better about themselves when there was nothing wrong with them to begin with. It's a terribly shallow annd harmful way to insult someone.    6. Do you have a favorite cartoon Super Hero? Who and why?   Captain Caveman! All I remember of him is that he was a hairy little cavedude with a a big club and a tiny cape and he yelled" Captaaaaaain Caaaaavemaaaan!".   I wasn't into the super-hero cartoons much, I was more into the funny ones.    7. Just what does it take to make you happy?   Feeling loved would be enough.    BONUS: How can you wait anymore when you're wondering what you're waitin' for?   Such is the enigma of Pop-Tarts.

         urlLink Monday Madness     Each question will begin with "Name your favorite..............."    1. quote:  Hmmm... I think my favorite "quote" would be "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." I'm not sure where it originated since it appears in the scriptures of many different religions, but I try to live by that line.    2. movie:  There are too many great movies to have a single favorite, but... the one I find myself watching over and over, everytime it's on TV, is "Papillon".    3. color:  I love blue, especially sky blue.   4. beverage:  I drink a lot of iced tea and I never, ever tire of it.    5. font:  I really have no font preference.    6. meal:  I'm going to cheat a little and say Thanksgiving.    7. book:  Hmmm... like movies, there are just too many good books out there to have a single favorite. I adore any and all of Arthur Conan-Doyle's "Sherlock Holmes" stories though. Very enjoyable stories.   8. word:  Probably "fart". It's a very silly word for a strange bodily function/sound and it's been known to make me laugh uncontrollably.    9. animal:  I love cats, especially the big ones. Leopards, panthers, cheetahs, lions, but particularly tigers, with their beautiful coloring.   10. fragrance:  I don't really have a favorite fragrance. I mean, I might, but I don't know what it's called. I do like watermelon smelling candles though.

        Sleep   I took that nap yesterday, and I stayed down until almost Midnight. I just can't do short naps. After I got up, I watched TV and played on the PC for awhile, but by 2:30am, I was ready for bed again. I wound up sleeping until about 2:30pm. That's a lot of sleep, especially for me. I was really comfy, what can I say? I probably could've stayed in bed a little longer too, but I was woken up by the sounds of my Mom walking around the house. She's home from work early for some reason.

        Sunday, So Far   Ugh. I slept until 1pm again. Dana and Mom were eating BLTs again when I got up and I had one too. Dana was planning on heading home around 3pm, so we really didn't have much time to do anything at all today. We played around for awhile with the toy Mom bought at Goodwill yesterday, one of those  urlLink pin art office toys  (I have one myself, that I bought years ago), but before long, it was time for her to go.   I feel really bad. I wanted to do a lot of fun stuff with Dana this weekend, but I slept most of the daytime hours away, so all we really did was eat and shop. Not exactly the weekend I had in mind.    It's raining out now and I don't feel like doing anything but laying in bed and reading. I might just go and do that.

        Saturday   I was up early today, 9:30am, but that was just to go to the bathroom. I went back to bed and wasn't woken up until after 1pm. Great. Most of the day, shot.   I got up and immediately went to packaging my eBay stuff to mail out. I finished it and we went to the post office, but I forgot all about my student loan check that was supposed to have been mailed by today (that'll be a nice $25-$35 late fee for me).   Anyway, after the post office, we headed over to Goodwill. That place was packed today and everything looked pretty much picked over. I did find a couple cool things though. I spent $1.00 on books and got two paperbacks ("Fletch" by Gregory MacDonald and "No Shirt, No Shoes... No Problem!" by Jeff Foxworthy) and a hardcover of Stephen King's "Dolores Claiborne", which I already have (I got it for re-sale or whatever). I also spent $1.00 on cassette tapes and got Harry Connick Jr's "Blue Light, Red Light" and Rush's "Signals". I almost picked up a bunch of soundtrack cassettes, but I wasn't sure how rare they were, so I left them.   From there we went over to Salvation Army and I bought two more Stephen King hardcovers, "Gerald's Game" and "The Regulators" (as Richard Bachman). I haven't read either of them yet, and a few more tapes: "Deadicated" (Grateful Dead tribute), Grateful Dead "Infrared Roses", and The Who's "Greatest Hits". Dana got a big bag of bead necklaces.   From there we headed West, for no apparent reason, and wound up in Bardmoor. I'd wanted to take Dana to the bead store there but it was closed. We wound up eating at Panera Breads. I'd never been there before and had no idea what to order. I finally decided on a Roast Beef sandwich, which was pretty good, and a Cream soda, which wasn't so good. I had ordered a chocoloate croissant too, but it was way too rich for me. I tried Dana's cheese pastry and liked that though. I liked the atmosphere of the place though, nice and relaxing, but it'd be pretty easy to go crazy on the food there; lots of delicious looking pastries and killer Mocha iced coffees (they gave us a sample).   After we finished eating, Mom went over to Publix and Dana nad I went into the CD store ther, Sound Waves, and I bought two Jimi Hendrix tapes, "Axis:Bold As Love" and "Johnny B. Goode"(the BMG version) for $7. I forgot my checkbook and debit card in Mom's car, so we had to wait there a long time, waiting for Mom to come back so I could fetch my stuff. That sucked.    Before we got back home, we stopped at Walgreens, so I could drop off a roll of film to be developed.  We chilled for an hour or two, Dana reading her book ("Lord Of The Flies") and me playing on the PC, before Dana started getting hungry (she hadn't eaten much at Panera). Her and mom cooked up a BLT and baked bean dinner for us. After we finished, we headed out the door again, this time to Tampa.   Mom took me over to Tampa so I could drop off my student loan payment at the Tampa post office, which is open 24 hours. Very cool! My check should arrive in time now, no late charge hopefully.   On the way home, we stopped at Walgreens again, and I picked up my photos. They were from whne Jess was down last, when we had the cattails exploding in the back yard. Most though, were of the cats, playing in the tub and playing with some yellow plastic straps that I attatched to a chair for them.   When we got back home, I scanned and cropped the pics and saved them on my PC while Dana finished her book. After that, I helped her with her book report while doing my scanning and stuff. She stayed up working on it until about 2am. I was up until 4am, but didn't fall asleep until about 5:30am.

        Friday Night   Mom and I went up to New Port Richey this evening to pick up my niece, Dana. When we got there, she was the only one home, but soon after, my sister arrived. I gave my sister the tapes she bought from me last week and I borrowed her vacuum cleaner. Mom, Dana and I headed over to Gringo's, a Mexican restaurant up there.   I'd never been there before, but they had. I usually have Chili Rellenos, had I tried different tonight, Enchiladas Verdes, I believe it's called, with shredded beef. It wasn't bad, but the green sauce (hence the "Verdes") was a bit too tangy (or maybe there was too much of it). I wouldn't order it again. I had a side Chili Relleno and my niece and I had stuffed some jalapenos (with cheddar). Mom and I split a fried ice cream afterwards. We were all stuffed by the time we finished there.   After we got home, Mom went to her room and Dana did some schoolwork while I played around on the PC. I tried watching "Minority Report" with Dana, but she started falling asleep and I finally sent her to bed.   I hope I can get to sleep a little better tonight. I'd like to get up early and go to the flea market or something.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  Still listening to tapes that I got in. I really liked the Fates Warning and Butthole Surfers tapes, "Night On Brocken" and " Pioughd", respectively. The Butthole Surfers had some really cool, almost Hendrixlike guitar stuff on it. I was surprised. I'm listening to JP's CD right now, demos for the band.    Watching on TV:  "Columbo" in the afternoon, "Everybody Loves Raymond" then "Seinfeld", in the evening. Late night, it's "The Daily Show" and "Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn". I watch "Real Time with Bill Maher" weekly, sometimes I'll watch it a couple of times throughout the week as it repeats. I watch Bull Riding on the weekend, and I watch Howard Stern once in awhile, like last night, for example. I haven't been watching much in between those shows lately though, if I do it's whatever's on Comedy Central and I'm usually only half-watching them while I'm on the PC.    Downloading:  I downloaded some Stevie Ray Vaughan outtakes yesterday, but I haven't heard them yet. I also downloaded some stuff from The Kings Of Leon, a new band that my friend Rob told me about. Some of their stuff is really, really good. Again, if it weren't for the ability to download their songs and check them out, I never would have gotten any exposure to them, so suck on that, RIAA.    Playing:  No games at all lately.   Reading:  I picked "Moby Dick" back up the other night, and so far I'm about 1/4 of the way through the book. Pretty neat writing style by Melville, but some of the language is hard to grasp. I'd like to see the movie version after I finish the book.    Jamming:  We rehearsed last night, for three hours, which flew by. We sounded like crap again, lifeless. We all noticed it and remarked on it. We think it's the room and/or the drum kit, which is really flat, no snap to the drums at all. We're going to switch to a better room next week, a cooler one too, that has a stage set-up complete with monitors and a real stage. The drum kit sounded a little better too. I'd never heard about that room before and was completely baffled as to why we've never played in there, since it costs the same to use as any other room. The guys said they forgot about it. D'oh! So, as far as our playing goes, we're getting better, talking things out and tightening things up a lot more, but we're still not quite there yet. Jimmy doesn't seem to be doing anything at home either. He can't practice because his kit stays in storage, but he hasn't even  listened  to the Ben Harper song we're doing yet, and it's been several weeks since we decided to do it. I've been bad myself about practicing at home lately, so I can't really criticize him too much. It's slow going, but we're still progressing and that's good.    Working:  Still nada. My sleep schedule is still whacked. I have to get that corrected before I get a job.     Buying:  I bought a lot of tapes on eBay last night, 33 of them (plus a 3-drawer storage case) for $11.25 total (shipping included). It was a "second chance offer" from the seller; I guess the other bidder flaked out. Good batch of tapes too. Some of the bands are Nirvana, Green Day, Stone Temple Pilots, Jimi Hendrix, Smashing Pumpkins, Hole, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Blues Traveler, and Van Halen. Really good lot, as long as they're not thrashed.   Selling:  I started up my eBay store, only 2 items listed so far, but next week, I will add more. I worked out a side deal this week, which helps me out a great deal, especially with my niece down this weekend.     Eating:  Mom didn't go shopping this week, so it's been whatever's in the house. I had egg salad sammiches for lunch a couple days, can't recall what else I had this week... senility already? For dinners this week, we had hash browns and kielbasa, scalloped potatoes and ham (that's right... I had that for lunch a couple days as well), and last night, I had a greek salad from Stavros. Tonight, we'll pick up my niece and probably eat out at Gringo's. I love Mexican food. Sweet!   Feeling:  Mentally: I've been feeling ok lately, just annoyed at myself for not being able to sleep at night. It's like my life is on pause until I can get that straightened out. I've also been feeling angry and frustrated with the state of the world today, but I guess that's pretty universal.   Physically: Tired mostly, again, from not sleeping well at night. My left hand started hurting a few days ago too; I must have slept on it wrong. It really bothered me last night, playing the guitar, especially when I made power chords. No Charlie Horses this week, luckily, but I could feel one about ready to strike this morning.     Planning:  Short term plan this week: to enjoy the weekend with my niece and to have some fun for a change.

        "You'd Better Not Call Me"   Three posts below, I wrote about the ridiculous Oklahoma federal court judge, Judge Lee R. West, who blocked the National No-Call list that prevents solicitors from calling you at home (who is now being hounded at his home and his office by non-stop telephone calls from angry Americans), and I'm glad to report that Congress took over and, in effect, reversed his reversal.   Excellent job, congressmen and congresswomen, but it's not over yet.  Tonight, another ridiculous federal court judge, this one in Denver, Judge Edward W. Nottingham, has blocked the No-Call list again, and  this time , it will have to be decided in court. This judge says the No-Call list is, get this, a free speech violation:   "The Federal Trade Commission has chosen to entangle itself too much in the consumers' decision by manipulating consumer choice and favoring speech by charitable (organizations) over commercial speech."   He's saying that telemarketers are having their speech rights violated because they aren't allowed to call us in our homes but charitable organizations are. So freaking what? What about  our  rights, the individuals who are being pestered in our homes? Why are our rights, individual rights, less important that so-called corporate rights? What is our society coming to? I think we, the people, have lost hold of our country. It has slipped from being about our rights to being about corporate rights. It's us versus them and they are winning. Or have they already won?  By the way, the reason the title of this post is in quotation marks, is because it's a song title, from the band Zebra, a totally rocking, kickass song, but I'm sure very few, if any, got the reference.

        Very Disturbing   Apparently the whole suing-our-customers thing wasn't working for them, so now the RIAA is  urlLink going into our schools . Instead of suing 12-year olds, they are going to try and get to them in their schools, as authority figures, teaching the impressionable youngsters about what is right and what is wrong. This is seriously disturbing to me. How in the hell does a corporate entity, a trade group, gain access to our school systems, to our children, and why the hell are we letting it happen? This is wrong on so many levels. Here's a few choice bits about the RIAA's school program:     "As early as next month the industry will begin promoting a "stealing is bad" message in schools, teaming up with Junior Achievement on an hourlong class for fifth- through ninth-graders on the history of copyright law and the evils of online file sharing. The effort includes games like "Starving Artist," in which students pretend to be musicians whose work is downloaded free from the Internet, and a crossword puzzle called "Surfing for Trouble."   Junior Achievement is projecting that the lesson, which will be taught both in school and after school, will be used in 36,000 classrooms nationwide and has the potential of reaching 900,000 students in grades five through nine, or about 10 percent of all students in those grade levels.   In the role-playing activity Starving Artist, for example, groups of students are encouraged to come up with an idea for a musical act, write lyrics and design a CD cover only to be told by a volunteer teacher their work can be downloaded free. According to the lesson, the volunteer would then "ask them how they felt when they realized that their work was stolen and that they would not get anything for their efforts."   That is fucking  sickening . Most artists do not care about filesharing, they just want their music heard, in fact, many artists fully support filesharing. Recording artists make their money from concerts and merchandising, not from CD sales. It's the greedy record company weasels who are pushing this issue, not the artists. They want to keep their big, undeserved bucks to keep flowing in, consumers be damned. They don't listen to consumers (and artists) when we tell them CD prices are too high, they ignore a large consumer base who are willing to pay for downloading services, and instead of changing with the times, they bully and sue their customers. Any other business who behaved like that would go under, and deservedly so, so why is the RIAA being coddled then? It's ridiculous, and who knows how far they will go with this. I think they've gone too far already. In my opinion, allowing them to push their agenda in our school system is going too far. Something must be done to stop this.

         urlLink 3 for Thursday     1. What are 3 songs from your "growing up" years that you hear on the radio now and have to crank it. Songs that really get you rockin'?   I rarely ever listen to radio anymore, but occasionally I'll have it on in the car. On the rare occasion they play it, Dio's "Rainbow In The Dark" always gets me rocking out. Any old AC/DC or Van Halen (pre-"5150") works for me too.    2. What are 3 songs that bring back really great memories.   Two of my friends had a trailer next to an abandoned building, they used to run an extension cord from the trailer to the building, and we used to jam inside the building, day and night, dawn to dusk. It was a great time in our lives. Anyway, there are two obscure, oddball songs, "Dead Puppies" and "Fish Heads", that I used to play with my friends in my first band, just for a laugh. So, I'm in a band now, and one of the guys from my first band is in my current band, so every once in awhile one of us will throw out "Dead Puppies" or "Fish Heads", as a nod to that time in our lives. It's an inside musical joke with us.   The other song that brings back meories, though I don't know if they're great or not, is "Alone Again" by Dokken. Back when I was just a beginner on guitar, I learned the first part of that song and played it for a girl I was crazy about. It was nice playing for her, to her, even though it wasn't much.    3. What are 3 of your favorite bands/singers from your growing up years?   I discovered music in a big way when I was a teenager, so most of my favorites weren't even from that period. Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin were my favs then (and still are today), and I was also a huge Stevie Ray Vaughan fan.   I'd say the other bands I liked most, who were actually around during my "growing up years", were Ratt, Zebra, and Dokken. This was during the "hair band" period, which is probably why I searched out music from other genre's and time periods; most of the music from my "growing up years" was pretty bad.    4. What are 3 of your favorite bands/singers now?   Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin still top my favorites list, but to keep it limited to current bands, my favorites are Wilco, Los Lobos, and Beck, with an appreciative nod to Ben Harper, Neil Young, Matthew Sweet, The Jayhawks, and The White Stripes. and    Bonus: What was the best concert you ever went to? Tell us about it.   Stevie Ray Vaughan left me awestruck. I saw him twice, in 1987 and again in 1989. The 1989 show was great, but the 1987 show was simply amazing. I remember standing there, mesmerized, going "holy shit". His playing, his showmanship, his energy... he was electrifying. He made me want to give up playing guitar. I thought "No matter how much I practice, no matter how much I learn, there's just no way I could ever get to that level."

        Feelin' Good For A Change   I slept like crap again last night (I was still awake at 4:45am, after going to bed at after Midnight), but I'm feeling pretty good right now. I'm not sure why either, I just am.   I got up around 12:45pm and played around on the PC for awhile, half-watching "Columbo", and eventually went to eBay and opened up my own eBay store... finally. I've been toying with the idea awhile, but I finally spent some time looking into it and just did it. It's free for the first 30 days (.05 per item listed), and then I have to pay $9.99 per month to keep it open. If I can get enough items listed, the $9.99 will be a minor cost. I only have two items in my store right now, but I can add more at any time since they run for 30 days (up to 120 days). It'd be great if I could get several hundred items up; cards, CDs, tapes, books... whatever. So now I have something constructive to do with my spare time: list, list, list.   Speaking of eBay, I got just enough money in to pay my Student Loan bill, to cover my band practice tomorrow, and to get my eBay account back into positive numbers again. I was also able to pay mom back half of what I currently owe her, which is good, but I still owe her $65, which is not good.   Something that is also not good:  urlLink the National Do-Not-Call list has been blocked  by a federal court in Oklahoma. Unbelievable. I wonder how much the Telemarketers had to pay to make that happen. Greedy assholes. Fifty million Americans signed up for it.  Fifty million people  said "I don't want to be bothered by solicitors... in my home" and a federal court can't respect that? WTF? Look, if I don't want solicitors on my property, whether they gain entry in person or through electronic means, then they have to respect my rights to stay away. It's my home, my property. Besides, legally, if they're unwanted visitors, unwanted and unwelcome, and they come onto (or into) my property anyway... then they're  trespassing , dammit! Plain and simple. And the same thing goes for those goddamned spammers: unwanted and unwelcome trespassers. Hey, federal court in Oklahoma, you're violating my rights!  So that sucks... but at least I had a good lunch today. I chowed on an egg salad sandwich while rocking out to Fates Warning. Sweet!

         urlLink Tuesday Chooseday     Would you rather:   Sleep with your favorite movie star, but they have no legs OR they have no eyes?    First off, why would on Earth would I want to sleep with Robert DeNiro? I'm not gay, and I don't believe he is either. I'm assuming I'm allowed to pick a beautiful actress instead, right? Well, I think eyes are very important, especially when you're face-to-face with someone, and with her having no legs, you'd pretty much have to be face-to-face, right? Ok, maybe not. You know, this question is pretty creepy and so is the mental imagery it is conjuring up. Ick. Next!   Have the power to cure blindness but in turn make the person deaf OR heal burns, scars, and broken bones but cause the person to go colorblind?    Wow. Both would be pretty weak powers to have. Couldn't I just fly or shoot lasers beams from my ass or something? Well, you can use your mind to "see", so it wouldn't be much of a trade-off, and me being a muscian and a music lover, I'd hate to make someone go deaf. Colo blindness wouldn't be so bad, but then, burns, scars, and broken bones can heal themselves to some extent and plastic surgery could fix most everything else... I guess I'd choose the power to heal burns, scars and broken bones, because some burns and scars are just so bad they can't be fixed. At least then, I could actually help improve someone's life.    Eat a fried piece of dog crap knowingly OR unknowingly eat a sno-cone filled with somebody else's urine?    You are a truly disturbed individual, and I'd take the pee-pee sno-cone. The melting ice will help dillute the whiz, but nothing can keep a deep-fried dog turd from tasting like deep-fried dog turd.   Spend 2 years in jail for something you didn't do OR somebody else spend 15 years in jail for something you did do?   I'd go to jail or prison myself rather than have someone else go for something I did, but I'd kill myself before I got there. I'd rather eat a deep-fried dog turd and wash it down with a pee-pee snow cone than go to prison.   I'm just not a fan of anal-rape, sorry.

        I Might Have My #2 Man   Ok, I'm still pulling for  urlLink Dennis Kucinich  to get the Democratic nod to run as our next President, but as I've said all along, I don't think he's got much of a chance. He's too extreme for most people (which is why I like him, he'd make some real changes), he doesn't have a warm and fluffy public image (he's very businesslike, which is also good, he wants to get things done), and then there's his name, Kucinich, which sounds too... European, let's say.   See, I don't have a lot of faith in the average American voter. I don't think most will make the smart decision based on the candidate's politics. I think most Americans vote for our President the way High School kids vote for the Homecoming Queen. It's a big popularity contest, but on a grander scale.   Anyway, I've looked into several of the other candidates, trying to choose a decent "back-up candidate" to support if Kucinich should drop out, but I've had problems with most all of the folks running. For example, Howard Dean, the current front-runner, is too  urlLink Pro-NRA  (he received an A+ rating from the NRA), and he has flip-flopped on important labor issues (he said he'd raise the working age, and then said he wouldn't). Besides that, his personality and TV image won't be winning him many votes. He comes off as a little... weird, kind of doofus-y. I think he'd guarantee Bush another four years if he gets the Democratic nomination.   So, as I was saying, I looked around for a suitable back-up candidate and I have finally found someone I like, someone who not only could win the presidency, but who could also be a good leader:  urlLink Wesley Clark .   I first heard of him during the recent War in Iraq, where he was positioned as CNN's main military analyst. I thought he was a well-spoken, intelligent, and likable man. I was surprised as can be to find out that he was a Democrat, and I was even more surprised to hear that he has joined in the running for the presidency.  I checked out  urlLink his website  earlier today and read up on  urlLink where he stands on the issues of the day . I'm impressed with what he has to say so far, although he hasn't covered everything I want covered yet, plus I understand he made some questionable calls during his time as NATO Commander in Kosovo and has said some questionable things in the media, so I still need to do some more research on the man. I'm not 100% sold on him, but so far, I'd say that, compared to every other Democratic candidate out there, he stands the best chance of beating Bush, and in the end, that may be a good enough reason for me to vote for him.

         urlLink Monday Mission     1. What was the first perfume or cologne you wore? Tell me about the memories that come to mind when you think about it/smell it again.    I've never been much of a cologne wearer, so I don't really have any memories other than never having any idea how much to apply. I think I always overdid it when I used it before, which is why I don't even bother anymore. I don't even think I have any around at all now.    2. What are some of the best things about Fall?    I love Fall! I love it, love it, love it. I love the coolness in the weather and I love the leaves changing color on the trees (though here in Florida, there ain't much of that). I also love that, with Fall, you can almost feel the holidays coming on. There's a family feeling, a togetherness, I feel. I'll bet it's something that goes back to our primitive ancestors, that need to come together in preparation for the Winter months, a built-in survival instinct. But then again, maybe it's just me  ; )    3. Why do some women put up with men who constantly insult them and/or abuse them?   Ugh! That's the question I'd like explained  to me ! I can't get a girlfriend, but every scummy asshole I know of has one and treats their women like crap. It's astonishing to me. And every women I know of says "looks aren't important", but through their actions, it's obvious that they'd rather be with a good looking guy who treats them like crap than with someone who looks like me (fat & balding) and would treat them with respect. Go figure.    4. What are some things men should never say to women?   I'm not much for holding back my tongue, if someone asks for the truth, I generally give it to them, but if it's something hurtful, then it should probably be better left unsaid, no matter if it's a woman or a man.    5. How many pairs of shoes do you have? Is that too many or not enough? Do you keep shoes you know you will never wear again?   I have 3 pairs of tennis shoes (2 white, 1 black) and 1 pair of brown dress shoes that fit, but are actually a size too small. I'd like to have a few more pairs, some for work, some for play, some for fancy dress.    6. Did your family keep a lot of photo albums around? Do you like looking at family photo albums?    Yeah, we have a lot of photo albums. I enjoy looking through them and sometimes when my sister's kids come down, I'll go through some of the photo albums with them. I think our family history is a great thing to share with them. Unfortunately, they're still too young to appreciate it and they get bored with it real fast. They'd rather watch home videos of themselves. One of these days, after I get a new PC with a CD burner, I would like to scan all of the photos and burn them to disc. That'll be a hell of a job, but well worth it.     7. I've finally got a Friday night off to go out to a movie. You're coming with, right? Great! I am leaving it all up to you though, you make the plans, who's going, where to eat, the movie, whatever else later. I'll be by a 7 to get you, so what's the plan?   Hmmm... well, Promoguy, I don't really know how or why  we'd  be going out together, so ummm...   I guess the best way to answer this question is to give an idea of what I'd consider a great night out. First off, there'd be no Promoguy (sorry Promoguy), but rather, a smart, sexy young woman who's up for anything. We'd head out around 6:45pm, hit the beach first and watch the sun go down, and then go get something to eat, maybe someplace walking distance from the beach, that we'd both agree on. From there we'd go to a movie perhaps (a comedy preferably) or maybe we'd go and do something a little different, like rollerskating or bowling or miniature golfing... something fun that we could do together. Afterwards, we could go get some coffee at a coffee house and watch some poetry readings or maybe go to Barnes & Nobles and have some coffee there, just as long as there is coffee involved and it's somewhere relaxing where we could talk. If we're up to it, we could take a nice nighttime stroll along the beach, with the wind and the waves... it'd be refreshing. And from there? Yeah, as if. I'd be lucky to get the sunset.   BONUS: Come on baby, where's your guts?   Hanging over my belt buckle.

        Parasite   Ok, so I didn't stay up all night. I went to bed around 4am and played guitar in bed for awhile. I think I fell asleep somewhere after 5:30am. I would've fallen asleep sooner, but the cats kept scratching at my door, trying to get into my room.   I usually let them in, but Jimmy has gotten himself a tapeworm and I don't want him dropping worms on my bed. Ick! Too gross. I read up on tapeworms and it seems they get tapeworm from eating fleas (fleas are a carrier). We didn't have fleas in the house for a long, long time, but my niece and nephews brought them down with them and gave them to our cats. Sad, but true. They have two outdoor cats and two dogs who go outside and they all have fleas bad. I saw a flea on my niece's clothing when she was down a long time back, and since her visit, our cats have fleas.   Anyhow, Mom bought some medicine for him, but she bought the wrong kind (roundworms, not tapeworms) so he'll have them another day or two. Ugh. I hate worms, and everything about them.

        Sunday   Boring, wasted day today. I had trouble sleeping again last night, so I got out of bed feeling tired still. After munching on some donuts Mom brought home, I wound up crashing on the couch, going in and out of sleep for an hour or two while half-watching football. Man, football games are long.   I should have started my auction stuff last night (pulling cards to list), but I waited until late this afternoon (after peeling myself off the couch) to start it. I wound up spending all afternoon and night going through boxes and pulling cards. I didn't get to scan or list anything this week. Not good. I may list some auctions on Tuesday, but then again, I may just wait until next Sunday since I did ok this week (ok = good enough to pay my current bills and that's about it). Next week is a must for listing now. I was hoping to list this weekend and take next weekend off from listing since my niece is coming down to visit.    It is 2:30am Monday Morning and I think I'm just going to stay up all day. I have got to get my sleep schedule "normalized" so I can go get myself a freaking job. Waking up tired at 11:30am ain't cutting it. You know, for a while there, I was getting up ay 8am everyday.. without an alarm... but I slipped back into my night owl ways and it's been hard to switch back again, especially with the insomnia I've had lately.   Why does everything have to be a struggle for me? Goddamn.  Needless to say, it's going to be a very long day.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  I've been listening to a lot of '70's & '80's music, mainly the tapes that I've been getting in: The Go-Go's, Black Sabbath, Madness, The Kinks, Foreigner, Led Zeppelin, etc..   I also listened to both of my new Jimi Hendrix CDs and disc 1 of the Bill Cosby 2-CD set.   Watching on TV:  I've caught "Columbo" most days this week, and I've watched my usual "Everybody Loves Raymond" & "Seinfeld" one and a half hour block in the evenings. At night, it's "The Daily Show" & "Tough Crowd w/ Colin Quinn". I also watched a little of Howard Stern, some "Fear Factor", CNN, "Larry King Live" (he had Jimmy Carter on), and some of the home improvement shows ("Home Invaders", "While You Were Out", "Trading Spaces", etc..). I also watched "Real Time w/ Bill Maher"on Friday (11pm), as per usual, and I'll probably watch it again tonight.   I'm watching Bull Riding now, which I've been doing every Saturday and Sunday night for awhile now.    Downloading:  I downloaded the new ZZ Top and Iron Maiden albums. I haven't listened to them yet, but I will, probably tomorrow whle I'm listing auctions. I also downloaded some Warren Zevon stuff. All I have from him is a couple of CD singles and I was wanting to hear him again. He was a really unique and special musician.     Playing:  I played that "Hangman" handheld game for a few minutes the other day, but I really haven't been playing games at all.    Reading:  I read the introduction to "The Book Of Dracula", a collection of classic vampire short-stories. I haven't picked it back up for days though. That's two books I've started recently and have yet to continue with (the other was "Moby Dick").     Jamming: We practiced on Thursday for three hours and will play next Thursday for at least three hours. JP said something about going to four hours, which would help a lot. I'm all for playing more. The more practice together, the better.    Working:  Since nothing has changed, I'll just repeat my last entry for this one:   Still not working. I hope to get looking soon, Monday hopefully.     Buying:  I won two auctions this week, a box of 200 cassette tape cases ($20.50) and a Hendrix bootleg CD ($17), but I still have no money to pay for them yet. I usually don't operate like that, I normally pay right away, but I had won the tape cases knowing I'd have the money for them within a few days and the Hendrix CD I just could not pass up for that price. I am expecting some money from my auctions this week (not much so far) and I'm owed about $35 from last week, so hopefully I can pay for my wins by Monday.    Selling:  My auctions aren't doing real hot this week, but I did make $9 today outside of eBay. My friend Rob and his brother-in-law Sam came over today and bought some tapes off of me. Unfortunately, I spent it all at 7-11 on the way home from the Post Office. I bought Slurpees and Reese Cups (the new "reverse" ones) for Mom and I and I bought myself the new Rolling Stone with Jimi on the cover. We stopped there because Mom wanted a Slurpee. I should've just bought them and nothing else, because I still need $9 for band rehearsal this week. Doh!   Eating:  Mom and I did our pizza & wings last night, had Arby's for lunch today, that 7-11 junk food this afternoon, and then some crappy Sloppy Joes tonight (she used some Durkee Sloppy Joe mix and it was horrid). Throughout the week I've been eating hamburgers (no bun, and usually with raw Broccoli dipped in Russian dressing), Mom made Chicken Divan again this week and it was pretty good, and I had some Stouffers BBQ Chicken & Cheesy Potato dinners. I've been snacking on pumpkin seeds all week, and I had a couple oatmeal cookies too. Mom bought giant ones that are too sugary, so I haven't been wanting them much. I had some root beer last night, and have some for tomorrow (I've cut down to sodas on the weekend only).      Feeling:  Mentally: About the same as last week. How much (or how little) sleep I'm getting has been dicatating how I feel each day. I've taken Melatonin three times this week and it doesn't seem to be doing much, if anything. Last night I took a double dosage and I slept worse last night than I have in days. I was still awake at 5am this morning after going to bed before 1am.   Physically: I've been staying in bed longer making up for the sleep I don't get at night, so I'm usually waking up sore or else sleepy, like today. I had Charlie Horses real bad Thursday night, and my back has been a little sore too. I feel like a very old man.     Planning:  I really want and need to get a job. It's starting to feel like Fall, and that means Birthdays (Mom, Dana, and Austin) and Christmas are coming up quickly. I need money... badly.

        Friday Stuff   I slept pretty poorly again last night. I went to bed around 12:45am, but by 3am I was still not sleeping. I wound up staying in bed until 12:30pm again. I think I might try taking two Melatonin pills tonight; maybe my size has something to do with why it doesn't seem to be working so far.   I had several "Charlie Horses" throughout the night/morning too. I woke up in pain at least three times from my calf muscles tightening up on me. I think it was all of the standing at band rehearsal. I used to work 12 hours shifts on my feet, but now three hours kills me.   I talked to Mom on the phone right after getting up today and she said my niece would be coming down tonight to spend the weekend with us... good news! It's about damn time! It's been quite a while since we've had her down and I was looking forward to her visiting. I called her up to let her know we'd be picking her up around 7pm, but she told me that her grandmother, my Mom, had never made arrangements with her and she'd already made other plans. Damn women. Everytime they make the arrangements something like this happens. They talk and they talk and they talk, but they always leave out the important parts. Next time, I'm just going to do it myself. Hopefully we'll have her next weekend. I may set up a booth out at the flea market with her and she can walk around, eat (she loves the "elephant ears"), or sit with me. We'll see.   I got the last of my cassette lots in today... finally! Most look really good, three were no good, but out of 97 tapes, that's not bad. I paid $16 for the whole lot, a steal, especially considering the sealed tapes (including The Jayhawks, Metallica, James, the Cult, and two different greatest hits tapes from Queen). There were too many too list them all, so I'll just list some of the ones I'm probably going to keep for myself:   Black Sabbath "The Collection", The Cult "The Cult" (sealed), Dinosaur Jr. "Where You Been", The Firm "Mean Business", Fishbone "Truth And Soul", Iron Maiden "Powerslave", James "Laid" (sealed), The Jayhawks "Tomorrow The Green Grass" (sealed), Billy Joel "River Of Dreams", Judas Priest "Priest...Live!", Living Colour "Times Up", Manfredd Mann "Best of Manfredd Mann", Metallica "...And Justice for All" (sealed), Steve Miller Band "Greatest Hits 74-78", Nirvana "Incesticide", Ozzy Osbourne "Speak Of The Devil", Jimmy Page "Outrider", Popa Chubby "Booty And The Beast" (sealed), Queen "Greatest Hits" & "Classic Queen" (both sealed), T. Rex "The Slider", and Tom Waits "The Early Years".   I think I have about 600 different tapes to sell now (about 650 if you count doubles). Like I said before, I'm thinking about taking them to the flea market, but I'm also thinking about selling them in lots (country, metal, pop) through the paper. If I could get $450 for all of them, I'd be thrilled to death.           Being as today is Friday, this means something special to me: pizza & wings! Woohoo! I just ordered them, so I shall be chowing down in about 30-40 minutes. Yay for pizza! Yay for me!  That reminds me, I changed the sound Outlook Express makes when there is new mail (in the Media folder, it's called "NOTIFY"). In it's place, I have inserted the "Yaaaaaay ! I got mail" sound clip from Crank Yankers.   I rule.

         urlLink The Friday Five     1. Who is your favorite singer/musician? Why?    Of all-time, it'd have to be Jimi Hendrix. I can relate to his words and music, the rhythms, his singing, and I really enjoy his creativity. He was one-of-a-kind, a truly amazing musician.   Of current musicians, I like David Hidalgo a lot. He's the lead singer of Los Lobos, but he's been involved with a few great side projects too (notably, The Latin Playboys & Houndog). He's a great singer (with a unique voice), a great guitar player (can seamlessly go from rockabilly to traditional Mexican music to Hendrix), a versatile musican (plays guitar, accordian, and various Mexican instruments), and he is also very inventive, creative. I have a lot of respect for the guy.     2. What one singer/musician can you not stand? Why?   Geez, just one? There is so much bad music being made today that it'd be impossible to single out any one. I like real music, from the heart, not the phony-baloney plastic garbage that tries to pass for music.    3. If your favorite singer wasn't in the music business, do you think you would still like him/her as a person?   Absolutely. Hendrix was a pretty funny guy, he enjoyed Sci-Fi, he was a music lover, and he was carefree and easy-going. Hidalgo is another music fan, very open-minded, and is a pretty laid back guy.    4. Have you been to any concerts? If yes, who put on the best show?   Yep, in fact, I have a section of my blog devoted to the concerts I've seen. Of all the ones I've seen, Crosby, Stills, and Nash may have been the most enjoyable, but Stevie Ray Vaughan was the most impressive. he left me awestruck.    5. What are your thoughts on downloading free music online vs. purchasing albums? Do you feel the RIAA is right in its pursuit to stop people from dowloading free music?   I've written about this several times on my blog. I don't think there's anything wrong with downloading music for free. I think it allows people to listen to a lot of different music that they'd never hear otherwise and can be a great benefit to the artists and their record companies. However, if the music is readily available in stores, I don't think people should be burning it to disc. It's a fine line between sampling and stealing.   As far as the RIAA is concerned, they can kiss my ass. If there was a way to cut them out of the picture all together, I'd be all for it. Suing their customers rather than adapting to change shows just how much they care about money and how little thay care about consumers. As a musician myself, I think what they are doing is shameful.   If they really wanted to stop filesharing, or reduce it anyway (filesharing will not be going away anytime soon), they need to reduce the prices for CDs. They should cost no more than $10 each. In fact, Tom Petty wanted to name one of his CDs "$9.99". I think if most people had to choose between a burned copy or the real thing, they'd want the real thing, but at $18 a pop, it's just not worth it.   The problem is, the RIAA is a monopoly and they want to continue making us pay $18 because it's more money for them. They don't want to change the way things have been going, apparently feeling that it's not to their benefit. Unfortunately for us, there is no alternative to RIAA products, which is why people are burning downloaded music or buying everything used. If they'd lower their prices, make them more realistically priced, people would burn CDs less and buy more new product. Very simple solution, but the RIAA must begin adapting, changing. Unfortunately, with these ongoing lawsuits, they have shown no willingness to do so. So screw 'em.

        Band Rehearsal   Well... the good news is that we sounded better than last week. The bad news is, we still sounded pretty rough. We still aren't gelling like we were before. I don't think any of us are practicing at home like we're supposed to be doing, myself included. We are still working on some songs, re-working others, and that's impeding our flow as well. The guys are talking about getting a gig in about two weeks, but I'm really not sure we're ready yet.   A musician from a local band, Heatseeker (I think), hung out for a few minutes and listened to us play, but he was there during a really rough stretch, when we were sucking especially bad. He talked to JP about having us open for them. The way we sounded when he was there, I don't know why he'd want us.   I'm going to have to get myself on the ball and start practicing more. It's something I really need to do.   We may play for 4 hours next time, so that should help us too. I'm hoping we'll start clicking again soon.

        Thursday... So Far   Last night, I called my sister up and sold her some cassette tapes. She'd wanted me to bring them up last weekend, but I didn't make it, besides,  there are just too many now (making it a hassle to just "bring them up"), so I went through them with her over the phone. She wound up wanting 12 of them. I gave her the 12 tapes, one of which is still sealed, plus a nice little 12-tape carrying case for $12. She was pretty happy with the deal. I'm glad to have sold them, but I like the thought of spreading music to people even more.   I folded up a ton of clothes last night. I still have a lot to fold though. I need to empty the bottom drawer of my dresser to accomodate the other clothes (it's still filled with basketball cards). That'll be a pain in the ass.   So... I took some Melatonin last night. I'm not sure whether it worked or not. It took me a long while to get to sleep, but unlike the last few nights, I didn't get back out of bed during the night. However, I didn't sleep straight through the night either; I kept waking up and turning over.   I stayed in bed extra today, until 12:45pm. I woke up at 11:45am, but didn't feel like getting up yet. I feel a little better today, though still not "refreshed", and I am a little sleepy still, so I don't know how well the Melatonin actually worked, or if it did at all.    I got another lot of tapes in today, one that I had really been looking forward to (40 tapes including 4 Rush tapes & 2 Led Zeppelins), but most of the tapes are pretty crappy looking and I will have to do repairs on some of them because the the guy didn't pack them very securely. Asshole.   While I was waiting outside for the mailman, I noticed my black basketball lying next to the porch. I didn't remember bringing it outside (I figure Jess must've had it out there when he was down), so I went over to pick it and got a bit of a surprise... curling up behind it was a 2-foot Garter Snake! Yikes! I'm not scared of them, just surprised to see one. I haven't seen a snake around here for many, many years. He was a fast one too. I turned my back on him for a second to see if the mailman was here yet and when I turned back around he was gone. I saw him again as I was heading back into the house with the mail though, he was moving alongside the house, heading out towards the back yard. Slick one, he was!  Band practice tonight. I haven't practiced all week. Well, almost. I played in bed several times during the week and last night I played out on the porch as the sun was going down (there was a nice breeze out), but I haven't played along with the practice CDs or ran through any of the sets. I think once I get stabilized, get a job, get a daily schedule to go by, get a good night's sleep everynight, I will be able to devote more time to the music. Right now, everything is just a mess, scattered and disorganized, so I haven't been focusing on things like I should.    I'll post about band rehearsal later tonight.

        Wistful Wednesday   Not much going on today. I have no motivation whatsoever. I didn't sleep real well last night, no real surprise there, so I've been dragging all day today. I went to bed fairly early last night, just after Midnight, but by 2am I was out of bed again, unable to sleep. I was pretty darn tired too, but I just couldn't sleep. I got up, watched TV for awhile and went back to bed around 3:30am. I think I fell asleep somewhere between 4:30-5am, slept very inconsistently, and was up about 12:30pm, feeling totally unrefreshed.   I haven't done much today at all. I watched "Columbo", washed a load of clothes (but have yet to throw it in the dryer), cooked two hamburgers for lunch, played around on the PC and organized the tapes I got in today.    I'm really jonesing to get a job, anxious as hell, but having no energy all day and getting out of bed after Noon aren't helping me make any progress in that department. Tonight I start taking Melatonin, so hopefully all that will change. I'm so thrilled with the prospects of having a job again that I've been looking at stereos and PCs already! I have my first few paychecks spent and I don't even have a job yet!   I mentioned I got some tapes in today, but these still aren't the 97 that I have been waiting on for about a month now (I'm really getting irritated about that lot not having arrived yet), these were the two lots I won from the same guy, 48 tapes in all. Here's what I got:  Joan Armatrading "Track Record", "Square The Circle", & "Sleight Of Hand", Pat Benatar "In The Heat Of The Night" & "Wide Awake In Dreamland", Berlin "Pleasure Victim", B-52's "Wild Planet", "Party Mix/Mesopotamia", "Cosmic Thing", & "Good Stuff", Bow Wow Wow "When The Going Gets Tough The Tough Get Going",  Kim Carnes "Mistaken Identity", Elvis Costello "Spike", Crowded House "Crowded House", The Cure "Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me", Duran Duran "Notorious", The English Beat "Special Beat Service", Melissa Etheridge "Melissa Etheridge" & "Yes I Am", Eurythmics "Touch", "Revenge", & "We Too Are One", Falco "De Data Groove", 4 Non Blondes "...Bigger Better Faster More!", The Go-Go's "Vacation", Howard Jones "Dream Into Action", Kajagoogoo "White Feathers", Cyndi Lauper "She's So Unusual", Madness "Madness", Madonna "Madonna", "Like A Virgin", "Bedtime Stories", & "I'm Breathless", Men At Work "Cargo", The Mighty Lemon Drops "World Without End", The Psychedelic Furs "Mirroe Moves" & "MIdnight To Midnight", Ryuichi Sakamoto "Beauty", Scandal "Warrior", Peter Schilling "Error In The System", Simple Minds "Once Upon A Time", The Smiths "Strangeways Here We Come", Taco "After Eight", Tears For Fears "The Seeds Of Love", 10,000 Maniacs "Our Time In Eden", The Thompson Twins "Side Kicks" & "Close To The Bone".   They were hit and miss conditionwise, only a couple I may keep for myself, but the seller did throw in about 20 homemade tapes as well, which was nice. Luckily, I have 250 clear tape cases due in and I won an auction for 200 more of the clear/black ones today as well. I'm definitely going to need them!  I'm thinking about selling all of the tapes (about 500 of them so far) in the newspaper, a one-shot deal. If I could get $400 for all of them, I'd be very happy. Who knows, if the 97 ever arrive or the lot of 40 I have due in as well, the lot may be over 600 tapes strong. I think 625-650 tapes for $450 would be a pretty fair deal. Now I just need to find a buyer who thinks so as well.

        CD Shopping Spree   I got back from Best Buy a little while ago with  both  new Jimi Hendrix releases in hand! Sweet! I also picked up a 2-CD Bill Cosby import containing two of his albums that have not been released on CD in the US. I've been wanting that one for awhile. I almost picked up Dire Straits "Love Over Gold" as well, but I put it back at the last minute.   After Best Buy, we stopped at the Credit Union and I withdrew $20 so I could buy Mom and I dinner tonight (Chick-Fil-A) and have $9 for Thursday's band rehearsal. We didn't stop at Walgreens unfortunately, so I still have no Melatonin. I should sleep well tonight without it anyway. I'm pretty tired now and I've been active all day, plus I'm not going to drink any tea tonight (to limit my caffeine intake), so I should sleep ok tonight... hopefully.  I'm going to go fold clothes and listen to Jimi.   Speaking of clothes, I ruined my Aries t-shirt on the way out the door tonight, pissing me off greatly. Grrrrrrrr!!!!! It got torn on some broken, rusty  thingamajig  on the porch screen door. I'm not even sure what purpose the stupid piece of shit thing actually serves/served, but it took a chunk out of the fabric of my shirt. I don't have a whole lot of shirts to wear that actually fit me and being a fat guy, it's hard to find ones that do. The Aries t-shirt, in particular, was a favorite of mine. I always took good care of it too, which is unusual for me. I never even put it in the dryer (to protect the iron-on "Aries" decal), I always let it air-dry instead. And now it's fucked. Dammit.

        The Power Of Sleep   I didn't sleep well again, I was up and down a few times last night, but I did finally sleep for a decent amount of time. I think I finally fell asleep around 4am, and I stayed down until 1pm, although I'd been mostly awake since Noon. It wasn't straight sleep during that time, I was in and out of sleep as usual, but it was enough, I guess.   I am up and getting some things done finally, which is a nice change. I did two loads of laundry (so far) and took a much-needed shower, more than I've done in days. I think I'm going to go play guitar for awhile and then and clean my room, more much-needed stuff.  It's amazing how much a little sleep helps. I don't feel like I'm running on empty now, struggling to move at all, but I don't feel like I'm running on a full tank of gas either (more like 1/8 tank). One good solid night of sleep should help me out a great deal. I am going to take some Melatonin tonight, so hopefully that'll do the trick. We shall see.   A new Hendrix CD came out today, "Jimi Hendrix: Live At Berkeley (The Second Set)", his full second performance from the Berkeley Community Theater from May 30th, 1970 (one of my favorite shows), completely remastered! Another new one came out last week, "Martin Scorsese Presents The Blues: Jimi Hendrix", which has 2 unreleased tracks on it. I'm hoping to get them both tonight, if I can get a ride up to Best Buy. If not tonight, then tomorrow for sure.     Things are looking up.

        Rough Day   I went to bed last night around 2:45am, and then I was back out of bed about two hours later. I took some sleeping pills and was back in bed about 40 minutes later.  Less than two hours after going back to bed, I was out of bed again. I just could not sleep, no matter how dead tired I was (and am). The sleeping pills did absolutely nothing for me. I layed on the couch for a while, then the sun came out, and I tried watching another Vincent Price movie ("Madhouse", this time), but it sucked too much. I shut the TV off and talked to Mom a bit. I finally went to bed again around 9am, fell asleep about an hour later, and was back out of bed by 3pm. I was in and out of sleep the whole time. I think I might've got about 4 hours of sleep in all. Terrible.  I feel like shit. I'm exausted, beat, run-down; I have absolutely no energy whatsoever.   I really wanted to apply for that production job today, but I never made it there. I'm hoping I can sleep tonight. Tomorrow, I plan on buying some Melatonin, so that may help me some. We'll see.   I got two packages of tapes in today, about 100 tapes in all, and most were in really good shape. I got some good ones for myself out of the two lots. I may list them later, too tired now.   Wish I had something more to say, something upbeat and inspiring, but I just don't. Not today, anyway.

        Not Well   Somehow, I managed to get  some  stuff done tonight. I pulled, scanned, and listed cards all night long. Of course, not being entirely with it (from lack of sleep), I screwed up a good 1/3 of my auctions and had to spend an extra 1/2 hour fixing my mistakes. I was getting really pissed off at myself. This not-sleeping stuff is kicking my ass. Like I told my Mom tonight, I feel like I'm wearing down, and with the extra stress and strain I'm feeling, I wouldn't be surprised if a heart attack is in my immediate future... and I'm serious about that. I just do not feel well in any way, shape or form.   I'm supposed to go job hunting tomorrow morning, which is to say, in about seven hours, and I haven't done anything to get ready for it. I haven't washed my clothes, I haven't shaved, and most importantly, I haven't been to bed yet.    It's weird...I'm dead tired, but I'm not sleepy. I guess I'd better go and  try  to get some sleep anyhow.

        14 Hours   That's how long I was in bed last night. Unfortunately, I slept very little of that time. Same deal as yesterday, laying there thinking, but not really sleeping. Mom took tomorrow off to run me around to a few places to put in applications... I just hope I'm up and functioning. I'm up today, but I'm not functioning very well. I have no energy whatsoever, and all I feel like doing is going back to bed. It's terrible. I need to scan & list cards, do laundry, and shave, but I don't know if I'll be able to do any of that today. I am just dead tired, beat.

        Sleepless In The Sunshine State   I was planning on going up to New Port Richey today, to watch my nephew Jesse's football game, but that didn't happen. I just could not sleep last night. I went to bed around 12:45am, but when my alarm went off at 8:15am, I still had not slept a wink. My mind wouldn't shut down. Now and again I would slip into what seemed like a dream, but then I'd realize that I was just laying there thinking of stuff, not dreaming and definitely not sleeping. It's been a real problem for me. I've suffered from this shit for the last couple of years. Last year was especially bad, having gone through about two months of insomnia. Most nights it's a lot of tossing and turning and not being able to get comfortable, other nights, it's the complete inability to shut down and sleep. Even on the rare occasion that I am able to sleep through the night, I never wake up feeling refreshed, invigorated, ready to get and and get things done. Something is wrong with me. Somewhere along the way, I lost the ability to have a good night's sleep.   My nephew is disappointed that I didn't come up and watch him play, and now my sleep schedule is shot again.   I am a mess.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  A lot! I've been listening to the tapes I've been buying, making sure they work. I try to listen to a "couplefew" every day. I have Boston's "Third Stage" on right now, before that, I had on Prince, a couple Adam Ant tapes, Men At Work, and I tried playing a Doors tape that I got in today, but it doesn't work. That whole lot was a bunch of crap, for the most part. The packaging was terrible (the tapes were loose inside the box and looked like they were just thrown in the box), the tape cases were nasty looking (what few actually had cases), a lot of the tapes themselves were nasty looking too, some looked ok but played terribly, and some of them had the felt piece on the bottom falling out... this was the worst lot I've gotten in yet. I wish I had saved the $7.29 I spent on them. I knew as soon as I bid on them (I did it in a hurry, not readiing the description well) that I was going to be unhappy with this lot. The seller must've been on drugs. She said the lot was "spectacular" and "awesome". I would describe it as "craptacular" and "awful".    Watching on TV:  Not a lot this week. In the afternoon, "Columbo", in the evening, "Everybody Loves Raymond", later at night, The Daily Show" & "Tough Crowd w/ Colin Quinn". I did watch a few Howard Stern shows earlier in the week though, and I caught "Real Time w/ Bill Maher", as usual.     Downloading:  Nothing.     Playing:  Nothing.   Reading:  Nothing. Still have "Moby Dick" sitting there waiting to be read, but I keep looking at that collection of Dracula/vampire stories sitting on my shelf...    Jamming: We rehearsed last night and sucked (see 2 posts below). More practice required.    Working:  Still not working. I hope to get looking soon, Monday hopefully.     Buying:  I haven't bought anything this week... yet. Next week definitely though. A new Hendrix CD came out this week and another comes out next week and I want to buy them both.     Eating:  Mom and I are on a pizza & wings kick. Every Friday, that's what we've been ordering from Dino's. Good stuff, but so bad for us. I've been eating hamburgers or egg salad sammiches for lunch. Today I had a ham & cheddar cheese sammich. I've been eating ham & green beans (with potatoes) for dinner. Last night I had a sub from Subway though, the Chicken Pizziola with everything on it (it wasn't my idea, I'd asked for the Chipotle sub, but Mom forgot). I've been snacking on pumpkin seeds and oatmeal cookies. Mom's been buying soda again, so I had some Root Beer this week. I told her that soda "just on the weekend" wouldn't be too bad, but she brought some home on Wednesday.     Feeling:  Mentally: Out of it. I've slept horribly all week and have been too tired to think straight. Physically: Tired. Beat. Wiped out. Basically, hosed.    Planning:  Gotta get a job... still!

        R.I.P Johhny Cash   The world lost a great one today, a giant.   I first heard Johnny Cash when I was 12 years old. I was on vacation up in Pennsylvania, staying with my maternal grandparents, and my Grandmother had a bunch of Country Music 8-track tapes. I've always been a music lover, always been interested in hearing new music, plus, I think I was bored up there, so I wound up playing a bunch of her tapes. I didn't like most of the tapes she had, but I did like the ones by Johnny Cash. His music was different than any other music I'd ever heard, and with his voice, you almost  had to  listen to him. I think it's a tribute to his greatness that his music was able to get through to a 12 year old rock & roll fan.    Johnny Cash walked the line. He appeared to be an outlaw, always dressed in black with his tough as nails exterior, a badass for sure, but you knew he was really a good guy down inside, where it really mattered. He was dark and mysterious and his music was simple and eloquent. He could break your heart just as easily as he could kick your ass.   I'm really not much of a country music fan, especially this crap that passes for country music nowadays, but I've always loved and respected Johnny Cash.   He will be missed.  If you're so inclined, there is a nice  urlLink Johnny Cash thread over on a FARK , a great tribute to the man and his music. I got teary-eyed reading it myself, so be forewarned.   Incidentally, this is the second day in a row that a Fark thread has had that effect on me. Yesterday, being the 2nd anniversary of the Sept. 11th attacks, FARK re-published  urlLink their original thread from Sept. 11th, 2001 . I felt all the same emotions come back again reading it. It puts you right there again, in all of that day's surreal violence and intense sadness.

        Band Rehearsal   I knew it was going to be interesting, I didn't know it was going to suck so bad.   We were lousy tonight.   We got off to a really late start. Jimmy showed up an hour late, which is not cool, especially when we're all paying for our time there. When he finally showed, we ran through all of the new covers (except "Flake") and they turned out ok. The Lifehouse song turned out better than I'd imagined, but JP had a tough time singing a few of them and none of us had the material down pat (I guess I wasn't the only one slacking on practicing at home). I don't think we made it through any songs without someone screwing some part of it up, even on songs we've been doing for awhile. I don't know how we got so rusty so quickly. Pathetic.   It didn't help that I am was (and am) completely wiped out either. I tried taking a nap earlier, but don't think I slept more than 5 or 10 minutes.   I'll have to make a point of practicing at home more. Besides the new songs, I have to figure out solos for all of the songs where Ronnie was doing the solo. JP had his keyboard there and I was trying to get him to take the lead on one or two songs with the organ, but he really didn't want to, so I'll need to have something "just in case".   It was a weird and lousy practice, but I think we'll do better next time.    Bedtime.

        Wiped Out   I finally went to bed again around 5:30am last night, but I didn't fall asleep until much later, maybe 6:30am? I was up by 12:35pm and am feeling very trired. I'm dragging and my eyes are heavy. I can only hope that I will fall asleep nice and early tonight. I should be home from band rehearsal around 10:30pm, I'll take a shower, I'll watch TV for an hour and then I'll hit the sack at Midnight. That's my plan.  No mail for me today, but that guy who owes me $50 finally paid me (through Paypal) today. He really had me worried. The auctions ended awhile back, he was an eBay newbie (zero feedback), and he never responded to any of my emails, so I had no idea what was going on with him. I'm glad he made good; now my Gateway bill is paid for this month. Yippee!  I finally pulled out my electric guitar today and worked on some of the new covers. That Nirvana song, "Come As You Are" is going to be a little tricky, what with the effects and all (and me having never played it before). Also, I think I'm going to try something different for the White Stripes cover, "Fell In Love With A Girl" (not my choice); I think I'm going to play the "naa na na na naa na" bit on the guitar while JP sings it. It might sound pretty cool that way. I also have to listen to "Cold Shot" again too because I keep playing the rhythm a little differently than SRV played it. I have the Jack Johnson song down ("Flake"), but I want to try something different with the ending. I've done nothing with the Lifehouse song at all, other than look at the tablature for it.  It'll be an interesting practice.  I'm going to go try and take a nap now.

        Still Awake   I took a shower and headed to bed a little earlier tonight (before 2am), but I have been unable to fall asleep. My allergies/sinuses are bothering me really bad, cat hair, I think. Stevie was in bed with me for awhile (he seems to be shedding a bit) and now my eyes are itchy and red and my nose is stuffed up. I just took a Claritin, I'm hoping that'll help with that. I still have another problem though: I just can't get comfortable in bed. It's the temperature/circulation in my room that's causing it, but Mom won't let me keep the fan running continuously anymore. I'm going to have to talk her into letting it run at night and then I'll put it back on auto during the day, because this is ridiculous. I need my sleep.

        First Tapes Sold!   My friend Rob came over tonight and bought four tapes off me (Mickey Hart, The Damned, Social Distortion, and Jane's Addiction). I sold them to him for 0.75 each, a quarter less than what I plan on selling them for at the flea market. He was pretty happy. I played everything for him to make sure they worked ok.   I may sell most for 0.75 and price a few higher, $1 or more, depending on whether or not they are sealed or if they're in-demand artists (Beatles, Elvis, Hendrix, Zeppelin, etc..). I don't think I'd sell any for more than $2 though.  I still have about 350 tapes due in still. One lot is very late getting here. The auction ended on August 19th, 97 tapes for $10, a great bargain (if they ever show up). I emailed the guy about it and he said this:   nothing to be concerned about my friend i shipped the cassettes in two boxes. it was way to costly to send in one box since the auction ended so cheaply. my fault for not pricing shipping before hand. they shipped approximatley a week after the auction. i was on vacation around the time the auction ended and came back sick as a dog. so there was a delay in shipping. please forgive me but they are on the way.   Fair enough, until I started to wonder what the auction ending price has to do with the shipping weight. Why would he have to ship the lot in two boxes because "the auction ended so cheaply"? I don't get it. Sounds suspicious to me, and I have a bad feeling that only one box will show up (if any), but I'll just have to wait and see.

As I told my friend Sue the the other day, I am the #4 referrer on Google for  wanda sykes turd in car , which I seem to get quite often (I mentioned her infamous crank call on Crank Yankers in one of my posts awhile back).

        Xerox Copy Of Yesterday   Just like the day before, I stayed up too late (3am) and I got up too late (12:30pm). Unlike yesterday though, I had a  helluva  a time getting to sleep last night. I couldn't get comfortable and I felt uncomfortably warm. I finally got up at 5:30am and checked the thermostat and of course, Mom turned the fan off. I wish she'd leave the goddamned thing alone. I don't know how many times I have to tell her that I notice the temperature change and that it makes it difficult for me to sleep. Fuckin-a.   Also like yesterday, I got a of tapes in and all of the cases are filthy as hell. Some of the tapes are quite nasty too, but it looks like the majority are just fine, and four of them were still sealed. I paid $18.25 for the lot (65 tapes), which is probably a little more than I should have spent. I don't feel like listing everything, so I'll list some of the ones I'm keeping for myself:  The Cars "Shake It Up", Steve Martin "A Wild And Crazy Guy", Ratt "Invasion Of Your Privacy", Richard Pryor "Live", Dire Straits "Brothers In Arms" & "On Every Street",  Tom Petty "Southern Accents", AC/DC "Who Made Who", Bonnie Raitt "Luck Of The Draw", George Thorogood "Maverick", Duran Duran "Rio", and John Cougar Mellencamp "Whenever We Wanted".   I worked on re-casing and organizing tapes for awhile then I did a little cleaning in the hobby room, organizing bubble envelopes and other packing materials. I need to do some major work in there. Between my cards and my tapes, I could really use the room. I may work on it tonight.   I still haven't picked up my electric guitar yet. We have practice tomorrow night and I haven't practiced one lick, literally. I've just been getting up too damn late. I normally would practice in the late morning/early afternoon, but I'm sleeping past then. By the time I am ready to play now, Mom is home and I have to keep it down... too much of a hassle, so I just put it off. Not good.   Speaking of Mom, she's taking next Monday off from work to drive me around, trying to find a job. She has a ton of vacation time to use, and if she doesn't use it, she loses it, so I asked her if she could take a day or two and take me around to put in applications at a few places. I just hope there are more jobs in next Sunday's paper than their were in last Sunday's. It's really tough around here right now. I guess it's pretty tough all over, actually. Anyway, this means I absolutely  must  get back to getting up in the mornings again. I can't have Mom take the day off and then sleep in til after Noon. I guess I'd better hit the sack before Midnight tonight.

        Deja Tuesday   I did it again. I stayed up way too late last night, doing nothing worthwhile, and slept in way too late (I got up about 12:30pm today). I stayed up until a little after 3am doing absolutely nothing, and knowing I was was doing nothing while I was doing nothing, but staying up anyway for no good reason at all.   I'm a dumbass.   I felt good when I woke up though. Shortly after getting up, the mailman came and delivered me another package of tapes (he came early today). Unfortunately, it was a pretty shitty lot: they smelled funny, felt sort of damp, and the cases are totally filthy. Again I ask: what the fuck do people do with these things? Drag them behind their cars? Christ! Some of the tapes inside of the nasty cases are crappy, but some are just fine. Some appear fine, but the little square piece of felt (on the bottom side under the tape itself) has fallen out of a lot of them. I'll have to glue them back on. There were about 70 tapes in there, many of them singles (with badly worn covers). I spent $15 on the whole lot ...not a great buy. I got a few keepers for myself out of it, but it seems to be more trouble than it was worth. I have almost 400 more tapes coming, I'm hoping the rest are much nicer than this batch.   I worked on the tape stuff awhile (organizing them, re-casing them, playing them) and then I cleaned up my folders in Outlook Express. I should've practiced on guitar, but I didn't. I still haven't played my electric for about two weeks. Tonight, I watched TV instead. Mom picked up some pumpkin seeds for me, so I watched TV and ate pumpkin seeds.   I'm a dumbass.

        urlLink Tuesday Chooseday    Would you rather:   Marry a complete stranger and spend 18 hours a day with them OR marry your soulmate and best friend, but never get to spend more than 2 hours a day with them?    The complete stranger thing could be interesting, if we got along well and learned to love each other, but if we didn't...  In truth, I value and respect marriage too much to jump into it with a total stranger. If I'm going to marry someone, it's going to be someone I really love and want to be with, a soulmate and best friend, someone who loves me and wants to be with me too.   Have lice OR tapeworms?    Lice. Long ago, I saw a documentary about the terrible health conditions in parts of Africa and I saw one person hold out their arm and you could see a long worm wriggling  under their skin , another had a tiny one moving around  in their eye ... it totally freaked me out. There were some even more disgusting ones too, but I don't even want to think about them. I mean, just  the thought  of having worms moving around inside my body... (shivers). So yeah, lice would be better. They are external and I could kill them easily enough.    Be known as a mean drunk OR a complete prude?    I'd rather be a complete prude. A mean drunk is hurtful to people, a prude isn't.    Have both big toes cut off with a hacksaw OR slam your finger in a car door ... 15 times?   I don't gamble with the Mob, so there's no reason to pick either of these options. However, if I had to choose, I'd go with slamming  a finger  in a car door 15 times... just as long as I get to choose which finger (because I'm a guitar player, with few fingers to spare).

        Monday Mania   I was up at Noon today, which is not good, but I woke up thinking I had slept til 1am, so it could've been worse. I didn't want to go to bed last night, even though I knew I should and even though I really wasn't doing anything anyway. I'm weird like that sometimes.   It's not like I have anything to do before Noon anyway. I can't go out job hunting until I get a bus pass or have someone to drive me around and the mailman doesn't go until well after Noon, so I missed nothing. It's still a bad habit though, since I will need to keep daytime hours for a job, when I do get one.   I got a few jobs today, though none were paying. Mom left me a "to do" list in my email today, a handful of little things to do around the house. I still have one to do, and I'm going to hit that shortly.   I had better luck with the real mail. The mailman came late today, but he brought goodies with him! I got a huge package filled with over 110 tapes, which included 3 carrying cases for them (one of them looks brand new). This was the big Country music lot I bought for just $15.51, a total steal! I'm not much of a Country fan myself, but it's quite popular with a lot of folks around here, so I thought it'd be a decent investment. Lots of big names: Willie Nelson, George Strait, Merle Haggard, Travis Tritt, Alan Jackson, The Judds, Conway Twitty, Alabama, Clint Black, Lorrie Morgan, Hank Williams Jr, Waylon Jennings, Brooks & Dunn, etc... There were a handful of rock tapes in the lot as well: Billy Joel, Bob Seger, Fleetwood Mac, and Boston, to name a few. About all of the plastic cases looked shitty, worn and nasty, but almost all of the tapes and inserts are in great shape. There are a few clunkers here and there, but still, well worth the money.    I got a smaller package of goodies in as well, a lot of 30 tapes that also came with a carrying case. It's a strange mix of music. I paid $6.50 for the whole thing and got:   AC/DC's "Who Made Who", Aerosmith "Greatest Hits", Autograph "Sign in Please", DeBarge "Rhythm of the Night", "Beverly Hills Cop" Soundtrack, Def Leppard's "On Through The Night" & "Pyromania", Eazy-E "Eazy-Duz-It", J.Geils Band's "Freeze Frame", Groovechild "Sick At Last", MC Hammer "Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em", King's X "Faith Hope Love", KISS "Revenge", Motley Cre "Theatre of Pain", Natural Selection "Natural Selection", Ozzy Osbourne's "Blizzard Of Ozz", Robert Plant's "Now And Zen", Queen's"Live Killers" & "Classic Queen", The Romantics "What I Like About You (& Other Romantic Hits)", Run-D.M.C. "Run-D.M.C", Joe Satriani "Dreaming #11", Steelheart "Steelheart", Tears for Fears "Songs from the Big Chair", Urban Dance Squad "Mental Floss for the Globe", Van Halen "Van Halen", Warrant "Dirty Rotten Filthy Stinking Rich", "#1 Hits Of The '80's" (a compliation), and a sound effects tape.   The rest are cassette singles. Most of these tapes appear to be in really good shape, only a few clunkers (notably, the insert to the AC/DC tape looks like someone had practiced origami on it). Real good buy for $6.50 though.   I also got two payments in today too, which is good. I now have $5 cash in my wallet! Yay! Unfortunately, I need $9 for band rehearsal on Thursday. D'oh!  I worked on a few of those new cover tunes we're supposed to be learning and two of them look like real pains in the ass to learn: the Nirvana song is tuned down to a D and the Lifehouse song uses a Dropped D tuning... I can barely keep my guitar in Standard tuning as is. I'm doomed.

        I Get Around   Ha! I was looking at my site Meter Details and I found that, for some odd reason, I'd made it to  urlLink someone elses's blog , a total stranger! Here's what he said about me:   "Gary seems to collect and sell cassette tapes. He was sad when Stevie Ray Vaughn died."   Ha! Nice summarization, guy!   Too funny!

        UGH!   I don't know what the hell happened, but sometime between 8pm and 9pm, my high-speed broadband internet connection started crawling. Very frustrating! I'd try to go to eBay and it would take 5-10 minutes to open each page, if at all. Sometimes, it would stall out and give me that "unable to connect" notice. What a pain in the ass! So instead of listing 80 auctions tonight, I only did 50. Damn!  No pretzel yet... but soon... soon.

        My 1,000th Hit   My hit counter is at 997, soon to hit 1,000. I think it's pretty cool that that many people have visited my site, though most have merely looked in and split. I guess I'm just not that interesting or entertaining. Anyhow, to celebrate my 1,000th hit, I'm going to say "oh, cool", and then I'm going to eat a pretzel. And unlike our President, I will not choke on it, I will not faint, and I will not bruise my face. I'll just chew it and swallow it, though I may wash it down with some root beer.   Wish me luck!

        Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawn.   My dumbass self, I stayed up til 4:30am last night watching a really bad movie (Vincent Price's "Theater Of Blood"). Don't ask me why I did it, because I don't know why. I wish I hadn't.   Still, I managed to get up before 11am today. I tried to win some big cassette auctions and lost all of them. I did win one small one though; I got 25 tapes for $7.24 (includes shipping). Unfortunately, most of them suck. I mainly bought it for a handful in the lot that I wanted for myself: Foreigner "4", "Double Vision", & "The Very Best...and Beyond", Journey "Escape", Elton John "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road", ELO "Discovery", Reo Speedwagon "A Decade of Rock and Roll 1970-1980", and Eddie Money "Greatest Hits". I may keep Billy Joel's "Cold Spring Harbor" too. The rest is pure '80's cheese: Culture Club, Richard Marx, Peter Cetera, George Michael, etc... ick. They do not rock.   I wanted to take a nap this afternoon, but instead I played with the cats and watched TV. I did all of my scanning as well. I will start listing auctions shortly. I'm going to try for 75 new auctions this week and I may re-list some older ones as well.   I'm tired.   Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawn.

        Saturday   Friday night, before I went to bed, I tried playing that Stevie Ray Vaughan tape again, the one I got at the flea market (for a quarter) that didn't work, and it played much better this time. It's messed up in the middle though, unkeepable and unsellable. I'll give it to Jess, maybe he'll listen to it. Anyway, I had that on and was sitting by candle light listening to it while sipping hot tea. It's really the first time I've sat and listened to that album, "Texas Flood" (his debut), in well over a decade, since before he died (I couldn't listen to his music for a long, long time after he had died). It's such a great album, and his guitar playing is just as impressive today as it was then. Like Jimi Hendrix, his idol (and mine), Stevie's death was a huge loss, but his music lives on as a testament to his greatness.   I went to bed after I listened to "Texas Flood", sometime after 1am, and slept until 11:30am (not good). I had only two errands to run today: the post office and the ATM (to make a deposit). I had gotten all of my postal stuff ready the night before, so I was all ready to go, but I had to wait for the mailman to go first, in case I got any more payments in. No payments, but I did get another little package of cassettes in. Here's what I got:   The Cars "The Cars" & "Heartbeat City", Don Henley "I Can't Stand Still", Phil Collins "No Jacket Required", Mike + The Mechanics "Mike + The Mechanics",  Peter Gabriel "So", Elton John "Greatest Hits", Huey Lewis and The News "Sports", Rick Springfield "Tao", Dire Straits "Love Over Gold" & "Brothers In Arms", Joe Jackson "Night and Day", Donovan "Greatest Hits", "Ghostbusters" Soundtrack, Prince "Purple Rain", Bryan Adams "Cuts Like A Knife".   I paid $4.24 for the whole lot. The cases were shitty, the self-titled Cars tape is trashed, the Bryan Adams insert has some water (soda?) damage, both Dire Straits tapes have bent up covers, and the Donovan tape is bad (looks like it was eaten before). The rest look good though, hopefully they'll all play fine.   Including that Donovan tape, I had to chuck three tapes today because they didn't play right. I think I've chucked about ten in all, so far. I'm re-thinking this whole cassette selling thing. I just don't know how many people are buying them anymore. Besides, the cost per tape to me is probably too high. If I didn't have to replace cases it wouldn't be so bad, but most are absolutely filthy. If I were a customer, I know I wouldn't even want to touch some of them, the way they look. Also, all of these bad tapes I'm finding, that I can't sell, makes my costs per tape even higher. I guess at this point, with over 700 cassettes bought, I'll just have to try it and see what happens. Worst case scenario: I'm stuck with a lot of music. I can live with that.   I was looking at CD lots on eBay today, but I don't think I could order CDs sight unseen. I just don't trust people's assessment of their CD conditions enough to try it, especially at about $2 per disc.   I didn't get any more payments in, so we split to run my two errands. On the way home we stopped off at Checkers, came home, and chowed down. I played a Dan Fogelberg tape while we ate. Mom liked it a lot. I was stuffed from the Checkers chow, and headed for the couch. Mom went to her room and napped and I layed down on the couch with Stevie and napped.   While I was laying there, the sky cleared up. The gray clouds disappeared and the blue sky was back. It started getting really hot in the house, uncomfortable. Damn! What happened to Henri? What a wimp-ass storm! I was hoping, expecting, several more days of rain. Grrrr!!!  Anyways, I wound up staying down too long and felt like crap when I got up. I felt like I had a headache and an earache about to happen (if that makes any sense).   Stevie had napped with me the whole time. He seemed well rested and refreshed. I need to be a cat. What a life...   I didn't do any auction stuff, like I should have. I will be busy tomorrow for sure. Instead I went through all of the auctions I've sold and looked for the later payers, sending out reminders and Non-Paying Bidder Alerts. I have about $120 due in still. I hate late payers. I always pay within days of winning, usually within minutes. I don't understand how you can bid on something and not pay for a month. That is  so  inconsiderate and rude!   After I finished with that, Mom came out and I started dinner for us (it was more like a breakfast). I made hash browns and kielbasa, but I had to run to the bathroom, so Mom finished it. She made eggs as well. I played a Boz Scaggs tape as we ate, "Silk Degrees".   I had Bull Riding on most of the night, but I hardly watched any of it. I've been listening to tapes mostly, checking them to make sure they're ok and also trying out new stuff I've never heard before. I've been listening to ABC's 'How To Be A Zillionaire" as I blogged this. Its not bad, but it's nothing I'd play regularly. In other words, it doesn't rock.   I don't rock either. Not lately anyhow. I haven't picked up the electric guitar since Santana's Labor Day party. Not good. With Ronnie gone, I'm going to be responsible for all of the soloing, and we've added several new cover songs that are very guitar-driven... I really need to get my ass in gear. I don't want to be the weak spot in the band. I need to start practicing at least 1 hour a day. I just have to figure out when and where. I've been staying out in the living room all week because I didn't want to miss the mailman, UPS or Fedex (I wouldn't hear them from my room). I guess I'll need to practice out here.   I expect to be working on auctions almost all day Sunday.

        Another Try   I wrote a whole huge post earlier and it disappeared as I tried to publish it. Dammit. I hate that shit! I'm going to try and re-write what I wrote previously, hopefully it'll work this time. Here goes...  It has been been raining steadily for the past few days, day and night, gray skies and drizzle mostly. I live on the west coast of Florida, and right now, we have Tropical Strom "Henri" heading our way, ensuring several more days of wetness. I don't mind this weather at all, in fact, I love this kind of weather. I find the rain very relaxing, soothing, and because the skies are overcast, the sun hasn't been out, pounding me with heat as usual. It's nice.  It's great sleeping weather too, perfect for snuggling up in my covers and reading or napping or whatever. The only thing better would be to have someone to snuggle up with.   I don't know if it's the weather or what, but I've been sleeping in too late all week. Last week, I was getting up around 8am, but this week I'm getting up around 10am. Today, I slept until 11am. Not good. I think the reason I slept so long today was because of Jimmy (one of my cats) waking me up last night.  I was dead asleep last night, and suddenly I was woken up by Jimmy jumping up on my bed, or more accurately, jumping up on top of me while I was lying in my bed. He's not a lightweight. He walked up my back, settled on my shoulders, and started meowing. I was half asleep and was trying to figure out whether he just wanted some attention or if there was something wrong. He just wanted some attention. I scratched his head a little and started falling asleep again, but he wanted more attention and began sticking his face in mine, which is irritating as hell. I can't stand cat whiskers tickling my nose. I got him to lie down for a minute, but then he was off, getting into stuff in my room.   Jimmy doesn't come into my room much, but when he does, he always makes a nuisance out of himself. He doesn't know how to just chill, like his brother does; Jimmy's always doing something, getting into something. In the dark, and half asleep, it is particularly annoying because I can't see what it is he's doing, I just hear things. Luckily, he didn't stay too long last night.   Got off on a bit of a "cat tangent" there, but anyway, I do need to get back to last week's schedule: in bed by Midnight, up by 8am. I need to keep it that way so I can get a job, and for when I go set up at the flea market (I'll have to be up by 6am for that).   Speaking of which, I got a little more "stock" in today. A lot of 26 tapes arrived, mostly easy listening/soft rock, but there are a few good ones in there that I will keep for myself. I paid $11.31 for the lot, here is what I got:   Bryan Adams "Into The Fire", Air Supply "Greatest Hits", David Bowie "Let's Dance", Bread "Anthology", Peabo Bryson "Straight From The Heart", Cheap Trick "At Budokan", Phil Collins "Hello, I Must Be Going" & "No Jacket Required", The Commodores "Nightshift", Creedence Clearwater Revival "Chronicle", Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young "So Far", Bryan Ferry "Street Life: 20 Greatest Hits", Genesis "Genesis" & "Invisable Touch", Gold and Platunum "Vol 2.", Elton John "Leather Jackets", Kansas "The Best of Kansas", REO Speedwagon "Hi Infidelity", Lionel Richie "Cant Slow Down", Simply Red "Picture Book", Barbra Streisand "Memories", Toto "TotoIV", Pete Townsend "White City: A Novel", Yes "90125"  One other tape I got was bad, Genesis "Abacab", which sucks. I was looking forward to hearing that one again. Someone taped some crappy dance music over it. Moron. The Cheap Trick tape may be bad too, I will have to play it later. I put it on for a few seconds earlier and I thought I heard some tape flutter. I paid a little more per tape than I normally would (about .45 each), but I had planned on keeping about 8 of them for myself, so a little extra was ok.   Besides the tapes, I got two payments in today too, $25 worth, which will go to Mom.   Oh, I won another tape auction today. Kind of a mistake though. I opened it with 40 seconds left and, panicking, put a quick bid in without reading the description well. It was a 55 tape lot, but only about 25 of the tapes even have cases (I don't know whether that means they have cases  and  inserts, or just cases), there's another 20 tapes with no cases and presumably no inserts, and the rest are just homemade copies. Not a great auction. I probably shouldn't have bid at all, but as I said, I panicked. I won the whole lot for $7.29 (includes shipping). Not a great buy, but i will live with it.  I think that's about all I had posted before. Man, that was annoying. Weird too. I posted my blog but instead of going through, I got a log-in page. Then, I hit the back button and I got  someone else's  blog screen ("Welcome back, Gilda"). Of course, me being me, I left a little message there for her, just to make her scratch her head.   That's kind of scary though. I mean, if I were a malicious person, I could've deleted her whole blog, just to be a dick. I wonder if mine was open to someone else.   (shivers)  Anyway, I hope this one goes through.

         urlLink The Friday Five     1. What housekeeping chore(s) do you hate doing the most?   I hate washing the dishes. I always wind up splashing dishwater on my belly, soaking my shirt, and I can't stand that. I also hate trying to fit my hands inside of cups. I know, I know... I could just get an apron and they probably make some gizmo to wash inside of cups, but I don't have them and I'm not looking either.   It's kind of weird, I didn't mind doing dishes when I worked as a dishwasher (as a teenager), but I've  always  hated doing them at home, even as a kid.   2. Are there any that you like or don't mind doing?   I don't mind vacuuming, doing laundry, or taking the trash out. Sweeping the kitchen or the porch is ok too.    3. Do you have a routine throughout the week or just clean as it's needed?   I  need  a routine. The amount of cleaning I do depends heavily on  1) if company is expected or 2) where or not I can stand looking at the mess anymore. Sad.   4. Do you have any odd cleaning/housekeeping quirks or rules?   No, not really.    5. What was the last thing you cleaned?   Probably the kitchen counter. I always make a mess with tea bags and empty Equal packets (but I do clean them up).

        Better Mood   As I was writing my last post, I had an auction go off that did better than I'd hoped, and the guy paid for it instantly with Paypal! Yay! I was able to pay for the last three auctions I won (I'm all caught up again), plus I was able to send $20 to Mom's Paypal account so she can pay for the last few she won. I'm very happy about that!  Shortly after, the UPS truck came and delivered one of the packages I was expecting, a lot of 37 tapes + a 3-drawer case (I paid $10 in total). A few of the tapes are no good, 5 of them, but the rest look great, nice and clean. Unfortunately, the drawers of the case are damaged and the case is pretty much unusable now. Still, $10 for 32 good tapes isn't bad, that's a little over .31 each, a little more than I'd normally pay for tapes that I'm selling, but I think I'm going to keep several of them for myself. Here's what I got in this lot (excluding the unusable stuff):  The Beatles "1967-1970", The Cars "Greatest Hits", Journey "Trial By Fire" Foreigner "Records", Bryan Adams "Into The Fire" & "Cuts Like A Knife", Bob Seger "Stranger In Town", Bruce Springsteen "Born In The USA", Elvis Presley "Number One Hits",  Madonna "Bedtime Stories" & "Erotica", Van Halen "OU812", "5150", & "1984", Bon Jovi "New Jersey", "Keep The Faith", & "Cross Road", Boston "Boston" & "Don't Look Back", AC/DC: "Live", ZZ Top "Eliminator", Cinderella "Long Cold Winter", George Strait "Easy Come Easy Go", Amy Grant "Lead Me On" & "The Collection", Celine Dion "Falling Into You", Tiffany "Hold An Old Friends Hand",  "Cocktail" Soundtrack, "Jurrassic" Soundtrack, "The Preacher's Wife" Soundtrack, "The Bodyguard" Soundtrack, and "Kids Birthday Dance Party Favorites".  I may give Mom a few of them (if she wants them), I'll keep some, and I figure I'll sell about 15 of them.    I'm less grumbly now.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  I had a killer tape on last night, Fleetwood Mac's self-titled album from 1975. Man! That is a  great  album! I put it on as I was lying down to sleep and I wound up listening to it twice! I've got Pat Benatar's "Live From Earth" tape on right now.    Watching on TV:  In the daytime, I'm getting in the habit of watching "Quincy M.E." from Noon-1pm, then "Columbo", from 1pm-2:30pm (sometimes 3pm). I've still got the same evening routine: "Simpsons" at 6pm, two "Everybody Loves Raymond" episodes from 6:30pm-7:30pm, and then "Seinfeld" from 7:30pm-8pm. I don't usually watch much TV after that, not until 11pm, when I watch "The Daily Show", followed by "Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn", which is on til Midnight. That's pretty much my M-F schedule (except band practice night). I always catch "Real Time with Bill Maher" each week, and somewhere in there, I'll watch "Saturday Night Live", "Late Night with Conan O'Brien", "Insomniac with Dave Attell', "Reno 911", "Trading Spaces", "While You Were Out", Bull Riding, and CNN. I watch "I'm With Busey" once in awhile too, but it's getting really hokey, too staged. I may also watch whatever's interesting on The Learning Channel, The Discovery Channel, and The History Channel too. That seems like a lot of TV watching, but a lot of that time I'm watching TV while on the PC or eating lunch or dinner. Still...     Downloading:  Last night, I downloaded a couple of songs we're going to be playing with the band. These are going to be "interesting", to say the least.     Playing:  I played Rummy with Jess when he was down, but that's about it.  Nothing on the computer.     Reading:  Nothing still. I have to get into the habit of reading during the day.    Jamming:  We skipped it this week, opting for a band meeting instead (last night). Next week we begin again as a quartet, practing over at Circle, which has much better air-conditioning.   Working:  Not working, not really looking either, which is very bad. I've been waiting for my tapes to arrive all week and I put off leaving the house to go job hunting. Plus, I haven't had any cash at all, so I had no busfare to go either. It sucks being broke.     Buying:  Nothing for a couple of days. There are a couple cassette lots I may bid on though, even though I really can't afford to. I have very little self-control.    Eating:  For lunches, it's mostly been tuna fish, egg salad, or hamburgers. For dinners, we've had broiled BBQ chicken pieces, meatloaf (with corn on the cob & potato salad), and when Jess was down, Sonnys BBQ.    Feeling:  Mentally: anxious, frustrated, angry, and insecure. Physically, I've been feeling ok. A little tired, but OK. My sinuses have been bad, but after I take a pill, they're tolerable.    Planning:  Gotta get a JOB!

        Grumblings   I know I've been doing a lot of grumbling here lately, it's probably not much fun to read, but it's true reflection of how I'm feeling: angry and frustrated. I hate owing people money and I hate not having money of my own. I hate all of this sitting around waiting for things to happen. And most of all, I hate the helplessness I feel, feeling like I can't do anything on my own. I'm one messed up, unhappy puppy.  I got just one payment in today. One. For $5.00... a far cry from what I need. I have about $150 due in,  that's  how much I need. No tape-filled packages for me either. I have about 10 of those due in. Very frustrating.  I played a few tapes in my room, checking them out, and found several that look perfect but work like shit. They screech very loudly in the player. Yay. I guess I'm going to have to check out all of them before I sell them.   Speaking of which, I called the USA Flea Market to get prices and they're a bit higher than the two down here, about $18 a day, which means I have to sell 18 tapes just pay for the table, and another 5 tapes just to break even. I definitely will need to bring my best tapes along if I'm going to be able to do that, so I'll have to put off the flea market for another week. Hopefully some of my packages will have arrived by then.    I called my bank today, the International Money Orders I got in are ok, no $15 charges, because they're drawn on American Banks. That's some good news anyhow.

        Wednesday Night   I just got back from the band meeting (we met over at The Wing House). We sat around talking and drinking most of the time. The guys had wings and bought beer and of course, I had no money for anything. I totally felt like a jerk. The odd man out. They bought a couple pitchers of beer and I had some too. I hate that. I felt like such a leech. We did get some work done, we got a few new cover songs chosen (JP wants more modern songs) and we talked over the Ronnie/Santana situation and talked about some songs that we need to tighten. We were there for over three hours. Afterwards, JP came over and we worked on a couple newer songs that we're going to cover. He didn't stay long. We're going to practice next Thursday over at Circle (three hours), just the four of us, so I really need to get practicing daily again.   By the way, I got absolutely no mail in today... nothing. Dammit. I'm getting very frustrated.   Speaking of frustrated... the system restore I did earlier appears to have removed a Norton Anti-Virus file somehow, and after I re-started my computer, it wouldn't start-up again. I kept getting a "NAV Auto Protect" message telling me a NAV.dll file was missing. I kept having to go into safe mode to get to my desktop, every time I booted to normal mode, I got the NAV warning. I took Norton off my start-up list and then I kept getting the Microsoft Blue Screen Of Death. It took me over two hours of struggling, but I finally have it up and running, with everything back to normal again. To fix the problems, I had to undo my sytem restore (I did a system restore initially to get rid of whatever that last Windows Update did), then I re-installed Norton (over Norton), but that didn't work, so I had to unistall Norton altogether, and then I re-installed it all over again after I did a new system restore. What a pain in the ass!

        Sitting Around, Waiting   That's my day so far, just sitting around waiting on mail and phone calls. I was up by 10am, which is good (I was afraid I was going to sleep until Noon... or later), but I still haven't done jack all day. I played around on the computer and did a system restore to fix a problem I was having (when I'd open a 2nd window, it wouldn't open full size, but as a minimized box) and then I watched half a "Quincy M.E." and a whole "Columbo". I have a lot of stuff I can, and should, be doing, but I'm trying to stay out in the living room so I don't miss the mail or UPS or Fedex if and when they come.   Like I said, no mail yet. I'm anxious to get these tapes in, maybe over-anxious. I don't have a lot of patience anyway, and what little I do have is being tested. I want to put together a nice table full of items (for the flea market this weekend) but the majority of the tapes I got in so far aren't top-notch. I can't make definite plans to do the flea market if I don't have enough decent merchandise to sell. I'm also worried about the money that's due in. One guy, in particular, owes me $50 still. I sent out payment reminders to him last night, but he still hasn't made any contact with me yet, which worries me.   I may or may not have a problem with my bank too. In my auctions I clearly state "PLEASE, NO INTERNATIONAL MONEY ORDERS!", in all caps, just like that, but this week I got three of them in, all from American buyers. My stupid bank charges $15 to cash each International Money Order, but it's not altogether clear which ones they charge for and which ones they don't. You know, they actually charged me $15 to cash a $12 check before. How ignorant is that? Whatever happened to common sense and courtesy? People just don't care anymore.   I guess I'm going to go make some tuna.  Come on, mailman!

        Late Tuesday   I should have been in bed about 3 hours ago. Not good, I'm slipping back to my old ways again. I will be heading to bed soon, but not soon enough.   I was up late packaging eBay stuff to mailing tomorrow (today). I should've started on it sooner, but I kept putting it off all night.   That seller I was angry at earlier met me halfway and is only charging $1.50 handling rather than $3.00. We had a very civil disagreement and compromised on it. It's nice when things can be settled peacefully like that without resorting to name calling and nasty comments.   JP called me back tonight, Santana and Ronnie are definitely out. On good terms too, it appears, which is good. No band practice this week then, but we're probably going to get together on Thursday to talk and plan. JP wants us to do some different covers, but he wants them from 1990 to present, nothing older, which I find pretty ridiculous. He says he doesn't want a classic rock band. Me and Jimmy are big classic rock fans, Al too, and there just isn't that much good music being made these days that we could cover. I think this is going to be a problem for me. I don't want to play crap music just because it's contemporary.   I won 2 more cassette tape lots tonight. This guy had three lots on and I wanted them all, but the one I wanted most, which had tapes in it that I wanted for myself, I lost. I got outbid a lot today, which sucks, but which also good because I really can't afford them anyway. I've been trying to get enough "stock", so I can start doing the flea market soon.   Tomorrow, I expect a lot of tapes and payments in (as I have been), I'd like to do laundry and clean house too, and I need to look in the paper for work. I may shave too. It's 3am now, and I'm going to try to be up by 10am, but most likely I'll be up around 11 or 12.

        Tuesday   I got another package of tapes in today. They weren't as nice as I'd hoped, but, I did get more than I bargained for. It was supposed to be a lot of 30 tapes and what I got was a big padded case with 30 tapes on one side and another 30 on the other. Now, about 15 of them were totally unusable (either damaged, home-recorded tapes, or empty cases), but the rest were ok. Fair condition, I'd say. I'm going to have to play them all to make sure they're ok. They look like they're very, very old. Here's a list of what I got:  Bryan Adams "Reckless", Aerosmith "Toys In The Attic", Pat Benatar "Precious Time', "Crimes Of Passion", "Get Nervous" & "Live From Earth", "The Big Chill" Soundtrack, Boston "Don't Look Back", Peabo Bryson "Straight From The Heart", Phil Collins "Face Value", Culture Club "Colour By Numbers", Dead Or Alive "Youthquake", Def Leppard "Pyromania", Duran Duran "Seven And The Ragged Tiger", Fleetwood Mac "Fleetwood Mac", Dan Fogelberg "Greatest Hits", "Footloose" Soundtrack, Genesis - Genesis", Genesis "Wind & Wuthering", Go-Go's "Vacation", Hall & Oates "H2O", Billy Joel "The Stranger", "Songs In The Attic" & "An Innocent Man", Journey "Escape", Cyndi lauper "She's So Unusual", Loverboy "Get Lucky", Lynyrd Skynyrd "Gold & Platinum", Madonna - "Madonna", The Police "Zenyatta Mondatta", & "Ghost In The Machine", Synchronicity", Quiet Riot "Metal Health", Eddie Rabbit "Greatest Hits Vol. 2", The Romantics "In Heat", Boz Scaggs "Silk Degrees", "Down Two Then Left", & "Middle Man", Bruce Springsteen "The River", Squeeze "Singles - 45's And Under", Cat Stevens "Tea For The Tillerman", Styx "The Grand Illusion", Survivor "Vital Signs", Thompson Twins "Close To The Bone", and Peter Wolf "Lights Out".   Like I said, I wasn't real happy with their condition, but I did get more than I bargained for, so... whatever. Another "eh" shipment of tapes.  I won another lot on eBay today, lots of decent tapes, but the seller pissed me off. I had emailed her  five days ago  and asked if she'd ship via Media Mail, to save money on shipping costs, and she said she would. So today I won her auction, bidding the absolute maximum I was willing to spend, and after the auction, she sent me an invoice with my total on it: auction cost + Media mail shipping + $3.00 handling charge. She had never mentioned a handling charge before. There is no mention of a handling charge in her auction description anywhere (a violation of eBay's rules). This angered me a great deal. I emailed her and told her it wasn't right for her to do that. I let her know I am displeased.  So that had me mad for awhile, and then the mailman didn't show up until after 5pm today and he had only 3 payments for me and no packages. I was expecting a whole flood of both today. I borrowed money from Mom to pay my bills and I was hoping I'd have enough in today to pay her back. I'm not happy.   I got a call from JP too. He said we're going to practice with Santana and Ronnie over at Santana's on Wednesday. I thought it was settled, that we were splitting apart from those guys, but apparently not. I don't think it's right to practice with them,  at their place ,  if we're just going to dump them anyway. I'd rather not practice at all this week than do that. JP said he's going to talk to Santana and sort it all out, but I think that's going to waste a lot more time. Either do it or don't.   This also means I will need $14 for tomoorw night too.   Dammit.

        Labor Day   I had trouble sleeping again last night, luckily, I was up by 11am anyway. Jess got up about 1/2 later. He'd fallen asleep on the couch last night and I let him sleep there, but around 3am, he got up and went to my Mom's room. He was in a weird mood all day today, not a lot of fun to be around. I don't know if he was bored or tired or what, but it was very frustrating. I'd talk to him and he'd ignore me, like he was zoning out (or tuning me out). I think he was just ready to go home.   We made new paper airplanes today and tried flying them, but there was barely a breeze and the heat outside was intense, so we came back in. He had a bad attitude outside anyway, complaining about how much his plane sucked. I cooked hamburgers for all of us (Mom made potato salad) and we chowed down. Jess pepped up a bit after we went to my room and played cards again (Rummy), but I think it's because he got off to a good start and was beating me. I came back and won the game and then his attitude came back. We listened to tapes awhile and he traded his Hangman game to me (he said it was too hard for him) for 4 cassette tapes, which he picked out (Twisted Sister, Van Halen, Nirvana, and Great White).   Almost as soon as we finished trading, his Mom arrived with his brother. It wasn't long before he smarted off to my Mom (he called her a "moron"), in front of my sister, and she bawled him out, left him crying in the kitchen. He never learns.   Before they got here, I made a plane for Austin, Jesse's brother, and Jess and I drew designs and stuff on it. As they were all leaving, sometime around 5pm, the boys took the planes outside and played for a little. Jess still had a bad attitude on him, complaining about his plane. Heck, he didn't say goodbye to me or my Mom until my Mom said something to him about it, and by then, it meant nothing. I don't know what his problem was, but it was a pretty rude way to end his stay here. The skies started getting dark and the wind picked up, so they took off for home.  Mom and I went in and watched TV while it stormed outside.   On a positive note, I paid for all of my outstanding auction wins this weekend, but I still need about $80 in my checking account (ASAP) and I owe Mom $40. I should be getting a lot of payments in tomorrow. I'd better.   I'm beat. I need to take a shower and go to bed.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  My ears have been sore all week, so I haven't been listening to much music, but I did listen to the Pink Floyd tape I got at the flea market last weekend, "A Momentary Lapse Of Reason", which is incredible.     Watching on TV:  NBA Season has started, so I'm watching a lot of basketball. I watched the Magic play the Knicks last night (the Magic came back and won in OT) and I watched the Cavaliers/Kings game as well, in which Lebron James made his NBA debut (he looked very good, very well-rounded). I'm planning on watching the Magic/Hornets game that comes on in an hour or so. It's the first meet-up between Darrell Armstrong and the Magic, his former team. Darrell had always been my favorite Magic player and I was very disappointed that they let him go.    Other than basketball, I've been watching a lot of "The Simpsons" this week. They've been playing double doses of the Simpsons' Halloween specials all week long. I'm still getting my daily double dose of "Everybody Loves Raymond" as well. I've been watching "Columbo", "Trading Spaces", CNN, and "Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn". That's about it.    Downloading:  Nothing.    Reading:  I finished "Carrie" a few days ago (great book), but haven't started anything new yet.    Jamming:  We were supposed to practice tonight but Jimmy, the drummer, cancelled. He had a death in his wife's family. I'm not too disappointed about not playing tonight. In fact, I was thinking about cancelling all day today myself. My ears are really sore and I have a constant headache. I was going to make it to practice regardless. I am disappointed that Jimmy can't play next week either. He has something going on at work. This is not good. By the time we get together again, three and a half weeks will have passed without a practice. That's no way to get tight as a band. In the meantime, we just have to make sure we practice at home, and JP and I are going to try to get together next week and get a demo CD put together (for club owners/bookers).   Working:  I was going to do some looking today, but that didn't happen. I'm feeling under the weather.     Buying:  I treated Mom to a birthday lunch today, Dino's pizza and wings (which I really couldn't afford). I am flat-broke and in debt, so I'm not buying much of anything right now.     Selling:  Sold a few cards on eBay this week, but it's still really slow going. I'm only making half of what I'd normally make. I need to move those cassette tapes I bought (the ones I didn't keep for myself). I've got over 600 of them just sitting here taking up space.    Eating:  Pizza and wings today. I'm still eating too much bread and cheese in my diet. I've been eating a lot of sandwiches, too many sandwiches really (turkey and cheese, peanut butter and orange marmalade, cheese). I have been eating pork loin and white rice more often, which is better for me. I need to eat more veggies too. The only veggies I've eaten lately are tomatoes and lettuce... in my turkey sandwiches. I have been drinking OJ every morning, so that's good, and I've started using decaffeinated tea bags in the evening. I'm trying to change what I eat, but when I don't do the shopping or the cooking, it's hard to maintain a proper diet.      Feeling:  Mentally: Frustrated. I need money. A lot of it.    Physically: Blah. My ears hurt, my head hurts, and my neck hurts.    Planning:  To have a better life... someday.

        Feeling Blah   Ugh! I feel like crap today. I went to bed at an acceptable time last night (1am, I was up talking to Mom), but it took me forever to fall asleep. I got up at 9:30am, not having slept very much, and felt ok for awhile, but then I gradually started wearing down and feeling crappy.   I went to take a nap around 1pm, stayed in bed until 3pm, but I had the same problem as I did last night in taking a long time to fall asleep. I think I may have napped for half an hour. It was really comfortable in bed, so I should have fallen asleep quickly, but I didn't. I don't know why I can't just fall asleep when I'm tired, like a normal human being.   I wanted to run out to the post office to do my mailings after I got up from my nap (I got everything packaged this morning) but Mom is still in her nightgown and I'm feeling like crap so we put it off until tomorrow (her birthday).   She's looking to buy a new car, her bank approved her for a loan, so we may do some car shopping tomorrow as well. A nice little birthday present for herself.   Of course, I'm broke and have nothing to give her for her birthday, and nothing for (my nephew) Austin's the following day either. I feel terrible about that. I hate not having money. I  really  need a job.   I was going to go put an application in at Arbys today, but I haven't gone (for the same reasons I haven't gone to the post office). I'm also really hesitant about taking another fast food job just because it's what's available. I want a good job, with benefits and insurance, but if I keep taking fast food jobs, I may never get a good job again because prospective employer's will look at my resume and see nothing worthwhile there. Another problem is that, once I get into a new job and start working day shift, when would I apply for this new job? When would I interview? If I already have my days booked with the fast food job, I really won't be able to apply at another 9-5 type job unless I take time off from my fast food job to do it (which is a good way to lose the fast food job).   I'm hoping to hit that production place tomorrow (if I can figure out where it is). If not, I will wait until the ads come out on Sunday and see if they're hiring. I looked up a couple places on the internet to see what jobs they have available, but have had no luck finding anything yet. I am going to look for better jobs the rest of the week and if I find nothing in Sunday's want ads, I'll relent and go to Arby's.   *sigh*  Of course, being a fat guy, there's no guarantee I'll get hired there either.   Looking for a job really sucks ass.

        JP's Visit   He didn't stay very long, but we got a lot done. We went over a bunch of songs mostly making sure we in agreement with the arrangements and changes we've made to certain songs over the past few months. He was fine with the changes I made to the arrangement of his song "Yesterday's Girl" and he also liked the riff and the solo I added to his "There For Me" as well. This Thursday we're working on our third setlist, which contains a bunch of songs we haven't played in a long time, so it was good that he came by like he did. He said he's going to try and come over a little early on Thursday too.   He told me that Jimmy got his electric drum kit for home! This is very welcome news. Hopefully he'll refresh his playing skills and get back to his previous level of play.    Before JP left he played a little bit of a new CD he bought, The Peter Malick Group featuring Norah Jones, which sounded very good. he asked me if I knew about the "Martin Scorsese Presents The Blues" series, and I whipped out the Jimi Hendrix CD I have from that series and played him a couple tracks. He was pretty impressed. I don't think he's ever heard Jimi play with an organist or sax player before.    Afetr he split, I got online and saw that I received a new Paypal payment so I sent eBay some money and listed and re-listed a bunch of auctions tonight. Hopefully I will make  some  money with them.   I guess I'd better get to bed; I want to get up in the morning and get my mailings done and get looking for a job.

        Monday/Tuesday   Over the weekend I gradually started going to bed later and getting up later, not good. I also started reading Stephen King's "Carrie" over the weekend and I stayed up late last night finishing it up (it's a  very  hard book to put down). It was almost 3am when I finished, and it was much later than that when I actually fell asleep. I got up at Noon. Hopefully, I'll get back to "normal" again tonight (bed at Midnight, wake up at 9am).   Besides reading, I've been going through my cards pulling them for a small side deal and pulling some to sell on eBay. It took a lot of time, and I'm not sure it's even worth it for what I might get for them.   Mom is off from work the rest of the week and she's going to take me to a couple places tomorrow to try and get a job.  I need one badly.  I practiced guitar today for about an hour. My ears are still a little sore, but not as bad as last week. I hope they'll ok by Thursday night's band practice.   JP called me a few minutes ago, he's got some time to kill and wanted to come over for a bit. That's cool, i wanted to call him and go over a few songs with him anyway. I guess I'd better go and do a "quick clean" of the house, it's a bit of a shithole at the moment.

         urlLink Monday Mission     1. Have you ever had your work (online or off) used without your permission? What was used and how did you resolve it?   Not really, no. One of the guys I play in a band with played me a song he wrote that had a section that sounded a lot like an old song of my own that he'd heard long ago, but that's common with music. You can take someone else's idea and change it enough to make it something new.    2. Have you ever copied somebody else's work into your own without requesting permission? Did you feel OK about that? How did things turn out?   Like I was saying above, sometimes I'll come up with a new riff or something that might sound familiar and if I figure out what it is, I'll either change it enough to make it my own or I'll abandon it altogether. Plagiarism is not good.     3. Are there any similarities or differences (in general) to someone using my work without permission or compensation and downloading and sharing music without doing the same? Can you justify one and not the other?   I think they're very different. Passing off your work as my own is blatant plagiarism, it is definitely theft, but with downloading music, what's being stolen?   If I download a song, I'll listen to it, just like I can do on the radio, sampling it, just like I can do at many CD shops. If I like It, I'll buy it, so where's the theft? You might say downloading is different because I can possess the track in my home and can make copies, but am I stealing the song if I go to the library, borrow the CD and play it on my PC (where I can easily burn a copy)? I didn't buy anything, the artist isn't making a cent on my checking it out, so is that stealing too? To me, it isn't stealing until you burn it to disc, which is a way to own the complete product without having to pay for it. The only reason it's even an issue is because the RIAA is a corrupt, greedy organization that doesn't want to adapt to the changing technology.    4. Do you have "Daylight Savings Time" where you live? Do you like it? Does your body adjust well to it?   Yes, we have it. I hate losing an hour, I love gaining an hour. I'm a mess anyway, so it doesn't affect me much.   5. Do you shave? When did you start? Do you use a blade or an electric? What do you shave (face, chin, legs, ears, etc)? Do you shave in the shower/bath or at the sink?    I hate shaving! I shave only when I have to (my face). I think I started around 16-17? No idea. Don't really care. I don't think I've ever shaved more than 3 times a week, ever. When I do, I shave at the sink.    6. What do you think about the religious groups that get so upset when everyone celebrates Halloween?   I could care less about what any religious group has to say. Religions are archaic and outdated, totally uneccessary in this day and age.    7. Are you dressing up for Halloween? If so, as what? And If you do, email me a photo and I will create a Gallery with everyone who sends one.   Nah, I'm way too old for that. Though, I did trick-or-treat one house last year just to amuse my nephews.   BONUS:How can I explain when there are few words I can choose?   Learn more words.

         urlLink Monday Madness     1. Do you watch any 'reality shows' on television? If so, which is your favorite? If not, why?    I'm not sure whether "Fear Factor" or "Trading Spaces" is considered "reality" television, but that's the closest I get. I'm not a fan of the genre.    2. If you were offered a chance to be a part of any of the reality shows, which one would you choose? Why?   Probably something like "Survivor", where I'd get to be outdoors and test myself. I think I would enjoy the experience regardless if I won or lost.    3. If you could pick your own team on 'Survivor' what qualities would you look for in the 7 people you would choose?   I'd probably want to be surrounded by people like myself, folks who would enjoy every part of the experience regardless of winning or losing. Positivity is a definite plus.

        Sleepiness & Gen X Anger   I went to bed too late last night and it took a long time for me to fall asleep, although I'm not really sure if I slept last night at all. I was laying there in the dark trying to sleep, but mostly thinking about stuff and before I knew it, the sun is shining into my room. I know I was awake before my alarm went off at 9:30am.   I tried to take a nap on the couch this afternoon, but the sun kept shining in my eyes and then Mom came home and I had to bring the groceries in. I eventually went to my bed around 2pm and napped until about 3:30pm, though I stayed in bed until 4pm.   I got up to start working on my auction stuff tonight, but I discovered that eBay deducted $10 from my account this weekend, $10 that I had not expected to be taken out for another week or so, and $10 which I had planned to use to list auctions with tonight. I can't list tonight now, which is very, very bad. I'm flat broke and I have bills due and money owe to people and have birthdays this week; I need the income badly. My Mom is taking Wednesday, Thursday and Friday off this week, my sister took the whole week off, but if they want to get together and do something, I can't join them because I'm broke.   And the icing on the cake: I think I may have to settle for another shitty job again. I was hoping to find a good job, full-time with benefits, but the way things are going, I may have to take what I can get, while I can get it. Mom said Arby's is hiring.   Goddamn it.   You know, some folks say "Generation X" is an overgeneralization, an oversimplification, but it seems pretty clear-cut to me. My generation has been sytematically screwed and I, for one, am feeling it and have felt it all my grown life. And let me tell you: it's not a pleasant screw, but a massive anal rape.   Thank you, Baby Boomers. Thank you, Reganomics. Together you helped to produce a generation of educated, but poorly employed fast-food workers and slackers. It would have been nice if you'd had the same dream your parents had, and their parents before them, and their parents before them, and on and on and on: to make sure your children had a better life than you did. But that wasn't  your  dream, was it? Your dream was to have your cake and eat it too. You got it all and you kept it all, making sure very little "trickled down" to the next generation, my generation. Thanks for that. Thank you and fuck you.

        A Fun Saturday   I was out of bed at 10am this morning after lying in bed for half an hour listening to Pink Floyd, and then the Rolling Stones, play on my radio/alarm clock. I got up, finished last night's pizza, got my mailing ready, got dressed and headed out to the flea market with Mom.   I wanted to see what business was like over at the 49'er Flea Market since the weather has cooled. It still wasn't very good. Less than half the booths were filled and by Noon, many of the folks who did have booths, cleared out. Sunday is supposed to be much, much better. While I was there, I picked up four paperback books (Stephen King's "Carrie" & "The Green Mile", Bram Stoker's original "Dracula", and Thomas Harris' "Red Dragon", the first of the Hannibal Lechter books). I also bought two cassette tapes, Stone Temple Pilots "Purple" & Pink Floyd "A Momentary Lapse Of Reason". Everything I got was $0.50 each... sweet!  After that, we ran some errands (Post Office, Home Depot) and decided to head up to my sister's house.   We stopped at a few yard sales along the way (one of the benefits of being up early). I bought Jesse a Hardy Boys book for $0.10 at one of them, and at the last one we hit, Mom bought herself a computer. It's an e-Machine, the kind with a separate tower (CD-Rom, floppy) and monitor, Windows 98 software, and has 2 hard drives. It was in really nice shape and the guy even had the original boxes, paperwork, and software for it. He also threw in an Epson printer, a power strip, and a mouse pad. The total price for everything: $125. The guy had it hooked up in his garage for the yard sale and it looked like it worked just fine. I think she got a really good deal.   After I got to my sister's house, my Mom and niece ran out to Philly's and brought us all steak subs for lunch. They were pretty good, but the gravy fries I ordered (to share with everyone) weren't very good (the gravy was fine, but the fries were awful). My sister wasn't feeling well, she was in bed most of the day, so I kept the boys occupied while my Mom helped my niece, Dana, with her school project.   Besides my two nephews, Austin and Jesse, I also had Jesse's friend, Zack. We played catch with the football for awhile, which turned into keep away, which turned into ball tag (like regular tag, except you use the ball to tag the person "it"). Jess and Zack went off together and my other nephew, Austin, and I played catch for awhile. We were getting bored of throwing the ball around, so I started acting goofy, throwing the ball like a girl and blowing him kisses.   And thus, "Gay Football" was born.    When Jess and Zack came back we were all playing Gay Football. I'd throw the ball with one hand and have the other one hanging limp while the boys would skip down the street to catch the ball (yes, I said "skip"). Austin would throw me the ball and blink his eyelashes at me, and when someone would make a good throw or catch, we'd say it was "fabulous".   I kid you not!  Gay Football eventually morphed into Retard Football and Jess and Zack had me laughing my ass off. They both wear baggy shorts and they pulled them up to their chests. looking like total nerds. Zack started walking like Jerry Lewis and Jess pulled his shirt over his head, along the the shorts up to his chest, and started doing Cornholio. It was hilarious. Austin was trying to think of something funny too, but being a 5 year old (six next week), all he came up with was to pull his shorts down to his ankles, standing in the middle of the road in his underwear. I don't know about that kid...  Jess and Zack split again and Austin and I played ball tag a little. It was hot outside so I turned the hose on and soaked him. I hosed my head and chest too. Man, the cool water felt good. I would have loved to have been able to jump in a swimming pool right then, but they don't have one.    The boys came back and we played catch for awhile more before they all had to go in and get ready to go out (the boys went out bowling tonight). After they left, I wound up spending the next several hours working on my niece's computer and watching "Jackass" with my Mom and sister while I was downloading various good stuff for her PC. She has dial-up, so it took a long, long time to do what I wanted done. Firstly, I deleted a bunch of Gator and other garbage from her system before I was able to find a workable version of Ad-Aware to clear the rest off. I downloaded that and I downloaded almost every update Windows Update had. I also upgraded her Kazaalite to the ++ version and installed a Lava Lamp screensaver for her. I did a few other things as well, there's more I probably could have done, but by the time I finished all of that, it was about 11:30pm and Mom was well ready to go home.    I'll tell ya, I'm a bit disappointed; all of that work and I didn't even get a "thank you" for it.  Kids these days...   Before Mom and I got home, we stopped off at McDonalds and I bought a McRib and some Chicken McNuggets. I got so wrapped up with the computer, I never had dinner.   I'm not hungry anymore, but I am flat-broke again.   I guess I'd better get to bed. Even with the extra hour tonight, it's way past my bedtime.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  I've been working in my room all night, pulling cards to sell, and I listened to a bunch of stuff while I was in there: tapes of Black Sabbath ("the Collection"), Joan Jett ("I Love Rock & Roll"), Hole ("Pretty On The Inside"), and Dio ("Sacred Heart"), and CDs of Dave Attell ("Skanks For The Memories"), Bill Cosby ("Collection"), Jimi Hendrix ("First Rays Of The New Rising Sun" bootleg), and Dokken ("The Very Best Of Dokken"). I also played Tom Petty's "Southern Accents" tape about 5 times last night (it was on auto-repeat and I was too busy/lazy to switch it).    Watching on TV:  I've been up a little earlier this week, so I got to watch "The Ellen Degeneres Show" a couple of times this week (I've been a fan of hers for ages)! I also caught about half of Sharon Osbourne's show today (only because Jack Black was on) and half of "People's Court". I used to love the old "People's Court" and the concept behind it, but I really don't enjoy the smug, sarcastic judge they have now (little Miss Attitude). Is there a rule that says all courtroom shows have to have a wiseass judge? On the whole, daytime television is pretty crappy, with the exception of Ellen's show and my "Columbo" reruns.   My evening TV routine is the same: "The Simpsons", back-to-back "Everybody Loves Raymond", and "Seinfeld". I usually shut the TV off during "primetime" and turn it back on for "The Daily Show" and "Tough Crowd" with Colin Quinn".   I caught one pre-season basketball game this week (Magic vs. Hawks), but I missed one the other one (Lakers vs. Clippers)... d'oh! The regular season starts next week!   Downloading:  Sadly, Elliot Smith commited suicide this week, so I downloaded a bunch of his music. He's someone I enjoyed when I saw him play on Saturday Night Live, but never heard anything else from him, so I kind of forgot about him. He made some reallly good music though.    Reading:  I have Stephen King's "Cujo" pulled out to read next (I finisahed the Foxworthy book and abandoned "Moby Dick"), but I'm not sure if I'm going to read that one next or King's "It". Since Halloween is next week, I wanted to read a King book next.    Jamming:  We jammed on Monday, a greeat practice, and we play together again next Thursday. I've practiced at home for the last two days, but didn't play today (I hurt my ears yesterday blasting my stereo). JP is supposed to be taking vocal classes again this week.   Working:  Not yet, hope to go looking for a job next week.    Buying:  I bid on and won two Hendrix CDs (see 6 posts below) on eBay, but I have't paid for them yet. Hopefully, if I get some fast paying bidders of my own, I can pay for them on Monday.    Selling:  I've been working on a side deal, pulling cards for someone's want list and I have a bunch of stuff running, though they don't seem to be doing too well.      Eating:  I don't usually eat breakfast. I've been eating egg salad sandwiches and turkey sandwiches for lunches, but I had a gross-ass sloppy joe today. It sucked. For dinners, I've been eating BBQ chicken and rice, last nigfht I had a Burger King Chicken Caesar sandwich, chili, and a baked potato from Arby's. Tonight we had Dino's pizza (Mom's idea, not mine). I cut down drinking tea (due to my sleep problems) and have been drinking more milk, water, and gatorade. I had some Pepsi tonight.    Feeling:  Mentally: Frustrated still. I'm trying to change my life but it's rough going. My sleep problems are killing me, but like I said, I'm trying to change.   Physically: I'm getting sharp pains in my ears and my back is sore now (from working with the cards and lifting the heavy boxes they're in). I keep feeling hot too. I'm also very tired.    Planning:  Change!

        Humankind At It's Finest   Folks, this is special:    What's in a name? Everything when it's Butt    LONDON (Reuters) - A couple have been forced to move house because of the shame caused by the name of their street -- Butt Hole Road .    Paul and Lisa Allott sold their 150,000 pound bungalow in Conisbrough, northern England after living there for just 15 months, fed up with the constant leg-pulling.   Taxis and pizza delivery men would fail to turn up, thinking their order was just a prank, and they grew tired with groups of youths posing for photos by the nearby street sign with their buttocks bared.   "I like a laugh, but it was beyond a joke," Allott told the Sun newspaper on Friday.   Attempts by Reuters to contact the new residents were unsuccessful -- they have taken a confidential ex-directory telephone number.     "Butt Hole Road"! Haaaaahaaaahaaaaa!! I absolutely love ridiculously stupid stuff like that!   And yes, I would move there if I could.

        A Shaky Start   Ugh! Well I'm up early again, but I feel like crap. I woke up around 8:30am this morning and got out of bed around 9am. I went to bed at Midnight again, but unfortunately, it took me several hours before I fell asleep. I've only had about 3-4 hours of sleep.  I've been following my checklist too: in bed at Midnight, up at 9am, no caffeine (soda or tea) after 2pm, and no food or drink after 9pm. I took a shower about an hour before bedtime, and after that I chilled out and watched TV for an hour before I went to bed. All of which was suggested by several websites for a better night's sleep.   So... why isn't it working for me thus far?  I swear, everything has to be a struggle for me... always.

        A New Start?   I am up before Noon! Actually, I've been out of bed since 9:20am, but I easily could've slept a few more hours. I'm pretty tired still, plus I have a sinus headache (had it all night last night) that I can't shake (my sinuses have been really bad lately).   I went to bed at Midnight last night, after "Tough Crowd", but it took me a long time to fall asleep (nothing new about that), even though I was completely beat when I went to bed. I know I was still awake at 2:30am.   Hopefully, this will be the start of my return to normalcy and a job will be soon to follow.

        Play Ball!   Woo hoo! The first televised Orlando Magic game of the season is about to start! It's just a pre-season game, but I'll take it anyway! The regular season starts next week. I watched a pre-season Lakers/Cavaliers game last week. I'm not much of a sports fan, but I love basketball.   So you know what I'll be doing for the next couple of hours :)  By the way, I only managed to stay up until about 1:30pm today. I slept until about 6pm. I'm really feeling beat, so I'm hoping to have an easier time getting to sleep tonight.  Now, on to the Magic!

        Wednesday's Dose Of Insanity    I managed to follow through with some of the things on my new sleep plan (see 3 posts below): I didn't drink tea or soda after 5pm (well ok, I had a few sips of tea, but it wasn't even 1/8 of a glass) and I didn't eat or drink anything after 8pm. But so far... no good.   I went to bed around 3:30am and was back out of bed by 6:45am, not having slept at all. In fact, I played guitar in bed for about an hour before I finally just got up.   (Note to self: maybe having the guitar next to the bed isn't such a good idea)   After I got up again, I didn't feel very tired at all, though, strangely enough, I was dead tired when I laid down at 3:30am.  I guess I'm staying up all day again. Dammit.   To keep myself occupied, I half-watched a few astronomy documentaries, one about the VLT (the Very Large Telescope) and one about the Big Bang, but mostly I watched Jimmy, one of my cats, going crazy at the window. He kept seeing birds outside and he would follow them around with his eyes and his head, he'd paw at the window occasionally, and he would move his mouth in a very weird way when he saw them, meowing, though it  looked more like he was trying to talk.   That cat is a bit of nutjob anyway.  I don't remember if I wrote about it yet or not (my memory is shot) but Jimmy has an obsession with these two "strings" I gave him to play with. Actually one "string" is a neon green shoelace and the other is a strip from my old floormat. He always tries to lead me over to them when I talk to him, so I'll pick them up and play with him (he chases them around when I drag them, goes in circles and gets dizzy, swats at them, carries them around in his mouth). He does a couple of new things with them now though. I started hanging them up on the front door, the bottom of the "strings" dangling about 5 1/2 feet off the ground, and he jumps straight up and pulls them down. The weird thing is, it's like he  has to , like it bugs him if they're up there. But the even weirder thing is, it seems like he wants me to hang them up there. Sometimes, I'll wrap the shoelace around the doorknob and he'll unwind it and pull it off. Yesterday, I tried something new with him; I took the "strings" and stuck them inside of the cat carrier and closed the door (just closed, not locked). He immediately went to opening it and pulled them both back out.   He's a smart cat, but he may be a little nuts (sound familiar?).  Anyhoo... I started thinking that I may not be able to stay awake all day and I might miss the call from the Gateway tech guy (who's supposed to help me put in my new motherboard), and I really needed it done by tonight, so I got off the couch and gave it a go all by myself.   Turns out it was really simple and took no time at all. In fact, it took more time unhooking everything and hooking it all back up than it did to uninstall the old motherboard and put in the new one.   It's up and running again and hopefully it will remain that way.   I tried installing Windows XP one more time too. I figured, now that I have the new motherboard in, with no blown capacitors, it might work, but alas, no such luck.  After trying it, I spent the next half hour or so on the phone with Gateway trying to get a return label so I can send it back. That's all taken care of now. No XP for me, but on the positive side, that's about $220 that will come off of my Gateway tab.    Man, I'm tired. I'm really starting to feel it now.   I'm hungry too. I haven't eaten since 8pm last night. Well, that's not entirely true. I finished off the marshmellow peeps that Mom bought me the other day. Real healthy. What can I say? I'm a nimrod.   I'm really not looking forward to being up all day.

        Stop Me Now, Before I Bid Again!   A broke-ass guy, with no job and absolutely no self-control, just shouldn't have access to eBay. I barely squeezed by paying my Gateway bill this month, I have my student loan bill due next week, my nephew Austin's birthday next week, and my Mom's birthday next week. I will need $9-12 for next Thursday's band practice (I don't know whether we're booked for 3 or 4 hours), and I need money in my eBay seller account so I can list more auctions next week. On top of all of that, I owe several people money (Mom, JP, Paul K., my sister). In short, I most definitely should not be buying stuff for myself.   But I just couldn't resist.  I bid on and won 2 auctions tonight. I won two Jimi Hendrix limited edition, Japanese Mini-LP CD's (deluxe packaging that mimics the original LP's) for about what *one* of them usually sells for. I got them both, "Axis:Bold As Love" and "Electric Ladyland", for a total of $31.36 (that includes insured Priority shipping). The last "Axis:Bold As Love" Mini-LP sold on eBay for $27.99 (not including shipping) and I haven't seen any "Electric Ladyland" Mini-LP CDs on eBay for weeks (which indicates how rare it is), but it would go for about the same amount, if not more. So... I got myself a  great  deal, but it just is not a good time for me to be spending money on myself.  I need a job, now, more than ever.      Tuesday Blues, Pt.2    Just to follow up...  I called JP and talked to him about the changes I made to his song and he seemed fine with what I did. I emailed him the new arrangement.   The Gateway tech guy never called. I left a message, and it was early enough in his shift, so he should've gotten back to me. Hopefully, he'll call me tomorrow. I really don't want to do it with a different tech guy since this one seemed to be one of the better tech people at Gateway.

        Tuesday Blues (Not So Bad)   I played some guitar earlier today, working on solos for a few songs (originals and covers). I think I may need to make an alteration to one of JP's songs. Not sure how he'll be with it, although I think this just changes it back to how he originally wrote it (we made a few changes over time). I need to call him and go over it with him.   Right now, I'm waiting on a phonecall from a Gateway tech support guy (Ron). My new motherboard came in the other day and he said he'd help me install it. I really hope this will correct the problems I'm having with my PC. It's almost 9pm though, I wonder if he's going to call me back tonight. I really need to get it done either tonight or tomorrow night.   We shall see...

        Sleep Change   Once again, I didn't get out of bed until 3:15pm. I went to bed around 4am, read for awhile, but then, after I'd shut out the lights and gotten ready to sleep, I had to get up due to a painful stomach ache. I spent about an hour in the bathroom before I finally got back to bed and finally got sleeping, sometime around 6am, I believe.   I had taken sleeping pills again last night, but yet again, they did nothing for me.   I think I'm giving up on pills; they just never work for me. I'm going to try something different now: changing my routines. For now on, no more caffeinated beverages after 3pm and no eating or drinking after 8pm. I'm also going to start taking a walk in the early evening and I'll start taking showers about an hour or so before bedtime. I'm going to go to bed at Midnight everynight (with the possible exception of Saturday), and I'm going to get up at 9am everyday. I'm also going to make sure my room is kept very cool, Mom be damned (she likes to turn the A/C off).   It's going to take me some time to adjust to all of these changes, and it'll probably take me some time to start doing all of it, but I think if I can do these things, I'll be able to begin sleeping well at night again and wake up feeling refreshed, which I never ever do.

        Monday Night Band Practice   Very good practice tonight. Very loose, very productive. We started off by jamming on U2's "One" (JP threw it out there) and then we ran through setlist #1, all the way through with no stopping. We timed it and it was about 50 minutes long. The guys took a break (I stayed and played guitar by myself) and then we did the same with setlist #2, though we did stop at one point when JP became confused by what I was playing on "Feelin' Alright". It was also about 50 minutes long. After we finished that set, the guys took another break and I stayed and played some more. After they came back, we ran over some of the songs from both sets that needed some work. We weren't entirely tight and the drumming was a bit unsteady, we all goofed up here and there, but we sounded pretty good overall. Very encouraging practice.    Next week, we go back to practicing on Thursday again.

        Monday, So Far   Another crappy night's sleep to start my day on. Got up at 3:30pm again, but barely slept at all. I did manage to get some sleep in, but I have no idea how much. I'm dragging. I think I'll try those sleeping pills again tonight. I haven't taken them for awhile now (because they didn't seem to work), but maybe I'll give them another shot. I have to do something, because I can't continue on like this. It's agonizing. At one point I was so dead tired and so frustrated that I couldn't get to sleep that I wished for my own death. It would have been a welcome relief.    How's that for Monday blues?

         urlLink Monday Madness     1. Which room in your home is your favorite? Why?    Probably the living room/dining room. Because there's a TV and a computer, couches, chairs, a table, and it's right near the fridge.    2. Which room would you most like to remodel or change the look of? Why?   Man.. the whole place. Probably the kitchen most of all. My brother-in-law and his friend installed a linoleum floor for my Mom and they screwed it all up. The floor is lumpy (too much glue under the linoleum), it's torn up in spots (from dragging the fridge over it), it's spliced together with duct tape near the washer/dryer, and near the back door, the linolem has been pulled up from the floor altogether. Also, the wallpaper over the sink is warping, the counters are notched, and split... very ugly room.     3. Which room do you hate cleaning the most?    My own. There's never enough space for my stuff and I usually give up, leaving something undone.

         urlLink Monday Mission      1. What is the most expensive car repair you'd have to pay for?   Sorry, I have no car.   2. What is the longest time you've ever spent riding/driving in a car?   When I was a kid, my family drove from here (Florida) back home to Pennsylvania. I remember very little about that trip except for stopping somewhere in the Carolina's for pancakes, reading a Flash comic book, and getting a pack or two of baseball cards along the way.   As an adult, my friend Ed and I drove to the Georgia border and back one night on a whim. I was depressed that we didn't cross the line (Ed decided to turn back). If it were me, I would have kept on going.     3. Fall seems to be a pretty busy time of year: football, school starting, Halloween, thanksgiving, traveling, family functions. Are the next few weeks going to be busy for you? What do you have going on?   Not much, really. There are two birthdays coming up, but we celebrate them both on Halloween, so for me, it's more like one busy day than a busy couple of weeks.     4. Changing seasons usually also means changing clothing. Do you have a routine to switch clothing around in your closet or dressers? Do you look forward to the chance to wear some different clothes for a change?   Nah... I wear the same stuff all year long (I do live in Florida). The only difference is that I might wear long sleeved shirts more and throw on a jacket occasionally.    5. Have you ever been to pick apples or visit a farm in the fall? Is that something you (would) enjoy?   No, never done that. I think I would enjoy being out in the country during Fall, absolutely. The apple picking... I don't know that I'd enjoy that.    6. Are there any tastes or smells that once you've taken them in, you just know fall is really here?   Turkey dinners, stuffing, pumpkin pies, apple pies... mmmmmm.   7. Isn't there something you've been meaning to do for a while? You know, that thing? Yeah. So, what's the holdup?   You mean get a life? Yeah, I've been meaning to do that. I've just been to busy fucking up.      BONUS: Why are there so many songs about rainbows?   It's all part of the massive Gay Conspiracy.

        Sucky Sunday   Saturday really sucked, but unfortunately for me, the suckiness carried into Sunday as well. I was in bed by 4am Sunday morning, but by 10:30am, I still hadn't slept at all. I stayed in bed until 3:30pm, until I couldn't stand it any longer. I don't think I slept more than an hour or so.   I tossed and turned pretty much the whole time, played guitar awhile too, trying to tire myself out, but I wound up working on an old tune of mine. I just could not get comfortable. On top of that, I started thinking of stupid stuff (like winning the lottery) and my mind took off with it, figuring out what I'd do, how I'd do it... stupid stuff. I guess you could say I was daydreaming, because I certainly wasn't dreaming for real. I wasn't asleep, I was well aware of that.   I don't get it though. I mean, at some point, isn't the concious mind supposed to shut down and let the unconscious mind take over? I used to be normal in that way, but I'm not anymore. My mind just isn't working right.   Oh yeah, before I went to bed last night, I went over JP's setlists (he sent everyone in the band new setlists) and I made a bunch of changes to them, trying to get a better flow, and I emailed them out to the guys. It turns out JP and Al liked what I'd done (no word from Jimmy), so we'll be using them tomorrow. Al made a good change on the setlist as well. We're starting to communicate a lot better, so that's good. We jam tomorrow (later tonight, actually).  I spent the rest of the day pulling cards, installing stuff back onto my PC, scanning cards, listing cards for sale, and then sending out winner's notices.   My Mom was killing me all day with that stupid Ice Skating crap on TV all afternoon. Ugh! I hate the music, I hate the performances, I hate the commentators, I just hate everything about it.   And "sport" my ass.    Luckily she went back to her room while I was listing. I turned everything off and focused on listing my cards. I do my listings better in silence, with no distractions.   It's nearly 1am now. There's a couple of movies coming on that I want to see ("Dead Man" and "Road To Perdition"), but I think I might just go on to bed instead.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  Not much lately, been in bed too much. I had AC/DC's "Fly On The Wall" tape on the other day though, it's better than I remembered it to be. I've mostly been listening to JP's recordings of our band practices.   Watching on TV:  "The Simpsons", "Everybody Loves Raymond", "Seinfeld", NBA Basketball (pre-season started!), "The Ellen Degeneres Show" (when I was actually up early enough to catch it), and various stand-up comedy specials on HBO Comedy and Comedy Central. I've been sleeping too much this week and haven't watched a lot of TV.   Downloading:  I wound up wiping my hard drive for a second time in a week (trying to load XP), so I haven't been downloading anything, just re0installing my programs and links.    Reading:  Still reading Jeff Foxworthy's book "No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem!". I'm really not into it much. He talks too much about his sex life, like I care about Jeff Foxworthy's sex life.    Jamming:  We jammed on Thursday and will jam again on Monday. JP sent the new setlists he came up with but I'm not happy with their flow, so I'm working on revising them.     Working:  No.   Buying:  Nothing.   Selling:  The cards I put up last week aren't doing much. I'll have to put up a wider selection this week.    Eating:  I had Chicken Cordon Bleu with ramen noodles and raw broccoli on the side (with Russian dressing to dip in) twice, we had Sonny's shredded pork dinners tonight (baked potato, garlic toast, baked beans, and coleslaw), I had pork loin for dinner one night (cold, with nothing else). I had sandwiches (roast beef and cheddar or lebanon baloney and white american cheese), I've had eggs, kielbasa, toast and hash browns, baked mashed potatoes (broccoli and cheese), and bagels (with sour cream and jam). I've been drinking a lot of hot tea, root beer, and Pepsi. I've had more water lately, which is good, but I need to keep the sodas strictly to the weekends, if at all. I've been eating too much bread (sandwiches, bagels, toast) and too much potato-food (baked, mashed, and hash-browned).   Feeling:  Mentally: Still quite pissed at myself for not getting my shit together. I'm not getting anywhere and I'm not happy about it, but it's my fault that I'm not getting anywhere. I should prabably start forcing myself to get up early, no matter how little I've slept.   Physically: I have a headache right now, I think it's my ears that are causing it. My sinuses have been bad here lately and I've been blowing my nose and coughing more than usual. Maybe I'm coming down with something. I don't know. All I know is that I do not feel right, not at all.    Planning:  Same stuff every damned week.

        Sucky Saturday   I crashed out on the couch sometime around 4:30am Saturday morning and slept (off and on) until 11:40am. I got up, went to the bathroom and laid down on my bed for a few minutes to pet Stevie, who was in there all by himself. I wound up falling asleep, I kind of figured I would since my couchtime wasn't solid sleeptime, but instead of sleeping for an hour or two, I stayed in bed until 6:45pm. Great. It seems like that's all I've done the past few days. It's awful. I just can't get it together.

         urlLink 3 for Thursday     1. What are your 3 favorite scary/thriller movies? (You know like that great classic thriller Psycho)   For me, the top three are probably "Psycho" (the Hitchcock original), "The Shining" (the Nicholson one), and "Silence Of The Lambs". I've always loved "Dawn Of The Dead" and have enjoyed all of the "Alien" movies too.    2. What are the 3 stupidest scary movies you've ever seen? (So bad they're funny)    I tend to stay away from overtly dumb movies, but when I was a teenager, my sister and I used to go over to my Dad's and watch movies with him and his wife. Usually we just watched movies my Dad taped on the VCR, but one time my stepmother rented a movie for us to watch, "Basket Case", and it was so stupid that we had to shut if off about 20 minutes into it.   I saw a movie called "The Stuff", which was pretty bad. I thought "The Blob" was a pretty dumb idea for a movie too.    3. Who are (in your opinion) the 3 best thriller actors/actresses?   I don't think I can answer this one. There are just too many actors who've done "thrillers", but aren't known as "thriller actors". For instance, Jack Nicholson kicked ass in "The Shining", but I wouldn't call him a "thriller actor". To me, the term "thriller actors" refer to folks like Lon Chaney, Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, Vincent Price, and Robert Englund; folks who made their careers from those types of movies.     Bonus: Has a scary movie ever given you nightmares? If so, which movie was it?   I don't remember any having done that to me, but my sister used to have nightmares about the kid scratching at the window in "Salem's Lot" and I used to tease her about it.

        Band Practice/Meeting   Another very loose practice, but we did go over a lot of the songs we needed to work on and we discussed some things after practice, which is good.   JP recorded us again, but he just let it run for the most part. We worked on a lot of originals and covers, making adjustments here and there, trying things out, or just refreshing our memories. There are some songs we go a month or more without playing at all.   We also goofed off a lot between songs, mostly me and Al, and we jammed on a lot of songs that are not part of our setlists ("Should I Stay Or Should I Go", "Crosstown Traffic", "Red House", "Eighteen"), which is my fault. I love throwing things out there to see how they play.   After practice, we talked a bit about the band, what we're doing, where we're going, what we need to work on, etc... It's always good to discuss that kind of stuff, to make sure we're all on the same page.   Al and I want to practice twice a week. JP and Jimmy just can't do it, so we're going to start having four-hour practices rather than three, to make the most of the one day a week that we get to practice.   We are all in agreement that we need to cut down to two setlists and get them nailed before we start working on set three and four. I told the guys that we all need to practice at home as well. I'm guilty of slacking in that area myself, but Jimmy, the drummer, isn't able to do it at all. He's been talking about buying a practice kit for home, but he hasn't gotten one yet.   His drumming is still a problem. I don't know what happened to him in the time since he left the band and returned, but he's not playing at the same level at all. When I used to watch the band play, back before I joined them, he used to be the strongest part of the band, just a monster on the drums, but right now, he's the weakest link. The other guys have said pretty much the same thing. Hopefully he'll listen to the CDs that JP is making of our practices and hear it himself, and hopefully, he'll get the practice kit so he can play at home and get back up to his previous level of play.   Jimmy talked to one of the clubs they used to play at, about getting us in there, but they have new owners/management and they don't seem interested in paying us what the band made last time they played there. I guess he or JP will negotiate something with them. They're really jonesing to play out, especially JP.   The money thing doesn't really matter too much to me. I'd play just to play, pay or not. The other guys have said that they won't play for free though, unless the free gigs lead up to a better-paying gig. I can see how playing for free could be bad when it comes to negotiating for paying gigs though ("Well you played there for nothing, why should I have to pay you to play here?"). I think I'll just go along with whatever they decide when it comes to money.    We're practing again next Monday, same room.

        One Good Day   Yesterday was a pretty good day for me. I was up early (like I needed to be), I got my laundry done, I got to play with my band, and I was in bed early (like I needed to be). On top of all of that, I was in good spirits and felt good all day long.     Unfortunately, yesterday appears to have been a fluke.   I went to bed last night around 11:15pm, but by 3:30am, I think I slept during that period, but I'm not sure. I  am  sure that I didn't sleep from 3:30am until around 7am. My mind was completely occupied with music. I kept thinking about last night's band practice, about songs that need work, about what I played, the music itself, the melodies, etc... my mind just wouldn't let it go.  Eventually, I picked up the acoustic guitar from the side of my bed and played guitar for an hour or so, trying to get it out of my system, but it didn't help. I did manage to start two new songs though.  Somehow, I was finally able to fall asleep again, around 7am, I believe, but it might have been a little later. I slept until 3:35pm, but I could have stayed in bed even longer.   I can only hope that this isn't going to screw me up when I try to go to bed tonight, but I'm sure it will.    I have got to get a job, that's a  must . But in order to get a job, I have to be getting up in the mornings. I thought I got back on the right track with yesterday's early rising, but now, getting up so late in the day today, I feel like I blew it.   Very disappointing.

        Welcome!   I just noticed that I'm the featured "site of the week" on the " urlLink What's On... Right Now" site ! Welcome to my page! I wish my blog was a bit more upbeat for everyone, but it's been rough going for me here lately and my recent postings have reflected that.   However, on a more positive note, I am up early after having a decent night's sleep, both of which are quite rare for me (getting up early  and  having a good night's sleep). I am in need of a day job, but because I'm a night person by nature, I haven't been able to get up in the morning to go looking for one. It's been a major struggle for me to go from my normal "night-owl" state into a "morning person", I've had to go many days with little to no sleep to pull it off, but it looks like I've finally made the flip! Yay!  I've also been struggling with my PC a lot lately. I have to wipe my hard drive for the umpteenth time this past week. I have Windows Millenium and it is a very unstable OS. I was talked into buying Windows XP when I called for tech support, I tried installing that, but had I had major problems with it. Over $215 and six hours of pure frustration later, I'm back on Millenium again. *Sigh*  I've got band rehearsal tonight at 7pm, so that should help relieve some of the stress I'm feeling. I play guitar in a rock band, Blue Condition, we've been together for several months now, and we're getting ready to start playing out soon.   Anyway, I just wanted to post something more positive here, since I've got new people coming in to my site, I didn't want my previous entry to be the first thing people see! Not a very good first impression!   And now, for something completely different...     urlLink "What's On... Wednesdays"    What's On your bookshelf Right Now? (pick a shelf; any shelf)   Hmmm... I have all of my paperbacks bunched together on the bottom row of my bookshelf, many different genre's, but too many to list. On the shelf above them is my "entertainment section" which includes books by comedians (Groucho Marx, Woody Allen, Jerry Seinfeld, Steve Martin, Chris Rock, Chris Elliot, Howard Stern, and Paul Reiser), and my "classics section" which includes Reader's Digest Classic editions of books by Arthur Conan Doyle, Jules Verne, and others as well as Joseph Heller's "Something Happened". Above that is a mixture of TV books (Honeymooners, Monty Python, Mr.Bean, etc..), humor (Dilbert, "Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy". etc..), "beat writing" (Jack Kerouac, Bob Dylan, etc..), religion (the Bible, Indian Myths and Legends, Nostradamus), science (astronomy), book writing (writer;s market, "how to get published", etcetera. On top of the bookshelf are my dictionary, thesaurus, and other helpful books. I have a Stephen King section up on top of my desk, a whole bunch of King hardcovers, and I have books sitting on my CD shelves (Anne Rice, "The Book Of Dracula", some others) and even books in my bathroom!    I hit Goodwill and the Salvation Army quite frequently and usually pick up a few books every trip. I've got enough reading material to last me for a long, long time.

        GRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   I just got my pc back up and running and online again... finally! Screw Windows XP and screw the Gateway salespeople who said installation would be so damned simple.  It will not work on my machine!  I've spent the entire evening screwing with my PC and/or on the phone with Gateway tech support (twice) and Microsoft tech support.    I don't know what's going on with Gateway, but the last three people I talked to sounded like they were from India and were extremely hard to understand. They didn't seem to understand or pay much attention to what I was saying either, I had to keep repeating myself over and over, which made a very stressful situation even more stressful and aggravating for me. The last lady I talked to did nothing helpful whatsoever, just had me do the things I'd already tried before I called her. She wound up giving me Microsoft's customer support number, which she said was toll-free, but of course, the Microsoft tech guy said no, it wasn't a toll free number. Nice. I spent a goddamned hour on hold with Microsoft and now I'll have to pay for the goddamned call. Thanks Gateway, you bastards.   At this point, I think I'm just going to send XP back. It ain't worth the trouble. The Microsoft guy I spoke with said he struggled with XP on his machine too, but it's working fine now... after he upgraded several components. I can't afford to be buying more stuff just to get the freakin' software working! Fuck that shit! And from what he said, I'll have to try some technical stuff just to get ME (Millenium Edition) upgraded to XP on my machine, so what's the point of me buying the more expensive Full version like I did if I'm only going to be upgrading ME instead of doing a full install? I could've save myself more than a hundred dollars buying the cheaper version!   I've had it. I'm just going to send the shit back. I'll wait and buy a brand new machine somewhere down the road, a Dell preferably, with XP already installed on it or whatever "new and improved" operating system they have out by then. I've had enough of this bullshit.   Fuck Gateway, fuck XP, fuck computers... I'm going to bed.

        Ugh!   A lack of sleep managed to screw me up again. I went to bed at Midnight last night and by 3:30am, I was back out of bed, not having slept a wink. I laid down on the couch sometime around 4:30am, but by 7am, I was still awake. It's a little after 11:30am now, and I still haven't slept. Ugh!  At least I've been productive: I listed about 50 more cards on eBay this morning. I wanted to get them listed before I wipe my hard drive (to install XP). I didn't want to have to re-scan all of the cards again. I was going to install XP today, but I'd better wait until tomorrow to do that. I should do it with a clear, rested mind; I'm pretty much out of right now. So much so, that I had to go back and re-edit almost all of the auctions I listed today, some two or three times. I kept screwing up. There's still about 20 of them that have a misspelled word in them ("togther" instead of "together") and it's bugging me so I'll have to go back in and fix it. Ugh!     I have to get a few packages ready to mail out tomorrow, but I may put them off another day. If I can get to sleep tonight, and I'd better be able to dammit, I'll get up early tomorrow and get them ready to mail. I just don't feel like doing anything right now. Except for sleeping, that is, only now's the time of day I  can't  be sleeping if I'm going to get my shit straightened out.  Ugh!

        Monday   I didn't go to bed at all last night, instead, I stayed up scanning and listing more cards on eBay. I think I listed about 50 more. I quit sometime around 9:30am. I played with the cats a bit, watched TV (Scottie Pippen was on Regis), and did a load of laundry. Eventually, I laid down on the couch with Stevie, sometime around 11:30am, and was in and out of sleep for the next five and a half hours.   It was supposed to rain today, but it got hot and sunny outside instead, which made it quite warm  inside . I was sweating my ass off on that couch! I guess Stevie got hot too, because he finally went and laid down on the dining room floor (where he was cooled off by the ceiling fan). I finally had to get up too, I couldn't take the heat anymore.  After I got up, I talked on the phone with my niece for awhile and sent her some programs and pics. After that, I put on the TV and made a roast beef sandwich for dinner. Now I'm on the PC.   I'm hoping to be in bed by 11pm, Midnight at the latest. I want to be up at 9am. If I can get up at 9am everyday, when the time change comes, it will put me right at 8am, which is exactly when I want to be getting up (so I can get a job). I'm hoping I can get to sleep tonight at a decent time. A lack of sleep is about the only thing that can screw up my plans.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  Not too much here lately. I've been too busy sleeping (or trying to sleep), watching TV, or dealing with PC problems to listen to music.    Watching on TV:  "The Simpsons", "Everybody Loves Raymond", "Seinfeld", Bull Riding, CNN, "The Jeff Corwin Experience", "The Ellen Degeneres Show" (when I can catch it), and I also caught parts of Eddie Izzard's "Dress To Kill" several times last week. I've seen that show many, many times... one of my favorites.    Downloading:  Well, I wiped my whole hard drive last week so I lost everything I had downloaded previously, but I did download a few things this week. I downloaded several versions of Muddy Waters' "Rollin And Tumblin'" and "I Just Wanna Make Love To You", the originals and cover versions. I'm toying with the idea of playing it with the band. I don't know if JP would for either song though. I also downloaded an old song called "Sweat In My Tears" by Martin Briley that I hadn't heard in  ages . I happened to see one of his cassette tapes when I was looking at some eBay auctions and I remembered his name. I love the internet. It's great having a library at your fingertips.    Reading:  I read a little more than 2/3 of "Moby Dick", but I think I'm done with it. I just can't get a handle on the mid-late 1800's sea-faring language and nautical terminology, which sucks because I was really getting into it for awhile. I've been reading Jeff Foxworthy's book "No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem!" instead. That one isn't as good or as funny as I'd hoped it would be.    Jamming:  We jammed on Thursday and we jam again on Wednesday. It was a decent, productive jam (see 4 posts below).     Working:  Not yet. I have to get out of bed in the mornings to get a job.   Buying:  I have no money, so I'm not buying anything right now.    Selling:  Listed some cards tonight. I would like to start doing something with my tapes, but alas, I'd have to get out of bed in the morning to set up at the flea market.    Eating:  Pork loin sandwiches yesterday and today. I tried Liverwurst and it was ok. On Friday we did pizza and wings (from Dino's). Mom bought a bunch of bagels and sandwich food, so I'll be having that stuff for the next few days.    Feeling:  Mentally: Pissed off at myself. Pissed off at life. I just can't get my shit together. I want to be productive, but I'm just not pulling my weight.   Physically: My back is a little sore, and my ass hurts (from sitting in front of the PC so much). Otherwise, I'm ok.     Planning:  I'm planning on getting my life together again someday, and the sooner, the better.

        Sunday   I went to bed around 3am last night and slept until a little after 4pm today. It's taking me  hours  to fall asleep after I've gone to bed anymore. As I've said a hundred times before, I'm a mess.   However, I actually managed to get a few things done today. I hooked up and re-installed my scanner, then I pulled, scanned, and listed cards on eBay, putting up 65 auctions tonight. I'd like to put up another 50 tomorrow. That's about all my productivity for the day. So sad.   I need to get off my ass and get a lot more done tomorrow. I absolutely  must  do laundry. I have nothing comfortable to wear. All my favorite clothes are dirty. My room looks like shit. My printer needs to be re-installed. I need to practice on the guitar. We rehearse again on Wednesday and I haven't practiced since last Thursday. I'd like to re-bathe the cats again. I wouldn't really  like to , but they need it again already. That carpet powder didn't seem to do jack.   Oh, and I need to get to sleep ealier at night so I can get my ass out of bed in the mornings so I can get a job.  Nothing new there.

        Powered Down   I barely slept Thursday night and I had to get up early (Noon) on Friday to wait for the refrigerator repairman (turns out the motor fell out). I was really tired, almost all day long, so I went to bed around 8:30-9pm Friday night. I read in bed for awhile before shutting the lights off.   As tired as I was, I just could not get to sleep. By 5am, I was out of bed having barely slept, if at all.   I tried turning on the PC but I couldn't get online again. I wound up talking to tech support at both Gateway and Roadrunner (twice) for the next two hours. It turns out that there's some kind of connectivity problem with Roadrunner. I thought that Spybot was causing my internet woes (see a few posts below) but it was my modem all along. Great. I stayed up until a little after 7am and went to bed again. I stayed down until after 5pm.   I've done nothing productive in the last couple days. I just haven't had any energy. I haven't felt like doing anything except going to bed, which is how I feel right now. Like I haven't slept enough already. Pathetic.   I have a ton of stuff that I need to do too. I need to hook my scanner and printer back up and get them working again, I need to pull and scan cards and list them on eBay, I need to do laundry, I need to clean my room, I need to change the cat litter, I need to clean and check cassette tapes (that I have sitting here waiting to be sold) and make labels for the ones without covers, and I need to play guitar and go over songs from our setlists.   So far, all I've done today is eat, watch TV, and type this post. I think I will probably be in bed again within the next hour or so. I don't know what is wrong with me anymore. I just can't get it together.

         urlLink The Friday Five     1. Do you watch sports? If so, which ones?   I follow basketball pretty closely, just the NBA, not college. I've been watching Bull Riding a lot lately (it's on every weekend), and I also watch boxing from time to time (whenever there's a really good matchup). Every so often I may turn on an NFL game, but I usually don't watch the whole thing or pay much attention to it. That's about it.    2. What/who are your favorite sports teams and/or favorite athletes?   I love the Orlando Magic, but I liked them a lot more before they let Darrell Armstrong go. Darrell was my favorite player on the team. He always gave 100% every time he stepped onto the court, but unfortunately, they let him go over the summer. So much for loyalty. They still have Tracy McGrady though, my second favorite player.    3. Are there any sports you hate?   Bull Fighting. Very cruel and unneccessary "sport". It doesn't sound right even calling it a "sport", I mean, where's the "sport" in it? Have the bullfighter fight the bull with his bare hands, no swords or daggers or drugs to slow the bull down, and it might be a sport then because at least the bull would have a chance, but as it is, it's just a slow, cruel slaughtering of an innocent animal.    4. Have you ever been to a sports event?   I've been to a few Pre-Season Orlando Magic games, when they played over here in Tampa, and when I was a kid, I used to go to a ton of baseball games during Spring Training (I live in Florida, you know) every year.    5. Do/did you play any sports (in school or other)? How long did you play?   I was the Dodgeball King, the Master, I tell you! Outside of school, I played Little League baseball for several years. I had a very good arm back in the day. I remember I once threw a perfect strike all the way from center field.

        The Anal Musician Reigns Supreme   JP and Jimmy were running late tonight and JP called up Circle and pushed our band practice to 7:30pm instead of 7pm. Unfortunately, he never told me or Al. Poor Al... he had to sit there for about 1/2 an hour before we finally showed up.   Once we all arrived and got going, we had a very productive, loose practice. The room sounded good, and, not to sound conceited or anything,  we  sounded pretty good. We ran through a lot of songs, covers and originals, tightening up the loose ends, and making changes here and there. Al took notes on what needs to be worked on with each song.   We did some jamming tonight too, much more than usual. We played bits and pieces of "American Woman", "Purple Haze" (with JP on drums), "Killing Floor" (with Al and me on guitar), "Centerfold" (J.Geils Band), "Don't Bring Me Down" (the ELO song... Al sang it), and "Rock N Me", the old Steve Miller song. Everyone seemed to enjoy playing "Rock N Me" a lot and it looks like we'll be adding that to our enormous stockpile of songs.   Some of the songs we did tonight, we haven't played in a long while: "Cold Shot" (we played this only once before... I need to work on the solo), "Rock This Town" (I got lost at first, we hadn't played it for well over a month), and "Before You Accuse Me", which I loathe playing (too many pointless solos in it).  We also tried-out Ben Harper's "Steal My Kisses" again, but Jimmy still hasn't progressed with the drumming on that.   Oh, and we tried doing "Wild Night" my way, the right way, and, strangely enough,  it worked out just fine . Duh! It's a classic song, so when you play it the way it was written and recorded, it  should  sound just fine!   JP seemed very pleased with it, even more so than I'd expected. I'm just happy to be doing Van Morrison some justice.   We played too long tonight, going 10 minutes into the following band's time. I felt pretty bad about that.   We have the same room next Wednesday, 7-10pm.   Sweet!

        The Anal Musician   No, that doesn't refer to anything rectal. It refers to me (well ok, maybe it does refer to something rectal after all) and my tendency to try and do things "the right way" with my band. JP, my bandmate is really getting frustrated with me correcting things when I find "errors" with them. I talked to him last night and we argued about one of the songs we're covering, Van Morrison's "Wild Night". He thinks the way we play it is just fine, good enough, but we're cutting the chorus in half and we haven't been doing the bridge part where Van Morrison stretches out the word "wild" with the sax mimicking the vocal part. We've also made the solo section twice as long as it should be. We started playing that song when we first jammed with Santana and Ronnie, we kind of threw it together on the spur of the moment and have been playing that way ever since. I'm going to try to get them to do it the right way tonight.  JP said he thinks the reason the band isn't making progress faster is because we keep changing things and the guys have to constantly re-learn the songs, which I find ridiculous. I've only made slight alterations to four or five songs:  I put the F#m chord back in "You May be Right". They weren't playing it at all.  I corrected the bridge on "Old Apartment". They were playing it exactly like the other mellow part of the song.  I corrected the solo section on Queen's "Crazy Little Thing Called Love". They were playing it like the bridge section, which doesn't match with the leads at all.   I changed the arrangement on one of JP's songs, "Promise You The Moon", and added a post solo section to which JP added to.   And now, I'm correcting "Wild Night". If those few, minor, changes are enough to throw off the band, then we aren't very good musicians to begin with.   Besides, I know why we're not progressing quicker, and I told JP as much: we don't practice enough; separately, or together as a band. Jimmy, the drummer, doesn't play at home at all. He plays once a week with us and that's it. If changes don't sink in completely that one day that he plays, he forgets them by the next week. I don't know about Al or JP, but I've been guilty of slacking off on practicing at home too and  that's  why we're not progressing quickly.   That's the main cause, but there are other factors that contribute to our slow developement: the  quantity  of material we're working on and the fact that the setlists aren't "set" lists (as in "set in stone"). Right now, we have three main setlists, which include about 35 songs. That wouldn't be too bad if the same songs appeared on the setlists week to week, but we add songs here, delete songs there, we have a different set list as a quartet than we did as a sextet, we went through a period where we were working heavily on covers, but then we started focusing more on JP's songs, and now we're half and half... ugh! We probably should have started with just one list at a time, nailed it, and then moved on to the next one and then continued like that. But we didn't. We have three setlists set before us, with three more setlists on the backburner, and we're expected to know everything all at once. Learning them isn't so hard, remembering them and making them sound good everytime you play them is. Repetition will help with that, but as I said, we aren't playing enough to do that, and since there's so much to learn and refine, we're spreading ourselves very thin.  Anyway, to make matters worse, I was practicing this afternoon (I played about 4 hours this week) and I found that the guys were playing another song wrong, "The Difference" by the Wallflowers. They play the wrong rhythm during the first part of the verse. They essentially play the main riff throughout the song insted of breaking it up a bit. Everytime I've played it with them, playing it the way they showed me, I thought "it just doesn't sound right playing the riff here, when he starts singing and all", and sure enough, it wasn't the right way.   It may be a tense practice tonight.

        PC Shenanigans   I went to get online this afternoon, but lo and behold, I couldn't get online again. Dammit. After all that work I did getting things straight again... grrrr!!!! I played around with it for about two hours before I finally said "screw it" and wiped my whole hard drive. I spent pretty much the whole night erasing my hard drive, formatting it, and re-loading everything. I managed to do almost all of it myself too. I followed a list that I wrote down the last time I had to do this, but I forgot to write down a couple things at the end and wound up having to make a call to Gateway technical support.   While I was on the phone with a Gateway tech I brought up the problem with my motherboard again and raised a little hell over it.   See, back in April, one of their tech people had me take my PC apart and I located a blown capacitor on the motherboard, she said she'd be sending out a replacement and would have someone come out and install it for me... all free of charge. Well I waited two weeks, three weeks, still no board, so I called Gateway and asked where the motherboard was. They told that the order had been cancelled. Nice of them to let me know about it... not. I talked to several people after that, trying to go up the chain, and they told me that the blown capacitor wasn't enough of a problem to merit replacing it, which really pissed me off. My warranty covers all parts and labor, there was no reason to let a problem stand just because it wasn't a huge problem, but they disagreed and I hung up angry and bitter. "Fuck Gateway", I said, I'll buy a Dell in a few months and be done with them."   Unfortunately, I didn't get a job as soon as I'd hoped and now it looks like I'll keep using my Gateway for at least six more months. So tonight, I asked the tech person I was talking to if I could speak to a supervisor. I decided to get this situation fixed to my satisfaction once and for all.   I'd discovered that my warranty ran out last month, but I made the initial complaints about the motherboard while my warranty was still good, so they should'nt be able to blow me off because of the warranty. I was prepared to argue my case.   I was put in contact with a senior tech person who not only understood my problem, but was sympathetic to my plight. He took care of everything himself, ordered me a new motherboard, and gave me his phone number so he can help me install it once I get the new motherboard in (3-5 days). Wow! Now  that's  service!  I'm glad that this is finally getting resolved, but I'm still a little sore with Gateway because they should have taken care of my problem the first time around.   While I was on the phone with them, I wound up adding a few purchases to my Gateway credit card: Windows XP software (full) and the 2004 Norton internet tools.   After the new software and motherboard are installed, this sucker should run like a dream. It'd damn well better.

         urlLink What's On...Wednesday      What's On your pet peeves list Right Now?   First and foremost: Spammers. I usually give my Hotmail account out when an email address is required, which really isn't that often, but the amount of spam I get in my Hotmail inbox is simply ridiculous. Yesterday, I cleared out over 130 emails, only 2 of which was something that I actually wanted. And now, I'm starting to get spam in my main email account, which is very aggravating to me since I give that address out to almost no one. Somewhere along the line, someone, somewhere, is violating their privacy agreement.   If the volume of spam isn't bad enough, the  kinds  of spam I get make it intolerable. Almost all of them involve someone trying to give me a loan, set me up with singles in my area, or they're trying to help me get a bigger penis. Why does every spammer out there think I'm a broke, lonely guy with a dinky wang?   Ok, so they're right, but it's still annoying.  My Mom doesn't enjoy receiving the penis enlargement spams either. Besides, she lives with me, so she's already got a big prick.   (rim shot)  Thank you! I'll be here all week!  But seriously folks...

        Columbo And The Case Of 32 Tapes   I woke up today, looked at my clock and saw that it said it was after 5:30pm, so I got up. When I came out into the living room, Mom was home, the new refrigerator was here (empty still), and it was only 2:15pm. She said the power was out for awhile today, screwing up my clock. Mom and I ordered lucnh from Bradford Pub, Nachos & Quesadillas. We had to to scrounge for change to pay for it all... pretty sad. Anyway, we chowed down and watched "Columbo" together.   I got my last shipment of cassette tapes in today (I don't have any more due in), and it was a great lot! Here's what I got:  Bad Religion "Stranger Than Fiction", Blues Traveler "Travelers and Thieves" & "Four", Boyz II Men "Cooleyhighharmony", Bush "Sixteen Stone", Elastica "Elastica", Green Day "1,039 / Smoothed Out Slappy Hours", "Kerplunk!", "Dookie", & "Insomniac", Hole "Live Through This" & "Pretty on the Inside", Hootie & the Blowfish "Cracked Rear View", Jimi Hendrix "The Ultimate Experience", Nirvana "Bleach", "Nevermind", "Incesticide", "In Utero", & "Unplugged In New York", Primus "Pork Soda" & "Tales From The Punchbowl", Red Hot Chili Peppers "What Hits!?"  & "One Hot Minute", Smashing Pumpkins "Pisces Iscariot" & "Siamese Dream", Soundgarden "Superunkown", Stone Temple Pilots "Core", The Offspring "Ignition" & "Smash", The Presidents of the United States of America "The Presidents of the United States of America", Van Halen "Balance", and Weezer "Weezer".   I paid a grand total of $11.75 for everything, 32 tapes plus a 3-drawer storage case... a really nice deal! Everything was in very good shape too, but unfortunately, the 3-drawer case got damaged during shipping (some of the clips that hold the tapes in the tray got snapped). I think I'm going to keep almost all of these for myself (a few I had already and a few I don't want), and I needed the Hendrix tape for my collection! Sweet!  I changed cases on them all (put new ones on) and re-organized my tape collection in my room (I'm running out of storage for them). After I finished doing that, I threw on the CD from the last band practice and played along with it, and then I goofed around on guitar for awhile. I played about an hour altogether.    I should be cleaning my room or listing cards for sale on eBay right now, but I'm watching TV instead ("Everybody Loves Raymond" and "Seinfeld"). I know,  I suck .   I'm hoping to be in bed by Midnight tonight. Whether or not that will actually happen, we shall see.

        Spyware Woes   So... yesterday I sat at the PC almost all day and night. My stupid PC started fucking up again, not letting me access the internet at all. I attributed the problem to the Spybot Search & Destroy software, since I've had this same problem twice since I installed it. I decided to uninstall Spybot, even though, for the most part, I like the program, then I washed my hard drive to get rid of the deleted Spybot files completely, but I still couldn't get on the internet (my cable modem was working and everything else looked fine). I did a system restore, but Spybot magically re-appeared on my PC. Apparently, you need a patch to uninstall it properly. I found that out, leter, on the Spybot website. I wish I would have known this beforehand, it would've saved me a lot of time. I spent  hours  working on the problem. Anyhow, I finally got everything working again, I even re-installed Spybot (it does a great job of finding spyware). If I have the same problem again, I will look for answers on Spybot's site right away next time. I really would like to find some way of taking Google off of Spybot's kill list (because Google uses spyware in their new toolbar, which I didn't even have), I really, really miss Google.

         urlLink Monday Madness     Last week I asked you to list your favorites...........this week we'll do just the opposite. "What is your LEAST favorite..........."    1. food:    I will not eat another Lima Bean for as long as I live. No way, Jo-se.     2. type of music:    I don't know which I like least, Rap or Death Metal, but they both annoy the piss out of me. Rap because of the folks who rap/talk like ignorant, uneducated hoodlums (which, no doubt, some of them are) and Death Metal because Death Metal singers usually sound like Marine Corps Drill Instructors barking out orders. That's not music, that's Boot Camp.    3. subject of discussion:   Women's menstrual stuff. My sister and my niece terrorize me with it, endlessly.    4. time of day:   Bedtime. Read my blog and you'll know why. (Hint: I don't sleep well)   5. time of year:   Summertime, because it's too freaking hot and because I don't enjoy mosquitoes or their lovely bites.    6. fragrance:   Is "shit" a frangrance? If so, then "shit". Not a good smell.    7. actor/actress:   I can't stand Hugh Grant or Sandra Bullock/Julia Roberts (who are essentially the same).    8. commercial:   See question #3. Tampons, pads, etc...   9. television sitcom:   There are too many awful sitcoms out there nowadays to name just one, "That '70's Show" is really bad, but there are several others just as bad or even worse. "Full House" may take the cake as crappiest show of all-time though. One of the worst, most nauseating television shows ever made.    10. singer:    Madonna. She began the whole trend of wearing less clothes in order to sell more crappy records. It's a sad commentary on the American public that that shit actually works, but it does, therefore Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and the scores of other crappy, half-dressed artists out there nowadays, are all her fault.   It's just too bad I can't blame her for the boy band thing... or can I?

         urlLink Monday Mission      1. If you were to go on a diet (not that you should, babe, you look marvelous), which of the "fad diets" sounds the most appealing to you?   The Slim Fast thing  seems  do-able, but I tried it before and it didn't work very well. I don't think I drank enough water to supplement the Slim Fast. Of course, if I drank as much water as I should, in the first place, diet or no, I probably wouldn't be as bad off as I am.    2. Do you get much exercise?   No. Almost none. That's one of the reasons I like it when I get to have my niece or nephews down, they keep me active. I usually sit all day and night, on the couch watching TV, in front of the PC, or at the dinner table. I keep wanting to take walks at night, but I still haven't started yet. I just don't like doing it alone.    3. Have you ever raided someone's junk pile that was left out for the garbage truck? Or gone dumpster diving? What did you find?   Back when I was a kid, dumpster diving was an everyday thing. We (my sister and I) had to walk through an industrial park to get home and they had a lot of dumpsters to go through. We'd bring home paper mostly, clean sheets we could draw on, but for me, my biggest thrill was finding dirty magazines, which we would on rare occasions. I was a pretty creatrive kid, and sometimes I'd make spaceships or command centers for my Star Wars dolls using electrical parts and whatnot that I'd find in the dumpsters.   I actually took my nephew dumpster diving awhile back. I was telling him about how me and his mom used to do it and decided to let him have a try, but unfortunately, they were freshly emptied.  Oh, and yes, I have gone through a neighbor's trash pile before, a couple of year's ago actually. I still have (and use) an electric space heater that I got from there.    4. Do you have any memories of ugly carpeting in your home or someone else's?    My bathroom carpet wasn't bad looking when we first laid it, but eventually I cleaned my toilet out with bleach and it splashed out leaving little white stains all around it. Later, I tried cleaning it with some kind of cleaning acid which also splashed out and left little burn holes around it... it looks so gross. I was going to lay new carpet down, but Mom hijacked the roll and put it in her room. So... I still have that nasty carpeting down. Ick.   5. What summertime chores will you be glad to see go away for the winter months?   I don't do anything outside, so I really down't have any summertime chores. I live in Florida, and sadly,  Fall and Winter aren't  that  much different from Summer anyway.   6. Do you have a(ny) favorite football team(s)? Do you and your family root for the same teams to win?   I really don't follow football at all, I'm more of a basketball guy, but my sister and her family are big Tampa Bay Buccaneers fans. They're also Florida Gators fans, college football.    7. I will be heading to Anaheim next month to stay a few days for a convention. It would be great to meet up with some Bloggers, but I just don't know many out there. If you were to visit California, are there any Bloggers you'd like to meet up with? (And if you are in California, then who would you like to come see you!)   Not really. I mean, there are some bloggers from California whose blogs I read, but I don't know them personally and they don't know me at all, so it'd be quite odd if I did want to meet them.     BONUS: Where can you begin to make your dreams all come true on the land or on the sea?   But not in the air? Or up in outer space? What about below ground, like in a cave?     Today's Comment Question: If you could do so, who would you vote for in the California recall elections?   Gray Davis. Not that I give a crap about their election or support Davis at all, I just don't like the whole business of re-calling someone who has already been voted in. It's a waste of time and money.

        To Sleep, Or Not To Sleep...   I stayed up yesterday until nearly 9am before I went to bed, trying to change my sleep schedule. I had wanted to stay up longer, but I just couldn't do it. I slept until about 5:15pm.   Last night, I went to bed around 4am, and here it is, almost 4 hours later, and I'm back out of bed again, not having slept a wink. I got really tired around 4am and I thought I had a chance for some sleep. I should've known better. I don't know how long I'll make it today, but it doesn't look good for me at all. My back is bothering me, my left leg, from the calf down, feels funny (achy), and I think I have a bladder/prostrate problem (which I'd rather not go into). I  need  to go to bed, even if just to rest.   If I'm going to try and stay up today, then I won't be doing my auctions tonight. I'll be in bed when I should be doing that stuff. This is a problem. I suppose I can ask Mom if I can borrow $5 - $10 from her to get me through the week, and then list like mad next weekend. If I do that though, I absolutely  have to  list next weekend, no excuses.  It's not a good time to be broke. Our refrigerator crapped out on us again, and for good this time. I wish I could help out around here financially, but until I get my shit together and get a job, I'll continue to come up short in that department.   *Sigh*  Why does everything, even something as simple as sleep, have to be such a struggle for me? I'm so tired. And weary.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  I've been playing two of my new Jimi Hendrix CD's: the bootleg I won on eBay, "Hear My Freedom", and "Martin Scorsese Presents the Blues: Jimi Hendrix". I've also had a few tapes on throughout the week, stuff by Billy Squier, Crowded House, and others.   Watching on TV:  All week long, I've been watching "Martin Scorsese Presents The Blues" on PBS, watching some of the episodes two and three times. It's really rekindled my love of the Blues. Unfortunately, tonight's episode is the last in the series. I haven't watched much else this week, other than my usual "Everybody Loves Raymond" and "Seinfeld" block in the early evening. Most of my other shows have been repeats all week, and "Real Time with Bill Maher" has ended it's season (and won't be back until 2004). Bill Maher's show really should be on  every  week, none of this "end of season" bullshit. I watched a little Bull Riding earlier tonight and I watched several documentaries on Ancient Egypt this morning before I went to bed.     Downloading:  I've been downloading music from some of the artists I've been seeing and hearing on the Blues documentary: Son House, Blind Willie Johnson, Skip James, J.B. Lenoir, Blind Lemon Jefferson, and Chris Farlowe. Mostly musicians I'd heard of but never really heard much from (with the exception of Blind Willie Johnson, who I've heard before). Being able to download music on the internet is a great thing; it's like having a library at your fingertips.    Reading:  I read about 2/3 of "Moby Dick", but I haven't picked it back up for about a week. Pitiful.   Jamming:  We jammed on Wednesday, and I talked to JP on Friday about recording next week's practice as well. We really need to get a list of which song's, exactly, we need to work on for the recording. I practiced along with the CD JP just gave me for awhile tonight.     Working:  I'm sick of saying the same things over and over again here, "no job yet", "not looking yet", "not getting up in the morning yet", I should just eliminate this section until I get a job.    Buying:  Nothing. I'm flat broke.     Selling:  Nothing yet. I haven't done jack about listing cards on eBay yet, and I haven't done anything with all of the tapes I have for sale yet either.    Eating:  Mostly ham & cheese or roast beef & cheese sandwiches this week. I had cheeseburgers tonight though. Cheese, cheese, cheese. Too much cheese. Mom made banana bread and I've been chowing on that. I've also been snacking on pumpkin seeds too. I think I've been snacking too much. I need to eat better and I need to excercise daily (or nightly). I really hate being fat.    Feeling:  Mentally: Worried and frustrated. Worried about money and about my job situation, and frustrated with myself about my weight and my inability to get my sleep schedule straight.    Physically: My back is a little sore from yesterday's activities, but other than that, I'm feeling alright.     Planning:  As the holidays near, it feels like time is slipping away from me. I need to get my sleeping problems corrected and I need to get a job. I have got to get busy on my auction stuff and eBay store tomorrow, to get some money rolling in again. I need to buy an amplifier. I need to start excersing every day and I need to start eating better, healthier. I have a lot of things to work on.

        Holy Catbaths, Batman!   I told my Mom as I was going into it (the cat baths) that Stevie was going to be a problem; he didn't disappoint. Jimmy, the larger and smarter of the two cats, wasn't too bad. He definitely wanted out, but he eventually saw that that wasn't going to happen and he chilled out, meowing his discontentment rather than fighting me. Stevie, the smaller and dumber of my two cats (seriously, he's really slow to catch on to things), fought me all the way. It's because he's dumber that I knew he'd be harder to bathe (ignorance breeds fear). The cat went nuts as soon as his paws hit the water. I thought he was going to hurt himself the way he was struggling to get the hell out of there, climbing the walls and driving for the tub edge. I tried not to be too rough with him, but he had me pissed before long and I finally had to grab him by the scruff of the neck and  sit his ass down . I finally got him settled a bit and was able to finish his bath, but he's none to happy with me still.   I am so glad I cut their nails first. Stevie easily could have hurt himself and he surely would have scratched the shit out of me.   So... I'm beat.   Gary go nite-nite now (not really).

        Procrastination's Bite In The Ass   Well, I waited all week to do anything and now, come Friday, I have to do  everything . I vacuumed the house once over, then I had to apply the flea powder and sweep it into the carpet. I had to let it sit for an hour and then I had to vacuum all over again. Now, well, after I rest a bit, I'm going to cut the cats nails and try and bathe them. They're locked back in Mom's room right now. I had to quarantine them while I had the flea powder down. I probably should have quarantined myself; I breathed in a bunch of it and it's all over my feet as well.   Our fridge quit working last night and by the time I got up today (@1:15pm), everything was thawing out. I had to throw away a ton of food. Most of it looked pretty shitty anyway though, freezer burnt. A friend of the family, Mike, came by and got it working again, but it's just a temporary fix, we'll still need to buy another fridge in the very near future.   Because our freezer food was thawing, I had to use what I could and I cooked a turkey roll for dinner while I did the vacuuming. When Mom got home, she threw in two mac & cheese/broccoli dinners as well. Yuk. The turkey roll didn't go with the other stuff very well. I didn't finish my dinner, Mom had it.   Between dinner and Mike coming by to work on the fridge, JP came buy with a CD he made from the other night. It sounded much better, clearer than I ever imagined it would. Very cool! He wants me to listen to it and let him know which songs I think should go on a demo to hand out to club owners/bookers. He seemed very enthusiastic about the stuff I was playing on the guitar (for the most part). He said he'd never really been able to just "listen" before.  He only stayed a fewminutes before he split.   Mom and I listened to to the CD while we ate dinner. She didn't say anything about my playing, how the band sounds, or whether she liked it or not. But that's nothing new. My parents have never shown much interest in my music. My always-thoughtful father actually thought I wanted to be a "magician".   "Uhh, dad, I want to be a 'musician', not a 'magician'".   Had he actually given a shit about me and who I am, he'd have known that.  And so I'm off to wash my kitties.

America can ill afford to spend another $87 billion in support of a war that has no end, no exit, no logic, and no sense. It is time to come up with a plan to get the UN in and the US out.

         urlLink 3 for Thursday     1. What are your 3 worst fears/phobias?   Being out on open water makes me nervous, especially at night, but I don't think I'm afraid or phobic enough to prevent me from going out on open water, even at night. Same thing with heights; I may get nervous peering over the edge of a tall building, but I still went up there and peered over the edge. It bothers me when people stare at me, I'm very self-concious, but again, I still get up on a stage, in front of people, to play with my band.    2. What are 3 fears/phobias that you've overcome?   Well it's like I just said above, I may have fears or phobias, but they're not so bad that they can't be overcome. I think all fears can be overcome or at least, dealt with.    3. What are 3 fears/phobias of others that you think are plain silly?   My niece is the Queen of Silly Phobias. She went through a long period when she'd wake up every night afraid that a giant meteor was going to hit the Earth. Then I think it was rain or lightning that freaked her out. I remember we were playing frisbee out in the street one night last year and there was some lightning in the sky, far away from us, but as soon as she saw the first flash, she went running into the house. Then she moved on to fearing tornadoes. OK, so tornadoes are not uncommon here in Florida, but she has actually grabbed her two brothers, took them and hid in the bathroom during a recent summer thunderstorm. She had the boys upset and crying over nothing but her own fear. She's like Chicken Little.    Bonus: Have you ever had a really bad experience with one of your phobias/fears  one that youll never forget and possibly has scared you for life?   I've had two experiences with the same thing that has made me wonder about myself. One time, when I was a kid on vacation up in Pennsylvania, I rode a bike straight into a brick wall. I was traveling really fast down a hill and I just froze, didn't turn, didn't jump off, nothing. Whammo! Then, several years later, I did almost the same thing again. I was riding my bike, pedaling as fast as I could and I ran right into a cement street light. I flipped over the handlebars and flew through the air before landing on my back. Again, I froze up. It's made me worry about how well I handle speed. I don't think I'd ever trust myself on a motorcycle.

        On Stage   We got together at Circle for band rehearsal tonight, but this time we played in a different room, the "Stage Room", so-called because of the 2-foot high wooden stage that takes up most of the room. It sounded much better than the room we've been playing in, and we seem to have had more energy and better vibes in the different room tonight. We booked the "Stage Room" again for next Thursday.   I thought we were going to be going through our set lists tonight, but JP had other plans. He made arrangements with his wife (Doris) and a friend of hers (Emily) to come and record us on his digital 4-track. His idea was to make a demo to give out to club owners/bookers so they'll have an idea what we sound like before they book us.  First of all, it would have been nice if he'd given me some warning. If I had known we'd be recording demos tonight, I certainly would have practiced at home beforehand. No one else seemed to know we would be recording tonight either, and none of us, including JP, were prepared for it. It was all terribly unplanned, un-thought out. He didn't even have a list of what songs we'd be recording.   Secondly, if he'd have discussed this with us beforehand, we could have made a better demo for about the same cost as practice tonight. Circle has a studio right there. We could've decided which songs to record and then we could have practiced them tonight and recorded them next week.  He's too gung-ho on playing out. He wants to play out  immediately , the sooner the better, but we really aren't ready yet. I think a lot of it is pressure from his wife. She thinks that rehearsal is pretty much goofing off, hanging with the guys, but playing out is actually  doing something .   We wound up wasting a lot of time tonight. It took them awhile to get the 4-track ready and get the levels set, but that worked out well for me because it gave me a chance to play some of my own songs with Al and Jimmy. We jammed on three or four of my songs, which is unheard of. I'm lucky if I get to jam on just one of my originals during a band rehearsal.  We also wasted a lot of time because we had to do some of the songs over and over again. We were all making mistakes, and JP was having equipment troubles too. I wasn't real happy with my solos for some of the songs either. For instance, Ronnie always did the sax solo on "Wild Night" and we really haven't played the song since we played it with him and Santana, Labor Day weekend, so I had to improvise the solo and I know I didn't get it quite right.   It's hard to say whether it was a productive night or not; I guess that'll depend on how well the recordings came out, and if we've got enough usable material for a demo. It's good that we played the songs we did, but with all of the mistakes we were making, it also showed me that we just aren't playing enough. Myself, I'm going to have to get back into the habit of practicing at home everyday. I know Jimmy's talking about buying an electric drum kit so he can play at home finally. If we could play twice a week, we'd get stronger, tighter, and better a lot quicker, but I'm the only guy in the band that can do it.   *Sigh*

         urlLink "What's On..." Wednesday     What's on your 'to do' list right now?   Oh boy... a whole lotta stuff.   First off, I need to finish shaving (I trimmed my beard off last night) and then I need to take a shower.   I need to clean my room (slob central).   I need to trim the nails of both of my cats, and then I need to bathe both cats (somehow, my indoor cats have gotten fleas).   I need to put down flea powder on the carpet and then I need to vacuum it up (I should probably vacuum before I lay the powder too).   I need to practice on the guitar (we rehearse tonight and I haven't picked up my electric guitar since last rehearsal).   I need to start looking for a job (as soon as I can get my ass up in the mornings).   I need to start getting my ass up in the mornings.   I need to start scanning and listing items in my eBay store, and I need to list auctions this weekend (I'm broke again).   I need to go through the tapes I've been buying and make sure they're all clean and working well and then I need to sell them, in the paper or at the flea market.   I need to find some way to sell my basketball cards too (I have too many of them, taking up too much space).   I need to do laundry again too.     Just what I said, "a whole lotta stuff".

        Not So Fast, Mr. Sleepyhead   Aww hell. Well I  tried  to go to bed early last night, anyway. I hit the sack before Midnight, still feeling sleepy, but wouldn't you know it... alas... no sleep for me. My mind kept wandering, never settling down long enough to fall asleep, and my body tossed and turned and thrashed about all night long. My bed looks like a bomb exploded in it; the bottom sheet has been torn almost all the way off the bed, my pillows are all over the floor, and my blankets look like twisted knots. I don't know what it is with me and sleep anymore, but it's really getting ridiculous. Instead of getting up by 10am, like I'd hoped I would, I got up around 2:30pm. Wonderful. Sleep, for me (as of late), is a lot like gambling; once in awhile I'll get lucky, but mostly I get dealt a losing hand.

        Friday Night/Saturday   Mom finally got home sometime after 8pm, bringing with her both of my nephews, Jesse and Austin, and some Popeye's chicken. I normally only have one boy at a time down here because they argue and fight too much, but Mom thought it'd be ok (like she's the one who watches them when they're here).   After chowing down, I showed the boys a bunch of space-related pictures and vidoes from the internet, stuff from Hubble and NASA. After they got bored with that, I took them outside to throw the Frisbee, but the wind was too strong, so instead, we had a pop rock fight and I lit off a pack of jumping jacks.   It was getting pretty cold out, so we came in and I had them color in some shapes I'd drawn for them. They seemed to enjoy that a lot.   After the coloring, we took turns drawing goofy pictures. I think it was shortly after that when Austin went to bed. Jess and I stayed up late watching "Alien Resurrection" on AMC (edited). We didn't get to bed until about 2:30am.     I had a hell of a time sleeping, in fact, I hardly did. I had the heat on in the house and I was too hot and uncomfortable in bed. I was out of bed around 11:00am and I don't think I got more than a couple hours sleep, if that.   Mom had just made waffles for the boys, so I had waffles for breakfast... good stuff.   After breakfast, I took the boys outside for awhile. We blew up anthills, and then grapefruits, with firecrackers, then we shot my BB gun at a cardboard box I'd set up out by the fence. After a while, we started shooting grapefruits too. I had to go in and do some eBay stuff and packaged cards to be mailed, while the boys watched "Jimmy Neutron".   Mom ran out to the post office for me while Jess and I ate lunch, then we went outside again and played football for a long time. We tried Frisbee again after we were done playing football, and I picked up another boy, some young kid named Sean (sp?) from down on the corner. They all threw the Frisbee together, but they weren't throwing so well (kept hitting the house) so I ran inside and grabbed the paper airplanes Jess and I made the last time he was down (I saved them) and the boys threw them around for a while.   We tried playing football again, but Sean had no clue how to play, so we played Capture The Flag instead.   Mom made hot chocolate for everyone between football and Capture The Flag, which was cool of her to do.   After Capture The Flag, Jess went in to watch football and I stayed outside with Austin and Sean and played catch with plastic Hai-Alai scoops and a ball. Eventually, Sean went home and Austin and I played with the scoop/ball thing. Jess kept running in and out of the house and I'd let him play until he split again.   Finally, the boys and I went inside for the night. I put on the music stations on the cable box and we laughed and joked about the Opera one a lot and the boys did goofy dances.   We had dinner, and then we went into my room and I went through my the stuff in my black hassock, looking through old family photos, old drawings the kids did, and I showed them my dad's painted soldiers. We looked through the Christmas catalog after that, and then we went out and watched TV the rest of the night.   I dug out an old video I'd taped for Austin long agao that he'd never seen, "MicroCosmos", a documentary about insects and various life in a French field. They loved it. I tried another nature video after that, but they were getting goofy (Austin was tired) so I put on Animal's Funniest Videos. Austin kept closing his eyes, starting to sleep, but refusing to go to bed, so I finally had to make him go to bed. He wasn't happy about that at all.   Jess and I stayed up and watched "Naked Gun" and laughed our butts off.   He just went to bed abouit an hour ago and I'm heading there soon.   I think I have a cold.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  I have Cheap Trick's "Lap Of Luxury" tape on right now, it's not bad. Last night I had on Todd Barry's "Medium Energy" CD, and throughout the week I've listened to The Stray Cats "Built For Speed" tape and a few others that I can't recall right now.    Watching on TV:  I've been watching "The Ellen Degeneres Show". "The People's Court", "Judge Mathis", and sometimes "Family Feud". Later on, I'll watch "The Simpsons", "Everybody Loves Raymond"and "Seinfeld". I haven't been watching my usual late night shows this week, too many repeats.    Downloading:  I downloaded some Ron White stuff today and will be downloading some Larry The Cable Guy stuff as well. They were hilarious on that Blue Collar special last night. I really want to get their CDs now. I also downloaded some of Triumph The Insult Comic Dog's CD, "Come Poop With Me", and I want that one now as well. Some very funny stuff on there (Robert Smigel is a comedy genius).    Reading:  I started reading "The Return Of Sherlock Holmes" a while back and I haven't picked it back up for a couple of weeks now. I love the stories, but just haven't been reading at bedtime like I used to.     Jamming:  We played on Wednesday this week (see  5 posts down) and we play again next Thursday. I really have got to get my ass in gear and start practicing at home again. I've been the weak point the last two practices and I don't want that to be a continuing trend.   Working:   I've been looking, but haven't found anything yet. I may try this place down the road on Monday though. They are hiring for sewing machine operators and didn't say anything about experience, so I may be able to get in there (we'll see).    Buying:  I spent a quarter this week on a tape that turned out to be defective. I've been good.    Selling:  My auctuions were moving along nicely before Thanksgiving but seem to have stalled. Hopefully I'll do ok, but you never know.     Eating:  I ate badly a couple times this week (homemade bacon cheeseburgers) and I've had apple pie a few times in the last 24 hours. I've been eating Manhattan Clam Chowder, crackers & spray cheese, I had frostbitten pork with rice and squash one night, and I had half a tuna sandwich last night (I guess that could be considered "dinner"). I've been drinking a lot of decaffeinated Pepsi lately, I guess I should cut down on that. I've mostly been drinking iced tea, milk, and Gatorade.   Feeling:    Mentally: Right now... tired. Just tired.    Physically: I guess I feel ok, I feel tired physically too, but on the whole, I'm ok.    Planning:  Got to get a job!

         urlLink The Friday Five     1. Do you like to shop? Why or why not?   I love shopping, but not shopping for clothes. I really enjoy hitting flea markets, thrift stores, yard sales, and pawn shops looking for steals and deals. That is great fun to me.    2. What was the last thing you purchased?   A Pat Benatar tape for $0.25, from a thrift shop.    3. Do you prefer shopping online or at an actual store? Why?   Most of the things I am looking to buy simply can't be found in my local stores (cool clothes in my size, specific CDs, etc..), so I  have to  shop for them online. However, I'd prefer it if I could find them locally (and for the same prices that I get online).   4. Did you get an allowance as a child? How much was it?   I did, and it was $5 a week.   5. What was the last thing you regret purchasing?   The last thing I bought: that Pat Benatar tape for $0.25. It didn't work.

        A Return To Lameness   I was doing so well here lately, going to bed at a decent time and sleeping throughout the night, but these last two nights have sucked hard. I don't know if I even got an hour of solid sleep last night. I went to bed too late, 1:30am. I stayed up late watching "The Blue Collar Comedy Tour" with Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall, Ron White and Larry The Cable Guy (absolutely hilarious) and then half of "Saturday Night Live" with Matthew McConaughey, which I'd never seen. After I went to bed, I just couldn't get comfortable enough to fall asleep. It didn't help that I never ate any dinner last night either; it's not easy to go to sleep hungry. Anyhow, I finally had enough of the tossing and turning and uncomfortableness, and so around 9am, I just up and got out of bed. Not a great way to start the day.  I talked to Jesse this morning, he's coming down with my Mom tonight and spending the weekend with us. I have no idea what I'm going to do with him; both Mom and I are flat broke. Mom said the weather is supposed to be pretty shitty tomorrow too. Not good. Mom said she didn't know when they'd get here tonight, or whether they'd bring supper home with them, so I have no idea whether I am supposed to make my own dinner or eat with them and I won't know until they get here. Nice.   I've been struggling with my stupid computer  all freaking day . I am so sick of this thing. The problem is, I don't really know if it's the computer at all. It may well be that the problem is the cable modem. I have two big problems right now, or I did anyway. For the last week or two, everytime I would start up the computer I'd get The Blue Screen Of Death. I'd have to re-start it a couple of times before it would finally start up normally. Then, the second problem would start: internet connectivity. When I click on the explorer icon to get online, it usually doesn't work until I re-start the computer a couple more times. It says "Detecting Proxing" or "Trying to find.." then I get the "Can Not Be Found" page, which means "no internet for you!" I solved the first problem by doing a sytem restore, but I created another problem with Norton when I did that. I could only start-up in Safe Mode or else I'd get a NAV alert and wouldn't be allowed to procede. I finally had to un-do my sytem restore, uninstall Norton, and do a nother system restore. I re-loaded Norton again (with my new updated version) and now I can start up with no problem. I still have trouble getting online though. I'm on now, but it took an hour to get here. I finally called my ISP and asked for help. They had me do the same things I've been doing, but this time, of course, it worked. Man, I  hate  when that happens!   I don't know what this weekend is going to be like, but I hope it'll be better than these last two days.

        Thanksgiving Day... Continued   It hasn't been the ideal Thanksgiving Day, but it's been a productive one. I spent all afternoon and evening scanning and listing cards on eBay. However, I managed to stop long enough for some freshly baked apple pie... mmmmm. I haven't had dinner yet. I think I may be eating Manhattan Clam Chowder again. If I'm lucky, Mom will bring me back some leftover Thanksgiving chow, but I'm not counting on it, in fact, I'm not even sure she'll be home tonight.   Not much on TV tonight, some basketball, but nothing I have to watch. I think I'm going to get my laundry started then head to my room and start cleaning in there. I'll throw some music on and jam out while I work. It's been a quiet day.

        Thanksgiving Day   Ugh! What an awful night's sleep last night. I had an earache from practice that bothered me all through the night (it's still bothering me right now). I tossed and turned all night long, going in and out of sleep, never seeming to have any continuous sleep. Sometime after 4am, I was in the bathroon with stomach pains and "the big D" for about half an hour. After I'd gotten back to bed, I continued tossing and turning. Sometime in the morning I got a Charlie Horse in my calf. By the time Mom called me to get up (I had shut my alarm off after my bathroom trip, figuring I wasn't going anywhere today) I was tired and sore and felt like shit. I told her I wasn't going and she proceeded to yell at me and call me "stupid". Nice.   I finally got up around 11:30am, still feeling pretty crappy. I tried turning the PC on and it took about 15 minutes to get it to start up without the blue screen of death appearing and before it would allow me to go online. Windows Millenium really sucks.   I had some Manhattan Clam Chowder and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for lunch while I watched "Judge Mathis" and I threw an apple pie in the oven. It just came out and looks great! I don't have any Thanksgiving food here, so the apple pie is about as close to a Thanksgiving as I'm going to get this year.   I'd like to do some house cleaning today (especially in my room) and I need to do laundry still. I'd also like to list some more cards on eBay. It'd be nice if I could make enough from eBay to pay my bills and have some left over for Christmas, but that's not too likely.

        Wednesday   I slept in late today, til after 10pm, but I'd tossed and turned a lot during the night, so I guess I was making up for it.   After eating lunch, I got my mailings packaged and then Mom and I went out on the road. We went to the bank and I made a tiny little deposit, then we went to the Post Office and I mailed my stuff out, then we went up and down Ulmerton Road and then 66th Street looking for places that were hiring.   I had no luck. Every place that was hiring was hiring for jobs I have no experience doing. I haven't found a single job yet that I thought I could get. It's very discouraging.   We stopped at two thrift stores while we were out and I bought a Pat Benatar tape at one of them for $0.25, but when I got home and tried to play it, it was crap. It sounded like shit (not the music on it, but the tape itself).  I had band practice tonight and I sounded like crap again. I don't think being a day person is good for my guitar playing. I got tired early on. It seemed like I lacked my usual energy. It doesn't help that I haven't practiced all week either though.   We sounded pretty rough again, a lot of being me.  Part of the problem was with JP. His amp was too loud so I wasn't always hearing everything right and I was having to turn up a lot to meet him and turn down again when he switched to acoustic, so my sound was uneven; sometimes too loud, sometimes too low.   We jammed a little tonight, did some B-A thing I made up (one part with a melody line, the other part with riffs) and we also jammed on another of my unfinished songs.   Al sat and listened to me playing another of my songs while the others went out for a break and suggested that I record a handful of them on the 4-track and let him see if he can add anything to them. That's cool, because I was wondering if he'd want to do something like that since JP has his hands full with his own songs. Now I just have to go through all of my tapes and pull a handful of the better songs to work on. I've been meaning to do that for a long time anyway.  After practice, we sat around bullshitting until 11pm. I had asked the guys earlier if they wanted to play an extra hour tonight, but like last time, they all said no, they couldn't (their wives would be pissed). But, for as long as we sat there talking, we could have gotten that extra hour in. JP was willing, but the otrher guys weren't.  I guess I'm heading to bed in a few. I don't really want to go up to my brother-in-law's parents's house for Thanksgiving, but my Mom's pressuring me to go.  Oh well. I guess I'll try to make the best of it.   Happy Thanksgiving, everybody!

        Nap Time   I put off a nap until about 4pm, then I proceeded to "nap" until after 9pm. I just don't know how to do "naps".   I just realized that I hate the word "nap".  My headache is still lingering, ready to come back full force at any time.   I think I'm going back to bed in a few minutes, after I take the trash out.

        Under The Weather   I woke up before my alarm this morning with a raging headache that I haven't been able to shake all day (despite taking several Aleves). My sinuses don't seem bad enough to be causing it, so I don't know what the deal is. I'm also very sleepy, so I wonder if I got enough sleep last night. I  thought  I slept ok last night. The sleepiness could be from the weather, all overcast and drizzly. Whatever the reason for the headache and sleepiness, all I want to do is go back to bed.

        Random Monday-ness   I went to bed late last night (around 1am) and was out of bed before 9am (no alarm again).   I didn't get a whole lot done today.   I ate half a pecan pie.  I shaved to go job hunting, but I didn't go job hunting.   I shaved a little bit at a time, to amuse myself and my Mom (who is off from work all week). First I made a large goatee (going past the chin down to the neck, which I liked), then with with a little "3 Musketeers" goatee (which I didn't like), then went with the David Crosby-style moustache (uhhh... no), then the basic police officer/science teacher mustache (lame), then on to the Hitler/Chaplin 'stache (really funny looking), before finally shaving everything off.   I took a nap on the couch for about two hours (from 4:30pm-6:30pm) with Stevie sleeping on my legs.   It rained while I slept.  I watched the Iowa Democratic debates on TV tonight. I still think Dennis Kucinich is the best person running, but I just don't think he can get elected, which is too bad for all of us. I hope he stays in the race though, his voice should be heard.   Carol Moseley Braun and Al Sharpton can't get elected either. They are both intelligent people, but they have no chance of winning and are in effect watering down the candidate pool.   John Edwards reminds me of TV evangelist, or more accurately, a cross between a TV evangelist and John Davidson. He seems like a Clinton wannabe, a political slickboy. I wasn't impressed.   Wesley Clark was my second choice, but he's losing credability with me. He said something tonight about it being ok that software companies outsource jobs to India. I don't find that ok at all. I don't like his stance on flag-burning (he wants to make it illegal). He's kind of flaky and not in a good way (like Kucinich).   I do not like Howard Dean. No, sir, I don't like him. From his forced goofy smile to his pro-NRA stance on gun control, he rubs me the wrong way.   John Kerry and Dick Gephart ganged up on Dean a lot. I thought Kerry was pretty impressive though. I may consider him as my second choice.   Joe Leiberman, it turns out, was not invited to debate tonight, which is strange.   I'm going to bed a bit earlier tonight. I want to get somthing done tomorrow besides eating pie and napping.

        Pecan Pie   Mmmm... I just had some Pecan Pie, too... damn... good. I treated myself to a piece after a busy night of listing on eBay. I listed about 82 auctions tonight.   I wound up putting aside most of the cards I'd pulled for tonight (all that work for nothing) and grabbed a bunch of Michael Jordan cards to put up instead. I think I listed about 50 Jordans. Hopefully they'll sell ok (I need a good week).   Earlier in the afternoon, Mom and I went out to a few couple more thrift shops, but alas, I found nothing I had to have, not for the prices they were asking anyways. One of them had some decent stuff (books and tapes), but were asking more than I was willing to pay: $2-$2.50 for  paperbacks ? I don't think so. They had a Sherlock Holmes book I really wanted but the cover was kind of yucky so I passed. They had an awesome Edgar Allan Poe book, but they wanted $17 for it! Some  thrift  store... sheesh! I've gotten books, hardcover and paperback, for as low as $0.25 at Goodwill.  That's  thrift.   Mom is off all this week. I'm hoping to go job early in the week. I have to shave still and do laundry, so I may not start until Tuesday, but we'll see.   There wasn't much for work in the want ads today, Honeywell is hiring (they're near-by), but I have no idea what kinds of job/s they're hiring for or whether it's something I can do. I really don't know where else to look for work. Every place I've seen that is hiring is looking for experience or else heavy lifting is required (I have a bad back). It's very discouraging.   I would love a nice mailroom job, a job where I could just do my job and go home at the end of the day; no hassles, no worries. But like I said, the want ads are pretty bare, almost nothing but telemarketing jobs, which I refuse to do on principle.   *sigh*  Here's hoping I luck into something good... and soon.

        Sleepy Sunday    As predicted, it took a while for me to fall asleep. I didn't get to bed until nearly 1am, then I laid in bed playing guitar while simultaneously petting Stevie. He kept climbing up on top of the guitar, where my hand was picking and strumming, and nudging my hand with his head. He stayed with me almost the whole night/morning.  For some reason, when I play the guitar in bed, he takes it that it's a cue for him to break into my room (he forces the door open) and get pet. He's goofy. Sometimes he bites the strings while I'm playing.   I got up around 7:30am to pee and I found that my hamper was knocked over and a roll of toilet paper was sitting in the toilet (one of the cats was having a good ole' time last night). I fished it out, then I went back to bed.   At 8:30am, the alarm went off and I re-set it for another hour, then that one went off and I slept through it. I finally got up a little before 11am. No more coffee so late at night.

        A Totally Unthrilling Saturday   I got out of the house today, but nothing good happened.   I got that big package ready and mailed it, then I rode along while Mom ran an errand, and then we headed over to Goodwill, where they had absolutely nothing I wanted. Everything looked pretty well picked over. Mom bought a shirt for Jesse, I bought nothing. I thought about going over to Best Buy for that Beatles CD, but I changed my mind at the last minute. I figured I'd need all of my "extra money" (I have about $10 in my checking that hasn't been spent yet) for band practice on Wednesday.   I did wind up spending $5 today; I bought lunch at Checkers (I wish I hadn't of though... ick).   I spent most of the day today checking out end-of-auction prices on various basketball cards, still trying to figure out what to list this weekend, and going through basketball cards. I've narrowed the 1,000+ cards down to about 200, still need to lose another 100 or so. I'm going to try to list 100 cards tomorrow night, something I've not done before, so I'll need to start listing early. I want to end them all by 10:30pm this week, just in case I get a job and need to get up for work early the day after they end (I'm usually up late after they end, sending out invoices).   Besides doing all of the card stuff, I got my tapes ready for the flea market. I was thinking about going tomorrow since it doesn't look like Jesse will be coming down next weekend either his cousins are down for Thanksgiving), but tomorrow is going to pretty busy with the eBay stuff and I don't want to over extend myself.  I really don't want to go up to my sister's in-laws house for Thanksgiving. They've got a houseful as is, plus my sister's family, and then Mom and I. Besides, I thought I could play with the kids while I was up there, to kill time, but they're going to have their cousins to play with and I really have nothing to say to any of them. I think I may just stay home alone this Thanksgiving... it won't be the first time.   I've been drinking coffee all night, like a dumbass, and now, as I finish my last cup, it's bedtime. I hope I can sleep okay, but I have a feeling it's going to be a rough night ahead.

        Saturday Morning   I got out of bed just before 9am this morning,  without using the alarm clock ! I am finally becoming a "normal" day person.  I have a busy day ahead of me, probably a busy weekend. I need to package up that side deal (100+ cards) and get it mailed out today. I pulled cards to list this weekend, about 1,000 of them and I have to narrow them down to about 100, then I have to scan them all and list them on eBay tonight and tomorrow night. I need to get a haircut and I need to shave so I can start job hunting on Monday. I need to do laundry too.   I also need to clean my room, the living room, the dining room, the hobby room, and my bathroom. I need to clean the porch and fix the screen (another shitty job done by my brother-in-law). I need to get stuff ready to go to the flea market next weekend too.   I would like to go to Best Buy today and pick up that new Beatles CD while it's on sale (and while it has a bonus disc attached), I may not be able to afford it though.    I guess I'd better get off of here and start getting some of these things done. But first... I'm gonna go and hit that leftover pizza (the breakfast of champions).

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  I listened to a lot of tapes while I was working on my cards this week. I listened to tapes from Van Halen, Styx, Led Zeppelin, Lynyrd Skynyrd, REO Speedwagon and Styx.    Watching on TV:  I'm starting to get a daytime TV watching routine going. Usually, I'll just have the shows on while I'm doing other stuff. At 9am, if there's nothing better on, I watch Regis & Kelly (Kelly Ripa is much less annoying that Kathie Lee, who always kept me away from that show). At 10am I generally watch "The Ellen Degeneres Show", followed by "The People's Court". If there's nothing better on, I'll watch "Judge Mathis" (which is  almost  too stupid and annoying to watch), which is followed by another "People's Court". A few days this week I caught "The Kids In The Hall" and "Sarturday Night Live". In the evening, I watch "The Simpsons", "Everybody Loves Raymond", and "Seinfeld". I've missed "The Daily Show" and "Tough Crowd w/Colin Quinn" almost all week, but I managed to catch "Tough Crowd" last night.    Downloading:  I downloaded The Beatles "Let It Be... Naked" album and loved what I heard. Best Buy has it (plus a bonus disc) on sale this week for $11.99 and I hope to pick it up tomorrow. I downloaded a bunch of Beatles stuff, almost all later-period stuff, all from the "Anthology" sets. I don't have any Beatles CDs anymore, which is a crime, but I do have a few on tape. When I get working again, I plan on beefing up my CD collection.    Reading:  I started reading "The Return Of Sherlock Holmes" last week, but I haven't touched it at all this week. I usually read before I go to bed, but I don't want to screw up my sleep pattern (now that it's semi-normal) by reading in bed. I need to get used to reading during the day or early evening.    Jamming:  We practiced last night and it was rough as hell. I didn't play bad, but I kept forgetting parts to songs and I had a crappy tone going all night. The (Randall) amp in the room sounded like  shit . I've played that amp before and have always hated it. I was all juiced about playing last night too. I even asked the other guys about playing an hour longer (no one else wanted too).   I don't know what happened to me last night. It was like I suddenly got tired, mentally. I completely forgot the intro to "The Middle", and then I kept blowing "Wild Night", jumping into the solo section too soon... something I'd never done before.  We went through sets 1 and 3 this time and we jammed a bit at the beginning and in between, which was cool. I love jamming more than anything else, JP seems to like it too, but I'm not sure about the other guys (they seem to get bored with it). We jammed on that E9-A13 thing again (I'd come up with a new part for it yesterday) and I came up with a new riff (A-G-A w/trill) and we jammed on that awhile, partly with JP on harmonica. He rarely ever plays harmonica, so he's not very good on it.   I tried throwing out a few of the new songs I've been working on at home, but Al didn't jump in and JP just wasn't quick enough to pick up on what I was doing (it would have taken up too much time to show him), so I gave up on them. I really need to get my own band going on the side.   Working:  Looking in the paper, but I haven't filled out any applications yet. Monday, I hope to start.   Buying:  Nothing this week, but I would like to pick up that Beatles CD while it's on sale.   Selling:  I have no auctions running and still don't know what I'm going to list this week. Very frustrating.  When JP came by yesterday morning to drop off his equipment, he took a picture of my speaker cabinet (with his digital camera) and sent them to me from work later in the day. I made a flyer for it and put it up on the board at Circle. I asked $200 for it or else a combo amp in trade.    Eating:  I'm eating too much breakfast food: eggs, kielbasa, hash browns, toast. I'm eating less bread and cheese, no soda, no pudding, a lot more rice, more pork and chicken, but no veggies or fruit... I'm going in the right direction, but I'm still not there yet.    Feeling:    Mentally: I'm feeling a little more hopeful about the future, but I still have a lot of money worries.     Physically: I woke up a few minutes before my alarm went off this morning, with a terrible headache that hasn't gone away yet. I think my ears are causing the headaches, they hurt still. My sinuses are still a mess as well.   I think I've torn something in one of my calves too. I get charlie horses frequently and I think something happened during the last one (a week or two ago) because it just doesn't feel right anymore. It feels strained.     Planning:  I plan on being employed soon.

I would make my family and friends extremely wealthy, I would rid the world of most all weaponry (nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, tanks, warplanes, rockets, guns, etc..) and make it impossible for them to ever be created again, and I'd rid the world of all religions and make it impossible for them to ever be created again.    2. What would be the first 3 things you'd do for yourself?   Make myself 100% healthy, make myself incredibly wealthy, and give myself great wisdom.   3. What would be the first 3 things you'd do to your enemies?   If they abuse their power, they will be powerless.  If they abuse people, they will be isolated from all humankind.   If they are complete pricks, I will give them big bleeding hemorrhoids.

        A Good Start   Wow! I actually slept through the night  without having to get out of bed even once ! I can't even remember the last time that happened!  I went to bed at 11pm last night and was out of bed at 8:40am this morning. I took an Alavert before bedtime and I used Nasonex spray before I got into bed, I think that may have helped. I will have to do that again tonight.   JP dropped his equipment off this morning and took a picture of my 4x12 cabinet before heading to work. He's going to send me the pics so I can make a "for sale" ad to hang up at Circle. I'm going to try and get back what I have into it or else trade it for a good combo amp. I may have better luck with the latter.   I still have no idea what cards I'm listing on eBay this weekend. All of that work I've done this week was for nothing. I checked eBay's completed auctions for card lots and they ridiculously bad, lots worth $150 selling for $1, stuff like that. I think I'm going to make up "packs" to try and sell at the flea market or else put together a $0.25 bin. In the meantime, I still have to figure out what to list on eBay  this weekend . Man, I need a job.   Mom is off all next week, so she's going to help me look for one. Hopefully I will be employed before December. The sooner the better...

        A Little Relief   I called Jess and told him it'd probably be better if he came down next week instead. That pushes the flea market plans back a week as well, so now I have a little breathing room, not so rushed.  I wish I had a little relief for my headache. It was coming before, and now it has arrived. Ugh! My head and ears are screaming!

        Back To The Same Old   Yesterday was a pretty good day, today is not. I went to bed at Midnight last night but it took forever for me to fall asleep. My nose was stopped up and the Alavert just wasn't working for me at all. I tossed and turned a lot, got up to pee once or twice, and got very little sleep. By 7:15am, I had been lying awake in bed for awhile and it seemed clear to me that I wasn't be going back to sleep anytime soon. Since my alarm was set for 8:30am, I figured I might as well just get up.  I could've stayed in bed longer and tried to make-up the sleep, but I thought it'd be a mistake. I want to get a job soon and I have to be up in the mornings, not in the afternoons. The fact that I got up rather than sleep in is truly progress for me, and even though I'm tired, I'm much better off having gotten up.  Almost as soon as I was out of bed I started working on my cards (putting lots together to sell on eBay). I worked on them non-stop until about 12:45pm, when I decided to have lunch.   I'm worried that the lots I put up are going to tank on me. I've run out of really good cards to sell, now I'm down to lower-valued cards and it's a gamble listing them. In the last month, I've had over 140 auctions end without a bid. They cost me $0.35 per auction to list, so I've lost a lot of money on them, all single card auctions. Now I'm going to try listing 9-card lots, hopefully they will sell better, but there's no way of knowing how they'll do.   My ears are bothering me again (thanks to all my sinus problems). They hurt really bad, and to make matters worse, I'm on the verge of having a headache (I can feel it coming) on top of the ear pain. I'm not a happy camper.   The cats are irritating me too, Mainly Stevie. He tore up one of our lamp shades last night and he keeps getting into everything, and I'm having to constantly yell at him. Jimmy's being good, but he's always underfoot. They're not cooperating with me on taking their worm medicine though (they both have tapeworms... ick). It costs $25 for a bottle of worm pills, just three pills in all, so we can't afford to waste any of them. The cats won't swallow the pills whole, so I mixed one up with some tuna fish, and of course, neither will touch it. They keep bugging me because they're hungry but they have to eat the tuna/pill concoction before I feed them anything else. It's very frustrating.   I'm really pressed for time right now. That's not making me happy either. Tonight, I need to package a bunch of cards to be mailed, and I have to get whichever cards I'm putting up on eBay this weekend pulled, sorted, and ready to scan. Tomorrow I have band practice and I haven't even picked up my electric guitar since last week. On Friday, Jesse is due down, so I have to have all of the eBay cards scanned before then (I'll list them on Sunday night, after Jesse goes home). I also need to get stuff ready to go to the flea market Sunday morning. Ugh! I think I'm spreading myself too thin. Maybe I'll pass on the flea market this weekend.

        Tuesday Evening, Still Feeling Good   I like this... I'm finally getting things done. I've been working on my basketball cards for most of the day, pulling cards to put up on eBay this weekend and organizing them a little better. I hope to have everything I'm going to list this weekend pulled, scanned and ready to list by Friday afternoon. I'm planning on having my older nephew, Jesse, down this weekend and I want to make sure everything is done before he comes down so I can spend the weekend with him rather than screwing with that stuff then.   There are a couple things I'd like to do with him this weekend, one is perhaps going to see "School Of Rock", though I don't think it's playing anywhere around here anymore. I'll have to check on that. The other thing I'd like to do is set up a booth at the flea market this Sunday. Jesse said he was going to look for stuff to sell, maybe we can both make a little money and have fun spending it Sunday afternoon. I know he would love to go back to Celebration Station and ride go-karts again (so would I actually).  I've been rocking out while I'm working, listening to tapes by Van Halen and Rush. I don't know if I'll make any money selling tapes at the flea market this weekend, or if I'll ever get the money back that I put into them, regardless, it's nice having them around to listen to.

        Tuesday Morning, Feelin' Fine   I went to bed at 9:30pm last night, right after "Everybody Loves Raymond", and was out of bed again around 2am to take Alavert (my nose keeps getting stopped really bad it wakes me up) and to pee, but I was back in bed and sleeping before long. I think I was up to pee one more time during the night. I need to go back to not drinking anything after 8pm.  The next time I got up was when my alarm went off at 8:30am. I felt pretty good, not overly tired as usual, and got out of bed right away, which is a nice change.  My computer is still acting up. I went to turn it on and it immediately froze up, so I re-started it and then it wouldn't go online, so I turned it off and started it one more time before it finally worked right again. Windows Millenium is about the shittiest OS I've ever used.   I got paid overnight for the side deal I've been working on for a couple of weeks now, it's just $35, but it will help me out a great deal. At least I am in no danger of bouncing any of the checks I've written.   I still owe too much though. I owe my Mom $200 (on top of everything else I owe her), I owe JP $50 for the Crosby, Stills and Nash concert ticket (from over the summer), and I owe some guy named Paul another $25 for Ben Harper tickets (also from over the summer).   Ugh!  Aside from money problems and worries, I feel pretty good this morning.

         urlLink Monday Madness     1. Have you started your Christmas shopping yet? If not, when will you be starting?   No, I'm broke at the moment. I won't be shopping until I get a job or manage to sell some stuff on eBay.    2. What are your favorite holiday goodies (baked goods, etc.)?   Pecan, Key Lime, Pumpkin, Apple, Cherry, Blueberry, Coconut Cream, Banana Cream.... mmmm...pie (gurgle*drool*gurgle)   3. Do you decorate for Christmas? Inside, outside or both? When will you be putting your decorations up?   Since we don't have the kids down here for Christmas, we usually don't do much decorating except for a few inside decorations. I was thinking last night about surprising Mom with outside decorations, but I'm lazy and unless I get some help or have a huge burst of energy, it won't happen.

         urlLink Monday Mission       1. Do you ever sling slang from your area of expertise around accidentally and leave folks scratching their heads? Do you feel left out when others start speaking in terms specific to their industry? Gimme some examples   No, not really. I don't have a job at the moment, but I am a musician, though not a trained or schooled musician, and all of my terms are pretty basic: "chorus", "verse", solo", etc...  When others start speaking in strange terminology, I don't necessarily feel left out, in fact, I think I'd mostly feel frustrated that I lack the knowledge myself.    2. My hotel room this past weekend was on the 8th floor. I rode the elevator a LOT. There is a lot of unspoken elevator etiquette, you know? Here are some of my observations (this is freestyle here - add to them or just tell me what you think) When to hold the door, when to let it shut. Do you put your hand in to re-open it if you are too late to get in? Do you hit the "open" button if you see someone running to the door? Do you press the numbers for everyone? Where do you look as you are going to your floor when you are in there with someone you don't know?...   Whoa... hold on there brother! Too many elevator questions! I don't ride elevators very often, but when I do, I am polite and act as I would anywhere else. If I see someone trying to catch the elevator, of course I'll hold it for them and if I'm near the buttons and someone asks me to select their floor, I select the floor. I think most all of us look forward in elevators, unless of course there is a window, then I usually look out the window.    3. How do you make it through a boring conversation or meeting when you are feeling drowsy?   Cocaine.   Seriously though, sheer willpower alone. I had a boss who was fond of hearing his own voice (methinks) and his meetings would be long, boring, grueling, affairs. They were especially bad on those days when I'd come in early for OT.    4. Do you enjoy flying on commercial airlines? Ever flown First Class?   I haven't flown since I was 12, about 22 years. I think it was first class, because I remember listening to Bill Cosby on headphones that plugged into my seat and I believe I had ample room, but I'm really not sure since it's been so long ago.   At this point, being a fat guy, I think I'd  have to  fly first class just to be comfortable. Coach seats are made for normal-sized folks. Apparently, the airlines don't understand (or don't care) that fat folks need to travel every bit as much as normal-sized folks. They should make accomodations for fat people so they, and the people next to them, aren't uncomfortable.   5. When I book my airfare, I always try to book an aisle seat on the left by the exit doors. That way you have more legroom, and being a "righty" I am able to move my arm and elbow without jabbing someone's belly. When you fly, where do you like to sit?   The window. I'm a little afraid of heights, but looking down at the Earth below, from the sky above... it lends a different perspective on life that you don't get on the ground.     6. Have you ever jumped to conclusions and griped someone out, then later learned you didn't have all the facts? Or had it happen to you? What was the real story?   I know that, yes, that has happened to me, and probably more than once, but I can't recall any specific arguments right now.    7. Do you have any techno-lust going on?   I want a brand new Dell, fully loaded. I want a CD burner, a DVD drive, an MP3 player, a larger monitor, better speakers, and I want a portable PC. I need to win the lottery.   BONUS: Where do you go, my lovely?   Gollum, is that you?

        Too-Early Riser   I'd been working almost all day on my cards and tapes, trying to figure out what to list on eBay, but managed to get no auctions listed. I got tired pretty early on, and was in bed around 9:30pm. I was really sleepy, but it took a long time to fall asleep.   Around 3:30am, I was up and out of bed again. My sinuses were stopped up and I had trouble breathing. I went out to take some Alavert and to get a check ready for Mom to deposit (she said she was stopping at the bank in the morning). I'd forgotten to do it before I went to bed last night and went I went to sign the check, I couldn't find it. I looked all over the place and was getting pretty frustrated. I had to go through a box of papers twice, one paper at a time, before I finally found it. By then, I was wide awake. I re-heated some chili and rice and ate a 4:30am "breakfast".   I tried watching Eddie Izzard on HBO (again!), but several of our HBO channels are screwed up, including the one Izzard special was on, so I called to have someone come out to fix it. They will be out tomorrow afternoon.   I played around on the PC, played with the cats for a while, and then watched "All In The Family" and "the Andy Griffith Show".   I'm tired.   I'd go back to bed if it weren't the time of day I  should  be getting up. I don't want to go back to getting up late in the afternoon, that'd be taking a step backwards. I guess I'll just struggle/straggle through the day.   I wanted to get some auctions listed today and tomorrow, but I might have to do it all tomorrow if I can't stay up long enough to do it today. I need to stay up until 9 or 10pm at least.  Yet another wonderful start I'm off to this week...

        Short-Lived Sleep   I went to bed shortly after my last post, around 7:15pm, and woke up around 9:30pm thinking I'd slept for many, many hours. Very strange. I got up to pee twice throughout the night, and now, I'm up, out of bed. I've been out of bed since about 2:15am. I think I slept about 4 or 5 hours altogether. I'm going to go back to bed in a bit and try to sleep until 8 or 9am. Like I've asked many times before, why does everything have to be so difficult for me? Even something as simple and basic as sleep. Grrrrrr!!!!

        Sleepiness   I've been tired all day, but I'm  really  feeling tired right now. I think I'll be going to bed soon, probably by 8pm (maybe sooner).   I'm a mess. Either I can't sleep at all or all I do is sleep, no middleground.  Maybe it's the nice cool weather, good sleeping weather, I don't know, but whatever it is, going to bed at 8pm is about as bad as going to bed at 8am. It's still off from where I need to be. I want to be going to bed around 11pm-Midnight so I can be up around 8-9am. If I get into the habit of going to bed at 8pm, I will be up around 4-5am and that just plain sucks, screws up my Sunday eBay listing night and screws up my band practice night, where I'm playing until 10pm.   Why does everything have to be so difficult for me? Sheesh.

        Sleep... At Last!   The bug lady didn't come until late in the afternoon, so I sat out here all day for nothing. I wanted to clean my room, but if the bug lady came to the door and I didn't hear her, Mom would've been charged $44 for the missed visit. I sat in front of the PC almost all day.   The bug lady, Annette, said Mom had termite droppings in the window sill in her room. Nice. Just what we need.   I eventually sat on the couch and watched TV for awhile. There was a documentary on Sitting Bull and the Sioux indians on that I wanted to watch (it covered a lot of the things from the book I'd recently finished).   By 6:45pm, before the documentary was over, I was falling asleep on the couch. I just couldn't stay awake. I'd wanted to stay up until 9 or 10pm, but I finally said "screw it" and went on to bed at 7pm.   I hadn't eaten supper or anything. I was completely exausted.    I didn't fall asleep right away, but I did soon enough. I slept until almost 5am, when I had to get up to pee. I went back to bed, but didn't fall asleep right away. I did eventually though, and I stayed in bed until a little after 10am. I probably could've stayed in bed even longer, but I wanted to get up before it got too late.    I got up and struggled with my computer for a half an hour trying to get online. I was getting pissed. The cable modem says I had a connection, but the computer couldn't access it. Usually I just have to re-start the PC and/or unplug the modem for a minute and it'll work again,. but not today. I must've started and re-started the PC about 10 times and unplugged the modem about 4 or 5 times. The PC froze up on me twice as well. Very frustrating start to my day.   After it started working again (I let it sit for a few minutes before I tried going online), I checked my email and, luckily, had received a payment for some auctions overnight. It was just $13.50, but every little bit helps. I sent out a check to Gateway for $80 yesterday and only I only have about $35 in my checking account right now. I figure I'll be about $10 short, unless I get some more in over the weekend. I can borrow $10 from Mom if I need to, so I'll be OK.  After I got online, I found out that two eBay auctions I was watching, for 2 sealed Jimi Hendrix import CDs, ended overnight for just $0.99 each. I never got to bid on them. That didn't make me happy.   Mom made some chick coffee for us this morning, Chocolate Cake flavored (which pretty much sucked), and I ate chicken, rice, and carrots, what Mom made for dinner last night, for breakfast. Very unusual breakfast for me. While re-heating it all, I managed to spill sauce/juice from the chicken and carrots all over the kitchen floor and I spilled my coffee on the counter.   This day is off to a very rocky start, very up-and-down.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  Nothing lately.   Watching on TV:  CNN, Ellen Degeneres' daytime talk show, "Columbo", "All In The Family", "Everybody Loves Raymond", "The Daily Show", and "Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn". I sat through another mind-numbing "Regis and Kelly" today... ugh! I really hate daytime TV.   Downloading:  I downloaded a Seinfeld episode I don't know if I've seen or not, "The Puerto Rican Day", which is supposedly not in syndication. I haven't watched it yet. I also downloaded a Boz Scaggs & Duane Allman track I'd not heard before ("Loan Me A Dime").    Reading:  I'm currently reading "The Return Of Sherlock Holmes". I got through about 1/8 of it. Just haven't been in the reading mood lately though, what with my sleep troubles getting worse and all.    Jamming:  We practiced last night (see 2 entries below). It was an enjoyable practice, but a rough one for me.    Working:  I'm keeping an eye peeled, but until I get my sleep problem under control, I don't see how I can take a job. At this point, I think I'd just fuck it up if I got one; calling in sick, oversleeping, or whatever.    Buying:  Last night I won a 6-cassette lot on eBay for $3.06. I mainly wanted it for the remastered Led Zeppelin "Houses Of The Holy" tape and the Lynyrd Skynyrd "Pronounced Leh-Nerd Skin-Nerd" tape. The other four are REO Speedwagon "The Hits",  Van Halen "5150" & "OU812", and Def Leppard "Hysteria".   I also bought Bruce Springsteen's "The Essential Bruce Springsteen" (limited 3-cd set) on Wednesday night.     Selling:  I got up too late to list last Sunday, so I have nothing running at the moment. I'm currently trying to figure what to list this weekend.    Eating:  Less bread and cheese this week, but more eggs, hash browns, bacon, and kielbasa; still not eating very healthy. Plus, on my niece's birthday, I had a steak and cheese sub and cheesecake, so that's not very good either. On the plus side, I have been eating more chicken, pork and rice and drinking less soda than last week and more water too.    Feeling:  Mentally: Anguished.  Physically: I feel like I'm walking in my sleep.    Planning:  Nothing.

        Screwed Once Again   Well, I  thought  I was finally going to sleep well last night, but I guess I should've known better. I went to bed at 12:30am, and it took a long while for me to fall asleep. I was awake again by 6:30am. I've been up since. If I'm lucky, I got 4 or 5 hours sleep, but the way I feel, I don't know that I even got that much.   *sigh*  I think part of the problem was that it was too darn cold in here, about 60 degrees, plus I had my box fan blowing on me. On top of that, one of my sheets kept pulling off my feet and it kept annoying me while I tried to sleep. I need to look and see if we have a longer blanket somewhere in the house.   The bug lady (our exterminator) is due here today. I guess I should put some pants on.   *sigh*

        Band Practice   Tonight wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. My playing was up and down, some really good, some really bad. I forgot some of my parts and had to refresh my memory as I played. The other guys were about the same, hit and miss. Two and a half weeks was too long a layoff.   We ran through sets 3 and then 2, plus we jammed a bit as well. Al had a bluesy bass line that we jammed around a bit and then later, I came up with a little E9-A13 thing and we jammed on that a bit. For that one, Al played drums, JP played bass and Jimmy played something or other on the guitar (I couldn't really hear what he played), it sounded really, really good.    After practice, we hung out and talked a bit. We're looking to play out early December now. Al's talking about bringing in a new bass player, allowing Al to switch back to guitar again. I don't like that idea much myself. Playing with a second guitarist limits me a lot and I likes to have my freedom on the guitar.   I'm dead tired now. I feel like shit still. I haven't eaten anything since breakfast this morning, so that's not making me feel any better. I think I'm to grab a bite to eat, watch "Tough Crowd", and hit the sack. Hopefully, I've suffered enough today and sleep will come easy. We shall see.

        Thursday... Still Sucking   I watched TV a little and messed around on the PC a bit, trying to stay awake. I even did an online mental health screening. Not surprising, it says I have "clinical depression". I can't afford medicine for it or even afford to go to the doctor's office in the first place, so a big fat whoopity-doo good it does to know that.   The "Columbo" on today was one I'd seen a couple of times, so I decided to try and take my nap then, at 1pm. I was back out of bed in an hour or so, not having slept at all.   I played guitar a little, went to the bathroom, and then tried to sleep again. Still, no sleep for Gary, not for a long time anyway. I finally fell asleep around 5:30pm after I got up and re-set my alarm clock for th 3rd or 4th time today (constantly making it later and later). I slept til about 6pm.   I'm up now, dressed and waiting for JP to pick me up for band practice. I don't think I'm going to play very well tonight. I feel like shit.

        Thursday ... So Far   I slept like shit. I went to bed before 1am and by 4:45am, I was lying in bed, awake. My upset stomach had returned, so I spent some time in the bathroom with the big D. Afterward, I returned to bed and tried to sleep, but by 7am, I was still wide awake. Ttired as hell, but wide awake. I finally had enough and got up. I cooked breakfast for Mom and I again (eggs & kielbasa, coffee).   Mom left for work and a few minutes later, while I was sitting at the PC in my underwear, JP came in. I forgot all about him. He usually drops his equipment off here on practice days. I ran back and threw some pants on and talked to him for a few minutes before he split for work. He gave me a box of cassette tapes that someone gave him. Nothing great, most stuff I'd never listen to, but there are a few I'd like to hear (War, Joe Jackson, Squeeze).   I don't know I'm going to make it through the day. I am beat. I need sleep badly, but I can't go to bed for more than a nap or else I'll screw up my sleep schedule even worse than it already is. Ugh! I'm so sick of all of that shit. Why can't I sleep like a normal person?

        Wednesday... Continued   I didn't take a nap until later in the afternoon (2:30-4:30). Instead, I laid on the couch and watched TV for most of the morning/afternoon. I can't remember what all I watched (how sad is that?), but I know I watched Ellen Degeneres' show and "Columbo". I got off the couch long enough to practice guitar (for an hour or so) in between those shows.    I got out of bed from my nap around 5pm (I laid in bed listening to the radio/alarm for a while) and took a shower. Mom and I left for my sister's house at 5:30pm, for my niece's 16th birthday, getting there about an hour later.     Mom dropped me off and ran to Publix, so I went in alone... and was sorry I did. I was ready to leave 10 minutes after arriving. They were so goddamned rude it was shameful.   I walked in the door and saw that my brother-in-law (Danny), my older nephew (Jesse), my niece (Dana), and her boyfriend (Ricky) were watching a movie while some lady I'd never seen before was working on Dana's computer with my younger nephew (Austin) under her feet.  Danny looked up at me and went back to watching the movie, as did Jesse... no "Hi Gary", no "Hello", no nothing. Dana finally looked over and told me to come over and sit down on the couch, but by then I wasn't comfortable after that warm welcome and I wasn't comfortable with the lovely movie they had on. The movie they were watching was definitely not a kids movie. Everything was "fuck this", "fuck that", "fuck you", "fuck, fuck, fucking, fuck"... and then there was the wonderful violence... great stuff for a 11 old to be watching, even better for a 6 year old. I couldn't believe Danny had that on in front of the boys and I couldn't believe they were all watching that while they had company there that they were completely ignoring.   It turns out that the lady that was there, Jen, is the girlfriend of Danny's brother, Doug, and she was trying to help Dana get her new computer online (Dana's other Grandmother gave her her old one). She was on the phone trying to talk to tech support people, struggling to hear or be heard over the blasting volume of the TV set (she had to go out of the room several times just to hear the person on the phone), and running back and forth from one computer to the other. It was embarrassing to me, the selfishness, rudeness, and inconsideration of my family. I walked out and sat out front and waited for my Mom to come back. I was ready to go home.    Danny came outside a few minutes later (he had a phone call himself and had to go outside to hear), saw me out there, and a few minutes after that, the boys came outside to see me. Jesse said he had enough of that movie, which I knew was a lie. I said "your Dad told you to come out here, didn't he?", and they said "yeah". I told him that as soon as he had company, he should have been done with the movie. I told him how rude he was, how rude they all were, and that I was planning on going home. I don't know if he understood or not, but Austin seemed to understand that they shouldn't be watching movies like the one their dad had on.   My Mom came back a few minutes later and I told her what happened and that I was ready to go. She went on inside anyway and a few minutes later, I went back in myself.  I guess Dana knew enough to take my Mom to her room, away from that movie. I went in with them and reamed Dana out a bit. She said she didn't ask Jen to work on her computer so she didn't feel compelled to help or anything. Nice. What a great attitude. I had just got done talking to her about that last week and I thought she understood that when someone goes out of their way to do something nice for her, she should be appreciative of it. But that's how it is with them, they have more than they should, never had to work for any of it, so they appreciate nothing. They value nothing. It's sad and terrible.   While the boys looked for their football, I tried to help Jen with the PC. Unfortunately, Dana's computer doesn't appear to have a modem and she has no start up discs for the PC nor for her MSN internet access. At this point, the only way she's getting online is to hook up her old PC. Jen, was nice to work on the PC for Dana, and I was embarrassed that she was ignored while she tried to do my niece a favor. She seems like a nice person, it's too bad she's hooked up with Doug, he's not a very good guy (he's an alcoholic, he beat his last girlfriend, and he steals from family members). On her way out, she kissed me goodbye, which surprised the hell out of me. Apparently she kisses everyone goodbye, a little peck on the cheek, but it caught me completely off guard. It was strange, but endearing (if that makes any sense).  By then, my sister was home and was in a lovely mood. She ordered subs for us and Danny was going to pick up the subs while he wa out (he'd already left to run an errand). I took the boys ouside and played "Capture The Flag" with them for awhile (me and Austin vs. Jess). They had fun. I went in to get Dana and Ricky to play with us, but only Ricky would play. Austin went over to Ricky's team and after they lost a couple times, he started getting mad and wanted to go back to my team. After a bit, we all went back in and before long we were chowing on steak and cheese subs.   After a half-assed singing of "Happy Birthday", Dana opened her cards, collected her loot (I gave her $15, Mom gave her $30) and then we had some of her birthday cheesecake (yum!).  My sister hardly said anything all night, very grouchy. She yelled at Jesse a lot though. He asks for it a lot, but she's also more ready to jump on him than on the other two kids. She's just not much fun anymore. That's not saying I blame her, I'd be unhappy if I were in her shoes too.  Mom and I left around 10pm, after Dana went to bed (where I tickled her feet mercilessly) and we stopped off at the new Super Target on the way home. I picked up the new Bruce Springsteen "Essential" 3-CD set that was on sale for $16. It's going to be a 2-CD set, but the first pressings feature a 3rd, limited edition bonus disc of rarities. Mom was going to put it on her Target card so I didn't have to pay for it right now (while I'm very short on funds), but her card was rejected, so I have to pay for it now.   After we got home, I got my eBay mailings packaged and ready for Thursday's mail and was in bed around 12:40am. I wasn't feeling to well. I had a killer headache, my ears were bothering me and I was extremely tired.

        Wednesday... So Far   I finally went to bed yesterday afternoon a little after 5pm. I'd spent yesterday sitting if front of the PC, playing guitar in my room, and watching "Columbo". I slept for most of the night but I did wake up several times throughout the night (got up at one point to pee, then had to turn off the lights out front and lock the door). I finally got up around 5am this morning. I took out the trash, did some work on the PC, and then cooked breakfast for me and Mom (eggs, bacon, hash browns). I feel very tired still, though I don't understand why. I may go take a nap in a few minutes, the urge is overwhelming.   It's my niece's birthday today, we're planning on going up tonight.

        Awake Still   I tried going to bed around 5am, I was tired and felt like sleeping. Two hours later, I was up again, not having slept a wink. It's like I forgot how to fall sleep. I just can't sleep anymore, at least not when I need to or want to. It's really getting frustrating.   Before I went to bed, I worked in my room for an hour cleaning. It looks better than it did before, but I still have more to do.   After I gave up on sleeping, I reads a few more Sherlock Holmes stories in bed. Both of the cats slept on my bed while I read, which is rare (usually it's just Stevie). They looked cute. Jimmy was stretched out along the side of the bed and Stevie was snuggled up to him, resting his head against Jimmy's chest.   I have no idea how I'm going to be able to stay up all day (so I can go to bed at a decent time). I'm really tired and there ain't jack on TV worth watching. How bad is it? I actually sat through a Kathie Lee Gifford interview... that's just how shitty it is. I finally put CNN on, still... I don't know how I'm going to stay up all day.

        Still Struggling   Well I  tried  to get to sleep at a decent hour last night.   I laid down on the couch around 2am with the front window open and the cool breeze coming through and I tried to sleep. Unfortunately, my lungs are still super-congested and my wheezing started driving me nuts. I began coughing a lot, trying to clear my lungs and at one point, I coughed and nearly shit myself. My upset stomach had returned and I had to run to the bathroom. I returned to the couch and tried to sleep again, but no luck. Except for the bathroom break, I spent three hours on the couch and got no sleep at all. Three hours of wasted time.   I finally got up and went to my room and tried sleeping there, but it took a long time before I finally fell asleep. In fact, the sun had been out for a while before I finally drifted off.   I woke up around 5pm and got out of bed around 6pm, feeling like I could've stayed in bed for another couple of hours.  Since I've been up, I ate supper, watched back-to-back "Everybody Loves Raymond" episodes and then played guitar for an hour or so. I recorded some new riffs that I've come up with recently. I was really excited about the new songs. I wish I had a band here to play them with and see how they'll sound with drums and bass behind them.  Speaking of bands, JP called me tonight (I was just thinking about calling him at the time) and we talked about the band a little. We're playing this Thursday at Circle. He said he'd try to come over early to go over some music with me (my new riffs), but I've learned not to count on that (something always comes up).    Currently, I'm watching a new "Everybody Loves Raymond" episode on CBS and am thinking about cleaning my room after it's over. There may be some basketball on though, need to check into that.

        Sunday   Sunday has been about as rotten as the previous few days. I got up around 7pm tonight. I think I spent about 14 hours in bed. I tried to get to sleep around 3 or 4am, but I had great difficulty falling alseep, and didn't actually get to sleep until long after sunrise.   Shortly after I finally fell asleep, I was woken up by an upset stomach. I was having bad stomach pains and it kept me up until it finally settled down again. My sleep was pretty much off and on the whole time, not steady.   I was hoping to have been up around Noon today, now my week is screwed again. I am still trying to be arrange my sleep schedule to get up at 9am and go to sleep at Midnight so I can get a job, which I despearately need, but my mind and body aren't working together to make it happen. There have been days where I haven't gone to bed at all and when I finally lay down to sleep the next night, I still can't sleep. It's torture.   Because I slept so late, I didn't get any new auctions up tonight. Not good. I did send out invoices for all of this week's winners and got a bunch of packages ready to mail. We should've mailed them today, over in Tampa, but I got up too late. I also changed the cat litter, swept the kitchen floor and took the trash out.   I'm not a happy camper right thanks to my sleep difficulties, but I am loving the wonderful weather right now. It's 68 degrees out and the winds are around 17 MPH. It is almost 2am and I have the front door and several windows open and am enjoying the cool breeze. Very nice. It's actually pretty quiet on the road tonight and the neighborhood is quiet as well... quite peaceful.   Hmmm... I'm thinking it might be a good time to try and sleep.

        Friday/Saturday   The last two days have been a mess: odd sleep hours, continued sleep problems, and continued ear and sinus problems. I can't even distinguish one day from the other really.   It wasn't a total mess though, I did manage to get a few things done. I did 3 or 4 loads of laundry  (I even bleached my whites), I used the toilet brush on my toilet (still need more scrubbing), I flipped my matttress and brought in a comforter (much more comfortable), and I finished the book I started "Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee" (this book should be mandatory reading in every school) and I started a new one: "The Return Of Sherlock Holmes" by Arthur Conan Doyle.  I stayed up until 1pm today, but I only slept until 7:30pm; not quite enough sleep for me. I probably could've slept longer but it was too cold in my room. I had hoped to sleep past Midnight.   Mom went up to my sister's this morning to watch my nephew's last football game of the year (sadly, I still haven't seen a single game yet) and just got home about half an hour ago. She brought me back cheeseburgers from McDonalds, my traditional "sick food".   I don't feel well, but I don't really feel sick either, just... "blah".   I was really tempted to order pizza and wings tonight, I was jonesing bad, but I didn't really want to spend money I don't have on food that I don't really need.   I have a lot to do tomorrow: pulling, listing and scanning cards for eBay, getting my mailings ready for Monday's mail (or even Sunday's if Mom feels like going over to Tampa). I wanted to clean my room this weekend, but I don't know if I'll have the time. It's a freaking mess. Hell, the whole house needs a good cleaning actually.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  Due to my earache, I really haven't been listening to music lately. However, I did play the Jimi Hendrix Reference Library tape ("Rhythm") I got in the other day, but it wasn't what I'd expected. I thought it was going to be an in depth lesson about Jimi's rhythm playing (hoping to pick up some tips from the master) but it was just a bunch of song snippets. The booklet was about useless.    Watching on TV:  "The Simpsons", "Home Improvement", "Everybody Loves Raymond" and "King Of Queens" (I'd never seen this sitcom before... it was ok) in the evening and "The Daily Show" and "Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn" later at night.  During "primetime", I watched "Fear Factor" one night and have had NBA basketball on the the rest of the time. Sometimes I'll sit and watch a whole game, but sometimes I'll just have it on while I'm on the PC or doing something else.   Downloading:  I downloaded a killer song I heard on the last SNL by the band Outkast, it's called "Hey Ya". Very cool song.   Reading:  I started reading "Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee" (by Dee Brown) this morning and read for about 4 or 5 hours, until around 1pm before I finally tried to go to sleep. Great book so far. I don't think most Americans understand how truly badly the US behaved towards the Native Americans, how brutal and ruthless we were to them. I've long known how evil (sorry, there just isn't a better word for it) the US Government was, so most of what I'm reading isn't new to me. However, some of the particular atrocities are... very disturbing stuff.    Jamming:  No practice this week. Jimmy cancelled and then the other guys were going to come over here tonight, but I backed out of it. Next week we practice again, we'd better. I need to practice at home in the meantime, but as of yet, I haven't (my ears again).       Working:  Looking in the paper, but not filling out any applications yet.   Buying:  I won that Hendrix Reference Library cassette last week, paid $5.25 (including shipping). I thought it was new and sealed, but after I looked at the auction real well (after I'd already won it), I realized it probably wasn't.   Selling:  I have a lot of auctions up and in my eBay store (almost 200 cards), but they really aren't doing jack. Very disappointing.    Eating:  Mom keeps buying sandwich stuff so I'm eating too much bread and too much cheese still. I'm also not eating fruits and veggies much either and I'm drinking soda more than I have been... all not good.     Feeling:  Mentally: Still very frustrated that I can't get my shit together. I feel helpless.   Physically: My head is a bit stuffed up, but not as bad as before. I found some nasal spray and that seems to be helping. My ears aren't as bad it seems, but I still am getting sharp pains in them every now and again. My headache has gone away, but it feels like it hasn't gone far away, that it could come back at any moment.    Planning:  Still trying to get my shit together.

         urlLink 3 for Thursday     If you won a million dollars...    1. What are the first 3 things you'd buy?   1. My own home. 2. A brand new car for my mom and one for myself.  3. Guitar gear (2 new Fender Strats, a Gibson SG, a digital recorder, and a Marshall stack).   2. What are 3 things you'd do?   1. Get me, my mom, and my sister out of debt. 2. Travel (I'd love to have my own RV and just hit the road).  3. Get my own band started.   3. What are 3 charities or people you'd give some of the money to?    A million dollars doesn't go as far as it used to, so I don't know that I'd be charitable to anyone by myself and my family and possibly my friends. I'd make sure my niece and nephews had tuition money available and I'd get all of us out of debt, I'd buy my mom a nice new car, and I'd try to make whatever is left last me as long as possible, so I doubt there'd be anything left over for charity.

        Books Read Mid-Late 2002   Because I can't sleep and because I was curious, I went through my blog archives and compiled a list of the books I'd read in the latter half of 2002. It's probably not 100% accurate, but so what.   "Slaughterhouse Five" by Kurt Vonnegut Jr. "Jailbird" by Kurt Vonnegut Jr. "All The President's Men" by Woodward & Bernstein   "The Silence Of The Lambs" by Thomas Harris  "Hannibal" by Thomas Harris "The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle "The Strange Case Of Dr.Jekyll And Mr.Hyde" by Robert Louis Stevenson "Chickenhawk" by Robert Mason "In Contempt" by Christopher Darden  "Don't Stand Too Close To A Naked Man" by Tim Allen "Man Of Honor" by Joseph Bonanno "A Study In Scarlet" by Sir Athur Conan Doyle "The Hound Of The Baskervilles" by Sir Athur Conan Doyle "Groucho and Me" by Groucho Marx "Memoirs Of A Mangy Lover" by Groucho Marx "The Groucho Letters: Letters From and To Groucho Marx" by Groucho Marx "The Witching Hour" by Anne Rice "The Vampire Lestat" by Anne Rice "Cavett" by Dick Cavett "Animal Farm" by George Orwell  Somewhere between Tim Allen's book and the Groucho Marx books I read Stephen King's "Nightmares and Dreamscapes". I went through a period late in the year where I blogged very infrequently.  The following books are books that I know I read during the early part of the year, but I'm not sure in what order:  "Drive" by Larry Bird "Coriolanus" by William Shakespeare "Othello" by William Shakespeare "King Lear" by William Shakespeare "Interview With The Vampire" by Anne Rice "Thinner" by Stephen King "The Dark Half" by Stephen King "Pet Sematary" by Stephen King "Salem's Lot" by Stephen King "A Confederacy Of Dunces" by John Kennedy Toole "Catch-22" by Joseph Heller "Something Happened" by Joseph Heller  It looks like I did a lot more reading last year, which is odd to me because I have more spare time this year (as I quit my job earlier this year).

         urlLink 3 for Thursday  (from last week)     Getting in Trouble    1. What are 3 things you did growing up that you always got in trouble for, never learning your lesson?   Being the class clown, or, as the teachers would call it, "disrupting class". I got laughs, so I always went back for more. I couldn't help it.   In my circle of friends, the other kids usually would follow my lead and I was always finding fun stuff (also known as "trouble") for us to get into. To me, I was just being a kid and doing what kids do, but to parents, I was always being an "instigator".  Staying up too late and missing the bus/school. During Middle School and High School I was very bad in this way. I used to stay up until 1:30am every weeknight watching "Late Night with David Letterman" (which was a must for me), even though I wasn't allowed to be up that late and was constantly being yelled at for it. Because I'd stayed up so late, I'd often sleep through my alarm, sleep through Mom yelling at me to get up (sometimes pouring water on me or beating me with a clothes hanger), and would then miss my bus and often miss school altogether, but I usually showed up around second or third period. I got in big trouble over truancy, but I just had to watch Letterman. It was a revelation to me, fresh and inventive, brilliant and silly, totally inspirational stuff to me.    2. What are 3 things you did growing up that you did learn your lesson and never did again?   Shoplifting. Drinking to excess. Getting tattooed.   3. What are 3 things you did growing up that you never got caught or in trouble for?   Wow. There's really too much there to list. I was a very naughty teenager. Drunken parties, more shoplifting, smoked weed, turn-out-the-light groping sessions... you name it, short of rape or murder, I probably did it.    Bonus: Share a story of something funny or terrible you did growing up.   I think I've told the "dog-crap-on-the-trailer story" enough, so let me think here... hmmm... well, believe it or not, but I have another dog crap story I can tell (you lucky reader you)!   I must have been around 11 or 12 at the time, and I was across the street with my friend Eric (he was my "last resort" friend: ok if no one else was around) and we were throwing the football around in his yard. Behind his house lived Jenny, a friend of my sister's who I was always really mean to. I used to call her "Piglet" and torment her endlessly.   I have no idea why I did that now. She's actually pretty cool, and was always pretty cute. I guess I didn't know anything about love and romance then, so I picked on her mercilessly instead.  Anyway, Eric had a very large dog at the time and there were piles of dog shit all over the yard, so when I saw Jenny coming I rubbed the ball in a pile of shit and booted it toward her... a direct hit! She just stood there, mouth agape, completely shocked. So, being the wonderful kid I was, I grabbed a stick and dipped it in a pile of poo and chased her home with it. She ran home screaming and Eric and I laughed our asses off.   The end.  I suppose that probably wasn't a very good story to tell about myself, kind of makes me look like an asshole, but it does lead me into yet another dog crap story (a third one... imagine that)!  Shortly after that incident, another friend of mine, Greg, came over and we told him about Jenny and the football and the poo-stick. Much like yourself, he didn't think it was very funny, so he made his own poo-stick and chased me and Eric into Eric's house with it. At some point, he actually chucked a dog turd at me and it hit me (i think it was fairly dry), which pissed me off so bad I ran after him; I was dead set on beating his ass. I chased him over to a neighbor's yard and he hid behind their pick-up truck and I went around that truck repeatedly trying to catch him. Finally I got so mad, so frustrated, that I  picked up the truck ! I lifted it clean off the ground. I think he uttered "Holy shit!", and then he ran straight home.   The end.   I didn't think I'd actually lifted the truck up off the ground, but he swears to this day that I did. I guess that just shows how powerful Adrenaline can be.   You know, that story really didn't do anything to make me look like less of an asshole. However, I  did  get hit with a dog turd and I  didn't  beat anyone's ass, Jenny is happily married, and I'm a miserable fat bastard.   Score one for Karma.

        Wednesday   I was back in bed at 4:30am, but it took awhile for me to fall asleep. My sinuses/allergies were really, really bad. I slept until about 3:40pm and woke up feeling terrible still. My head aches and is all stuffed up still.   I think I'm going to back out of jamming tomorrow. I really don't feel much like cleaning the house right now and my head hurts too much.   I am getting pissed with my sister again. She asks us to do a favor for her and watch the kids for her but she can't even give us a definite answer as to where and when. Are we going up Frday night? Saturday morning? Are we watching them on Sunday too? At this point, I have no idea. I hate waiting until the last minute to know what my plans are going to be, especially when it's already an inconveniece to me. I usually get my mailing ready on Friday night or Saturday morning and mail everything out on Saturday afternoon, but I won't be able to do that this week... or will I? Grrrr!!!    There are a bunch of basketball games on tonight, but I don't know if I'm going to stay up or not. The way I feel right now, going to bed with a book sounds like a pretty darn good idea.

        Tuesday Night   I finally got things together a bit tonight and took care of all of my eBay mailings and even scanned and listed about 40 more auctions tonight. I finished up in time to watch "The Daily Show" and "Tough Crowd", and then I went to bed.   That was at Midnight.   While in bed, I finished reading "Dracula" (definitely a classic, a great book) sometime around 1:30am and then shut out the lights. For the next two hours, I tossed and turned, adjusted and re-adjusted my pillows and blankets, turned the fan on, turned it up a little more... I just could not get comfortable. Then, my sinuses kicked in and it got to be too much. That's why I'm up now. I took an Alavert before I went to bed, it should last 24 hours, but it ain't doing shit. I took another one a few minutes ago, hopefully that's enough to get me breathing ok again. Sleep may even follow, who knows?  Oh! I talked to JP today. He asked me if it was cool if him and Al came over on Thursday to practice here (I told him I'd let him know... I'm still not feeling great and the house is trashed) and also about going to Al's party on Saturday. I told him I just can't afford to buy beer right now (it's a imported beer party, you have to bring six different kinds). He offered to buy some for me, which was nice of him to do, but I declined. I don't want to owe anyone more than I already do, besides, I rembered that I'm supposed to help watch my niece and nephews this weekend.   Mom said we'd probably have to spend the night there one night. Luckily Danny, my brother-in-law will be gone so I won't have to worry about him smoking. I reek of smoke everytime I come home from there and the kids always smell like nasty smoke when they come down to visit. Very nasty, selfish habit. I can hardly believe that, when I was younger, I used to smoke a pack a day (Marlboro 100's). Ick.

        Wasted Time, Continued...   I went to bed around 4am and read "Dracula" until sometime around 11am. Time pretty much flew by. I had both cats in bed with me (a rarity), so when I tried to sleep, I really couldn't because I was semi-concious of the cats at all times (so as not to roll over on them). By 2:30pm I was out of bed, having barely slept.   Great.   I feel crappy still, plus now I have a backache (from laying in bed funny) and an upset stomach (from lack of sleep) to go along with everything else. I wanted to get some more scanning and listing done today, but I don't feel like doing anything now. Looks like another wasted day...

        Still Not Well   I got up around 2:45pm today, after sleeping through my alarm (went off from 11am-12pm) and a rainstorm. I only stayed up a few hours before I went back to bed again (around 5pm). I read for a while before crashing. I stayed down until after Midnight.   My head feels like it weighs 500 pounds. My sinuses are still stuffed up, my lungs are still congested, my ears are still sore, and I still have a headache that won't go away. Of course, I don't have insurance and I can't afford to see a doctor.   Wonderfulness.  I have got to get busy and get some money coming in. There wasn't anything suitable in the Sunday paper employment section this week. I'm looking, but I have got to get out of the house and fill out some applications.  I need to play some guitar as well. I haven't practiced guitar for at least a week. It doesn't take long to get rusty.   I guess I'm going to head to bed again in a few minutes, hopefully I will be up before Noon so I can get something done. Too many days are just wasted time.

         urlLink Monday Madness     1. What is your most artistic accomplishment?   I made a band poster a long time back that I really like a lot. I've also made some 4-track recordings on guitar that I think are pretty creative.     2. What is your favorite method of artistic expression?   I like to play the guitar, but I don't know that I consider what I normally do on it "artistic" expression, just expression, period. I don't get artistic on guitar until I start overdubbing recordings on a 4-track, then I'm like an artist choosing which colors to use. I like drawing and creating colorful, surreal pictures, but I almost never do that anymore. I probably should do that more often.   3. Name one form of art that you haven't yet tried but would like to.   I always wanted to try painting and see what would happen, what I could come up with. Never have though, not yet anyway.

        Sunday   I read "Dracula" in bed for awhile before I finally got tired and turned off the lights. I had a hell of a time getting to sleep though. Hours and hours spent tossing and turning... I just could not get comfortable and I kept feeling warm around the ears and neck. I wound up sleeping until 1:30pm. I think my early-riser lifestyle is shot again.   I watched "Full Moon High" again, with Mom this time, but that was little fun. She never laughed once, just kept looking at me like I was a retard for enjoying it. What can I say? I think it's a funny movie.   I've been working since 4pm on my eBay stuff, just finished a few minutes ago. I stopped only long enough to grab a bite to eat. My auctions last week did horribly (less than $40 for the week). Hopefully I'll do better this week. I would love to just get rid of all my cards in one shot, but I'd get very little for them that way (if I could even find a buyer).   I'm probably going to goof off for awhile, surf the net and watch TV a little, then I'm going to go to bed and read some more of "Dracula". Hopefully I will sleep better tonight and do something productive tomorrow (like get a job).

        A Nothing Kind Of Day   What a lame Saturday this was.   I got out of bed around 1am, got my mailings ready, then went to the post office and mailed them. I stopped in at a computer place to check on something for Mom, then we went to a car lot. Mom wanted to look at some cars they had there (she's going to be buying a new one very soon). From there we went to McDonalds and then on home where I ate my McRibs and fries (I know, yuk). After that, I crashed on the couch with Stevie and slept on and off for about three hours (mostly off, since I was pretty uncomfortable). I eventually got up and took care on some eBay business and then talked to Sue (via IM) for several hours. After that I ate some cheesy mashed potatoes and watched Saturday Night Live (Kelly Ripa/Outkast). It wasn't a very good show... again, but Horatio Sanz had me laughing pretty hard during Weekend Update (as Jimmy Buffet). It's over now, so I guess I'm headed to bed.   I started reading "Dracula" last night (Bram Stoker's original) and I'd like to read some more before I fall asleep.   I still feel under the weather.

        Halloweeny Birthday Bash   Mom and I headed up to my sister's place around 2:35pm. I had been totally engrossed in Nova's special about "The String Theory", a unifying theory of .. well, everything. I hope I can catch it again. We got up there around 4pm (we hit a lot of traffic on the way up).   Austin, my youngest nephew, had gotten a mini-air hockey table for his birthday (today, he's six now) so I played that with him awhile before we (me, Austin, and Jesse) went outside and played catch with the football. We were having a good time until Austin thought it'd be funny to flip off his grandmother and point at his weiner with the birds. She was heading out to 7-11 and I told him he wasn't allowed to play football with us until he apologized to her. He pouted for a while and when she got back, he decided not to apologize, but rather pout some more about it. I had to tell his Mom and she eventually made him apologize, but, needless to say, it wasn't very heartfelt.   He was still grumpy as hell when we started talking about Halloween costumes. He wasn't happy with being a football player anymore, not since his brother said he was going to be a vampire. I was teasing Jesse about going as a gay football player (a la last weekend) and his sister went nuts with the idea. Both boys wound up going trick-or-treating as girls.... the worst looking girls you've ever seen. Jesse had on his sister's thong underwear and had it pulled up high, sticking out the top of his pants and I drew a little heart on the skin that was showing. He had on a pink top (tied up to expose his belly), we drew a little butterfly below his navel, a stuffed bra, pink sweatpants, a pink bandana, and white and pink sneakers. Austin had on a dress at first (he later went with a purple top) and a pink visor, his sister's shoes and her underwear. Their sister applied a ton of make-up to both of them (eye-shadow, white face powder, rouge, lipstick, mascara), and I suggested beauty marks, which she added as well.   They didn't really think things out very well though; they did all of this before dinner.   Since it was my Mom's birthday yesterday, my sister made stuffed cornish hens, mashed potatoes, and broccoli in cheese sauce for dinner. It was very good. Austin didn't eat though. Too much candy beforehand.  Dana, my niece, surprised everyone by dressing up at the last minute. She went as a dude, wearing sweatpants and a hooded sweatshirt with freckles and a mustache drawn on her face. Not to be outdone, I surprised everyone by going as a zombie. I threw white powder on my face and painted dark circle below my eyes and colored my eyelids black as well. I took a red marker and drew on a long scar on my forehead and drew blood coming out the corners of my mouth. I took a blue marker and colored my lips blue. Jesse found some ugly plastic teeth that completed my attire. When Austin saw me he started complaining that my "costume" was better, until I started chasing him in proper zombie fashion. That shut him up :)  Dana's boyfriend, Ricky, went trick-or-treating with us as well. He wore no costume other than a black bra. Not very imaginative.   I told Austin, jokingly, to tell them it's his birthday, maybe he'll get more candy. He did, and apparently it worked out well for him. He got out of hand with it after a while though. He started going up and saying "give me extra candy". No "trick-or-treat", no "hello", no nothing.   Almost everyone who saw Jesse and his thong busted up. I had the most fun watching people's reactions to him. Austin got a few laughs out of people as well.   After we got back, the boys threw their candy off to the side, Jesse took a bath, and Austin argued about taking a bath. I rested. My feet were sore from all of the walking.     This is the part where I know I am going to sound like an old man talking about "kids these days". You know, back in my day, when we'd come home from trick-or-treating, we'd immediately get down to the business at hand: candy. My sister and I and several of our friends, we'd dump our candy on the floor, we'd each have our own pile, and we'd go through our piles to see what we got and then we'd begin making deals with the other kids, trading the stuff we didn't want for stuff we did. For me, the candy corn and the  peanut-shaped orange-colored crap had to go, but the root beer barrels and chocolate bars were golden! But these kids today... I don't think they even opened their bags after they got home. They threw them to the side and went on to other stuff. Where's the joy in that? What will their fond memories consist of? "I remember when we'd come home on Halloween and throw our bags of candy off to the side... had to get back to Playstation, you know?" It's sad.   After awhile, the boys went outside with their Dad and played with one of Austin's new birthday gifts, some remote-controlled thingy that flip flops and rolls around. After we finished playing with that, we went back inside and had some ice cream cake (Carvel... yum).    Before Mom and I headed home, I had Dana and Jess locate Dana's guitar (the one my Mom bought her a year ago). Neither had any idea where it was. It took some hunting to finally track it down. One of the things we told her when Mom bought it for her was that, if she wasn't going to take care of it, we'd take it back. So I did. I got the tuner back as well, and I got most of my guitar stand back (this wasn't hers, it was  lent  to her). One piece is missing. The stand was stuffed in Jesse's closet, the guitar was under some clutter in Dana's room. I also took back a stack of books I'd lent her. She wasn't reading them, and she certainly wasn't taking care of them either, all strewn about on her floor.   (kicking back into "old man" mode)  Kids these days just don't have any respect or consideration. I always took care of my stuff, and I always took proper care with other people's belongings. If not out of respect, then because I didn't want to have to replace it if I broke it. These kids... they just don't give a shit. Their parents will pay for it... or maybe not. They could care less either way.    Besides the guitar, I left with a TV set too. Some lady gave my brother-in-law a small color TV and he had no use for it, so he gave it to Mom and I. A while back, I gave her my small TV, so I'll probably hook this one up to my Nintendo (not that I really ever play video games).   My sister gave us a bag of Reese Cups as well. She bought a ton of candy ($40 worth) and almost no one came to her door. I told her it'd have helped if they'd put a lightbulb in the light that lights up the walkway that leads to their door. It was just too dark. I'll bet people thought no one was home.   Mom and I left around 10:30pm, got home about 11:30pm. Mom went to bed, I'm writing this.   So that's my Halloween. I hope everybody had a good one (and you know who you are).

        The Boy Is Back In Town   My 11 year-old nephew, Jesse, is down visiting us for a few days. My Mom went up and got him yesterday morning/afternoon. Yesterday was pretty overcast, so we didn't do anything outside. Instead, we went to my room and listened to music while I cleaned bit. I gave him a bunch of stiff from my toy/junk drawers (necklaces, rock and roll pins,  and fast food toys mostly). We watched "Caddyshack" together (I fast forwarded through the more mature scenes) and then, after JP showed up, we went to my band practice.   The amp I had to use, a Randall, sounded like shit and it killed our sound; too ugly and loud. It took a while to even figure out how to get any dostortion on it (the studio owner had to show me). JP's tone was pretty loud and distorted too. Before long, I had a killer headache.   JP had Jess film us with his handcam while we played. He had fun with it, teasing us about taking nothing but butt shots. After we got home and lkooked at the tape a little, it looked like Jess did a pretty good job, although there were a few butt shots on there ("butt action" as Jess said).   JP and I argued a bit over the set list for our next show. He kept wanting to put in our usual stuff and I didn't want this gig to sound just like the gig we were to play the following week. What I didn't know is, there is no gig the following week now (the guy backed out on the booking). We're only playing out once in January. The other problem with the set list is that JP and Jimmy really hadn't learned the two new songs on it ("Stone Free" & "I Got Loaded") so we'll likely have to replace them with our standard stuff. I'll have to work on a new set list for next week.   After we got home, I made dinner for Jess and I (hamburgers and tater tots) then we watched "The Dead Zone" together and part of "Dragonslayer". We went to bed around 2am.   He's still sleeping, so I'm going to try and get my mailings ready before he gets up.

        Books Read in 2003   I was hoping to add a couple more to this list before the year ended, but I've given up hope of doing that since I've been busy house cleaning all weekend. I still have more cleaning to do and I also have band practice on Tuesday, so I don't see any reading time anytime soon. So, without any further ado, here is the list of books I've read in 2003:    1) "Helter Skelter" by Vincent Bugliosi    Very good, very interesting book. Recommended.    2) "My Point...And I Do Have One" by Ellen Degeneres    Hilarious book! I laughed a lot while reading this one. Recommended.    3) "The Sheppard Murder Case" by Paul Holmes    It's a well written and interesting book, but it's outdated and slanted too much in favor of Sam Sheppard's innocence. I did a lot of research after reading it and found that the book left out a lot. I think Sheppard did it. Not really recommended.    4) "The Stand" by Stephen King    Very good book! It's a long one, but it held my attention throughout. I read the regular version, not the even longer unedited version. Recommended.    5) "Death Of A Salesman" by Arthur Miller    It's a classic American play. Recommended.   6) "Once A Warrior King" by David Donovan    Very interesting book. It's the Vietnam war through the eyes of an American "Advisor". Recommended.    7) "Proof" by Dick Francis    It was like reading a TV murder-mystery. I didn't like the ending much, but otherwise, it was a fairly enjoyable read. Not really recommended.    8) "Frankenstein" by Mary Shelley    Much different than I'd seen in the movies. Frankenstein's monster is more human here. Very good book. Recommended.   9) "The Amityville Horror" by Jay Anson    I did a lot of reserach on the story while reading it and learned that the whole story has proven to be fraudulent (no surprise there). It's all one big con. The story is pretty creepy though, and if you can overlook the fact that the story is a crock, it might be worth reading. Still, not really recommended.     10) "Les Miserables" by Victor Hugo    I have a tough time with this one. I saw the film before I read the book so I was expecting to read about the relationship between Jean Valjean and Fantine but there was nothing there. In the film, they had a relationship, in the book, they really didn't. To me, the relationship is a necessity because it explains why he did what he did for her (rescued and cared for her daughter). I don't know whether or not to recommend the book. It's a definite classic, it's a great story, and it's a very well written book, but if you've seen the movie, you may be left scratching your head like me.    11) "Lord Of The Flies" by William Golding    This is another classic and deservedly so. My niece read it shortly after me and she  hated  it. Of course, she was expected to pick out and understand all of the underlying subtext whereas I just read it for the story. It's good story. Recommended.    12) "Miss America" by Howard Stern    I read "Private Parts" a few years ago and I got a lot of laughs from it. I hardly laughed at all reading this one. It seems like nothing more than an ego-trip and a cash-in on the success of the previous book. Not recommended.    13) "Different Seasons" by Stephen King    I loved this book! Great stories! How many books out there have inspired three different movies ("The Shawshank Redemption", "Apt Pupil", and "Stand By Me")? Definitely recommended.    14) "No Shirt, No Shoes... No Problem!" by Jeff Foxworthy    I was expecting a lot more laughs from this one, instead I get more info than I need about his sexual adventures. Not recommended.     15) "Carrie" by Stephen King    Good book, very well written. Recommended.    16) "Dracula" by Bram Stoker    Like "Frankenstein", it wasn't exactly what I'd expected. It was pretty neat how it was written, as a series of diary entries from the primary characters. Dracula himself was different than expected too. Very good book. Recommended.    17) "Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee" by Dee Brown    Very good, very moving book. It made me sad, but the stories are important and I think this should be a mandatory read in every high school. Recommended.   I have a ton of books on deck for 2004 already, now I just have to set aside the time to read them all!

        It's A Slug's Life For Me   I think I'm just going to coast through today. I'm not going to pull cards, scan cards or list any auctions, I'm just going to veg out. I've already started the day out sluggishly, not getting up until 1:30pm (I guess my body needed the rest with all of the activity of late), so I think I'll continue in that vein and do nothing today. Actually, I would like to get the living room finished and I'd like to get my bedroom clean (once and for all), but who knows, I may just do nothing anyway. It's just that kind of day.

        Busy Weekend   I've been pretty busy the last few days. All day yesterday, eBay ran a "Free Listing Day" which I, luckily, discovered. They only announce it shortly before the actual day they do it and then, only on their announcement board, which I don't usually frequent. I spent about 4 hours listing auctions, all re-lists. I think I put about 130 up.   I crashed a little after Midnight last night and got up around 7:15am this morning. I ate breakfast and then I started packaging up my eBay mailings. After I got done with that, I continued with the re-arranging of the living room.   I started it yesterday with the TV and computer desk going back to Mom's room and then hooking up the new (crappy) TV and (worthless) DVD player out front. Yesterday, I moved our little couch out to the porch (to be disposed of), I moved the entertainment center to the corner, I took the video rack I brought home from my sister's (it was in a heap near their front door) and filled it with videos, and I moved Mom's display cabinet across the living room to the other side and cleaned the glass in it.   Today, I moved the bookcase over to the front door, moved the big couch across the room, I moved Mom's recliner to the opposite side of the room, and did some general cleaning up. I still need to do some more arranging, it's not quite right yet. Neither is my back, which has been achy with all of the lifting and moving I've been doing.  This afternoon, after mailing my eBay packages, Mom and I went to Circuit City and I exchanged the crappy DVD player for a better one. Mom lent me $32.50 so I could get a decent one (a Magnavox). I also looked at the TVs while I was there and was appalled at how the one we got looks compared to the others on display there. I mean, the crappiness of the Apex TV is so obvious. It looks like you're playing an old tape all the time. Mom may exchange that one for a better one yet; she has 30 days to decide.   I also found that both the DVD player and the TV that we got from my sister were the absolute cheapest they had. There was absolutely nothing lower in price (or quality).   If you ask me, that's fucking pathetic.  I thought I was going to have to return the three DVDs Mom bought me in order to upgrade the DVD player, but Mom said, since she put it on her Target card, that I could just wait until the charge came in to pay her back. I'm really glad I didn't have to return them, I was pretty angry that I was going to have to in the first place, but I'm also not happy that I had to pay to get something better. Some gift...   On the way home from Circuit City, Mom and I stopped at Orange Blossom Groves and I got some Orange/Vanilla ice cream... yum! It's been a long, long time since I had any, great stuff!  I guess I'm going to go and hook up my DVD player to the shitty new TV. I should go look at the old one and see it I can connect the DVD player to it instead.   More lifting and moving, just what my back needs.

        Christmas C-Rap   This morning/afternoon, I moved Mom's new computer desk back to her room and hooked up her computer for her. I also moved an old couch out of the house, I hooked up the new TV in the living room and took the old one back to Mom's room and hooked it up for her, and finally, I hooked up my new DVD player.   The old axiom "you get what you pay for" still holds true: the no-name, off brand DVD player my sister bought me for Christmas doesn't work. The power comes on and all, but the tray disc tray won't open. Very nice.  You know, I wasn't real happy that my sister bought me an "Entiveo" brand DVD player as a gift (especially since they wouldn't buy stuff like that for themselves), and I'm even less happy that I now have to go and stand in line at Circuit City to exchange this piece of shit for an identical, but, hopefully,  working , piece of shit... all because my sister went with the cheapest player available. The majority of my Christmas presents were DVDs, none of which I can watch yet, so I'm pretty fucking unhappy right now.   To add insult to injury, the TV my sister bought Mom, another no-name brand product (it's an Apex), works like crap. The picture is very, very grainy. You can see static lines moving under the picture. It may have to be exchanged/returned too. The old one I moved back to Mom's room has a much better picture.   I am extremely disappointed and angry right now.   Like I said before, I'm grateful that my sister did stuff for us this year, and I know it's the thought that counts, but you just don't buy stuff like that for family. At least,  I  wouldn't... it's just not right.

        Christmas Re-Cap   I'd gone to bed about 10pm on Christmas Eve, but I just could not sleep. By 5:30am I was wide awake in bed, not having slept for more than an hour or two, and I layed there until 6:30am when I finally got up. I got showered, got dressed and got everything that was going with us to my sister's house moved out to the car. Before we left, Mom gave me my present from her: 3 new DVDs ("Caddyshack", "The Life Of Brian", and "The Shining") and 2 outdoor fun kits (horseshoes and an assortment pack with badminton and other stuff). Cool! Around 7:30am, we were on the road.   We got up there around 8:30am and no one was awake yet. I woke up my sister and brother-in-law and then moved the stuff we brought up from the car to the house (all by myself, as usual). After that, I went in and woke the kids up.   All three were all sleeping in my niece's bed, so I went in there screaming at the top of my lungs "AAAAAHHH!!! WAKE UP!!! THERE ARE PRESENTS OUT THERE!!!"). Dana (my niece, 16) and Austin (my younger nephew, 6) popped up immediately, Jesse (my older nephew, 11) continued sleeping. It wasn't long before I had them all up and out of bed to open presents.   Austin had a ton of presents to open, but the other two had very little. Dana had gotten a big present earlier, a Golden Retriever puppy she named Toby, and Jesse's main present was a surprise (to him, anyway). I was teasing him about how little he'd gotten ("Man, all you got was a shirt and some pants? That sucks, dude.") when his Dad brought out the motor scooter he'd wanted. His eyes nearly popped out. He was in total disbelief.   Between the scooter and his video games, I didn't see much of Jesse the rest of the day, which sucked, because I was hoping he'd be coming back home with us (I needed someone to play horshoes and badminton with). He was kind of snubbing me anyway (his Uncle Doug took him and Austin to go play basketball and Jesse didn't even ask me along), so I guess it's a good thing he didn't come home with us after all.   As I mentioned in a previous post, I gave each of the boys a 50 piece glow-in-the-dark Supermags magnet set. Austin played with it a bit, so did I , but Jesse pretty much ignored it. Dana's boyfriend, Ricky (who showed up shortly after the presents were opened), played with it more than anyone.   Dana had a hell of a time opening the present I gave her, with the crazy wrap job (she had a semi-horrified look on her face when she first saw it). She got her hair stuck to it at one point, but she really liked the presents inside though (lotions and stuff) and couldn't believe that I'd actually gotten her "chick stuff".   Mom made my niece very happy with her bags of snowman and reindeer poop (snowman poop = marshmellows, reindeer poop = chocolate chips) and original poetry to go with each one (Mom wrote a funny poem for each person).   My sister and brother-in-law really didn't say much about the DVDs I got them, but my sister really liked the book I won her (that Mom paid for). I gave my brother-in-law a KISS ("Greatest KISS") CD to go with the DVD I bought him, so even though I got shorted money by certain eBay bidders, I ended up ok. I even added some extras, some stuff I had around the house. I gave my sister an Anne Rice paperback ("Interview With The Vampire"), my niece a Stephen King paperback ("Carrie"), my brother-in-law a video ("Vacation"), my older nephew a bunch of tapes (several Ratt, Scorpions, Dokken) and my younger nephew I gave a brand new whoopie cushion.  My sister and brother-in-law gave me a new DVD player, but it's an off-brand I've never heard of, Entiveo, and I'm a little wary of it. I'm not really complaining, I'm happy to have gotten anything, but... if it were me, I wouldn't have given my loved ones electronics of lesser quality than I'd settle for myself. They have Zenith, Panasonic, and Sanyo stuff themselves. They gave my Mom a new 20-inch TV, an Apex, which is also an off brand.   Mom surprised me with several more DVDs in my stocking: "Minority Report", "Terminator 3", and the whole first season of "Sanford And Son", plus a CD I've been wanting, the soundtrack to "A Mighty Wind". The DVDs were used, from pawn shops we hit. She made a trip back to Pawn Depot for the first two movies, but she said she bought the Sanford and Son DVD right under my nose (I never saw her do it). Unfortunately, because she did it that way, she didn't look it over before buying it and the discs are pretty thrashed. It's the thought that counts, but... she knows I am extremely picky, anal even, about my CDs and how much I hate scratchy and even finger-printed discs, so I don't know why she spent her money on something like that without checking it over first. She knows me better than that, or so I thought anyway.   She did several things that boggled my mind this Christmas. For starters, what I wanted more than anything was two new Jimi Hendrix CDs that have to be ordered from the Experience Hendrix website or phoneline (they're not available in stores). Awhile back, I gave her the catalog and circled the two I wanted but she never bothered to order them. Then, after it was too late to order them in time for Christmas, since she said she still had stuff to buy for me, I gave her a list of DVDs I wanted and put 4 or 5 Hendrix DVDs at the top of the list, what I wanted most, and she bought none of them. As far as I can recall, this the first year since I was a teenager that I haven't gotten any Jimi Hendrix stuff for Christmas. It's a bit disappointing to me. It's the end of a tradition.   Another tradition ended this year too, she had been buying me a can of Poppycock for Christmas for several years now and this year she didn't do that. I don't mean to sound ungrate-ful for what I did receive, but I really liked having certain traditional things remaining intact  The other thing she did that puzzled me was buy me a Bass Guitar magazine. You know, whatever, it's not a big deal, but it makes me feel like she didn't care enough to even look at what it was she was buying me ("Eh, guitar in the title, that's good enough"). I mean, she knows I'm not a bass player, so what the hell? It's useless to me. I'd have preferred she just saved her money.   Regardless, I'm thankful for what I did get for Christmas, I'm happy to have been able to buy what I did for everyone, and I am grateful for the time I got to spend with my family.   My sister cooked up a killer breakfast for everyone (omlettes and hash browns) after the presents were all opened. She and I sat on the couch getting some of the kids electronic toys opened and running. One of the toys was a Pixter, which is really cool.   I spent time with my niece in her room, playing with her puppy (he's a cutie). I layed in my sister's bed with my brother-in-law and nephews, watching my nephews play video games while listening to the KISS CD I bought.   My younger nephew was singing along with KISS' "Do You Love Me". Later at night he was singing AC/DC's "T.N.T." ("Oy! Oy! Oy!").   I played outside for a long while with my younger nephew and brother-in-law, throwing the football around and later, my niece brought the puppy out and I watched him and Austin play together. They were funny.   My sister cooked up a huge dinner (ham, stuffed chicken, macaroni and cheese, some awesome green beans (with bacon and onions), and squash. Mom supplied cheesecake for dessert, which me and my niece "fought" over. We were all stuffed.   By the time dinner was over, I was really getting tired. The lack of sleep had caught up to me in a big way (my sister said my eyes were bloodshot).  Before we left, me and my brother-in-law playfully annoyed my Mom (she hates the F-word) by cussing like sailors.   After we got home, I unloaded the car, got on the PC for a few minutes, then went to bed, beat.   Overall, it was a really good, enjoyable day.

        NEWS FLASH: Grinches Attack My Christmas Spirit   Grrrrr!!!! The mailman just went by, and again,  not a single payment in there . I don't have money to finish my Christmas shopping now, leaving my brother-in-law shorted about $10.   As I've mentioned many times, I listed extra eBay auctions in late November/early December hoping to have plenty of money in time for Christmas, and in fact, I  would have  had extra money if it weren't for a handful of selfish bastards out there. I still have $115 due in, money that should have been here in time for Christmas.   What a bunch of shit.   I have one asshole holding me up for almost a month now, who won 14 of my auctions (he owes me over $40) back on November 29th and not only hasn't paid, but does not respond to my emails to him. How fucking selfish can someone be? Why bid on my auctions if you're not going to pay? Why screw someone like that so near Christmastime? How fucking inconsiderate... I don't know what I'm going to do for my brother-in-law now.   Despite the grinches out there, I am doing my best to make this Christmas special. I wrapped all of the presents today, mine and Mom's and even one of Dana's.   I wrapped one present, my gift to Dana, incredibly badly (on purpose). It's shampoos and assorted chick stuff and it comes in a little chick handbag... I took it, put it in a cardboard box, covered it as sloppily as possible with bubble wrap and packing tape wiith bits and pieces of wrapping paper taped here and there, yellow plastic twine tied around it haphazardly, cardboard from the wrapping paper rolls hanging out from under the bubblewrap, a big handmade bow (with wrinkled paper and tape hanging off it) and an address label with her name on it (in lowercase letters). I wish I could post photos here, it is hilarious looking! I can't wait to see the look on her face when she sees it!  Also, Mom ran out to do some errands a couple hours ago and I took that time to assemble her computer desk for her. I torn a hole one of my fingers when the screwdriver slipped and went through the skin and I now have a blood blister on my hand from catching my hand between some part of the desk, but I got it done and it looks pretty nice. I put it by the front door, so she'll see it as soon as she walks in.   Continuing with my Christmas-spiritedness, I had some homemade white chocolate, peanut, & pretzel candy set aside for the mailman (Mom made a bunch), but unfortunately, I missed him. By the time I heard him and got outside, he was two doors down and pulling out of the park. I'll try to catch him on Thursday. Hopefully he'll be bringing me some payments then too.

        Sleeping Shopping Sleeping Shopping   The last few days seem like one long blurry day to me. I barely slept the day before yesterday, getting about 2 hours of sleep, and then I wound up going to bed around 6:30pm, sleeping until about 2:15am, and then going back to bed around 4:30am and sleeping until 9:30am. What a mess.   At least I went and applied for that production job... finally. We stopped there on Monday, before we went out pawn shopping again. They're supposed to be calling for interviews this week. Wish me luck!  Mom and I hit a bunch of pawn shops yesterday and today too. Money is tight, so that's why I've been hitting the pawn shops so hard. I'm still waiting on $115 that is due in from several bidders. I haven't gotten any payments in this week at all... bastards.    Anyway, I came up empty again, not finding a single CD or DVD to get Danny (my brother-in-law) or my Mom. I got stuff for me though. Yesterday I bought a video of "Pulp Fiction" for $2 (special letterbox edition) and today I bought 3 CDs, though nothing very interesting: "From Dusk Til Dawn" soundtrack, The Musacha Tapes (prank calls), and a thunderstorm CD (the sound of rain, wind and thunder). I also bought Mom an Aaron Copeland CD as well.   We went to Goodwill and a couple other thrift stores today also and I bought even more for myself there. I bought eleven books (10 Stephen King and Kurt Vonnegut Jr's "Breakfast Of Champions") and two cassette tapes (Led Zeppelin "III" & Bob Seger "Night Moves") for a grand total of FIVE DOLLARS! How awesome is that?   The King books I bought were:  Stephen King books: "The Dead Zone", "Firestarter", "Needful Things", "The Bachman Books", "The Shining", "Skeleton Crew", "Night Shift", "Christine", and "Gerald's Game" in paperback, and "Misery" in hardcover.  I think I have "Gerald's Game" in hardcover, but I like reading paperbacks better (because I don't care about their condition), so that's cool.  Right now I'm in the process of packaging some eBay stuff to be mailed tomorrow and with wrapping presents. I'm pretty tired, so I don't know how far I'll get. I still have the trash to take out tonight too (we have a lot).   Oh shit! I just remembered I have laundry in the washer, been there all day.   Gotta go!

         urlLink Monday Mission       1. Have you ever had a dream so real, that inside the dream you had to fight to wake yourself up? Do you remember the dream?   I've had dreams that felt real, but I don't remember having any that I had to try and wake myself out of.    2. How would you define the concept of a "soul-mate" is? Do you believe in such things? Have you met your soul-mate?   I don't believe in destiny or a soul-mate in that context, someone you are destined to be with, but I do believe that there are people out there who are more compatible with you than others, people you may feel an instant kinship with. Have I met my soul-mate? Maybe, maybe not... only time will tell.     3. What does it take to make men happy anyway?   Love, respect, sex, food, and comfort.   4. What is your favorite piece of electric hardware, and why?   I don't use any electric hardware... unless a computer counts.    5. Have you ever stopped to help a stranded motorist? Has anyone ever stopped to help you when you were stranded? Isn't there some element of risk involved when helping someone with car trouble, or is it better to just "do unto others as you'd have them do unto you?"    I don't drive, but I'd agree that there is risk involved with helping out a stranger. Sad, but true.    6. Just for fun, what is the one present you'd like for Christmas, but you know there is no way you will?   A 2x12 combo amplifier, preferable a Marshall or a Fender.   7. What are you thankful for this Christmas (or your current holiday this season)?   That I have a roof over my head and food in my belly.    BONUS: Could you hurry, sir? Daddy says there's not much time.   Hurry  this . Oh, and by the way, Daddy's an alcoholic.

         urlLink Monday Madness     It's all about money this time. So let's do it! Each of the questions below begin with 'How much would YOU pay for'..........    1. a pair of dress shoes   I have no need for them, since I never go anywhere fancy, but if I had to buy a pair, $30 sounds about right.    2. a pair of jeans   Hmmm... $25 sounds fair.   3. a pound of ground round   I have no idea... $2.00?   4. a music cd   This one's tricky. For regular new CDs, I think we should pay $8-10 maximum, but for out-of-print, hard-to-find CDs, I'd be willing to pay more. I've paid over $50 each for CDs before (Hendrix ones).    5. a computer   $500 should get you the best one out there.    6. a loaf of bread   $1.00.   7. a dvd movie   I'd say $10-$12 is reasonable.   8. an ironing board   No idea. Ummm... how about $15-$20?   9. a hair cut   $5 for a regular man's haircut, more for fancy "chick" stuff.   10. a magazine   $2 sounds right to me.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  I just rocked out to Billy Squier's "Signs Of Life" cassette while I was making breakfast this morning. I listened to my 2nd Miles Davis' "Kind Of Blue" CD yesterday, as well as my new April Wine "The Nature Of The Beast" CD.    Watching on TV:  Since I've been doing days again, I'm back to watching "The Ellen Degeneres Show" followed by a ton of judge shows: "People's Court", "Judge Mathis", "Judge Joe Brown", "Divorce Court", and "Judge Judy". Earlier in the week, while I was back to being a night owl, I was watching "The Daily Show", "Tough Crowd w/Colin Quinn", and "The Howard Stern Show'. As usual, I've been watching "The Simpsons", "Everybody Loves Raymond", and "Seinfeld" in the early evenings. I've caught episodes of "The Jeff Corwin Experience", "the Crocodile Hunter", and "Trading Spaces" here and there too.   It sounds like I'm watching a ton of TV, but usually I'm on the PC or eating lunch or dinner when the shows are on (not that I  don't  watch too much TV).    Downloading:  Nothing lately.   Reading:  Nothing lately.    Jamming:  Played out live last Tuesday (see 8 posts below) and next week we practice on Tuesday.    Working:  Still not working, but I am back to daytime hours (I was out of bed at 7:45am this morning w/o the alarm) so I will be looking for a job, hopefully, on Monday.    Buying:  Christmas presents! Ok, since no one looks here anyway, here's what I bought everyone:  My Mom: a new computer desk at Staples, which I will have to put together. She needed one for the computer she bought at a yard sale awhile back.   My Sister: I bought her two new Little House On The Prairie DVDs. She used to watch that show with my dad when she was a kid and I thought it might bring back some good memories for her (she says she hates our Dad now, ever since he died).   My Niece: My Mom overbought for her, so I guess I giving her some raspberry chick stuff (lotions, candles, whatever) from Bed, Bath, and Beyond.  My Nephews: I got them both the same thing: Glow-In-The-Dark Supermag kits (50 pieces each).   My Brother-In-Law: A new Tampa Bay Buccaneers Superbowl DVD. I still need to buy him another DVD. Hopefully I'll find a good one for him in a pawn shop (I may go to a few more on Monday).   My self: I bought that lot of tapes on eBay that I mentioned in my previous post.  I spent about $200 on Christmas this year, which is great considering I haven't had a job or a paycheck since April.     Selling:  My current auctions are tanking, about $15 for the week thus far (and they end tonight), but I am going to list another 50 or so tonight. Hopefully they'll do better. As I mentioned before, I am still waiting on several payments, totalling over $100.    Eating:  I cooked up a big breakfast this morning and now I am stuffed. I made eggs, hash browns, bacon, toast, and I made some coffee as well. Ugh. We had Sonny's baby back rib dinners on Friday night, boneless pork chops and rice last night. Most of the week, I just ate turkey sandwiches or baloney and cheese sandwiches.     Feeling:  I feel very tired. I'm not sleeping as long as I normally would, getting up too early.   Planning:  To get a job and to have a great Christmas! I'm also planning on buying some DVDs soon... my sister said she got me a DVD player for Christmas! Woo-hoo!

        Miscellaneous Saturday Stuff   Below, I mentioned that I bought two battery-operated waterfall thingies while out pawn-shopping today (they're actually called "Cordless Tranquility Fountains"), where I hoped that they weren't crap. Well, they were/are: one doesn't work at all and the other works, but is leaking at the top. Nice... that's $10 completely wasted.   I got in that lot of tapes plus the Napa Valley wood holder today. As I feared, the case got damaged during shipping. The back of it got torn off and some of the slats got pushed out of place too. To make matters worse, while trying to put the slats back in place, I snapped two of them in half... godammit. I finally stapled the back piece back on and hung it on my wall and filled it with Hendrix tapes. The broken slats aren't noticeable, thankfully (I guess I broke them in the right place).   I bid on another eBay auction for tapes before we went out today, for 150 of them, and I wound up winning it! Killer lot, and I got it for $5 plus $15 shipping! Lots of Blues in it too. Here's some of what's in it:  Bruce Springsteen "Greetings From Asbury Park N.J.",  Joe Cocker "The Best Of Joe Cocker", The Allman Brothers "A Decade Of Hits 1969-1979", David Bowie " The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars" & "The Singles 1969-1993" (2 tapes), U2 "The Joshua Tree", Neil Young & Crazy Horse "Rust Never Sleeps", B.B. King "Why I Sing The Blues" & "The Best Of B.B. King", Albert King "Roadhouse Blues" & "Blues Power", John Lee Hooker "Blues For My Baby", & "The Best Of John Lee Hooker 1965-1974", Buddy Guy "Damn Right I've Got The Blues", Stevie Ray Vaughan "Texas Flood", "Soul To Soul", "The Sky Is Crying" & "In The Beginning", Cheap Trick "Greatest Hits", Bad Company "10 From 6", Jeff Beck "Blow By Blow", The Doors "The Best Of The Doors", Billy Joel "Piano Man", The Clash "London Calling", etc..  Someone emailed me tonight about buying 3 of the tapes from this lot, three that I didn't want anyway, for $6 + $3 shipping, so as soon as I get it, I'll make back about 1/3 of the cost of it... sweet!  Well, I guess I'm heading off to bed here shortly; I didn't realize it was so late.

        Pawn Shopping   I got out of bed around 8:45am, got up, got my last package ready to mail, showered, and was on the road by 10am. We stopped at a ton of pawn shops looking for DVDs and CDs for my niece, brother-in-law and older nephew (I had already gotten something for my older nephew, but my Mom was going to give him what I got him and I was going to buy him CDs instead).   I didn't find much, just four CDs, and I'm not even sure if the kids will listen to them or not. I bought Miles Davis "Kind Of Blue" (remastered), Jimi Hendrix "Band Of Gypsys", KISS "Greatest KISS", and I also bought an April Wine CD, "Nature Of The Beast", for me. They were all $5 each. I bought the Miles Davis CD for my niece and the other two for my nephew, but I don't think she'd listen to jazz or he'd listen to Hendrix (not yet anyways). I guess it doesn't matter much now, because, after we got home, my sister called my Mom from Wal-Mart asking if my Mom wanted to buy my nephew this gizmo she found (which cost as much as Mom was willing to spend on him altogether) and she went ahead and bought it... after we'd already decided she was giving him the thing I bought and I'd be buying him CDs, which I already started to do. Grrrr!!!!  While we were out, I also bought two little tabletop waterfall machine thingies that run on batteries, one for my niece and one for me. They were marked $10 each but I got them  both  for $10 (from a pawn shop that was going out of business). I hope they're not crap. If it works well, I might just make a "relaxation" basket for my niece with the waterfall thingy, the Miles Davis CD, some candles and a book perhaps. It'd be different.  My Mom stopped in at Staples to look at a computer desk and I told her to pick it up and I'd pay for it when I got more eBay money in (I'm still waiting on a little over $100), so now I just need to buy a little more for my niece and a little more for my brother-in-law and I'm done.

         urlLink The Friday Five     1. List your five favorite beverages.   I love iced-tea, especially freshly-brewed ice tea, and I like hot tea as well. For sodas I like Pepsi, Fusion (when I can find it), Cream Soda, and Root Beer. I like milk a lot too.   For alcoholic beverages, I like wine, Jack Daniels (with Coke or Pepsi), White Russians, Malibu, and Kahlua. I don't drink very often though.    2. List your five favorite websites.   Not a day goes by without multiple visits to eBay.com and FARK.com. Does Google.com count? I use it daily, Allmusic.com as well (both are excellent resources). I also frequent MSNBC's NBA page and NBA.com as well.    3. List your five favorite snack foods.   Right now, my main snack food is Luigi's Italian Ice (lemon flavor). Before that it was pumpkin seeds. When I can get them, usually in the Spring, I will snack the hell out of Samoas (the Girl Scout cookies), and I usually snack on Poppycock once a year, right after Christmas (Mom usually buys me a can as a gift). I love pie too, so whenever we have pie around, I will snack on it. Ice cream too (especially Edy's Coney Island Waffle Cone and Fortune Cookie flavors).    4. List your five favorite board and/or card games.   Checkers, Monopoly, Rummy, Trivial Pursuit, and Blackjack. I like Poker too, but I can never rememeber what beats what or how to bet.    5. List your five favorite computer and/or game system games.   I love all of the "Age Of Empires" games, "Star Wars: Galactic Empires", and "Beach Head 2000". I also like the original "Grand Theft Auto" for the PC, and though I don't think it's good that kids play it, I like "Grand Theft Auto: Vice City" too.

        Up Too Early   I went to bed around 10:30 last night, played guitar in bed for awhile, then drifted off to sleep. Unfortunately, by 4:45am, I was awake again, and by 5am, I was out of bed. I screwed with my PC for awhile (took forever to start up right) and then Mom came out, rising early herself, to make snacks for her office party. I put on "the Blue Collar Comedy Tour" (thank you, Kazaalite) and Mom and I listened to the whole thing, laughing here and there. Around 7am, I went back to bed and tried to go back to sleep, but by 8am, I was back out of bed again. I feel like shit, like I just haven't slept enough.  Now, I'm going to eat some Apple Cinnamon oatmeal and do the Friday Five.

        Thursday Non-Sleeping eBay Blues   I'm still awake... and I'm freakin' tired. I'm going to try and stay up until 10:30 or 11pm tonight and then I'm going to crash  hard . I want to start getting up at 8am every day again.   I've spent most of the time in front of the PC, shopping. I think I picked a great gift for my sister, some DVDs, but I found more than I could afford and Mom bought some too (I will go into specifics after Christmas). I also won my sister a book, but I had Mom pay for it since I already hit my limit.   I still need something for my niece and my Mom. I was looking at DVDs for Mom, but since we don't have a DVD player yet, I decided against it.   Actually, I was hoping I'd have enough money to buy a DVD player, but that one asshole eBay buyer, the one who owes me $46, has yet to send his payment. He's screwed up my Christmas plans big time. I was counting on that money for Christmas. What gets me is that the jerk won most of my auctions with the Buy-It-Now option, which means he stopped my auctions from getting bid on by buying them outright, but here it is, 20 days later, and I still have no payment for them. What a selfish prick. To make matters worse, he is not responding to my emails and I saw in his eBay feedback that he has already paid for several auctions he won that ended  after  mine. Very frustrating.  I'm also dealing with the seller I bought my sister's DVDs from. The communication with him is  painfully  slow. I was hoping to have the deal done and paid for about 7 hours ago (so they could ship today) but he's dragging it out. I asked him to give me a total to send with insured shipping and also to tell me what Region they are (I realized he didn't say in his auction descriptions) but he emailed me with the total and nothing more. So... I had to email again, asking about the Region. It had been about 6 hours between the last two emails from him, so I have doubts they are going to be shipping today.   *Sigh*  I'm too tired for that kind of shit.   UPDATE: Before I even got to post this, the guy got back to me about my sister's DVDs and we finished the deal. Yay!

         urlLink What's On... Wednesday     What's On your 'New Year's Resolutions' list Right Now?   I don't think I've even completed anything on my New Year's resolutions lists  ever . They're a waste of time. I procrastinate too much and never follow through with anything I start, I get bored too easily or else I tire of being inconvenienced. I always fall back into my old ways and habits even though I know I shouldn't. That being said, here's are my New Year's Resolutions:  1)  Get a job (if I haven't already gotten one). 2)  Get a job I actually enjoy. 3)  Pay off all of my debts.  4)  Get a car and a driver's license. 5)  Get a 2nd band together and/or get my songs together. 6)  Lose weight. 7)  Lose even more weight.  8)  Get a girlfriend. 9)  Get my own place. 10) Be happy.

        Wednesday   I didn't get to bed until about 5am Wednesday morning and didn't actually get to sleep until well after daylight. I was just too wound up from playing out I guess. I had a lot of music going through my mind.  I had no idea what time it was Mom woke me up later that day. It was almost 6:30pm. She brought home some chow (Burger King Chicken Caesar sandwich and chili with an Arby's baked potato) and I chowed down.  I spent most of the night on the computer, doing eBay work and also doing some eBay shopping. I bought stuff for both of my nephews on eBay yesterday and tonight I bought something for my brother-in-law there.   I still have to buy for my 16 year old MTV/BET-loving niece, my 32 year-old sister who has 3 kids and a stressful job, and then my Mom, who's stuck with me. I'll probably spend about $25 a piece for my sister and niece and a bit more for Mom. Any ideas out there? Feel free to leave suggestions on my zonkboard.   While shopping on eBay tonight, I also bought myself a cool little rosin bag (to help with my sweaty hands when I'm playing out). It's a handmade black square with colorful, hippy-looking volkswagon bugs on it. It was $5. I'm sure I could have found it cheaper, but I liked the design (I'm a hippy at heart).   I think I'm going to wind up staying up all night and day again (for the second time this week) so I can switch back to "day person" mode again. I really want to put an application in for that production job I've been waiting for, but going to sleep after daybreak and getting up at 6:30pm ain't going to get it done. Hopefully I'll make the change tonight and then I'll go out and, hopefully, get me that job on Friday.

        First Gig Out   Well, I  tried  to nap this afternoon, but I was thinking about the gig and the music too much. It didn't help that Stevie, my loveable-but-dumb gray cat, kept licking my head.   JP came over a little early and we had turkey sandwiches and talked over some of the changes I made. He didn't like the idea of changing things on the very night of the gig, but after we got to practice at Circle and played the songs, with the changes I made, no one had any complaints.   We sounded pretty bad at Circle. Part of it was nerves perhaps, but a lot of it was the room and the P.A. system there. Whatever it was, we weren't gelling and on one song, "Rock This Town", I completely blanked out, forgetting almost all of of the parts to it, everything. Luckily, that was just an alternate song that we weren't going to play unless we needed to stretch it out more. Little did I know...  We played there for about two hours and then headed over to Gasoline Alley, where we were booked to play. We were supposed to start loading our equipment onstage around 10:30 so we could take the stage at 11pm, but they had some difficulties earlier in the night with a previous band's electronic drum kit and we were delayed about 45 minutes.   When we finally got everything set up and ready to play, there were only about 6-8 people in front of us and maybe another 6-8 at the bar, not a big crowd, which was just fine with me. I was sweating profusely and my hands were sticky/sweaty, which is really bad for me because my fingers can't slide over the fretboard as smoothly, they stick. I should've put new strings on my guitar, that would've helped out a lot, and some fret polish would've been a plus as well. You live and learn  We did a soundcheck before we started, to set the levels on the equipment; I thought we were all set to go, so I kicked off the show with "Love The Love You're With". It didn't sound too bad from where I was standing, though it wasn't my best performance ever (my fingers stuck on one part of the solo), but as soon as we finished, the sound guy had to have me turn my amp down because, apparently, I was  way too loud . I just knew that was going to be a problem (Al's amp has to be loud to get decent feedback), but I thought, since it wasn't a problem at soundcheck, it wasn't a problem at all. Again, little did I know...  The next couple of songs were fine, but the sound guy was adjusting and re-adjusting our sound and it was a bit distracting. I thought he turned me down too much and brought JP's acoustic way too high, and then he threw a bunch of reverb on JP's vocals on one song, but finally, about half way through the set, he got the sound down and we did fine. The sound guy said we, the band, progressively got better through the set.   We had a lot of people at the bar rooting for us, and even had some folks dancing on the floor in front of us near the end. JP skipped over one song, "Calling All Angels", and then he did the unthinkable: he introduced "Rock This Town", the song I completely butchered at practice earlier that night. Somehow, don't ask me how, but I fucking  nailed  it. I think it was probably the best performance of that song that I'd ever given. Go figure!  None of us really screwed up too badly tonight. My fingers stuck on one chord change and on the solo to "Love The One You're With", and I slightly flubbed the solo to "Wild Night" (barely noticeable), JP mangled his solo on "Promise You The Moon" (he covered ok though), also, his acoustic guitar disappeared during that song as well (the sound guy's flub). JP played one wrong chord, one time, on "Circle" and I did the exact same thing, one time, on "Sleeping Forever", and I think that's it. Al and Jimmy were great, I don't think they messed up at all.   And man, Jimmy sounds so much better live, behind his own drum kit. Those kits at Circle do nothing for him at all.   We played about an hour and then we hung around after the set, talking to the manager, trying to get a booking for January. It looks like we got two nights, and one of them sounds like it's going to be an absolute  blast !   Not long after I first started playing guitar, I occasionally jammed with Jim Fagan, a really good drummer I met while working at Chilis (back in the mid-late '80's). He went on to join/form a very popular Grateful Dead cover band called "Uncle John's Band", and  that  is who we may be opeing for on one of those gigs! Stylistically, it'd be a great fit for us (tonight we followed a very heavy Heavy Metal band), plus they draw a large crowd, so we'll get more people, music lovers, listening to us. We'll probably throw in a blues number, maybe a jam, some Neil Young perhaps, and I'd really like to do a Hendrix song as well, to play a little more to their crowd.   So anyhow, that's how tonight went. Not a bad night overall!   And now, I have to go and take the trash out, then maybe grab a bite to eat, and then I'll likely chill out a little, until I can sleep. I'm wide awake.

        Just Woke Up & Need A Nap   I stayed up almost all day and night yesterday, finally hitting the sack near 1am. I slept pretty good last night, staying in bed until 11am. I got up, watched TV, ate lunch, set up my music gear in my room and practiced for an hour and a half with Al's amp. Now, just three hours after getting out of bed, I am very sleepy. I need a nap already. Sad, huh?  I got a decent tone out of Al's amp, but I have to turn it up pretty loud to get it. I don't know how loud I can turn up at the club we're playing tonight, so that might be a problem. I want to be able to get a little feedback without having to be totally distorted. Plus, I want a smooth tube sound, not too bright, which is a slight problem playing with a Fender Strat and a Fender amp. I just have to keep playing with the controls.  I also changed the music slightly on one of the covers we're going to be playing tonight ("Love The One You're With"). I like it a lot more now. I just hope the guys can adapt to the change quickly.   I'm going to go and throw some clothes in the washing machine and then I'm going to go take a nap.

         urlLink Monday Mission       1. What in your life used to be fun, but eventually just became a chore that you didn't enjoy?   Right now? Christmas. It'd probably more enjoyable if I had a job and steady income, but all of the money I have due in comes from eBay auctions and I am waiting on a lot of people to make good on their purchases so I'll have some Christmas cash, but it looks like some of them aren't going to pay up (at least not before Christmas), which really fucks up my Christmas plans. Ugh! And then there's my sister, who had money to buy a DVD player and some DVDs a couple of weeks ago, but is talking now about how they barely have any money for presents for the kids (which is her way of saying "you're not getting anything this year either"). It's just a huge fucking hassle.    2. This weekend, US Troops captured Saddam Hussein and now have him in custody. How did you feel when you heard the news? Did it change your mind about the War in Iraq? Did it change your opinion of President Bush?   I thought it was great that he's been captured; now the Iraqis can put aside any fears of him re-gaining control after we leave there. I still think the war was unjustified and handled horribly by the Bush administration. As soon as I heard he'd been captured, I started worrying that Americans will celebrate his capture and forget that we were lied to about why we were going there, that Bush alienated us from former allies with his arrogant foreign policy, that his policy of pre-emption is wrong and illegal, and that our soldiers continue to die there almost every day.    3. What do you think, should US Troops have taken Saddam alive or just killed him when they found him? What would be the pros and cons of either?   They should not have killed him immediately, no. That would be cold-blooded murder since he was unarmed and did not resist. Having him alive allows Iraqis to see him, and believe that he truly has been captured, and allowing them to try him will give them some closure to his bloody reign and a sense of freedom. It's also better for Bush's approval ratings to have him contained. I'm worried by that a bit. I mean, if we manage to find Bin Laden before the next election, I think Bush stands to be re-elected. People forget too easily.    4. What kind of things at Christmas time just scream "tacky" and "White Trash" when you seem them?   The "Jesus Is The Reason For The Season" bumper stickers.    5. Suppose you had a dear friend who calls you in tears because her boyfriend had just left her. They'd been together for nearly 5 years, and one day he announces to her that he is leaving because she had gained too much weight. They were in love, or so she thought, and then out of the blue, he bails and blames it on her weight. What would you say to her about this man?   If you love someone, you look past the other person's faults, you don't abandon the person because of them. It sounds like she's the only one that's  really  in love.   6. Suppose this same friend of yours still thinks she and her ex have a future. She says that she wants another chance, that if he will make some changes, she will to. She really does love him, and assures you that he loves her, even though he wants to "take a break and see other people, but if we were meant to be together we will be." There is even a hint of marriage in their future if they get back together. What advice would you give her?   Pick up the pieces of your heart and move on.   7. Have you ever had to tell a lie to get out of a date or when you were breaking up with someone? What did you tell them and how did they take it? Did they ever find out the truth?   I don't know that I ever lied to get out of a date (a boy/girl date, that is) and  I've  never broken up with anyone.   BONUS: Where are you, Christmas?   Right around the corner.

        Screwed Again In Screwy Screwsville   They say "good things come to those who wait", so I've been waiting for this one particular job to start hiring again, 9am-4pm production work. They put a "now hiring" ad in the paper from time to time, but a month or so has passed since the last one, and I've been waiting for the ad to show up again so I could go in and try to get me a job there... not  just  waiting, but changing my entire sleep schedule around, from "night person" to "day person", in hopes of landing this job.   Well needless to say, time kept passing since the last ad, and since I really didn't  have to  be up in the day for any other reason, and because I have had a lot of sleep trouble at night, I gradually slipped back into my old ways and became a night person again.   Yesterday the company put the ad out.  At 8am, the time I should be  getting up to go to work , I was still awake from the night before. In fact, I didn't fall asleep today until about 11am or so. Fuck me.   Luckily (or not), I was woken up around 1pm by the phone (Al called and said he'd be dropping his amp off for me in about an hour). I showered, and I am up now. I feel like shit, but I am up.  To make my life even more complicated and mind-numbingly ridiculous, I have a gig tomorrow night at 11pm, so my night-owl ways would be a benefit to me in that situation (I'd be up, awake, and fresh), but now that it's almost 2pm today, and seeing how I've only slept an hour or two, I doubt I will be up, awake, and fresh at 11pm tomorrow night since I will probably be in bed by 9pm tonight. This means I will probably start getting sleepy around 9 or 10pm tomorrow night. But, knowing me, I will probably be wide awake and absolutely not ready for sleep  after  the gig (you know, the time I  should  be sleeping). I imagine I'll be up for hours afterward.   Wonderful, just wonderful.

        Sunday Happenings   I slept like crap again, and got up too damn late (3pm), nothing new there.  I learned that Saddam Hussein had been captured overnight, that's good news. I just hope people don't get so caught up in their happiness that they forget how Bush & Co. lied through their teeth to the American people and distanced the USA from the rest of the civilized world just to get him.   Hussein had a crazy Ted Kazinski/Charles Manson beard working for him... nice.  Mom cooked up a killer post-Thanksgiving/pre-Christmas turkey dinner tonight, complete with stuffing, carrots, mashed potatoes, and cranbery sauce! Since I missed out on Thanksgiving dinner this year, this was a real treat for me. She even bought some pecan pie for after dinner! Mmmmm...  I talked to JP today and he liked the set list I came up with. He's going to pass it on to the other guys. Al was supposed to call me tonight (about dropping his amp), but he never did.   I still need to re-string my guitar and put new batteries in my pedal before practice on Tuesday, I want to be ready to play onstage that night. That'll actually be my first real gig with a real band (I jammed with some friends as a goof once), and only the second public performance with this band (we played a friend's Labor Day party). I think I will need a shot of Jack beforehand to ease my nerves (I'm already getting anxious about it).   I hedged about doing more auctions tonight, but I finally decided to do it. I listed about 50 new auctions. Good thing too, because my current auctions tanked. I sold a shitload of $20, $25, and $30 cards for $1 each. Where the hell were all the buyers tonight? Sheesh!   My cassette tape auctions tanked too. I sold 16 tapes, for a total of $22.75, which is horrible considering I had 58 end with no bids. The listing fees for all of these came to $22.20, but lest you think I actually made a $0.55 profit, the tapes I sold cost me about $5.60, so I lost $5.05 on them. I'm going to have to come up with some other, less costly, way of selling them.

        Saturday    Boy, today has been a fairly shitty day for me. It started off horribly, with me lying in bed awake since around 9am (I'd only gone to bed at 5am). I got up, ate a bagel, got my mailings ready to mail (Mom mailed them for me when she went out), and went back to bed, where I struggled to sleep again. I got up around 4pm, not exactly a bundle of energy.   JP called me this afternoon and said we are definitely *on* for playing out Tuesday night. We are going to practice at Circle for an hour and a half before we head over to the club and set-up. Al is supposed to call me tomorrow about dropping his amp off here, so I should have plenty of time to set it up the way I need it. Very cool!   I took some time this afternoon and made up an hour-long set list, still pending approval of the other guys. Here's what we'll likely be playing:  "Love The One You're With", "Stuck In The Middle", "Promise You The Moon" (an original), "Old Apartment", "Before You Accuse Me", "Circle" (an original), "American Girl", "Wild Night", "Sleeping Forever" (original), "Cold Shot", "Calling All Angels", "Rock This Town", and "I Wanna Be Sedated".   That should be about an hour's worth of music.    JP was supposed to call me back tonight to go over the list, but he hasn't. Grrr!!!!  For most of the night, I was in my room cleaning again, straightening things up, throwing things out, etc... It's still a freaking mess though, go figure.

        Shelved   Mom, who had just come home from work, told me about a yard sale in the park and wanted to see if I wanted go and have look at it. Of course I did! I'm glad I did too, I found a metal stand-up shelf (the kind with the holes in the metal strips that you can adjust to whatever size you want), which is just what I needed for my room! It looks almost new too! The cost: $3.00. What a deal!   The only sucky part was that I had to lug it from the back of the park to the front of the park on my shoulders (it wouldn't fit in Mom's car). I'm way out of shape, but I made it just fine.   I have one of these kinds of shelves already that I keep my CDs on and I've been wanting one specifically for my Jimi Hendrix CDs. The one I already have is actually  two  shelving units, but since CDs are small, I made the space between the shelves small and used up all of the shelves from both units (I hope that makes sense).  So... I spent most of the night working on my new Hendrix shelves, spacing them out to where I want them and making cardboard & duct tape slats on the sides to hold the CDs in (and keep them from getting scratched from the screws).   It took a lot longer than it should have. One screw was stripped and I couldn't get it out, so I had to change all of the spacing after I'd changed them all, and then, later, I got the stripped screw out and then had to change the spacing all over again! What a huge pain in the ass!  While I was working on my little project, I had both cats in my room watching me work, sleeping, grooming each other, playing with stuff, getting into stuff they shouldn't, and getting underfoot. I don't know whether they're more cute or annoying.   Anyhow, I finally have the shelves set-up the way I want them, I just need to make a few more slats and I'm done working on it! In fact, I already have it loaded with Hendrix CDs! This'll give me room to add even more Hendrix CDs to my collection (yes, I actually still need some) and more room to add other CDs to the other shelf (I have a lot of Hendrix CDs there too). Sweet!   On a different topic, JP called me tonight and said we were invited to audition at a local bar/music club next Tuesday night. Another band cancelled and the guy offered the spot to us (45 minutes). JP really wants to do it, and I told him I'd do it if 1) we practice one night prior to that night or earlier that night (the audition/spot isn't until 11pm-11:30pm) or 2) have Al let me borrow his amp before that night. See, the problem I have is that I will be using Al's amp to play out (until I get my own) and I haven't had a chance to get the settings to where I want them and I don't want to try and do it while I'm onstage, auditioning. We may not do it anyway though, JP said Jimmy, the drummer, is hedging about it. Not good.   I don't know if I'm going to bed tonight or not. I don't really have anything to do tomorrow, just package and mail out three or four packages, and I have a mess going in my room, My bed is filled with books and I'd really like to get it together now, while I have the energy. However, I know that the energy will disappear shortly after daybreak, leaving me stuck. I guess we shall see...

        eBay Fun   I just remembered why I don't like to run a lot of auctions on eBay: more chances for problems to occur.  Right now, I have a guy from the Phillipines asking where his card is...again. I think he's going to want a refund, but I clearly state in my auctions that I can not guarantee international delivery unless they choose to use Registered Airmail and he did not choose to do so. I shipped the card very well-protected and I used the address he supplied. I don't think I should have to be out the card, the packaging materials, the eBay fees, the postage for the first package, the postage for the refund, and be out the refund itself. It just doesn't seem right. Is it me?   To make matters worse, his emails keep bouncing back to me undelivered because his account has "exceeded quota". Wonderful.   I also have another guy who has apparently committed bank fraud and now his Paypal payment to me has been reversed. I lose everything on this one unless he decides to make good. I sent him an email asking him to do just that, but if he's committing bank fraud, it's unlikely he's going to pay me on principle alone.  I also had a guy from South Korea put "@" in his address, I guess he figured I should know that "@" stands for "apartment".   I did not know that.   Yay! eBay fun! Yay!

         urlLink The Friday Five     1. Do you enjoy the cold weather and snow for the holidays?   Living in Florida, it's often difficult to tell one season from another, so when cold weather rolls in, it does feel more Wintery, which is perfect for the holidays, where you go inside, with your family gathered around, to be warm.    2. What is your ideal holiday celebration? How, where, with whom would you celebrate to make things perfect?   It'd have to be back up home in Pennsylvania, preferably at my Grandfather's house, with my whole family gathered around, and a light snowfall outside.    3. Do you do have any holiday traditions?   We go up to my sister's house usually. My own tradition was getting to wake the kids up, but last year, the boys were already up.    4. Do you do anything to help the needy?   I donate clothes and stuff to Goodwill and the Vietnam Veterans of America, but that's about it. It's not that I wouldn't want to do more, but I haven't been financially stable for years, so when I get any extra money, it usually goes to bills and spending a little on me and my family. I haven't had a job since April and I'm not far away from being needy myself.    5. What one gift would you like for yourself?   A job and/or an amplifier.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  I listed about 80 tapes on eBay last weekened and I listened to about 5 minutes of each one. I listened to the whole Black Crowes "The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion" tape though, one of my favorites. I also had on Fleetwood Mac's 1975 self-titled tape on the other night when I was listing cards, another great album.     Watching on TV:  Still watching mostly "judge shows": "The People's Court", "Judge Mathis", "Divorce Court", "Judge Joe Brown", and "Judge Judy". I also watch "Family Feud" as well (it's sandwiched between judge shows). I've been working most every night this week (eBay stuff) so I haven't been watching my usual night time shows (I usually turn the TV off when I work). Later at night, I've been watching "Tough Crowd w/ Colin Quinn" and Howard Stern's E! Show as well.  I finally watched "From Dusk To Dawn" this week, at last! It wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be, but some parts were really cool. (Salma Hayek dancing, the beginning in the store, Salma Hayek just standing there, etc..). Did I mention Salma Hayek? Woo hoo!   Downloading:  I haven't really been downloading anything lately.   Reading:  I haven't been reading anything lately.     Jamming:  I haven't jammed lately (see post below).    Working:  Still not working.   Buying:  I haven't bought anything lately, other than some card supplies that I needed (for my auctions).   Selling:  I have a ton of auctions running this week, cards and tapes,not a whole lot of movement yet though. I'm also still waiting on one guy to send his payment from two weeks ago (about $40). I'm depending on that money for Christmas.    Eating:  I've been eating baloney sandwiches w/chips for lunch. For dinner, we had pork and sauerkraut w/ mashed potatoes this week (the sauerkraut was gross), we had steak last night (T-Bones) and I had rice and mushrooms with it. Tonight I had some fried clams at AJs Sports Pub (see post below). I've been drinking too much soda again. I need to go back to having it on weekends only.    Feeling:  Tired. I stay in bed too long, but I don't get enough sleep.     Planning:  I'm hoping to have some Christmas money in by the weekend and then I can start shopping!   I still need to find a job too.

        The Band Practice That Wasn't   Goddamn it. JP called me a few minutes before he was to pick me up for practice to tell me that Jimmy, the drummer, cancelled out tonight (his kids are sick). Neither of us were very happy about trhat all, but I said "whatever, let's just go and have a fun jam tonight". By the time he got here (he was running late), Al, our bassist, had already showed up at the practice studio and left. It turns out, they lost the key to the room we booked and couldn't get the door open. There also weren't any other rooms available, so we were screwed all the way around. The three of us met here and decided to go somewhere, sit down and talk.   We went over to AJ's Sports Pub and have some beer and appetizers (I had fried clams) and discussed music, sports, women, and other stuff. We had a good time, lots of joking, but we also got serious and discussed the band. We are all concerned that Jimmy isn't taking the band as seriously as we need him to, though we all understand he has other, more important priorities in his life. I guess we're going to see how it goes and play it by ear. I think we're all anxious to be making more progress and frustrated that we're going so slowly.  Regardless, tonight was pretty much a wash, and another two weeks will have passed between band practices. Not good.

         urlLink What's On... Wednesday     What's On your wish list Right Now?   I really, really need a new combo amplifier, a Marshall preferably. I really want the newer Jimi Hendrix CD releases that I don't have yet too (""Paris 1967/San Francisco 1968", "Axis Outtakes", and "Noel Redding - The Experience Sessions").   More? No problem!   I need clothes badly; more pants, more shorts, some nice shirts, and some underwear that actually fit. I want more tie-dye shirts too (they rock).   Still more? You got it!   I would love to get a DVD player, a bike, I need new speakers for my stereo (one is blown), a couple of new guitars (an Epiphone or Gibson SG and a  Fender American Startocaster w/ a Floyd Rose) would be nice.   Not enough? Here's more!  I could use a car, a new home, and a million dollars. A good job and a girlfriend would be nice too.    Too much, huh?  Honestly, I'd be happy with some new CDs.

        Busy Night   I spent almost all night working on my auctions, pulling and scanning about 80 cards, listing about 50 of them, and then I packaged up a bunch of cards to be mailed tomorrow... whew!  I'm going to try and list another 50 tomorrow night, about 35 are scanned already. I'm really trying to do what I can to have a great Christmas this year; last year was pretty lame.  I listed about 70 cassette tapes over the weekend and they're not doing so hot. So far, I only have bids on about 4 of them (for $1 each). Yikes!  I have a headache that's been coming and going all night. It feels like it's coming again.

        Cats In The Tub   They're ba-ack! I went to take a shower today, and almost as soon as I turned the water on, Jimmy (my big black & white cat) zipped into the bathroom and jumped up on the rim of the tub (his brother, Stevie, joined him there, eventually, but just for a little bit). They haven't joined me for a shower for a long while now, ever since I gave them both baths a few months ago.   Just like old times, Jimmy sat on the ledge and swatted the curtain when I aimed the shower head at him (I could see his shadow behind the curtain), almost falling in at times. He poked his head in a bunch of times to see what was doing, and he drank water that dripped from my fingertips, with his tongue shooting in and out very quickly... too funny!  I have pictures of both of them playing on the edge of the tub (from a while back), but I don't know how to post them here. I should try and figure that out.   That reminds me, their previous owner came by to see my Mom last night and she was surprised by how big they'd gotten and how cute they loooked. She kept calling them by the names she'd given them, which irritated me a bit (she knows they'd been renamed), and she reeked so badly of cigarettes that my eyes were actually burning from being around her. I can't imagine how the cats felt, living in her smoke filled house, especially since they were just kittens then. Nice.

        Sleep Blues   My box fan quit working yesterday, so instead of doing the smart thing and replacing it with the other box fan we have, I turned on my overhead ceiling fan/light and cranked it. Now, to get the fan to work without lighting my room, I have to unscrew the lightbulb a little. So... I must've unscrewed it too much, because at some point during the night/morning/afternoon, I felt something hard and round near my thighs (no, it wasn't  that ) and it was kept bothering me. The logical thing would have been to grab it and remove it from my bed, but being half asleep and extremely tired, I didn't do that, not until hours later when I discovered that it was a lightbulb.   Besides dropping a lightbulb on me, the ceiling fan kept making noise all night/morning/afternoon long, like a loud clock ticking away. Again, the logical and sane thing would have been to get up and turn the fan down to a lower setting, which, again, I didn't do.   I didn't get a whole lot of sleep last night, not good sleep anyway. I stayed in bed until about 3pm today, to make up for the sleep loss at night.   I still think I'm on my "day schedule", I haven't admitted to going back to being a night owl just yet, because I'm going to bed early enough most nights, but I just don't sleep after I've gone to bed.   Anyone who reads my blog, and I think there may one or two who do, is probably tired of heasring about my sleep problems (I know I'm tired of having them). I continue to write about them for myself, to look back on and try to see what is wrong and what might be causing the problems, also to see how long a period I go through this stuff.   I'm just sorry it's all so boring. Why couldn't I have a cooler problem, like being so filthy rotten stinking rich that I don't know what to do with myself?

        This Sucks Ass   I don't know if I even slept at all last night. I don't think I did. I went to bed too damn late (4am) and then I had a rough time in bed again, just couldn't get comfortable, I was too hot (we had the heat on in the house), and then my sinuses started acting up again and my head got stuffy. To make matter worse, around 9:30am my box fan started squealing and by 10am, it died completely. There was no trying to go back to sleep for me. I feel like shit.   I don't think I'm going to do anything today, except maybe watch TV and sit around waiting for bedtime.

        Sunday   I slept in late again, this time until 1:30pm. Same problem again too: I had trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. My sinuses were bothering me a lot, which didn't help I'm sure.   Mom brought home some lunch today, a Chicken Caesar sandwich and a chili from Burger King and a potato from Arbys. Perfect cold weather food!  After lunch, I started working on eBay auctions, continuing to list cassette tapes. I worked pretty much the entire day, stopping only long enough to eat supper (we ordered pizza and wings from Dino's). I think I have about 80 tapes listed now, most of my A's and B's. I still have a ton to list. I think I may just see how these do before I commit to listing anymore. I'm going to list some basketball card auctions on Tuesday, just to make sure I have something coming in for sure. I have ennpough due in to cover my monthly bills, so whatever I make from here until Christmas I can use to buy presents with! Yay!  I still haven't gotten any Christmas lists from my sister's kids. I've been asking for one for over a week now. Must be nice to be so young and have everything you want already.    It is pretty chilly outside, about 50 degrees, and I love it! I only wish it would snow, but living in Florida, I know that is highly unlikely. Although... there was one night back in the late 1980's, when I was working at Sizzlers... I actually got to walk home from work with snow falling down all around me. It was beautiful, reminded me of back home in Pennsylvania. It's a memory that I will always cherish.

        Saturday   I "slept" until after Noon today, had a rough time sleeping again last night. I was woken up several times from the stupid phone ringing and when I finally got out of bed, I had a terrible headache. Not a good start to the day.  After messing with my stupid computer for a while (I had start-up problems again), I got all of my mailings ready. A little later, Mom and I headed out to the Post Office.  We stopped off at a yard sale on the way. We had to go inside to check out a desk they (the two women who lived there) were selling (Mom's looking for a computer desk) and as usual, I checked out their music collection (lots of Indigo Girls tapes) as we walked past it to go to the room with the desk in it. I also saw they had a drumkit, a keyboard and a guitar set up in one area of their house. I asked if they had a band or played out but they were kind of vague about it. I still don't what instruments the one lady, who appeared to be the actual musician, plays. After we left, my Mom thought she had to point out to me that they were lesbians... well *duh*... not that I care one way or the other, but I figured it out myself almost as soon as I walked in the door.   After I finished up at the Post office and Mom finished shopping at Ace, we decided to hit a Goodwill. On the way, we stopped off at an indoor flea market and I bought a few tapes and a paperback book. I bought two Bryan Adams tapes, his first album "Bryan Adams" and "You Want It, You Got It", his second album (I'd never heard his first album and I like his second one). I also picked up Dennis DeYoung's "Desert Moon" album (only because it has a Hendrix cover on it) and a Geroge Carlin tape, "Back In Town". I paid $0.50 each for them, the same price I paid for the book, Stephen King's "Desperation". I have the book already in hardcover, but I prefer to read paperbacks (they're easier to manage in bed). It wasn't my most impressive haul, that's for sure.   Mom's feet hurt so we decided to go home instead of going to Goodwill. On the way home, we stiopped at Orange Blossom Groves to get some orange/vanilla ice cream, but they were sold out. Mom got an ice cream cone there. I got a strawberry sundae at the McDonald's near home.   I spent the rest of the night scanning and listing cassette tapes on eBay. They really take up a lot more time than cards do. I spent two and a half hours and only got 18 tapes listed! That sucks.   Part of the problem is that I had to listen to a little of each tape before I listed it (I don't want to send anyone a defective tape). What  really  sucked about that, is that I had to listen to some really crappy music (Paual Abdul... ick!).   This is the first time I've listed tapes for sale on eBay, so I have no idea how I'm going to do with them. I know some won't sell at all, but if I can average $1 each, I will be happy.   Tomorrow, I will be scanning and listing cards all afternoon and evening. I may list some more tapes as well. I would like to put up about 15-20 tapes a day, every day for the next week. I guess I'll see how it goes.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  I had Deep Purple's "Machine Head" CD on the other day, that's about it.    Watching on TV:  Mostly "judge shows": "The People's Court", "Judge Mathis", "Divorce Court", "Judge Joe Brown", and "Judge Judy" and usually "Family Feud" as well. Later on, I/m still watching "The Simpsons", "Everybody Loves Raymond"and "Seinfeld". I caught "Tough Crowd" a few times this week, but they're still on re-runs (seems like they hardly ever make new ones, which is quite lame for a "topical" show).    Downloading:  I won a batch of tapes on eBay that includes one by Blodwyn Pig, a band I'd never really heard before, so I tried downloading some of their stuff to check them out. Unfortunately, I was only able to get one song, "Dear Jill" which is pretty nice. It's on the tape I won, so I'm looking forward to hearing more from it.    Reading:  Nothing. I'm too messed up at bed time, between my sinuses and my sleep problems (they're back), to read. I still haven't figured out how to just chill out and read during the day.     Jamming:  We practiced yesterday (see the post below). It was a pretty loose, somewhat fun practice (even though there were a few moments of frustration throughout).    Working:   I'm checking the papers and looking online, but I haven't found anything yet.   Buying:  As mentioned earlier, I bought a lot of tapes on eBay, 12 of them for $6.25 (includes shipping). The tapes I won are:  The Doors "Greatest Hits", Blodwyn Pig "Ahead Rings Out", Traffic "The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys", Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young "Deja Vu", The Yardbirds "A Compleat Collection", Elton John "Madman Across the Water", The Band "The Band", The Eagles "Their Greatest Hits, 1971-75", Led Zeppelin "IV", Prince and the Revolution "Purple Rain" (I think I have 5 copies of this one now), The Beach Boys "Made in USA", and Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band "Live/1975-85" (only 1 tape from the set).   Selling:  Did well last week, looks like it's back to normal this week though : (     Eating:  Over the weekend, when the kids were down, we had waffles for breakfasts, we had chicken cordon bleu and Popeye's fried chicken (with rice & beans and mashed potatoes & gravy) for dinners, and I ate leftover Popeye's for lunches.   No breakfasts during the week. For lunches I've been eating Balogna and Cheese "sammiches" or chili and rice. For dinners, we had Publix Chicken one night then chili and rice the last few. I've been drinking too much soda again. Today I went out back and picked some grapefruit. I put sugar on it, so I don't know if it's still good for me or not. Maybe I should've tried it with Equal.    Feeling:  Exausted. Not sleeping at night is wearing me down mentally and physically.   Planning:  To get a job, but also to try and have a nice Christmas this year.

        Band Practice    I felt weird going into tonight's practice, almost dreading it. I don't really know why either. On the way to Circle, JP and I argued/discussed politics and the state of the world today. His company laid off a bunch of people this week, so near Christmas, and that pretty much set me off. We argued/discussed stuff while we set up, ending only after Al got there. I think JP has begun to lean more to the right nowadays. He didn't like laying people off but he says "it's just business". I think it's bad business, totally unfair and unethical. But whatever...  It was a pretty good practice, we got a lot done and we didn't screw up too much. We ran through sets 3 and 1 and did some jamming in between and at the beginning of the practice. I started with my Blues in F, which I normally play slide on, but it kind of went nowhere since JP didn't try making up lyrics and sing on it. I threw out a new one I came up with as well, it's a rock song in E (E-D-w/riff E-G-A). I had the riff already, but I made up the chorus for it on the spot. JP came up with some lyrics and a melody for the Chorus which sounded pretty good. We need to work on this one some more, add one more section or something.   I think I pissed Jimmy, the drummer, off tonight. I had him change what he was playing on JP's "Promise You The Moon" last week and he forgot about the change, so I had to stop the music and remind him. He didn't remember any changes and I tried to it explain to him. I think he was getting frustrated, I know I was. Meanwhile, JP's face was all scrunched up like he had no idea what I was talking about. Ugh! Sometimes talking music is like speaking in a foreign language.   After practice, we sat around bullshitting and decided to add two new songs to our setlists: Elvis Costello's "What's So Funny About Peace Love & Understanding" and The White Stripes' "About A Girl". I'll have to work on them this week. We practice again next Thursday.  It doesn't look like we're going to play out at all this month. I'm not sure what the problem is, I know Jimmy has some things to do, but I guess it's ok. We're close to being ready, but we're not entirely there yet, so the extra practice time won't hurt.   I still need to get an amp for myself. Al didn't bring his this week so I had to use the Peavey they had there (which I like). It's rough though, because I never know what I'm going to play from week to week and I have to try and get the settings set to where I like them every time out, starting from scratch, and a lot of the time, I never really get the settings where I want them.    I should learn Spinal Tap's "Big Bottom" for next week's practice. Al and I were joking about it tonight. It'd be a pretty funny song to cover.

         urlLink 3 For Thursday     Have you ever...    1. Failed 3 classes in one quarter?   Yeah, back in High School, when I became a total slacker. I failed because I quit showing up for classes. I quit showing up for classes because I felt like an outcast, like I didn't fit in.   2. Had to work your butt off in a class to get the grade you want? If you can, name 3 classes and talk about it if you'd like.   Yep, a couple years ago when I went to junior college. I suck at Algebra so I had to bust my ass to get a B in that class. It was actually the only class I didn't get an A in and the only class I didn't really enjoy.   Too bad I didn't have that work ethic in High School.     3. What 3 classes don't you/didn't you like?   I always hated Algebra and Geometry, mainly because I didn't/don't understand them. I don't know if it's me or if I just never had the right teachers. I also disliked Physical Education. Not because I have anything against sports or PE in general, but because I'd get picked on mercilessly every day and it became something I dreaded.

        Ho Hum   Not much to write about the last few days. I've been sleeping poorly at night, leaving me with almost no energy all day long. I pretty much sat around the house the last few days doing nothing.   The poor sleeping at night has also been hurting my sleep schedule. I got up at 11am on Monday, 10am on Tuesday, but not until after Noon today. I have had to have the heat on and it's been getting too warm in my room at night. I move the thermostat back a little and it's too cold... we really need a digital thermostat, ours is too hit-and-miss    On a positive note, my current bills are paid and I paid Mom back some of the money I owed her (I still owe her $200).   I would love to pay Mom her $200 before Christmas. I put my speaker cabinet up for sale already (to try and get Mom's money), but I haven't gotten any calls about it since I posted it 2 weeks ago. So... I'm going to try and get to the flea market this Sunday and get a booth or I may just list cards on Saturday and Sunday this week, instead of just on Sunday.    In the meantime, I think I'm going to take $25 and send it to that guy I still owe for the Ben Harper ticket. I think he'd appreciate the money, especially now, so close to Christmas.   I have enough due in right now to cover my Gateway bill (due in 10 days), so I should be able to buy Christmas gifts with whatever I get from selling on eBay the next two weeks.   Hopefully, there will be some job openings after the holidays, I'm getting awfully tired of scraping by. I'm still looking, but just haven't been able to find anything that works for me.

         urlLink Monday Mission       1. Those paper toilet seat covers in public bathrooms, do you use them?   Sometimes. depends on how clean the bathroom is and how big of a hurry I am.   2. What is on your Christmas Wish List for Santa to bring?   I don't have a list. Since my sister started her "Christmas is just for the kids" shit, there's been gift giving on my part, but not a lot of gift  receiving  on my part. What I get for Christmas, I get from my mom and I don't expect much from her since I already owe her a small fortune. She usually gets me a few CDs, which is just fine with me (I'm very easy to shop for).     3. What did you accomplish in the month of November?    I got my sleep schedule semi-normalized. I went from being a night person to being a day person, which I needed to do in order to find a day job. Not much of an accomplishment, but it's something.   4. Have you ever snuck into someplace that you shouldn't have? Tell me about that.    Not that I can recall. The closest thing I can think of is when I was a kid, I'd sneak out of bed and watch "Saturday Night Live" from the hallway whenever my parents would have it on (back when the original cast was still on).    5. Do you recall the first internet meme you participated in? How did you come to find out about it? Do you still participate? Why or why not?    I believe it was this one, and yes, obviously, I am still participating. A friend of a friend did the Monday Mission all of the time and I thought it was pretty cool (still do, I suppose).   6. Do you have any favorite internet or "streaming" radio programs or music channels you wish were available in your car or on a portable radio?   Sure, most of them would be better than my local radio. Spinner has some great channels, so does Brighthouse (my cable TV company).   7. Ever been skinny dipping? What's the story there?   Yup, when I was a teenager. Me and some of my friends snuck into a neighboring apartment complex and swam naked there late at night. I think it was me, two other guys, and a girl, but only us guys got naked. That night, I learned that 1) diving into a pool while nude hurts and 2) shrinkage is not cool.   BONUS: What's cooler than being cool?   Being cool plus one.

        Sunday   I slept in  late  today, too late, getting up around 12:30pm. Not good. I finally have my sleep schedule relatively under control and I don't want to go slipping back again.  Anyways, I got up, I ate some leftover waffles for "breakfast", and I shared a grapefruit with Austin (we got it off the tree out back yesterday). I  never  eat grapefruit. I don't think I've eaten any since I was a kid. It wasn't as sour as I'd expected. I could probably eat it again... as long as I have some sugar to put on it.   After "breakfast", I took the boys outside to shoot the BB gun again. We were having fun until I had to penalize Jesse for mishandling the BB gun. He was careless and pointed it towards me and Austin and I am strict about gun safety with them. Even if it is a dumb little BB gun, I want them to be careful. He lost a turn and so he started pouting and then didn't want to shoot anymore, so we quit.   I tried playing football with them again, but they started arguing and fighting too much so I ended the game and went in.   Inside, we ate some italian ices and annoyed my mom (with the scraping). The boys were being ok then, but then they started getting hyper and began getting on my nerves.   I said something earlier to Mom about them going home before 5pm, since I had eBay work tonight, and she wound up taking them home even earlier, around 3pm, which was wonderful. I didn't have to jump on them and they left in a good mood.   I sent the "MicroCosmos" video home with Austin, he wanted to watch it again, but Jess already had football on. I also sent up a book for my sister to read ("Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee"). She'd wanted to borrow it before.   Before the boys left, while we were outside playing, Mom said Stevie, the dumber of my two cats was going nuts with a bag around him and that both he and his brother were hiding, scared, for some reason. As soon as the kids left, I went looking for them to find out what that was about. Jimmy came out on his own, but Stevie stayed under my bed. When I went to get him out, he ran out and then shot all over the house like a maniac, with a plastic bag attached to him, and with Jimmy running away from him, scared shitless. I cornered Stevie and took the bag off him (he got his head caught in one of the handles) and then I pet him for a few minutes to calm him down. I think he must have pissed himself or something because his hind end was wet. He must have been really freaked out. He was ok for a bit then he went and hid inside Mom's recliner and stayed there almost all night. That poor little dumbass.  My auctions did pretty darn good this week... I am thrilled! If the ones I listed tonight do good this coming week (I put up 80 of them tonight), and if the ones I list next week do good, I should be able to pay my bills  and  buy Christmas presents for my family! Yay! Not having a job yet still, that sure would take a load off my mind.  I guess I'm going to be heading to bed now. It's been a busy weekend and I'm pretty much wiped out. Besides, it's getting late and I don't want to sleep in past noon again tomorrow.

        Friday/Saturday   After we picked up my niece, we headed out looking for somewhere to eat dinner. Ultimately, we decided on Red Lobster... yay! I had the Steak and Shrimp Alfredo Pasta and an order of jumbo cocktail shrimp that I ate with my Casear salad. It was an excellent dinner, almost too good. I was going to have the Steak and Lobster, but it was more expensive and I didn't want to go nuts with Mom paying the bill and all so I ordered what I did. Of course, Mom went and ordered the Steak and Lobster for herself... d'oh! I can't wait until I start getting a paycheck and can buy the dinners; we'll probably do Red Lobster once a month.  After we chowed, we came home and I looked online for an ACT test for Dana (my niece). I did one or two practice exams (English) with her. I did pretty good, probably about 90%, Dana did much worse, probably 50%. It's a good thing she has plenty of time to work on them.   We went to bed fairly early last night, just after 11pm... we were all pretty tired. Dana slept out on the couch with the electric blanket and I went to my own bed and closed my door, which was a mistake. Those stinkin' cats of mine kept scratching at the door and trying to break in all night and all morning. I didn't sleep very well and finally got up around 10:30am, tired and grouchy. I originally woke up around 7am, which was good and bad. Bad because I hadn't slept enough, but good because it tells me that my internal clock is adapting to my new routine of getting up in the mornings.  The first thing I did this morning was shower, then I ate quiche with Mom and Dana (Mom had it made for us before we woke up). I told Dana to get ready to go then I got my two lone eBay mailings ready and waited for her and my Mom. I'd wanted to head out around 11am, but Dana took over an hour to get ready to go and so that didn't happen. We finally left sometime around 12:40pm, right when it started raining. It rained all day today (and it's still pouring outside as I type this).  I mailed my stuff at the Post Office, waited around for them some more in the craft store, waited even more at Publix, then we were finally off to do some good stuff. We stopped at that pawn shop on Missouri again and I bought 3 videos ("The Best Of Mike Myers on SNL", "Naked Gun 2 1/2", and "When Harry Met Sally", which I got mainly for Dana) and 1 DVD ("Saving Private Ryan"). It should have cost me $10.70 for all of them, but I had a dumb cashier, and after overcharging me (which I corrected), he undercharged me. I paid $8.56 for everything. Awesomeness!  After that we ran over to this one music shop that was closing down. I was hoping to get some CD steals but pretty much everything had been picked over by then. I did get some good cassettes though. I got 5 cassettes out of a freebie box: INXS "Welcome To Wherever You Are", Maria McKee "Maria McKee", Midnight Oil "Blue Sky Mining", Psychedelic Furs "Midnight To Midnight", and O.V. Wright 'Memory Blues", which was still sealed! I should have taken more. I should have taken the whole box. I bought 12 new tapes too, for about $2.15 each, and most appear to be remastered! I got AC/DC "For Those About To Rock (We Salute You)" (one of the new Epic remasters), Tony Bennett "All-Time Greatest Hits", Blood, Sweat, and Tears "Greatest Hits", Bob Dylan "Time Out Of Mind", George Jones "16 Biggest Hits", Willie Nelson "Red Headed Stranger", Santana "Gteatest Hits", Styx "Pieces Of Eight", Peter Tosh "Legalize It", Warren Zevon "Excitable Boy" and "Quiet Normal Life: The Best Of Warren Zevon" (my Mom said "Who's he?"), and ZZ Top "The Best Of ZZ Top".   After we went left there we tried to have lunch at the M  We stopped at Orange Blossom Groves after that and picked up some orange/vanilla ice cream. Sweet! We went home, dropped off the ice cream, I changed shirts (that Big N Tasty dripped on it) and we headed out to the movies.  JP is a dickhead. I asked him if there was anything in "Along Came Polly" that would be unsuitable or that I'd be uncomfortable watching with my young niece and my mother. He said it was safe, and since it was PG-13, I thought it'd be a good one to take them to... what a dickhead. One scene has Aniston on top of Stiller, riding him while he tries to extend his lovemaking to 5 minutes, another has Stiller catching his wife in the act of screwing his scuba instructor, you see both Hank Azaria and Ben Stiller's bare asses in the movie... very nice family viewing. Thanks, JP.   Other than the uncomfortableness I felt watching some of it with Dana and my Mom, I like the movie alright and laughed out loud and very hard at certain scenes. Phillip Seymour Hoffman was hilarious, as was Ben Stiller, but the ending was a bit hack. You see coming from a mile off, mainly because you've seen it so many times before. It's your standard romantic-comedy ending.   After we got home from the movies, Dana and I watched my new Mike Myers tape while Mom cooked up some taco salad for dinner. They went back to Mom's room after dinner to do some crafts. Dana's tired, I don't think she's going to be up much longer. I'm ready for bed myself. I'm tired from not sleeping well all week and then with this rainy weather... zzzzzzzzzzzz.

        Another Long Day (But Not So Rough)   It seemed like I slept better last night, but I've been tired and dragging all day. I slept until 7:30am, layed in bed for another 10 minutes, got up, had breakfast, shaved (no shower), and took the later bus in to work. I got there about 2 or 3 minutes late.   I ran into Santana on the way and in talked to him for a minute. He asked if I was busy on Sundays (the day his band usually jams). I'd love to get some extra playing time in, but I have no way of getting myself back and forth from his warehouse.   I got right to work after I got in, doing as much as I could with the material I had provided me. JP got in around 10-10:30am this morning and he figured out what the problem with the material was and I went and finished the reports. I had him get me another report to do later on and I did that one as well. I only had to look at my notes maybe once or twice today (I'm catching on to things ok).   JP and I went out for lunch again today. We were going to go to Subway, but we wound up Carmelita's. I'd never been before but he had and liked it a lot. I had my usual Mexican restaurant favorite: Chili Rellenos,  but  this time I had it Con Carne, with shredded beef... mmmmm. Too good! The rice was real good too. I'll have to go back there again.   We stayed for about an hour I'd guess. To make up for the long lunch, I stayed a little over an hour late today, til 4:15pm.  More later, Mom and I are heading up to New Port Richey to pick up my niece.

        Long, Rough Day   I didn't sleep very well again, I have no idea how much sleep I got, but I'm sure it's less than 7 hours because I've been dragging all day.   JP picked me up for work (he stopped here to drop off his equipment) and I got to work 3 minutes late. The first three hours of the day I did very little, but then JP had me learn how to do this one report (formatting it, doing formulas for the numbers and percentages) on Excel and the rest of my day was Hell. Well not entirely, the learning part was tough, but after I got the hang of it it was ok. Later though, I found problems with some of the reports (not my doing) and it got to be Hell again.   I think I took a 45-minute lunch today. JP took me over to his ALF (Assisted Living Facility) and we ate lunch over there. We had what they called "Chicken Pot Pie" but it wasn't like any pot pie I ever had (no crust, too many veggies, a mushy biscuit topping). It really wasn't my type of food at all. Old people food.   I stayed an extra 2 1/2 hours today and rode home from work with JP. I ate dinner (Mom made that killer fish, Tilapia, again) before I split for practice. I offered JP some, but he wanted Subway instead.   Practice sucked. Al was the only one who rehearsed and learned the new songs we were supposed to work on ("I'm Tore Down", "Desire", and "What's So Funny About Peace, Love and Understanding"). We had to go outside several times to listen to the songs on CD. I think we almost have "I'm Tore Down", but the others are pretty rough.  My playing was awful tonight. I just didn't have any gas. I lost my rhythm constantly, which is doom for me. I kept playing the most bland solos ever too... pretty bad stuff.   I introduced a new song of mine tonight, a fast blues, and we jammed on it awhile. JP came up with some lyrics, but they weren't too great.   We ran through some cover songs we hadn't done in a while ("You May Be Right", "All For You", "The Difference", "Calling All Angels", and "I Got Loaded"). We did a reggae version of "Calling All Angels"... just for the heck of it. It sounded ok, but it was just too slow, lifeless. Kind of like me tonight.   I hope I get my sleep worked out soon, this 2-6 hours a night is killing me. I  need  at least 8. I'm already going to get less than 8 tonight, probably less than 7 again.   *sigh*  I guess it could be worse. I could have a kidney stone like JP.   Oh... I thought I was going to get paid tomorrow but I'm not. I will get paid on Monday, which blows. I have my niece coming down to spend the weekend and I thought I'd have some spending money when she's down. I will have to borrow a bit from Mom (I sent out a check for $50 on Wednesday that needs to be covered A.S.A.P.). I'm not sure how many days I'll get paid for on this check either, it could more than two days, which would be wonderful, but then again, it might not.   *sigh*  Alright, I'm going to bed.

        Productive Day   I got about six hours of sleep last, not quite enough, but more than I had been getting. I got up about 7:20am, ate, shaved, showered, and got ready for work in time to catch the early bus. I got to work just before 8:30am this morning.   JP came in late today (doctor's appointment), so I was stuck there by myself for most of the day. The first hour and a half I did nothing basically, just surfed the net and listened to my Black Sabbath "Masters Of Reality" tape. I was waiting on some files to arrive via email, it would have given me some work to do, but it never came. After a while I got bored and went to look for something to do, anything.   I remembered that JP and I were asked to open up two rows of phone cubicles, making sure they were set up with working phones and headsets, so I went and did that. It took a while to do and was more work than it sounds. I did more than I was asked to do to, taking down the papers and leftover personal effects from the cubicle walls, switching out filthy mousepads for cleaner ones, and putting blue chairs in every cubicle. I showed JP after he got there and he said I shouldn't do extra stuff or they'll take advantage of me. Everyone said I did a good job though, so that was cool.   Towards the end of the day I got a bunch of work handed to me and I managed to get it all done before I left for the day at 2:30pm.  The stupid bus came at 3pm, so I had to wait at the bus stop and listen to some girl telling me her life's story. Yay.   I threw in some cordon bleaus after I got home and ate a big lunch/supper around 4pm, while I watched "Judge Judy".   I'm tired.   And hungry again too.

        A Very Monday-Like Tuesday   I slept like crap again last night. I went to bed around 10:20pm and read for a little bit (Kurt Vonnegut's "Breakfast Of Champions") and then around 11pm, I got tired and tried to go to sleep. Didn't happen. Sometime around 2am it started raining and I thought maybe I'd get to sleep ok then, but it started to thunder really loudly. I think I got somewhere between 2 and 3 hours of sleep last night altogether.   Somehow, I managed to get up and go to work. I had breakfast (oatmeal) but I didn't have time to shower or shave today (I was dragging). I got out the door at 8:05am, 10 minutes before the bus was supposed to be there.  It was raining still and my bus stop has no cover, so I was none too happy. I got even less happier having to wait there for 45 minutes before my bus showed up. The first bus never showed up, or more likely, came way too early. The bus stop is behind the house two doors down from me, so it wasn't like I was late or anything. Fucking bus...   I got in to work 5 minutes late, not cool, but I was much more productive today so that kind of made up for it (plus I stayed a little later too). JP had me do some new stuff today (burning CDs, gathering data from discs, etc..) and I even recorded messages for my voice mail... finally (JP had been after me to do that since Friday). I also got to burn a few copies of the demo of covers my band recorded Friday night. I have five extras to hand out now, but they're really more to serve a purpose than for listening pleasure. None of us were very happy with what we recorded, but it's good enough to hand out to club owners and bookers.   I ate lunch at work today too. I went down to the cafeteria and got a grilled chicken wrap, which was pretty good. I'd been wanting to try their southwestern grilled chicken wrap, but they were out of the rice so I just had a regular one. I ate at my desk, by myself.   I'm tired as hell. I'm going to eat dinner in a few minutes, much earlier than usual. I plan on going to bed around 9pm tonight... I don't know how I'm going to kill time and stay awake until then.  (yawn)

        Crappy Monday To Me!   I had a hell of a time falling asleep last night, I went to bed at 11pm but I didn't fall asleep until a couple (few?) hours later. I got up at 7am, woke up just before the alarm went off. Whatever sleep I got... it just wasn't enough.   I got up, got fed, got ready for work, and caught the early bus at 8:15am. I got to work around 8:45am. JP was arriving just as I was punching in. He brought in a copy of 5-song CD we recorded on Friday and it's not as bad as I'd thought. Dan, the engineer/owner of the recording studio, did a very nice job of cleaning the mistakes up and making us sound better than we were. Hopefully JP will be in tomorrow so I can make some copies. JP said he and Dan stayed until 1:30am mixing it and bullshitting.   Shortly after JP got to work, he started to get his kidney stone pains again and wound up going home shortly after his day had begun.  Since JP left so early on, I was stuck there doing whatever I could remember or figure out for myself. Needless to say, it was a boring ass, unproductive day. Luckily, I brought a case of tapes in with me today and that helped kill some of the boredom. I listened to Frank Zappa's "Joe's Garage" and stuff from Warren Zevon, The Band, Dio, Jeff Beck, and CSN & Y. I brought some batteries in with me too and checked out the portable CD players that were in a drawer there (that former employess had left behind). One didn't work, but one did so it's mine now. Last Friday I took home a cassette player (walkman type) that was there, but alas, it didn't work.   I left work at 2:45pm today after my six hours were up, and took the bus home. I hadn't eaten lunch and was hungry so after I got home I cracked open a coconut that Mom had bought me (I'd been jonesing to try one) and proceeded to eat/drink it. Five minutes later, I was puking my brains out in the bathroom sink. Very nice. I don't know what happened, I mean, I love shredded coconut and have never had a problem with it, so why did  real  coconut kick my ass? Maybe it was the coconut juice... I don't know, but whatever it was, it definitely kicked my ass.   Thus, my coconut experiment has ended.

        Sunday Happenings   I went to bed way too late last night, talking to my sister for a couple hours (very unusual) and staying up to watch "Real Time with Bill Maher". I didn't get to bed until somewhere around 2:15am, and then, after I was in bed, I just could not fall asleep. Grrr!! I was still awake around 5am. I got up around then and set my alarm for 11:15am, not quite enough sleeping time, but I didn't want to get up any later in the day or I'd totally screw my sleep schedule up all over again.   I talked to my friend Rob for a while today. He'd called to tell me he bought that new Jimi Hendrix "Axis Outtakes" CD (for $25 from Vinyl Fever over in Tampa). I also talked to JP this afternoon and I told him I'd go and check out that new rehearsal studio near here that we've been thinking about trying out. After I hung up with him, I got showered and Mom and then I ran over there.   It wasn't what I'd hoped. It was in an industrial type place, a couple rows of storage unit type buildings and the practice rooms were inside one of them. The first thing I noticed was that there is no sound-proofing... not good. If two bands were in their together, it'd be a sonic mess. In fact, the guy who runs it was mixing a tape of some death metal band in an opposite room and it came through quite clear in the practice room I was standing in (with the door closed even). Secondly, it wasn't set up very well. It's a small rectangle-shaped room, and they had the drums against one of the small walls along with one PA cabinet, and along the longer walls was a bass amp, a small combo amp, and another PA cabinet. The PA head was in the corner. It would have been awkward playing that way, with the drummer in the rear, Al and I almost on the side and JP to the front. It would have made more sense to put the drums against one of the longer walls with a PA cab and an amp on either side of him and the singer in front. Also, the drums didn't sound much better than the ones at Circle and the room was muchg smaller, so basically, the place really had nothing going for it. Pretty disappointing.  On the way home, I asked Mom if we could stop at Wendys so I could talk to Barry, one of my old managers there. I invited him to the March 13th gig. I hope he comes, but I doubt he will.   After we stopped there, we went over to Goodwill. I'm really glad we did. Books were on sale today 3-for-$1 (paperbacks  and  hardcovers) so I grabbed a whole bunch. I got six different Anne Rice books: "The Queen Of The Damned", "Servant Of The Bones", "The Mummy", "Vittorio The Vampire" (hardcover) and ""Memnoch The Devil" (hardcover). I also found another Sherlock Holmes book "The Complete Adventures And Memoirs Of Sherlock Holmes" by Arthur Conan Doyle (hardcover), "Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Stories To Stay Awake By" (a hardcover anthology), Tim Allen "Don't Stand Too Close To A Naked Man" (hardcover - I have the paperback of this already, but I loved the book and wanted a nice hardcover). I also got two S.E. Hinton books "Rumble Fish" and That Was Then, This was Now". I remember reading them in school (a long, long time ago) and wanted to re-read them. I figured my sister, niece and/or my older nephew might read them too. I also picked up the unedited version (1,141 pages) of Stephen King's "The Stand". I loved the regular normal version of that book, can't wait to see what got left out. I also found "We Were Soldiers Once... And Young" (the book the movie "We Were Soldiers Once" was based on). I picked up a James Bond book, "Casino Royale" by Ian Fleming. I've never read any James Bond books, nor seen any of the movies all the way through. I picked up a book on speaking German ("Conversational German" for my niece (she took it in school and liked it). Lastly, I pickedup a Consumer reports Buying Guide for 2000 (I needed one more book for the 3-for $1 deal... should've grabbed "Viva MAD" instead). Besides the books, I picked up a padded cassette case for $2 (looked like new),  a sealed cassette tape (Little Village's self-titled debut... John Hiatt and Ry Cooder's band) for $0.50, and a wooden paddleball paddle for $0.50 (I broke one when me and Jess played in the "snow" the last time he was down). The total damge for all of that: $8. 57. Not too shabby!  I was planning on listing stuff on eBay tonight, but my lack of sleep is catching up to me. I guess I'll list some stuff on Tuesday instead, unless I have band practice that night.    Oh! Some more good news for me: when I talked to JP earlier, he said he'll go ahead and let me work 30 hours a week instead of 25... sweet! That's an extra $200 a month! He leaves early tomorrow, so I hope I do ok without him there. He's going to bring in a copy of the CD we recorded Friday night and he said he'll burn me a few copies. I'm going to bring in some cassettes to listen to tomorrow.   Everything's going really well for me lately, almost too well... it's scary. I guess I'm just not used to good things happening for me.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  Right now I have Styx's "Caught In The Act" tape on. This week I finally played my new Big Head Todd & The Monsters CD, "Sister Sweetly" (a  great  album). I've also been rocking out to Black Sabbath's "Master Of Reality" tape (I just got 5 Sabbath tapes in). I couldn't get "Sweet Leaf" out of my mind all day yesterday, killer song.    Watching on TV:  Not much the last few days, been too busy. Earlier in the week I watched "Everybody Loves Raymond", "Seinfeld", and "King Of Queens", plus "Fear Factor" on Monday.    Downloading:  Nothing.    Reading:  I started Stephen King's "Night Shift" about a week ago, but I haven't picked it back up yet.     Jamming:  We went into the studio last night (and I played horribly) and we're due to practice sometime next week. We may try out that new rehearsal studio around the corner from here (the one that looks like it's in someone's house). I guess we're going to try and line up a gig for February since we have a gig booked for March already (March 13th). With the demo CD done, maybe we'll start playing  two  gigs a month.    Working:  Finally! I started a new job working with my longtime friend and bandmate, JP (he's my boss now), and it's going pretty well so far. A lot to learn, but I am willing and able, so it should work out ok. I worked 2 full shifts Thursday and Friday (Thursday with no sleep at all) but next week I'll go down to part-time hours, 5 or 6 hours a day (not sure which yet).    Buying:  Nothing this week. There were a few auctions I missed due to my sleep problems and some I let go because of financial uncertainty. But, me being the shop-a-holic I am, there are about 30 auctions I'm watching (tape lots and clothes mainly).    Selling:  I didn't list any auctions last week, but I'm going to list some this week to help me get by until I get a  real  paycheck on or around Feb.15th.    Eating:  Mom is on that Atkins diet and that works for me (less "bad stuff" around the house for me to eat). I haven'y drank any soda for a week or so, been drinking a lot more water and my beloved Arizona Ginseng tea. I've been eating oatmeal for breakfast everyday (Maple) and I've been eating a reasonable lunch in the afternoon. For dinner, I skipped it altogether one night and last night just had a small bowl of chili and some crackers. One night Mom made fish (Tilapia) and shrimp, and another night she made pork and rice. We've both been eating better lately. I hope it stays that way, but we always go off track somewhere down the line. Me, I'm pretty set now. I have a band now that plays out in front of people so I have a good reason to want to get healthier and lose weight. I've always been depressed and lonely and not given a shit about myself and it shows.    Feeling:  Right now, a little tired, slight headache, but ok. Mentally I feel much better. Things are looking more and more up for me and that's a pleasant change.    Planning:  In February, my main plans are to pay Mom and JP what I owe them (Mom $500, JP $50). Then, in March, I plan on buying an amp, preferably a Fender Hot Rod DeVille 4x10 or maybe a Marshall 2x12 combo. After that, I plan on paying Mom a couple hundred each month again and laying away a 2nd guitar for me (another strat). I need to get my stereo speaker fixed, buy some more work clothes, and get my strat worked on somewhere along the line too.

        A Non-Busy Saturday   Shortly after I wrote the previous post I went and laid down on the couch. That was around 11am. I got comfortable and wound up sleeping on the couch until about 2pm, a nice little (and much needed) nap. My legs and feet were still sore form all that standing last night at the studio and with working and all (they haven't seen much action in the last several months). Also, during the night, I kept waking up with charlie horses in my calf muscles (both legs) so they were pretty darn sore. I was planning on going up to my sister's today (to watch my nephew's basketball game and pick my niece up), but that got scrapped. We'll have to get together next week. My sister is talking about her and the kids coming down, so that's cool. Hopefully I'll have a paycheck and some money in my pocket then too. I'm thinking we can pick my niece up on Friday night and then she can go back home with my sister on Saturday or Sunday, whenever she comes down.   I'm probably going to go and clean my room in a few minutes, it really needs it. But I may just do nothing. It's that kind of day.

        A Busy Friday   Friday started off pretty bad. I went out at 8:15am to catch the bus that, I thought, went by at 8:30am and I wound up missing it. I saw it coming before I made it to the stop so I started running towards it, waving my arms at the driver, but the asshole went right on by. How do you not see a big running fat guy waving his arms at you from 30-40 feet away? I thought he'd come way too early and hoped he was just way too late and that there'd be another one coming in a few minutes, but neither was true. It seems the one I saw go by at :30 after the other day was a fluke,  he  was way too early or way too late. I had to walk back home, call JP to tell him I was going to be late... on my second day... and went back out to wait for the next bus. It came around 8:50am and, somehow, I managed to clock in at 9:02am. I think the timeclock must be off a little.   I worked by myself most of the day, JP wasn't with me very much. I remembered how to do most everything and only needed to go to him for help a few times, mostly about using Excel, which I've never really used before. It took a while, but I think I have the hang of it... at least for doing the things I needed it to do this day.   At lunchtime, JP and I walked down and bought lunch at the cafeteria (I had the BBQ pork sandwich w/ hash browns and coleslaw... the BBQ pork was awesome) and then we split to our own offices again. I ate and looked at eBay then I went back to work after my half hour was up (I had to punch out for lunch today).   We left work around 5pm and went to my place to pick up my equipment and studio money ($30) and then we took off for JP's place, loaded his equipment, and then we headed for the recording studio.   We got there before anyone else, including Dan, the studio owner. After he arrived, we brought everything inside and started setting up. Al arrived next, followed by Jimmy.   I thought we'd be eating dinner at the English pub next door or at least having a drink there, but we didn't. I was hungry for some fish and chips too, but we just didn't have the time.   The studio itself was really nice and Dan did a great job of making us sound better than we actually were (he really knows his stuff). The only thing I didn't like was the "room" I was in, which was really a small closet. There was no A/C in the closet and then I had lights shining down on me... I felt like a rotisserie chicken. It was hot, cramped, and uncomfortable. I think that had a part in why I was playing so awfully, which I was. My hands started sweating a lot, I was stumbling back on the mic stand for the amp, and at one point, my wrist started hurting badly. I was making mistakes I never make, ever, on almost every single song we did. Same with all of the other guys... it was weird. My rhythm is usually rock solid, but I went out of rhythm several times, during solos even. I wasn't real happy with most of what I played, I definitely could've done better, but with the time constraints and the recording costs and all, I had to let it go, after all, it's just a demo of covers for club owners to hear. We did "Feelin' Alright", "Stuck In The Middle", "Wild Night", "Love The One You're With", Cold Shot", "Steal My Kisses" (which I think Dan chucked), and one of JP's originals, "Sleeping Forever". I think we all were pretty unhappy with most of what we played, but like I said, Dan cleaned a lot of it up in the mix, so overall, it sounded ok.   I left around 11:30pm with Al, Jimmy split then too, and JP stayed behind with Dan and his assistant, Hank. I think we only paid for 7:30-10:30, so Dan stayed late and worked on the mix for us free of charge, which was really nice of him to do. He never said anything about and and and actually seemed to be enjoying what he was doing, so that was cool. I was hoping to have a CD to take home with me, but no luck. I'll have to get a copy from JP on Monday.   Al and I talked about music all the way home. Mom was still up when I got in. I sat in front of the PC for a while, then went and had a bowl of chili, my dinner, around Midnight. I hit the sack shortly after, laying in bed figuring out how I'll spend my paychecks, from January to June. JP said I may be working 30 hours a week rather than 25, which would be great. A bit later, I fell asleep.

        Sleepworking   My last-minute plan to stay at home today didn't pan out. I called JP this morning to tell him that I hadn't slept last night and that I didn't want to start work until Monday now, but he told me he already told his boss I'd be starting today, and since I didn't want to make him look bad with his boss, I went in and worked from 9 to 5. Well, more like 9:15am to 4:45pm (JP was late picking me up and we left early).   It was a hectic day there, they were having a lot of phone problems, technical stuff and there was a loud buzzing in my office all day. Other than that, it was a pretty easy day. The work isn't hard, but there is a lot, and I do mean  a lot , to learn. It's totally different than any job I've ever had before. I was always used to working hard, staying busy, but there was a lot of sitting and waiting today. JP assured me that the more I learned the busier I'd be, which is good for me (makes time go by faster).  I work in my own little office there, complete with two desks and two computers. I share office space with PC and phone connections for the whole company but they're pretty much out of my way. I'm really the only one in there, which is just fine with me, though JP was with me most of the day today. I don't know how long he'll be doing that, a while I'd guess (since there's so much to learn still).  We went out for lunch together too, on the clock (he told me not to worry about punching out). We went over to this decent Chinese buffet on East Bay where they have some awesome Crab Rangoon. I was going to eat a baloney sandwich for lunch today, but because I decided I wasn't going to work today, I never made one (and then I went into work anyway). We ate and talked about the band and the job. It was cool.   I worked until 4:45 today, so Mom picked me up on her way home. I'm supposed to work late tomorrow too, and then JP and I are heading to the recording studio right after work. We'll be there til at least 10:30pm, probably later, so I'd damn well better get some sleep tonight.   I think I'l go insane if I don't... for real. Last night was just too much, just too frustrating.

        Self-Sabotage   I'm supposed to be sleeping right now, but I'm not. I went to bed at 10:30pm last night, and here it is 7 hours later and I  still  haven't been asleep yet. My mind just won't shut down, I keep thinking about the new job, about money, about time, and to make matters worse, I have that Outkast song, "Hey Ya", stuck in my head, playing over and over. I also had a problem getting comfortable again, tossing and turning all night long, and feeling way too warm, especially my head and neck (I need a Chillow). I'm a fucking mess.   JP is supposed to pick me up at 8:30 this morning and I don't know if I should call him and tell him I won't be able to start today or wait until he gets here. I'm going to tell/ask him to start me on Monday, so I'll have enough time to get into the habit of going to bed early and getting up early. He won't be happy, and understandably so. He's already doing me a huge favor by giving me the job and I'm re-paying him by being a pain in the ass. I don't want to start off a new job by going in on my first day without any sleep, especialy if I'm going to work a full shift, which I haven't done for several years now. I think it'd be a bad idea and a bad way to start off there.   I'm pretty pissed off about this. I mean, there was no reason for it. I did it to myself, for no reason whatsoever. I went to bed early enough, I was tired, but I just could not shut myself down and fall asleep. It's extremely frustrating. I wanted to scream a few times just from the pure frustration of it all.   So... my plan now is to just stay up all day today, tire myself the fuck out, and go to sleep at a normal time like a normal person. I figure if I can get up on Friday at 7:30am and go to be before 11pm, and do the same all weekend, by Monday I'll be back on track and the insomnia problem should be lessened some because I've started a proper sleeping pattern. The stress of starting the job should be off me for a few days too, which should help in getting to sleep at night. I have nothing else planned for today anyway, so I guess it'd be as good a day as any to try and do it.

        In Other News...   Since JP's feeling better, we're going to proceed into the studio on Friday after all. That'll be another first for me and I'm looking forward to it a great deal. We're just going to cut a demo of covers so we'll have something to give club owners, but it's still pretty exciting to me.   The place we played the other night booked us again for mid-March. We're going to play two 45-minute sets that night for $200. That's what we got paid for the 1-hour set and we brought in a lot of people that night (over 50), many of whom had very large bar tabs. It seems like the owner is being cheap with us, JP thinks so too, so we're going to be looking for different, hopefully, better-paying, venues to play. It'd be different if we didn't bring a crowd with us, but we do, and he makes a lot of money off our crowd, so there should be some reciprocation.   Yes, I said "reciprocation".

        Tomorrow   I talked to JP this afternoon, he's feeling better, so I will start work tomorrow. He said he'll probably keep me there for a full shift the next two days because of the lost time this week. That'll be good for my paycheck though I don't know how well I'm going to hold up (not having worked a full shift for several  years ). Plus, I'm still not sleeping well at night still (I went to bed around Midnight last night but didn't fall asleep until sometime after 4am), so I'll likely be pretty tired too.   He's going to pick me up for work tomorrow, but then I will start taking the 8:30am bus to work. He said I answer to him there and he doesn't care if I am a few mninutes late for work every now and then. I'd told him that I wasn't sure how close I'd cut it with that bus because of having to cross the road (a very busy, congested road) and then having to walk a block or two to work. We'll see how it goes. If it doesn't work, I'll just take the earlier bus or ride with Mom.   It looks like I'll need to take a lunch to work too. I'll make a baloney sammich and maybe some chips. Luckily, Mom picked me up some Arizona Ginseng tea (the blue bottled kind, baby!) so that'll go good with the sammich.  I got my clothes de-tagged and hung up and I packed my little carry bag full of goodies for work (Altoids, clean hankies, quarters, etc..). Mom is hemming my pants right now, so I'm almost ready for 7:30am (when I'll have to be up for work). I just have to cut off slack and adjust the canvas belts we picked up.   I'm pretty nervous about the job and the environment I'll be working in (I have never had an office job or had to wear business clothes  ever ), but I'm trying to keep a positive outlook on everything.   Wish me luck, I'm going to need it.

        Bad News/Good News   The Bad News: I can't start my new job tomorrow and I may not be able to start until next week. The Good News: I can't start my new job tomorrow and I may not be able to start until next week.  I called up JP tonight (to talk about the job) and instead, I get his wife telling me he's in bed, ill with kidney stones, on medication, and won't be going back to work for a while. I asked her to wake him up for me, but she said she wouldn't do that. He's in charge of hiring me and training me, so I was left with no idea whether or not I was still supposed to go in tomorrow. Luckily, he called me back about 5-10 minutes later and we talked a bit.   He's feeling ok now, but he had a bad attack last night (around 2am) and he had to go to the hospital. He's been doped up all day and isn't sure when he's going back to work or whether or not we're still on for the recording studio this Friday. All of that depends on how soon he passes the stones...  three of them  (double yikes)!   So... no work for me tomorrow, no work all week perhaps. This means I may not get a paycheck this month either (the job pays bi-monthly), but like I said, this is also good news because it gives me time to continue adjusting my sleep schedule (by Monday, I should be completely on track) and it gives Mom time to hem my work pants. It also takes away some of the pressure I've been feeling at bedtime, which, I'm sure, is contributing to my recent bout with insomnia. Like I told Mom, this may be a blessing in disguise.

        50 Questions   Here are 50 questions I stole from  urlLink another blog , which were stolen from another blog by that blogger.    1. Your name spelled backwards.  yraG  2. Where were your parents born?  Pennsylvania  3. What is the last thing you downloaded onto your computer?  I downloaded a track by the Tarney-Spencer Band called "No Time To Lose". I'd seen a tape of this band on eBay and I wanted to hear what they were like. Pretty good music.   4. What's your favorite restaurant?  Probably Red Lobster.  5. Last time you swam in a pool?  Last Summer when my cousin and her kids were down from Pennsylvania. I jumped in the pool unexpectedly, with all of my clothes on, to get a laugh.  6. Have you ever been in a school play?  No way. I was always too self-concious to do anything like that.   7. How many kids do you want?  Right now, none. I can't even support myself very well, let alone a child or two. Besides, I've been alone a long time and if I met someone who wanted to be with me, I don't think I'd be in any rush to add kids into the picture.   8. Type of music you dislike most?  Christian music (musical propaganda), because I can't stand religion in the first place.    10. Do you have cable?  On the TV and PC.  11. Have you ever ridden on a moped?  Nope.  12. Ever prank call anybody?  When I was a teen, I did it every now and again. Besides the usual stuff, I'd call people and just repeat "tupperware" or "kitchen utensils" until they hung up on me. I found it hilarious because it was so stupid and unusual a thing to do.   13. Ever get a parking ticket?  No. I've never had a car.   14. Would you go bungee jumping or sky diving?  Not on purpose. Who knows though, maybe if I discovered I had a terminal disease I might want to try stuff like that, tempting fate and all.   15. Furthest place you ever traveled.  Probably the distance between here (Florida) and Pennsylvania.   16. Do you have a garden?  No. I had a Chia Head once, but I couldn't get it to sprout.  17. What's your favorite comic strip?  Ugh. They all pretty much suck nowadays. "Dilbert" is ok, so is "Mother Goose  & Grimm". I haven't been into cartoons since "The Far Side" and "Calvin & Hobbes" were around.   18. Do you really know all the words to your national anthem?  I don't think I could recite them now, but if I go to a game and it gets sung, I think I can remember them. Of course, we're talking first stanza here, I don't know anyone who knows the  whole  song.  19. Bath or Shower, morning or night?  Shower, and in the morning (to help wake me up). I like taking them at night too, nice and relaxing, but I hardly ever do.   20. Best movie you've seen in the past month?  I watched "The Shining" again, on DVD.  21. Favorite pizza topping?  Does cheese count? If not, then pepperoni.  22. Chips or popcorn?  I like buttered popcorn sometimes at night, when I'm watching TV, but generally, I like chips better (with a sandwich, not as a snack).  23. What color lipstick do you usually wear?  Uhh... uhh...  24. Have you ever smoked peanut shells?  Uhh... uhh...  25. Have you ever been in a beauty pageant?  Uhh... uhh... no.  26. Orange Juice or apple?  Orange juice.   27. Who was the last person you went out to dinner with and where did you dine?  I went to a mexican restaurant with my Mom and my niece. I can never remember the name of the place though.   28. Favorite type chocolate bar?  I used to love Skor bars, but they're really bad on the teeth. I usually stay away from candy these days.    29. When was the last time you voted at the polls?  Hmmm... last year, I think. Local elections.    30. Last time you ate a homegrown tomato?  I don't know if I ever did. It's not something that would've crossed my mind.  31. Have you ever won a trophy?  I used to have some Little League trophies, but they're long gone. I probably threw them out when I was a teenager.   32. Are you a good cook?  Well, when I choose to cook, I cook well, but I usually only stick to foods I know I can cook without screwing up (eggs, steaks, hamburgers, Ramen noodles).   33. Do you know how to pump your own gas?  I don't have a car to pump gas into, but I've pumped gas for Mom before.   34. Ever order an article from an infomercial?  I don't think so. I know there were things over the years that I wanted to buy, but I don't think I ever did.   35. Sprite or 7-up?  7-Up. Sprite is too carbonated.   36. Have you ever had to wear a uniform to work?  Yeah, at almost all of the restaurant jobs I've ever had.   37. Last thing you bought at a pharmacy?  A Pepsi and some gum.  38. Ever throw up in public?  Outdoors yes, in front of people, no.   39. Would you prefer being a millionaire or find true love?  Being 34 and never having found true love, the money is awfully tempting, but I think I'd still go for true love.   40. Do you believe in love at first sight?  I don't know. I mean, sometimes you can see someone and get a feel for what kind of preson they are, but to love someone is to know that person and I don't think you can get that just from seeing them once.   41. Ever call a 1-900 number?  No, but some friends of mine did, for a goof, and used my phone, causing me to get blamed for it.   42. Can ex's be friends?  I think so, in time.  43. Who was the last person you visited in a hospital?  My sister, about 6 years ago, when she had my youngest nephew.   44. Did you have a lot of hair when you were a baby?  I had hair, probably more than I have now :(  45. What message is on your answering machine?  My Mom saying "we're not home right now, but if you leave a message..."  46. What's your all time favorite Saturday Night Live Character?  Hmmm... there's been so many great ones over the years. Maybe... Eddie Murphy as Buckwheat?  47. What was the name of your first pet?  I had a pet rabbit when I was a toddler up in Pennsylvania. I think his name was Charlie.   48. What is in your purse?  No purse, I'm a dude... thank you very much.   49. Favorite thing to do before bedtime?  I play my acoustic guitar in bed a lot, just before I go to sleep.   50. What is one thing you are grateful for today?  That things are beginning to look up for me.

        Still Lacking   I had another rough night in bed last night. I went to bed around 11:15pm last night, but by 1:15am, I was still awake. I got up, watched TV for an hour, then went back to bed. Hours passed before I finally fell asleep. I have no idea when it finally was that I drifted off, but it must've been very late because I slept through my alarm and didn't get up until 11am this morning. Not good. I need to be up at 7am tomorrow to get ready for my first day at the new job and my body (internal clock or whatever) is still (at least) 4 hours behind. I'm tired as hell now, so I have a feeling the first few days of work are going to be  rough ... very, very rough.   I got to work on my eBay mailings this afternoon, I just have to fill out 5 or 6 customs forms and I'll be finished. I threw in a few tapes and listened to them while I worked. I guess I should use the rest of the day and night to clean. The house is a mess, especially my room (still). I need to do laundry too. But what I really need to do is find something to do that will zonk me out good. Maybe I'll get drunk. We have rum, all I need is some Pepsi. It's pretty sad that I have to go to that extreme just to get a good night's rest. Pathetic, huh?

        Busy Day   I didn't get to sleep until sometime after daylight, after it started raining. It was probably the most stressful "night's sleep" I've ever had and I've had some really rough ones in my life. I had planned on being up at 7:30am, but I got out of bed at 11:30am, four hours later than planned, but at least it was still in the am, so that's some progress. I think I slept two, maybe three (and that's pushing it), hours altogether. Very bad night. It was rough, but I did get up and I did get showered and sometime after 1pm, Mom and I hit the road.   We went to three different Beall's stores, Casual Male, and a few pawn shops to boot. We also stopped off at two other places where Mom had to make payments. I got a bunch of shirts, a few pair of pants, and some belts. I think I have enough to get me started at the new job. I also picked up three more new pillows and chucked three of the old lumpy pillows I've had on my bed... finally. I hope I'll be able to sleep better now. Mom said the clothes cost about $300  Well, it's 11pm, and I'm off to bed. Hopefully tomorrow will be like a brand new start for me.

        Unfuckingreal   I went to bed almost 5 hours ago and I have not slept a wink yet. My mind just wouldn't shut down. I finally got sick of lying there, trying unsuccessfully to sleep, so I got back out of bed and came out to the computer. You know, I am so glad I called JP last night and pushed my start date to Wednesday, I never would have made it in today. It would have been a total disaster, a horrible way to start off.   I am  extremely  tired right now, and I'm sure by this afternoon I will be wiped out completely. Of course, I have a ton of stuff to do today, like get a haircut and go clothes shopping at several different stores... all fun stuff to do when you've barely slept.   I'm going to go and try to sleep again in a few minutes. I wanted to be up at 7:30am today, the time I will be getting up for work everday, but now I'm going to try for 9am. Maybe I'll get about 3 or 4 hours sleep if I'm lucky (which I usually am not).   Ahhh... life... can it get any better?

        A Much Needed Pause   I talked to JP tonight and we pushed my start date from Monday to Wednesday... ahhhh. I needed that. I just wasn't ready to start on Monday and I was feeling it. Monday was coming too soon and I was ill prepared for it. I don't have the dress clothes I need yet, I haven't gotten a haircut yet, and I still haven't gotten up in the morning yet (though I should be back on track tomorrow). Mom got me a shirt and a pair of pants yesterday, but the shirt is too small and the pants need hemmed. She knows where there's another pair of pants (exactly like the one she already bought), so we'll have to pick them up tomorrow (she's off from work), but I still need shirts badly (dress shirts and undershirts) and I could certainly use more/different pants. I found my brown dress shoes last night (I thought I might have given them to Goodwill), so that helps out a bit. I should be ready to go come Wednesday.

        Still Not Normal   Well... I didn't make it. I tried to stay up all day, but I wound up going to bed around 11am, played guitar a little in bed, and then crashed. I was just too damned tired. I got up around 9pm tonight, a long way off from where I'd hoped to be. I'm going to try and sleep again tonight, though I don't know if I'll be able to.     My right leg feels funny. I keep getting a dull ache in it, from the knee down. Very weird feeling, and annoying to boot. I had a charlie horse while I was in bed too.  Mom went out and bought me some clothes today, for the job I'm supposed to start on Monday. I should be able to pay her back with my first paycheck. She also picked me up a new pillow, something I definitely can use. Mine are all sagged out, lumpy and uncomfortable. I think my pillows are a big factor in my sleep difficulties. I probably could've used a couple more.   I took the scissors to my beard tonight. I'm going to shave the rest off in a bit. I need to be a clean shaven, well-groomed, well-dressed person by Monday. I'm supposed to go for a haircut tomorrow sometime. I don't JP gave me enough time to transform myself, five days just isn't enough.  I'm such a mess.

        A Long Night, But A Good One   Well, the gig went very, very well. We brought in about 50 people and those people drank a lot, so we got paid $200 for the gig. Fifty bucks... not bad for an hour's worth of "work" (and I use that word very loosely). My sister and brother-in-law (Danny) came and they brought 4 people with them, including Richard (Danny's step-brother) and his wife. My sister got drunk and became super talkative. She was too funny. She was even drinking with JP's wife, who she'd never met before. I still couldn't tell whether my sister actually liked her or not. I wish I could've left with her and Danny, they were heading over to another bar and she said she was going to do karaoke! I would have loved to have seen that!  Before we went on, I got to say hi to an old friend, Jim Fagan, from way back. I used to jam with him when I was first starting out on guitar. He drums for the band that we opened for. After we were done, while he was setting his kit up, he told me that we sounded good, which was very cool of him to say. It meant a lot to me because he played with me when I wasn't very good.   I also got to hang out a little with my friend Rob after our set. He didn't get there until the band that followed us was on (he worked late). It was his 50th birthday tonight. I was looking for one other person tonight, who never showed up, and whose ass I shall now have to kick.   Here's the setlist we played:  Love The One You're With The Old Apartment Promise You The Moon (an original) Steal My Kisses Hanging By A Moment Circle (an original) Had A Girl (an original) Feelin' Alright Cold Shot Sleeping Forever (an original) Stuck In The Middle Wild Night Rock This Town I Wanne Be Sedated  Encore: You Can't Run (an original)  I was worried bigtime going into the gig tonight because my guitar wouldn't stay tuned at practice (I'd put new strings on it). I had to tune up between almost every song. I think we did pretty good overall though, we were definitely a lot looser than last time and it was more fun. I made a few boo-boos here and there, nothing major though. The crowd was great, they were really there for us, dancing and everything, and being very vocal. In fact, they were so vocal, that after we finished our set and the club owner was thanking us, the crowd wouldn't chill out until we were allowed to play one more song. One guy yelled "let them play one more song you asshole!" Too funny!  Everyone said we sounded great and we got a ton of compliments. In fact, too many compliments. I'm not used to that at all. I said "thank you" and "that's good to hear" a lot. I guess I need to work on small talk more, because after I've said "thank you" and  "that's good to hear", and the person is still standing there, waiting, it gets kind of awkward.   One sucky thing about tonight, when the owner paid us, he mentioned something about how the place cleared out after we finished, like it was a reason not to pay us more. We did our job, got the people in there and drinking and kept them throughout our set. I thought the band we opened for was supposed to draw an even bigger crowd or at least hold the crowd there (they're a very popular band around here and they usually have quite a following). JP was not happy about what the owner said, not at all. He thought we should have gotten $250 for the gig. I've decided, for the most part, to stay out of the financial arrangements, since I would play for free, so I'm happy with what I got.   After we cleared out of there, JP wanted to go over to New York, New York, where his wife went after we finished. I thought it'd be best if he took me home first, but he headed on over there anyway. His wife wound up getting shit-faced drunk and had to be taken home immediately. I wound up riding with them up to their place, stopping for puke breaks along the way (hers). After we got there, she crashed on the couch and wouldn't move. JP wanted to watch DVDs with me (I was going to crash there), but she had the couch in front of the TV. He decided to take me home after a little while. I felt bad about that. I hate not having a car and I hate inconveniencing people because of it.   I finally got home about 3:30am. I went back and talked to Mom a little. I guess I'm staying up all night and day again, trying to get my sleeping habit switched back to daytime hours again (I'm supposed to start work at 9am on Monday). I need to get clothes for work sometime, I guess I can do that Monday afternoon (Mom is off and I'm supposed to be off around 2pm). This is going to be hard as I'm pretty tired and I've drank a bit tonight (3 beers, a couple jack and cokes and a shot of some wicked beverage the bar sent us while we were onstage). I'd like to hit the sack around 10pm tonight. 18 hours and counting...

        Pre-Gig Stuff   I am tired... very, very tired. I went to bed at 8:30pm last night, read for a few minutes and tried to sleep for the night. I slept until 2am again. I got up watched TV for a little and then tried to go back to bed around 4:30am (after I watched "Panic", a decent movie with William H. Macy). I did the same thing I did the day before and went in and out of sleep all day long. This time, I forced myself to get up around 12:30pm and stay up. I don't know if that was a good thing or not, as I said, I am very, very tired.   I have been fairly productive nonetheless. I practiced on guitar for a little while, put fresh batteries in my pedal and tuner, and figured out why my wah wasn't working last time we practiced (a bad cord). I showered too. Now I need to clip my nails.  I talked to Mom and she's bringing home some chow (a gyro & fries), so I don't have to worry about cooking something. I haven't eaten since 2:15am, so I'm pretty darn hungry right now. Mom said my sister is iffy about coming tonight. She said she  wants to , but isn't sure if she can. Nice. She's had a few weeks to make sure she could be there. I doubt our other friends that she was supposed to invite are coming either. So far, only one person I know is coming for sure... right? Well, two, actually may come, but one won't get there until after our set is done. Again, nice (he had a few weeks notice too).  JP called and said he may be over early, around 4pm, but it's past that now. I was going to try and nap, but couldn't since he was coming over early. Grrr!!!

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  Tapes mostly, I got over 200 in this week. I listened to Sammy Hagar's "Standing Hampton", some of the "Heavy Metal" soundtrack, a little from Duff McKagen, some BoDeans, etc. I haven't really sat down and just listened to anything though.   Watching on TV:  They moved some of my judge shows during the day, plus I've been getting up too late, so I've only been catching "Judge Judy" lately. I'm still watching "The Simpsons", "Everybody Loves Raymond", and "Seinfeld" in the evenings though and I caught "The Daily Show" and "Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn" a couple times this week. I half-watched "Fear Factor" on Monday and I watched "Howard Stern" last night (before I went to bed for the second time).    Downloading:  I doanloaded some stuff last week and still haven't listened to any of it. I haven't downloaded anything new since then.    Reading:  I just finished Stephen King's "The Shining" (reviewed 2 posts below). I'm not sure what I'm going to read next.     Jamming:  We practiced last Tuesday and I haven't picked up my electric guitar since. Well, I did re-string it last night, but I haven't practiced at all and we have a gig tomorrow. Hopefully, I'll sound fresh when I play tomorrow (rather than sounding like a guy who needs to practice more).    Working:  I have a job lined up, supposed to start on Monday, but I don't know how well it's going to work out. I need to buy clothes for it thios weekend (I don't have any "business casual" clothes) but I have no money. I don't think this is the ideal job for me, but it may be good enough for now. I really hate dressing up and I hate shaving even worse, both of which this job requires.    Buying:  Nothing this week, not for lack of trying though. I bid on and lost a couple of small auctions on eBay (one for an SNL book and one for a small tape lot).    Selling:  I have about 50-60 auctions running, they're doing ok, not great, just ok.    Eating:  I had chicken with italian bread crumbs and some Ramen noodles last night and tonight I made a chicken with italian bread crumbs sandwich. I haven't really been eating much lately, I've been missing meals and stuff. I just haven't been feeling well. I decided that I'm done with soda at home, as soon as I finish the last Pepsi, I'm done. I need to start drinking more water.     Feeling:  Beaten down, like total shit. I have a headache almost everyday now. I worry about money. I just don't feel right.    Planning:  To improve my life. The job is the first step... hopefully that'll work out for me.

        Why Do I Keep Fucking Up?   I've asked myself this question many times before (even before the Neil Young song came out) and I still don't have an answer. I've been offered a job (see 2 posts below), and am supposed to start on Monday (at 9am), but here I am, not getting out of bed until 4:30pm today. I tried to go to bed early last night, around 9:30pm I went to bed with a book (see the post below), and I did fall asleep for a little while, but by 2am, I was back up. I tried going back to bed again around 3 or 4 am (with the book again), but I just could not get comfortable or relaxed and the sun was out before I finally dozed off again. To make matters worse, I was supposed to send off my Gateway bill today and forgot, now I will have a late charge to pay.   I'm a mess, a freakin' wreck. There are so many things I want to do and need to do but that aren't getting done for any number of reasons... so why do I keep fucking up? Why can't I get my shit together? How come other people are able to focus in and do what is necessary but I don't seem to be able to? I'm very angry and frustrated with myself right now.

        "The Shining"   I've seen the movie version of Stephen King's "The Shining" many, many times over the years (I even own the DVD now) and it's always been a favorite (the Jack Nicholson version, I haven't seen the other yet). Since I liked the movie so much, I've been wanting to read King's book (for a while now), and last night, I finally finished reading it.   I enjoyed reading the book, but having seen the movie so many times, it was eaier to pick out faults I found with the book. For one, there are some things that I found almost silly, like the animal-shaped hedges that move and attack, but also the whole premise of the  actual hotel itself  trying to kill people just seemed like nonsense to me. Also, I thought the whole "Horace Derwent" element was very anti-climactic and I didn't think it was reasonable for "Wendy" to let her son go off with a strange man she'd just met an hour before and sit in his car with him for 5-10 minutes. Seemed out-of-character to me, but I guess that's just nit-picking.   More nit-picking: I really couldn't visualize the characters in the book as they were written, because of the movie. For instance, "Wendy" is supposed to be a blonde, but I saw dark-haired Shelley Duvall the whole time. And Nicholson, and Scatman Crothers, and the kid from the movie...   On the bright side, the characters in the book are much better defined, you get more pre-hotel insight into their lives, Danny is expanded upon even more (as is Tony) and is made to be the central figure in the story, as he should be. The book held my attention throughout, was never boring, and there were several parts of the book that actually sent chills up my spine too, which is rare for a book.  I think I like the movie ending better, with the chase through the maze (which wasn't in the book), but the first half of the book is better (where you learn more about Jack's past and it's focused more on Danny). I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who hasn't seen the movie yet.

        Interesting Developement   My lifelong friend and current bandmate, JP, called me today and said he had a position open where he works (a telemarketing company) and that he's in charge of hiring someone and wanted to know if I'd be interested. For now, the job is just part-time, 20-25 hours a week, but... it pays $10.00 an hour. Nice. Best of all, I wouldn't have to be an actual telemarketer! He said I'd mostly be burning CDs, working with the no-call list, and doing various reports. Sweet! He's going to talk to human resources today and hopefully, if all goes well, I will be working on Monday! He said the job may go full-time at some point too, and a 40 hour week at $10 an hour sounds very, very good to me.   There are a couple of things about this that bother me though. One is that I'll have to buy some dress clothes for the job, but I have no money to do that. I think Mom may be able to help me with that, hopefully, anyhow. I'm also a bit worried that I may actually have to do  some  telemarketing and I don't want to do  any  telemarketing, just on principle (I hate telemarketing and being bothered by telemarketers). I may have to sacrifice some principle if it'll help me out in the long run, I suppose. I'm also worried that, if things don't go so well, my and JP's friendship could be in jeopardy, which could also spill over to our band situation. I'd hate to quit on or be fired by a friend. I have worked with JP before though, at Kash 'N Karry (a long time back), and we came out of it just fine.   Like I said, I'm going to do it. I really don't have much of a choice at this point, I need something, and how often does a job offer come to you? Almost gift-wrapped, nonetheless.   Wish me luck!

        Down In The Dumps   I have a headache that I just cant shake. It's been coming and going for a few days now. I think my sinuses are causing it; they've been really bad lately. It's very annoying, but especially so when I lay down and and try to go to sleep. I've been getting up after Noon all week because of my sleep trouble at night, but today I got up at 4:30pm, which is a very bad thing.   I'm supposed to be out job hunting during the day, instead, I'm sleeping. And then when I try to sleep at night, I worry about my finances (on top of the sinus trouble) because I have no job. Needless to say, I'm not a happy camper.   I'm lucky I got up when I did today, I could've been an even more unhappy camper. My Mom withdrew almost all of the money in my checking account this morning (with my permission), leaving me with $1 and some change in there. Unfortunately, I had calculated things incorrectly when I told her she could borrow he money and was in danger of bouncing three small checks (which would have cost me over $80 in fees). I transferred the money back in time and later saw that two of the three checks had cleared. Whew! Close call!  I'm not sure how I goofed up so badly, but I thought I had more money than I did.  I certainly wouldn't have bought that CD over the weekend if I knew how little I really had. I thought I was still going to have about $40.00-50.00 in there after my little shopping spree. Instead, I have about $4.00-5.00. Big difference.  2004 is already off to a bad start.

         urlLink Monday Madness     1. When I sing, I sound like a   guy who can not sing .   2.   November   is my favorite month of the year ,  but October is a very close second.    3. I've always wanted to improve my   guitar playing   skills.    4. It's Monday morning, and the first thing that goes through my mind is   "What time is it?"    5. My favorite day of the week is   Saturday   because   I usually get to get out of the house and do things that day.     6a. I currently collect   tapes and CDs, especially Jimi Hendrix stuff.     6b. I used to collect   baseball cards, basketball cards, KISS records, Monkees records, military insignia, G.I. Joes, Star Wars toys, etc...    7. At the end of a work day/school day, the first thing I want to do is   kick off my shoes and plop down on the couch (at least that's how I remember it).     8. I really look forward to   Christmas   because it's my favorite holiday.    9. When I need some down-time, I usually   veg out in front of the TV or PC or else take a nap.     10. I plan to travel to   New York City   someday.

        Another Saturday Night...   Last night, I cuddled up on the couch with my cats and watched 10 episodes of Mr. Show (the audio commentary versions). Damned funny stuff! After that I caught most of an old SNL that had Frank Zappa as the musical guest... totally amazing musican/s. I watched that until about 3:30am, then went to bed... not to sleep, but to read. I finished "The Dead Zone" (review below) and then tried to go to sleep. I couldn't. It was daylight out before I finally crashed. It must have been 6:30 or 7am, because I just woke up about an hour ago. I have a lot to do, auctions to pull, scan & list, but so far, I don't feel like doing anything at all. I've got the "blahs" again... do they ever go away?

        "The Dead Zone"   I finished reading this book last night. I liked it, but I think I liked the movie (the one with Christopher Walken) just a little better. About 3/4 of the way through the book, I felt like King went off track with the story (the part where Johhny Smith meets Jimmy Carter was especially lame to me), though he did get back on track with the last part. I thought the movie did a much better job of keeping things clear and focused throughout. I also thought the book handled Frank Dodd's death better; the movie had him jam a pair of scissors into his mouth... seemed like a pretty stupid and unlikely way to die (it was the one false note I felt with the movie). I don't know if I'd recommend this book or not. It is pretty good, but it wanders a bit too much.

        Spending Money I Don't Have   I had a hell of a time going to sleep last night. I tried, unsucessfully, to go to sleep out on the couch, but finally, sometime around 7:30am, I gave up, got up, and went to my own bed. I read for a little while before crashing... finally. I slept until about 2:30pm, got up, took a shower, and headed out to the Post Office with my Mom.   I took along that "Spiderman" DVD the kids gave me for Christmas and after I finished up at the PO, we headed on to Circuit City where I exchanged "Spiderman" for "Jimi Plays Berkeley". I looked around for a long while hoping to find something more inspiring. I wound up buying a CD to go along with the DVD, Big Head Todd & The Monsters "Sister Sweetly", a great CD that I missed having around. I probably could have gotten it cheaper if I looked around some (I paid $13.99), but there's no guarantee I could even find another (for the most part, the record shops around here suck) so I went ahead and bought it anyway (even though I really can't afford to be spending money right now).   After we left there we went over to Southern Pawn. They had CDs for $5 each at Christmas time and I wanted to see if they'd gotten any new ones in. They did, but they went up $1 in price, which is still a very good price. I bought two DVDs there, and one of them was a flat out steal: Mr.Show - Complete Seasons 1 and 2 for just $6.00! The outer box is a little worn, but the DVDs look perfect. I'm very excited about that find! The other DVD I bought was "High Fidelity", which I haven't seen in it's entirety (I've seen one or two scenes from it, including one of Jack Black's). I bought Mom a videotape there for $2 as well.  We went to Pawn Depot next, looked through a bunch of DVDs but found nothing worthwhile there. It was getting dark out already (around 6pm, it had been overcast all day), so we decided to go on home after we stopped for food. We went over to this gyro place on 66th Street and on the way we noticed that our beloved Sonny's BBQ was closed down. That really blows. Mom and I really liked going there. I had no idea they were closing. We had take-out from there just a couple of weeks ago and there was no mention of any closing. We didn't even get a last meal there (sniffle).    The gyro place was pretty darn good, gigantic gyro. I hadn't eaten all day and by the time I finished with the gyro and fries, I was stuffed. I don't think I can eat anymore tonight I'm so full. I bought Mom a steak hoagie there too. I spent money today like I actually had extra money to spend. Oh well, I will survive.   I have the Hendrix DVD on now, I think I'm going to throw in the Mr.Show DVD, snuggle up in some warm blankets, maybe have some tea or hot chocolate, and then laugh my ass off.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  Nothing.   Watching on TV:  I've been watching my "judge shows" every day ("The People's Court", "Judge Mathis", "Divorce Court", "Judge Joe Brown" and "Judge Judy"), my evening comedy shows ("The Simpsons", "Everybody Loves Raymond", "Seinfeld") and I've also watched "King Of Queens", "Saturday Night Live", and CNN. I'm watching my "Life Of Brian" DVD that I got for Christmas as I type this.    Downloading:  I doanloaded Jethro Tull's 1st album, "This Was", to check it out. My friend Rob was telling me it was a great album, but I've never heard it. I've been trying to download stuff from Edie Brickell's new CD (I just found out she put a new one out... last October), but so far I haven't been able to get anything from it.    Reading:  I'm most of the way through Stephen King's "The Dead Zone".     Jamming:  I had band practice on Tuesday (not much jamming, unfortunately) and we practice again next Friday, right before our gig that night.    Working:  I have a couple of jobs that I want to apply for, but I didn't get to them this week due to my sleeping difficulties. I still haven't heard back about that other job (Keystone) that I applied for before Christmas.    Buying:  I finally spent some dough this week (I've been good lately). I bought a 100 tape lot on eBay (contains stuff like Frank Zappa "Joe's Garage", Jimi Hendrix "Electric Ladyland", Pink Floyd "The Wall", Temple Of The Dog, Spin Doctors "Pocket Full Of Kryptonite", among others)  for $13.25 and then today I won two small tape auctions (5 Black Sabbath tapes and Jimi Hendrix "Electric Ladyland"), from a Canadian seller. I haven't gotten a total on them yet, but it should be about $5.25-$6.    Selling:  I didn't list anything last week, an haven't had the gumption to list anything new all week. I will have to get in gear thsi weekend.    Eating:  I had Mom take me to Taco Bell tonight, which is a super rare occurrance (I almost never eat there). This week, I've been eating a lot of rice, with BBQ chicken pieces, pork, or cheeseburgers (no bread), some squash, grilled cheese sandwiches and Manhattan clam chowder, pancakes, and earlier in the week I had baloney and cheese sammiches for a couple lunches (with BBQ Baked Lays chips). I've been drinking too much soda still. I need to cut that out. I have been drinking more water though, and I drank a lot of tomato juice this week, so that's good.    Feeling:  Tired. Seems like I'm always tired anymore.    Planning:  Same as usual: I need to get a job and I need to get an amp.

        Lifeless   I've been having a tough time sleeping at night here lately. It's been chilly for a few days now (in the 40's at night), just cold enough to need the heat on, and that's been killing me. I've been going to bed at a decent time, then I'll read in bed for a while, but when I try to lay down and go to sleep, the heat just gets unbearable (even with a fan blowing on me). I have the thermostat set for 70, but by the time the it feels it's 70 in the house (it's out near the living room), it's 80 or more in my room. I haven't actually been falling asleep until around 6am because of it, which causes me to sleep til late in the day and leaves with no energy whatsoever. Plus, I keep getting headaches.   I feel like crap.  I got up around 1:30pm today, and by 5:30pm, I was zonked out on the couch. I napped until about 9pm tonight. I took some Aleves before I laid down, but I still have a headache. I need to start getting things done around here, but I just don't feel like doing anything. I haven't even had dinner yet. Blah. Blah blah blah blah blah.

        Tuesday Happenings   After Midnight, Monday night, I started reading Stephen King's "The Dead Zone" in bed. I got through 3 or 4 chapters before I tried to crash (around 2:15am). Instead, I wound up tossing and turning a lot and didn't fall asleep until very, very late (or very, very early, depending on how you look at it), probably around 5 or 6am. I thought I'd wind up sleeping all day to make up for it, but I was up by 11:30am. Needless to say, I've been tired and dragging all day.   I made a "to do" list last night before I went to bed and I tackled most of it today. I did my laundry (still have to fold it), started getting my eBay mailings ready (I need to package them tonight), I cut up some of the cushion/pillows on the couch outside and got it out to the curb, I tried changing the latch on the porch door (the new one doesn't fit, I need to try something different tomorrow), I changed the cat litter, and I practiced guitar (off and on all day, probably got about 2 hours in).   While practicing, I finally settled on the way to play "Feelin' Alright" (my own rhythm style) and I also came up with a different way of playing the rhythm on "Steal My Kisses". I think they went over well (no one complained).   It wasn't a very fun practice tonight, we really didn't do any jamming (that's what I consider "fun"), but we got a lot done. We ran through the set list JP and I put together last night (after the first one I put together got rejected) and then we worked on some of the individual songs, tightening up parts, getting on the same page with things. We wound up cutting one of the songs from the set list, and then after practice, after Jimmy had a problem with the newest set list, we sat around and re-wrote it again. We're good to go now.  We're going to practice next Friday before our gig, and then, the following Friday, we are going into the studio to record a demo (5 covers for club owners/bookers). It's good to see things progressing like they are. It's been a long time since I started playing and it's good to be on the right track after all these years.

         urlLink Monday Mission 4.0  (The End)    1. In the last week, what happened that made you feel loved beyond your wildest dreams?   Not a damned thing.    2. What was the last audio CD you paid money for?   "The Essential Bruce Springsteen", a 3-CD set.   3. Has someone you know ever told you they had a terminal illness? What was it like for you when you found out. How did that change your relationship with them?   Luckily, that hasn't happened to me.    4. Do you have an accent? Are there any phrases or words you say that tip folks that you aren't from around these parts?   I used to when I first moved down here (from Pennsylvania), but I was put in speech classes in elementary school and they eliminated it. Like most of my family from PA., I'd say "wooder" instead of "water", stuff like that.    5. What's the difference between being a Father, and being a Daddy?   Nothing, it's just semantics. The word "father" seems to refer more to someone who is stern, distant, less loving, and the word "daddy" seems to refer more to someone who is easy-going, friendly, and loving, but they really mean the same thing.    6. What is the most recent thing guilt has motivated you to do?   Guilt? I don't think I've done anything motivated by guilt. I can't even remember the last time I did.     7. How do you feel about tips and tipping? Do you feel obligated to tip even if your service is bad because you know the servers don't get paid much? If you've ever relied on tips for your income, how do you feel when you don't get any?   I think tipping is stupid. I hate the practice. Restaurants should pay their employees the same as any other businesses. Why should the customers, who are already paying for their meal or room or whatever, also have to pay the wages (or part of the wages) of the employees of the restaurant, bars or hotels? It doesn't seem fair to the customer.   And yes, I do tip. Just because I don't agree with the practice doesn't mean I ignore it. Bad service will get you a smaller tip, horrendous service will get you none.

        2004: Off To A Great Start...   Not. I had a rough time sleeping last night, stayed in bed until about 11:30am and then proceeded to hack and cough my brains out. I am super congested again, and now my ears are sore and I have a killer headache that won't go away. I tried to nap around 2pm, but couldn't sleep, though I must've I drifted off for a few minutes because I woke up disoriented. I've been on the couch most of the day. I feel really tired, listless. I think I'm going to be in bed very early tonight.  I've been badly congested for a while now, but the earache, headache and listlessness is new. I hope I'm not coming down with the flu or something. With the job hunt and the upcoming gig, that's the last thing I need right now.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  Nothing really. I played some music for my nephew when he was down: Led Zeppelin, Billy Squier, R.E.M., and others... just pulling tapes out at random and playing some for him.      Watching on TV:  When Mom's around, the TV's almost always on, so I caught bits and pieces of a lot of shows, but I haven't sat down and watched TV lately, just been too busy.    Downloading:  Nothing.   Reading:  Nothing.     Jamming:  I had band practice on Tuesday, and we practice again next Tuesday. I need to practice at home but I've been either too busy or too sore lately. I'm currently trying to work up a good set list for our gig on the 16th.     Working:  Just around the house. I still haven't gotten a call back about the job I applied for almost 2 weeks ago.     Buying:  Nothing.    Selling:  Very little. Last week I just re-listed a bunch of stuff, on free-listing day, but the auctions didn't do very well. I need to list auctions tomorrow and I need to list another 100 or so cards in my eBay store.     Eating:  Pizza, wings, Chili, Burger King Croussants, too much breakfast food in general (eggs, tater tots). Bad stuff. Too much soda too.    Feeling:    Mentally: Tired more than anything else, but also worried about money again. I need a job badly.    Physically: Tired and sore. My right shoulder aches, so does my back. My sinuses are really bad right now too.    Planning:  I plan on getting a job as soon as possible. On Monday, I'm going to call back about the job I applied for and go from there. I have to do something soon.

        New Year's Day (Re-Cap)   I stayed in bed until about 11:15am, Jess slept past Noon. My sister was supposed to come down around Noon and stay until 4 or 5pm, but she called around 11:30 and said they just woke up, meaning they wouldn't be down for another hour or two. It also meant we wouldn't be eating lunch together. Mom woke Jesse up, then I got Mom to run to Checkers for us. While she was gone, Jess and I moved the old couch that was on the porch outside to the yard. After Mom got home, we chowed down and vegged in front of the TV until everyone else showed up.   My sister and the other two kids (along with my niece's dog) got here around 1:30 or 2pm. They went out for Checkers themselves and then picnicked out on the couch me and Jess moved into the side yard.   After they chowed, we played Horseshoes. First game was Jess vs. me (I won), then Jess vs. Dana (my niece) which lasted for just a minute before Jesse stormed off (he and his sister started arguing almost immediately). Dana played against my sister instead. It was a close game, but my sister won. Then the four of us played a game, me and Dana versus Jess and his mother. It was a close game too, but Jess hit a ringer on his last throw and they won. It was strange: neither of us could hit a ringer the day before, but I hit several and Jess hit one. Dana hit a few too and even Austin (my younger nephew) hit one.  Austin played against Dana, bur she let him win, then Jess played him, then some kid from the neighborhood, Sean, came over and played him. Sean played with them the last time they were down too. He stayed for awhile and played frisbee with the boys while I set up my Badminton net, which was a pain in the butt. I'm not sure I did it right, but it was workable.   We played Badminton for a long time, until it started getting dark out. Me, my sister and Sean played against the other kids, but we didn't keep score or anything (none of us knew the rules), we just played for fun. Jess and Austin kept arguing the whole time. Jesse was the problem, not letting Austin take a swing and just acting up and not listening. He had been just fine the whole time he was alone with Mom and I, but as soon as his family showed up, he started being a baby.   After it got dark, we cleaned up the yard and went in to eat (Mom had ordered pizza and wings). Jesse started complaining about the food right off the bat. It's like he's not happy unless his Mom is yelling at him. Austin was being jerky all day too, but in a differnt way. He's sniffing and snorting like he has a terrible cold or sinus problems, which he doesn't have. He's doing it for attention and/or sympathy and it's extremely annoying. I think he and Jess are basically doing the same thing.   After dinner, I tried playing with Dana's puppy, but Austin wouldn't let me. He had to have the dog's attention too. Soon, he and Jess started playing with him together and then the arguing started up again. Dana had enough of it and went in, I followed after a bit too, after I'd told them that they're acting like idiots. I just don't understand how they can stand to live like that, constantly bickering and fighting. And Jess, being 5 years older, should know better.   As I was going in, Austin followed, which I thought was odd, and then I heard Jess crying on the porch: Austin had thrown a tennis ball at his face and hit him in the eye. I went in and scolded Austin, again. They're ridiculous. They should be having a fun time, instead they act like assholes. I don't get it. If you have a choice of being happy or miserable, why choose miserable?   They went home soon after all of that stuff happened and after seeing them off, I went in and collapsed on the couch. I layed there for at least a half hour before I finally got up and sat in front of the PC. I wound up going to bed around 9:30pm, completely beat.   Besides being physically tired, my sinuses were bothering me too. I didn't sleep too well (kind of off and on, here and there), so I stayed in bed a long time to make up for the crappy sleep. I stayed in bed until a little after 2pm today.

        2003/2004   I got up early this morning, around 9:30am or 10:30am (I can't remember) and got my mailings done. After I finished with those, I went and woke Jesse up, then cooked breakfast for us both (Mom had already eaten). I made eggs with tater tots and hamburger on the side. It was good.   After breakfast, Mom took off to run errands and Jess and I went outside and played Horseshoes for a long whoile. We also dug several holes in the yard, scooping out dirt for our Horseshoe "court". It was hot out, so we had to keep running in every so often for water.  After we tired of Horseshoes, we went in and watched "Minority Report" (one of my Christmas DVDs). I wasn't sure if Jess would be able to follow it, but he seemed to get almost everything in it.     We ate dinner after that, and then sat around for a while, playing with the cats. Finally, I got motivated again and we walked over to the ice skating rink and played in the shaved ice out back. We were having a snowball fight when a couple of teenage boys saw what we were doing and joined us. Jesse started throwing snowballs at them eventually and we all ganged up on Jess. After a bit, one of the teens joined Jess and we had a mini-war. At one point, I started sliding on the ice and almost did a full split before I went down. Both of the teens slipped in the same spot as well. After the snowball fights were winding down, I set up a target and we took turns throwing at it. Shortly after that, the boys took off and Jess and I did the same about 15 minutes later.   We walked back home, went in and got cleaned up, grabbed some ice cream (Edy's Waffle Cone) and proceeded to watch a Three Stooges marathon that lasted until 1am. Curly was cracking us up bigtime. Mom watched with us for a little bit than she took off to her room. She came out again, later, around Midnight, and then started banging pans together like a maniac when the New Year began. It would have been funny if I weren't so tired from all of today's activities and if my ears weren't still sore from last night's practice. I felt bad because she was trying to do something fun with us but wound up annoying us more than anything. She went to bed shortly after that. Jess went to bed after the Stooges marathon ended.   I've been ready for bed since 12:30am and I can't believe I'm still up. I had to take care of some eBay business and I figured, since I was up and since we're having more company down tomorrow, that it'd be a good time to catch up my blog. I did that, now I'm going to bed.   Happy New Year, everybody!

        A Nice, Peaceful Sunday   Wow... it's been a really nice day today. I never expected that. I've had the TV off almost all day, and there's been a cool breeze blowing in through the front door (which I opened). Very, very nice.   I got out of bed sometime after 11pm this morning. I hadn't slept a whole lot, but I guess I slept enough. I played around on the PC for awhile, then my niece called me and asked me to send her some programs and so we got to talking and joking and I sent her a bunch of stuff. I talked to my friend Sue for awhile after that as well.   I finally decided to get moving on laying carpeting in my bathroom. I figured I might as well get it done while I'm feeling good. It was a pain in the butt, but it's done now... mostly. I need to re-fill the staple gun and staple a bit more and I need to trim the edges a little better. The hard part is done anyway, so that's good.   I listened to Stevie Ray Vaughan's "Live Alive" tape while I was working on the carpeting. It's a bit muddy sounding (the recording itself), but man, Stevie and his band sounded great. I remember when that tape came out, I went to see him play around that time. Besides being a monster guitarist, the man really knew how to put on a show too, just awesome.  After I put the carpet down, I sat in the living room with Mom for awhile and listened to The Animals "The Best Of The Animals" tape. She's been on an Animals kick lately, which is much better than her usual of Barry Manilow or Barbra Streisand. The Animals, I can live with.   She was going to cook chicken tonight, but she decided she didn't feel like cooking tonight, so she went out and picked up some Sonny's BBQ. I played The Hollies "Greatest Hits" while we ate. I had sliced pork, baked beans, coleslaw, and fries. Luckily, I have enough left over to take to work tomorrow. Yay!  After we ate, I had a few auctions going off so I sat down at the PC and did some bidding. I lost a couple and won one, 30 tapes for a total of $5.25. It was hard to see the titles in the lot, but some of the artists were Eric Clapton, Deep Purple, AC/DC, The Rolling Stones, .38 Special, Loverboy, and Asia. Hopefully, they will be in good shape. I lost a bunch of auctions today. I kept going off to work on the carpeting and lost track of time, forgetting to bid. D'oh!  Anyhoo... I have a load of clothes in the washer that needs to be dried and I have a couple more loads to wash (and a room to start cleaning), so I guess I am outta here for now.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  I have about 60 tapes at work now,  2 cases of them, so I'm listening to music everyday. This past week I've listened to Led Zeppelin ("Coda"), Elton John ("Madman Across The Water"), Dio ("Sacred Heart"), Steve Miller Band ("Greatest Hits"), and more. At home I've listened to tapes by Nazareth ("Hair Of The Dog", which I'd never heard before and loved), Deep Purple "Perfect Strangers", and others.    Watching on TV:  I'm still watching "The Simpsons", "Everybody Loves Raymond", and Seinfeld" on a nightly basis. During the week it's "Fear Factor" on Monday, and "Curb Yopur Enthusiasm" and "real Time with Bill Maher" later in the week. I also watched "Super Millionaire" a few nights this week (I love that show).   I watched a movie on cable today (my first in a while), "Bowling For Columbine", which was very, very good. It should be mandatory viewing for every American. It really made me think. I've always blamed gun control mainly on 1) the availability of guns and 2) alcohol, but I now see how huge a factor pure and simple *fear* is. Americans fear their neighbors, and are quick to act, or more accurately,  over react. For example, terrorists struck at us on 9/11 so instead of merely striking back at those responsible, we declare a War on all terrorism and terorists worldwide. We then procede to invade two seperate countries, one of which had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks (and one country who did, Saudi Arabia, recieves protection from our President) and kill hundreds of thousands of people, many who were innocent civilians, women and children, just like those who died in the World Trade towers on 9/11. Does that make any sense to anyone? How can we be the good guys if we've killed more human beings than the bad guys ever did? We are being led by fear and that has got to stop.   Anyhow, if you haven't seen "Bowling For Columbine", please do.    Downloading:  I wanted to hear "The Grey Album", the mix of Jay-Z and The Beatles' "White Album", but I haven't listened to any of it yet.     Reading:  I read most of Ian Fleming's "Casino Royale", but I still haven't picked it back up yet. It's been weeks now.     Jamming:  Thursday's practice sucked for the most part. I was forgetting a lot. I need to make it a point to practice every single day and play along with the songs we're going to be playing during our March 13th gig. I keep saying that, but I don't seem to be able to follow through on it.   Working:  I worked about 26 hours this week. I called in sick on Monday, the first time at my new job. I should have made it up during the week, but I haven't been sleeping well and I've been too tired to stay. Things are going ok. I've been given another report to do, a more complicated one, but that's fine with me; the busier the better. I've also changed the way a few things were being done, trying to make things run a little smoother, so I'm showing a little initiative. Oh, I also learned that I am allowed to grow a beard, so I just might.    Buying:  I won an auction overnight last night for 24 tapes ($9.50, includes shipping). I screwed up though. The guy had two lots of tapes and said he'd combuine shipping on them if I won both. Unfortunately, I put a half-assed bid on both lots instead of bidding what I would have been happy to have paid for each. I wound up winning the less desirable lot for the half-ass bid and losing the really sweet one, which also killed my break on shipping costs. D'oh! The best titles in the lot I won are:  Sammy Hagar "Standing Hampton" (which I already have), Dokken "Under Lock And Key" (which I also have, but need a better one), Dio "The Last In Line" (already have it), Black Sabbath "Paranoid" (also have), Rainbow "Down To earth" (finally, one I really wanted), Triumph "Never Surrender" (another that I really wanted), 38 Special "Strength In Numbers" (I don't have it yet), and Golden Earring "Cut" (another I wouldn't mind having).   Not much that I really needed or wanted. I guess I'll keep the doubles at work. The other lot, the one I lost, was so much better.   :(  I haven't gone anywhere to spend money this weekend, maybe tomorrow, but if not, Monday for sure (Mom's off then). I still want to pick up "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" (special edition) DVD. I want to buy at least two more cassette tape storage cases, and I'd like to pick up some new CDs too. I know I don't play CDs as much anymore, but I haven't given them up entirely.   Selling:  I'm thinking about running some auctions tomorrow, but if I feel the same way I do now, tomorrow, I won't be listing anything again.   Eating:  Soda report: I had no soda again this week. Still drinking a lot of water and iced tea (regular iced tea and my Arizona Ginseng tea). Foodwise, I've been bad all week. I ate 3 boxes of Girl Scout Cookies (Samoas) between Monday evening and Friday night. Then, Mom bought some Pineapple Upside-Down cake on Thursday and I had some. I threw that out Friday night, but then when I came home from work Friday evening, she'd made a "Dump Cake" (cherry pie filling and pineapple with a brown sugar enriched top crust with walnuts in it), which I can't resist. I've been eating that all day today. I think she's sabotaging me. For breakfasts all week I've been eating a Lunchables, no time for oatmeal or cream of wheat in the mornings. For lunches, I've eaten out a couple times (Carmelita's and Roger's BBQ), had a grilled chicken sandwich at the cafeteria downstairs, or else gone without any lunch at all (eating an early dinner when I get home). For dinners, I ate Mexican TV dinners several nights (Mom's taking a break from cooking), had chicken fom Publix one night, fish another night, and chicken, carrots, and potatoes (in russian dressing) all day today. Not a very healthy week, foodwise.     Feeling:  Mentally, I'm tired, exhausted. Physically, the same. Plus, my knees and back are killing me (from crawling under desks, hooking up phones, on Friday). I'm also having some sinus pressure, popping ears, and have had a headache, or been on the verge of one, all day today. I'm not a happy camper right now.    Planning:  I get my guitar back on Monday (they only charged me $35, so I'm a bit worried about that), so the next few pays will go to paying Mom and JP back what I owe them. After that, I start saving for an amp... finally. I may try and get a bank loan in April, so I can have an amp right away and be able to buy my guitar sooner. I'm not sure what I'm going to do yet.

        Sleepy Saturday   I've done absolutely nothing productive today whatsoever. I ate, I looked around on eBay for a long while, I watched TV, I napped, then I ate again, watched even more TV, and that's about it.   I've felt crappy all day long: tired, sluggish, and headachy. Plus, my ears are popping a lot, so I must have an ear problem again.   Nice. Like I need more problems, more things to keep me from getting things done.  I mean, my room is still a mess, I need to practice/work on music in preparation for my upcoming gig (just two weeks away), I need to fold and put away my clothes still (they've been on my bedroom floor for weeks), I need to do laundry, I need to buy some more cassette cases and I need to put away all of the tapes sitting out, I need to re-organize all of the tapes out in the living room (so I can take them out to the flea market and sell them), I need to get some cards pulled and scanned so I can list them on eBay, I need to clean my bathroom and lay down new carpeting in there (Stevie is shredding it out in the living room), I need to cut the cat's nails, I need to fix the video/dvd rack out in the living room, install some software on Mom's PC for her, try and get her hooked up to the internet, and on and on... there's just so much stuff waiting to be done and I'm not getting to any of it. I'm always too damned tired.   I hope I will wake up feeling refreshed tomorrow, because right now, that's my only hope.

        Thursday/Friday   The trend of sleeping poorly at night continues. I barely slept at all last night, getting maybe two hours of sleep in all. Last night wasn't much better. I've thought about calling in to work all week long because of it, getting out of bed feeling like shit, but I went in anyway.   The last two days have been pretty hectic at work too, lots of different things going on all at once, wearing me down even more. At least I've gotten to go out for lunch both days, which ruled. Yesterday JP and I went to Roger's BBQ and today we went to Carmelita's (for the third time).   JP and I left work around 5:20pm and came here to eat before practice. Mom had stopped at Publix and picked up some BBQ chicken, potato salad, pineapple upside-down cake, and even made some squash for us too. Unfortunately, by the time we finished eating, it was time to pack up and leave for practice.   The owner of our rehearsal studio was practicing with his own band in his office and he kept our band and one other band waiting for 10-15 before finally letting us into our rooms. Not a very professional way to run a business.   Practice pretty much sucked. We really didn't get to jam before JP launched into our set lists so we took a while to warm up. I was really rusty on some of the songs that we haven't played in a while. I'm worried that I won't be ready for the gig on March 13th. I'm going to have to start practicing at home more; I just don't do it enough. We worked on some of the songs, making changes here and there (me, as usual), and we goofed around a little. It was pretty loose, but not very good. I think not napping before practice was part of the problem, with me anyhow.   I seem to play better and think clearer when I'm rested. That's another reason why I'm looking forward to our next gig: it's on a Saturday. I'll get to sleep in that day, I should be well rested, so I should, theoretically, play better. We'll see. In the meantime, I have a lot of practicing to do.   I didn't get home until nearly 11pm last night, and didn't get to bed until an hour or so later, which probably didn't help with my sleep problems.   Man, I'm tired.   I think I may just rest up this weekend, I really need it.   As of yet, I have no plans for the weekend. I get paid on Monday, so, fundwise, I'm down to $1 in cash and the above-mentioned check. I could always write some checks to hold me over. I need to buy 2 more cassette tape cases and I'm dying to get the new "Monty Python And The Holy Grail" Special Edition DVD. There are also a couple Hendrix CDs I need to get through the Experience Hendrix website and there are a couple I need to pick up on eBay (or locally if I can find them). I'm hoping my guitar will be ready soon too, but no word on that yet. I have no idea what it's going to cost me either.   I'm not real happy with those folks so far, they were kind of dicky about my guitar and then they tried the pushy sales shit on me (which I do not like at all), so we'll see how it turns out. I'm going to be spending about $1,500 on equipment within the next three months (and probably an additional $1,000 or so after that), so if they dick me on the guitar repair or give me more attitude, they will lose all future business with me.   Oh! I got my RIAA settlement check in today, all $13.86 of it... sweet! Suck on that, you record industry weasels! Yeah, yeah, I know... it's pocket change, but it makes me feel good to take their money. I'm sure they'll just sue some more music downloaders and make it all back in no time. Bastards...

        Wednesday... Not Much Different Than Tuesday   I slept horribly again, no news there. I knew that, with the temperature problems of the previous night, plus the nap I took, it wasn't going to be a restful night. Even with the rain storm, the sound of which usually soothes me, I just couldn't sleep. I think I got up today with less than three hours of sleep in all, probably not even that much, yet I still made it to work. I have truly turned over a new leaf.   Work was a bitch, lots of problems to deal with, lots of things to sort out and fix. Of course, today was the day JP decided to spring a new, more complex, report on me. It was a bit trying. I just didn't understand what I was doing or why. I think I have a little better handle on it now though. I left at 3:45pm today. I ate lunch at the cafeteria (grilled chicken sandwich with bacon, swiss and mushroom plus a side of yellow rice) so I had to stay at least that long, but I didn't want to stay any later. I'd had enough for one day.  On a positive note, I made it back and forth today without getting rained on. All day long, it looked like it was going to rain, but so far, nothing.  I had a package waiting for me when I got home today: one of the eBay auctions I'd won, 30 cassette tapes in a carrying case. They all look to be ok, but they also look to be from the '80's (pretty old), so I'll have to play them all to make sure they work. I just listened to Alice Cooper's "Greatest Hits" and it sounded great, so hopefully the rest will too. I'm really looking forward to hearing some of these, especially the ones by bands like Argent, Foghat, and Nazareth, who I've really never listened to before.  There's no "Super Millionaire" on tonight, so I guess I'm heading to bed a bit earlier tonight (I've been staying up until 11pm).

        Stormy Tuesday   Ugh! I slept like  shit  last night. It was awful. It was warm in my room for some reason. I got up 2 or 3 times to turn the AC lower, cover of an adjoining air vent and to change the intake filter. I moved my fan closer to me and cranked it all the up way up too. Nothing seemed to work. Still, I got up and made it to work.  I dragged all day at work and couldn't wait until quitting time. I didn't even eat lunch. JP gave me a ride home around 3:20pm (he had to leave early) and I lent him the photo I used to come up with the Blue Condition design. Him and his wife are going to go through with the T-shirts and are usuing that photo (which I advised against since we have no permission to use it).  It had been raining since mid-morning and I got a little wet after I got home, picking up trash in my front yard (one of the cans fell over). I came in, ate, watched half of "Curb Your Enthusiasm" and all of "Real Time with Bill Maher" (which I'd taped last night). I can't remember how I spent the next hour and a half, but around 6pm, I went to bed for a nap (I couldn't stay up any more).   I slept too long, until about 8:30pm. I got up, ate my dinner (which had been left out on the stove), and watched the news.   I feel crappy still, but at least I'm awake now. Not that that's necessarily a good thing; I don't want to be wide awake in an hour and a half when I try to go back to bed (I'm going to watch "Super Millionaire" in a half an hour, then off to bed I go).

        Today   Overnight, I won another eBay auction for tapes, 30 of them in all, for a total of $11.25. Some of the better ones in the lot were:   The Cars "The Cars", "Candy-O", & "Panorama", Deep Purple "Perfect Strangers", The Doors "Morrison Hotel" & "Absolutely Live", The Hollies "Greatest Hits", INXS "Kick", Rush "Hemispheres" & "Permanent Waves", Joe Satriani "Not of This Earth", The Traveling Wilburys "Vol. 1", Stevie Ray Vaughan "Live Alive", and ZZ Top "Afterburner".   Not too shabby!   However, that was the highlight of my day (so far). I got up this morning feeling achy all over. I was heavily contemplating missing my first day of work at the new job. I hurt all over, especially in my lower back, plus my sinuses were still bothering me and my stomach was still feeling a little uneasy. I sat down at the PC for a few minutes before finally deciding to do it. I called JP, left a message on his machine, and went on back to bed. I slept until Noon.   I'm still sore and my sinuses are still bad, but the extra rest did help a little. I'll be well enough to return to work tomorrow.   Oh, and I talked to my Mom this afternoon and she said my Girl Scout cookies are in... 3 boxes of Samoas! Woo hoo!  I'm going to go do some laundry now.

        Yesterday   I got up around 11am on Sunday. I went back and woke Jess shortly after I got up. We ate donuts for breakfast again and then I put "First Blood" on for Jess and I played around on the computer. After the movie was over, we went outside and cleaned the porch off.   I ran the hose through the hose and sprayed it down while Jess swept the water out. Of course, I sprayed Jess down completely too. I wound up sweeping the rest of the water out after I finished with the hose. After that, we played catch with my mini-football for a while and talked about stuff.   We got to talking about my grandparent's house in Pennsylvania and so we came in and I put on a video that showed the house and the family there. After we watched that, we watched a little bit of bull riding and then Jess watched some arena football whiile I played on the PC again. I had an upset stomach again and spent some more time in the bathroom.  While I was disposed of, Mom and Jess got on the PC and started playing "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire". After I came back, I joined them. We did that for a long while, until I ran to the bathroom again.  They went out and started putting the furniture and stuff back on the porch (it was dry by then). I came out and helped when I was able. Jess and I broke out the horse shoes and we played 3 games. Jess beat me twice. His Mom came to pick him up just as we were finished the last game.   By the time he split, I was beat. My muscles were sore and my hands ached. Not to mention, my sinuses were going crazy all damn day. I had pressure on my face and kept blowing my nose and sneezing... it sucked!   I spent the rest of the night either in front of the PC or on the couch. I watched the new "Super Millionaire" show with Mom and then I watched some of the bonus material from my new "The Meaning Of Life" DVD before I hit the sack (around 11:20pm).

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  This week, at work, I listened to tapes by Lenny Kravitz, Robin Trower, and T. Rex, among others.    Watching on TV:  In the evenings, I've been watching "The Simpsons", "Everybody Loves Raymond", and Seinfeld" (as usual). I watched "Fear Factor" twice this week, but I haven't watched much else. I watched the 3 movies we rented at Blockbuster on Friday night though ("First Blood", "Creepshow" and "the Blues Brothers").    Downloading:  Nothing.    Reading:  I read most of "Casino Royale", but I put it down a week or two ago and haven't picked it back up. I've been going to bed too late at night.     Jamming:  Thursday's practice wasn't great. I was pretty darn rusty on a few songs. I really need to practice at home more often (like every day).   Working:  I worked about 35-36 hours this week. I had a few days where I got busy right near the end of the day so I just stayed to finish up what I was doing. JP had me learning a little about Microsoft Access towards the end of the week.     Buying:  I bought that Monty Python "The Meaning Of Life" 2-DVD set on Friday, but that's been it for the week. I blew most of my money on dinner Friday night.    Selling:  I still haven't run any auctions as of late. I just haven't had the time, energy, or willingness to mess with it. I'm short on money now, so I really should list some. I probably won't though.   Eating:  Soda report: I had no soda again this week except for a half a cup of Pepsi yesterday that Dana brought down (I mixed it with rum). I drank a lot of water and iced tea this week (regular iced tea and my Arizona Ginseng tea). Foodwise, I was pretty naughty towards the end of the week with all of the dining out I did. Too much fried food.    Feeling:  Mentally, I'm ok. I'm just very anxious to get my equipment and get things going the right way. I should have what I need in time, but as Tom Petty sang, "the waiting is the hardest part".   Physically, my hands are sore from all the cuts and ant bites I suffered yesterday (yes, I'm a moron) and my back is a bit sore.    Planning:  Another week of working and waiting. It looks like March is going to be another month of paying off debt when it was once the month I had planned to buy my amp. Now, April is when I plan on getting my amp and May is when I'll get my secong guitar. I'm thinking I should try and get a bank loan in April so I can have all of my equipment at once. I can't stand waiting. I have very little patience.

        Friday & Saturday   On Friday, JP and I took an hour-long lunch and met up with Jimmy, our drummer, at that killer Chinese buffet out on East Bay. I chowed down on some peel-and-eat shrimp and on the crab rangoon... good stuff.   Mom picked me up after work (around 5pm... I'd stayed late again) and after a brief pit stop at home, we headed up to New Port Richey to pick up one of the kids. My niece was supposed to come down but then she told her Mom she didn't think she was going to come down after all (because she didn't feel good) so I wasn't sure which kid, exactly, we'd be picking up (or if there'd be more than one).  We wound up with Jesse again, my older nephew. He almost always comes down when offered the chance, which makes me feel good. We left there around 8:30pm and headed out for some dinner.   Mom decided on The Lone Star Steakhouse. I'd never been there before, but a steak sure sounded good to me. We split a blooming onion thingy and I had some jalapeno poppers for appetizers, and then for the main course, we all had the Delmonico steaks. Mine was a little fatty, but still, very, very good. The iced tea was pretty good too. The only thing that sucked was that they ran out of rice, so I had to have fries with mine. The service there was great and we all enjoyed the meal.   After dinner, we stopped off at Blockbuster and rented some movies and bought myself a new DVD ("Monty Python's The Meaning Of Life", the special, 2-DVD, set). I grabbed a few "old school" movies that I thought Jess would like. I got "First Blood" (which he loved) and "Creepshow" (which he liked a lot). We watched those last night, staying up until 3am watching them.   I didn't sleep well last night. I was up around 9:30am, and then I layed in bed until Noon before Mom finally got me up. Most of the time spent between 9:30am and Noon was "awaketime", where I was trying to sleep, but not really sleeping at all (which sucks). I got up feeling very tired.   I ate two donuts for "breakfast", got a letter ready to mail, and then stuck it in the mailbox. I went in and woke Jess up around 1pm. His Mom, sister, and brother arrived down here shortly after that.  My sister came down with her husband's pressure sprayer to clean the trailer for my Mom. We had a lot of trouble getting it all set up, and then my Mom had to go out and buy a new hose because ours was leaking too much water.   In the meantime, I played with the boys in the yard. There's this one weed that looks like a flower (white petals, yellow middle) and before it "blooms" it sprouts. I discovered that the "sprouts" stick to clothes like velcro, so we three had a weed war. We gathered up "sprouts" and threw them at each other. It was fun. I also blew up this one big ant hill out front with firecrackers (after I got everyone with a firecracker first, making them jump). I got bit by an ant or two, but it was no big deal.   After Mom came back with a new hose, I hooked it up and then my sister started cleaning the house. I took the boys and had them help me tear apart the couch that had been sitting outside the porch for a month or two now.   That kid from down on the corner, Sean, came by and wanted to help too. He really got into it! I made sure they all had fun tearing it up and I made sure to stress safety with them, but it was I who wound up getting stuck with nails and staples... my dumb ass. I got one in the leg, one in my left palm, and one right index finger. I also cut my right pinky on the fence out in the back yard (my hands are pretty sore right now).    It was around this time that I started getting an upset stomach. I wound up spending quite a bit of time in the bathroom. After I made it out of there, finally, everyone was trying to decide what to do for dinner (it was getting late by then). Everyone was pretty hungry (I hadn't eaten anything all day but the 2 donuts), but no one could agree on anything. I finally suggested The Egg Platter (because they have a little of everything) and that's where we went for dinner.   I chowed down too much there. I had the strip steak (very thin and it was also a bit underdone) with fries (I've been bad with the fried food the last few days) and a dinner salad (which was the lamest salad I'd ever seen outside a church function). I also had some jalapeno poppers (nowhere as good as last night's) and some iced tea. I didn't finish my salad or fries, but I did finish my sister's omelette (steak and cheese) and my niece's chicken parmesan. I definitely overdid it and I felt like crap afterward too, deservedly so.   My sister, niece and younger nephew split for home after dinner and Mom, Jesse and I came home. I got my 4 Dio tapes in the mail today and played a little of "The Last In Line" (which kicks total ass). After that, I went through some of my tapes and gave Jesse a tape carrying case and about 15-20 tapes (including The Steve Miller Band, Boston, Guns 'N' Roses, Stevie Ray Vaughan, AC/DC, Ozzy, Motley Crue, Krokus, Def Leppard, Black Sabbath, and others). I played him one tape that had a lot of oldies on it (from the '50's and '60's) and he seemed to like that a lot. I'm hoping he'll develope a greater appreciation for music. I'm trying to open his eyes/ears to new stuff (most of which is actually "old stuff") all of the time. I just hope he doesn't throw the tapes in the closet when he gets home and forget about them. I hope he actually listens to them and finds things he likes, maybe even introducing his brother to some of it.  After we went through tapes, we sat down and watched "The Blues Brothers" (which we also rented last night) and ate some Orange Blossom Groves ice cream (orange and vanilla, but not swirled... dammit). I don't think he liked "the Blues Brothers" as much as the others, but he laughed at several parts and liked the car chases.  And now for something completely different... bedtime!

        Bored   I'm sitting here at my desk, bored shitless. Everything is caught up and I already did everything on my to do list for today. I found some work on the sales floor that kept me busy for a little while, but now, I'm just sitting here, playing around on the computer. JP started me on a project using Access (teaching me how to use it), but then he went off onto his own project and left me hanging. At least I'm getting paid, otherwise, I'd just go home. I'd much rather be busy.

        Tuesday & Wednesday   I've slept poorly the last two days (yesterday, I think I might've l slept for an hour overall). I've been getting up later and later too. Luckily, and with quite a bit of personal effort, I've been making it in to work everyday. If I were still at Wendys, there'd be no way I'd go in with an hour's sleep.   I took a long lunch yesterday (by accident.. forgot to punch back in) and worked on a set list for the March 13th gig with JP. It's not exactly solid, one set is much better than the other, but it'll do.   I stayed late yesterday to make up for the long lunch (and then some), leaving at 5:20pm. Mom picked me up and we stopped at Seminole Gyros & Subs and I got another one of their killer Gyros. Too good.   I watched the 2nd disc of my new  urlLink Tenacious D  "The Complete Master Works" DVD set last night. Man... some of that stuff is so crude. Funny, but extremely crude. I definitely couldn't watch it in mixed company and not feel like a pervert or something. All in all, it's got some great stuff on it. I'm watching (or more accurately, listening) to disc 1 of the set now.   I'm freaking hungry. I didn't eat lunch today. I got busy and worked right up to 2pm, and by then it was pointless to punch out and take a lunch (since I was off at 3pm). I stayed 'til about 3:10 and then I had to wait for a long time for the bus. It was very, very late.  Mom has some of that chicken and carrots (in Russian dressing) stuff in the slow cooker, so I'm going to go and chow the fuck down now.

        Late To Bed, And Late To Rise, Makes A Man... Er... Um...   I went to bed around 11:30pm last night, after the NBA All-Star game was over (it was a really good game), so I set my alarm a little later this morning. Even with the extra 15 minutes I gave myself, I didn't get out of bed until 8:06am. I had to rush to get ready, but luckily, I managed to make it out to the bus stop in time to catch my bus (even punched in 1 minute early).   It was a pretty busy day for me, I got a lot done, but most of it was data entry stuff, so I sat an awful lot. I even ate lunch at my desk (Mom picked me up a Publix sub last night). At least I had my tapes with me to help make time pass a little easier. I jammed out to a couple Rush tapes (including the great "2112" album), The Law (Paul Rodgers' band), Judas Priest, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and even a little Mr. Bungle. I'd never heard The Law before, some of it was pretty good, very reminiscent of Bad Company, but some was kind of bland too.   I got paid today, but because today was a holiday (President's Day), I couldn't cash it. Mom's going to deposit it for me in the morning so I don't bounce anything, but that still leaves me without cash for lunch and I can't use my debit card to pay for lunch because Mom needs it to make my deposit. There really isn't anything here to take in either. I'm pretty much screwed. I guess I'll just take in a Lunchables, eat it at my desk while I work (so I don't have to punch out for lunch) and then leave early. I stayed an extra 3 1/4 hours today, so I have a little play in my schedule.   I did 3 loads of laundry tonight, practiced on guitar for about 20 minutes (my guitar keeps going out of tune real bad), emptied the cat litter, and took out the trash, but lest anyone think I am totally useful, I also sat on the couch for an hopur and a half and watched "Fear Factor" and "Everybody Loves Raymond".

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  I've been taking tapes to work and listening to several a day. This week I listened to tapes by Jimi Hendrix, Rush, Blind Melon, AC/DC, David Bowie, A.C. Reed, Matthew Sweet, The J.Geils Band, and others. I haven't been listening to much at home, but tonight I listened to AC/DC, Autograph, Aerosmith, and Bad Company tapes. I haven't been playing CDs at all lately.    Watching on TV:  I'm still watching "The Simpsons", "Everybody Loves Raymond", and "Seinfeld" almost every evening. I watched "Fear Factor" and "Everybody Loves Raymond" on Monday (sometimes I remember they're on), and I've also been taping and watching "Curb Your Enthusiasm" and "Real Time with Bill Maher". The last 2 nights I've watched the NBA All-Star stuff, and right now, I'm watching "Saturday Night Live". I haven't watched it for awhile (it's been pretty lame this year).    Downloading:  The Darkness and The Polyphonic Spree, but I haven't listened to much of what I downloaded yet.     Reading:  I've been reading a James Bond book all week, "Casino Royale" by Ian Fleming. I may be the only guy who's never watched a whole Bond movie. The books ok, but Fleming puts too much French language and titles in it for my liking (I don't speak French).     Jamming:  We had a good practice on Thursday, and we practice again next Thursday. We're currently trying to look for more places to play.   Working:  I worked about 32-33 hours this week. I've pretty much got the reports part of my job down, entering data and downloading data from FTP sites, working with Excel, but I still don't understand the phone system and voice mail systems yet. Plus, some of the computer stuff I've been asked to do is a bit over my head. I hope I'll pick it up in time.     Buying:  See the post below for today's shopping spree. I also picked up 2 cassette tape lots this week.    Selling:  I still haven't run any auctions as of late. Tomorrow, probably. I'll need to after I spent so much today.    Eating:  No soda at all this week. I've been drinking Arizona Ginseng Iced Teas and water mainly, some milk too. I've been eating Cream of Wheat for breakfast most days, other days I have Lunchables. Today, Mom made ham and eggs with tater tots though. For lunches, I've been eating out or getting something from the cafeteria at work. I had a shredded BBQ pork sandwich with fries and a Grillled Chicken Spinach salad from the cafeteria, and I've had Chiles Rellenos Con Carne and rice and a Steak Caesar salad with onion rings, eating out. For dinners, I've had fish, pork, and chicken, usually with rice, and sometimes with veggies (broccoli, squash, or carrots). For snack food, I may have a Little Debbie oatmeal cookie if I'm hungry. Last night I had some shortbread cookies that Mom brought home from work. I chucked the rest of them tonight. My dinner tonight has been the worst meal I've had all week (in every way). I had nacho chips, melted cheese, salsa, and some leftover pork. It was pretty gross, but I was too lazy to make something proper.    Feeling:  Mentally, I'm shot. The lack of sleep is killing me. I lose concentration easily, speak incoherently, and feel like crap. Physically, my back has been sore this week and my tongue is still sore (I have a sore on it). It's been making it hard for me to swallow. My legs and feet have been sore a lot too.    Planning:  I made out budgets for every payday from now until July, but if I keep spending money like I did today, they won't work out right and I won't have the equipment I need as soon as possible, so... I need to stay on track with money so things will work out the way I planned (which would be very beneficial to me).

        Spending Money Like I Have Some   I haven't even gotten my paycheck yet and I spent about $175 today. First, I went ahead and won a Boss TU-2 Tuner pedal on eBay for $87.00. I might've gotten it for a little less, but the seller seemed like a quick shipper, he had better feedback than the other sellers, and was mailing it insured. I borrowed money from Mom (I get paid on Monday) and moved it over to Paypal. As soon as it clears, I'll pay the seller. Hopefully, I'll have it in time for Thursday's band practice.   A little later, Mom and I went out (in the rain), to mail out a bill which had to go out today. After I mailed the letter, we headed over to my current favorite pawn shop and I bought 3 used videotapes: "Meet The Parents", "Kingpin", and a tape with 2 episodes of "Sigmund The Sea Monster", for a grand total of $5.35.   From there, we stopped at several Walgreen's stores where I bought a total of 5 cassette tape storage cases for $9.99 each. After the last Walgreen's stop, we went over to Bardmoor Plaza and I bought the Tenacious D "Complete Masterworks" DVD for about $20 at Sound Waves. I'd stopped there to see if they had any new Hendrix CDs in (they didn't).   Mom and I had lunch next door to it, at Panera Bread. It's not my favorite place, but the atmosphere is usualy pretty relaxing. I had half a Chicken Caesar salad and a bowl of French Onion soup with a glass of iced green tea (which had some fruitiness to it). I didn't know they had regular iced tea, which I later discovered, or else I would have ordered that instead. The soup was good, but I'd rather have Red Lobster's Caesar salad anyday (even sans chicken). We went over to Beall's after that, where I bought a back scrubber for $2.99.    So...  After I got home, I filled up all of my cassette cases and I  still  need about two more of them. I also put new clear cases on tapes that had shitty looking cases (not that these new ones were much better). I'll use the rest of the clear cases on the tapes that I have set aside to sell. I may go through them tonight. In the meantime, Mom and I are going to watch the NBA All-Star stuff tonight, the 3-point shootout and the slam dunk contest, etc... I don't know if I'll do much else.   By the way, I am aware that today is Valentines Day, but being alone, it's pretty much a slap in the face to me, with everybody rubbing it in a little extra just how great being in love is, leaving me to think even more about how alone I am. How about a Lonely Person's day? We need a reason to celebrate more than people who are happy and in love... those lucky assholes.

        No Rest For The Wicked   I slept like crap again last night. My mind just isn't shutting down and going into "sleep mode" like it should. I "woke up" around 7 or 8am to pee and I realized I'd just been laying in bed, half asleep, for who knows how long, thinking about how I'm dividing up Monday's paycheck, about how much money I'm giving Mom, etc...   That just isn't normal.   Officially, I "slept" until 10:35am, when I decided I'd had enough "sleep". I don't feel refreshed in any way. In fact, with all of the tossing and turning I did, I got more of a workout than a rest. I don't feel like doing anything at all today.   So much for catching up on my sleep...  *sigh*

        Dead Tired   As I guessed, after getting to bed so late last night, I barely slept at all. To be honest, I don't know how I'm still a functioning human being, because I'm just not getting the sleep I need, night after night, week after week. It's got to catch up to me sometime, right?   Today, it felt like it had.  I stayed in bed until after 8am again, but I still made it to work somehow. I didn't have time for breakfast though, so I wound up eating one of those "Lunchables" at work. Man, I'll tell ya... I was tired before I left for work, but by the time I left work for the day, I felt like I was sleepwalking out the door; I was completely wiped out. It didn't help that I stayed a little later. I probably shouldn't have.   At 3:35pm, after I started packing up, getting ready to go home, JP asked me to stay late and do some research for him and I didn't think to say "no" or "I can't", I just said "ok". I was too groggy to think straight. I had a package scheduled for delivery from UPS today and I'd wanted to be home early today so I wouldn't miss the delivery, but it completely slipped my mind (luckily they didn't deliver until almost 7pm tonight).   I didn't get out of work until 5:20pm.   Mom picked me up and then dropped me off at Pawn Depot while she ran for chow. I didn't see anything there of interest. She picked me up a gyro and a baklava from my favorite Gyro joint. Man, that thing was good!   After chow, Mom and I watched TV, "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire" and then the NBA Rookie Game (which was ridiculous). They didn't even compete this year, it was all dunks and 3-point shots with no defense whatsoever. It was fun to watch (at times), but it says a lot about the state of the game today (plenty of style, very little substance).   I'm going to stay up and watch (or tape) "Real Time with Bill Maher", then I'm heading to bed... no alarm tomorrrow, so I hope to catch up on some sleep and get the rest I need.   Oh, and sometime today (I can't even remember when), I won another lot of tapes on eBay, 39 of them for $16.50. Again, that's more than I normally pay for used tapes, but they had some really good titles including several Hendrix. Here's some of the better ones in the lot:  Jimi Hendrix "The Jimi Hendrix Concerts", Billy Joel "The Nylon Curtain", The Firm "The Firm", Bob Marley and the Wailers "Rastaman Vibration", The Who "Who's Next", The Doors "Strange Days", The Jimi Hendrix Experience/Otis Redding "Live At Monterey", Buddy Holly "Greatest Hits", Tom Petty "Hard Promises", Electric Light Orchestra "Ole Elo", Los Los Lobos "How Will The Wolf Survive", The Moody Blues "Long Distance Voyager", Oasis "Be Here Now", Jimi Hendrix "Jimi Plays Monterey", John Cougar Mellencamp "The Lonesome Jubilee", Van Halen "Women and Children First", John Lennon "Rock and Roll", and The Temptations "Greatest Hits".   There are other decent ones from Robert Plant, The Blues Brothers, Louis Armstrong, and another John Lennon, among others. I got the clear cases I'd ordered in tonight (that was the package I was expecting from UPS), so I'll be playing with my tapes tomorrow, changing cases out. They're not as nice as I'd hoped, most have light scratches or scuffs on them, but they'll work.

        Before I Go To Bed...   I forgot to mention that I won an auction today for 30 cassette tapes (and a tape case) for $14.55. I don't usually pay that much for used tapes, but some of the titles were really good. Some of the better ones are: Steve Miller Band "Fly Like An Eagle",  The Moody Blues "Days Of Future Past", Alice Cooper "Greatest Hits", The Kinks "Lola Vs. Powerman", Nazareth "Hair Of The Dog", Thin Lizzy "Jailbreak", Bob Seger "Live Bullet", Ted Nugent "Great Gonzos - The Best Of Ted Nugent", Bad Company "Bad Company", Argent "The Argent Anthology", and "Fleetwood Mac "Rumours". Plus, there's a lot of pretty good ones too (Foghat, Robert Plant, Queen, Kansas, etc...) and there's even an old Jimi Hendrix rip-off called "Free Spirit", on which Jimi didn't even play on most/any of the songs. It'll go into my Jimi tape collection anyway.  Like I said, I usually don't pay thay much for tapes (because I have  to consider re-sale value), but I've been listening to tapes at work everyday and I really wanted to hear some of these, so... whatever, it's only money.

        Thursday Jam   I slept horribly last night, so when it came time to get up, I just wasn't ready. I re-set my alarm to get an extra 15 minutes of sleep, but then Mom called for me to get up right as I was drifting off again. I still made it in to work as usual though.  Work was fairly uneventful. I stayed busy and got as much done as I could. There were a few things I was waiting for that never arrived, so I'll do those tomorrow, no biggie.   I rode with JP over to the Egg Platter to get lunch today. I got the Steak Caesar salad and some onion rings... it was awesome! They give you a big portion too. I'll have to eat there again sometime.   I left around 3:45pm, got home around 4:15pm, and was in bed, trying to nap around 4:30pm. I never did get any sleep, and I got up at 6:15pm feeling totally unrefreshed. I ate dinner and waited for JP to arrive. he got here late, at nearly 7pm, the time we're supposed to be at band practice.  Practice went well tonight, for the most part. My lead playing sucked pretty bad. I just feel like my lead playing is weak, too repetitive, and I'm just so freaking slow... I really need to start practing again, daily. I haven't even picked up my electric guitar since last Thursday's practice. It didn't help any that the amp I used tonight (the Randall) sounded shitty (too much bottom end). I couldn't even get feedback when I wanted it.   We ran through the newer additions again tonight ("What's So Funny About Peace, Love, & Understanding", "Desire", "I'm Tore Down"), as well as going over some older songs, originals ("There For Me", "Everyday", "Sleeping Forever", etc..) and covers ("Authority Song", "The Way", etc..). We also jammed a few times tonight, some long ones, some short ones. One of the longer jams was basically "I'm Tore Down", but a little different. We jammed on that one mainly to get JP used to playing the Blues (he needs help with his Blues rhythm playing). We jammed on a reggae-like tune and a disco (!) tune too.   After we played "Authority Song", I suggested trying that one reggae style (mostly as a joke, but I thought it could actually work). It sounded pretty good, believe it or not. We may do it half and half the next time, start it normal and then end it reggae after the acapella part.    A little later, from out of nowhere, Jimmy suggested trying "Badge". Al knew it, showed me and JP the chords, and we ran through that once or twice. It sounded pretty good. It looks like we will be adding that one on to our set list too... sweet! And I didn't think Jimmy even knew any Cream!   I am really beginning to enjoy the covers we're choosing as of late. We are going to work on "The Breakup Song" and "Should I Stay Or Should I Go" next. In fact, we ran through "The Breakup Song" tonight to see how much of it we actually knew (very little, unfortunately).   It was a very loose, fun, productive practice. We're booked again for next Thursday. If I'm lucky, I will have my new tuner (Boss TU-2) by then (which I'm going to buy this weekend on eBay).

        A Semi-Sucky Day   As usual, I slept like crap again last night. I just can't get the temperature right; it's either too hot or too cold in my room. I can never find "just right". I laid there in bed,  with the alarm/radio blasting , for 40 minutes this morning. I managed to catch the bus and get to work on time (well, almost: 9:01am). Unfortunately though, I had no time for a shower.   JP was in today and he gave me another project to work on, which wound up taking almost all day to do (and I'm still not completely finished with it). At some point in the day, I wound up in his office arguing with him about his wife and the t-shirt situation. The way he sees it, the band isn't entitled to any profits off the shirts unless the band helps pay for the shirts. I explained that the shirt seller, in this case, his wife, makes back the cost of the shirts in the price of the shirts along with a profit that should be split between the seller and the band (for using the band's name and image to sell the shirts)... a basic liscensing agreement. He doesn't see it that way at all. It got pretty tense after a while. We agreed to discuss it further with the other guys, to see how they felt about it, so tomorrow night should be interesting.  I also let JP know that we'll probably have to stop using the image we've been using on flyers, t-shirts and on my CD cover designs. The photographer, I discovered, has his photos in galleries and is a  real  artist, making art for art's sake, so I doubt he'd grant us usage to promote our band. JP may try and contact him and ask anyway. I guess it wouldn't hurt.  In the same vein, we decided that we need to copyright the band's name or logo, or look into it and see what we can do. I don't think we can actually trademark a name though, and if we do, who is the copyright holder? I came up with the name for the band, but JP has used it the longest. This brings up even more questions. For example, do the other guys in the band have a right to the name? What if we copyright it with all four band members and one leaves; does the departing member still have rights of usage? It's all pretty complicated. It's also stuff we really don't have to worry about too much right now, I mean, we've only played out a few times together, but it will be stuff we will have to figure out down the road.   After the arguing died down, we decided to go out for lunch... at Carmelita's! JP's wife met us over there and we took a long ass lunch (about an hour and twenty minutes). I had the Chiles Relleno Con Carne w/ Rice again... a little spicier than last time, but very, very good. No soda this time though, just water (I haven't had a soda since last Thursday). After we finished eating, JP brought up the t-shirt issue, tip-toeing around it and not really pointing fingers, but it was clear that it was going to be a sore spot with his wife. She just doesn't believe that the band's name is worth anything, but it has to be if she expects people to buy the shirts. I hope the other guys actually care about this issue, because it's driving me batty, and frankly, I'd like to see it end being an issue in my life. Who needs extra bullshit in their lives?  I stayed later to make up for the long lunch and didn't get out of work until 4:45pm. Tomorrow is going to be a busy day too. I usually have a post-it page full of stuff to do the next day, but today I have  two  pages full of stuff, plus a pile of stuff on the side. Whew!

        Alone Again   I slept like crap again last night. The T-Shirt problem (JP's wife is planning on selling my band's T-Shirts at our shows and keeping all of the profit for herself) has been weighing heavy on my mind, making it hard for me to settle down and fall asleep.   I was planning on talking to JP about it at work today, but he never came in (he's still dealing with kidney stones). Unfortunately, that meant I was left alone again to deal with even more problems that I haven't been trained to handle yet.   It's always something, every single day, with the sales floor. The manager over there panics too much. He tells me that suddenly all of the phones are no longer working, that they can't get an outside line, and so I have to try and figure out how to fix the problem. Turns out, they can never use an outside line on the sales floor to call local numbers, it's a rule they have to prevent people from chatting with friends instead of working. The manager should have known that, but instead of stopping and thinking, he panics and calls for help.   Right before that he had another problem, a computer problem, and he calls me to fix it (like the less than two weeks of training I received on doing reports and other paperwork has made me a master programmer). I had to get the computer tech guy to fix it, which the sales manager could have done himself, rather than getting me involved. I guess the guy I replaced knew a lot about phones  and  computers, but for crying out loud, give me a chance to learn before you start throwing everything at me!  I did get a lot of work done today though, so that's good. I caught up several daily reports, learned how to do a new one (JP called me this morning), and I even finished mapping the offices/going under tables to get numbers off of phone/computer connections. My knees and back aren't happy about it, but at least it's done with.  I've really earned my pay the last couple days.

        A Rough One   I wanted to call in sick very badly today. I didn't sleep all that well last night, my legs were still aching, and my tongue, ears, and head still hurt too. But I went on in anyway, dreading the day.   The first thing I did was to finish going under the tables in the sales area, getting numbers off the phone box. Luckily that section wasn't as bad as the other area I did on Friday and I was able to see most boxes by just bending down.   After that, I did some of my daily reports, then JP called. He wasn't coming in today (it's his wife's birthday). He had me make a call to one of the vendors we deal with and remind her to send her report from Friday. She said there was no report for Friday because we made no calls that day, something JP should've known. That's the second time he's made me call someone and I wind up looking like an ass.   Things got worse after that.   The sales floor's caller ID was giving some other company's number instead of theirs and I had absolutely no idea what to do about that. JP's boss was out there talking with the sales manager about the problem and I could not reach JP on the phone (in fact, he didn't return anyone's calls). Luckily, one of the tech guys knew where I should start, and so I went and took care of it (made the call to the right people) and had it working before I left. Whew! A little later, there were two other people that came to me with problems but I couldn't do anything to help them. JP's been missing work a lot lately so I'm getting my trained very slowly.   I didn't take a lunch today. I stayed by my phone in case that company called back about the caller ID problem. I was hungry, but I did get to leave at 3:15pm because I didn't lunch.   Mom picked me up and we went to Walgreens where I got my money back on one of the cassette storage cases I bought on Saturday (it looked used and was stained).   I still feel like crap.

        Sunday Continued   My sister dropped by unexpectedly this afternoon, along with Danny, her husband. She stayed about 40 minutes. It was just her and me for about 20 minutes and then my Mom and Danny arrived (seperately). She looked through the boxes of tapes I'm selling and picked out 7 she liked, so I made $3 this afternoon, which worked out well for me (I spent just a little more than I should have on Saturday). She said they'll all be down next weekend, but I'll believe it when I see it.   I'm not feeling very good tonight at all. My tongue has a canker sore on it or something and it's bothering the shit out of me. I thought at first it was my throat, because the pain seems to cover that whole area, and it's hard to swallow, but it's my tongue. My ear on that side hurts too and I feel like I'm warm, plus, my legs and back are still quite sore. If I wasn't so dead set on changing my life, I'd call in sick for work tomorrow. If I have to, I'll just tell JP I can't do the crawling stuff on Monday. I'm going to hit the sack early tonight, like within the next half hour, so maybe I'll feel better in the morning, after a good night's sleep (hopefully).

        Sunday, So Far   I woke up this morning, cold, thinking I'd slept past Noon, possibly even after 2pm, but it was only around 10:45am. My legs are still very, very sore. I'll tell you, I'm really not looking forward to work tomorrow, crawling under a bunch of tables again.   It's overcast and cold outside today. I turned the heat on after I got up, but it's still pretty chilly inside. Earlier, I wrapped myself up in a thick, soft, blanket and watched last night's "Real Time w/ Bill Maher", which I'd taped before I headed off to bed (sometime around 1:15am).   I read in bed awhile before falling asleep last night. This afternoon, I finished that book, "Breakfast Of Champions", while in the bathroom.   It is a great book, fantastic. It's like nothing I'd ever read before. I'm dying to read more Kurt Vonnegut now.   It's quiet right now. Mom hasn't come home from church yet. I don't know whether she's bringing lunch home with her or if I should just go ahead and eat lunch, so I'm currently hungry. I had an oatmeal cookie a few minutes ago, a Little Debbie, but it didn't help much.   I don't feel like doing anything but sleeping, and that is the one thing I should not be doing. It's already going to be tough trying to sleep after going to bed earlier tonight, I don't need to make it worse by sleeping during the day too.   I definitely don't feel like going through basketball cards right now, looking for some to scan and then list on eBay tonight, even though it's the one thing I really should be doing.   I still need to clean my room. I still need to lay down new carpeting in my bathroom. I also need to take out the trash and change the cat litter, clean the kitchen and dining room, vacuum the house, break down the old couch in the yard and put the pieces in the trash, clean the porch, fix the screen on the porch, fold and put away my clothes, clean my bathroom, and cut the cat's nails.   But I don't feel like doing anything but sleeping, and as I said, that is the one thing I should not be doing.  Sundays...

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  I've got the Psychedelic Furs on right now (their "Midnight To Midnight" tape). I've been bringing in and listening to tapes every day at work. This week I listened to tapes by Willie Nelson, Nirvana, Ozzy Osbourne, Tom Waits, and Peter Tosh, among others. JP thinks I'm retarded for buying tapes rather than CDs, but for now, I'm getting more use out of them than my CDs.   Watching on TV:  Lately, just "The Simpsons" and "Everybody Loves Raymond". I haven't been watching much TV lately. Oh, and I taped the new "Curb Your Enthusiasm" (a dog bit Larry's penis) and "Real Time w/Bill Maher" the other night and watched them both the next day.  I also watched the DVDs my Mom borrowed from my sister: "Johnny English" (sucked), "The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers" (not bad), and "Bruce Almighty" (not bad... much funnier than "Johnny English").   I noticed that the DVD stopped for a split second during "Bruce Almighty". It did that during "Saving Private Ryan" too. I wonder now if my player is bad or if it's normal for that to happen.    Downloading:  I downloaded some Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham stuff the other day.    Reading:  I put it down for a few days, but I picked up "Breakfast Of Champions" again. I really like the book and the way Vonnegut wriote it. He's one of the most creative, original, writer's I've ever read.     Jamming:  We practiced last Thursday (see 2 posts below) and it was a good one; very productive, loose, and enjoyable.   Working:  I worked about 32 1/2 hours this week. Everything's going well. I'm still learning but I'm catching on pretty well and I hardly ever have to use my notes.    Buying:  I bought 3 more cassette tape storage cases tonight, but one of them has to be returned (it looks used, scratchy, and has a white, bird shit-like stain on it). I also bought some index cards and some Aleve. Pretty boring stuff, nothing to write home about.    Selling:  I haven't listed any eBay auctions for a few weeks now. I'm planning on listing some tomorrow though. On a sour note, I had to leave three negative feedbacks today. I haven't had to leave any for a long time. I hate doing it, iyt had to be done. After all, that's what they're there for, to let other eBayers know who they're dealing with. Unfortunately, now I'm expecting some negatives in return. A lot of folks aren't satisfied screwing you out of the money they owe you, but then they want to punish you for complaining about the screw job. Retaliatory feedback sucks.    Eating:  I had a Mountain Dew at band practice (that was my only beverage choice), but that's the only soda I drank this week. I've been sticking to water and iced tea (with Equal) mainly, with 1-3 Arizona Ginseng iced teas per day.  Foodwise, no fast food again this week, though I did have an order of hash browns at the cafeteria at work which I shouldn't have had (I've been staying away from fried food as well). I've been eating grilled chicken wraps from the cafeteria for lunch a lot. One day, I had an awesome burrito that JP's wife picked up for us. It was pretty good, much different than I've ever had before (it had avocado in them and some killer seasoned pork). I wish I knew where she got it. I haven't been eating breakfast as regularly this week. I only had oatmeal 2 or 3 times all week. I had lunchables for breakfast other days. For dinners, I've been eating ok but I overdid it one night though and ate two gyros (Mom had a buy-1-get-1-free coupon). I'm still eating a lot of rice and I started eating salads with my meals again. All in all, I'm doing much better than I was this time last year.   Feeling:  Mentally, I'm not happy yet, mostly just anxious, waiting for things to fall in place. Hopefully by June or July, if everything continues going well, I will allowed some happiness.  Physically, I'm beat. My legs and back are extremely sore from the workout I got at work on Friday. I'm tired still too.    Planning:  Payday by payday, I will be crossing off items from my lists of things I need to do, things I need, things I want to do, and things I want. Right now, those lists are pretty full. February is pretty much dedicated to paying Mom back as much as I can while I get back on my feet again.

        Soreness   Rough day at work today. I had to crawl under about 100 different tables today to get ID numbers off phone jacks. It was just too much bending for my back and too much kneeling and crawling for my knees. I'm sore as hell right now.   I ate half a Stavros greek salad for supper tonight, and then Mom and I watched "Lord Of The Rings: Twin Towers" on DVD (my brother-in-law lent it to us). I saw the first one a long while back so it took me quite a while before I understood what all was going on. I liked the effects a lot, especially the tree dude, but the action was typical of most Hollywood movies in that the good guys seem invincible while the bad guys drop like flies. Movies lose something with me when they sacrifice believability.  I guess I'm going to bed early tonight, like within the next few minutes. I'm sore and tired and can definitely use the extra sleep (no alarm tomorrow). We may go up to see my nephew's basketball game tomorrow and if we do, I'd like to leave early to hit some pawn shops (shopping for DVDs, CDs, stereo speakers, and a guitar amp).

        Band Practice   Well, I laid down for a nap, but I never got one. By the time I was actually ready to sleep, the alarm went off. I guess the short rest I got was enough though, because I played pretty well at practice, which was a lot looser, and better, than last week's.   We ran through the new songs we're adding to our setlists, "What's So Funny About Peace, Love & Understanding", "Desire" (which turned out  really  well), "I'm Tore Down", and "I Got Loaded". The first two turned out really good, but the last two need work, mainly JP's rhythm guitar playing (he's never really been schooled in Blues/Rythm & Blues playing). I finally figured out the guitar part to the Costello song, which had been confounding me for a while now.   We also ran through ELO's "Don't Bring Me Down" and the Clash's "Should I Stay Or Should I Go", both of which may be added to our setlists eventually. I'm really liking the direction we're heading with the covers we're choosing, avoiding the more obvious covers.   We jammed a little bit as well, and Al put a bass line to my old-time blues song that I came up with at the studio last month. We did a couple of JP's originals and I changed part of the bassline, drums and structure of his song "We Don't Need Much". It sounds much tighter and alive now. Everyone seemed to think so too. We still need to figure out a better intro to the drum solo though.   We practice again next Thursday, and I think JP and/or Jimmy is going to look into getting us in at Boomers for open mic night. They think it may help us get booked there, which, they say, would be a very good thing. I've never been there, so I don't know much about the place.   I got home around 10:40pm, ate a salad for supper (I don't think I've ever done that before), and typed out this post. I'm going to bed now. It's late and I have to up at 7:30am. Mom picked me up some Nyquil tonight, so hopefully I'll sleep well.

        Sleepiness   Ugh! What a crappy day at work. I worked my butt off and did everything I needed to do today, but after lunchtime, there just wasn't anything to do. Well, not anything that I  wanted to do . I still have two rows of phones to hook-up, but I would rather do that tomorrow, when it's casual day at work, rather than today, in my dress clothes (it involves a lot of crawling around under tables). Besides, they don't even have to be done until the 14th.   I would've had some work if someone would've sent me some like she was supposed to. I waited for hours on this one lady to send me two days worth of files to work on (I'd called her this afternoon and she said she'd email them over to me), but she never sent them. I sat there and twiddled my thumbs for a long, long time. I was supposed to leave at 3:30pm, but I left 15 minutes early.   On the way home, the stupid fucking bus driver drove past my stop... and almost drove past the next one too. What a retard. I pulled the chain, the light went on, but he was too busy thinking about coming out of the closet or something to notice. What an asshole.   I'm home now, heading to bed for a nap. I have band practice tonight and I don't want a repeat of last week's shitty practice. I want to go in feeling somewhat refreshed. As I noted in the post below, I slept like crap again last night.   And I'm off...

        Waiting On My Ride   Whew! Yesterday was hectic at work. I wound up staying late too, until 6:15pm. It's supposed to be pretty rough today too. The work I do got behind between the time the last guy left and the time they hired me and I'm trying to catch it all up, meanwhile, I keep being handed more and more projects to do every day. I think I need to be on full-time just to have a chance of keeping my head above water.    It probably wouldn't be so bad if I were sleeping well at night, but I'm not. I got very, very little sleep the night before and last night I was awake at 1:30am replacing my fan (the motor must've blown out), so I didn't fall asleep until very late, and then, I was woken up by the cats and my Mom this morning... long before my alarm went off. I'm dreading band practice tonight now; I know I'm going to be too tired to play worth a damn.   Right now, I'm waiting on JP. He's coming by to drop his equipment off and then he's going to give me a ride to work. He's given me rides the last two days (and a ride home last night) and saved me a few dollars on busfare this week. He's been calling, usually around 8:20am, to tell me he's heading out and asks if I want to ride with him. Very cool.  Also very cool, it's 4 days since payday and I still have money. Very unusual for me. I put some aside for this week and for next and I haven't bought very much. I still need to put one of my stereo speakers in the shop though, and I need a Boss TU-2 tuner for my March 13th gig (my old tuner is acting flakey). I also need some more cassette tape storage drawers (I have tapes everywhere).  OK, JP just arrived, so I'm outta here.

        Strange Days   Man... things are going good for me, almost too good, and it's freaking me out. I'm just not used to success in any way, shape, or form. I keep thinking something's gotta give, the good times can't last forever... can they?   Right now, I have a good job, paying me more money per hour than I've ever made at any other job... ever. I enjoy the work and I'm learning a lot of useful stuff, plus it's very stress free and laid back.   I have a band that is actually doing something. We had a paying gig in January, and are booked for another paying gig in March, plus we recorded a demo in a real recording studio last month. We'll also be heading into the studio again, within the next few months, to record a full-length album.   By June, I should have my own amplifier (a  real  one, not a practice amp like I have now), a second guitar (a nice new one which may have a Floyd Rose tremelo installed on it), my gateway bill should be paid off entirely, and I won't owe anyone but Mom and the Student Loan folks. By June, I should be beginning to pay off extra on both of those.    I can't believe how well things are going for me. My life has never been so good, it's really strange to me. Not that I'm not glad that things are the way they are right now, I'm very glad, but I'm also worried that it's all just a fluke, that it isn't going to last.  I'm trying like hell to make sure I don't sabotage it myself, like I usually do. I'm getting up and going to work even when I'm tired from not sleeping at night and I'm staying at work even when I don't feel very well. I'll be damned if I'm letting the good times go without a fight.   The only thing that doesn't seem to be going my way is my weight, which I'm still struggling with. However, I am eating better (and less) than I was this time last year, drinking more water and less soda, so I  am  trying. Only time will tell if I'm actually making any progress there.   I guess Jim Morrison said it best when he sang: "I've been down so goddamned long, that it looks like up to me". I'm just not very familiar or comfortable with happiness, but I'm trying to befriend it and I'm hoping it won't go away anytime soon.

        Sunday/Monday   I slept in late on Sunday, too late, until about 12:30pm. Nice. I knew that was going to screw me up later at night when I tried to go to sleep and it sure enough did. I made it in to work today with less than 5 hours of sleep. Right now, I'm listening to Phish's "Lawn Boy" tape and waiting on JP to arrive and give me some work to do. There's nothing for me to do right now.   Dana went home around 5:15pm yesterday, after watching "Saving Private Ryan" and the "making-of" documentary with me. She left her dirty clothes on my bathroom floor, as usual. She said she wanted to come down again next weekend. It looks like they all may be down next weekend, so that's cool. I can set up my badminton net and we can play that and horsehoes again. Best of all, I won't have to go anywhere and spend money I don't have yet.  I watched about 15 minutes of the Superbowl last night before I got bored. I did my laundry (2 loads) and went to bed around 10:30pm. But, like I said, I just could not sleep... dammit.   At least I get paid today, so that's good. I'll have to take the bus over to the bank after work and deposit my check (and an eBay payment) and get some cash back. I may or may not go over to Albertson's and buy some Jack Daniels. We shall see.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  I've been playing tapes at work every day, Frank Zappa, Robert Cray, Black Sabbath, Warren Zevon, The Band, and others. I also played a few last night, Tony Bennett and the Cars. I've been playing tapes more than CDs here lately.    Watching on TV:  "The Simpsons", "Everybody Loves Raymond" and "Seinfeld", mainly. I haven't been watching a whole lot of TV. I watched my new "Saving Private Ryan" DVD with my niece today. I didn't think she'd make it through the first 5 minutes, but she did. She liked the movie but hated the ending.   Unfortunately, I think it may be a bad DVD. At one point, it stopped for a split second and another time the picture looked distorted. I'll have to look at the disc, it may just be dirty (hopefully).   Downloading:  Nothing.    Reading:  I had started Stephen King's "Night Shift" a while back, but I haven't picked it up again. Instead, I started reading "Breakfast Of Champions" by Kurt Vonnegut Jr. I haven't read for a few days though, been too busy.    Jamming:  We had a crappy practice on Thursday (3 posts down), hopefully next week's will be better.    Working:  I worked about 32 hours last week, hopefully I'll get about the same this week. Tomorrow is payday, my first in about 10 months, so I'm really looking forward to it, even though it'll be a very small check (for 2 days) and most of it has already been spent.    Buying:  I bought the aforementioned DVD and bunch of cassette tapes yesterday, and I won a couple lots on eBay this week (Jimi Hendrix "BBC Sessions" tape set and an 8-tape lot of remastered tapes).    Selling:  I haven't listed any auctions for a few weeks now. I should try and put some up on Tuesday.    Eating:  I'd been off of soda for a couple of weeks, but I had half a Mr.Pibb one day and two orange drinks at McDonalds yesterday. I need to stick with water or unsweetened tea (with Equal). Eatingwise, I had been doing ok, but the many restaurant visits this weeks have been bad (delicious, but bad). Next week should be different. For lunches, I'll be taking lunchables to work, or if I'm really hungry, I'll go down to the cafeteria and get a grilled chicken wrap. Breakfasts and dinners have been pretty sensible for the most part, so I'm ok there. I still need to drink more water though, 32 ounces a day just isn't enough.    Feeling:  Mentally, I'm almost out of the deep water, but I'm still not quite ashore. I think I'll start feeling more and more secure in another couple of weeks, after I've learned more at my job and after I've gotten a couple paychecks and paid off a few bills. I'm on the right track though, and I'm looking forward to life a lot more now. I'm actually feeling positive about things for a change and I'm hoping the good feeling will help me other aspects of my life, like my sleep problems. Physically, my back has been sore, probably due to all the sitting I do at home and at work. I need to start being more active at home. There's plenty that needs to be done.     Planning:  There are so many things I need to do and need to buy; it's all just a matter of time until I get everything accomplished. I'm on the right track finally, and all I need to do right now is just stay on track and everything will work out.

        A Crappy Day   I slept poorly again, about the same as last night. I didn't get to bed early, as I'd planned either (JP called and he asked me to work on set lists for our April gigs). Once in bed, my sinuses clogged up and I couldn't get comfortable no matter what position I got in. Needless to say, it was a long, trying night.   I got up very slowly this morning again also. I made it to the bus stop about 5 minutes late, but somehow, I managed to catch the bus and get to work on time.   At work, I dragged all day. I got everything done that I was supposed to get done and I worked on some side stuff as well. I moved boxes of equipment downstairs, cleaned & tested a bunch of phones, and worked on some new reports.   I also listened to a lot of music today (including Lyle Lovett "Pontiac", The Cars "Panorama", Alice Cooper "Greatest Hits", and The Who "Greatest Hits") and I surfed the net for a while too. Every day, by 3:15pm, everything is normally caught up and then I start to get bored. Right now, I do the side stuff , but after all my side stuff is done (should be done with by Friday) I'll be stuck reading manuals for several hours a day. I'm not looking forward to that.   I left at 5:15pm today, but the stupid bus didn't show up until nearly 6pm. Apparently, there was a bad accident that shut everything down.   I got a letter in the mail from my bank today, that's never a good sign. It seems that last Friday, eBay took money out of my account, which caused me to bounce a check, which I now owe the bank $27 for. eBay was supposed to take money out weeks ago, they never did, and in the meantime, I made a small payment. I thought I was good for another month, but apparently not. Now I have a mess to deal with. I emailed the guy who I bounced on (an eBay seller I owed $18), haven't heard from him yet, but he won't be happy, that's for sure. Ugh!  Shortly after I got  that  wonderful news, I got some more: Mom got home and told me she was in a traffic accident. It wasn't the same one luckily. Some lady freaked out when an ambulance was coming (with it's sirens blaring) and she stopped dead in the middle of her lane. My Mom almost hit her, but she stopped in time. Unfortunately, the guy nehind my Mom didn't stop in time and hit my Mom's car (my future car). She's ok, the other drivers were ok, but the car's messed up a little in the back.   Neither one of us felt like cooking tonight, so we did something we haven't done since January: we ordered a pizza (from Mike's).   I will definitely be in bed before 10pm tonight, perhaps even earlier.

        Sluggishness   I talked to my niece for a while last night. She found a part-time job and yesterday was her first day there (filing at a doctor's office), so I called to see how it went for her. She said her boss was a bit of a jerk. And so it goes.    I slept poorly last night, very poorly. I kept waking up thinking I'd overslept, but I hadn't. Then, when it came time to get up for real, I was still tired. I don't know what the hell is wrong with me, but I am really getting sick of it.   I did very little the first hour at work today. I ate breakfast, organized my tapes and surfed the net... that's about it. Eventually, I got myself in gear and got everything taken care of. I also managed to do some extra work out on the sales floor.   I left at 5:15pm today. I have about 30 minutes OT worked so far. I'm hoping to leave a little early on Thursday so I can get to the bank and cash/deposit my paycheck. I should have a few extra days on this check, so I'm really looking forward to payday, even more than usual.  I think I'm going to go to bed early tonight. I'm wiped out.

        Full-Time   Today I officially started working full-time at my job. I haven't had a full-time job for about four or five years. It's been a long, long time. It'll be nice to have benefits and 40-hour paychecks again. Heck, I may even get a little bit of overtime here and there.   I didn't sleep real well last night and I wound up staying in bed too long this morning. I missed my bus again and got in to work about 20 minutes late. It was ok though, no one ever says anything about tardiness and I always make up the lost time by staying later. I've always been hit and miss in the punctuality department but I've always had bosses who were sticklers for being on time, so this is a nice change for me.  It's not all nice though, for instance, the communications at my job are awful. I spent a lot of time the past couple of weeks looking for the best deals on headsets, doing research on the internet and dealing with vendors. I finally got the best deal available, $60 each, which includes shipping costs (they sell for as much as $125  not including  any shipping costs). I filled out the requisition form like I was supposed to do and I turned it into my supervisor (JP) and he turned it into his supervisor only to be told that they can't afford to buy them right now ("try us again in a month"). It would have been nice to have known that they weren't interested in buying anything beforehand, but nobody bothered to pass that on to JP or me or to the managers out on the sales floor who keep asking for new headsets almost every day.   I guess with that place, the key is just to adapt and go with the flow, which is tough for me because I would rather get things running right rather than to continue doing things wrong just because it's easier. It's a bit of a dilemma for me.   I got a lot done today, all my usual stuff, plus I had to hook up headsets for one of the "departments", and later on, I spent a couple of hours cleaning, testing, and logging phones. I have enough to do all week, plenty of phones left to clean, test, and log, but I'll bet that by next week, I'll be spending a couple hours a day just reading manuals. Pretty boring stuff.   At least I have pleanty of music to listen to there. I brought in about 42 more tapes today. I have over 100 tapes on my desk (in 4 cases). I need to buy a nice player for them. I'm using an old one-speaker Panasonic tape pleyer right now. I spent a little time organizing my tapes today, I have more to do tomorrow (trying to alphabetize them all).  I got my 80-tape lot in today too. Most are ok, but there are about 8 that have the felt pice off or missing. Some were tapes that I'd really wanted, like Pete Townshend's "All The Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes". Dammit. I have about 100 tapes set aside that need that felt piece now. What a pain in the ass job that is.   "Fear Factor" is coming on now, so I guess I'm going to go watch that.   Speaking of TV, last night's episode of "The Sopranos" was pretty darn good (I'm disappointed Feech is gone though, they always get rid of the best characters), but next week's looks like it's going to be awesome! I can't wait!

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  A shitload of tapes, mainly at work, but also at home. I listened to Cheap Trick "Dream Police", Bad Company "Burnin' Sky", Alice In Chains "Dirt", Joe Walsh/The James Gang "The Best Of The James Gang", Iron Maiden "Somewhere In Time" & "Live After Death", among others.    Watching on TV:  I watched "The Sopranos" last Sunday, "Fear Factor" on Monday", and I've watched "Everybody Loves Raymond" and "Seinfeld" during the week. Other than some stuff on the History Channel or the Discovery Channel, that's about it.    Downloading:  Nothing still.    Reading:  Nothing still.    Jamming:  We practiced last Thursday and had a good time. We practice again next Thursday. We are getting ready for the two gigs we have booked in April.    Working:  I worked about 36 hours this past week. I start working full-time on Monday.    Buying:  I won that eBay auction last night (268 tapes + three Napa Valley storage racks) for a total of $62.01. I'd been good all week.    Selling:  Nothing still.   Eating:  This weekend was pretty bad. I had sodas, I had rum cake, I had potato salad, I had fast food (Checkers), I got three boxes of cookies, we have ice cream in the freezer, we have pineapple upside-down cake in the fridge... very bad. After the bad stuff is gone, I'll get back on track.       Feeling:  Mentally, I'm feeling alright. Things are going well and all.   Physically, I'm a wreck. My back, feet, knees, arms, and legs are sore, my allergies/sinuses are a mess... I am totally beat.     Planning:  I start saving for my amplifier this payday. With the longer hours I'll be working now, I might even have enough to get one by next payday (the 15th), which would be perfect since I have a gig on the 17th and another on the 24th.

        Tiredness   I didn't get to sleep last night until sometime after 4am. I had gone to bed long before that, but then I started getting an upset stomach and wound up sitting in the bathroom for a while. Surprisingly, I was out of bed before Noon.   The boys were already up when I got up, Mom had gone to church. We were all pretty sore and tired from yesterday. We just sat around watching TV for a bit, then, after we ate, we went to my room, layed in bed, and looked at pictures in my book on North America wildlife (plants and animals). After that, we headed outdoors again.  We played badminton some, but it was pretty hot out there and we didn't last too long. We went back inside again and I hooked up my old Nintendo and the boys played "Super Mario" for a while. After they got bored with that, we went out back and shot the BB gun at a grapefruit.   After they got tired of that, we played with the football for a while, and then after they got tired of that, we played catch with those plastic hai alai-type plastic ball and scoop things. We started getting hungry, so we went inside to see if Mom could take us to Checkers. I wound up arguing with her for putting on Veggie Tales while the boys were here (her way, I think, of putting some Jesus in their lives... just what they need).   We all rode over to Checkers and we decided to eat there. The highlight of that trip was watching some guy pick his nose. He'd pulled up into the parking lot and started going to town on his nostrils. Because the dining room windows were tinted, he couldn't see that we were sitting there watching him the whole time. The boys were laughing their asses off.   After we got back, Jesse went back to Mom's room, got on her computer and started drawing and painting stuff. Austin sat out here with me and wanted me to show him and teach him stuff about the universe. I drew out a diagram of our solar system and explained how it worked and then I showed him how galaxies were made up of solar systems, and explained that the universe was made up of galaxies. I tried to show him how vast the universe is, how there were more planets out there than the 9 (or 10) in our own solar system, and how far everything is from here. I think he understood a lot of what I was saying, which was cool.   They both just headed home with their grandma about 15 minutes ago. It was a fun weekend, but man, am I beat! I think I'm going to lay on the couch and chill out the rest of the night. I'll watch "The Sopranos" at 9pm, and then I'll probably head to bed after that. That's the plan anyhow.

        Birthday Stuff   I got up early, around 9:20am, and immediately resumed cleaning house. I vacuumed my room and bathroom, cleaned the kitchen floor and cat litter area, cleaned my bathroom, took out more trash, cleaned off the kitchen table a bit, swept the porch clean and then washed the table and chairs out there. All this, and all the cleaning I did all week, mainly because I was expecting my friend Sue over and I wanted the place to be comfortable and presentable for her (seeing that she's a chick and chicks tend to like cleanliness). Anyhow, that worked out real well... she never showed. I'm not real happy about that either, not only because I didn't get any kind of communication saying "I guess I'm not going to make it after all", but also because my sister went and bought extra steaks and stuff because I told them she and JP (my two best friends) would be joining us. Grrrr!!!!!!  To make matters worse, my sister showed up three hours late herself, and then JP didn't show up until almost dark, long after dinner, but at least he did come over. Hell, he even stayed until almost Midnight.  So... the day got off to a rocky start, but it did get better.   My sister, her husband, and the kids got here right around 2pm. Danny (my brother-in-law) brought his gas grill with him (he gave it to us) and I helped him unload it, then him and my sister helped me set up the badminton net.  Mom had been busy cooking all day. She made a ton of food: potato salad, rum cake, pineapple upside-down cake, deviled eggs, baked beans, etc... and a little after everyone arrived, she and my sister ran out to the store, Danny left to visit some friends in the park, so I took the kids outside and we played badminton for about 45 minutes then we went in for a water break and a rest. It was hot out, but there was a nice breeze blowing all day which made the heat semi-bearable.   While we were inside, I remembered to check an eBay auction I was watching and I just caught it before it ended. Luckily, I got my bid in on time and I won it, another huge ass lot of cassette tapes, 268 in all, plus it comes with three 100-count Napa Valley wooden storage cases, which sell on eBay for around $20-$30 each by themselves. I got everything for a total of $62.01. Some of the better tapes in the lot are:  AC/DC "Live" (2-tape set), "Let There Be Rock", "Powerage", "Highway To Hell", "If You Want Blood You Got It", "'74 Jailbreak", "Flick Of THe Switch", "Blow Up Your Video", & "Ballbreaker", Alice Cooper "Billion Dollar Babies", Black Sabbath "Black Sabbath", "Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath", "Vol. 4", "Paranoid/Heaven and Hell" (2-on-1), "Sabotage", and "Mob Rules", Dio "Holy Diver", Deep Purple "When We Rock We Rock And When We Roll We Roll", The Doors "L.A. Woman", "Morrison Hotel", "Strange Days", Eagles "Hotel California", Faith No More "The Real Thing", Iron Maiden "The Number Of The Beast", "No Prayer For The Dying", "Piece Of Mind", "Fear Of The Dark", & "Killers", Jethro Tull "Minstrel In The Gallery", "Thick As A Brick", & "Aqualung", KISS "Love Gun", The Kinks "The Kink Kronikles", "One For The Road", & "Tired Of Waiting For You", Led Zeppelin "The Song Remains The Same" (2-tape set), Metallica "Master Of Puppets" & "Ride The Lightning", Nazareth "Hot Tracks", Ted Nugent "Double Live Gonzo", Ozzy Osbourne "Bark At The Moon", "The Ultimate Sin", "Diary Of A Madman", & Ozzy Osbourne/Randy Rhoads "Tribute", Robert Plant "Pictures At Eleven", Pink Floyd "The Dark Side Of The Moon" & Wish You Were Here", Pantera "Cowboys From Hell", Tom Petty "Into The Great Wide Open", The Ramones "Ramones Mania", Scorpions "Best Of Rockers And Ballads", Twisted Sister "Come Out And Play" & "Stay Hungry", T Rex "Electric Warrior", The Who "Meaty Beaty Big & Bouncy", Yes "The Yes Album" & "Close To The Edge".   Wow! Great titles! And those are just the ones I need, there are a ton that I will take to work too (more AC/DC, more Led Zeppelin, more Iron Maiden, etc...). I can only hope that they'll arrive in great condition though, there was no scan and the seller didn't describe condition much more than a few cracked cases. I won't be able to pay for them until next week though (because of my screwed up payday), so, sadly, it'll be a few weeks before I actually get them.  We wound up playing my "Who wants To Be A Millionaire" PC game for awhile, then, after everyone came back, Danny started cooking the steaks (huge, and I mean HUGE porterhouse steaks plus a couple delmonicos), burgers and hot dogs, and we all played badminton some more, until the food was ready. Mom taped some of the "game" with her new video camera (the one JP sold her).  We all chowed down... big time. My steak was marinated with Stavros' sauce (Mom got some extra last time she was there) and it was awesome. I was stuffed. I also had some potato salad and some baked beans. Some Pepsi too, a rarity anymore. We've got a ton of leftovers, so I know what I'll be eating all day tomorrow.  After dinner, we all went back outside and played badminton some more. Jesse kept hitting the birdie up on the roof and Austin kept hitting it over the fence, so there were several trips up on the roof and over in the neighbor's yard throughout the day. In fact, one of my good birdies is over in her back yard right now. They need to get it tomorrow, before she throw it in the garbage. She wouldn't think to just throw it back over the fence, she never has done that, which is why, long , long ago, she earned the nickname "Haggy".   Eventually, the sun started heading down and it got nice and cool outside and everyone was having a really fun time playing badminton. It was nice. JP finally pulled up around then. He'd called twice today, both times saying he'll be over soon, but by the time he'd gotten there, we'd already eaten and it was getting dark out. He joined us playing badminton and then after it was dark out, the game got much more difficult to play, but we had fun trying. Danny turned his heasdlights on and that helped out a little, but finally, we had to give it up for the day.   We played football instead. JP and Austin vs. Danny and Jesse with me quartebacking for both teams. We played that for a really long time, stopping for water a couple times along the way. I guess it was around 9pm then, and my sister started talking about going home soon, so we came in and had cake and I read the cards that the kids all made for me. They each got me a box of Samoas as well, and Mom gave me the Chillow she'd ordered for me. I wasn't expecting anything from them, so that was very nice.   Mom's rum cake turned out awesome and she bought vanilla ice cream to go with it (I didn't have any ice cream myself). After we had cake, my sister, her husband, and my niece went home and the two boys stayed here.   JP, the boys, and I played football some more, for quite a while, taking water breaks here and there. It was fun. While on our last water break, we decided to go over to the ice skating rink and have a snowball fight (behind the rink, they dump the shaved ice from the zamboni and it's soft like snow).   JP and I wound up fighting against the boys. Jesse was nailing us left and right, but we almost never hit him. Austin, we nailed plenty. I got pooped after a while and I watched them play. We were there for hours. By the time we were done, we were soaked and tired. Our feet were sore as hell from being water logged (wet shoes & socks) so the walk home took extra long and we stopped to sit down for a few minutes on the way. JP wound up having to carry Austin p[art of the way home, which is rough when you're exausted yourself (I know because I had to carry him *all* the home from there once).   It felt really damned good to get home and kick off the shoes and socks, I will tell you that. Poor JP had to drive all the way home in his wet shoes and socks. As I said before, he split around Midnight. He'd had fun playing with the kids too and was about as worn out as I was/am.   After he left, I sent the boys in to take a bath. After that, we sat back in Mom's room and watched TV a while. I can tell they were both worn out too because when I told them I was going to get ready for bed, there was no begging to stay up later or anything, just "goodnight".   It  was  a very good night, and, for the most part, it was a very good day as well. Definitely a day we'll all remember forever, which is what I really wanted for my birthday more than anything else.   It's really late and I am completely wiped out. I'm going to bed now.

        Middle-Aged Man   Just like that Mike Myers sketch on SNL. I've just turned 35, so it's official: I'm middle-aged. I don't feel like much of a geezer yet, mentally anyway. Physically, I'm well past that, way over the hill.   I took my time getting up and getting to work today. I just didn't feel like being there at all. Upon arriving, I got a very unpleasant surprise: I don't get paid on Monday this time, but on Thursday. Of ocurse, I only budgeted til Monday, so I'm going to have to borrow money from my sister until payday.   I had another sorry surprise today too: JP was going to take me out to the chinese buffet for lunch, his treat. Unfortunately, he got busy and couldn't go. It was ok though, Mom picked me up a Publix sub on Thursday, so I had food to eat.   The only good news all day was when I talked to Mom and she said my 300+ tape lot had come. Sweet! I split around 3:15pm.   I wound up working on the tapes all night, organizing them, putting them in better cases, etc... Most of the tapes were in decent shape, but some were pretty much garbage. There were weird Turkish issues, some with sun fading, some home-recorded crap, some with the felt pieces off or missing, some crazy Arabic tapes, and a lot of tapes with messed up covers. Apparently, the guy I got them from hadn't figured out how to put a tape in it's case without mangling the cover. Dumb ass. I paid $65 for them all and I'm not quite sure if it was worth it or not: a lot of goodies, but a lot of crap too.   I did three loads of laundry tonight, changed the cat litter, took out the trash, cleared a little space on the table, and cleared some space in my room, but I still have a lot of cleaning to do and very little time to get it done. I guess I will be cleaning from the time I get up until the time everyone starts getting here (for my birthday "festivities"). My sister, her husband, and their kids should be here sometime between Noon and 1pm. They can help me set up the badminton net and whatever else needs done. Hopefully by 2pm, the fun will be under way. We're going to play some outdoor games (badminton and horseshoes) and have a cookout (steaks, burgers, hot dogs, maybe even some fish, plus Mom's potato salad) and later on we'll have some cake (I think Mom's going to make Rum cake after all). I may keep the kids overnight... unless I get any better offers.    I guess I'd better go and try to get some sleep, I'll need all the energy I can muster for tomorrow.

        Jam Night   I slept crappy last night (I kept getting short-sheeted all night long) and went into work about 15 minutes late today. I was waiting on JP but he was late again so I had Mom drive me in.   I got a lot done early on and then JP gave me some additional work to do, including working with Macros in Excel. I learned a lot today and felt good about that. JP said next week he wants me to on full-time hours finally, so I'll be working 9-5 everyday (well, more like 9:15-5:15). That'll mean an extra $400 a month... sweet! Hopefully it will also mean I will get more training. I've gotten training on how to do the various reports I do and with Excel, but that's about it.   I left around 3:45pm today, half an hour later than planned, and when I got home, I goofed off on the PC rather than taking my usual nap. I did lay down for about 45 minutes though, and I think it must have helped, because I was pretty fresh at practice tonight.   Al had a friend of his come and watch us and he seemed to enjoy what we played. It was a very loose, fun practice. We jammed several times, one of mine (when JP left to talk to someone) and then there was one impromptu jam that kicked total ass (all four of us were playing something different, riffs, but it all fit). We also jammed on a blues, a combination of "How Many More Times" with a Johhny Winters-type riff, so that JP could play the harmonica. He sounded good at times and bad at times. We also threw out some covers just for the hell of it too ("Honky Tonk Women", a little "Funk #49"), worked on some of our newer covers ("Badge", "Willie And The Hand Jive", "(What's So Funny About) Peace, Love And Understanding", "Desire"), worked on one of our new originals, and ran through a bunch of older covers and originals as well. Al and I switched places for a few minutes and he did a cover of "L.A Woman" too (Al played guitar and I played the bass). He sounded pretty good, very Krieger-like.   It was a very enjoyable evening, and now, I'm off to bed.

        Long, Slow Wednesday   Ugh. I didn't sleep very well last night, no surprise there I suppose. I was up to pee 10 minutes before my alarm went off this morning (it was set for 8am) and I still didn't get out of bed until 8:15am. My back and knees were aching bad and I took forever to get ready for work. I wound up missing my bus again, but Mom took me in to work. Good thing she's been home all week or I'd have been late every day.   Today sucked at work. I did as much as I could, but I mostly did a lot of waiting on other people to come through with info that I needed. I thought I was going to be out early today for sure, but then just as quitting time was nearing, I got involved in a couple of side projects that kept me there until 5:40pm. One of them was something fairly huge that I should have been fully informed about beforehand, but wasn't. Nobody communicates there, which is very annoying and very frustrating.   I'm wiped out again. I'm ready to hit the sack already. I have a lot of cleaning to do before Saturday, and Thursday I'll be gone (band practice) and Friday one of my nephews will be down (which means I'll have to entertain rather than clean), so I really need to do some more cleaning tonight. I just don't think I can though.

        Slow Tuesday   I went to bed last night a little after 11pm and likely fell asleep a little after Midnight. When my alarm went off at 8am, I was dead tired still. I almost missed my bus, I was dragging so much. I also went to grab my lunchables out of the fridge (my usual breakfast), but there were none. I asked Mom to take me in to work so I could stop off at McDonalds for breakfast since I had nothing to take in. I made it in only a few minutes late.   I ate my breakfast and got on with work. I was able to get almost everything done before lunch, and then I started working on side stuff.  I worked on finalizing a deal for the headsets we need, but it's still far from done. The whole thing is pissing me off a great deal. I want it over and done with so I can move on. I'm not known for my patience anyway, so this whole process is slow torture to me.    Nontheless, I was going to stay late again today, but there just wasn't enough to do (that I wanted to do) and besides, I was still tired and dragging, so I went home at 3:15pm.  The bus was late coming and when I got home, I had no packages waiting for me.    *sigh*  After I got home, I ate dinner (early, around 5pm) then I went to my room to do some more cleaning. I hope to have it presentable by Saturday, before everyone comes down.   I've been listening to Iron Maiden all night tonight, "Live After Death" and "Somewhere In Time". I got them in with that last batch of shitty tapes. "Live After Death" is ok, but "Somewhere In Time" drops out a little. Luckily, I already have a decent copy of that one. I hope my next batch of tapes arrive in really nice shape. I can't stand handling dirty, un-cared for tapes and CDs. It's a big pet peeve of mine.

        Long Monday   I slept horribly last night. I went to bed later than I should have and then once in bed, I just could not fall asleep. Needless to say, I didn't get up good either. I was on course to miss my bus again, but luckily Mom offered me a ride (she's off from work all this week) and I made it to work in time.   I got right to work and got as caught up as I could get. There were a lot of things I was waiting on, and I was still having a hell of a time finding and ordering headsets for the company, a chore JP so kindly dumped in my lap with no guidance or instruction. I still am not sure how it's supposed to work. I call around, find the best deal, and then I'm supposed to let my superiors okay the purchase, and then...? I have no idea how we're supposed to pay or who make the payment. I asked JP and he said I would be the person who does that, but with what money, and how? The lack of clear and informative answers is frustrating.   Somehow, I wound up staying even later than I'd planned, until 5:45pm. Time started flying by late in the day. The extra hours will definitely help make up for missing work last Monday, so that's good. The best thing about it though, was the bus ride home.   When I leave at my usual time, somewhere between 3:30pm and 4pm, the bus is usually pretty packed. Sometimes I have to stand all the way home becaue there just aren't any seats left. Today, I was the only passenger on the bus for most of the ride home. Ahhhh... very nice.   When I got home today, I had three packages waiting for me. One of them contained the two Jimi Hendrix CDs Mom ordered for my birthday...  on Friday night!  How in the  hell  do they ship so fast? Wow! Unfortunately, the other two packages were pretty damned disappointing.   One was a book I've been wanting to read for a year now, "Live From New York". It's a book about Saturday Night Live made up from interviews with people associated with almost every aspect of the show. There are two versions of this book out there, the original, 572 page book and the expanded, 638 page book. The lady I won the book from listed it as a 638 page book, which would make it the expanded version, the one I wanted, but when I opened the package, I found that what she sent was the older, 572 page book. Fuck.   The other package pissed me off even more. It was a 30 tape lot, which was described as being in good shape ("maybe a little dusty") but was actually  thrashed . They look like shit. Almost every single tape is scratched up badly, I mean,  really  badly, very noticeably. I was really looking forward to this one too since it contained several Rolling Stones and Iron Maiden tapes, which I rarely ever find. Dammit. Besides the conditions being crap, the eBay picture showed them in a carrying case, so I thought they'd be shipped in that as well. They weren't.   I haven't played any of the music I got in today. Instead, I watched TV: "Everybody Loves Raymond", "Seinfeld", "Fear Factor" and then a new "Everybody Loves Raymond".   I guess I'm heading off to bed now, I could use a good night's sleep.

        Buzz Buzz   I've been "busy as a bee" today. I cleaned out the spare room again, got rid of a lot of empty boxes and stuff, re-organized it a bit, and then moved a bunch of stuff from my bedroom into there. I'm trying to make room for myself in my bedroom. It's been a mess for a long time now and a lot of it is because I just don't have enough space for everything. I moved out almost all of the basketball cards I had left in there and got rid of the bookcase they were on. That should help a lot. I also found my clothes basket again, so the pile of clothes that has been sitting on my floor for weeks now will soon have a better place to reside until I fold them and put them away.  I also spent a lot of time today working on my Michael Jordan cards, making an inventory of what all I have. I think I'm going to list them on eBay soon, after I get some money into my account. I have over 1,500 Jordan cards in all, no high-dollar cards anymore (they're long gone), but the accumulated book value is still roughly $5,000 (on the high end, the low end value would be roughly $2,000). If I could get $1000 for them all, I'd be thrilled to death.   I still haven't decided how I'm going to sell them yet. Smaller lots would probably be smarter, but man I would love to move the whole lot at once. I'm thinking now that I should do five lots with values of about a grand each and then ask $200 for each lot. That seems reasonable enough. Still, that means I'll have to go through all 1,500+ cards and price them all. I started doing that today too, but it's going to take a while to finish.   I stopped working in time to watch the first hour of the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame inductions tonight (Steve Winwood continues to impress), then I settled down and watched the newest episode of "The Sopranos" (a great one). I can't wait until next week's!  Holy shit! It's after eleven already? Geez, I need to get to bed! Man, this weekend has whizzed by!

        This Just In...   JP called me tonight to let me know we're booked for a "Battle Of The Bands" show at Boomerz next month! I think he said it's on the 18th, but I'm not 100% sure because he said it was on a Saturday and the 18th is a Sunday. Either way, it could be an important gig for us since the prizes include a shot at going to a state-level contest and possible prizes like 20 hours of free studio time and a potential record deal (yeah, riiight). We've been wanting to play at Boomerz anyway, trying to get a foot in the door there, so this helps us with that too. If we get nothing else out of it, potential bookings at Boomerz would be worth it. We'll be playing a half hour set, so we should be pretty darn tight.   The following week, on Saturday the 24th, we are booked at another club (G.A.) to do two 45 minute sets. We'll have some new songs for that gig, so that should be fun.   We'll need to work on our stage presence, I suppose. We had a few negative comments about that from the last gig. We're not a real high-energy group to begin with, and JP doesn't really work the crowd much (plus he's busy playing guitar during most of the songs), so I'm not sure how we're going to change that.   When I'm onstage, I want to play really well, that's my main goal up there. I want to hit the right notes, I don't want to screw up, so I focus in on my guitar playing. I can't really do that if I'm jumping around the stage acting like I'm hopped up on goofballs or something. Besides, I'm too damned fat to be jumping around onstage anyway, I'd look like a moron. I suppose I could play the guitar behind my head or something, but hasn't that been done enough? Isn't that considered "hack" anymore? I don't know what I'm supposed to do about my "stage presence". Isn't rocking people's asses off enough?   That last line was a joke, by the way. I'm really not that vain.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  I skipped this last week, got too busy I guess. Anyhow, I've mainly been listening to tapes as of late, primarily at work. This week I've listened to albums by The Black Crowes, Dio, Bad Company, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Fine Young Cannibals, and Simple Minds, among others. I have about 100 tapes (in 3 cases) on my desk at work and it looks like I'll be bringing in even more on Monday.     Watching on TV:  I really haven't been watching too much TV this week. I've been watching "The Sopranos" and "Curb Your Enthusiasm" on Sundays, I usually catch "The Simpsons", "Everybody Loves Raymond", and "Seinfeld" weekday evenings, and that's about it really. Bill Maher's show is back on hiatus (dammit) and last weekend was the last "Curb Your Enthusiasm" for awhile (double dammit), so there just isn't much else on that I would watch other than the typical Discovery Channel/History Channel stuff I catch once in a while.   Downloading:  Nothing. Tried to find the new Los Lobos song "Chains Of Love", bu thad no luck finding it. I can't wait until the new album comes out. I'm definitely going to see them live again too if they come this way. Great band!   Reading:  Nothing. I have a ton of books to read too, besides the James Bond book I haven't finished (so officially, I still haven't watched an entire Bond movie or read a whole Bond book). Everything's just too disorganized right now for me to get comfy with a book.    Jamming:  Had a gig on the 13th, which went ok, and last Thursday's practice was a blast. We practice again next Thursday. We'll probably get a bit more serious next time and go oversongs that we need to work on.    Working:  I missed work on Monday, tried to make up for it by staying late a few days, but I think I only got in about 27 hours this week, 3 short of what I should have. I'll likely stay late a few times next week to make it up.    Buying:  A lot. Between last week's Goodwill excursion, today's yard sales, and eBay all week long, I've spent quite a bit lately.    Selling:  I was going to list tonight, but then I started thinking it might not be such a good idea since I may have company all weekend next week (because of my birthday) and it might be a pain to have to send out a bunch of invoices while they're down. I'm bound to have one of my nephews or my niece around all weekend. I still might have a yard sale though.    Eating:  The last two weeks have been my naughtiest all year. I've been eating too many hamburgers, too many fries, and... umm.... too many steaks (did I really say that?). I need to start taking lunches in to work again, I've eaten a hamburger and fries for lunch at least 7 times in the last two weeks, not good. I haven't had any soda since March 13th (I had a rum and coke before my gig), I'm drinking a couple bottles of water a day, I'm eating fish once a week (twice this past week), and I'm staying away from fast food (except for today's visit to Chik-Fil-A), and I'm not eating bread, eggs, or potatoes at home. I eat rice with almost every meal though, and Mom says now that rice might not be so good for me after all. I still don't see any weight loss, but after the burger-and fry-a-thon of late I can understand that. Still, you'd think I'd have lost some weight by now. I just don't see that I've lost any. It's very frustrating.   Feeling:  I'm feeling well. Except for the weight problem, things are progressing and falling into place. The weight problem is a biggie though. The lonliness probably won't disappear until the weight does, which is unfortunate.   Physically, my sinuses/allergies are bugging me still, but other than my back being a little sore, I am fine.    Planning:  I'm planning on having a really great birthday next weekend. My family will be down and if the weather permits, we will be outside playing some badminton, some horseshoes, and chowing down. I'd like to have a cookout or order some ribs, picnic-type food, maybe get some mashed potatoes and red beans and rice from Popeyes, or better yet, some of Mom's homemade potato salad... mmm-mmmm. I think I'm going to have some soda next weekend too, some Fusion (if I can find some) or else some Pepsi. I told Mom I'd like some Rum cake, especially now that she's off all week long and would have the time to make it, but I may have to "settle" for some Carvel ice cream cake instead. Either one works for me. My Mom ordered me the two Jimi Hendrix CDs I needed from the Experience Hendrix website last night, she also ordered me a Chillow from eBay, so I'm pretty much set in the gift department. I also have two huge tape lots (one for 300+ and one for 80+) that should be in next week too, so I'll have plenty of stuff. It should be a really great week for me.

        I Got Out Again!   I went to bed late last night, sometime around 1am-1:30am, and slept fairly soundly, until about 10:50 this morning when I got up. Stevie had been sleeping on me legs, so I got him up as well.   I went back to see what Mom had planned today and suggested that we go hit some yard sales (even though I'd already spent my spending money). She said "ok", and about 45 minutes later, we were on the road.  We hit a community yard sale near High Point first. I'd been to about 4 or 5 in there and found nothing before I finally got lucky. This one lady had some CDs and tapes and I bought four of her tapes (which were all really new looking) for $0.50 each (Boston " urlLink Don't Look Back ", K.D. Lang " urlLink Ingenue ", Molly Hatchet " urlLink Greatest Hits ", and Jackson Browne " urlLink The Pretender "), a Stephen King book for $0.50 ("Everything's Eventual"), two sun/moon table mats for $0.50, and lastly, a 3-person tent that had never been used for just $5.00 (still in the box). I figured my nephews would have fun with that when they come down.   We hit a few more places after that, going all the way up to Safety Harbor. I enjoyed looking at the homes in Safety Harbor alsmost as much as the yard sales, a lot of unique designs.   I found two colorful candles I liked a lot for just $0.75 each, found a  urlLink wolf-shaped jigsaw puzzle  for $0.50, and I found two more tapes for $0.25 each (Bob Seger " urlLink Nine Tonight " & The Black Crowes " urlLink Shake Your Moneymaker ").   By then we were heading towards Clearwater, and were both hungry, so we stopped at the new Chik-Fil-A and ate lunch there. It was pretty nasty, the worst Chik-Fil-A I've ever had. I had a Caesar Chicken Wrap and had to spit out my first bite because there was something gritty in it, dirt from the lettuce I think. I can't stand that, having grit in my mouth, ugh! Then, if that wasn't bad enough, the chicken in my sandwich seemed undercooked, soggy. If all of that wasn't enough to put me off, my iced tea tasted sort of... fishy. I won't be going back there again.   On the way home, we hit a few more yard sales and I bought a baseball glove for $7. I probably should have haggled them down to $5, but I suck at that (I always feel like a weasel doing it). It's not a name brand or anything, but it's a nice enough glove, and I'd been wanting one anyway so I could play catch with Jesse when he comes down, so it was worth $7 to me.   When I got home I found two packages waiting fior me. My lot of 11 Scorpions tapes arrived (they all look very nice) and my  urlLink BB King box  set arrived as well (the tapes are all new, sealed). Sweet!   I'm thinking about listing some auctions tonight, so I'll have some extra money coming in (more spending money). I can rock out to my new tapes and list cards all night long.   I'm also thinking about doing a yard sale next Saturday, on my birthday. I may have a kid or two down Friday night though, so we'll see how that goes.

        I Got Out!   For a little while, anyways. After I got off the PC, I took a brief nap on the couch, then Mom and I went out to the Lone Star steakhouse for dinner. I had the 16 ounce Prime Rib with a side of Mesquite Grilled Shrimp... mm-mmm good. I also had some of their chili (instead of a salad... their Caesar salads are lousy) and that was very good too.   After dinner, I ordered a piece of Key Lime Pie to take home with me... it's no longer... here.   Yum.   I'm broke now, but I'm well fed.

        Friday At Last!   Yeah, I know, I was out on Monday, came in late twice, and I only work 6-7 hours a day anyway, but I am still very, very glad the week is over.   It didn't help any that I slept poorly again last night. I wound up going to bed much later than I'd wanted (I came down with "The Big D"), around 12:35am, and then I tossed and turned all night long. I stayed in bed too late again, and wound up missing my bus. I got to work about 30 minutes late.   The place was chaotic when I got there, there were people working on the phones and JP was using my computer, but everything eventually died down and I was able to knock out everything on my "to do" list. Well, almost everything. There was one last thing to do but I got sidetracked with another project and forgot about it.   I was planning on staying later today, but JP needed to borrow our tripod (he's filming a wedding tomorrow) so he drove me home around 4:10pm so I could lend it to him. Oh well, I guess I'll try and make up some of my time next week.   I don't know what to do with myself now. I want to go out and do stuff, but there's no one here to do anything with. I have $35 I can spend this weekend and I want to go out and spend it, now!  I thought about having a nephew or my niece down, since it's supposed to be a nice weekend, weatherwise, but I don't know if I have the energy to entertain a kid all weekend long, what with the little sleep I've gotten as of late. I'm going to see if my sister wants to bring everyone down on Sunday for a picnic and some badminton. That'd be a lot of fun. Getting her to do it is another story.  There's a ton of work around the house that needs done still, I may get on some of that. I just hate the idea of working all weekend though. Weekends are for fun. I need some fun, dammit! Unfortunately, there's only so much fun you can have alone.   *sigh*

        Thursday: Sleepy & Jamming   I'd been sleeping a little better lately, but last night I regressed: very rough night, very little sleep. I stayed in bed until 8:25am before I finally got up. JP was supposed to pick me up for work (he had to come over to drop off his equipment anyway), but he was really late arriving. I didn't get to work until about 9:40am (I'm supposed to be there at 9am). Even though he's my boss and I don't get into any trouble for being late, I don't think I'm going to ride in with him anymore. I'd rather be on time so I can leave at my normal time. I left at my normal time today anyway.  It was another rough day at work. I got most of my stuff done early but then I wound up having to wait on a few people before I could finish my work. Only one of the three people came through before I went home, so I never did get to finish a few reports. That means I will have to do even more catching up tomorrow, but I plan on staying late tomorrow anyhow, so... whatever.   I got home from work before 4pm and went straight on into bed. I tried to take a nap, I spent about two hours in bed, but I don't think I slept at all... just like last night. Very nice.   On the upside, while I was laying there, I won an auction for 11 different Rush tapes ($9.95 total). Sweet!  JP arrived as I was getting up. He wanted to show my Mom how to use the Sony videocamera she's buying from him ($200, includes Dazzle). Meanwhile, I ate my leftover piece of Salmon for dinner and got ready for practice.   We arrived there about 20 minutes late too. Al was already there, Jimmy arrived even later than us.   It was a very loose, very enjoyable practice tonight. We ran through a bunch of covers mostly, jammed a bit, and even started a new song. Some of the covers we did were: "Should I Stay Or Should I Go", "Willie & The Hand Jive", "Blue Suede Shoes", "I Got Loaded", "Roadhouse Blues", "Calling All Angels", "Voodoo Child (Slight Return)", "How Many More Times/Bring It On Home" (which turned into a lengthy jam complete with JP on harmonica) and "Fell In Love With A Girl" (which we did much slower and bluesier). We also ran through JP's "Promise You The Moon" for his friend Mike, who showed later in the evening.   It was kind of like old times for me and JP, when we used to jam all night long at the old pawn shop building we had access to. We'd go from covers to jams/improvisations to songs in progress, just like tonight. It was great to be able to play like that again.

        Wednesday's Workday Follies   I went to bed on time last night, around 10:30pm, and I still wound up staying in bed too long this morning, until 8:15am. I made it to the bus stop with just a minute or two to spare before the bus arrived. Close call.  I got to work and got right to work. JP came in about two hours later and immediately started giving me instructions for a new report he wanted done. I started getting frustrated because he was telling me to do things I wasn't sure how to do (creating databases and queries). He showed me once, about three or four weeks ago, but that was also on a different version of Access. I got a little pissy with him when he asked me if I was still practicing my Access and Excel skills. I wanted to know when he thought I'd be doing that. Last week they made all kinds of changes that I had to work on, then my computer crashed on Friday and I've been playing catch up since then. I've also had a gig that I was busy practicing for at home, and then I had back problems and have been couched for the past few days. When I was I supposed to be doing all of this extra learning? I'm only working (officially) six hours a day, I told him that he should look into letting me work full time, that way, if I have extra time at the end of the day, I can use it to work on Access and Excel. He said he'd talk to his boss about it. He'd like to get them to pay for classes for me too. That'd be cool.   Somehow, I managed to get almost everything caught up today, There are still a couple loose ends, but I'm not as buried as I was. I have email access again, that helped. I don't know why they didn't set me up with it earlier though. The communication there is pretty horrendous.   I spent a good chunk of time this afternoon bullshitting with one of our computer guys. He has a lot of complaints about the company, but I'm learning a great deal from him about how the place works. It's pretty damned dysfunctional and apparently has been since day one.   I worked until 4:40pm today (lunched on the clock again) and rode home with JP after he offered me a ride. I had been planning on staying later, but I rarely refuse a free ride home (saves me from crossing the highway in heavy traffic).   My back is still sore, but it's getting better. I'm still not resting it enough though; I do too much sitting when I should be laying down.   I hung Mom's "new" (bought at Goodwill) cassette tape holder over her PC for her and filled it with the tapes she wanted in there. I also threw newer cases on most of them for her too. She has a little purple cassette player/radio on her desk and she listens to tapes there sometimes.    Speaking of tapes, I paid off all of my auctions tonight. I now have approximately 425 tapes due in... sweet! I may cool it with the tapes for awhile. I have so many now that I haven't gotten to listen to most of what I have. We'll see if that actually happens though, I'm pretty bad with restraint.

        Back To Work   I slept ok last night, I woke up a few times, but I slept ok for the most part. I think the rain helped out a lot. I should move to Seattle, I'd probably sleep really well there.  It was still raining this morning, sprinkling really, while I stood out at the bus stop this morning waiting for my bus. Something odd occurred while I stood out there today: a car full of older women pulled off the road, parked on the curb near the bus stop, then one of them got out and came up to me asking if I was getting wet... like it mattered. She only got out to offer me a copy of Watchtower (or whatever it was). Religious propoaganda, just what I needed. I politely said "No thanks", and that was that, but it's still very irritating to me.  I got to work right away, trying to catch up on everything (or everything that I could catch up on without my computer). The sales people changed my daily agent report again, so I had to mess with that for a long time today changing the format and some formulas. They change things too often, it's pretty aggravating. I can't even get used to doing the report one way because they change it once or twice a week.   I ate a cheeseburger and fries for lunch, on the clock, while I worked. I've had that a couple times a week lately... not good. I mean, it's delicious, damn good, but not good  for me .   I stayed a little late today, until 4:30pm, and then Mom picked me up and ran me to the bank. I cashed my paycheck, made my deposit, got some cash, and then transferred most of my check over to Mom. I still owe Mom a small fortune, but everything I owed her this year has been taken care of now (the money for my cable modem payments, money for my work clothes, etc...).   After we went to the bank, we hit a couple of pawn shops on the way home. I didn't buy anything. However, I had a package of tapes waiting for me when I got home (Foo Fighters, a couple Beatles tapes, Radiohead, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Spin Doctors, Oasis, etc...). Some were like new, some were used heavily, but none looked so bad they'd be unplayable. I spent some time going through them, putting better cases on them.    Mom made fish for dinner tonight, baked Tilapia (with italian breadcrumbs), and she also some Salmon, which I've never had before. I had a bite or two of the Salmon, it was pretty good. I'll have that for dinner tomorrow night. The Tilapia kicked ass.   I feel like going to bed early tonight. I need to take the change the cat litter, trash out, and write a check still, but then I think I'm going to go to bed.

        The Payday That Wasn't To Be   I got up a little after 8am this morning and immediately started debating whether or not to go in to work. My back and knees were still aching really bad, so I was thinking about taking the day off to rest up some. I probably should have done that yesterday, rather than running around and working in my room, but I didn't.   Today was payday, so I really wanted to go in and get paid. I tried to push myself to go, I even shaved for work, but then I sat down on my bed for a minute to gauge how my back felt sitting (I sit a lot at work) and it wasn't good. I got up, called JP, and left a message that I wouldn't be in today. I figured I'd better lie down, so I plopped down on the couch, covered up, and watched "Johhny Cash At San Quentin" (which I taped last night). Eventually, I fell back to sleep. The phone rang a few times during the day and it was annoying me so I got up to answer it sometime around Noon. It was my sister, she and the kids are home too. She has a doctor's appointment for her eyes and the kids have no school today.   My back feels a little better, so I should get off the computer and lie down some more. I can't afford to take another day off. In fact, I will need to stay later all week to make up for today.   My next two paychecks, after the one I will collect tomorrow, are going towards buying me an amplifier, so I will need to work as much as possible these next few weeks. Or next few  months , really, because after I get my amp, I'll be saving for a new Fender Strat and then I'd like to get an SG (Gibson or Epiphone) and I want a new computer sometime soon. And after that? Well, Mom said I can have her old car when she gets a new one, so I will need money for repairs, for insurance, for driving lessons (she won't give me the car unless I take them) and I will also need money for the recording studio too (we're going to record our own album). In other words, I really need to go full time at work, and the sooner, the better.

        Tape Crazy   I mentioned something earlier in the week about a deal I was trying to get done with a guy for 300+ tapes. Well, the deal is done. For a grand total of $65, I will be adding an additional 300+ tapes to my collection, good ones too. Here are just some of the better titles I'll be getting:  Alice in Chains "Dirt", The Gregg Allman Band "I'm No Angel", Bad Company "Burnin' Sky", Jeff Beck "Jeff Beck's Guitar Shop", Blondie "The Best Of Blondie", Blue Oyster Cult "Imaginos", "Agents Of Fortune", & "Spectres", The Cars "The Cars" & "Panorama", Cheap Trick "Dream Police", Eric Clapton "August", Elvis Costello "Armed Forces", The Doobie Brothers "The Best Of The Doobies", The Eagles "Hotel California" & "The Long Run", The Fabulous Thunderbirds "Tuff Enuff", Fleetwood Mac "Fleetwood Mac" & Tusk", Peter Frampton "Frampton Comes Alive!", Genesis	"Abacab", Guns N' Roses "Appetite For Destruction", INXS "Shabooh Shoobah", Jethro Tull "Aqualung", Billy Joel "The Stranger" & "The Nylon Curtain", Judas Priest "British Steel", The Greg Kihn Band "Kihnspiracy", Kiss "Dressed To Kill" & "Creatures Of The Night", Loverboy "Get Lucky", John Cougar Mellencamp "Scarecrow", Molly Hatchet	"Flirtin' With Disaster", Eddie Money "Eddie Money", Tom Petty "Full Moon Fever", Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers "Damn The Torpedoes", "Hard Promises", "Southern Accents", "Pack Up the Plantation Live", & "Let Me Up I've Had Enough", The Police "Ghost In The Machine" & "Zenyatta Mondatta", The Rolling Stones "Hot Rocks 1964-1971" & "Some Girls", Matthew Sweet "100% Fun", Triumph "Classics", The Tubes "Outside Inside", U2 "October", "War", "Under A Blood Red Sky", "The Unforgettable Fire", "Achtung Baby", & "Zooropa", Van Halen "Fair Warning", Stevie Ray Vaughan "The Sky is Crying", The Who "The Who's Greatest Hits", "Who's Next", & "Who's Last".  And that's only a small fraction of what I'm getting! Sweet!   If that weren't enough, I won another tape lot this morning, 80 tapes for $18 (includes shipping). I probably shouldn't have bid so much on this one as there weren't that many that I wanted out of it. Here are some of the better ones in the lot:  Billy Joel "52nd St.", "Steve Winwood "Chronicles", Pete Townsend "All The Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes, The Beatles "Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", Dave Mason "Old Crest On A New Wave", Liz Phair "Whipsmart", Metallica "Master Of Puppets", Queensryche "Operation Mindcrime", Pearl Jam "Ten", Belly "Star", Asia "Asia", The Kinks "Low Budget", Glenn Frey "The Allnighter", INXS "Kick", Spin Doctors "Turn It Upside Down".  But wait, there's more.   I also emailed a guy about his tape auction that ended without a bid and he said I could buy them for his opening bid price, so I get 30 more tapes for $15 total. Some of the better ones in this lot are:  John Cougar Mellencamp "Uh-Huh", "Human Wheels", & "Big Daddy", Judas Priest "Ram It Down", Iron Maiden "Live After Death", "Somewhere In Time", & "Seventh Son", Mick Jagger "She's The Boss" & "Primitive Cool", The Rolling Stones "Tattoo You", "The Story Of The Sones" (2-tape set), and "Dirty Work".  I probably should have passed on it, but it's really rare to find Iron Maiden and Rolling Stones tapes for so little.   Mom came home from in a good mood today. She brought home two boxes of Samoas for me (as Marv Albert would say: "Yesssss!") and wanted to know if I felt like going out, which is rare for her to ask, so we went out to Goodwill.   As soon as I walked in the door, one of the employees was pouring a box of cassette tapes into a bin and I thought I saw a Hendrix tape in there. Sure enough, I did. But there were also a ton of Led Zeppelin, Van Halen, and others in there too! I wound up buying 25 tapes there for a total of $12.50. I got:  Black Sabbath "Master Of Reality", The Blues Brothers "Briefcase Full Of Blues", Clarence Carter "Hooked On Love", Sam Cooke "The Unforgettable Sam Cooke", Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young "American Dream", Billy Crystal "Mahvelous", The Firm "The Firm" & "Mean Business", Jimi Hendrix "Are You Experienced?", Bob Marley "Rebel Music", Pat Methany "Watercolors", The Moody Blues "Days Of Future Passed", The Police "Outlandos D'Amour", Queen "Greatest Hits", REO Speedwagon "Ridin' The Storm Out", Rush "Exit Stage Left", Saga "Worlds Apart", Saxon "Denim And Leather", Brian Setzer "the Knife Feels Like Justice", The Stray Cats "Rant N' Rave With The Stray Cats", James Taylor "Sweet Baby James" & "Never Die Young", 10,000 Maniacs "MTV Unplugged", The Traveling Wilburys "Vol. 1", and Van Halen "Diver Down".   Needless to say, I'm going to be needing even more cases and storage cases for all of them. Ugh! Goodwill had three of those 3-drawer cases I use, but they were a little used looking so I passed them up. I probably should have bought them anyway, since I will need a bunch of them and since they were only $4 each. Oh well, no big deal.  I also picked up a few books at Goodwill as well (3 for $1):  Stephen King's "The Drawing Of The Three" & "Nightmares & Dreamscapes", J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Two Towers", Shakespeare's "The Merchant Of Venice", a hardcover encyclopedia of American wildlife (with lots of pictures) to share with my littlest nephew, and "The Book Of Myself", a hardcover "self-autobiography" with a ton of meme-like lists to fill out.  From there we stopped off at home so I could drop off my tapes (didn't want them melting in the heat, and then we headed back out to grab some lunch.   We wound up at Longhorn Steakhouse where we both had 20 oz. porterhouse steaks (mine with a caesar salad and fries). It was pretty darn tasty, that's for damned sure! I don't think I'll be hungry for a while either.   I guess I'm off to play with my tapes some more.

        Long Day Rocking   I got up sometime around 11am this morning, after my cats started coming in to visit me. I felt like sleeping some more, but I couldn't fall back asleep, so I got up. I should've stayed in bed longer.  I got up, played on the PC awhile (the damned thing took 20 minutes before I could do anything with it... I need a new one), mailed out my checks, and waited for my Mom to get home (she spent the night at my sister's).   She got home around 2pm, brought home some groceries, a Blimpies subs, some goodies she found at some yard sales, and two new cassette storage cases for me (I owe her for those). At the yard sales she found two more cassette storage cases ($2 each), different brand the ones I use, so she can put those back in her rooms to replace the crappy ones she has now (freebies I got with auctions I won). She also found a wooden CD rack ($3), which I may keep for myself or use as a DVD rack. I can't believe she found so much of that type of stuff, I can never find stuff like that!   After we ate our subs, we watched a DVD she brought home from my sisters, "School Of Rock". It wasn't as good as I was hoping. I mean, I laughed at some parts, but overall, it was pretty weak. Jack Black pretty much hammed his way through it and Sarah Silverman... I think Sarah Silverman is hilarious, but she really wasn't very good in this movie. Her acting seemed so... fake. I hope the special feature stuff will be funnier. I'll probably watch that tomorrow.   After the movie ended, I got showered, got packed, and after JP got here, we headed out to practice.  Practice went really well, even with the changes I made to some of the songs (I'm notorious for changing music right before gigs, fine tuning them). Everybody seemed to like what I did though, so it was all good.   We went from practice right on to the club. There was almost no one there, it was so quiet and empty. That was good because it gave us time to set up and do a soundcheck without any rush.   My Mom, my sister, and my niece, Dana, got there first. I got to sit with them and we laughed and joked for awhile. I was pretty tired already. Dana's uncle and his wife came too, but they split during our first set for some reason. dana's new boyfriend, JT, also came. I'd never met him before, so to thoroughly embarrass my niece, I pretended to be really, really gay. I gave him a limp handshake and told him he looked "fabulous". I finally told him "Don't worry, I'm not gay... Dana is". It's good to be an uncle.   Only one person from me and JP's work showed up, my friend Rob didn't show like he said he would, and no Sue (but at least she told me she probably wouldn't be there). We had over 50 people there, but I thought for sure we'd have more this time.   We were supposed to start at 8:30pm, but we got pushed to 8:45pm to accomodate the people who were arriving late. Our first set was:  "Love The One You're With" (which sounded really good), "The Middle" (which sounded ok, I hit a questionable note during the solo), "Promise You The Moon" (an original, turned out ok, but I had a problem adjusting to some of the changes I made to this one), "The Way" (turned out ok), "We Don't Need Much" (an original, I fucked up a few times during this one, hitting the wrong chord a few times, which I'd never done any other time I've ever played this song), "Yesterday's Girl" (an original, turned out well), "Cold Shot" (turned out ok), "Wild Night" (turned out ok, I hit a wrong note during the solo though), "Circle" (an original, tunred out ok, still needs just a little more fine tuning), "What She Loves" (an original, I was too distorted on this one), and "Desire" (which was great except for one of the times I hit the wah and it didn't click on).   In between sets, JP's wife drew names for free band t-shirts, four of them. The 4th one selected was my sister's! Sweet!  Our second set was a little rushed. We had to cut two songs off the set. Here's what we played:  "Opportunity Knocks" (an original, turned out real well), "(What's So Funny About) Peace, Love, & Undertstanding" (I came in just a tad late, and my solo was pretty weak), "Something More" (an original, turned out well), "I'm Tore Down" (turned out ok, but I took a wrong turn during my solo), "Had A Girl" (an original, turned out well), "Steal My Kisses" (turned out ok), "Sleeping Forever" (an original, turned out really well), "Stuck In The Middle" (we played it just a little too fast, but it sounded good anyway), "You May Be Right" (turned out well, better than usual), and "Rock This Town" (ok, until I started soloing too soon, during a verse).  None of us were thrilled with what we played, it was an ok performance. Everyone pretty much felt the same, tired. We all agreed that we practiced too long before the gig (2 1/2 hours). And then, with the loading and unloading and loading and unloading of equipment, it just made us even more tired. Plus Al, our bassist, just got back from Ireland (yesterday?), and he was dealing with jet lag. For only our second "official" gig, we didn't do half bad. We got paid (I finally paid JP back for the CSN ticket from last year with my share) and we got booked for April (the 24th, a Saturday), so all is good.   All of my people split after our set so I hung out with Josh (from work) and we watched the Greg Billings Band play for awhile. You know, Billings pissed me off last time I saw him, and I was ready to hate him still, but man... that fucker can  rock ! He's just so good and so fun to watch. I'm over being angry and back to being in awe. I was hoping they'd do AC/DC's "Poblem Child" (he did it the last time I saw him and tore... it... up) but instead they did "Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap", which was awesome! Later, from out of nowhere, they played Johnny Cash's "Folsom Prison Blues"... unreal! Unfortunately, I had to leave and take care of band business with the guys, so I missed most of his show.   Neither me or JP had eaten since 2pm, so on the way home, we stopped off at McDonald's. I haven't eaten at McDonalds but once or twice all year, and I haven't had a soda for over a month, but I did both tonight. I got some Chicken McNuggets and an orange soda to take home. they screwed up and gave JP two strawberry milkshakes, so I got one of those too, though I haven't touched it yet ("yet" being the key word there).  Well, it's about 3:35am, I'm tired and I need to go to bed. I guess I've unwound enough typing all of this shit out...  twice . That's right, I typed a different entry here about 20 minutes after I got home (around 1am) and then I lost everything when I tried to post it and I had to re-write everything all over again. Thanks, Blogger!  OK. I'm outta here.

        Late Night   I'm still up. I've been practicing guitar off and on almost all night long. I also talked to my friend Rob for about a half an hour (he'll be at the show tomorrow), won another eBay auction (BB King "King Of The Blues" 4-cassette box set w/sealed tapes for a total of $7.10), did some laundry, played around on the PC, wrote out some checks, ate a TV dinner, and watched some TV.   I think I heard Bill Maher say that "Real Time with Bill Maher" is going on hiatus again... dammit! I hate not having that show on the air! There just isn't any like it out there that's even half as good. He had George Carlin on as one of his panelists tonight... it was another great show.   I guess I'm heading to bed in a few minutes. I plan on sleeping in tomorrow so that I am well rested for the gig. I was playing pretty well tonight (which is nice for a change) and was pretty productive, finally working out lead parts for several songs that I usually just wing.   That I know of, I will have my sister, her husband, his brother, his brother's wife, my niece, and my friend Rob, at the show tomorrow night. Sue *might* go, but it's doubtful. There should be a bunch of people from my work too. It should be a lot of fun.   Now, off to bed!

        More Stuff That Sucks And/Or Blows   Today at work, my computer up and died on me. It's completely screwed, beyond repair, and so was I the rest of the day. Most of the reports I was trying to catch up on, I'm now unable to access, download, format... it's a mess. I also can't receive or send email for awhile, unless I use my Hotmail account, and of course, Hotmail has been down all day today. I should have stayed later today to make up for the long lunch I took (JP and I hit the chinese buffet again), but I'd had enough fun for one day, so I split about 45 minutes early. Fortunately, the next time I come in to work, I will receive a paycheck when I get there, so that should take some of the pain out of going in.  Oh yeah, some very bad news to report: Stavros may well be closing up sometime soon. My mom was in there yesterday (I got my usual greek salad, the best greek salad there is) and was talking to him. He's having a lot of financial trouble due to an illness in the family, so he may be shutting his doors for good, which totally sucks. The world will be a lesser place without Stavros' greek salads in it.   *sigh*  On a more positive note, in just about 24 hours from now, I will be onstage with my band. I've been practicing for the last hour, still don't feel quite ready yet though. A lot of the originals could stand to be worked on/edited some more. Hopefully, things will fall into place at practice tomorrow (we're practicing for 2 1/2 hours right before the gig), I'm hoping to rock the fucking house... hard. I would love to make it as tough to follow us as possible. The guy we open for was a dick to me the last time I saw him, so anything I can do to make his night a little rougher would be just great. I'm not usually vengeful or hate-filled, and I really enjoyed listening to the guy play, but man, he really pissed me off.

        3/11   I'm saddened to learn about the terrorist bombings over in Spain today. It's hard to believe that there are people out there who actually find joy in causing death and destruction in the world. And to choose to do it to innocent civilians, non-combatants, well that's just plain cowardly. I don't understand how anyone can justify these acts in their own hearts and minds.   Now, I'm not totally naive, I could easily run down a list of innocent civilians killed by the US military throughout our own history, including innocent Iraqis we've killed this very year (in an unjustified war), but I'm not going to get into all of that right now. I just want to say that it's easy to kill and destroy, anoyone can do that, but it takes real strength and character to learn how to live in peace with each other. Death and destruction will only lead to further death and destruction. It's a "no win" situation, and that's all I have to say tonight.  Peace.

        A Day That Could Have Been Rough, But In Fact, Was Very Easy   Last night, around the time I was going to go to bed, my PC started screwing up on me again. I think Norton is the problem. I uninstalled it and then re-installed it and, except for a few glitches at first, it seems to be ok again.   I went to bed around 11:15pm last night, with PC seemingly fixed and almost headache-free. I woke up several times during the night and during the morning, but I got out of bed feeling ok. Not sure how much sleep I got, didn't feel like much, but I guess it was enough. I slept at the other end of the bed last night to see if that helped. It seems like it did, so I'll have to try it again tonight.   Work was almost like the last two days except today, I had a clear head and was able to think better. I took my time and did everything little by little instead of trying to get everything done at once. That made for a very easy day, though it wasn't as productive as usual. I left a lot of work half finished or undone, but most of that wasn't my fault. People were supposed to send reports and they didn't, the computer guy was finally giving me my own email address but he had some problems with it, which shut me down for a long while, also, the changes that went into effect yesterday were still causing problems this morning.  But I just took it all in stride. Like they say in Australia: "No worries, mate."   I ate lunch on the clock again (another cheeseburger from downstairs), and left there at 3:20pm. I had to leave then in order to get home in time to catch Sue, who'd I'd like to thank again for the cassette cases (they are exactly what I needed)... Thanks!!!  It looks like I'm going to be working/playing with my tapes all night long tonight. Hopefully, I will make some time in there to practice playing the songs for our gig on Saturday... just 2 days away.   I'm a bit nervous, anxious, excited, and worried about the gig. We're debuting some new covers that we've never tried live before as well as throwing in a few originals that we've never played before (at least I haven't). We haven't had as much practice as I'd prefer (this once a week stuff really sucks), so I'm a bit concerned how it will all come together. I guess we'll see Saturday night.

        Another Very Rough Day   Another night went by with very little sleep. My allergies/sinuses were bad again and I just couldn't get comfortable. My alarm went off for a half an hour before I finally got up this morning and when I did, I felt like total crap. No energy at all, just lots of "blah". I debated calling in sick again and finally decided to just take my time to get ready and go in an hour late.   It didn't quite go down that way.   I took my time getting ready, even had some oatmeal for breakfast, but just as I got to the bus stop, I noticed a bus had just gone by. I had no way of knowing which one it was, but after waiting at the bus stop for about a half an hour, it was obvious that it had been mine.  I got to work an hour and twenty minutes late and when I walked into my office, it was nothing but chaos. JP and the sales floor supervisor were arguing about changes they wanted made while JP was trying to figure out how to accomodate them. Almost all day was like that. The worst part was trying to do this one particular daily report that I have to do. They changed the way they want it done but no one can agree on which way that is yet, which confuses the hell out of me because I don't fully understand everything that they're saying, all these terms and numbers and whatnot... ugh! It's a damned mess.   I started getting a migraine headache almost as soon as I got to work, and it's still raging on right now.  Eventually, I took care of everything I had to take care of (except for that one report), did all my usual reports and chores, and then I had to call around for pricing on headphones. I stayed until 5:20pm again, I was more than ready to get the hell out of there.   After I got home, I got a nice surprise from my Mom. She picked me up a hardcover book (Tim Allen's "I'm Not Really Here") for $1 at the Salvation Army this afternoon. It looks like it's never been read. His first book was really funny, so I'm looking forward to reading this one.  I also got another, even better, surprise from Sue: she was able to get me some tape cases from her work, which I am very excited and happy about (even though I probably didn't sound all that excited and happy on the phone... see the paragraphs above). Hopefully I will have them in my greedy little mits tomorrow, which would kick ass! Woo hoo!  I was planning on practicing the guitar tonight, but my head is hurting so bad, I don't think I could take the noise right now. It'd be like daggers in the ears.   I really need to sleep. I might just go on and go to bed now.

        A Very Rough Day   This whole day has been pretty rough for me. I slept poorly again last night, even though I went to bed early (around 10:20pm). My allergies/sinuses were acting up again. I think I got maybe 2 or 3 hours of sleep all night.   I didn't get up until 8:20am, 10-15 minutes before I'm supposed to head out for the bus. I laid in bed listening to the alarm/radio for almost an hour before I finally got up. As soon as I was out of bed, I was debating whether or not to call in sick for work. I pushed myself to get ready for work anyhow, no matter how late is was getting or how rotten I felt. As I was leaving the house, I saw a bus go by and I almost turned back then, but I went on to the bus stop anyway. I told myself I'd wait another 5 minutes and see if my bus comes (just in case the one that went by wasn't mine). I figured if I missed the bus, then I'll just go home and call in sick, but if I didn't miss it, I'll go in. It came about 2 minutes later.  I got all of my work caught up by Noon, ate lunch at my desk (chicken salad and 2 oatmeal cookies... on the clock), started a new project (pulled all the phone equipment out of storage to test everything) and was planning on leaving work at 3:15pm today. It had been a fairly easy day, but then, suddenly, around 2pm, I got slammed. People were calling me to come fix their phones, reports that I'd been waiting for came in finally, and when I tried to do the reports, the computer started freezing up on me. Ugh! I didn't get out of there until 5:20pm.   The worst part is that I have a ton of stuff to do now, inventories, projects, reports, computer work, paperwork, etc... I don't think I'll be able to get everything done this week, let alone tomorrow. I'll probably have to stay late for a while, which sucks, because I was planning on using my free time to practice up for the gig on Saturday night.   If all that wasn't crappy enough, a tape lot that I had been waiting on for almost a month finally arrived today and the tapes are in awful condition. Almost half of them have the little felt piece on the bottom missing, some look eaten, and most look like they've been dragged down the street behind a 10-year old's bike. Of course, the seller never mentioned any of that in the eBay item description... asshole.   I wish I had a jacuzzi and a cold bottle of wine, I sure could use 'em right now.

        Sign O' The Times   Same shit, different day: some more corporate slimeballs getting even richer at the expense of working men and women...    Kraft bonuses: $10M amid layoffs     Food maker has to lay off 6,000 workers and close 20 plants, but execs still got paid big bonuses. March 6, 2004: 5:22 PM EST    CHICAGO (Reuters) - Bonuses totaling more than $10 million were paid out to five Kraft Foods Inc. executives at the end of 2003, even as the giant food maker made plans to lay off thousands of workers.   In its annual proxy statement released on Friday, Kraft said the biggest payout, a $3.7-million bonus, was made to chief executive Roger Deromedi.   Former co-CEO Betsy Holden got $3.5 million, sweetening her demotion to global marketing chief in December.   Other payments were $1.3 million for North American President David Johnson, $900,000 for international boss Hugh Roberts and $1.2 million for global supply chain Executive Vice President Franz-Josef Vogelsang.   The maker of Velveeta cheese, Ritz crackers and Maxwell House coffee has struggled to meet Wall Street expectations lately, hurt by a lack of attractive new products and by cheaper competition in some sectors.   In January, Chicago-based Kraft said it would cut about 6,000 jobs and close 20 plants as it tried to restore growth.   An experiment in joint leadership, with Deromedi in charge of Kraft's international operations and Holden running the North American business, ended on Dec. 16.   The bonuses paid by Northbrook, Illinois-based Kraft were made under a three-year incentive plan covering 2001 to 2003.   Kraft said the plan aimed to focus executives on the achievement of long-term financial and strategic goals that have a positive impact on stockholder returns.   Kraft shares closed at $34.12 on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, up 1.8 percent but far below its 2002 high near $40.00. Kraft shares fell 17 percent in 2003, even as the Standard & Poor's index of large-cap food stocks rose more than 5 percent.   So... they put 6,000 people out of work, close down 20 plants, help the company lose value on the stock market, and then they go and give themselves a huge monetary pat on the back? For what? For running the company so poorly? That deserves rewarding nowadays? OK... job well done, you incompetant fucking vermin.  I would suggest boycotting any and all Kraft products, but you what? A successful boycott would only hurt the remaining workers, who'd likely lose  their  jobs. The greedy bastards, "higher-up-the-chain", already got their money, they've been paid, quite handsomely, thank you very much. They're just about untouchable.   And that's another problem with these leeches: even if you fire them, they get to walk away with their "golden parachutes", a few million more to tide them over until they find another company to bleed.  Corporate America sucks.

        Sleepy Monday     I knew it was a bad idea to stay up and watch "Phone Booth". It was an ok movie, but it probably not worth staying up for.  It had come on after the new "Curb Your Enthusiasm" (which came on after the new "Sopranos"). I'd wanted to see it ever since SNL did a spoof on it. Like I said, it was ok: I wouldn't watch it again or recommend it to anyone though.   After that I checked out eBay until after Midnight and then organized my tapes some more, not heading to bed until about 12:30am. Not a good idea. I should have went to bed much earlier, because I could've used the extra sleep time.  I slept terribly last night, what little I actually slept, and then I stayed in bed too long this morning (until 8:10am). I almost missing my bus this morning because of my late start. If I had arrived 2 or 3 minutes later than I did, I would have missed it for sure. Luckily, I made it to work ok, and I got all of my work done for the day before 1pm.   I've been rocking out all day, to Dokken, Black Sabbath, AC/DC, and even Bon Jovi (their first album, before they became pop stars). I've also surfed the net quite a bit and eaten lunch on the clock. There's very little to do right now. I guess I could be reading training manuals and stuff, but I always learn better by doing things rather than reading about how to do them.   I'm out of here in an hour or so, so I guess I'm going to go try and find something useful to do.   Oh, by the way, last night's "Sopranos" was decent, but I really don't care for the whole bear thing. They've already shown previews where AJ's face is fucked up, so it seems obvious that he's going to get mauled. That's a pretty far stretch. You'd think a mob boss would have his yard and property fenced in or walled in. I hope the bear is just a diversion, that something else is going to happen to AJ and they're just throwing the bear in to mess with us. I guess I'll find out soon enough.

        Sleepy Sunday   I got up around 9:30am this morning to pee, then went back to bed and slept until 1:30pm. After I got up, the first thing I noticed was that the AC was not working again. It must have froze up again... not good.   I opened up some windows and the front door, then sat down to eat some pancakes that Mom had brought home for me. Pancakes after Noon, and before 8pm, just seems wrong to me for some reason.   Anyhow, after the pancakes, I went to my room and practiced guitar (playing along with a CD of JP's demos) for half an hour. I started getting sleepy so I put on a Cars tape ("Panorama") and went back to bed. I listened to the whole tape, and then it was naptime.   I slept until 5:30pm, when Mom woke me up. I won an eBay auction from a seller here in Clearwater and he said I could come by tonight and pick the tapes up (36 of them) so I wouldn't have to pay for shipping (which was $6).   Mom and I drove over there, found his place, and I gave him the $5 for the tapes plus an extra $1 for his eBay fees. The tapes looked very nice, mostly newer stuff. The AC/DC "High Voltage" tape was one of the new, remastered ones! Sweet! I also got a double Judas Priest set, "Metal Works '73 - '93", Slade "Keep Your Hands Off My Power Supply", Alanis Morissette "Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie", Taj Mahal "Taj's Blues", Jerry Lee Lewis "Original Sun Greatest Hits", Lou Reed "Magic and Loss", Smashing Pumpkins "Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness" (another 2-tape set), Lucinda Williams "Sweet Old World", and more. Really nice lot, especially for a total of $6.   On the way home, we stopped off at Ya-Ya's and got two chicken dinners to take home. We'd never eaten there before. It was pretty decent, nothing special though. I'd always heard that Ya-Ya's was awesome... eh.   Now I'm waiting.  Waiting.  Waiting.   For what, you may ask? Tonight is the night "The Sopranos" return! Only about 90 more minutes to go. Woo hoo!

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  I listened to my new Mitch Hedberg CD this past week and also Doyle Bramhall II's great "Welcome" CD, but I've mainly been listening to tapes. I've listened to a whole lotta Led Zeppelin (that's pretty much all I listened to at work on Friday), as well as tapes by Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, Steve Miller Band, Van Halen, R.E.M., Paul Simon, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Dio (among others).   Watching on TV:  I've been watching my usual evening TV fare: "The Simpsons", "Everybody Loves Raymond", and "Seinfeld". I also watched "Real Time with Bill Maher", "Curb Your Enthusiasm", and I caught the 100th episode of "Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn", which I never get to watch anymore (it's on too late). I watched Robert Plant on "Austin City Limits" last night. I've also watched my new Triumph The Insult Comic Dog and Mitch Hedberg DVDs, as well as bits of my new "Monty Python And The Holy Grail" DVD.   Downloading:  I downloaded some stuff for Mom at work (I was going to burn her a CD) but I couldn't find enough of the album she wanted ("The Mask Of Zorro" soundtrack").    Reading:  Nothing. Still have a half-finished "Casino Royale" laying next to my bed.     Jamming:  We practiced on Thursday and it went ok. Our next practice is next Saturday, right before our gig that night. I'm going to have to practice hard this week.   I had Mike over today for an hour or so today (he came by to put freon in the AC... it works again) and I showed him a bunch of stuff on the guitar. He's just beginning.    Working:  I only worked about 31-32 hours this past week. It's been so slow, I just didn't feel like staying any later.     Buying:  Today we hit a yard sale in the park and I spent $3 on two candles, Hidden Horror Coffin Candles (it looks like a tombstone, but as the wax melts, it exposes a scary looking skeleton underneath), and a book ("Creature" by John Saul). They were pretty much pity buys as the guy selling them kept talking about his wife just dying and about him possibly losing his home. I also won those two eBay auctions this weekend.   Selling:  Nothing still, maybe tomorrow.    Eating:  I've been eating Lunchable for breakfasts lately, not getting up early enough for anything better. For lunches, I had leftover Sonnys sliced pork and baked beans one day and I had Publix chicken salads on two other days (two different types of chicken salad too) and ate a couple of Little Debbie oatmeal cookies with them. I went without lunch one day and went out to the Chinese Buffet another day. Today, I had a Whopper and a side of onion rings. I've always eaten 2 burgers per meal (which explains a lot, huh?), so even though it was fast food (which I rarely eat anymore), I ate less than I normally would have. For dinners, I've had chicken, pork, and fish. Usually with a side of rice, sometimes with broccoli. Tonight it was with pork with a side of that green beans/bacon/onions stuff Mom makes. Soda report: still no sodas. It's been a long while too. I'm also eating a lot less red meat, less cheese, and less bread. Still too much milk though, and not enough veggies and fruits.     Feeling:  Mentally, I'm a bit anxious. Everything I need or need to do right now will take time and waiting is something I'm not good at (unless it has to do with me doing chores, then I'm pretty good at waiting).   Physically, my toothache is beginning to disappear, but I have a split heel and my back aches still. Also, my allergies/sinuses are kicking my ass lately too. I'm sneezing like mad or else my eyes are itchy or watery. It's been a long time since I felt well, physically.   Planning:  I need to practice up for the gig next Saturdayt night. I need to call a few people and remind them of the gig. I need to get my equipment ready for the gig. Pretty much, the gig is the thing at the moment.

        It Didn't Blow... It Sucked   I stayed up late last night watching "Real Time with Bill Maher" and then I watched Robert Plant on "Austin City Limits" (an amazing performance) before I finally took the trash out and headed to bed. It must've been around 2am before I got into bed.  Not having any AC was awful. I can't open my window, so the only air I got was from a tiny fan I usually keep in the bathroom and my shitty fan that blows air out of it's sides. The ceiling fan was on too, but I have to keep it on low or else it clicks all night. It took a long time before was comfortable enough to fall asleep and then after I fell asleep, I kept waking up, sweating. It really, really sucked.   I was up before 10am today. I won another auction last night while I "slept". This one was for 36 tapes and I got it fot $5. No shipping either, since they live here in Clearwater. I just have to go pick them up. I am also negotiating with a seller on his lot of 300+ tapes that ended without the reserve being met. He wants $75 plus shipping but I'm only willing to go $50  including  shipping since he didn't include a picture of the tapes (so I can guage what shape they're in). I may or may not get it. It's a killer lot too, some  great  titles, about 60 I really want. I don't think he'll do it for $50 though, unfortunately.  Oh yeah, the AC. Mike, a family friend who fixes AC's, had me try the air this morning and it's working again. It must've just frozen up yesterday. He's going to come by and put some freon in it later today. He's also going to bring his guitar with him (he just started learning how to play) so I can teach him some stuff.   Later on, I hope to get some auctions listed on eBay. With all the auctions I've been winning, I can definitely use the extra money. I've said that the last few weeks too, so... we shall see.

        The Weekend Is Finally Here... Eh.    It looks to be a crappy weekend for me this weekend. For starters, the AC broke. It isn't taking in any air and it isn't giving out any air. Just as it's getting hot out again too, dammit. I guess I'm sleeping in the living room tonight, with windows open.   If that wasn't sucky enough, both Mom and I are pretty much broke until next payday. We can't afford to do anything good... double dammit. It looks like it's going to be a hot, boring weekend. What a great combo.   On a positive note, I just won another eBay auction tonight, yet another lot of cassette tapes, 30 of them, for just $10.01 (includes shipping). I held on to $20 to play with this weekend, so I'm  almost  completely broke. Some of the better tapes in the lot are:  The Beatles "Revolver", Stone Temple Pilots "Tiny Music...Songs From the Vatican Gift Shop", Radiohead "OK Computer", Spin Doctors "Homebelly Groove", Oasis "(What's The Story) Morning Glory?", John Cougar Mellencamp "Uh-Huh", and others by Alice In Chains, Foo Fighters, Dave Matthews Band, Sade, etc...  Hopefully they'll be in better shape than some of the last ones I've gotten. They look newer, but that doesn't really mean anything.   I've never understood how or why people trash their CDs , LPs, and tapes. That's a real pet peeve with me. My stuff always looks as new as the day I bought it. Who wants to handle scratchy, beat-up looking crap, or wear shit out so you have to go and buy it again? I certainly don't, but I guess there are plenty of folks out there who don't mind it one bit. I have a cute, pet name for those people: dumb asses. Y'all suck! Man. I really hate it when I'm looking through the CD bin at the pawn shop or a used record store and find a cool title I like only to discover that the CD appears to have been dragged the road behind a pick-up truck or that the booklet appears to have been used as a dinner napkin. What's wrong with you people? Sheesh!

        Rocking Out   I'm sitting here at my desk again, semi-bored. I've done just about everything I had to do today already. I've also burned several copies of Dave Attell's CD and listened to three whole Led Zeppelin tapes (Jimmy Page's "Outrider" tape is playing as I type this). I'm waiting on JP right now, we're going to go out for lunch.    Last night's band practice went pretty well. I don't know what is is, but that little bitty nap beforehand really helped. I was so tired, I didn't want to get up, but I'm glad I did. We ran through both sets for our next gig and I even got to jam a little on one of mine at the beginning (to warm up). We don't practice again until the day of the gig (March 13th) though, so that kind of sucks. I think we'd all better practice our asses off at home or we're going to sound pretty rough.   Ok, I'm starting to get hungry now. I'm going to go look for JP.

        Like A Squirrel   Another crappy night of sleeping, but this time, it was because of my toothache. I woke up a few times really feeling it. It's not so much my tooth either, although the tooth caused the inflammation, it's the area under my cheekbone (above the gumline) that is causing me pain. When I got out of bed this morning (around 8:20am again) and looked in the mirror, I noticed that area of my cheek is swollen (hence the title of this entry). Very nice.  Work went well today; slow, boring, but well. I did everything I was able to do on my own, and then I waited on reports/paperwork from a couple people who never got the stuff to me. I wound up goofing off a large portion of the day. I ate lunch on the clock, listened to a bunch of tapes (Led Zeppelin, Van Halen, Steve Miller Band. R.E.M.), talked to my Mom, surfed the net, and burned several copies of Doyle Bramhall II's "Welcome" CD (an awesome album, by the way).   As it's plain to see, I really busted my ass today.    Now, I'm going to go lay down until dinnertime. I found that napping, or at least,  trying to nap , helps me out a lot at band practice, which I have tonight. We only have one more practice until our next gig... pretty scary considering how rough we sounded last week.

        Sleepy & Hurting   All that bitching about being bored at work (see below) and then I go and stay 1/2 hour extra. I started a project, a very boring project (xeroxing the little paper slips that go into the phones and then cutting them out), and lost track of time. Ugh!  After I got home, I watched my Mitch Hedberg DVD (that came with the CD) and eventually tried to take a nap on the couch (I just could not stay awake any longer). I only got to sleep about 1/2 an hour before Mom came home and I had to go out and bring the groceries in.   I'm hurting right now. I've had a toothache for about two days and it's causing pain in my jaw, cheekbone, ear and gums. The really fucked up thing is that there's not even a tooth there, just a a crown. It causes me a lot of pain a couple times a year. The dentist who put it in was a bit of a dipshit. The first crown he put in was too big and rocked when I closed my mouth. I eventually swallowed it while eating a pizza. Then he put this one in and the little metal post that holds it in place is sticking through the bottom of the crown. I hope I get some dental insurance in April when my (limited) benefits kicks in.   My knees and back are sore as hell too. I am old before my time.

        Bored Beyond Belief   I am sitting here at my desk counting the minutes until I can leave. I've been sitting here looking at stuff on eBay and FARK and eating my lunch, now I'm bored with that too. I've been waiting for some reports to come in so all morning so I'll have something more to do. They still haven't been sent yet and I've done everything else on my "to do" list already. I've also listened to 4 tapes (Paul Simon, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Robert Plant, and Dio), downloaded some music from Kazza, and surfed the net. I was expecting to be really busy today, maybe enough to merit staying later, but it's dead so I'm leaving at 3:15 today.   I didn't sleep enough last night either, dammit.  *yawn*  Okay, tape #5 is in the player (The Outfield) and I'm going to look for something,  anything , to do.   Well, almost anything.

        Tuesday   I slept wonderfully last night, woke up feeling well-rested and refreshed, and went on to have a great day.   Not.   I stayed up too late organizing my tapes and didn't get to bed until somewhere around 12:30am. Then, as usual, it took a really long time for me to fall asleep. I got out of bed this morning around 8:20am... I have to be at the bus stop by 8:40am. Ugh! Somehow, though, I made it to work and I put my 6 hours in.   It was an easy enough day, no major problems. Tomorrow looks to be a busy one though. I could've stayed later today, but there just wasn't enough for me to do. I didn't even punch out for lunch today (I ate at my desk while I worked).    When I got home, I played around on the PC and I watched some of my new "Monty Python & The Holy Grail" DVD, mostly listening to the audio commentary by Palin, Cleese, and Idle. Funny stuff!   I spent a few hours in my room tonight, after dinner, cleaning a bit, but also playing a bit too. I also broke out my guitar (the one I just got back from the shop) and tested it out.   It plays fine and all, but the tone of the low E string when I play it higher up is different, funky, and not in a good way. I also didn't like how low my high E string is near the nut. I like to have some string to press down on, some tension. All in all though, it's better than it was. I can even pull up on my tremelo again (the last person to set up my guitar made it so I couldn't do that). Hopefully it'll sound better through a good amp. It'll have to do anyhow. I can't buy a new guitar until after I buy a new amp, so I won't have a new guitar until May or June.   I watched my Triumph The Insult Comic Dog DVD tonight (the one that comes with the "Come Poop With Me" CD) and laughed my ass off. It's raunchy as hell, but it's so over-the-top that I still found it hilarious (Horatio Sanz doing an impression of LBJ was a highlight). Smigel is a genius.   It's late, so I guess I'm off to bed (after I take the trash out). Hopefully, I will sleep well tonight.

        Just Got Paid Today... Now I'm Broke   I slept ridiculously bad last night. I think I got maybe three hours of sleep in all, if that. If that wasn't bad enough, I ran late this morning and I missed my bus. Luckily, Mom stayed home today and drove me in. JP came in late himself, after 10am, so I doubt anyone would've said anything to me if I had just taken the next bus and showed up around 9:30am.   I got a lot done today, everything on my "to do" list plus more. It sounds like tomorrow may be extra busy though, lots of stuff I will have to deal with all at once, so I will probably stay late tomorrow night.   JP was busy today at work too, but more with band stuff it seemed. He talked to a lot of people about gigs, trying to line some more up for us, and he even talked with a professional booking agent. It sounded like she may be able to get us some very good gigs. Very cool.   As I mentioned in the title of this post, today was payday. I went without lunch today and had Mom pick me up around 3pm. We cashed my check, I gave her back a lot of the money I owed her, and then we ran some errands.   The first place we stopped at was Southern Pawn, the one I have been doing very well at lately with DVDs and video tapes. No luck with either today, but... I did very well with CDs instead. I bought 10 CDs there (1 was still sealed) and it cost me less than $18 ($1.65 each + tax). I got:  Iron Butterfly "Metamorphosis", Ozzy Osbourne "Blizzard Of Ozz" (remastered), Adam Sandler "Stan and Judy's Kid", Joe Satriani "Joe Satriani", "Engines Of Creation" & "Strange Beautiful Music" (sealed), Savoy Brown "Street Corner Talking", Cat Stevens "Tea For The Tillerman" & "Greatest Hits", Whitesnake "The Best Of Whitesnake -  The Millenium Collection".  What a deal! Of course, me being a dipshit, I left several behind that I should've bought. I could've sold them on eBay for several times what I would've paid for them. Grrrrr!!!!  After there, we stopped at a Walgreens where I bought another cassette strorage case. On the way home we hit another Walgreens and I bought 2 more there. I'm good on them now.   I picked my guitar up from Stevie B's tonight. From what I can tell, they did a great job setting my guitar up. I was leery of the low charge for doing it all, $35, but I'll be damned if it doesn't look like they did everything I asked them to do. Very cool. I'm not entirely sure if I'll buy my amp there or not, I can get one cheaper on eBay, but I will probably buy my next guitar there. They said they can beat anyone else's prices, but they also said "eBay doesn't count". Ha! If I can save $250 on my amp buying it on eBay, then eBay counts like a motherfucker.   After we left there, I stopped in at Circuit City to exchange the Satriani CD that was sealed for a new CD I'd rather have. They've always done it in the past with no hassle (it was part of their "no-hassle" return policy), but today: hassle. They wouldn't do it without a receipt, which, of course, I couldn't produce. Bastards. I was planning on buying some stuff while I was there, but I left without buying anything. Bastards.  It was definitely their loss though: I blew over $70 at Best Buy, where we headed to after the disappointing Circuit City excursion. I bought the new "Monty Python and The Holy Grail" Special Edition DVD as planned, but then I got to looking at CDs and wound up buying 3 CDs: The Beatles "Let It Be... Naked" (w/bonus disc), Mitch Hedberg  "Mitch All Together" (w/DVD), and Triumph The Insult Comic Dog "Come Poop With Me" (w/DVD). I definitely hadn't planned on spending so much, now I'm broke. Actually I have about $20 left, but that's supposed to last me until next payday, two weeks from today. Ugh.   I think I'd better list some cards and/or tapes for sale on eBay tomorrow. It would probably be a good idea to set up a booth at the flea market this weekend too. I need more money!

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  Tapes, at work, every day. This week I've listened to tapes by Billy Joel, Warren Zevon, The Doors, Bad Company, Jimi Hendrix, Black Sabbath, Billy Squier, Led Zeppelin, Lenny Kravitz, and maybe a few others. I've also listened to Al Franken's radio show almost every day this week.    Watching on TV:  Pretty much the same as last week. Sundays: "The Sopranos"; Mondays: "Fear Factor"; all week long: "The Simpsons", "Everybody Loves Raymond", "Seinfeld", and I also wathed episodes of "Friends", "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire", and "Match Game" this week. Aside from the movie I watched tonight ("How I Won The War"), that's about it.    Downloading:  Nothing.   Reading:  I'm still half-reading an SNL book in the bathroom.     Jamming:  I had band practice Thursday, and we have another practice next Thursday. We have a few potential gigs lined up that we're working on at the moment.     Working:  I worked a little over 39 hours this week. Feels more like 59.    Buying:  I haven't bought anything on eBay for a couple weeks (did I just say that?), I bought a few cassette tape storage cases (that I owe Mom for), but that's about it. If we go out tomorrow, I'm sure I'll spend some money and I plan on buying a bunch of CDs on Tuesday, when the new CD releases come out. I'm planning on buying the new Los Lobos ("The Ride") and the new Jimi Hendrix tribute album ("Power Of Soul").    Selling:  I sold a few more cards on eBay this week, just a few. I need to start filling up my eBay store again. I may do some listing this weekend.    Eating:  Today: McDonalds burger and fries, pizza. Yesterday: 2 candy bars, cheeseburger, fries. Too much crap food. No sodas still, but plenty of stuff that I don't need to be eating.    Feeling:  Mentally, I'm a little stressed out with work. It's not hard, but there are so many things I have yet to learn. I know so much less than the other support guys that I often feel like a caveman at a MENSA convention. I'm also not happy about a certain friendship that seems to have evaporated overnight.   Physically, I'm tired way too much and I have a sore toe. I'll survive.    Planning:  I need to practice on the guitar a lot more and I need to start putting lyrics and structures together and coming up with my own songs. I've got enough of them floating around in my mind and on tapes I made (I've got about forty or fifty 90-minute tapes filled with various riffs and ideas). It's about time I start getting my shit together, musically.

        Friday... At Long Last!   I went to bed too late last night (after Midnight), didn't sleep very well, stayed in bed too long, took too long in the bathroom this morning, and eventually missed my bus. I sat out at the bus stop for 20 minutes waiting for the next one (I couldn't go home and wait because I locked my keys in the house). I was 20 minutes late getting in. Not exactly the way I wanted to start my day.   Luckily, none of the bosses were in again today, so things were nowhere near as hectic as yesterday... well, at least not until about 4:30pm, when things started screwing up again.   In the meantime, I filled out and turned in my dental insurance application, so come Monday, I should have health, dental,  and  life insurance coverage... nice!  Lunch sucked today. The lady who has the restaurant downstairs was closed again, so I had JP pick me up some McDonalds (blech!) since he was stopping there. I really dislike McDonalds anymore, fast food in general.   Anyway, somewhere around 4:30pm, the sales floor lost their phone and computer connections, which sent everyone into a panic (rather than calmly reasoning out what the problem could be and trying to solve it).   There are a lot of folks there who run around like chickens with their heads cut off as soon as there's a problem.   It's a pain in the ass to deal with, but in reality, dealing with big problems like we've had to deal with the last two days is good for me because I'm learning things I normally wouldn't get to learn (when things are going well) about the equipment and about the people I work with.   That said, I was still glad as hell to get out of there today, I'd had enough "learning" for one week. I stayed until 5:45pm, so I did my time.   Soon after I got home, the pizza Mom had ordered arrived, so we chowed down and watched TV. Later on I sat on the couch and watched a movie, "How I Won The War", but I just don't get it. I tried watching it before with the same result, but this time I sat through the whole thing. One of the problems is that I miss a lot of the dialogue due to the British accents, which doesn't help any.   Right now, I'm getting ready for bed, I think. I'm really, really tired and I think it's going to rain, so it'd be a good time to hit the sack.   Mom and I are planning on hitting some Goodwill stores and maybe some yard sales tomorrow, but it's supposed to rain all weekend, so I guess we'll be playing it by ear.

        Thursday's Shits & Giggles   It's hard to believe, but I slept ok, got up on time, and was at work by 9am. Not too shabby, eh?   Even better, almost all of the executives were out today, no bosses, including my own (JP took the day off). Sweet!  For the most part, it was a nice, easy day. I even filled out my health insurance forms at work (I will have health insurance starting Monday, first time in about 5 years), but I still have my dental stuff to fill out (Mom looked through them tonight and told me which plan was better). A couple problems came up, but I took care of them. One of them, I even solved by trying something I wasn't even trained on (I got brave).  I stayed a little late, until 5:40pm, to make up for the time I lost yesterday, got home, called Billy (he's in town and said he might stop by band practice tonight), ate dinner, and then JP came by to pick me up for practice. Things started going south around then.   JP got a call from work, the phones were going crazy, they couldn't make long-distance calls and the voice mail system was sending people to random mailboxes. He had to go in, which meant I had to go in too... 10 minutes until band practice was to start. I had asked JP to drop me off there, so at least we could jam while he went in to work, but he didn't want to do that (that's why I went in with him).   I wasn't much help at work, I got the number for our long distance provider, emailed them, and that's about it. We were there for about 30-40 minutes and nothing was any better by the time we left.   On the plus side, I did get to hang out and talk a little with one of the "chicks" who works there (she's really nice and really cute). Even though I didn't get paid for going back in to work, that little bit of "quality time" was worth it to me. I invited her to come see my band play next time we have a gig.   Al and Jimmy had been waiting for us at the rehearsal studio the whole time. I could tell they weren't thrilled about having to just sit there for about 45 minutes. We had a loose practice, going over a lot of new covers: "Come On Let's Go", "No Particular Place To Go", "My Ding-A-Ling" (which included a JP solo!), and "The Breakup Song". We also played some newer songs ("Better", and that jam of mine that we ended our set with last weekend), and some older covers and whatnot ("Blister In The Sun", "The Curtain Falls", etc). JP didn't seem very into playing tonight, he walked off a couple times (dealing with the work situation, I think), so me Al and Jimmy played a little on our own, doing "Dear Mr. Fantasy" and playing a little on an old acoustic song of mine (a Jimmy Page-like one in G). Al seemed to like it a lot.   By the way, he hasn't bought tickets to Steve Winwood yet, but he's dying to go (like me). He said he'd get me a ticket if he decides to go. Sweet! I talked to my friend Rob this afternoon (for about 1/2 hour) and he got himself a free ticket, but couldn't get one for me, so hopefully Al will come through.   Oh! Jimmy said he got us a $300 gig at this one bar (he's friends with the owner) and he said we could play there anytime we wanted to, we could name the date and time! Cool! The only snag there is that we'd have to supply the P.A. system. JP has speakers and a 6 or 8 channel power head, but we don't have monitors, a mixing board, or anyone to run the mixing board while we play. We're looking at late May to play there, the sooner the better though.   Billy never showed up either. I didn't think he would, really, I certainly wasn't counting on it.   I guess I need to go to bed soon, it's going to be a hectic day tomorrow and I can't show up late; unlike today, all the bosses will be there tomorrow and they won't be in a very good mood).

        Wednesday Stuff   I was in bed by 9pm last night, and yet, I just couldn't get my ass moving this morning. I stayed in bed half-listening to the alarm/radio (a funny comedian, Larry Reeb, was a guest on Bob & Tom) and drifting in and out of sleep. I have no idea how much I actually slept during the night, but it probably wasn't a whole lot judging by the way my bedsheets were all twisted and contorted.   I wound up being an hour late for work. I called JP to see if he could swing by to get me, but he was already close to work. He wasn't pissed or anything though, so that's cool.  Befiore I left, I noticed that Mom had picked me up some cassette storage cases last night, five of them. Cool! Walgreens has them on sale this week, for $3 less than I usually pay for them. Now I just need some more space to store my storage cases... d'oh!  I'd left that giant query running yesterday and sometime during the night it finished running, so that's cool (it means the program works). I ran another big one again around 1pm and learned that it takes 3 hours and 20 minutes to run. This means, ideally, that I can run queries for three days worth of dials during one shift. It also means that, with 20 months worth of queries to go through, this report is going to take me a hell of a long time to finish, a few months worth of work.   With all of the job insecurity around here, I guess that's a good thing.   Oh, JP and I ate lunch out today. We went to the China Family buffet again and chowed down. I am still stuffed.   Right now, I am listening to The Cars "Panorama" tape and counting down the minutes until I can leave (6:15pm).

        Monday/Tuesday   Man, these last two days have been absolutely boring. I feel like I'm sleepwalking through them. Part of the problem is that I've been sleeping badly at night still, so when I wake up, I wake up tired. Then, I go to work and sit in one spot almost all day, which doesn't help wake me up any.   Today was particularly boring at work since I had to keep waiting for a troublesome program to run. I waited an hour, it didn't finish, so I ended it, did some other work I had to do, then started it again and let it run another hour or so. JP came in and looked at it, had me end it and run a smaller one to see if that worked, it did, so I ran the big one again. Two hours later, it was still running. I left work at 5:10pm and it was still running, so hopefully it'll finish tonight. This is a query for a report I'm doing, covering just one day. I have to go back and run the queries for everyday from November 2001 to June 2003. At this rate, it'll take months to finish what I have to do.   *sigh*  Yesterday I was in bed by 10pm, tonight, I may be in bed even earlier. I have a few things to do tonight though (laundry, packaging cards). We'll see...

        Sunday Runnin'   I got to bed late again, slept badly, and once again, I got up early... go figure. I started to watch "Hamlet" again (the Olivier version), but then Mom came home and we decided to go out.   She was hungry, so we hit Longhorn again and chowed down there. We both tried the Pork Ribeye this time (it was pretty good) and I also had a caesar salad and a side of chili (very good). We were talking about trying a dessert, but there was no room for any.   From there we rode to Sound Exchange and I bought a few CDs,  2 Rodney Dangerfield CDs ("No Respect" and "I Don't Get No Respect") and a Jimi Hendrix CD ("Live At Winterland", a BMG record club version, still sealed). I wanted to order some CDs that I'd been looking for, but the guy at the counter wasn't very helpful. He got his info from allmusic.com, a site I visit regularly, and a site which also features a link to Barnes & Noble, where I can just order the CDs from myself... no need for Sound Exchange at all. Dumbass.  From there we went to Specs and I bought a few more CDs (Albert King "Born Under A Bad Sign", Rodney Dangerfield "What's In A Name?", and Saga "Worlds Apart") and a Hendrix DVD ("The Making Of Electric Ladyland") which was on sale for just $7.99! Wow! Mom pointed it out to me. Good thing she was there or I'd have missed it.   On the way home we stopped at Dunkin' Donuts for Cooladas and of course, the machine was down again. We went to a different one and had better luck there.   So... that's about it for the money I made from the gig last night, it didn't last long.  The rest of the night I unwrapped and listened to CDs in my room (nd noticing that the covers of all three CDs I bought at Sound Exchange are a bit fucked up: some bent, some creased) and worked on cleaning up the tape situation in my room (I have tapes everywhere). Still haven't folded any clothes yet...   Uh oh, gotta go, "The Sopranos" is coming on!

        Gig Night   I stayed up until 4am last night (Friday night), went to bed, and slept horribly. I was up around 11am, stayed up for a while, ate lunch, got my equipment ready for the gig, played a little bit, and then sometime around 1:30pm, I went back to bed. I stayed down until 5:30pm, but I'd slept very little again. I got up, played my acoustic guitar a little (I'd picked it up repeatedly all night and day while in bed, even started a new song). I showered, ate, changed clothes got my equipment out to the car, and around 7:35pm, we (Mom and I) headed to the club.  We were the first ones there, Jimmy and Al arrived shortly after, then we started moving our gear in. It was really nice not having any pressure to set-up quickly. We did a sound check and even got to play through one song ("Promise You The Moon").   My sister and niece showed up before the first set, as did my friend, Rob. He invited a neighbor of his, Patty, and she showed up later in the night (during the second set), which was cool. Overall though, we got nowhere near the crowd we usually pull in. With us being the only band to playing, it was pretty disappointing. We only had maybe 25-30 people show up (we usually bring in around 50) and several of those were Moms and Dads who got in for free. I'm thankful for the ones who did show up though, their presence meant a lot. It wasn't a full house by any means, but it was a friendly crowd.   We were waiting for people to show up, so our first set got pushed back to 9:30pm. Only a few more showed, but we went on anyway. I could tell it was going to be a long night.    Here was our first set:  "Sunshine Of Your Love" (turned out ok), "Steal My Kisses" (turned out well), "Promise You The Moon" (an original... turned out ok), "The Difference" (turned out well), "I Got Loaded" (we had a problem... JP launched started the last verse in the middle of my solo... a miscommunication), "Something More" (an original... turned out well), "Fell In Love With A Girl" (turned out ok), "Yesterday's Girl" (on original... turned out well), "The Middle" (turned out well, I think... we started having sound problems with the monitors around here, so it was hard to tell), "Love The One You're With" (same thing), "Tore Down" (not too good, I tripped over some of my lines), "Had A Girl" (went over well, I think, but I could barely hear Al), and "Rockin' In The Free World" (we played it ok, but it didn't seem to go over great... by then, everything seemed extremely loud onstage).   We took a 15 minute break and I went over and sat with my sister, niece, mother, and my friend, Rob. I talked with JP's mom and dad a while too, and drank a whole bunch of water.   I drank water all night long, except for a coke I had before the first set. It was so freaking hot up there it was insane, just wicked humid. I was sweating my ass off up there, I'll tell ya. I felt like I got a real work-out.   While I was sitting there, I told my sister she should order Mom a Margarita (she always talks about ordering one when we go out to eat but never does) and she did! Mom took one sip and started turning red! She nursed that drink all night long, in fact, I don't think she ever finished it. I tried a sip myself (I'd never had one before) but I just could not stand the salt around the edge... ick!  Here was our second set: "What's So Funny About Peace, Love & Understanding" (turned out real well... the sound was much better), "There For Me" (an original... turned out well), "American Girl" (turned out real well), "Stuck In The Middle" turned out real well), "Before You Accuse Me" (turned out ok... I fumbled some leads again), "Opportunity Knocks" (an original... turned out ok), "Wild Night" (turned out well), "Sleeping Forever" (an original... turned out well), "Go Your Own Way" (I started out on the wrong chord again, like I did at practice...ugh! otherwise, it went ok), "You May be Right" (the sound started going crazy here, the rhythm guitar disappered from the monitor's mix, so I was trying to comp a rhythm guitar that wasn't there... I have no idea how this one went as it was such a struggle to play), "Rock This Town" (much sloppier than usual, went over ok though), "You Can't Run" (an original... turned out well), "Hangin' By A Moment" (turned out ok), "Better" (a new original, first time played out, a bit rough still, but it got a decent reception), "I Wanna Be Sedated" (turned out ok, but there was a problem with the breakdown part), and "Desire" (ugh. JP hit some bad notes and my channel switching pedal started feeding back for some reason... it had been a pretty strong set up until then).  I planned this set to be our most upbeat set, to get people on the floor dancing, and that worked out just as I'd thought. I planned this set to be a bit longer than the others because I figured most people would split after the second set and sure enough, they did. I knew our crowd wasn't a "late-night" bunch. They are primarily people with day jobs and families, so I knew they'd wouldn't stay for the whole show. Before we got onstage for the last set of the night, there were only about 15 people around the bar and two or three in the seats.   My sister and niece were among those who split after the second set. My Mom sat outside while I was out front talking with Rob, but then she wound up staying out there the rest of the night. I'm not sure why. Rob stayed the whole time though, as did his neighbor, so that was cool.   By the third set, all of the band guys were pretty much wiped out. Between the heat, the sound problems, and the late hour, we were beat. It was in this atmosphere that we kicked off the last set:  "Cold Shot" (went well), "Feelin Alright" (sound problems a plenty... all I could hear through the monitor was my guitar, so I kept turning down and it didn't help... I have no idea how this sounded to the audience... very frustrating), "Crazy Little Thing Called Love" (sloppy, but it was ok), "All For You" (a quieter song, went over ok, but my solo sucked ass), "The Way" (same thing: my solo sucked ass... probably because I'd turned down so much that I lost gain and it hurt my playing), "Circle" (turned out ok), and "Old Apartment" (turned out ok).   JP ended the set there (we'd skipped over 6 songs), I guess he had a bad headache and was done. As he was saying goodbye, we got several people pleading with us (literally) to play more. I launched into "The Authority Song" and that went ok, but JP was done after that and left the stage. I kicked into one of my jams and the band tore into it. We sounded alright, even though I was pulling most of it out of my ass, we were all just winging it. A lot of people dug the hell out of it though, which was very nice to hear. Whew! And so, the gig was over.   I talked to some of the people who stuck around to hear us (Rob, Patty, Josh from work, and some new people), and had my first and only beer of the night: a nice cold Heineken. Al said he'd give me a lift home, so Mom finally split. She said she could hear us outside. Maybe we were too loud for her, I don't know. Eventually, we got paid ($75 each, we didn't make our bonus) and we just hung out, chillin', for a while.   It was a long, sweaty night and I am beat.   Bedtime.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  I had Fleetwood Mac's self-titled CD on at home a couple times and I listened to most of the new Clapton CD ("Me And Mr. Johnson") at work (JP brought in his copy). Mostly, I've just been jamming out to tapes at my desk though: Warren Zevon, Black Sabbath, AC/DC, The Who, The Doors, etc... I brought in about 20 new tapes from home (from that huge lot I just got) and swapped them out with less-rocking tapes I already had there. I have a shitload of Sabbath and Zeppelin there now and I'm loving it! I'm still enjoying Al Franken's (streaming) radio show as well (I try to catch it every work day, Noon-3pm).    Watching on TV:  Sundays: "The Sopranos"; Mondays: "Fear Factor"; all week long: "The Simpsons", "Everybody Loves Raymond", "Seinfeld", and when I can catch it, "The Dave Chapelle Show". I went to bed early almost every night this week, so I wasn't watching much TV.    Downloading:  Nothing.   Reading:  Almost nothing (I've been half-reading an SNL book in the bathroom).     Jamming:  I had band practice Thursday, but unfortunately, it was all business (rehearsing for tomorrow's gig). We play 3 sets tomorrow night, our longest gig yet, from 9-12:30am. We don't quite have everything together, so it may be a rough one.   Oh, I tried out my new wah at practice and the sweep is incredible, great sounding wah (even has some boost to it), but it's a bit too wild for me right now. I'll probably just use my old one until I get a better handle on the new one.    Working:  I worked about 39 hours this week. I started at 9:30am all week, but JP wants me to go back to 9am starts, godammit, for no good reason at all. he said he doesn't want any trouble with his boss, but the time I start has no bearing on anything except how late I leave. In reality, the later I'm there, the better it is for the people I'm supposed to be supporting, so whatever. There's all kinds of weasel behavior going on there. I need to just do my job, collect my pay, and forget about the rest of it (eerily reminiscent of how I felt near the end of my run at my last full-time job).    Buying:  I bought some index cards, an index card holder, some printer ink, and a video ("A Fish Called Wanda") at Office Depot tonight. I knew it beforehand, but they have a special deal going on right now: if you bring in an empty ink cartridge, they give you a ream of paper for free. Of course, being a dumbass and all, I forgot to bring in my empty. Mom will probably do that tomorrow.    Selling:  I actually sold about 13-14 cards this week, stuff from my eBay store that I listed last year. Totally unexpected. I really need to start stocking that bitch up.    Eating:  Today I went out to lunch with JP and I used my Chili's gift card. I had a steak fajita, which I've never had before, but I wasn't very impressed with it. I liked the southwestern eggrolls (that I had as an appetizer) much, much better. Tonight, I had pork chops and green beans (with bacon and onion) for dinner. No sodas still. That'll probably change tomorrow; I have a feeling I'll be needing some Mountain Dew (high in caffeine). I didn't eat burgers as much this week, but I had french dips instead, which also come with fries, so it wasn't much better for me. Lunches are my bad spot still. I need to find a lunch I can take to work that's good for me *and* that requires no cooking or preparation. Good luck, huh?    Feeling:  Mentally, a bit frustrated. Part of the problem is my job. I'm glad to have it, but some things aren't going as well as I'd hoped. JP wants me full-time, his boss thinks my position is unnecessary because businesss ran the same after my predecessor left, so I'm in a rock and a hard place. I definitely do not feel I have any kind of job security, especially since JP isn't training me the way I thought he would. He learned everything on his own, so I think he wants me to do the same, but he doesn't take into account that he had several years of schooling on computers. I don't have any such advatage. Also, I thought I'd get a raise when I finally got the full-time position (to make-up for the money I'd lose when I start paying for benefits), but that ain't going to happen. I'm actually going to bring home less money now that I'm a full-time employee, which is killing me financially. I just got in my emergency room bill ($756.00), I have a bank loan to pay back (over $1,000.00 due), and I just layed away a guitar (I have $668.00 left to pay), so this is a very bad time to be bringing home less money.    I'm also a bit frustrated with the band situation. We're still not doing any of my music, and when I throw some material out there at practice, it gets jammed on and then we move on. We never stop to work on any of it. We also don't do any Hendrix songs yet, which is bothersome to me. I'm also bothered by the fact that the other guys are considering taking some upcoming gigs where we'd play nothing but covers. I'm not playing for the money, I'm playing to get  our  music out there and heard, so it seems like a step backwards to me. One other thing is troubling me as well: our rhythm section, primarily the drumming. Jimmy's just not latching on, rhythmically, to a lot of what I'm throwing out there. Tough situation.  Physically, I'm struggling with "the Big D" at the moment and hoping it's gone by showtime tomorrow night. The backs been ok, but I hadn't been sleeping well all week. Last night was an improvement though.     Planning:  Too much. I'm a bit overwhelmed at the moment, to be honest. I need to focus on the gig tomorrow night, first and foremost, but I've got so many other things going on, so many distractions... ugh!

        Tired & Hassled   I went to bed early last night, around 9:30pm, but I still got very little sleep. I tossed and turned all night long again, but did wind up getting at least a couple hours of sleep, which is more than I've gotten all week.   I felt bad for Stevie, the cat that likes to sleep in my bed. Just about everytime he got settled down, I'd start tossing and turning and he'd have to re-adjust to me. This went on for hours. I also had to keep knocking him off me every time he tried to sleep on me. He doesn't weigh much, but it was enough to bother my lower back.   I was going to go in on time today, but that didn't work out very well. I wound up taking the late bus again, getting in at 9:30am.   From there on, until the time I left, it was a problem fest. Problems with reports, problems with phone codes, problems with phone lines, problems with my full-time status, computer problems, CD burner problems, problems, problems, problems. Ugh! Today was a real pain-in-the-ass.   JP went to the boss to get the ok for me to go full-time and it didn't quite go how either of us expected. He gave the ok, but he also jumped on JP for having me working full time already without his permisson. The boss man wants me to work between 32-40 hours per week with *no overtime*. Oops. I had about 15 minutes worth last pay and I'm in danger of having an hour or so of OT next pay. I'm now eligible for benefits, but I don't think I'll take any except for the health insurance, maybe the dental too. It doesn't make any sense joining a 401K plan if they're going to lay me off me go in December (every year, they lay the person in my position off from December until January), and right now, I don't see any thing that tells me they're not going to do it (that's why I need to start saving money as soon as I can).  Anyhoo... enough of that crap.   JP talked to the booker for the club we're playing on Saturday night and he wasn't able to find another band to play after us, so, we're doing three 3-hour sets, from 9:00pm to 12:30am. I'm not thrilled about that. I don't think we have enough material to do it. We'll have to stretch songs out or else try and fake our way through songs we haven't played in ages. It could get ugly. We still need to come up with a set list too, three of 'em.   The pressure is on...

        The Sleeplessness Continues   I went to bed around 10:30pm last night, hoping to get a decent night's sleep. I barely slept the night before, so it looked very promising. If you know me, you know where this is going already.   After a long time laying there without sleep, time spent tossing and turning from one side to the other, going from one pillow to another, I gave in and looked at the clock. It read "1:59am". That's right, three and a half hours in bed and not a wink of sleep. It didn't get much better after that. I was up around 6:30am to take a leak, and at that point, I had only slept a little bit... maybe an hour? By the time I was supposed to get up, I couldn't. I laid in bed until I had almost no time to get ready for work.   I made it to work on the late bus, looking like Hell and feeling like shit, trudged into my office, and got started on my daily work. After I finished the majority of that, I started on the project JP gave me yesterday. I had to go back over phone records from last June until now and track how mant times every state had been called. After a few hours of doing that crap, I had some inspiration. The records I was going through are handled by a company we still deal with and so I called JP to ask him if he had asked them if they had a similar report already on hand. He hadn't, so I called them up and they said they could send me the report. I hope to see  it tomorrow, and if it's done in an accessable way, it will have saved me more than a week's worth of work.   That was good news, and as usual, it was quickly followed up with some bad news: I still had to track all the calls made from late 2001 until mid 2003 that came from another company they'd used. The files were on discs, zipped up, so I had to copy them into a file and unzip them, then I was supposed to get them ready to go into a datbase. Well, not knowing how large these zip files were, I used up all of the disc space on my hard drive and so I had to copy them over to another drive, one with ample space. Of course, in my tired state of mind, I didn't realize that that the files would take up all of the space on that drive as well. Finally, I tried to delete the files from one of the drives (my PC was running extremely slow) and I wound up deleting everything. At least five hours worth of work...gone.  Oh, I talked to our HR person and with JP and he's supposed to ask his boss to ok me for "full time" so I can start getting benefits finally. I'd been working full time hours for quite a while now, so it's about time.   I stayed until 5:45pm today, bussed it on home and found a package waiting for me on the steps. It was my Teese Real McCoy (RMC-1) wah pedal. It looked to be like new, hopefully it plays that way as well.   After dinner, another package I'd been waiting on arrived as well, the 268 tape lot with the 3 wooden storage racks. It was packed extremely well. The tapes look used, but in pretty decent shape... a lot of newer ones in clear shells. I need to order some more cases for them though, they're filthy and many are cracked and broken. There's a lot of stuff in there I can sell pretty easily too, death metal stuff that I wouldn't listen to, so that's really cool. Not a bad buy!  Well... I took the trash out already, I'm about done blogging for the night, so I am taking my ass to bed. It's not even 8:30pm yet, but what the hell, I'm wiped out.

        Dead Man Waking   I think I slept maybe an hour last night... maybe. My sinuses got bad, my room was too warm, and after I realized how late it had gotten and I still hadn't slept, I kept thinking about that. Ugh!   To matters worse, when I got up this morning, my back was aching again. This time it was the left side of my lower back, it felt like it was going to give out on me. I would've called in sick for any other job (or on any other boss), but I just couldn't do it. I've already missed five days in the three months I've been here, I don't need to miss more.  On the way in to work, I ran into Santana. His band played Sunday, at the same place we played on Saturday, same contest too. He said his band "took it". I thought that meant they won, but he said they didn't stay for the judging, so I don't know what he meant. He also said they played for an hour, which both JP and I found pretty hard to believe. The lady that ran the contest was pretty adamant about the amount of time each band was allotted (half an hour, maybe a couple minutes over, but no more than 35 minutes or they'd pull the plug on you and you'd be out of the contest), so I don't know what to believe.   Oh yeah, some good news: JP called last night and it looks like our band will have a place to practice... for FREE! His brother-in-law has a club that is no longer in use and he said we could play there. It's air-conditioned, has a stage, and we can leave our equipment there if we want (JP will have a key). Sweet!

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  I listened to some of the Fleetwood Mac CD I bought recently, but mainly I've been listening to tapes (primarily at work). I've listened to tapes by the Steve Miller Band, ZZ Top, The Presidents Of The United States, Men At Work, and others. I also caught the O'Franken Factor" several times this week.    Watching on TV:  This week I watched some shows I normally don't watch: "The Howard Stern Show", "The Osbournes", and "The King Of Queens", plus I watched my usual TV fare: "The Simpsons", "Everybody Loves Raymond", "Seinfeld", "The Sopranos", "Fear Factor", and a lot of CNN.   Downloading:  Nothing.   Reading:  I'm not really reading anything at the moment.    Jamming:  We practiced last Friday and played a gig on Saturday. We will practice next Thursday and we have another gig next Saturday. Sweet!   Working:  I worked about 40 hours last week, give or take a half hour.    Buying:  I bought some stuff at thrift sores and a yard sale today (see post below). Other than a couple of dinners, that's about it.    Selling:  I sold three cards today for $5.50. I'm lazy, I really need to load up up my eBay store. I could have money coming in daily if I did it right.    Eating:  Burgers and fries, subs, pizza, Cooladas, Samoas, lunchables... too much crap. We've been eating out a lot more often too, going for steaks, mexican food, etc.. Not exactly the kinds of foods I should be eating. I need to start drinking more water again too.    Feeling:  Mentally, I'm doing ok. Maybe a little anxious about the future: next Saturday's gig, the hospital bill that's due in, a couple of eBay auctions I won that haven't arrived yet, but otherwise, I'm ok.   Physically, my back problems have gotten much better. I haven't had to take my medicine as much and that's made me less groggy, less sleepy, so that's good. I'm still very unhappy with my weight problem, but that's not going to go away anytime soon.    Planning:  I need to get my ass in gear and start practicing at home a lot more. I need to get myself familiarized with all of our covers and originals again, and I have to do that within the week (because we may do a 3-hour set next Saturday). Ugh!

        My Sunday Crime/Shopping Spree   I slept ok last night, woke up tired still though. The good news: my back felt alright. I thought it'd be bad again, after all of the activity and heavy lifting last night, but it wasn't bad. I took my pills and after a bit, it didn't bother me at all. When Mom came home, sometime around Noon, I suggested going out and she was agreeable to that.   The first place we stopped was  a well known thrift store  and I bought three tapes there (Jackson Browne, Sheryl Crow, and Journey) for $0.50 each. The tapes are supposed to be marked at $0.50 each, that's how much all of their other stores charge and that's how much this one usually charges, but some moron/s in the back recently started putting various prices on them, seemingly at random too, because it made no sense how they were priced. Two of the tapes I had in hand were priced at a buck each, which is more than I would be willing to pay since, quite often, the tapes I buy there don't work when I get them home and try to play them. The last time I was there, I asked the lady at the checkout about the pricing and she said they should all be marked at $0.50 each, so... I asked one of the ladies in the store today (a different lady) and she said "I don't know... I guess they cost whatever they're marked". Grrrr!!!! Normally, I would have just put the tapes back and passed on them altogether, but for some reason, I took the tapes back over to the area where the tapes are (spread out all over several bins mixed in with other junk) and I switched cases so that all three of the tapes had a $0.50 tag on them. I know... it was a petty, lame-ass thing to do, but I was annoyed at the stupid way they do things there and the unwillingness of the lady I'd asked to find out for sure how much they cost, since she obviously wasn't sure. It wasn't the $1 I saved that motivated me, it was the principle of the matter. Nonetheless, I suppose I'm a criminal now, since , technically, it was stealing.   On the way out, I saw someone who looked like a manager there, and she seemed to be following me out, but after I got outside, I didn't see her again. Maybe it was my imagination, I don't know, but I won't be doing that again. It was very unlike me to do that in the first place.   After we left there, we were trying to decide where to go for lunch. I was jonesing for some sweet iced tea, so we wound up over at the Lone Star Steakhouse. I had some jalapeno poppers, some chili, and a Texas Ribeye (with rice). It was a very good meal, except I had to send my steak back to be cooked a little more, which was annoying. Since I got paid this week, I treated ($46 altogether).   After we ate, we went to a couple of yard sales (I spent a dollar and bought a stupid romance book for my sister and a bag of glow-in-the-dark stars) and then went to another of those  well known thrift stores .  There, I bought a badminton racket for $1 (a nice one made by Spalding), 4 tapes that cost  $0.50 each  (Tower Of Power, Men At Work, Billy Squier, and the Smithereens), and a large softcover Steven King book, "Wizard And Glass" (the fourth Dark Tower novel), for just $0.75. Mom bought a baseball glove (a Wilson) and a "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire" PC game for my niece and nephews (they were $2 each).   From there, we headed home, stopping off at Dunkin' Donuts on the way, where I finally got me a Strawberry Coolada. For those of you keeping score at home, that's 4 visits, 1 Coolada.

        Friday/Saturday   I went to work on the bus on Friday, caught the later one, and got in around 9:20am. I had all of my work done by about 3pm and that's with a very long lunch (about an hour and 20 minutes... me and JP went over to the chinese buffet). The rest of the afternoon, I sat in JP's office while he edited video from his family reunion. Not exactly a rough day at work.   We had band pratice after work so we left together, came here, hung out a little, then we packed up our equipment and headed to practice.  Practice was pretty rough, for me anyhow. I was still groggy from my medication so I wasn't playing up to par. Plus, hauling equipment back and forth didn't help my back any. When I left there, I was pretty nervous about the Saturday night gig.   I made myself stay up later on Friday, til about 1am. I watched two episodes of "The Howard Stern Show" (he had Uma Thurman on and was trying to impress her with his awards, books, etc... he even brought in a little kid to thank him for helping him with his cancer...nice!) and then I watched two episodes of "The Osbournes".   I woke up around 9am on Saturday, not feeling very refreshed or energetic. This didn't make me feel any better about the gig. I ate breakfast and then, sometime around Noon, Mom and I headed out to a yard sale here in the park. The lady had a ton of Stephen King hardcovers for just $1 each, but they looked pretty "grody" (there's a word I haven't used in ages) and I passed on them.   We went over to Sam Ash next. I wanted to make sure exactly which guitar I had layed away last week (I wasn't thinking very straight because of the back pain). Dan, the guitar guy there, went back and pulled the guitar for me so I could look it over. I was happy with it. It's a sunburst, like I thought, but it was the new style with the new style Fender bridge and the rolled fretboard and everything. It looked nice. In fact, it had never been out of the box until then. Nice case too. I have about $688 left to pay on it and then it's mine all mine! Sweet!  We were going to hit some yard sales after that, but my back started feeling sore again, so I cut the trip short. I didn't take any medicine all day becasue I didn't want to be groggy for the gig, so I had to deal with the strain the best I could.   We went on home and I took a nap for two hours. Well, I  tried  to take a nap. Stevie came in and jumped on me and after I finally got him to sleep down by my feet, I couldn't get comfortable because I didn't want to roll over on him. I should've just booted him out, but alas, I did not.   After I got up, I showered, got dressed and then worked on my tone a bit. I decided not to use my Captain Coconut pedal at the gig, going with my amp's distortion instead (it came with a footswitch). Instead of the Coconut's Univibe sound, I used my MXR Phaser. I was pretty cool with the sound I got and I wrote down the amp settings and all. I still think I can get a better tone out of my gear. I need to work on that.   JP arrived around 5:15pm to pick me up. He loaded my gear up while I finished getting ready to go, which was really nice of him to do, and then we headed out to the club.  It was pretty disorganized there, no one knew anything, and the person in charge hadn't arrived yet. Me and JP got there first, followed shortly after by Al, and later by Jimmy.   Eventually, the lady that ran the show finally got there and she took everyone outside to lecture us about what to do, what not to do, etc... She tallied up how many tickets were sold and then came back with the roster. We thought we did pretty good with about 22 tickets sold, but most of the other bands sold more. We wound up going on 2nd, the 7:45pm slot. We knew then that we had no chance of winning the contest and I think that may have helped us (it took the pressure off).       Al and I went to the sports bar next door and grabbed some burgers. Al insisted on paying for both meals, which was very nice of him, so I left the tip. JP's dad came by and said "hello" while we were eating.   After that, we went out back to load the equipment in as soon as the first band finished, but JP had already brought my stuff in with his. I couldn't believe how much he was helping me out (because of my back). Very cool.   After the first band finished (some industrial duo with a rhythm machine), it was a rush job to get on stage and get set up. We got set up pretty quickly though, we even had 4 minutes leftover.   I kicked the set off with "Love The One You're With" (which went really well), then we launched into "Stuck In The Middle" (another one that went very well), then "Opportunity Knocks" (an original... went fairly well), then "The Old Apartment" (went fairly well), then "You Can't Run" (an original... went really well), then "Sleeping Forever" (another original... went really well), then "Circle" (another original... had some trouble here), and then, finally, "Desire" (which went really well). Short but sweet.   The stage there was really nice, high off the ground, and the sound system was really good too (though I thought my volume was a bit low). As soon as we finished, we had to rush everything off the stage, no time to soak in the applause or anything. The sound guy said we played well and the band that followed us said the same thing.  I played pretty well for the most part. I had trouble on "Circle" though. I played the wrong chords two or three times (I tried playing the chorus a little differently and I kept forgetting which chord I was on... ugh).   Afterward, we talked to the lady in charge (after we loaded everything back into JP's car... Al carried my amp halfway, very cool of him to do) and she said she wanted us to make a demo CD for some label she's affiliated with (Koala?). Her and the sound guy both recommended us for another gig, but I forget the name. It's in St. Pete, near the beach (I think). Al said the place is always packed on the weekend, even without our crowd showing up it'd be a full house. The only thing about that one though is we'll have to do a lot more covers, which, in my mind, is a step backwards. There's another gig we were offered last week, a Sunday afternoon deal out on the beach, but again, cover-heavy. The other guys are for it, I'm not.  After the last band finished, they did the voting. It went about how I thought: the first band on got the least cheers, the last band on got the most, winning the "Battle Of The Bands". I went backstage and congratulated two of the guys from the band that won (kind of a heavy ska band with a trumpet player... they were really good).   JP, Al, Mike (JP's friend), two of Mike's friends, and I stood outside talking for a bit (Jimmy had left before the voting). Al took off and shortly after, then the rest of us hit the road too.   JP and I stopped off at a Dunkin' Donuts on the way home. I was hoping to get a Strawberry Coolada but they ran out of the strawberry mix. That makes three Dunkin' Donuts I've hit in the last week that were unable to serve me my damn Strawberry Coolada. How pathetic. So... I got nothing there, even though I was dying of thirst.   I got home sometime around 11:20pm. We brought my equipment in (JP carried my amp in, which was cool of him to do again), talked for a few mintues, and then JP hit the road.   Since then, I've been typing this out and half-watching TV (SNL, Comedy Central). It's been a long day. I think it's going to be a long week too. We may have to play a three-hour set next weekend at our usual monthly gig. The other band cancelled and if they can't find another band to go on after us, we'll play for three hours. We don't have much more than that in our repertoire, and we haven't played many of those songs for months. We'll all have to practice like hell at home all week long. We could always do some extended jamming too, but I don't know how well that would go over. It'll be mostly our crowd, family and friends, so it should be a low-pressure fun gig.

        Almost Over   I went to bed early again last night, just after 8pm. I didn't sleep very well though, I awake off and on all night, and I got out of bed late because of that. Mom was taking me in again, which was probably a god thing too because I would have overslept. I only had a little bit of time to get ready, but I made it in to work about 10 minutes early.   I thought I had about two hours extra this week (because I'd been coming in early and leaving late all week), but the payroll lady said I only had about 45 minutes. I don't know how she got that number, but I'll bet I will wind up with an hour of OT somewhere down the line (OT which they will no doubt bitch at me for having).  I was pretty groggy all day today, probably from the medicine I've been taking. JP brought me in the rest of his, so now I may not have to go to the doctor's after all. He also brought in his Danelectro Daddy-O distortion pedal for me. He wants to sell it and I told him I'd like to check it out.   I got most of my work done today, all of the important stuff anyway. There are some reports I was waiting most of the day for that didn't arrive until close to quittin' time, another never showed up at all.   I was going to go to the bank today (today was payday), that's why I chose to leave early today, but I never made it there. I stood there waiting for the west-bound bus for about 15-20 minutes, so I figured it must have come early and I missed it. I crossed the road to take the east-bound bus home, but as is my luck, I was stood there for no more than a minute when I saw the west-bound bus pass by. D'oh!  I got home and shortly after, ordered a pizza for dinner. I need to get back on track with my eating habits. I was doing good for a long while.   I'm glad this week is almost over. I'm just as glad that my back pain is going away. It's been a rough week for me.

        Early To Bed, Early To Rise...   Tuesday was am lot like Monday, just shorter. My back still hurt, I took pills, Mom drove me back and forth from work, I took more pills, and I nearly fell asleep at my desk. However, instead of going out for mexican food (like we did on Monday), we ordered in from Bradford Pub. I had 2 Reuben sandwiches (they're small) and Mom had wings.   As soon as I got home from work, I took a nap until the food arrived. Shortly after dinner, I went to bed for the night. That was sometime around 7:15pm. Very, very early.  I got up around 3:30am to take pills again, but then went right back to bed. I really didn't sleep too well.   Mom woke me up this morning (I had been sleeping through my alarm) and said she'd take me in to work again. I got up got dressed, found my long lost keys (in a pair of pants in my laundry basket), grabbed my drinks and food, and we left for work.   My back is still bothering me. It's especially bad when I stand. This has me worried because I have a gig in 3 days ansd I will have to stand for at least a half an hour. Plus, I will have to lug around equipment on Friday (the night we practice) and Saturday (gig night). I'm not looking forward to that. Hopefully my back will be better by then, but if not, I'm going to be in a world of pain all over again. Oh, and I only have enough Vicodin for today and tomorrow. I may have to go see my regular doctor in a day or two. More guitar money down the drain. Grrrr!!!  I stopped downstairs for a large cappucino and ate half of my Publix sub for breakfast while I worked. And so the day begins...

        Sleepy Monday   I knew, since I slept almost all day Sunday, that I was going to have a problem getting to sleep at night. Sure enough, I did. I neglected to turn the air on before I went to bed, figuring it would be cool enough with the rain and all, but I wound up sweating my ass off. I got up around 3am to turn the AC back on. While I was up, I also took some some pills. I slept off and on throughout the night, never steady.   Mom woke me up around 7:45am and told me she'd take me to work if I was ready by 8:30am. It was raining outside still and I didn't feel like sitting in the rain if I didn't have to, so I got up, got ready, and was out the door by 8:30.   It was a slow, boring day at work today. I received only one phone call all day, had just one email that had to be answered, and didn't have a single person knock at my door all day. I could have slept at my desk the whole time and no one would've known. Of course, I'd never do that. I worked like I was supposed to and I got everything caught up (except for one report that the database won't accept for some reason). I even had time left over to work on my Access skills. I started putting together a music datbase there too (using the list from my "Music Collection" page).   My back is still pretty sore, the sitting all day didn't help any. I took my medicine along, but I decided not to take any Vicodins (because of the drowsiness they cause). My back was aching bad by late afternoon and I relented. After a bit, I started nodding off at my desk. I nearly fell asleep. Like I said before, I very easily could have slept at my desk, but I didn't.   Mom offered to pick me up today (which is unusual), so I stayed a little late, until 5:10pm. I arrived about 8:40am this morning, so I have about half an hour of extra time now.   On the way home, Mom and I were trying to figure out what we were doing for dinner and I suggested Carmelita's. Mom was ok with that, so we headed on over there. It was nice, we were the only customers in the whole restaurant. I liked that. I had my usual (Chiles Rellenos Con Carne) and drank some raspberry iced tea with it (they didn't have any sweet tea). I'm not a fan of raspberry tea. I couldn't finish everything there, so I took half of it home. It lasted maybe an hour at home before I finished it off. Good stuff!  I think I'm going to be going to bed early tonight. I may stay up until 9:30pm to watch "Fear Factor" and then "Everybody Loves Raymond". We'll see how long I last (I'm ready for bed now).

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  I bought a couple of new CDs on Friday and got 40 tapes in yesterday, but I haven't listened to any of them yet. I don't think I've listened to anything since Tuesday, the last day I worked. Well, music anyhow. I did listen to  urlLink Al Franken's radio show  on  urlLink Air America  a few times this week. Good stuff.   Watching on TV:  I watched some "Judge Mathis" while I was home from work, but that's about the only daytime show I paid any attention to. I watched "Everybody Loves Raymond", "Seinfeld", "South Park", "Chappelle's Show", and "King Of Queens" throughout the week and weekend. I'm still watching "The Sopranos" every Sunday and "Fear Factor" every Monday. I bought myself the Spinal Tap movie on DVD, but I haven't put it on yet.     Downloading:  Some "oldies" from when I was a teenager: Planet P Project ("Why Me?"), Tony Carey ("Fine, Fine Day"), Saga ("Wind Him Up" & "On The Loose"), The Tubes ("Talk To Ya Later" & "She's A Beauty"), Thomas Dolby ("One Of Our Submarines"), Peter Gabriel ("Solsbury Hill" & "Games Without Frontiers"), and Joe Walsh ("The Confessor"). It's been a long time since I've heard most of those.    Reading:  I've been "reading" album guides in bed and in the bathroom, but that's it really.     Jamming:  I missed band practice on Thursday due to my back problems, we practice again next Thursday and have a gig that Saturday.    Working:  I missed three days of work this past week because of my back, but I should be good to go for tomorrow. I have a lot of catching up to do and I may catch some flak for not calling in to anyone on Friday.   Buying:  On Thursday, I won a Jimi Hendrix box set on eBay. On Friday, I bought a new amplifier, 2 CDs and a DVD. I also won a 2-CD set and a new wah pedal on Friday as well.  Today, I won 2 Rush tapes on eBay.    Selling:  I sold one card from my eBay store, for $1.50.    Eating:  This weekend I've been really bad, eating "comfort food" rather than what's good for me: Hershey bars, eclairs, McDonalds burgers and fries, strawberry cooladas, sodas, steak and cheese hoagie, etc...    Feeling:  Mentally, I'm pretty angry about my financial situation. Losing three days of work and then having to go to the Emergency Room last night (I can't wait to see  that  bill), and then having to pay for my prescriptions, has really hurt me a lot. I had my next paycheck pegged as the one where I'd buy a new guitar (I put $50 down on a new one on Friday), but that's not going to happen now.   Physically, my back problems have been killing my ass (see post below). Otherwise, I'm fine. The medicine I'm taking (Ibuprofen, Vicodin, and a muscle relaxer) has been making me sleepy as hell. I slept almost all day today, literally. I got out of bed a few times to get a drink (the medicine made my mouth dry) and to take more pills, but I didn't get out of bed (to stay up) until 6:30pm. I just hope that doesn't keep me from sleeping when I try to go to bed tonight.    Planning:  Firstly, to get back to normal. To get back to work and get back into the routine that my back problems have pulled me out of. Secondly, I need to get practicing big time. We have a gig next Saturday and one the following Saturday as well and only one band practice before each gig. Other than playing a little while I was checking out my amp, I haven't picked up my electric guitar for a couple of weeks now.

        Just Another Saturday Night In The E.R.   I slept terribly again last night (due to the back pain) and didn't get up until 11:30am, almost too late for yard-saling. About 15 minutes after I was out of bed, we were out the door.   My back felt worse today than it did the day before, but I decided to go out and try and be active anyway (hoping it would help).   We wound up stopping to eat before we stopped at any yard sales. We went to the Pickel Barrel and I bought lunch for us. Mom had shrimp salad and I had a steak and cheese hoagie. Mine was ok, but wasn't exactly what I'd wanted. I guess Mom felt the same because we wound up swapping meals in the end.   From there we hit just a few yard sales before I had to call it a day. The pain from my back was intense and getting in and out of the car was killing me. I didn't find anything for myself, but I found a CD burner for Mom (for just $20). I'll hook it up when I'm feeling better.   On the way home, we stopped at Walgreens and I bought some Doan's backache pills and a couple Hersey bars. After that, we stopped at Dunkin' Donuts and I bought a strawberry Coolada and 2 eclairs. I don't know why I wanted all of that junk food, it's unusual for me.   Shortly after I got home, I went to bed. I tried to read in bed but couldn't get comfortable at all. Eventually I got tired and tried to nap. I must have slept a little, but for the most part, I just kept turning from side to side, and from my back to my belly. No matter what position I got in, the pain would start coming on right away or within a few moments.   I finally got up around 7:30pm and tried to lay on the couch, but the results were the same: intense pain no matter which way I tried to settle. Besides dealing with the pain (the Doan's did nothing to help it), I was getting frustrated and angry. After awhile, it got to be just too much. I was wrenched with pain, in real agony, and crying.   I thought Mom would have come out to help or to try and soothe me or something, but she sat back in her room, basically ignoring me, which upset me even more. I told her I needed to go to the hospital, but she continued ignoring me. I finally went back and yelled at her, telling her "I wouldn't do that to you" if she were going through what I was and then she finally got up and started helping me.   By then, the pain was so bad I couldn't even put on my own shoes and socks, she had to help me do that. We headed to for the hospital as soon as I was dressed and ready.   We went to the one in Countryside thinking it'd be less crowded than the others. It was, but that still didn't prevent a 2 1/2 hour wait before I finally saw the doctor. I was in pain the whole time and I didn't like that they left me out there in that condition. They could've offered me a pillow or something, you know?   After I finally got the call to be seen, I got put in a room and a nurse came and took 4 vials of blood from me. Shortly after, the doctor came in and looked me over for a few minutes. She said all she could do for me at this time was to give me some painkiller and some muscle relaxant. She said to try not to sit for extended periods of time (that's pretty much all I do at my job and at home) and to get some bed rest. She left and then the nurse came back in and medicated me.   They gave me Morphine for the pain and I did not like that at all. It felt really weird. It seemed like it kicked in fast and I felt all flushed and anxious with pressure on my neck and head. Very weird feeling. After that, they had me lay in bed for awhile (I guess to make sure I didn't have a bad reaction to the Morphine). I watched Saturday Night Live on the TV in the room. Janet Jackson was hosting.   Unfortunately, the Morphine didn't do much for me: I still felt the pain. Another nurse came in later and I told him I still felt pain. He said I shouldn't feel anything at all, but then he left and the other nurse came back few minutes later said I could go home. I was hoping they'd give me something else to kill the pain, but that didn't happen. We left around there around Midnight.   We stopped off at McDonalds on the way home (I hadn't eaten since about 2pm) and then we came home and ate. I knew I shouldn't have had McDonalds, I feel crappy now.   I am still feeling a lot of back pain too, maybe not entirely as intense as before, but it's still very present.   Mom just went out to drop off my prescriptions at Walgreens. I don't know if she's going to pick my meds up tomorrow or if she's going to get them tonight. The sooner I get them the better. I need to go to bed, but if I have the same pain I did earlier, it's going to be a real struggle.

        Friday Night Shopping Spree   I went to the bank, signed for my loan, and then waited over at Atlanta Breads for Mom. After she arrived, we went over to Durango's and had dinner (she bought this week). I don't know if I'll go back there again. I had a big ribeye steak and the steak was great, but the rice that came with it was kind of bland, the Firecracker Shrimp we shared for an appetizer was a little too hot to enjoy, the caesar salad dressing was a little on the sour side, plus, they don't have any sweetened iced tea there! Sheesh!  Between my back problems and complaining about my food, I'm really starting to sound like an old man, aren't I? Oy veh!   After dinner, we stopped off at Pawn Depot but they had nothing worthwhile except for a couple pairs of Bose speakers and a couple of guitar pedals. I should go back and check out the speakers next week (after I get paid). I'm tired of listening to my stereo out of one speaker. The pedals they had were a Boss TU-2 tuner for $51 (a decent price) and a Heil Talk Box for $149. I've always wanted a talk box, but this one was missing the tubing and directions and I wasn't sure whether the price was very good or not. I asked if they could give me a better price and the guy said no. That place sure has changed. I used to be able to go in and get some killer deals from John and Gene, but not anymore.   After there, we went on to Sam Ash and I bought my amp. It's still new in the box. I got it for a grand total of $781, a little less than I'd expected, which was nice. The sales guy was really friendly and helpful. He let me put $50 down on a new strat (rather than the usual 20% down). It's a beautiful sunburst Fender American Standard strat with a maple neck and it comes with a case. I think I got confused and laid away the wrong guitar though. I don't really like the bridge on the one I officially laid away. Maybe I'll have them order me a different one. I really like the neck on that one though. I guess the morale here is "don't go shopping while you're in severe pain because it's hard to think straight".    After we left Sam Ash, we went to Best Buy and I bought the "This Is Spinal Tap" Special Edition DVD, and I also bought Fleetwood Mac's "Fleetwood Mac" and Television's "Marquee Moon", both remastered. We went home from there.   During the day, I also made a few other purchases on eBay: a Teese RMC1 Wah for $149, and Ben Stiller and Janeane Garofalo's 2-CD audiobook (still sealed), "Feel This Audiobook", for just $7.99. I wanted to pick up Saga's "Worlds Apart" CD (remastered), but I missed bidding on it and they didn't have it at Best Buy.   I guess I'm going to chill out tonight, go and rest my back up (it needs it especially after carrying the amp in). We may go out yard-saling tomorrow morning, we'll see how I'm feeling. At this point, it may be best to just stay at home and rest. I still may need to go to the doctor's tomorrow too (I held back enough money to do that if I had to). It's a "wait-and-see" situation.

        Pain, Pain, Go Away   Three days of missed work now and my back still feels no better. I may have to go to the doctor's tomorrow, which means I lose even more of my guitar money. Nice.   I didn't call in to anyone either. I don't know how that's supposed to work when JP's not there (he's off today). More than half the company is off today so I don't think I'll get into trouble over it, though missing three days in a row is never good.   I'm supposed to go out to the bank shortly to finalize my loan, and then Mom and I are going to stop at a couple of music stores to see if I can get a better deal on the amp I want than the one Stevie B's offered which was about $750. The most common price I see on them is $769, so $20 off is not a "great deal", no matter what they say. Plus, that price doesn't even include sales tax (making it over $800). Hell, I can get a lightly-used one on eBay somewhere in the $550-$650 range.   I'm not 100% sure I want a Hot Rod DeVille either. It's a nice sounding amp and all, but it is so freaking heavy, and with my back problems, I think I might be better off with a lighter amp. I probably need to check out different amps rather than settling on the one I've used before.  I may have a new amp in hand when I return tonight, but I might not either.

        Still Hurting   Last night was simply awful. I didn't go to bed until 5am, I couldn't sleep so I worked on Access awhile (trying to learn more). And then, after I finally made it to bed, I could not get comfortable enough to fall asleep. The sun was coming up this morning, I could hear Mom getting ready for work, and there I was, still lying awake in bed.   Eventually I fell asleep, but not for very long. By 10:30am, I was out of bed again. I called JP to make sure he knew I wasn't coming in. I wasn't sure if got my message or not because his equipment wasn't here but the band money was gone. He called me back after a bit. He got the message I'd left on the door, he took the band money I'd left (he told me it wasn't necessary, but still, he took it), and he wanted to work on the upcoming set lists. My back was getting aggravated again from standing and sitting (I needed to go lay down again) but he wasn't taking the hint very well. He kept me on the phone for quite awhile.   I've been sitting way too much today, mostly working on Access on the PC or surfing the net and buying things on eBay again. I really don't want to lay down though, it'd be beter for my back and all, but I know I'll fall asleep and that'd just screw me up when it came time to go to bed later tonight. I plan on going in to work tomorrow still, but it's still not definite. I told JP I wanted to go in tomorrow, but didn't know if I could. Losing two days of work, now, of all times, right when I need all the money I can get for my equipment, is just plain bad. Losing three would be a disaster.

        Continuing Pain   I missed yesterday due to back pain and now it looks like I'm going to miss another day of work (today) as well as my band practice (tonight). It doesn't even look good for Friday at this point. I don't know how well JP is going to take the news. I know it makes his job more difficult when I'm not there doing mine, but I hope he understands that I'm not taking calling in sick lightly. I'm having some heavy duty back spasms right now. Hell, I can't even stand up without having pain shoot through my lower back. Plus, it's about 3am and I still haven't slept either. Grrrr!!!!  I knew things had been going too well, something bad was due to happen and sure enough, it did. I lost the hours that would have given me some spending money out of my next pay, and now, by missing work today, I lose out on some of the money that was to go toward my new guitar. I may have to wait a couple more weeks before I can finally buy my new guitar... *sigh*  Before I go back to bed, I will need to write JP a note and leave it on the front door. Hopefully, I will be sleeping around the time he comes by to drop his equipment off. I just hope he's not a dick about it. I will leave him my share of the practice money too, just in case I'm not feeling better by then (it's too late for the band to cancel now).   I repeat... life is wonderful.

        Pain   I knew I should have taken yesterday off from work (I wanted to but we had that repairman coming and I had to be there) because not doing so made my back much worse. Last night, trying to sleep was pure torture; no matter what position I'd lay in, even if it wasn't painful at first, the pain would soon come. I wound up barely sleeping all night long, then when it came time for me to get up, besides being half-asleep still, it was a physical struggle to move.   I eventually made it out to the phone and called in for work. I went back to bed and I stayed in bed until maybe fifteen minutes ago. It's a little bit better now, still painful, but at least I was able to get out of bed and stand up without shooting pains. I'll need to eat lunch (I didn't have any breakfast) and then I guess I'll be laying back down again, resting up all I can today.    I need to, because I really can't afford to take tomorrow off too. I need all the hours I can get at work right now due to the big musical equipment purchases I'm planning on making this week and next, so I really don't want to miss another day. I wish I didn't have to miss this one, now I won't have any spending money next payday (for CDs, DVDs, eating out, yard sales, Goodwill, movies, etc..). I should probably start listing stuff on eBay again this Saturday to help with that.  Ahhh... life is wonderful.

        Tuesday News   First off, my goddamned back is freaking killing me. I don't know what I did to it, but as soon as I got up today, it started kicking my ass. The pain was so intense, I bent over to tie my shoes this morning and could only do one of them before I had to sit down. I've taken about 6 Aleves today (so far).   Because of how slow moving I was, I wound up having to take the late bus in again (I got here about 9:25am).   Not long after I got in, the repairman was here working on the computer that handles the phone lines. He was here until about lunchtime. After he left, I got caught up on my work and went down for some chow (another burger & fries).   After lunch, I called my bank about the loan I was hoping to get (to buy musical equipment with). Good news: I got my bank loan approved and will have an extra $1,000 to use towards my amp and guitar... sweet! I have to go and sign for the loan on Friday afternoon and then I should be able to go and pick up my amp and a new wah pedal on Friday night. I'll have to wait until next payday to buy my guitar though, but I'll still have it in time for our gig on the 17th. Very cool!  I had them make the loan a 6-month plan, they offered a 12-month plan, but I want it paid off as soon as possible since there's no telling how steady this job is.   I guess I have to start looking for the best prices on everything now. Stevie B's had everything I wanted, but they're an official Fender dealer now so I don't think they're allowed to sell for much less than the list price. I'll have to check out Sam Ash and eBay as well (for the wah and amp, I'd never buy a guitar online).   The bank loan was good news for sure, but I also got some bad news today as well: the whole sales floor has been given Friday off, however, I will still have to come in anyway, which really sucks because my job is supporting the sales floor. JP took Friday off too, so, yet again, there will be no training for me either, other than what I can figure out on my own. I'm going to be bored shitless. Grrrrr!!!  I'm going to leave early though (to take care of my loan), so it won't be a full day of boredom, just about 6 1/2 hours worth.

        A Crazy Day   I went to bed early again last night, but still wound up not getting to sleep until about 1am. It was too warm in my room again. In the morning, I stayed in bed with the alarm going off for more than a half an hour. By the time I was supposed to leave for the bus stop, I was busy looking for my keys. It was obvious I wasn't going to make it out there on time, so I went in on the later bus and got to work around 9:30am.    First off, JP called and said he wouldn't be in today because his kidney stone problem returned yesterday. He had me do some work for him over the phone, meanwhile, I noticed there were some PC problems and the clocks on the phone needed to be changed still.   The PC problem was companywide, but one of the servers in my area (the phone room) is an important one that does all the reporting on phone statistics and it went wacko. I had to run back and forth between my room and the computer room asking for help all morning. I rebooted the PC, that didn't help, then they rebooted the PC and the result was the same. I thought they were going to come back and work on it, but they never did. It looks like the program was working out on the floor, but the display in the phone room was screwed up. Hopefully, all of the data is safe or it'll be a mess tomorrow.   The other PC problem they had, the companywide one, was with the network. We couldn't print or access email for a while, which pretty much put me out of business. Luckily, they had that fixed by Noon, so I was able to get all of my work done by 3pm.   I made a call and got a code to change the times on the phones, so that wasn't as big a thing as JP had led me to believe (he said I had to make back-ups of our servers and then shut down the phone switch and then boot it back up). All I did was put the code in, change the "9" to a "10" and hit enter... much easier.   Later, after things mellowed out, I sat and listened to "The O'Franken Factor" from Noon til 3pm while I worked and ate lunch (taco salad). Later, Santana came by and we talked for about 30-40 minutes. His band is going to be playing the same Battle Of The Bands show we are, but on the following night.   I spent the last couple hours of the day learning Access, practicing along with the book JP lent me. It's nice getting paid to learn.   Oh, I received a late birthday present from the company today, a $25 gift certificate for Chili's. Pretty cool!   Mom picked me up from work today (since I was locked out of the house) and she cooked salmon (pinwheels stuffed with crap) and rice for dinner. It was pretty good.   I guess I'd better go, I need to do laundry and look for my keys.   Time is whizzing by tonight.

        Ahhh... Now I Remember!   Now I remember why I hate this time of year: Daylight Savings Time. I don't have enough problems with sleep, now I get to lose an hour as well. Daylight Savings Time... who are the geniuses that came up with that concept? Thanks a bunch, you assholes!    I got up around 11:30am this morning, which, in a sane world, would have meant I slept until 12:30pm. I played around on the PC for awhile, ate lunch, and played around on the PC awhile. Then, Mom came home from shopping and I carried the groceries in.   Apparently, this caused a mini-adrenaline rush, because after I carried the last bag in, I went out and put a new clasp (the thing the door latches onto) out on the front porch. It's a really nice day out (nice and breezy) so I stayed out on the porch and organized all of the yard toys (badminton stuff, frisbees, baseballs, horseshoes, etc...) and then swept the porch off. After that, I let the cats come outside onto the porch. They're still out there enjoying themselves. I saw Jimmy chasing after a fly that was running around on the ground (after I'd flicked it off the screening) and Stevie was playing with a plastic golf ball last I checked. I still need to get the screens re-done and one of the grates needs to be patched so that they'll be safe (from escaping) out there.   I don't know what I'm going to do with the rest of the day. I still need to fold and put away three loads of clothes and I still need to wash another load or two. So much for just "sitting at home and vegging out" the rest of the weekend.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  Nothing but tapes. I got two new Hendrix CDs for my birthday, but I haven't even opened them yet. At work, I've been listening to tapes by Blondie, The Cars, Alice Cooper, The Who, Lyle Lovett, Black Sabbath, Jeff Healey, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and others. At home, I listened to David & David today, as well as some Sheila E and Axe (anyone remember them? I didn't). That's what I like about getting all of these tapes, I listen to stuff I ordinarily wouldn't and I get to discover new music (even if it's old music).   I guess I've been listening to the radio a bit too, but online. Everyday lately, I've been listening to  urlLink Al Franken's radio show  on  urlLink Air America  at work from Noon 'til 3pm. I especially enjoyed their live "coverage" of the Queen's drum solo the other day ("She's gone to the toms... very nice"). Great stuff!   Watching on TV:  "The Sopranos", "Fear Factor", "Everybody Loves Raymond", "Seinfeld", "Chappelle's Show", and some documentaries on the History Channel about Ancient Egypt.    Downloading:  Nothing still.    Reading:  Nothing still.    Jamming:  We practiced last Thursday and we practice again next Thursday. We're still getting ready for the two gigs we have booked in April and we're also looking into getting our own warehouse to practice at (though due to expenses, we may have to share it with another band).    Working:  I worked about 40 this past week, give or take 15 minutes.    Buying:  I still have to pay for the auction I won last week (268 tapes plus wooden storage racks). I will pay for that on Thursday, after the money has cleared Paypal. That's the last auction I won. I bought a bunch of tapes, some storage cases, and some books while out today (see my previous post).     Selling:  Nothing still.   Eating:  I haven't been eating too healthy lately. The problem is lunches, at work. I've been doing the easy thing and going downstairs for chow, which usually means a cheeseburger and fries or a grilled chicken sandwich with jalapeno poppers. All that fried stuff... not good. I also have a Publix sub once a week. Dinners have been fairly healthy though, we're still eating fish once a week, with broccoli and rice, and staying away from red meats and side dishes like potatoes. Mom also makes this green bean stuff that's good (green beans, bacon, and onions), but I don't know how healthy it is (the bacon can't be good). We've been eating out about once a week too, usually going for steaks or something naughty. Mom lost 6 pounds last month, but I have no idea whether or not I've lost even one.    Feeling:  Mentally, I'm doing ok. Not much stress, other than the stress caused my my sleep problems.   Physically, my back has been a little sore and my sinuses are awful, but otherwise, I'm feeling ok.    Planning:  In less than two weeks, I will have a brand new amplifier and possibly more... if I can get a bank loan (I'm going to try next week). I would love to have a new amp, guitar and wah pedal in time for our April 17th gig. If not, I will have to wait a month for my new guitar and then another 2 weeks for my new wah. So... equipment is my main goal right now, that and practicing for our gigs (which I need to start doing again).

        Saturday Stuff   Well, I didn't go to bed early last night like I thought I would. I had been waiting for Mom to get home since she was stopping off at Walgreens and said she'd pick me up some tape storage cases, but she didn't get in until a little after 11pm. After she got in, I organized tapes in my room until sometime after Midnight, then finally went on to bed.    I got up this morning around 9:45am. I had to get up to pee real bad, otherwise I would have stayed in bed longer. I was super congested this morning, coughing like crazy and nearly puking. My sinuses/allergies are awful right now.   Not long after I got up, Mom was getting ready to go out (to the fabric store), and I wanted to go out too, so I got dressed in a hurry and we both went out.   We stopped at a "yard sale" here in the park on our way out. It was an unusual yard sale in that everything was  free . I picked up a walkman cassette player (Philco brand, looks ok, but I haven't tested it yet), an incense holder (a long wooden box), some extension cords (my band is talking about getting our own warehouse, so they may come in handy), and a brand new purple shower kit for Mom (still in the plastic). Pretty cool!  We hit a bunch of yard sales in Clearwater, along Belcher, Keene, and Starkey, but I didn't buy much. I don't think Mom bought anything at all. I found a used baseball for a nickel, an Anne Rice book, "Taltos", for a quarter, a cassette storage case filled with loose tapes (no covers or cases) for $3, and I think that's it. A pretty weak haul, if I may say so myself.   We were going to go over to our usual pawn shop but Mom suggested going to Salvation Army since she said they had a lot of tape stuff there. I found 3 tapes I wanted for $0.50 each:  Rodney Dangerfield "No Respect", Boz Scaggs "Some Change", and INXS "Kick". I also found two more storage cases for $2 each.   I was hungry and didn't really feel like going to the pawn shop right then, so we went to Red Lobster and chowed down. We split the appetizer, Mom had the scallops and I had the stuffed mushrooms and fried clams. They didn't have sweet tea, so I wound up having coke instead (my first since last weekend). I had a shrimp cocktail with my Caesar salad and for the main course, I had steak and lobster. My lobster was undercooked (again) and I had to send it back to cook some more. I hate that. After dinner, I had a frozen drink, a "Sunset Passion Colada". It had Malibu coconut rum and strawberry juice in it... it rocked. I could have had several more of them. The whole meal cost me about $85, a little more than I'd planned on spending, but what the hell. When I have money, I normally don't worry about how much stuff costs, which is good in some regards and bad in others.   After our Romanesque feast, we went over to Goodwill and I bought 15 tapes (Barry White, Sting, several from Chicago, Alanis Morrisette, Billy Joel, Diana Ross & The Supremes, Maceo Parker, and others) for $0.50 each and I picked up 2 or 3 Stephen King softcover books and a Disney guide for $0.75 each.  We headed home after that, it was getting too damned hot out. On the way, we stopped at Dunkin' Donuts and I got a Strawberry Coolada, which wasn't too bad.    I've been working in my room, re-organizing tapes and stuff (I bought another new tape case at Walgreens while we were out today). I still need about 3 or 4 more new cases. They'll have to wait until next pay or the pay after that though, I'm pretty much tapped out. I keep wanting to list cards or tapes on eBay or else have a yard sale, but I keep putting everything off. I guess I'll do that stuff when I feel I  need to . I don't really  need to  right now.   I guess I'm just going to be sitting at home and relaxing the rest of this weekend.  That , I need.

        It's Friday... And I'm Too Tired To Care   I think I'm going to do something highly unusual and go to bed early on a Friday night. I am absolutely beat. Last night I slept badly again, in fact, this whole week has been terrible, sleepwise, so I need to make up some sleep. Besides, I'd like to go hit some yard sales in the morning, so going to bed early really isn't such a bad idea.   Work went ok, very few hassles, a very casual day overall, but I didn't get everything on my daily "to do" list done though, which is a rare occurrance. I had been waiting on data from a few people and I never got it. No big deal though, I'll get it done on Monday.   I did finish all of my side work (as planned) and I even spent some time reading a humongous manual, which I barely understood. I also played around a bit in Excel, trying to figure things out. I also surfed the net a lot, listened to the  urlLink O'Franken Factor  on the internet, ate, and listened to tapes (The Cars "Panorama", The Jeff Healey Band "See The Light", and Blondie "The Best Of Blondie"). I had a whole bunch of free time today... too much, really.  I stayed until 5:15pm, I was going to leave at 4:45pm, but a report I had been waiting on all day had finally arrived so I took care of that.  I had tamales and chicago dogs for supper tonight (my Mom stopped at The Chicago Dog House), my mouth was on  fire . I still have one tamale left, though not for long.   I guess that's it. I have a tamale to finish and then off to bed I go.

        I Got Paid & I Played   I slept poorly again last night, this time because of the A/C. It froze up again last night so we had to shut it off. I went to bed early, around 10pm, and it was already warm in my room. I tried to sleep anyway, but it didn't happen. By 1:30am, I'd had enough. I got up to see if the A/C unfroze yet, and luckily, it did.   Unfortunately, the thermostat got messed with and the temperature set too damned low. I didn't have on the right blankets to handle the cold temperature (65 degrees) so I still had trouble sleeping.   I went in to work late again, a trend it seems. I had about 45 extra minutes anyway (I stay about 15 minutes late everyday), so it didn't hurt anything. I took my time getting to work again and was less organized than usual, but I did get everything taken care of and even had to do some side work (cleaning phones, burning CDs, etc...).   I got paid today too, which is always good. I had 88 hours on this check, more than I'd expected. I now have the first $150 for my amp saved. Next pay, I should have enough to go and buy a brand new one. I can't freaking wait!  I left work at 5:15pm today, got home, ate dinner, and had to leave for band practice. I didn't have time to much else.   The amp I had to use at practice tonight, a Randall, sounded like shit. I fought it all night long. This week's practice wasn't as fun or loose as last week's practice, but it was productive. We ran through set lists for the two upcoming gigs and we also worked on a new song that JP came up with, on the spot I think. I added some strange, Jimmy Page-like, guitar lines to it and it sounded pretty damned good. That wa spretyt much it as far as jamming went, we mainly worked on our sets.   I'm not going in until 9:30 tomorrow (more extra time to use up... they don't allow OT), so I get to sleep until 8:15am. Plus, it's casual day, so I'm not shaving and I'm wearing comfortable shoes and clothes. And... I have money to go eat out with now (in case JP wants to eat out) since Mom went out and deposited my check for me while I was at practice and withdrew some dough for me. I don't have shit planned for the weekend, but tomorrow could be a pretty decent day (if only I can get to sleep ok).

        Child On Board   Two, actually. It took all friggin' weekend and a lot of aggravation, but I finally have both of my nephews down now. I'm still not sure how long I'll have them for though. I thought I'd have the older boy for the whole week and the younger one just until Wednesday, but apparently my sister told the older one he was only staying until Wednesday too. I guess we'll see how it goes; he may want to stay longer or I may want him to go home sooner (which usually isn't the case).   We met them halfway and made the exchange around 7:30pm. From there we headed over to Lone Star (yes, again) and had dinner. Austin, the younger boy, didn't want anything to eat (he'd eaten earlier), Jess and I had some chili and poppers for appetizers (which kicked total ass) and I tried some cajun steak this time (which came with fried shrimp). Mom and Jess had the Teriyaki steak (which also came with shrimp). My steak and Jesse's were a bit undercooked, and I wasn't too thrilled with the way mine tasted anyway. Regardless of the not-so-delicious steaks, it was still a nice meal. The waitress was really nice too.       After we got home, I took the boys outside to roller skate (in-line skates). I had them play games and stuff while they skated. After a while, I went in to change clothes (it was freakin'  humid  outside tonight) and the boys came in and watched TV. We watched the last half of "Jaws" and then we went out and played some more.   I'm not sure what time it was when we came in, but it must have been well after Midnight. I played around on the computer a bit, showed them how to play "Age Of Empires", well, Jess anyway; Austin fell asleep while watching me play. Jess played some "Beach Head 2002" and then they both went on back to bed (that was around 2:15am).   I'm going to have a cup of tea and watch "The Sherlock Holmes Mysteries", and then probably go on to bed and read some more. That's the plan anyhow.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  I listened to my newly arrived Maria McKee CD, "You Gotta Sin To Get Saved", a great album. I reluctly sold my old copy of it years ago when I needed money. Luckily, I found a sealed copy on eBay (cheap too) and now I have it back where it belongs, in my collection.   Watching on TV:  This week, I've been watching a lot more TV than usual: "Trading Spaces", "Insomniac with Dave Attell", "Saturday Night Live", "The Sopranos", "The People's Court", "Judge Judy", "The Simpsons", "Home Improvement", "Everybody Loves Raymond", "King Of Queens", "Chappelle's Show", "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire", "Match Game", "The Most Outrageous Game Show Moments 4" (yes, I was bored), etc...       Downloading:  I downloaded a few games for when my nephews come down (in case  they  get bored).    Reading:  I finished reading "Live From New York" by Tom Shales and James Andrew Miller (very entertaining book) and I started reading Stephen King's "Night Shift"... again. I'd started it before but only got a few pages in before I put it down to read something else.      Jamming:  We practiced on Wednesday and had a gig on Friday, so we're not practicing again until a week from this Monday... definitely not my decision.   Working:  Still no job, but then I really haven't even started looking for one.     Buying:  I bought lunch for me and Mom today and I bought a few things at Walgreens the other night (batteries, tape case, candy bar). I also bought some McDonalds for Mom and I on the way home from Walgreens.    Selling:  Nothing yet. I really need to start up again, real soon.    Eating:  We had Sonnys on Friday and Lone Star on Saturday. I did had stuffed chicken breasts (spinach and cheese inside) one day and we had fish another, and I cooked steaks for Mom and I earlier in the week. I had salad with the meals a couple times. Not the worst stuff for me, but then I've mostly been eating hamburgers and tater tots, and I had that one night of junk food madness (2 McDonalds sundaes and a Hershey bar), and I also have been snacking on Little debbie oatmeal cookies now and again, so I'm still not eating smartly. I have been leaving food on my plate lately though, so that's a good thing.     Feeling:  Mentally, mostly anxious. I was worried about Friday's gig, stressed out about my nephews coming down (about when and if), then there's my whole financial situation, and, of course, my band situation (wanting to play out more and practice more and all of that).   Physically, jumpy legs at night, some minor back discomfort, otherwise I'm just fine... for now. I'm sure my nephews will wear me out by mid-week.     Planning:  I plan on having fun with my nephews this coming week, but after that, my number one priority will be looking for work/income.

        In Limbo   I finally talked directly to my sister about my nephews coming down and it looks like I'll have Jesse (my older nephew) for the whole week and Austin (my younger nephew) will be down just a few days (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday).   Of course, I don't know exactly when I'll be getting Jess. She said maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow. It sure would be nice to know ahead of time, but I guess that's asking too much.   When I had her on the phone, trying to get a definite answer from her, she said she'd call me back. That was an hour ago, so I'm still waiting for an answer.   I'm going to have to find things to do with them away from here. It's been hot as Hell in the house lately now, even with the A/C on. After last night, I thought I'd be sleeping in most of the day today, but by 2pm, I had to get out of bed because I couldn't stand the heat anymore. I didn't sleep too well.   After I got up, and after Mom got home (she was out running errands), I asked her if she wanted to go out for lunch, my treat (like I have plenty of money to spend). We went over to the Lone Star steakhouse. I had an order of jalapeno poppers (cheddar & bacon) and a bowl of chili (which was awesome), with some sweet iced tea to drink, and was in heaven. Mmm-mm good! I was about full just from that, but I'd also ordered a Flat-Iron Peppercorn Steak with a Caesar Salad and fries. I'd never had that kind of steak before, it was really good, better than I'd expected. By the time I finished my steak, I was so stuffed that I couldn't even finish my salad or my fries.  We thought about going to Goodwill, but I said "nah". Even though I spent almost $50 on lunch for us today, I'm still actually concerned about my finances and am trying to spend as little as possible. I don't know how I can justify spending that much on a meal when I refuse to spend $15 on a CD I want. I guess it's because I can buy a CD anytime, but I won't always be able to share a meal with my Mom. I'm really big on spending quality time with the people that matter most to me, family and friends, since I really don't expect to live a long, full life.   Which is another anti-religion argument I brought up with JP last night (we argued over religion for a good half hour), that people would be much happier if they lived for today, rather than some afterlife that may not even exist. Maybe people would value each other more if they knew that the life they have before them right now is the only life they will get.   Anyhoo... so that's where I'm at right now.

        Stolen Money   JP arrived to pick me up around 5:30pm tonight but I wasn't quite ready to go yet. We didn't leave here until 6pm (even though the gig wasn't until 8pm). Good thing too, because after we got unpacked and started setting up, JP and Al discovered that JP's P.A. head had pretty much up and died on us. We tried using the one they had there, but it didn't work either. Luckily, JP had just bought an amplifier for his monitors, so we used that instead. It saved our asses, but it also meant that we couldn't use the monitors anymore, and not being able to hear each other very well... well, that lead to a lot of problems.    The bar had quite a bit of people there, at least 30 regulars, and Jimmy brought in another 10-15 people. It was a pretty small place, so it was actually a pretty decent crowd.    We started playing around 8:20pm, after we waited for a few more people to arrive. We played: "Love The One You're With", "Stuck In The Middle", "Something More", "The Breakup Song", "Hanging By A Moment" (I came in alone, with heavy chorus, but JP didn't follow me and basically we had to start the song from the beginning, went ok otherwise), "Yesterdays Girl" (I played pretty sloppily on this one, as a matter of fact, I was pretty sloppy throughout the night), "The Middle", "Badge" (Al completely forgot the bass intro, I had to walk him through it onstage), "Opportunity Knocks", "American Girl" (I was a bit sloppy on this one), "Crazy Little Thing Called Love", "The Curtain Falls" (started off pretty messy, never really got any better), "Blister In The Sun" (JP's acoustic was way too low, all night actually), "Before You Accuse Me" (Jimmy didn't end it in the right spot and it got extended even longer than usual, which is just too long), "The Difference" (I completely blanked out on the main riff to this song, it's like it disappeared from my memory altogether... pitiful), "Promise You The Moon", "Wild Night", "Feelin' Alright", "The Authority Song" (Jimmy didn't end it quite right, drug it out too long too, otherwise, it was ok) and "Desire" (JP wanted to skip this one, but Jimmy and I wanted to do it, which was a mistake... JP skipped section before the solo, which I, of course, went into before realizing that he'd skipped it... ugh!).   Most of the songs went over pretty well, but we weren't real happy with what we played (obvious from my notes). We had people dancing a few times, but JP followed my set list straight through, instead of moving songs around to fit the mood, so we kept losing the crowd when we could've kept them into us. I guess that's something that'll come with experience.   My Mom, her friend from work, and her friend's husband showed up somewhere between "The Difference" and ""Wild Night". I sat with them between sets. Some drunk dude there kept coming over, talking to us. He wound up buying them all drinks!   My favorite part of his visit was when he started talking about having been in a "fucking gang" (a motorcycle gang, actually) in front of my Mom. I'll bet she really enjoyed that... not!  We got back up after a prolonged break (about 30 minutes), and we played "Happy Birthday" (there were two or three birthdays). For some reason, the crowd really didn't participate as much as we thought they would. After that, we launched into our second set: "Old Apartment", "You May Be Right", "We Don't Need Much", "Circle", "Cold Shot", "Should I Stay Or Should I Go" (I broke a string at the very end of this one so I had JP play "Everyday" while I quickly put a new one on), "Sleeping Forever" (I wasn't quite ready yet, so JP played the intro over and over, ad nauseum, while I finished putting the string on and tuned up), "Safe In My Arms" (I played it in the key I wrote it in, but not the key we normally play it in... d'oh!), "All For You", "I Got Loaded" (JP got lost during the solo section again... it was pretty bad), "The House Is A-Rockin" (JP walked off so I had to improvise several more solos, some ok, some not, not knowing when he'd be jumping back in... it didn't make me happy), "Rockin' In The Free World", "I Wanna Be Sedated" (really damned sloppy, all around).   We definitely were not playing as well as we're capable of. It was pretty embarrassing. We were all fucking up here and there. Strangely, everyone was telling how good we sounded and complimenting us a lot. That stuff's hard to figure out.   Mom and her friends split between these sets.    We took another long break before we went into our last set. Most everyone had cleared out by then, or were getting ready to go. We played: "(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love & Understanding", "Come On Let's Go" (JP forgot to sing the chorus after the solo so we didn't know where to end because he added that part in again later), "Steal My Kisses" (Jimmy forgot to go to the cymbals for the choruses), "The Way" (very sloppy), "Sunshine Of Your Love" (sloppy, then I aborted the jam at the end, which threw everybody off), "Better", "Fell In Love With A Girl" (I started this before realizing that JP hadn't switched guitars yet, then he didn't sing the section after the solo, and again, added it in later, after the rest of us had ended the song!), "I'm Tore Down" (sloppy), "Rock This Town" (Jimmy played this one faster and/or jazzier than usual... I played terribly on this one), "You Can't Run", "Go Your Own Way" (this one started off ridiculously bad; Jimmy came in on the wrong beat, completely out of sync... we actually had to stop the song and start all over again... pathetic).   JP skipped over a couple of songs from this last set. He had a migraine again and I guess he was ready to go. It'd been a long, trying night (which I taped).  Musically, it wasn't a very good gig, one of our worst actually. Not having monitors really crippled us. Surprisingly, we got asked back. They want us back next month. Unbelievable. And, we got paid, $75 each. On top of that, one of the customers there gave Jimmy $20 to split with the band. He said he tried to give it back but the man refused, so we actually ended up with $80 each. The people there were great.  Like I told Al, I feel like I just stole the money. It certainly doesn't feel like I earned it.   Now, you'd think, after a gig like this, that we're going to go and practice even harder, right? Nope, not us. The guys wanted to take next week off because we'd played twice this week. That  sucks ! I guess I'll have to do some practicing on my own.          By the way, we're still trying to get the next dates confirmed with our "usual" club, so at the moment, we don't have anything definite lined up.    On the way home, JP and I stopped by my old workplace so he could drop off his P.A. equipment. For some reason, we wound up arguing about religion all the way to my house. I think having a baby is making him re-think a lot of things.   I just don't think instilling religion in a child, especially when you don't even believe that stuff yourself, just to establish some kind of "moral base", just isn't right. It's lazy parenting. Why allow a church to tell your children what is right and wrong when you can do that yourself? Besides, it's like I told him, what's wrong with telling a child "I don't know"? What's so wrong with telling them the truth, that no one knows and anyone who says they do is just fooling themselves? Is it really better to ignore facts in favor of a system of "beliefs"? And what's so wrong with giving the child a chance to grow up first, to let them decide what is real and what isn't, when they're old enough to reason for themselves, rather than having religion embedded into their minds while they're at their most impressionable? Isn't the whole concept of being "saved" supposed to based on "freewill"? Where's the freewill if a child is taught all along that "this is the way"? I guess I shouldn't be surprised, hypocrisy is nothing new when it comes to religion.

        Things Got Done   I slept until 4pm again today, which kind of sucked. I had a really rought time sleeping last night, tossing and turning for hours on end, which is why I got up so late.   I watched TV on and off all day and night. I didn't really watch much of anything though. Mostly I was busy doing stuff around the house.   I did some more cleaning in my room and I organized my tapes again (I added my cassingles in). I still have a lot to do in there. I  still  have a mountain of clean clothes that need to be folded and put away and a bunch of stuff on my floor that needs to go somewhere (where that is, I haven't figured out yet). I'd like to have my room cleaned up by Sunday though, especially if I'm having one (or both) of my nephews down next week (which still hasn't been confirmed).   I also cleaned the computer area, the kitchen counter, the dining room table, and the litter box. I even took out the trash... twice. Not too bad for a slacker.  I also organized my gig bag tonight and I put fresh batteries in my pedals for tomorrow night's gig. I haven't changed my guitar strings though. I keep thinking I should, but then it's like "nah".  Mom took me to Walgreens tonight, where I bought the batteries for my pedals, a Hershey bar, and another tape storage case (I used my rain check and got it for the sale price), then we went to McDonalds and where I bought 2 sundaes and a 20-piece McNugget. I could've done without the junk food, I certainly didn't need it.   Sometimes I'm a moron.   Actually, this time, I think it was mostly nervous eating. I'm fairly nervous about tomorrow night's gig. I've never been to the bar we're playing and I don't really know what to expect. The other guys aren't real high on the place and it's a different situation than I've experienced before, where we're right on the floor with everybody (rather than up on a stage) and also, we're having to use our own P.A. and we've never had to do that before. Besides that, I don't have any friends or family coming, though my Mom  might  come. I guess we'll see how it goes. I'm sure everything will be fine once we start playing.    So... I guess that'll be my next post, the rundown on how the gig went.

        Band Practice   I slept in really late today, until nearly 4pm. I had gone to bed late last night (around 4:30am) and then I started reading after I got in bed (Stephen King's "Night Shift").   I got up, watched "Judge Judy", cooked dinner, and then went in and practiced on guitar a bit. After that, I took a shower and waited on JP.   After we got packed up, we headed out to practice. He was playing a CD in his car that sounded really good. It was by a band called Audioslave, which I knew nothing about (I'd thought they were some kind of techno dance band). I couldn't even tell it was Chris Cornell singing, his voice sounds so much better than I'd remembered.   It was a real productive practice, mainly because we didn't do any jamming or anything. We ran through a lot of songs tonight, including these covers: "The Breakup Song", "Come On Let's Go", "Should I Stay Or Should I Go", "Desire", "Hanging By A Moment", "Badge", "Crazy Little Thing Called Love", "The Authority Song", "The Difference", "Feelin' Alright", "I Got Loaded", "The House Is A-Rockin", "Fell In Love With A Girl", "I'm Tore Down", and "Rock This Town". We also ran through these originals: "Opportunity Knocks", "Something More", "The Curtain Falls", "Safe In My Arms" (the new one I wrote), "Had A Girl", and "Better".   We also ran through The Beatles' "Birthday". There's supposed to be a birthday party going on with some of Jimmy's friends, so we wanted to do a birthday song. It sounded ok, but without the vocal harmonies (a weakness with us), it came out a bit flat. We'll probably go with "Happy Birthday" instead.   After practice we talked about the gig and compromised on the set and break lengths. It won't be as long as JP and I planned it, but it won't be quite as short as Al wanted. We'll do an 80-minute lead off set and then two 60-minute sets with two 20-minute breaks in between the sets. That'll work.  After I got home and had dinner, I started re-working the sets. I finished up a while ago and emailed them out to the guys. We should be good to go.   Oh, earlier today I talked to my older nephew, Jesse, and he said he wanted to come down next week. I gave him a couplke outs, but he said he wanted to come down, so that's cool. We should have a blast. I'm still not sure if his brother will be down or not; he's usually ready to go home after a day or two.

        Couch Potatoland   I went to be around 3am last night and I got up around 12:30pm today (I'd been sort of awake for awhile though). I woke up after I heard someone walking through the house and then, a few moments later, the lawn people started mowing and trimming and shit.   It was Mom that I'd heard in the house; she stayed home from work today. I'd actually asked her about taking today off a few days ago, for me, to take me around loooking for a job, but I guess she had her own shit to do because I didn't get to go anywhere.   Instead, I watched TV, surfed the net, played "Age Of Empires", did some cleaning in my room, watched still more TV, cleaned some more, took the trash out, cleaned the litter box, surfed the net some more and watched still more TV.    What I didn't do today was practice. I have a gig in less than 48 hours, a long one, and I've barely practiced at all.   Speaking of the gig, I got an email from Al today (after I'd sent him the set lists for the gig) and he said he didn't plan on playing more than 3 hours total, a 1/2 hour less than what we planned on and agreed to. I guess he plans on taking a half hour break between each set. That seems too long to me. Apparently he has a long workday that day, plus he doesn't seem to think much of the place we're playing anyway. They'd played there before, back before I joined the band, and I guess they didn't have a very good experience there.   I have a feeling it's going to be a rough one this time too. I don't have anyone coming at all, mainly because of it being on a worknight(no one wants to come home from work and then rush back out again), even my Mom is iffy, so we may be playing to just a few folks. Oh well, at least we'll be getting paid as well as getting a little more experience.    It's getting late and my bed is covered with junk (from my cleaning), so I'm outta here.

        More Well   I'm feeling a little better every day now; finally getting some of my momentum back. I'm still not sure what I'm going to do about a job yet, but I am pondering several ideas, such as working nights at a restaurant or something. I hate being a "day person" and I really hate dressing up, and I figure if I'm not going to make much money anyway, I might as well be comfortable.   I went to bed early last night, around Midnight, and I worked on the set lists for about an hour. I tried to go to sleep, but by 3am, I was wide awake. I got up and watched TV for awhile ("Sherlock Holmes Mysteries" and a documentary on John Gotti). It was about 5am before I made it to bed.   I slept until about 9:30am and then I started getting an upset stomach and made a couple of emergency trips to the bathroom. I had a rough time sleeping after that and wound up staying in bed til about 4:30pm.   After I got up, I typed up the set lists into an excel spreadsheet and mailed it out to the guys, went out and got the mail (my Maria McKee CD arrived), and then I cooked dinner for Mom and I (steaks with salads and tater tots). That's about the most productive I've been for a week or two. Seriously.   I talked to JP tonight and he said he got my paycheck problem taken care of at my ex-job. My next (and last) check should be for 24 hours, about $200 net, which will help me out immensely.   I tried to practice a little tonight, but I didn't feel much like playing for some reason. I need to learn "Birthday" by the Beatles (for the gig... I half know it already). I need to re-string my guitar too. I'll probably do that tomorrow.    I'm going to try and get to bed early again tonight, like 2 or 3am. I'd like to be getting up by Noon every day, 4:30pm is a little too late. It's still looking like I'll have my nephews down all next week, so I'll need to be up earlier in the day for them anyway.   I should have $75 on Friday (from the gig) so I may have a little bit of money for when they're down. I'd like to take them out to the beach or to a park or something. They like riding the bus, so it'll work out fine... if they actually come down. With them, you never know.

        A Little More Up   I stayed up really late last night playing Age Of Empires II, before I knew it, it was after 6am and the sun was out. I went to bed, but instead of going to sleep, I finished reading the SNL book. It was just before 10am when I finally hit the sack.  I thought I'd probably sleep all day, well into the night, but I was back up around 3:30pm. I woke up feeling a little more "up", not happy and refreshed or anything, but not as severely depressed as I had been all week.   I'd wanted to go up to my sister's in-law's house today but my Mom said my sister wasn't going. Turns out, they went after all. Nice. I think it would have lifted my spirits quite a bit. Instead, I sat here eating, watching TV, and playing Age Of Empires.   This afternoon, I did do something productive though: I started working on the set lists for our upcoming, 4-hour, gig. I haven't finished yet, I was waiting on word from JP about a couple of songs (whether or not to include them). I don't think we have quite enough material. We may have to extend some solos and maybe even do a little jamming... cool with me.   Besides having unfinished set lists, I haven't practiced at all lately, not since last Monday's practice, which is not good. I also haven't taken care of my unemployment insurance, also, not good. I haven't cleaned the grill, I haven't finished cleaning my room, nor have I folded and put away my clean clothes yet... I'm a friggin' mess.   I'm going to try and go to bed at a decent time tonight, and hopefully, start looking for a job and/or taking care of things at home. I may have both of my nephews down next week, for the whole week, so I'd like to get as much done as possible before they get here. Unfortunately, I don't have any money, so I'll have to be creative and think up a lot of "no-cost fun".   By the way, kick-ass "Sopranos" tonight; very intense and exciting. The actress who played Adrianna is on the new "Friends" spin-off, "Joey", so I knew she'd be going soon. Wow.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  Hmmm... well, I listened to the new Los Lobos CD a couple of times, but that was earlier in the week. I haven't been listening to much of anything lately.     Watching on TV:  Saturdays: "Saturday Night Live"; Sundays: "The Sopranos"; throughout the week: "The People's Court", "The Simpsons", "Everybody Loves Raymond", "Seinfeld", and "King Of Queens". I watched the "Jeff Corwin Experience", "The Croc Hunter Diaries" and "Wild West Tech" (about Native American technology) earlier today, and I watched a movie, "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein", earlier in the week.       Downloading:  Right now, I'm trying to find some National Lampoon stuff, but I'm not having much luck. Sadly, I've never heard any of the National Lampoon albums.    Reading:  I've been reading "Live From New York" by Tom Shales and James Andrew Miller... again. I had won the book on eBay awhile back, but I received the older version rather than the newer, expanded, version (which is the one I was supposed to have been bidding on) and read that one off and on in the bathroom. Now I have the expanded version, also won on eBay, and have been reading that for the past few days. I'm about 3/4 of the way through it.      Jamming:  We practiced on Monday and don't practice again until Wednesday, our last practice before our 4-hour gig on the 28th. I'm suppossed to come up with a set list for the gig, but I just haven't felt much like doing anything lately, so I still need to do that. I haven't practiced at all either, which I also should be doing.    Working:  No job. I don't even feel up to looking for one.     Buying:  Nothing.   Selling:  Nothing yet.   Eating:  Nothing healthy. We had Sonnys for lunch/supper tonight (ribs, sliced pork, fries, garlic toast, coleslaw). Last night I ate two TV dinners, fish with macaroni & cheese. Snacking on honey-roasted peanuts in between meals. During the week I ate pretty much the same meal for days: a big-ass cheeseburger (no bun) with that green bean/onion/bacon stuff that Mom makes.    Feeling:  Mentally, depressed as can be. I've totally had the wind taken out of my sails.   Physically, tired.   Planning:  Why bother?

        Doom And Gloom   I've been spiritless for a few days now, just no life in me at all, just very depressed. Yesterday, I stayed in bed and read off and on all day long. Today, I played "Age Of Empires" most of the afternoon. I was a little productive tonight though, I finally made a list of the tapes I have to sell (about 1,000 of them). That took almost all night to do. In fact, I just finished a few minutes ago.   Oh, and it looks like we won't be going up to my sister's in-law's house now... my sister isn't getting along with her mother-in-law and my brother-in-law doesn't get along well with one of his brothers, who'll be there. I guess I'm stuck here all weekend now... *sigh*  I don't have much else to say. I guess I'm heading to bed.

        Not Much To Say   The last two days have been pretty quiet. I've been going to bed around 3am-4am everyday and sleeping past Noon... falling back into my night-owl ways.   Last night, I watched "Mary Shelly's Frankenstein", in full, finally (I caught a bit of it before on basic cable, heavily edited), but I can't say it was worth the wait. I don't think DeNiro was right for the part, especially in the physical sense. I swear I heard a little "New Yawk" in his accent too. The book was better.   Today, I cleaned a little here and there (in the dining room and in my bedroom), started some laundry (two loads), but mostly I spent my time watching TV and playing "Age Of Empires 2". I don't feel like doing much of anything.   I'm still pretty depressed about losing my job. I feel like I've lost the will to live, and I don't necessarily mean dying, I mean just going forward from here, starting all over... again. It all seems so futile anymore. I feel like a plane that's always getting shot down before it even had the chance to get airborne.   It'd be nice to have some friends around, someone to talk to or do things with, but all of my friends have either moved away, gotten married, or are too self-absorbed to care about anyone else but themselves.    I'm just glad I still have the band, otherwise, who knows what sorry state I'd be in.   Mom and I were invited to go up to my sister's in-laws this weekend, I think I'm going to go. Hopefully, that'll cheer me up some. I sure as hell need it.

        Bastards!   I took a look at my paycheck last night, and to my (unpleasant) surprise, they shorted me 8 hours (my "floating holiday pay", the only benefit I could actually use). They had already shorted me the extra 16 hours severance pay (which was supposed to have been corrected) and now this. Nice.   I called up today and the lady that handles payroll said she thought that she'd put the holiday pay on my check, but realized then that she hadn't. I said "I guess the next check will be for 24 hours then" and she said that no one has given her any paperwork on the severance pay yet.   What a bunch of assholes.   JP went to see her boss last week and he was supposed to have taken care of that. But still, this lady works only 15 feet from the boss' office, all she has to do is ask him if it's ok to pay me the 16 hours severance pay, but no, she said JP (my boss there) has to go through Human Resources and have them fill out paperwork telling her to pay me for the 16 hours. There are only a few people left at the fucking place, what's with all of the goddamned beaurocracy?      And speaking of beaurocracy, I am in the process of filing for unemployment... for the first time in my life. I really don't like that I'm having to do it, but I need all the help I can get right now. Between the bank loan for my amplifier (I owe over $800 on that, $173 a month), the Emergency Room visit (I owe over $1,050 for that, part to the hospital and part to the ER doctor), and the guitar that I laid away (I have $588 left to pay on that... by July 1st), all of which I took on before I knew I was going to be laid off, there couldn't have been a worse time to lose my job. They really screwed me good, and they continue screwing me with the paycheck hassles. Bastards.

        Monday Night Band Practice   I just got back from practice, it went ok. The first hour there was pretty much spent setting up JP's P.A. and trying to get the monitors to work (they never did get workin').   After we got up and running, we ran through all of our newer additions: "Come On Let's Go", "The Breakup Song", "Should I Stay Or Should I Go", "Badge" (we worked on this one awhile, getting the timing down), and "You Wanted More". "You Wanted More" is still pretty rough, not sure if we'll play it on the 28th or not.   We ran through some of our older covers like "Before You Accuse Me", "American Girl", "Crazy Little Thing Called Love", "All For You", and "Blister In The Sun". We also did a handful of originals: "Circle", "The Curtain Falls", "Promise You The Moon", and "What She Likes".   We also ran through the new one from last week, with the new lyrics and melody I came up with, which replaced JP's. The song is called "Safe In My Arms". I'm not sure whether or not Al gets some of the writing credit for it though. JP said I came up with the whole song and Al just followed, but it seems to me like Al went to Dm after my verse music and I took it from there. Since the song is in Am and it's kind of a blues, going to Dm would be the natural progression, but still, I don't want to take full credit for it if Al deserves some.    I'm listening to it right now, on tape (I recorded most the practice), and I think we played it a little too slow tonight. We need to tighten it up a bit in places too and maybe add some stops. I'm hoping we'll have it together in time for the next gig.   We also jammed on another one of mine, but it didn't get worked on at all. In fact, JP just kept repeating "fried chicken" over the whole thing.  That was about it for jamming tonight. Mostly we got down to business, practicing for the next gig. Well, that's not entirely true, I mean we did goof off between songs and whatnot.  On the way there, JP and I stopped at a gas station and I bought a 6-pack of Heineken. I hadn't eaten since early in the day (well, early for me) so it only took 1 beer to get me semi-buzzed. I drank two full beers and had about 1/4 of a third one... that's a lot for me (I'm not much of a drinker anymore).  We practice again next Wednesday, last practice until the gig.   Oh! JP has to drive to Atlanta this week and he asked about me going along, a mini-road trip. I think he said it'd be from Wednesday to Saturday and all I'd have to pay for is my own food and drinks. I think we'd have a pretty good time but I just don't think I can afford to do it right now. I'm thinking about it though. I'd love to get the fuck out of Florida, even for a couple of days. I guess we'll see what transpires.

        Wars & Chores   I was only planning on being up until about 3am, but then I started a game of Age Of Empires II, and before I knew it, the sun was out. Ugh! I didn't get to bed until around  7am ! Not good, but at least I won the game.   I woke up around 1:30pm this afternoon, cold and cat-bothered. I could've used some more sleep, but I'm glad that I didn't sleep too late (like 4-5pm).  So far today, I ate lunch, watched "The People's Court", called JP and asked him to bring my paycheck with him when he comes by tonight (band practice), read the newspaper, perusing the classified ads for a job (nothing for me), and surfed the net a bit. There's a lot of stuff I  need  to be doing, a  huge  list of things, but I keep putting it all off.   I have about two and a half hours until I leave for practice, so I guess I'd better go and try to get  something  done.

        Holy Cow! A Productive Sunday!   Stevie woke me up around 10am this morning and I got up. I gave the cats another worm pill. I haven't seen any all day, on either cat, so it looks like the pills worked.   Not too long after I got up, I started working on my eBay store items. I had a lot of updating and editing to do.... very tedious work. I actually just finished a few minutes ago, Man, it's been a long day.   I took breaks in between for lunch (Mom and I ran to Burger King and Arbys) and for dinner (I cooked burgers out on the grill for us). Later, I stopped for about an hour to watch "The Sopranos".  Very strange episode tonight. It seems like everytime something big is going to happen, Tony has a dream episode like this one. Unfortunately, there's only two episodes left this season, it'll probably end with a cliffhanger, and then it'll be another year or two before they air new episodes again... *sigh*  I talked to JP earlier tonight, told him I'd written lyrics and came up with a new melody for the song we started the other night. The only thing I still need to work on is a bridge. I have an idea for it, but it still has to be written.   We practice late tomorrow, an extra hour, so I guess I'd better stay up late again tonight; I don't want to start getting sleepy during practice.   I have plenty to do, I suppose (laundry, cleaning my room, house cleaning, working on a set list for the 5/28 (4-hour) gig, scanning, pulling, and listing cards and tapes for eBay, etc...   Knowing me, I'll probably just watch TV or read until I'm sleepy... The King of Procrastination lives!

        Sleepy Saturday   I didn't sleep too well last night, too cold (that new fan really kicks ass). I didn't get up until sometime after 11am. I got my mailings ready (a package and a bill), then around Noon, I ate some lunch (leftover Chicken Divan) and then crashed on the couch for a few hours.   While I was sleeping, Mom ran out to the post office and to Office Depot, so I didn't have to go anywhere today, which is good, because when I'm out, I tend to spend money and I can't afford to do much of that right now.    I don't know if it was the position I was laying in (fairly uncomfortable) or if it was just my allergies/sinusus acting up again (they've been really bad lately), but I started getting a wicked headache. I eventually got up, took some Aleve, and then went to my room and crashed again.   I was in bed until well after 5pm. I didn't have a headache anymore, so that was good.   I sat out on the couch awhile, watching TV and talking to the cats, and discovered that Stevie has worms again. Ick! I hate that shit! Nasty!   Mom made stuffed salmon for dinner (with rice) and after dinner, I made coffee for us.   A little later, Mom ran out for worm medicine and I went to my room to start cleaning some more. It's still a big mess.   I went to the bathroom to wash my hands and met up with a huge fucking roach... again. The lady just sprayed here yesterday, I guess he was immune to it. Anyway, I hauled ass out to the kitchen, grabbed some Raid, came back, and totally douched that sonofabitch with the Raid. I sprayed him so much that it was choking me! Ugh! Worms and roaches, hell of a night so far.     Later on tonight, it started raining, pouring (even though all the weather sites I looked at said 20% chance), so I took my guitar out on the porch (I love the rain).  Last night, I started working on new lyrics for the new song we came up with the other night at practice. I don't know how well that's going to go over since JP put lyrics to it already. I told him that night that I thought the lyrics didn't seem to fit the music very well. See, he had the lyrics pre-written and when we started jamming, he tried to adapt them to the new song, and to me, they feel forced, like they don't really belong there. I like mine much more, which is rare, because I generally don't like the lyrics I write. I think my melody and chorus are better too, hopefully he'll be ok with what I've written and everything will be ok. I guess Al and I would be credited as the songwriters then. Anyway, I was out on the porch playing that song and I also came up with another new one, another blues.   I really need to start working harder on my own stuff. I think I could put together a really good, solid, album of all original material. I know I can do it, but I'm not doing anything to help me do what needs to be done. Besides finishing songs I've started, I'll need to start looking for musicians to play with, which means I will need my own car to get back and forth from practices and gigs, which means I'll need a job to pay for said car.   And that's the frustrating part, finding a job that'll pay well, that'll allow me to work days/no weekends, that is on a direct bus route, that is semi-casual, and that will hire an ugly, badling, fat guy. It won't be easy.     I'm thinking of taking a couple of weeks off from the job hunt to finally get rid of all of the basketball cards and extra tapes I have lying around here. I'll need to make lists everything I have, then I'll need to start listing everything on eBay. I may put an ad in the paper and just sell off everything I have left in one big lot. I'd like to try and get some decent money for everything, but I'd also be happy to have everything gone, no matter what I get for it. I have a little time now to figure it all out, so that's what I'm going to do.  Also, my nephews will be out of school after next Tuesday and then their summer camp won't start for a week and a half, so I may have them both down here for a week or two. It'll be a handful, but as long as they aren't fighting with each other, it could be a lot of fun. I'm looking forward to the exercise I'll get with them down.     SNL will be coming on soon, so I'm outta here.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  Not much this week.    Watching on TV:  About the same as last week, only with more daytime TV in the mix. Sundays: "The Sopranos"; Mondays: "Fear Factor" and "Everybody Loves Raymond"; during the weekday: "People's Court", "Judge Mathis" and "Columbo"; all week long: "The Simpsons", "Everybody Loves Raymond", and "Seinfeld".    Downloading:  I downloaded a bunch of Pink Floyd stuff during my last day at work, some Billy Connolly and Richard Pryor too.    Reading:  This week, I started and finished Al Franken's book "Rush Limbaugh Is A Big Fat Idiot", which was both funny and insightful. He points out so many Right Wing lies, dirty tricks, and hypocracies in the book that it's a bit troubling as well. I'm not surprised that that kind of stuff is going on mind you, but that so many people are actually buying into the lies. Very troubling.     Comedian Alan King died this past week, which reminded me that I have a book of his lying around, unread for years, called "Help! I'm A Prisoner In A Chinese Bakery!". I started reading it last night. It was probably very funny in 1964 (when it was written), but 40 years later, it just isn't working for me (two chapters in and I haven't laughed yet).     Jamming:  We practiced yesterday and I blogged about it (see post below). JP is going out of town next week, so we're practicing again on Monday since he won't be around to do it on Thursday.     Working:  I put in my last two days this week. (*sigh*) I'm still not quite over the whole "getting-laid-off" thing. I think I've kind of been in shock for the past week. And now, to make matters worse, I called there today to ask about me picking my check up on Monday (rather than them mailing it to me) and I learned that they never put the two paid days they promised me on my paycheck. They were supposed to pay me for yesterday and today. I think it was actually JP's responsibility to make sure payroll knew about it, but he didn't tell them and no one else did either. I called him and he said they'll put it on a check and I'll have it in a few weeks. I guess that's ok, I'm sure I'll need it then.     Buying:  When I get depressed, I tend to spend money, even if I really don't have any extra to spend. This past week I bought two more tape storage cases, a new fan, some more tapes, a CD, and a complete set (Series 6) of Homies. I really don't know why I bought the Homies though. I mean, I like them and all, but I certainly didn't need to buy them, especially now, after losing my job. Besides that, if I'd have looked around, I could've gotten them cheaper than I did. It was definitely an impulse buy and a dopey one at that.    Selling:  I sold one card this week and I started going through the tapes I have to sell, making a list of what all I have. I'm going to start listing again soon.    Eating:  Nothing healthy. Chicken Divan, a barbecue chicken/cheesy baked potato TV dinner, cereal (Honeycombs and Sugar Smacks), liver and onions, mashed potatoes and gravy, a delmonico steak, hash browns, oatmeal cookies... like I said, nothing healthy.   Feeling:  Mentally, worried about the future.   Physically, tired as usual.    Planning:  I need a job. I need a car. I need a life.

        Band Practice   I got up around 11am today. I'd slept ok last night, for the most part.   I watched TV for awhile ("People's Court" & "Judge Mathis") and then I started working on my tapes, mixing in the new additions and the ones I brought home from work, and then making a list of what I have. I plan on listing them on eBay very soon, probably in lots of 10.   I did that until about 6:20pm. I ate a small TV dinner for supper, got ready to go out, packed my gear after JP arrived, and then we headed for practice.   It was a very productive practice tonight. We even came up with a new song on the spot (Am-Dm-E7... almost blues, almost reggae). I'm not sure whether or not it was Al or I who started it, we both added parts to it along the way and then JP added lyrics, so I guess we all kind of wrote it.   We also went over the new covers we're adding to our repertoire: "You Wanted More", "Should I Stay Or Should I Go", "Badge", "Rock 'N Me" (this one may be out of JP's range), "The House Is A Rockin", "The Breakup Song", and "Come On Let's Go". We also ran through a few other covers ("The Way", "I Got Loaded", & "The Authority Song") and a few originals as well ("Better", "Yesterday's Girl" & "We Don't Need Much").  I started playing some of my stuff but it didn't even get jammed on this time, just kind of ignored.    That reminds me, I called a drummer/singer last night about an ad he placed in a musician's classified section online and we talked a little. He was looking for a guitar player to form a blues band with and I called to see what was going on with his situation. I was thinking about putting a second band together so I could finally have an outlet for my own music and in hopes that I could work more as a musician, rather than getting another dead end job. I don't think anything will come of it though, he wasn't very interested (he didn't like the idea of me splitting time between two bands) and I wasn't real comfortable with the whole "singing drummer" thing.   I think it's going to be hard to find the situation I want anyway, but because I don't have a car and am unable to provide my own transportation, it may be near impossible.      Anyhoo...  Jimmy got us booked for a gig on the 28th, a Friday. We'll play from 8-12 (four hours!?) and we'll have to supply our own P.A. equipment (JP has a P.A. system), but we're getting $300 for the gig. I suggested we use that money to get a press kit together (photo, info, etc..). JP talked to a booker and she said she needed that stuff to get us more, and better-paying, gigs.  The other big news of the night: JP's going to be a dad. I guess the baby's due in January (he said he needed January off from playing out). He'll be a good dad, and I just know his parents are going to spoil the kid silly.   Jimmy's taking August off for the same thing, his third child.    I hope we start having some success soon, because, even though I'm happy for the guys, I'm worried that they just won't be able to devote the time into the band that they can now (once or twice a week, which ain't much).   Myself, I'd love to play 4 or 5 times a week.   I need a job and a car... badly.

        Liverized   Mom called me at work around 4:30pm asking what I felt like for dinner, jokingly I said "liver", and then she said "ok". She picked me up from work and we went back to that place we went to last night (the one I said I was in no hurry to return to) and I had liver and onions for dinner. It was good and I left there with a full stomach. Not bad for $5.99.   Man, I burned 9 CDs for myself today, almost all Pink Floyd stuff that I'd always been meaning to check out. I also burned a couple comedy CDs, for myself and for JP.  And now, I'm officially unemployed.

        Last Day On The Job   I slept terribly last night, not sure how much sleep I got, but it didn't feel like much. I started reading Al Franken's book "Rush Limbaugh Is A Big Fat Idiot... And Other Observations" before bed, so I went to bed later than usual, which didn't help my sleep any (funny book though).   I got on the bus today and it was completely empty except for this one cute girl who's been riding it the past two weeks. I wish I had the confidence to speak to her, but I'm just not one of those guys. I mean, I still live at home, I just lost my job, obviously I have no car, I'm in debt up to my ears, and I haven't even gotten to the balding, fat guy thing, so I don't have any reason to be confident about anything, you know? Therefore, I said nothing. She probably would have thought I was just some "creepy guy on the bus" if I'd have said anything to her anyway. Oh well.   It's been another quiet day again here at work. I am bored to death and ready to go the fuck home. There just isn't shit to do. I've already surfed the net about all I'm going to, I ate already (was supposed to go out to lunch with JP, but he couldn't make it after all), I listened to the O'Franken Factor already, I have music downloading (early Pink Floyd stuff) right now, burned a few already, and I'm sitting here now, typing this. I'm doing all I can from falling asleep at my desk.    I talked to the temp staffer here earlier today, and he said he was going to look into this one part-time job for me. It's only 20 hours a week, Monday through Thursday, but he didn't know what the hours were or what the pay is. I'll probably just look for stuff on my own and go to him as a last resort.   To be honest, I'd really like to see if I could make a living selling stuff at the flea market or on eBay. I haven't had much luck in the workplace, and I'm tired of starting over again every year. I don't know how I'd do with that though. When I tried selling on eBay before, I slacked too much, but I may not have much of a choice anymore.   It's a pretty scary time for me right now, losing my job and then having so many big bills piled up in front of me... very scary, shit.   I'm not looking forward to the future at all.

        Mother's Day Dinner   Well... "The Sopranos" was a bit of a disappointment. It wasn't bad, but I was expecting some major shit to go down this time. I guess they're still building up to it...    I think I slept pretty well last night, for a change. I easily could have slept another few hours though. I think the lack of sleep is finally catching up with me. I've been tired all day. Hell, I'm ready for bed  now .    Today at work was like yesterday at work: boring as can be. I just sat there doing nothing for most of the day. I hate it. I read the classifieds section of Sunday's paper, I watched a sketch from "The Dave Chappelle Show" (downloaded yesterday), downloaded a couple albums and burned them to disc, bullshit with Santana for awhile, ate, listened to the radio, talked to Mom, and surfed the net (a whole lot). I'd much rather have been working my ass off all day, for real. Ah well, only one more day to go.   I called Mom to find out where she wanted to go for her Mother's Day dinner (since I couldn't take her Sunday). I thought we'd be hitting Red Lobster, but instead she wanted to go to The Country Skillet (she was jonesing for liver and onions).  There were some strange looking people there, especially the no-eyebrow-having waitress who looked like a female version of Divine (a fat guy posing as a fat woman). Creepy.   I had a Delmonico steak and Mom had the liver. I tried a bite of her liver and onions and it was pretty good... now I want some. I may have to go back there, though I'd really prefer not to.   The prices were reasonable and the food was good enough, but it just wasn't my type of place, with the overly bright and open dining room and of course, the strange-looking people there.   After dinner, we stopped at Walgreens and I bought two more cassette tape storage cases ($6.99 each with the raincheck)and a fan that actually blows air out the front of it (I've had it with mine, blowing just a little air out the sides).   After we got home, I went to my room and started putting away the tape lot I just got in yesterday. Unfortunately, some of the tapes sound pretty bad. It's turning out to be a pretty bad buy after all.   By the way, I thought I'd throw my two-cents out there and say that I also do not like the changes Blogger made. I liked being able to see my previous posts underneath where I'm entering in the new post, just in case I had to check on something. Like I read on someone else's blog, "why fix what ain't broken?" If they're going to make some changes, how about adding in a comments section or a photo gallery?

        Two To Go   I woke up tired and didn't want to get out of bed this morning. I did though, and went in to work.   Very lame day. I had everything done by Noon and then had nothing to do the rest of the day. I wound up downloading videos on the PC, "Dave Chappelle's Show" and "SNL" (various Will Ferrell clips), and I watched most of them with JP. I also surfed the net, ate, listened to the radio, etc... It was a long ass day.   I have two more days to go and then I'm out of a job. JP was supposed to talk to the boss about having me work part-time only, but I don't think he did.  When I got home I had a package waiting for me, some tapes I 'd won on eBay. They came in a wooden storage case, but the USPS totally destroyed it. Luckily, most of the tapes were just fine (a few clunkers in there). Nothing too great in there, I probably should have passed on the lot but I got it so cheaply (a little over $9 for 42 tapes and the case). Oh well, no biggie.   I won another, smaller, tape lot last night while I was away: 12 tapes for $5.83. There was a Black Crowes tape in there I really wanted ("Three Snakes & One Charm").  Oh, "The Sopranos" repeat tonight at 10pm... I can't wait!

        Mother's Day   I got out of bed around 11:45am on Saturday morning (I didn't sleep very well all night), and an hour later, after Mom came home and after I was ready to go, we hit the road to my sister's house.  On the way there, we stopped at Sam Ash and I paid another $100 on my guitar ($588 left on it). We also stopped off at McDonalds and I grabbed a couple burgers and a fry.    We didn't stay at my sister's house too long before we left there for my brother-in-law's parent's house in Brooksville. The boys went with their dad and I rode with my Mom, niece and sister.   To my surprise, my niece did the driving! She did a pretty good job too!    On the way up there, we stopped at Winn Dixie to get my nephew's ice cream cake. My niece and I went in to get it but we got sidetracked by the vending machine with the Homies in it. My niece bought two of them, then I bought a handful of them. One of the Homies I got looked exactyly like my niece (same hair, clothes, and complexion), everybody else thought so too. It was pretty funny! She really liked it a lot so I gave her it to her.     Her grandparents just had their house built for them last year (they've got money) and I hadn't seen it yet (I was supposed to go up last Thanksgiving, but I stayed home for a friend). It's  really  beautiful (the architecture, the decorating, the furniture... everything), and the house is completely surrounded by woods (they have a nice chunk of property)... really nice.    One of the first things I did there was ride a four-wheel ATV through the woods. For some reason, I started off riding with my niece (her idea), but then I asked her why we couldn't each have own own, sine they have two of them. She said we could, so we did.    Man! Those things  haul ass ! They have a trail out in the woods and I was whipping through there like a mad possessed! It was awesome! We went out on the road too, and I got over 45 M.P.H. out there. I probably could've gone even faster.  At one point, I was way down the road coming back towards my niece (who had my younger nephew on her ATV with her by then) and I started coming right at them, really fast. I don't think I got within 100 feet from them before my niece panicked, rode down into the ditch, back up the ditch, and crashed into a wooden fence there. I couldn't believe it! The whole thing looked so ridiculous, like something out of a Three Stooges movie. Me and my nephew were laughing our asses off at her! My nephew came over and high-fived me as soon as he hopped off of her 4-wheeler! I had to get off my ATV and get hers unstuck (it was jammed under one of the slats in the fence). She said "don't tell anybody!"... I think she was worried about how it would look since she's just starting to drive.     While out in the woods, I almost bit it myself. I was hauling ass in one area where I shouldn't have been, the trail is very uneven in some parts, and when I hit the brake, the back of the bike went up, I went up, paused in the air, and came back down. Whew! A little more momentum and I would have been eating dirt.   Riding that thing made my hands sore. They felt like they were going to blister up, but they never did. They're still a bit sore today too.   After we finished riding, I grabbed a baseball & bat and hit balls to my older nephew. After a while, I switched to hitting a tennis ball. My younger nephew and niece joined us eventually and took turns hitting the ball. Even my sister came over and hit a few, which was suprising. Everyone hit pretty good.  We all went in for dinner and chowed down on hamburgers and hot dogs, baked beans, and macaroni & cheese. It was good, but I could only eat one burger (with some kick ass muchrooms on it); I just didn't have room to eat any more.     After dinner, I went out and shot the basketball with my nephews and their grandfather. Their dad joined us for a little bit too. My younger nephew got clocked by his brother (driving to the basket) and wound up with a black eye. It's always something with those two.   We all came in a little later and sat around joking out on their screened-in back porch (that overlooks a wooded hill). It was getting late, and I guess the grandparents were ready for us to leave, so we said our "goodnights" and "thank yous" and headed back to my sister's house.   We weren't there too long again. We had some melted ice cream cake there and then we took off. My sister wasn't in a very good mood by then, so it was definitely time to leave.  We got home around 11:30pm... I'd accidentally left my Homies in my sister's car, but even worse, I'd missed "The Sopranos". I was going to stay up and watch it at Midnight, or else tape it, but I did neither. I was tired so I went on to bed.   I should have stayed up though, because I could not freaking sleep. I was still awake around 1:30am, and I didn't fall asleep until much later. Very frustrating.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  I moved my tapes out of my office on Tuesday afternoon, after I found out I was losing my job, so I haven't been listening to too much music this week. I did play the new Los Lobos CD I bought ("The Ride") and I had some tapes and CDs on in my room while I cleaned: Buddy Holly, Jefferson Starship, Eric Clapton, and the Smashing Pumpkins. Unfortunately, the Smashing Pumpkins tape got eaten... dammit.   Watching on TV:  Saturday: "Saturday Night Live"; Sunday: "The Sopranos"; Monday: "Fear Factor"; all week long: "The Simpsons", "Everybody Loves Raymond", and "Seinfeld". I watched the old "The Match Game" a few times this week too.   Right now, I'm half-watching the new version of "The In-Laws" but it's not very good.    Downloading:  I downloaded a few songs last night, just stuff for the band. Oh, I downloaded Eddie Izzard's "Circle" during the week as well. I tried listening to it last night, but I was only half-paying attention to it. I need to buy the DVD.     Reading:  Still nothing.     Jamming:  I had band practice Thursday, and we practice again this Thursday. Hopefully, we'll start working on a bunch of new songs, getting ready for the next gig (a new place, we're trying to get it set up for the 29th).    Working:  Hmmm... I think I worked about 31 hours this week. I believe I will get paid 8 hours for Friday, when I stayed home. I guess I'll find out on soon enough. I have three work days left and then I'm unemployed again. JP said I'm supposed to get paid for Thursday and Friday of this next week, free money. I certainly can use it. Hopefully, I'll be allowed to work part-time, but I'm not counting on it.   Buying:  I an Eric Clapton cassette tape box set, "Crossroads", on eBay, for just $4.49. Sweet! I'm getting set to bid on another of those SNL books that I bought before, when the lady falsely advertised it as the "expanded version". This one is definitely the "expanded version" ( update : I snagged it for just $4.34, shipping included).   Selling:  Nothing this week. I need to start loading up my eBay store soon... gotta bring in money somehow.    Eating:  I've been eating a lot of good food for dinner, but it's mostly been bad-for-me type stuff: Sonny's ribs, sliced pork, Stavros greek salad, Popeyes fried chicken, mashed potatoes & red beans and rice, and tonight, Mom made Chicken Divan. I've also eaten nachos and cheese quesadillas from Bradford, a cheeseburger, a meatball sub, and french fries from Kelli's (downstairs from where I work), a couple Publix roast beef subs, and cereal (Honeycombs & Sugar Smacks... aka Smacks). Not exactly food for fitness.    Feeling:    Mentally, worried as hell about my finances. I don't know how I'm going to be able to make ends meet. With the addition of the new doctor bill I got in today, I'm hurting to the tune of nearly $3,000 ($1,000+ to pay off the bank loan I took out before the emergency room visit, almost $700 left on the guitar I laid away before the emergency room visit, and of course, the $1,000+ I need to cover my emergency room visit).    Physically, my feet have been really sore lately. That's one of the real reasons I stayed home on Friday, besides being tired and just plain not wanting to go in, I needed to rest my feet. Otherwise, I'm pretty much ok.    Planning:  To start all over again, again. I'm not loving life right now.

        Saturday Stuff   Yesterday afternoon, I took a "nap", from about 2:30pm until about 7pm, which screwed me up all night. I was only going down for a short nap, figuring Mom would wake me up when she got home with the dinner (we had Sonny's last night), which should have been around 5:30pm, but she didn't bother to wake me. I'd ordered fries with my meal and they were ice cold by the time I woke up. Nice.  After eating (them Baby Back Ribs was good!), I mostly played around on the internet, locating sheet music and downloading songs.   We're supposed to have at least 4 more songs ready for next practice. We're working on "Santeria" by Sublime, "You Wanted More" by Tonic, "Badge" by Cream, "The House Is-A Rocking" by Stevie Ray Vaughan, and "Lump" by The Presidents Of The United States Of America. I'm still pissed that we aren't doing any Hendrix yet.   I also played guitar for awhile too, practicing some of the new songs I have to learn,  but I also came up with a new song, a really country sounding song. It's called "Liar" (so far).   Before I headed to bed, I took the trash out. By then it was really late (around 3:30pm). After I got to bed, I had trouble falling asleep again. Like I said, I think that "nap" screwed me up. I don't think I fell asleep until sometime after 5am, but then I woke up around 9:45am, got up to pee, went back to bed, laid there for about an hour, then got up. I should be dragging ass, but I'm not. Weird.   I ate the rest of my Stavros Greek Salad for lunch and had some Sonny's sliced pork with it, very good stuff.    I got a payemnt ready for the mail (for the Eric Clapton "Crossroads 4-tape box set... $4.49, including shipping) and I discovered some unopened mail from yesterday. More great news for me. It was the doctor's bill from my emergency room visit, another $311.00 I now owe.   The hospital charged me $756 and now I have to pay another $311? What a fucking scam they have going. In no way did I get over $1,000 worth of service,  no fucking way . The doctor who saw me (after I had to wait in the waiting room, in pain, for about three hours) didn't even do any x-rays or tests on me, just had me bend my legs and then a nurse came in, gave me a shot of Morphine, and had me lay in bed for an hour. That's worth $1,000? The fuck it is! Greedy bastards. And isn't this just what I needed, a few days after finding out I've been laid off? Fucking happiness.   I've been in my room cleaning since getting that wonderful news, working on the mess that is my room. I took my dartboard out and I think I'm going to hang it in the living room. I put up another wooden Napa Valley cassette case near my bed and filled it with tapes of my music, past and present. It's right above my 4-track, where the dartboard was, so it fits right in. I'm working on filling up the dresser that was in my closet and clearing out drawers from the desk I moved out. I still have a lot of work ahead of me.   Oh, tomorrow we're supposed to go up to the kid's Grandparents house somewhere well past New Port Richey, a good two hours away. I guess we'll have a family day together to celebrate my brother-in-law and nephew's birthdays as well as Mother's Day. I may take Mom out to dinner tonight, we'll see. Neither of us are showered or ready to go anywhere, so I guess we'll see how that goes.

        Home Alone   I got to bed late last night (after Midnight), took forever to fall asleep, and then slept poorly again (going in and out of sleep). When my alarm went off this morning, I just laid in bed wishing I didn't have to get up. I finally did though, I got up to turn the alarm off, called in to work, left JP a message saying I wasn't coming in, and then went back to bed.   I was planning on going back to sleep, but instead I laid in bed playing guitar for about a half an hour or so, working on my new songs. Eventually, I got up and called work again. I talked to the receptionist/Human Resources girl and asked if I could use today as my one paid day off (the only benefit I didn't have to give up). Of course, the real HR guy wasn't in again, so she filled out the form and will have him okay it on Monday (if he comes in). He hardly ever shows up, and when he does, he does almost nothing as far as anyone can tell. Yet, oddly enough, he isn't being laid off, I am. It pays to have friends in high places.   Most of the day today, I sat on the couch and watched TV. Mom taped the last "Friends" for me last night and I taped Los Lobos on "The Late, Late Show", so I had some decent stuff to watch, rather than the usual daytime TV drivel.   I just ordered chow from Bradford (nachos and a quesadilla) so I'm waiting on food right now. I hope it gets here soon because I'm freakin' hungry!

        On The Chopping Block: Day Two   I slept badly again last night (too many worries) and went in to work 1/2 an hour late again. On the bus ride in, I snagged a copy of the Classified section (there was a paper where I sat down) to look for a new job. Not much to see there. I think I'll wait until Monday, after JP talks to the asshole boss about keeping me part time (20-25 hours), which would be just fine with me. If he says "no", then the job hunt will begin.    So anyway, it was a really slow, long, boring day (luckily, no asshole boss again). There just wasn't much for me to do since JP had me stop doing a few of my usual daily chores. After I got my work finished (sometime around 11:30am), I surfed the net, bullshitted with a few of the guys there, burned a bunch of CDs for people, surfed the net again, ate, listened to the O'Franken Factor, surfed the net some more, looked through some magazines, talked to Dana (my niece) for about 1/2 an hour, and then went home. Real productive day, huh?   I wish I had more to do, I really don't like slacking off like that. Still, that didn't stop me from staying there late, until 5:45pm (trying to make up some time). I got home around 6:15pm, ate half of my Stavros Greek Salad, got ready for band practice, and then headed out as soon as JP arrived (late, after 7pm).   Band practice was kind of weird. Al learned the new songs that we were supposed to go over this week but no one else did. Hell, I didn't even know for sure which songs those were until today. So instead of going over some new songs for this week, we went over the new songs from last week and we went over some of the songs we needed to tighten up.   We also played a few of mine, but again, they got jammed on and not worked on. While there, I came up with a cool riff that we jammed on and I added some chord structure to it as well... it was pretty cool (Al said it was ZZ Top-like). JP taped practice this time and he said he thinks he recorded that jam. I hope so, because I'm not sure if I remember the main riff anymore.   It seems like we didn't get that much done this practice, but maybe we did. We worked on "Better" a lot more, which it needed. The chorus isn't so cluttered anymore, so that's good. I think Al laid back on it a bit more, which helped.  I need to start practicing more. I sounded pretty bad on a couple of the covers we did. I hope I'm allowed to keep working at my job, part time, because I really liked having the extra time to work on my music.  After practice ended, we talked and settled on a couple of gigs we had offered to us. We'll play out at the usual club in June (I forgot the date) and July (the 3rd) and we'll try a new place at the end of this month, a 3-hour, $300 gig, probably on the 29th. Sweet!  Ok, gotta go, it's late.

        On The Chopping Block: Day One   I so did not want to go in to work today. I barely slept all night, worrying about my finances and my job situation (or lack therof), so I woke up tired as hell and got out of bed late (around 8:45am). Besides that, who wants to go where they aren't wanted? I know JP was trying to help by getting me an extra week there, but really, I think I would have preferred have been fired outright than to have to hang around for another week, knowing full well I'm a goner. Only out of respect for JP, did I go in.   I got there around 9:30am. He didn't show until 11am, saying he was unmotivated to come in. Morale around there was pretty bad. There was a lot of grumbling and complaining as well as a bunch of sympathy and well wishes for me, which was nice to hear, but it also made it hard to forget that the shadow of the axe is looming above my neck.   The asshole boss who fired me wasn't there today. I'm really not looking forward to seeing that scumbag around the office. I hope he stays gone until next Thursday. Bastard.   JP said that I am supposed to work until next Wednesday, the end of this pay period, and they are going to pay me for an additional 16 hours hours as well. I'm not sure if it's all going to be on one check or if I'll have to wait for the 16 hour check. Either way, in just a couple of weeks, I'll be hurtin' (financially).   The temp staffer there asked me if I'd be interested in assembly work, I'm not, but I may have to look into that anyway. He also asked me what's the minimum pay I'll work for. I really didn't answer that... I didn't know what to say. I guess I don't want to make less than $8, though I think $10 an hour is much more reasonable. I'm 35 years old, and I think I deserve to make more than a 17 year old McDonald's employee, you know? It's not like I'm an inexperienced worker or an incompetant one... I shouldn't have to scrape by all the fucking time.   *sigh*    Five more hellish days to go through... and then the fun really begins.

        Once Again, Punk'd By Life   Last night was a sleep struggle. I couldn't get comfortable, then I got too hot at one point, started sweating, and I also had to get up a few times throughout the night; it was rough. Still, I managed to get to work (almost) on time (9:02am).   The software programmer guy came in and helped me with that one Access query (the one that takes 3 1/2 half hours to run). He did altered things within the query and now it only takes about 5 minutes to run the whole process! Sweet! He really knows his stuff, but he's a pretty strange dude. He kept talking about "God" and "The Lord", really made me uncomfortable. He even said, with a straight face, that his programs always work because of God's will... tell me that isn't a little strange. He also started talking politics and began praising Bush (no surprise there, huh?), which is just bewildering to me. It's funny how so many "men of Jesus" seem unable to understand the basic philosophy of Jesus (hint: it doesn't involve making wealthy people even wealthier or starting wars).   Anyhow, he got eveything working well for me and it was a very productive day. And my reward for all of my productivity? That's right, I got laid off.   About 10 minutes before quittin' time. JP called me in to his office and I knew it wasn't going to be good. He said they're laying off a few people and I'm one of them. I actually said it before he said it, I could tell it was coming. Bastards. More corporate greed. Instead of fixing their finacial problems through better management, their solution is to lay off, lay off, lay off. Of course, they always lay off the wrong people. They need to lay off some of the many managers/vice presidents who are on the payroll, who do very little, earning way more than they're worth.   The timing just couldn't be any worse for me. I have a $1000 bank loan to pay off ($175 a month), a guitar on layaway (over $600 left to pay), and an Emergency Room bill to pay (about $750). I'm totally screwed. If that weren't bad enough, the health and dental insurance I've been working towards since I started working there is now cancelled. I was just starting to get my life straightened out and now I'm back where I started.    JP said I can work until next Wednesday (he said he argued for 10 minutes just to get me that, everyone else that got laid off went home today) and then they'll pay me for Thursday and Friday, but I don't know how (or if) that'll work since I'm not on salary. I guess I'll have to take it one (numbered) day at a time. Bastards.   *sigh*  Mom picked me up from work (to take me to Best Buy, as planned) and I brought my tape collection (4 cases full) down with me. JP helped me carry them down. On the way to Best Buy, I came close to crying, feeling sorry for myself (wondering why it is that I always wind up on the losing end of everything), but I didn't. Instead, I spent money I shouldn't have spent (given my new situation). I bought the new Los Lobos CD ("The Ride"), they didn't have the Jimi Hendrix tribute so I started looking for another CD to buy and wound up buying a Blind Willie Johnson 2-CD set ("The Complete Blind Willie Johnson"), a remastered Muddy Waters CD ("Live At Newport"), and a 50-pack of jewel cases. I almost bought Ray Romano's CD, but I put it back at the last minute (I didn't want to pay $15 for a single CD).  From there we went to Circuit City where I bought the new Hendrix tribute CD ("Power Of Soul") and I also bought another copy of that Rodney Dangerfield CD I bought last weekend ("I Don' Get No Respect"). My old one has a bent up cover and this one was only $3.99, so I said "fuck it" and bought it.   On the way home, we stopped off at Popeyes and I bought dinner for us. We chowed down.   I called Jesse and wished him a Happy Birthday. We're supposed to go up on Saturday for his party.   I'm starting to get depressed now, worrying about how I'm going to make ends meet.   Bastards.

        Sunday & Today   I stayed up too damn late cleaning my room and watching TV on Saturday night, until sometime after 5am, then I slept off and on for a few hours on the couch Sunday morning because my bed was too cluttered to use. I felt tired and sore all day Sunday. We were going to go to Goodwill on Sunday, and I had planned to go to the Steve Winwood concert Sunday night, but I felt so crappy, I really didn't feel like going anywhere anyway. I worked in my room off and on, did some laundry, but mostly I sat in front of the computer or in front of the television (pretty good "Sopranos" this week, but next week's looks even better), basically resting my back. I was in bed (my own, I cleared it off) before 10:30pm.   I had trouble sleeping at first, but I woke up feeling like I'd actually had a good night's sleep, so that's cool. What wasn't cool was that it was storming out and I had to wait for the bus in the rain. I would've gotten soaked at my normal stop (especially from trucks passing by, splashing me), so I walked down the road to a sheltered one, but it wasn't much better (the bench was drenched and rain was splashing on me underneath it). I punched in at 9:36am (I took my time getting ready this morning), late, and a bit soggy to boot.  I have a lot of work to do in my room still. I have piles of clothes, musical equipment, sheet music, and various other stuff, sitting in the middle of my floor and I have to find a place for everything, which won't be easy since I moved my desk out. I need more storage space now, or else I need to get rid of some stuff. Grrrrrr!!!!!

        Out And About   I got up around 12:35pm this afternoon, after a rough night of sleeping. I showered, then got a package I had to mail ready to go, and then me and Mom hit the road.  It was supposed to rain today, all weekend actaully, but it was hot as hell out today. We wound up only going to a few places: a yard sale here in the park (they had four Harry Potter books, but I didn't want to pay what they were asking), the post office, the new book store next to the post office (I bought a new, 5-CD audiobook by Al Franken for about $9.50), Goodwill (I bought a Billy Squier tape and a PC Game, "Caesar II, for less than $3), Orv's (I bought 5 packs of top loads for $10), and then we went over to Durango's for lunch.   I had a rack of Baby Back Ribs with fries and baked beans. It was pretty darn good but it would have been better had they had sweet iced tea. I wound up drinking water and Mountain Dew instead. We even had desert this time, fried iced cream with hot fudge. That was probably a mistake though, because we were stuffed when we left there and just wanted to go home... it was the end of running around for today.   After I got home, I started working on my room, making space for all of my tape storage cases. I wasn't sure how I was going to do it and I wound up moving my tapes around (I'm talking about 25 cases full of tapes) and at one point, I hurt my back again. It started hurting really bad, like I'd strained it and I couldn't get comfortable for a few minutes. Mom brought me my pills (I have a couple Vicodin left) and it started getting better after that. It aches a little right now, but it isn't extreme pain like it was earlier.  I've been on break for a little while now, I need to go back in and start working again; my room is a frigging mess. I have clothes and tapes and sheet music and music books and guitar equipment and other assorted stuff spread out all over the place. I need more space. I moved out one dresser, I think I'm going to move my bed and a couple of shelves filled with CDs, and I may move my desk out of my room as well, so my back had better hold up.   I have a killer earache working right now too.   Serenity, now... SERENITY NOW!

        Another Wasted Day   I didn't get to bed until late last night, then I read for a short while, and then I struggled to get to sleep for a long while. I was up at 11am (I set my alarm), but I woke up tired still, like I just didn't sleep enough.   Mom wasn't able to take me over to that spa place today (to put in an application), tomorrow is a maybe, but Friday I will definitely get there. I should've just gone up and did it on my own, but I didn't.  Instead, I watched TV and played around on the PC... same as yesterday. I'm pretty much a bum. Hopefully that'll change soon.   Jimmy just sent the setlists for this Saturday's gig to us tonight ( I  usually do them, but he wanted to do them this time out). I have two problems with it; firstly, there are only 7 originals in the sets (I usually include about 10), and secondly, we are starting off with a song that I'm always iffy on whenever we play it (and we haven't played it in a month or so). I also noticed that my song is missing from the setlists. There's only the one original song of mine that we do and it's not included, which is a bit disappointing to me.   I am really leaning towards quitting the band, and no, not because we're not doing my song this time, but because we're only doing one song of mine period. I have a ton of original music and I'm anxious to do something with it. They really don't utilize my music in this band at all, it's almost entirely JP's stuff. When I introduce my stuff at practice, it gets jammed on and then we move on to something else. I want to expand the music more and make it more unique. Unfortunately, I don't think it'll ever happen in this band.   Of course, I need to get a lot of other things done before I can seriously think about putting together my own band, including getting a job and a car.   *sigh*  I need to get off my ass.

        A Do-Nothing Day   I got out of bed around 10:30am this morning and spent most of the day watching TV and playing around on the PC (still checking out new music, same as yesterday). I did absolutely nothing productive at all today.   I  should have  taken a bus out to that spa place and put in an application, but me being a procrastinating moron and all, I did not do that. Mom said she should be able to take me over there tommorow afternoon, which is better for me anyway, since I'm not really sure where the place is or which bus stop to get off at, and besides, it's been hot as hell lately and I'd rather not show up all sweaty. Of course, I'm really just making excuses for my laziness (hey, at least I'm admitting it).   Later tonight, Mom ordered "Lord Of The Rings: Return Of The King" from Movies On Demand. I thought it was pretty good, especially the special effects, but some of the things that went on were hard to buy and then they went with a lot of standard Hollywood coventions throughout the film as well (for example, the bad guy who you only thought was dead, but comes back to attack the good guy one final time), which bothers me. It's hard to criticize the movie too much though, not having read the books. Maybe they were just sticking with what was written, you know? I'm looking forward to reading them soon though. I have two of them now, but I need the first book in the series to get started.   I've been trying to get to bed at 11pm every night, so I can be up by 9am, but I've been slipping for several days now. The movie didn't finish until after Midnight tonight, so I'm heading to bed late again tonight.   I guess it's ok for now, I'm getting up later than I'd like, but not  too  late, not like I had been. Besides, I'll be up late on Saturday for sure, since we're playing later at night and since it takes a long time to unwind afterward. I guess I'm going to go and take the trash out now, and then I'll be heading for bed.

        An Odd Day   I made a big pot of coffee for Mom and I last night, but I probably made it too late at night because I had a hard time falling asleep and was up several times to pee.   To make matters worse, Jimmy decided dawn was a good time to seek attention from me. He kept trying to get me to pet him, walked all over me several times, and purred right in my face. He's a good cat, but he's annoying as can be sometimes.    I wound up sleeping until about 11am, a couple hours later than I should be sleeping til. I got up, watched TV, ate lunch, and played around on the PC.   Man. I downloaded  a bunch  of songs today. There was a thread on FARK where FARKers listed their  urlLink top favorite 5 songs  and many of them I hadn't heard before, so I downloaded them. I found a few gems, like Radiohead's "The National Anthem", which is just amazing. When I get working again, that CD, "Kid A", is a "must-buy". UFO's "Love To Love" was pretty great too.   Regardless of all the goofing off, I managed to get a few things done today, nothing major though. I brought the trash cans in, did 2 loads of laundry, put the flea treatment on the cats, brought the mail in, helped Mom carry groceries in (after she got home), and cleaned the litter box.   One thing I'd hoped to do today, take a bus down the road to apply at this one company that is hiring, I didn't do. It looked like it was going to rain all day and I was still a bit tired from not sleeping well last night, so I put it off. I hope to get there tomorrow. They are hiring for machine operators, office help, and shop help, so I have a decent shot at getting in there somewhere. I just hope the hours and the pay are decent.   JP emailed me today. It looks like we're not going to practice until Friday now, but only for two hours instead of the usual three (this, after not playing at all since the last gig). I don't understand why they'd want to practice less, especially since we weren't very good last time.   JP also said that Jimmy wants to put the set list together this time, which is no big deal, but I thought we'd agreed to use the same set as last time with just a few changes (since hardly anyone saw us last time anyway). With just two hours practice between the last gig and this coming gig, I don't understand  why  they'd want to use a different set list. I mean, do we really need to throw in songs that we haven't practiced for a month or more when we did so poorly with songs that we  had  practiced?  I really don't understand these guys sometimes.   I don't understand myself sometimes either. I am broke, I'm already in debt to Mom and am due to get further in debt with her, yet... I'm still bidding on and winning auctions on eBay. Tonight, I won a Roy Orbison 4-cassette box set, still sealed, for just $6.50. I probably should have let it go, but it was too good a deal to pass up, even though I don't have the money to pay for it. Understand?   I won the set while Mom and I were watching TV tonight ("Fear Factor", "Everybody Loves Raymond", and "King Of Queens"). Mom nearly puked during "Fear Factor". She started gagging after she saw this one guy's face, right after he'd finished transferred hissing cockroaches from one container to another with his mouth. I guess he had some roach parts or feces or something all over his face and that set her off.    OK. I've written long enough (about nothing) for one night.   Which reminds me... the word counter on my Blogger profile says I've written nearly 300,000 words since I started my blog. Unfortunately, most of it's been me rambling about boring old nothing stuff (see above... and below).   So... I'm outta here.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  I listened to a few of the new tapes I picked up this weekend including tapes by Cruzados and The Innocents, which I'd never heard before. Not great, but not bad.    Watching on TV:  "World Poker Tour", "Celebrity Poker", "People's Court", "Judge Mathis", "Family Feud", "Fear Factor", "Everybody Loves Raymond", "King Of Queens", "The Daily Show", and various shows on the Discovery Channel and The History Channel.    Reading:  I've been reading an "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" collection of short stories most of the week. I'm about halfway through it.   Playing  "Age Of Empires 2". I love the game, but it always leaves my eyes sore.     Downloading:  Nothing this week.       Jamming:  No practice this week. We practice next Thursday and then we play out live next Saturday.    Working:  I applied online for the HSN job, but I'm really getting ansty about not working. I may go to Arbys (or elsewhere) tomorrow. I need money...  now .   Buying:  I have no money but that hasn't stopped my spending or my borrowing. I owe Mom $13 for the stuff I bought this weekend, and tonight, I won two more eBay auctions for cassette tape box sets. I got the Yes' "Yesyears" 4-tape set (still sealed, for $7), and Miles Davis' "The Columbia Years 1955-1985" 4-tape set (also sealed, for $6.50). Really, really good prices, especially on the Miles Davis collection, which I thought would surely go out of my price range.    Selling:  I sold three cards from my eBay store (for $3). I really do need to get off my ass and start stocking my store.    Eating:  This week, I continued eating too much of the wrong stuff. Omelettes with cheese in them, hot dogs and sauerkraut, chicken and cheese potato TV dinners, burritos, Chik-Fil-A sandwiches and fries, hamburgers and tater tots, chili and jalapeno poppers, steak and fries, steak and potatoes, BBQ chicken with cheese, rice and beans, etc... I ate fish, which is better for me, but then I put tartar sauce on it. I need to eat lighter and smaller portioned meals. I was doing well with that for awhile, but I slipped back into old habits lately. I had soda this week too. Mom bought some 2-liters too (Pepsi and Mountain Dew). I wish she hadn't.         Feeling:    Mentally, extremely worried about my finances. I'm anxious to get working.   Physically, my back and my right foot have been a bit sore. I had a toothache towards the end of the week, but it's gone away again (it comes and goes). My sinuses/allergies have been bad. I've had headaches and my left ear has been kind of sore too. I had energy one day this week, but the rest of the time I've felt lethargic.       Planning:  To get a job. To pay my bills. To play out next Saturday and not suck.

        Another Day, Another Shopping Spree   I stayed up late last night and slept in late today, until about 10:30am. I got up, I cooked up an omelette for "brunch", and then Mom and I watched a poker tournament on TV. By the time it ended, it was getting hot in the house so I suggested heading out.   I wanted to apply for a job at the Salvation Army store over in Pinellas Park, but after I got there, I totally changed my mind. I wasn't in the store but maybe three minutes before I started sweating my ass off. I also looked at the employees there and saw how the place was run and it seemed like a very unenjoyable place to work. So... no job still, but I did manage to find a few books to buy.   I got paperbacks of "Slapstick" by Kurt Vonnegut, "Thinner" by Stephen King (I have this one already, but it's falling apart), "The Two Towers" and "The Return Of The King" by J.R.R. Tolkien (I couldn't find the first book in the series though, dammit), "Cannery Row;' by John Steinbeck, "Nobody Ever Sees You Eat Tuna Fish" by David Brenner, and a hardcover of "The Regulators" by Richard Bachman (a.k.a. Stephen King). I already had a copy of this book home but the cover was torn up and this one looked like new.   From there we went to another Salvation Army store over in St.Pete. I found a couple more books there: Bill Flanagan's "A&R" in soft-cover (which got great reviews from both Elvis Costello and Tom Petty), and hardcovers of "How Few Remain" by Harry Turtledove (a Civil War novel) and "Pandora" by Anne Rice.   We headed over to Goodwill after that. They changed a lot since I was there last, with new shelving and the checkout area reconfigured. It took awhile to find the tapes, but I finally did and found six of them I wanted. I got: The Robert Cray Band "Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark", R.E.M. "Automatic For The People", U2 "The Unforgettable Fire", Eurythmics "Greatest Hits", Steve Perry "Street Talk", and the self-titled debut by Cruzados. I also found a few books too: Anne Rice's "The Tale Of The Body Thief" and "Heart Of Darkness & The Secret Shared" by Joseph Conrad (I belive this is the book "Apocalypse Now" was based on)in paperback, and a softcover guide to insects (with lots of pictures).   I was hoping to stumble upon a good sale on books today, but most were $1 each. I owe Mom $13 for the books and the tapes I got today. It definitely wasn't one of the best shopping sprees I've been on, usually I find much better deals than what I found today.   On the way home, we stopped at Chik-Fil-A and got some chow to take home. I liked my sandwiches much better today, without the butter on the buns. I don't know why they started that, but it's nasty.   So... I have even more stuff to read and to listen to now. I think I'll go watch TV... d'oh!

        A Very Nice Day, But No Job Progress   I got up around 9am this morning and watched TV with Mom until almost 1pm. Eventually, I got showered, shaved, dressed up, and was ready to go around 1:20pm.   Our first stop was Home Shopping, where I'd like to work. It took a while to figure out how to get in there and then after we'd figured it out, I found out that they no longer take applications in-person, only via the internet. Ugh! I was hoping to have some progress on the job front today, to alleviate some of the anxiety I have about my finances. Damn. I will have to fill out an online application this weekend. I want to try there before I apply anywhere else. It's the perfect job situation for me.   After that disappointment, we headed to my old job so JP could give me my share of the gig money from last weekend. I'd called ahead to make sure he'd be there, but he wasn't there when I arrived so I had to wait about 10-15 minutes for him to arrive. Unfortunately, Mom had to do her waiting out in the hot car. After JP finally got there, he paid me and I was off.   I paid Mom back what I owe her, though I'm going to owe her plenty in a few days (to cover some of my bills). I wish it were easier to find a good job. I really hate having to borrow from her.   From there we went to a pawn shop (nothing there), then on to Goodwill. Man. They had a shitload of good Monty Python and Python-related VHS videotapes there but they were asking more than I was willingh to pay (they were $3 to $5 each). They had about 4 or 5 "Monthy Python's Flying Circus" tapes, 2 "Ripping Yarns" tapes (Palin, and I think Jones as well), 3 "Fawlty Towers" tapes (Cleese), and 3 "Pole To Pole" tapes (Palin). If they had been $1 or $2 each, I'd have bought them all. I wound up not buying anything there.   We went down the road to Salvation Army and I found a shitload of good cassette tapes that I wanted, 24 of them. I couldn't believe how many good ones they had, and for just $0.49 each too! I bought:  April Wine "Nature Of The Beast", Alice Cooper "The Alice Cooper Show", Bob Dylan "Blood On The Tracks" and "Infidels" (I  never  find Dylan tapes in thrift stores), ELO "OLE ELO", The Fixx "Shuttered Room", Fleetwood Mac "Mirage", The Innocents "The Innocents" (I never heard of them, but it looked interesting), Jason And The Scorchers "Fervor", Billy Joel "The Stranger" (I wasn't sure if I had this or not, later I found out I did), John Cougar Mellencamp "Uh-Huh" (I had a crappy copy of this one already, this one was much better), Eddie Money "Eddie Money", The Motels "All Four One", Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers "Long After Dark", Bob Seger "Against The Wind", Rod Stewart "Absolutely Live", Tin Machine "Tin Machine", Pete Townshend "Rough Mix" (with Ronnie Lane), "Scoop", "Another Scoop", "All The Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes", Tommy Tutone "2", U2 "War", Joe Walsh "Ordinary Average Guy".  I also found a killer paperback book, a collection of Sherlock Holmes stories, for $1 as well. Sweet!   We stopped at Target after that and I bought that Lenny Kravitz EP, "Another Life" (a collection of rarities and B-sides), which is only available at Target. It cost $5.99, which left me broke again.   On the way home, we were talking about dinner and we wound up at Lone Star again. Man, oh man was that a great dinner. I had jalapeno poppers and a cup of chili rather than a salad and then I had a 14 oz. Texas Ribeye and fries for my main course. Holy shit! It was  so  good. After dinner I tried a Screaming Grasshopper, but I didn't like it much. Too much Vodka, not enough cream for my liking.   Mom bought dinner today, obviously. I hope I get working soon, because I liked it a lot when I could buy one week and she could buy the next. It worked out really well for us and we had a good time going out to eat every week.   I'll definitely fill out an application tonight or tomorrow night. I  should  get called in for an interview next week, hopefully. From there, I just need some really good luck and if I do get the job, it should be smooth sailing from there. If not, I go to Arbys and continue struggling to survive.

        Feelin' Pretty Good   For the first time in an awful long time, I woke up feeling pretty good. I was out of bed around 9am and spent a lot of the day playing around on the PC and watching TV. I also managed to do some more cleaning in my bedroom. Believe it or not, I  finally  folded the clothes that have been sitting in my room (in a clothesbasket) for weeks, months perhaps! My room is still a mess though. The problem is, I need more storage space and I have none. I either have to get rid of stuff or stack it up.   I called my friend Rob today and told him about the upcoming gig. He told me he missed the last one because he got dizzy right before he was supposed to leave. Ok. Hopefully he'll make the next one, if we're definitely on for it, which still hasn't been confirmed yet. He said his neighbor showed up at the last one, but I didn't see her there.   It was a little cooler in the house today... just a little. The skies would fluctuate between clear and overcast all day long, there was even thunder and lightning at one point, which looked promising, but alas, there was no rain. I wish it would rain soon, it's been too damned hot lately (in the 90's).  Tomorrow Mom is off and we're going to do some running around. I'm going to apply for a very good job tomorrow, and I may put in a few applications elsewhere too (I gotta get workin'). Wish me luck!

        Bring On The Rain   It's hot as a bitch in here. The thermostat in the hallway says it's 90 degrees in here (with the AC on). It's probably even hotter near the windows. Ugh! I can't wait until it starts raining in the afternoons again. Looking at my blog archives, it appears it was raining regularly this same time last year. Come on rain, any time now.   By 2pm-3pm every day, it gets so hot in here that I have to go cool off in my room with the light off and the fan on. I should go fill up my pool and hop in, but I think I'd feel kind of weird sitting out there in that giant pool all by myself (it takes up half the porch). As it is, I still haven't used it yet.  Instead of going back to my room to cool off today, I sat out in the living room sweating my ass off, watching our gig from last Saturday. I hooked up the vidocamera to the TV and watched what Mom taped. It wasn't as horrid as I thought it was, the mistakes and weak playing were there, but they weren't altogether noticeable. Some spots though... (shivers). I think we'll do better next time.    I spent most of the day today working on my PC. I've been having problems with it (not being able to run ScanDisk or to defrag) but today the Windows Media Player started crapping out on me, freezing up. I did a system restore and then Norton started crapping out on me. I had to un-install Norton, which allowed me to finally run ScanDisk and defrag, then I re-installed it and did system scans and whatnot. It found a bunch of trojan-infested files during one scan. I wonder why it didn't find them before? I think it might be that Norton just doesn't work well with Windows, because I can't run Scandisk or defrag again. I can't wait until I have the money to buy a new PC, I've about had it with this one.   I talked to JP again today. He said Jimmy's ok for July 3rd, but no word from Al yet. He also said there'd be no practice this week, just as I'd figured. Grrrr! We'll get to practice one day next week and then we play out on Saturday (as long as Al's in).   Speaking of Als, I won Al Franken's "You're Good Enough, You're Smart Enough, And Doggone It, People Like You" audiobook CD on eBay today. It's one of the funniest thing's I've ever heard in my life. His "Stuart Smalley" character takes you on a journey through the "dysfunctional forest", to meet your inner child. Of course, Stuart has major issues and everything that can go wrong with the recording of the journey, does. Brilliant satire. I've had a home-made recording for years, but over the weekend I won a sealed copy of the cassette tape version on eBay, and as I already mentioned, today I won the CD version. Sweet!  All I need now is some cool rain and I'm set.

        Stuff   I didn't sleep too well last night again (I got too cold), but I was up by 8:45am anyway. I guess I'm finally getting stabilized again.  This morning, Mom emailed me a couple of job leads she'd found, some looked promising. I guess I'm going to hold off on Arby's for now. She's off on Friday, so we'll probably run around a bit then. One job looks particularly sweet, especially the hours and the pay (6 hours a day, Noon-6pm, at $10 per hour), which are just perfect for me.   Later on today, after the heat started getting overbearing again, I hopped back in bed, with the fan blowing on me, and finished reading "The Mummy (Or Ramses The Damned)". My feelings about this book could be best summed up thusly: (doing my best "Chandler Bing" impression) "Could there have  been  more kissing?" Come on! I thought it was supposed to be a horror novel? Mummies? Hello?! Big-time chick book. I've read several of her books, and they all kicked ass. This was the only one (so far) that actually made me groan... so much kissing, so much talk about feelings... I need to go smoke a cigar and watch some kickboxing now, just to balance things out.   Well... it looks like we may have another gig lined up. Guess where? The same place I just said we'd probably never play again. Unreal. The manager there called JP and asked if we wanted to play on July 3rd (if Jimmy can do it, we're there), two hours (9:30pm - 12:30am), same pay agreement. JP went up there tonight and collected our pay from Saturday without hassle, so that's a good sign. Maybe the guy had a change of heart or maybe he was drunk on Saturday night, who knows. Regardless, I can certainly use the extra money.   It's raining now, so hopefully the house'll cool down some. I'm going to go have some dinner.

        Moving Forward, But Slowly   I was up at 9am this morning, even though I slept poorly all night long. I stayed up all day too, no napping, which is progress for me. I also shaved this afternoon too, and then later on, I went with Mom to get a haircut. I am presentable again. We stopped at Arby's and I got an application to fill out. I would've just filled out it there, but I didn't have my previous employment info on me (or memorized). All of this is definite progress, but it didn't actually get me anywhere; I am still without a job. I figure I'll turn in my application to Arby's sometime in the next couple days. There's another job I'm interested in, doing data entry, but I don't think I have much chance of getting that job. Depending on how freaking hot is is tomorrow, I may go there and apply anyway. We'll see.   I watched a movie today, "A Reason To Live, A Reason To Die", an old western with James Coburn and Telly Savalas... kind of cheesy, but entertaining enough. I also watched most of "2001: A Space Odyssey". Great movie. Even with a lot of thought and research, the ending still remains a mystery to me. But then, perhaps, that was the intention.   I finally got some tapes in the mail again. I miss that. I hand't had any good mail (read: "non-bills") for a while. My Ray Charles box set came in (the box was damaged but the tapes look great) and my 15-tape lot came in as well. Three of those tapes were unusable. Luckily, the main ones I wanted out of the lot were all good.   After dinner (I cooked steaks for Mom and I), we sat around watching TV all night ("Fear Factor", "Everybody Loves Raymond", "Celebrity Poker", and "King Of Queens"). I'm pretty darn tired now. I'm heading off to the bathroom, then straight to bed.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  I've mostly been listening to stuff that I'd downloaded: Wilco's "A Ghost Is Born", Joni Mitchell's "Blue", Patti Smith's "Horses", and stuff from David Bowie and Todd Rundgren. It's great to be able to discover new music, even if some of it is older music. You never hear any of that stuff on the radio, at least not in my area. I had on my Los Lobos "Good Morning Aztlan" CD before the gig last night.    Watching on TV:  "Celebrity Poker", "Trading Spaces", "The Howard Stern Show", "The Crocodile Hunter", "Late Night With Conan O'Brien", "People's Court", "Judge Mathis", and "King Of Queens", among others. I also watched a movie, "Gods And Generals".   Reading:  I finished a couple of books this week ("Everything's Eventual" and "Creature") and am currently reading "The Mummy/Ramses The Damned" by Anne Rice.     Playing  "Bow Man".    Downloading:  I downloaded a bunch of stuff off of Mojo Magazine's top 100 list that I'd never heard before: The New York Dolls, Patti Smith, Captain Beefheart, Joni Mitchell, Love, Can, Mary Margaret O'Hara, and Todd Rundgren. I'm definitely going to buy some Rundgren as soon as I start working again, same with the new Wiclo CD I downloaded.        Jamming:  We practiced on Wednesday and played out on Saturday... I'm not sure when we're playing together again.   Working:  No job yet, but I plan on moving on that this week.   Buying:  I won a few eBay auctions this week, all for tapes. I won a 7-tape Neil Young lot for $10, Al Franken's "I'm Good Enough, I'm Smart Enough, And Doggone It... People Like Me" audiobook (sealed) for $4.98, Bruce Springsteen's 3-tape live box set (sealed) for $6.50, and Ray Charles' 3-tape "The Birth Of Soul" box set $10.35. I probably should have held off on most of them, but I have very little self-control when it comes to buying stuff.    Selling:  Nothing.   Eating:  A lot more fast food than usual it seems. I've been drinking soda again too (Mountain Dew and Pepsi). On the upside, I have been eating smaller portions and haven't been overeating.       Feeling:    Mentally, I'm frustrated with my band situation and with my job situation.   Physically, my back and feet have been a bit sore all week. My sinuses/allergies haven't been great either.    Planning:  I plan on becoming employed again... soon!

        Lazy Day   I got out of bed around 10am today, which is an improvement for me. Unfortunately, getting up early was about the only productive thing I did all day.   All I did today was play around on the PC, eat, watch TV, eat, read, eat, and watch still more TV. Besides being a bit sleepy all day (I could have slept in much later than 10am), it was just too damn hot in here. I didn't feel like doing anything except sitting in front of a fan. Hopefully I'll get something done tomorrow, maybe get out and fill out an application or two.   Oh, I talked to JP last night and it sounds like there will be no practice this week since we played twice last week. I'm hoping the guys change their minds, because we really do need all the practice we can possibly get.  That shit is torture for me. I  need  to play as much as possible. The more I play, the better I get, and playing once a week just doesn't cut it. It looks like I'm just going to have to get my own thing going eventually, which means I'll either have to quit my current band outright or else treat it like a side project. I know now that a change is inevitable. As soon as I have my own transportation, I will start putting my band together. Maybe that's for the better.   Anyhoo... I'm heading to bed shortly. I'm really tired, so sleep should come easily tonight. I'm setting my alarm for 9:30am. I hope to get something done tomorrow. I can't afford not to have a job anymore.

        Bad Gig   I knew it. I knew I needed a nap, hell, I  tried  to take a nap a  few times  today, but each time, I was unable to fall asleep. It really hurt me later on.   Mom and I left here for the gig around 6:45pm. I'd showered, drank some wine, listened to some music, loaded my stuff in her car, and headed on to the show. After we got there, I loaded my stuff onstage, got set up and did a sound check. after that, we waited for people to show up. Very few did.   Earlier, I'd called my sister and my friend Rob, both said they were coming but neither did. My sister called us at the bar and said she got halfway there and had to turn back home because my brother-in-law started puking. She said she'd try to show up for the second set at least, but she never made it. It was very disappointing.   We probably only had about 10-15 of our people there. There were others there, but they were waiting for the heavy bands to come on. We waited for more people to show up, but by about 8:15pm, when it looked like no one else was coming, we went ahead on.   The first song went well, "Love The One You're With", then I came in a little late on "(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love & Understanding" and got lost on the first chorus. Next was "Something More", a JP original that turned out pretty well, then "The Middle" which was a little off, but not bad. Next was "Badge", which we had problems on. For some reason, I screwed up the bridge riff a few times (I'd never done that before), then JP blew the reprise at the end. He was supposed to start playing on the acoustic, but instead, he waited for me to start playing, which I finally figured out a little too late. It was pretty awkward. Next up was "Safe In My Arms". Al forgot the bass parts during my solo and it threw me off completely because I had no idea where he was going with it. After that we did "Hanging By A Moment", which was ok. "I Had A Girl" turned out very, very well. "Promise You The Moon" was ok, but I don't have the extended solo section worked out completely yet, so my leads there were a little weak. "Wild Night" was not very good. Al kept going to the wrong note during the choruses and Jimmy stuttered on the drums a bit. I blew a line or two on that one as well. "Stuck In The Middle" turned out really well, "Steal My Kisses" was really good, and we did alright on "Fell In Love With A Girl" as well.   We took a 5-10 minute break between sets (I sat with my Mom and JP's parents).   We only had about 30-40 minutes left, so we cut a few songs from the 2nd set. We played "Better", which was ok, but my solo was weak. "I'm Tore Down" turned out ok, but again, my soloing was pretty weak. "The Breakup Song" turned out pretty well too, but once again, my soloing was weak... see a pattern there? This is where my not having taken a nap became a factor. I felt like I had no energy at all. Between the tiredness I was feeling and the heat onstage, I was just zapped. Still, we went on. We did "Sleeping Forever", which was a bit shaky, but ok, "The Authority Song", which I started in the wrong key and had to re-start. I also blew the first part of the solo a bit. next we did "Come On Let's Go", which JP started flat, then "You May Be Right", which felt lifeless. I blew the end of the solo on it. We did "The House Is A-Rocking", which sounded too distorted. My soloing on it was pretty weak. We ended with "Feelin' Alright", and I blew some of my lead lines on it. For some odd reason, some of the crowd was cheering us on, asking for more.   Al was ready to get offstage, so was I, plus there was a band behind us waiting to get on. The manager-guy came up and said we could play two more songs, which we finally did. We did "Old Apartment", which turned out really well, and "Rock This Town", which did not. I was against playing it, I knew I didn't have the energy for it and I didn't, but we played it anyway. It was pretty fucking bad, but again, the crowd was shouting "one more".  The manager-guy was supposed to come up and thank us and set up the next band, but he was nowhere to be seen. It was really awkward up there, with the crowd asking for more and us not being sure if we could or should. We were over our timeslot by about 15-20 minutes and we all thought it wouldn't have been fair to keep going on, besides, all of us were pretty much done, so we packed it in and packed up. JP probably should have told the people what was going on, but didn't. Like I said, it was really awkward.   After we were packed up and ready to, it was time to collect our pay. As usual, we had to chase the manager-guy down and then we had to wait for him. I told him my Mom was waiting for me in the car and JP told him his pregnant wife was sick (she puked in the parking lot), but the guy took his sweet-ass time. Finally, he came over only to tell us that the registers were down, all the terminals were frozen and he wouldn't be able to pay us tonight. What a load of shit. To make matters worse, he asked JP how much we wanted for the night. He already had an agreement with us for $200, or $250 if we brought in 40 people, and JP reminded him of that, but then he said he'd hoped we'd work with him on it. What a dick. It doesn't look like we're going to play there again. He stuck us there on heavy, heavy metal night and now he's trying to weasel out of paying us what he owes us. Total dick move. JP is going back there on Tuesday, to collect our $200 and to let him know what is what. Very disappointing night.   Between the time we finished packing up and the time we talked to the manager-weasel, me, JP, and his wife sat around talking about the band, the direction we're heading, and basically, our futures in the band.   I think JP's wife continually reminds him that the band is just a hobby, that it's not a career, and that it never could be. However, JP's music  is  good enough to take him places, I know it, he knows it, the rest of the band knows it, and pretty much everyone who's heard his music seems to know it too. I just don't think his wife does, and she even told him once, right in front of me, that he has a "slim to none" chance of ever making it. Man. There is no way I could stand to be with a woman who was so unsupportive of something as important to me as my music. It's not that she's necessarily unsupportive, she goes to gigs and helps out sometimes, but she doesn't seem to  believe  in his music nor in his talent, and that's unfortunate.   Anyway, it looks now like we're going to focus on making a decent demo to send out. Other than giving us some extra playing time, the gigs we're getting aren't doing anything for us, not in The Big Picture. We don't seem to be getting much of a following, we're basically playing to the same people all the time, when they bother to show up, that is. Frankly, since the other guys can only play about 3 gigs a month, it isnt likely we'd ever get a real following from playing out. Making a demo and sending it out to people who can do something with it seems like more logical to me. I'm sure we'll still play out for fun and money, but we'll probably start playing places that have their own crowds, where we aren't responsible for supplying a crowd, like tonight.    What a crappy night.

        Pre-Show Activity   I didn't sleep very well last night. I was awake in bed most of the night and I was up and down a few times to pee, as well. By 8am, I knew I wasn't going to be able fall back asleep and I didn't. I had set my alarm for 10am... wishful thinking.   I am pretty tired right now. I tried to nap a couple of times earlier today, but that hasn't worked out too well for me. I have got to nap sometime soon or I'll be dragging ass onstage tonight.   I still don't know if my sister is coming or not. I talked to her last night and today trying to get her to go. She said she didn't have the extra money, like she couldn't just go to support me, she has to have a reason to go (to drink). I told her I'd give her some money (for her birthday) and she'd get in for free anyway, so who knows what's going to happen. I've also asked her twice to call her brother-in-law and invite him along, but she hadn't done that yet either. He liked us a lot when he and his wife saw us play before (and we're even tighter now).   Earlier this afternoon, I did an equipment check and set the levels on my amp and effects pedals. I also made some notes about some of the songs we're a litle iffy on, so we can go over them before we play. Right now, I am listening to last week's practice tape. A couple of the solos I played last week were keepers, so I need to keep them fresh in my mind.   Man. It's hot as fuck in here right now. It's over 85 degrees in the house  with the AC cranked ! Ugh! I think it might be a good time to go lie under a cool fan and try to take a nap. I'll need to be up by 5:30pm though, so I can shower get packed up and get to the gig by 7pm. I'll probably just grab dinner on the way home from the show.   So... that's the plan.

        Waiting To Sleep   I got up around 2:30am yesterday and, except for the three hours I laid down for a nap this afternoon (I think I got maybe an hour, hour and a half, of sleep), I've stayed up all day. I'm tired as hell, have been ever since I got up from my nap, which was really hard to do (once I finally got to sleep, I didn't want to get back up). I'm going to bed in a few minutes and hope to be on my way to a normal sleep pattern once again.   That is, if I don't screw it up tomorrow night. It's always hard to get to sleep after a gig. I stay up for hours with the music going through my head, thinking about mistakes I'd made or about how doing this or that would make the song better... it's hard to get my mind settled down to the point where I can relax and fall asleep. If I can manage to get to sleep by 2am (our set lasts until 10pm), I should be able to get up around 9am or 10am Sunday morning and that would put me right about where I need to be, sleepwise.   I'd like to go out and get a haircut Sunday afternoon, so I can start looking for work on Monday. I also need to shave too (I have a beard going again). Tuesday, I'm going to go buy the new Wilco CD and I might buy the new Patti Scialfa CD too (it comes with a bonus disc).   If I can get a job and get working this week, I should be okay come the first week of July, when I get hit the hardest with bills, and if I'm ok then, I should be ok for a long while thereafter (which would alleviate a lot of worries for me).   They say that a journey of 1,000 miles begins with just a single step, and I'm hoping that going to bed right now is my first step on a new journey, towards a happier existence.  Goodnight.

        A Ghost Is Born   I just discovered that Wilco has a new album coming out (next Tuesday)! It's called "A Ghost Is Born". Even better than discovering that they have a new album coming is getting to  urlLink listen to it for free .  I don't know how long the link will be good for, but you can listen to the whole album on Wilco's website and it.. is..  awesome . A great album.   It's a lot more bare bones than their last album, more raw, sparse. Some of it reminds me of old Neil Young, The Band, and John Lennon, but mostly it's pure Wilco. This is a must-buy CD for me. Good thing our gig tomorrow night is a paying gig.   Which reminds me...  I just found out that all of the bands that follow tomorrow night are really hard and heavy. Our crowd is going to clear the hell out of there in a hurry. I don't know why he booked us with that lot, it's a really bad fit.

        Up Too Early... Again   I'm trying to get my sleep patterns normalized again, but I'm not having much luck. This last week has been absolutely insane. One day I'm up at 10pm, the next around 4pm, then 12:30pm, then 8:30am, then 8pm, then 1:30pm, then 2:30am... I'm all over the freakin' place!    The last time noted, 2:30am, was tonight (this morning?). I only made it until about 6pm yesterday before I fell asleep (while reading Anne Rice's "The Mummy... Or Ramses The Damned"). Around 2:30am, I got up, ate (more a dinner than a breakfast) and watched "Beavis & Butthead" for awhile. I'm going to try and go back to bed again shortly.   I would like to be up around 9am everyday, which means I need to be going to bed around 11pm (if I'm going to read a little) or Midnight. I'm not having much success, but I'm working on it.

        Another Sleepless Night   Around 2am this morning, I started getting tired, but because I'm a moron, I stayed up playing on the PC and watching TV until about 3:30am.   Then, instead of just going to bed, I laid down and started reading a new book, "Creature" by John Saul. Because I'm a special kind of moron, I proceeded to read  the entire book  . I finished it about 45 minutes ago.   It was an ok book, certainly not worth losing a night's sleep over. It started off really strong, kept me interested, but towards the end, it started getting just a bit too hokey for me, and inconsistent. I don't think I'd recommend it to anyone.  I feel like crap. Besides being tired as hell, I have a sore lower back (probably from the way I was laying in bed, reading) and I'm starting to get an upset stomach again too.   Last night, shortly after I got home from practice, I started getting cold sweats, like I was going to puke. I also felt The Big D coming on. It's a always a tricky situation when you have to contend with both ends at once. I sat down on the toilet, turned the fan on me, took my shirt off, and after a while, the cold sweats and the nausea went away. Whew! A potential disaster, averted.  Man. I really need to stay up until Midnight tonight, so I can get up at a decent hour on Friday. Mom is off on Fridays now (she's on her Summer schedule) and can take me around job hunting, but as screwed up as my sleep schedule has been this week, it's pretty unlikely that I'll be up or in any condition to go out. I'll probably be in bed by 6pm tonight, which does me no good at all. Ugh!  I still have to call my friend Rob today too, to let him know about the gig on Saturday. I should have called him days ago, but between my weird hours of late and my not wanting to be attached to the phone for hours, I just haven't done it. Phone calls to him are usually a huge hassle and they last way too long. I really don't care to deal with that right now.   I'm just too damned tired.

        Practice Night   I didn't get up until about 1:30pm this afternoon, later than I'd hoped. I had a lot of trouble getting to sleep after I'd gone to bed (for the second time) last night.  I watched TV and downloaded music for most of the afternoon (I finally got to hear some early Todd Rundgren... awesomeness), then I showered and got ready for practice.  I knew we had a lot to do tonight (running through both sets and working on a couple of the songs) so I was hoping we'd get right to business, but that didn't happen. The other guys talked and smoked and whatnot before getting ready to play.   I played by myself for awhile, then finally JP got up and started playing some 2-chord progression and I started improvising some melodies over it. Eventually, Al and Jimmy joined in and then JP started coming up with some words for it while we played. It was really nice, very mellow, and the band sounded really good playing together on it too, with all four parts coming together nicely. Like I told JP tonight, if we played together 4 days a week instead of 4 days a month, we'd be one hell of a band.   After that, we worked on the two newest originals, "Safe In My Arms" and "Better", trying to tighten them up some more. I think we'll be ok on them Saturday night, but they both could use some fine tuning.   We also ran through all of set 1 and about half of set 2, making adjustments here and there as we went along. Al and JP wanted to make a few changes to the setlets too, so we worked on that after practice. Here are the setlists for Saturday as they stand right now:  Set 1: "Love The One You're With", "(What's So Funny 'Bout)Peace, Love & Understanding", "Something More", "The Middle", "Badge", "Safe In My Arms", "Hanging By A Moment", "I Had A Girl", "Promise You The Moon", "Wild Night", "Stuck In The Middle", "Steal My Kisses", "Fell In Love With A Girl", and "Opportunity Knocks".  Set 2: "Better", "I'm Tore Down", "The Breakup Song", "Circle", "Sleeping Forever", "The Authority Song", "I Got Loaded", "Free Spirit", "Come On Let's Go", "You May be Right", "Should I Stay Or Should I Go", "The House Is A-Rocking", and "Feelin' Alright".   It's a pretty good mix. It should be a really good show (a fun one, anyway).  By the way, JP told me tonight that Santana's band, The St. Pete Project (who we used to play with), got booked for a really good gig. They won't be getting paid, but they will be opening for  Cheap Trick ! Those lucky bastards. Too bad Santana's band doesn't have any originals, because, pay or not, it'd be some great exposure (not to mention the whole Cheap Trick deal).

        The Sleep Misery Continues   I only made it until somewhere around 5pm on Tuesday before I just had to go to sleep. I didn't sleep long though. By 8pm, I was out of bed.  That  didn't last long either, because I crashed out on the couch around 8:30pm and slept off and on for the next two hours or so. I played around on the PC for several hours, half-watching TV, before going back to bed again, somewhere around 2am. I finished reading "Everything's Eventual" and tried to fall asleep, but here I am, back out of bed yet again.   I plan on calling Arbys tomorrow, to see if they have any positions available. I need a job, and fast. I can always look around for a better job later... if I can find the time.   Or if I  have  the time.   Time feels like it's running out for me. I don't know what it is, but I have a great sense of impending doom... or a feeling of great failure. Whatever it is, I feel an urgency to it, like I just don't have the time left to do all that needs to be done.  You know, I was saved from death a couple of times in life. I lived through a ferocious tornado that killed 3 kids not 80 feet away from where I was when it hit (in fact, I saw one of those kids in the bathroom just minutes before he died). Later in life, I walked in on an armed robber just moments after he shot a co-worker of mine between the eyes. I quickly escaped and I almost ran out the back door for help, but I had a bad feeling that there was someone waiting for me back there (I'd seen a strange car pull up in the back parking lot not long before the shooting), and in fact, as the police later confirmed, the robber's partner  was  out there, waiting.   I have been spared an early departure several times in my life and sometimes I feel like I've done absolutely nothing to merit my reprieves... and maybe next time I won't be so lucky.   Maybe I'm just depressed still, I don't know.   Why is it so hard to be happy?  *sigh*  I guess I'm going to try and go to sleep again; hopefully I'll be up by Noon.

        Screwed Up... Still   I  thought  I was getting back on track, at least I'd been getting up earlier, but I really blew it last night.   I went to bed around 2am, after watching "The Three Stooges" bio-pic. I was too tired to read and tried to go right to sleep. Somehow, I managed not to sleep at all.   It looks like Mom fucked around with the thermostat again, turned it up, which made it too humid in my room. I think she must've done that the day before, when I was only able to get a couple hours sleep.   Around 4am, I finally got up and read some. I pet Jimmy awhile (he's been coming into my room at night lately), and then cleaned my room a little. Around 5:30am, I went out to the living room and watched TV.   I watched "Gods And Generals", a very good movie, but also a very long one (it just finished a little after 10am). I wish they had better special effects in this one, too many cannon explosions, not enough blood. The acting and scenery and everything else was great, but the violence just wasn't realistic enough. With the Civil War, the injuries were just so nasty, the fallen must have been in a world of pain, but you don't get that from this movie; as soon as someone gets hit, they seem to drop dead instantly... basically the same thing you'd see at a re-enactment. You don't get the scope of the suffering the injured went through. If it had been shot more like the battle scenes in "Saving Private Ryan", it definitely would have had a much bigger impact on me. I think depicting just how brutal it was only goes to show just how brave those soldiers really were, because they knew what they faced everytime they marched into battle. "Gettysburg" was more honest in that sense.    So...   I'm on my second huge cup of coffee now. I have to try and stay up as long as possible... again. Obviously, no job hunting today, dammit. The way I feel right now, I might be able to make it until 9 or 10pm, but that can change at any time. I should try and get something done today, before I start getting too tired to stay up. I don't know how many times I've said that, or been in this position.   This shit is getting old.

        Mixed-Up Days & Nights   The last three days, I've gotten up @10pm, @4pm, @12:30pm, and today, @8:30am. I'm all over the place! I'm not getting into any set sleep pattern; I just go to bed when I go to bed and get up whenever I get up.   I'm a mess.   Last night, I went to bed around 2am (after putting together the set lists for our Saturday gig). I read in bed for awhile, fell asleep for awhile, but then I was up by 8:30am. That's just not enough sleep.   I took a nap yesterday afternoon, a long one, so that might be the reason I slept so little last night. That, plus I had/have a headache that won't go away.   I need to try and stay up all day today, I certainly have enough stuff to do around the house to keep me busy, but it's supposed to rain again this afternoon and I'm pretty tired, so who knows, I may wind up napping again.   Hopefully, I can get into a normal sleep pattern within this week and then I can start job hunting. I need to get some money coming in... as soon as possible.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  I really haven't listened to anything all week. I've been too busy sleeping, reading, or watching TV.   Watching on TV:  "The World Series Of Poker", "Trading Spaces", "The Sherlock Holmes Mysteries", "The Howard Stern Show", "The Crocodile Hunter Diaries", "Judge Judy", and bits and pieces of a lot of my usual shows and various documentaries on The History Channel and The Science Channel. I also watched a couple of movies, "1984" and "House Of 1,000 Coprses", which was a pretty strange movie.   Reading:  I finished a couple of books this week, and I just started reading Stephen King's "Everything's Eventual" last night.    Playing  "Grand Theft Auto 2" and "Bow Man".    Downloading:  I downloaded some stuff from Velvet Revolver, but wasn't real impressed with anything I heard. I was hoping it would sound a lot like STP or GNG, but it really didn't sound much like either band.      Jamming:  We practiced on Wednesday, a good practice. We do it again next Wednesday, then we have a gig on that Saturday.     Working:  I need to get back to being a day person before I can start looking for a day job, which I finally realized I had to have. Even though I really don't want another fast food job on my resume, I may apply at Arby's, or some other restaurant that doesn't serve breakfast, so I won't have to be up too early. By the way, it looks like I''ve been turned down for unemployment benefits, though I'm not sure why. I think they might've made a mistake.    Buying:  I bought some Fiji waters and some jumbo Hersehy bars at Walgreens earlier in the week and I won an eBay auction for the cassette version of Ray Charles' "The Birth Of Soul" box set. I will have to pay $10.35 for it, which is a little more than I'd normally pay for used tapes, but I took a gamble on it. The seller had listed "St. Petersburg" as their location and I thought I could pick it up in person and save myself $5 in shipping costs, but unfortunately, they live much further away than St. Pete. I used to have the CD version of the set in my collection, but I lost it, along with a whole bunch of my best CDs, to a pawn shop, many moons ago.    Selling:  Nothing.   Eating:  A lot more fast food than usual. Mom hasn't been cooking much lately. We had steak hoagies tonight, I had McNuggets and pasta salad yesterday and today, and we had burgers from Checkers and Burger King this past week too. Burgers at home too. I'm about sick of burgers. I've also been snacking on Hershey bars while I read in bed, but I think I'm starting to get sick of those too.     Feeling:    Mentally, I'm worried about my finances. I don't have any money to put on my laid-away guitar this month and I will squeak by with everything else, but I need $173 on July 5th to pay my bank loan and I still have $500 to pay on my guitar, which should be paid off in early July. I'm in a fix.    Physically, my back has been a little sore. I think I strained it a little carrying my equipment out to JP's car the other night. My sinuses/allergies have been bad all week as well, headaches just about every damned day. My feet have also been acting weird, having spasms and stuff. Ahhh... the joy of aging.       Planning:  I need to get back on day hours so I can go get myself a crappy, low-paying job with no benefits whatsoever. Ahhh... the joy of slaving for our corporate masters.

        Late Night/Early Morning Ramblings   I'm still up. I went to bed with a book ("Red Dragon") sometime around 9pm. I finished the book around 3:30am, but by then I had a major headache and then I started thinking about my life and getting a job and paying my bills and such and decided to get up.    The book wasn't as good as I'd hoped, but it held my interest most of the way through. My main problem with it is that the author built the main investigator up to be somewhat of a phenom and he really didn't do much of anything throughout the story. His one big discovery was revealed much earlier to the reader, so it was no surprise at all, very anti-climactic. I also thought it was annoying that the front cover is taken up with Hannibal Lechter's face (the face of Anthony Hopkins) and he's barely in the book at all.      I took 3 Aleves for my headache. So far, it's still here, still aching.    Besides typing this, I'm watching "Wild Boyz" on MTV. It's some of the guys from Jackass. They certainly have a lot of balls to do some of the stuff they do, but I can't help but wonder if some of them are a couple beers short of a 6-pack.  That new Gene Simmons solo album seems like the audio equivalent of a huge, steaming pile of shit.   My sister's birthday was yesterday. Mom had talked about going up, but then later she said she didn't feel like it. I don't have any money left to buy her anything anyhow. I'll make it up to her when she comes down for my next gig (in a little over a week).   I'm really starting to worry about my finances and getting a job. I really don't want another day job, but I need to have my nights open for my music. I'd like to work for myself, but I don't know if I'd have any success with that or not, and with no income coming in, it'd be a hell of a gamble, one I couldn't afford to lose. I'm so mixed-up and confused right now, it's not even funny. So many choices, so little time.   In the meantime, I need to start working on the set list for our next gig. I'm going to throw a bunch of our newer material in there, most of our more upbeat stuff, and as many originals as I can. It should be a great gig, lots of fun.   I really need to start finishing more of my own songs, and soon. It's really starting to bother me. I have so much material sitting around here, on tapes and in my mind, but without lyrics, they stay shelved, unheard. The guys in my band seem to like my stuff when I bring out at practices, I just have to put my mind to working on it, no more excuses.   The sky is starting to lighten up. I should have been sleeping hours ago. If I go to bed now, I'll be up too late in the day to get anything done. No job hunting, no nothing. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm lost.

        We Lost Another Great One   And I'm not talking about that bastard, Reagan. I'm talking about the great Ray Charles. I just heard that he'd passed away last Thursday. What a huge loss. He's one of those guys, like Johnny Cash, that you wish could live forever, so that generations and generations could be a witness to their talent, their genius. He was more than a great musician, he was a national treasure. Sadly, we no longer have the man, but luckily we still have his music. I would highly recommend his box set to anyone, it's called "The Birth Of Soul" and it's absolutely brilliant. Thank you, Brother Ray.

        Band Practice   I took a nap around 3pm today, or tired to anyway. I just couldn't sleep, my mind wouldn't stop racing, but I guess I got enough of a rest because I played alright tonight.   We started off the night jamming on a new song I started today (funky Doobie Brothers-like riff in A) and it sounded prety good once everyone got going. As per usual, no lyrics yet. I started some, just to get a melody down, but they kind of suck.   We jammed on my "Safe In My Arms" for awhile too. JP played some lead on it, embellishments, and it sounded pretty good too. I kept waiting for him to start singing, but he never did, which was weird. Later he wanted to play this song, not realizing that we already had. He had no idea what song we'd jammed on!   We wound up working on this one a lot. Now, we are using the bridge music as an independant solo section. We made it a little funkier too. We still need to figure out how to get from the solo back to the last verse. I almost had it, but we moved on to something else.   We worked on "Better" too, trying to get the chorus part to sound right. It always sounds too cluttered or too forced or something. I think we have it now... sort of.   We also worked on Steve Miller's "Rock N Me", but it looks like the key it's in is out of JP's range so we had to move it from E to A, which kind of screws up the bass and guitar parts. We had to try and figure out where to play everything again.    We also ran through "Fell In Love With A Girl", "I Got Loaded", "The House Is A-Rockin", "The Breakup Song", and "Come On Let's Go". We spent time tweaking most of them. It was a very productive night, but we also jammed a bit too, and we even rehashed an old song of JP's called "Free Spirit", which we hadn't played for about a year. We didn't do too bad with it. We'll probably put it back in our repertoire since it's fairly upbeat and we need all the upbeat songs we can get.  Which reminds me... the guy from the club we've been playing about once a month finally called JP back. It looks like we're on for the 19th, from 8pm to 10pm. Santana's band might even be playing there that night too, which would be really cool, but I'm not counting on it.    A little after I got home tonight, Mom ran me to Walgreens and I bought some more Fiji water and some more jumbo Hershey bars (with almonds). I'm set now!

        The Too-Early Bird   Well... I didn't make it until 10pm last night. Instead, I went on to bed sometime around 5:30pm and forced myself to stay in bed as long as I could, until sometime around 4:30am, when I finally got up again.  I hate being an "early bird", I'm much more comfortable being a "night owl". If it wasn't for having to look for a stinking job, I'd still be up all night long, semi-happy.  This morning, I watched "1984" (finally), made coffee for Mom and I, made breakfast for myself (a mushroom/cheddar omelette), did some laundry, and helped JP bring his equipment in.   He said he still hasn't gotten a call back about our upcoming gig this month. It seems like the guy is ducking us. Maybe he gave our slot to another band or something. Very strange. Besides the exposure, I could certainly use the money from playing out, that's for sure.  Speaking of money, I still don't know what I should do about work. I need to find something close by or on a direct bus route, someplace I wouldn't have to dress up too much for, someplace that pays decent wages, where I wouldn't have to do a lot of heavy lifting, and where I wouldn't have to be in too early or leave too late. I'm really limited in options.   I keep thinking about starting up something of my own instead. I'm really sick of working for people, most of the folks I've worked for have been total assholes, and I think I have enough stuff here I could sell. There's an indoor flea market down the road here and it would only cost me $149 a month to sell there (five days a week). I could bring in basketball cards and cassette tapes and books and whatnot and see how I do. It might be profitable, or it might not. I guess there's only one way to find out for sure. I just wish I had the $149, so I could try it. I might just list a bunch of stuff on eBay and try to raise it.  In the mean time, I need a nap. I'm really tired for some reason. I'd better take a nap this afternoon sometime so I'm not totally useless at band practice tonight.

        Up   I went to bed with a book, "The Stranger" by Albert Camus, sometime around 2am this morning. By 5:30am, I'd finished the book. I read the entire book in about three and a half hours. Very unique style of writing, but more importantly, a very unique philosophy behind the writing. Sometimes the apathy of the main character was almost too much, but by the end of the story, the apathy seemed almost sensible. It's basically a tragedy, but I found the truth and honesty in it quite uplifting.  One very surprising thing I found in this book was a familar-sounding line "it's better to burn than it is to disappear". Obviously, Neil Young borrowed from Camus when he sang "it's better to burn out/than to fade away"... cool!  So... I'm still up. I guess I'm going to try and stay up all day. I need to get back on a day schedule again anyhow (to find a job). I may shave my head today too. I need to shave my face, at the very least (it's getting itchy) and I desperately need a shower (I stink). It's been getting hot in the house everyday (even with the air on it's up in the 80's), so I've been sweating a lot more than usual.   I'm pretty tired right now, I hope I can make it until 11pm, but I probably won't.

        A Voice From The Past   I received a phone call tonight from someone I thought I might never hear from again: my old friend Scott.   I hadn't heard from him for a couple of years now. The last time I saw him, we were supposed to get together to go see JP's band play out, which was long before I joined JP's band. He never called me back about it, never showed up to pick me up, and seemed to have disappeared altogether, never to be heard from again.   Until tonight.   He's living in Michigan again (in the past few years, he's lived there, Tennessee and Mississippi), recently re-married (to Jill), and has a new child on the way (a boy, due in October).   The most surprising news, however, is that he got his stolen Les Paul gold top back after it had been missing for two years. He just happened upon it in a guitar shop one day, hanging on a wall. It surprisd the shit out of him, to say the least.   He'd had that guitar ever since we were teenagers and when it got stolen, he pretty much gave up playing (losing it had broken his spirit). I'm really glad he got it back. Him without his Gibson is like the Yin without the Yang.    He said he started playing again too. He was one of the guys that taught me a lot of guitar stuff when I was first starting out, all the basics. Even though his style was always more Heavy Metal and Thrash than me, we used to jam together quite often, usually with me on guitar and him on drums (back in the old abandoned pawn shop). Those were good times.    After his first marriage broke up, I was secretly hoping he'd come back and offer to drum or play bass for me, to help me get my own band going. Of course, that never happened.   I guess it never will, now that he's officially re-joined the ranks of "those who've settled down".   I'm the last of my group not to have gone that route, but I think I could have gone down that road if I had found someone who loved me. That also never happened.  I'm glad he's doing well and is happy, but for whatever reason, his happiness sort of amplifies my sadness. When I look back on the last 20 years of my life and see how little I've done, how littel I've progressed... it's just pathetic.   For a long time, I'd just given up entirely (too many heartbreaks, too much sorrow), but I've slowly been getting back on my feet again (really slowly).   Hopefully, I'm just a late bloomer. Hopefully, I'll make up for all of those wasted years eventually. I feel like I'm ready and waiting to come alive, like a butterfly who's been in the cocoon to long, but I also feel like I can't do it without a helping hand. I think thay call that being "co-dependent". I know what it is, but I can't stop feeling that way. Lonliness is a drag.  All in all, it was still good to hear from Scott again.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  I played Rush's "Chronicles" 2-tape set while Jess and I played darts. That's about all the music I've listened to this week.   Watching on TV:  I watched a handful of movies this week (with Jess): "Jackass: The Movie", "The Master Of the Flying Guillotine", "The Fugitive", "Southern Comfort" and half of "Jaws". I also watched these TV shows this week: "The Sherlock Holmes Mysteries", "Beavis & Butthead", "Ren & Stimpy", "Judge Judy", "The Simpsons", "Home Improvement", "Everybody Loves Raymond", "King Of Queens", and bits and pieces of various other shows. Tonight, I watched the season finale of "The Sopranos". Good episode, but I wish it would've been a bit longer.    Reading:  I finished reading "Night Shift" this week, and I started reading "Firestarter" (both are Stephen King books). I'm almost done with "Firestarter". It's a really good book. "Night Shift" was ok, kind of hokey in places.    Playing:  "Grand Theft Auto 2", "Beach Head 2002", and "Bow Man".    Downloading:  Nothing.   Jamming:  We didn't practice at all this week and I haven't even picked up mu guitar since our last gig. Not good.    Working:  No job yet, but I really haven't started looking yet either. I plan on starting this week after I put in for my unemployment insurance.    Buying:  I bought a bunch of stuff all week, mostly junk food for my nephews and I: Donuts, milks, Slurpees, candy bars, a swimming pool, a mini-air compressor, ice creams, water, cream sodas, wine, underwears, hot dog, etc... way too much stuff.    Selling:  Still nothing.   Eating:  A lot of junk food this week, and sodas too. I hadn't bought soda for ages. I usually stay away from it whenever possible.    Feeling:    Mentally, I feel like my Summer is over, before it even began. I had my fun with my nephews and now I feel like I need to get serious about finding a new job.   Physically, not too well the last few days. My allergies/sinuses had been going crazy, which caused my ears to get sore, which gave me some monster headaches. I've been in bed pretty much all weekend (see post below).    Planning:  I need to take care of my unemployment insurance, then I need to find a job. I also need to get a haircut and play my guitar.

        Slumberjack   Holy crap. I went to bed around 10:30pm last night and I just got out of bed about 5 minutes ago... over 13 hours in bed. And it's not like I was out of bed much yesterday either.  I stayed up until Noon reading "Firestarter" (only about 5 pages left to go) and dealing with my sinus/allergy problems. I got back up around 7:30pm and then, as I already mentioned, I was back in bed sometime around 10:30pm.   My ears are really sore now, from all the nose-blowing I did Saturday morning. Of course, I can't afford to go to the doctor's or anything. I may be back in bed before long.   I really don't feel very well, and it's not just my ears. I have an upset stomach too and I feel tired and sore all over.

        A Day Of Rest   I thought I was going to going to bed early last night, but that didn't happen. Instead, I stayed up playing "Grand Theft Auto 2" on my PC and then I went to bed, grabbed a book to read, and read until almost 7am.    The book was Stephen King's "Firestarter". I don't remember liking the movie very much (I saw it a long, long time ago), but so far, the book is pretty darn good.   I stayed in bed until after 4pm today; I was in no hurry to get up. My fan felt nice and cool and the blankets felt nice and warm; I was really comfy.  Both of the cats were sleeping at my feet, so the first thing I did after waking up was give them some attention. I hadn't had much chance to pet them or play with them in the last several days (since I was spending all my time with my nephews).   I spent most of the day today on my PC. In fact, I spent about five hours just playing "Grand Theft Auto 2".    In spite of all the time I spent on it, I'm really hating my computer... with a passion. It keeps dragging and slowing down when I play games or when I try to download things, or when I'm listening to music on it and then open up a page or try to download something, the music starts breaking up. It's like it has no memory to spare, which can't be the case because I bought and installed extra memory in it a long time ago (it has 319 MB of RAM). I haven't checked, but maybe another capicitor blew. It's not like I can do anything about it right now anyhow; my warranty expired and I'm broke. It's really frustrating. I need a high-power, hi-speed computer that can keep up with me. As soon as I start working again and as soon as my bills are caught up, I am going to buy myself a new computer... and it will not be a Gateway PC this time.   I'm guess I'm going to go to bed now and read some more. If only I had me a big ol' Hershey bar (with almonds) to munch on while I read... man, am I jonesing for one of those bad boys right now! D'oh!

        All Gone   I didn't get to sleep until around 9am this morning. I wasn't sure if I was going to stay up all day or go to sleep. After I finished reading my book, I finally decided it'd be better to go ahead and go to "sleep".  I had Mom wake me up at 3pm today (she stayed home again). I got up, showered, and we headed out to my old job to pick up my paycheck.  The boys went up with me and got to see JP for a few minutes. It was his birthday today. I alwyas forget, every year. For some reason, I always think it's on the 6th, when it's actually on the 3rd.    After we left there, we went to the bank and I deposited most of my check (moneywise, I should be ok for the rest of the month), then we stopped over at Missing Links and I bought everyone ice cream/shakes. I had a hot dog there too (everyone else had eaten already).   We stopped off at Walgreens on the way home, then we came home and Jess and I set up the Slip & Slide. He and Austin did that for awhile, Austin was having a blast, but Jess was being jerky about it. He wouldn't take off the long jeans shorts he was wearing, which prevented him from sliding well. He kept landing badly and getting hurt, but he just wouldn't take the damned things off. Instead, he got aggravated because we kept telling him to take them off, then he went off and pouted until he finally decided to come back over.   Mom borrowed an air compressor from a friend of hers and sat out on the porch pumping up my pool until she got bored. It's  still  not pumped up and usable yet.  Sean, the kid at the end of the street who almost always comes over when we're doing fun stuff outdoors, came over and wanted to slide too. I had him ask his mother for permission first. He played awhile and had fun with Austin.   My sister was heading over to pick the boys up around 7-7:30pm, so I had to pack the Slip & Slide up and bring Austin inside to change clothes and clean up. Jess had showered already.   After their Mom arrived, they all ate supper here (Mom and I waited) and then they got packed up and went home. Austin was getting hyper again and started getting on everyone's nerves. He'd been fairly good all week, both of them actually. I told them they could stay down longer, but they wanted to go home and watch hockey with their dad (who, like Jess, was never a hockey fan until the Lightning started winning).   I annoyed my sister because I asked her why she's letting the 6-year old play "Grand Theft Auto: Vice City". She got all huffy and pissed. Besides being able to shoot people in a realistic fashion (cops and innocent bystanders) you can also pick up hookers (apparently the car rocks and there are "action" sounds), and there's hidden a porn studio you can stumble upon that features a real porn star supplying the sounds and whatnot. Really proper for a 6-year old, is it not? See, it's easier for her to say "go ahead and play it" than it is to make sure he doesn't play it, less of a hassle for her... isn't that what it's all about? It's just another example of lazy parenting, one of the biggest problems with society today.    My sister brought a painting down for my Mom (my sister's in-laws gave it to her). My Mom had to take my sister over to Exxon and buy her some gas (she was broke), and then they went on home from there.   Mom and I came home and ate dinner in peace and quiet.     I'm pooped. I think I'm going to be heading to bed much earlier tonight... much, much earlier.

        Wednesday   I didn't get to bed last night until well after the sun came up. I was reading in bed and eating a chocolate bar. It looks like it's going to go exactly the same this morning, because after I finish here, I'm going to bed with a book and some chocolate.   I got up a little earlier today, around 3:30pm. I'd wanted to take the boys out somewhere good for dinner after I'd gotten up, but they had been eating all day and weren't really hungry. I had some Count Chocula to hold me over.  I watched the boys play video games (Super Mario) and then I watched "The Simpsons" with them.   I lost track of time and forgot to call JP about my paycheck until it was too late. I'll have to pick it up on Thusday now.   Later on, we watched "The Fugitive". By the time it was over, they were hungry again.  Mom took us to Denny's (not my favorite place to eat) and they all had breakfasts while I had a nasty double cheeseburger and a really nasty order of nachos (which I took home). I should've had pancakes instead.   After we ate, Mom dropped us off at the ice skating rink near the back of the park and the boys played in the "snow" (actually shaved ice from the rink) for a long while. I played a little bit, but mostly watched and made sure the older boy was playing fair.  After they got bored there, I suggested walking up to 7-11 for Slurpees, and the boys were agreeable to that.   By the time we got there, it was almost 1am... I didn't realize it was that late! We got our Slurpees (and I bought myself another Hershey bar) and then I walked them over to my (and their mother's) old elementary school, the one that got hit by the tornado (they're fascinated by tornadoes). We sat on a bench out in front of the school and finished out Slurpees. The younger boy said he had to go poop, so we abruptly headed home.   It was a long walk. By the time we got home, my feet were killing me. I sat on the couch and really didn't leave it for a long time afterward.   We watched TV a bit and then Mom came out to tell the boys that their elderly nextdoor neighbor was dead. He had died sometime this week. Apparently, he'd been dead for days before he was discovered. No one noticed that his mail and newspapers were piling up and that he wasn't putting any trash out... nice.   After Mom had talked to them about the neighbor's death, I cheered them up with some classic "Ren & Stimpy". A little later, after he'd been nodding in and out of sleep for awhile, Austin went on to bed.   After he'd gone, Jess and I watched some old "Beavis & Butthead" shows and laughed our asses off. I ate some of my gross nachos from Denny's, and then we watched "Southern Comfort" until 5:15am. Jess barely made it through the movie. He went to bed almost as soon as it was over.   The eastern sky is starting to get light now and the traffic out on the highway is beginning to pick up; I've got another long day ahead of me, so I'm heading to bed. Besides, I've got a book and a chocolate bar calling my name.

        Tuesday   I didn't get to sleep until sometime around 8:30am this morning (Tuesday). I laid in bed, with the fan blowing on me, reading "Night Shift" and snacking on a Hershey bar (with almonds). Ahhh... that's the life.   Mom was home early from work today, around Noon, so she had the kids most of the day. She took them to the movies ("Shrek 2") while I slept. I got up around 4:30pm and then got showered and waited for them to get home.   After they arrived, I hid in the spare room and waited for one of them to come back and wake me up. Austin finally did, so I jumped out of the spare room screaming and scared the poop out of him. I got him good.   After we ate "lunch", I played "Beach Head" with Austin and then he played "Super Mario" on my old Nintendo while Jess and I watched "The Simpsons".   After a bit, I took the kids outside and started to get the Slip & Slide set up, but there were parts that needed to be inflated and it was taking too long with me trying to blow it up. I went in to get the compressor I bought last night but discovered that it's had to be hooked up to a car's cigarette lighter. Mom had gone swimming, so were had to wait until she got home to do it.   After she got back and we'd inflated the Slip & Slide, the boys played on it for a while, until they got bored with it, then we played "Keep Away" out in the street for awhile.   Meanwhile, I had Mom inflating my swimming pool for me. She was using the compressor to blow it up, but then she started getting paranoid about her car's battery running out, and decided to take it to a gas station for air instead, which didn't work out very well at all. She only got it partially inflated, so I still am not able to use my pool. Grrrrr!!!!   After we came in and got cleaned up and clothes changed, we wound up watching TV the rest of the night. I had on a couple of nature shows (one about a guy living alone up in Alaska and the other about crocodiles and life in a draught-ravaged African riverbed), and then Austin went on to bed. I think that was somewhere around 1am. Jess and I shot darts and listened to Rush, then we watched Jackass and some Bam Marjera stuff before he headed on to bed (around 3:30am).   I'm going to be going to bed soon myself, though I'll probably read and snack on my other Hershey bar before I drift off to sleep.   One thing I really need to do tomorrow is to get my paycheck from JP (he took it home with him today for some reason). I wish he'd have just dropped it off on his way home. I need to get that money in the bank  in a hurry .    Oh, it looks like I'll have both boys until Thursday now. That's cool. That'll give me the whole weekend to try and get myself back to "normal hours" so I can start job hunting.  Ok... off to bed now.

        Memorial Day 2004: A Hot One   I stayed in bed extra late today (I'm talking about Monday), not getting up until about 4:30pm when my Mom woke me up. It was nice laying there in bed, with my fan blowing cool air all over me.   Mom had taken the kids to McDonalds and she brought me back two Filet-O-Fish sammiches (I could have done without them). After I ate, I goofed around with the boys awhile, on the computer and in my room, and then Mom drove us up to Super Target where I spent a bunch of money I shouldn't have spent (luckily, I have a final paycheck due me tomorrow).   It was 91 degrees out when we were leaving, around 6:30pm. Jesse said it was 96 degrees earlier when they were out. There also wasn't any wind blowing. It was a very hot, humid day.   At Target, I bought a 6-pack of cream soda, a bottle of wine (I like having wine around but Mom never buys it), some underwear (9 pairs! yay!), and best of all, a big inflatable swimming pool (to cool off in)!   My Mom was going to buy Austin a big fireworks pack for $20, but I told her that'd be a bad idea since people around here have to work in the morning and also, it's not really a fireworks kind of holiday (more a day of rememberance). He got pouty and started acting like an ass so I had to yell at him, in front of a lot of people, in Target. He chilled out after that.   After we finished at Target, we stopped at some new place calle Jamba Juice to see what they had. I wound up ordering some concoction called a Peenya Kowlada, which was sort of like a Pina Colada, except not. It had pineapple and coconut in it, but it also had yogurt and some other stuff in it too. I wasn't too thrilled with it.   Austin was hungry, so went next door to Fatburgers. I wanted to try a Fatburger and did. It was ok. I wasn't really my kind of place though, too noisy. We finally went home after we finished there.   We tried to play outside a bit tonight, but it was just too damned hot and humid (have I mentioned that it was hot and humid out?), so we went back in. I played some video games with Austin while Jess, ever the bandwagoneer, watched the Lightning game on TV.   After we got bored with that, I went outside and tried to get the pool going, but I realized that the pump I have just couldn't get the job done, so around 11pm, the boys and I walked up to Walgreens.   Before we stopped there, we went out behind the Walgreens to check on the cattails. Most weren't ready yet (they have to be soft, falling apart), but some were, so the boys had a mini-cattail fight. Austin was covered in cattail fluff, head to toe!   We walked over to Dunkin' Donuts next, and I bought us all milk and eclairs. I don't know why Austin even ordered one though, three bites in and he was done.   On the way to Dunkin' Donuts, we passed a small, dark, wooded area where there's and old abandoned house, and I dared Jesse to go in there and yell "I ain't afraid of the Boogeyman!". He went up to the edge of the woods and yelled it, and when he turned to face me, I pretended I saw someone coming at us and hauled ass, which scared him pretty good for a moment. When we passed there the second time, on the way back to Walgreens, I scared Austin by throwing a rock into the woods when he wasn't looking and when it landed, he saw the leaves move and he heard the russling noise.    At Walgreens and I bought a mini air compressor for the pool, a water, and two jumbo Hershey bars. We went on home after that.   We were pooped after we got home, so we just watched TV for a couple of hours. They watched "Jackass: The Movie" with me (I changed the channel during some of the more adult stuff) and then we watched some of "America's Funniest Animals" before Austin went on to bed (somewhere around 2:30am).   Jess and I stayed up watching some hokey Kung-Fu flick, "The Master Of the Flying Guillotine". I ate his leftovers from Lone Star, then we played darts and listened to Rush. It was pretty fun. I'm glad I moved my dartboard out to the living room.   He went on to bed around 4:45am. I'm heading to bed now.

        Saturday, So Far   I was out of bed before 1pm today, so that was good (better than yesterday anyway). I got my mailings packaged up and ready to mail, also good. Mom ordered pizza & wings for lunch and that was very good (except dietwise).   We ran out after lunch and I mailed my stuff, then we hit two thrift stores before coming back home. No big finds today. I bought a another 3-drawer cassette tape storage case for $2, a paperback (Ayn Rand "Atlas Shrugged") for $1, and 5 tapes, all for $1.25. Less than $5 spent, not much of a shopping spree.   The tapes I got were The Pat Travers Band "Crash And Burn", Lou Reed "Mistrial", Janis Joplin "Greatest Hits" (the insert is kind of messed up), Loverboy "Get Lucky" (plays poorly, but luckily I already had it), and Eddie Money "Playing For Keeps" (I don't think one's going to play very well, looks pretty of old and used).   After we got home, I started scanning cards to list tonight. I'd pulled over 125 cards last night and even listed a few of them. I should have over 500 listed in my store by the time I finish tonight.  That should keep me busy for the rest of the night... and I still need to practice for tomorrow night's workout with Santana's band.

        Stuff   I got up around 1:30pm yesterday, and today, 12:30pm. I'm pretty much back to my night owl hours again. *Sigh*  I have two leads on jobs that I should check into, both in schools. One is a Cafeteria Attendant at an elementary school but is only 3 hours a day, the other is a Community Involvement Assistant, great pay, but it's way down in St.Pete (two long bus rides every day) and I'm not altogether sure I'd be right for the job (or it for me). My eBay auctions have been moving nicely, so I just may wait until I find the right thing. Something's bound to come up (I hope).  I listed almost 100 auctions in my eBay store yesterday. It was up to nearly 450 items in it until this afternoon when this guy in Japan bought 17 cards! I sold a bunch yesterday too. I may pull some cards to list tonight. I would still like to have 500 listed before Sunday.  Speaking of Sunday, Santana called today and invited me to practice with his band on Sunday (6pm). He said he'll have another guitar player there too, so I'd like to be in top form (which means I need to practice). He also said they may start practicing during the week too, which would be terrific. The more I play, the better I get, so bring it on! They want to start playing out soon. Their drummer has to undergo surgery in October, so that gives me a couple months playing time with them. By the time he goes in for surgery, my band should be about ready to play out again.   My Mom picked up 5 tickets to a pre-season basketball game in Tampa, the Orlando Magic vs. the Miami Heat. I'm especially thrilled about this because the Heat now have Shaquille O'Neal on their team, the most dominant player in the entire NBA! Sweet! It'll be her, me, my two nephews, and probably my brother-in-law. I think she said the game is in October.   I talked to my niece last night and again today, it looks like she's going to come down and spend the weekend with Mom and I next week. I think we'll get her on Friday. It was important to me to not let the Summer go by without having her down. She's getting older and will be going to college before long, so I wanted to make sure we got to spend some time together before spending time together becomes a hardship.   My back is killing me today. It was bothering me last night too. Maybe I'm sitting too much. I keep thinking about taking walks in the evenings or in the mornings, but I never do. I hate doing stuff alone.   John Kerry's speech last night still has me energized some. I still feel very hopeful about the things he said. I just hope he's for real.   Talked to JP a few minutes ago, he's having trouble figuring out how to go about drums for the demo. He wants to buy a drum machine, but being recently laid-off himself, he's hesitant about making the purchase. He just doesn't think Jimmy'd have the time to do the demos the way we agreed, with JP sending him a rough track and Jimmy laying a new drum track over it. Very frustrating. I made several suggestions, but it's still up in the air. Neddless to say, our demo is not progressing very far.     Speaking about not going very far... the car my Mom gave me is dead. It looks like the battery up and died. I finally have a car and I can't even use it. I need to go get a license still too. I'm so fucking lazy.

        John Kerry For Prez!   Unless something goes horribly awry, I am going to vote for  urlLink John Kerry  come November. I just watched his  urlLink Democratic National Convention speech  and he said everything I needed to hear him say (and I mean  everything ). He said he plans on cutting corporate welfare, on stopping tax breaks for companies who outsource, on finally setting up a national health care plan, on repealing Bush's tax cuts for the wealthy, on ending unilateralism, on ending the backdoor draft of our reserve members, on bringing our troops home, on allowing stem cell research, and on and on and on. He also attacked the right people: Bush, Cheney and Ashcroft. If John Kerry accomplishes even a quarter of what he promises, he could end up being one of our greatest Presidents. At the very least, he has given me some hope for the future and that counts for something.   Unfortunately, I couldn't get Mom to watch Kerry's speech tonight. She's extremely pessimistic about him, for no apparent reason, which worries me that she's going to do something incredibly stupid and vote for Bush or else not vote at all.   It's been said numerous times before by many different people, but at this point, a vote for Bush is a serious character flaw.

        Clownin' Around   I've had this thing in my mind for years now, a novel or a movie about clowns done in a serious way. I find the notion of a "clown drama" very funny for some reason. Anyway,  urlLink Sara  asked for people to post silly little stories on her blog yesterday and I complied with a snippet of "clown drama" that I came up with especially for her blog. I added some more to it today too. I also came up with this this clown-themed faux newspaper article last night:   Tragedy On Highway 64  by Bill Sherwin  POTTSVILLE -- Yesterday afternoon, a speeding Volkswagen Beetle full of clowns drove straight into the back of a fully-loaded 16-ton truck, instantly killing all 41 of the Volkswagens passengers and severely injuring the trucks driver.   Witnesses at the scene reported that the beetle had been weaving through traffic, upwards of 110 MPH, and that there appeared to be a massive food fight going on within the car. It is believed that the driver of the VW, identified only as Professor Slappy, may have had his vision impaired by pie or seltzer water just before slamming into the back of the truck, causing both vehicles to explode instantly. The explosion caused by the collision was said to have sent scores of screaming clowns airborne, raining down onto oncoming traffic.  It was horrible, said one witness, kind of funny, but mostly horrible.   The truck driver, John Holcomb, 46, suffered a broken arm and some minor burns. He had been transporting a shipment for the Ga-Ga Gags company, the Mid-Wests largest supplier of gag gifts, when he had suddenly been struck from behind.    Witnesses at the scene said there were chattering teeth, groucho glasses, and clown parts strewn for about a mile down the section of U.S. Highway 64 where the accident occurred. One of the Emergency Response Technicians on the scene said that they were having a hard time figuring out where the victims ended and the gag gifts began.  When asked for a comment, Sheriff J.T. Halper said of the tragedy Clowns arent funny. They give me the creeps.   I sent it to my Mom at work and she said she was fooled at first, so I guess I did a decent job with it. I don't know if I'll do anymore, but I like writing, so I just might.  By the way, comments are welcome (criticisms, critiques, whatever).

        Rainy Day, Sleep Away   I went to bed late again last night, read in bed before trying to sleep, and then got up late again today (around 11:30am). I had to get up several times throughout the night again too.  I got up, played around on the PC, watched TV, and ate lunch. It was raining pretty much all day today, and I was still tired from not sleeping much last night, so I wound up in back bed eventually. I think I went back to bed around 4pm and stayed there until nearly 6pm, when I heard Mom on the phone (sounded like she was bitching about me). She was talking to JP.   He said he's going to buy a drum machine and do his rhythm parts (for our demo) with the drum machine and then send the rhythm track to Jimmy so he can record his drum parts. I hope they bust their asses on it. I'd like to be finished with it by the end of August, so we can start working on playing out again.   While I was sleeping, I won another auction (for $4.99 total):       It's more than what I'd normally pay for used tapes, but...it looks like all 3 tapes are remastered and I don't have that particular Hendrix remastered tape ("Axis:Bold As Love") in my collection yet, and I need the Pink Floyd and Santana tapes, so it's well worth it to me (as long as they arrive in decent shape).   I'm going to go watch "Amish In The City" with Mom now. I've been half-watching it for 20 minutes now anyway. The show looks like it could be interesting, but it also looks like they're going to ruin the concept (Amishfolk being introduced to modern city life) with stupid "Real World" type casting and attitude, which is too bad. My grandmother, my Mom's Mom, was Amish, and there were a lot of Amishfolk around where we lived in Pennsylvania.

        Bank Yankers   I hate my bank. They took me for another $27 today. Not for a bounced check or for anything that would affect anyone else, they charged me $27 because I was unable to transfer money to myself. I didn't realize my Paypal transfer hadn't cleared yet when I transferred money back to my Mom's account (I was in a hurry to pay her back what I could) and I didn't leave enough money in my checking account, which was my error, of course, but how does that merit a $27 charge? I mean, who got affected by it other than myself? For $27 you'd think abank employee had do do some manual labor on my account. Greedy fucks.   I just got my insurance premium bill in too, the $6.75 one the bank decided not to clear for me because I didn't have enough funds in my savings (even though there is a mandatory $50 balance at all times and I had money in my checking account that could've covered it), yet, and this is what burns me the most, and yet they took $27 of my $50 to pay their own stinking fee. They can't spot me $6.75 for an account with a $50 balance but they can take $27 out for themselves? I hate my bank.

        Pee-Pee-Palooza   Last night sucked! I had to get up four times to pee...  four times ! What am I,  seventy-something ? I had a really time sleeping before and after each trip to the bathroom, I don't think I slept much all night. Naturally, when it came time to get up in the morning, I wasn't ready to do so. I had my alarm set for 9am, then I re-set it for 10am and went back to bed. Then, I slept through an hour of alarm/radio before finally getting up a little after 11am. Ugh!  It looks like the getting-up-early thing is slowly slipping away from me again. Two days ago I was up at 8am, the next day 9am, and now, today, 11am. I'm slipping into my natural, night-owl lifestyle all over again.   I wish I could just find myself a nighttime job and go with my natural schedule, but I need my nights for my band, so I have to have a day job, so i have to keep trying to keep myself on that schedule. It's hard to get up early when there's nothing to get up for. I mean, if I had a a job, I'd be up early for a reason, to go to work, but as is, I get up early and then I just sit here doing stuff I could do at anytime of the day. I think my life is based on Catch-22.

        The Return Of  urlLink The Friday Five !   The original Friday Five ended a while back, but it looks like someone else has revived it! It was always one of the better memes out there, so here's my Friday Five, the Monday Edition (better late than never):   1) who was your favorite band/musican when you were younger?   That's a tough one for me, because there wasn't just one. In fact, I went through several phases. If I remember correctly, it was these guys first:     My KISS phase lasted into Middle School. Then, one Summer these guys showed up on my TV:     They made me laugh, the music was pretty good (except for the mushy Davy Jones stuff), so I started collecting their records and stuff. I even met Peter Tork at a Monkees convention nearby and got his autograph (which, sadly, I sold long ago).   While I was still in my Monkees phase, I was hanging out with one of the boys from across the street, the oldest one, Billy, who also played guitar. One day I was hanging out in his room and he put on a record which completely blew me away. It was "Smash Hits", by this guy:       I've never left my Hendrix phase.     2) why?    KISS because I was a kid and the costumes and imagery appealed to me, The Monkees because they were on TV and I thought they were funny, and Jimi Hendrix because I'd never heard anything like him before (it was like stepping into another universe, musically).    3) are they still your favorite/one of your favorites?   I still love early KISS, up until "Creatures Of The Night". Everything after that has pretty much sucked consistently. I like a lot of the Monkees stuff still, especially Mike Nesmith's stuff. Hendrix is still my all-time favorite.    4) what is your favorite of their songs?   There's too many great KISS songs to name just one, for instance "Black Diamond", "Do You Love Me", "100,000 Years", "C'Mon And Love Me", "She", "Shock Me", "Deuce", and on and on and on... just a ton of killer songs! I love "The Porpoise Song" by the Monkees (from "Head"), and "Circle Sky" is awesome too (it really rocks). I love almost everything by Hendrix, especially "Machine Gun" (from "Band Of Gypsys"), "Pali Gap" and "Hey Baby (New Rising Sun)" (from "Rainbow Bridge", "Voodoo Child (Slight Return)", "Bold As Love" (from Axis:Bold As Love"), "Burning Desire" (from "Loose Ends"), "Ezy Ryder" and "In From The Storm" (from "The Cry Of Love") and his version of Dylan's "All Along The Watchtower", among others. Ask me tomorrow and I might have a totally different list of favorite Hendrix songs.      5) are there any specific lyrics you hold dear?   I've never been too much of a "lyric man". If the songs rocks, it rocks, regardless of how good the lyrics are. That's not to say I don't appreciate good lyrics when I hear them, but they usually don't stay in my mind for long. I don't know why that is.

        Monday Business   I had set my alarm for 8am again this morning, but I slept poorly last night again and when my alarm went off, I got up and set it an hour ahead. Then, when it went off at 9am, I laid in bed with the alarm/radio blaring for a good half hour. I hate mornings.   I got up, played some video Poker and Blackjack (one of the games JP gave me yesterday, I installed it before I went to bed last night) and then I got done to "work".   I pulled and scanned a bunch of cards and then spent the aftrenoon listing them on eBay. I'm up to 360 items in my store right now, I had more but I sold 11 cards today. I wish I'd started doing this sooner.   I'm going to pull a bunch more to scan and list tomorrow. I'd like to have 400 up by tomorow night and 500 up by the weekend.   But now, I'm going to go eat and then goof off for awhile.

        Sunday   I woke up at 8am this morning. I'd set the alarm before I went to bed, but I slept really badly last night and wasn't ready to get up at no 8am. But alas, I did anyway.  I listed a handful of tapes on eBay this morning and edited a bunch of older auctions. I sold another tape last night. I also sold a tape while I was out today. I need to sell a hell of a lot more than that. I guess I'll be listing stuff all week. JP gave me some old Playstation games today, so I can list some of them too.    He picked me up around 1:30pm today and then we headed on over to Jimmy's. Once we got there it was slow starting. There were problems getting Jimmy's electronic drums to go through JP's 4-track recorder without the drums peaking out, causing sonic breaks and static. We wasted at least an hour working on it. Finally, after we got a workable drum sound, we decided to just record the best we could and then Jimmy could re-record his drums at a later date using the scratch rhythm tracks we put down today.   JP wound up doing all of the rhythm parts (it was easier that way since he had to sing along anyway), for the most part, I wasn't really even needed. We got about 5 or 6 rough tracks laid down before we had to pack up and go. We were only over at Jimmy's for less than three hours. I was hoping for more time than that.   Since Jimmy's taking off all of next month, I was hoping he'd make more time for us this month, today even. It looks now like what we got today is pretty much it for getting together and working on a demo. JP and I will have to work on laying down rhythm tracks alone on ACID and then JP will send those files over to Jimmy to work on whenever he can. I have a feeling we're not going to be ready to play out come September, having taken nearly two full months off.   I'm thinking about getting JP, Al, and I together to jam. Both of them can play drums, Al and I can switch off on guitar and bass, it would be fun. JP could even bring in his keyboard. We could work on new material and try out new cover songs without any pressure whatsoever. I really don't want to go another month without us playing; two months is just too long. And then, we lose another month in December or January when JP takes off. Ugh!   I'll probably play with Santana's band next Saturday, just to be able to play, if he still wants me there. I think he was disappointed I wasn't going to make it tonight, but hey, working on a demo for my band has priority over jamming with his band. Besides, he never officially asked me to join his band or made it clear exactly what kind of situation I'd be walking into, so I don't feel like I did him wrong or anything by not playing tonight. I've made no commitment with him.     In fact, if JP buys the recording studio he's thinking about buying, I may not be playing with Santana at all. I'm sure I'd be spending as much spare time as possible at JP's studio. JP and I are pretty creative, especially when it comes to music, and I know we would have an absolute blast there, recording our asses off. He seems pretty serious about doing it too (my fingers are crossed).   I'm about ready for bed now, very tired. I still need to check out the Jobs section (from today's paper) yet though. What to do, what to do...

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  Today I was listening to the Allman Brothers, The Black Crowes, Eric Clapton, and Steely Dan. I didn't listen to much of anything during the week.   Watching on TV:  Lots of poker shows: "Celebrity Poker", "World Poker Tour", "The World Series Of Poker"; judge shows: "The People's Court", "Judge Mathis"; and comedies: "Everybody Loves Raymond", "The Simpsons", "The Daily Show", "The Young Ones", "Monty Python's Flying Circus", and others. I've also played my Monty Python DVDs a couple of times this week ("Life Of Brian" is on as I type this).   Reading:  I finished reading Elmore Leonard's "Freaky Deaky" this week, good book. I think I'd liek to get some more of his stuff.   I also finished reading "Feel This Book" by Ben Stiller and Janeane Garofalo, which wasn't as funny as I'd hoped, though some of Stiller's stuff is hilarious (Garofalo gets too cerebral and wordy for my liking). I have the audiobook of this book, which I bought a while back and never listened to... I should give it a listen.   I haven't started reading anything new yet. I'm leaning toward some Vonnegut... yay! I have  three  of his books that I haven't read yet.     Playing  Still playing a lot of "Age Of Empires 2".   Downloading:  I downloaded some Gram parsons stuff the other day. He's one of those guys who I never really  listened  to (even though I had one of his albums).         Jamming:  Tomorrow JP, Jimmy and I are supposed to do some 4-track recording over at Jimmy's place. Depeneding on when we finish and how JP feels, I may jam with Santana's band afterward. A "we'll see" situation.      Working:  I've been checking a couple of sites on the internbet, but so far I haven't found anything good yet. They're hiring at the strip club around the corner, but I don't think I could handle a job in there (too sleazy, I'd imagine). I think I'm one of the few guys around these days who's never set foot in a strip club.    Buying:  I won another cassette box set on eBay this week, the Chess blues box set (4 tapes) for $9:     .. and a small lot of 6 tapes for $3.49 (I bought it for the Frank Zappa, Little Feat, and Van Morrison tapes in the lot).      That's it for the week.     Selling:  I listed a shitload of tapes in my eBay store these last couple of days. I had about 75 items in there before I started, now I have 325 items in there, just cassette tapes and basketball cards. I do have a few CDs and books that I may list.     Eating:  Publix had pork roasts on sale this week and Mom bought  four of them . I've been eating pork and carrots all week, usually with potatoes of some kind. I also ate some Jose Ole' soft tacos, hot dogs and sauerkraut (no buns), and Stuffer's chicken and baked potato TV dinners. I had one or two 2-liters of Pepsi this week, but I told Mom to stop buying it (again). All in all, I'm doing better than I was this time last year, but I am getting absolutely no exercise. I need to start walking in the evenings or in the morning (or both). I talk about it, but I never get off my ass and do it.      Feeling:    Mentally, worried about my finances. The bills keep on coming, job or no.    Physically, besides my sleep hassles (I think I stayed up all night three times this week trying to get my sleep schedule in order), I'm doing ok, no big complaints.    Planning:  J-O-B.   I'd like to have my nephews and my niece down before the summer is over. Pretty soon my niece will be out on her own (she got her 1st car today), going to college and all, and I'd like to spend some time with her before it's too late. Family is very important to me.

        Earlybirdin' It   Well, I made it until sometime after 8pm last night before I went on to bed. I slept ok, not as long as I'd have liked though: I was up at 3:30am. Ugh! Too freakin' early!   But at least I got the worm.   I started listing some more eBay auctions this morning and some fella over in the UK bought 12 of them! He was buying them as I was listing them, over $50 worth of auctions! Best of all, he paid for them immediately! Sweet! I was able to pay off my eBay tab and then some (which means I can pay Mom back the money I borrowed from her to cover me from eBay).   I sold a tape today too ($2), no payment on that yet. I'm going to list a bunch more cards and tapes in the next few days. well, tomorrow I'm supposed to go record with JP and Jimmy (and maybe even play with Santana's band later that night) and Monday I need to get on with the job hunting, but in between I can list to my heart's content. I have about $325 in bills to pay in the next week and a half, so I need to list as much as possible, no matter what.   I got the card lot packaged up and ready to mail. I guess we'll be heading out around 2pm or 3pm to do that.   I'm tired already... 3:30am is just too damned early to be getting up, y'all.

        Still Up, But Not For Long   I made it through most of the day today without napping or anything. I'm tired as fuck though. I think I'll be in bed before 8pm.  I pulled, scanned, and listed more basketball cards on eBay today... at least I'm being productive. I just wish they'd start selling, my money situation is killing me (no wonder I can't sleep). I sold one card overnight, but it was only for $1 and the person is sending payment via snail mail.   I'm hoping, if I can get my sleep shit together, to set up at the flea market on Sunday.

        Continuing Sleep Hassles   I went to bed around 12:30am last night, read a little, and then tried to fall asleep. Like last night, it just didn't happen. I stayed in bed until about 4:45am before I finally said "fuck it" and got up. Between 3am and then, instead of sleeping, I'd played with Stevie (my cat), finished the book I was reading, and played guitar... very frustrating.   I guess I am going to have to try and stay up all day and night again. I hate doing that, it throws me completely out of whack, not that I'm exactly "in whack" now.    I was hoping on doing some running with Mom today, but I doubt that'll happen now. I need to get to the unemployment office and challenge their decision to refuse me aid and this is the last Friday that Mom is off (next week they go back to normal hours at her job).   Why is it so hard for  me  to be normal?

        Sleep Hassles   I finally went to bed around 2:30pm yesterday, but I was back around 6:30pm. I figured I'd get up and stay up until 10 or 11pm and then I'd go to bed at a normal hour, which in turn would have me waking up at a normal hour as well. It didn't work that way at all.   After watching TV for awhile, I started listing tapes for sale on eBay. I did that until somethime around 12:30am, then I went to bed and read for awhile before finally trying to get to sleep. My mind was focusing on my financial problems and I had a hard time getting to sleep. I was up and down to pee a lot too. I think the sun was shining before I finally got to sleep last night.   I'd set my alarm for 10am, but when it rang, I shut it off and went back to bed. I was just too tired to stay up. How tired? I slept until after 4pm. Ugh!  I just can't get on "normal hours", no matter how much I try.   I think I'm going to try going to bed earlier rather than staying up for a day and a half. The staying-up thing just isn't working anymore.

        Tuesday's Gone   I went to be around 2am Tuesday morning and four hours later, I was still awake, laying in bed playing guitar. I just can't sleep when I'm supposed to, like a normal human being. I didn't get out of bed until nearly 5pm.   A little after I got up, I started messing with tapes, trying to figure out what tapes to list on eBay and how to list them. I finally gave up. I don't think I'd make anything listing them on eBay anyway. I decided to list basketball cards instead.   I went through several boxes of cards pulling a bunch to list, I scanned them all, and then I listed about 60-70 of them on eBay. It's taken me all night to get that far and I still have about 40 more to list. It doesn't look like I'm going to bed any time soon (or at all) so I should be able to finish up today.  It's a good thing I did stay up all night last night; Mom's alarm didn't go off this morning and she overslept. I went back there to ask her about borrowing some money, but she was still sleeping. She said "I'm supposed to be at work in 15 minutes!"   I needed to borrow money again because of eBay this time. My stinking eBay account has had a positive balance the last few times I checked it, but after I started listing cards overnight, the balance began going up, which leads me to belive I'm running a negative balance (even though it doesn't show up as a negative balance anywhere). My main concern there is that they'll take the money I owe them directly out of my checking account but I'm not sure  when  they'll take it out, so I had to borrow $25 from Mom just to be safe. Hopefully some of the cards I listed tonight will sell quickly. I can certainly use the money, that's for damn sure.    I had some fast money offered to me last night, but I don't think I'm going to be able to collect it. I got a call from a friend of my brother-in-law last night. He owns a lounge up in Holiday and wanted my band to play there Friday night (for $250). He had a band drop out on him, hence the short notice. I don't think we're going to be able to do it though. For starters, I think Al is out of town. Also, they don't have a P.A. set up there and JP's P.A. head needs to be repaired. It's a late gig too (from 9pm til 1am) and I don't think the guys would want to play out late on a Friday since they all get up early for work. I called Santana and offered the gig to him, but I don't think they can do it either. I told him I'd play with them if he needed me. We'll see.   Back to work...

        Monday Stuff   I had trouble getting to sleep again last night. Either Mom or the A/C guy messed with the thermostat and it was too warm for me. I got up around 4:30am to lower it. I wound up sleeping until 1:35pm. It was still rainy out and I was very cozy in my cool room and warm blankets. I could have stayed in bed much longer.   I was supposed to check into that 3-hour school job today, but I didn't. Instead, I started a couple of projects (I am still the King of Procrastination). First I went through my favorites folder and re-organized my links and folders. Then I went through my extra tapes and pulled out about 250 that I  definitely  want to sell (everything I have more than two of). If I can start getting up early again, I would like to set up a booth at the flea market or else hold a yard sale. I might list them on eBay just to move them, but I would probably get back less than what I have into them.   Speaking about tapes, my sealed Steely Dan box set arrived today (the one I paid $8.89 for), and to my surprise, there were no tapes in the box. Instead, there were CDs. Very strange. I think it's some factory screw up because the box said "cassettes" on the outside, but there were 4 brand new CDs inside. Unfortunately, the booklet to the box set was missing also. Weird. I guess I should be happy that I got CDs instead of tapes, but being extremely anal about my CDs, I'm not. I would prefer to have the CD box and booklet to go with the CDs.  My sister called my Mom and wants us to watch all three kids on Friday night so that her and her husband can go out. I guess they're planning on coming back here after they're done and spend the night here with the kids. Everytime I want one of the kids down it's a major hassle, my sister'll tell me that she needs to see if they want to come down first (half the time, when I talk to the kids later, they tell me she never even asked them), but it's funny how, when she wants them down (or when their grandparents want them), it's not up to the kids. Also, whenever I try to make plans with them, without fail, they wait until the last minute to make up their minds, which, also without fail, stresses me the hell out. I told Mom to tell them "We'll see" this time, that we're not sure what we're doing that night yet. Give them a taste of their own medicine for a change.

        Rainy Day, Jam Away   For some odd reason, I slept horribly last night. It was raining and usually I'd snuggle up and sleep like a baby, but last night I kept waking up, over and over again. I thought I'd wind up sleeping until late in the afternoon, but I was up around 12:30pm, which isn't so bad (but it's not so good either).   After lunch, Santana called me and said he'd be over to pick me up around 4:30pm. I talked to JP earlier and he said he wasn't going (not a surprise). I got showered, dressed, and ready for Santana to come pick me up.  He arrived a little early and we wound up waiting a long time (an hour and a half)for the other guys to show up and get set-up. We had Jon on keyboards, Mike on drums, Page on rhythm guitar, Angus on bass, Ronnie on sax and flute, Santana on percussion, and me on lead guitar. At one point there was some lady singing too (just on "Chain Of Fools"), I guess she used to sing with their band.   I was familiar with most of the covers they played (we do several of the same ones in my band), but they do things a little different than I'm used to, so I still had to play it by ear a lot. I think I did okay on just about everything. We played "Long Train Running", "Blues Before Sunrise", "Before You Accuse Me", "Feelin' Alright", "Three A.M.", "Chain Of Fools", "Crossroads", "Can't You See", "Old Time Rock & Roll", "I'm Tore Down", "I Can't Stand It", "Proud Mary", "Mustang Sally", "Wild Night", "Black Magic Woman", "Brick House", and "Hey Joe". Mike mentioned he like CCR a lot, so I threw out "Born On The Bayou" and "Who'll Stop The Rain".   Some stuff sounded pretty good, some of it kind of rough. I'll have to work on learning some of their material, to cut down on the percentage of the rough stuff.       We only played until 9pm, which kind of sucked. We started at 6pm and they took a 1/2 hour break in the middle. I would've liked to have played longer. I guess I'm going to sit in with them again next week, which works for me (the more practice I get, the better). It sounds like they want me to play with them all the time, but nobody put it that way, so I'm still not sure what's going to happen with these guys. Santana mentioned playing some gigs, though. We'll see. I may be playing in two bands, neither of which are playing the kind of stuff I really want to play.   Oh! Dig this: Angus, the bassist (who's really, really good), said he has a gig coming up over in Tampa with (now get this) Randy Jackson (from Zebra)... holy shit! How fucking cool is that? He said they're going to be playing all Led Zeppelin material... sweet! He also said something about playing with Joe Lynn Turner (from Rainbow), but I'm not sure if it's the same show or not. I'll have to find out next week.   In other news, one of my cats, Stevie, is sneezing a lot. He's been doing it for a couple of days now. I'm afraid he'll have to go see the vet. Steve won't like that very much, and knowing how Stevie reacts to stuff like that (he  freaks ), I know I won't enjoy it very much either. Also, since I have no money, Mom will probably have to pay for it, so she  also  won't like it very much. This, by the way, is Stevie:     This is Stevie playing with some plastic shipping straps that I hung up on the recliner. His brother, Jimmy, is watching him (waiting for  his  turn).      It's pretty cool being able to post pictures now.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  My new Wilco CD ("A Ghost Is Born"), which I played about 3 times yesterday... great album! I also listened to some Miles Davis yesterday (my new box set) and some Alabama tonight. Yes, I said Alabama.    Watching on TV:  Same as usual: "Fear Factor", "Celebrity Poker", "World Poker Tour", "The World Series Of Poker", "People's Court", "Judge Mathis", "Everybody Loves Raymond", "King Of Queens", and "The Daily Show", among others. No surprises.    Reading:  I finished Tim Allen's "I'm Not Really Here", but didn't like it near as much as his first book "Don't Stand Too Close To A Naked Man", which was a very funny read. This one, though very interesting and funny in parts, is just too contrived. He uses some literary devices that I found to be very amateurish.   I also finished reading Pamela Des Barres' book, "I'm With The Band", and I have problems with it as well. I thought her tale (the life story of a groupie), for the most part, to be pretty sad and pathetic, while she seems to think herself some sort of feminist icon because she was doing what she wanted to do with her life... which was be to be used and abused by rock stars! To me, she seems like a very mixed up, confused person, full of extreme contradictions and over emotional. I'm glad she made it through okay though, because she does seem like a nice person.   I started reading Elmore Leonard's "Freaky Deaky" last night. Pretty good so far.     Playing  Still playing a lot of "Age Of Empires 2".   Downloading:  Nothing as of late.        Jamming:  I haven't picked up my electric guitar since the last gig (exactly two weeks ago). I have goofed around on my acoustic here and there, but I should be playing a lot more than I am. I may be jamming tomorrow with Santana's band and I'm supposed to do some recording on Wednesday night at Jimmy's.      Working:  I was waiting to hear back about that school job and then it rained a lot and then the A/C went out, so I haven't applied anywhere this week. I need to get back on it come Monday.    Buying:  I won two cassette box sets on eBay (The Police & Steely Dan), both still sealed, for less than $16 in total (they'd sell in stores for about 4x that). Also, Mom and I hit a couple more thrift stores today and I found some books and tapes... don't I always? I got two hardcovers (Kurt Vonnegut "Hocus Pocus" and Oscar Wilde "The Picture Of Dorian Gray And Other Stories") and two paperbacks/softcovers (James Fenimore Cooper "The Last Of The Mohicans" and Ben Stiller/Janeane Garofalo "Feel This Book") and a handful of cassette tapes, most of which weren't really my style, but for $0.25 each, I thought they were worth picking up anyway. I got: Alabama  "Mountain Music" & "The Very Best Of Alabama" (a 2-tape set), Arrested Developement "3 Years, 5 Months, & 2 Days In The Life Of...", The Carpenters "The Singles 1969-1973", The Grass Roots "16 Great Hits", Tommy James & The Shondells "The Best Of", Meat Loaf "Bat Out Of Hell", Robert Palmer "Addictions Volume 2", and U2 "Rattle And Hum". I already have 3 of them (Arrested Developement, Meat Loaf, and U2) but I thought they might be in better shape than the ones I have, and for a quarter, they'd be worth picking up anyway.      Selling:  Still nothing. I really need to get on it soon.    Eating:  I've been eating smaller portions, but I'm still eating the wrong kinds of foods. I also started drinking soda again this month. I need to cut that off again too. I drank very little soda the first six months of this year.         Feeling:    Mentally, I'm jonesing to get on with things. I have a lot of possibilities, but everything is hinging on me finding a good job. I'm pretty stressed.   Physically, my right foot is still sore and it is also doing that weird muscle thing again. It's like a Charlie Horse in the foot and it hurts like hell. I'm fine otherwise.    Planning:  My main plan right now is to wait for a good job, no more taking shit jobs just because they're easy to get. My resume sucks because of that. After I get a good job, I plan on getting a driver's license and some insurance because I have a car sitting in the driveway now (Mom gave me her old car) and I need to get my ass behind the wheel. After that, I can start working on getting my own band going and maybe even find a girlfriend.

        Chillin'   Ahhh... we have A/C again. I even had to throw on extra blankets during the night. Life is semi-good again.   I didn't get to bed until nearly 1am last night, which is weird because I hadn't slept the night before so I should've been asleep long before then. In fact, I tried to go to bed around 9pm, but I just couldn't fall asleep. How weird is that?   Anyhoo, I was up early today (for me) but by 11:30am, I was ready for bed again. I went in and took a nap to the sound of rain falling on the roof. It was nice and cool in my room and I was totally comfy, snuggled up in my blankets... ahhh... very nice.   I got up around 2pm, to check on an eBay auction I was hoping to win (but didnt).   I guess I need to catch up on some stuff that happened in the last day or so:   Santana called me yesterday and invited me to come jam with his band on Sunday. He had to fire his guitar player. I don't know whether he wants me to come over just to jam or if he's looking for me to fill the vacancy in his band. I had to remind him that I have no transportation, so we'll see what happens. JP may go too, though he's kind of iffy, but if he does go, I can ride with him.   Speaking of JP, he came by yesterday to drop his P.A. off. He and his wife are talking about buying a recording studio now, the one we recorded our first demo at. I think that's a lot riskier than buying the night club they were talking about before, but if he could get it to work out moneywise... what a blast we could have, free reign in a recording studio, a dream come true.  For now, we're supposed to head over to Jimmy's on Wednesday night to start recording our demo (originals this time) on a digital 4-track.   I have to call about a different school job on Monday. It's clerical work and only 3-hours a day, but it's a foot in the door and the pay is better than anything else I've found of late. I'm worried I don't have enough experience to get the job, but if I could get in somehow, it'd be a great place to gain experience.   I need to go take a shower now, Mom and I are heading over to Lone Star for lunch/dinner... living the semi-good life again.

        Sweaty, Bored &amp; Angry   &nbsp;  Ugh! What a crappy night. I'd mentioned earlier that Mom opened windows in the house and also that it had rained, well one of the windows she'd opened was the one  behind  the entertainment center, a window I never open (because I have some common sense). The rain, however brief, sent a lot of water onto the entertainment center and ruined 4 DVD cases, including one of mine, my "This Is Spinal Tap" (Special Edition) DVD.&nbsp; And me, I'm extremely anal about the condition of my things, so now I'll have to go and buy a new one as soon as I can. Grrrrr!  &nbsp;  The heat throughout the night was (and is) pretty unbearable. I took a cold shower earlier and then several times throughout the night, I poured cold water over my head, trying in vain to cool off. It didn't work very well. I'm all sweaty and sticky... yuck.&nbsp;I  hate  not having any A/C.  &nbsp;  Needless to say, I spent a good part of the night laying in bed, in front of the fan, reading.&nbsp;&nbsp;Later on, I got bored and worked on my blog. I changed the template and rearranged a bunch of things. The new template comes with a "comments" section... sweet! Not that I expect to get many comments or anything, but it's cool to have. The next step for me is adding pictures, but I'll need to find a good photo host first and&nbsp;then I'll figure it out&nbsp;from there.  &nbsp;  I didn't sleep any last night, so I'm not sure how long I'll be up today. As hot as it is in here, I'll probably be in bed after Noon sometime, when it starts getting  really  hot. I'm not looking forward to that time of day at all.

        The Heat Is On   I stayed in bed until nearly 10pm tonight, drifting in and out of sleep all afternoon. It was really bad in there, with the heat and all. At one point, it seemed like I could hardly breath it was so stuffy in there. I had my fan set to high, blowing right on me, but really, all it was doing was blowing hot air on me.   Before I'd gone to my bed today, I'd bid on a couple of items on eBay, two cassette tape box sets, and I later won them both. I got Steely Dan's "Citizen Steely Dan" box set (contains their 2nd album through their 8th, all of their best stuff), still sealed, for just $8.89, and I got The Police's "Message In A Box: The Complete Recordings" (features every song The Police ever recorded), also sealed, for just $7.55... awesome deals!  Mom went out tonight and bought a new fan for her room, which I assembled it for her. That turned into a major pain in the ass after I accidentally dropped it and a piece snapped off. It was a bitch getting it back together, but after much struggling, I managed to get it done.   I took a cold shower a little bit ago and am sitting here in a towel. It is freaking humid in this mother. Most of our windows are open, but there is absolutely no breeze out there at all. It rained a few minutes ago, just for a few minutes, which is not nearly long enough. It's just icky here right now.

        The Heat Miser Vs. The Fat Man   Man, what a lousy night. I went to bed around 12:30am last night, read for a bit, and then I tried to go to sleep. Didn't happen for me. My mind was racing again and I just couldn't get settled down, mentally, even though physically, I am completely beat. After struggling for a long time, I got up around 4am, and then went and watched TV and played around on the PC.   Around daybreak, on my way back to bed, I noticed the A/C was making a funny sound so I shut the A/C off but it still made the strange, off-kilter sound. That's when I noticed the fan was switched to "on" instead of "auto", so I shut it off too. Big mistake. When I tried the A/C again, it went on outside, but no air blew through the vents inside. I think the fan that blows the air into the vents snapped a belt or something.  So... I have no air right now and it is warm and humid in here (I think the word is "sweltering") with the inside temperature up in the high 80's. This  sucks . My Mom called the A/C guy and he's supposed to come by today (around 5pm probably). He came by the other day when Mom called about the strange noise (which I hadn't noticed), but while he was here, it did't making the sound. Figures, huh?  So besides not sleeping all night, I'm now dealing with a hot, stuffy house. Being a fat guy, I am not loving life right now. It's very uncomfortable in here. I'm going to head on back to my darkened room in a few minutes and lay under the fan. I may wind up falling asleep as well. Really, there's little else I can do right now.

        Jobs And The Jobbed   I thought I was going to stay up all day today, but somewhere around 10am, I laid down on the couch to watch TV and that was it for me. Eventually, I got up and went to my bed, where I slept until nearly 5pm.   The rest of the day was spent playing on the computer and watching TV... pretty sad. You'd think I was living the high life, but there is very little happiness to it. I don'trowing money and I don't like not knowing how or if I'll get through each week, each month. I  need  a job,  badly .   I'm going to try and hit the sack shortly. I'd like to be up around 9am tomorrow. I have a lot of job hunting ahead of me and I've decided not to settle for a crap job, no matter what. I'll sell or pawn stuff if I have to, but I refuse to work for less than $7 an hour ever again.   I used to think people on unemployment who refused to take any available job, were bums, abusing the system, but now I understand: The corporations have won and you either surrender and work for crap wages or you buck the system. Wages have not risen accordingly with the cost of living, and minumum wage? What a joke! Compared with the economy 40 years ago, minimum wage should be $10 an hour. Sounds like a lot perhaps, but when you compare it to how much CEOs and other big executives are taking home, it's a mere pittance.   Consider these facts:   urlLink  The average CEO pay went up 35 percent in 1997 to $7.8 million, according to Business Week's new executive pay survey. That comes to $150,000 a week.  Average worker pay went up 3 percent last year - all the way to $424 a week. Workers still earn less in wages, adjusting for inflation, than they did in the 1970s.  The average CEO made 326 times the pay of factory workers last year, up from 209 times factory workers' pay in 1996. Back in 1980, when many more workers were unionized, the wage gap was much smaller: CEOs made 42 times as much as factory workers.    Like a bunch of pigs at the trough...  The corporations are exploiting us, plain and simple. And it's not just us, but workers worldwide. They ship our jobs overseas, good, solid jobs, and then hire people who will work for much less than American workers.   This is one of the problems I have with voting for John Kerry this election; we've gotten to this point in the hands of the Republicans  and  Democrats. Both parties are in the pockets of corporate America, which is why we have no universal health care in the U.S., the wealthiest country in the world. Every election year they hold healthcare in front of voters like a carrot before a mule and as always, it never becomes reality.  I'm really thinking hard about voting for Ralph Nader again. Only a strong third party can break the grip these two parties have on our country, and the only way to get a strong third party is to support and vote for it. Unfortunately, Nader has distanced himself from the Green Party and is running as an independent, but being tied to a party doesn't really matter, his election would still have the same effect on our political system. I think it would cause massive reforms and the lock the two major parties have on our government would be broken.   Ahhh... can you hear the freedom calling?

        Up All Night/Down All Day   I didn't think I was going to be able to stay up all night, but I did. Now comes the hard part: staying up all day, which is always a struggle for me (mind-versus-body). I'll be worthless the rest of the day now (not that I'm usually very useful or anything).   Unfortunately, I just got some bad news: the position at the school that I've been hoping to get (and the main reason I stayed up all night) has officially been filled. Mom just called me to tell me as I was writing this. I will need to start looking for work again as soon as possible.  Fuck.   I should have just gone to bed last night. This is very disappointing news, very discouraging.   Is nothing ever going to work out for me? Ever? It sure as hell doesn't seem like it.

        Aw, Shit.   I stayed in bed until nearly 3pm today. Why? Because I started thinking about writing a book or a movie or something and once my mind starts exploring all the possibilities and the ideas get flowing, there's no getting to sleep until my mind tires out.   My alarm went off at 11am but I (mostly) slept through my alarm. At some point I decided I might as well sleep as long as I could and then try and stay up tonight and tomorrow, since I'm trying to get up earlier anyway (so I'd be ready for the school job if I got it).   About that...  The guy in charge of hiring for the job was supposed to call my Mom today and let her know whether or not the position got filled or not (they know each other). Well... he never called, so I still have no idea whether or not I have a shot at the job. Ugh! That job would be perfect for me too, just the job I need to get my life back on track.   *Sigh*

        Two Days Of Nothing   I've done very little these last two days. I played a lot of "Age Of Empires", worked in my room a little, goofed off on the PC, read, ate, and watched TV. That's pretty much it.   I was up around 11am today, earlier than the previous few days, but not early enough. I need to be getting up around 8am, just in case I get a shot at the school job (I find out tomorrow if it's open or not). If the position is filled, than I have to start up the dreaded job search again... ugh!  Speaking of looking for jobs, I talked to JP today and he said he just got laid off (from the same place that laid me off). The boss there couldn't be more of a dick. He knows JP's wife is pregnant (with their first child) and what a bad time it would be for him to lose his pay, and more importantly, his insurance. But then, that's just how is is nowadays. We're being exploited by the greedy corporate scum and there doesn't seem to be anything we can do about it except take it however they choose to give it.   It just isn't right.   Whatever happened to simple humanity? Compassion? Kindness? Too many people nowadays are blinded by greed and have completely forgotten that we are all brothers and sisters under the sun, that we are all a part of the family of man, and we owe it to each other to make sure no one is left behind. Those were once ideals espoused by people from the same generation that is largely responsible for sticking it to us today, the Baby Boomers. Their parents made a better life for them but they couldn't see fit to return the favor to their children (there's a reason they are also known as the "me" generation). Thanks, guys.  If anyone's interested, there's a very concise article on the subject  urlLink here.

        Enough Already   Man, I am sick of being forcefed advertising. I am sick of opening my private email to find spam emails, the same ones, each and every day, sent from a different account each time so that I can't block them.   Idiots... if I don't bite the first or second time, why would you think I'd bit the 203rd time? Enough already!   But just when you think that advertisers/marketers could be no more agressive or intrusive, I see this:   Colossal ads block view of Rome's gems  By Liz Sly   There's a lovely 16th Century church at the top of the Spanish Steps--Rome's premier gathering spot for tourists--but if you're visiting Rome this summer you won't be able to see it.   That's because it's been draped in a giant advertisement for L'Oreal beauty products, the latest in a series of controversial advertisements that obscure the ancient city's monuments.   There's also a big bottle of shampoo covering up one end of the 15th Century Campo di Fiori, an outsized Vespa scooter zooming across a facade behind the Piazza Navona, and the Piazza di Spagna is dominated by a banner promoting coffee.   Soon, Rome's beloved Pantheon, the former pagan temple that has survived through the ages in the heart of the city, will become the first Roman antiquity to be covered by ads.   Cellular phone companies have expressed great interest in the prestigious advertising space, according to Interpromos, the agency that has signed a six-figure deal to promote the marketing merits of the 2,000-year-old domed structure.    How sick is that? Is nothing sacred anymore? I read a while back that some "advertising geniuses" (read: "assholes") are actually trying to cover the moon with ads (with a laser light projector of some kind) and now, I think it'll only be a matter of time before that becomes a reality.   Imagine looking up at the moon and seeing the Nike Swoosh smack dab in the middle of the moon... disgusting.   It seems like people are getting so much more selfish and greedy than ever before... or maybe I'm just now realizing how greedy and selfish some folks are.     I mean, who are these people to think they're entitled do what they want with the moon? Or with the Pantheon? Or with my private email, for that matter?  Bastards...

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  I haven't been listening to much of anything this week.    Watching on TV:  "Fear Factor", "Celebrity Poker", "World Poker Tour", "People's Court", "Judge Mathis", "The Simpsons", "Everybody Loves Raymond", "King Of Queens", "The Daily Show", among others (same as last week). Mom and I watched "Celebrity Blackjack" tonight.    Reading:  I finished "The Hobbit" a couple days ago and last night I started reading "I'm Not Really Here", another book by Tim Allen.    Playing  "Age Of Empires 2".   Downloading:  I downloaded some stuff by Larry The Cable Guy, but haven't listened to it yet.         Jamming:  I've been waiting all week for a call about when we're going to start recording over at Jimmy's (we were supposed to start this week), but I haven't heard a thing.   Working:  This week, I applied with the school board and with Target. I haven't heard back from any place where I've applied yet, other than Arbys (and then I got stood up at my 2nd interview by the manager).     Buying:  I bought the new Wilco CD. I haven't bought anything off eBay for awhile though (I've been good), but Mom and I have been hitting thrift stores with a vengeance. Today, we hit  two  Goodwill stores and  three  Salvation Army stores! I found a ton of books, a few cassettes and some assorted odds and ends.   The hardcovers I found were "Babyhood" by Paul Reiser, "Wampeters, Foma, & Grandfalloons" by Kurt Vonnegut Jr., "The Wandering Hill" by Larry McMurtry, "From A Buick 8" by Stephen King, and "Violets Are Blue" by James Patterson (my niece's favorite author).   For paperbacks and sofcovers, I picked up "The Poorhouse Fair" by John Updike, "Three Tragedies" by William Shakespeare ("Hamlet", "MacBeth", and "King Lear"), "2001: A Space Oddyssey" & "2061: Oddyssey Three" by Arthur C. Clarke, "The Best Of H.P. Lovecraft: Bloodcurdling Tales Of Horror And The Macabre" by H.P. Lovecraft, "Freaky Deaky" by Elmore Leonard, "The Federalist Papers" by Hamilton, Madison, and Jay, "Lasher", "The Queen Of The Damned" & "Interview With The Vampire" by Anne Rice (I have the latter two in paperback already, but these were in much better shape), "The Talisman" by Stephen King & Peter Straub, "Forrest Gump" & "Gump & Co." by Winston Groom, "Jack & Jill" by James Patterson, and "I'm With The Band" by Pamela Des Barres.   I didn't find much for tapes today, slim pickings, so I just bought Supertramp "... Famous Last Words", Peter Frampton "Breaking All The Rules", "McVicar Soundtrack (The Who), Juice Newton "Juice" (ok, so I like "Angel Of The Morning", sue me), The Moody Blues "Keys Of The Kingdom", and Night Ranger "Greatest Hits".  The odds and ends were a new can of tennis balls, two cassette storage cases (the 3-drawer ones), an aluminum softball bat, a splash ball, a candle, a sand art thingy, a canteen, and a few decks of playing cards.   I think I owe Mom about $35 for everything I got today. That sounds like a lot, but I guess it's not too bad considering all I got.    Selling:  Nothing yet, but I really need to get listing stuff soon, or else set up at the flea market. I need to get some money coming in until I get a job and a paycheck.    Eating:  I'm trying to eat smaller portions, but it's still the wrong types of foods. For instance, Mom made meatloaf last night and I had a Stouffer's cheesy potatoe bake with it. Not exactly healthy eatin'.         Feeling:    Mentally, I'm stressed about not working. I really detest looking for work, so that doesn't help any. I'm anxious to get on with things, to get a job and to get working towards some goals... time is not on my side.   Physically, my right foot is still sore (been like that for awhile now), and earlier today (while Mom and I were out running around), my back started hurting really bad. I think I might be aggravating it the way I lay in bed and read at night. I have a headache right now too. Yay.   My sleep schedule is still a bit of a mess. I had been getting up around 10am everyday, but then I slept until nearly 1pm today. I didn't set my alarm because I went to bed early enough, but I have no idea why my Mom didn't wake me up. She knows the job I'm trying to get with the school board requires me to be up at 6am for the first two weeks. If I get that job, that's going to be a major bitch for me. At least it's just for two weeks, then the hours are 11:30am-5:30pm... sweetness.   Planning:  Still planning on finding a job. I can't really plan on anything else beyond that until I get one (money, honey).

        Your Standard Boring Day   I slept for shit last night and woke up tired as usual, only more so. I got up right a little after 10am, then I watched TV and played around on the PC, also as per usual.   The bug lady was due today (our exterminator), so Mom and I waited for her to get here. By the time she had come and gone, I didn't feel much like doing anything... the sleeplessness was kicking my butt.   Mom ran out for Chik-Fil-A, I ate lunch, and then I scraped the laquer off the table some more (I've been slowly stripping it off all week with guitar picks). Shortly after, I tried to take a nap.   I think I slept a little, but then Mom woke me up slamming ice against the counter trying to break it up. I couldn't get back to sleep after that.   I got up and then Mom and I played some poker. Man, I have no poker face at all. Everytime I got something good, I started smiling, big time. Needless to say, she won.  The rest of the night I watched TV ("Fear Factor", "Beavis & Butthead" and "King Of Queens"). I think I'm heading to bed now.   I need to start listing stuff for sale on eBay this weekend, so I should try to get on that tomorrow. I'm still sort of undecided about how to list the tapes I have to sell, but I do have some cards that I can list, including a bunch of Michael Jordans. I just need to get off my ass and do it, like usual.   By the way, still no calls back from anywhere I've applied. Nice.

        Applying Out Loud!   I slept terribly all night last night, sort of half-sleeping my way through it. Then, I woke up a little before my alarm went off. After it finally went off, at 10am, I laid in bed listening to the radio for a bit. I think my band should cover "Sunspot Baby" by Bob Seger, good song.   I wtahced TV and played around on the PC until Mom called around Noontime. She said she could come pick me up, so I got showered, shaved, dressed, and ready to go.   She brought home some chow from work, 2 south-western eggrolls from Chilis and a piece of lemon cake, so I ate just before we left.   The first place we went was Mom's Toyota dealership so she could buy some seatbelt extenders and floormats. One hundred and seven dollars later, we were back on the road. Neither of us could believe that floormats weren't included with the new car she just bought, what a crock that is.   From there we went to the school board building (where Mom works) and I turned in my application there. Now, I just have to wait and see what happens.   While we were there, Mom took me in to her office to meet and say "hi" to her co-workers. A few I recognized, but most I didn't.   I hate when people remember me and I don't remember them. I don't know why I'm bad that way, but I am.  Really  bad.    After we left there, we headed over to Target where I put in an application, sort of. The applications there are computerized so I had to sit there and fill it out. Of course, there's no mouse, so it took me a while to get used to using the "tab" key. It took me about an hour to fill out the application and the 60-question questionaire that ended "the application process". I didn't like the questionaire at all. They asked stuff like "what percentage of politicians do you think are honest?" and a whole host of other semi-personal questions which I thought to be a bit much for a low-paying job. Of course, I didn't see the job postings, the pay, and the requirements until  after  I'd finished the whole damn thing, which included calling a manager over for an interview. Nice.   The jobs all require weekend and holiday work and they pay only $6.25 per hour. I wouldn't have bothered to fill the application out had I known all of that beforehand. I thought Target was supposed to be a good company, not just another greedy corporation that exploits it's workers... I guess not. Damn.   I waited a few minutes for someone to come and interview me and then I walked over to the CD department, found the new Wilco CD, bought it, and then split. I'd wasted too much time at Target already.   Mom was none too happy about the long wait either. Had I know how long it was going to take, I would've told her to go on home and I would've just taken the bus home.   I guess it was good that she stayed, because she took me over to the school where I'm trying to get a job at so I could see how long a walk from the main road I'd have. It wasn't bad at all, no longer than I was walking to my previous job. It's a small school too, which is nice. Mom said she'll know Tuesday whether or not the job is still open. I think it'd be a great job for me. I just hope luck is on my side this time out.

        Wednesday Night Stuff   Somewhere around 2pm, I went back and took a nap (I just couldn't keep my eyes open). I read some more from "The Hobbit" before I drifted off and I slept until nearly 5pm. Man, my bed was comfy.   After Mom got home tonight, I asked her about that school job and she said the guy in charge of hiring told her there was a lady who was being considered for the position, but apparently he didn't think too highly of her. That news gives me a little hope. I'm going to go in and apply for the job tomorrow.    I watched poker with Mom again tonight and at one point we had this conversation:  Me: Do I have a "poker face"? Mom: No. Me: Maybe more of a "poker forehead"? Mom: No. Me: Do I look like I got hit in the head with a poker?  Mom: Yes.  I was in a pretty silly mood tonight. I think the nap did me some good.

        Up (Barely) & Waiting   I started a game of "Age Of Empires" after 11pm last night, a huge mistake, and wound up playing until around 2:30am. I woke up at 10am, due to my alarm going off, and I've been up since. I think I could've stood another hour or two of sleep, easily, because I'm dragging badly. I would love to go take a nap right now. Not just because I'm still tired, but because it's a rainy, stormy day and I love being in bed on days like this.   Mom emailed me this morning about that job I mentioned last night. The hours are 7am to 3pm until July 26th, then it switches to 11:30am to 5:30pm... how perfect would that be? Unfortunately, it looks like the position is about to be filled, but Mom said I still have a shot. She's going to take off Thursday to run me to the School Board and to Costco to put in some more applications.    Man, I hate being looking for work.

        Trying To Get It Together   I went to bed a little around Midnight last night and then read in bed for an hour or so. I tried to fall asleep but I wound up tossing and turning... for hours. It was pretty frustrating.   I had set my alarm for 10am and I slept right through it. I didn't get up until 12:45pm today. Ugh! Too damned late...  I did very little today; watched TV, played around on the PC, and ate. I did look for jobs on the St. Pete Times website, but I found nothing for me there. Mom sent me a job posting for a position at an elementary school down the road and I'd like to look further into that. It pays over $8 an hour, it's only 30 hours per week, and it has full benefits. The only downside may be the hours (too early). I checked the school's hours and regular hours are 7:45am-1:45pm (six hours), but Mom said those might not be the hours I'd work. They also have an after school thing until 6pm, so I might be in luck afterall (if I can get the job, that is). Mom'll find out what the hours are tomorrow.  My money problems have been worrying the hell out of me lately, and then today, to make matters worse, my bank took $27 (of the little I have left) to pay a stupid-ass bank fee. They took out my $6.75 insurance premium from my savings account today, which had the minimum $50 in it (which they could have just taken the $6.75 out of), but being the greedy scumbag asswipes they are, they fined me $27 for going under my minimum and then,  didn't even pay the $6.75 premium ! What the  fuck ? I had almost $500 in my checking account this morning, they didn't have the common sense to just take it from there? Fucking cretins. As soon as I'm working again, I think I'm going to look for a new credit union, one with some common sense, one that actually looks out for their depositors (if there are any of those left).    Speaking of greedy scumbags, I just learned yesterday that the Bay Area Outlet Mall (which is just down the road from me) is going to be destroyed and turned into a Super freakin' Wal-Mart, like we need more of those. Wonderful. Just, wonderful.   What's the world coming to?

        Direction Unknown   I went to bed late last night and then I started reading "The Hobbit" after I got into bed. After I finished Chapter 1, I tried to get to sleep. I had a lot of trouble sleeping and wound up in bed until 1pm this afternoon, way later than I would've liked.  I watched TV a bit ("Celebrity Poker"), ate lunch, and played around on the PC all afternoon. I talked to Mom sometime around 3:30pm, when it looked like a storm was imminent, and she said she could leave a little early to take me in to my Arbys interview at 5:15pm. I got showered, got ready to go, and waited for her to get here. A few minutes after she got home, we left for Arbys.   When I arrived, I asked the girl at the counter if I could see tghe manager, she left and said he wasn't there. I saw the manager I interviewed with on Friday, Don, out back when we pulled in so I asked to speak to him. She went back and said he wasn't there. She was no help whatsoever and couldn't of cared less. I went out back myself and asked Don when the other guy was due in. He said he was due in at any moment and that I should wait for him. Ten minutes later, still no manager. Don came out again and said he'd call the guy I was waiting on, he did that, came back, and said it'd be another 15-20 minutes. I said I'd wait.   All the while I sat there I was thinking about how much I really didn't want to work there, trying to think up ways to get out of it. I realized that since I got my guitar money refunded, I was ok (moneywise) for another couple of weeks. I also realized that I'd only have another $400-something to pay on my bank loan and I could probably come up with that on my own, selling on eBay or at the flea market or whatever. Still, I waited patiently for the manager to arrive so I could be employed again.   I noticed while I waited, that none of the employees smiled, not once in the whole time I worked there. It really didn't look like a happy, enjoyable place to work.  I finally had enough waiting, got up and told the assistant manager at the counter that I had to go, to which she replied (in broken english) that the manager I was waiting for was gone for the day anyway. That was it for me. I was out of there, having decided I no longer wanted to work there.   I felt a little bit of freedom and pride in having left there, but I also felt a lot of doubt and uncertainty about leaving as well.   From there Mom took me to Costco where I tried to apply, but they only accept applications on Tuesday and Thursday, so no luck there. I looked over the want ads while we drove towards home. I saw a couple things nearby I'll need to check out.   We wound up at Denny's, where we had dinner. I had their turkey sandwich, which is not something I'd ordinarily order. I kept second-guessing myself about the Arbys job all through dinner. It's a quick job, but I really think taking it would do me more harm than good in the long run. Still, I need money  now . Like I said before, it's a real dilemma for me.   When we got home, I looked at the phone messages and Arbys had not called. I'm thinking that either the manager never did come in or else he did and said "screw him" when told I left. I'm pretty sure it's the former, and I think I can still have the job if I want it. I just hope they don't contact me in a moment of weakness or I just might take the job after all. Pathetic, huh?  After we got home and got settled in, we ordered another movie from Movies On Demand, "Welcome To Mooseport", which was a huge piece of shit. I didn't laugh even once during the entire movie! It was awful, horrendous! What were they thinking? I don't know who I hate more, the guy who wrote this steaming-pile-of-shit or Ray Romano for having betrayed comedy itself by taking the role. Ugh! Do yourself a favor and stay as far away from this movie as you can, unless you enjoy wasting your life on crap.    I'll be heading to bed within the hour. I'm going to read some more, and hopefully, I'll get to sleep at a decent hour tonight. I need to start getting up early again so I can start looking for a  good  job.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  I listened to a lot of music in Mom's new car today: Los Lobos, The Jayhawks, Bob Marley, Willie Nelson & Friends, and Pink Floyd. Mom said she liked everything I played. I've also been playing tapes in my room and I played my new Al Franken CD (the hilarious "Stuart Smalley" one).     Watching on TV:  "Fear Factor", "Celebrity Poker", "World Poker Tour", "People's Court", "Judge Mathis", "The Simpsons", "Everybody Loves Raymond", "King Of Queens", and "The Daily Show", among others.   Reading:  A couple nights ago I started an Anne Rice book, "Queen Of The Damned", but tonight I brought home "The Hobbit" by J.R.R. Tolkien and I think I'm going to read that instead.     Playing  "Age Of Empires 2".   Downloading:  I downloaded a bunch of miscellaneous stuff earlier in the week, FARKer recommended stuff I'd never heard before.        Jamming:  We played out live last night, now we're supposed to start making a demo. We're supposed to go over to Jimmy's house and record his drums tracks first. Afetr that, we'll probably do the rest of the recording over at JPs. Hopefully we'll have a really nice sounding demo by September, when we're supposed to start playing out again.     Working:  I've applied at several places, had an interview at Arbys and am supposed to go int tommorrow for a 2nd interview. Yay.    Buying:  I don't think I won any eBay auctions this week, but I hit a bunch of thrift stores last weekend and this weekend, spending money I shouldn't have spent (but enjoyed spending nonetheless).    Selling:  Nothing.   Eating:  I need to start back on my diet again. I need to go back to cutting out soda and fried foods, and I need to cut back down on my milk intake. I haven't been hitting fast foods too much lately (other than Chik-Fil-A), so that's an improvement.        Feeling:    Mentally, I'm all mixed up. I'm of two minds about my job situation. While I'm glad that I may have a job again, I am extremely unhappy with the job I may have. I'm afraid I'll be stuck with that job and unable to look for a better job. I guess I'm going to have to take the crap job and stick it out until I can afford to quit there and find something better.   Physically, my feet have been sore all week and my back has been aching too.    Planning:  I hope to have a job this week. After that, I'll need to work on getting a driver's license since I now have a car (Mom gave me her old one). After I get driving, I will be able to find a better job for myself, so hopefully, everything will work out in the end.

        Independence Day 2004   I woke up well after Noon again, then stayed in bed until somewhere around 1pm. It had started raining, so I laid in bed listening to the rain on the roof for awhile.   After I got up, I watched TV a little, played around on the PC for a bit, then cooked myself some hot dogs and tater tots for lunch.   Mom wasn't home when I got up, then I thought I heard her pull up and her car was in the driveway, but she was nowhere to be found. A little bit later, she pulled up in her  brand new car ! She bought a 2004 Toyota Camry (gold/beige)!   She came in and ate lunch and then we decided to head up to my sister's house.   Very smooth car, plenty of room, ice-cold A/C, and best of all it plays CDs  and  cassettes! Sweet! I brought along a bunch of CDs to play, plus the tapes from last night's gig.   After we got to my sister's, her and the two boys came out to see the car and then took a short ride with Mom and I. After we got back, we all decided to go up to my sister's in-law's house to do fireworks.    Austin (my 6-year old nephew) rode up with Mom and I. We laughed and joked all the way up there, trying to out-gross-out each other.   After we got up there, I took Austin out in the yard and showed him those mushrooms that you step on to make the "smoke" come out. He was entertained by that.   I chastized my niece for not bothering to come see me last night. She knew I was counting on her, she told me she'd be there when I talked to her last week, but then she went and blew me off (which does not sit well with me at all). Nobody ever calls her on that shit when she does it, so I made a point to do just that. She was supposed to be getting her hair done, that was her excuse for not coming, and then it turns out she didn't do anything with her hair at all. I just hope she doesn't turn into one of those self-centered people who never considers other people's feelings.   Anyway... it was hot and humid up there and I wound up outside playing with the boys, sweating my arse off. I played basketball with they boys and their dad (I mostly passed the ball) then we went in for chow (Publix chicken, mac & cheese, baked beans, and corn).    After dinner, everyone went outside to do fireworks, but they only did a little bit because it wasn't dark yet. I showed the boys how to make whips out of this one long weed (I don't know the name of it) and they played with their whips awhile, weed-wacking tall weeds. Meanwhile, my sister went looking for skinks.  She may be even nuttier I am. When she came down last night, the first thing she did was hunt through the planter out front looking for lizard eggs. She said tonight that she wished she had a place like her in-laws  so she could hunt for lizards and skinks all the time ! I got a kick out of that.   I went in after a bit to cool off and wound up playing some of the tape of last night's gig for Doug. He knows JP and said he couldn't imagine him singing, plus he's never heard me play guitar, so I played some of it for him. He liked it a lot. He said "I Had A Girl" reminded him of Led Zeppelin or Pink Floyd. We sat out there until it got dark enough to set off the rest of the fireworks.   The sunset up there was beautiful, with pinks and blues jutting out from behind tall trees... really nice.   Most of the fireworks were pretty boring, but the boys had fun doing them with their dad and grandpa, and Doug and I had fun teasing Dana (my niece) and joking with the two grandmas.   After the firework show was over, we went in for a little bit to cool off, and soon after, we all decided to head home since it was getting late.  Jesse (my older nephew) wanted to spend the night, but I didn't think it'd be a great idea since I have a job interview tomorrow and since it'd be harder for my mom to drive him home during the week. We told him he could come down next weekend, then my younger nephew said he wanted to come too. I don't know if I want both boys down next time, even though my sister is pushing for that. It's too limiting and I get worn out too fast.   The drive home was both awesome and a pain-in-the ass. The pain-in-the-ass part was that Mom took a different route home and there were toll booths up the ass. I shelled out $3 for those stupid tolls. Bastards!   The awesome part was the fireworks. It seemed like every direction I turned, there were fireworks going off in the sky. On one side of the road, I counted seven different fireworks shows going off. There were more on the other side of the road, as well as some straight ahead. It was awesome! Almost all the way home there were fireworks going off on every side, near and far. Awesome, just awesome.  I had a really nice day today, I hope everyone else did too.

        The Gig   My sister came down, alone, for the show. My niece was too busy getting her hair done to come down. My sister, my Mom and I ate Chik-Fil-A "sammiches" for dinner and then we headed over to the club.   The first band was just finishing up when I arrived, so I had to start loading up almost as soon as I got there. My guys had been there for awhile.   We only had about 20 people there to see us this time out, although we managed to keep a good portion of the first band's people there until the end of our first set. My friend Rob was supposed to have been there tonight but he backed out again. This time he said his wife was ill, last time it was him that was ill.  Here was our first set: "Opportunity Knocks", "Stuck In The Middle", "Promise You The Moon", "Love The One You're With",  "The Authority Song", "You Can't Run", "Had A Girl", "Wild Night", "Safe In My Arms", "There For Me", "Steal My Kisses", "The Breakup Song", and "The House Is A-Rockin". Everything turned out pretty well, except a few notes here and there (no major disasters like last time).   During the break I went and sat with my Mom, my sister, and a few friends from my Mom's work.   I had Mom tape the show for me tonight. For me and for Al, who has a friend over in Iraq that wanted to hear what Al's band sounded like. I'll make a copy this week for Al to send to the guy.   Here was our second set: "(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love & Understanding", "Sleeping Forever", "Badge", "Better", "Yesterday's Girl" (I didn't fare too well on this one, neither did JP on vocals), "Cold Shot", "I Got Loaded" (probably the best we've ever sounded this one), "Come On Let's Go", "Feelin' Alright", and "Fell In Love With A Girl". Other than "Yesterday's Girl" being a bit sloppy, we did pretty well on this set too, no major disasters yet again.  We cut the second set short by three songs because the manager told us he needed us off by 11:15pm, rather than 11:30pm as we were told. That manager...  The last time we played there he tried screwing us on the money but he eventually made good. Tonight, he split before we were offstage and then the owner wanted to make a new deal with us, less money for us, of course, disregarding our agreement with the manager who booked us. After some discussion, he finally made good too, but man, how uncool and unprofessional. JP had even given the manager a chance to negate our agreement last week, after he found out that we wouldn't have very many people there, but the guy said "no, that's alright". I don't think we're going to play there again. I know I said it before, but this time I think it's definite.     I stayed late there with JP, until about 1:15am. I watched the band that followed us for a bit (Spot Lucy, good band) and drank a Heineken. I forgot that JP and his wife bought us each a shot during our first set (Lemon Drops?), and man, was it strong! JP also brought some cokes with rum in them for him and I, which I worked on during the first set. I was feelin' alright tonight.   I'm listening to the tape of the show tonight and it sounds pretty good, quality-wise  and  performance-wise. Cool.   I'll be heading to bed shortly. I guess I need to start becoming an early riser again. Costco is open tomorrow, so I think I'm going to go and apply there before I totally commit to Arbys. Truthfully, I'm not looking forward to working at Arbys  at all .

        Pre-Show Stuff   I woke up around Noon again today, then Mom came in and told me Arbys had called. I got up, called them back and agreed to come in for an interview in 45 minutes. I showered, dressed, and headed over.  I interviewed with the manager there and he said they needed a prep person Monday through Friday, full time. That's the good part. The bad part is that I'd have to be in at 8am everyday and I wouldn't even be making $6.50 per hour. No word on benefits or anything either. I have to go back on Monday for a 2nd interview (a lot of hassle for a low-pay job), but it looks like they'll hire me.  I have mixed feelings about working there. I need the money, that's for sure, but I'm not sure I want to work for $6 an hour, especially after making $10 an hour at my last job. I also wouldn't be able to look for a better job if I'm working there 8am-5pm all week long. I'd be locked into the job. Plus, another fast food job on my resume won't help me any. However, the schedule works well with the hours I'd need for my band and I'd have my weekends off to do whatever I wanted. I could always do the flea market thing on weekends to earn extra money. I'm torn.   From there we headed over to Sam Ash, so I could find out what my options were regarding my guitar layaway (that I haven't been able to pay on for over a month). To my surprise, they were extremely understanding and accomodating. They refunded me every penny I paid on the guitar, no hassles whatsoever. I was really impressed and will definitely return there when I have money again.    I got over $388 back from them, so now I can pay Mom back what i owe her and should have a little left over to get me by until I start working. I wasn't happy to lose my guitar (it was a beauty), but at this point, I need the money more. After tonight, we won't be playing out again until September, so the 2nd guitar wasn't a necessity right now anyhow.   After we left there, we went up to a Salvation Army store we hadn't been to for awhile. They had a "now hiring" sign on their door with a list of four positions they were hiring for so I asked for an application there. I was told they had none left. Nice. I bought a baseball and 2 tape storage cases (a 3-drawer case and a carry-case) there. It was $4 for everything.  On the way home from there, Mom asked what I wanted to do for chow and I suggested Lone Star, again, and that's where went.   I had my usual, jalapeno poppers and a cup of chili, followed by a Texas Ribeye and fries. Man, was that good. Holy shit. I had water and sweet tea to drink with the meal. The waiter we had this time wasn't as good as the waitress we had last time, less attentive, but that was our only complaint. Everything else was superb.    I stopped in at Walgreens on the way home and bought two more cassette storage cases (the 3-drawer kind).   It's almost 5pm now, I have to be at the gig around 8:45pm, so I guess I'm going to go try and take a nap. More later.

        Band Practice   JP was a bit late arriving to pick me up tonight, which kind of sucked since we only had a two hour practice tonight, instead of our usual three.   Needless to say, it went by very quickly. We didn't do any jamming, just straight down to business. We worked on tightening up "Badge" and "Safe In My Arms", which we badly needed to do. Hopefully tomorrow night will be a good night for us musically, we're certainly due for one.   I taped tonight's practice, which was good because I think I nailed one or two of my solos, did them exactly how I they should sound. Now I can go over the tape and get them ingrained in my mind.   I need to get as many solos down as possible, and soon, because we're going to start making our demo next week. That's the plan anyhow. We're supposed to go over to Jimmy's so he can lay down his drum tracks (on a digital 4-track) and then in August, the month Jimmy is taking off, Al, JP and I will finish the demo.   Since we're going to be doing all of this recording, it looks like we're not going to be playing this other gig we had lined up (for late July) now. JP and Jimmy said we'll just do it in September. I'm not really unhappy about it. They want a four-hour set from us and that's about all we have right now, so we'd have to play pretty much our entire repertoire, like we did the last time we played there. What sucks about that is, if we get people dancing on one song, we can't really move songs around to keep them there or else we'll end up with a  very slow  last set.   Honestly though, I'm divided by the whole "dance thing" anyway. To me, getting people dancing is cool and all, but so is getting them to sit there,  really listening  to the music. You can get to people through their minds as well, not just their booties. I think that appeals to me much more, which leaves me at odds with the other guys.     Whatever. I'm rambling now, so I'm outta here.

        Thrift Stores   I woke up around Noon today, much later than I would have wanted. I slept badly again last night, up several times to pee (I  am  getting old), and tossing and turning all night long.  I got up, ate, watched TV a little, then showered, got dressed, and was out on the road with Mom by 2:30pm.   First stop was Second Image, a thrift shop down the road from us. I saw online that they were hiring for cashiers so I put an application in there. While in there, Mom started a debate with one of the employess about how expensive their books were compared to Goodwill. I couldn't believe it.   From there we went to Arbys, where I also turned in an application. The manager was there, but he didn't interview me, just accepted it and said "we'll call you".   After Arbys, we headed over to the Salvation Army on Missouri where I found several tapes I wanted. I borrowed $5 from Mom and bought: The Cure "Boys Don't Cry", "Encomium - Tribute To Led Zeppelin", Pearl Jam "Vitology", The Police "Regatta De Blanc", R.E.M. "Life's Rich Pageant", Scorpions "Love At First Sting" (censored cover), Paul Simon "Rhythm Of The Saints", 'Til Tuesday "Welcome Home", U2 "Under A Blood Red Sky", and ZZ Top "Tres Hombres/Fandango" (2-on-1)... sweet!  Mom wanted to hit this other thrift store down the road from there, so we went there next. I found 29 tapes there, some killer titles, but the most awesome part was that they were only $0.25 each! Here's a list of the tapes I bought (a few I have already and bought to re-sell):  The Gregg Allman Band "Laid Back", "I'm No Angel" & "Just Before The Bullets Fly", The Allman Brothers Band "Win, Lose Or Draw/Idlewild South" (2-on-1), "Seven Turns", "An Evening With The Allman Brothers Band - 1st Set", "An Evening With The Allman Brothers Band - 2nd Set", George Benson "Shape Of Things To Come", "Billboard Top Rock 'N Roll Hiits - 1964", Jim Capaldi "Some Come Running", George Carlin "Toledo Window Box", Derek & The Dominoes "Layla & Other Assorted Love Songs" (remixed version), Joe Ely "Dig All Night", Ben Folds Five "Whatever And Ever Amen", Genesis "Abacab", Buddy Guy "Slippin' In", Daryl Hall/John Oates "Abandoned Luncheonette", Journey "Departure", Don McLean "American Pie", Monthy Python "The Final Rip Off" (2-tape set), Robert Palmer "Sneakin' Sally Through The Alley", Bonnie Raitt "Luck Of The Draw", REO Speedwagon "The Earth, A Small Man, His Dog And A Chicken", Boz Scaggs "Middle Man", Smashmouth "Fush Yu Mang", Bob Welch "French Kiss", and Sonny Boy Williamson "Sonny Boy Williamson & The Yardbirds With Eric Clapton"... wow!   I put them on my debit card this time, along with a purple hat I bought for Mom. The total for everything, including a paperback book I'd found (Mario Puzu "The Godfather"), was under $10.00! How cool is that?   OK, I'm off to chow now, leaving for practice within the hour.

        Misery And Worry   I went to bed too late last night and got up too early this morning... I'm very tired, mentally and physically. Physically because of the lack of sleep, but mentally because of my finances and my job situation.   I called the spa place today and found out the hours are no good for me. I'd have to be up at 6am everyday, way too early for me. If I had a gig on a Friday night, I'd be going onstage at bedtime. Same problem with practice nights.   So now I'm debating whether or not I should quit my band and get a good job or stick with my band and get a crappy job. It's a real dilemma for me.   Mom is off tomorrow so we'll probably run around to a few places so I can put an application in (still no reply from HSN), but my choices are very limited. I'll probably end up at Arbys or Burger King... fast food... just what I want to be doing at 35 years of age. I think I'm going to try for Costco first though. It's a 15-20 minute walk to the bus stop every day and then a 20-30 bus ride, but I hear they are a  great  company to work for, that they value their employees and care about them (take a lesson, Wal-Mart), so it's worth it to me to at least try and get in there.  In "Roadhouse Blues", Jim Morrison sang "The future's uncertain and the end is always near"... and that's exactly how I feel right now.

        Sleep Deprived, But Still A-Rockin'   I went to bed last night around 1:30am, read in bed for awhile, and then tried to go to sleep. It didn't happen. I laid there for a couple of hours before finally getting out of bed.   I don't know what's wrong with me, as poorly as I slept the last few days, I should have been out like a light as soon as my head hit the pillow. Instead, I got up, ate, watched TV, and then, around 7:30am, I went back to bed and read some more. It rained a lot today and I managed to fall asleep, but then the thunder started up and I was back out of bed around 12:30pm. I tried to watch TV, but wound up sleeping on the couch. I slept until 4:30pm. I woke up tired still, even though I should be plenty rested. I just can't get a solid night's rest anymore, where I sleep straight through the night. I get my sleep in bits and pieces, like tablescraps, which only leaves me hungry for more. Something's not right with me.  I did nothing worthwhile all night. I didn't pull, scan or list any cards. I didn't do any cleaning, vacuuming, laundry, nothing. I ate, watched TV (I finally saw "Road To Perdition" tonight, good movie), played guitar (while watching TV), and bid on some eBay auctions.   One of the auctions I won is a 10-tape box set of standup comedy (David Letterman, Richard Jeni, Brian Regan, John Pinette, and more) which sounds awesome:       It cost me just $9.99 (shipping included) and the seller says the tapes have never been played. Nice! I won a few other tapes today too, a 2-tape set, "The Very Best Of Meat Loaf" (one of the tapes appears to be unopened), for $1.21 and a sealed Billy Joel tape, "Streetlife Serenader", for $0.01. I got them from the same seller so shipping on the three should be about $1.50 (since it's listed as $0.95 each and the seller combines shipping). I've bid on three others from this seller as well (they've got another day or two left on them though).   Last night I picked up a Wilco tape, "A.M.", which is very hard to find on cassette. I paid $2.75 for it, which is probably more than I should of (since I already have the CD and all), but the seller said it was like new and I love Wilco, so...   What can I say? I love music.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  Very little this week.    Watching on TV:  About the same as last week and the week before. Poker shows: "Celebrity Poker", "World Poker Tour", "The World Series Of Poker"; Judge shows: "The People's Court", "Judge Mathis", "Divorce Court", "Judge Judy"; and of course, comedies: "Everybody Loves Raymond", "The Simpsons", "Seinfeld", "The Daily Show", "Tough Crowd", "Curb Your Enthusiasm", "Da Ali G Show", and "Real Time w/ Bill Maher". I also watched some "Fear Factor", and I watched "Fahrenheit 911" twice this week.    Reading:  I finished reading "Cannery Row" by John Steinbeck last night. I'd seen the movie version a long time ago (back in the mid-late '80's, I believe, at my Dad's) and it seemed a bit different than the book, more of a love story, if I remember right. The book is great though, a great story, great characters, and very well written. I'm not sure what I'm going to read next.     Playing  I've cooled it on the games lately.     Downloading:  "Fahrenheit 911".     Jamming:  I practiced with The St. Pete Project again tonight (Santana's band). We went over the three Santana songs we worked on last week ("Black Magic Woman", "Oye Como Va", and "Evil Ways"), "3 AM", "Long Train Running", "Blues Before Sunrise", "Proud Mary", "Old Time Rock & Roll", "Feelin' Alright", "Wild Night", "Moondance", "Message In A Bottle", "Crossroads", and "Every Breath You Take". I threw out "Fire", "Daytripper", and "Sunshine Of Your Love" and we played a little of each. I taped most all of tonight's practice. During the break, a friend of theirs came in and played drums. He jammed with Jon, Page, and I for a bit. It was nice to be able to improv again and most of it sounded pretty good. Of course, as luck would have it, not a bit of  that  got taped. Damn! The bass player, Angus, was talking about how he preferred we play the songs as they were recorded, almost note-for-note, and I let Santana know that that doesn't work for me. I told him I'd be happy to be their back-up guitar player whenever they need me for gigs and practices, but I just can't do the whole cover band thing. Mike said they have a lot of gigs lined up already, so I may be playing out with these guys fairly soon. I'm supposed to play with them again next Sunday. Mike's still finishing up working on the room, so there's no practice during the week this week, like I'd hoped. Jon gave me a ride home again (Mom drove me there).    Working:  I just finished looking through the want ads and it was slim pickings once again. I think I may try to get that Cafeteria Attendant job just to hold me over until something else comes along. It's only 2 1/2 hours per day with no insurance or benefits though. I'd be able to pay my bills and that's it.      Buying:  I've been good on eBay this week, just bought one lot of tapes for $6. I was bad at Best Buy though, spending about $35 on a DVD (Jimi Hendrix "Blue Wild Angel") and two CDs (Los Lobos "Ride This: The Covers EP" and Ray Romano "Live At Carnegie Hall"). I hated spending so much at Best Buy and felt bad doing so, since I owe Mom so much again.    Selling:  I sold a bunch of items this week, mostly low-dollar stuff though. I have about $60-$70 due in. I need to start listing again tomorrow, as I'm down to 607 items in my store.   Eating:  I told Mom "no more pie", so I'm done with Key Lime pie (for awhile, anyway). We had pizza and wings again this week, with soda, even more stuff I should be avoiding. No matter how much I want to start eating better, there's always bad stuff around (and if it's around, I eat it).    Feeling:    Mentally, I'm feeling stressed out a bit still because of my finances and having to look for work. I'm also worried a bit about my band. We haven't played together since July 3rd, much too long. I've asked JP about getting together to jam, but nothing's come of it. It's like these guys don't really want to, or need to, play. I, however, do.    Physically, I'm feeling wore down and tired from switching up my sleep schedule and from not being able to get a full night's sleep. I was woken up early again today (Mike showed up to work on the A/C) and it's kicking my butt. Otherwise, I'm feeling ok.     Planning:  To get a job.

        To The Contrary   It's funny, I thought I had the whole weekend planned out. Here's a snippet from what I wrote on Friday night:   Mike's coming by tomorrow to install a new A/C for us (Mom went ahead and bought the one his friend was selling). I'm hoping he'll be done by 2pm. I have several packages to mail out tomorrow afternoon. We'll probably hit a few thrift stores while we're out too. Sunday I jam with Santana's band again. I'd like to list another 80-85 auctions sometime this weekend. That's pretty much my whole weekend, barring any (unlikely) surprises.    Well, for starters, Mike never came over today. He told my Mom he'll be over tomorrow now. I didn't mail anything out this afternoon, in fact, I didn't get there until about 9:30pm tonight (we just got back from the Tampa Post Office). We didn't hit any thrift stores either, instead, I went to Best Buy and bought a Hendrix DVD they had on sale for $9.99 (tonight was the last day of the sale) and two CDs (Los Lobos and Ray Romano). It still looks like I'll be playing with Santana, but I haven't listed any new auctions. I haven't even pulled any new cards to list. It's been nothing but surprises.   My original prediction probably would have come true if I hadn't of stayed up so damned late last night. I started working on fixing tapes and I wound up fixing over 100 of them. By the time I made it to bed, Mom was getting up. The noise she made out in the kitchen kept me from sleeping at first, I was up to pee once or twice, Mom woke me up to sign for an envelope the mailman had for me, and finally, I got up to tell Mom I wasn't going to be mailing my packages this afternoon like I'd planned.   I finally got some sleep this afternoon but was back out of bed around 5pm, still feeling very, very tired. I'm still feeling zonked out. In fact, I think I'm going to head on to bed (with a book) after I finish here.   I think I am finished here.

        Good Night   I'm not in bed, where I should be, but at least I'm being productive. I've been fixing tapes for the last couple of hours. I have a ton of tapes (about 150 of them) where the little felt piece on the bottom has fallen off. I've fixed about 40 of them so far and am getting ready to start on another 20-25.  These are all tapes I've gotten through eBay auctions, all of my own tapes are very well taken care of and don't have that problem. Besides adding a few more cool titles to my collection, I've also given myself even more tapes to sell, thanks to a tiny dab of rubber cement.   It's been a pretty relaxing night overall. While I worked on tapes, I half-watched/half-listened to "Metal Mania", a couple of specials on The Darkness, and then a few episodes of Beavis & Butthead. Before I started on the tapes tonight, I watched a new episode of "Real Time w/ Bill Maher". I'm so glad it's back on. There really isn't anything on right now though, just infomercials and bad movies.  I think I'm going to finish up this last batch of tapes and then head on to bed.

        Friday   I thought I was going to be able to stay up all day, but in the end, I crumbled. I was in bed reading by 9:30am and asleep shortly thereafter. I kept waking up throughout the day, got up once to pee, and was back out of bed around 5pm. I don't feel like I slept very much.   I had both cats sleeping in there with me for most of the day, Jimmy at my head and Stevie at my feet.  After I got up, I got showered. Mom was home by then and we ordered pizza and wings for chow tonight.   After dinner, I played "Fahrenheit 911" for Mom. She sat through the whole thing, which surprised me. I thought for sure she'd bolt, especially during the blood and gore parts, but to her credit, she stayed put. After the movie we discussed it a bit, but her arguments weren't making much sense to me. She said that "innocent people die in every war" and seemed more outraged at the lady who lost a son in Iraq ("She was all proud of the military until it was  her  son that died") than at Bush and his crooked administration who sent the lady's son off to die for their own benefit. I think my Mom's part of a generation that was taught that the President was someone you can trust, period. I think she's like a lot of Americans who refuse to accept the fact that we are The Bad Guys to a lot of the world, especially in the Arab world. A lot of Americans are in complete denial over this fact. I think my Mom has mixed feelings about Bush, but at least the truth has been presented to her and again, to her credit, she's opened herself up to it. Hopefully she'll do the right thing come November and vote Bush out.   We watched TV together for awhile, now I'm watching it alone. It's almost bedtime for her, and my "day" is just beginning. I'm so messed up. She sent me a new job posting for a job at the elementary school I attended as a kid, a 20-minute walk from here. It's for the Cafeteria Attendant position and I think I'm going to try for it. It's only 2 and a half hours a day, nine months out of the year, but it's a foot in the door, it would pay my bills each month, the hours are right up my alley (lunchtime hours), it would leave my nights free for music. As soon as I'm driving, which I hope to be doing shortly after I start working again, I'm going to get my own band started. I'm getting older and older, time's running out on me, and it's time for me to put  my  music out there. I may continue playing with JP's band still too, but I'll havbe to dump Santana's band since they do absolutely originals at all. I'm just not a cover-band man.   Mike's coming by tomorrow to install a new A/C for us (Mom went ahead and bought the one his friend was selling). I'm hoping he'll be done by 2pm. I have several packages to mail out tomorrow afternoon. We'll probably hit a few thrift stores while we're out too. Sunday I jam with Santana's band again. I'd like to list another 80-85 auctions sometime this weekend. That's pretty much my whole weekend, barring any (unlikely) surprises.

        Up Still   I haven't gone to bed yet, and I'm not sure when I will. I'm pretty tired, but I think I can make it until Noontime at least, not that that'll help me much. I need to stay up until 10pm or 11pm if I'm going to try and change my sleep schedule again. I'd be comfortable doing like I've been doing, going to bed with a book around 3am and then getting up sometime around 1:30pm, if it weren't for needing a day job so badly. I haven't been up early enough to do much looking for work and that's not good. So... I'm trying to change my evil ways, yet again.   Speaking of evil, I watched Bush, Cheney, Ashcroft, and company, the whole lot of them, in "Fahrenheit 911" earlier this morning (don't ask how). I've been dying to see it but I really haven't had the extra money to go to the movies and besides, I have no one to go with anyway. It's a very good film, and powerful, though a little too heavy-handed at times (typical of Moore documentaries). There have been claims made about this fim's accuracy (which have all been debunked or dismissed as nitpicking), but the truth speaks for itself. I'm bothered that so many Republicans are following the partyline and denouncing this film when so many of them haven't even seen it for themselves. You know, this film isn't about Democrats or Republicans, it's about Americans, all of us. The Bush administration has lied to  all of us . They've sent the children of Republicans and Democrats alike off to die in Iraq for no good reason whatsoever. Forget your politics and all of that bullshit and go see this movie. Like I said, the truth speaks for itself. This film is important. It's a "must-see" film if there ever was one, and you certainly "must-see" it before you vote this November.

        Thoughts & Stuff   Mom and I took a ride over to the school and it's not very far from the main road, which is good, but it is a long way from home, which is not so good. I'm paranoid about missing buses (because of numerous past experiences) so I normally only work at places I can walk to if I miss one. My last job was a little beyond walking distance, but then my arrival time didn't really matter. If I miss a bus working at this school job, I would be at least 1/2 hour late and that bothers me.   Also, my back is very undependable, easily strained, and as a Plant Operator, I'd have to do a lot of heavy lifting and reaching and whatnot. If I got hired, I could easily re-injure my back the very first day. That worries me as well. I think I need to stick to looking for office work. I'd probably be happier doing that kind of work as well, but I don't know if I'll be able to find a good office job that will hire me with my lousy resume. I don't have a lot of confidence.  I also can't continue not working, I'll have to find some kind of job, and soon.   I hate being unemployed.   In the meantime, I listed a bunch of cards tonight (I'm up to 583 items listed) and still have about 40 more ready to list.   While listing tonight, I won another tape lot, 18 tapes for a total of $6 (includes shipping). Three of the tapes are still sealed. Here's the main ones I wanted from the lot:  Eric Clapton "Timepieces - The Best Of Eric Clapton" (Still Sealed), Crosby, Stills & Nash "Daylight Again", "Forrest Gump" soundrack, Jethro Tull "Original Masters" (Still Sealed), Van Morrison "The Best Of Van Morrison", Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers "Greatest Hits", Rod Stewart "Every Picture Tells A Story", U2 "Rattle And Hum" (Still Sealed) & "Achtung Baby", and Wet Willie "The Best Of Wet Willie"     There are other tapes by Asleep At The Wheel, Jimmy Buffet, The Cars, Hall & Oates, Chris Isaak, Huey Lewis & The News, and ZZ Top.   Oh, I talked to my sister tonight. Usually when she calls, I'll answer the phone, she'll ask for Mom, and that's it. Tonight when I answered, she asked me "What's going on?" and it threw me. I said "Not much, why?", which threw her. We wound up talking for awhile, which we haven't done for a long time.   She did something really nice for some single-mom with four kids up there. The lady had no money for groceries so my sister went out and bought her a bunch of stuff, which was a great thing to do, especially since she did it out of human kindness and not because she saw the lady's plight as an "in" to push her own religious beliefs (luckily my sister doesn't really have any of those).   That's a giant pet peeve I have with religious charities. If someone needs help, then help them, don't use their suffering as an invitation to push your religion on them. It's false kindness.    I talked to my sister about voting this year too. She's never voted before. Neither she nor her husband pay any attention to politics or to whatever's going on in the world. It's like, if it doesn't cocern them directly, then it doesn't concern them at all. I couldn't live like that, blind to the realities of the world.   She said both of my nephews had lice again, got it from boy at camp. She treated them and all, but I told her we'd probably better wait on having my niece down now. I've never had lice in my life and I don't want to risk it now. I'm disappointed about not having her down now, but money is tight right now and I'm not sure what I would've been able to do with her anyway. Besides, with school beginning next week, she kind of wanted to stay home and get ready for school.   I guess I'm done writing now. I feel like I'm rambling.

        Wednesday Blues   Well... I didn't get to bed last night as planned. Instead, I started a new book ("Cannery Row" by John Steinbeck) and then watched a movie ("Rosencrantz And Guildenstern Are Dead"). I didn't get to bed until nearly 6am, and then I had trouble getting to sleep. I was up around 7:15am to pee and then Stevie, one of my cats, kept nuzzling my hands, wanting to be pet. I managed to get to sleep somehow, and finally got up around 3:30pm. I feel ok and all, which is strange considering how poorly I'd slept.  Mom gave me a lead on a job (two part-time jobs actually: Plant Operator and Cafeteria Attendant) at a nearby elementary school that I'd never heard of. I called there this afternoon to find out what the hours are, but the people I needed to talk to had already left for the day. I need to call earlier in the day (which means I need to get up earlier in the day). Because they're hiring one person to fill the two part-time jobs, the employee would be eligible for insurance. Sweet!   I talked to Jesse, my oldest nephew, briefly this afternoon. He pretty much blew me off. I was telling him about the basketball tickets my Mom bought for us and he cut me off to tell me he had to go take a shower. He didn't even let me finish telling him who was playing. He really needs to learn some fucking manners. Unfortunately, in his home, manners (and consideration, in general) seem to matter very little. He told me to call him back in half an hour. I didn't call.   He and his siblings have things way to easy. They don't appreciate anything, not really. Everything's a given, it's all too easily gained and nothing seems to matter very much to them, which is very unfortunate.   I was pretty unhappy after the phone call to my nephew, little did I know things would get worse.   Mom and I got into an argument soon after she got home tonight. I wanted to see where this school was and I told her I wasn't sure where it was or what bus stop I'd have to get off at so I asked her to take me by there and she began mocking me, like "Mommy will take you", like it's so unreasonable to want to see the place where I'm trying to get a job at. Whatever. She has no idea what a total pain in the ass it is not having a car, and not being able to go where I want to, when I want to, on my own. So, fine, whatever.    I think I'm going to go list some more cards on eBay now. If I can't be happy, at least I can be productive.

        Busy-ness   I've been busy working on my eBay store almost all day today. I started around 4:30pm and have been working straight through up until a few minutes ago. I did stop to eat and also to watch an hour of poker earlier tonight. I pulled and scanned over 100 cards, listed a handful (I'm up to 530 items listed), and edited a bunch of older items. I also got some mailings ready for the post office. I need to list what I can before Friday. As far as I know, my niece is still coming down for the weekend. I need to start cleaning the house sometime between now and then too.   I finished reading Kurt Vonnegut's "Hocus Pocus" last night. It was a pretty good book, lots to think about. It almost lost my attention several times with the over-abundance of details and the way it went back and forth in subject matter and through time, but something interesting would always come up before I got bored. You know, I wish I had someone to discuss books with, especially with books like, this because it seems like there's a lot of things I probably missed, deeper meanings and all. This book begs to be discussed.   I need to take the trash out and then I think I'm going to head to bed, with or without a book, I'm not sure.

        Back To Coolville!   Ahhhh... A/C. Mike managed to trace the short to part of the heat strip, disconnected it, and now we have air again. Sweet! It only cost Mom $25 too, not bad at all. However, I think the reason for the short was because Mike didn't seal the unit up very well the last time he worked on it (he ran out of sealant and tape). The shorted out part is right under a gap in the cover that allowed water to get into the insides. Mom still needs to look into the unit his friend has for sale though, it sounds like a really good deal. It's a better unit, a much newer unit than ours, and will save her money on electricity. It should pay for itself in the long run.

        Sweat City, USA      Ugh! This no-having-A/C shit is killing me. And just like last time, there's no breeze whatsoever. Mike, our repairman, said the unit was pretty much dead ("You can put a fork in it"), but after I told him I didn't think we'd have the money to buy a new unit for a while, he started looking at some way to fix it (or to make it last a little longer). He has a friend with a unit for sale, for $250, and it's supposed to be newer and more dependable than this one. I'm hoping Mom can swing it somehow, but with a new car (and a new-car payment) and me without a job and having to borrow here and there, it'll be rough. In the meantime, I'm back in Sweat City, USA and I am not lovin' it.

        Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  The Police, Duran Duran, Little Feat, Frank Zappa, and Eric Clapton, among others.    Watching on TV:  Still watching a lot of poker shows: "Celebrity Poker", "World Poker Tour", "The World Series Of Poker"; judge shows: "The People's Court", "Judge Mathis", "Judge Judy"; and comedies: "Everybody Loves Raymond", "The Simpsons", "The Daily Show", "Tough Crowd", "Blackadder", "The Young Ones", "Da Ali G Show", and "Real Time w/ Bill Maher", which has finally returned! Yay!   I also played my Monty Python "Life Of Brian" DVD again last night. Mom watched it with me and absolutely hated it ("It's stupid"), didn't laugh even once, which boggles the mind. How do you not find Python funny?    Reading:  I finished reading Kurt Vonnegut's "Slapstick" (strange, funny, and very unique) and started reading his "Hocus Pocus".      Playing  Mostly Blackjack on Hoyle Casino '88, one of the games JP gave me.    Downloading:  Nothing.       Jamming:  I practiced with Santana's band tonight. Mostly we went over three Santana songs (no relation between the two Santanas), "Black Magic Woman", "Oye Como Va", and "Evil Ways". We worked on those for the entire first half of practice (which got off to a late start). After a break, we came back in and played "Moondance", "Can't You See", "Message In A Bottle", "3 AM", and one or two others. We ended a little early tonight too. Mike expanded their music room this week and it's almost complete. Jon gave me a lift home. I'm supposed to play with them again next Sunday, after that, they're going to see about practicing twice a week.    Working:  I'm checking the paper and several websites, but I still haven't anything I really wanted to try for.     Buying:  I've been pretty good about spending money lately. I spent less than $5 at thrift stores this weekend and only spent $4.99 on eBay. That may change soon though, Best Buy has a Hendrix DVD I want for $9.99 and two comedy CDs I'd liek to pick up for just $7.99 each (Ron White and Larry The Cable Guy).    Selling:  I have 518 items in my eBay store right now. I'd like to have it up to 1,000 within the next week or two. I'll probably maintain it at 1,000 since eBay charges me a $0.03 per auction fee each month plus the $9.99 monthly store cost (that's around $40 a month I'd owe eBay).   Eating:  Key Lime Pie, Publix subs, Stouffer's TV dinners (BBQ chicken and potato bake, escalloped chicken and noodles), burritos, fish, rice, broccoli, roast beef, potatoes, pizza, wings, 2-liter of Coke, etc... Pretty rich stuff for the most part. At least my portions are smaller than they have been in the past (usually). I need to eat better, healthier, but as long as my Mom doesn't, it's hard for me to.      Feeling:    Mentally, I feel a little better about my finances since I've been selling cards on eBay, but it's still not good enough and I'm still having to borrow, which bothers me. I'm also a bit concerned about my band situation. It seems like an eternity since I've played with my band. I hate this hiatus.   Physically, my back has been sore a lot lately and my feet always are. I've got a headache right now. I'm also sweating my ass off. Our A/C broke down again today. Grrrr!!! It stopped with a thud too, which can't be good.   Planning:  Still, to find a job. I also need to start cleaning around here in a big way. My cousin Nikki will be down in October (on her honeymoon) so I really need to get cracking on the whole cleanliness thing.
