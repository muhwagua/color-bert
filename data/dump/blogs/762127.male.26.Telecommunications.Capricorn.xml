       Biking Today  Saturday afternoon, I went biking on the Alameda Creek Trails, with my friends Rex, George, and Ruby.  They all met at my house, and we went off biking!  The weather was pretty good, sunny and cool...no overcast...perfect for biking.  The trail is pretty cool, and it's my third or fourth time riding it.  It has a very good varienty of terains, inclines, declines, easy parts, and hard.  Overall, its a challenging yet doable trail.  Some parts of the trail were still soft and muddy from the rain, which made it a tougher ride than usually.  But the next time we all go, we're planning on biking all the way to the Dumbarton bridge!  Rex and George...no more excuses!  After biking, we all had lunch at the house. I baked some Totinos Combination pizza!  My favorite frozen pizza!  Good size, and good price!  Then we played some Sega Dreamcast games, like hockey and Crazy Taxi.  Crazy taxi is so much fun!  If you ever get a chance to play it, I suggest you play it!  After my friends left, I worked on the garage.  I assembled a storage cabinet for the garage, that I bought at Lowes.  I'm trying to clear the garage, before the house warming party in a few weeks.  There are lots of books and boxes that need to be organized, hence the 3 storage cabinets I bought.  It's coming along nicely...but lots to do!  Tonight a few of my friends are going clubbing in SF.  I'm not sure if I want to go, since I'm so tired and broke.  I need to save some cash for Christmas gifts, which is just around the corner!  But why not, I might as well go.  Nothing else to do.

       I feel sore  After almost 2 hours of basketball last night, the aches and pains are starting to kick in this morning.  I'm feeling some soreness in the muscles I haven't used in a quite a while, mostly in my legs.  Running full court non stop was pretty hard and challenging, since we've usually played half court in the past.  But it feels good to get the heart pumping again!   Run to the Far Side  I guess it's good, because there is an upcoming 10K marathon, in San Francisco.  On Sunday, December 1st, it starts in golden gate park at 8:30AM.   urlLink Check it out!   A couple of my friends are doing it, and sounds doable.  I'm trying to get Olivia to join, since she'll be here that weekend!  Olivia loves to run...once a year, that is!  lazy bum! =)  But we're having a family house warming party the day before, so I don't know if I'll have enough energy the next morning to run 10K.  We'll see.   Beautiful Day  Yes, today is a beautiful day.  Despite the rain and cold, it's nice to see everything wet.  It's also fun watching everyone carrying umbrellas to work, and walking really fast outside.  It's also cool watching someone's umbrella turn inside out from a quick just of wind!   Anyone see one yet?  I have my eyes on the lookout! =)

       City Beach  Today after work, my coworkers and I are going to play basketball at  urlLink City Beach !  We've been playing bball outdoors every Thursday after work. Since it's been getting dark early and the weather is getting colder,  urlLink Covad  has sponsored us for 10 weeks at City Beach in Santa Clara!  It's just about 3 minutes away from my work.  It should be fun playing indoors, and City Beach is a nice place!  I need to start getting into shape! again!

       Go Covad   Cool, I just found out today that  urlLink Covad  met their numbers for Q3 2002!  You know what that means...BONUS!  Yes, all employees get a bonus! Well, since they implemented a new equation to calculate our bonus, some complicated equation no one can figure out...we only get 82% of the bonus, which isn't bad!  Since I started working at Covad, not once have we missed our numbers!  So far every quarter I've been at Covad, I've had an extra amount tacked onto my paycheck!  GO COVAD!  Hope this trend continues!

       Simple Fridays  Nothing much happened today.  Went to work, did my thing.  I did have lunch with  urlLink Rex  and  urlLink George  at a Japanese place in Santa Clara.  I ordered the house  special, which included 6 california rolls, teriyake chicken, miso soup, salad, tempura, and vegetables. I couldn't finish my meal, because Rex wanted to split some dragon rolls! If Rex hasn't been to a place in a long time, he'll order more than he can finish, just to make up for the lost time.  One time he ordered a 12 piece family meal from Popeyes Chicken for himself, because its been a few months!  Oh boy!  After work, I came home.  I chatted with  urlLink Dale  for a while, and we were on the verge of going to LA for the weekend, to go try out for American Idol II.  Dale wanted to go, but was hesitant on going, due the long lines already forming.  And the fact that it starts on monday.  I tried encouraging him to just go, and offered to go and try out, too!  Despite all efforts, we ended up talking via Netmeeting, and trying to setup his video conferencing.  No luck.  Tomorrow morning I'm going biking with Rex, George, and  urlLink Albert ...we're going to conquer the Dumbarton Bridge!   We'll see if we can make it!

       Nice and Sweaty!  I played basketball again tonight with my coworkers at  urlLink City Beach .  I'm still not getting used to this full court running, but it definitely feels good getting my heart pumping again.  My team won 3 of 4 games, not a bad night.  The 4th game, everyone felt too tired to run, so my team pushed ourselves, and won on fast breaks.  After 2 hours, I was sweating like a pig!    Dinner at the Louies    After bball, I had dinner at my friends' new home in EPA,  urlLink Mark  and  urlLink Diana .  Every Thursday or so they have "Arts and Crafts" night, where someone cooks dinner at the house.  This week my friend Johannah cooked cashew chicken, with green beans and onions! But she forgot to buy cashews!  It turned out really delicious and yummy!  Good job  urlLink Johannah !  We also had icecream for dessert!  We watched Friends, which actually wasn't too great of an episode.  Seems they're running out of ideas!  It may be their last season!   Wedding Fever!  Tonight we also found out that our friends  urlLink Nina  and  urlLink George   urlLink  are engaged!  Nina told us the whole story, and it was really sweet how George proposed!  I won't go into detail, but it was a great story!  I'm really happy for the both of them, and they're such a great couple!  They've been together for almost 5 years! Nina got a fat shiny rock on her finger!  Good job George, and Congrats to you both!  Yes, for some reason, a lot of my friends from Santa Clara are getting married!  Next year, I know of 6 weddings planned!  What's going on here?  There's definitely wedding fever among my circle of friends...and many keep asking me when Olivia and I are next.  We'll, when Olivia asks me, I'll say YES!  =)  BTW - I miss my girlfriend  urlLink Olivia .  She's now a Matlab programmer!

       8th Grade Class Reunion in the Works  I graduated from Elementary School 10 years ago!  Class of 1992, Our Lady of Perpetual Help, Daly City!  Organizing a reunion for our entire class is a side project my friend Glenn and I are toying with.  Glenn came over last night, and we called up a former classmate, Monica Vasquez.  Wow, I haven't seen her or talked with her in 8 years! We called her up, and talked for over an hour. It was great talking with her, and finding out what she was up to.  She's finally in love and married, working for a company called "Marsh", and bought a new home!  We all caught up with what we've all been doing, and it was nice to re-unite via phone, with someone you spent your early elementary days with.  It put a smile on my face! =)  She's now officially part of our planning committee, and will help in the research and searching of our former classmates at OLPH!  We were all excited about the idea, and are looking forward to it...hopefully sometime early 2003.  Monica wanted to have pretty invitations and make party favors!  Wow, Glenn and I could use someone like that to work with.  She had a few good ideas, too!    We're even going to invite Mrs. Lucett, our 8th grade teacher!  She currently teaches 8th grade at OLPH!  And our former principle still drives the same brown Trans Am, and parks in the same parking spot!  Memories! Can't wait to see what happens!

       Serendipity  Yes, I finally watched the movie Serendipity!  After hearing so much about this movie, I finally watched it on DVD.  WOW!!!!  What a great romantic comedy! It's officially my new favorite chick flick movie of all time.  I immediately feel in love with the characters, Jonathan and Sara..and their whole story of fate!  John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale were terrific together! Kate Beckinsale is my new favorite actress...she was yummy with that english accent!  BTW, was that her real accent or fake?  Either way, she was hot! (not as hot as olivia, btw)! =)  It was also cool seeing the places in NYC where the scenes took place, because I recognized a lot of it from my trip to NYC a few months ago!  Like Central Park, the icerink, the subway...all those typical New York things. Overall, I just thought it was a very sweet and clever movie!  It just makes you believe that there is such a thing as FATE!

       Lazy Sunday  Don't you just love lazy Sundays?  I stayed in my pjs for most of the day.  Great football games today, too!  Niners whooped some bootie!  They're doing really well this season, and it's great having a home team that wins!   Go Niners!  My garage project is coming along, still organizing all our junk!  I still have shelves to put up for all our books.  For lunch, I cooked top ramen after Olivia mentioned what she was eating...top ramen!  Yes, Healthy!!! Oh, that reminds of what Olivia saw today!  Well, you'll have to find out in her journal if she decides to share her story...but boy oh boy, I couldn't stop laughing! =)   Another girl friend  Whoa, having a personal website takes a lot from one's day!  I mean a lot!  Before you know it, a few hours pass by, or even a whole day is gone, all towards a website!  That's the main reason I stopped working on my old website. My old site took so much from my day, I didn't realize how many hours had gone by...just to create a cool looking website.  What ends up happening is that the site only last so long, before you're tired of it, the layout or look...that you start all over again!  Yes, an endless cycle.  But I must admit it is fun!  I do enjoy making a website, putting up pictures, journals, pages, layouts, etc.  It's fun trying to be creative, and putting a part of yourself online to share with the world.  I just don't know how long I can keep up with this site, and how much more of my time I'm willing to sacrifice towards it.  It's like having another girl friend!  That is definitely something I don't need.  =)  But until Olivia gets back from NY, I can spare some time making a website.  I give myself a week or two.   Fruits of my Labor  So my day resulted with some a few new things.  I added a "Search by Name" menu, to search for friends within my photo albums.  You can search by a friend's name, and see all the pictures I have of them. I also added some old pictures I had from my old old website, and new albums as well.   urlLink 61 Albums now!   With Olivia's help, I was able to get the pictures from my NYC visit up!  Thanks for resizing the images Olivia!  She found a great program that does batch image resizing, so I could resize my digital shots.  So I resized a bunch of pics, and ftp them to my server.  I also threw in a simple random image script to add some color to my gray looking site. And that's about it.  The fruits of my website labor!  I'd say I spent about 5 hours today.   Why?  Why do I do this, you may ask?  Actually, I asked myself that.  You might say personal satisfaction...but deep down, I honestly think all I want is for someone to sign my guestbook or add a comment to my blog!  It's exciting when you see that comment counter have a number next to it, or a new entry in your guestbook.  Somehow, it makes it all worth while!  0 comments bite!  I'm sure there's a whole psychology behind personal websites and blogging...someone should write a book.  I'll be the first to read it.

       Nikki's House Warming Party  My highschool friend  urlLink Nikki  threw a house warming party, for her new apartment in S.F.  George  urlLink  and  urlLink Charles   urlLink  met at my house around 2pm, and I drove to the city.  Oh boy, when we got to Nikki's place, there was so much food! George, Charles, and I haven't seen so much food in a long time, that we said our hellos, and dug right in!  We weren't expecting a feast, but a feast we got!  All sorts of filipino dishes! Lot's of meat dishes, too!  I ate a lot, but I think Charles ate the most!  Mr. Charles times 2!  Nikki's place was pretty nice, 2-3 blocks from  urlLink USF , great location.  A bunch of her family and friends were there.  A few of my SHC friends went, like Justin Lee,  urlLink Christina Devera , and her bf Domingo.  It was nice seeing them again, and catching up, like good old times.  It's amazning, but we all agreed that we all look the same.  Slight changes, but each one of us hasn't changed too drastically.  I still look the same.  We all look the same!  We also gave ourselves a tour, since Nikki was busy entertaining her guests.  We went into Nikkis room, and Charles, the joker he is, decided to take some pictures of us with her camera.  It was just lying there, so we took some funny shots of us around her room.  We can't wait when she develops her roll! =)   Chess  After the party, I drove home and played some chess with  urlLink Ben , my little sister's boyfriend.  I must admit, I love chess.  I'm not great, but its fun learning strategy an attacks.  I beat Ben maybe 4 out 5 times, on the average. I like it when he puts up a fight, and actually pins me into Checkmate.  Most of the time, it's careless moves that give me the win.  I just need to play more, and get exposed to different styles.  I'm so used to playing Ben, and his opening game.  Anyone out there want to play?    Lot's to Do  Sunday I have to start preparing for our family house warming party a week from today!  Lot's to do!   - Clear the garage - Vacuum the house - Clear boxes - Setup chairs - Buy Groceries - Setup decorations and Xmas lights - move furniture - clear my room.  But I can't wait to see all my family and relatives I haven't seen in a long time!  Cousins I haven't seen in years!  Hopefully the weather is nice, and they all make it!  I love family reunions!   4 Days and counting   urlLink Olivia  comes back home in 4 days!!!!

       More Exercise  I played basketball again at City Beach with my coworkers.  Only 8 showed up, so we had to do more running than usual.  We played 4 games, and had about 20 minutes to spare. For some reason, as much as I try to stay active, I can't build up stamina.  I should start watching what I eat! Too much fast food and frozen dinners.  But they're  so convenient, tastes good, and affordable! But yes, I should stop ordering fries!   Headache!!!!  My head was throbbing when I got home last night. And it was painful.  I'm assuming it was because I walked outside the gym all sweaty, and I wore shorts and a t-shirt. So I took some tylenol, and went to sleep around 9pm.  I feel better now.   Up so Early!  It's about 5:30am, and I'm awake!  It's because I slept in so early. Usually I'm in bed around midnight, so now my whole schedule is off by 3 hrs!  Instead of falling asleep around 1pm today during work, I'll feel sleepy around 10am today.     Counting the Days!  Olivia is flying back this wednesday, for the Thanksgiving Holidays! I'm counting the days!!!!  I should try to find one of those counters, that count down the time.  =)

       Tennis  After work, I played tennis with  urlLink Johannah  at the  urlLink Santa Clara University  tennis courts.  Courts are for students and faculty, but luckily my little sister  urlLink Audrey  is a Sophomore at SCU.  I borrowed her student id card to get in.    Boy, I haven't played in a few years, so I was a bit rusty.  Johannah was a beginner, so she gave me a chance to warm up and find my stroke.  She was pretty good and we had some good rallies. I had a good workout, and a nice sore tennis elbow!  There were these 3 little mexican kids, that would steal our balls that went over the fence.  It was funny watching them and their technique, trying to be sneaky and smooth.  They would seemingly run towards the ball's general area...and just stand by the ball for a brief moment, look around to see if anyone was looking. One would continue to play, while another kept a look out.  The 3rd would bend down slowly, pick up the ball, stand back up slowly while looking to see if anyone saw him...then with ball in posession, they ran.  I watch this technique twice!  I had 2 balls stolen by them, and I didn't mind.    But the 3rd ball that went over was actually a new ball...so I knew what they were up to! When they started working their way towards the ball...I waited.  I waited for the moment the 3rd kid would bend down.  Right when he was about to pick it up..i said, "Thank you!" and waved my racquet indicating that it was my ball.  I know, I'm mean.  But hey, it was a new ball!   The Bachelor  I watched the Bachelor finale tonight.  I think he made a good choice.  The girl was pretty, down to earth, in tune with her emotions towards the guys and more importantly with herself. It was cute how he proposed, and you could tell that she was the right one for him.  I predicted they'll last a year or two.  They're coming out with The Bacholorette!  That should be intersting!

       Busy week at Work  So far Monday and Tuesday at work has been pretty busy. My manager assigned me to work on the ATT Worldnet project, since they're now offering DSL services through Covad.  Well, we got our requirements late from ATT, which pushed our schedule back.  So I had to stay late on Monday to finish up the work and test our deployment to production. Petty stressful, but it went well, despite the last minute code changes and requirement docs from ATT.  All is well that ends well.  That's work!   Updated my Albums  Olivia has been reporting bugs in my website. She is my website quality assurance person!  When you search someone's name, sometimes pics of others show up.  So I had to fix what I could...but too many pics to go through.  But thanks for all your input Olivia.  Other than that, just playing around with some drop down menus...example on the calendar page. But no time to put that together.  Oh well, come back next year!   Oh No!  I'm getting lazy blogging now.  I missed yesterday.  I predict I'll be a weekly blogger soon!

       Conquering the Bridge    Saturday I went biking with  urlLink Rex ,  urlLink George , and  urlLink Albert .  Today we decided attempt to bike to the  Dumbarton Bridge.  It's been our goal since we started biking, and I'm glad to say that we finally biked all the way OVER the bridge!  Yes, we reached our goal and pushed ourselves over the Dumbarton!  We biked from my house, through the hills, to the bridge, over the bridge, and finally back to my house!  It actually wasn't as bad as we thought, and was quite doable.  But we've been biking almost every weekend, so the conditioning helped!  I'd say we biked around 18 miles.  Albert, was pretty good for his first time biking with us. But he has an $800 Specialized bike, which was lite and soft.  My bike was free, which Olivia won in a raffle at Berkeley.  I like it and it works well, but after lifting Albert's bike...mine felt 4 times heavier.  I shall start looking for a new bike!   Eat Fresh  After biking, we had lunch at Subway, eat fresh. We then came to my house, and played some basketball, 2 on 2.  Saturday was a non stop workout, I swear. But I'm burning fat and working my heart, so I'm happy about it!   Shelves  After they left, I finally got around to building some book shelves in my garage.  I still have about 5 boards to put up, but it's coming along nicely.   Party  Da urlLink  rren and his housemates threw a party last night.  Pretty crazy party, I knew about 10 people or so.  Lot's of random people walking in and out.  It was fun hanging out, until someone decided to through some fire crackers/flares at the house.  We were all inside, when we heard this big BOOM, and saw smoke.  Someone opened the door, and then another BOOM hit.  I swear it felt like we were under attack!  Everyone was shocked, and started to freak out.  One SCU alum, Adela, was walking to her car, and almost got hit by the firecracker.  She actually got a burn behind her ankles, and fell to the ground. The cops, ambulance, fire trucks all came by immediately.  That's when everyone left and the party ended.  Rex and I stayed for a little after the whole madness.  I finally got home, it's about 3am.  Wow, crazy night.  But that how Darren's party usually turn out.

       No Music  My mom borrowed my car on Monday, to do some shopping for the house warming party on Saturday.  So I took her car to work.  She never told me her car stereo is busted, so I couldn't listen to music or my AM stations in the morning. Yes, I listen to AM now...news and sports.  But wow, driving without a radio is tough!  I ended up singing to myself to make my drive faster.  "Cuz I'm freeeeee...freeeee fallin!"  Don't know why, but I sang that all the way to work. Same line over and over, cuz that's all the words I know.   Grandfather's Clock  My mom has gone shopping crazy this past month.  Buying stuff for the house.  She bought a huge Grandfather's clock, something she claims she always wanted.  "But you'll inherit this when I die!  You're the lucky one!" she exclaimed when I asked her why!!  Wonderful, I'm going to have a grandfathers clock someday!   Olivia's coming home!!!  Tonight I'm picking up my girlfriend from the Airport! She's back for the Thanksgiving Holidays! I'm excited, it's been over a month since she last came!

       3 Year Anniversary Today!  Today, December 4th, marks the 3-Year Anniversary of Olivia and I!  Happy 3 Year Anniversary Olivia!  14352!  3 years ago, Olivia and I were in Berkeley, hanging out one weekend.  That evening, we were starving, so we decided to go along Ashby to find a place to eat.  Being the college students we were, on a budget, we ended up going to our favorite fast food place, Jack in the Box!  This Jack in the Box was cool, because it had a bullet proof drive-though.    We both love their 2 tacos for 99 cents, and their 99-cent Jumbo Jack, so we ordered our meal.  That night, I was planning to ask her to be my girlfriend, because it was the 4th, one of Olivia's favorite numbers.  I had it all planned out!  Well, during the day, we joked around about how we should be officially boyfriend/girlfriend.  We've been dating for quite a while, but never had that official title.  I joked around, about how I wasn't going to ask her.  "It's the 21st century, and women seem to be dominating the world.  So the only way we'd be official, is if she would ask me!  The girl should ask the guy!"  So that's what I told her, jokingly. =)  The night was winding down, and I was planning to ask her after dinner. As we were driving out of the bullet proof drive through, she asked me if I was going to ask her!  With one of my tacos in my hand, and my 99 cent Jumbo Jack in my mouth, I teased her by saying, "No, you have to ask me!” and took a huge bite of my burger.  In the back of my mind, I knew I was going to ask her.. but I loved teasing Olivia about it!  As I took another bite of my Jumbo Jack, she said to..."Alan, will you be my boyfriend?"  I swear I almost choked!  I was so surprised!  I didn't expect her at all to ask me!  Well, at first I said, "NO! You weren't supposed to ask me!  What are you doing!!!" She replied, "Well, since you're not going to ask me, I'm asking you!"  So I said "Yes!  I'll be your boyfriend!"  I confessed "I was going to ask you after dinner, and not with a Jumbo Jack in my mouth!"    So every time I eat a Jumbo Jack now, I remember Olivia asking me to be her boyfriend!  Wow, a woman of the 21st century!  Now our running joke is that I'm not going to ask her to marry me.  It's the 21st century, so she'll have to ask me to marry her!  =)  Happy 3 Year Anniversary Olivia!  I love you!

       House Warming Party!!!  Saturday, November 30th, was our family house warming party!  Finally, the day came and gone!  With all the work and preparation, we got the job done!  We invited all our friends, family, relatives, cousins, aunts and uncles, coworkers, and all.  I guess anywhere from about 150-200 people came, so we had a pretty large turn out throughout the whole day and night!  We had lot's and lots of food, too!  I gained another 5lbs  A lot of my relatives came, that I haven't seen in a long time.  It was great seeing my cousins, and hanging out like good old times.  My grandparents came, and uncle and aunts I haven't seen in a while.  Every five minutes someone new doorbelled and came inside.  My parents invited their coworkers, so half the people who attended I didn't know.  But I met them all, and it was pleasant meeting the people my parents work with.  Olivia's parents and family came, too!  Thanks Auntie Dolly for helping cook the lumpia!  My mom appreciated your help!    The priest from St. Anne's Parish came to bless our new home.  I picked him up at noon, and he brought his bible and holy water to give a blessing.  With candles in hand, the guests joined in the prayer and blessing, as father blessed every corner of the house with holy water.  Father was really kind and generous with his time and blessings.  He couldn't stay too long, so I dropped him back to St. Annes before 1pm.    I actually had a great conversation with Father when I picked him up and dropped him off.  We talked about the Church, and how he bacame a priest.  I asked him lot's of questions, personal ones, and he shared his stories openly!  I asked if he had a calling to join the priesthood, a kind of revelation or calling. He said no.  Not really.  His family was very religious, and growing up, he was surrounded by family and prayer..so it was a big part of his life.  He remembers as a little 5 year old, his drawings were of Churches, Alters, Crosses, and religious symbols!  When he was a teen, a family friend's son was interested in joining the Seminary, and they asked Father to accompany the son.  He did, and found the Seminary fascinating. Father later decided to join, and his family friend's son didn't.  So he that's how he started.  Back to the house warming party.  We had a lot's of food.  Lot's of guests.  And definitely lot's of fun.  It was fun, especially for my family to have people over to entertain and host.  I played bartender throughout the day, mixing drinks and serving alcohol.   I'm not any good, but it was fun pretending.  I totally re-did our garage, with storage shelves, book shelves, a new bar setup with music and speakers, the ping pong table, fooseball table, and some carpet remnants.  It looked likes a bachelor pad hangout, but the guests seemed to enjoy the garage.   Entertainment  People found ways to entertain themselves throughout the night.  We had ping pong and foosball in the garage.  Also the open bar which I worked for a while...at the same time I acted as Mr. DJ, playing the same 3 cds over and over, Raggae and Disco.  Others played basketball outside, while inside many sang kareoke songs all night long!   No filipino party is complete without Kareoke!  Some even danced!  The kids played board games, thanks to Olivia and her scrabble.  Thanks for bringing all your stuff!  Many enjoyed the variety of filipino foods and desserts.  Many seemed to enjoy socializing with different people, reuniting with other family, and also meeting new people.  And many simply enjoyed seeing our new house and having a tour of the our new home!  We recieved many generous compliments of our new home, and my mom was happy people loved her decorating style.  Even though my sisters and I don't appreciate her taste in Cappo di Monte, and the color gold...we did appreciate my mom putting time and effort into making our house a beautiful home!  As the night came to and end, just my close family was left.  We opened all the wonderful house warming gifts from everyone!  We recieved a lot of crystal bowls and plates, baking ware, flowers, a bar set, vases, gift certificates, and some cash.  We then watched the digital shots I took throughout the day!  Lot's of pictures!!!!   Truly Blessed  My family had a great time, and we all feel truly blessed with all the blessings God has given us.  Sunday morning I went to my parents bed, and we just talked about how lucky our family is.  We are truly blessed, with family and friends, and a new beautiful home.  We were talking about how we ended up here, all by luck and chance, hardwork, and the good graciousness of God.  We talked about the house warming party, and how much fun we all had.  My parents really enjoyed themselves, and seeing all our relatives and friends again.   Thanks again!  Thanks again to all who attended!  Our home is your home, and you're always welcome!

       Holiday Shopping   The Friday after Thanksgiving, is definitely the busiest and craziest shopping day of the year!  I did go shopping, but didn't really buy much.  My mom on the other had, did buy quite a few stuff.  My mom, Audrey, Ben, and I woke up at 5am, and went to Union Landing shopping area.  We shopped at stores like Walmart, Party America, Linens and Things, Micheals, and Longs Drug.  We had lot's to buy for the House Warming party, like drinks and supplies, plates, spoons, forks, and food.  We bought about 50 2 liter sodas, at Longs for only $.39 cents!  My mom bought a TV, 3 dvd players, and some bathroom stuff.  My sister, Ben, and I didn't buy too much.  I just got a shower curtain for my bathroom, since mine is already a year old and needed replacement.  So I was pretty good with the shopping madness!

       Thanksgiving Feast   I spent Thanksgiving with Olivia's family, and had a wonderful dinner!  Olivia's mom prepared a lot of delicious food, like Turkey, mash potatoes, gravy, honey baked ham, bread, and lobster!  Yes, the turkey was good, and so was the lobster! Huge sized lobster!  Yummy!  We also had some crab, brought by Olivia's aunt.  Of course I ate a lot, and I think I gained 5lbs!  I'll have to do some working out!  During dinner, we played some counting games.  One game, everyone had to close their eyes, and as a group, count down from 20 to 0, without 2 players saying a number at the same time!  It was pretty funny when 2 people yelled out the same number!  Every time that happened, we'd start all over. Challenging as it was, we were able to complete the game successfully.  We also played a game called "Bizz Buzz" where you count numbers, and say 'Bizz" for multiples of 5, 'Buzz' for multiples of 7, and 'Bizz Buzz" for multiples of both 5 and 7.  I was elimated after a few numbers!  Too much thinking for a holiday break!  But I had a good time!  I was so full, too!  We  My family decided not to have Thanksgiving dinner at the house, because of the family house warming on Saturday.  Lot's to prepare and cook, we'd just celebrate on Saturday.

       Olivia is Back!   Olivia came back for the Thanksgiving Holidays on Wednesday!  Since she caught an earlier flight, I couldn't pick her up from the airport.  But after work, I went home to pack some clothes, and went straight to her house in Daly City.  I was excited to see Olivia because I missed her!  Wednesday night we basically hung out at the house, had dinner, and watched some t.v.!  I stayed over her place, because I didn't want to drive back to Union City!

       Olivia back this past Weekend  Olivia came back for the weekend from New York.  Flew in Thursday, flew out Sunday night. We had a pretty fun weekend!   Passage to India  Friday, I had a team lunch at this Indian Restaurant in Mountain View, called Passage to India. It's a very popular place among the Indian community, and you could tell when it takes a while to get in, and the buffet lines are long!  Here's a few  urlLink pics    Winter Pops  After work, we watched Heidi's Winter Pops concert at Saint Ignatius high school, SF.  Great performance by Heidi and the rest of the orchestra / choir.  Lot's of singing and instrumental pieces.  Heidi played the piano!  Here's a few  urlLink pics    Saturday Cleaning  Saturday morning, I went to our old old house in Daly City to do some cleaning.  The previous renters moved out, so lot's to clean.  3 Bedroom, 1 bath house for rent in Daly City, if anyone out there is interested!  I had a few friends come by Sunday to see the place, since they're looking for a new place.   Xmas Madness  Saturday night, was Xmas Madness 2002.  Held at Paul Puey's house in Union City... lot's of food, friends, and fun!  We played the White Elephant game, which was hilarious.  Lot's of fun gifts like Thumbtanic DVD, hand cuffs, blowup dolls, Sponge Bob dolls, etc.  Fun night!  Here are the  urlLink pictures !    Sunday Shopping  Sunday, I went shopping with Olivia.  She bought me an early Xmas gift, since I gave her mine early.  Yes, the Microsoft Xbox! I finally got one! Thanks Olivia!  I also bought a few games in Serramonte Game works.  I wanted the Xbox for 1 game, and 1 game only...Fuzion Frenzy!!!  I love that game!!!!!  Olivia had a $25 coupon from Express that she didn't need, so I bought 2 pairs of jeans from Structure.    And now, starting a new week of Work!

       Family Giving Tree  Last night, I meet up with  urlLink Diana ,  urlLink Mark ,  urlLink Albert ,  urlLink Garret ,  urlLink Johannah , and  urlLink Shirley  to volunteer for the  urlLink Family Giving Tree !  We helped sort presents, organized them into bags, wrapped some gifts, and made sure no gifts were missing for the children on the lists.  Oh boy, there were millions of gifts, all donated from generous people!  The entire Cisco warerhouse was full of toys and presents!    Each gift had a tag, which stated the name of the child, their age, and what they wished for Xmas.  Some were really cute!  A small 3 year old girl wanted a doll carriage, so we wrapped her one and threw in a cute doll.  Another boy asked for "anything you have!"  Another kid asked for "something warm to wear".  Some were really innocent and cute!  I liked the kids that weren't greedy, and asked for simple things, like a 'book to read or CD to listen to, and not both.  They ended up getting both!  There were tons of kids that asked for several things, and more expensive items like cd players, remote controlled cars, huge toy sets, watches, etc.  Everyone got what they basically asked for!  Seeing a large number of people volunteering their time for a good cause was nice to see, and put me into the holiday spirit. =)   urlLink I took a few pictures!

       Fuzion Frenzy Friday  I played Fuzion Frenzy on Xbox all night friday, till 4:30am in the morning.  Since my little sister and her boyfriend came home for Xmas break, I finally had others to play with!  This game is only fun with multiple players, because you compete against each other.  They both fell in love with the game immediately, and we ended up playing for hours!  My favorite events in the game are Sumo and Twisted.  This game is the best Xbox game ever!  But yes, I'm losing sleep over it.   SCU Xmas 2002  Saturday, my Santa Clara friends had our annual SCU Xmas gift exchange/ potluck.  This year, Mark and Diana hosted the gathering at their new house in East Palo Alto.  It was lots of fun.  Everyone brought something to eat, and I think I gained back the 8 lbs I lost.  Lot's of good stuff in the potluck!  We played the white elephant game again.  Lot's of cool gifts, like gift cards, dvds, soccer ball, Chia Pet, paper shredder, bar set, edible body paints, $20, and Albert's infamous box of chocolates!  His gift was the running joke of the night...it ended up being the last item!  It's got the "Fruitcake Award of the Year", because last year the worst gift was a fruitcake.  I got lucky this year, and ended up stealing a paper shredder, which I totally needed urlLink .  I took pictures throughout the night, so just look at the pictures in my gallery!     Rainy Sunday  Sunday I didn't do much...raining all day constantly!  In the morning, I played with my new paper shredder!  I shredded anything I could fine, old papers, credit card forms, random misc. paper lying around. Great gift! I also played more Xbox, because I'm addicted to it now.  I haven't played video games in a long time, so now I'm getting back into.  I know, it's bad, very bad!  Takes away from my day and fries the brain, but it's so much fun!  I'll get tired of the games eventually...but till then, I'll keep playing! Also went to mass in the evening with the family.     Ping pong and Chess  After mass, Ben and I played ping pong in the garage.  Did some drills, and played a few games.  I'm awful in returning serves.  We also played some chess.  He beat me once.  I need to buy a clock, because whenever I play online, I get beat pretty badly.  I always end up losing my queen, because the time factor in chess is distracting...makes it a completely different game!  But its fun, I just need more practice with timers.     1 more week!  I can't wait for Xmas break!  And for Olivia to come back!  I want to play some Fuzion Frenzy with her!  1 more week of finals, and Olivia is flying back home!  Good luck with Finals Olivia!

       Week of Christmas!!!!  This past week was full of Christmas Cheer!     SHC Xmas  It started off on Monday night, with my highschool friends.  We had our annual Xmas Gift Exchange / Potluck dinner.  This year we met up at Nikki's new apartment in San Francisco.   We played the white elephant game, which was fun, lot's of stealing from each other.  I ended up with $23 dollars gift card to Target, plus $2.  I love target!    urlLink Here are the SHC Xmas pictures!    Tuason Xmas  I spent Christmas Eve with Olivia's family.  They celebrated with a wonderful dinner and lot's of good food!  We also played the White Elephant game, and I ended up with a really cool hand held food blender/chopper.  The night was lots of fun, as we also played Fuzion Frenzy!    urlLink Here are Tuason Xmas pictures!    Christmas Day  For Christmas Day, we had dinner at home with the family.  Just my family with Mike, Olivia, and Ben.  We had our first sit down dinner in the new house, which was really nice.  We ate Arroz Caldo, Lumpia, Chicken Adobe, Baked CHicken, Bread, Crab Wonton, and Mochi Icecream for dessert.  We also exchanged presents with each other.  After that, we all went to Christmas in the Park in San Jose.  Lot's of people that night, taking pictures and walking around.  Great Xmas decorated trees, too.  We then came back home and played Cranium, a gift given by Olivia to my family.  Olivia and I won! =)  Overall, this was a great Christmas Holiday!  I gained a lot weight, from all the dinners and desserts!  I figured I'd eat as much for the rest of the year, and start the new year healthier.  Till then, I'm getting my grub on!  urlLink Here are the pictures from my Family Xmas    The Two Towers  Thursday, I watched Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship at home.  Great movie.  We decided to watch part two, The Two Towers immediately after part one, so Ben, Audrey, Olivia and I went to Union Landing to watch it!  It was an awesome movie, a lot funnier than the first part.  The opening scene was cool, with Gandulf fighting the dragon.  Lot's of great fighting scenes, too.  The only thing I hated about the movie is that I have to wait another year for the next part.  But I'm definitely looking forward to it!

       Shopping Weekend  Christmas shopping occupied my entire weekend.  I ended up buying more stuff for myself...so so bad!  I bought a snowboarding helmet, to protect my skull from those snowboarding falls.  Also bought a cool rolling backpack, the kind that has a handle similar to luggages.  I'll use it to pack my Xbox for road trips!  I was able to buy some Kris-kringle gifts for my highschool Xmas dinner and Olivia's family's party...so I was a productive shopper. I still need to buy stuff for the family!   Olivia is back!  I picked up Olivia from the airport last night!  She's back for 4 weeks!  We had dinner and went shopping at the Marina Outlets in San Leandro.  We then drove to Union Landing for more shopping.  After that, we had to play some Xbox at my house! Fuzion Frenzy!!!!     Christmas Lights    I finally hung Christmas Lights in Front of the house!  Took me 2+ hours to get the job done!  At night, the effort was worth it.

       Happy New Years!  Happy New Years everyone!  Hope you all had a happy New Years holiday!  I can't believe 2003 is here!  But I'm glad it is...because it's nice to have a fresh start.  Coming up with resolutions are always fun, despite 2-3 weeks into the year, we tend to forget about them.   Resolutions  Just for fun, here are my resolutions for 2003: 1) Eat Healthier (1 piece of fruit or vegetable a day / less fast foods and fried items, less portions when I eat) 2) Be more Active / Physical everyday (stretching, ping-ping, 5 minutes of basketball...something physical daily) 3) Save money (i.e. spend less on wants, just on needs..avoid small items, save up for bigger things) 4) Develop my friendships deeper (keep in touch with old and new friends, make new ones, put more effort into relationships i have) 5) Be more Spiritual (I need to get back to being more spritual, put more effort in attending mass weekly, nightly reflections/prayer before i sleep)  Sounds simple enough.

       Dinner at the Louie's  Last night, Diana invited us over for dinner!  We had spaghetti and bread, which was really good!  We watched the new Friends episode, which was funny!  It's always fun going over to Mark and Diana's house to hang out and catch up with everyone!  Thanks again Diana for hosting! =)   Wedding Fever  Everytime we're there, the one topic that always comes up ...weddings!  Yes, either past wedding, planned ones, and ones that aren't even in the making!  Well, we watched their wedding DVD...which made it a topic of the night.  The DVD btw is awesome!  I have to get an Apple now, so I can get back into video editing, which I was really into during my college years.  I was really impressed with the camera angles and transitions, and their entire wedding!  Nick and Diep were there, and they started to take notes for their wedding in November. I'm sure it must be exciting planning a wedding.  So much work for 1 night!  I think there are about 6-8 weddings going on this year, 2003.  I know I'll be attending at least half, which is quite a lot w/in a year!  It does make me think about my wedding, especially when you hang out w/ friends that are getting married!  Well, I need to start saving up first! =)  Actually, my goal is to have a house first, before I get married.  We'll see...   Mini RC Cars  I finally got a cool Mini RC Car, something I've always wanted.  It was from Nick and Diep, as a belated birthday gift from Hong Kong!  It's so awesome!  The car is tiny, and amazingly FAST!  I get really excited w/ new toys...toys I never had growing up.  Thanks for the gift guys!  Now I can race Ben, who has one already.   Tahoe Weekend  Going to Tahoe this weekend for the first time this season.  I'm looking forward to it, but no looking forward to the drive!  I hope it doesn't rain on the way there!  I hate driving in the rain.

       Crazy Weekend  I had a pretty wild and crazy weekend.   Cable Car Party for my 25th Birthday  I celebrated my 25th Birthday on a Cable Car, through the streets of San Francisco!  With my close friends and family, we partied hard and went crazy!  It was a lot of fun!   urlLink The pictures will tell the rest!    Thank You Email To Everyone  Hey everyone and Party People,  I just wanted to thank you all who came to party last friday on the  Cable Car Ride, to celebrate my 25th Bday! And to those who couldn't  make it, I was hoping you were there with us.  But thanks for all the  emails and all the Happy Birthdays!  I appreciate it!  I must say that it was the wildest and most memorable birthday I have  ever had, despite not remembering a thing from the last hour of the  ride!  It was a wild and crazy night, and I hope you all had as much  fun as I did!    For the first time, I honestly couldn't remember a thing, due to  alcohol..at least what happened in the last hour! I didn't remember how  I got off the cable car, who put me into my car, how I got home or who  drove my car, and where I was in the morning when I woke up!  All I  remember in the last hour were several "Alan, drink this!", "Alan, are  you ok?", and my head in a plastic bag.    I do remember having a crazy time with everyone, cruising through SF,  dancing at Velvet Lounge and Snowdrift, going up on stage with the  band, seeing everyone having way too much to drink, the crazy looks of  my intoxicated friends, taking shots, taking lot's of pictures,  laughing, dancing and screaming, cussing, more shots, slapping people's  asses, and my head in a plastic bag!  (I apologize for my inappropriate  behavior and language, and if I hurt or offended anyone...i was under  the influence of alcohol =)  I had a nasty hangover, and want to thank those that put shots in front  of my face!  You truly are my friends!  When it's one's bday, the bday  person tends to drink what's ever in front of them...so thanks for  taking advantage of me on my special night, and sticking 151 in my  face!  I'll get you all back on your bdays!  Really, I can't thank everyone enough for coming to party, and bringing  bottles to share!  And special thanks to my wonderful girlfriend  Olivia, for setting this whole thing up! You are truly my other half  and my everything! 143  -------- Pictures -------- We took a lot of pictures, which I posted on my new website. Visit  www.alanabar.com to see the pics!  On the main page, click on My  Picture Gallery to view the Cable Car Party Album, and other old school  pics!

       Charanga's for Johanna's 24th  Last night, we went to dinner for  urlLink Johanna's  24th bday.  She planned dinner at  urlLink Charanga's  in San Francisco, in the Mission district.  It was a colorful Caribbean Latin tapas restaurant, with lot's of great dishes.  We ordered a variety of dishes and tapas, like shrimp, chicken, beef, clams, fried potatoes, spinach and blackbeans, etc...and shared amongst the group.  The food tasted pretty good, but it doesn't beat my favorite, Cha Cha Cha's..a few restaurants down the same block.   And yes, we drank several pitchers of Sangria!  By the end of dinner, I had a good buzz, and so did everyone else.   Dancing  Afterwards we went to a local bar a few blocks away, and hung out.  No cover at the door, which was cool.  They even had a DJ playing music, so we had a few more drinks and danced away.  Rick had to get  urlLink Eric  and I a round of Patron, so that put me out of commission!  My head was feeling dizzy throughout the night, but I had a great time hanging out with everyone on a Thursday night.  Thanks Rick!  But last night was fun, and it's cool hanging out w/ Olivia's close friends from Berkeley.  Happy Birthday Johanna, hope you had a good time!  Enjoy the book we got you!     urlLink Olivia  took lot's of pictures w/ her camera, so I'll post those up when she uploads them to my server.   Rick Turns 25th Today...which means more Partying  Today is  urlLink Rick's  birthday, and he turns 25!  Happy Birthday Rick!  Tonight we're going to his place in San Francisco to hang out and play some Kings!  Oh boy...can't wait.  That should be lot's of fun.  Two nights in a row of partying!  Actually, make that 3 because Saturday I'm planning a dinner at the house for Olivia.  She leaves for New York on Sunday, so we'll all hang out again on Saturday before she goes east.

       Dinner at Viet and Nat's  Monday night Olivia and I had dinner at her former coworker's condo in Sunnyvale.  Viet and Nat cooked a great meal...crab, califlower and cheese casserole, fried rice, noodles, and more!  Viet used to work with Olivia at Incyte Genomics, but was recently laid off.  Olivia's other former coworkers were there too, and it was cool hanging out with them!  Thanks for having dinner Viet and Nat!   Layoffs at Work  There was a round of layoffs at work today!  Pretty surprising.  Around 10 or so people in Software Engineering got the boot.  Luckily I didn't get the ax...so I'm really thankful for still having a job. I felt bad for my coworkers who got laid off, because I know some of them had kids, and some I was cool with.  Our company is actually doing well, but we got a new VP of software engineering, and he wanted to make the department even more streamlined.  The scary thing is that the changes that just happened will be evaluated again at the end of the quarter, so even more may be voted off the island.  Wow, what I wouldn't do for some job security these days.  At least I still have my job...for now.

       Tahoe Weekend  I had an awesome weekend!  Took my first trip of the year to Tahoe for some snowboarding!  We went to Boreal for the day, and I must say it was the best snow I have ever seen!  Lot's of fresh snow and powder, which made it easy to do turns! The snow was soft and fluffy..so my falls weren't too painful. And there weren't so many people this weekend!  Possibly due to the football games this weekend, there weren't as many people as I expected.  I totally didn't mind, and I wouldn't mind going again this weekend since there are NFL conference games!   Circus Circus  After Boreal, we headed to RENO to stay the night at Circus Circus.  We all went to play some games at the Midway in Circus Circus, which was fun.  We used the coupons given to hotel guests to play some games.  I won a small ducky.  After that, we basically gambled the night way.  I ended up winning $50 at Black Jack, and stopped gambling the rest of the trip.  That basically paid for my lift ticket and hotel.  So all I paid for this weekend was gas!  I love winning $!   Pictures  And of course, I took pictures!  With a digital camera, and lot's of space on my webserver...why not!   urlLink Go picture happy!

       Wine Collecting  Just from reading a few articles on wine, I have started an interest in wine.  Wine in itself is an art, and only through time and experience can one truly appreciate good wine.  Despite my complete lack of knowledge in wine, I wouldn't mine learning more about the different kinds and tastes, the history behind wine making, as well as the different makers.   What better time than the present to start, I say.    So I went to Cost Plus last night just to look at the different kinds of wine, and I got really excited looking at the endless selection.  I didn't know where to start, or what to look for. Being as ignorant as a rock, I just started looking at the different brands.  I read through the different labels, since some makers put a little history of themselves on the back.  I of course noted the prices.  Some bottles were amazingly expensive!  I saw a bottle for over a thousand bucks, and only being a 1995 bottle.  Others were pretty affordable, which I may start off buying, and work my way up.  I think it would be fun collecting bottles of wine.  All the 2002 wine are relative cheap, and I can only imagine how much value it would be worth 5, 10, 20 years down the line.   So in 2022, a bottle of 2002 wine would sound really old!  I ended up not buying anything. =) I figure I'd read up on wine and get educated first, before I start investing.

       Be Careful driving on Sunday  Lot's of talk on the news and radio about how dangerous it is driving after the Super Bowl game.  Since a good number of people will be intoxicated, emotional after a win or loss, many drivers will be a little more careless behind the wheel!  So be aware everyone!     urlLink Interesting article on the topic

       Go Raiders  I watched football all day Sunday.  Wow, Raider's are going to the Super Bowl!  I'm glad to see them in the Super Bowl, first time since 1984.  It should be a fun Super Bowl to watch!  Go Raiders!   Olivia back in New York  Sunday morning, I dropped off Olivia to the airport, as she headed back to New York for her second semester.  It’s sad seeing her off again, since I spent a whole month with her during her Christmas break.  I love it when she’s back home.  Well, she has 2 more semesters to go, and hopefully she's be done in a year.  You better study smart Miss Tuason!  But I'll be flying out to NY for Valentines weekend.   Dinner Party for Olivia  Saturday, Olivia and I invited our good friends to the house for a small dinner party, to hang out with Olivia before she left for New York.  Olivia and I cooked dinner, which consisted of our usual dishes (baked chicken, pasta, garlic corn, fresh bread, and a broccoli and mushroom casserole).  We had a great time seeing everyone again, and hanging out.  Throughout the night, we ate dinner, took turns playing bartender and mixing drinks in the garage, played nonstop Fusion Frenzy on Xbox, competed in a round of Cranium(guys vs. girls) which the girls won easily, and played more Fuzion Frenzy!  I swear, my friends are the competitive type...they love to compete!  For Cranium, we agreed that the losing team takes a shot created by the winning team.  So throughout the night, the guys kept chanting, "151, 151, 151" every time we won an event, telling the girls what they would if they lost.  But the ladies ended up winning, as usual...and the guys paid the price with a drink created by Diep.  We called her specialty "Diep's gasoline."  It was nasty.     urlLink Well, here's the pictures from the night.   Thanks again to everyone for coming!   Rick's 25th Birthday  Friday night, Olivia and I went to Rick's place to celebrate his 25th birthday.  By the time we got to his place in San Francisco, he was already gone!  He had a company event, which had an open bar, so he took advantage of it.  So when we came over around 9:30pm, he was ready to sleep.  We did play a round of Kings with some Sangria, and I ended up picking up the last king.  Great!  Fun night.

       Long Week  This was a pretty long week for me.  But it went by fast!  TGIF!  No major plans for the weekend.  Diep's 25th bday dinner at Miyake's and dancing at Q's in Palo Alto on Friday.  Saturday, no plans.  Possibly dinner for Rowena's bf 25th bday.  Sunday, I plan to sleep.   Dinner w/ Former Manager  Last Tuesday night, my coworkers and I went to dinner w/ our former manager, Natalie.  We met at her new house in Livermore, that she just purchased.  Wow, I must say that it was a beautiful home, around 11K+ square feet for the lot, and 3500 sq/ft living space.  She has a huge backyard, which I fell in love with, big enough for a pool or basketball court!    Wente Vineyards  For dinner, we went to  urlLink Wente Vineyards  Restaurant, a few blocks away from her house.  The place was beautiful, and dinner was awesome.  Despite spending $50 for dinner, I think it was worth the meal and environment.  I brought lunch the rest of the week.  =(   Wine  We didn't have wine that night, because it was too expensive for a bottle, and more for a glass!  So the following day, I bought 3 bottles of wine for myself, at Cost Plus.  I bought a bottle of Robert Mondavi 2000 Merlot, Olivia's favorite.  I picked up a bottle of 2001 Beringer, a White Merlot and a Chenin Blanc.  All in all, I spent less than $20.  I have started my wine collection. =)   My Parents need a new Car  Thursday night, my dad's car stalled after work, and I had to pick him up in San Leandro.  Our 89 Toyota Celica is having a tough time these days.  Battery keeps discharging, no more power, stalls, and lot's of repairs.  I think my dad finally had enough, and is thinking of buying a new commuter car, possibly a Toyota Corolla.  I suggested the new Honda Accords.    End of Year Reviews  I had my end of the Year Review w/ my manager on Thursday.  It went well.  Good feedback, and good ideas on how I can improve.  I just hope I get a raise!  =)

       Monday, Monday!  New week at work, and lot's to do already!!!  I've been getting more assignments and small projects to work on, ever since layoffs last week.  It's all good though, since it keeps me busy and pays my bills.  I'm trying to pay off all my debts, the biggest debt begin my car.  I don't enjoy paying banks interest, so I'm trying to pay off my car w/in the next 2 or 3 months.  I got a 3 year loan, and my goal is to pay it off in 2 years.  April 17 would make it two years, so that's my deadline.    Gotta Start Saving  After my debts are gone, I have plans for something big!  So I gotta start saving!  I think Olivia knows what I'm talking about!  =)   Flag Football  Super Bowl Sunday was a fun day.  It started off w/ some Flag football with the Summer Madness crew.  We played a good game of Flag Football at Hall Ranch Park in Union City.  I had a great time, and luckily our team kicked some bootie.  I caught a few passes,  made a few defensive plays, and accidentally ran into a girl giving her a nice bruise on the arm.  Sorry about that, it was an accident.  I did jam my thumb, and as of now, I still can't move it.  I think it may be broken, but I'll give it a couple more days to heal.    Super Bowl Game  After the game, I hung out that Paul's house to watch the Super Bowl game.  It started off well, but ended up poorly.  Horrible game, just horrible!  And frustrating to watch!   Raider's lost, and that's all I got to say about that.  Go Niners!   Tiffany's 25th Birthday  Last Friday night, I went to Glas Kat for the first time, to celebrate my friend Tiff's 25th birthday.  We got hooked up at the door, so we didn't have to pay the $15 cover.  Yeah, I love hook ups!  I never knew it was such a big asian scene, but it was cool...good music.  Took a bunch of  urlLink pictures , as usual!   Can't Wait  I can't wait to fly to New York again, to visit my girl friend.  I miss having her around, so I can't wait to see Olivia again.  Finally got tickets for Valentine's weekend!

       2 miles  That's what I jogged last night after work.  And guess how long it took me?  Almost half an hour!  Well, I just started to run, preparing for the San Jose Mercury 10k in 2 months.  That's about 6.2 miles long that I have to prepare for.  At my rate, I should be able to complete that in 1.5 hours.  Believe it or not, that's my goal.  Most people can do it in way less than an hour, but I tend to jog for a little, then walk, then jog, then walk...mainly to catch my breathe.  Plus I'm so out of shape and I hate running.  But it should be fun!   Reality Shows  Tonight I watched The Bachelorette, and Celebrity Mole!  I place my bets on Charlie...seems like a great guy for Trista.  And for the Mole, it's definitely not Erik.  It could possibly be Kathy, but I think it's Frederick.  My bets are on Frederick.   In 7 days  I'll be in New York!  With my girlfriend Olivia!  I can't wait!

       38 Months  Today is my 38th month anniversary with my wonderful girlfriend, Olivia!  Yes, we've been officially together since December 4, 1999.  It have been wonderful having a Olivia as my girlfriend, and life has been so much happier and fuller w/ her as a major part of my life.  Life wouldn't be the same w/out her!  So cheers!  Happy 38th Month Anniversary!  1435!     More Wine  I bought 12 bottles of wine yesterday, to add to my wine collection.  I picked up a few 2000 Merlots, 2001 Chardonnays, and 2001 Cabernet Sauvignons!  All were relatively affordable, ones that I would actually drink.  =)  I spent less than $30 bucks...so not too bad.  I've also been reading a lot about wine basics, so its actually enjoyable shopping for wine now.  Lots of great info online!

       Jet Blue - the only way to fly!  I finally took Jet Blue for the first time last night, on my way to New York.  I must say that it was the best airline experience I have ever had!  I've heard so many good things about JetBlue, and I can finally see why!  Believe the hype that you hear!  Despite the flight being half an hour late, due to weather conditions, the overall flight was great.  As we entered the plan, they passed out headphones.  Each seat has a video monitor for you to watch direct TV!  This itself makes flying JetBlue worth every penny.  I was able to watch the news, basketball games, TLC, talk shows, weather, you name it!  Being able to flip through channels on your own, and not having to share monitors was cool..plus it makes for good personal entertainment and makes the flight seem shorter!  Another cool thing I liked was their visual flight status, which shows the speed of the plane and current altitude.  It shows a map of the U.S., w/ a picture of where the plane is during flight.  Definitely useful information for passengers.  I don't fly too often, so this may be nothing to frequent flyers.  But another cool thing I appreciated was that they gave me a whole can of soda!   Usually on most flights, they'll serve you a small cup of ice, and fill it up...splitting the rest of the can w/ others.  It was nice to be given a whole can!  Another plus of JetBlue is that you are given a selection of snacks to choose from (i.e. chips, chocolate chip cookies, crackers, nuts, etc.)!  Not just peanuts!  The flight attendants were super nice, too!  Very friendly, and it appeared they enjoyed working for JetBlue. They even passed out hot towels to the passengers.   What really topped of the flight, was when they announced that you get to keep the head phones as a souviner of flying JetBlue!  I was impressed!  They're not super great headphones, but they do work!  I kept mine.  They're blue.  I love flying JetBlue!  I would recommend flying JetBlue over any other.

       Cache Creek  On Saturday, I went to Cache Creek with my mom.  We were supposed to go to Reno, but ended up going here instead.  I didn't mind, since it was a closer drive for me.  For the first time, I actually didn't gamble, because of my trip to NY on Wednesday...and losing my NY spending money was not an option!  I did see my grandparents there, and they gave me $20 to play.  I decided to keep it instead, so I came home $20 richer!  My mom won, too!  Cache Creek is in the process of building new things, such as a new hotel, an 18 hole golf course, more parking space, and another brand new casino to double its current size!     Vacaville Outlets  On the way home, we passed by the Vacaville Outlets.  Oh boy, I love outlets!  I bought myself a new pair of casual shoes!  I love finding good deals, esp. named brand items for cheap!  We were only there for 3 hours, which is not long enough to spend at outlets!  Outlet shopping is definitely a full day's activity, not a few hours.   Sunday Mass  Went to Church at St. Anne's w/ my family on Sunday.  We got there late, 12:05pm, and had to stand in the back.  My family can never get to Church early, no matter how much I try, rushing them, or making everyone get ready earlier...we're always late!  Filipino time is definitely frustrating at times!   Rude or Acceptable?  Is it rude to get change from the donation basket?  I saw someone do that today.  Dropped in a twenty, and took a ten.  I didn't mind it since they were still giving a donation.  Plus I think I actually did that once.   All Star Game  Great game!  Going into double over time was exciting.  I'm glad the West won!   Smell of Fresh Grass  That's how I smell because I cut the front lawn today!  I actually enjoying pushing the lawn mower around and inhaling the scent of fresh cut grass.  My favorite part is starting up the lawn mover...pulling that motor cord to start the engine!  I love it when I get it started on the first pull, and hearing the engine go.  My family finally got a gas powered mover when we moved to Union City.  We used to have an electric one back in DC, and I hated mowing the lawn back then.  It required dragging an extension cord around, which was a pain...and I actually mowed over the cord once.  And our old mower spit out the grass to the side as it cut, which required raking!    If you get a lawn mower, get a gas powered one.  I guess the same goes for RC cars, I hear.  Hmmm..I guess I'll never get an electric vehicle.   New York!  I'm looking forward to my trip on Wednesday.  I fly back Sunday night, but since Olivia has a holiday on Monday, I'm going to check if I can stay an extra day and extend my flight!  I hope it doesn't cost too much to do so.

       My Computer Crashed  When I got home from NY, and turned on my computer...well, it just wouldn't boot up.  I usually leave my computer on all the time, so I'm not sure if someone did something to it while I was gone, or a virus crept in and wiped it out!  What really sucks is that most of the files I have on the drive aren't backed up. Files I am concerned about are all the pictures I've taken.  Priceless items.   I've been thinking of getting a new computer, so I guess now would be a good time to start looking around.  But I need to figure out a way to salvage my files.   New York Pictures  Since the trip, I haven't been able to upload the pics Olivia and I took.  Olivia was kind enough to upload them to my server. Thanks O!     urlLink Check them out!

       Great Weekend in NY  I had a great weekend.  For 4 days, I visited my girlfriend in New York for the Valentine’s holiday!  I arrived on Thursday, and left Sunday night.  While I was there, Olivia and I spent some good quality time together, hanging out, discovering new places to eat in N.Y, walking around, taking pictures, holding hands in the cold, watching musicals, and riding the subway!   Musical Weekend  3 Musicals in a row. We watched Cabaret, starring Neil Patrick Harris, former star of Doogie Houser M.D.  He did an excellent job performing his character, something you wouldn’t expect out of him.  Also in the show was the father in Happy Days, Tom Bosley.   We then watched Lea Salonga perform in The Flower Drum Song.  She did a good job, and sang very well.  This show reminded me of PCN, the singing and dancing, the transitions between scenes, and especially the whole theme of remembering and embracing our culture.    We also got a chance to watch Chicago, starring Kevin Richardson of the Back Street Boys.  Olivia watched the show already, but was dying to watch him perform.  I thought he was ok. The show was pretty cool…but of the 3 shows we watched, I loved Cabaret!   I recommend watching this performance!   Eat, Eat, Eat  While in New York, we did a lot of eating.  We went to a place call Dallas BBQ, which had the best baby back ribs.  Located new Times Square, we ended going here because Virgil’s was a 1.5 hr wait.  Virgil’s is definitely the best, but Dallas BBQ was great, for half the price!  $9.99 for a full slab of baby back ribs!  We also ate at this Belgian Fries place, which had some great fries!  I love fries, and if I ever opened up a fast food place, it would be similar to this place.  They had different sauces and dips, and we tried the Belgian Mayonnaise.  Not bad!  While in China Town, we ran into this cute little restaurant, with $4.50 lunch specials.  I’d come here everyday for lunch if I lived in NY!  The one place I wanted to go during my visit was Serendipity!  I loved the movie and never got a chance to go the first time I visited.  I had the Frozen Hot Chocolate, and it was delicious!  I have never tasted anything like it!  It was their signature dessert, and I can’t wait to have it again!  Suggested by Johanna, we tried this place called Café Con Leche, a cozy Cuban restaurant.  Oh boy, I had the Rabo Encendido, which is the Cuban version of Oxtail Stew.  Every bite was enjoyable and tasty, I’m hungry thinking about it!   Small World  I did run into some familiar faces.  Anne Lopez, who was a year older from SCU, happened to be at the same subway station.  She was there w/ her boyfriend visiting New York, and I haven’t seen her since she graduated in 99.  I also saw Jason C., from USF.  We saw him at the Flower Drum Song musical.  He was also visiting w/ his girlfriend.  Yes, it’s a small world…it amazes me sometimes how small it is.   Glad to be Back Home  New York is a great place, lot’s to do, great places to eat, endless shows to watch, and cheap transportation!  I wouldn’t mind living there for a year or two, but I do love the Bay Area.  I love California, especially the weather.  In CA, you don’t need to worry about snow, and if you wanted to see snow, you simply drive to Tahoe.  I did miss driving a car, too…since we took the subway or taxi to get around most of the time…or lot’s of walking.  The weather was a bit cold and freezing for me, but it was fun wearing a scarf and gloves and several layers of clothing.     Big Storm  Luckily I left before the big storm hit.  My flight home was delayed about 1.5 hrs, but I got home safely.  It was my first time to see a plane get defrosted.  JetBlue had these 2 large cranes, w/ power jets that sprayed down the plane to remove the heavy ice build up before take off.  I had a window seat next to the wing, so I watched the whole thing. Pretty cool stuff.  Both my parents stayed up till 3am watching the news and waiting for my arrival.  Now that I’m back home, I do miss New York, and especially Olivia.  Thanks for a great Valentine’s weekend!  Can't wait to visit again in April! Hopefully it'll be warmer! =)

       ESP  After reading Olivia's experience of having ESP, I experienced something similar today.  Well, more like powerful thinking.  We had a company All-Hands meeting today in the cafeteria.  I sat in the 2nd row, so I had a pretty good view.  While the CEO was speaking, I was just noticing the cool setup the IT personal setup for the presentation.  They set up two large video projector screens, microphones and speakers all around for everyone to hear, a video camera for employees across the country to watch, several laptops for the presentations, an amplier and sound system, and all handled by this one guy.    I was really impressed w/ the setup, and w/ him managing all this technical setup.  And I thought to myself, "What kind of power system is he using to power all this equipment?  He probably has a really good power surge protector type device to manage all these electronic devices, and the power necessary to run it all!"  And then I thought, "What if he got a cheap dinky power strip that would blow a fuse during this meeting?"  I swear, 10 seconds after that thought, everything turned off!  The video projector screens went black, the speakers popped as it suddenly turned off, and our CEO had a surprising look on his face, wondering what happened.  And I turned to the IT guy behind, flipping swithes and turning knobs trying to get everything back up.    I thought to myself, "Wow, did I do this?"   Either I have powerful thoughts that turn into reality, or our IT department bought some really cheap power strips.

       Jayme’s 2nd Birthday  Saturday was my friend Rowena’s daughter’s 2nd birthday party, in San Jose.  Oh boy, did I feel old!  Lot’s of little kids running around, screaming and yelling, having a good time.  Jayme had an awesome birthday party, with a large inflatable slide in the front of the house, a piñata full of candy, authentic Mexican food cooked fresh on the grill, and a candy bar w/ Jayme’s picture as a thank you gift!  I don’t think I ever had such a cool birthday party when I was small.  The fun part of the party was when all us guys went into the inflatable slide, and started jumping around.  We tried running up the slippery slide, getting some good laughs. We eventually played king of the mountain!  We wrestled each other like little boys, and it reminded us that we were still young at heart.  After a few rounds of king of the mountain, we all had to catch our breath, which brought us back to reality, of how old we really are.  Happy Birthday Jayme!   Kitchie Bowl XVIII  Friday night I went to Kitchie’s 28th Birthday party at Sea Bowl in Pacifica, for some bowling fun!  It was fun bowling and hanging out with all Kitchie’s friends.  My first game I bowled a 76.  Second game I hit 121.  I was really trying to spin the ball, and almost got the hang of it!  My wrist still hurts from bowling.  Happy Birthday Kitchie!

       My Cousin Morris  I recently found out my cousin Morris from the Philippines is here in the U.S., travelling for the first time to America for a newspaper conference in Seattle.  I haven't seen him since 1994, when my family last visited the P.I.  Well, he finally arrived yesterday to Seattle, and we had a chance to speak briefly last night.  He's here for a week, so my family is going to try to fly him to California to visit, as soon as he's done.   It should be fun seeing him again, since its been almost 10 years.  I remember him as a little 10 year old, and now he's a huge 20 year old.  Time does fly.  In August, my family on my mom's side are all planning to visit for Abby's wedding.  That is one family reunion I'm looking forward, too.  Abby's wedding is the first among all our cousin's on my mom's side, so it's a pretty big thing.  Can't wait!

       Tahoe Weekend w/ my Highschool Friends  This weekend I went on a Tahoe Trip with my highschool friends, for some snowboarding action and cabin fun!  We rented out a cabin, which was pretty cool, and very close to Sierra.  It was a great weekend, and I had a good time hanging out w/ my old highschool friends. It was cool getting to hang out with a few new people, too.     The Drive Up  So Friday night, we drove up to Tahoe.  My friend George drove, so I rode w/ him, Ruby, and Charles. We left pretty late Friday evening, waited for the traffic died down, so we had a smooth drive. But the drive up was pretty fun.  We just started chopping it up, gossiping about anything, catching up, playing car games, telling jokes, and sharing puzzles/riddles.     The Cabin  On the way there, my friend Nikki called us up, and we ended up meeting the girls near Davis, to join their caravan.  It actually started to snow a little bit in the mountains, and the girls had to pull over and get some chains.  Luckily George's truck was big and had some all weather tires.    We got to Cabin around 11:30pm, and made some good time.  When we drove up to the cabin, the driveway was full of snow!  The guys had to shovel the snow out of the way, to fit the four cars.  It's tough work shovelling snow, and I'm glad that I don't live in a place where this is a daily chore.    The Cabin was pretty cool  There were 3 rooms, 2 baths, 7 or so beds, a complete kitchen, and living area space to chill.  So that night, we claimed our beds, and luckily everyone got a place to sleep.  No one had to sleep on the floors.  We all hung out in the cabin, having late night snacks and catching up w/ everyone.  I brought the Xbox for us to play, and we ended up playing Fuzion Frenzy for hours.  Everyone seemed to enjoy the game, especially playing the event, Sumo!  It was Paul's favorite game, only wanted to play that all night.  He was pretty good in the game, until George and I stepped in and bumped him off the edge.  =)  We went to sleep around 4:30am!   Sierra  4 hours later, we got up and started getting ready for Sierra.  We has some breakfast: waffles, cornned beef, and rice!  Yum.  There weren't too many people at Sierra, so the lifts went by pretty quick.  The snow was not too bad, but not as good as I had hoped.  Not enough fresh power the night before, so the snow was a slightly hard, but not too bad.    We all started the day off together for the first run.  But since everyone had different skill levels, we ended up splitting groups half way down the first trail.  So throughout most of the morning, I boarded w/ George, Ruby, and Charles.  We eventually caught up with the girls before lunch.  Most of the girls were beginners, learning to snowboard and do basic turns.  I tried teaching them how to carve, the way I learned when I took lessons - putting your front arm in front and pretending your driving technique.  Denise almost had it for a while, but lost it everything she picked up speed.  After lunch, we all went our seperate ways.  I boarded w/ Paul, Anna, Tyson, and George.  Paul, Anna, and Tyson went skiing and were all pretty good.  We went towards the back of Sierra, where all the good trails were.  The snow was a lot softer back there, and had longer and better runs.  I actually didn't fall to many times, maybe once or twice.  But I actually started to feel more confident, carving down steeper slopes and going slightly faster than what I was comfortable with.  So I had a good day of boarding compared to my past trips, eating the snow.  My new helmet does help me feel safer.   Cabin Fun  After boarding we came back to the cabin to clean up and have dinner.  For dinner, we cooked sphagetti, baked some french bread, and had 6 bottles of wine.  After dinner, the real fun began when we started to play some games.  We started playing those puzzle type games, like Black Magic, where if you knew the answer already, others had to figure it out.  We played "In my world, there are xxx, but no xxx".  This was a lot of fun, and had some many good laughs!  We also played games like "Who am I", where you had to guess who the person is.  And "Bang, Bang, Bang, who's dead?"...where you shoot someone and figure out who's dead.  It was frustrating for some that couldn't figure out the puzzles, and when they did...they were so happy!  Drinking Games We also played some drinking games for fun, after dinner.  We started off w/ a round of Kings Cup.  This was fun, and got everyone started w/ a buzz.  We used the bottles of wine Nikki got.  Denise, the rookie of the game, ended up picking the last King!  She had to drink the King's cup of wine, cranberry juice, and smirnoff ice.  Good job Denise.  We also played "Zoom Zoom, Beep Beep".  Its a game where everyone is in a circle, and when its your turn, you say "zoom" in one direction.  When you wanted to switch directions, you say "beep beep", and start saying "zoom" the other way.  This got pretty crazy, and was so funny when someone messed up.  I wish I had it on video tape, cuz we all died laughing!  After that, we also played Spoons!  Oh boy!  Mofia!!! Then Denise taught us how to play Mofia!  Oh wow, this game is awesome!  It's a game very similar in concept as the TV reality show "The Mole".  In the game, we draw cards, and someone is the designated "killer".  With everyone's eyes closed, the killer opens their eyes, and selects a person in the group to kill.   Then everyone has to figure out who in the group is the killer!  This was soo much fun, and it's my new favorite game!  I can't wait to teach it to my other friends, because we all had a great time playing it!   Great weekend  Saturday night was a lot of fun.  So many games and so many laughs.  I had a great time w/ everyone, and it made me realize how lucky I am to still be close w/ my highschool friends.  Its always fun getting together, and enjoying each other's company, just old the good old days.  Not everyone was able to come, for different reasons, but for those that did, I can see they had a good time.  Its interesting seeing how our circle of friends evolve and change, and how a lot of things never change.  Its also cool how we can not see each other for years, and get together for a weekend and still be close.  Its also cool how we can bring in our other good friends to the group and have a good time.  I wish Olivia came, because she would of had a good time.  She came two years ago, and had a lot of fun.  Hopefully next year we'll have another trip, and everyone can bring their significant other.  Charles...you have a year to meet someone!   Pictures  Since my computer died last week, I can't download my pictures I took.  But I'll post the pictures from the trip soon!   BTW  I miss my little New Yorker!

       Audrey's 20th Birthday  My little sis turned 20 years old yesterday!  That sounds strange to me, that she's finally in her twenties.  Being as tiny as she currently is, she doesn't look like a twenty year old.  One would guess 15 or 16 years old, since she's really short.  It seems people are getting smaller and smaller these days.  Don't know if it's the water were drinking, the food we eat, or if it's genetic.  Well, at least my cousin Morris is having no problem growing! =)   Emmy's Chinese Restaurant  We celebrated by taking her to our family favorite Chinese Restaurant, Emmy's in San Francisco.  We had a nice dinner with the family, including Mike, Ben, Olivia, and Morris.  Morris was finally able to meet Ben and Olivia before he left.  From visiting my website and seeing all the pictures, Morris told me that he felt like he knew Mike, Olivia, and Ben already.  The power of the Internet.  I haven't had Chinese in a long time!  We ordered Wor Wonton Soup, Shrimp Fried Rice, Mongolian Beef, Moshu Port, Roast Duck, Beef Chow Mein, and my favorite Walnut Shrimp!  I'm hungry again thinking about it.   Morris's Trip Finally Ends  Well, my cousin Morris also left last night, and headed back home to P.I.  6 days in California went by in a flash!  Morris plans on visiting us again, possibly after college.  Can't wait Morris!  Hope you had a good time while you were here!  Post the pictures from your camera online, please!   Typical Airport Experience  After dinner, we dropped Morris off to the airport, and waited with him for a while.  When he checked in his balikbayan box and luggage, they were way too heavy!  All the clothes, pasalubongs, and canned goods exceeded the 70lb limit.  So as every typical trip to the International Airport in my experience, we had to step to the side, untie the rope, cut through the tape, open up the balikbayan box, remove the additional 30lbs over the limit, decide what to take and leave behind, and creatively repack the box! Every single time, this happens!  Actually, it was pretty funny.  As much as Morris wanted to bring everything back home for everyone, he had to sacrifice a quite a few things.  We felt bad, so we made him wear some of the clothes and t-shirts, just so he could take them back home!  So he wore several layers of t-shirts, 1 vest, several pairs of socks, 4 layers of pants, 3 hats, 2 briefs, 2 jackets, and 8 panties!  Hahaha!  I'm not sure if I took a picture, but it was a sight to see!  I was amazed at how much clothing 1 person can wear! =) LOL!!!!  Yes, I repeat, 6 panties!  (pronounced pan-teees)  It was cold that night, but I can only imagine how he'll feel when he gets to the Philippines! HOT!  He must of put on at least an additional 20 lbs of clothing.     Olivia is Back!  Olivia arrived back last night, too!  She was able to come join us for Audrey's birthday, and to meet my cousin Morris.  She also came along to the airport to drop him off!  I'm glad she's back for Spring break!  Welcome back home Olivia!  It should be a fun week while she's back!

She'll be back for a week and a half!  We have a Winter Madess Tahoe Weekend to go to.  We'll also attend her coworker's wedding!  More importantly, we'll be able to spend some time together!  Yeah!

       San Francisco Night Life  Last night, I gave a Morris a taste of the night life in San Francisco.  Along w/ Mike and my friends Rex and Gell, we took Morris around the City, to show him a good time.  We started off by having some cheesesteak sandwiches at this place in S.F. We then walked around the Broadway area, giving Morris some eye-candy.  Morris was able to experience some fun stuff.  Ask Morris for details. =)   Golden State Warriors vs Phoenix Suns  Last Tuesday night, I treated Morris to his first NBA game LIVE.  An exciting match up between the  urlLink Golden State Warriors  and Phoenix Suns, these two teams are fighting for the last spot in the Western Conference playoffs. The Warriors, 1 of 3 teams to average more than 100 points/game, proved themselves worthy of a playoff spot by beating the Suns 113 to 98.  With their exciting offensive style, the Warriors dominated the Suns throughout the night.  I think Morris enjoyed watching the game, seeing the Warrior’s run and gun offensive style. Lot’s of great plays, slam dunks, fast breaks, screaming and yelling, and tiny Early Boykins w/ his spectacular plays.    At the end of the game, Morris and I met Thunder, the team mascot.  We also got a chance to watch a close up interview of Adonal Foyle, who earned a career high of 20 rebounds.  Great game!  We got also free chalupas from Taco Bell, for the Warriors scoring over 100 pts.   Summer ^^  I found out about my cousin Veena’s  urlLink website  from Morris.  I spent some time last night checking it out!  Nice site Veena!

       San Francisco Tour  Monday was a big  urlLink San Francisco Tour Day !  I decided to take some PTO from work, to tour Morris around the City! Along w/ Abby, Mike, and my mom, we took Morris around San Francisco's most popular tourist spots. First stop of the tour - the world famous Golden Gate Bridge!  We decided to walk across the bridge, but only half way, which was pretty fun.  Despite the thick fog covering most of the bridge, we took a few good shots on it and the surrounding bay.    2nd Stop was Lombard Street, the Crookedest Street in the World!  We drove through and took some pictures.  We then drove down to the Palace of Fine Arts, and walked around.  We took more  urlLink pics.   That lead us to Fisherman's Wharf, where we walked around and did more site seeing.  We walked to Pier 39, where we had lunch, bought some souvenirs, watched and smelled the sea-lions, took more  urlLink pictures !    Morris wanted to see the home of the San Francisco Giants, so we drove down the Embarcadero and pulled over to Pac Bell Park.  Mike said there's usually free entrance during the day, to tour the park.  Unfortunately it was only on Thurs-Sundays.  We did walk around the entire park, and yes...took more pictures!  After a long day of walking, we called it quits, and headed back to Daly City.  We relaxed and played some PS2.  I then took Morris to the infamous, Serramonte Shopping Center..aka "Serramanila!"   Morris Arrives  Sunday evening, my cousin Morris from the Philippines finally arrived to California for the first time!  After finishing up a newspaper /journalism convention in Seattle, we flew him over to spend some time with the family.  My parents were really excited to have him over, and to see him after 10+ years.    I picked him up from Oakland Airport, and when we arrived at the house, my parents were surprised to see how much he had grown!  We gave him a tour of the house, and had a nice dinner.  We ended playing Xbox all night long!   Lazy Saturday  Nothing much happened on Saturday.  Slept all day after partying at Diana's 25th.  I also washed my car.   Diana's 25th Casino Night  Last Friday, my good friend Diana joined the Quarter Century Club!  She celebrated w/ a casino night at her house in East Palo Alto.  We gambled w/ quarters, played black jack, craps, bingo!  Lot's of fun!  I ended up winning $6.50, mostly from my friend Rex who tried his luck playing dealer.  Poor guys lot's all his money.     urlLink Check out the pictures I took!    alanabar.com Downtime  Apparently my site has been down.  Due to exceeding my allowed monthly bandwidth of 5 gigs a month of data transfer, my server temporarily disabled access.  I suspect its due to my picture gallery, and all the pictures I have.  I may have to disable the search functionality, just to keep my site up.  I wonder who's searching their name all the time....Olivia?!? Rex!?!

       More Running  I ran with my friend Johannah after work yesterday, since she's doing the 10k run on Sunday, too. We met at Bellomy Field, Santa Clara University.  Wow, it makes a big difference running with someone.  Having a running partner helps push you past what you think your limit is.  We ran about 3 miles, which isn't too bad considering how bad I am at running.  We ran, than walked, and ran again...which will be our strategy on Sunday.  It's actually starting to feel good running now.  Gotta get that heart of mine pumping again.  I now weigh ~170-175lbs, so it would be nice to get back to my prime weight of 165lbs.   Half Court Basketball  I'm playing basketball again today with my coworkers.  Since it's now brighter after work, we play every Thursdays after work. We usually play half court, since there's only 1 court and about 20 people.  I don't mind, because its tough work running up and down the court. But it's good exercise.   My Wrist Hurts - time for Katinko!  Ever since bowling for Kitchie's birthday last month, my wrist has never been the same.  It was sore after bowling, and I don't think it ever healed properly.  Now it just hurts.  Maybe tonight I'll put some Katinko that Olivia's mom gave me.  She uses it for everything!  It's the "All-Purpose, Heal-All Aches and Pains, Cure-All medicine" at you apply on any wounds. It works like a miracle.

       Xbox Night  Last night I finally got a chance to play some of the new Xbox games I bought.  Last week I went on a game buying spree, buying a dozen games. DOA Volleyball is fun, I finished a whole 2-weeks vacation with the same partner Lisa.  She actually played with me the entire 2 weeks, because I kept giving gifts.  First time I played, none of the girls wanted to partner up. DOABV is such a great game! Wonderful Eye-Candy.    Running  I ran about 2 miles last night, and I really don't enjoy running.  It's tough when you're out of shape, and you're heart isn't cooperating.  I'm told that it should get easier if I run routinely, but when you don't have any motivation, it's hard.  But since there's a 10k (6.2 mile) marathon in San Jose this coming Sunday, I need to at least run a little before the big day.  My goal is to finish in 2 hours!

       Jimmy and Elena's Wedding  Yesterday, two of Olivia's former co-workers from Incyte Genomics got married! They had their ceremony at a Christian Church in Palo Alto, and their reception at the Fairmont Hotel, San Jose.  Overall, they had a beautiful wedding!  Lot's of colorful flowers, sunshine, beautiful music and singing, plenty of family and friends, delicious food, entertainment, and happy people!  Weddings are always fun to attend! Makes you look forward to your own!  Olivia cried, again!  She tends to get emotional at weddings.  =)  I actually almost cried when I saw the couple hug their parents during the ceremony. Seeing Jimmy very emotional, with the piano playing the background, almost put a tear in my eye.  I really enjoyed seeing Jimmy and Elena happy together!    Congratulations you two!   urlLink PICTURES

       Winter Madness Weekend  This weekend, Olivia and I went to tahoe for the 4th Winter Madness weekend. It was a fun weekend, but pretty tame compared to previous trips.  Nothing too crazy happened worth mentioning. We brought our friend Dale.  He said he had a good time.  Thanks for coming along Dale!  The snow at Northstar was pretty slushy.  Good thing not too many people to were there that weekend, less people to snowboard around.  We took a few pictures.   urlLink WM4   Joey took a bunch of pictures, and posted them on Ofoto.   urlLink Check out Joey's Pictures

       San Jose Mercury 10k  Today I ran the  urlLink San Jose Mercury 10k . With my friends  urlLink Dale ,  urlLink George ,  urlLink Joel ,  urlLink Johannah , and  urlLink Rex  we ran for 6.2 miles through the streets of downtown San Jose.  About ~8000+ runners/walkers participated, and the sun shined creating lot's of excitement. We all had fun, and did pretty well!   Race Results  Here are the stats taken from  urlLink www.RunRaceResults.com . Name                   Age/Sex Bib#  Race Time    Place      Pace/mile Claudale Corpus    24-M      1867  10k  47:24   279/2304  7:38 George Carino       24-M      2118  10k  49:19   378/2304  7:56 Joel Ellazar           24-M      2307  10k  54:06   743/2304  8:42 Alan Abar 	            25-M      2188  10k  1:05:06 1606/2304  10:29 Johannah Portacio 25-F       2257  10k  1:07:01 1718/2304  10:47    Rex Isaguirre         24-M      DNF due to Heat Stroke  Dale, the best runner of the group, did very well!  He placed 279 out of 2304 10k runners, pacing 7:38 min/mile. George ran strong, beating the 8 min/mile pace with 7:56.  Joel ran a pace of 8:42, Johannah a 10:47 pace, and myself a 10:29.  We were all happy with our results.   Post Race Freebies  After the race, we decided to meet by the food booths, to help ourselves to the free food and drinks.  Wow, lot's of delicious samples for the runners: locks and bagel, gourmet sausages, chicken, chips and salsa, apples, bananas, energy bars, bread, milk, blended drinks, water, and a great new fitness water called "Propel"!  Oh boy, did we all stock up on this drink.  It's pretty good!  They passed out plastic bags, and all the guys decided to take a few Propel drinks home.  I think we brought home a dozen each.     Lost 4 lbs.  I probably lost about 3-4 lbs. from the race, but gained it right back with all the free food!   Where's Rex?  We were all enjoying the free food, except for Rex. For the longest time after the race, we looked around for our tall dark bald-headed Filipino friend, but couldn't find him.  We waited at our designated meeting spot, but for some reason, Rex never showed up.  We guessed that he got lost along the path, sprained an ankle, possibly met a girl, or got kidnapped.  So carrying our plastic bags of free Propel, we decided to check the car to see if he was there.   No where to be found  At the parking garage, he was no where to be found!  We couldn't call him, since he left all his stuff in the car, so we left him a message on the car. "Rex, give us a call!" George left him 2 quarters, and we decided to start the manhunt for our lost runner.  Being the good friends we are, we decided to retrace the entire 10k path that we just ran, yell out "Rex? Rex! Rex?!?", hoping that we'd find him along the way.  It was either that or go back for more free Propel.   OH BOY!!!  We decided Rex could wait, and went back for more Propel. =)  Actually, we went back to talk to the Medical personnel on site, to see if he was there.  Dale went up to a medic, saying that one of our friends is missing.  The first thing the lady says is "Are you looking for Rex?"  Apparently he suffered from a heat stroke, collapsed during the run, and was rushed to the Emergency Room in an ambulance.  We were surprised and shocked, and wondered if he was ok. She assured us he was ok, and his body could be found at San Jose Mercury Medical Center down the street.     Emergency Room  So we rushed over to the Emergency Room.  When we got there, Dale walked up to the front desk and said we were looking for our friend.  The first name the nurse said was "Rex?"  How funny she said that, because the EMT said that too.  He must have been a special case or something, since they remembered his name so quickly.   We got a chance to visit Rex in the Emergency Room, with tubes and IVs connected to his veins.  But he was ok.  Rex is a tough guy.  According to Johannah, Rex is now officially a "Princess!"  I took some pictures of the whole ordeal, but we were all glad he was ok.  We learned that he was 1 of 2 people that got injured during the 10k.  The other person was next to Rex in the same room.  During my conversation with Rex about when he collapse, I over heard her say "At least I finished the race!"  Unfortunately, Rex didn't finish the race, but he'll live another day to enter another one.  Glad you're ok Princess.   My Results  I was happy with my results, and I really did push myself to finish as fast as I could.  1hr, 5 mins isn't too bad. My goal now is to do a 10k in less than an hour.  We're all planning to do the Bay to Breakers, San Francisco in May.  So I have a whole month to train!  As much as I hate running, it's starting to grow on me.

I need to start finding some cheap tickets on eBay or Craigslist, so I can watch them play.  Too bad Olivia isn't around.  We went to 20+ games last year, since she got a bunch of tix online for cheap!

       Fun Weekend  Olivia came home this past weekend! We had a wonderful date Saturday afternoon, having a nice picnic at the Marina in San Francisco.  We also got a chance to tour the Maritime Museum, and walk along the Marina.  We even drove through Lombard Street just for kicks. It was very relaxing and nice to spend some quality time with Olivia, since I only get to see her every so often.  We also attended Heidi's performance at SI, a musical called "Chess".  Heidi played the piano superbly!  Saturday was also Dale and Rowena's Wine Party Birthday at Christina's house.  Olivia and I went after the performance, and had a good time seeing our friends.  Sunday, we also had lunch for Olivia's aunt Edna, who turned 50 years young.  We went to Ikow Ikow, a Filipino restaurant in San Bruno.  Pretty good food.  Afterward, we went to Atwater, 2 hours east from Daly City, to celebrate her other aunt's Birthday!  We played Mofia!  I love that game! =)

       Great Week at Work Last Week  Last week at work was a great week!  I gave a presentation w/ 2 of my team members, on the automation suites and tools we've been developing.  The VP of Software Engineering attended, and luckily he stayed for my part.  I felt kind of nervous, but was glad everything went well.  After the presentation, he sent out an email saying how impressed he was w/ the tools and automation out team has, and that we should be proud of the work we've been doing.  So it was nice to get some recognition.  Yeah, got some Brownie Points!  It does help increase the odds of getting laid off!  knock on wood!  Every month Covad also recognizes members or teams w/in the company who demonstrates the Covad Brand, and sends out a newsletter to the company.  Well, our team got recognized for helping the training department setup an environment for training new employees.  Well, my manager assigned me to the project, and I was given some major props from my manager for getting our team nominated and recognized!  More Brownie Points!

       Potluck  My team had a potluck at work today, and I made a broccolli and mushroom casserole.  Most of my coworkers are Indian, so 3/4 of the dishes had curry. My coworkers love spicy food, or anything w/ curry!  I enjoy Indian food, but for some reason, curry gives me g@s.  =(      Great Season!  Despite losing to the Lakers last night, the Warriors had a great season this year.  They have enough talent to make the playoffs next year.  At least they scored more than 100 points last night!  I got free chalupas from Taco Bell!   Marathon Frenzy  So many marathons going on!  All my friends are getting caught up w/ marathons and running.  We just did the SJ Mercury 10k, which was challenging for me but lot's of fun!   Now's there's the Bay to Breakers, SF Chronicle Marathon (4 Person Relay Marathon), and the Silicon Valley Marathon on the radar.  I missed the B2B registration deadline for $27.  It's now $32 until May 15th.  Darn!    Hopefully it doesn't rain tomorrow so I can run.   New York Planning  Last Tuesday evening, Diana invited us over for dinner and to plan our New York trip next week.  6 of us are flying out for 5 days, to visit Olivia and tour NY.  Everyone's goal was to see as much as we can, see as many musicals at discount prices, hit all the major sites, try new places to eat, party every night, and save sleeping for when we get back to California.  Sounds like a good plan.  I'm really excited to visit Olivia again, and to hang out in NY.  I miss hanging out w/ her, so it should be nice to be w/ her again.  There's also so many things to do in NY, and so much to see.  My friends have never been, so it should be fun showing them around the city.  Olivia will be the official tour guide!  So far she got us tickets for Beauty and the Beast, and The Producers.   I just need a break from work!

       New York Getaway!  I just got from a 5 day trip to NYC, with my friends Mark, Diana, Nick, Diep, and Paula.  We visited Olivia and toured the great city of NY.  We did a bunch of things, visiting all the major sites, hanging out in Times Square, discovering new places to eat, Serendipity, hotdogs and pretzels, riding the subway everywhere, non-stop walking, shopping, muscials, museums, a cruise around the bay, comedy clubs, bars, dancing.  We had a great time!   Musicals  A trip to NY is definitely not complete w/o visiting Broadway.  We were able to watch 3 musicals.  Beauty and the Beast, Thoroughly Modern Millie, and The Producers.  All were great shows, and I highly recommend The Producers!  Funny, entertaining, and great songs!   Pictures  I finally posted the pictures from our trip. Check them out!  urlLink Day 1  |  urlLink Day 2  |  urlLink Day 3  |  urlLink Day 4  |  urlLink Day 5

       Sniffles  Darn, I think I'm getting sick.  I've been sneezing all day long, and it appeared that everyone else in the office today had the colds.  Not a good environment to work in, with different viruses flying around in the air.  I want to stay home tomorrow, but I have so much work to do!  I just got assigned another project to work on, among my other assignments...so I can't afford to lose one day of work.   I just want to sleep...I think I'll do that now.

       PCN Weekend  Friday and Saturday night, I watched Barkada of Santa Clara University’s PCN!  This year my little sister played the lead role, and I thought she did really well.  The shows turned out really well, plenty of funny Filipino jokes, great dancing, good story line, and good music. Saturday night was ten times better than the Friday show.  Everyone seemed to be more relaxed and less nervous, having a good time.  The crowd was more into the show, too.  My entire family went to watch, and we were all proud of Audrey’s performance.  Good job Auds!   Jacob’s 1st Birthday  Sunday was my friend Christina’s son Jacob’s birthday!  They had a huge picnic at Crystal Springs in San Bruno, with inflatable slides and obstacle courses, a football toss, a soccer kicking thing, a cartoonist drawing people’s faces, and lot’s of good food!  They went all out for their son’s 1st birthday!  We had a relay race up the slide and through the obstacle course, which took my breathe away.  The guys also played “King of the Mountain” on the slide, where 1 guy is on top, and the others had to try to take him down.  I couldn’t stop laughing the whole time!  That made me feel like a kid again, but at the same time really old because I couldn’t breathe!  I got a prize for being  the King the longest.  Oh, they also had a snow cone maker and a cotton candy machine!  I never had so much cotton candy in my life!   urlLink Check out the pictures taken by Shirley

       Bananas and Peanut Butter!  I usually don't eat breakfast in the morning.  Yesterday, I brought a jar of peanut butter and bread to work for breakfast.  I made myself a few peanut butter sandwiches, which reminded me of my elementary days of homemade sandwiches.  It's been years since I last had one.  Yummy!  This morning I was rushing to work again, and I grabbed 4 bananas for breakfast.  Since I had half a jar of peanut butter in my cube, and 4 bananas, I finally tried eating them together.  I've heard that bananas and peanut butter go well together, and yes...they do!  It tastes good!    2 bananas and 1/4 of a jar of peanut butter to go!  Healthy!

       Fishing Weekend  I went fishing for the 1st time at  urlLink San Pablo Dam Reservior  on Saturday.  My friend  urlLink Rick  organized the trip, inviting some coworkers and Rex.    We rented a 10 person boat, and I got a chance to drive the boat. That was the highlight of the day, since none of us got a single bite!  For the whole day, we fished, hooked on our bait, casted our lines, ate, drank, listened to music, and waited for fish.  Nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  Just hanging out, relaxing, socializing, and learning to fish was fun. It would have been nicer if one of us caught something.   What We did Wrong  After returning the boat, we found out that we were using the wrong lines.  Our lines were too heavy and thick, allowing the fish to see them easily.  Our bait should have been floating closer to the surface, since the fish here like to come up and bite the bait from under them.  We should of used some floating device to keep our bait floating...since most of us let is sink deeper.  Oh well, maybe next time.

       Busy at Work!  I'm so busy at work!  Several releases going on at the same time, it's tough to keep up.  It definitely makes the day go by faster, so I don't mind.  Now I'm taking a break during lunch to catch up w/ bloggin, since it's been a while.   Paid off my Car  I finally paid off my car last night!  I paid the remaining balance, and it feels good to get rid of that huge debt.  Now I don't have to worry about monthly car payments, and can start saving up again.  I think I'll treat myself to some icecream....I deserve it.   Friendster  This site is pretty cool, you should check it out if you have time @  urlLink www.friendster.com !  Seems like everyone is jumping onto this online community.  I like seeing who people know, and how I'm connected to other people.  It's fun seeing the connections people have, and who my friends know...etc.  It's a small world!

       Olivia's Back  Olivia came back home, for 1 week of Summer!  She goes back next week for her last Semester, and then she's done!  I love it when she's back home, since I get to spend time with her in person, vs. chatting online / email / or talking on the phone.   Bay 2 Breakers  Sunday was B2B.  I was hoping to run it, but due to illness for the past 3 weeks, I bailed out.  Olivia and I passed by to check it out, and saw thousands of people!!  It looked like so much fun, can't wait to run it next year.   Happy Birthday Ed  It's my friend Ed's 25th birthday today.  He had a dinner at Scores in San Mateo.  I've known this guy since Kindergarten, and until now, he's still the same!  Same good sense of humor...always making wise cracks.  Happy Birthday Ed!   Darn Giants  Giants lost 8 of their last 10 games!  HORRIBLE!  JUST HORRIBLE!  I hope they get out of their slump!

       Gas Prices  I'm glad gas prices are coming down!  I only paid $1.85 this morning for premium!  I paid as high as $2.50 at one point!  I hope it goes even lower.  What are the chances of it dropping to $1.50, for premium?

      The best times in life, at least in my own, are those spent with people you care about, like family and friends.  I find myself the happiest, when surrounded by people I love, and I cherish these seemingly normal times with family and friends.  Birthday parties, dinners, holidays, Xmas, going to church, weddings, barbecues, having lunch, riding in the same car, laughing, joking around, or just simply sitting in front of the television, together.  These are special times for me.   These days, time seems to fly by so fast, that it's hard to keep up.  People grow old so fast, friends getting married at an alarming rate, people having babies, and babies I once knew are turning into kids, kids are turning into adults, and adults turning into grandparents.     I look at my parents, and I start to see the years catching up to them.  Their hair is turning gray, skin starting to show wrinkles, their muscles ache from working so hard.  They eat, watch television, and sleep as a daily routine, and they're starting to call me by my sisters' names.  "Abigail, Audrey....I mean Alan!"  I can only laugh at how old age is starting to take over.  My dad is looking forward to his retirement, and for some grandchildren to take care of.  But seeing my parents laugh, smile, and happy are truly priceless moments for me.   Can you believe my little sister is already finishing up her 2nd year of college!?!  She will be a junior next year, turning 21!  I remember the days in Elementary school, when we would take the bus home together and I would hold her hand.  She was a tiny kindergartner.  One time, I accidentally left her on the bus as I stepped out at our bus stop.  She didn't follow behind me because she fell asleep. I panicked, and I had to chase after the bus for a couple of blocks!  She eventually got off at the next stop. That was the scariest moment of my life! The thought of leaving your 4 year old sister on a bus alone, is not a thought you want! But now, she's all grown up, doing her own thing.  She's going to be an RA next year, in the same dorm I was an RA.  Despite her denials, sometimes I think she's following in my footsteps! jk =)  But seeing her doing all these things today, makes me feel old, yet proud.   Speaking of old!  My older sister is getting married!  At the age of 26, she's going to be the first in our family to tie the knot, and we're all so excited for her big day w/ mike.  I remember those good old days, fighting and pulling each other's hair, and making fun of each other non-stop.  Seems like only yesterday we at OLPH, wearing green uniforms.  Those were the good old days.  Now, she's about to get married to the guy of her dreams, and will soon start her own family.     My girlfriend lives in New York, attending school at Columbia.  I cherish the times when she’s back in the Bay Area, visiting for special occasions.  It’s tough having a long distance relationship, and not being able to see your significant other whenever you want.  But it’s not bad at all when you know your love is real and it’s being returned.  I miss Olivia and I do cherish every moment I can when spend when she’s around.   It's exciting times for my family right now, so much going on, and way too fast!  I’m realizing that right now is when I should pay close attention to these special occasions.  Lot’s of thing happen so fast, that we have to enjoy every moment!  Only later, do we realize that these normal moments today, are rare and come once in a lifetime.

       Nate’s 26th Birthday  My friend  urlLink Nate  turned 26th last night. Oh boy, does this guy know how to get messed up on his birthday.  He got a bunch of Giants tickets, so we went to PacBell park and watched an awesome game.  Giants beat the Twins, in a come from behind, bottom of the ninth, bases loaded situation, and Barry Bonds on the plate.  Bonds came through last night and we watched an exciting game.   Bohemia  After the game, the party continued at  urlLink Bohemia , a cool bar / club in SF.  Nate’s friend Jose works there as a DJ, and played some really good music all night.  Nate, kept drinking non-stop!  He looked pretty wasted, but he definitely had a good time on the dance floor..entertaining us all.  Happy Birthday Nate.   urlLink Picture's from Nate's 26th

       Out of the Dorms  My little sister moved out of the dorms last night, and I helped her move back home.  So far she had the exact same living experience I had while I was at SCU, 2 years at Unity House, and 1 year at Swig Hall.  Kinda funny.  But walking into her dorm reminded me of the good times I had when I was her age.  Gosh, saying that makes me feel old.  But I am old, especially seeing these freshman and sophomores moving out yesterday.  I swear kids are starting to look younger and younger these days, or is that how we looked back then?  Either way, I still feel old around college students.  I guess because I graduated 3 years ago, which seems like a long time ago.  I miss those care free days, hanging out with friends, going to school events or dances, basketball games, parties, staying up late, meeting new people, and of course the campus food!  I definitely don't miss the midterms and finals.   Last Day for Training  Tomorrow morning I'm flying to Long Beach, for the Camp Pendleton Mud Run.  Today is the last day for some training, so I think I'll do more running after work.  I don't think I'm quite ready for it yet, since I started training late.  Oh well, I just hope I can finish the race.  Pray for Me!

       Miracle Grow  My dad and I watered the lawn the last night, with some Miracle Grow.  Our lawn isn't as green as it used to be when we first moved in.  My mom wanted us to do something about it, so we got a pack of grass food by Miracle Grow.  Before we feed the grass, I decided to walk around in my baseball cleats, to aerate the lawn.  I heard about this tip somewhere, either the learning channel or Home and Garden.  The neighbors looked at me funny, walking up and down the lawn in straight rows.  Hopefully in a few weeks the lawn will be greener!

       Mud Run this Weekend  I ran 4.5 miles Saturday.  Actually, ran and walked for a total of 4.5 miles.  That’s the most distance I’ve covered in quite a while.   urlLink Camp Pendleton Mud Run   in San Diego is this weekend, so I’m training last minute again!  Here is picture of the the  urlLink Race Course .  The course is actually pretty intense.  Check out this  urlLink article  that describes the course.    This is how we will look during the  urlLink race .  I'm glad that this is a team effort, so 5 of us have to finish the race together.  I'll be running it with  urlLink Dale ,  urlLink George ,  urlLink Rex , and  urlLink Joel .   Nate’s Bachelor Party  Saturday was  urlLink Nate's  bachelor party.  We started off the night with appetizers and drinks at City Tavern, a bar in the Cow Hollow district of San Francisco.  We then walked across the street to the Blue Triangle, for more drinks and some dancing.  Then we headed to the Glas Kat, where a VIP private room awaited us.  That was pretty nice, and got better when the entertainment came.  They hired some private dancers for Nate, which was entertaining.  Nate had a really good time!  Check out the few  urlLink pictures  I was able to take.   Abby’s Graduation  Friday, my  urlLink sister  graduated from  urlLink UCSF , getting her masters in nursing.  After two long years of hard work, she finally finished.  She’s the first in the family to get a higher degree, and my family was really proud.    I’ve thought about going back to school, but definitely not right now.  Especially with the economy the way it is, and the job market cooling down, I’ll keep working until I get the boot.  If I also go back to school, it may be for something completely different from engineering.  Possibly try to get an MBA or something business related.  We’ll see when the time comes.   Roy’s – Hawaiian Fusion  After the ceremony, we went to Roy’s in San Francisco.  Great restaurant, nice atmosphere, and delicious food.  Pretty pricy place, but nice to try out at least once.   urlLink I posted pictures of the graduation night .

       Layoffs  We had layoffs at work again this week.  Definitely not a fun time, having to see 3 members of our team go.  Not sure if there will be more to come, but I'm hoping not. The company is doing well, but according to our VP of Engineering, the business needs to continue to slim down and tighten up to reach profitability.  I wouldn't mind being around for that!   Wedding Weekend!  My friends Nate and Michele are about to tie the knot this weekend.  I'm pretty excited for their wedding, since it'll be at a winery in Napa Valley. They only invited 100 people, so I feel priveleged to attend such a joyous occasion in their lives.  Sounds like a great time, especially since Olivia is flying in Friday afternoon.  I haven't seen her in 3+ weeks, so I can't wait to hang out with her.  She sprained her ankle, so I'm praying it'll get better so we can boogie on down Saturday night!    Errands  1) buy a wedding gift for Nate and Michele 2) find a shirt to match olivia's outfit for saturday 3) get fitted for George's wedding 4) get oil change for my car  Just a few reminders for myself....good night!

       Camp Pendleton Mud Run – San Diego Weekend  I had a fabulous weekend!  My good friends and I flew down to San Diego for Camp Pendleton’s annual Mud Run Event!  “10 Kilometers (6.2 mi.) of Rugged Terrain, Slippery Mud Walls, Straw Obstacles, Knee to Waist-Deep water & Slimy Mud Pits!”  Definitely a challenging course, but lot’s of fun!  Our team (George, Rex, Dale, and Joel) finished in 1hr 21 minutes.  No too bad, we were happy with our time.  This is officially our annual event!   Tijuana, Mexico  A trip to San Diego isn’t complete without a visit to Tijuana, Mexico.  After the race, we decided to cross the borders in Mexico, and check out the town.  Despite it being a Sunday night, we had a good time walking around and hanging out at the local bars / restaurants.     Priceless Moments  I just had a great weekend getaway with the guys.  So many great moments through the trip, and tons of great laughs.  From making underwater animal sounds in the pool, to “I need a friendster, b!tch…Dale is a Friendster B!tch”, to George being called “Baby Baby”, Dale speaking Spanish to the ladies, to Sandie, yes Sandie…for giving us the time of day, to crossing the border to Tijuana Mexico, to the whistle dude feeding us shots at El Torito, to the Boom Boom room we never went into, to Sakee Sakee or Fakee Fakee, to bargaining for cheaper beer, to attacking Rex w/ pillows while he slept, to sharing deep secrets at night, to getting stuff off our chest, like the “I like you” secrets that never came out, to wrapping duct tape around our shoes, to farting it up in the car, turning up the heat, and locking the windows (i.e.  training for heat stroke), to sticking paper to our foreheads, to paying tips for using the bathrooms, for the 10 beer buckets, to good chips/salsa, to the San Diego County Fair, trying the free rock climbing, to parking miles away to avoid paying $7 for parking, to singing in the car, “When it comes to feeling…gots to hold down!”, to Tall Midget, to waiting hours in the airport for our flight, to the magic tricks, to George and I pulling our infamous What Time is It? Trick, to stealing Dale’s burrito at La Joya, “where’s my food?”, to stealing Dale's car keys and making him check the restroom, to stealing his shoes while he slept, to Rex's “I don’t think so, buddy!”, to placing 19th place at the Camp Pendleton mud run, to the Mustang vs Cavalier rental car debate(we should of got the mustang), to the outlet shopping, to tasting the mud, to free continental breakfast, to mud pits and suicide hills, to the moving the car while Dale checked into the hotel, to the roller coast rides like STORM, to all the H2s on the road, to the synchronized swimming and holding our breath under water, to Poinsetta! and to more good times to come!     urlLink Check out the pictures!

       It feels like Summer  With the heat turned up, elementary school kids running around, coworkers talking about trips and vacations, and walking into your oven-like car, and it definitely feels like Summer!  I feel like going to some water theme park, like Raging Waters, and riding on some water slides!  It's been 2-3 years since I last went, and someone needs to organize an outing!  I'm down to go! I want to get WET!!!   No Major Plans  No major plans for the summer, other than weddings to attend.  I want to go on a trip, but I'm afraid of taking vacation from work...I may come back to find a pink slip.  Layoffs going on right now, and that's never fun!  We lost a few people last week, so taking a vacation right now is not a good idea!  It may be a pernament one!   Happy Bday Johannah!  Tuesday was Jomama's 26th Bday!  Went to El Torito in Milpitas for Happy Hour!  Happy Birthday Johannah!   Bachelor Party Weekend  It's my friend George's Bachelor Party this weekend.  Full day of fun on Saturday.  Us groomsman got it all planned out.  I'm looking forward to the special entertainment! =)

       Umbilical Brothers Comedy Show  Great weekend, especially since Olivia flew back for the festivites!  Lot's of stuff, busy weekend.  Friday night, we watched a Comedy show in San Francisco called,  urlLink Thawk !  2 great comedians, who basically reinvented the art of Mime, by adding sound. They performed various skits which involved their own sound effects w/ comedic actions.  Hilarious show, highly recommended!   Nate and Michele's Wedding  Saturday, we drove to Napa Valley to attend the wedding of our friends, Nate and Michele.  The ceremony and reception was held at the beautiful Gloria Ferrer Vineyards.  Great wedding and lot's of fun!  After 10 years together, they finally tied the knot!  I took a bunch of pictures from that night.   urlLink Take a look!  Once again, congratulation Nate and Michele!   Giants vs A's Game  Great game yesterday, despite SF Giants losing to the A's 6-5.  Lot's of offensive action by both teams in the first 3 innings.  With a crowd of 55 thousand, both teams battled it out back and forth, and the A's came out on top.  I hate the A's!  Go Giants!   Fenton's  After the Giant's game, we went to mass, and met up with Rick, Eileen, Oscar and Eric at Fenton's.  After being burned down 2 years ago by a disgruntled worker, Fenton's recently reopened, newly remodeled!  Great place for icecream and sundaes!   Dodger Beating Tonight!  Dale got some free tickets to the Giants game tonight at PacBell.  I hope they give those LA Dodgers a good beating!  We need to reclaim sole pocession of 1st place. GO GIANTS!

       July 4th  Happy Independence Day!  Let's see what happened yesterday.  I picked up Olivia from the airport.  We then played some softball in front of her house, throwing the ball around.  We went shopping at Serramonte for a wedding gift.  We then watched the Giants kick some San Diego bootie. Saw some fireworks from inside the house and on tv.  Happy 4th of July!

       Wedding Rehearsal  After work, I drove to Santa Clara Mission Church for George and Ruby's wedding rehearsal.  Pretty exciting practicing for the wedding on Saturday.  We ran through the entire ceremony, practiced walking up and down the aisle, etc.  Afterwards, we went to their house for dinner.  Both their families and the wedding entourage were there.  George got us groomsman a flask, money clip, and pocket knife..each with our names / initials engraved.  Pretty nice!  It should be a fun wedding on Saturday.   Olivia in Town  Olivia flys in today, and I should be picking her up in an hour or so.  I'm pretty excited for that.  It's our 43rd month Anniversary today.. so happy anniversary to Olivia!  She'll be attending the wedding, so it should be a fun weekend while she's back in town.  We get to dance and take more pictures! =)   Gary's Tux  Gary's Tux, I'm sorry to say, SUX!  They honesty should be called, Gary Sux!  I placed an order for a new pair of tuxedo shoes on Monday, and the guy that helped me was an idiot.  First of all, the person he was helping before me got so angry and frustrated w/ him, that she got up and left!  I was surprised w/ the whole scene, but now I know why!  Well, I called in today to say that I would pick up my shoes...and the lady said that the shoes won't be in until TUESDAY! The wedding is tomorrow, I told her, and she said the guy that helped me never placed the order...or placed it too late!  I was mad, really mad, and said this guy is an idiot!  What kind of service are you guys running there!  Well, she said that they have a rental pair that they'll let me use for free.  And if I still want the new shoes I ordered on Tuesday, I can still buy them.  I'll probably not buy any more!  Anyways, at least I got free rentals.  I just hope they're the right shoes!

       Softball   I bought myself a new baseball glove, some glove conditioner, and batting gloves...since I'll be playing softball on Darren and Stacey's team.  They signed up for a coed softball league, and needed players.  I'm actually pretty excited to play softball. Team practice was pretty fun yesterday, with about half the team showing.  Everyone seems pretty good.  I felt a little rusty, but it was fun batting and hitting the ball.  I'm not sure what position I'd like to play, but most likely it'll be outfield.  Can't wait for the games to start.

       Bachelor Party Weekend  This past weekend was George’s Bachelor party.  Us groomsman threw a full day event for the soon to be married guy.  It started off w/ a BBQ at my house, where everyone met up.  We feasted off some guy food...bbq chicken wings, 2 slabs of bbq pork ribs, chips and fresh salsa, corn, burgers, and made some good wholesome chili dogs!    Throughout the day, the guys played basketball in front of the house, played some xbox, took a couple of shots, ate, and drank lot's of beer.  After everyone had their fill, we drove to a park to play some Flag Football.  W/ 15 guys, we had enough for 2 teams. Brian Fong got a nice cut in the eye lid after colliding head on with Dale.  He was rushed to the hospital only to receive two stitches.  Brian took one for the team!  We then came back to the house, to finish up the rest of the burgers and hotdogs.  A bunch of guys showered up at the house, and had dinner, before heading to the night time festivities at Albert’s place.    The night time festivities…well, I won’t go into detail.  Someone  (george) has to get married this weekend!    After the night time festivitities, we hit up a few bars to hang out and dance.  George got a little wild and crazy!  We ended the night by having a late night dinner at Denny’s.   Pictures  The  urlLink pictures  should paint a better picture of the day!  I have excluded quite a few, but oh well.

       Las Vegas Weekend  I'll by flying to Las Vegas tonight, for Mike's Bachelor Party weekend!  I'm excited for Vegas, and am looking forward to getting away!  More bachelor FUN!  =)   Team Lunch  Thursday, our team had lunch at Chili's.  The cool thing was that my company sponsored it, so I didn't have to pay a dime! =)  We don't usually go out to lunch as a team too often, and less often paid by the company, so going out as a group made today a fun day at work!   Dinner w/ Nortel Coworkers  Wednesday night, I had dinner w/ my former Nortel Networks co-workers.  We ate at this restaurant called "Pasta?" in Mountain View, which was pretty good.  Every so often we get together to hang out and catch up with things.  We celebrated with a bottle of red wine. =) It's always fun hanging out with these guys, and it always reminds me of the best job I ever had!  And that was with Nortel Networks!   Softball Practice  I had softball practice on Tuesday.  It's pretty fun doing drills and getting some batting practice.  I still need lot's of practice!  Our first game is this Tuesday at Twin Creeks, so if you want to come and watch, you're more than welcome to cheer us on!

       George and Ruby's Wedding  Last Saturday was George and Ruby's Wedding.  It was a such beautiful day for this beautiful couple to finally tie the knot!  The entire wedding was great - lot's of fun, great weather, a wonderful dinner, family, friends, and plenty of good times!   Everyone had a great time!  Open bar, good music and dancing, fun entertainment!  Their wedding ceremony was held at the Mission Santa Clara, with the reception in the Mission Gardens.  I loved the outdoor dinner in the gardens...very nice atmosphere.     urlLink Take a look at all the pictures from their special day.   Congratulations once again to George and Ruby, may both your lives be filled with love, happiness, and many children to come!   Happy Birthday Kevin  Kevin Lee turns 25 tomorrow.  He celebrated with a BBQ yesterday at Coyote Point, in San Mateo.  We played some volleyball, which was a ton of fun.  I got a nice bruise on my forearms from digging all those spikes!  Olivia got a nice sun burn, since she forgot to put on some sunblock.  Ouch!  Happy Birthday Kev!

       SF Giants Game tonight!  Dale got an extra ticket to the Giants game tonight, so I'm looking forward to watching them play. I'm hoping SF will get another win against the Colorado Rockies.  Half the season is already over, so it's critical that the Giants continue to play strong 'til the end! Another World Series would be so sweet...I'll pay anything this time to watch a game!

       First Softball Game Victory  Our team "SHTZ N' GIGZ" defeated Solid Rock in a 17-10 victory, at Twin Creeks yesterday.  Great victory, and everyone played really well! Good defense and offense all around.   Unfortunately, after the second inning, I pulled my right hamstring when running hard to first. Right when I stepped on the bag, my leg didn't feel right, and started to tighten up.  It sucked, but luckily we had more than enough players, and Brian subbed in for the rest of the game.  At the end of the game, we shook hands with the other team. One of guys on the other team said to his teammate, "Good game, it's just the 1st game of the season."  Darren said "Good game, it's just the 1st game of our lives!"

       Crazy Weekend in Vegas!  This past weekend, I hung out in Vegas for Mike's Bachelor party!  For the past 4 days, I had about 10-12 hours of sleep, since we got back every morning around 6-7am!  Pretty crazy weekend, and when I got home yesterday, I was beat!   The Worldmarks  We stayed at a timeshare called “The Worldmarks, by Trendwest” that Mike’s family had.  The condo was cool, complete w/ facilities, washer and dryer, kitchen, stove, bbq grill, 2 bedrooms, 2 full baths.  They had a game room w/ ping pong, foosball, video arcades, pool tables.  The swimming area had a lazy pool, which was fun!   Nonstop Clubbing  We all had a good time in Vegas, especially Mike since he was the Bachelor.  We went clubbing every night! Thursday night, we checked out The Light in the Bellagio.  That place was pretty cool.  Friday, we hit up Rain, in Palms.  This club was tight!  I had the most fun here.  They had fire blown above the dance floor.  We also hooked up with another bachelorette party, so they hung out w/ our group the entire night.    Saturday night, we partied at Studio 54!  And Sunday night, we checked out OPM.  Lot's of drinking and staying up late these past 4 days!   Mike’s Family  I got a chance to meet a lot of Mike's family.  He has a lot of cool cousins, and I got a chance to hang out and get to know some of them.  We even visited his aunt’s house, had lunch, and gambled w/ his uncles!  His family are all pretty close, and it was fun spending the weekend with them all.   The Strippers  The only thing that sucked this weekend was the strippers we got for Mike.  They practically suckered us into paying them so much money, for doing nothing.  All they did was made Mike remove his clothes, tied a belt around his neck to walk him like a dog, made him bark at the pussy cat, and slapped him in the butt.  Everyone was pretty disappointment, but oh well...what could you do.  Overall, it was a fun weekend!  I didn't take too many pictures of the trip, but I'll post up what I took later on!  Congrats again Mike, my future brother-in-law!

       Softball Scrimmage  Last Tuesday, our team played a scrimmage game against Rita's coworkers at Encinal Park.  We took an early lead w/ 3  runs, only to fall behind in the next few innings.  In the last inning, we were able to tie the game w/ George hitting a homerun.  But in the bottom of the last inning, the first batter hit one deep and ran all the way for the winning run.   Tough game, our first taste of defeat.  Well, the scrimmage was good practice, and our next real game is next Tuesday.    BBQ on Sunday  Our GYGO4 BBQ is on sunday, so I did some errands yesterday.  Bought a bunch of supplies, food, drinks, and equipment.  Started planning the games for this year, which should be fun!  Games include....well, that'll be a surprise until sunday.     Go Giants  I love the Giants!   10 games in the lead, wow!   Olivia's Back for the Weekend  Yes, Olivia flies in from NY tonight!  She's back for 4 days, since a lot of stuff is going on.  Her Lola's birthday on Saturday, Abby's Bridal Shower on Saturday, our annual GYGO4 BBQ on Sunday, and hanging out w/ her boyfriend from Friday - Tuesday!  It should be a fun weekend if I don't have to come in to work!

       Aids Walk  Yesterday, I participated in the San Francisco Aids Walk 2003, held at Golden Gate Park.  I got my little sister and Ben to walk with me, and they had a good time.  We joined the Covad Team, since that’s where I work.  Tons of people were there, supporting the cure for Aids, which is always positive to see.  It shows plenty of hope exsit, that someday a cure will be found, and Aids will be no more.  Hopefully soon!  I saw a few familiar faces, like Johannah and Christina, and a bunch of Olivia’s Berkeley friends.  Plenty of sponsors donated free food, snacks, and drinks…so I ate a bunch of free chips, nutrition bars, candy, bananas, ice cream, prunes, etc.  We even brought a bag of goodies home. =)  I parked about 3 miles away from the starting line, which really sucked.  We ended up walking about 12 miles that entire day, and when I got home, my feet were sore!  They still hurt right now!    Pictures to be posted soon!

       Six Flags Marine World  Saturday, I went to Vallejo to check out Six Flags Marine World.  Dale, Lisa, Darren, Stacy, Rex, Audrey, and Ben came along with me.  I fortunately got some cheap tickets from Olivia's mom's work, Bechtel, who had their company picnic there.  So I invited them along.  We were able to get free lunch, too! =)  Of all the rides there, the Medusa was the best ride!  I savored every twist and turn of the ride, which started with a huge drop in the beginning.  We actually went twice on this ride since it was so good.  That is now officially my favorite rollercoaster of all time!If you ever get a chance, try this ride!  I would go back to Marine World just to ride this ride all day long! =)  Pictures should be posted up soon!

       Abigail's Bridal Shower  Saturday, Abby had a bridal shower at the house, and invited all her female girlfriends and family.  Audrey and my mom were the hosts, and I was assigned to do manual labor...so I was able to attend this all-female event.  =) I helped by setting up the house, running errands, buying food, preparing the dishes, chopping up vegetables and meat, and cooking most of the dishes.  I really didn't mind all the work, since I was surrounded by so many females! =)  Auds planned a lot of Bridal Shower games, which everyone seemed to enjoy.  Now I know what happens at a bridal shower.  They played various games, such as a toilet paper gown contest, purse scavenger hunt, how well do you know the groom, people bingo, present bingo, musical bouquet, can't say the groom's name game, how well do you know the bride...so many!!  And there were tons of prizes, too.  It was nice to see Auds leading the games, good qualities for being an RA this year!  I took a bunch of pictures which I'll post later.  By the end of the day, I was so tired!  I still had to do another round of prep work for the next day, our GYGO4 BBQ!

       24-22  We won our 3rd Softball Game yesterday, 24-22.  Yeah!  We're 2-1 now, which is not bad.  Last night we only played 4 innings, since it was such a high scoring game.  I went 3 for 4, with a few RBIs.  But dangit, I missed a routine fly ball in left field.  I thought I had it, but the sun and wind messed me up, and the ball broke to my left.  I felt bad, but oh well...we all make mistakes.  The team we played hardly swung their bats, and kept walking.  The guys on their team kept taking balls, which means they automatically go to second base.  It sucked, cuz that's how they ending up scoring so many runs.  But in the last inning, down 18 to 22, we gave them a taste of their own medicine.  We practically walked in our winning runs.  Gosh, it feels good to win!  We celebrated at St. John's, a burger / bar joint down the street.   Stiff Neck  I woke up thing morning with a stiff neck.  Not sure how I got it, but I still can't turn my head till now!  I read online it could be cause by several things, such as bad sleeping habits, sleeping with the windows open during the night, driving with the driver's window open (the cold can tighten up your neck muscles), bad sitting posture, improper ergonomics w/ your computer / desk, and of course stress!  Well, I have all these symptoms...and now I'm paying the price!   Website Down  Yes, my website has been down the entire week last week.  I contacted my hosts, and it appears that they replaced my files from w/ backup files.  So I lost about a week's worth of updates.  The GYGO pictures were losts, and some config files were not replaced properly.  Hence the errors w/ my gallery of pics.  Well, at least I didn't lose everything.  When I find time, I'll have to update this crappy site.  I'm tired of this site....I may start from scratch again!

       Non-stop Softball  Our team joined the Monday night league for really cheap, since Twin Creeks were short of teams.  They gave us a good deal, $100 for the season, versus $650+ we paid for our Tuesday team.  So last Monday we had a double header, to make up for the first week.     1st Game  First game was a very close battle.  The team we played were about our level, had some beginners, small asian team like us....and we should of won!  They actually caught up in the last inning, and took the lead by scoring 6 runs.  In the bottom of the 7th, we had a chance to win!  We loaded up the bases, and got Darren to the plate with two outs.  He hit a good solid hit on the ground, but the 2nd baseman made a great stop and a nice toss to second for the force out.  That girl saved her team.  It was kinda upsetting losing this way.  We should have won, but I give the other team props for making a good rally.  Their defense held us down in the end.  They wanted it more than we did. We lost our first game, 13-12.   Our Second Game  Our second game of the night was a different story, where we played a team that won their first game 23-2.  Watching their previous game, they looked like a great team, with great hitters and great defense.  They started off the first inning by scoring 7 runs on us.  Luckily that's the max for the first 3 innings.  Slowly, we were able to chop away at their lead, by scoring some runs...2 here, 3 there, 5 here, 1 there.  Eventually it added up, and we took the lead 14 - 11.  Bottom of the 7th, they immediately scored 2 runs, 13-14.  Luckily our defense held us up, and we ended up winning a very close game, 14-13.  I love winning!  =)  Great Job "Master Batters"!  Our Monday night team is now 1-1.   Tuesday's Game  We lost, 24 -13.  Enough said.  Our record is 2-2.

       BBQ at Lick Mill  I spent Saturday afternoon at Lick Mill park in Santa Clara, where Randy / Darren / Lezlie / Cyndi threw a 102nd Birthday BBQ.  102 being the total years of their ages!  Fun day hanging out at the park with everyone.  Highlights for me that day, were:  1) We got a chance to play to some Kickball. =)  Haven’t played that game since elementary school!   2) Rex and I were throwing around the softball with Dale, when Rex threw a fly ball to Dale.  Unfortunately Dale missed the ball, and it landed right in his eye.  He started bleeding, due to a large cut above his eye-lid.  He was ok, but had to run to the hospital to have it checked out.  He said they just had to put some super glue over the cut, and he was fine.    Fun sunny day with a lot’s of food, fun, and blood.    Guy’s Night Out  After the picnic, I went out w/ the guys (Rex, Gell, Jon, and Alan) for a guys night out in the city.  Pretty fun night, going bar hopping and driving around the city.  We checked out a few places in the Mission district.  I forget all the names of the bars we went to, since I’m not great at remembering details.  But we hit a few bars, had a couple of drinks…and headed to the Filmore area.  Really cool area with several open bars.  We ended up at the Blue Triangle.  After all those drinks, we were starving and headed to Ling Nam for some food.  Reminded me of high school days, late night cheap eats.  In the car, we turned up the stereo to some Enrique Iglesias, windows rolled down, and made Alan T. ask people directions to the Castro.  Pretty funny stuff!   Mike and Abby’s Wedding Shower  Sunday, the Calica family hosted a wedding show for Mike and Abby in Vallejo.  Lot’s of food, family, friends, and fun!  We played showers games, such as a word search puzzle, how well does the bride and groom know each other, musical chairs, stick the pen in the bottle, how well does the groom know the bride’s ankle.  I actually won a Target gift certificate for answering the most questions in “How well do you know the bride and groom?” game.  I answered the most, 9 out of 15.  =)  Pictures to be posted soon!

       Post Wedding Party  The following day after the wedding, we threw another party at the house.  Mike and Abby were able to invite their families to the house, to have lunch.  They also opened all their presents!  Many of their guests were generous, giving nice gifts and lots of money!  Watching the gift opening made me want to have a big wedding myself!  I had about 3 hrs of sleep after the wedding, since I was responsible for buying the food.  About 100 people came by that day.  We had bbq chicken, pork ribs, corn, hotdogs, sphagetti, lumpia, chocolate meat, etc.    The next day, I was exhausted!

       Mike and Abby’s Wedding  August 23, 2003 my sister Abigail finally tied the knot with Mike. Let’s see, where should I begin.   Well, the wedding ceremony was held at St. Ignatius Church in San Francisco, at 2:30pm.  I had to meet all the groomsmen at the Ramada Inn, SSF...where a white limo awaited to drive us to the Church.  St. Ignatius - Beautiful Church!  It started to really hit me emotionally when we started walking up the aisle, to the entrance music, and finally watching Abby walk in, escorted by my parents...to the wedding music.  It was a very special moment for me…beautiful bride and groom, beautiful music and church, and friends and family to witness the marriage.  I was very happy for Mike and Abby, and I was really glad to be a part of their wedding.  After the ceremony, what do Filipinos like to do?  Take pictures!  And that we did. We took a million shots at the Church, all sorts of combinations.  Parents of the bride, parents of the groom, bride alone, wedding party, grandparents, sponsors, etc..etc.  After the church, we drove to the Legion of Honor to take more pictures.  The reception followed at the South San Francisco Convention Center.  Their wedding was awesome, and I had a great time.  550+ guests in attendance, lot’s of family and friends from both sides.  It felt like a huge family reunion, as I got to see relatives I haven’t seen in years!  Olivia and Ben were the emcees, and did a great job.  I helped with the slide show presentation, which a lot of people really enjoyed.  It featured pictures from birth to today, as well as special footage of the actual marriage proposal, captured by Mike’s cousin Jennifer.  Live music was provided by a band, and during their breaks, Ben was able to play his mixes.  I had a great time dancing with Olivia!  I took tons of pictures…so I’ll just let the pictures tell the rest of story. But once again, just want to say Congratulation to Mike and Abby!  I love you guys both!

       My Sister’s Getting Married!  I took Friday off, to attend Mike and Abby’s wedding rehearsal.  My oldest sister is finally getting married, and I’m so excited for her.  I couldn’t be happier with the man she chose to spend the rest of her life with, Mike Calica!  Mike is a great guy, and complements my sister well.  Together, they make such a great couple, and I can tell that they make each other very happy.  I can’t imagine my sister with anyone else!     Rehearsal / Dinner  So Friday, we had a run-through of the ceremony.  We practiced walking in and out, where to stand and sit, went through the ceremony from beginning to end.  Abby even started crying during the dress rehearsal.  Tears of joy =)…   Following practice, we had dinner at Yet Wah in the Diamond Heights area of San Francisco.  Mike and Abby presented the wedding party and sponsors with thank you gifts, as a sign of their appreciation.  I got a cool Leatherman pocket knife!

       11-12 Loss  Dangit, we lost our tuesday night game.  We led by 6 runs in the bottom of the 6th inning, and the other team rallied to tie the game.  They ended up scoring the winning run in the bottom of the 7th, as we blew our lead!  Definitely a tough loss to take, since we were in a 3 way tie for 2nd place.  We should have won the game, but we couldn't stop their last minute rally. Oh well...   Layoffs Today  Yes, unfortunately we had another round of layoffs at work today.  Despite all the wonderful things going on for our company, cost cutting initiatives means constant re-orgs, which results in layoffs.  Two members of the CIS team that I work closely with, got the boot today...which shocked me.  It surprised me that they were chosen, since they had great development skills.  My group didn't get touched, since last round we lost 3 team members.    Times are definitely tough, but fortunately I still have a job...for now.  Covad has some great momemtum going on, and could possibly reach EBITA positive by the end of the year.  By Q1 of next year, we could possibly reach profitability!  Watch out for Covad stocks! =)  I just hope I'll still have job by then.   September 11th  Wow, tomorrow is the 2 year anniversary of the Sept.11th terrorist attack.  My thoughts and prayers go out to all those who lost their lives 2 years ago, and to their families who will be reminded of their loses tomorrow.  I can only imagine how tough it would be for those who had an immediate family member or friend lose their lives.  I wonder what will be on television tomorrow?  More replays of footage from that day?  Hopefullly not too much. We'll see.

       10 Run Rule  We won our monday night softball game, when the umpire ended it after we scored our 16th run.  Apparently our league has a 10 run rule.  If your team leads by 10 runs in the 5-7th innings, with a certain amount of time left, it's game over.  We won 16-6.    Go Master Batters!

       Jillian's  Saturday night, we celebrated Olivia's 25th Bday at Jillian's in SF.  Thanks again to everyone for coming to help Olivia celebrate!  She had a great time!  Lot's of fun dancing and watching Olivia get a little freaky.  I'll post up the pictures soon!   SF Giants Game  Sunday afternoon, Olivia and I watched the Giants blow a 6-3 lead. Disappointing game to watch.  The magic number is still 11.  Despite the loss, I'm sure the Giants will make it to the playoffs!   Softball Game Tonight  I have a softball game tonight at 9pm.  That means I have to wait till then, since I refuse to drive home and back to Sunnyvalle.  Waste of gas.  My car has over 45k, in 2 years...so I'm trying to drive it less.  I drove my old 89 toyota today.  I'll have to kill 3hrs after work.  Not sure what I'll do.

       Tahoe Weekend  My high school friends and I spent this past weekend in Lake Tahoe.  Every year, we usually plan a trip to Tahoe during the winter, to go snowboarding.  But this time we wanted to get together w/o the snow.  What's there to do in Tahoe w/no snow?  Well, that's what we all said!  Fortunately we kept ourselves busy doing lot's of stuff.  We went swimming, took a hike toward the Lake Tahoe, hung out at the beach, went gambling in the casinos, played drinking games, xbox, tennis courts, who am i games, played mafia, took more shots, played king's cup, and took a bunch of pictures.  Pretty fun weekend!  Check out the pics in my gallery!    Olivia plays Softball?  Yes she does!  She played for the first time on our monday team, since we were short of players.  We placed her at second base, a pretty tough spot.  I felt a little nervous for her, but she played very well.    The first play of the game, was a grounder towards Olivia.  She was able to stop the ball, bobbled it a bit, but was able to throw the runner out at first!  Despite the ball hitting her ear, she got the out!  I think she also got her first single, at her first at bat.  It wasn't pretty, but she made it to first on an error.  She also caught her first infield popup!  Yes, I was proud of her softball abilities.  Good job olivia!  We lost, 9-18.

       Softball Update  We won our game last night, 12-23.  Everyone hit the ball deep, due to the still air.  I guess no wind and lot’s of heat makes the ball travel farther.  Our Monday team still have a chance for the playoffs!  Good job Master Batters!   Here Kitty, Kitty, Kitty!  Oh, we have a kitty now.  Last week, as I drove up in front of the house after work, a small kitten sat in front of our garage door, chillin and hanging out.  My mom said she saw the kitten there around noon when she came home, so I think it wanted to move in.  Well, we felt bad for the cute kitty, and decided to give it some milk and food.  It was definitely starving, as it wasn’t afraid of us at all, and jumped straight for the milk.  It has a cute little meow, pleading for attention and for food.  We ended up bringing the cat into the garage, where it currently lives now.    We’re not sure what to do with it, since it’s just a baby.  Do we let it back out in the streets, let it live in our garage, bring it to the vet, put posters up for Lost Kitty?  My little sister bought some cat food at Safeway, so I guess we’re going to keep it for now.  Maybe after we run out of kitty food, we’ll let it go.  It’s also getting bigger, now that it's being fed!

       Lisa Loeb Live  Friday night, we watched  urlLink Lisa Loeb  in Concert, at Slims in San Francisco.  Our friend Rick got 8 free tickets from a friend of his, and invited us to come along.  Lisa Loeb was awesome, and has a wonderful voice.  She sang a bunch of songs upon request from the crowd, which was cool, and told us stories and jokes in between.  She sang some new songs in her new album, which made me want to go buy it. She's hot, too, btw!  She played the guitar while she sang, and her talent really amazed me.  I want to learn the guitar now!    80's Night Club  Last Thursday night, Eileen invited us to an 80's Night Club, at this place called Cats, in San Francisco. They say it's the best place in SF for 80's music.  When we got there, there were people dressed up in 80's outfits, wearing tight jeans, colorful outfits, stripes, pink, etc...which was different.  I had a tough time dancing to the music at first, since it's so different from the way you would dance to hip-hop.  NOt your typical side to side moves...it's more free and wild, with different tempos.  But after a while, watching the girls dance and go crazy, I was able to get iinto it.  Definitely a fun place to check out!   Work is Tough  Yes, it's kicking my butt.  The environment these days at work are stressful, especially since we all talk about job security at work.  So much fear of getting laid off, and everyone wondering when the next round will be, definitely frustates me.  I really do not want to get laid off, especially since our company is doing so well.  But unfortunately, the Engineering Department is way over budget, and our VP has a mandate to cut costs dramatically.  He's actually in India right now, working with outsourcing companies, seeing what deals and services they can provide.  So far, the forcasts do show a good percentage of our work will be outsourced to Inia.  Outsourcing really bites, especially when work that should be given to US citizens, are being given to other countries.   That seems to be the trend companies are taking these days.  It does make good economic sense for a business...cheaper labor for better quality work.  Why pau someone $40/hr when you can pay $10 elsewhere!  I don't want to get laid off!  Not sure what I would do if it happens to me again. I would go back to school, receive unemployment, do some travelling around the world, fix my room, take bartending classes, work on a side business, work out more, landscape the backyard, and hang out with Olivia. =)

       Jaylin's Dedication  We attended our friend Rowena's daughter Jaylin's dedication ceremony this past Sunday. It was basically a baptism for Christians.  That was my first time to attend a Christian church and participate in their prayer / mass.  I must say it was very different from the traditional Catholic church.  Lot's of singing, live music, welcoming people, less systematic, more open, interactive, and more modern.  A live band played guitars and sang live, they had a video projector and used powerpoint to show the words of the songs, and the minister gave a good speech/lesson on temptations.  One thing I really liked was how they got all the children involved.  The minister called all the kids to the front, had them sit in front of him, and told them a story.  It was like story time, sharing a parable, simple for the kids and adults to understand.  Afterwards, they brought them to some room for them to learn more lessons of life.  Now that impressed me.  Definitely a new experience.  I sort of felt out of place, since I didn't know what to expect.  It also felt like I was betraying the Catholic Church, for participating in this different method of worship.  Olivia and I didn't partake in the bread and wine ceremony, somewhat similar to the Catholic Church.  I just didn't feel right...almost sinful.  Overall, their worship was uplifting, and gave me a more positive outlook on life.    Well, after the reception at Jay's sister's house, we went to St. Anne's Church.  I felt more at ease and appreciative of the traditional Catholic mass.  I was glad that the priest gave a meaningful homily, because many times priests tend to talk on and on, losing the audience, and losing the whole meaning of the gospel.  I do appreciate great prients, that know how to keep their audience attentive.  Anyways.  I'm Catholic, born and raised, and will always be Catholic! =) Amen.   Another Loss  We lost our softball game last night, 22-14.  Tough loss.  Lost our past 3 games.  One more game next week, and maybe we'll get to the playoffs!   My Bubby is Sick  Yes, Olivia is sick.  I hope you feel better!  Get some rest and drink lot's of fluids.  And stop watching your soap operas!

       Train / Barenaked Ladies Concert on "The Rock!"  Last night Olivia and I saw a concert of a lifetime...the  urlLink Barenaked Ladies with special guest TRAIN Concert on Alcatraz Island !   T-Mobile sponsored the concert, as part of their T-Mobile All Access concert tour across the U.S.  All I can say is "WOW!  I'm switching to T-Mobile!"  Because Olivia was caller 101 on K101.3, she won two tickets for this event! It was definitely a well organized event, and an awesome experience!   FREE STUFF  First of all, everything was free!  When we arrived to Pier 39 to check in, they gave us a cool All Access concert badge to board the ferry to Alcatraz.  Once we got onto the Rock, T-Mobile gave everyone a huge gift bag that contained a bunch of goodies!  It included a black T-Mobile fleeze jacket(in case it got cold), a matching fleeze beanie(which kept my head warm), a cool baseball style t-shirt(i gave it to my mom), a keychain glow stick, an All Weather Emergency Poncho (in case it rained), and other stuff(flyers, coupons).  I thought that was very generous of T-Mobile!  As we walked towards the top of the Island, towards the music and stage, we could smell barbeque!  We were told there would be food available on the Island, but I never thought it would be free.  Well, it was!  They served burgers, gourmet hotdogs, chicken kabobs, potatoes, Ceasar salad, cookies, drinks, hot chocolate...you name it!  And did I mention it was FREE!   I love FREE stuff, makes everything so much more exciting!  T-Mobile really took care of their audience, from free goodies to free dinner to a great venue!  Now that's how concerts should be thrown!   Awesome Concert  The Concert was awesome!  Train rocked the Rock, and so did Barenaked Ladies!  You can view their performance on the  urlLink T-Mobile website .   Evening Magazine  Oh, before the concert, Evening Magazine came up to me and asked if they can  interview me!  I said sure!!!   They asked me: Where are you from? Who are looking forward to see perform? What do you think of the venue? Have you been to Alcatraz before? Would you come back again?   So I could possibly be on Evening Maganize! We'll see...  Thanks for winning tickets Olivia, and for inviting me!  Now can you please win a million bucks on the radio?

       Softball  Last night we won our last game of the regular season, 9-8!  A tight game throughout the night, we were able to hold them in the bottom of the 6th to win the game!  I think our Monday night team made it to the playoffs next week, so it's definitely cool to extend out season.  Once softball is over, I'll no longer be involved with any physical activities.   I guess I'll start running again, since Olivia is getting into it now!   Movie Weekend  Olivia and I watched two movies this weekend, which was quite a lot for me.  I seldom go to the movies, just  because I refuse to pay 9 bucks for a flick.  I'd rather buy an Xbox game or DVD....but that's just me.  Olivia loves watching movies!  We watched   urlLink Fighting Tempations  starring Cuba Gooding and Beyonce.  Good movie...but I'd suggest waiting for the DVD or buying yourself an Xbox game!  We also watched  urlLink Underworld  starring Kate Beckingsale.  I'm in love with her!  Great movie, loved her performance, and I can't wait for the sequel!

       Covad Moves to San Jose  My company headquarters moved from Santa Clara to San Jose.  With every move, there are pros and cons.  PROS: + I actually save about 3 miles each way, so I definitely don't mind the shorter commute + Our new building has more space and parking + Lot's of windows all around, which makes the working atmosphere a lot brighter =) + Nicer cubes and more modern building (our old building was a former Yahoo building...everything was purple and yellow inside..yuck) + Huge water fountain in the front (it feels nice to drive up to a better looking building) + Our company saves a ton in lease payments, so that increases my odds of not getting laid off + Change is always good + More new restuarants to try, new places to eat   CONS: - I'm no longer one block away from Costco (no more cheap gas or hotdogs for lunch) - My new cube is right across from my manager (i have to always be on guard) - I don't get to pass by the IKEA in EPA for free Swedish meatballs on my way home - Slightly more traffic on the way home, since I take 880 home - I miss my old cube location - Company is continuing to try to cut costs...increases my odds of getting laid off

       Marine World  Saturday, I went to Six Flags Marine World in Vallejo, with a bunch of friends(Olivia, Rick, Eileen, Oscar, Johanna, Rowena, Chris, Eric, and Marjorie).  Marine World had a Halloween Fright Fest attraction we wanted to check out.  Two years ago, we all went to Great America for Halloween, where they had a Haunted House.  We got there around 4pm, and rode about 3 rides: The Medusa, The Zonga, and Kong.  We also went through two haunted houses.  They were ok..got scared a few times.  There were a bunch of highschool cheerleaders or school camps walking around...made me feel old being at Marine World.  I did feel a little old...but boy oh boy, do I love rollercoasters!   Kings  Afterwards, we headed to Rowena and Eric's house to play some Kings.  Pretty fun stuff...I ended up picking the last king, with only two cards left.  It sucked, but I had a good time.     Breathalizers  Johanna brought her breathalizer (spell check), which calculates your BAL.  I tested 0.03, which wasn't too bad.  Don't ask what Olivia got.  =).  Pretty cool device to have if you party a lot.  I saw one in Costco for about 20 bucks, which I think I'll go ahead and buy.   Go Niners!  I love it when the Niners win!  Go Niners!

       Wedding Sweatshop  Last night, Olivia and I helped Nick and Diep with their wedding favors.  They invited some friends over to Nick's house, to help put their programs together / put together their favors...in exchange for some pizza!  It was fun, seeing the two so excited about their wedding, which is in two weeks.  Great couple, great friends... I'm really excited for their wedding!    It's always fun helping out friends...and it's nice to getting asked for help.  Always a pleasure!   Team Lunch  Our team had a Team Lunch yesterday, sponsored by Covad, at guess where of all places?  At the Mayflower Restaurant in Milipitas!  Two days in a row for me, since I was just there for Judy's.  This time we had dim sum, versus a family style banquet.  I'll be there again in two weeks for Nick and Diep's wedding banquet!  Yummy.

       Party at Olivia's  Friday night, Olivia threw a little house party, inviting a few friends over for dinner and a sleep over.  Eileen, Rick, Johanna, Oscar, Rowena, and Chris came over, and we ended up having dinner and playing some drinking games.  We had Olivia's famous pasta, El Pollo bbq chicken, Pizza from Little Ceasars, Salmon, Sushi, Toquitos, Garlic Fries, Banana Cake, and Icecream. We tried a few new games we found online, like Go-Fish, ABCs, none of which were any good.  We ended up playing the classic "Kings Cup" all night, where Rowena ended up picking the last King 3 times in a row.  I brought the Magic Mic, so the girls ended up singing Kareoke.  Pretty fun night, we ended up sleeping at 5am. That really messed up my hours the morning, which I spent my entire Saturday sleeping!  I hate when I waste a whole weekend day, sleeping in and not doing anything productive.  Oh well...fun party at Olivia's.   Happy 30th Birthday Judy!  Judy celebrated her 30th bday today, at the Mayflower Restaurant in Milpitas.  She invited us for lunch, along with her family and friends.  Great Chinese restaurant, with some great dishes.  Actually, this is where my friends Nick and Diep will have their wedding reception in two weeks, so I'm excited for another round of Mayflower's dishes.  Happy Birthday Judy!  Thanks again for inviting us!   Halloween Costumes  Nate and Michele are throwing a Halloween party on Saturday, so Olivia and I shopped around for costumes Sunday. Olivia wanted to be a ??, but I didn't quite feel the matching outfit.  I wanted something a little less dark/scary, and more jolly.  We ended up getting nothing at the Halloween Superstore.  Well, we have a few days left to find something!

       Mad All Day Long!  Yes, I was mad all day long today...furious actually.  You wouldn't believe what happened to me today!  Of all things that could happen, this was definitely a first....and I'm not sure why it pissed me off!   Lunch With Olivia  Well, this past Tuesday Olivia drove to SJ to have lunch with me, and to visit our new building.  It was also our anniversary, so we celebrated by having lunch at Banana Leaf, a Malaysian restaurant in Macarthy Ranch.  It's one of my favorite places for lunch...great dishes, every bite so flavorful, long waits for a table..my coworkers and I go there a lot!  We ordered some classic pad thai, some spicy red curry chicken, and siam salmon!  Delicious!  Anyways, we had so much leftovers, I ended up taking it back to work.  I decided to keep it for lunch the next day.  So I did what anyone else would do...I put it in the fridge!   Craving the Leftovers  So on my way home after work that day, I thought about lunch, the leftovers, and wished I had taken it home for dinner!  I could still smell and taste the siam salmon, and I craved that left over pad thai and curry chicken. Unfortunately, I would have to wait for the following day.   Ross's Turkey Sandwich  So all morning long, my taste buds definitely looked forward to the leftovers from yesterday.  When lunch time hit, I walked over to the lunch room, opened up the fridge, and for some reason...I didn't see my container of leftovers.  I searched each shelf of the fridge, high and low, and even checked the freezer...in case I placed it there accidentally.  It was no where to be found!  I panicked.  I felt like Ross, in that one episode of Friends, where someone stole his Holiday Turkey Sandwich at work.  I was mad, and furious that someone would do such a thing.  Then I looked in the trash can right by the fridge, and saw my container... partially opened.   At first I thought that it couldn't be...but I knew it was mine, because the container had the markings of the siam salmon, the red curry chicken, and pad thai I had been craving all day!  I was soo mad!  Someone ate my leftovers!    Benefit of the Doubt  At first I thought it was an accident.  Maybe someone took it by mistake and ate it.  But then I realized that the person must of knew it wasn't their lunch.  Someone had the nerve to take someone else's food, heat it up in the microwave, bring it to their cube, open the container, see the food, and eat the red curry chicken, enjoy the deliciuos pad thai, and savor the siam salmon...and toss it in the same trash can by the fridge so the actual owner could see!  Benefit of the doubt my @#$!  Yes, I felt like a victim...as if someone stole something precious to me, deprived me of what rightfully belonged to me, stabbed me in the back while I wasn't looking, betrayed my trust.  Someone ate my leftovers!  Not sure how anyone else would have felt...but I felt a little sad, just because I was looking forward to it.  That also made me feel mad...knowing that someone could do such a thing.     Over reacting?  Maybe I'm over reacting, and that this sort of thing happens all the time.  It's only left-overs right?  Wrong...it was MY leftovers!  Ask Ross Gellar of Friends...."You ate my SANDWICH!!!??!!"

       Spookalicious 2003  Nate and Michele threw a halloween party at their place in SF.  So this year, Olivia and I dressed up for the first time in 3 years.  She dressed up as "OLvira" and I was "The Count!"  Pretty fun Halloween this year, seeing everyone dress up.  Let's see, we had a butterfly, Batman and his parents, clark kent, a college boy with a velvet collar, Sydney Bristow, Boo-T-Licious, Roaring Ruby and The Big Cheese, Cream from some young Guy, Mr. LA Raper, and a Japanese Girl.  We played some drinking games, walked around the city, checked out different bars, and saw a ton of city folks dressed up! The best costume I saw was a guy dressed as a pinata! He asked Shirley to hit him with a stick....a cool thing was candy falling out of his hat!     urlLink Check out the pictures!    Nick's Bachelor Party  Last Saturday was also Nick's Bachelor Party!  I must say that I have never been to a bachelor party like this one!  Definitely one party I will never forget!  Let's see...what happened that night? I bet Nick doesn't even remember himself.  Well, basicially we all met up in the city, to have dinner at the Steps of Rome near Broadway.  During the night, Nick apparently drank a little too much wine.  I think he also has a shot or two before dinner.  Well, by the time our dinner came, Nick was knocked out...and started to throw up.   The guys took him outside, to get some air, but by then....the night had ended before it could begin.  Nick was out of commission, and was taken home.  Definitely a unique night.  Unfortunately us guys failed our duty, to get Nick some booty. =)   However, in the spirit of bachelor parties, some of us did continue the celebrations in Nick's honor....Deja Vu!  I did capture some great shots of this memorable night...but not sure if I should post them up.  Email me if you're interested!

       Jewel Concert  Olivia and I saw Jewel perform last night, at the Flint Center in Cupertino.  Great concert! The entire concert was acoustic, so all she had on stage was a mic, her guitar, and her voice.  I really enjoy unplugged type music, or acoustic versions of songs. There's just something about singers singing their song, with only the guitar accompanying their voice.  The performance feels more intimate, and you can really appreciate their voice without numerous instruments or background noise to clutter their talent.  Jewel has a great voice! She even sang an Italian opera song!  The entire week, I listened to her new cd, to learn her new songs.  So when she performed a song I recognized, it was fun singing along.  There were a good # of songs I didn't recognize from old albums.  Anyways, she was awesome!  Very entertaining, telling lot's of jokes and personal stories.  I also never realized how HOT Jewel is! =)

       Crabbing at Fort Baker  I spent my Sunday Crab fishing at Fort Baker, with Rex, Rick, and Evan.  We had 8 crab nets for the 4 of us, which helped get some good coverage on the dock.  We caught a good number of Rock Crabs, which ranged from 4 to 8 inches wide, across the shell.  Not too bad!  Crabbing is hard work, but I actually enjoy catching crab.  It’s definitely a lot easier than fishing. Last time we went fishing, we spent the whole day and didn’t get a bite!  For crabbing, all you do is throw the net over the dock, wait 5-10 minutes, and you caught some crabs!  Bringing something home to cook and enjoy, makes the sore arms, dry stinky hands, and wet clothes worth while.    I haven’t tried eating the crabs I brought home yet, but my parents are pretty excited about them.  Hope they taste good!   Congrats Dinner Party  Last Friday, I threw a Congrats dinner party at the house, for Olivia.  Congrats for getting a new job!  I invited our close friends over to the house for dinner.  For starters, Olivia made some Caesar Salad. For dinner, we cooked Oven Roasted Pork Ribs, Sweet Garlic Corn, Olivia’s Famous Pasta with Hotdogs, Roasted Herb Potatoes, and Garlic Bread.  For dessert, we had brownies, turon(fried bananas), and vanilla icecream.  I can’t believe we fed 21 people!  Thanks everyone for coming and hanging out!  Pictures to come soon!   Nick and Diep’s Wedding  Last weekend, my friends Nick and Diep finally tied the knot!  Great wedding, well organized and lot’s of fun!  Olivia and I helped decorate the church, which we enjoyed.  They had their ceremony at the Buddhist Temple in San Jose. Reception followed at the Mayflower Restaurant in Milpitas.  Congrats once again Nick and Diep!  Check out the pics!

       Cirque de Soleil - Alegria  Saturday night, Kitchie, Damon, Olivia and I watched "Cirque de Soleil - Alegria" in San Francisco.  It's practically a circus for adults, with all sorts of skits and death defying stunts and acrobatics, high air swinging and jumping, along with your classical circus elements such as a funny clown, the strongest man in the world, singing and dancing, fire, etc.  Great show!They sent up a huge tent in the parking lot of PacBell Park.  This show is awesome, and I highly recommend it.  Very enjoyable for the entire family.  Thanks Kitchie for getting tickets!   Thanksgiving Holidays  Who doesn't eat a lot during Thanksgiving?  Well, I definitely did, since Olivia's family and my family had dinner.  For Thanksgiving this year, I went to Olivia's house for dinner on Thursday, and they had great dishes and lot's of turkey!  I gained 5 lbs from that dinner alone.  Then the next night, we had dinner at my house, and I probably gained another 5 from more turkey and ham.  Not only that, there's left-overs!  That's another 5lbs.  Oh boy, just call me a stuffed turkey.  Definitely a fun time of the year, makes you reflect on what you're thankful for!  I'm thankful for my family, my friends, my wonderful Olivia, my job, my home, my health, and my happiness.  Who can ask for anything more...Toyota.  So many people out there w/ nothing much...makes me appreciate everything I'm blessed with.   Thankgiving at the Lee's  Last week, my friends Nelson and Christina had a Thankgiving Holiday dinner for all our SCU friends.  Great dinner and lot's of fun. She had a kareoke mic, so we sang lot's of songs.  The fun part was us guys competing w/ the girls for higher scores.  Not sure why us guys love to compete...maybe it's because the girls are always better than us...nah!  "Men, men, men..MEN!"  =)   Christmas Just Around the Corner  Whenever I drive now, I listen to 96.5FM.  THey play non stop holiday music, and it really gets me in the mood.  Christmas is just around the corner, and it's definitely an exciting time of the year.   Favorite Time of the Year  Right about now is Olivia's and my favorite time of the year.  Around this time was when we started dating and getting to know each other really well.  These cold nights, rainy days, walking around holding each other's hands to keep warm, seeing Olivia in a beenie and warm jacket, going out to see shows, sharing an umbrella, or going shopping in the malls, reminds me of our early dating days.  It was actually in December when we officially became boyfriend and girlfriend.  It definitely brought us closer  I wouldn't mind a December wedding, despite the cold, rainy weather.  Wouldn't that be great to see Olivia in a wedding dress wearing a beanie?  When are you going to ask me Olivia?  =)   Lack of Sleep  The past two weeks, I haven't had enough sleep.  Lot's going on for Olivia and myself to think about.  All this excitement going on, stress, not enough time in the day to stop and smell the apple trees.    I just woke up from a 3 hrs power nap.  Feels good to regenerate.  Daytime naps does mess up my sleeping pattern at night, so I may be up all night.

       LOTR - Return of the King  I watched the final episode last night, with Olivia and her former coworkers from Incyte.  We went to Century Theatres in Union City.  Luckily Jimmy bought tickets in advanced, and waited in line for us.  Tons of people in line, and we waited for quite a while.  I didn't notice any hard core fans (i.e. dressed up in costumes).  I'm sure that happened for the midnight showing.  Overall Great movie!  "Sad, really sad!" according to Viet.  I didn't fully understand the ending, if they were hinting another espisode.  Oh well...probably not.  Go see it!

       Non-Stop Holiday Parties!  December is definitely my favorite time of the year!  Lot's of holiday parties, gift exchanges, delicious foods, family and friends, laughs, and good times.  This entire weekend was practically a non-stop holiday party with all our friends!  It was definitely a fun filled weekend!   SCU Holiday Party  Friday night, it started with our friends from Santa Clara.  We had our annual Xmas Potluck / Gift Exchange at the Louie residence in East Palo Alto.  Great night w/ college friends, lots of laughs, good appetizers, and plenty of gift stealing!  We played the white elephant game, and I ended up with a crock pot!  I love my new crock pot, and can't wait to try it out.  Sorry Johannah, I know you wanted it badly! =)  I'll get you one for your wedding!  =)  We also played a new game, which I called "The Twelve Days of Christmas - Unplugged".   It was just something I thought of while driving in the car, listening to non-stop Christmas music on 96.5.  Basically, everyone creates a new version of the song, replacing the original words with something creative or funny, and we all sing along!  It was pretty fun hearing what people came up with.  I wasn't sure how it would work, since I had it planned for my high school party.  But it worked out really well.  I'll post the lyrics once I get them!  Creative stuff!   urlLink Check out the pictures!     SHC Annual Christmas Party / Gift Exchange  Then on Saturday, I hosted my annual high school Xmas get together at the house.  Every year my friends from Sacred Heart Cathedral have a potluck and white elephant gift exchange.  We've been doing this since 1995.  The night was a lot of fun, and I had a great time seeing all my high school friends again.    Throughout the night, we played a bunch of games!  It was cool to see everyone participate and get into it.  First game we played was a rule game, where everyone got a sticker.  Basically, if someone catches you breaking any of the rules, they take all your stickers!  There were a lot of sneaky players (George Carino) that stole people's stickers!  Whoever had the most stickers in the end won a cool prized.  We then played the White Elephant game w/ $5 gag gifts.  Something new Charles came up with, which was fun.  We had a $5 gag gift, and a $25 nice gift, so we played the White Elephant game twice!  After that, we also played the 12 Days of Christmas Unplugged, which was really funny.  Here were the lyrics my high school friends came up with: On the ___ day of Christmas, my true love gave to me: First - A hot dog from Serramonte Second - 2 Penis Pumps Third - 3 French Fries Fourth - 4 Minute Blow Jobs Fifth- 5 Friendster Whores Sixth - 6 Shakka Callers Seventh - 7 Smirfs a Smoking Eighth - 8 Men a Whacking Ninth - 9 Elves Masturbating Tenth - 10 Pot Heads Smoking Eleventh - 11 Hoes a F***ing Twelfth - 12 Sonny's Pornos   We also played a Xmas pictionary game, guys versus girls!  This was a lot of fun.  The guys won, winning a roll of Christmas wrapping paper!  We also played this puzzle game, and sang Karaoke.  I can't believe there were so much left-overs!!!!  It was definitely nice to spend some quality time w/ old high school friends, and to see how close our circles of friends still are.  A few actually stayed over till 5am in the morning!  We chatted and caught up on all the gossip, reminiscing about the good old days.  We even looked at old high school pictures and the year book.  We were all so skinny and funny looking.  Charles definitely changed the most...he had a kid and play hair cut, and was super skinny!  =)   urlLink Check out the pictures    I Love Wine & Winter Holidays  Then on Sunday, we had a holiday get together w/ our friends from Berkeley.  Jane hosted this party at her new condo in Oakland.  Lot's more fun, for the 3rd day in a row!  We had lots of great bottles of wine, with a cool wine journal where you write down what you thought about the different wines.  Lot's of great food, too!  We also played the white elephant game, and I ended up with an 80's Game.  Luckily Chris was kind enough to trade his gift with me. I really wanted his gift, which was 6 wine glasses/a cool wine bottle opener, and a bottle of wine).  Thanks Chris for the trade, I owe you one!  We then played several rounds of Taboo.  Of course, guys versus girls!  Guess who won? Definitely not the guys...we had to take 2 shots of Grappa, a cognac from Italy.    We also played Mafia!  I love this game, and I can never win at this game.  We played several rounds, and the Killer was never able to win!  Fun night!   urlLink Check out the pictures!

       Happy New Year!  Wow! Goodbye 2003, hello 2004!  It's finally that time of the year again, when you can start a new fresh beginning.  Everything a person did or didn't do last year, for some reason can be resolved / forgiven / and improved with the new year.  Yes, that is all done through new year's resolutions!   Here are my top 10 resolutions for 2004!    1) Save more money / more $$ towards investment!  I spent way too much money last year, and didn't save enough.  Spent money on things I didn't really need, or wasted it on getting a good buzz!   Ideally, I'd like to buy only things that I NEED, versus things that I WANT.  I'd also like to continue to learn more about investing, and to put more money saved into various investments.  Who doesn't want to retire early?   2) Exercise Regularly / be more active / watch less television  Yes, I started off last year exercising and feeling good, but ended the year w/ extra weight and feeling heavy!  Again, my goal is to be more active, and to exercise regularly!  The only way is to get off that couch at home, go outside, and do something active!  I'd like to lose 10 lbs this year, and get back to sophomore year weight of 165!! =)   3) Go to Church weekly / pray daily  Last year, I missed some weeks of Church for various reasons.  I'd like to make a conscious effort to go to church weekly, or at least 3 times  a month!  I did pray regularly last year, which I was proud off, and I shall try to continue that throughout 2004!   4) Eat healthier food / less fast food, fried foods, sweets  I love KFC and anything fried!  French fried, fried chicken, lumpia, fried crab wontons, fried vegetables, and anything  battered and fried!  Plus I love chocolate!  But no, I will not give up anything fried or chocolate covered in 2004!  Wowever, I will try to consume those items in less quantities and less frequently, and try to eat more fruits and vegetables instead! =)  5) Maintain friendships, old and new Friends are definitely important to me, but many I have lost touch with many throughout the years.  I'd like to try to maintain the friendships I have, especially those I've lost touch with, and to try to make new ones as well throughout the year!  6) Spend more quality time with the family With everyone being so busy with work, school, having different schedules, and living their own lives, it's tough to spend quality time with my family.  Usually on special occasions we get together, like birthdays or thanksgiving, or Christmas.  I'd like to make an effort to spend more quality time with my parents and sisters, as much as possible and whenever possible!  7) Be more generous / less self focused I need to focus less on myself and my needs, and focus more on the needs of others.  It's easy to be concerned about what I need and want, and easy to forget about the needs of the ones you love.  I'd like to be more generous towards my family and friends. The old saying goes, "the more you give, the more you'll get back in return!"  8) Learn new things What have I learned this passed 2003?  I don't know.  My goal for 2004 is to learn something new, either a musical talent, a physical activity, or a new technology beneficial for my career!  Hopefully by next year, I can say that I learned something that I am proud of.  9) Read more literature Yes, I need to read more literature, besides stock quotes, sports, and Maxim magazines!  10) Try new things! Yes, life is too short to be doing the same things over and over, because it's 'comfortable'.  I'd like to try new things in 2004, like eat at different restaurants, try out new dishes I haven't tried, visit new places I've never seen, and just do things I usually wouldn't do or try!  Hopefully that will open up a new perspective of the world and of life!  These resolutions definitely look similar to last year's! Oh well, definitely good goals for anyone!  Happy New Years!  Good luck with your own personal resoluations this year!

      Hi Friends and Family,  I just want to say a deep heart felt “Thank You!”  Thanks for coming out Friday night to celebrate my 26th Birthday!  That night was one of the biggest days in my life, and it truly meant the world to me to have both my family and friends, to come out and celebrate, and to witness a very special event in my life.  Not only did I turn 26 that day, but I asked the love of my life to marry me!  To share such a momentous milestone w/ the people Olivia and I care about, and with those that care about us, made that night truly special!    Proposing to Olivia and her accepting my proposal made me the happiest guy in the world!  Being able to share that once in a life time moment with you all, to witness our love for each other, really topped off the night!  I want to thank all of you who came that night, for making that night a success!  I remember at the beginning of the night, I felt a little nervous…typical, I assume for all guys about to propose.  All these thoughts ran through my head!  “What will I say?” / “What will I do?” / “Will the words come out right, or will I sound stupid?” / “Am I ready?” / “Is she ready?” And more importantly, “Will Olivia say NO?”     Then I thought about how much I love Olivia, how wonderful she is, and how much she loves me…and I doubted that she would ever say no!  And at that point, I started to relax, knowing that things will work out, and that we love each other so much. I started to feel more comfortable the rest of the night before the proposal.  I didn’t know when the right opportunity would come, but I thought I would wait when the time was right.   After we finished up dinner, and I opened my birthday gifts, I decided to give everyone a toast.  I truly felt thankful for a lot of blessing in my life, that not very often do I express my thanks and gratitude.  Having all the spotlight I decided to finally thank everyone for all I was grateful for!    I first thanked my friends, who I am truly grateful for.  I recalled a poem from elementary school, called “A Friend for Life”, which I shared with everyone.  Being as old as I am, I didn’t remember the middle portion of the poem (but I will definitely try to find it).  It went something like this:  It’s hard to write, when you don’t have a pen.  It’s hard to help, when you don’t lend a hand.  We often take for granted the things in life, like laughing, crying, and the people we like.   ….then I forgot the middle. But it ends something like:  It’s easy to write, when you have a pen.  It’s easy to help, when you do lend a hand.  Do not take for granted the things in life.  Because a friend indeed, is a friend for life!  That poem taught me not to take for granted the things in life, especially friends!  And I thanked all my friends for their friendship!  I consider all of your friends for life!  I also made a toast to my parents.  I wanted to thank them for everything, for being pen pals in the Philippines, for falling in love, for bringing me into this world, and for loving each other for 28+ years!  They have raised me to be the person I am today, the values I have, and for everything I am, I owe it to them.  I also toasted my sisters, who have always been there for me.  For laughing at my jokes when they weren’t funny, and for pretending my corny magic tricks were good when they were bad, for everything they have done for me!  They have also made me who I am today.  I wanted to thank my family, the most important people in my life!  That night, I had called Olivia’s sister, to help me invite her parents to the dinner!  Fortunately Olivia’s parents were able to make it, because I wanted to give a special toast to her parents, too!  I thanked them for falling in love, for loving each other for 30+ years, and for bringing Olivia to this world.  If it weren’t for them, I wouldn’t be as happy as I am now.  And to Olivia’s sisters, for making me feel welcome to their family!  I gave them all special cheers!  And last but not least, I thanked God, for all his blessings.  God has blessed w/ me so many blessing, and every night I thank him for everything I have.   Then I think I started to ramble on, like I’m doing now in this letter.  I told everyone about the first time I met Olivia.  It was at Santa Clara, in my old apartment.  Across the way lived some mutual friends of ours, and I happened to pass by one day she was there.  Do you know when you meet someone at a party or club, and you start to stare at them…and right when their eyes turn your way, typically you would turn away or your eyes would shy away?  Well, that night, when I saw Olivia, my eyes did not shy away.  I wanted to absorb as much of her as possible!  She has the cutest smile, and beautiful eyes, and her personality made me want to get to know her better!  I knew she was special.   Fortunately we got to become friends and know each other better.   My fondest moment of Olivia was on December 4, 1999.  We were hanging out in Berkeley one day, and we felt hungry.  Being the poor hungry college students we were, we decided to grab some food at Jack in the Box.  Berkeley being Berkeley, this Jack in the Box had a bullet proof window! I recalled the driving though Jack in the Box w/ the bullet proof window, and ordering my 99 cents items, and Olivia ordering her items.  As we drove away, I took a huge bite of my Jumbo Jack.  As I took a bite, she asked me this question:  “Will you be my boyfriend?”  I nearly chocked!  Never before as anyone asked me that question!  I don’t think any guy has ever heard that question! But then I knew that she was special!  She was definitely special!  Ever since then, we had a running joke.  I always asked her when she was going to propose to me.  She asked me to be her boyfriend, I looked forward to the day she would ask me to marry her!  I decided to ask her one last time, but to let her know that no longer will I ever ask her that.  That today was the day it was my turn to ask.   I think at this point, she started to cry.  I had my mom hold the ring throughout the night, afraid I might lose it.  So I asked my mom for the ring, and got down on one knee.    And the rest is history!  I’d like to thank each one of you for making that night memorable, and for sharing in our joy and happiness!  Yes, I’m getting sentimental, because I’m really happy! =)  But really, I can’t thank you all enough!  I value each of your friendship, and as the poem I recited goes, “Do not take for granted the things in life, because a friend indeed is a friend for life!”  I consider you all friends for life!  For those that we not able to attend that night, I have not forgotten about you!  Thanks for your friendship, your happy birthdays, and sincere congratulations!  I wish that all of you would have been there!  I posted the pictures on my website, so check them out!  Luckily we captured some of the night on video, and you’re all welcome to relive that moment!  Talk to you all soon!  And to my new fiancée, I love you!  Sincerely, - Alan

       My 26th Birthday at F&A's  For my 26th birthday, Olivia organized a pretty cool birthday dinner, inviting all our good friends and family to Fanny and Alexander, in Burlingame! She made reservations at F&A's for about 30+ guests, and luckily the place only took our reservation and no other due to the large size of our party.  So fortunately, our party were the only ones there for dinner! It seemed as if we had the entire place to ourselves, because the chefs practically cooked meals for our dinner alone.  It felt like we had a private party, which was cool! =)  I haven't been there before, and not knowing the place worried me a bit, but I was pleasantly surprised what a great place it was!  I couldn't of asked for a better place for such a special night!  Along with dinner came free dancing/ clubbing!   Best Birthday Ever  Anyways, I had such an awesome time that night!  I must say that it was one of the best nights of my life!  The people that I wanted there that night were there.  I invited my parents, who came to celebrate.  My two sisters and their significant others were there to celebrate, too!  So my entire family attended that night, which really meant the world to me.    I also invited Olivia's family, both her sisters and parents.  Fortuantely, Olivia's parents came by to celebrate!  Thank you all for coming, and especially to Kitchie for doing me a big favor!  I felt happy that Olivia's family came that night, too!!!  And definitely a lot of my really good friends came!  That night, I knew who the important people and true friends in my life were!  Those that came that night, showed me who really cared about me.  My heart felt truly thankful for each person that came out that night!  As a gift to all those who came, I decided to share a very very important moment in my life.  I know there were a few people I wished came out that night, but couldn't for various reasons.  I have not forgotten about you all, and also appreciate your sincere happy birthdays, your friendship, and your congrats!   Thanks again Friends and Family!  Thank you all for coming, and for sharing that special night for me!  Thank you all for the great memories past and future, and for all your love and friendship!  I value each one of you and our friendship we share!  Really, I can't thank you all enough for coming out that night!!!!   Pictures!  Please check out the  urlLink pictures  from the very special night!  Tons of pics taken.  Thanks also to Ben and Audrey for capturing that night on video.   More to come...  Ok, enough for now...more details to come from that special night.

       Wedding Planning  Yes, that is what your life will revolve around when you propose to your girlfriend and get engaged!  My fellow single brothers...beware!  Immediately after Olivia and I got engaged, the planning for the big wedding day began!  Before I knew it, we had several appointments w/ reception venues!  Wow!  I was really surprised when Olivia told me she had contacted numerous places and booked several appointments for us.  I could of sworn I had just proposed a few hours earlier!!! =)   I guess she was really excited to get started w/ the wedding planning.  I bet girls are like that. They have their wedding already planned out in their heads, even prior to getting engaged.  Even as little girls, I'm sure women have ideas of their perfect wedding.  I know one of our good friends has her wedding already planned out in her head.  I won't say any names, but you can ask Dale DeLeon who I'm talking about. :)   Thanks Fiancee!  I'm glad Olivia is really into that stuff, because calling places and setting up appointments definitely is not my cup of tea.  Olivia enjoys getting on the phone, making calls, asking questions, so I'm actually fortunate in that arena of wedding planning!  Thanks fiancee!  I appreciate it!  I'd like to think that all I have to do is propose and show up to the wedding!  =)  Only if life was that simple...   Major Steps  The first major step in our wedding planning roller coaster ride was deciding on a day and booking the Church immediately. DONE!  Second step, which I assume is correct, is booking the reception place.  That step is a little tougher than it seems.  This step isn't as quick as the first one.  Last weekend, Olivia and I started shopping around for possible reception places.  Olivia set up a few appointments w/ some interesting locations.  It's definitely overwhelming at first, but it does take a lot of planning, decision making, and calculations to find that perfect place.  So many factors to consider, from how much per head, to ample parking for our guests, to the distance from the Church, to the size of the dance floor, to yes...the bathrooms!     Restrooms! Critical to the Perfect Wedding  One place we went to, wanted to show us their restrooms!  I guess that is an important feature of possible locations...the bathrooms.  To be honest, that's what I actually look for now, when we visit different locations...the restrooms!    Are they clean?  How many stalls?  Do they have complimentary fragrance or cologne?  Is there a person passing out towels that requires a tip?  Are the restrooms modern or old school?  Automatic flush or manual flush?  That is actually a very critical component to wedding reception....something that many engaged couples over look when planning their wedding. Crucial to an exciting wedding day!   Exciting Times  Wedding planning is definitely fun and exciting.  But it's a lot of work!  I thought the hardest thing about getting married is asking the parents for their blessing and the actually proposal.  You know what?  That is actually the easiest part!  Planning for the big day is the hard part!   My Wedding Dreams  I want a nice small personal wedding, with just our close family and friends.  Nothing to big and extravagant like my sister's 560+ guests, where they invited all their family, extended family, friends, friends + 1 guest, etc.    I wouldn't mind something very small and simple, with around 100-150 of our closest friends and family.  I want to be able to talk to each of our guests, and spend time with everyone during the wedding reception.  As far as the place, I want a place that is pleasant and nice, has some nice picture spots and scenery, something that is affordable for our budget,  good food, good location, and an excellent restroom facility!  The restrooms of the venues will be my deciding factor.   3rd Step  I'll let you know what that step is when we find a reception spot w/ the high tech, state of the art restrooms!

       Covad Winter Gala  Saturday my company had it's winter gala at  urlLink Hayes Mansion  in San Jose.  Beautiful place!  I took my fiancee with me, and she got  a chance to meet some of my coworkers.  Actually, no one from my direct team went, but a few from software did go.  Kinda sucks that my team has no spirit, and are not into events like this.  But it was fun to introduce Olivia to some people from Covad.  Overall, dinner was pretty good.  Great appetizers, and a good selection for the buffet.  They also had a live band,  urlLink The Heart Beats !  Very entertaining, singing songs from the 70s-80s, like the Beatles, Village People, Elvis, Tom Jones, some motown hits, and disco, too!  Not only did they perform the songs, they dressed up w/ wigs and costumes!   The night was fun, and we got some possible ideas for our wedding.   Reception Hunting Continues  Yes, all day Saturday we continued our hunt for a reception location.  We visited Santa Clara Adode Lodge, the Marriot Hotel, and David's.  It's tough finding the perfect place.  Places are either too small, too expensive, too far, or too many extra charges.    I think our hunt continues again next weekend!     Butterfly Effect  My little sister got free tickets from school, so we watched it for FREE!  I love free movies.  Overall, I thought it was an awesome movie!  Go watch it...and great ready for some thrills!

       Lost All My Work Email  Yes, I did!  Gone, all gone!  Not sure what happened exactly, and neither does our IS department, but it definitely sucks that all the email I had in my inbox are gone!  What happened was that we had a presentation, and I had to log into my manager's laptop to set things up. I just happened to open up Outlook for a second, and then I just closed it.    Well, after our presentation ended, which went well btw...I came back to my cube, checked my email, only to find all my email gone!  Only emails sent to me since 1:19pm were available.  What the heck happened!  Well, the IS guy helping me couldn't figure out what happened.  My emails weren't archived in any of my desktops or the laptop.   I had a ton of emails w/ very important information, which I need for my job.   They opened up a Ticket, #35583, and will get back to me tomorrow morning.    Say "bye bye email!"

       Saving Money  Saving money is a tough thing to do!  Especially with so many expenses to worry about, numerous events to attend, dinners and outings with friends,  new gadgets and toys of interest?saving money can be a challenge!    They say one great way to save is to categorize things as a "WANT" or a "NEED".  Yes, it's truly a simple concept, yet so challenging for me because of the endless number of things that qualify in the "WANT" category.  I WANT to buy new shoes, I WANT to go out, I WANT to travel, I WANT a new computer, I WANT this, I WANT that, I WANT WANT WANT!!!  Everything I see is a want!  It bites, truly it does, but it put things into perspective for me.  I actually have been saving and have been sacrificing on a lot of wants, and just spending on my needs.    Actually, there isn't much that I want these days.  I pretty much have everything I need.  Now, I actually have to save for our big day next year!

       Super Bowl Sunday  Sunday, I hung out w/ the Berkeley crew in Oakland, at Oscar's place.  Since Jane was out of town, he decided to host the Super Bowl party at their condo. =)  Before the game, we went to Rick's favorite Taco truck in Oakland, to feast on some grubbin' Mexican food.  The tacos were pretty good...greasy, fried in lard, spicy, authentic tacos!  Good stuff.  I only had 3 tacos, while some of the other guys had 6-7!  I'm trying to watch what I eat, or at least eat things in moderation.  After we ate, we watched the game at Oscar's.    Good game overall.  Slow start, but things started to get exciting by half time.  Eileen, actually won twice in her company pool.  I think she won $375, with 0-4 as her numbers.  Lucky girl...she promised to treat us all to tacos the next time we eat at the Taco truck!   Commercials  The Super Bowl commercials this year were good.  My favorite was the Coors Lite commercial with the donkey with leg hair extensions...trying to be one of those Coors  horses.  Funny!  I couldn't stop laughing.  I enjoyed the half time show!  =)     Diep's Birthday  Saturday night, Diep celebrated her 26 birthday!  Nick planned a surprise birthday at his house in Saratoga.  They made all kinds of sushi, so we ate that all night.  Good stuff.  We also took some sake bombs!  We all played Texas Hold 'em for a few hours, and guess who won?  I did.  For the first time, I actually won in Poker. =)  I won about $60.  It was pure luck, because I kept getting good cards....I actually won on the river card a few times.  One time I won on the kicker card.  And a few times I just bluffed.  Of course, we also played Mafia!  Happy Birthday Diep!   Chris's Birthday  Friday night, my friend Chris turned 26.  He celebrated w/ a bunch of friends at BJ's Brewery in Cupertino.  Pretty cool place!  We had an all you can eat buffet of pizza, pasta, and salad.  Happy Birthday bro!

       Blog Slacker  That is what I am.   Come back next week. =)   Weekend in Review  I basically hung out with Olivia the entire weekend.    Friday, we watched TV at Olivia's place.  Saturday, we continued our hunt for a reception location that fits perfectly with our needs (size, venue, location, and price$$).  We visited South San Francisco Conference center, where my sister had her wedding.  We also visited the Pacific Athletic Club in Redwood City...nice, too!  We also celebrated Christina's 26th Birthday at a Hawaiian Restaurant in SF, which was fun.    Sunday, we went shopping, I got a new cell phone, and we hung out with Bev and Gary!  Gary showed me his apple computer, and motivated me to finally get one!  I'm now on the hunt for a new apple.  Of course, it's dependent on our budget. =)   Work  Work is also getting interesting.  Basically, too much politics going on, and non-stop changes.  It does scare me, as far as job security is concerned...but all I can do is focus on my projects and do well.   Rich Dad, Poor Dad  I found the book lying in Olivia's room, so I started to read it.  GREAT BOOK!  I'm on the last chapter, and I plan on rereading it again.  It's an easy read, and you can totally relate it. The book does motivate you to think differently, which I intend to do finacially.  Lot's of great points throughout the book, and I highly recommend it for those who want to get out of the "Rat Race" world most of us live in.

       Reception Hunting Continues  Is this all I ever talk about?  Well, that's because my fiancee and I are still on the hunt for a reception location.  Hopefully by the end of this month, we will have decided on a place!  Last weekend, we visited The Clarion, near SFO.  The grand ballroom was really nice, good packages, location is fine, seat covers and cake are included, and we were able to negotiate on the prices!  So this is one of our top 3 locations.   Bye Bye Manager  Last Friday my manager got laid off from work.  So our team went out during lunch to a Thai Restaurant, as a going away.  According to upper management, my manager didn't meet certain expectations, and asked her to leave.  I felt bad, seeing someone get the boot, after they put a lot of effort into their job.  But I guess that's the way it goes, if you don't meet expectations, you're at risk.     It does make me feel uncomfortable about work and job security.  All I can really do is work hard and smart, and do well on my projects.  Job security is definitely a false reality.     Happy Birthday Kitchie  Valentine's day was also Kitchie's Bday.  She celebrated at an Ethiopian Restaurant called The Blue Nile, in Berkeley.  Definitely an interesting place, but it's lots of fun eating Ethiopian food.  You should try it!   Sick  I think I got the flu.  I'm sneezing and coughing, and I feel so tired.  The weather isn't helping.  I just want to go home and sleep.   Another pair bites the dust  Congrats to Darren and Stacy!

       Wedding Fairs  We attended one last night, at the Decathlon Club in Santa Clara.  What I love most about them are the freebies!  Last night they passed out champagne, delicious appetizers, and pieces of cake!  Not only that, we got a chance to talk to a variety of wedding vendors, from videographers to florists to honeymoon planners.  Seeing all these people offering their services, made me realize that weddings = BIG business!  I think if I ever start a small business, it would have to be related to weddings...maybe videography.   Texas Hold'em  Mark held a Lakers vs Kings night, so after the wedding fair we passed by.  Olivia wanted to see Diana's big belly, since it's been 6 months already!  Diana showed us her sonogram of her baby, which were really cool!  I thought they were funny because the pictures had arrows labeled "boy" pointing to a little spike....it was the baby's little wee-wee! =)  We also played Texas Hold'em, which is so addicting!  It was a precursor to their Casino night next weekend.  $1 buy-in!  Diana swept the house, adding $5 to her baby fund.  I wonder how much she'll sweep next weekend for her birthday!  =)  Watch out everyone, she's good!  =)

       UML in 24 Hours  That's the book I'm reading now. Unified Modeling Language...fun stuff!   I took a class that taught UML at Santa Clara, but that was 4 years ago.  I need to freshen up on the language.  Our Software department has been integrating UML into our current software development process this past year, and from I've seen, it's made a huge impact on all our projects!  UML is basically a visual modeling language, that enables system builders to create blueprints that capture ideas in a standard, easy to understand way, and provides a mechanism to effectively share and communicate these designs with others.  We started creating UMLs for all our major projects last year, and I have found it useful for all the projects I've worked on.  Interesting read!   Maxim  To balance everything out, I switch over to Maxim.  Yes, definitely a great read.  It has better pictures than UML diagrams! =) March has Elisha Cuthbert on the cover.  Nice.   Over due Library Books  I have about 10 itmes checked out of the Union City public library, that were due February 4th. Luckily I was able to renew then online.  I love technology!

       Reception Hunting is Over!  Yes, this past weekend, our hunt for a reception location finally ended.  Olivia and I finally decided on a place, one that met all of our criteria.  Actually, in many ways, it exceeded all our criteria and expectation, and that's why we chose it.    First of all, the location is excellent.  At first we considered having it in Berkeley, since that's where she went for college.  Since the ceremony will be in Santa Clara, the drive for our guests would have been difficult.  Well, the reception will be a 5-10 minute drive away!  The building / hotel is beautiful.  Once you drive towards it, the hotel has a really nice look and feel to it.  Cool water fountains decorate the front, beautiful entrance as you walk in, and plenty of parking spaces.  Many places we went to looked horrible and ghetto on the outside, and the people we met with tried extremely hard to sell the place.  This place spoke for itself.  The service is excellent, the ballroom is beautiful, their chairs are really nice (no need for chair covers), the bathrooms are great, the package is terrific, and the price...let's just say our budget has a smile on it's face!  For a 4 Star hotel, I'm happy with our choice.  =)  We're having it at the  urlLink Westin Hotel,  in Santa Clara.   What's Next?  I'm so happy that this part of the wedding planning is over! We spent a lot of time, and gas, visiting different locations, asking the same questions, going over packages upon packages, etc.  Seeing what we liked, and what we didn't like, made it worth the while when we finally picked this location.  We booked the Church, booked the Priest, and decided on a reception location!  =) It's nice to have some of the big stuff out of the way! I guess it's now time to work on the smaller details.  Oh joy!   Gift Registry  Olivia and I went to Crate and Barrel Sunday, to register for our wedding.  They had a special event for couples, to register for gift items.  Crate n Barrel gave us a free pair of champagne flutes! =)  I didn't really find too many items there that I really liked.  We were sort of forcing ourselves to scan some items.  Many things had too much color, like bright orange, yellow, green, blue.  I'm looking for a lot of natural colors, earthy tones, like brown, beige, whites, dark brown, etc.  I think Olivia and I want to decorate our future home w/ a earthy feel. I thought they would have a good selection of wicker type baskets, but unfortunately they didn't.  I want to decorate our home w/ lot's of natural looking things, with lot's of green plants (artifical is fine), with brushed stainless steel accessories in the kitchen.  Yes, I already have ideas for decorating our future home!   Kitty found a Boyfriend!  Last week, as I drove into my garage, Kitty ran outside to play.  She usually does that, as she likes to run around, climb the trees, play hide and seek in the bushes.  As I was removing my bag from my trunk, I noticed in the corner of my eye, another cat jumped on top of Kitty, and started humping away!  It appeared that Kitty was getting attacked by another cat, so I dropped by bag, and started waving my arms and screaming to scare the other cat.  I thought Kitty was getting raped.    The other cat jumped off of Kitty as I came closer, but apparently Kitty wasn't afraid of the other cat.  She followed the other cat, and they both ran off together!  I think she found a boyfriend!  I went inside to tell my dad, and he came outside to take a look.  We started to look for Kitty a few houses away.  As we walked a few steps, we heard Kitty scream this high pitched cat scream...as if she was getting raped!  Yes, that freaked me out, and I didn't know what to do.  The other cat was huge, probably twice the size of kitty.  I thought she might of been killed or was getting raped!  Well, midnight came, and Kitty was no where to be found.  That night, I looked out my window, and called Kitty's name.  And I saw her hiding in the bush in front of the house.  She walked out towards my call, and right behind her was the other cat!  Either this other cat is her boyfriend, and waited for her to get inside her home, or this cat is stalking her.  I thought it was cute, but scary at the same time.    My dad said that Kitty is a big girl now, and is probably tired of sitting in the garage, where it lives.  She's all grown up now, ready to have a relationship with other cats.  Every time I open our garage, she runs our looking in the direction where she met her boyfriend.  And she would run off, as if she knew where he lived.    It's kinda sad, seeing her run off like that, and coming home late at night.   I brought her into our house, when she was just a tiny kitty, 6 inches long.  I fed her and took care of her, and now she's all grown up now.  Now, she's running around at night with the neighborhood cats, playing hookie w/ a boy!    Yes, I think my Kitty is going to have babies!

       Pho Night  Friday night, Loan hosted another "Pho Night" at her family's house in San Jose.  Her mom cooked pho for everyone, and it tasted delicious.  Unfortunately I didn't have any meat in my bowl, due to Lent, so I passed on the various meat ingredients and created a 'vegetarian' bowl.  Good stuff.  We also played games, like Catch Phrase and Texas Hold'em.  Diana, the official queen of the game, won the tournament that night again!  She's definitely earning good money for her baby funds.  I'm looking forward to her Casino night next Friday. =)    Passion of Christ  Saturday afternoon, Olivia and I met up with Dale, Lisa, Rowena, and Jay at Milpitas Great Mall, to watch The Passion of Christ.  Rowena invited us to watch the movie w/ her, since her church got tickets.  After seeing all the previews on television, listening to tons of discussions about the movie, watching the making of the movie on TV, and hearing it on the radio, I felt excited to finally watch it.  The movie contained very powerful scenes, many scenes of pain, torture, blood, suffering...made me cringe a bit during the film.  The movie did give me a clearer picture and understanding of the magnitude of pain and suffering that Jesus suffered for the forgiveness of our sins.  Overall, I thought it was a great movie.  Very powerful.   Thai Food  After the movie, Olivia, Dale, Lisa, and I went to eat at this Thai restaurant outside of the theaters.  Good stuff!  Olivia and I ordered their pineapple fried rice and pad Thai.  I can still taste it!   Shopping for Wedding Bands  Olivia found the band she wants, and I found a band I thought was cool.  We're buying them at Kay's, since I have about $1500 in Santa Certificates towards any purchase.  The one Olivia picked out goes well with her engagement ring.  I couldn't find a band that matches hers exactly, but I did see a band I did like.  It was white gold, with either 1/4 karat tw, or 1/2 karat tw diamonds along the front.  I thought this band looked nice, but was wondering if guys get wedding bands lined with diamonds?  Usually I've seen simple bands, traditional white or gold bands, but haven't seen anyone yet w/ diamonds.    I'm just glad that bands are relatively affordable, compared to other wedding expenses.  Bands can run as low as $99!  My certificates end in July, so we have time to pick something out.   No Soda  I drink lot's of soda, which is BAD BAD BAD!  I probably buy a can of soda everyday at work during lunch.  Well, that's what I've given up for Lent.  So far so good, but I'm starting to crave some Dr. Pepper or Mountain Dew.  Olivia gave up meat for Lent, which I thought is a great sacrifice.  At the Thai Restaurant we ate it, picking dishes that she could eat was challenging.  We had to order dishes w/ no meat! I'm glad that she's not vegetarian all year round, because I love meat!

       Softball Season Underway  We played our first softball game Wednesday night, at  urlLink Twin Creeks  in Sunnyvalle.  Masterbatters, our team name, got some cool team shirts this year!  Fun game, but there were some good and bad news from that night.    GOOD News= WE WON, 14-12!  Our team played well, and came back from behind to take the lead.  Not bad for our first game of the season.  Plus we looked cool w/ our new shirts! =)  BAD News= I injured my knee, and I was out the rest of the game, w/ a bumb leg. PAINFUL!!!   What Happened?  In Softball, there's two bags at first, an inside bag (for the first baseman), and an outside bag (for the runner).  It's designed to prevent collisions between these two players.  On my first at bat and hit, I ran towards first, and the first baseman suddenly backs up into both bags, blocking my path.  He backed up his entire body as he was making the catch, covering both bags...and I ran right into him.  My left leg/knee slammed right into him, and I toppled over him.  Ouch...did that hurt.  As a result, my left leg was in pain, right in my knee, and I was out for the game.  I did make 2 at bat appearances, just to avoid an automatic out for the team.  At least the guy I ran into felt bad.  He said it was his first game, and didn't know the rules.  He gave me 2 tokens.   A Trip to the Hospital  Well, today after work, I went to Kaiser Permanente to have a doctor take a look. Fortunately there were no broken bones or torn cartilage. According to the doctor, he didn't see any major damage or injury, just possibly a sprained knee.  He said since I was able to walk around, and bend my legs, and no broken bones or clicking/locking at the knee...it's most likely a sprined knee.  If it gets worse in 10 days, I need to go back and have it examined again.   Rollin on Crutches  I did get crutches to avoid putting weight on it, and a knee brace for support.  I'll be on them for a few weeks.  Yes, it's no fun feeling injured.     Tahoe Weekend  My family is going to Tahoe this weekend.  Unfortunately I won't be able to snowboard due to my injury.  That would of been my first time this season, but now it'll have to wait until my knee heals up.  I was looking forward to it too!  Oh well, at least I'll save some money.   SJ Mercury 10K  Plus the SJ Mercury 10K is next weekend, but I might not be able to run it.  I've been training for it the passed 2 weeks, and it sucks that my knee is out of commission, due to softball.  Plus I paid the registration! I'm definitely going to have to show up, just to get my tshirt and some free food!  Maybe I'll run it with my crutches.

       It's a Beautiful Day!  The rain is gone, and the sun is out! That puts a smile on my face!   Pool  Last night, I shot some pool at  urlLink South First billiards  w/ my coworker after work.  They have a $10/table special, every Monday from 7-10pm.  I haven't played in a long time, so most of my shots were mostly off.  I did win a few games, by luck. =)   San Jose Mercury 10K  I've been doing a lot of running that past week, to condition for the SJ Mercury 10K, on March 21st.  I'm such a slow runner, but I don't mind.  I feel really good after I do run, and I'm sure my body and heart are thanking me.  I haven't been as active physically in a long time, so it's nice to pick up running again.  I have about 1.5 weeks left to condition.  Olivia is going to do the 5k, and I'm proud of her for running a lot, too!  We ran together Sunday, and she's pretty good!   San Diego - Camp Pendleton Mud Run  Plus we have the  urlLink Camp Pendleton Mud Run , San Diego in June.  A large group of us are going this year (25+), and I'm looking forward to it!  That weekend should be lot's of fun.  I think we're planning to go to Tijuana afterwards to party!   Westin Hotel  Last Saturday, we finally got the contract for our wedding reception from the  urlLink Westin .  I'm excited for the big day, and for the actual reception.  We have so much more planning to do, but it's nice to not worry about the hotel.  The place looked gorgeous, especially when it's sunny.  We're having a winter wedding in January, so hopefully the sun will come out and play on our big day!   Casino Night  Last Friday, Diana celebrated her birthday with a Casino night.  Lot's of fun.  I lost overall, but had a great time playing Texas Holdem, blackjack, and bingo. =)  Happy Birthday Diana!

       Weekend in Tahoe  My family celebrated my little sister’s 21st birthday, with a weekend in South Lake Tahoe.  We stayed at the Americana Village, on Pioneer Trail, just walking distance to the casinos.  It felt good to get away from everything, to see new scenery, play in the snow, spend quality time with the family, go swimming, do some gambling, feast at Harrah’s buffet, walk under the sun, take pictures, visit the Lake, and just relax, relax, relax!  It felt like a mini-vacation, and I can’t wait for our next getaway, which is New York for Olivia’s graduation in May!  Pictures from this past weekend coming soon!    Gambling  I did lose $125 in gambling.  To me, that’s a lot of money!  When you’re on a losing streak, it’s best to just stop gambling…otherwise your hole gets deeper and deeper. That’s my lesson learned, a costly lesson.  I lost $40 playing Pai Gow.  I lost another $40 at Blackjack.  I didn't feel the luck, but I played more Blackjack, and yes…lost another $40.  And of course, slots just eat up all your quarters.  Well, that’s gambling! Stop when you’re ahead, and stop when you’re on a losing streak!   Happy 21st Birthday Audrey!  My little sister did win a lot, and had a hot streak at the tables!  I think she won the most amongst us.  I think I'll try gambling on my next birthday!

       San Jose Mercury 10k  Sunday morning, a bunch of our friends joined the SJ Mercury 10k.  I signed up for the 10k, but ended up walking the 5k, due to my bum knee.  It was tough walking it, and probably not the best idea.  It took me 56 minutes to hobble 3.1 imles.  Afterwards, my knee started to throb w/ pain.    Seeing people of all ages running, made me want to run!  Seeing old people run as fast or even faster than the younger runners, motivated me to get into running... so that when I'm old, I'll still be able to run as well as the youngsters.  Afterwards, lot's of free food and drinks.  Some of us even walked away w/ lot's of goodies. Overall, fun day!    To bad the pictures I took didn't come out.  Only about 5 out of 30 shots came out.  I think my camera may be having some issues.   Another Casino Night  Friday night, we had more gambling fun at Casa Pickerel, for Joey's birthday.  We played more Texas Holdem, casino style, and this time I won about $9.  I love that game, but only when I win hands.  =) Happy Birthday Joey.   Bocce Ball  Ever play this game?  It's lots of fun. Our team at work had an offsite social in Los Gatos, and we played for hours.  It's a relatively simple game, but there's actually a lot of strategy involved.  I'm thinking about buying a bocce ball set.

       TGIF!!!!!!!!  Yes, it's Friday today!  Plus it's beautiful outside, with the sun shining bright!  I'm definitely looking forward to the weekend!  I'm stuck in the office right now, with so much work to do.   I need to finish up as much as I can, so I don't have to worry about catching up over the weekend!   Weekend Plans  No big plans this weekend.  So far, here is what I have planned:   Saturday  Wash my car - haven't washed it in months! Mark and Diana's baby shower - they're having a house party Possiby Great America - Olivia won WoW season passes on the radio Sleep - I need to catch up   Sunday  Church Laundry Clear out my junk!   Speaking of Junk...  I still have all my papers/books/homework/etc. from Elementary school, High school, and College.  I honestly don't think I need any of it these days, but it's hard for me to just throw these items away.  I'm thinking they're worth keeping, so that someday I can show my kids my old school work.  We'll see....I might just toss them out this weekend.

       New Cell Phone  After almost 5 years with Cingular Wireless, sportin' my Nokia 6190, I finally switched to AT&T Wireless and got a new phone!  Yes, I've told myself that I would never EVER replace my 6190, because this phone is bullet proof!  Nothing could break this cell phone.  I've dropped it a million and one times, I've tossed it up against the wall like a basketball, I've submerged it water...and it has survived until now, still going strong.   Gotta Save Money  Well, since Olivia and I are getting married, we're trying to find ways to save money!  So we got the family plan with AT&T, for $39.99 + 9.99 / month! That includes 600 shared minutes, unlimited nights/weekends, free mobile to mobile, nationwide!  Not a bad deal, considering we were paying $80+ for both our current plans. Since most of my minutes are used calling Olivia, having free mobile to mobile is great.   I love my New Nokia 3200  Yes, I thought my Nokia 6190 was the bomb.  But now I love my new  urlLink Nokia 3200!   It's such an awesome phone.  Maybe it's just because I'm a few generations behind in cell phones, but this phone is great, with many features!  My favorite feature is the built in FM Radio that automatically mutes during calls. Yes, I've been using my phone at work to listen to the radio!  It has a built in speaker phone, to allow you to talk hands free.  Not only that, you can use the speaker phone to listen to the radio out loud!    The built-in camera with picture editor, 10-second timer and night mode works great. The quality was surprisingly better than expected.  Customizable design-your-own, cut-out front/back covers.  Olivia and I signed up for the mMode package for a month, which included internet access, text messaging, email, picture sending.  The internet access is pretty cool.  I can read email, go on AIM, visit Yahoo, check news, sports, stock quotes, etc.  Plus, this cell phone has a built in Flashlight!  The best part about this phone, is that I can vote for my favorite American Idol. =)

       Busy, Busy, Busy!  I've been so busy at work this entire week, I can't wait for the weekend.  My new manager started on monday, and he's actually a pretty cool guy.  He has great experience and new ideas, it's refreshing to have someone with lot's of energy to lead our group.  This month I'm the team lead for our release, which is the main reason why I'm so busy.  I have about 3-4 meetings a day, which takes up most of my time.  As a result, I'm behind in my own work.  I may need to work this weekend just to catch up.  But I'm actually enjoying this rotating role, as it's a great learning experience.   Almost there!  Olivia and I are almost there!  We've been working on this big project since November, and so far we're on track.  Hopefully all goes well!  We should be done by May! =)   Retainers  I started wearing my retainers again. =)  They're not those regular metal type ones, but a mouth piece type of retainer.  They actually work! =)

       Go Olivia!  After work today, I went to Alameda to watch Olivia play softball.  All I can say is "WOW!"  Olivia played second base, and did an awesome job.  I cheered for her and her team, as I sat on the bleechers to watch.  She made some amazing plays at second base, and I was truly impressed with her defensive skills.  She almost threw out several players at first, but the runners beat her out.   That's okay Olivia, we'll work on getting more speed in your throws.  Olivia's had an RBI, a walk, and a run.  WOW!  Congrats congrats!   I want to play!  Ever since I injured my knee in our first softball game a month or so ago, I've been dying to play!  I haven't been able to go running, play basketball, play softball, or anything active.  My knee feels like it's getting better, but I'm afraid if I start running and putting too much pressure on the knee, it will get worse.  So I've letting my knee heal, doing stretches and stairs to keep it flexible and gain strength.     30 more days to go!  It's an exciting month this month, and the countdown has begun.  Oh boy, I can't wait!  Oh, I'll also be on vacation for a week and a half next month.  We're going to New York for Olivia's graduation ceremony.  She graduated last year, but missed the grad ceremony.  Olivia's family and I are flying there for a week to see her in her cap and gown, to get her masters diploma.  I'm so looking forward to that trip, since work has been busy and hectic.  It should be fun.   Go Giants  I love the Giants.  Congrats to Barry Bonds for Homerun 660!    Wedding Plans  Our wedding plans have been in the slow lane the past few weeks.  I gues we've taken a break from planning, and working on other projects.  We do have our major items taken care of, but we still have a lot more planning to do!  Right now, we're just enjoying being engaged! =)   Strange  Olivia received a gift from someone in the mail the other day.  The person who sent it didn't say who they were.  It's a nice gift, but kinda strange not knowing who it's from.     Soda  Now that Lent is over, I started drinking soda again!  It tastes so good.  =)  I love Dr. Pepper...so much sugar!

       Kitty Litter  Kitty, our pet cat, gave birth to 3 little kittens last week.  One white kitten, one black kitten, and one black and white.  I actually witnessed one of the births, which I found fascinating....the miracle of birth!  Seeing it pop out, and hearing the little meows and crying for the first time...was definitely miraculous.  Watching the new born kittens, all helpless, blind, and deaf, and seeing Kitty become a mother for the first time, definitely was a site to see.  I wish I video taped the whole thing. =)  So now, we have 4 cats living in our garage, and my family doesn't know what to do with them.  We'll, we're going to keep them until the babies are able to walk and eat on their own.  Then we'll either donate them, call the animal shelter, or make arroz caldo. =)   Bye Bye Apple  On the sad side, Apple, my pet turtle, passed away today.  Yes, sad day today.  I found her upside down in the water tank where she lives with Big.  Big, my other turtle, is now all alone.  Tear.  I got them over a year ago, in New York.  The past few weeks, both turtles haven't been eating the turtle food I give.  I think they've been unhappy, as they seldom run around and play.  I guess living in a confined space, can seem hopeless and pointless for a turtle, as they should be living free in the ocean or beach.  I'm thinking of setting Big free, so he can enjoy the rest of his life!  Reminds me of Finding Nemo.  Apple, we will miss you!   Saffron  Last night Olivia and I went on a triple date with Mark, Diana, Nick and Diep.  We had dinner at San Carlos, at an Indian restaurant called Saffon.  Great place, delicious dishes, great atmosphere, very different from your typical Indian restaurants.  Mark actually worked with the owner/chef before, so the chef hooked us up with some free dishes, and a 10% discount.  Unfortunately, when Olivia got home, she threw up...possibly due to food poisoning.  But I do recommend this place if you love Indian food.   Busy at Work  I am swamped at work.  Release after Release, conference calls upon conference calls, meetings within meetings, it's been a hectic month, and will continue being hectic for the entire year.   I'm looking forward to my vacation in New York!

       Good News!!!!!!  Last Thursday at work, I received a call from my sister Abby.  "Guess what, you're going to be an uncle!"  At first I thought that Char, who is pregnant, had her baby.  I quickly realized that she has only been pregnant for a few months...so that couldn't be.  A few seconds later I realized that my sister and Mike were going to have a baby!!  I felt really happy to hear such good news!  It's exciting when one of your siblings are going to have kids, it makes you realize how time flies so fast.  One day you're 3 years old playing in the park and fighting with your sister.  Next thing you know, your older sister is having a baby, and you're going to be an uncle.  My parents are extremely happy about Abby having a baby.  Both my parents have been waiting a long time to be grandparents, especially my dad.  He wants to retire so he can take care of his grandchildren. =)  It's nice to know that they're looking forward to that.  Congratulation Mike and Abby!  You're both going to be great parents!  I hope it's a boy! =)

       Columbia University Graduation  Today we witnessed Olivia receive her M.A. degree from  urlLink Columbia University , from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. We were fortunate enough to all get into St. Paul's Chapel, where the ceremony occurred, to watch Olivia walk down the aisle.  The school only gave 2 tickets per student, but after everyone w/ tickets sat down, a few seats were left!  Seeing Olivia in her cap and gown, made me proud!  She looked great in her Columbia blue graduation outfit, you'll have to see pictures of what I mean. =) Cute! Congratulations again Olivia!      Monsoon's  After the ceremony and taking pictures during the reception, we had lunch at a Vietnamese Restaurant called  urlLink Monsoon's .  It's one of Olivia's favorite Vietnamese restaurants in the city.  The food was good!   Who Wants To Be A Super Millionaire  Today we also went to the ABC studios, to watch a filming of  urlLink "Who Wants to be a Super Millionaire" .  Despite waiting for almost 1.5 hrs, watching the contestants play, seeing how they produced the show, witnessing the re-takes, laughing at the jokes, and seeing Regis, the show was very entertaining!  They even gave the entire audience a cool t-shirt!  The taping will be aired this Wednesday night, so tell me if you see us in the audience!   Acqua Restaurant  For dinner, Olivia and I went on a dinner date by ourselves.  We ate at  urlLink Acqua Restaurant , an Italian restaurant located in the upper west side. Great place for pasta!  The weather was kind, so we ate outside along the side walk.  That's always a lot of fun.  Olivia and I finally got a chance to just sit and spend time together, since our trip schedule has been jammed-packed with non-stop new York paced moving.  We had a great conversation! We talked about religion, our future, our dreams, our concerns, our parents, our family, our plans, and our lives. So much to figure out and talk about!!!    Troy  Monday night, we watched  urlLink Troy , starring Brad Pitt, Orlando Bloom, Diane Kruger, and Eric Bana.  Great epic movie!!!!  Orlando Bloom's role as Paris was funny...watching him act as a coward, and then seeing him bust out with bows and arrows.  He reminded me of Legolas.  Brad Pitt did a good job.   H&M  We all went shopping at  urlLink H&M !  I love this store.  I bought a bunch of new shirts for work, for affordable prices.  If there's any place to go shopping in New York, for affordable clothing, it's H&M. =)

       New York!!!!  Today is Sunday, and guess where I'm?  Ok, I guess my heading gave it away.  I'm in New York!  I love this city, and it's great to be here.  Such a fast paced environment, lot's to do, different sights to see, sounds to hear, interesting smells to smell, different from your typical day in the Bay.  There's definitely no place like NY. I love the subways.  We arrived Saturday morning and checked into the apartment Olivia booked.  Nice cosy place in Manhatan, enough to fit 7 of us comfortably.   Gray's Papaya  Let's see, what did we do so far?  We first had lunch at  urlLink Gray's Papaya , a popular hotdog spot, known for their 75 cent hotdogs and papaya drinks.  They're actually remodeling the place, and according to their sign, the rent of the building went up.  So the hotdog prices went up to 95 cents. Boo! Still a great deal.   Boy from Oz  After our Chinese take-out dinner, we watched the musical  urlLink "The Boy from Oz",  starring Hugh Jackman.  Olivia bought tickets a long time ago, when she was still living in New York.  Overall, it was a great show.  Hugh Jackman played his character well!   Party  After the show, we went to a graduation party where we saw a bunch of UCB alum. We had a few drinks and danced a bit.  It was at one of Donald Trump's apartment buildings, very nice.   Saint Patrick's  Sunday, we went to Church at  urlLink Saint Patrick's Cathedral .  An usher asked to do the collection, which I actually enjoyed! I held the basket and walked down the rows of pews, collecting donations.  =)      International Food Fair  After church, we went to the  urlLink Ninth Avenue International Food Festival , which is held each May.  Thousands of people and hundreds of vendors selling food from all over the world, souvenirs, clothing, drinks, music, and lot's of fun.   We tried a variety of foods which were delicious.  I bought 4 sets of bedsheets for $10 a set. =)     Garment District  Olivia wanted to shop for bridemaid's dresses, so she took us to the Garmnent District.  Plenty of shops with hundreds of dresses, for low prices.  She had trouble finding dresses in the color of our wedding theme, so we have to go back again to dig deeper for dresses.     Malaysia Grill  We had dinner tonight at  urlLink Malaysia Grill .  Great place for malaysian food. =)  So far, I'm having a great time in New York.  The day's are flying by quick!  Upcoming plans include The View, Regis and Kelly, more musicals, Serendity, clubbing, and lot's of shopping!

       Welcome Back!  Yes, I'm back again, and so is my website.  After paying for 1 year of hosting, and free loading for an additional 2 years of web hosting, my host finally caught on and deactivated my account. =) So I got a new host from a friend, www.icestorm.com.  Check them out if you need webhosting!  Anyways, I decided to toss away my entire site and start fresh.      2 Months in Review  Lot's has happened since the last time I blogged...so much, I don't know where to begin.  Well, to keep it short, here are the biggest highlights in the past 2 months: - Olivia and I moved into our new home! We finally closed escrow, and started to move in over a month ago.  We've pretty much been been painting like there's no tomorrow.  Moving is a lot of work, and boy oh boy, it takes a lot of work and energy.  But it's definitely exciting, and we're having so much fun!    - I ran the 10K Mud Run in Camp Pendleton, in San Diego!  Yes, it's now our annual event.  A bunch of our friends went down for the weekend, to run a 10K obstacle course full of mud, hills, water, rivers, tires, sand, etc.  LOT'S OF FUN!!!!      - Went to Char and Abe's Wedding, in Vallejo.  The reception was at Hs Lordships in Berkeley Marina.  Beautiful couple, beautiful wedding!    - I almost lost 2 important people in my life: my little sister Audrey and Ben(practically my litlte brother) to a car accident, on Memorial Day weekend.  I'm so thankful that they are both alive today.  That event gave myself and my family a big scare and an emotional rollercoaster ride. But we're so glad God was kind that day.  It really put life into perspective for me, to realize how life is so precious, that in a sudden instant, it could be changed forever. Family is what matters for me, and I'm so thankful to God for sparing both their lives that day. Ben is still in the hospital, but is recovering everyday!  - Work, work, work!  Just been busy at work, learning lot's of new things.  I have actually learned more in the past two months with my new manager, than in the past 2+ years I've been at Covad.    and that's pretty much it for now.

      I'm tired, and I can't wait for the weekend.  Work has been tough and very demanding, but has been a great learning experience.    Guess what...I have to work this weekend. Boo.  This past 3 day weekend was awesome, and I wonder when the next one is.  Last weekend, went to a BBQ in Danville, where Johanna threw a little party.  We went swimming in her neighborhood pool.      Then on Sunday, Olivia and I worked on our new place.  We did more painting, bought some blinds for the windows, installed them.  So now we no longer have our yellow bedsheets as curtains. =)  We also purchased a ceiling fan which we installed. I was able to convince Olivia to pick something I really liked, a model called "The West Indies".  It's starting to grow on her, and I'm glad she agreed to it.  Monday, my family came over for a bbq.  Ben's family came over as well, and so did Ben.  It was nice to see him up and about, walking and talking like before.  One month ago, he was in the hospital, barely awake.  Now, he's recovering well. =)  We played some Texas Hold 'em, some Upwords, and Cranium.    Tomorrow is Friday, and I can't wait for the weekend!

       Blog Slacker  Ok, enough people have told me I'm slacking w/ this blog of mine...I've finally come around to post a new entry.  Let's work backwards!   George and Nina's Wedding  Our friends from Santa Clara, George and Nina tied the knot yesterday at the Santa Clara Mission. Beautiful day, beautiful wedding, beautiful couple.     They had their reception at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Burlingame. Nice place! Despite our waiter forgetting to serve our table by the time other guest started the main course, the dinner was excellent. We started off w/ a pumkin clam chowder, followed by a shrimp appetizer, salad, sourbet, filet mignon, coffee, and wedding cake!    The one thing I thought was awesome was their wedding slide show. They had a cartoon animation of themselves w/ voice overs, talking about their history and background. Creative Stuff!!! They had both pictures and video in their slideshow, which I really enjoyed.    Olivia will be posting the pics we took on ofoto.   Adios Amigos Night  Jane and Oscar threw a party at Jane's place, for Rick and Eileen who are moving out of town.  A going away party, before they leave for Chicago and San Diego.  We met up at Jane's and Oscar played bartender for the night.  We also had dinner at Rick's favorite Taco Truck in Oakland.     GYGO5  Last weekend, Olivia and I threw our annual barbecue / picnic games event, "Get Your Grub On", for the 5th straight year.     We typically invite all our friends and family, to come out to some park, play some games for cool prizes, eat, and have fun under the sun. This year we held it in the park in our new neighborhood, so it was nice and convenient for us. =) We actually had the entire park to ourselves!    Great turnout this year, friends from high school, college, work, and family attended. It's always nice to see the different groups of people we know, all at one place. And it's nice seeing people smile and having fun.    We had some classic games this year, w/ a few new ones. The games included: 1) Scavenger Hunt 2) Water Balloon Toss   3) Hockey / Golf Relay Race   4) Water Sponge Relay   5) Water Balloon Volleyball    The Winners this year, were the Red Period team, and won themselves a cool car wash kit!  They have won 3 out of the 5 GYGOs.  Congrats Congrats!    Thanks again to everyone for coming out, and see you all again next year, GYG06!   Aids Walk  Olivia and I also did the San Francisco Aids walk two weeks ago.  We walked with Eric, Marjorie, Jane, and Oscar.  Lot's of fun.  Afterwards, we ate at Sinugba's in Daly City, and hopped into Olivia's spa for some relaxation!     Work, Work, Work...  ...that's all Olivia says I do, WORK!  Yes, I've been getting hammered at work. So far, our past 3 software releases have bombed! Reason being, we have very aggressive software release schedules with unrealistic dates. So many initiative and projects, which leads to poor planning and poor software quality. That definitely doesn't look good for our Software Engineering department. As a result, there's a lot of changes going on, such as new processes, delays in our future release, and more work to do!!  The only thing keeping me going is the team I'm on. We as a group have really united, compared to the past, and we're learning so much from each other. Learning as much as I can is all I look forward to these days at work. =)   House Stuff  Olivia and I have been enjoying our new home. There's still quite a lot to do, and buy...but we're doing things one step at a time. So far we've been able to paint our entire first floor (minus the bedrooms). We've purchase and installed our new kitchen table set, which we love a lot.     We also bought our new refrigerator, so now I can return my little sister's college dorm room fridge. And we've installed our new ceiling fan. =) Oh, can't forget that we've installed some window blinds. For the longest time, we've had yellow bedsheets as window coverings.   And yes, we finally got DSL!!!!  What else to be done you ask?  LOTS! That includes: - painting the garage - painting the bedrooms - complete all the window blinds - buy a couch - pick out a dining room set (which Abby+ Mike are going to get us as a wedding/house warming gift) - sign up for cable - decorate, decorate, and decorate!
