      i almost forgot...there is one title that i am interested in reading:  urlLink Loving Homosexuals as Jesus Would .  i have ordered a galley copy of this work, so that I can read it next week and interview the author the week following.  once the interview is complete, i'll post it.  have there been any christian treatments of the homosexuality issue that you have found helpful?  if so, let me know.

      for the past two days i have been reading manuscripts regarding homosexual marriage.  at christianbook.com we have decided to run develop a little feature on this issue, because where there is controversy, there is 'kwan.'  two of the titles are of the 'chicken little' variety (i.e., they run round and round in circles crying, the family is falling, the church is dying, the nation is decaying!) and they are driving me up a wall.    admittedly, i think that homosexual marriage will have some dire consequences, especially upon children who are raised without the positive influence of either a mother or a father, but i do not think that it is the lynch pin of western society (i.e., "pull the pin and bickety bam the whole stage falls down!").  moreover, i find the steadfast warnings of the james dobsons of the world, who are trying to goad us into action by asking "when will evangelicalism finally take a stand?" and are imploring us to make this our primary focus during these dark days, quite hollow.  if these men are so passionate about defending the 'sanctity of marriage' why do they consistently fail to address the issue of spousal abuse, which is wrecking far greater havoc on our institution of marriage.  how often have you heard pastors condemn spousal abuse from the pulpit?  my guess is that it hasn't been very often.  likewise, when are we going to "take a stand" or "go to war" against child abuse?  surely this is another seige ramp which has been raised against the citadel of marriage, but we rarely hear a peep about it in the church, either from the pulpit or in our literature (believe me, i've checked!).    i know that i am in danger of preaching one too many sermons on this topic, but i passionately believe that we must address these rampant issues, which are well rooted in the church and abundantly nourished by our shame and silence, before we can expect for the culture of this world to truly hear our critique.  in essence, i think that we need to set our own house straight before we set out to subvert the pattern of this world.  okay, enough.  i promise that is my last such post for a bit.  by the way, if you ever want to check out my work at christianbook.com take a look at the  urlLink Pastor's Resource Center  or the  urlLink Christian Living Page .  Remember, "for every coin in the coffer that clinks..."

      5.17.04  Today is the 50th anniversary of Brown vs. Board of Education.  A truly momentous event in American History, the Brown decision condemned the legal separation of black and white schoolchildren and so helped pave the way for a fully integrated society.     Today is also the first day that gays and lesbians will be allowed to marry in the United States.  Since our beloved commonwealth is ground zero for those official unions, several thousand citizens have applied for marriage licenses and a number of gay and lesbian weddings are being conducted as we speak.  Both advocates and antagonists of gay marriage realize that now, for better or for worse, our country will never look the same.  What was once theoretical has indeed become real.   The convergence of these two events on May 17th was designated by the Supreme Court Justices of our Commonwealth as a means of communicating to the homosexual community that what is true about our schools is now true about the institution of marriage, insofar as their unions will not be identified as separate, but equal to heterosexual marriage.  For this reason, the date is incredibly significant for that community.     However, I believe that this date can be incredibly significant for the Christian community as well, insofar as it reminds us that while our government has established laws that resonate with biblical principles, consider the close connection between Brown and the Apostle Paul's declaration that in Christ "the barrier of hostility has been broken down," it has also established laws, as is the case here in the Commonwealth, that do not resonate with biblical teaching.  As believers this should, at the very least, teach us that we should not be too euphoric when the government acts in step with biblical principle, nor should we completely despair when they repudiate such principle, for the truth is not determined and our hope does not reside in the legislation or judicial decision of our government, but in the Lord and the Kingdom over which He sovereignly rules.  During this confusing and occasionally dark time, let us not make the mistake of equating God's Kingdom with the republic in which we dwell, nor confound the "City of Man" with the "City of God."  Homosexual marriage is neither condemnation nor commentary upon the church, but is the free (and, from my perspective, rather poor) choice of the state.  Therefore, we should not take up defensive positions, for the action of the state is not attacking the church nor is it intended to destroy "Christian marriage."  Rather, instead of weeping about the wound to our so-called "godly American heritage" we should work all the harder to develop Kingdom centered marriages that are marked by sacrificial love, mutual submission and, at their best moments, serve as a parable of Christ's love for the church.  It is only then, by faithfully living out the gift of marriage within the Kingdom of God, that we might begin to influence our culture's evident misunderstanding of marriage.  Instead of shaking our holy swords and screaming holy words at those outside the Kingdom, let our loving marriages serve as an ever-present illustration of what marriage can be.  I offer these reflections humbly and hope that they are received as such.  If you would like to offer an alternative reflection or would like to engage in further dialogue about this issue, please do not hesitate to contact me.   May God bless His Kingdom and enable Christ's church to subtly, but surely influence this country as leaven does a lump of dough.

      greetings friends and loyal readers.  i am sorry for the neglect.  on wednesday evening i decided to take advantage of a ridiculously low jetblue fare and jet down to tampa/st. pete for the weekend.  so i left the infinite march of massachusetts behind for the beauty of the tropics.  good times...  after a few short days of respite, i don't have anything really significant to say, but thought i could at least throw you the following frickin' bone.  life lessons from tampa st. pete  1.  occasionally, two year olds can tell a great joke.  they then proceed to run it into the ground.    gillian bennett, the eldest daughter of rick and kristi bennett--my gracious hosts, has been running around the house saying 'i'm john kerry and i approve this message.'  that was hilarious the first three times i heard it, and has been diminishing in humor ever since.  2.  note to self regarding future offspring.  when the two year old's attempt to say 'car' comes out 'ca ca,' don't encourage her to connect the unwitting curse to the word 'head.'  she's been repeating that phrase, which is the only i've truly 'coined' to date, quite regulary as well.  3.  potty training is hell.  4.  everyone shares one love language: listening.  through prayer and motivational self-talk i tried to remind myself that the best way i could love rick and kristi was to listen to them.  of course, i've been offering advice on a wide variety of subjects (not related to child rearing or potty training) for the past 36 hours.  Lord, fill me with your Spirit so that I might listen to people, and so love them well.

      to the chagrin of rhetoricians and the barely stifled glee of late night comedians, President Bush has announced plans to make one speech a week until the U.S. Provisional Authority officially "hands over" sovereignty to the Iraqi people on June 30th.  fortunately, the major networks have decided not to televise these offenses to intelligent communication.  apparently Americans want their CSI: Hong Kong more than they want this President.  what's your favorite "bush-ism?"  mission accomplished?  axis of evil?    mine is the following:  "its like they say back in Texas, and probably in Tennessee, 'fool me once, shame on...me?  fool me twice...you can't fool me again!"

      kellie and i have watched jim sheridan's  urlLink In America  two times in the past week.  if you are interested in experiencing an incredible re-creation of the gospel story, you need to check it out.  sheridan stands in a centuries long line of irish storytellers who are able to explore the manner in which the original story of redemption is woven into the joys and struggles, strife and reconciliation of our own lives.    Lord God, we long to have eyes to see, ears to hear, hands to touch, tongues to taste and words to express your gospel in earthy, engaging ways.  Thank you for this offering of Jim Sheridan.  Enable us to tell your story in a similar way.

      lately i have been thinking a lot about tension.  it seems to me that tension is one of the most prominent characteristics of the Christian life (i.e., in the world, but not of the world) and of our Savior himself (fully God, yet fully man; his uncanny ability to afflict the comfortable, yet comfort the afflicted).  anyway, since this tension motif has been on my mind as of late, i found the following passage from a church planting paper written by Timothy Keller of Redeemer Pres in NYC quite interesting:  "...a gospel centered church should have a social justice emphasis and effectiveness that greatly exceeds the liberal church's.  Meanwhile, it should have an evangelistic fervor that greatly exceeds the ordinary fundamentalist church's.  a gospel-centered church should combine 'zeals' that are ordinarily never seen together in the same church.  this is one of the main ways we make people look twice and take our message seriously."  simple yet profound, eh?  now, if i could just learn how to lead a community that incarnates both of these zeals, i'd be getting somewhere.  by the way, my wife just told me to remind you, loyal reader, that i am quite married and unavailable.  indeed, the 'pimp driven life' is now far behind me.

      in lieu of an engaging sunday morning service, i bring you an exclusive report on my sunday afternoon melancholy.  over the past year and a half i have been leading sinners and saints christian community and have been a part of the leadership team for city on a hill christian community.  city on a hill is a small collective of christian communities (currently including 3 home churches--including s & S, one congregational church and a few affiliated christian workers) that is trying to effectively incarnate the gospel of Christ in the greater boston area.  although we don't have a comprehensive vision statement, or the fancy powerpoint presentation that usually accompanies such vision, we are marked by a passion for: proclaiming the gospel in a relational manner, extending Christ's compassion to the weak in our communities (often through organizations like  urlLink Beverly Bootstraps  and doing life together in sacrificial community.    if my explanation of city on a hill seems underdeveloped, that is because our community has little understanding of our identity.  for all of our idealism and passion for relational expressions of the church, our network is a mess.  our founding pastor recently left in order to tend to the needs of his elderly parents, one of our homechurches has little desire to affiliate with the other two and our leadership currently consists of bi-vocational leaders who often find it difficult to lead a homechurch on a weekly basis, much less cast a vision and provide oversight for an entire network.  thus, although i can readily identify signs of life in our little community, including a couple of new members in the past two months and the return of several leaders who have been on hiatus, most days i feel much more jaded than optimistic about our future.  today, has been one of those latter days.  this morning, while half-heartedly participating in sunday morning chores, i tried to pray for our fragile little community.  i prayed for my afternoon meeting with one of our newest members, i asked God to give me the passion and ability to lead and, mostly, asked God what the hell i am doing in this situation.  my earliest ministry experiences were with rapidly developing willowish mega-churches.  in those contexts i witnessed dozens of conversions, lived for the excitement of 'pulling off' engaging services and, at my first church, lived for the increasing challenges of growing responsibility.  in my current context, i feel like i am failing to provide adequate leadership or helpful vision to a community full of individuals who seem more interested in fulfilling their narcissistic spiritual needs than sacrificially serving the poor or intentionally incarnating the gospel to this hope-less world.  i worry that my full-time job is severely limiting my ability to serve and i wonder if i am wasting my gifts on a lark of a ministry.  perhaps these feelings are legitimate or perhaps i am merely afraid of the risks that relational ministry require.  but...that's where i'm at right now.  by the way, when i provide such musings i am not begging for affirmation or sympathy, i'm merely sharing the load that is laying upon my chest.  thanks for listening.

      random thoughts...  i think that when his term is over, president bush should forego the traditional 'presidential library' in order to build the "george W. bush center for kids that don't speak good."  i am very thankful for my homechurch, sinners and saints, as well as city on a hill, the ministry collective to which we belong.  why is it, then, that i often wonder what it would be like to be the pastor of a traditional congregation?  is this desire merely a reflection of my training and a general unwillingness to do the hard work of innovative ministry, or does it run deeper?    although they've taken five out of their last six, i refuse to get too excited about the cardinals.  a run differential of 31 just ain't going to cut it.  the upside of this is that the reds, who have a minuscule run differential of 2, are about to go up in flames.   don miller's new book, which is tentatively titled  urlLink Searching for God Knows What: Reflections on the Gospel of Jesus  , and releases on October 14 is fantastic.  i would like to thank the good folks at Thomas Nelson for allowing an underling such as myself to read the pre-publication copy.

      within the first thirty minutes of my visit with the Bennett family, i noticed two intriguing books among the many on their shelves.  the first was my long lost copy of graham greene's  urlLink The Power and the Glory .  Greene has the remarkable ability to explain the tension between sin and sanctity that dwells within us all.  Indeed, if his cowardly, corrupt 'whisky priest' can be a sacrament to his people, we too can be a sacrament to our communities.  now that i think about it, the 'whisky priest' reminds me a lot of  urlLink Godric , one of buechner's most inspiring protagonists.  since buechner has lauded "the power and the glory" on a number of occasions, i doubt this resemblance is circumstantial.  the second book i noticed was don miller's  urlLink Prayer and the Art of Volkswagen Maintenance .  i was floored by miller's second work,  urlLink Blue Like Jazz , so i have been looking to purchase this title for some time.  unfortunately, it is currently out-of-print and no one wants to let go of their copy for less than $45.  so, i was delighted by the opportunity to steal my friend's copy (which i subsequently did:).  anyway, to make a short story long, while consuming miller's work, i was intrigued by the following passage in which he describes the character of Paul, his friend and traveling companion:  "Paul is better than me in this way.  He can appreciate the person inside the persona.  To Him, people are more important than ideas.  He does not laugh at jokes that deprecate others.  He is a true, empathetic, kind of character."  Paul is better than me in this way as well.  i have no tolerance for many people's personas.  i am quick to bash on punks who lack the ethos, goths who externalize that which should be internal and christians who speak in cliche.  if i think someone's persona is something less than genuine, i will probably inform them of the apparent distance between their appearance and reality and will probably reject them.  of course, for a christian who believes that each individual was fashioned in as well as reflects the image of God, this is indeed vile.  so this is a sin i must confess...i have rejected many people's personas and so have denied their value as a person.  for this i am truly sorry.  i doubt many of those i have rejected are or would listen to anything i have to say, but if you are listening, jaimie, logan, steve, eric, paul, todd, brandon and kelley, i beg your forgiveness.  may God grant me the grace to set aside personas, so that i can walk with all sorts of people as we seek to become new persons in Christ Jesus.

       reflections on my 2nd religion   1.  well, well, well...look who's in first place.  that's right, it's the St. Louis Cardinals!  they took the tough road to get there as well, taking 2 out of 3 from the 'stros and the despised small bears.  my gut still tells me that they will finish in 3rd place, but my heart wants to believe that this is 'the year.'  as stated before, i'll only surrender to my heart when they reach the 10 games over plateau.  by the way, as of today, i will no longer refer to them as 'my bastards' (at least until they drop below .500).    2.  i am neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet, but i did predict the reds rapid fall.  their fall wasn't just in the cards, it was written all over their run differential (horrible pun intended).  3.  the angels are a better ballclub without troy percival.  now they can let k-rod flaunt his filthy stuff almost every night.  4.  i can't believe brownie stayed healthy until mid-june.  it's about time he made his semi-annual visit to the DL.  5.  the cards are still one starter short of making the leap.  a healthy kris benson would do the trick and freddy garcia might make a hell of a 4th man.  they should also give due consideration to reclamation projects such as BK Kim (especially if the Sox are willing to eat the majority of his contract).  6.  we haven't heard much about rose's reinstatement lately.  hopefully the commish has put the cooler on that one for good.

      a brief expression of optimism...  from my perspective, one of the most difficult things about leading a homechurch is the lack of quantifiable results.  when I interned at a budding mega-church, I could tell you at any given point how many kids had confessed faith in Christ and had been baptized, how youth group attendance had increased in the last quarter and the number of training sessions we had offered our volunteer staff.    now that we are a year and a half into the life of our homechurch i can only report that we have had a thousand conversations concerning the nature of church for the single conversion we have celebrated, after peaking around March 2003 our attendance has actually decreased and we've had a number of (often mind numbing) 'leadership meetings' up to this point, but nothing that i could honestly term 'leadership training.'  i try to be rationalize these results to myself in various ways, but, in all honesty, the lack of quantifiable results grates on me.  i was often told that good leaders are productive and efficient, so when i admit to myself that i am neither, it tends to chip away at my pastoral identity.    anyway,  the purpose of this post was not to publicly expose self-doubt, but to share some of the little, almost immeasurable, blessings that have befallen our community.  so, without further analysis or adieu:     Artie, our newest attender, read scripture during church last week.  This probably doesn't seem like a big deal, but for someone who admits that 'he can barely read a lick' and is on the margins of the faith, this is a big step.  so, when he read two verses of Hebrews 4, i felt a lump in my throat.  Alex, who just recently went from being our church's bartender to a member of our community, is one of the most vibrant, engaging young believers that i have ever met.  you know something special is going on when people are regularly asking him if they can join him for worship.  our church makeup is now comprised of 30% native New Englanders.  this is a huge step for a community that dwells in the shadows of Gordon College and Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary.  if our community is going to flourish, it must establish deep roots in the native soil.  almost every member of our community is meeting with a other members of the community on a weekly basis for relationship building (or you could call it non-programmic discipleship) and prayer.  this fall, our community will celebrate the return of Craig and Bonnie Lewiston and Aaron and Amy Graham to our fold.  these couples are leaders who the Father has, and will continue to use, in the good work of the Kingdom.    thank you, God, for the little ways that you are blessing Sinners and Saints.  give us eyes to see and ears to hear your movement among us.  i could share more, but i need to get back to serving the christian consumer.

      i have been officially listed as one of the walking wounded.  yesterday, after we helped the DeFranzas 'demo' their bedroom down to the studs, i felt great.  there is nothing like the adrenaline rush and the sense of accomplishment that comes from a job well done.  however, later last night, after we finished watching the new Harry Potter (which was about a thousand times better than the first one, by the way...Christopher Columus is a good fit for Home Alone 4, but not for the Potter franchise), I could barely walk.  of course, i had to get up at six this morning to finish prepping a sermon i was to give in the city.  not good times...  concerning my sermon, a sense of accomplishment is completely lacking.  i had planned to preach on I Pet. 1:1-2, but had to 'punt' the text for the second month in a row (I preach at Hill Memorial Baptist on the 1st Sunday of every month).  last month i merely extended a talk i had given the night before on the ends of solitude, but this month i had to pull one from the 'ole file.  to my dismay, there wasn't a single sermon in my file, except for one that dated back to 1997 and was produced for basic homiletics at LCC, that they hadn't heard.  so i did what was formerly unthinkable, i preached a sermon they had heard before.  since the text was a parable, Lk. 18:9-14, i was able to reshape the narrative a bit, but the final blow was exactly the same.  needless to say, i felt like a shit for receiving $100 for that effort.  this month i'm give myself two weeks prep time instead of just one (or so i tell myself).  clearly, my pride has also been deeply wounded.  setting self-pity aside, i am really enjoying douglas coupland's  urlLink Hey Nostradamus .  if, you are intrigued by 'non-religious thoughts on christian spirituality,' this is a work for you.  Coupland's  Life After God , his narrative survey of post-christian america, and  Girlfriend in a Coma , his take on all things apocalyptic, are excellent as well.

       the fire has abated, but the embers are still burning...   as i read my own words, which were liberally salted with anger and (what i hope is) righteous indignation, i couldn't help but hear the gentle command of christina, one of my afterschool kids: "jeff, stop being so serious."    christina, i am trying to obey!  this afternoon, instead of reading the heady N.T. Wright tome that is weighing down my satchel, i picked up mike yaconelli's  urlLink Dangerous Wonder  instead.  though i have never read him before, i have found his words refreshing and energizing.  i was particularly struck by the following paragraphs:  "Jesus was a dangerous man--dangerous to the power structure, dangerous to the church, dangerous to the crowds of people who followed Him.  Shouldn't the  followers  of Christ also be dangerous?  Shouldn't everyone be awed and dazzled by Christians?  Shouldn't Christians be known by the fire in their souls, the wild-eyed gratitude in their faces, the twinkle in their eyes, and a holy mischief in their demeanors?  Shouldn't Christianity be considered dangerous--unpredictable, threatening to the status quo, living outside the lines, uncontrollable, fearless, wild, beyond categorization or definition?  Shouldn't those who call themselves Christians be filled with awe, astonishment and amazement."  i thought the whole passage was insightful, but i was particularly intrigued by the phrase 'holy mischief.'  how can i start using the subversive, buck the system, iconoclastic part of my personality to replace the dullness and ugliness of this world with the engaging wonder and inexplicable, vibrant beauty of God's presence, God's rule, God's love.  I can hear Yaconelli's voice in my head paraphrasing the Apostle Peter: "What good is it if your teachers and bosses put you in the corner for merely making cynical remarks or ridiculous jokes about the death of the world?  But, if you are put in the corner for replacing the death of the world with words that bring forth life, or for encouraging people to put aside their dull, boring sin for unexpected relationships and quirky attempts to serve, it is commendable before God."    st. francis, rich, merton, the defranzas, these great saints have holy mischief in their eyes.  i hope that, by God's grace, there is a bit in mine as well.

       today's scheduled discussion on discipleship has been pre-empted by the following rant...   with all due respect to the southern baptists whom i am honored to serve with and deeply love, i am finding it harder and harder to stomach the reactionary conservatism of the national convention.  yesterday we heard that the convention voted down a proposal that would have encouraged southern baptist churchgoers to remove their children from public schools.  today, they announced that they are withdrawing from the largely evangelical baptist world alliance (bwa) because the bwa has "taken anti-american stances, has become tolerant of liberal theology and wrongly accepted the cooperative baptist fellowship" a group that has had the gall to critique the supposedly inerrant faith and practice of the sbc.    to be honest, i found yesterday's news appalling.  i couldn't believe that such a recommendation would even move out of committee, much less make it to the convention floor.  christ did not call us to come out of the world, or the public schools for that matter, but to faithfully incarnate his gospel within the world.  it is our passionate commitment to christ and his subversive gospel, not our disdain and condemnation of the structures and the individuals of this world,  that will make us strangers and aliens in this place.   brothers and sisters, let's focus on incarnating the gospel and extending the overwhelming compassion of Christ in our public schools, the hallways of corporate america, the projects of the inner-cities and anywhere that might be referred to as 'the public square.'  my prayer is that our legacy will be one of incarnation and compassion, not the creation and conservation of evangelical culture.   today's news that the sbc is pulling out of the bwa just added insult to injury.  i would not argue that schism is necessarily sinful, after all st. francis' gentle distinction of his mendicant order from the rank and file clergy of the late medieval period, luther's separation from rome and bonhoeffer and the confessing church's distinction from the national church of germany all seemed necessary and appropriate.  however, schism, much like war, has grave consequences and, as such should be considered a 'last resort' and, if necessary, should be performed with a heavy heart.  based on these assumptions, I think that the sbc's decisions are arrogant and unwise.    the first reason they cited for separation, that the bwa has "taken anti-american stances,"  was undoubtedly the most ridiculous.  unbiblical doctrine and gross conduct that is unbecoming the gospel are reasons to separate.  questionable patriotism is not.  it seems like the sbc's unflinching denominational support (they were the only major denomination to  officially  support it) of the unjust (anyone who wants to challenge this contention better be ready to explain how this war squares with Augustine's conception) Iraq war the  and their willingness to let president bush turn their convention into a campaign rally has truly skewed their perspective.  at some point we need to ask ourselves whether we are AMERICAN christians or CHRISTIAN americans.  the kingdom we serve is not of this world.  thus, any attempt to equate america with God's reign is utterly ridiculous.  brothers and sisters, let us put aside our trust in chariots and horses in order to have a deeper, more abiding faith in God as well a more passionate, unrelenting commitment to Christ's church.    i am tempted to continue with a rebuttal of their next two reasons, especially their anger at the acceptance of the CBF (what was the bwa to do, stick their head in the sand and act like this group didn't exist?  My good friend told me that one of the 'knockout questions' the "International Missions Board" asks candidates is whether they have ever been a member of or associated with the CBF in any way.  Bloody hell, what are they afraid of, double agents?!), but every bit of discernment I have (i readily admit that supplies are limited) suggests that it is time to stop ranting and get back to work.  Lord God, enable me to be as gracious with the missteps and sin of my brothers and sisters as you are with me.  in the midst of my anger, help me to refrain from reflecting the SBC's error by impulsively pushing City on a Hill to sever all ties with the national SBC.  i confess that far too often my criticism is virulent and vengeful.  teach me how to express criticism in constructive and loving ways.   if you want to read more about the SBC's decision, visit  urlLink CT's Weblog .  if this post left you in need of comic relief, feel free to read CT's  urlLink interview with w .

       In Memoriam: Ralph Wiley 1952-2004   Ralph Wiley was the senior writer of Espn's Page 2 and the author of the first Sports Illustrated feature (on Eric Davis) that I remember reading.  One of his Page 2 companions said it best when he noted that Wiley wrote with "gravitas."  Whether he was writing about baseball, boxing, basketball or the issue of race Wiley spoke with power and precision.  Moreover, instead of feigning objectivity or indifference, Wiley almost always shared how the story connected with and influenced his experience. R-Dub was a rare writer indeed.  I haven't read any of his longer works, which include  urlLink Born to Play: The Eric Davis Story  or  urlLink Why Black People Tend to Shout .  The latter is now officially on my list.  For more about Wiley, check out  urlLink Page 2's: A Writer, Celebrated .

       on the journey from cynicism to credo   although i have highly developed, cocksure defense mechanisms that suggest otherwise, i have always struggled with doubt.  these doubts have ranged from the trivial, like when, as a five year old, i anxiously doubted whether i had eaten the tasty looking, but poisonous pellets my father scattered upon the lawn, to crucial, like when the mere thought of preaching a sermon or leading a youth retreat would reduce me to lying on a cold tile floor in the fetal position.    fortunately, over the past four years i have slowly begun to believe that i am who God says i am in Christ (i.e., chosen, predestined, adopted, redeemed, for more indicatives see Eph. 1 or Romans 8).  Whether this hesitant, yet clearly progressive movement from cynicism to credo is the result of the deeper sense of self-identification that some call 'maturity,' the result of finding a place that i can truly call home, the fruit and evidence of the indwelling Spirit or, most likely, a funky collaboration of these reasons, i really don't know.    however, i do know that by God's grace i am ready to start walking from the place of doubt towards the place of belief or what uncle henri would call the movement from "the house of fear to the house of love."  anyway, to make a short introduction long, i would like to begin chronicling my personal credo or statement of faith.  these entries will appear now  and then under the title  Credo .  so, here goes...  i believe in God.    i believe he is our creator, though he often chose to do so in inscrutable ways.  i believe that he is good, as evidenced in the wonderful abandon of children, the beautiful, rhythmic pounding of the waves upon singing beach and his inerrant faithfulness to his often faithless people.  i believe that God is a unity in community of three personal beings, Father, Son and Holy Spirit.  each of these beings works all things to the ultimate good of both the godhead and those who have been called according to his purpose.  i believe that God loves to communicate.  this divine gift of gab is readily apparent in the 'book of creation' as well as in the tanak, the NT and, supremely, through the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.  i do not believe that i have a grip on God, but i believe that he has a firm hold on me.   thus ends my first entry.  please note that i am not trying to write a systematic theology or produce a highly learned treatise.  i'm merely providing a personal, narrative account of my faith.  hopefully, if you keep this intent in mind, you'll be able to forgive the apparently naive and undoubtedly cliche ways that i express myself.  concerning my second religion... as much as i loathe the cubs, i love watching mark prior pitch.  his flawless mechanics, bulldog mentality and willingness to brushback barry bonds have made him one of my favorites.  a pitching prodigy like prior almost makes me wish the cardinals had also sucked for years on end.  then, we could also have a respectable starting rotation.

       keeping the questions alive   over the past several weeks i have been questioning my previous assumptions about my relationships with people who are not following Christ.  last week i had a conversation with my co-worker Krista, who is more interested in reading tea leaves (literally) than the gospels, about my internal resistance to particularistic (i.e., through Jesus only) salvation.   i told krista that on the one hand, when Christ says that "no one comes to the father except by him," i want to simply take him at his word.  the road is indeed narrow, i reason, so i should set my dissonance with particularism aside.  yet, on the other hand, when i hear these same words i cannot help but make qualifications.  surely, when Jesus wrote these words, he wasn't speaking of melvin, my mentally handicapped friend whose primary source of identification in a nominally christian community is that he is jewish not christian.  so, though scripture is silent on the salvation of the handicapped who have not made an objective decision to follow Christ, we can assume that God's grace is sufficient.  moreover, although he didn't explicitly confess Christ, surely Christ's reconciliation was incarnate through and eventually extended to ghandi...and on and on i went.   in the midst of the conversation, i began to wonder whether krista and i should be having this conversation at all.  after all, as my missions and evangelism teachers at lcc would have reminded me, my job is not to raise further doubts for unbelievers but through intellectual argument, personal testimony and reliable companionship to woo them to Christ.  thus, part of me believes that i should be ashamed of myself for creating roadblocks instead of straight roads for the gospel.  yet there is another voice within me, which is much quieter than the voices of either tradition or professors past, that reminds me that such vulnerability and personal revelation is essential to proclamation.  perhaps, as someone i read this week surmised, my job as a pastor and sojourner is not to provide answers, but to keep the great questions alive.    anyway, that is a ridiculously long introduction to a quotation from henri that i would like to share.  in this passage henri speaks of 'reverse mission.'  as i read this passage i could not help but think of friends like krista, melvin or mark who do not follow Christ, yet may have a mission that i need to receive and a message that i need to hear.  "...i have become aware that wherever God's Spirit is present there is a reverse mission.  	when i marched with thousands of black and white americans from selma to montgomery in the summer of 1965 to support the blacks in their struggle for equal rights, martin luther king already said that the deeper spiritual meaning of the civil rights movement was that the blacks were calling the whites to conversion.   	when, years later, i joined l'arche to live and work with mentally handicapped people, i soon learned that my real task would be to let those whom i wanted to help offer me--and through me many others--their unique spiritual gifts. 	this 'reversal' is a sign of God's Spirit.  the poor have a mission to the rich, the blacks have a mission to the whites, the handicapped have a mission to the 'normal,' the gay people have a mission to the straight,' the dying have a mission to the living.  those whom the world has made into victims God has chosen to be bearers of good news. 	when Jesus heard that eighteen people had been killed when the tower at siloam had fallen down, he was asked whether these men and women were worse sinners than others.  'they were not. i tell you,' he said. 'no, but unless you repent you will perish as they did.' Jesus shows that the victims become our evangelists, calling us to conversion.  that's the reverse mission that keeps surprising us."  ~ urlLink Here and Now: Living in the Spirit , pgs. 58-59.

       brushback pitches , personal reflections and unsolicited opinions   in lieu of doing real work, i have decided to pen another random post.  aren't you among the lucky ones?    it's official: the redbirds are 15 games over .500 and I'm a believer!  this cardinal's team seems to have all the elements that make up a champion, including: surprising contributions by veterans (see chris carpenter and tony womack), sufficient starting pitching (yes, with the way morris and williams have been pitching this area requires a leap of faith), a dependable bullpen, world class defense (everybody repeat after me, 'defense wins…') and gaudy offensive production.  i haven't believed like this since '96.  around 6:45 this morning, before escorting kellie to the commuter rail, i tried to catch the cards-cubs highlights on sportscenter.  as per usual sc failed to satiate my need.  instead of the highlights I was looking for they offered a segment on the worst calls in sports history.  the last heart wrenching clip they showed was, you guessed it, the dumbass call don denkinger in the sixth game of the '85 series.  after watching the this clip for the umpteenth time and realizing that it has been 24 years since our last world series victory I am tempted to say something like "at least don denkinger is dead!"  but I'm a christian gentleman, so I won't say that.  yesterday was my grandfather's 83rd birthday.  happy birthday papa!  when I consider the significant part that papa (who shares the honor of being my favorite person with my wife) has played in my life one experience often comes to mind.  I must have been eight or nine years old when my grandparents took me and my cousin amy on a short business trip to ft. smith, arkansas.  on friday afternoon, after papa had finished his business in the area, he took amy and I down to the hotel's indoor pool for a little swim.  while we were playing in the water papa kneeled down and had me climb upon his shoulders and then amy climbed upon mine.  papa was the firm foundation of the little pyramid that we built there in the holidometm and he has continued to be our foundation for the 19 years that have followed.  papa, you are a man above reproach and my co-favorite person on the planet.  words are unable to express my love for you.  happy birthday!  i hope that God grants us a few more years together.  Wow, this room just got a bit dusty…  last night at homechurch we said goodbye to ben russell for the summer.  ben is our virtuoso violinist and budding theologian who is going to spend his summer gracing the koussevitzsky concert shed at  urlLink tanglewood .  tanglewood is the enchanting summer home of the boston symphony orchestra and the boston pops. if you are interested in joining our home church for all-inclusive evening out at tanglewood (multiple samuel smith four packs and various white wines will be included) let me know.  we'd love to have you join us!   this blog post has been brought to you by the good people at  urlLink Christianbook.com .  at  christianbook.com  we pride ourselves in enabling our employees to piddle on the job.

       reflection on a midnight confession   although i meant what i said last night, there is little doubt that if i had left the second bottle of  urlLink Wolaver's I.P.A.  in the fridge and revisited my wording in the clear light of dawn i could have offered a more complete (not to mention concise!) confession.  however, i suppose there are times that writing is more akin to ventilating a furnace than shaping an equation.  last night was one of the former, and it felt good.  as i read my post again this morning, looking for typos or syntactical snakes, i remembered a quotation from merton's  urlLink Conjectures of a Guilty Bystander  which clearly expresses what i was trying to say in my own convoluted way.  "In Louisville, on the comer of Fourth and Walnut, in the center of the shopping district, I was suddenly overwhelmed with the realization that I loved all these people, that they were mine and I was theirs, that we could not be alien to one another even though we were total strangers. I have the immense joy of being human, a member of the race in which God himself became incarnate. The sorrows and stupidities of the human condition can no longer overwhelm me, now that I realize what we all are. If only everybody could realize this! But it cannot be explained. There is no way of telling people that they are all walking around shining like the sun."

       a long overdue confession   over the past few weeks i have realized that more and more LCCers have been reading this blog.  friends, your presence has warmed my heart and the resulting thaw has flowered forth in confession.  first, i would like to apologize for the way that i treated you during our four years together. i realize that my attitude often suggested a superiority complex and my psuedo-intellectual interests often smelled like snobbery, but neither my attitude nor my apparent snobbery were intentional.  rather, these unsavory elements of my character were products of my fear of vocational transition as well as a deep seated-sense of inadequacy.  i harbored such a deep passion for self-identification that i was often uninterested in identifying with the group.  so in the process of trying to find myself, i alienated myself from my community...and suffered as a result.    second, i would like to share with you a snapshot of the journey that saved my life.  on my senior year 'week of e' and for the summer following graduation i served as an assistant with the l'arche daybreak community of toronto, canada. though my time at l'arche taught me many things, the most important lesson that i learned was that everyone, from my non-verbal housemate michael to my staunchest enemies (it probably will not be hard for you to believe that i have always had a few) have a gift to give.  each life, insofar as it is created in the image of God, has overwhelming value.  l'arche taught me that my role as an assistant was to be a midwife to the core members, as i assisted them in giving birth to their own identity and their own unique giftedness.  in the end, i realized that they (especially michael) were midwives to me.  i left l'arche with a true sense of my identity as a servant of christ, but, more importantly, i left there with the understanding that every person has an irreplaceable gift to give to the community.  moreover, to fail to recognize and to celebrate that gift is to fail to love our Creator God.  third, and most importantly, i have specific apologies to make:  jaimie, i am sorry for my uncritical rejection and, at times, condemnation of you.  i thought that loyalty to my friend required me to condemn you.  this was not an expectation he placed upon our friendship, but my ignorant assumption.  i was so wrong.  because of my blindness i failed to see the gifts that you brought to our community.  please forgive me.  wentz, i was rather jealous of you.  you walked into our community during my sophomore year and were immediately recognized as the man of character and wisdom that you are.  for some foolish reason i thought 'success' for me would eventually lead to competition with you.  nothing could be further from the truth.  i have since realized that competition is not a christian virtue, but a heinous vice.  i am sorry that i let such faulty thinking stand in the way of getting to know you.  i am also sorry for trying to dash your innate sense of mystery and wonder.  if i remember correctly, and it was sin--so chances are quite good that i do, there was an occasion on which you pointed out to me the intricate beauty of one of the earthworms that liked to call our sidewalks home.  i didn't respond to your reflection but rejoiced in stomping the earthworm into oblivion, as if such an action would quench the quirky wonder that characterizes your spirit.  that was incredibly foolish...st. francis would have been ashamed of my action and i am as well.  please forgive me.  em-em, you probably don't read this, but it needs to be said anyhow.  i am sorry for the way things played out between us. i had every intention to treat you like a younger sister, with absolute purity, but i failed more often than not.  if i could only change one thing about our friendship, which meant more to me that my year long silence would lead you to believe, it would be the ending.  i was shocked that someone other than myself announced to you something that i would have rather shared in a more personal way.  i hope that it doesn't pour the proverbial salt in the wound for me to wish you the best as you head to philadelphia.  i have little doubt that through your gifts numerous corners of the developing world will be introduced to the wonderful majesty of God's Kingdom.  undoubtedly there are more things to say, but i trust that you can hear the cry of my heart.  i long to realize the reconciliation that Christ has effected between us and hope that in some small way we can experience the community that i so foolishly neglected some years ago.    peace of Christ,  gentry

       the fog of war   after watching  urlLink the fog of war  for the second time, i was quite stunned by one of robert mcnamara's "life lessons."  the first lesson that he provided was "empathize with your enemy."  in that section mcnamara goes to great lengths to explain how the kennedy administration's ability to empathize with khrushchev's predicament was absolutely essential.  in a later segment he notes the johnson administration's failure to empathize with the vietnamese leaders as a primary reason for the escalation and ultimately the failure of the vietnam war. furthermore, as if mcnamara's detailed and engaging narratives were not enough to press home the importance of the first life lesson, errol morris' entire film is a testimony to the centrality of this lesson.  before seeing the film i bought the prevailing cultural assessment about mcnamara (i.e., that he was a warmonger, prideful to a tragic degree, responsible for vietnam, etc.) but by the end of it i was able to see him as a brilliant, willful man, who was as proud of his successes and as prone to mistakes as the rest of us.  the only significant difference is that his responsibility was much greater and, as a result, his mistakes had much more significant consequences.  i do not mean to suggest that i do not consider mcnamara in some sense responsible for the travesty that was vietnam.  however, the movie helped me to understand how he found himself in that terribly difficult predicament.   all of that is to say that i have yet to learn mcnamara's life lesson.  i do not often show empathy to my enemy by giving them the benefit of the doubt, assuming that their intentions are pure or even trying to understand how their familial/social/psychological context lead them to embrace a particular position.  instead of trying to understand their worldview i tend to hammer away with them with what i believe to be the 'facts' as well as my (often shoddy) analysis.  by doing that i do not develop a deeper understanding of their position, nor am i able to more fully nuance my own.  this inability to empathize with my enemies has been readily evident in the way that i have processed the iraq war.  i have not attempted to understand the philosophy that underlies neo-con policy, the fear that seems to drive much of the civilian response or any of the other reasons that reasonable, decent people consider this war just.  as a result, my desire and ability to dialogue about the war has slowly abated and i have found myself on more than one occasion wondering "how any christian in their right mind could support this war" or "how in the world this administration could make a reasonable connection between the decentralized 'war on terror' and the need to make war upon and rebuild secular, islamic nation state."  although it sounds, and is, cliche, i need to work on truly understanding others before seeking to be understood.  Lord Christ, forgive me for unwittingly playing the role of the elder brother, who couldn't seem to set aside his understanding of righteousness in order to empathize with and embrace his repentant brother.  by your grace, help me to empathize with my enemy, as you did, believing that our Father can indeed make all things, even our enemies, new.   if you've seen the  the fog of war  i'd love to hear your reflections.

      i found the following quote on  urlLink simkin's blog , which includes some of the finest christian writing on the net, and i decided to paste it here for the sake of further reference.  "You have to have a certain shamelessness to write. You have to be willing to drop your pants in front of anyone that might want to look. And you don't do that because you're proud of it, you do that because you have to write. It's not a choice.... You write because you have no other option." -Rich Mullins  i wonder if after saying this rich literally dropped his pants and paraded around the reporter singing "old grey mare he ain't what he used to be, ain't what he used to be, ain't what he used to be..." ala the simpsons.  that action would be far more in character for rich than stroking his chin like a two bit philosopher or striking the pose of "the thinker."  enough silliness...i must turn my attention to satiating the needs of the christian consumer.

       Random Brushbacks and Additional Reflections     after three straight come from behind wins, two occurring in the ninth inning-which is something they hadn't accomplished all year until thursday night, the cardinals are now 14 games over .500 and three games over the scum-sucking little bears.  this is a bit belated, since i promised such a proclamation when they reached the 10 over mark, but here it is: I believe in the 2004 Cardinals.   if we can pick up a serviceable pitcher on the market, ala, garcia, benson or rogers (though i doubt the latter is available) we might be on our way to the pennant.  yes, the scum-sucking little bears will be tough, but i'm banking on baker over-pitching Zambrano & Prior as well as Wood staying on the DL for quite a while (considering his injury history that's not an unreasonable hope).    at this point in the season, who do you think the Phils would rather have, bowa or rolen?  booting rolen instead of bowa is starting to look like broglio for brock or bagwell for anderson.  i've heard the giants are now selling rubber chickens so that their fans can heckle other teams for walking bonds.  the proceeds of all chicken sales will go to their charity organization.  i don't know what magowan was thinking!  the proceeds should be added to their coffers so that they can find a hitter to protect Zeus.  hey sabean, am i the only one who's thought of a pierzynski/alfonzo or rodriguez for beltran trade?  you have the money you silly monkey and the west is wide open.  so make it happen!  yesterday afternoon my good friend mark paris took us to see 'rent.'  sound problems aside, i thought the musical was pretty powerful.  the narrative thrust of the story wasn't that insightful, but it probably packed a bigger punch in '96 when it was released.  by the way, if you ever get an opportunity to catch a performance at the Wang Theater in boston, don't pass it up.  that is one remarkable setting.  yesterday, i also had the opportunity to visit the boston public library for the first time.  i was overwhelmed by the entire experience, including the unparalleled lamps hanging from the exterior, the mosaics in the main entry way and the absolutely regal main reading room (which like everything else in boston, was restored with federal funds.  no one knows how to work the appropriations committee like our patrons on beacon hill).  okay, i need to run.  my wife's dishwasher isn't working, and if i'm not careful, she might slap it:).  i'll try to finish these reflections later this evening.

       beyond belief   the bush campaign has stooped to new lows by asking  urlLink "church-going volunteers to turn over church membership directories"  to local campaign headquarters. civil libertarians have condemned this move as a clear violation of church and state and a number of churches, including the southern baptist convention, have summarily condemned this ploy as well. i have, on occasion slammed on the sbc for intermingling faith and politics, so i have to give them the props on this one. they might be willing to turn their national convention into a virtual campaign rally for bush, but clearly they have their limits.  perhaps bush is more vulnerable than many of us expected. joe klein is reporting that  urlLink the chicken-hawks are squabbling among themselves , a majority of american's have finally admitted that the 'liberation' of iraq was (suprise-surprise!) a bad idea, and bush is now blatantly whoring himself to evangelicals in a desperate attempt to win votes. dear friends, i hope that he doesn't win yours...but if he does, i'll love you anyway.  if you would like a complete record of the bush administration's (mis)statements on iraq, check out this  urlLink report  from the House of Representatives' Commmittee on Government Reform.

       worth reading   in this recent  urlLink essay  eric alterman asks a valid question: what if the media had examined the claims of the bush administration as carefully as it examined the claims of michael moore? in his opinion, which is backed up by nothing less than a full congressional report, bush wouldn't have come out smelling like a rose.    i guess that the 'so called liberal media' is more interested in attacking a progressive filmmaker than a presidential administration which tends to construct its own truth.

       one of the things I like best…   about city on a hill is that our organic structure enables us to invest the overwhelming majority of our resources (around 95%) in the mission of the church. over the past week or so I've been thinking about how we can invest our money not only in foreign mission (though we love partnering with you faye!) but in the life missions of each member.  thus, I would love for us: to send dr. james (our budding peter weir or kevin smith) to the spirituality in film that's taking place in l.a.,  fund a few of craig's spiritual retreats (which might give him time to create another piece to add to the city on a hill hymnal) , enable brooke to take an extra voice lesson or send myself to the emergent conversation with brueggemann in september. i am beginning to realize that by investing in life missions of our members we are really investing in our larger community as well as the church as a whole.    this excellent  urlLink reflection by brian mclaren  helped stir up these thoughts.

       anastasia   this morning i stumbled upon a rather startling truth.  i don't think much, or know what to think, about our belief in resurrection. sure, i can say the apostle's creed without my fingers crossed behind my back, know the gospel stories and remember bob monts' excellent lecture on the power of  zoe . however, in all honesty, resurrection has yet to become the animating principle of my faith. clearly, this is a problem.  for this reason, i am deeply grateful for NT Wright's  resurrection of the Son of God .  this tome has diagnosed my confusion in this area and has proscribed a healthy understanding of how resurrection was understood within the larger cultural context of the early church and what the early church actually believed about resurrection. my prayer is that by the time i finish the book, which at this pace might be around this time next year, i will be reacquainted with the core of our shared faith.   i also stumbled across this thought from uncle henri regarding resurrection and thought i would share:  "the great mystery of the spiritual life--the life in God--is that we don't have to wait for it as something that will happen later. Jesus says: 'dwell in me as i dwell in you.' it is this divine in-dwelling that is eternal life. it is the active presence of God at the center of my living--the movement of God's Spirit within us--that gives us eternal life.  but still, what about life after death? when we live in communion with God, when we belong to God's own household, there is no longer any 'before' or 'after.' death is no longer the dividing line. death has lost its power over those who belong to God, because God is the God of the living, not of the dead. once we have tasted the joy and peace that come from being embraced by God's love, we know that all is well and will be well. 'don't be afraid,' Jesus says. 'i have overcome the powers of death...come and dwell with me and know that where i am, your God is.'  when eternal life is our clear goal it is not a distant goal. it is a goal that can be reached in the present moment. when our heart understands this divine truth, we are living the spiritual life." ~ Here and Now , pg. 70

       concerning progressive propaganda   we joined the wilcoxs and the defranzas for a matinee showing of  fahrenheit 9/11  this weekend.  i thought 9/11 was generally well done.  as many have noted, it was much less egocentric than moore's other paeans to the progressivism, and he provides some fairly intriguing revelations (esp. concerning the depth of the bush family connections to the bin ladens).  however, i found the juxtaposition of horrible images, such as a saudi beheading, with rather hysterical segments, including white-bread marines trying to recruit african american men by trying to 'talk black' and playing up the fact that 'shaggy' was one of the few and the proud, quite difficult to bear. in fact, the frequent transitions between humor and horror exhausted me, leaving me pretty much speechless for hours afterward.  though 9/11 was well done, it wasn't half the documentary that  urlLink fog of war  was. i realize that both the historical distance from the events in question as well and the direct access he had to robert mcnamara helped errol morris' cause.  however on Sunday evening i couldn't help but wish that morris, not moore, had crafted an expose on bush.  morris' subtle provocation wouldn't have made as big a splash as something by moore, but it would have ended up having a more enduring impact.  dr. james says the most fair handed review...um, i mean striking criticism...he has found of moore's work can be found  urlLink here .  if you've seen the movie I'd love to hear your thoughts.

       thankful   i complain when sermons go awry, so i should probably tell you when they go well.  yesterday i had the opportunity to preach at Hill Memorial Baptist in allston, ma.  Hill Memorial is an older, ABC congregation that consists of middle aged and older believers, most of whom have led challenging lives and bear evidence of the scars of broken relationships, and a smattering of wonderfully curious children and teens. i preach there once a month, try to express a measure of pastoral concern for the congregation and get to pay my comcast bill as a result. so, up to this point, our relationship has been mutually beneficial.   after preaching a bomb of a sermon earlier this month and so desecrating their 'children's sunday,' i promised myself that i committed myself to preparing a well-developed sermon this time. fortunately by God's grace, the results weren't half bad. for the past few weeks i have been reading the gospel of luke.  when i stumbled across the 'parable of the prodigal son' in lk. 15, i couldn't help but wonder why i had never heard a parable from the perspective of the elder brother. following craig blomberg i think that this parable provides 'one major point per person.' so i set out to preach from the elder brother's perspective.   although i was more than a little hesitant to do so, i decided to shape the sermon as a first person narrative. so, after studying the text with some care, i wrote a story about a upper class, pious episcopalian elder brother whose younger sister drained a third of the family trust (botching the family plans to invest in the yahoo i.p.o. in the process) and abandoned her well healed, beacon hill family to marry a disaffected, upper middle class hippie on the west coast. i reshaped a couple of incidental details as well, such as her returning with a second dirtbag husband whom she wanted to marry (picture connie in the godfather II), the father throwing her a celebration that served as both a welcome home party and a bridal shower, and her being adorned with her late mother's wedding dress and ring. the brother is confronted with dave matthews band pumping out the bay windows and the sight of a catering truck in front of the brownstone as he walks home from work.  things proceed from there. anyway, to make a long story short, the sermon connected. i worked hard at trying to understand the psychology behind the brother's response and, compared with other sermons i've preached as of late, i practiced my ass off. there were a few in the congregation that arched an eyebrow during the sermon (perhaps due to the fact that i called my father's daughter a whore on a number of occasions) and extended a pious condemnation after (that was interesting...). thankfully, most of the people were clearly connecting with the sermon and afterwards a few of them took me up on my offer to discuss the sermon afterwards.   however, as is often the case, in the end i was the primary beneficiary. though i have often identified more readily with the prodigal, as is fitting considering the immature, and sometimes illegal, antics of my adolescent years, i realized that in the last couple of years i have been trying on the role of elder brother. this is especially true in the case of felipe, a chilean student who my parents graciously took in as one of their own (they are well practiced in this area), and who subsequently brought dishonor to the ministerial vocation and shame to my family.  my parents, no doubt following in the footsteps of God, have long since forgiven felipe of his trespass and have sought to walk with him towards restoration.  however, i have continued to condemn felipe in my heart for some time. i have little respect for someone who dishonors their pastoral vocation in the way that he did (i suppose the ways i dishonor it are much more acceptable...) and i have no tolerance for someone whose actions impugn my family in any way (i tend to protect my family in the same fierce way that the elder brother was trying to protect the father). i now see that by continuing to reject my fellow sinner, i have been rejecting the overwhelming love of my parents and that of the father, which i have been the beneficiary of on so many occasions. i confess that such condemnation is out of step with my profession of love. thus, i want to set it aside. may God give me the grace to realize that by rejecting those he has forgiven, i am, in essence, rejecting Him.   i realize that this is yet another long winded, confessional entry that is more for private reflection than public consumption. thanks for bearing with me.

       news from hell   kellie and i are currently relaxing at the home of john and fran board who live just outside of hell, michigan. yesterday we celebrated the fourth with the boards, kellie's sister jennifer (the board's daughter), jen's brother's family and their beautiful kids and more episcopal priests than you can imagine. the conversation was intriguing, the food was remarkable and the beer flowed like wine. while there isn't much love lost between the midwest and I, especially  after i received a ticket just outside of cleveland, there is a relaxing rhythm to life out here. i can feel my soul unwinding even as we speak.  since i will have limited internet access and christianbook.com is not paying me to blog this week, you'll be hearing from me far less frequently. consider yourself blessed!  i almost forgot...david lee roth's baton twirling rendition of "jump" last night at pops goes the fourth registered an absolute 10 out of 10 on the bill simmons memorial unintentional comedy scale. brilliant.

       tension    i help lead a relational christian community, yet perceive myself as the primary leader of a hierarchal congregation. thus, i value interdependence, but fail to comprehend that our church's mission and vision must be the product of collaboration. likewise, i believe that each member is responsible for the vitality of our community, yet i never fail to accept sole responsibility for our failures.   i am passionate about proclaiming the gospel of redemption, yet am deeply committed to the incarnation of Christ's compassion. thus, when i hear evangelicals' stirring calls to conversion, a cord in my heart vibrates, and when i experience the inclusive, unconditional love of my episcopalian family and friends, another cord rings true. i am often tempted focus on one cord or the other, but know that in order to follow Christ, i must play both. i often wish that i could be either a virtuoso evangelist or social worker, instead of dealing with the characteristic frustration and mediocrity of the both/and.   i want to be known for&nbsp;extravagant, inclusive love and the proclamation of an exclusive gospel. i long to win the affections of men and God. i want to have my cake and eat it too.   Lord God, grant me the grace to live in the tension. i want to follow the One who was both Man and God, characterized by justice and mercy and who reigns over the now but not yet.

       Excerpts of Jim Wallis'  urlLink Excellent Editorial  in the Boston Globe   "The best public contribution of religion is precisely not to be ideologically predictable or a loyal partisan. To always raise the moral issues of human rights, for example, will challenge both left- and right-wing governments who put power above principles. Religious action is rooted in a much deeper place than "rights"-- that being the image of God in every human being."  "It is because religion takes the problem of evil so seriously that it must always be suspicious of too much concentrated power -- politically and economically -- either in totalitarian regimes or in huge multinational corporations that now have more wealth and power than many governments. It is indeed our theology of evil that makes us strong proponents of both political and economic democracy -- not because people are so good but because they often are not and need clear safeguards and strong systems of checks and balances to avoid the dangerous accumulations of power and wealth."  "In an election year, the particular religiosity of a candidate, or even how devout he might be, is less important than how his religious and/or moral commitments and values shape political vision and policy commitments. Understanding the moral compass a candidate brings to his public life and how his convictions shape his political priorities is the true litmus test."

       the fruit of procrastination   tonight, instead of investing in my thursday evening teaching i decided to spend time with kellie and watch the 2004 all-star game. the following thoughts flitted through my brain sometime during the evening:    it pains me to say this, but i believe that joe buck is being brainwashed by tim mccarver. case in point: he has spent the night saying things like, 'if you have noticed vlad guerrero yet, you're really missing out' and 'mark mulder might not be a household name, but he's a fixture in the bay area.' is there any self-respecting fan who hasn't known about vlad since his injury shortened debut in 1996? likewise, whether due to the lame x-files jokes made on sportscenter or the last three years of the alds most people know who mulder is. insert the rant of the durham bulls coach on nuke laloosh's debut here.  speaking of laloosh, clemens did a hell of a tim robbins impersonation this evening. i am a die-hard national league fan, but i couldn't help but enjoy seeing clemens getting whipped like a red headed stepchild this evening. clemens is a mercenary and traitor (reports are that he is trying to engineer a trade to a contender as we speak), who unfortunately never blew his elbow or rotator cuff (there's still time roger!).  it was also fulfilling to see kent make an elementary error on the infield. mug with ali all you want kent, we still know that you're an unregenerate, 'truck washing' redneck.  scott rolen is the bodhisattva of the hot corner.  according to mccarver, 'there has not been a meaningful conversation between a runner and a first baseman in the history of the game.' thanks for the striking insight tim! wisdom certainly does come with age.   would it kill fox, or baseball tonight for that matter, to employ rob neyer or bill james as a color analyst? i am beginning to believe that the network heads are raging anti-sabrites.   that's enough for one evening. i will bore no more.

       realization   i confess that i do not delight in your Word.       i do not respond to the rhythms      discern the themes      or identify with the recipients.  i do not savor the poetry of the psalms      leave my heart vulnerable to paul's polemics      or respond to the call to conversion that resonates throughout Hebrews.  i love the subversive narratives and parables of the gospels      but often walk away feeling like one who is      "ever hearing but never understanding      and ever seeing but never perceiving."  Sovereign Lord, when i read your Word please rend my heart.  Spirit, when i hear your Word help me to listen.  Master, when i am confronted by the Word please loosen my stiffened neck.   have you found a regular practice or spiritual discipline that has inclined your hear and opened your heart once again to the Word? if so, i would love to hear your story.

       growing young    yesterday i went lobstering on the edge of the atlantic with cynthia and tina delgado, two of the afterschool kids, and Phil, a software engineer who is an amateur lobsterman and a long time  urlLink bootstraps  volunteer.   after baiting the traps, gawking at skates and naming the lobsters (jeff, thomas and sheldon--insert  when harry met sally  dialogue here) i realized for the millionth time that i love children. their bright eyes, ever ready sense of wonder, infectious joy and even unrepressed sorrow remind me of what i lack.   perhaps that is the reason that rich's  growing young  often leaves me on the verge of tears. growing young is such a wonderful metaphor for salvation! my eyes go blank when people start talking about 'saving souls,' but the hope of recapturing the light in my eyes, rediscovering wonder and setting aside the self-rejection that regularly keeps me from truly expressing the joy and sorrow of human experience, inspires me.   Lord God, please enable me to set aside the cynicism, relational retardation and emotional indifference that are part and parcel of 'maturity.' i long to become a child, your child, once again.   thank you for tommy, who once tried to teach me about growing young. it took me four years, but i am finally starting to respond to those lessons.

       stuck between sublimity and sorrow   &nbsp;  tomorrow morning at 11am e.s.t. kellie and i are going to close on our first home. we're purchasing a quirky, 2 bedroom&nbsp;condo that is just off cabot street and right behind the majestic  urlLink cabot cinema . we're&nbsp;thrilled about settling into our new home and finally having space for relational ministry (our current residence is about the size of the closet in my parents master bedroom...hell, i've lived in dorm rooms bigger than this apartment).  &nbsp;  the previous owners of the condo are andrew and megan defranza, who are close friends and absolutely remarkable disciples. megan was the registrar at  gcts  for several years, where she worked with the 'incomparable' bill levin, recently finished her mdiv degree and is on her way to ph. d. studies at marquette. she is one of the most thoughtful, engaging thinkers i met during my time at gcts. if they don't hire her at some point in the future i am going to summarily withdraw my non and probably never-existent&nbsp;contribution to the seminary's endowment. evangelicalism need more female theologians like meg and less upper middle class white guys debating the merits of patriarchy, oops...i mean complementarianism. andrew is one of the most aggressive, effective proponents of christian compassion that i have ever met. for the past five years he has been the outreach coordinator at  urlLink beverly bootstraps  where he has pioneered the afterschool program (that i serve in), kept dozens of benevolence programs running smoothly and responding to multiple crises every day. i wish i could provide a more adequate description of andrew, but his character and passion refuse the limitations of words. perhaps the highest compliment i can give him is that he is, like my papa pep, truly a man above reproach. i have never heard a negative word spoken about andrew or papa, and i doubt that i ever will. so, needless to say, we, as well as the rest of the beverly community, are torn up about the defranzas departure. i would live in this rat trap apartment for another five years if it meant that we could keep them in the community.  &nbsp;  thus, i find myself in the midst of another tension. i am incredibly excited about our condo, but am heartbroken about their departure. of course, true to form, through their generosity the defranzas made this purchase one of the greatest gifts i have ever received, but i'll save that story for another entry.  &nbsp;  thank you andrew and megan for who you are and what you've done for this community. damn you for leaving us!

       clippings from  weavings    &nbsp;  over the last couple of days, which have been delightfully lazy, i have been leafing through the latest copy of  urlLink weavings .  weavings  is a penetrating 'journal of the christian spiritual life' that neal windham introduced me to (he also provided us with a gift subscription, which was nice). the latest edition focuses on gentleness, a fruit of the spirit which is rarely attested to in my life. for obvious reasons, i found the first statement quite convicting. the other two passages are provided for good measure.  &nbsp;  "the word gentle itself bespeaks a similar rootedness in what we all share. from the latin  gens , it reminds us of our common humanity--that we are a people, a race, made from this earth that sustains us all. in the middle ages, the word came to refer to the gentry: a gentleman was one who had land, family, money and power, and for that reason owed protection and care to the unentitled. an idea honored in the breach more than the observance, perhaps, but there is something in the notion of  noblesse oblige --the obligations of the gentry to the poor entrusted to their generosity--that applies to any of us who have been especially blessed. to be gentle is to be generous (as the common etymology makes quite clear) and to extend thanksgiving to God and hospitality to the poor as we are able." ~Marilyn Chandler McEntyre in "A Gentle Word"  &nbsp;   The Prayer of Saint Francis   &nbsp;  Lord, make me an instrument of thy peace;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where there is hatred, let me sow love;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where there is injury, pardon;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where there is doubt, faith;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where there is despair, hope;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where there is darkness, light;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and where there is sadness, joy.  &nbsp;  Grant that i may not so much seek,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to be consoled as to console;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to be understood as to understand;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to be love as to love;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for it is in giving that we receive,  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it is in pardoning that we are pardoned,  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.  &nbsp;  "Reading is the soul's food, light, lamp, refuge, consolation, and the spice of every spiritual savor. It feeds the hungry, it illumines the person sitting in the darkness; to refugees from shipwreck or war it comes with bread. It comforts the contrite heart, it contains the passions of the body with the hope of reward. When temptations attack, it counters them with the teaching and examples of the saints...In the bread box of sacred reading are breads baked in an oven, breads roasted on a grill, or cooked in a frying pan, breads made with the first fruits and sprinkled with oil, and barley cakes. So, when this table is approached by people from any walk of life, age, sex, status or ability, they will all be filled with the refreshment that suits them." ~Peter of Selle,  Selected Works

       a plagiarized confession and poorly metered supplication   Loving Father,   Alongside my sister Teresa I confess that "I don’t love you, I don't want to love you. But I want to want to love you."  Teach me how to submit, shut my mouth and listen, speak of you as a person, not a proposition.  I am so far from who I should be. Through your Spirit teach me to shun self and let Christ be the shape of me.  Today, as I struggle to be responsible with the work and relationships you have given, render me sensitive to the voice of the Spirit, vulnerable to the shaping of Christ, subservient to your rule.

       an unexpected devotional   i bummed sarah mclachlan's  afterglow  from my coworker and compatriot rhys yesterday. i was shocked by the beauty of these lyrics this morning and thought you might enjoy them as well.   world's on fire  Hearts are worn in these dark ages  You're not alone in this story's pages  Night has fallen amongst the living and the dying  And I try to hold it in, yeah I try to hold it in   [Chorus] The world's on fire and It's more than I can handle  I dive into the water  (I try to pull my ship) I try to bring more  More than I can handle  (Bring it to the table) Bring what I am able  I watch the heavens and I find a calling  Something I can do to change this moment  Stay close to me while the sky is falling  Don't wanna be left alone, don't wanna be alone   [Chorus]  Hearts break, hearts mend Love still hurts  Visions clash, planes crash  Still there's talk of  Saving souls, still the cold Is closing in on us   We part the veil on Archille's sun Stray from the straight line on this short run  The more we take, the less we become  A fortune of one that means less for some

       fighting against the afternoon anesthesia      is there a better nickname in baseball than 'the big unit?'   what would  you  made  urlLink george say ?   take a moment to carefully read  urlLink this proposal  by the anti-manicheist. this kind of 'above the line' approach could help reframe the abortion debate and, perhaps, even start to unthaw the 30 year cold war between the opposing 'pros.'   obama lit it up last night. edwards will undoubtedly do likewise this evening. will the last night of the lefty convention be a letdown?   i am really enjoying ben folds'  urlLink rockin' the suburbs  at present. props to rick and ryan for the recommendation    this ministry  would provide an excellent internship for a late 1990's holer

       you know you're a book whore when…      you find yourself gawking at  urlLink what hollywood believes  like a commuter fixates on a car wreck.   you torture your co-workers with innumerable questions related (do you know what tom cruise believes? do you know what sammy davis jr.  did  with Jesus Christ? Did I tell you what jack nicholson believes?) to the aforementioned book.   everyone you are remotely connected to, from african seminarians to spanish speaking pastors, ask you to utilize your discount on their behalf.   you get excited about cross promoting product on  urlLink christianitytoday.com .   you are ordered to develop a plan for marketing  urlLink the way of the master  on your site.    obviously my hypocrisy knows no bounds.

       'returning' as a spiritual discipline    the cliche proclaims that 'you can never go home again.' i think the cliche is a crock of shit. my experience suggests that the opposite is actually true. you  must  go home again. the fact that the journey home is often complicated, and&nbsp;filled with as much pain as pleasure, probably inspired the cliche. however, in most cases, we should not let the complications deter us, for returning is one of the disciplines of the spiritual life.   the complications we face upon returning are undoubtedly unique, but i think that i can summarize mine in the following way: returning requires me to reckon with who i once was and realize who i have become. last weekend i had the honor of participating in my cousin Amy's wedding. over the course of our terribly abbreviated trip (in on friday afternoon, out on sunday morning) i encountered individuals whom i once led into rank disobedience and whom still seem to be entangled in its grasp. moreover, i spoke with others whose ambition and resultant success encouraged me to question the direction of the life i currently lead. as i reflect on the weekend, i am lead to confess that i once was a preacher of license, an incarnation of lechery and a slave chained to my ambition. i realize that by God's grace and because of my participation 'in Christ,' i am not that man any more. yet&nbsp;alluring voices, which are louder and more distinct than the one that speaks of life, still whisper to me in the dark of night, telling me that i will never be anything more than a lecher, ladder climber and a man who leads the young astray.   by returning, i am enabled to face who i was and proclaim who God has&nbsp;&nbsp; (re)made me to be. hence, by the grace of God and through the enabling power of the Spirit i will not surrender to the subtle persuasion of the voices, but will continue to be reshaped into the image of the Savior i follow.   i do not intend these thoughts either an invitation to a 'pity party' or a subtle request for encouragement. rather, i share them because i truly believe that uncle henri and ani are right when they say:   "The great paradox of the spiritual life is, indeed, that the most personal is the most universal, that the most intimate, is most communal, and that the most contemplative is most active."  ~Henri Nouwen   "Cause to me, it's, there's nothing that's personal and private, it's all universal. There's no experience that I have ever had that's unique. And the fact that there is just certain stuff that we share but don't admit to and don't talk about. You know, what is that about?"  ~Ani Difranco

       nothing like a train to bring you home   as i find myself chugging through the dark tunnels of life, i need  urlLink Bill  to remind me that:  "Faith, she's a whistling train...runnin' hard in the dark Hope is like a thing untamed...gonna lay to waste your heart Love is a little bit of God...there for all to know Love is the everlasting arms...that never do let go. This is dangerous terrain...we're attempting to traverse And it's a cryin' shame...but it could be a lot worse."  if you are in need of cheap therapy or are simply longing for a trustworthy voice and a jangly guitar to affirm that you are not alone,  urlLink audible sigh  is the album for you.

       easier to proclaim than apply   'so what, so what, so what…' I can hear dr. sackett asking in his gruff, staccato voice. usually when that sound bite plays in the hidden recesses, i am trying to develop an appropriate conclusion to a teaching, but this time, i am trying to convince myself that the truth of the story applies to my own life.  yesterday i had the privilege of preaching at a little american baptist church in allston, ma (for you former  week of e'ers  and other sundry travelers, that's just about 3 minutes from harvard square). the sermon was the second installment of a series on the parable of the prodigal son. unsurprisingly, each sermon speaks from the perspective of one of the three main characters. the last sermon was a first person narrative that spoke from the perspective of the elder brother and yesterday's sermon spoke from the perspective of the prodigal. when I looked at the story from the perspective of the prodigal, i realized that we are called to practice the discipline of returning. by returning I am not speaking merely of one-time, cataclysmic, crack whore to Christ conversions, but also of the regular process of realizing who we are as children of God, repenting of who we were when we tried to masquerade as children of the dusk instead of children of the day and fully receiving the love of God.   i will, mercifully, refrain from sharing the entire content of the sermon, but will confess that after pounding on the first step of returning so strongly, i had a really difficult time believing it. the reasons for my doubt are trivial, but far from impotent. due to a simple scheduling mistake i arrived at the church just as at the moment that I was expected to preach. my unexpected tardiness left me completely out of sync, as well as flush red in the face, and the sermon never did recover. thus, the sermon that was pent up in my bones went largely unexpressed and for the rest of the day I moped around, struggling to believe that I am indeed a son of God. when such doubts about my identity arise, i usually repeat God's affirmation to Christ at his baptism, 'you are my Son, with whom I am well pleased,' figuring that if I am truly a member of Christ's body the affirmation applies directly to me (and probably you as well). but after the sermon, i didn't want to believe it. i doubted my sonship because i failed to preach effectively and i questioned my salvation out of fear that a dilettante like myself isn't worth it.  of course, therein lies the problem. on four out of ten days I don't believe that i am saved by the grace of God, but rather by my ability to effectively lead the body, faithfully submit myself to the lordship of Christ and fully utilize the 'gifts' that have been given me. so i stay in the far country because i do not believe that God is willing or able to transform this rebel into a son. i am much more receptive to the internal voice of self-rejection than i am to the voice that calls me beloved.   perhaps the reason the sermon didn't connect with the congregation is because it first had to be applied to the heart of the prodigal pastor. my prayer is by and through God's grace I will eventually realize who I am, so that I can finally be who He has created me to be. furthermore, i pray that all of us will learn to practice the discipline of returning.

       levity   a new day has come. i am no longer using this stage as my self-styled confessional wherein i, high-ball in hand, croon "young men they do get wooly." fortunately, i have been shaken out of my self-pity by a couple of doses of levity.   the first dose was administered last night, when  urlLink alex  finally moved in. although i'm usually an early to bed, early to rise type, i sacrificed sleep in order to stay up until his shift was over so that we could celebrate his move over a couple of beers. the sacrifice was well-worth it. alex is an upbeat, never met a stranger kind of character. his sense of humor, newfound but quickly developing commitment to Christ and love for the other is truly refreshing. i am grateful that God has enabled us to live this story together.  the second dose was administered this morning, as i checked in new titles to our database. although christianbook.com carries a lot of quality titles, we also carry some of the most ridiculous shit you could ever imagine. for your benefit, dear reader, i have listed a few of these titles below.     urlLink cat psalms    conversations with my dog    cats in the parsonage    puppy in the pulpit    how to get what you want from almost anybody: your self-defense consumer guide    i hope that your day is lightened by a bit of levity as well. bonus points will be awarded for those who can identify the strange allusion that is embedded in the first sentence.

      it's 2:33 on a monday afternoon and i'm already weary. as i contemplate the precursors of my present state, i realize that i am relationally exhausted. the weekend was a web of relational connections, in which i enjoyed being trapped, yet sapped my strength nonetheless. somehow, in the last few years i have transitioned from a life of disengagement to a life of almost complete engagement. my fragmented thoughts and fragile emotional state suggest that i need to search for the elusive mean that rests between these two poles. solitude should provide me with time to connect with God, intercede for the other and  prepare my heart to receive as well speak unto the lives of others. through engagement i should receive the admonishment/fellowship/gifts of the other and learn how i can use solitude to intercede for others.   furthermore, i realize that i am intellectually exhausted. as our church has matured i have been called upon to teach less and during the summer i am completely free of academic obligation, but i am intellectually spent. though i read religiously, it has been weeks, if not months, since i finished a treatise of any significant length, and the last time i scaled the heights of a tolstoy or n.t. wright was far too long ago. i feel like the mundane tasks that fill my working hours are slowly sapping my desire to study, contemplate and 'center down.'  i dedicate perhaps ten hours a week to serving our community, engaging in acts of compassion and preparing for the task of proclamation. the rest of my hours are spent creating a hunger for and servicing a culture i abhor. i am tired of trading my intellect for an increased market share.   finally, i must confess that holding onto hope has rendered me weary. last week i found out that one of the children i tutor on a weekly basis during the school year was regularly exchanged for a couple of lines of cocaine. every social, economic and relational card was already stacked against this young girl. now she will have unspeakable sexual wounds to deal with as well. it is during times like these that hope truly seems to "lay to waste your heart." how can i hold onto hope in a world where the fatherless are left undefended, the value of ethnic groups is determined by their access to natural resources and the church often treats the gospel as merely another commodity that will increase it's quality of life? the tension between hope and reality is tearing me apart.   Lord, i am weary. i feel like i have given my life to you, but have produced relatively little fruit. i am finding it exceedingly difficult to hold onto hope, in the midst of this horrible reality. yet, you are still my shepherd and i am still your sheep. when i wander into the thicket of despair, guide me back toward hope. in times like these, when my legs are giving out, lead me into green pastures and beside still waters and so restore my soul.
