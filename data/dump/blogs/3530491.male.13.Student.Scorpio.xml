      Hola! Today's pretty so-so (comme ci comme ça, as we say in French), because of all the events going on. Let me do a good /bad analysis: It's Friday / good, I have a piano recital rehearsal / bad, Neil gave me this cool mod which I talked about before "The Specialists" / good, school ends in like 14 days / really good, got  yearbooks today / good, my social studies teacher, who I will not give away the name of until I'm out of 7th grade, is coming back from Washington D.C. on Monday / really bad (just thinking about that could ruin my weekend, and my fellow classmates and I have thoroughly enjoyed our hiatus from her). Oh, well. I don't want to go to this recital or rehearsal, because for some unknown reason, my recital song deteriorated while I kept practicing (kind of ironic, don't you think?). Fred is performing his play tonight, I think I'll go see it if my parents don't have anything planned. Oh, and before I forget,  urlLink here  is a link to  urlLink homestarrunner.com , because it's awesome.

      Today was howdely-doodely fine. I learned a bunch of Calculus stuff last night (yes, I am fully aware of the fact that I'm in 7th grade). I also found out that Michael Moore's film Fahrenheit 9/11  will  be released in the US on June 25. Yay. He's a cool person, with a thing for documentaries uncovering social disputes among the American foundation. Did I mention he's cool? Anyway, in my science class, we watched "The Private Life of Plants" by David Attenbourgh. In it, a few of the plants it showed used their flowers to transport pollen by making the flower look like a female bee. Male bees would try to mate with the flower, and somewhere along the way the pollen got on the bee. The video also said that if a male bee is already trying to mate with the "female", another male bee will sometimes try to mate with the first male bee that's trying to mate with the flower. What would best describe that? Weird? Sick? Perverted? Disgusting? You tell me. I just think plants shouldn't use their sex "appeal" to lure pollenators. Sounds kind of creepy if you ask me. Oh, and here is  a WASL rough draft that I kept (because it was funny). It's the pictures up above. Sorry for the bad hand writing (you also will need to zoom in on the picture to make out the words, and you'll have to save and manually zoom in to see very clearly). Oh, and The specialists mod for Half-Life is awesome. Ch-Check It Out.

      Well, who do we have here? A person? Surfing the web? And came across a blog? Good for you. Anyway, this blog is by the staff members of the  urlLink Gopher's Herald . It represents our journals (if and when we chose to publish our personal lives), thoughts and insights, or just crazy things we found on our road trip on the Information Superhighway. I, if you're wondering, am the guy who is in charge of this site (to be a techie, I'm the admin. To be a super techie, I'm the root). I am also the editor-in-chief of the  urlLink Gopher's Herald , and will probably be the one posting most of the time, since my other staff members at the moment (aka Fred) might not choose to publish anything. Ok, well, that's that. Yeah. You can go now.

      I want to be quick: went to go see Harry Potter on Sunday. It was a good movie 7/10. Anyway, on the way to the movie theater, we stopped at the drive-through of a downtown McDonald's. We were waiting for about 10 minutes while the guy at the last window was just sitting there. Finally, the cars start to move, and when we get to the window, they give us our food and 2 free meal coupons because the car ahead of us (the one before the one at the last window)was trying to use counterfeit money. The guy in the car at the last window was nice enough to wait there, thus boxing in the counterfeiting car. They also gave us our order for free (take note that I'm far from poor), which is nice. On the way towards the movie theater, while I'm handing everyone their orders, I realize something: They forgot a straw with my drink. Eh, figures.

      My piano recital went well. I didn't mess up, so I'm really happy. After the recital my family went to an auction for a preschool my brother and I went to. I had a good time, and I ate a lot of pasta and desert, not a well-balanced diet. Now, that enjoyment I had last night (today is Sunday) was kind balanced by me getting a mild case of diarrhea. That's okay, it isn't terrible, it's just annoying, though now I have a reason to hate case and effect. Also,  today I finished recording my Band Final songs and everything, and I put together a huge Player's Choice package (part of the Band Final). It has a bunch of songs, all of which are awesome. Oh, and Ronald Reagan died yesterday. I'd be sad, except I wasn't alive during his presidency. Weird though, he was an actor, but he spent the last decade fighting Alzhiemers disease. Ah, well. You win some, you lose some.

      Okay. I will admit it. I am addicted to the new Beastie Boys' song, "Ch-Check It Out". Mainly because the music video was so awesome. My dad gave me a 7th grade graduation present early (I saw the other one, too, a new optical mouse, but I have decided to wait till tomorrow to open it and use it. Kind of a ceremonial thing), a hip-hop CD, because I wanted to have a version of "U Can't Touch This (Hammertime)" to listen to (note: I was just interested in it; I DID NOT pressure my dad into getting me it. Honest. I'm not a spoiled  brat . I am spoiled, though.). The CD also had "Ice Ice Baby", "Baby Got Back", and "Whoomp There It Is". That'll keep me busy. Oh, yeah. While I was looking for "Hotel California" on iTunes, so I could preview it (I don't have an iTunes account), I found William Hung's rendition of "Hotel California", along with other songs, like "YMCA", "I Believe I can Fly", and of course "She Bangs", on his CD "Inspiration". Is it just me, or is William Hung the world's biggest practical joke? Why the heck would  anyone  give him a record deal, or put him on magazine cover after magazine cover, if not so the whole American public and ultimately the whole entire world could laugh at William Hung behind his back for not having  any  talent  what so ever ? Yes, I know I'm late to jump on the William Hung bandwagon, but don't you agree? This guy ... absolutely ... positively ... completely sucks. At everything. He can't sing, let alone hold a note without going horridly out of tune. He definitely can't dance, and he certainly isn't worthy of a record deal, unless this is a practical joke on the media's  part. If it is so that it is a practical joke, and it pretty much has to be, I think we all need to give the mainstream media some applause, don't you think? Getting back to current day events... President Bush is visiting Fort Lewis, WA for Thursday (today) and Friday. This is weird, because ol' Dubya is visiting a place like 4 miles from me (Tacoma, WA), and traffic from Tacoma to Olympia is going to be clogged because that Monkey is coming to my area. Darned. Oh, today is the last full day of school. Tomorrow I get out at 11:10 AM, and then I'll be an 8th grader! Yay? Yeah. YAY! As celebration, we sat in the gym 5th and 6th period (last 2 periods) for "Activity Day" (that's field day, accept they put us in the gym, even though we have a PERFECTLY GOOD FIELD!!!)(AND THE FIELD IS NEW!!! THE SCHOOL IS 1 YEAR OLD AND IS IN THE BEST PART OF TACOMA!!! YOU KNOW, THE UPPER MIDDLE CLASS NORTH END WHERE EVERYONE IS HAPPY AND CRIME IS ONLY PETTY, AND OF WHICH OCCURS ONLY AT NIGHT!!! WHERE THERE IS NO CHANCE OF BAD THINGS HAPPENING ON A MIDDLE SCHOOL FIELD THAT IS COMPOSED OF ASTROTURF!!!)(DID I MENTION THAT THERE IS  NO  REASON NOT TO HAVE IT ON THE FIELD?!?!? IT WAS GOOD WEATHER, TOO!!!! 85 DEGREES!!! NOT A CLOUD IN SIGHT!!! A SLIGHT BREEZE!!!)(Ugh...)  There was a Teacher vs. Student basketball game, which was exciting and fun to watch, and some wacky games some students participated in. Oh, well. Because of this, we didn't have anytime for a vocab. quiz in 6th period (only 10 minutes left in it), and there'll be no time tomorrow, because all of the periods are shortened for the last day of school.  OMG  (Yes, I'm aware that sounded an awful lot like a girl; let me assure you, this is a time when that expression has to be used. I usually use it when it MUST me used. You understand.),tomorrow is the last day of school!!! w00t! (that means  YAY!  in gamer talk). Okay, I have nothing more to say. You can begin to gather back what remaining attention you have. Go, on... SHOO!

      I, Dairymancooltothemax, have joined the dynasty that is the Gopher's Herald.  As you may or may not know, I am the editor and founder of the Pretty Much Daily News, which (in my opinion) caused Owen to create this online newspaper.  I will contribute articles (and pictures) to the Gopher's Herald.  I will also occasionally post stuff on the blog.  Ah, but I am getting carried away. The real reason I have posted this letter is because I'm bored.  Oh, and I'll send you an email, Owen, of some articles sometime soon.  If you have not heard of my webpage, which is easily one of the most influential webpages of the 21st century (and, most likely the 20th century), you may visit it  urlLink here .

      This is the last week of school for Fred and I. We get out on the 18th of June, which is good. Soon, I'll be an 8th grader, and I'll finally be able to be free of the devil in disguise, my Social Studies Teacher. I'll give out her name on Friday, along with some thoughts about her. Anyway, my new flash movie  will  be included in the new revamped Gopher's Herald on Wednesday. The WHOLE site will change, because I not only am tired of the layout and old stories, the layout right now sucks. Period. Also, I might be able to recruit another person into the GH. Maybe. Yeah. Oh, and go to  urlLink albinoblacksheep.com ,  urlLink ebaumsworld.com , and  urlLink homestarrunner.com , and definitely  urlLink thegh.tk , 'cause they're cool. Yeah. Totally.

      Okay, first off, let's all give a round of applause to Fred for posting something! Maybe, if Max jumps on the bandwagon, we can have a roarin' good time. Anyhow, I released the Flash movie yesterday, so yall can go over to  urlLink our website  now and check it out. Fred says he'll make a weird Kid Pix Slide Show, so I'll look forward to that. As you can tell I'm still in love with Monty Python, because Monty Python is awesome. And now for something completely different: I really want to go see Fahrenheit 9/11 today or sometime soon. Yeah. Oh, and I'm going to lay off making Flash movies for a while. I think I need a little vacation from it, though I will be writing some comedy material and sending it to the Late Night with Conan O'Brian writers for a response, some tips, and just laughs on my part. Yeah. Until later, Asta La Vista, Baby.

      Hello one! Hello all! It has recently come to my attention that I haven't exactly been paying too much attention to the blog but I've been busy. Today is thursday and I headr Owen's dad was on the news! AWESOME! In Owen's language, YAY! Last Sunday I went to some dumb concert. It had the world premiere of this one guy's fourth symphony. It was pretty darn crappy. Hammertime is a better song then that, and that is sayin' something. Monday, I have no idea what I did (nor does my brother). Tuesday, uuh I forgot that too. But I know exactly what I did yesterday!! Hah! Beat that Owen! Now I remember what I did on tuesday. I had an orthodontist appointment. For the idiots, that means some wacko people messed around with my braces. And yes, I do look sexy in braces. anyway I get to get them off October 14. SWEET!!! Anyway, yesterday I pretty much babysitted the whole day. Here's what I did. First my brother, my mom, and I all walked down to my little soon to be first grader friend Ryan. He's pretty cool, untill you spend a whole day with him. We came back to our house and on the way I ran into some girls I know in the park. I hate Ryan! Especially for that! He's always blowing my chances with girls! Oh well, I like someone else anyway. Anyway we went to my house where we got out a marble track and started playing with that. That was fun for a while untill it got really boring. Then we went to lunch at subway. That was good, I ate their teriyaki chicken, which is my personnal favorite. Then we went to the bowling alley which was fun, but since I have a really nasty blister on my right thumb, I had to bowl left-handed. (I'm right handed if you are too dumb to figure that out). I got an 89 which is pretty good left handed. We did have the bumpers up though, for Ryan, so, there weren't any gutter balls. Then we went to the library and I got a book Owen's dad thought I should read called timeline. I haven't read it yet though. Then we went home and played marbles for a little while. After that we went to Bob The Builder.com. (That site will be the death of me). We played every game, all really dumb and super easy. After that, we played fooseball which I tried to let Ryan win by hitting it into my own goal. I kept winning though. After that we came downstairs and played with lego. I started building a base which is really cool. It has wheels so it can move. And then he left. Finally! So we come to today in which all i've done is spent 45 minutes on this stupid blog, (I can't believe I'm doing this just for Owen.) Well that pretty much says everything about my weekend. Er, summer. Whatever. Doesn't matter. AS LONG AS THERE IS NO SCHOOL!!!!!!!!! YES!! Well I would love to stay and chat but, I have a life unlike Owen and Don't spend all my time wacthing T.V. and playing computer. I only spend most of my time doing those things. Haha. Any way, as a clossing remark, if aanyone actually has the patience to read all this, Owen has the worst, and I mean the worst, grammer in the world. Like in one entry, he wrote something like, "This CD has everything accept Hammertime." It is supposed to be, "Has everying except hammertime." Who actually listens to Hammertime anyway? I sure as hell don't. But for now I will bid you all adieu! 		Everyones 				favorite 				blogger, 				Fred≥

      Okay, my Dad got interviewed by KING 5 News (that's Western Washington's NBC affiliate) about a space probe entering Saturn's atmosphere and about how it's going to study Saturn for 4 years. But man, those KING 5 people: they started the whole session off by with my dad saying, "I'll be glued to the internet." Oy vey. Then they had shots of him looking through the University of Puget Sound's observational telescope, which looked corny. OY VEY. To top it off, they referred to my dad as "Instructor Bates". OYY VEYYY. But my dad still got on TV, which is awesome, so OMG to that. Now for THE  OMG , I got an e-mail from Neil today! (Neil is in Europe for around 3 weeks).  If this is Max or Fred, I've already sent you guys the message. I'll post a scan of a print soon. One more OMG, the Flash movie should be done, published, and all that Jazz by Friday. Keep an eye out for it. Syonara.

      Okay, okay. A lot of things have happened since the last time I updated. 1st,  I GRADUATED FROM 7TH GRADE! (I knew I was going to, but I'm glad I'm out of school). Max and Fred did, too, but I didn't include them in the bold print because THEY NEVER UPDATE THE BLOG! *hint* *hint*. Anyway, I am going to reveal the name of my social studies teacher that I really hate (you'd know this from looking at my previous blog  urlLink here ) Without any further adieu, Mrs. --- really is Mrs. O'Malley-Hicks! Yes, I said that right! Marilyn O'Malley-Hicks! Truth be told, though, she really is a nice person, and her heart is in the right place, but I think it would be best to point out that: A) Mrs. O'Malley gives out 'social studies' assignments that turn out to either be busywork, artistic assignments, or 1/2 of your grade, B) She turned two of my classmates, Stacie and Elena, into unofficial TA's, making them do all of the work the SHE should be doing (the students are not the teachers), C) She never accurately informed us of deadlines for projects, or even more importantly, if there  were  any projects assigned, D) She spent so much time yakking and handing out 'creative assignments' (artistic assignments that have almost no guidelines or parameters, yet if not exactly the manifestation of her idea of the perfect rendering of the project, were way of course and were not listened to directions [what directions?]) that the class learned absolutely nothing, and if we did, it wasn't interesting, and E) She is a complete and total loon. She too patriotic for her own good, and she cares too much about people (don't get me wrong: caring about the homeless is a nice thing to do, but at the rate she was going over to the homeless shelter, they were probably barring her from going over there any longer). During the summer, I didn't want Social Studies, because I knew it would be boring (I didn't know who my teacher was, however), but I said to myself, "Hey, at least we can look forward to learning and Europe (part of the 7th grade Social Studies curriculum) (I think Europe is really cool)". But, Mrs. O'Malley spends 170 out of the 180 school days jabbering on about the Middle East, Asia, and Oceania. When Mrs. O'Malley promises that she'll give us Europe near the end of school, it just happens to slip her mind (and she said it right before we neared the end of school) and  we go off into 8th grade without any learned material about Europe, which some High School teacher is bound to give us a first week of school pop quiz on. Darn. I really hate what Mrs. O'Malley did. Oy vey. Anyway, I saw "The Stepford Wives" with Josh and Cam, on Tuesday (6/22). Man, that was FUNNY. Seriously, they purposefully made the movie into a comedy, and they did a fine job of it. If you haven't seen it, SEE IT. Oh, yeah, on Tuesday I started a new Flash movie, which I hope to have done on tomorrow (Thursday) or on Friday. It's really funny, and it's called "The Chair of Doom". That's all I'm going to say. Actually, I'll give you one more tidbit: It's using a lot of jpegs. Not one more word about it, my mouth is shut. Okay, back to the real world: I'm going to try out for the Youth Orchestra when they hold auditions in later this summer. I'm going to play "Menuet from Divertimento in D, K.334" by Mozart (the good one, W.A.)(yes, it  is  spelled Menuet this time around). It is a great piece, the trio is a little bit hard, but I think I can nail it with a few weeks of practice (trio as in musically, not with 3 players). Piano is good; I'm playing a Bach prelude. Tenor is fine as always. And now for something completely different. Yes, I meant to take that from Monty Python's Flying Circus. I'm watching more of Monty Python now. Also, talking about sketch comedy, I'm watching some of the SCTV DVD's my Dad got for father's day. Those are great, too. I'm surrounded by comedic masterpieces. By the way, if you don't know what SCTV is, look it up: it was one of  the  best sketch comedy shows ever, so Google it. If you don't know what either of them are, you've either been under a rock for the last 30 years or you've just broken out of the loony bin. Hey, get back in there and take your medicine.  Talking about lines with "take your medicine" I just finished "The Shining" by Stephen King, and now I want to see the movie with Jack Nicholson (I know the book and movie are vastly different, but still). Now, I'm reading "Catch-22" by Joseph Heller. Great book with lots of cynicism, sarcasm, and just dark comedy. Great book. Read it. Or else. Muwahahahahahahahahahahaha.   P.S. If either Fred or Max are reading this and they didn't catch on to the 'subtle' hint at the beginning,  please   POST MORE OFTEN TO THE BLOG!!!  I am not concerned about the website ( urlLink thegh.tk ), but rather the blog. Please post. Once you get the hang of it, you can make the posts into entire novels, like I do all the time. Hey, it's fun, but don't try it at home, kids ;)! Until later, I'm outa here!

      Okay, It obviously seems that Max and I are in a little "duel" over spelling and punctuation. I have the ultimate remedy: Max and I will post a comment on every post the other one does, and we will count (AND LIST!) the other one's spelling and punctuation mistakes. So Max, What do you think about that?!? (please comment yes or no)

      Today's a beauty, eh? How a-boot some boot-ing, eh? Agh! Sorry about that, folks, but as my previous post said, I've been in Whistler, B.C. for the weekend. Anyway, I have to say, if your a well-off person, Whistler in the summer is the place for you, and if you're a rich person, Whistler in the winter is the place for you. Let me elaborate: Our suite cost $200 a night for our stay in the Pan-Pacific Lodge; that same suite in the winter would have cost $800 a night! (though we have to take into account $1 CAN is equal to $0.76). Anyway, I'm sorry this is getting posted so late. I won't be able to post anything next week (neither will Fred or Max) because we're going to Camp Burton. Oh, yeah... back to Canada. While I was relaxing in the hot tub and later the steam room, I met these kids from Belgium who were on holiday in B.C. Belgium people are cool. That's all I have to say. On the way back from Whistler, I read a bunch of Stephen King short stories, like "Children of the Corn", "The Last Rung of the Ladder", and, "The Man Who Loved Flowers". One word describes both Stephen King and the stories: weird. Well, that's all for now. Until later, au revoir.

       Hello, there! I know what you're thinking. You're probably thinking this is a pretty cool looking font! Yeah! I guesss Blogger got updated. Anyhow... We're back from Burton Music Camp. It was pretty cool. I got into AM Band (yes!) and I also got to preform in Full Orchestra (YES!!!). I'm practacing again, this time for my clarinet audition in Youth Symphony. Oh, yeah, back to Burton. A lot of people I knew from school were there, such as:        Fred     Josh     Max     Xavier     Emma     Elana     Jen      Laura            ask Fred about her ;)         Hallie       Cailyn       Ava        and                 Andy.         We had a pretty fun time at camp. Our counselors were cool (note: Xavier, Max, and Andy were in a different cabin than Josh Fred and I, though their counselors were pretty cool, too). One, Keith, had Perfect pitch, was the Choir piano accompanist, and was from Philidelphia (he's going to Temple University). Keith also really liked Douglas Adams's "Hitchhikers Series", so now I'm hooked (I'm 1/4 pf the way through the third installment "Life, The Universe, and Everything". REALLY funny stuff. So were the storires he told us of High School misfortunes. Oh, and Keith walked all around camp with his iPod, which is cool. He also taught us that "Poisoning Pigeons in the Park" song. Oh, yeah. Our other counselor, Derek, was on Fred, Josh, and I's side of the cabin. Cool guy. Nice guy. Yeah. Made new friends and camp (Monica). Saw some     interesting       people (2 Goth friends: One's 'name' was Ghost, the other one's was Shade. Turns out Ghost's original name is like Alysia. Who woulda know? During carribean night [Friday] they both had Steel Band workshops so we got to see them preform. After finding out the first one, Ghost's, name after she had done a solo [in minor, oddly enough], we tried to guess what the other's name might be. Darkness? Crow? No. Shade. Huh.). Ran into previous and familiar counselors. All in all, it was a pretty fun week (July 11 - 18). Much better than last year (last year was my 2nd year). I also played in a wind quintet with 8 people ( I was clarinet, Jen and Elana were flute, Max was French Horn, Monica was French Horn, Ava was Oboe, and I can't remember the other 2 poeple. Um... Well, that was camp. Neil came back from Europe and suprised us at the concert. Yeah. Moving on... I've taken a new intrest in C++ again. And Flash is going well. Oh, I had to get a Plantronics around-the-head headset because somehow the left speaker on my really nice Plantronics broke while I was away at camp. Oh well. My ears'll stop screaming at me eventually (not the most comftorable thing invented)   . Well, that's it. See ya.

       Well, Living in Western Washington has been pretty miserable lately, due to the intense heat we've been getting the last 2 days. Oh, well, we all survived. It's starting to cool down. On a completely unrelated note: They Might Be Giants is the most awesome band ever. Go to their  urlLink site  and check them out. Now for something completely different:  urlLink Open Office  ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's so cool. Think of it this way: Take Microsoft Office (which is okay) multiply it by 10, add billions of cool features and usability, plus, THE ABILITY TO SAVE THINGS AS PDF FILES FOR FREE, and you've got the best thing ever to come out of open source programming since Linux! YAY! It's fun to subvert Adobe and Microsoft in one sitting (though I do have to say, when you compare Win 98 to to Win XP, Win XP is really much more stable since they used NT technology instead of MS-DOS technology (I very rarely have the problem of the computer freezing, and I haven't had any Fatal Error messages or Blue Screens of Death yet.) So, kudos to that.). Anyway, that's that. Oh, and before I forget: I've become a trial member of a clan! Yeah. I've become a trial member of the Desert Combat clan  urlLink Rebel Resistance  (their symbol is -)RR(- for all of y'all), which means that I get to wear their clan tag for 30 days while they check me out (they've already said that I'm really good despite my age, so'll they'll probably take me in.), but I don't get to play in any TWL matches or scrims (well, I expected that.). So, I'm really happy. That's it. Wait... No it isn't. I've read a lot of Douglas Adam's Hitchhikers Series (I'm on the 4th book, "So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish"). I'm probably going to finish it and "Catch-22" when I go to the beach from the 26th of July to the 30th of July. That means you'll have to pray that Max and Fred start posting again while I'm gone *hint* *hint*. See ya later in the week. Yeah... Bye.

       Yo. I'm sorry for being a werido and not updating. Um... I went to the beach for 5 days. I'm writing screenplays. I'm going to audition for Youth Symphony. Um... I really want the following CD's lately...     Beastie Boys : To The 5 Boroughs (note: got it recently)   Soundtrack : Kill Bill Vol. 1   Soundtrack : Kill Bill Vol. 2   Soundtrack : The Bourne Supremacy  I'm listening to "To The 5 Boroughs" right now, praticularly "Ch-Check It Out". Yeah. I'm doing well as a trial member of -)RR(-. Yeah. Oh, something that  actually  that has to do with the GH: I'm seriously thinking about turning it into a printed paper. Lots of stuff has to get sorted out between all of us, especially if we're gonna recruit some people to make it easier, and if it's gonna be weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly. (I personally would like to do it bi-weekly.) Um... Yeah. I gotta go. Oh, and Fred's gonna be gone a while, and Max is still in Minnesota I think. Yeah. Well, see ya. Or contact me. Yeah. Au revoir.

Look at these awesome flash movies other people made:       urlLink Robots Are Our Friends       urlLink Ducks Live On The Moon     Both are curtesy of albinoblacksheep.com and their respective authors. Yeah... see ya.
