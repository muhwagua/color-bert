      I figured out why my blog was a bit screwy yesterday.  Blogger just updated I think.  I actually sort of miss the old version of blogger they had when I first joined.  Waive is a great indies band and I'm still having trouble finding rice's songs.  Hmm, there isn't too much to say for today.  I wonder what the date is.  Point Premium root beer is the best thing since kalamata olives.

      Remember the list of random moments from my last blog? (probably not...) I'm taking the best ones and posting 'em here.   34. When I forgot there was a ceiling and... (>. 38. When I kept on walking around in circles in the kitchen and did "the stupid look" out the window as I walked. (another self-inside joke) 26. When the plate attacked Laura (muahaha! good plate, you've learned well from the master)  13.when I had that dream where I became the vampire bride of Klaha 5.when I heard my first Malice Mizer song   I've made a resolution to stop using so many emoticon things like ^^ and T_T.  *shrugs* I'm just starting to find it annoying and I bet that other people feel the same way. I will still use XD, ó.Õ, and e.e because....well just because I like those ones.

        You're a PACKAGE MASTER!    urlLink   Are You a JRock Package Master?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     LMAO!!!!!!   "OOO Look! It's Mana's crotch! I'm brilliant!" - Chelsea  Actually, for a lot of the crotch quiz I used my spidey sense to guess and didn't actually know whose crotch it was.    Aww, phooey, who am I kidding? I don't even have a spidey sense, and I did know most of those, and I don't know whether to be proud or ashamed. XD

      Our vocabulary workshop book has a reference to  Interview With the Vampire  in it!!!!! Isn't that just so cool!?   I'm so glad I have a mom that is as much of a geek as I am.  She was telling me about how at work she had a patient whose name was Aragorn.  Yes, ARAGORN! As in LotR!  That's not the least of it, though.  Apparently this Aragorn didn't show up for his appointment so my mom said in a joking way "I guess the king didn't return!"  XD That's just too funny!

      RANDOM OUTBURST! (so just ignore it if you want)       As incredible sappy as it sounds, I fell in love with Klaha's voice first. The first time I heard Beast of Blood(also my first MM song besides first Klaha song) during the intro part with just Klaha and the harpsichord, I remember thinking "I don't care whether whoever sings this is ugly as hell or has a bad personality, I love him."  Hehe, it turned out he was VERY handsome anyways, but I haven't met him so I don't know what he is like(;_;).       His new stuff may not be as good as Malice Mizer(BUT WHO KNOWS ABOUT SETSUBA?!?!n.n), but his voice still is wonderful.  He just doesn't live up to his potential like he does is "Beast of Blood" and especially "Seinaru Koku(Toki) Eien no Inori."  Just yesterday I was listening to "Gardenia," and I just thought how perfect his voice he was for that too.  His rapid vibrato during "Gardenia" just makes the whole song sound intirely sweeter and pure.       This was just to get it out of my system, and to keep up my hopes for Setsuba! n.n   By the way, I guess I am going to use little emoticons again, but not as many in case it annoys others. So n.n, -_-#, e.e, XD, and o_O make their way back into my typing.

      Another March thing: new glasses   I NEED to be in Dallas, TX on June 4-6.  Miyavi is playing at a-kon.  Yes, MIYAVI, only the creator of my SECOND FAVORITE music in the world.  Yep, he's up there right after Malice Mizer.  And my god, he's so gorgeous.  He's up there right after Klaha.  GAHHHHHH, my parents would NEVER go to Texas just for an anime convention.  Especially not after buying my tickets to the figure skating.

      It downloaded.  You should know what I'm talking about.  Beast of Blood remix.  The one that I've been yearning to listen to for months, but each time I get in the queue my downloader signs off.   I think that it is just Beast of Blood played backwards, but I love it so much.   Oh yeah, and I found out that I won't be able to get my Klaha CD until at LEAST February 18th.  Ah well, at least I'll get it.  Just remember, patience is a virtue.

      This is the dream I had last night.  It was a LOT more detailed then how I describe it here.         I'm on vacation with my family in Utah and we've rented out this house sort of at the foot of a huge mountain.  We're just sort of walking around at night when the mountain top explodes and lava starts spewing everywhere! An inch of lava covers the floor of the house, but it doesn't melt anything and just goes away after a few minutes.  That's when I decide to leave and travel somewhere on my own.       The dream sort of goes foggy for a little bit here and it clears to reveal me in front of a HUGE treehouse surrounded by equally large slides and such.  I climb up into the treehouse and there is nothing in it except a picture of me as a child climbing on the same treehouse(only smaller).  I explored a little bit when I'm confronted by an old vampire guy.  It turns out that he had become obsessed with me ever since he first saw me when I saw little, and he hasn't drunk any blood for 10 years.  I'm supposed to become his vampire bride like in a lot of my dreams, but I don't want to marry him so he chases me around the huge playset.  Eventually I find myself cornered by him in a cave and he's about to drink my blood when I get transported to HFS.      I'm not safe here either.  He was supposed to take a tiny bit of my blood before I came here for Ms Van Dyke to put an incantation on me.  He, of course, didn't take my blood but Van Dyke doesn't know that so the idiot puts an incantation to kill my body on me anyways.  I realize I'm going to die so I lie down on a group of desks to wait for death.  The place I happened to be dying on was enchanted, so if anyone were to open my eyelids while I was there, I would live until midnight while they lay in death in my stead.  But if I didn't come back at midnight, we would both die completely and the enchantment would be lost.        While I sat there Naomi came up to me and started talking to me while my mind lived but my body died. Then I realized all the things I would never experience like my first kiss and getting my Klaha CD.  I started to cry and Naomi opened my eyelids so we exchanged death for life and life for death.  I snuck into Mrs Hayden's room and found a secret passage way to the Saphner twins and Brigid's rooms connected by closets.  I stole some clothes because suddenly I had none! I darted down the stairs to the library and all of my friends followed me for some reason.  We took some popcorn off a little Christmas tree Mrs Holl had and I woke up.    Isn't it strange that about 1/4 or even 1/2 of my dreams are about vampires? And me becoming their bride?  Oh well, they also happen to be my favorites so I'm not complaining.

      Jet Grind Radio music= addicting.  Oh, and I forgot something else that was pretty funny: "He's got CRONIES."  Lol, Lucky7 was hilarious.  Maybe he was lost or he thought he knew us.     I still can't wait for my CD!  It's sort of weird that I can instantly tell whether the Malice Mizer song playing is instrumental or not. I AM proud of myself, but it's freaky!

      All I have to say was that the ChaCha Slide face off was the funniest thing I have ever seen in my life.  Seriously.    Kroll's pretty muched sucked this time though.    Okay, that's all. WAIT! Except for this! I have gotten past the rebellious attitude against piano and have gotten to like playing again like when I was a child.  Thank you Stella.

      Perhaps we'll get a snow day tomorrow. Hey! Check it out! A popular American song I like! "My Immortal"  by Evanescence.  It's really pretty and has nice lyrics, but it still can't compare to Jrock. ;)  Chelsea and I are on the hunt for a new manga to read.  She thinking about getting Wild Act, and I'd like to check out Crescent Moon, Kiss Me Kill Me, Shirahime-Syo Snow Goddess, and Alice 19th.  I'm getting addicted to Yoplait Whips yogurt.  I wonder what scheme Mrs Smet is planning to do with our baby pictures.  I know it has something to do with the billboard(sadly, the Snapple board was taken down).  I need to watch Spirited Away, right now.  You know, I can't wait to find out how some of my friends are going to grow up like. But some people I just don't want to know because considering how they are now, they can't really get any worse.  Or maybe they can.  I just don't know.  Perhaps we'll get a snow day tomorrow.

      I forgot a crying song.  "Regret" - Malice Mizer    How in the world could I have possibly forgot this song? It's the most beautiful piano solo anyone could ask for.

      This post has a lot of random things that won't mean anything to anyone who reads it, so just ignore it if you want.  This doesn't seem like much, but I've been trying to download these two Malice Mizer remixes for quite literally MONTHS and they never download.  I manage to find the download and get to 6th in queue, but the person disconnects before I can ever get it.  This is really starting to piss me off.  Especially because one of the songs is Beast of Blood Inferno remix that I've never heard.  If only you knew how much I love Beast of Blood.   I am, for lack of a better word, "researching" EGL clothing.  I'm filling up a folder on my computer with pictures, articles, patterns, etc. for when I can sew them for myself.    I hate this "artificial perfection" that surrounds me in everything.   I don't have any idea why, but I have this crazy, but gloomy feeling I've been betrayed.  It's probably just one of those stupid things that's always in my head, or like the feeling you're being watched.

      I saw "Big Fish" last night and wow, that is one amazing movie.  Ewan was really great and I'm glad to see some more of Tim Burton's amazing imagination.  I cried at multiple points in the movie, but the ending was really tear-jerking.   And since I'm talking about crying I'm going to list all the songs that make me cry.  "Crucify my Love" - X Japan (I always feel really cold too)  "Transient" - Schwarz Stein (I always cry at the verse part. ;_; it's also playing right now) "Sakai no Chi to Bara" - Malice Mizer "Unmei no Deai" - Malice Mizer (beautiful Kami...) "Story" - Gackt

      Schwarz Stein: my new big craze.  They are a Japanese new wave/industrial band consisting of Hora on keyboards and Kaya on vocals.  Mana produces them under MidiNette and there are rumors that Kaya and Hora are Juka and Kazuno from Moi Dix Mois, Mana's new band.  I don't know about Hora and Kazuno, but I don't think that Kaya is Juka.  Anyways, they have released the album New Vogue Child and the singles Current and Perfect Garden.  I don't listen much to industrial, but Schwarz Stein is really talented and enjoyable to listen to.  From most reviews and stuff I've read, most people seem to like "Rise to Heaven" the best.  "Transient" is my personal favorite, but "Rise to Heaven" is definitely my second choice.

      And more about today...  The growling lady at the food court was hilarious, but I swear she was really scary when she growled at her pizza!  "Hot Topic" is now called "World of Friends!" and it's filled with happy Care Bear-riding rainbows and fun! XD  Why was the "How to Draw Manga Couples" book so funny? I like to smell shampoo.  Aveda flax seed strong hold hair spray is one of my new favorite smells.  Chelsea, Maggie, and I also broke a glass table at the Rocks' house because we were swordfighting with cardboard tubes.  I'm wearing a Malice Mizer t-shirt I made with iron on transfers right now.  It smells kind of funny.

XD  I know it sounds sort of stupid, but I am very into the whole world of fashion and style.  e.e  I really don't know, but I'm very passionate about my clothes, thankyouverymuch!   Noo, I can't wait for the next Paradise Kiss to come out in MARCH!!

I watched the AMG movie today, actually, but anyways.  I'm watching Iron Chef right now and the music they have is right from the AMG movie!!  It's so obvious!

      SETSUBA CAME!!! Sadly, Klaha didn't return to the darkness, but it's still wonderful!!!! I've stumbled across an AWESOME Gothic Lolita Bible website! And a hilarious Malice Mizer site.  The MM site had instructions on how to make a rubber band shooting chopstik gun, but I couldn't follow the directions so I made it into a slingshot. The same site also pointed out that there is a guy in the Illuminati video!! XD XD Hmm, it's been a boring day. Usually Saturday is my runaround with mom day, but she's in Las Vegas.  Dave is busy with the play and Dad is at work(but that's MUCH better than having him home to bug me about piano). I wonder what everyone else is doing. Iron Chef is on in five minutes.   Ho hum.

      Grarg, why is there nothing to blog about anymore?!  Well, I guess there ARE things I COULD blog about, but I'd rather not.   "Setsuba" still hasn't come yet.  I did have fun skipping up the street singing "We're off to see the Klaha!" to the tune of that song from Wizard of Oz.   Yay, Dave's play is this weekend and Chrissy is coming to see it! And I most certainly hope she tells us which movies she stole(you can keep Pirates, mom says we can get another because we know you won't give it back.  You're gonna have to give me back Labyrinth, though).  Dad just ordered a big order of different olives! The kalamatas we got on Sunday evening didn't last through Monday.  Once life gets interesting again, I promise I'll blog about more interesting things.

      There is really nothing to blog about.  I'm hoping my CD will come today.  I lost my charm bracelet somewhere and I have a couple charms from various places I have to put on it.  Yesterday the syringe charm came in the mail for me.  XD Yes, I have a syringe charm.  As I said previously, there's nothing to blog about so I'm going to go upstairs and look for the music to "Swanky Maximino" from Grim Fandango.

Ska isn't really my favorite music genre though.  I tend to have a habit of liking bands with music that's hard to catergorize.     Woo, it's been 30-35 degrees outside!

      Twas quite an interesting Valentine's Day I had.  A couple things we did(we being Chelsea, Maggie, Erik, me, and sort of Molly and Casey but not really): stole popcorn salt, played "Hot Noodle"(a variation of Hot Potato, snapped our fingers, SKOGGED, ate [too] many conversation hearts, saw a member of the NDA dance team fall over, floated, and watched the referees.  New song obsession(I have these a lot):  "Honey Vanity" - Kozi  It's a rather catchy and addicting song.  It's before and better than Eve of Destiny.  I love the way Kozi sort of talks instead of sings.   Another song obsession:  "Logos Naki World" - Hellsing opening song  An awesome song for an even better anime.  The shubidubidu shubidubidu part is the best.  I'm also trying to learn the piano part because I printed out the music from a midi in Cakewalk.

You should have stayed with your original plans, you English muffin-selling oatmeal on a safari that's supposed to be a bear!!!!!!!!!  Schwarz Stein has posted on their website that they are going to disband. "Artificial Hallucination" hasn't even come out yet... Why do they all decide to break up as soon as they really become great?!

      Okay, one last blog before I retire for the night.  This one's a movie review for "The Medallion" starring Jackie Chan and a bunch of nameless actors.  This is what the disease-infested cat with a stench of a thousand rancid cheetos topped with orange juice dragged in.  The plot and dialogue was terribly stupid.  The only attempt at humor was stupid innuendo that didn't quite make sense.  I guess I  could  give them points for originality, but the only reason there was anything original was that everything was too stupid for other B-rates to use.  There was something oddly Mortal Kombat-esque about "The Medallion," but without the ass-kicking-ness that IS Mortal Kombat.  But overall the most annoying part of the movie was the music.  They just decided to use some "cool" sounding cop music for the fight scenes and for everything else there was just a bunch of horns tooting and sounds synchronized with the characters' movements.  And for some reason a random tuba sound would just pop up in the middle of a serious conversation or fight scene or something.  There was ONE little part that I sort of liked and that was when Jackie got his leg speared to the floor by a giant spike thing.  Instead of removing the spike from the floor to release his leg, he just lifts his leg through the whole top of the spike(I can't really explain very well).

      Mehh, I feel all dizzy from reading for five hours straight.  And, yes, I know that I'm making a LOT of posts today, and, yes, I'm just doing it to piss off who ever reads this.  I'm not only addicted to the Hellsing anime(and I just went out and got the manga earlier, but I haven't gotten a chance to read it yet), but I'm also addicted to the opening theme song: "Logos Naki World."  The shubidubidu part is the best.  Ooh, I got an idea(and because I feel like pissing you people off again, I won't tell you what it is!)   XD

      I made a mistake in my last post.  It's "Rebirth Vol. 6" that I'm waiting for, and it already IS out! I really want to read the Hellsing manga.  I think it has a different storyline than the anime.  My current pointless project is writing down everything that the characters say during the anime previews at the end of each episode.  They don't make ANY sense! In one, the weird guy who isn't anywhere in the episodes talks about Alexander Anderson going to the parasite palace to pray...I think.  He sort of mumbles some stuff in that one.  urlLink  The Surrealist Compliment Generator  is highly amusing.  Here's some of the compliments I like:  Your hair sends forth a sheen remniscent of a wounded man streaming bandage gauze from the highest  church steeple.  You are a banana moon subverting the sun.  Woods nymphs sprinkle your path with bowlings balls while you dance and prowl in the sequined moonlight with leftover heads of lettuce  You look like someone who has lunched poorly and who has no expectations for dinner Your fingers staple pine nuts into everything you touch. ENGINEER YOUR AUNT! Do it! You will be grateful for having done so. Yolutsky promises to cease his diddling with your ears.

      Haha! We got a snow day today!!!! Yesterday was a really great day.  First we made up "dances" to remember the inventors and stuff for History.  I'm personally a fan of the original "Cyrus McCormick Mechanical Reaper" dance, myself.  Maggie and I got all A's for our "Princess Bride" skit at forensics yesterday.  "Rebirth vol. 5" comes out soon!  So does "Setsuba"!!!!!!!!! ~estatic~ "Artificial Hallucination" comes out February 25, but I might wait to buy it.  The same person on ebay who had "Setsuba" has "Artificial Hallucination," but they are selling it with a bunch of signed things that I don't want to waste my money on.

      nick: If you had matches... woah speaking of which I smell something burning.. but anyway.. If you could set one person on fire who would it be? me: myself, because then I could run up to other people and get THEM on fire too!!!  That's proof that I should just sign off AIM and lock myself in my room when I'm hyper. More reasons: I start violently snipping scissors to the beat of Moi Dix Mois, I spin around on the chair while making stupid faces at my brother, I violently chomp hard candy to the beat of Moi Dix Mois, I dance to Tsumi to Batsu like Kyo,  I make odd noises, I download Disney music.   I'm sure Nick has reallllllllyyy weird convos with me locked up in his data files.

      I'm going to post about the same chain letter as Chelsea.  "ess what? Valentine's Day is coming up! Send this message to 50 people before Valentine's Day, and your tru love will realize they like u. If u don't, u will be blown up by a proximity mine on Feb. 15. Happy sending, and no send backs."     Okay, yeah, it's kind of dumb about the true love from an IM, but a proximity mine?! What the heck? Anyways, this chain IM is pretty cool just for the proximity mine thing. Ahh, I have to go eat now, but I'll blog a bit later.

      I forgot to mention with my last post about Hellsing that when Ceras Victoria clutches Alucard's head, it reminded me EXACTLY of my dream where I clutched Kozi's dismembered head.  But that's not the only similarity.  Alucard's long hair at the end reminded me too much of Mana's body and hair in the blood in my dream.  Strange..

      I just finished watching the final episode of Hellsing.  I hope with all of my human heart that there is going to be a second season.  You know, it's weird.  Alucard really isn't that hot or handsome, but I find him irresistibly sexy.  And you know what else? I don't give a damn about what YOU think about that.  I think Alucard is sexy, and I don't care what you have to say about it.  Anyways, I can't believed that I cried at the end of it! Amidst the blood and gore, I still cried when I thought both Walter and Alucard died!! I almost cried for Fargason too, but I didn't cry until I saw Walter go down in the helicopter.  I was crying worse then Maggie at Big Fish(SERIOUSLY!!).  I can't believe that! You also should have heard me squeal when Walter pulled out his floss and Alucard re-materialized.

      Transient - Schwarz Stein  You gaze at your frosted breath  Aware the outlines of your scars have faded Along with the wilted flower petals  Though your kisses may have been playful They were drenched in the scent of suggested sin  If only you could have stopped his breath then With freezing fingers lovingly entwined  This is the scene woven  from your sad dreams  As your naïve vows are breaking and fluttering away  While you shiver as if you would disappear, the snow now dances round your clasped hands  Fleeting happiness and then Brought cruely to your senses You did nothing but Simply cursed your dry limbs  If I’m not allowed  to even love Then  force me beneath the snow with your own arms

      Golden Sun:The Lost Age has a lot of crazy and random Psynergies that would be otherwise useless.  The one spell that I really don't get is Lash.  Now, if this weren't a video game with nicely placed piles of rope and things to tie it to, Lash would be pretty unhelpful in any situation.  Why would there be such a Psynergy?  Moreover, who would use it?  As I pondered these questions I found the answer as to why Lash exists.  Monks.  Yes, those idiotic Poi monks are the only reason Lash makes the game more complicated.  But, what else would monks do with their spare time?

      Oh dear, last day of spring break.  It's been sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo boring and I just wanna go back to school.  Sort of.  Meh, less Lost Age time! ;_;  I love my Felix and Alex and Isaac and Ivan and Saturos and WAIT! SATUROS HAS SCALY ARMS EWWWWWW.  Just my Felix and Alex and Isaac and Ivan.  No Saturos. I like his hair though. And his shoes.  Nice shoes.  Augh, I'm fixing all of the file names of all of my mp3s; I only got half done yesterday. Hmmm, it is 12:46 and I'm thinking I should go upstairs and take a shower and have a nice glass of bubble tea(@~@!!)

My Golden Sun obsession is resurfacing.  xD Great game, I'm almost finished and I'll be replaying the 2nd one soon.  Muahahaha, this time the K-sword WILL be mine(hey, I already got the Prophet's Hat! muah, it killed that nasty lizard for me too).   Augh, my brother has had a The Tick comic book and I never knew!!  I'm trying to get my hands on a couple of the old TV episodes.  SPOON!  "The Passion" is a crappy movie.  Mel Gibson makes a better actor than director. Some people need to get Ben and Jerry's ice cream.  Kathy needs to get Ben and Jerry's ice cream.

      Back from South Carolina! It was boring, but, all-in-all, not too bad.  On the way to Madison last Saturday, my mom couldn't avoid hitting a boat seat in the middle of the road and it smashed the condenser in the van.  It was about time to get rid of the car anyway so we got a new Sienna today!  I'm going to order the Trigun series because it has to be the funniest anime in the world.  I love Vash!

It's not like Hellsing or Fruits Basket, both of which I can watch for hours and still see more the next day.  My favorite voice actor, Crispin Freeman, is in LE!!  I

I should be getting the two Hellsing soundtracks, Rain and Ruins, soon!!   I'm still puzzled by the fact that Erik has a skeleton on a surf board in his desk.

      Let me just say a couple things I'm pissed about:  Girls who think ALL men worship them Girls who are incredibly desperate and hit on any guy being tired people who lie just to inflate their ego more getting 54 damned banners made in less than a month humans, in general. I tend to dislike them quite a bit. when people on Ebay have incorrect info in the description or title    GRR, and that last one is just made me write the whole damned list of just a few things I can think of because I'm so damned tired.   A couple things that ALWAYS make me smile: Kozi Beast of Blood Klaha's opera voice POP is Dead Live Alucard moonlight  But again, there may or may not be others, but I'm too damned tired to think of them right now.

As was Cabaret Night at NDA. I just loved the "Farewell to Lothlorien!" I just finished my picture of Hora's keyboard. It sucks and I have something in my eye.  Man, the immaturity of some people just astounds me.  And I'm tired. Mrpha.

      Yay, to replace Miyavi at AnimeCentral, SID is coming! I haven't heard of anything by them except for the samples on the Acen website.  They do sound very good and enjoyable! The bassist looks like Manson(it said he likes his music too) and the vocalist is kinda cute! ;)  No no no! Not  beautiful  like you, Kaya.  No nonoonono! Not beautiful and handsome and elegant and charming and perfect like you, Klaha! Just cute, like Kyo over there.  *Kyo spews blood and some unidentified substance on the furniture, then eats a kitten*  Maybe not like Kyo either...

It was my own doujinshi that I scanned;I'm the Kathleen that gave it to her to translate.  n.n And I'm glad I did.  School bores me.  Lunch was fun today.  I hung out with Alison Laura Sam and Greg(COMMAS? WE DON'T NEED NO STINKIN' COMMAS!).  I found out that if you kick your ankle wearing certain shoes you will just topple over to the ground.

      But some of you...  >:(   One might think you just want to expand your gossip knowledge and backstab and do all kinds of media-instilled habits.   *glompu* Miyavi is such a lovable oaf.  The live version of "POP is dead" is so cute!  One part it just seems like he gets sidetracked or something, then at the end I can just see him saying the "Dirty pop..." part and smiling mischieviously.  Murp, you gotta know Miyavi to know what I'm talking about.  But, ehhh, Schwarz Stein is better.  Sorry, Miya, I stilll LOVE you, but I just love Schwarz Stein a little bit more.  *hug*   e.e  Someone who didn't know me and who wasn't familiar with my convos with my Jrockers would think that Miyavi was here with me now.  Damn...

Scare the people.  I like that video! Yu~ki gets to rip out someone's throat! And there is a guy fawning over Gackt in that one scene! xD    Why? Schwarz Stein's music is just starting to affect me like Malice Mizer's did, but in a Schwarz Steiny way.  Why did they have to break up?  I want to learn how to make better art and digital art and everything.

It's not like you're doing it because you really are a whore, and get yer jollies off doing stupid stunts like that!  >(   On a lighter note, I have one of the PS2 DDR games and I played it for a while last night and my mats are being sent on Monday! ^_^!!!!!!!!

      Ooh, the new Blogger is spiffilicious!! I went to visit my uncle and aunt in Georgia last weekend. It was nice;we went to a Renaissance Faire and Stone Mountain.  But more importantly, I found Dance Dance Revolution!! Tragically addictive! Insanely fun! Dashingly difficult! Woo.  I suck at it, but this is all about to change. I fully intend to hire my brother to take me to Best Buy in order to buy a PS2.  My mother strongly disapproves, but I don't care. It's not just for DDR;I also want Castlevania and Bujingai! Plus, there has to be countless other games.  And, sister, just in case you still read this, DON'T tell mom. ;D   Hmm, what else to blog about? I saw Van Helsing. I plan to see Troy and Spider-man 2.  S2 looks delightful and if it pulls an X-Men, it will be totally awesome considering that the first one was reaally good too.   School is wrapping up. -Certain- decorations have been making progress(and if you are one of a few people, all 50 are done).   I wish that humans had wheels instead of legs.

The power went out when we were on the swings and we had to be helped down.  We saw Mike and when the power went back on, his sister made the Scambler go faster than normal for us.  Then we devoured ice cream while we watched "Bridget Jones' Diary," which was entertaining. Highlight of the night: guy in line whom I fell in love with instantly. Okay, that's a little bit of an exaggeration, but I was /verryy/ attracted to him as soon as I saw him.  ;D Yep, I know I didn't tell you guys, but I don't feel the need to tell you about every guy that intrigues me. 'Specially because I know you'll embarass me.

      Though the same cannot be said for many(probably ANY) musicians these days, I think that Kozi has some musical genius. I cannot say the same for Mana, although he HAS done some very impressive work.  Kozi's music strikes me in a different way though I usually enjoy listening to Mana's more.    I need to blog more, post more stuff at DA, hang out with my friends more, go outside more.

      (^-^)V GREAT weekend aside from the sunburn. For various reasons... But we went down to Milwaukee for a Midwest Lacrosse championship that my brother was in! He played with people from Bayport(mostly) and NDA, along with three other SW guys. They got to the final championship game and lost 3 to 5.  But they not only regularly play with each other, but it was their first time competing in this! Plus they played Verona, who has been together for years and kick derriere.    Now I'm bored. And, FUCK, I have piano later.

      Eh, forget the getting over the hallucinations. It's still bad. I can deal with it though.   Summer is boring already. People annoy me already.(>_  Grrr, Bujingai: The Forsaken City doesn't come out until June 22!! That pisses me off!! A LOT! I rented a different game and found out that Family Video has Valkyrie Profile for me to rent as well, which is good. Very good.   Burnheimer's are coming this Thursday.   (>_>) I am weak. I bought another Malice Mizer doujinshi. This one looks really great though! And maybe Gwendel, the awesome wonder she is, will translate it for me! (^.^) I hope so...

      Okay, this is another one of my cryptic/only-I-know bloggings so please disregard and I'll post an understandable blog next. :D Sorry to anyone who reads, but these posts are how I vent and such.  I'm so glad that my aunt and uncle are gone;I couldn't stand having them here.  I should be more tolerant because they're my relatives, but they just constantly brush me in the wrong direction.  Tooo many times have I held my tongue in reply to something they've said that offends me or is just incorrect.    I finally got over the sorrow of the hallucinations.  Yeah, I probably will cry some more over the last, but at least I know that they are still happy, maybe even happier.   I had a dream last night that I still can't decide whether it was good or just creepy/sad.  In it, Malice Mizer got back together(good side)!! But everyone had fallen into strange habits and turned out as weirdos(bad side), and not the normal awesome weirdos, but creepy old men weirdos. Except for Klaha, but he got reeeeeeaally thin and CD sales were down.  Mana shaved half his head, didn't wear makeup, and had a really bad tan.  Yu~ki just got really chubby, but he still wore his top hats and capes.  And Kozi got HUGE Manson lips and wore a blonde wig. After I woke up once and fell asleep again they were back to normal(good side)!!! They were having a show a little bit down the road from where I lived(good side), but it was raining and stupid people who don't know who they are came(bad side) and I forgot a camera(bad side).  It turns out that I became their faku-chan(I'm still deciding whether this is good or bad, but they were normal then so I'm thinking maybe good...? O:) ) But I guess they liked me so much I became their good friend(great side)! Then Klaha sang a song he never released and I cried because it was so pretty, then I woke up and was seriously pissed off.  Eh, it was a good dream.  (*^-^*) But since then I've gotten into a really bad Mizer mood and I feel like I will die without them. And I'm really frightened that someday I'll find a band I like better, or I just won't like their music anymore. Yet I know that change is inevitable, and one of those things WILL happen. I'd rather die than forget Malice Mizer or find someone better.  Ah, I couldn't find anyone better because there is no one.  And there never was and there never will be.

ROCK ON, MANA!&nbsp;&nbsp; I have Oresama, Miyavi's movie! It's SO cute! He looks at a soccer ball in one part and runs up to it and puts his hands in front of it right before getting tricksy with it.&nbsp; He's got some skills! If it's really him that is.&nbsp; I think it is.&nbsp; My keyboard has&nbsp;a sticker saying SMASH on the spacebar so it's fun to say smash everytime you hit it.&nbsp;  Chomp on, readers.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whoa! I had a dream last night that started out totally awesome, turned scary as hell, then totally awesome again!!&nbsp; My class got selected for the Battle Royale program!! And Kiriyama was thrown in there to make sure we were killing each other.&nbsp;&nbsp; That made me  very  happy and I got to sit by him on the pavement!! (*^_^*)&nbsp; Then Blaze And Kristina S came over and were doing this incredibly stupid/immature music thing and Kiriyama killed them to make them shut up.&nbsp; So we were thrown onto this island with a big house right in front of us, but they didn't give us any weapons or food and you couldn't see anything except for maybe one person in front of you(i.e. your killer)!&nbsp; Though somehow Rachel M got ahold of a knife and almost stabbed me and I stole Leagh's cuticle scissors.&nbsp; Maggie and I were running around together because we agreed that we couldn't trust anyone else.&nbsp; I accidently poisoned Vicky.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Maggie and I got separated and god knows what happened to her.&nbsp; But I found myself a powerful pencil shooter!&nbsp;Natalie and Tara were trying to nurse a gash in Matt S's arm, but I shot him in the neck with a couple pencils, then shot them a few times, but I ran out of pencils before they were dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then everyone's parents showed up, except for mine and Kiriyama's so I found an uzi in the grass and shot them all.&nbsp; Except for Kiriyama.

      I deleted the last post because it took up WAY too much space! And in the "If I..." quiz I missed the element one so "if I were an element I would be ice" and&nbsp;I just said sour for the fruit because I wanted to and couldn't think of a good fruit, I think it actually does mean to put an actual fruit not how it tastes.&nbsp; I just wanted to say because I'm not sure if others were aware. (^^;) sorry bout that.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm gonna go steal the little black pirate ship in the harbor now!

      I wanna keep these:  there once was a small green pond, who was a huge fan of James Bond the pond bought a gun and had tons of fun but blasted himself to beyond.  there once was a tiny green hat, who was friendless aside from a gnat they jumped to the moon and found a racoon who killed them in deadly combat  there once was a teeny green sack who lived in a shoddy brown shack he had a long beard he was pretty weird and died from drugs such as smack

      More proof Gackt is quite the idiot: papa lapped a pap lopped. Are you an American, and do you understand it? I sure don't! But Gackt seems to think that Americans could be able to understand it! Yeah, the lyrics for the song make sense for him...(-_-;;)(;;-_-)  And actually, I have a guess for it, but I won't say it because it goes right along with those lyrics...

      7:32 in the morning, Thursday, June 31st  Day after Spiderman premiere! My brother went to see it at the midnight showing. I went swimming yesterday. It was fun aside from the crappy little cookies I felt obligated to eat(except when they had salsa on them). That one cookie only looked perfect. Sorry, I'm in a super-bitch mode right now because I'm leaving to go to Atlanta soon and I HATE my left eyebrow.  hatehate hate hatehate!  All of the hairs go in different directions! (-_-;) Sorry, dear readers.
