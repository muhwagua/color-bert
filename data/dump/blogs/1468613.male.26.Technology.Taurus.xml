      Well, welcome to your new world! Melbourne is lovely - sitting in the sun drinking red wine and eating fresh pasta bought on Lygon st - gealous yet!  Oh ok - just because you get free wine, movies, yummy food and an armchair! Missing you already - fly well and get your scarf ready for Glasgow. Love Kai

      Hi guys!  Caz, don't you mean cinnamonamin? :o) LOL  Currently I'm up in the Qantas Club composing this... I have to say... flying has never been this cool!  Well just arrived in Sydney after having salmon with some Japanese dressing I couldn't pronounce...   My Gawd... I've nevers seen so much jewlery in my life on just one person! There was a rather orange lady sitting in front of me wearing quite exquisite and obviously expensive clothes. When she got up, I saw the largest watch I've ever seen. The face was about the size of a matchbox but then there were numerous diamonds around the edge of a at least a centimetre wide. Not only that, she was wearing the largest ice-cube I've ever seen and if that wasn't enough, the rock was surrounded by many more small diamonds just in case the ice-block wasn't enough... :)  Well, I'm going to head downstairs and see if I can find a little dig camera... you may see some photos soon!

       Miss you already!   Hey gang!  I estimate that Gede will by now be flying somewhere over exotic Albury. Ooooooh.    urlLink Breakfast  was delicious and, to be honest, well worth attending just for Kai's attempts at pronouncing 'Cinnamon'. Heh.  Anyway, as discussed over brekkie you may find  urlLink this link  and  urlLink this link  helpful in finding a cheap, quick way down to London to see the lovely Ms. Kaia!   Fly safe!

       You bastard   Dearest Gede,   urlLink We hate you.   Please steal James and I as many shower caps, facial scrubs, mini shampoos, moisturisers, towelling robes and complimentary plush slippers as humanly possible. Oh, and everything that you can possibly carry from the mini-bar.  Regards, Caz and James x

       RETURN TO SENDER   So its been a week? It feels like decades...  Life on McLachlan Street has returned to normal with the SARS epidemic over. It's Saturday and we may not be fortunate to be at Inverness, but party fever is brewing.   The girls (K&C), are out shopping for more products made only from the worlds most protected and endangered species by multinationals, who have successfully convinced 98% of the worlds female population that panda puss keeps skin looking younger and that the eye balls of the flying penguin are great for that special eye lash tint.  They have returned....Alas.  Anyway...no real news, Friday night was filled with big party for James, so now am resting up and taking it easy. (James and Anna say hello by the way....they are jealous too).  Kaia is becoming a red head...  We All Miss you.   J.

       HELOOOOOO  Yes, I thought you guys may have been wondering what's been happening but I just haven't had a chance to get to the blog to post an update.  Well I think I mave brought SARS with me up to Glasgow because now 3 other people in my team are now coughing, sneezing and have runny noses. But seriously, it just a cold.. I had a runny nose yesterday and crashed after I had tea but now I've just got a runny nose and feeling better by the minute.  Work is coming along better than I expected. At first it was all very new and I didn't know what I was doing but now I've got a bit more of an idea of where I fit in and not so daunted by the fact that I don't know very much about what I'm working on. Particularly considering just started working for Accenture at the start of last week and here I am in another country with completely new people... just a lot to get used to in a very short space of time.  I've just realised what time it is and it's only turned dusk.. it's about 10:30 at night. But I'll keep going to you guys know the latest news :o)  Well the offices I'm in are  interesting ... On Monday we went into one set of offices in Buchanan St but there wasn't really space for us. We were sitting at other people's desk when they weren't there and borrowing other people's lan connections. It was fine while it was early and people weren't at their desk... but... as people actually got to work, it became a bit unworkable as you could understand. So we moved over to some other office in Queen St which where we are now... the only problem is there's isn't really much there. Well we've got some desks and there are chairs. At least there are lan connections and phone lines, except that people keep on calling through asking for people who definitely aren't there. That's because the floor had been cleared out and we are the only ones there... it almost feels like we're camping because there is literally nothing else. And for some reason my swipe card lets me in the door when it wants me to and not when I really do.  Well I think I've got the whole food thing kinda sorted out. At first I was relying on pub and restaraunt meals but that really only lasted for a couple of days. Then, I discovered Marks & Spencer prepared meals.... and I have to admit.. they're not bad. The spiced Morroccon chicken was pretty tasty and tonight's pasta with a bolognase-type-of-sauce was very apetising and filling. So I'd give the Morrocoon chicken 4 stars and 3.5 stars to the pasta... it was a little bit heavy. However, 5 stars to M&S Belgian Milk Chocolated Coated American Peanuts and to Tesco Jellie Babies.  oops. the connection from the appartment timed out... I'll continue this tomorrow morning.  well it's the morning now and for some reason the blog site just wouldn't sign me in at the apartment... so here I am at work!  I'll post something new in a few hours... -gede  PS: thankyou guys for all being so supportive (in particular Kai because I love her so much :o)

       James has returned   Quick update from the house. James just came home and now all three of us SARS patients are in the same place it's only a matter of time until they come to take us away/lock us in.   But don't worry. I'm sure we'll be fine.  Wait....who's that at the door? More later!

       Woe is us   Gede, I won't whine any more about HOW VERY ILL we all were as Kai and James are keeping you well informed. I certainly won't tell you about green snot, hacking coughs or any of the other excessively pleasant things that we are all experiencing. Hee hee.  Anyway, you are now administrator of The Mighty Blog. I look forwards to whatever scary technical things you care to inflict on us.  And now I'm going to join Kaia on the couch and pay worship to  urlLink Bert .

      Well Gede, in a very disappointing move we have not had any updates on your progress. Just rantings from the SARS household - you might come back and the whole place will have quarantine tape all around it and they will be serving food to us through the letter box, dressed in big white suits (you know the chemical ones). OK - so I may exaggerate. Carrie has been so lovely to me - helping me with much needed healing soup and teaching me the art of toasted marshmallows in between chocolate coated digestives, not to mention all the hugs.  In between the sniffles, snotty tissues and coughing fits it has been welcome relief. Mum popped over bringing flowers - which she assures me smell very nice - hopefully the cold will clear before they die.  She also brought much needed food and immediately took on the dishes after arriving - just so we could make some more! Apart from that I am trying to complete my uni assignments so I don't have anything to worry about when I leave - only 15 days now - and 16 until I see you!!!!!!!!! Anyway - must go and find some more tissues. Hope things are going well - let us know soon!!!!! Take Care Love Always Kai

       Alas, I too am now sickly   In other news...James is now also sick with what is most probably SARS, the dreaded illness which has been rapidly spread amongst the  urlLink McLachlan Street  inhabitants. Thinking that it had missed him completely, James went to bed immediately after 'The Tart Affair', [Read: Insanity is in the eye of the beholder] feeling like complete shet...Bring On The Kleenex! Rising to feel not much better...Woe is me!  With the  urlLink Mini  battery now fully charged, and the oil and water checked (Courtesy Pierre Latrine), I am having a SARS Street freeday, living it up with the folks for Bubble's 20th Birthday...Bring on the  urlLink Booze ! Anything to numb the pain....  No other real news to report Old Boy, hope that things are well in Glasgow, the weather is pretty dull here in  urlLink Melbourne ....so dont miss us too much...especially with our SARS like sicknesses...There hasnt been a posting from you in a while, so hope to see one soon....  All the best, jaMEs....  Ps. I tried to do that fancy link thing that Carrie does, but it all linked to really cheesey porn, so I decided against it!   Pps. Ok I think it should work now...with no  urlLink porn  links....

       Insanity is in the eye of the beholder   Gede! Darling!  Oh, we miss you so very much but today I think I get the title of Person Who Misses Gede The Most. But 'WHY?', I hear you ask! Well, I'm sitting in exactly the same spot that I was this time last week with the same perplexed expression on my face trying to figure  urlLink this shit  out and this time you're not going to walk in the door and save me. ARGH!  In other news Kaia and I made  urlLink Jamie Oliver 's yummo Custard Tarts last night and we both have colds so poor James is not only surrounded by estrogen but snotty tissues as well. Heh, bet you don't miss us so much now!  Hope Glasgow is treating you well sweetheart.   Till next time, Caz xxx

       THE GIRLS ARE MAD   Gede  It is about time that the (male)  urlLink beagle  arrived....Gede, since you have left there has definetly been too much  urlLink estrogen  flowing at McLachlan Street.... urlLink Knitting  is the latest faze, closely followed by baking, with trashey  urlLink mags  scattered all over the place coming in at a close third. And if you ask me, I am going to start hanging out in the garden shed to remember my place...  In one day, I have managed to put out the trash, the recycling, the paper, put the washing line away, the mini battery on the charger, load the  urlLink dishwasher , do the shopping; So we should have this serviced apartment lifestyle ready for you by time you come back....lol....If Kaia and Carrie keep digging, you will even be able to go downstairs for breakfast...  Anyway mate! Happy Birthday Again! Take Care... urlLink Drink Lots  and Smile Always...Then Fall Over...  jaMEs.

        HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR GEDE HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    XXOOXXOOXXOOXXOOXXOO  Dear Gede, wishing you the very best of birthdays. We are all missing you heaps - well maybe me a little more than the others. Have a fun day - drag some people out to the pub and have a pint or two - maybe not three or four ;)  Back here Kaia has become the raging party animal that she was always meant to be - this evening for example was spent in front of the fire - knitting one very funky scarf.  Ok seriously sad but Secret life was on - very scarey episode - Kelly ended up almost being raped and was hit by scarey weird guy - and that's not the end of it - it continues next week!  Not exactly up uplifting episode that I was looking for.  But - look at me - have a wonderful birthday - have a bit of a party and maybe we can have a belated celebration in a couple of weeks.  Much love Kai  PS will knit matching funky scarf for you :)

       This is Big Blogger   Hey pal!  Sorry to hear your first experience of Mother England was a negative one although not completely surprised. Heathrow is not renowned for its welcoming atmosphere!  Well, since you've been gone SO MUCH has happened!   - Irena was evicted from the  urlLink BB  house last night with 33% of the vote. Ben, surprisingly, received 32% and very narrowly avoided the chop.  - Next Sunday the rest of the house will be  urlLink revealed  and all the housemates will be under one roof. I can't wait. - The Logies! They were fabulous! The Secret Life Of Us won Most Outstanding Drama, your  urlLink divine neighbour  was looking very sexy and the lovely  urlLink Rove McManus  won the Gold Logie.   Hope you're settling into your luxury pad and that your first day  urlLink on the job  goes well.

      It's 8:30 in the morning and thisbloodyspacebarwon't bloody wellwork!andallthe keys are in the wrongplaces!#\\'#\  argh!#  Well my first experience of the UK so far has been of queues and lots ov very irate passengers. As soon as I was in the terminal at Heathrow, I passed one queue. Then I was in my first queue to get on a transfer bus which led to a queue of busses to get into the other terminal. Then I had to queue to get up the escalator and then there was another queue for the queue to pass through security. Once I was past that queue I waited again in another queue to pass through immigration... and then that was it!  I've never been through so many queues in my life! But now I've found myself the BA version of Qantas club and in sort of normality again.  I've been looking around for digital cameras but not the cheap $100 ones I'm looking for... So unfortunately you guys might have to wait a little while before some pictures come through.  The flight was long to say the least... last leg was about 12 hours in the air from Bangkok... It was a bit disturbing to see some people walking around with surgical masks... not too sure if that was to protect themselves  from everyone else or the other way around....   Will post again when I get to  Glasgow. cya!

       Another Week!   Well another week has passed and it feels like it's been a month but I've only been here 2 weeks! So much has happened, the past 4 weeks seems like 4 months. The first week seemed very long but this past week has flown by and I'm sure it's going going to get any slower. The pace at work is picking up as the different teams start producing their work and the task of integrating all comes up. In particular, because I'm only here for a limited time, I have to try and get my parts working and coded so that other people can understand it.  This weekend I'm not heading off with the others to Belgium but instead I'm going to spend some time in Glasgow getting my bearings and doing some exploring. In case you haven't heard I sent my application off last week in the chance that I could get my application back quickly. I came back very quickly but unfortnunately without the visa. It appears that I have to apply from Australia, my country of residence. I've checked out some other consulates and it looks like it's the same! Had I come from  urlLink Malaysia, Singapore, Fiji or even Tuvalu  I could turn up at the Swiss immigration and they would be able to provide me with a visa on the spot, but because I'm Indonesian... no way. However, it could be possible to send my passport and application all the way back to Australia and then I could visit John in Zurich. I'll just have to be more organised if I come here again but it's just a shame that I can't go with others because they usually just decide a couple weeks before going and say, "Hey, anyone want to go to Spain?"  Such is life...  However some good things have come out of not being able to go to Brussels, firstly Monday is going to be a public holiday and everything is going to be shut. So There are a few of us going to go into work and that means I get a day off in lieu (sp?) -- that means I get to hopefully have a long weekend with Kaia in stead! (yay!) Also last night when I went to have some drinks with the others after work, I met Tracy, Julie and Simon (can't remember his name!). They're all big Rangers fans so they've invited me to go and watch the Rangers match at the pub on Sunday... but we have to meet up at 11 even though the game starts at 3! FIVE hours and that's even before the first kick! I think I'll have to pace myself, these pots are awfully big! And finally, today I did some exploring -- going all the way up Sauchiehall St to Glasgow University... the area around there is really cool! It's a much younger area and of course lots of students around. As I was walking up I saw some towers that just appeared out of nowhere. So I went up and had a look and found one was an old church which was now offices for lease and the other one had been converted into offices too. But I kept on wandering up the hill and found myself in Park Circus where there are residences for students. There's a circle of houses on the top of this hill and it looks very much like those multi-storeyed houses from Mary Poppins. And right in the middle is a small park. From one of the streets that radiate out, there is a veiw over a huge park and you can see on the next hill the tall spire from Glasgow Uni. It's a pretty amazing sight... RMIT sure doesn't have anything that compares!  So I walked up to the Uni around the back way where there was more student accommodation. Lost the uni spire but found it again when I turned a corner and headed towards it past the library. It's pretty scenic for student accomodation but I guess it's pretty small inside those places... and cold. I kept on heading down right into the uni grounds and went around one side where there was a little court with more of those mary-poppins houses. I guess some of the lecturers must live in them. Then I walked then around the front and through an archway into one of the courtyards in the middle. There was a file of students heading somewhere onthe other side so I meandered around to see where they were going. It must have been exam time because everyone was just hanging around with notes, waiting to go into a door. There must have been a few other exams at the same time because in another courtyard there were more groups hanging around. I didn't want to seem to much of a tourist so I wandered around to the other side and took a few photos... it was just an amazing building. The buildings are made of this deep reed sandstone and everything looks like it just has this  history  to it.  After wandering around the uni I walked down the hill and cool shopping strip in Byres Rd. (The fire alarm went off again - it's about 6:30 so it must be someone's dinner again!) Had the best coffee and lemon torte at a place called Tinderbox. It was also a great place to escape from the weather! It was all nice and sunny the whole day and then it just started bucketing down. The weather changes faster than it does in Melborune for sure. The street had also a lot of other pretty cool (and the fire alarm just went off again - don't these people learn!) shops and cafes. Definitely a place to visit again :o)  After my coffee and watching people go by, I thought I'd try and head down to the River Clyde and to the Scottish Exhibition & Conference Centre which I tink is the one that looks like big silver mussel. But I couldn't find the right road to go down and the scenery was starting to get a bit industrial. The path back towards the motorway and the city centre again was pretty ordinary and I ended up going through a part of town that had what looked like commision housing. I eventually got back over the motorway and was on the city centre side. Thinking the area down by the River Clyde would be a bit more scenic...  Ohh, the TATU video clip has just come on... I wonder if this is the controvercial one? It's the one where there's two girls (and I mean girls, they look like about 16) driving some big tanker through the snow. The song's a bit boring.. .."theyr'e not gonna get us.." in a high pitched whine over and over again.. it sucks :oP    Well, the Rivery Clyde is big and wide and the area down there is a bit boring. There really isn't much to look at... but maybe it was the wrong end of the Clyde.  Oh my god! Someone has made a video clip with "McDonald's, McDonalds, Kentucky Fried Chicken and a Pizza Hut". oh God, it's awful! There's two chicks, 1 guy and a big blue dog... and it's No.1 of some chart. It's soo bad. Who's sick idea is this?? I swear this is some form of torture!   Well this post is just getting a bit too long and my tummy is rumbling... OH! I just remember what's on TV tonight... the Eurovision Song Contest. I thought I'd just watched some bad music... now's there's a whole show of them! (what's happening to me???) I think I'm just a little tired after walking for about 5 hours.  will post soon and I'll try not to make them so long :o) -gede

       JAMES' EVER PRESENT SUPPORT   Well - if you find me hiding in a corner rocking as a result of an intervention from our lovely neighbours don't be surprised.  As James so earnestly informed them that I was the investment banker with enough power and influence over one of the largest global finance companies that I could bring down every third world nation at the click of a pen! Ha! If only!  Glad to see that they don't stereotype anyone just as they would protest loudly at being stereotyped themselves. Apologies for the outburst but I hate hypocrites and well I am glad they got to know me before making their value judgement on the worthlessness of my existence! Anyway, on a much lighter not I have two essays - 5,500 words to be exact to finish before I leave in a week, this as well as movies with Carrie tonight, dinner with mum and the krapes tomorrow night, helping mum pack on Friday night, partying saturday night, kicking off the first sessions of the beginners program on Sunday and then well I have three whole days of work and then I leave.  Not much to do before I go. Well, must away and do useful stuff at work. Take Care and see you soon Kai xo

       THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS   As I'm not really sure as to whom is reading this anymore, (Hi Everyone's parents!) I will be nice.  McLachlan Street is going smoothly, for me at least...Kaia is about to have an action launched against her by the  urlLink lesbians  across the road, this story I will tell....  After returning to a NON SARS inflicted life I ventured out into the world of partyness alalesbian...The Story goes:  Catherineneaieneee' (The  urlLink French  Lesbian) invited me to a party she was having at a Lush  urlLink New York  Styled Studio Apartment on the Corner of Swanston St and Flinders Lane (Smashing). BYO Champagne the invitation read, F$#$^#$%k, they had 30 something cases of  urlLink Domain Chandon , didnt I look the fool. Thankgoodness I had decided against the  urlLink Spumante , but I probably could have done better than the Cockatoo Ridge as well....  The party was, well, very  urlLink Moulin Rouge  meets  urlLink My Life As a Dyke Two  meets  urlLink The Peel  (Remember that Gede!?!?!), needless to say I was enjoying myself thoroughly. A little into the preceedings I noticed that all the other lesbians from across the road and their partners were ignoring me. So grabbing another bottle from the fridge I ventured to the land of lesbian corner to find out their qualms.   Having had more than my fair share to drink, I decided that I would confront this issue face on (I dont shave my airpits, they dont shave theirs, we should be friends, whats the fuss!?). So here I was, and here they were, and even though I was very warm in an Australian made Wool Suit Jacket, the room was seemingly cold. So here I was, and here they were, "Wasup" was my opening piece (trying to sound as if I'd just arrived on my 9000cc 1965 Honda Kawasaki Motordike or was that motorbike, after the attempts to kick start my truck turned useless), still coldness. So here I was, and here they were, "So is there a problem grrls" I asked...The swiss one spoke up at last, "Yes, Catherineneaieneee said thaet youu werre an investamenta banka forr a multttinationalist capatistist consumer organsiationnss"; Gee, Okay then, I see how they could have got this impression, so I quickley pointed out that they had me confused with my housemate Kaia, and pointed out that I was a student activist, and that they may not have seen me around much 'cos I'd been really busy organising refugees being freed, and Iraq being a no war zone, and free education. Ahhhh, Best Friends Again....I did fail to mention that Gede had just flown to the other side of the world business class and was staying at Edinburgh Castle, but Im sure I will see them around.  Anyway that is just my little update...Hope you enjoyed it...Carrie, Kaia and I are off to a film tomorrow nite, and I think the weekend hold plans to get really pissed, not that we drink.  Good for now. James.  *NB: Not all websites have been checked for anything inparticular, so be cautious when opening.

       Two Become One   Big Brother III is the greatest show EVER. The joining of the Square House and the Round House was so damn exciting. I am far too obsessed with the show but I no longer care. Gede, they have a POOL! And a reallyreally cool sofa! And I wish it streamed 24 hours a day. Actualy I don't because I have a horrible feeling I wouldn't leave the house.  We will endeavour to keep you better informed, Gede!

        THE DANDY WARHOLS?????    Oh. My. God.  I LOVE that band. You're so cool. Except I can't believe you, a loyal Triple J listener, couldn't name one of their songs. For your information they came in at number 10 on the  urlLink 2000 Hottest 100  with the sublime 'Bohemian Like You' and, less impressively, no 89 on the  urlLink 1997 Hottest 100  with 'Last Junkie On Earth' and 'Get Off' is one of my favourite songs, I would totally make out with  urlLink Courtney , and it WAS  urlLink them because they played Glasgow Academy on Friday night.   If I wasn't already jealous enough of your Glaswegian jaunt and your Marks and Spencers food I am now officially green with envy.   Oh, and Gede - watch out for that stove. I'm speaking from experience :) :)

       And back again...  Kai? You're red head? I'm sure it looks absolutely stunning because there isn't a moment when you don't :o)  Well back again after a quick trip up, around and back again to Glasgow. But the story starts on Friday night.. after walking 3 blocks in the rain and back again, we wen to a mexican restaraunt to have dinner (in Glasgow... I know.. it sounds kinda weird). We headed down-stairs and we were served by someone we thought was originally mexican but just had a think Gaswegian accent - I understood him fine but it seems some of the others had a bit of a problem so I acted as translator. Then as we were having our Coronas, we saw some very rock and roll guys come in and take up the large table behind us. They were complete with large hairdoos, dark sunglasses, leather jackets and greeted each other with one raised fist in the air. We thought they were just some local guys from a band, dressing up to look the part but maybe just trying a bit too hard. Anyhow, here we are taking the mickey out of them and the Mexican/Scottish waiter comes up and says, "Do you know who these guys behind you are?" And we say no and then he tells us they're The  urlLink Dandy Warhols  so we stopped laughing at their rock image and tried to think of what their hits were.. and to this day we're still not sure what they were popular for... But come to think of it, considering I have no idea what the Dandy Warhols look like it's quite likely the the band was just some guys dressed up and said they were the Dandy Warhols... Anyhow, just as we were leaving, I found a tenner on the stairs and shouted everyone a pint around the corner. Lest to say I didn't have a great amount of sleep the night before we headed off.  The next morning we headed off at about 8:30 to the care hire place, feeling like we were very lost when we started wandering through vacant lots hoping we'd see a sign for Hertz. Finally we found it and headed off in two cars (there were 8 of us all together) down the motorway. I have to say, the West Coast is  amazing . It seriously looks like a scene out of Lord of the Rings. Huge mountains on either side with snow-capped peaks. The quick version of this day is we did lots of driving, went via loch ness, just missed out on going to Urqhart Castle because it just shut, then headed up to Inverness to stay at a b&b and catch a bite to eat. We ended up staying in two different places - the place we stayed at were the nicest and friendliest people I think I've ever met. Alistair the husband would talk your ears off! We headed up to a bar that sold come of the local brews and also there was a local band playing some traditional scottish music (tin pipe, fiddles and a guitar)... stayed there a while but when it closed at about 12 we headed off to find another bar to go to but found that they effectively shut the doors at 11. So you have to find the place you want to go for the night and just stay there till it closes. So there were lots of people walking around when we had to leave the scottish music bar. First we encountered a guy having a leak in a corner and the police coming up and booking him. Then we came across a full on cat fight int he middle of a street that left one girl on the pavement. So as we couldn't get in anywhere, we just headed home but it was a respectable 2 am in the morning by that time.  Day 2, we headed back to Loch Ness but this time to got to The Loch Ness Meuseum 2000. At first I wasn't particulary taken by it as we were told it was just some multimedia extravaganzza and I was expecting a fair bit of crappy animatronics and slide shows. Particularly the fact that it had "2000" in its name really didn't take me and to add to that, customer testimonials about the place as you walked from the car-park. However, we were convinced by Vanessa who'd been to it before and said it was worth seeing. So It wasn't too bad, it didn't have any animatronics but it did have female manequins dressed as men.  After Loch Ness, headed back to Inverness to head along the road to Sterling. We thought this was going to be a fairly short drive and the weather seemed good. Neither was to be the case. Only just a few miles from Inverness, our sunny warm sunshine very quickly turned into bucketing rain and dark clouds.   Oh great, the fire alarm is going off. Went out and it seems someone burnt their hair with a hair dryer!?!?!? Oh goody, can hear the fire engine outside now... bet that's gonna cost the hotel a pretty packet. It appears the false alarm here is set off by the minuetest of things. So I think it best if I don't try cooking on the stove :o)  It's funny, at home I'm usually fine with cooking and can get organised to get all the ingredients together... but here.. well.. I've got M&S :o)  Oh, so anyway, on the way to sterling, actually was a bit futher than we expected. Stopped off at "The House of Bruar" which looked like where everyone else was stopping because along this road there was absolutely nothing else. Passed a by a small town which had a very nice Chapel on the side of a river. Then we headed down to Sterling and the Wallis monument. got there 5 minutes late and was shut. Then we headed up to the castle but just as we got there, they closed the gates to.   So in the end we say a lot of countryside and the outside of monuments and castles... oh except for one castle on the first day but that's because you could walk in and out of it any time of the day.  So I'm back and still feeling tired. Need some sleep so I can take on week 2. I've got some postcards and hopefully you'll be seeing them soon in your postboxes :o) -gede ps: missing all you guys heaps.

       House of the Eternal Nightcap   Well Party Fever culminated as it always should. James driving Amy, Kaia and I around Melbourne in search of KFC for two hours while I played with the radio and Kaia kept telling James to 'SLOW DOWN!' even when he was doing 50kph in a 70kph zone. James had told us of a mythical KFC on Smith St which we were unable to find so we gave up and went to McDonalds and then, of course, came home and watched about 20 minutes of Moulin Rouge before passing out.  Gede, isn't it nice to know that some things never change?  Loveyoumissyoucomehomesoon!!  P.S. Kaia's hair looks GREAT :)

       LIFE ALONE DAY ONE   The house is empty...and very quiet....and very strange...feeling very much like Ben on his first night of BIG BROTHER (series three: australia)  Went to the Espy after dropping Kaiapoohs at the airport, to drown my sorrows....got ridiculously drunk, no less...at one stage I had a quadruple vodka and pineapple (which tastes very vodkary with a slight hint of pineapple, if you were wondering)...but generally I was just sticking to Double vodka, lemon lime....all free of course!!! I even decided at one point to get a tattoo, as you do, as I was talking to Maree's friend Buggsy, who is a tattoo artist, and he decided that we should do the word 'Enjoy' as in the coca-cola trademark on my tailbone....We all thought it was a great idea...thankfully I have sobered up now, and will rethink that idea at a later date...  The cleaning lady has been, and I must say that she did a wonderful job....she even asked me to get out of bed (which I had returned to after having been to my very early class! doh!), so she could change the sheets and make it for me (that was very nice of her wasnt it! she also did two loads of washing....i didnt know you could wash teatowels!!!!). So at this point, I decided that I would make lunch, but as she was also busy mopping and cleaning everything everywhere, I had to get McDonalds....Poor ME....  So, alas, I am missing you both, but the house is very clean and my tummy very full...Carrie is coming over tonight to cook for me, so I might invite some people over for a dinner party or something....  jaMEs

       Parting is such sweet sorrow   Hey kids!  Kaia has left the building, the country and our lives for the next 3 weeks. Sob sob!   Kai - I was very proud of us keeping control of our emotions at the airport, especially considering my chronic PMS at the moment. Was that sharing too much??? Anyway, if my estimations are correct you will be landing in Kuala Lumpur in about an hour. Hope that you got some sleep and that no-one dared to come and sit next to you!  James - We must stick together through this difficult separation! While I draw the line at  urlLink Tupperware  parites I am most happy to come round tonight and cook you dinner - give me a call!  Gede - It is times like these I miss you the most. When I'm sitting in a tutorial listening to Marselina (bitch! bitch!) waffle on about merge sort join type things and transaction processing and wondering how the hell I'm going to pass my PHP test tomorrow. Heh. Have a wicked time in London with Kaia! Send us postcards!

        It's time to go Kaia    Well, as James faces the trials and tribulations of his impending famousness, Kaia is being evicted from the house - only to go through the big doors at Tullarmarine (is that how you spell it??) into the big bad world.  As the time draws closer I am getting more and more excited, and can concentrate less and less.  However I am also sad, sad to leave my two partners in crime behind.  Both Carrie and James have been a strength (and supply of cask wine) over the last few weeks.  How I would have coped without these amazing people around me I will never know.  So to my two bestest friends in the world - I will miss you heaps, you will always be in the back of my mind - well at the front when I am writing one the 25,000 emails letters and postcards that I will be sending home, and Gede and I will have a few drinks for you.  Take Care, look after our lovely home, and I will be home before you know it.  Much love, always Kai xoxoxoxoxoxoxo

       The Secret Life of Me   Well, you will proud to know that I am officially a fully fledged member of  urlLink Mullinars Casting Agency  (The official Casting Agent of The Secret Life of Us)...  It was a suprise phone call yesterday from the Casting Director, my now agent, Wizzy Ringer, needing to see me as soon as possible...So off I ventured today for my very first very special photo shoot! Oh Joy! So arriving at their plush South Melbourne Offices, looking my best...I was greeted by a stylist and some wardrobe chick...very fun....Anyway, we will see where this goes now....but they sounded very positive, and considering that most people dont get their feet through the door, I must be doing something right, and considering that I missed the last appointment almost a year ago, cos I was hung over (I told them there had been a death in the family, well I felt like death), Its amazing that they still know who I am....  Kaia is preparing to leave me tonight, her last night (for three and half weeks), there seems to be a common theme here...What have I done??!??!  So keep smiling...And Carrie where is my postcard?  James

       It's time to go........Belinda   Dearest Gede,  This is your housemates. Belinda has elected to leave the BB house of her own free will because Ben (DIe, Ben! Die!) was being a bastard. As you can imagine, this has all of us in a state of wild excitement. We've just canceled Kaia's farewell dinner (sob, sob) so we can stay home and remain glued to our screens.   We love you and will keep you updated on this world first as news breaks.   Over and out.  P.S. Aren't you glad I told you to support Rangers? Watched the highlights last night on  urlLink SBS  and was thrilled!  P.P.S. Did you get my postcard? :)

       Go Rangers!   Yesterday I watched an  amazing  playoff between Celtic and the Rangers. Both teams had finished the season with  exactly  the same points and so both teams had to beat their opponents with a greater goal difference in order to win. In fact, the whole points and goal difference thing was so complicated that even at the end of the Rangers match, we weren't quite sure who'd won the cup.  Didn't quite go to the pub at 11 to watch the match at 3... that would have made my night a seriously short night. We ended up meeting up at about 1:30 which wasn't so bad. Mind you though, Julie and Tracy (the two that invited me along to watch the match) were drinking me under the table very easily. I couldn't keep up with the rounds and had to skip a couple.  We didn't stay much longer after the end of the match at the sports bar.. it was starting to thin out a bit so we headed up to another bar/restaraunt to have dinner. That was the last place we stopped off as the night was seriously starting to get long... well we had started at 1:30. Only stayed till about 9:30 when the eyelids were starting to get a bit heavy I was having more and more trouble understanding the Glaswegians... either my hearing was getting slower or their talking was getting faster!  I thought it best to stumble home and at least work off some drinks. Of course, after an afternoon of drinks, one gets the hankering for fatty, salty food. So I thought I'd try chips'n'cheese. Well, it didn't quite work out the way I wanted it to. I think the chips were a little cold and the cheese didn't melt. So I got home and tryied to zap it in the microwave but that didn't quite work too well either!  well best be back to work  cya! -gede

       FRED DROPPED DEAD   What an horrible week it has been....week one without kaia and too many weeks without gede and i dont like this very much.....Come home soon!  After realising that it was real, that I was infact all alone....and for a long time, I decided that I would make an effort to get to know Fred the dear neighbourhood cat, who I discovered was owned by George and Barbara, and you all know my hesitations to get to know pets, cos I get attached, and then they die...well I thought it was about time I got over this....so I spent the other afternoon, sitting in the sun, doing some reading and playing with Fred....a couple hours later...he was dead...maulled by a maximus dogus horribiliius....I was so upset....Sorry for waking you Kai, and sorry for not really sounding sad, but I was traumatised, I had heard the cat screetching and people yelling and screaming and had gone out to see what is was, and it was a huge greyhound cross with Fred in a lock jaw by the abdomen, and blood and guts everywhere, and I wasnt allowed to go and hang out with Anna cos she was alone at Spruzen Avenue and James was at work and she said I had to ask James if I could go over, and he said no, cos Marg had told him that no one was to be with anna when he wasnt there....I was soooo miserable (still am)...It was horrible...and just when I was thinking things couldnt get worse....last night my dad told me that my granny has cancer, so anyway....If things keep going like this...I am getting on the first flight outta here....I think Im gonna defer uni tomorrow....its all too much....  Anyway...sorry to be so sad....I will go now...it is great to hear that you both are going good....I miss you....  lots of love me....

        Hello From London Town    Hello, Hello, Hello my friends. Well yes I have finally made it away from the Pub and too the computer to tell everyone that I am yes still alive!   It is 12 mid night as the BBC is playing some very dodgy programs so allas it was time for me to edit the blog. Well, yes I did arrive - only after feeling incredibly tired and emotional on the plane and getting misty eyed over the safety demonstration video leaving melbourne - maybe just don't ask. So anyway arrived in London - got the train to Paddington and then out to Brixton - yes Anne did warn me about the funny people standing out the front of the tube station - let me tell you London "funny" people make the laughing man on the Epping line look like my best friend. Anyway have got the knack of Brixton - head down walk fast so all is well.   Spent Friday night at a very funky club off Oxford st - danced until four and had a brilliant time. Saturday was also spent dancing although I nearly fell asleep on the dance floor so didn't make it that late - although managed to entertain many people with the term "tracky dax" for much of the evening. Put Gede on the train yesterday and spent today being all cultural at the tate gallery. Tomorrow will involve more shopping and then a show in the evening - I know I am sooooo posh! Off to see mum and dad on Wed so very excited. Anyway, that's all from me - the BBC is getting VERY interesting. Carrie and James - I am officially worried Caz - caught up with Emma and had a great time. Love to all and take care - James I am sure Fred is alright. Much love. Kai

J: *blank look*  C: I mean, lovely portraits of the four of us looking quaint.  J: Oh! Like standing on a river bank out in the country wearing period clothing?  C: And looking wistful!  J: Yeah! And maybe playing croquet. Or just posing with a croquet mallet held jauntilly over one shoulder.  C: Ooohh, or riding.  J: Yes! Our four person polo team!  C: Oh, you totally have to be holding a whip.  J: Hahahahhaa. And we can make our horsey Hello! faces.  C: *cackles*      Conversation 2: Outside The Swan Hotel, Friday Night.

       James Now   Yes it's me! and gee, only a week and a half until Kai comes home! Hoorah! Bearing Gifts! Hoorah! And Gede, if you dont come home soon, i'm leasing out your half of the bedroom to someone from manpower....and no, not Jamie Durie, he can have my spare side of the bed!!!! Anyway, the long weekend was very....well, long....too many parties and other things...all whilst Caz was stuck at home studying....but Caz, thanks to daddymorebucks, now has a litre of BS Gin, so Hoorah again, thus to say that the beautiful girl will be spending at least the next three hours here!  Uni is fine, very over it...its not same being a student in a student only house....where are my workers???? (Caz wants to also add here that she passed the  urlLink PHP  assignment by one mark, and Caz says 'cheers!'...)  Not much has been happening here at McLachlan....the lesbians have been really handy of late, they seem to love the jump starts four times a day! Fred is very dead unfortunately, but my new  urlLink beagle  (ginnie) is fantastic! You have to see him!!!! He is sitting on Caz's lap right now, and I am only telling you about him because I am drunk, so act suprised when you meet him! He only cost $800 but they are sending me the papers!!!! I am thinking that we can make a quick quid by entering him in shows and selling off his sperms....  I am missing my home style cooking....KFC dont seem to do it as well....even if they did cater my culinary needs twice in one day recently....I have discovered the 'Baked Potatoe Cafe' of late, and now with also Caz's stamp of approval, I have also been there twice in 24 hours!   James and Anna are still living in lovers paradise over at Spruzen....they were going to have a couple days apart so they could do some study...but that lasted all of 4 hours...bless!   anyway that is all from me, I did think on Saturday that I had cancer/diabetes/respiratory problems...but they seem to have all cleared up now...perhaps it was liver related!   See You soon! And Kai, seriously, I need a new watch! beautiful, silver, bulky, ticking, designer....you know what I like!!!! And Caz needs shoes....corporate bitch collins st shoes for malvern!!! love to all! Peace UP!  love jaMEs.....

           find your  urlLink queer  as folk personality !     Yes, that's James' Quuer As Folk Personality. He's one sex-ay ad exec, right kids?  Anyway, James and I are home at McLachlan St, doing what we do best; hanging out as a team, watching Bridget Jones and drinking from a sweet, sweet cask. Just spoke to the amaxing Kaia and would love to call Gede but, as James rightly pointed out, he's working hard for the money (a ha, a huh).  We love and miss you both!  And now, back to the cask!!  Love Caz and James xxxxx

       Sunny Belfast!   That's right, even though Belfast is in Ireland it's part of the United Kingdom and I didn't have to apply for a visa. Well to be precise, it's Northern Ireland. We (Craig, Vanessa, Danielle and I) flew out of Glasgow for Belfast at 7 am on Saturday morning and lest to say... I was asleep on the plane. However not for very long as the flight takes about 20min. As it was such a nice day when we landed, we decided to take a bus up to Derry to do some sight-seeing (it is also called Londonderry but now the Irish have renamed it back to just Derry).  Derry an interesting, quaint little town on the river. It's right up the north of Ireland and used to be the main port where emmigrants would leave to go to America and Australia. There's a 6-metre wide wall that surrounds the centre of the town and you can actually walk around the whole perimiter of the city on top of the wall. Derry is also the place where Bloody Sunday took place and many un-armed people were killed by the British Army when they were protesting for civil rights. We entered the city on the more quaint side where there are old pubs and stores but around on the other side you can look down from the wall onto the 'Bog' where the Irish catholics tradionally have lived. And from the wall you can the murals on the side of houses depicting people who have lost their lives and other Irish heroes. Also, on that side of the town there's a huge tower with an arry of surveillance cameras. Also there's a watch-tower with a large screen in front of it protecting the people inside from rocks and balloons filled with paint. So in Derry you could still see there's a bit of tension.  Belfast was similar and we even took a black-cab tour. The driver was very good and told us many stories about what happened in certain places. The stories told us more about how brutal people can be to each other people and it sounds more like it's less about religion and more about just getting your own back. Even when we stopped, a kid about 7 or 8 years old, came up and asked us what we were doing looking at the murals and then talked to the cab driver about throwing stones at people who were giving them a hard time.  The tour took us through both areas and we didn't realise how close some of these communities live together. There's still tenstion and you can feel it in the air. All the barbed wire, high fences and police cameras and watch towers don't help making the place more relaxed. The police still drive around in heavily armoured vans and when the marching season starts (in 2 days time) it still stirs up trouble.  Belfast was a good place to visit but I'm not sure if a place I'd like to spend a long time in.  well, getting back to work again, cya soon! (in about 4 weeks now)  -gede

       The last post   Well my friend this will be officially my last post from the big OS.  It has truely been an amazing time and I have to admit I am a tiny bit sad to be leaving. Seeing Anne was great and I have made her swear on her life that she is comming to visit early next year.  So bring on the summer party season!!!! Seeing mum and dad was great too, Moet on the balcony in the balmy night air, lunch of smokes salmon and San Pellegrino water (spelling????) on the terrace with boat trips on the lakes and evening wines in very trendy bars (Oh the life!) Then to Italy with mum.  Where a new definition of born to shop was given life.  Maybe last month would have been a good time to invest in the Euro because we certainly did our bit the Italian ecconomy.  However we did fit in time for wandering the back streets of Rome and Florence while taking in the sight and the occasional glass of champagne. Then on to Glasgow - where it has rained nearly all week.  Thankfully we picked the only sunny weekend Scotland has had in the last 75 years to go to the Isle of Skye which is a truelly magic and untouched place (Gede was particularly taken with the sheep ;). And well yes Glasgow - need I say more ;) So anyway, Gede and I head down to London tonight then I have to be at Heathrow by ten tomorrow and then off I jet home. Looking forward to all the hugs at the airport and missing everyone over here already. Much love Kai

Another exam in just 2 days. Oh, the pain.  But...BUT! James and I are going to have the best Saturday ever because we're getting jiggy with  urlLink Harry  and then we're going to have the best Sunday ever because there's going to be a  urlLink DOUBLE EVICTION  (Bye Kim!

But I wont tell Caroline, cos she might get jealous! So anyways, have finished uni for the semester so am now officially in party mode. Although I have scored myself a little job doing marketing/advertising things about 30 hours a week and start tomorrow, so will have to click out of party mode quick smart and go into work mode. Mind you, it really is only going to be four days a week and I will generally start at around 10am and finish at around 4pm, and lunch of course will be fit into that busy schedule somewhere too! Of course, it also happens to be corporate casual, and also located in PRAHRAN! Thank goodness, as everyone knows how much I hate the CBD. Lots of beautiful shops in Prahran, and can pop down to Greville Street, Commercial Road and Chapel Street for lunch so start booking now!!!!!

       AT LAST MY SOLACE IS OVER...   Well folks, as Kai has now made her last official blog from OS, I am now making my last official blog as a loner!!! Sorry Gede! I know you will miss her....But the quicker you come home, the sooner we will all be together again!  Today has been a hectic one indeed, as I sat at the table out the back in my robe, with a cup of Earl Grey and a packet of Marlboros, the cleaner (Cecilia) and the gardener boy (Warren...I know bad name), we very busy at work! The lawns, front and back are looking sensational and swept, and the house, well what can i say, is spotless! Thank god for the help!  Not too much to report, life has been consistently good, whilst quiet. My new little job is great....worked three days last week, Im still not really sure what I do, as I havent really done anything yet other than turn up late, leave early, take long lunches (1 1/2 hours!!), watch television, play on the internet, make personal phone calls, and drink coffee and smoke ciggies....but as I see it, that really is more than enough to keep me occupied and as long as Im getting paid then I am happy.  Well, as I prepare to go and get Kai, I must say that I am glad that K&G had an engaging time with each other! We knew you would!  All love and best wishes to all readers!  jamesy  Ps. Just got a text from my bastard of a brother Timothy, 'just arrived@windsor castle w/ holly 4 Wills bday..haha..wish u were here. TRDD.'

       Gede, this is Big Blogger...you have 4 sleeps to go before leaving Glasgow   Wooohooo! It's not that I don't like Glasgow I just want to be home!   I saw some orange-men marching through the streets of Glasgow on the weekend... something I wasn't expecting. I have never seen so many men beating drums so enthusiasticly (orright! so I don't know how to spell :oP )  Not really a great deal other news at the moment... I was planning on going to Edinburgh to see the castle and some ye-olde buildings but I slept in :o) Just been doing a bit of running - not away from anything just running - and playing a bit of football. I even got myself a fluro-orange ball so get ready people for a few kick-to-kicks when I get back.  This week not a great deal is lined up - just getting through the week and then I'm off on Friday!  see you all real soon! -gede  PS: apologies for last round of postcards...

       ahhh... Glasgie again...  Yet again I'm back in Glasgow and it feels like I'd only just left. It definitely feels different on the second time round - there are things here that I know and not everything is new to me - it almost feels like I've gone interstate, except that I've had to travel halfway round the world and I'm in a seriously different time zone.  Coming back only came with one minor hitch - somewhere along the way my guitar got lost but we were soon reunited last night when BA dropped it off at Somerset. Unfortunately my new Room isn't as selubrious - on the first floor it comprises of just one studio wich includes my bed, wardrobe, lounge and kitchenette in the one room. Fortunately my bathroom is separate ;o) In addition when I tried making myself a gourmet dinner of baked beans on toast last night, the microwave sounded like it was about to explode.  Anyhow, because my apartment isn't up to scratch, it's given me greater impotus to look into a proper apartment. Talking to some of the others here, it looks like I can get a fairly nice two-bedroom apartment in the city. Funnily enough, the major thing I'm looking forward to is having a gas stove to cook on! I think I need to start watching what I eat and start doing some exercise.  Well it's time to go home now so I'll post again soon.

       Here we go again   Gede, happy to hear last night from the lovely Kai that you have indeed arrived safe and sound in the motherland.  We miss you already!  But, golly gosh, didn't we have fun while you were home? I especially enjoyed the leaving barbeque (complete with evil  urlLink punch ), Chocolate Buddha (that squid! YUM!), drunken dork chats at Fanny O'Dea's, the  urlLink Victorian Wine Precinct  and just you being here.  WE MISS YOU!  But, there is so much to look forwards to - particularly The Engagement Party Planning. Heh, James and I are taking Kaia to the Australian Bridal Expo next weekend. Well at least we're talking about it. Chances are we'll end up sitting at home with our beloved  urlLink saviour  and watching Bridget Jones's Diary. Just for something new and exciting.  Oh, and I promise to look after Kaia. Mainly because she's my best friend but, to be completely honest, partly because she has the power to put me in one of  urlLink these  if I don't! Hee hee!

       What a weekend!   I headed to Edinburgh on Saturday to just see a few things from the Fringe Festival and maybe see the castle. However, while waiting in the line to get ont he train I noticed just a few people wearing Scotland rugby tops and most of the men were wearing kilts. I thought either there was a really big sale of rugby tops in Glasgow - particularly if you were wearing a kilt - or there must be a match in Edinburgh. I confirmed my hunch when I called Anne and she gave me some directions on how to get to the match. It was good fun - I don't really quite understand some of the rules though... and why they hell do they do the scrum, I really don't know. Scotland was playing Italy and lest to say the Italians are not a  rugby  nation. They were whipped by a margin of 22 if I remember correclty. They also seemed to have a bit of a problem with some of their players to because for some reason they kept on swapping player number 15 with 22. There was a point where 22 stayed on for about 3 min when he was substituted again! About 25,000 people came to the match and when they exited the stadium we were blocking traffic most of the way back into the centre of Edinburgh - it was a great experience.  So after watching something very blokey I thought I'd better do someting a bit more cultured and so I wandered up the hilly side of Edinburgh to find a festival program. Aftera bit of exploring some of the streets I happen to come across the centre of the  Fringe festival  where they'd blocked off a street and people were performing on small stages. Finding myself a festival guide, I wondered off again to find a pub or a bar to sit and find something to see. I found a funky little bar off the main road called the Brass Monkey and perused the events while sipping a pint of Red Stripe. However, the task of finding something to see was a little hampered by the fact that there were over 150 venues and even more performers. Thinking finiding something good to see would be very hard I came across an ad in the guide for " Shakespear's Italian Job ". I thought FANTASTIC - this is something I've got to see and the plus was it was relativley close by - only thing was that it started about 5 min ago. So I downed my pint and rushed over to the venue. Only to find out that it was sold out. Along with it was the Umbilical Brothers which is always a good show. But my like changed when I was standing outside looking for something else I could see there when a guy came up to me and offered a ticket for free - they'd bought to many. So I headed in to see the Illusion Brothers. It was a play and I didn't figure what it was about until I read the blurb for it in the guide - something to do with escaping boredom. It was a little abstract but nonetheless enjoyable to see. Though because I'd just sculled a beer and inside it was very very warm, I couldn't help but feel a little sleepy in some of the slow parts.  By the time the play was finished it was about 9ish so I thought it was time to head home. It was also the time that the Scottish supporters were heading home to so it made for an eventful ride home.  They'd obviously headed to the pub before and after the game and obviously were pretty rowdy. I was just standing in the train because there were not seats left and about a dozen loud and drunk guys pushed in also. A poor girl was sitting on her bags in the doorway to and nearly got crushed when a couple of the lads decided to have a bit of play fight there. They were singing and talking dirty at the top of their voices and then to top it off, one of them threw up 15 minutes before Glasgow station.  In addition to seeing a rugby match and a play for free in Edinburgh, my luck was with me yesterday to. I was just wandering around Glasgo when I got a call from Richard saying that he head a extra ticket to the Big Day Out @ the Green here in Glasgow! So I went and saw  Queens of the Stone Age  and  The Red Hot Chili Peppers!!!!!  It was very very very cool. The peppers were the headline act and it was an amazing show... soo many people there.  My credit is about to run out at this Internet Cafe so it's adios for now.  Are my posts getting a little long? I think they are...  lots of love -gede

       My New Place!   Well, after being homeless on Glasgow streets for over a week I've finally moved into my cool new apartment! Even though I do have a phone line and I've updated the blog template to show my new address and home phone no. The phone is still connected to the previous tennant so it will change at the end of this week.  This place is very very very cool, It's in an old building but has recently been refurbished. It has high ceilings and parquetry floors in the main areas except for the two bedrooms which have carpet. The main bedroom has an en-suite bathroom (I've always wanted one) and the main bathroom has a pretty decent bath in it. I have views of the River Clyde complete with white swans swimming up and down in the morning and afternoon. The kitchen has Bosch everything and finally, a gas stove!!! So overall, I like the place very much. There is a Somerfield supermarket just 20 metres around the corner and I'm the same building as Craig and Danielle so its cool to have some friends just upstairs to go and watch some TV or just to hang out for a while...   Well I have to go to work now, so I'll keep you updated with my new home phone no.  lots of love, -gede xoxxoxo

      To gym or not to gym... that is the question.   I could just run but when it's starting to get a bit colder and the winter night rolls in faster, the gym could look like a good option. But at 249 a year, I think I'd prefer to buy myself some gloves, a beanie and some tights and go jogging!

      Well, it has been a while since the last post... I'm getting lazy in my old age ;o)  Back, again, in Glasgow. The last week seem to go very,very,very quickly but I had a blast of a time. From day one, going to the Caulfield Cup, attending Judy Crepe's birthday bash and going out on romantic dinners with Kai... All done in one week. Of course it was no where near enough time but I'm very much looking forward to the next time I'm back in December - party, christmas and Bali - here we come!  Halloween is coming up this weekend and in preparation, I've bought myself a pumpkin to carve. Never done one and I just hope that I don't slice into my hand in the process - blood splashed over it might make it look more scary but I don't really want it to be mine. It's one pretty decent sized pumpkin so I'm wondering what I can do with the pulp - if it's at all edible. I suppose I could make a hell of a lot of pumpkin soup. I'll put some photos up on the  urlLink photo album  when I figure out how to carve it!  The flight back here was long to say the least. I sat next to a man who's going to London just to see some favourite artists and cover bands from the 70s! He's even going to a band who remake the whole shows, including lighting and special effects, of Genesis concerts! Can't for the life of me can't remember his name but he's also good friends with a man who is an expert on comedies. Even wrote a guide to BBC radio comedies.   Finished the last few chapters of Michael Moore's "Dude, Where's My Country!" and the final verdict: man, I'm glad I don't live in the US and I sure help they work themselves out for the safety of the planet. Moore's pretty emotional through, well, all of the book but to get across what's happening I think you've gotta.

       The flu... ugh  Went home early today because I've got the flu and feel like a dog. So I'm on the net searching of a recipe for  urlLink bubur ayam . It's an Indo chicken rice porridge/soup. I guess it's the equivalent to chicken soup but even better :) The thing is... I feel like eating eat but I just wish someone would come over and make it for me...

      It was pretty cool to go and see Powderfinger (supported by Jebidiah) at the Queen Margaret Union on Sunday night. I've got a few pictures and sound bites but it looks like I was standing just a little too close to the speakers. Just a real pitty that Maree couldn't get a ticket to the concert but it sounds like she had a bit of luck that night anyway, going down to my local "Fat Boabs" and winning 10 and being offered a job behind the bar.  Will post pictures at some point, promise!

       Person IN Clyde  Just as I've been sitting here at the computer, a police helicopter went right past my window. I look out to see what's happening and I can see some police and ambulance people running across the foot-bridge. The reason, there was someone actually IN the Clyde river. Which I thought was really amazing because I thought it was pretty solid. The helicopter actually dropped a small bundle - possible a life jacket but it missed the person by 10 metres. The paramedics dropped a round, orange life presever right next to the person but, I think the person couldn't actually see it. He/She swam back towards the bridge but swam right past the thing. The person eventually drifted out of sight... past a few more bridges - they really needed someone in the water - hope they got him alright.

       I love the smell of burnt wrecks in the morning  Going on my bit of a healt kick, I decided to go for a bit of a jog yesterday down along the Clyde River. As you may or may not know, the clyde river is a little similar to the Yarra in terms of it's color and willingness of people to actually be in it. So I'm joggin along, past the parks, the industrial estates. I make it past the stench of the sewerage farm - I try to run faster to get past the smell but I only end up breathing harder and breathing in more of the smell. So I make it past the built up area and from what I can see there's only grasslands near the river and I come to the estates where I can see the towering commission housing flats. As I make it past a small bush I come a cross a burnt-out wreck of a car. Don't know how long it's been there - I'm not really one for forensic science. So I'm thinking, interesting area, don't know if I'd really like to live here. So I decide to keep on going and I get to a point where I can see the huge Rangers stadium. The path actually goes down and to the left there is a large corrigated iron fence separating what looked like scrub and the path. As I'm jogging a bit further I come across a lane-way going away from the river and there's another burnt out reck, but this one I guessed was pretty recent because it was still smouldering. And I'm thninking, I really don't want to be here now and make very good progress back home.  After that experience, I think I"ll just go to the gym after all.

       Actually...  Saw  urlLink Love Actually  and to be honest I thought it was just going to be one of those regualar, schmultzy American chick flick, but actually.... it wasn't too bad. It may have suffered a little from trying to tell too many stories at the one time and thus some of the stories lines may have been a little light. However the message that you get hurt the most by the one's closest to you, but you also get the most when yo stick your neck out and take a risk is very uplifting.  I would definitely recommend seeing this movie this christmas.

       Undereaters Anonymous: Or,  An evening at McLachlan St    I wondered..is it possible to be on a diet and visit McLachlan St every weekend?   Appertif:   One bag of Vegie Chips eaten in the car between Glenferrie Rd Coles and Westgarth High St.   Entre:   Two loaves of Garlic Bread (Coles homebrand)   Snack:   7 Mini White Twix, 3 Mini packets of Maltesers   Dinner:   3 baguettes smothered with cream cheese, lovingly sprinkled with the pepper mill, scattered with one of the 4 jars of capers we have accrued in the name of Cazs special pasta sauce and never eaten and a fuck load of smoked salmon.   During Dinner Snack:   A large chunk of Tilba Trilogy cheese, a four pack of dip (nice, different and unusual) and a packet of water crackers (Coles homebrand).   To wash all of the afore mentioned down:   Approximately 1 litre of DeBortoli Red Wine (Coles homebrand) per person.  To get the complete McLachlan St experience one should enjoy all of the above with Sex and The City episodes, early Kylie Minogue and some vintage Australian Idol tunes.

Had a wonderful weekend hanging out at McLachlan St. I'm still in shock that we managed to have a sophisticated dinner (i.e. not sitting in front of the telly and not pissed) on Saturday night. Quite a change from the debauchery of the week before!   The Golden Globes were AWESOME. James is a super star for taping them for us and then speeding across the city so that Amy, Kaia and I could get our fix of trashy Hollywood types.  Oh, and for the record Kaia had 18 accurate Golden Globe predictions, I had 15, Amy had 13 and James had 4. Beginners luck Kai - come Oscar night, vengeance will be mine!!!

Oh am maybe we could change the name to Kaia and Gede come home :)  or maybe the Mclachlan St gang come home :)  Anyway, as you can see I am not really focusing on going away, well maybe just a little bit.  It is all very exciting but looking at my to do list (composed by mum) I am getting a little scared what with having to: - organise my super - organise a will (Way too scarey ??????) - organise power of attorney - do all the bills etc - clear out cupboards both at Mclachlan St and Spruzen Ave (knew it would come back to bite me one day!!!) - etc etc etc,  However to deal with this panic I have decided to focus on my own list: - Watch Love Actually ahhhhh - Think of Hugh Grant ahhhhhhhhh hehehehehe - Look at flats in London that I will never be able to afford unless I discover I am the illegitimate child of the queen - Drink Cask Wine - Drink G&T's - Hang out with my lovely friends - Eat cheezels - well I won't be able to eat them for a couple of years - don't think I want to after yesterday - Generally avoid anything grown up  Speaking of which must get back to work.  Remember everyone we must practice blogger before we are flung too far around the world.  Much Love Kai xoxo

       At least you're not watching Australian TV   Gede, believe me, if you could see the current line-up of reality 'entertainment' on Australian TV at the moment you would realise that bugs being poured on V List celebrities is actually genius. If genius means a thousand times more entertaining than another renovation show.   That said, I'm just about counting down the seconds until Australian Idol 2 and the subsequent chance to go and see the next bunch live in concert like Kaia and I did on Friday night! Did Kai tell you how she cried when Pete the Pig Farmer sang 'Burn For You'? No? Well, I thought I'd share it with the INTERNET. It's okay Kai, you can tell the nice people how I welled up when Guy-dol sang 'Angels Brought Me Here'. Oh, wait.....

       I'm watching UK TV, Get me Out of Here!  wow... what a name for a TV show. The name is too long to be even made into an acronym - so the just call it "The Jordan Show" aka "Tits" - no just kidding :P But how can the most popular character in the show (at least by the number of articles in the glossies) be voted off???

       oh! gonna miss the party!  Bugger!  Well that's really what I feel having to miss the last party!  And now... a linke to the  urlLink Naked Chef  on foodtv so I can never forget where those recipes are.   I saw that photo and wasn't sure if kai just happened to have lost something near the rock and was eating twisties at the same time... now I understand!

       Twisties! So that they may grow!   Gede, my darling boy, I think Kaia may have already linked to this but  urlLink right here  is a picture of her and her new glasses drunkenly feeding Twisties to a rock so, as the title suggests, that they may grow.  Like mother, like daughter. Even in their hour of drunk thinking of the environment. Bless.  Also - I made over urlLink  A Little Distraction . Why don't you check it out and comment on the new layout. Or, you know, ignore me! It's all good!  Four days until the First and Last McLachlan St Cocktail Party. Don't worry, Gede, I'll take so many photos you'll feel like you were there and, also, Kai, James and I will pull our usualy trick of drinking to our absent friend every five minutes. Come to think of it you might be the reason we keep getting drunk. "Must drink to Gede....one......more....time....... Absent friend! Glahrrrgh...."

       Crutchy McHoppy has new glasses!  I just clicked on the last post and ohmygod - Kai you look different! Of course I love the glasses and they suit you perfectly but I hadn't seen a photo of you with your new glasses on.  Can I have a closer photo??? please?  And no guesses how came up with the name "Crutchy McHoppy" :)

       HeHeHe 4.5 Days and counting   Well I have nearly survived my life here at AXA.  It is my last monday morning where I will have to get up and drag myself into work YAY, now Sunday nights will not present the same dread that they always have - that whole need to drag out the last couple of hours of your weekend until you are faced with a whole five days until the next little holiday!  But I am being miserable and depressing so I will stop and focus on the fact that I am going to be irresponsible and unemployed in less than a week (Friday afternoon doesn't count as it consists of - long leaving lunch, team meeting, then drinks YAY).  So anyway, I have to say that this whole going overseas things has hit me in small doses up until now but I think this weekend reality definitely hit.  I am very excited but also very scared, scared that it will not live up to 17 years worth of dreaming.  But still all will be well because Gede will be there to see it with me, which will make the world of difference.  Right - I had better go and do some work and stop boring you all with my inane drivvel.  Four weeks and counting.  Kai xoxo

       A week after Paris  Well, after finallying getting my Aussie passport I have made my first trip outside of the UK that isn't Switzerland!!! Though not to make the whole trip completely easy, our travel agent did manage to stuff up by not telling our hotel we were arriving a day late - the result, our room was sold and we were left standing in the foyer wondering where we were going to stay. However, Flightcentre did pull through rather magnificently and got us a very nice room at a better hotel :)  Kai's already gone through the details so I'll just list some my highlights:  - first night fantastic meal around the corner - we didn't speak a word of French and the waiter knew zero English, but we managed to have a fantastic meal.  - the beautiful walk from the Arch de Triumph  - having coffee at the amazing cafe on top of the Pompidu Centre and the amazing views of Paris  - dinner at le Train Bleu - in particular the Crepes Suzzette  - the chocolate shop on the island next to Notre Dame  - wandering the back-streets of Paris  - the vanilla slice I had on the last day  And the Next Trip? well... it is Zurich - again - but this time I'm going with Kai :)

      Well, I've seen the "There's something about Miriam" TV show and now she's going into the Aussie Big Brother House... what NEXT!!! It's crazy i think i'm going to explode with all these exclamation marks!!!  I bet the first thing everyone thinks about is, "How is she going to keep it secret when she takes a shower?"  Don't you just love TV?

      Staying in a posh hotel for the night and we're going to hit the town! Though I think we'll need a little siesta in the arvo after flying at 6am in the morning... well, it was a cheap flight.  I am currently listening to the  urlLink John Butle Trio 's latest album "Sunrise Over Sea" and it's fantastic! I'm starting to like this blues/grass roots music quite a bit now....
