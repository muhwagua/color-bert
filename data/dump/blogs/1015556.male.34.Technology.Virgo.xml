      well, the retreat was a success, i think. at least for me.  the breakout was great fun, got to tell Justin what Christianity really is about.  pray for him.   probably the best part was having Communion for the seniors on Sat nite.  i think they really enjoyed that, and i hope they really felt appreciated, which was one of the goals.

      wow.  read this -    Johannesburg is the largest city in South Africa and about 750,000 of its three million citizens are currently infected with HIV. The city's official death rate has increased by 35 percent in the last five years. It reached 19 per 1000 in 2002, largely due to an increase in AIDS-related deaths in young adults. "This year we will bury about 20,000 people. In 2010, unless someone develops a cure for AIDS, we expect that figure to be 70,000," says Alan Buff, who is responsible for cemeteries at City Parks.

      Here is some homework I have given K. K is a student in the small group ministry that I ran for the past 4 years.  He just graduated high school and is going off to college in a few weeks.  At the beginning of the summer, he told me he was seriously thinking about missions and wanted to meet with me through the summer to learn, discuss, etc. So I've been giving him some hw.  Session 1 1.   urlLink The Problem of Success  2.   urlLink Summary of William Carey .  He truly made disciples, not just converts. 3.   urlLink Being a Tentmaker  Thoughts of being a tentmaker.  Session 2 (this is also posted below) 1.   urlLink God Centered Motivation for Missions  - by John Piper.   2.   urlLink The Essential Task  - by Ralph Winter.   3.   urlLink Missions, Music and Mobilization   Music and mobilizing.

      so K (student in the HS ministry I volunteer in) and I went to  urlLink DCLA  for a day yesterday to help volunteer.  pretty cool.  quite a setup.  we saw the Big Room, which had some great visuals, worship and teaching, although we misssed other integral pieces of the event, such as Deeper Learning, which I'm sure had more depth to the teaching.  One thing that kind of made me sad,  0 mission organizations in the exhibit hall.  0, none, nothing.  Of course, Compassion was there, and students could pick up material on YFC's missions trips.  But there was nothing in terms of strategic missions, like the 10/40 window, unreached people groups, etc.  One organization even quoted their mission statement saying they were about "blah blah blah and providing students a quality mission experience."  Since when did we desire to send students to missions trips to give them a quality experience?  Not to be a snob, but I'm pretty convicted that we could be doing student missions better.  A lot better.  I'll post some pictures later maybe.  Here is a picture of great volunteer in our JH ministry -  urlLink Kelly  volunteering at DCLA.  Kelly is on the right, an awesome youth ministry servant.

      a few articles that i have been reading and discussion with one of my graduate high school small group members. 1.   urlLink God Centered Motivation for Missions  - by John Piper.  Talks about desire, passion and the worship of God as the motivation for missions.  2.   urlLink The Essential Task  - by Ralph Winter.  Talks about the real task of missions and the core definition.  Viable, indigenous, church planting.  Good framework for strategically thinking.  3.   urlLink Missions, Music and Mobilization   Music and mobilizing.

      Saw this ad for getting a free book.   urlLink Revolution in World Missions .  A free book by one of the guys on staff with  urlLink Gospel for Asia .  Signed up for it, and the organization looks pretty above board - native, indigenious missionaries, reaching unreached peoples.  Cool.

      HW for K... Session 5. 1.  finish the studies about The Story of His Glory 2.  email the list of 5-7 questions to two or three missionaries you or your family support.  also send me the list and I get to send them out to two or three that  I support. 3.  Do these studies based on Paul and his missionary journets.  (If you are reading this blog, somehow, and are interested in these studies, email me and I will send them to you.  However, they are based on material covered in Perspectives.) K leaves for college in 10 days or so, so I think the final step would be to put together a survey to see what he found the most helpful. That would be kind of fun.  In other developments, met a guy named Dan the other night from a local church, who came and did a presentation about God's Mission to the college age worship night at GCC.  Very cool.  And then they showed the  video for Urbana 03.  I think the majority of my dteam guys are interested, very very cool.  I think Dan and I might dialogue about mobilization, which would be great.

      Launch F summary:  24 people (all high school and leaders this time) Brought a bag lunch and then made at least another in the Warehouse before we left. Had lunch with homeless people in two parks in DC.  Saw three other church groups give away food but not engage the people.  Our students noticed. Over 20 significant conversations over lunch. Some students gave away all of their food and didn't eat. Worked in the Capital Area Food Bank for three hours in the distribution warehouse. Packed over 600 food packs. Students most impacted by exposure to the homeless and engaging them in conversation over lunch. Some also impacted by being hungry while working and relating that to being without food for an extended period of time.

      Our first event for SPACE is tomorrow.  Feeding the homeless and working at a  urlLink food bank .  Should be lots of fun.  We'll see how it goes for the first one.  Pretty exciting to try to start a movement of service and missions among high school and middle school.

      Text of a Missions Newsletter I get.  Kind of cool.  I'm not a youth pastor but sometimes I pretend...  RESOURCES--2003-09-09 (Top Recommendations)  Below are the responses I received to the question: WHAT RESOURCES HAVE YOU USED IN A CHURCH AND FOUND EFFECTIVE IN MOBILIZING PEOPLE TO ENGAGEMENT IN WORLD MISSION? I was a little disappointed at hearing back from only 20 people, but those 20 people had quality recommendations. In each section (Books, Curriculum, Periodicals, Seminars, Websites), I put at the top of the list the resources that were recommended by more than one person (using the asterisk for a bullet), then the rest of the entries for the category follow in alphabetical order (using the plus sign as a bullet). Usually children’s resources are made into a separate category, but I combined them with the rest. ~Nate Wilson, Editor  BOOKS  * CHRISTIAN HEROES: THEN AND NOW - published by YWAM, biographies for kids written by Janet and Geoff Benge - about a dozen in the series - around $6 ea.: www.YWAMPUBLISHING.COM (From: Nancy Tichy - USCWM and Pete and Esther Errington - Mission to Unreached Peoples)   * LET THE NATIONS BE GLAD!

Goals: •	Provide service opportunities for students to be involved in. •	Intelligently target kids who are not already involved. •	Another tool for discipleship – growing through serving. •	Teaching on various service/mission topics. •	Bridge the gap between different age ministries (middle school/high school/gen X) - range of people serving together. •	Enabling students to see their giftedness in a serving opportunity. •	Provide support and focus for strategic, progressive, graduated student missions. (longer term goal)  Values: •	All service lies somewhere in the realm of evangelism (I Cor 3), therefore, opportunities will be pointed towards interaction with people when possible. •	There is a correlation between service and missions. •	Devotionals and debriefs for every event. •	Constant evaluation via survey forms. •	Adult leaders/chaperones are integral.

      sorry its been a little while. here is what is new:  1 - my padwan, K, went off to college, his freshmen year.  good choice of schools.  in his first few days, he was feeling a disconnect between people talking about being successful at school/career and his calling for strategic missions.  interesting, huh?  more to come about that. 2 - the Missions Task Force at GCC has asked me to coordinate a group going to  urlLink Urbana  this Christmas break.  a great thing for me to be doing, mobilization wise.  this event can take my former high schoolers to a level that i simply could not, in terms of mobilization, calling, exposure, teaching, etc.  very cool.  so far, there are about 5 from 03, which was the grade i helped shepherd. 3 - kickoff for the service/mission team at GCC, our first meeting tomorrow night.  we have a leaders retreat we go to this coming weekend to announce and socialize with.  we'll see how that goes, but its pretty cool.

      Thinking about the best way to convey to the SPACE team (mostly students) that service is not an end to itself and this whole thing can be much bigger than just service projects.  It has the potential to change the way students see others, the way they live day to day, the way that they view the world, not only around them, but the global world, knowing that most of the world still has never heard the name of Jesus.

      Faith based service holds incredible appeal for the next generation of believers.  In an email poll of the campus chaplains at evangelical Christian colleges, fifteen of seventeen respondents said they had seen a significant rise in student interest in service projects and missions trips in recent years.  Short-term mission trips are particularly popular among today’s teenagers and young adults: the number of people taking them has increased exponentially, from about 25,000 in 1979 to 120,000 in 1989.  By 1995, the number of short-term missionaries had swelled to 200,000.  urlLink The New Faithful   Colleen Carrol

Pilot Year   •	Launch F – 2003-09-27 24 people (all high school and leaders this time) Teaching focused on homelessness and hunger around the world Brought a bag lunch and then made at least another in the Warehouse before we left. Had lunch with homeless people in two parks in DC. Saw three other church groups give away food but not engage the people. Our students noticed. Over 20 significant conversations over lunch.  Some students gave away all of their food and didn't eat. Worked in the Capital Area Food Bank for three hours in the distribution warehouse. Packed over 600 food packs.

Patterns:  •	10%. •	Will require students to take ownership.  (Indigenous leadership in a sense) •	Overwhelming response and support.  •	Youth min leadership •	Students •	Overall body •	Opportunity to change the type of students we grow. •	Will (not might) continue to evolve as God leads.

      Wow - big changes happening at work.  The cool gist of it is that people are going to get big opportunities to ask significant questions since their whole identity, the whole landscape of work, the project, the relationships are all thrown into flux.   It's really as big as getting married, you are excited about the future, a little forlorn at leaving a chapter of life behind.  Pray specifically for CE, had an intense conversation with him about the purpose of life.  It was great, better than I ever expected it to go. Pray for the next two days, Thursday and Friday.  Lots of farewell lunches on Thursday and the mass exodus is on Friday.  Also, pray for the  urlLink missions conference   K and I are going to.  Pray esp for K, for direction and vision.

      Nice article  urlLink here  about the Act One screenwriting program in Hollywood.  Neat to hear about Christians working in Hollywood.   Here is her  urlLink blog.   Had breakfast with my friend Ryan, who is back from Melbourne Australia for a few weeks.  Very cool just to catch up and here about Australia.  He is there with Campus Crusade, who has a long term commitment to building college ministry in Melbourne.  The most significant thing - 'People don't think about what happens when you die.  When you ask them, they say they don't know and they've never ever thought about it.  And the conversation just stops.  That's where relational ministry becomes important because when they get to know you, they ask why you are so different.'  On the Urbana note, we got three cars volunteered up from families of kids that are going.  Very great news.  I have officially turned over the coordination to the couple that are going, which is great news also.  Very excited for these kids though, my biggest prayer is that God will give them a new idea of success (that is not about the lies Satan tempts us with) and that they will get the gist of the essential task.  Listened to a tape from Perspectives again (I've listened to it many many times). Its a lecture on Elements of Historical Revivals and The Three Eras of Christian Missions.  Again, so many many good things from it.  Here are some key points: - 24K people groups in the world, 10K unreached right now. - The Moravians (more info  urlLink here ) and their missions had 4 senders for every missionary.  So... * 5 church planters for every unreached people group = 50,000 people * 4 senders for every missionary = 200,000 people * total = 250,000 people * there are over 250,000 evangelical Christians in the state of Colorado alone. ** the American church could easily do this....

Nice small party for the girlies.   urlLink This  was a big hit for Christmas, along with lots of Barbie stuff...  Had a potluck for our neighbors last night, very very fun.  Lots of diversity here.  In 8 families, two are Indian, three are Caucasian (one of them is a mixed-race Caucasian and Panamanian), one African American, one Korean, and then us.... Ha.  Chinese, yes, definitely.  A great part was having this whole mix of different kinds of food.  Will be neat to see as the years go by what impact we make on them.

Great group of kids, looking forward to seeing how the conference changes and transforms them.  I guess the biggest thing I would like to see is a changing of their understanding for what success truly is.

      Great challenge/encouragement from a youthworker  urlLink here.    Key points include:  - "We have to grasp that, in this post-modern world, young people are far more engaged by people who 'do' the truth, rather than those who assert it." Right on.  I think thats all a part of true discipleship.  Youth ministry has primarily been about youth group meetings, not neccessarily living your faith out.  And I think when we talk about reaching the world for Christ, true missions, young people have missed out, because we don't talk about it, and we certainly, in most cases, don't model being a disciple, around town,  much less around the world.  - "Imagine a small church where there is no youth leader and no youth meetings, just a handful of teenagers who help lead the Sunday School during the Sunday service." I think that's it.  What I love about GCC so much is that our ministry is leader-driven, student-led.  Meaning students are up front as much as possible with leaders behind the scenes, doing that empowerment, encouraging, challenging.  It really also fits in with the whole 'indigenous' leader idea that people in missions have been talking about of late.  - "We need to start telling these stories again, inspiring and challenging our young people with the rich resources of our Christian history." This is something that I think I should focus on too.  People LOVE to hear a good story.   urlLink Chris Curtis , the guy that wrote this, said that he watched 52 movies in the year 2003, all for the purpose of looking at the whole story.  Wow.  - Some final questions Chris asks: 1. What is more important in my youth work, what I achieve or who I am becoming? 2. What gets more of my attention and energy: the youth programme or the young people? 3. Am I prepared to admit to young people there is a dark side to my life? 4. Am I prepared to risk failure or do I play it safe? I love question #1.  In order to win students to Christ these days, we have to be authentic.  A well run youth night with great games and a pretty good talk doesn't do it anymore, nor should it.

      So Im possibly printing some christmas cards from the web, using some templates at HP.com.  It's kind of cool, since I just bought a new photo printer this past weekend.  Of course, did I really need a new printer?  No, not really.  It's a luxury.  Anyway, K and I were joking about phrases to use on Christmas cards in our very well to do American society, keeping in mind the global condition of the rest of the world...  - hoping jesus is preached in your life this season - so wow, 30 million don't have food today. when was your last week long fast? - at least you have access to clean water - be glad jesus doesn't care that you don't - 1.2 billion lived on $1 today. i think it's time for a frappachino  (this was my personal favorite) - how do you feel drinking bottled water because your tap doesn't taste good? At least you don't get intestional problems from it.  Very pious huh?  Well, it was funny at the time....

       urlLink SEMP  dates are now online.  Baltimore is July 17 - July 23.  Hott.  SEMP fits in, I think, to a long term strategy in that it is awesome training for sharing your faith in the same culture, which can lead to a cross-cultural experience once students are trained and have an experience in the same culture.  I took a group to SEMP in 1999, in Baltimore, right down the street from where we live.  Even though we go to the Inner Harbot all the time, and that is where I proposed to D, I will always still remember talking to people about Jesus right in front of the Hard Rock Cafe. As they say, they are trying to raise a movement of youth evangelism.  I think its working.  They not only teach you about how to do it, very well I might add, they engage kids in dealing with their friends back home by praying for 3 friends months before the conference starts, writing letters to them while they are there, and actually sending them on the Thursday during the week.  It's pretty intense when 600 kids are dropping their letters back home in a big bin, having a huge worship service around the idea, and then praying for this big bucket that is going right to the Post Office. Along the same lines is  urlLink DCLA , put on by Youth for Christ.  DCLA only occurs every 3 years and last year it was in DC, LA and somewhere in the midwest, St. Louis I think.  I went for a day last summer to DCLA with KN, my young padwan.  It was pretty fun, but I dont think we got a real feel for the whole event because we were only there for one day.  Most of our time was spent in the exhibit hall since we were adult volunteers.  In all that time, I didn't think I saw one youth missions organization that really got it, by that I mean, understood the essential task for reaching unreached people groups.  Out of 8000 kids in DC for that conference, if only 10% of them got the vision for the unreached, think of that potential. The other thing I have thought, between Sonlife and YFC, not to bash one or the other...  But Sonlife has this pretty cool setup with some international youth ministries and is really focused on at least church planting where there is no church.   YFC doesn't seem to really get that.  YFC has a big missions arm, but most of that seems to just take kids out to experience something cross-cultural.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not against growing and discipling kids, but using 'missions' to do it, when we aren't being strategic, when we haven't worked with indigenous ministries, when we haven't been able to do something that has good followup, thats where we need to start doing some missions that is strategic but also accountable.  It reminds me of the statistic that 33% of short term missions trips do harm to the people they try to reach.  Of course, keep in mind, I don't have ANY first hand info about YFC mission trips, just the literature.  So I could be WAAAAAY off base. Some info  urlLink here  on Sonlife's International connection.  Plus, I think their youth ministry training is top-notch, and Biblical.

      Good article about  urlLink urban house church planting .  Really great points, not just about church planting, but discipleship and mission as a whole:  - Recent studies of American Christianity have demonstrated the church in America talks about personal discipleship, but does not practice it (See George Barna, Growing Effective Disciples). In healthy home churches most of the members should either be trying to disciple others or be under discipleship by others. - Leaders of an existing home church will look for ways to plant a new home church naturally, not artificially. By natural, we mean they will seek to keep young Christians together with those to whom they minister and with whom they have invested relationally.  - Our best church planting teams have regular times of prayer together for the mission of the church. A good prayer meeting should be based on a prayer list prepared in advance by one of the members. Praying for non-Christian friends by name as well as key goals in the home church will turn back the attacks of the evil one and unleash the power of God into the church. - The refusal to plant a new church was usually based mainly on the fact that members didn't want to upset a situation they saw as very happy and wholesome. In our view, such groups are far from wholesome. They are desperately sick! The members have come to see the home church as something that exists for their well-being and happiness, not for accomplishing the will of God. A well-led home church sees itself as a team setting out to accomplish a mission, even at the expense of acute personal suffering.  Members in a successful church-planting movement see themselves as participants in a vast, spiritual war. Both concern for the lost and excitement over the fact that we are going to win drive them forward to a position of self-sacrificial love. - American church leaders tend to interpret the biblical picture of church planting in very superficial and non-demanding ways. Leadership in a home church is seen as something that must not significantly interfere with typical bourgeois American middle-class living. American culture already places heavy time demands on the modern family that may interfere with an adequate family life.  (**Ouch, because its so true.) - We have talked with quite a few churches who started a home group ministry, only to see the groups turn inward and lose evangelistic effectiveness. Such groups are mainly interested in blessing each other and have lost the excitement of evangelism. This pathology is desperate because it is extremely hard to turn around. If anything, we believe that groups who turn inward are in even worse shape than impatient or superficial groups.  Also,  urlLink Xenos  is also listed in Tom Telford's (from the ACMC) book  urlLink Today's All Star Missions Churches.

      from the Friday Fax...  Friday Fax 2003 Issue 48, 12 December  Has Bin Laden started a new search for Jesus? Religious and ideological pressure is not going in the intended direction, so "Osama Bin Laden may have helped many Muslims find Jesus", according to missions expert and author Patrick Johnstone. "Tens of thousands of Iranians came to faith in Jesus because of Ayatollah Khomeni. Since 11 September 2001, the number of Muslims seeking alternatives has grown massively. Many are afraid of extremism, and many are afraid to say anything at all, but many are secretly searching. There have been breakthroughs in Northern Africa, Indonesia and Nigeria, where the Gospel is bringing fruit. Thirty percent of India's Dalits are considering a change of religion, and a growing number are finding Jesus. Opinions Buddhism also has widely varying opinions, and is losing credit because of developments in the past decade. Major ideological blocs are not as impenetrable as we may initially believe," he said, calling for prayer for the parts of the world opening for the Gospel, and on Western Christians to make themselves available to God for long-term missionary work.

      A Biblical worldview, defined by Barna:  - that Jesus Christ lived a sinless life - God is the all-powerful and all-knowing Creator of the universe and He stills rules it today - salvation is a gift from God and cannot be earned - Satan is real - a Christian has a responsibility to share their faith in Christ with other people - and the Bible is accurate in all of its teachings  Read more  urlLink here.   The fifth one reminds me of the story  urlLink Dr. Clive Calver  tells of a wife he met in some Third world country (I forget specifically which one), there with her husband the pastor and her two young children.  He asked her where her husband was, and she responded that he was out at the next village preaching Jesus.    (This is all a paraphrase...) "How long have you been here?" "About a year" "What happened to your predecessor" "Well, he came to the village preaching this strange, different god.  And then the drought came, and nobody had any water or food.  So they killed him." "And what motivated you to come here and do this?" "We are Christians.  Isn't that what all Christians do?"

      Lots of links tonight and thoughts tonight... (It's a slow night covering a production release...)  =====  urlLink Here  is a very interesting article about a former Playboy playmate doing incredible community development work in Haiti.    A few things got my attention: - that she specifically went to the worst of the slums. - it seems like she is not just throwing short term solutions but looking at long term methods (ie not just feeding them but teaching them how to feed themselves...) - 16,000 children on $13,500 a month.  wow.   - look at how she handles the finances, low to zero overhead  ===== A free DVD on missions, the IMB International Missions Emphasis 2003.  Order it for free  urlLink here   Very nice, could be a very good resource for discussing with people. ===== Being a tentmaker and rebuilding Afghanistan  urlLink here    - only 21% of women and 51% of men can read - 40% of university professors are homeless - "If tentmakers never open their mouths, I think that's deceptive. If I simply only use my credentials as an agenda to get me in, so I can start preaching to people, that's false. I don't live two lives. I'm a Christian with five degrees."  ===== Reaching out to prostitutes in Vancouver  urlLink here

      Series of articles on  urlLink homeless  in San Francisco.  Be prepared to be heartbroken if you read it, its quite intense.  In total contrast with my principles and values, I watched this  urlLink movie  the other night....  I felt dirty.  I made it up by making some notes from  urlLink Piper  .  I think I redeemed myself.  I've posted notes from it down below, its just from the Conclusion page.  It's pretty heavy reading though, I definitely have to read it again.   Notes - Let the Nations be Glad!  The ultimate goal of God in all of history is to uphold and display his glory for the enjoyment of the redeemed from every tribe and tongue and people and nation.  His goal is the gladness of his people, because God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him.     Worship  Therefore, worship is the fuel and the goal of missions.  Worship is the goal of missions because in missions we aim to bring the nations into the white-hot enjoyment of God’s glory.  It is the fuel of missions because we can’t commend what we don’t cherish.  We can’t call out, “Let the nations be glad!’’ until we say ,”I rejoice in the Lord.”  Missions begins and ends with worship.   Prayer  Prayer puts God in the place of the all-sufficient Benefactor and puts us in the place of needy beneficiaries.  Therefore, when the mission of the church moves forward by prayer, the supremacy of God is manifest and the needs of Christian missionaries are met.  In prayer, he is glorified and we are satisfied.  “Until now you have asked nothing in my name.  Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full”  John 16:24.  The purpose of prayer is the Father’s fame and the saints’ fullness.   Suffering  The extent of our sacrifice coupled with the depth of our joy displays the worth we put on the reward of God.  Loss and suffering, joyfully accepted for the kingdom of God, show the supremacy of God’s glory more clearly in the world than all worship and prayer.   Is Knowing Christ Crucial?  The aim of missions is to ‘bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the nations (Rom 1:5).  God’s will is to be glorified in his Son by making him the center of all missionary proclamation.  The supremacy of God in missions is affirmed biblically by affirming the supremacy of his Son as the focus of all saving faith.   People or Peoples?  Rather, God’s will for missions is that every people group be reached with the testimony of Christ and that a people be called out for his name from among all the nations.  It may be that this definition of missions will, in fact, result in the greatest possible number of white-hot worshippers for God’s Son.  But that remains for God to decide.  Our responsibility is to define missions his way and then obey. The ultimate goal of God in all history is to uphold and display his glory for the enjoyment of the redeemed from every tribe and tongue and people and nation.  The beauty of praise that will come to the Lord from the diversity of the nations is greater than the beauty that would come to him if the chorus of the redeemed were culturally uniform or limited.  Moreover, there is something about God that is so universally praiseworthy and so profoundly beautiful and so comprehensively worthy and so deeply satisfying that God will find passionate admirers in every diverse people group in the world.  His true greatness will be manifest in the breadth of the diversity of those who perceive and cherish his beauty.  The more diverse the people groups who forsake their gods to follow the true God, the more visible God’s superiority over all his competitors. By focusing on all the people groups of the world, God undercuts ethnocentric pride and throws al peoples back upon his free grace rather than on any distinctive of their own.  This humility is the flip side of giving God all the glory. Humility means reveling in his grace, not in our goodness.  In pressing us on toward all the peoples, God is pressing us further into the humblest and deepest experience of his grace and weaning us more and more from our ingrained pride.  In doing this, he is preparing himself a people – from all the peoples – who will be able to worship him with free and white-hot admiration. Therefore, the church is bound to engage with the Lord of glory in his cause.  It is our unspeakable privilege to be caught up with him in the greatest movement in history – the ingathering of the elect from every tribe and language and people and nation until the full number of the Gentiles comes in and all Israel is saved and the Son of Man descends with power and great glory as King of kings and Lord of lords and the earth is full of the knowledge of his glory as the waters cover the sea forever and ever:  Then the supremacy of Christ will be manifest to all, and he will deliver the kingdom to God the Father, and God will be all in all.

       Recording Dying Languages  This article is pretty interesting about a researcher doing language studies with languages that are dying off.  Wow, I've really never thought about this before.  And the ramifications for something like Bible translation, that keeps the language from dying, and sometimes consequently, the whole culture from dying... - "A language doesn't fall over a precipice, it sort of slides into oblivion." - Once I asked, "Can I use this word this way?" and the response was, "Of course, you're foreign, you can say a wrong thing. But I can't say that." (Foreign missionaries NEVER do stuff like that.) -... to learn about how people communicate and how the human mind works. What are the categories that are important enough for people to express them in their languages?  If these so-called "exotic" languages die, we'll be left with just one world view.  - every Amazonian society ever studied has a legend about a great flood. - About 60-70 percent of linguistic diversity in the north-western region of Brazil has disappeared in the last 100 years.

       Next SPACE Launch  So this SPACE kids come through again.  We went and scoped out the next Launch....  I'll talk more about it when it gets closer.  Very cool though.  Going to do something unconventional to celebrate Valentines Day.  Think a party that's totally out of the box.  Yeah. We also talked about these two statements: 1 - The church of God has a mission in the world. 2 - The God of mission has a church in the world. Which one is right and why? It made for some good discussion, especially after we framed them and talked about the previous four launches and which ones were relevant to statement #1 or #2. Just for the record, #2 is really the right one.  Debate among yourselves in the comments...

       P&P 2  So we had this big work party tonight.   It was quite a party, literally.  There was a great dinner, an open bar, a live band, and lots of socializing, at one of the best  urlLink restaurants  in DC.  Very fun.  It was really a great time for a job well done, the execs really pulled out all the strings to throw this gala event.  They really did a nice job. My friend CW came too, even though he left the company a few months ago, he was invited, because he was a contributor to our successes.  It was great to catch up with him, and we continued the conversation we had started during his final days as an employee.  We talked about a decision point, The Passion movie, and differences in religions.  The most significant thing we talked about, certainly, was my story of the P&P strategy, and thinking about him and giving him that book.  How Joe pressed him for what book, and then hearing that Joe had gotten the same book as a gift the next day.  CW said that he didn't think it was a coincidence at all, I of course agree.  He and his fam also went to a church a few weeks ago, and they liked it.  It sounded a lot like Grace.  Your prayers for CW and his continuing to investigate and research would be great news.

       Waking the Dead 3 - Fellowships of the Heart  - It Must Be Small  This small core fellowship is the essential ingredient for the Christian life.  Jesus modeled it for us for a reason. - It Must Be Intimate Of course, small groups have become a part of the programming that most churches offer their people.  For the most part, they are short-lived.  There are two reasons.  First, you can’t just throw a random group of people together for a twelve-week study of some kind and expect them to become intimate allies.   “All the believers were one in heart.”  Acts 4:32  It means they all loved the same thing, they all wanted the same thing, and they were bonded together to find it, come hell or high water.  And hell or high water will come, friends, and this will be the test of whether or not your band will make it:  if you are one in heart.  My goodness- churches split over the size of the parking lot or what instruments to use during worship.  Most churches are not ‘one in heart.’ Second, most small groups are anything but redemptive powerhouses because, while the wineskin, might be the right size, they don’t have the right wine.  You can do some study till you’re blue in the face, and it won’t heal the brokenhearted or set the captives free.  We come; we learn; we leave.  It is not enough.  Those hearts remain buried, broken, untouched, unknown.  It is knowing that you are at war, that God has chosen you and evil is hunting you, and so a fellowship like Frodo’s must protect you.   - It Will Be Messy “The family is… like a little kingdom, and, like most other little kingdoms, is generally in a state of something resembling anarchy.” – G.K. Chesterton It is a royal mess.  It is disruptive.  Going to church with hundreds of other people to sit and hear a sermon doesn’t ask much of you.  It certainly will never expose you.  That’s why most folks prefer it.  Because community will.  We have settled for safety in numbers – a comfortable, anonymous distance.  An army that keeps meeting for briefings, but never breaks into platoons and goes to war. Living in community is like camping together.  For a month.  In the desert.  Without tents.  All your stuff is scattered out there for everyone to see.  Some philosopher described it like a pack of porcupines on a winter night.  You come together because of the cold, and you are forced apart because of the spines. However, there are two things you now have that you didn’t have before, and they enable this sort of fellowship to work.  First, you know the heart is good.  That is the missing key in most fellowships.  Your heart is good and the other’s hearts are good.  This makes it so much easier to trust and to forgive.  Whatever may be happening in the moment, whatever the misunderstanding might be, I know that our hearts toward one another are good, and that we are for one another. Second, we know that we are at war.  The thought that says, “Oh, brother, here goes Frank again.  Why can’t he just drop it about his mother?  What is it with these people?  The’re not really my friends.”  That’s the enemy.  You must remember that the Enemy is always trying to pull everyone else to do to you what he is doing to you.  As I said earlier, he creates a kind of force field, a gravitational pull around you that draws others into the plot without their even knowing it.  “If you cant get it right, we don’t want to be with you.”  It’s a lie.  It’s the Enemy.  I don’t feel that way toward him really.  But unless I live with this awareness, keep a watchful eye out for it, and resist, I’ll get sucked into the pull, start making agreements with it, and there goes the friendship. - Fight For It “Be kind, for everyone you know is facing a great battle” – Philo of Alexandria A true community is something you’ll have to fight for.  You;ll have to fight to get one, and you;ll have to fight to keep it afloat.  But you fight for it as you bail out a life raft during a storm at sea.  You want this thing to work.  You need this thing to work.  You can’t ditch it and jump back on the cruise ship.  This is the church, this is all you have.  Without it, you’ll go down.  Or back to captivity.  This is the reason small house fellowships thrive in other countries: they need each other.  There are no other options. Suddenly, all those “one another’s” in Scripture make sense.  Acts of kindness become deeply meaning full because we know we are war.  Knowing full well that we all are facing battles of our own, we give one another the benefit of the doubt.    Wow....  We just started with a growth group this past Fall.  Some great couples in it, and to be honest, we kind of hand picked it with people that we already knew, that we had worked with in ministry before, because of some of the reasons Eldredge refers to above.  We started with three couples in the Fall, the other two we knew pretty well, and worked with together in YouthMin for literally years.  Like about 5 years.  We have shared passions, the same kind of calling, see the same kind of perspective.  We just added a fourth couple, and they are a great mix.  When I think about these three other couples, the word 'sacrifice' comes to mind.  I'm pretty sure I could call them in the middle of the night if I needed to.  And I think they would feel the same about us.

       Evanescence  So, I don't exactly have a disposable income to buy all the latest music, although I would love to.  In any case, since it was one of the top albums of 2003, I bought it.  I wanted to buy it used, but D and I bought some other stuff from Amazon and got free shipping.  I'm listening to it now, as I do more reading of Eldredge (the girlies are in bed...)  Eldredge speaks a lot of seeing our lives as epic, and this album really fits the part.  The music is so wide and expansive, listening to it convinces me that I'm integral to the battle, that the hour is desperate, that there is a war going on.  It's interesting isn't it.   The other thing that comes to mind about it is that its kind of a dark record when you first listen to it.  But the words are so heavy.  Our culture is looking for spiritual answers...  Enough that the album sold 3.4M copies...   i tried to kill the pain but only brought more i lay dying and i'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal i'm dying praying bleeding and screaming am i too lost to be saved am i too lost?  my God my tourniquet return to me salvation my God my tourniquet return to me salvation  do you remember me lost for so long will you be on the other side or will you forget me i'm dying praying bleeding and screaming am i too lost to be saved am i too lost?

       Year of the Monkey  Unfortunately, I'm not usually very big on Chinese New Year.  And I'm Chinese!!  It's pretty sad all in all.  And if you know me, you know that the only Chinese culture I have in me is eating chinese food.  I've tried to be better about it.   I chose a people group in China for my Perspectives final paper, and been trying to expose my kids to more Chinese culture.  But it's still bad.  I've also often thought what kind of impact I could make as a Chinese person living here in the states, maybe Chinese youth ministry, or something like that.  It really is a big culture difference, moreso than I ever used to think. So this year, I took the girls to a Chinese New Year celebration they had at our county library.  It was pretty cool, lots of little crafts, and a few little demonstrations and shows.  They seemed to enjoy it.  You can see pictures of them  urlLink here . Also, this is a cool  urlLink link  to see a Quicktime VR of the NYC Chinatown celebration.

       Parents Panel  Our pastor to the Family, TS, asked D and I to participate in one of three parents panels that he is running, for preschoolers, elementary age kids and middle/high schoolers.  Pretty cool, it's very flattering.  When we both read the email, we were like, "Who, us?"  Anyway, it's a pretty neat opportunity and not that we are experts.   Here is a snippet of what he wrote to us.  "...seen in you a commitment to being a God honoring parent and one who knows the difference some encouragement and a few new ideas can make." It sounds fun and like it could really be a great thing in very tangible terms.  We are totally going to help out.

       Day Job  More changes at my day job due to the mass excursion of people in November.  The gist is that I now have a new boss.  I think circumstances warrant some new individuals fitting in with the P&P strategy.  Very intersting.  In case you haven't heard about the first great P&P story (because I just know there are bound to be more), get in touch and I'll tell it to you.

       Camp Sheng  Last night, me and the girlies slept in the tent.  It's a very fun thing to do, most of the time, and we don't do it that much.  And yes, Katie has been camping outside, once in the backyard... I remember the first time I did it with her when she was probably 18 months or so.  It was probably the most impactful time I have ever had with one of my kids.  That was the turning point of her toddler years, the point where I was no longer her father, but her dad.  I still think about that sometimes, what a profound influence time makes in relationships. You can see some pictures of Camp Sheng  urlLink here .

       Gospel Night  So CpR had this thing tonight called Gospel Night.  It was basically training for high schoolers on how to share the Gospel.  We focused on the key points, helpful verses and sharing illustrations.  It was really good.  Sounds like lots of kids are pumped about being able to have tangible tools to share as well as seeing all the other kids who wanted to share but never knew how, since they all came to the thing tonight.  SM (the high school pastor) talked at the end about a bunch of stuff, I can't quite remember all of it.   The biggest thing to me tonight was how those kids feed off of SM, he has such a touch with them, a way to communicate to them, its uncanny.  I mean, I've heard him speak plenty of times, but tonight, he was right there in sync with 99% of them.   The funnest part for me tonight was teaching a few kids and leaders how to do 2 card tricks that can really be used to open the door for talking about spiritual things.  MW was probably the biggest fan, and she was actually in my group during the training.  And I had no idea that she had become a Christian through MW (another MW).  (So I like using initials...)  That was a pretty cool story! So to see 50 high schoolers come out to Gospel Night on a Saturday night.  I'm telling you, there is a generation coming up that is going to have some serious impact for the Kingdom.

       Launch B follow up  Last weekend, SPACE had a launch that centered around babies.  Making meals for people in the church that just had new babies and working at a pregnancy center.  During the intro, which had an awesome testimony from a girl at Grace that had gone through the issue, I talked about how much information there was about the prolife movement.  So much info, so much you could do, so much energy with the issue.  But  urlLink here  is an article that I think is pretty unique.  It deals with all of us because it talks about the pro-life movement from the perspective of the entertainment industry.  Wow, its got some perspective that I have a hard time even trying to think through, its that good.  And its written by the author of one of the  urlLink blogs  that I follow, who I think is doing some pretty redemptive things in Hollywood.

       Waking the Dead 2  ** It is the image of God reflected in you that so enrages hell; it is this at which the demons hurl their mightiest weapons.  -William Gurnall ** "Satan is called in Scripture the Father of Lies (John 8:44).  His very first attack against the human race was to lie to Eve and Adam about God, and where life is to be found, and what the consequences of certain actions would and would not be.  He is a master at this.  He suggests to us – as he suggested to Adam and Eve- some sort of idea or inclination or impression, and what he is seeking is a sort of ‘agreement’ on our part.  He’s hoping we will buy into whatever he is saying, offering, insinuating.  Our first parents bought into it, and look what disaster came of it.  But that story is not over.  The Evil One is still lying to us, seeking our agreement every single day." ** "The whole plan is based on agreements.  When we make those agreements with the demonic forces suggesting things to us, we come under their influence.  It becomes a kind of permissions we give the Enemy, sort of like a contract.  The bronze gates start clanging shut around us.  I’m serious – maybe half the stuff people are trying to ‘work through’ in counseling offices, or pray about in their quiet times, is simply agreements they’ve made with the Enemy.  Some foul spirit whispers, “I’m such a stupid idiot” and they agree with it; then they spend months and years trying to sort through feelings of insignificance.  They’d end their agony if they’d treat it for the warfare it is, break the agreement they’ve made, send the Enemy packing." ** "During an assault like this, you must remember:  make no agreements.  The Enemy will suggest all sorts of things.  “God doesn’t care.  You’re not worth fighting for.  Your heart doesn’t matter.  You can’t trust him.”  He is trying to kill your heart, destroy the glory of your life.  It will feel hard – really hard, almost impossible – but whatever you do, make no agreements.  You have to start there." ** "Finally, the Religious Spirit makes it next to impossible for a person to break free by spreadling the lie that “there is no war.”  Be honest.  How many Christians do you know who practice spiritual warfare as a normal, necessary, daily part of the Christian life?  We don’t sing the hymn Onward Christian Soldiers because it isn’t true.  We have acquiesced.  We have surrendered without a fight. We’ve exchanged that great hymn for a subtle but telling substitute, a song that is currently being taught to thousands of children in Sunday school each week (I’m in the Lord’s Army) There is no battle and there is no war and there is no Enemy and your life is not at stake and you are not desperately needed this very hour, but you’re in the Lord’s army.  Yes sir.  Doing what?, may I ask."  Wow, that is some heavy stuff.  It's very similar to the whole "excluded middle" that Perspectives teaches on, the idea that there is no spiritual element to life and we don't need to worry about it.  In contrast to nonWestern cultures that totally believe and act on the fact that there is indeed a middle layer - where the physical and spiritual meet, and sometimes are in conflict with one another.  We totally have acquiesced.   Reminds me of the time, and I always tell this story, when I took a group of guys to do conversational evangelism in OC, MD for a few days in the summer.  T and E were talking to this older gentleman about Jesus and life and all that, and he seemed pretty into it.  His wife came out of a store and immediately got confrontational.  Bad vibe starts there.  They go on for a bit, she is still very antagonistic.  She then looks at T and asks, "Your birthday is in May isn't it?"  And of course, it was.  Never saw her before in his life.  That night, and ever since then, I have taken the middle layer to be a lot less excluded.  I think all of us in ministry, all of us that call ourselves Christ-followers really ought to.

       21st century slavery  This report from the New York Times writes about his experience buying two girls out of slavery  urlLink here .  I can't even imagine.  The  urlLink second  installment of his series talks about the reluctance of one of the girls to actually leave and take her freedom.  It's an interesting set of observations that talk about freedom from bondage, but also acceptance when one is free. It's a whole realm of society that we don't have to deal with here in the US, and a serious opportunity to reach people that are literally captive.  Christ came to set all of us free, in order that we would be giving Him more glory.   I wonder what kind of spiritual background this guy has.

       Some serious questions about The Passion  Well, the movie certainly has gotten lots of exposure over the past few months and even more in the past few weeks.  I just linked to my friend Brian and an article he wrote about it.  But this post  urlLink here   asks some serious questions of us Christian leaders about what we promote and why or why not.... ** "However, I am curious how some evangelicals will navigate the moral trap they will set for themselves by endorsing this film. What trap is this? It is the moral dilemma of supporting a film filled with excessive violence, torture, and blasphemy - a film so bloody it has earned an R-rating simply for its gory content." ** "Christian leader, if you endorse The Passion as an evangelistic tool in spite of its R-rating, how will you keep your parishioners from attending other R-rated films?" ** "If they are willing to admit it, many evangelicals, if they are to remain consistent in their stated convictions concerning movies, will have to reject The Passion. Those who believe that the morality of a story ultimately has to do with its details (Does it contain sex, violence, or profanity?) rather than with its overall message will be forced to sanction this film with an unclean conscious." Whoa.  Yeah, he hits deep.  And he is right on. ** "If you have preached against attendance at R-rated movies, or if you have declared that a movie is immoral if it contains violence, sex, or profanity, then you are inconsistent and lacking integrity if you endorse this film. If you constantly complain about the level of violence, disturbing images, or blasphemous actions in other films, then you should do the same for The Passion." Read it for yourself and see what you think.

       Summer 2004 and "Kazakhstan or Ocean City, MD?"  Just turned in my proposal for middle and high school missions to the Youth Min team for their approval and feedback.  I'm pretty excited, I think we've got some solid goals outlined and to see them met would be huge for the Youth Ministry missions side.  I also think the MTF is going to love it and to have the church see our students taking a lead in missions would just be awesome. On a related note, K and E and a bunch of other guys are looking like they might go to Kazakhstan for a few weeks with a local, networked contact from MD.  Very very cool.  When I dream of SPACE and the progression I think it should have, something like this is the final, ultimate goal.  A team going to another culture, assisting long term missionaries in helping them with the essential task.  Wow.  And to think, in the year 2000, when I was thinking about summer missions for my dteam, and wanting them to progress through certain experiences, with the end goal of ministry on the beach in Ocean City, MD - that was a pretty cool idea.  It never panned out because those guys didn't get a sense of this kind of thing until probably very late in their senior year.  But as I was thinking about it earlier this week, K and E have fulfilled this dream of mine, they will just end up in Kazakhstan instead of Ocean City.  Hey, it's close... I know I've posted this many, many times here, but this job I have is the coolest one on Earth.  And what's even wackier, is that its not really a job.  Well, it sort of is....

       Reconnect  I was up surfing around one night a few weeks ago and googled an old friend of mine, and lo and behold, I found him.   urlLink Brian Goins  and I worked together during the summer of 1991 at Camp Shenandoah Springs as counselors.  It was a pretty awesome 7 weeks, and pretty formative for me as I look back on it now, due to a few reasons: - Brian was a big influence on me in terms of youth ministry.  Even though I had been doing lots of volunteering as a youthworker in a local church, it never occurred to me that it was more than just something fun to do, a community service, etc.  Brian was compelled to, called to, defined by - ministry to young people.  I specifically remember him getting broken at talking about how little time was left in the summer, that our time to transform them was so short.  After that summer, I began to really think about a calling to youth ministry.  I don't think I ever thought of it that way before meeting and working with Brian, and certainly have continued to think and act upon the call since then.  (Even though I have tried to get out of it... it seems like I can never leave it) - I had worked in one specific summer camp experience, and Shenandoah Springs really threw me out of context, in the best way possible.  That summer, I got to work in a co-ed Christian camp, which I had never done before.  I had also got to work with some really quality counselors, people that had God set apart first, and were devoted to students in ways that were incredibly sacrificial.  They gave it all, 24x7, to these kids. - I had just graduated college and was on my way to grad school in the fall.  It was a great way to spend the summer without having financial worries, etc.  Just loads of fun. I always knew he would do something significant for the Kingdom.   urlLink Here  is a recent article by Brian about The Passion.

       Launch B  SPACE Launch B was today.  Great great fun.  Good turnout.  It was all about babies.  Made meals for people at GCC that just had babies and then worked at  urlLink Laurel Preg Center  helping them get some stuff done.  Very cool. I had some personal trouble putting together the talk for the beginning of it.  The whole abortion issue gets heated so fast, Christians can get so angry and judgemental about the whole thing.  Plus, I was way late in terms of thinking about it and getting the other logistics done for it.  Last night, we bought most of the raw ingredients, cooked and cut 15 pounds of chicken, and baked two batches of brownies.  It wasn't too bad, but it just made for a tough Friday night, the night before a Launch.  And the directions, the recipes, the stuff to give to the people we made food for.  The talk was the last thing on my mind.  In many ways, relating to some of the posts below, not much time or attention to listening for God speaking. Despite that, it worked.  Kids came, served, got first hand experience about the issue. The hands down best part of it all - Kelly'sf friend came and spoke about her experience getting an abortion as a teenager, getting pregnant in her 20s and deciding she could never do that again, making it as a single parent, and then finding Christ and being able to be forgiven after 10 years, not only forgiving herself, but experiencing God's forgiveness in a real and tangible way.  Her story was intense. Check out some pictures  urlLink here.

       K and E  Had a great time with K and E tonight.  Great to reconnect with these two Dteam guys, as well as eat Chinese food, replace my car battery in -10 degrees, and eat some more food. Talked at length about lots of good stuff, including summer missions for them (they are putting their own team of 8 guys together), the theory of "Leave One Man Behind", and being intentional and teaching young high school students to be intentional.  Lots of good conversation, I even had a cup of coffee... That's how good it was.  (I only drink coffee for special occasions... NOT.  The waitress offered it to me for free instead of paying for OJ.) Good guys.  Even after being 'done' with Dteam03 for almost a year, I am still reaping the fruit of it.  These guys continue to sharpen me, they long to reach people with the Gospel, they want to continue the traditions that we built in Dteam extending them to the new crop of students, and they love to hang out, converse and have fun.  It is a true joy. Also came up with a list of questions for their meeting with a missionary contact for this coming summer.  Very cool.

       God Speaking  More from Waking the Dead  - But I don’t think he speaks to me any more than others; I think I’ve just learned to expect it, need it, keep an eye out for it.  It’s a whole different perspective on how we approach our day.  Either we wake to tackle our ‘to do’ list, get things done, guided by our morals and whatever clarity we may at the moment have (both rather lacking to the need, I might add).  Or we wake in the midst of a dangerous Story, as God’s intimate ally, following him into the unknown. If you are not pursuing a dangerous quest with your life, well then you don’t need a Guide.  If you haven’t found yourself in the midst of a ferocious war, then you won’t need a seasoned Captain.  But if you intend to live in the Story that God is telling, and if you want the life he offers, then you are going to need more than a handful of principles, however noble they may be. - A personal walk with God comes to us through wisdom and revelation.  You will soon discover that we need both. - Wisdom is crucial.  But it is not enough.  Many well-meaning evangelicals rely on it exclusively.  That is why their lives remain where they are – rather short of all Christ promised. - We begin by assuming that God is still speaking. John 16:12-13 John 8:47 John 10:2-4,11 Many good people never hear God speak to them personally for the simple fact that they’ve never been told that he does.  But he does – generously, intimately. Now it doesn’t happen in an instant.  Walking with God is a way of life.  It’s something to be learned; our ability to hear God’s voice and discern his word to us grows over time.  We have an eye out for his particular word to us, and we learn as we go along. Notice that we must ask.  And we will sometimes struggle to hear and struggle with what we hear.  But personally, it’s worth it.  I’m after the path of life – and he alone knows it.  I've tried this of late, sort of.  I started recently just asking God about some stuff and trying to hone in on specific thoughts that would come in after this.  A few of them came in: - Saturday night I had this name just pop into my head, the last name of some friends from GCC.  They have daughters the same age as ours and go to our school too.  Anyway, turns out, he was in the hospital all weekend. - Felt the moving of a name and a specific topic of conversation I could bring up with someone at work - AR.  Brought it up today, he was overwhelemingly receptive to it, in fact, felt like he could use some advice about the topic and wanted to follow up at a later date.   Hmmm.  Wow...  Things like the above, and the story with CW, make me feel like I am making more of an impact than ever, in all facets of life.  It's cool.  Not only making an impact, but that God is really impacting my life of late, in terms of growth, development, ministry, etc.  It's really very cool.  Wow.

       What did the Agnostic say upon arriving in Hell?  "I can't believe this is happening to me!"  hardy har har  A joke from the comments from this  urlLink blog , written by Director of Act One: Writing for Hollywood.  The specific post is titled "WE MIGHT STOP SENDING MISSIONARIES TO THE THIRD WORLD NOW"  Of course, I don't agree with the premise - of not sending missionaries to the Third World, because our own celebreties here in Hollywood are so distant from God.  But the point is interesting in terms of ministry and reaching our own culture with the Gospel. We must keep in mind, our culture is within reach of the existing Church.  The crux is that the Church here is not doing a good job transforming what is already in reach.  The "Third World" she refers to, that is unreached.  0 chance to hear the Gospel at all.   I like her writing, and its neat to hear an 'inside' track to Hollywood.  Missions minded or not, we are all affected, and addicted I think, to  Hollywood and entertainment at some level, just from living here in the US.

       A Very Bad Definition of Missions   urlLink This  article gave me lots of things to disagree with.  I strongly dislike the definition of 'missions' the author is propogating here.   "Reaching out to people, or “missions,” is best defined as loving people." Uh, no, sorry.  Missions is not just reaching out to people.   Yuck.  If we keep on telling people thats what missions is, the nations will NEVER be reached.  NEVER.  What would compel someone to go with a definition like that.  I mean, why even bother??   But alas, I think there is hope with one of the comments from the story.  Tyler Watts, nice!

       Dreaming about space  SPACE core meeting tonight - very fun.  We met at the  urlLink Mall .  I know, talk about crazy.  Take ADHD high schoolers to the mall to have a meeting....  But actually, it was very cool. Saw tons of their friends, and they all were like, what are you doing, and who are you with?  haha.  Pay no attention to me, even though I look like I'm 16.   I had them dream with me what a service project looks like, but not a normal one, instead a wacky one, that no one else would do.  Not for any reason.  And they did it, they came up with two.  The next two.  Awesome, because in a sense, that is indigenous leadership.  I'm just here to be the catalyst, the vision, you bring something to the table. I also had them do this weird thing - pray for three stores in the mall.  So there was 5 of them, I thought maybe they would just go off by themselves and find 3 stores and pray, kind of nonchalantly.  But they all went together, and at each store, they got in a circle and held their hands.  Wow.  Totally not what I would have expected.  Of course, the key to it, the reason why, was to get them to think about life strategically.  While most if not all of the people in the mall are buying stuff or whatever, you are thinking about how you could pray, which stores to pray for, and how to bring the Kingdom here.  Honestly, it made me feel somewhat like a terrorist, when I started to think like that.  What is the most strategic and why.  Very interesting.  It was very cool.   Oh, and the 3 stores - A&F (of course), Motherhood Maternity (a surprise to me too, but what a great great GREAT idea), and  urlLink Hot Topic .  (One of my mentors prays for Hot Topic every time he walks by it) Did I tell you, this is the COOLEST job in the world....

       Bad Books  I might be really dense... But  urlLink here  is a list of bad books, designated by this Discerning Reader thing.  I was really intruiged, because they have some serious knowledge with the collection of books.  But why would they put Purpose Driven Life and Waking the Dead on there.  I mean, sure, they aren't huge tomes of thought, they have gotten eaten up by the masses, but is there something fundamentally wrong with them?  Is there bad theology in them?  Are they unbiblical?  Am I so unlearned that I am missing the whole construct?  If you know, please tell me, if you think I can grasp it.  And even something by Erwin McManus (whom I've never read, but am pretty sure I'm going to  urlLink Origins  in May.)

       Vegemite  Got together with the  urlLink 03 boys  tonight.  Very cool.  We basically went around and told stories from this past semster/year.  It was really fun, just to hear how they are doing and how God is moving in their lives.  Interestingly enough, all of them that were there went to Urbana.  It really was a great time.  The funniest part was the Vegemite eating contest, thanks for Ryan.  Andrew was the funniest, poor guy.  Very encouraging, God's word is bearing fruit.

       Wake Me Up  “Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.  Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.  It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us.  We ask ourselves, ‘Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous?’  Actually, who are you not to be?  You are a child of God.  Your playing small doesn’t serve the world.  There’s nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won’t feel insecure around you.  We were born to manifest the glory of God that is within us… And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.  As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.”  Nelson Mandela  Member class, doctrine class, small group, Christian growth, evangelism class, courses on finance and marriage and parenting, leadership training class, hermeneutics, spiritual gifts, biblical counseling, participate in missions, carry a significant local church ministry load. (my paraphrase) You could earn an MBA with less effort.  But let me ask you:  A program like this – does it teach a person how to apply principles or how to walk with God?  They are not the same thing.  Change the content and any cult could do this.  Gandhi, Confucius, Jefferson, they all had principles for a better life.  But only Christianity can teach you to walk with God. We forfeit that birthright when we take folks through a discipleship program whereby they master any number of Christian precepts and miss the most important thing of all, the very thing for which we were created: intimacy with god. Truth be told, you couldn’t master enough principles to see you safely through this Story.  There are too many surprises.   Only by walking with God can we hope to find the path that leads to life.  That is what it means to be a disciple.  After all, aren’t we followers of Christ?  Then by all means, let’s actually follow him.  Not ideas about him, not just his principles.  Him.  A personal walk with God comes to us through wisdom and revelation.  You will soon discover that we need both. When the apostles needed the help of some good men to shepherd the exploding new church, they chose men “full of the Spirit and wisdom” Acts 6:3.  The two go together; we need both.   God has given us all sort of counsel and direction in his written Word; thank God we have it written down in black and white.   We would do well to be familiar with it, study it with all the intensity of the men who studied the maps of the Normandy coastline before they hit the beaches on D-Day.  The more that wisdom enters our hearts, the more we will be able to trust our hearts in difficult situations.  Notice that wisdom is not cramming our heads with principles.  It is developing a discerning heart.  What made Solomon such a sharp guy was his wise and discerning heart.  I Kings 3:9  The particular foolishness of the church in the past century was Reason above all else.  The result has been a faith stripped of the supernatural, the Christianity of tips and techniques.  We have our morals and we have our precepts, but where is the living God?  Just a few of my notes from  urlLink Waking the Dead

       My Neighbor or His Neighbor?  Here is an interesting op-ed piece by Franklin Graham, son of Billy Graham, president of Samartian's Purse.  Of course, he's been very controversial of late with 9/11 and his comments about Islam and such.  He is speaking about Sudan, here are a few snippets:  - "The leader of one of the earth's most repressive Islamic regimes pledged, "We have to be sure the freedom of religion of Christians is not less than the freedom of Islam."" - "Who will help restore peace and order? Who will hold the government accountable for its promises? Who will help rebuild homes and churches? Who will give medical attention to broken bodies and encouragement to wounded souls?     I assured everyone I met with that we would. "We" — the world's humanitarian organizations,including Samaritan's Purse. "We" —the Church of Jesus Christ, extending the hand of the Good Samaritan to those in need, Christian and Muslim. And, I pray, "we"-the United States of America and every member of the international community that loves freedom." - ""Mr. President," I said, "you have an opportunity to be that good Samaritan, stopping to help a hurting country and reaching out to all the people of Sudan." With God's help, we can all be good Samaritans. "  Reminds me of the message Pastor M gave on the parable of the Good Samaritan - the idea being that the real question is not "Who is my neighbor?" but "Who is my neighbor's neighbor?"  Don't worry if it confuses you, it also continues to confuse me...  urlLink Here  is the whole article.

       Missionaries for Dinner  Had dinner with the  urlLink Penleys  tonight.  Very cool.  Talked about the future and Australia, but mainly just hung out and ate really good food.  We told them how much Grace loves them, its so true.  Pastor M talked about them in church yesterday, a great story.  So cool.   They are my inside track to sending students to Australia....

      I'm back.  After driving from Baltimore to Savannah, then to Orlando, and back....  Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all.  One of the things I'm pondering is turning some of this stuff into an email newsletter.  If this sounds interesting to you, let me know via the comments.   urlLink Good  article about how the face of people going to food shelters is changing - now its mostly single mothers with children instead of homeless people.  World Relief  urlLink write up  about the earthquake in Iran.  50K people dead so far...  Note that Iran is one of Clive Calver's favorite churches in the world.  Interesting, what REALLY is going on here?  (One of the questions I keep thinking of after reading parts of _Waking the Dead_ by Eldrege)  On the Urbana front, wow!  Lots of good feedback, 23 people went from GCC, most if not all loved it.  I did some of the intervewing of some of them to the Body at large on Sunday morning and hosted a party for them on Sunday night.  The GCC MTF donated about $2500 in scholarship funds, very cool, the real deal.  The party was so great, loads and loads of fun and it was really good for them, they just needed to talk about it and share.  The more I think about it, it was a debrief that needed to be done.  So very good.  And Deanna and I just loved hearing them talk about it.  Very fun, and some very funny stories.  We made up some campy questions too that they had to answer, like "Describe the most interesting person you met that was not from Grace.", stuff like that.  Wow, it was a long day.   I think these students are on the cutting edge of what missions for Grace, the whole model of missions at Grace is going to change....

       Spiritual Attack   From my journal...  The past two weeks have been pretty rough – work has been very busy.  Not only busy.  But lots of production work, lots of outages.  We had a release over last weekend, nothing went right.  We were really over time, two releases (core and DS) in one weekend, DDL blew up, perf problems on Monday.  Then we had another one to setup some database infrastructure for NJ this past weekend.  Again.  Bad task plans, faulty passwords, and the final straw, Shareplex activation that just wouldn’t work. These things are tested, just like always. Deanna said to me this morning, “Is someone sabotaging you?” That got me to really do some thinking. And I think the answer is yes. This is probably the busiest time for SPACE yet, simply because the tone of the summer needs to get launched.  Four trips, all with parent meetings, forms, packets, PR.  Not to mention scheduling all of this in between two retreats in one month.  And finding this one set of leaders for 9th grade…  What’s most strategic for the enemy to win?  For these trips to fall apart.  For me to get so busy with work I have no time for anything else.  For my job to suffer, especially with me having a new boss – Ken, that all of the security we counted on for doing both Verizon and a commitment to students falls by the wayside.  For me to say that work is much too important to be involved in church stuff.  Hmm. So this morning I had a pretty dialogue with God about this stuff, on the way to get McDonalds for everyone.  Asking Him to keep Satan out of the picture, to protect me, to protect my relationship with Ken, the integrity of my team, to keep the releases working the right way.  We will never know what went wrong with some of that stuff.  I remember saying to D this morning, “I feel like everything I’m doing at work fails”  I continued to pray that I would make no agreements with Satan.  I’m not at fault, I’m not a terrible manager, my team is not falling apart.  That God would allow things at work to flow smoothly in order that I would be able to continue to make the SPACE trips work out.  And that we would find a leader for 9th grade. I’m convinced now, after thinking about it all day, that the software problems at work, and the fallout associated, all stem from me doing something that Satan does not like.  It’s a spiritual battle, and Satan is using something as generic as software to attack me on a level associated with my job.  In our Western worldview, we don’t believe that Satan would be able to use something as benign as software to wage a spiritual war.  But I believe it, it certainly is a battle and I’m finally seeing what is really going on here.

       Summer Missions 1  Our first parents meeting for one of the summer mission trips is tonight, I'm excited.  I'm excited to see the kids that are interested, to meet their parents, to see the leaders of this team - who are also the grade small group leaders - run the show and share their thoughts.  I'm also excited to share the overall vision of SPACE missions with these parents.  I think it's going to be lots of fun, I hope they get the vision for what we could do when the youth ministry gets smart, strategic and full bore about Biblical missions. Here are some of the questions we are using on our trip application: *What are your reasons for wanting to go on this trip?  *List specific personal goals you have for this trip? *What or who sparked your interest in missions? *How do your parents/guardians feel about you going on this trip?  Do you have their complete support? *Do you have any medical or psychological concerns that could affect your performance on this trip? *Who is your favorite bible character and why? *If you were stranded on a desert island, what five things would you want to have with you and why?  Please list them in order of importance to you. *What is your favorite movie and in what way do you relate to it? *What has God been teaching you lately? *What are your views, as a Christian, on: -	Alcohol and drug consumption -	Christian sexual conduct -	Choice of entertainment/media  Had a conversation with our good friend, CA, who are missionaries with  urlLink Open Air Campaigners  here in Baltimore, about their summer plans.  Very exciting.  They also mentioned an international student ministry at Hopkins they have started to get plugged into, which was mostly Chinese students.  That sounds like a lot of fun.  I think one different thing SPACE could really have fun doing would be something with international students, talk about the great need in where we live, a potentially really big impact to the 10/40 window, and getting kids to understand a bit about culture and such.  Went to a girl scout Daisies "Thinking Day" with my 6 year old last night.  The theme was ancient Egypt.  Let's just say that not too much of it was about Egypt.  Two things bothered me - First, they had some 4th and 5th graders explaining what the Egyptians thought about the afterlife, to kindergartenders among others.   This wasn't that big of a deal, I'm just glad that our daughter is pretty spiritual sharp, or at least, I would like to think so.  It was a good source of conversation for us.  Secondly, they had this 'skit' at the end which had nothing to do with Egypt.  Instead, the gist was a 'dance' at the end in which the girls encouraged other girls to show off their 'booty.'  Uh yeah.  I was more in shock than anything else, and I think, and would like to hope, that other parents were too.  Did we learn nothing from the Super Bowl?  Is undecency that laughable?  Do we think its ok to show something like that to 6 year old girls?  I don't think I'm making too much out of this, the more I ponder it, the more hot I get.  And I thought, like a crazy person, that this whole evening might have been a good cross cultural experience for my 6 year old.  Well, it certainly was a good culture lesson, lets just say...

To all of you that have come here from that link/email - Welcome!  My hope is that this can be an encouragement to you who work with students day in and day out.  Drop me a line, I would love to hear more about your ministry and to hear about what is going on with students all around the world...

       Food becomes the Enemy  Food is never my enemy.  But a very very interesting article  urlLink here  about how eating disorders are affecting younger and younger kids.  I see it with my older daughter, the other day she talked about going on a diet.  She is 6.  Not to mention, it seems like everyone around me is on a diet.  But not me, like I said, food and I are friends... - ''The way this country deals with food is not normal,'' said Dr. Rosina Pellerano, who specializes in eating disorders. ``It's about using food as a vehicle to deal with stressors. And it's not going away.'' - "Studies have shown that after seven years of treatment, about half of anorexics recover fully. A third continue to struggle. More than 10 percent die from the disease, which has the highest mortality of any mental disorder." Wow...  So, the odds are that someone in your circle of students that you minister to is dealing with this, either directly or indirectly.  I think its two-fold, reacting and helping kids in crisis, and (and I think this is big) helping kids that haven't run into these issues yet deal with the right way to look at self-image, food, etc.   It's one of the things that I have against Barbies... Not that they are terrible, with two little girlies, we have quite a few of them.  And the girls just LOVE them.  But I want them to grow up with a worldview of who God created them to be, and what that means in relation to the way they look, and all that.  You guys know what I mean...

       Day Job Just About Kills Tony  My day job has just about killed me this past weekend.  Of course, its a day job, for which I worked all night long.  Most of my job is managing software engineers working on specific versions of software, and our biggest and most important tasks are putting these versions in production systems, with real users.  Just about all of these upgrades are done on weekends when users are not on the systems.  In this weekend's case, we had loads of problems, and even late on Monday evening, are still dealing with fallout....

       Helping missionaries  Just got a cool email from a missionary from GCC.  Talking about the idea of sending a youth team to work with them, probably not this summer though.  J has outlined some of the things they have had people do, even without being able to speak the language.  This is good info - people sometimes think they can't do anything unless they know the lanaguage, but it really isn't true. Also reminds me of the missions trip I heard about where the people went and didn't have a set place to stay.  They were taught a few phrases in the language such as 'I am an American interested in learning about your culture,' and 'I am looking for a place to live with someone from your culture.'  The people on the trip all found places to live before they got off the plane trip. == "Typically, young people who've come out have been involved in a wide variety of activities depending on their length of stay, including homestays with nationals (both Muslim and Christian), ministry (friendship ev) to English-speaking collegians, leading English camps for young people on a remote island where one of our focus unreached groups lives, experiencing language and culture acquisition, and also serving our local team here (teaching VBS to our kids, baby-sitting, etc.).  There's actually quite a bit they're able to do here just with speaking English.  One of the highlights for our kids has been to have "big sisters and brothers" stay with us during part of their visits (usually during the orientation periods). "

       Pipeline  Lots of stuff in the pipeline.  I'm finding that when you work on specific pieces of work, which have milestones, you need to be looking down the road to what is next, while putting the finishing touches on what is almost done.  I've been doing this for years with work since we work on 'releases' of software, that require plans and designs for the future, before the current one has gone to market.  I'm finding the same kind of pace with ministry tasks.  It's good though, because I seem to take to it pretty readily. So my pipeline looks like this right now: - LC homeless day debriefing - tomorrow - Info to SPACE crew about summer mission trip - Finalize middle school missions weekend with  urlLink CMTS  - Finding key leader(s) for  urlLink SEMP  for 9th graders (in the next 2 weeks) ** my biggest risk  right now, pray for it! - Mission trips prep - 5 meetings, guest speakers, dates, locations, etc. - CSM mission trip parent meeting - 2/28 - Pre CpR retreat plan meeting - 2/29 - CpR retreat workcrew staffing - 3/6 - April SPACE Launch - prob high school only - maybe a construction thing - KC is really running with this, which is good - May SPACE Launch - end of year something big It's pretty busy right now, but I love it.

       A good problem to have  So you have this pretty dynamic youth ministry, that seems to be attracting loads and loads of students.  And you start to build in a piece of the program centered around strategic community service and missions.  And for one of your service launches, you get close to 50 kids that show up.  That's a problem, true?  Yes, but a good problem to have.  But it is, nonetheless, a problem. Here are some things that I see about it: - With that quantity, certain ministries will not host you.  You can't walk into an inner city ministry with 50 kids from the suburbs.  It would never work.  And it doesn't fit their style of indigenous ministry. - Certain other projects would be great with that many kids.  For instance, a Habitat for Humanity project, possibly.  As long as the host ministry could really utilize all those people. - Maybe we have to get to the point where we have the same theme for a day, split the kids into smaller groups, working with different ministries around town doing the same kind of thing, and then at the end, regroup and debrief.  Sure does make for a pretty complex day though.  And lots of volunteers. The more this year goes along and the more launches we do, I'm seeing this whole job of mine in a few interesting terms: - Definitely lots of event planning.  This year was the first year in student ministry that I dealt with school buses and rental vans.  It's a good thing. - A bit of networking.  People have started calling me asking about contact info to other places to serve.  That's a good thing too. - I think the biggest and most important part is the shepherding and vision casting.  The SPACE crew is a major motivation for me.  To build into these kids, to have them step up to be leaders in this, to get them to 'get it.'  It's huge, fun, a passion of mine.  It also fills a void because I think I need students to be working with. Anyway, I'm just talking off the top of my head.  Good stuff.

       Homeless Debrief  I've got the privilege to do a debriefing for a bunch of middle school kids going to feed the homeless this Saturday.  Should be very fun, I'm excited.  A lady at GCC, CS, who helps out with middle school, has been very involved in ministries to the homeless around Baltimore, Columbia and DC.  She has hooked up with the guy who runs CSM in DC and he pointed her to three parks that would be safe for middle schoolers.  So she took the initiative to invite certain kids to this thing on Saturday, and I think she is going to do more stuff centered around homeless people and students.  It's very cool, she really has a heart for the intersection of both.  I'm excited to see how it grows, and it will be a neat module to SPACE, or something similar. Of course, on Saturday, everything else in the world is happening too.  We have our Parents Panel we are participating in.  We'll have to go tell these folks we have no idea about what we are doing as parents, seeing as Emily has climbing all over furniture to steal whatever she is not allowed to have.  Markers, chocolate candy, medicine.  Tonight I found a dropper and an empty bottle of Infant Tylenol Cold.  Good thing most of it was already gone.  No wonder she took a nap today... Saturday's plans also include a neighborhood potluck, which will be great fun, with awesome food.  And I have a production release I have to work.  That's not always fun, but its a living.  And a good chance to have some good conversations with the people I work with.

       What I really enjoy  I have to come to understand, a little bit better, that I really relish in the opportunities to take kids on these kinds of service/mission opportunities.  When asked about passion, one of the questions is 'What keeps you up at night, that you dream about?'  My answer, mostly, has been, taking kids on missions trips.  I think Perspectives helped hone that vision and implementation, in terms of what was really "missions".  But seeing what happened on Saturday, having to problem solve on the fly, seeing kids out of their elements, talking to kids about what our real goals were, actually being out 'in the field' with them, man, that was so cool stuff.  I know some people would have a large amount of disdain for being with teenagers all day, having plans fall through, all the unknowns between numbers of kids, activities that might not have worked, Senior Citizen residents that loved bingo more than visitors, etc.   But I think all that makes it a lot more interesting.  After all, if things just flop, we can say that the whole SPACE program is just an experiement this year...  No one says it has to continue...  haha... of course, I'm kidding myself, and I'm kidding you.   My hope is that youthworkers all around have the same kind of motivation for the work they are doing with students.  My prayer, if you are a youthworker reading this, full time or not, paid or not, whatever age, is that you are living with this kind of passion and desire that I am, that thinking about building the next generation of Kingdom seekers keeps you up at night, that God's mercy for you is so good - you HAVE to pass it on, that God is worthy of all praise and that every student should have a chance to testify to His goodness, that students are one of the best plans God has for the world...

       Launch S Followup  Here is what I wrote to my prayer team about Launch S... Thought I would post it even though I wrote details about it the other day too. Pictures can be found on my  urlLink fotoblog . (TS, one of the SPACE team kids decided we should start calling the team 'SPACE crew'.  I dig it.)   Hi friends,  Thanks for supporting and praying for Launch S.  Here are some details:  - 49 students and leaders - Threw a beach party for residents at Sunrise Assisted Living in Columbia, with the intention of engaging people in conversations about true love - Had cookie decorating, valentine card making, bingo and poker with residents. - Was ready for some worship time and one of the students giving a Gospel presentation... But --- We had too many people and it wasn't working out for Sunrise, so they very politely asked us to leave...  - We then had lunch in the Hickory Ridge Village Center, did worship and the Gospel talk right there in front of Giant...  - And then made and gave out around 200 valentine cards to residents at Lorien Nursing & Rehabilitation Center, right up the road.  Not exactly what we had planned, but we got to hopefully impact two nursing homes, a bunch of people in the Village Center and had kids thinking about how to be strategic about the real meaning of true love.  Thank YOU for your support!  - the SPACE crew

       Ministry Weekend  Wow, lots to write about from this weekend. First - had lunch with one of my student leaders from when I led a dteam.  MG was a senior when my guys were freshmen and he helped me lead that whole first year.  Wow, was that bumpy...  MG also helped me lead our team to SEMP in 1999.  He is now getting ready to graduate from college, wow how time flies.  Anyway, he is involved with Navigators and UMCP and excited about the future, working, and helping out at GCC with Young Adults.  Very cool.  He is also going to come back and help with the CpR sunday teaching team.  It's a great opportunity for him to help and also figure more about his gifting.  He is contemplating some ministry future, I predict it will happen. One thing about MG - I've never seen a guy with such a compassionate heart.  I always wondered how a ministry cultivated that.  I've come to realize that a ministry doesn't, but parents do.  I think the SPACE crew is probably a good example of that.  The SPACE launch was on Saturday.  We had 49 students and leaders.  Like whoa.  We went to our nursing home with some pretty good plans and it was working out ok, I thought.  But it wasn't.  So they asked us to leave.  Don't get me wrong, they were really nice about it, and if it isn't working out for the hosting ministry, we really do need to leave.  So we left.  Before we actually left, I sent KC up to another nursing home to see if they could use us, one within walking distance.  Since we had about 2 hours to kill.  And no way to transport 49 people.  They said we could come and pass out valentine cards so we did that.  In the meantime, we had lunch outside, in 30 degree weather, at the Village Center.  About half of us were wearing beach clothes - sandals, skirts, shorts, etc.  Very funny.  One of our students did some worship, and Leslie did her talk anyway.  Seeing all those kids out there, worshipping, not caring who was watching or what they were thinking, better than any Launch I could have planned on my own.  We then went up to the 2nd nursing home and the kids handed out about 175 valentine cards.  Really worked out pretty well...  Had lunch today with TP.  TP is an 03 dteam guy, who has had significant battles with substance abuse since 10th grade.  It's sad because before that, he was pretty sold out to Jesus.  His life has since been a downward spiral, including a ream of counselors, outpatient therapy, inpatient therapy, expulsion from public school, and most recently, a very bad car accident while he was intoxicated which could have easily ended his life.  His overall temperament today was 'tired.'  Part of him is tired of fighting this battle, part of him cannot give it up.  I'm at a loss on how to help him anymore.  It's sad.  Did we fail him as a student ministry.  Do student ministries fail students?  Or have families failed students long before those students enter our ministries?  Went to a parents meeting tonight with some LC leaders that are taking some LC kids to feed the homeless next Saturday in DC.  It was a good turnout, and the kids and their parents are some solid people.  Interesting to consider how the future of CpR will change as these kids enter high school.  Wow.  A busy ministry weekend. PS - D and I had a good time for VDay, in case you thought I didn't do anything.  The girlies went out with Grandpa and Granny.  Their first words to us when we came to pick them up were, 'Go away.'  And to think we actually got bored at the Mall by ourselves...

       Stevens   urlLink Listen  to Jarrett Stevens.  He is a teaching pastor at one of the Willow Creek gen X ministries, I think.  Anyway, him and his wife Jeanne spoke at our CpR retreats for a few years in a row.  Awesome speakers, but moreso than that, they realized that real ministry happens in relationships, among small groups of people.  So with every retreat, they met with us leaders and : - asked if there were any big issues in our ministry that they could address as guest speakers.  One year, one of our students was killed in a car accident the Friday morning that all the kids left for the retreat.  They listened, and used it during their sessions. - ALWAYS emphasized that we, as the small group leaders, are the catalysts of change.  They always had 3 follow up questions we could take from their talks and use in group time, which was always right after a session. The dynamic that they had as the spoke together was so great.  I haven't listened to the whole message, but I'm sure its a good one.

       SM  I've written about SM, our high school pastor, at least once before.   He's the real deal.  At CpR, we do outreaches every other Friday night, where kids are encouraged and challenge to bring their friends, be part of the team putting the whole night together, etc.  It's pretty cool, and was one of the big things that impressed me when we first came to GCC.  Student led, leader driven, kind of thing.  Kids are up front in the band, leading worship, in the dramas, sharing how God is leading them, doing the Gospel presentation, etc.  It's really indigenous leadership, if you think about youth as a totally different culture, which I do.  So, in terms of a mission mindset, if I am the outsider coming in to 'plant a church' per se, I've got to reach a set of people in the culture, win them to Christ, and have them share with their own culture, and build a church that resembles and respects what their culture looks like.  I like to think that CpR, and specifically SM (since it was his whole idea) are on the right track. So much of how God has grown it is the foundation for SPACE, for at least what a service-missions focused piece of ministry looks like at GCC.  It's cool to see.  And the feedback from people about us engaging kids in community service has been overwhelming.  People love it.  Even more, kids love it.  We are ministering, and enabling, a generation that doesn't want to just sit around when it comes to spirituality.  They need to live it, express it, model it.  It's a breath of fresh air compared to when I was in high school.  Like, how much of a loser was I?  The kids these days are on a totally different plane. So I digress...  Last Friday, we had the All Around the World Party, as one of the CpR outreaches.  They decorated the main sanctuary (big church) into Italy, Mexico and China, and had all this food, drinks, waiters and waitresses.  It was really incredible.  All told, they had over 100 adult volunteers to help put it together, all the food details and clean up.  When it was over, the kids went back across the street to the Warehouse and these people just packed it up and cleaned it up.  I was left with such awe, because they did whatever they needed to so that other adults could go back over with the students for the rest of the outreach night...  GCC loves their high schoolers!! I did some magic tricks during the eating part, it was kind of cool.  The two tricks I did were tricks that sort of told the Gospel story, in small tidbits.  It was neat to really try it out on a lot of people, and I think it worked - people listened, it got their attention and they really listened to the point.  And my overall goal was really to talk to new people, and have the friends that brought them be able to follow up about a conversation about spiritual things. When the whole thing was done, SM asked me to continue to give him feedback about how these outreaches go, what they should look like, etc.  It was very flattering.  He said, "You have an evangelists heart like me."  That was quite unexpected...  I don't think I really do, I don't stay up late at night thinking about bringing people to Christ, do I?  I do stay up thinking about how to engage the students we have into thinking the right way about missions, about what this summer's missions trips are going to look like, about how much fun I'm going to have with some of these kids that are so precious to Jesus...

       Launch S prayer letter  Hi friends!  Would you say a quick prayer for this Saturday if you remember? We are doing our next SPACE Launch, its called Launch S. We are taking about 30 middle and high schoolers to a nursing home in Columbia and throwing a Valentines Day/Beach party. We are going to have some games, snacks, crafts, etc.  Probably the biggest thing you could pray for is that we are able to communicate the meaning of true love to some of the people that live there. Some specific things that we have planned include: - an activity where residents tell us their 'true love' story. We will have a computer and print out their story on some LLUUUV paper.  A perfect lead in to have someone share their definition of true love. - some students will be leading a time of worship. - one student (Leslie) will be doing a Gospel presentation.  I'm excited, I think its going to be a lot of fun as well as be pretty strategic both in the lives of these students and the people we come in to contact with. Thanks!  Yours, tony

       Mission incubator  I love to just surf through different church's websites and see what have listed under missions.  It's intruiging to try and filter to see what other people think about missions and how their church defines it.  I think much of it starts with the church's mission statement and then filters down into what they are doing about it.  Anyway,  urlLink this  page is kind of cool, they call it a mission incubator - whose goal is "to mobilize every member to become involved in ministry or mission."  I like it, its crisp.  Got it from the blog of  urlLink Dave  and the church he works for.

       Spencer Burke's Making Sense of Church  Picked these up at  urlLink Justins  blog. Good way of thinking...     * Tour Guide to Traveler - a Conversation about Leadership     * Teacher to Facilitator - a Conversation about Learning     * Hero to Human - a Conversation about Spiritual Growth     * Consumer to Steward - a Conversation about Ministry     * Retailer to Wholesaler - A Conversation about Missions     * Adversary to Ally - a Conversation about Faith     * Warrior to Gardener - a Conversation about Evangelism  I really like the Facilitator one.  And the Retailer to Wholesaler has me intruiged.  I'll probably have to pick up the book.  All of it reminds me about the  urlLink Perspectives  ideas about  learner, trader and story teller.   urlLink Here  is another article that expands on those ideas.

       The Grammys  I liked the show overall, it was pretty entertaining.  I have to admit, one of my main objectives was to try to stay in touch with popular and youth culture, I guess that's what happens when you are almost 35 *yikes*...  Anyway, although I think I achieved my goal, I'm not sure how in touch youth are with the Grammys.  Do high schoolers really watch the show, or care?  It almost seems more like the establishment that so much of youth is always trying to rebel against.  I mean, who cares how many albums they sell and stuff like that?  And who really votes to decide who the winner is?  Isn't it just a big bunch of corporate boondoggles? Well, it doesn't really matter...  I had fun, and to see Prince was pretty funny too. I have to admit though, the below was probably my favorite.  Those guys sounded really good.

       A Conspiracy of Married People  I walked in to the service yesterday from watching some of my SPACE kids talk about the next launch for Light Company (our middle school ministry) over at the Warehouse.  D had saved me a seat so I sat down.  She pointed to the guy in front of me and asked if I knew him.  I said no.  She then proceeded to tell me that this guy sat down in a seat the lady next to him was saving for her husband.  Not only that, when she told him, he said, basically, 'since he isn't here, he isn't sitting here...' or something to that effect.  He also shoved all of her stuff off of the seat.  Of course, they went on back and forth for a little bit.  Totally rude.  Incredible.  We just could not get over it.  Needless to say, it blew Pastor M's message for us, which makes me pretty irate now that I think about it more and more.  D had to leave for a few minutes she was so incensed. I decided during the message that I was going to say something to him right when it was over.  Maybe he was a visitor, maybe he got confused, maybe he's had a rough morning.  I thought, I talk about how this is really my church, how we belong here, how I help out with students, that gives me - almost entitles me- to a sense of ownership.  What happens here really is important to me.  I belong here.  Things that happen here affect me and my family. So right when Pastor M was done, I jumped up, introduced myself, told him I help out with students.  I asked him if he was new.  Nope, been going here for a few years.  What?  Anyway, I won't go into the details, but D and I got nowhere with him.  The gist was that he felt like he was entitled to a seat.  And he was pretty bitter about all the married people saving seats, that married people were so bad and selfish about it, it made it very hard for single people to get a seat when they come early.  What?  I just don't get it.  And I really didn't want to anymore.  He was very amicable, just hard headed.  In the end we chose to disagree and walked away from it, on a pretty civil tone.  Not to mention that he used the word 'bullshit' two times in our conversation.  Now, I'm not against using that word, but I wouldn't do it 1- in church, 2- with someone I just met.  That's pretty lame.  And I think it's pretty indicative of his heart.  Shock people, be bitter, live life how you want to live it. I'm still in shock.  And I'm sad that the couple (she by the way left when the message started to stand in the back with her husband who in fact did come in) had to experience something like that at a church that I so believe in. Let's just say that this guy won't be coming into any contact with my students if I can help it.  At a minimum, he needs to clean up his mouth.  At the extreme, he needs to work on his heart.

       When Fellowship Fails  D and I have been talking a lot today about a couple that we know whose not doing to well.  I think the church has failed them in many respects.   1 - They have made them 'do' too much, in terms of church programs.  Teach this, lead this, be here for this.  Despite your young family, despite the fact that there are older, wiser people, more along in their journey, who don't need as much time at home, all who are plenty capable to do those things.   2 - Their 'good' friends have failed to call them on some pretty significant issues.  It's sad, because if I were in their shoes, I would want someone to say something, if they felt like it was a big enough deal.  Like, "Hey, I think you being stoned while driving your kids to school is bad."  Of course, I'm making that extreme example up.  But if you were crazy, wouldn't you want your friends to say something? 3 - Their 'good' friends have seemingly almost given up on them.  No one seems to be seeking them out when they don't show up for things they have made commitments for.  It's almost that the couple has maybe given up on the idea that anyone would care. It's pretty sad.  But I do need to mention that, I'm not in any of their shoes, so I really don't know first hand.  I could be more off than imaginable.  I would hope, with all my heart, that if that was me/us, our fellowship would dive to any depths to rescue us.  And if it was someone in our close midst, we would do the diving... Pray for the Bs if you could, for restoration and the Enemy would leave them alone.

       V Day 2004   So I'll spill the beans here, since I don't think anyone reads this. The next SPACE launch, for both middle and high schoolers is on vday.  We are going to throw a beach party at a Senior Citizens home.  It's going to be cool. The reasoning behind it is simple - we want to talk about love, on the day that the world takes time out to talk about love, in a different way.  We want to impact a major segment of society, steering them into the meaning of true love.  We want to expose these great, wise, old people to the author of real love, to the One that went all out, that spoke and acted on love that was greater than any other kind of love imaginable.  And we want to get kids to do that.   Can I just tell you, I know God is going to use it strategically, in a pretty significant way... Here are some of the plans: - beach music - limbo (but prob not for the senior citizens) - vday cookie decorating - vday card making - a 'tell your true love story' thing (we'll have a computer and a printer and have residents tell us the story and we'll print it for them on some nice vday paper) - some live worship - a short gospel presentation (by one of our students, Leslie.  This is probably what I most excited about - indigenous leadership - adult driven/student led, etc.)  We did this last year, with my Dteam from 03.  We went to this place for 3 weeks just hanging out and helping with bingo, making friends, playing poker.  On the last night ,we brought the girls from the grade, flowers, cards, pictures, etc.  It was pretty neat.  But I think this year is going to be better.

       What Church People Ought to be About  'I simply argue that the cross be raised again at the center of the market place as well as on the steeple of the church, I am recovering the claim that Jesus was not crucified in a cathedral between two candles: But on a cross between two thieves; on a town garbage heap; at the crossroad of politics so cosmopolitan that they had to write His title in Hebrew and in Latin and in Greek, and at the kind of place where cynics talk smut, and thieves curse and soldiers gamble. Because that is where He died, and that is why He died, and that is what He died about. And that is where Christ?s men ought to be, and what church people ought to be about.' - George MacLeod Taken from  urlLink Scott's  blog.

Some other good advice on acne, sleep habits and straight talk from (gasp!) actual teeenagers. I thought most of the article was pretty right on.  But on the other hand, it made me realize that the students I come into direct contact with, wow, some of these things don't apply.  Because I think: #1 - they are mature #2 - they understand life's priorities correctly #3 - they have a realization that they have it pretty good in comparision to the world around them.

       Super Bowl  Wow, of course lots of controversy about the commercials and especially the half time show from last night...  Nothing more than I need to mention here, except that if you know me, you know I have a big disdain for professional sports.  I usually never watch them, because I'm not convinced its a great investment of time and I think we as a culture have a slight problem with the way we treat atheletes and the amount of money we spend on pro sports.  Please understand, I'm not taking shots, just reflecting how I personally feel.  But despite all that, I watched the whole game, and it was quite a game.  Kudos to the Pats and the Panthers on some good competition.  Read what Walt Mueller says about the Super Bowl  urlLink here , find the heading "Lettin' it all hang out...".  Very good critique.  "I am fully aware that those who would be critical of my criticism will say I should have just turned it off. Sorry, but that's not the answer. I may not have watched it, but millions of other impressionable young kids will have. I think we need to be advocates for them and protect them from physical, emotional, relational, and moral harm."  Go Walt!!  We can't engage or dialogue if we hide from it...

       Ps 73  Pretty interesting  urlLink sermon  from CRCC.  Thanks for the link  urlLink Rudy.   I like most of what Brian says, its pretty good.  But I think the most important thing he said was to watch the way you read Psalm 73 versus the way Christians in other countries would read it.  Yeah, thats big.

       Child Witches  This article  urlLink here  Link from  urlLink Jordon . So sad.  We sit here and can't imagine how people would think that.... whereas people that don't live in the Western hemisphere deal with spirits, witchcraft, curses and magic constantly.

       The Passion in Kuwait  Read  urlLink this .   "In two short hours, more Qataris heard the gospel than I have been able to reach in nearly five years of living here." In Kuwait, there are 33 people groups, with 20 listed as unreached.  So an argument about The Passion being not being a great outreach opportunity... well in this specific case, I disagree.

       A story as told to Dennis Rainey  From the book  urlLink Parenting Today's Adolescent   My son has two daughters one who is five and one his is two.  For several years, he's taken the oldest girl out for a 'date' time but it wasn't until recently that he'd asked the two year old out. On their first date, he took her to breakfast at a fast food restaurant.  They'd just gotten their pancakes when he decided it would be a good time to tell her how much he loved and appreciated her. Jenny, he said, I want you to know how much I love you and how special you are to Mom and me.  We prayed for you for years, and now that you're here and growing up to be such a wonderful girl, we couldn't be more proud of you. Once he said all this, he stopped talking and reached over for his fork to begin eating but he never got the fork into his mouth. Jenny reached out and laid her little hand on her fathers.  His eyes went to hers and in a soft, pleading voice she said, "Longer, Daddy, longer." He put his fork down and told her even more reasons why he and her mother loved her.  "You're very kind, nice to your sister, full of energy" Then, he again reached for his fork only to hear the same words again.  A second time, and a third, and a fourth time.. and each time he heard the words, "Longer, Daddy, longer" That father never did get much to eat that morning, but his daughter feasted on words every child longs to hear.  Told by John Trent Wow.  Does that story bring tears to your eyes?  It did to me the first time I read it.  But not just because I have two little girls, who hold my heart in their hands.  Mostly because of that.  But also, because I realize that we have students that we see every weekend that would say the same thing to an adult that would care for them.  They would say the same thing to an adult that would spend time with them, say hello to them, go see a game or a play they were in, call them out of the blue just to say hi, chat online with them for a few minutes.  To a person that cares for them, "Longer....longer."

       Great youth group games!  Intriguing  urlLink article  about youth group games.  I have to admit, some of these are pretty funny, but the article brings about some pretty good points.  I might think they are funny, but I do realize that many of them are totally pointless.  I have a bit of pride is saying that in 4 years that I ran a small group, as well as running grade wide get togethers, we never did anything like this.  In fact, I can say without reservation that we did programming that was based on principles only and we never did things just to do them, or just because someone else did them.  We always had a very specific set of goals and objectives.  I think that's pretty important in youth ministry and I think kids start to really respect your ideas and foresight when they realize that EVERYTHING you do has a significant purpose to teach, model, disciple.  Now before you think that I think that I really know what I'm doing, there was that time that we accidentally left a kid at someone's house after leaving to go play Manhunt.  And the time a student smoked pot while having a sleepover at his house.  And the time all the guys got upset after doing a GPS scavenger hunt that took 4 hours instead of 2.  And the time....  well, you get the picture.

       Almost 4/4 for 2004  Some of you readers have been following my plan and implementation for summer missions for this summer.  The plan was to have 4 different trips from GCC, between middle-high school, all of them are looking into the future, to set up a progression for summer missions, and trying to be strategic. Up until today, I really only had 3 out of the 4 staffed and ready.  But this morning, two people, who have worked closely before, both said they were interested in leading this trip and both were really interested in working with each other.  Hmm.  Very cool.  So I meet with them on Wed evening to lay it all out.  Pray for ML and J.  They are a great team, and I trust them as mission trip leaders.

       Bubbles  So I bought this really cool bubble machine tonight, from BJs (its a warehouse club store).  It was $10 and it must spit out 20 bubbles a second.  Really.  It's rad.  Why the fascination with bubbles?  Well, I really bought it because it was cool, and my kids love bubbles.  But a second reason is for children's ministry.  You want to attract kids to what you are doing?  Whip out some bubbles.  Want to see kids have a great time for no good reason?  Bubbles.  Want to do something cheap, when its hot outside, and don't have any good ideas?  Bubbles.  Really.  It might sound kind of dumb.  But that's ok.  So I'm going to take this bubble machine everywhere I go this summer on ministry.  In fact, I just might keep it in my SUV at all times. My fondest memory of bubbles was when I went on a 4 week missions trip to the Dominican Republic.  I remember it like it was yesterday.  I travelled with a team of 6, I was the primary leader, with a woman co-leader Suzie, and we were in charge of 4 students.  The goal was to work with a missionary from our home church who was with a missions agency working in a medium sized city in the center of the DR.  He was involved with kids clubs, street ministry and an orphanage run by Christians.  It turned out to be a pretty interesting experience - lots of downtime, he was only there every once in a while, I got really really sick about half way thru the trip.  Anyway, probably the first few minutes we got to our town, unloaded our stuff, kids came pouring out from everywhere.  Literally.  There must have been 30 school aged children all with huge smiles, beaming at their new visitors.  And we got bubbles out.  And it was like we had just pulled out heaven from our baggage.  Really.

       Missions Prep 1  Great time last night doing the first prep meeting for the summer.  A good 25 kids there, I just watched them during the worship set.  Just amazing to see and hear them worship so whole heartedly.  Went over some really good stuff missions wise - unreached people, state of missions today, Gen 12, etc.  The feedback I got was that a lot of them hadn't heard stuff like that ever before.  My goal accomplished.  Had some good team times too and we got them a great start to writing support letters - the notion of finding partners to their missions trip.  I feel a great sense of pride at a job well done.  Not only me, but having God lead in such a way, and, more importantly, that God would grab these hearts to be passionate to bring His glory to the nations for the rest of their lives.

       Adopt a Village  Pretty good article about Rick Warren  urlLink here , coverage from Time.  That's pretty cool.  Whether or not you like Rick Warren (I for one like him), he's done a lot for the evangelical church here in the US.  Catch the end of the article, about how he would like each one of his 2000 small groups to adopt a village. "He wants each of Saddleback's 2,000 small groups to adopt a village in a developing country, make mission trips there and send educational and medical supplies, along with spiritual and financial support, to its residents." Now THAT is some influence.  What would that look like if each one of those small groups caught the vision for unreached people groups and being accountable and responsible for indigenous church planting movements in each people group?  Maybe I should send him a letter....

       In Your FACE  If you have followed my postings for the past few weeks, you know it's been a tough 6 - 8 weeks in general, mostly due to my day job and the pressure of trying to get things started for summer missions.  Last weekend, we had another big work weekend and things ran pretty flawlessly.  It was a very visible piece of work and my team came through.  It was pretty awesome, I was, and still am, elated about it.  Since then, I have also gotten the 2nd out of 4 planned mission trips off the ground, with a parents meeting, paperwork started, etc.  And we got a final confirmation on dates for the other trip that was already off and running.  Tonight is our first out of five mission prep meetings with all the students going out this summer.  I'm way excited, we will probably have about 20 there tonight and I've been working hard all week getting packets together for them that includes a study, sample support letters, printed labels for returning support to the church, and response cards for people to write back their level of support.  Wow.   So in other words, about the level of spiritual warfare that has been going on, I say to Satan, in your FACE!  The feelings of attack, the physical toll of working two long weekends back to back, the stress between our family in the midst of a bad review at work, the nagging doubt that maybe I could not do it all, that I had taken on too much responsibility between work, missions stuff, family, etc.  All of these feelings are gone... substituted with this emotional high based on the knowledge that God and I can do this.  To you youthworkers reading this, You are capable. “It is the image of God reflected in you that so enrages hell, it is this at which demons hurl their mightiest weapons.” – William Gurnall

Reminds me of the talk about perishable versus nonperishable in 1 Peter 1:  22Now that you have purified yourselves by obeying the truth so that you have sincere love for your brothers, love one another deeply, from the heart. 23For you have been born again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable, through the living and enduring word of God.

       Who is Normal Anyway?  I had wanted to write about this about three weeks ago.  An incident happened on the CpR retreat that was pretty significant.  The nurse who came for the weekend rode up and back with me, since I came a little late.  On the way home, she was telling me how she had gotten a chance to sit in on the Sat night session.  During the session, there was a drama about suicide.  And while the nurse, J, was there, a female student was watching the drama and just got freaked out and had to run out of the room...  Since no other adults were following her out, J ran out to see if she was okay.  The girl was talking about how she hadn't thought about suicide in so long and that this drama just really got her.  And she couldn't stop thinking about it again.  At one point, the girl said, "I'm just not normal." J had the presence of mind to say to her, "You ARE normal.  Everyone has something to deal with."  Is that great or what?  Because that is so much of what students are dealing with, whether its contemplating suicide, or thinking about whether their shoes are cool or not.  Of course, it could very well be all of us who are trying to decide whether we are normal or not, us adults just hide it a little better.  But in either case, I loved it the fact that a visitor to our ministry could shepherd a kid like that.  And I think those words are so significant.  Those are the words that some of our students are dying to hear.

       Shaping Eternity Infobytes   urlLink These  are some very well done Flash 'infobytes' that talk about the current state of Christian missions, unreached people groups, etc.  I first saw one of them during the lecture of the first Perspectives class and they really are good.  I will be using a few of them this coming week talking about: - Organizing the world between Christ followers, nominal Christians and the unreached - Tribal, Hindu, Unreligious, Muslim, Buddhist (notice that when you put these world religion breakdowns together in this order, it makes the word 'thumb'.  Cool eh?  Not my idea - I got it from one of the Infobytes) - What is a people group? - What is the 10/40 window? - The Biblical Basis for missions We'll see how it goes.  I've also got to line up a worship leader, snacks and some follow up with their individual mission teams.

       TEN BOOKS YOU'LL NEVER TAKE FROM MY YOUTH MINISTRY LIBRARY   From YPNation's request for conversation:  X.   urlLink Waking the Dead  Helped me understand and realize how spiritual warfare is all around us and how we are an integral part of God's plan. X.   urlLink Please Understand Me  Great resource for building teams, both mission teams and leader teams. X.   urlLink Short Term Missions Workbook  Excellent studies to work through with mission teams. X.   urlLink Parenting Today's Adolscent  The Rainey's talk about the most common traps of adolescence and, almost more importantly, pre-adolescence. X.   urlLink Transforming Leadership  Jesus as the model of leadership X.   urlLink Decision Making and the Will of God  What is God's will?  Better yet, let's understand a clear strategy for making decisions. X.   urlLink Youth Builder  Good overall youth ministry resource. X.   urlLink Perspectives Reader  The text from the Perspectives class.  Speaks for itself. X.   urlLink Operation World  Yeah buddy. X.   urlLink Intensive Care  Subtitle "Helping Teenagers in Crisis"  Hmm..  Interesting list, because I just realized that I don't really have a lot of books about youth ministry specifically.  I guess in thinking about it, I've really been modeled for ministry by mentors versus reading youth ministry books.  That's probably not a big suprise to anyone reading this, if you have been involved in ministry, you have probably learned by working closely side by side with someone, seen their passion, seen what motivates them, seen how they connect with students.  Anyway, enjoy the list for what its worth. Also note that there I didn't number them.

       I Peter 2  20But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it? But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God.   21To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps. 22"He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth."  23When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.  He entrusted himself to him who judges justly, even in the midst of toil and trouble.  Quite an example, that Jesus guy.  And in the midst of guilty people condeming the most innocent, he entrusted himself to a higher purpose and calling.  It's so good when Scripture comes alive in the midst of personal circumstances, isn't it?  How often we don't believe that the Bible is really a magical book.

       St Patrick  In honor of St. Patrick's day, this Wednesday,  urlLink here  is some truth about St. Patrick. Notice that: - he was English.  DOH - he was kidnapped and taken to Ireland, and that is when his faith became real. - he had a burning desire and passion for the Irish. - consecrated no fewer than 350 bishops (I take that to mean that he discipled them or something like that...)  I also heard that legend has it that he personally baptized about 10,000 people... Wow.

       Making the Grade  Another very tough week at work this past week.  I didn't think it could get worse than what I had mentioned a few weeks ago.  But it did, in the form of a performance review about 2003.  Wow.  Apparently, I'm not really making the grade, although people think I can.  It's interesting.  I've always rated above the 'just meeting' standards, except for 2003, in which I felt like me and my team worked double.  In fact, in 2003, I personally worked over 50% of the weekends.  Not all weekend, but in some fashion or another.  But let's not dwell on that.  Evidently, it's not only a quantity issue, but a quality issue.  My team's deliverables need a little more diligence. The first response I had was, of course, I could certainly due without this.  On a deeper level, I asked myself if I could really do this job?  Eventually, I came to the conclusion that the Great Accuser, of course, wants you to think that.  And he will use any and all means necessary for you to think that you cannot do it.   This all in the midst of a high school retreat, plans to see The Passion with C&B, and getting 4 summer mission trips off the ground.   It's been a rough week around here.  And a few months ago, after some very successful SPACE launches, when lots of people got excited about what we were doing, when I felt like we were really rolling, I asked myself if it was going to always be this easy.  Well, apparently not.  But I should have never expected it would be easy.  Good, worthwhile, a sacrifice, but never easy. After a few days of dragging, I'm expectant again.  Lord, bring your glory!

       Praying for Missionaries  Bob just posted some great suggestions  urlLink here .  It's nice to read about missions on someone besides just me.  Sometimes I feel as if I'm the only one concerned with mobilizing students for missions.  I mean, that would be okay too, but it's nice to see someone else write about it too. He's right.  It's way too easy for us to give money to missions and then forget about it.  Expanding on that, I think we in the American church think that as long as we are giving money to it, it is ok.  Meaning that anything related to 'missions' must be a good thing.  When in fact, that is untrue.  Missions, just like anything else in ministry, needs to have some kind of accountability associated with it.  Otherwise, we might end up spending 80% of our resources where it isn't needed, and only 20% on what is really strategic.  Oh wait - that is what we are doing...

       Passion with CW  Wow, we just came back from seeing The Passion, with my friend CW, who I have written about before, and his wife.  Intense.  Here are a few things that struck me about the movie: - Malchus, the soldier who got his ear cut off, and whom Jesus healed.  What a reaction he had to Jesus.  No more being a soldier for him. - The way Jesus looks at people. - The scene when Mary runs to pick him up after he falls down with the cross, one of the many times, and the flashback to when he was just a little boy.  Heart wrenching. - Simon from Cyrene, who helps him carry the cross all that way.  Did you notice the way he really helped, like there was something significant about it. - The details of all the blood dripping down the crosses.  I had never visualized it like that before.  But it sure must have been bloody. - Two Roman soldiers who stuck around at the end to help get Jesus' body down. Needless to say, I was impacted.  I won't ever think of the Crucifixion the same way.  The thought that kept coming in to my head was that He did all this for me. We didn't really get a chance to talk to C and B about it, but I'm going to make plans to meet up with him again to talk some more.  Interestingly enough, our babysitter IM'd me at around noon saying she had come home sick from school and couldn't baby sit for us.  Was this a significant night for the Kingdom?  Are we still thinking that these things happen by mere coincidence?  Was my crappy review at work this week unrelated to any kind of accusations the Enemy is making against me and what God can do through me?  Let me tell you, Satan is pissed at me.  At us - for being youthworkers that are willing to invest time and energy into helping students become the salt of the earth and the light of the world.  And I say, bring it on.  James 1:2-4; Heb. 10:38-39; Rom. 8:37; 2 Cor. 12:9-10; Gen 50:20; Rom 5:3-5  I didn't come lookin' for trouble And I don't want to fight needlessly But I'm not gonna hide in a bubble If trouble comes for me I can feel my heart beating faster I can tell something's coming down But if it's gonna make me grow stronger then...  Bring it on Let the lightning flash Let the thunder roll Let the storm winds blow Bring it on Let the trouble come Let the hard rain fall Let it make me strong Bring it on  Now, maybe you're thinkin' I'm crazy And maybe I need to explain some things 'Cause I know I've got an enemy waiting Who wants to bring me pain But what he never seems to remember What he means for even God works for good So I will not retreat or surrender  Now, I don't want to sound like some hero 'Cause it's God alone that my hope is in But I'm not gonna run from the very things That would drive me closer to Him So bring it on  Bring it on Let the lightning flash Let the thunder roll Let the storm winds blow Bring it on Let the trouble come Let the hard rain fall Let it make me strong Bring it on - Steven Curtis Chapman

       Revamped Joshua Project  Spent some time tonight at the revamped  urlLink Joshua Project  website.  Very cool.  The sheer amount of information there is incredible.  Quick quiz - how maby people groups are in Haiti?  And how many of them are unreached?  And how many of you out there have sent at least one student mission trip there?  And tell me again why?  PS - There are 7 people groups, none of them are considered unreached.  Haiti might be a great place to take students, for some sort of relief and development work, teaching English, etc.  But I wouldn't call it strategic in light of world missions.

       Retreat  Wow, it was a pretty great time.  KC and I took 5 8th graders to help with workcrew and just serve the high schoolers.  It was weird being there but not having the usual responsibility of a small group, cabin, group time, etc.  But it was fun nontheless.  Workcrew was loads of work, we had to serve, bus tables, clean tables and then setup for the next meal.  If you've ever worked workcrew at a Young Life camp, you know how anal they are about place settings, table layout, etc.  Wow, really anal.  But I didn't mind.  I thought it kind of strange, but you know, it was ok. Our eight graders were awesome.  They never once complained, and they got along with each other so well.  Very cool.  You can see some pictures of them  urlLink here . A few things that I thought could have been improved: 1 - They ran those kids out of the dining hall as soon as they could.  at past retreats, I remember just hanging out talking with students after the meal was over.  That bothered me. 2 - Working on workcrew gave me a new sense about how much food they waste.  They really should set up some kind of distribution to the community for all this left over food they just throw away.  Granted, I'm not sure how practical that is, since they are pretty far in the sticks.  But maybe neighbors?  I did get a chance to talk to a few kids in depth.  KD and KS both said they were interested in either full time ministry or missions so I gave them the usual missions blurb: - what is a people group and how the Bible means that when it says 'nations' - definition of unreached, and an unreached people group - Matt 24:14 - 80% of American missions is going towards reached people groups - there are over 800 churches in the US for every one unreached people group I hope I don't sound like a broken record.  But one of the kids said that she was trying to find out more info about missions and no one could tell her any real information.  And that's what I've said for a while, we aren't telling students this kind of stuff and it contributes to the gap the American Church is not meeting with regard to missions, especially for engaging students.

       Update - Spiritual Attack and Retreat  An update that ties two previous entries together... I'm getting ready to leave for our spring retreat.  Last minute, I found out about a kid whose parents would have to drive him up later, so I opted to stay and take him with me and the weekend nurse, instead of his dad driving all that way to just turn around when he gets there.  I think it's better, and it's not a big deal.  And, this kids parents have done a lot for GCC, they are mega-involved.  And he's a fun kid. On another warfare note - one of the worship leaders for this weekend, my padwan K, got sick this morning.  Throwing up all morning.  Hmm.  On another note, one of the workcrew guys, who is K's brother in law actually, can't come either.  His wife, who is actually K's sister (funny coincidence huh) got sick also.  They have a little baby, so R can't come.  Try to convince me again that this weekend will not be significant in the lives of at least one high schooler, that the Enemy doesn't really care that there are 4 Gospel presentations planned, that God isn't interested in being glorified by anyone else.

       Padwan to Kstan  K, one of the guys from Dteam03, is getting ready to go to Kazakstan this summer.  I got a reference form to fill out for him a few days ago.  Some good questions on it, thought I would share them.  It's always fun to fill these out for students, especially when they are so excited about serving in a specific way.  I can only hope that in the next few years, the SPACE crew gives me lots of these to fill out...  1.	how well do you know the applicant?  In  what context?  IN what capacity have you related with the applicant? 2.	having read the attached application what additional comments or perspectives would be helpful in better understanding the applicant? 3.	in your estimation, what experiences would best serve this individual in a 4-8 week international missions project? 4.	give a brief description of this person?s ministry experience and gifts, especially in the areas of personal evangelism and establishing. 5.	can you easily visualize this person doing relational evangelism: initiating friendships, relating comfortably, and sharing his/her life and faith naturally? 6.	what would you like to see God accomplish in this person?s life while they are involved in this summer missions project?

       Wheaton Bible  I've often heard great things missions-wise about this Wheaton as well, and heard a guy who used to be their missions pastor speak.  He was seriously the real deal.   urlLink This  talks about their short term mission trips.  I like: - each trip is designed to work and serve along a Wheaton missionary, at their invitation. (So on the adult side, you've got to have a pretty large base to start with) - both general and specialty trips. - applications and interviews required, and required preparation sessions. Good stuff.

       Mature Student Missions  I've heard Calvary Church, outside of Lancaster PA, has a pretty mature student missions program.  Check it out  urlLink here . I like: - pre trip meetings are mandatory - the idea of some progression to their trips - the integration of college age students too for the upper experience trips It's pretty cool. I don't see any reason why we couldn't do something like this at GCC.  In fact, I think this summer will be a great start.  If I could only get that one special leader...

       Pioneers - Core Values  I got the annual report for  urlLink Pioneers  today in the mail.  A few things got my attention.  First, was their list of core values: -passion for God -unreached peoples -church planting movements -the local church -team centered -innovation and flexibility -ethos of grace -participatory servant leadership WOW - does this make the hair on your neck stand up?  It does to me, but I guess that's just my thing... The other thing they said in the report was that for the past 3 years, they have sent one missionary to the field every week.  Man, that is intense. I'm also glad to report that we have a family that we support through Pioneers, and they are all about these values.  The are money.

       03-03-03  One year ago today was when my father in law passed away.  I used to call him "The Padre."  It really overshadowed everything that happened in 2003.  D would say that in 2003, we saw all the fruit of our labor from the Dteam, since it was the year those guys graduated from high school.  I would agree, although, still, when I think of 2003, it was the year that he died.  We had a great year in terms of family, work, the starting of SPACE and other things, but I think I will always associated 2003 with The Padre.  It's good to know, to really know without a doubt, that he is in Heaven right now, worshipping with Jesus like nothing else.

       Parenting Today's Adolescents - notes 2  Zones of adolescence The Innocence Zone – Age ten through twelve During this zone, parents need to seize the opportunity to do two things:  First, mom and dad must secure the relationship with the child.  Second, they need to aggressively begin to shape the childÂ’s convictions before adolescence hits in full force. DonÂ’t make the mistake of many parents who severely underestimate the amount of convictions that can be transferred to a child in this zone. The Danger Zone – Age thirteen through sixteen We believe this zone to be the most dangerous phase of your child’s life.  The junior high and early high school years are when most families lose a son or daughter, although the actual loss of the child may not become evident until later. Many parents assume, incorrectly, that the children their sons and daughters have relationships with at church, school, and in the neighborhood have similar values to their own.  This is a very very dangerous assumption. In the danger zone, however, the family values learned and lived out behind closed doors that may have seemed so similar are now exposed for what they really are – often a murky, bland adaptation of the world’s values or a startling absence of values altogether. With the onset of the teenage years, when children are experience greater freedom, the peers who once were a good influence may now be banding together to test the limits of their parents. The wise parent recognizes this danger zone and is careful to not give a child too much freedom too soon.  Just because a child is beginning to look and act like an adult by making some 'right choices’ does not mean he is really ready for adult responsibilities and corresponding freedoms. The Release Zone – Age seventeen to nineteen Releasing a child does not mean you stop being the protector, provider and parent.  I've been getting a new perspective about the middle school/early high school years since starting to read this book recently.  The Raineys make the point that those are some seriously important years, in terms of giving kids stability, convictions, teaching the truth.  It makes me think of my experience with students, which is usually "middle schoolers are so hyper" or "freshmen small groups are so hard to corral", or the idea that you see the fruit of your labors when your students are juniors or seniors.  Which all may be very true. But it's got me thinking, to have kids develop a passion for missions, for them to see the world as God sees them, to have a drive to have people worship God, according to the Raineys, these kind of convictions and passions get started early, like ages 10-12.  Wow.  In theory, my SPACE crew is already gone... Ha. I also think, in terms of youth ministry being a complement to the family, this really puts us in the mix for helping students.  The idea that we are to assist the parents in 'securing the relationship' asaggressivelyggresively shaping convictions.'

       Retreat  Our spring High school retreat is this weekend to  urlLink Rockbridge .  It's always a blast, loads of fun.  Spring is our outreach retreat, where kids are encouraged to bring their friends.  Our speaker is TG, who used to be on staff with Young Life in Howard County.  He is going to do 4 Gospel presentations through the whole weekend. I'm going as kind of a SPACE mini-launch, and KC and I are taking 5 8th graders to work on the kitchen/workcrew.  It will be a great time, I'm looking forward to building some good relationships with these 8th graders.  Of course, I'm going to try and convey the sense of vision for SPACE to them as well.

       Next book  I'm reading  urlLink Parenting Today's Adolescents .  It's good, the Raineys, gotta love them.  It's weird, I came home yesterday and my 6 year old was talking on the phone, like a teenager.  Chilling.  And to think that those years will be here before we know it. I'll be posting some notes from the book here and there.  "Can you name a more demanding career than being a godly mom or dad?  Air traffic controller?  That’s a nap in the park compared to a mom landing and dispatching four teenagers from an after-school holding pattern.  Brain surgeon?  Would you rather poke around in a sedated skull in a fully staffed operating room or try by yourself to soothe and heal the tangled feelings and thoughts of a teenage girl who wasn’t invited to the prom or who failed to make the drill team? On top of all the challenges of parenting, there’s something far more sinister taking place.  We’re in a spiritual war and are operating like guerrillas behind enemy lines.  The paths we walk, and the trails our children must walk, are dangerous – littered with traps set by a spiritual enemy that you can’t see, an enemy who wants to destroy the souls of children before they become adults." "Nothing can compare to the joy of seeing a child grow up to walk in the truth – “I have no greater joy than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth” 3 John 4.  Nothing is as exhilarating as watching our children bravely walk through traps and snares, advancing the banner of Jesus Christ in their generation."

       Mark 2  My notes from Pastor Mark's message on Sunday.  You can listen to the rm  urlLink here .  Think about your most embarassing moment. Unhappy activity Happens in the limelight, center of attention  Mark 2:1-12 The paralytic Most embarrassing moment With jesus Right after the healing of the leper Everyone knows jesus Curious people Religious leaders – out to get him  Friends open a 4x8 opening in the roof Mud thatch roof, lots of dust and stuff Roof was repaired probably once a year Friend lying on a 3x6 pallet  Teachable moment – the whole crowd just watches this pallet come down What was it like for the paralytic Can you imagine what he was looking at as he was lowered?  v.5 – whose faith? ‘Son’ a term of endearment for a total stranger, a person Jesus has never met before  The friends want him healed – they don’t care about him being forgiven, necessarily. The religious leaders are upset.  This doesn’t fit their model of forgiveness, because if Jesus can forgive sins, then He really is God. When Jesus encounters people, He always talks about something they are thinking but don't want to say.  Immediately Jesus  v. 9 which is easier to say? To be forgiven or to be healed To be forgiven is easier because there is no sure fire way to prove it really happened.  ** From Christ’s point of view, as an all powerful God, the easier thing to say was ‘to be healed.’  For to say ‘you are forgiven’ would require a perfect person to pay the ultimate price in order for one to be totally and truly forgiven.

       Missions Prep #3  Our 3rd meeting is this coming weekend.  I've decided we will talk about teamwork and stuff like that.  Something like: - culture game - study on Romans 12 (different gifts, etc.) - Myers Briggs test, including charting the people on your team for where they are - the Hardy Personality - study on Phil 2 maybe - everyone's status on fund raising - the 8 great questions (taken from the Short Term Missions Workbook)  I hope it goes well.  I'm going to have my mountain climber, Applachian Trail hiker friend G come for Prep #4 and he is going to do some serious team building initiatives.  So we talk about it this time and next time, whoa that is going to be hott.

       Empty Tomb  Wow just found this site which studies national church financial and giving patterns.  Some of the information on there will probably really make you mad.  Either it will make you mad at what they are implying, or it will make you mad that our 'discipleship' in the American church ends when it comes to money.  In either case, it is compelling evidence. If giving in American churches went up to 10%, there would be an additional $86B for missions.  Note what the chart says that number can do around the world.    In regards to our summer missions stuff: 2 trips raising support total needed = $9450 total to date = $4201 # of weeks spent raising support so far = 4 I'm not writing this to boast at all, mostly I'm just trying to get it straight in my head.  But I also think that when people hear about the need, not just financially, and they see the opportunity to partner with our mission efforts, money is just a detail.

       Origins  Headed to the  urlLink Origins  conference next week.  Should be a great time.  Travelling with our youth admin/catalyst, a young adults pastor, and a youth small groups coord.  Great group of people.   Also found this  urlLink link  from someone who went last year.  Nice set of notes. In preparation, one of them gave me a CD to listen to from Erwin.  Intense, my notes are below. =====   I sam 14  biblical change agents  redepmtive XXXX the longer we live the more we want to hold on to what we have to live impetuously not to protect what he had but to expand an expansionist - driven by urgency jonathan was an expansionist paul was a protectionist  the resources of God the authority of God the urgency and passion of God put those three in the same people  a biblical context for what we must become for God's future 8 characteristics of a biblical change agent for God  1 - take initiative amazed at how many christians are passive about God's will  we are egocentric about God's will for our lives the center point is MY life  the people that i know that initiate -  they look at humanity, they see the brokenness, their hearts are transformed by the longing of humanity they stop saying 'God what is your will for MY life' they say 'God I want to make a difference in someone elses life' they stop worrying about what their life is supposed to be about they worry about what God wants done in human history they ask, 'God what is on your heart?' they ask, 'What is breaking your heart Lord, what do you want done?'  Amazing how God can shape a life when they move based on what they feel is on God's heart  2 - understands and uses influence use the influence properly Jonathan does not wake up his father does not wake up his army understands appropriateness  some people feel like they are powerless to make change trying to bring change up instead of sideways and down God doesn't hold you responsible for influence he doesn't give you  there are people in your life that are living passive apathetic lives because you are  how come this new person is taking on some much responsibility? 'the kingdom of God is not a labor union' when a person comes to Christ and recieves the urgency of Christ, their influence expands  a holy life is not a passive life i don't do drugs anymore  i don't beat my husband anymore salvation and transformation is not just about what you do not do anymore Christ was ressurceted not to stop you from doing something but to get you to do something  people with intense characters are the leaders the way you expand your influence in the kingdom is that you deepen your character in Christ  3 - operate in the realm of uncertainty jonathan wakes the armor barer up when Jonathan says, "Perhaps the LORD will act in our behalf"  you never absolutely know become a risk taker for God  willing to live in the realm of uncertainty  some things we know certainly: Jonathan understands who God is - that is certain, concrete do you wait to act until you have concrete evidence? paradigms sound like the concept of faith two levels of faith: a - God speaks to us and its outside of our experience God calls us to a level of living outside of our experience God inviting us to where we have not been before the realm of possibility  b - in the realm of the impossible beyond the explainable Sarah's faith and Mary's faith the church normally identifies faith as anything outside the realm of our possibilities God is calling us to live in the realm of the impossible when we begin to live in the impossible, when God does not do it, we fail  4 - they embrace inherent dangers v. 8 cross over towards the men, but let them see us we are afriad to declare anything that is from the Lord we are afraid to risk anything that might fail won't we ruin God's name? when you work with the poor, every single day is a test of viability the Bible has no promise in it that you and i will survive this war, but we will be part of the victory celebration are we willing to inherit the dangers of glorfying God in the impossible?  5 - strategize from an advance mentality the high place is the strategic place high ground God is calling us forward, never backwards, never stationary it's not hard to avoid God - think small, dream small, live small as soon as you start thinking big - God becomes involved Jer 33:3 the impossiblity zone is the God zone it's over when you decide you have to give your life to something bigger than yourself  knowing that God always calls you to more ideas are a dime a dozen biblical risk taker doesn't just cast vision a person who allows Jesus to incarnate his life  6 - they draw others into the movement they don't live alone they don't see the battle as theirs - they see it as the Lords the 2nd most outstanding soldier was his armor bearer other people take note, but they don't understand   7 - is a person who God uses to bring communal help there is a lot of brokenness and dysfunction kingdom risk takers make people healthy they move people to health a critical missing ingredient in humanity - we were created for mission and purpose created by God to live with intention the less intention we have, the more broken we become  God heals them when they get into the battle if we as God's people will move together with courageous faith, that we will see multitudes come to Christ and find healing in the battle

       "Our help comes not from the Lord, but from Colorado Springs."   urlLink This  article brings up a couple good discussion points about how American Christians give and help. - Watch how and what you write - Know who you are supporting/partnering with - Insist that ministries work together and are a team Good stuff.  It gets me thinking about our propensity to just give money, without being more strategic about it.  If we give money, it must be a pretty viable ministry.

       I Peter 4  Last night our study with our couples group was on I Peter 4.  What an interesting passage, speaking about suffering and all.  Like we know how to suffer here in the US.  In the most affluent county in Maryland, boy, do I suffer. Some notes that came to mind from the passage.  v. 8-11 A true community is something you’ll have to fight for.  You’ll have to fight to get one, and you’ll have to fight to keep it afloat.  But you fight for it as you bail out a life raft during a storm at sea.  You want this thing to work.  You need this thing to work.  You can’t ditch it and jump back on the cruise ship.  This is the church, this is all you have.  Without it, you’ll go down.  Or back to captivity.  This is the reason small house fellowships thrive in other countries: they need each other.  There are no other options. - Eldredge  The purpose of the church cannot be to survive or even to thrive but to serve.  And sometimes servants die in the serving. – Erwin McManus  v. 12-13 From Perspectives: -	Explain the strategic value of suffering and martyrdom in terms of the triumph of truth, the defeat of evil, and the glory of God. Three things from Martyrdom/Suffering 1.	The triumph of God’s truth The unredeemed world lives in spiritual darkness.  When the ambassador of Christ speaks the truth in love and meets death with joy, a strange miracle occurs – the eyes of the unbelievers are opened. Many, many groups of people on this planet have testified that the darkness which had been over them was dissipated only when a missionary was killed there. 2.	The defeat of Satan The death of martyrs opens the eyes of unbelievers, and when they see the light, Satan’s power over them is gone. 3.	The glory of God In Christ’s voluntary suffering for the salvation of mankind, the true nature of God was revealed.  His essence was shown to be perfect love, utterly and unconditionally giving itself to others. People see the love of God in the death of the martyr and are compelled to believe in God’s love and sacrifice for them.

       Something strange ?  I Peter 4:12 Dear friends, do not be surprised at the painful trial you are suffering, as though something strange were happening to you.   In the course of planning and building mission teams, inevitably, there are team members who have to drop.  It usually happens, family plans, jobs, weird circumstances, etc.  To me, it's never been a big deal.  I always make sure the parents are totally comfortable not feeling like they have let someone down, making sure the students feel ok with making a commitment and then having to go back on it.  Life happens.  My trip is not and will not be the end-all/be-all mission trip of eternity.  Even this year, I have had 2 students drop from NYC already.  Both of them had unforseen family circumstances and were totally ready to go, but the trip had to give.  It's ok. But, I just got an email from another student with a totally different perspective.  She felt like a failure because she couldn't make the next meeting and hadn't sent her letters out yet.  The language of the email was doubtful and almost resigned.  I wrote her back to make sure that she knew she was on the team and that the small things of sending support letters and one prep meeting were just that, small.  I believe preparation for mission trips are just as important as the trip itself, but I also know that this student is going to thrive on this trip, it is going to change her worldview and she is going to look at missions so differently.   And the rest of the team, me included, needs her.  And she needs us. Is it no surprise that Satan will attack all of us as we prepare, meet, get to know each other, think about what our summers will hold for us?  Why wouldn't he send elements of doubt and resignation to us to make us believe that we aren't worthy, that we don't have what it takes, that we cannot possibly make a difference....  Whether it's at the beginning of brainstorming and planning summer missions, when I felt like I was most attacked, or today, as a student believes she has let everyone else down, Satan is at the heart of us feeling like something is trying to stop our efforts in bringing the Gospel to the nations. "Listen carefully:  any movement toward freedom and life, any movement toward God or others, will be opposed.  Marriage, friendship, beauty, rest- the thief wants it all." - Eldredge

       Summer Scheme   urlLink This  is a pretty cool page that shows all they are doing for student summer missions, info meetings, pre trip retreats, etc.  I like it.  A definite goal for next Spring... I mean Winter...  One thing did come to mind - that is one humongous church...  Wow... 17K in services every weekend.  Is that what Jesus wants the Church to look like...I'm asking because I'm not sure...

       Parents Info Mtg #3  Had another parents info mtg today.  #3 out of 4.  Only a few showed up.  Granted, the PR for it was probably lax.  That's ok, I feel like you only really need to have 2 or 3 really fired up students and then the trip starts to build momentum itself.  The last major one I organized, for a whole grade level, we sent out 60 postcards and only 6 parents showed up.  Anybody else out there have tips for running parents meetings?  Would love to hear them.

       Ghetto?  I was chatting with someone when they mentioned that someone 'lived in the ghetto.'  I replied, 'There is a ghetto in Howard County?' I was, if you didn't know, being facetious.  There is not a ghetto in Howard County.  Some interesting figures from the census: Median household money income, 1999 - $74,167	 Persons below poverty, percent, 1999 - 3.9%  Plugging in$74K into  urlLink globalrichlist  , I got this:  You are in the top 0.755% richest people in the world. There are 5,954,658,435 people poorer than you. One hour's salary = approx $51.38 Oh, and in case you’re interested you are the 45,341,565 richest person in the world.  Please don't say 'ghetto' anymore.

       Meeting  Went to a Youth Min staff meeting a few days ago, I only go once a month, and only since this year, so I'm still getting used to it.  It was good though.  I've always felt that it's more fun than work for me to go to those, the meetings that I go to for work are just that - work.  They are about software designs, implementing software, software bugs, fixing and implementing software bugs, you get the picture.  But these Youth Min staff meetings, they are the stuff of life, at least more so than work. There was a discussion the other day, it got a little personal, as some meetings, secular job or church job, can get.  What impressed me was that there was an honesty, an openness, a 'lay it out and let's get the details as well as the feelings right.'  That's some good staff relations.  I'm proud to be part of it.

       Gmail  So I got to be a beta tester for Gmail, via a link on www.blogger.com.  Very cool.  I've only played with it for about 15 minutes, but I like it.  It's got a cool interface thats very snappy.  It's a little confusing, but I'm sure it's just a matter of getting used to it.  The 1G inbox had me drooling for weeks.  I was just looking at all the folders I had with my yahoo mail.  Yikes.  I heard someone saying that their dealing with attachments still needs some work.  I do know that I had played around with sending a Word doc and that was fine.  But I liked the way they lay out attachment info when you get one.  And I liked the zippiness of when you reply/forward and how the frames 'jump' to life.  Cool.  A nice perk to using blogspot.

       Students and Local Ministry  From the  urlLink YPNation News Network , a topic suggestion close to my heart - Succesful ways you've gotten students involved in local community ministry... I thought I would outline the big winners we did this year with our students.  Before that, I thought I would share a little background: - Our ministry did not have a missions/community service component to it prior to this year.  Most if not all of that was up to individual small group leaders.  That's good and bad.  Good because they know the kids and if you get a leader to do it, you probably get most of their kids.  Bad because it's a lot to put on a small group leader.  I think, and lots of other people agree, that our small group leaders probably put in the most time across all the volunteers in the whole church.  Sunday worship, a Bible study every week, contact time with kids, every other Friday night outreaches...  It's a lot.  Who's got time for community service, and don't even think about a summer missions trip.  And forget about the leader's family, if they have one, or a full time job.  At best, it makes for a very hectic and busy lifestyle; at worst, we setup leaders for a habit of ministry overload and all that comes with it.  So one of our goals was to provide these service opportunites that leaders could just show up to. - We have kids that have a heart for service and missions.  They came out of the cracks when we started this.  I suspect you do too.  In fact, I think we are dealing with a different generation.  When I was a high schooler in the 80's, all I wanted to do was watch MTV.  The students we have these days are different. - I spent the prior 4 years being a small group leader, so I saw the gap of what I wanted to do, and any attention the overall ministry was giving to it.  So, I had a lot of input into this piece, so much so, now I am one of the leaders for it.  Nice, huh? - Our kids worship like whoa.  I suspect you probably have kids like that too, but these kids worship like nobody's business.  I can't understand it at all, but it's inspiring.  A natural outflow of worship should be action.  Hence, I felt like the engagement of a service/missions aspect of students was ready for prime time.  If any students could be engaged to do something like this, it would have been our students purely on the critieria that worship was an intense experience.  However, I think we are seeing a generation that worships like no other.   - We wanted to see our community service be strategic, well thought-out, smart.  We would not do any old community service just because someone suggested it or thought it was a great idea.  For example, Toys for Tots - great community service.  But not for us for a variety of reasions. - Tried to find ones that had a potential for relational impact as well as community impact.  Keeping in mind the principle of cultivate, plant, reap, some do any one of those things, we wanted to do things where kids could talk to people.  Not always possible, but a goal. Ok, wow.  So here are some areas of community service we pulled off this year, and some thinking behind them:  1 - Feeding the homeless.  Students arrived with their bag lunch.  We had stuff there to make more lunches.  They made them.  We left and went to DC, where each kid had 2 lunches.  We sat in a park and ate lunch with homeless people, getting to know them, conversing with them, etc.  Spent about 90 minutes there.  Saw three other churches come through and just served, delivered food.  The kids saw something different and cool about the way we did it. Then went to a food bank to help pack, stock, sort food.  Nice complement with the two events.  The thinking -   In the year 2025, there will be over 4B people that live in cities.  The urban slum inhabitants will number 1.5B people.  If we don't talk to our suburban kids about reaching the cities for Christ now, we are making a mistake.  Additionally, it's a pretty well documented fact that there is plenty of food for the whole world.  The problem is in food distribution.  Add to that some statistics about the number of children that die everyday from hunger and preventable diseases (34000, that's 24 a minute), homelessness and the related issues should be one of the ways we impact the community with our students.  2 - Raking Leaves  This idea was not mine - but driving around a neighborhood in a school bus, and then stopping at specific (or nonspecific) houses and all the kids getting out and raking the leaves up, bagging them, and moving on.  We took the idea and ran with it though, and it was so cool.  Really.  We had neighbors getting out and looking to see what was going on, one lady took pictures of us.  The thinking -   The idea was based around strategic thinking.  We talked to the kids about what it was like to think about these people for a few weeks, knowing what we were doing today.  And that's how God thinks of us.  He's got us in His mind all the time.  And how that translates to their lives, when they ponder the people around them, how they can impact them, etc.  We did 7 houses, it lasted all day, and we fed them pizza for lunch in the middle.  3 - Pro-Life  Around January, we decided to do something based on pro-life.  We had a guest speaker come who had had an abortion when she was 16, got pregnant again when she was 24, became a Christian during that pregnancy, and was raising her daughter as a single mother.  The idea of giving up a child once and no way in doing it again - wow, that was intense.  As she spoke, some of our kids were listening with their jaws open.  She really made an impact.  After that, we made and delivered some meals to people in the church that had babies recently.  Then we went over to a local pregnancy center and sorted clothes, packed baby bags, etc.  That was a lot of fun too.  The thinking -   Of course, the abortion issue is a huge issue in our country.  Pregnancy centers almost always need help.  It's perfect and easy.  One thing that I see with this area, is setting up a partnership of some sorts.  Part of that idea is still swimming around in my head, but it has to do with partnering with local ministries.  Same with the homeless idea.  You can feed homeless people yourself, but what would it look like to team up with someone who's full time job is to minister to the homeless.  It's a better investment, you make more of an impact, you are working on a team. In my mind, the jury's still out on whether there is more impact to the kids or the community.  My hope is that these kids think in a different manner after going on one of these things.  That's why we won't just do a service project that is off the top of our heads.  We want the service to be a catalyst for discipleship, a mission minded heart, a student that is transformed into a Christ follower. Wow, I've written a lot.  One more thing - for each of these, we teach before we start.  We debrief when we end.  They go hand in hand with the service activity.  Don't underestimate the value and investment of each of these pieces. I'm not going to write the same kind of thing on summer missions quite yet.  I want to see how it goes after the teams go out, come back, debrief, etc.

       Bridging the Gap  So in church this am, PM talked about David and the task before him when he was going to build the temple.  The ideas and principles behind when there is such a monumental task before you, that you only know that it is God behind it and who can orchestrate it coming through.  PM framed it in light of our building process.  For those of you that don't know, GCC has purchased some property and is close to groundbreaking for a new building.  It's been a pretty wild experience.  Some things include: - finding this 30 acres via a very strange relationship - purchasing the property for $50K an acre, when the land around it is easily going for 4 or 5 times that much. - having all the county and state approvals with no contest, especially in Howard County, which isn't known for letting churches just pop up - asking the county if it would be possible to extend their water and sewer facilities for us, and them saying yes as long as we pay for it - raising $5M from the congregation in the midst of today's economy  In essence, we are still $1.5M away, hence the gap.  So PM asked everyone to see: - what they could do - talk to people around them for what they could do - leave the results up to God  And then on May 16, we are having a Bridge the Gap Sunday, a big one outside service on the property where people are going to bring their one time donations and see where we end up.  It's pretty cool, I'm way excited to see how God moves in people.  I know that in the past, when we as a family decided to step out and give on faith, funny circumstances have about.  Some might call it coincidence, but I know that when we do that, either God gives us more or God reduces something we need to pay for.  Anyway, it will be neat to see what we can do as a family for this, seeing how creative we can be.    What is just as cool, was to sit in church and look around and see all the people that make GCC what it is.  The way they serve, relate, care for one another.  And just to realize that its not even close to being about the building.  The building is strictly a means.  Not the end all be all.  I also got to thinking, for the four weeks, what else could I do to make some extra money.  Maybe get a paper route?  No way, can't get up that early.  Get a part time job?  Not a chance with two little kids at home.  Time is too precious with them.  Then I thought, and here is where you blogspot readers come in, maybe I could do something for you guys out there?  No idea what specifically...  Maybe write a Bible study for you?  Point you in some direction for youth and missions?  Network you with someone else?  But then I thought, thats kind of lame.  I already try and do that for free.  How could I ask for money to do that?  PM was right, creativity is certainly going to come in the play here.

       PA  My friend PA came this morning to talk and sketch with his paintboard for our missions prep mtg.  It was pretty awesome.  I accomplished one of my goals - for kids to see a different kind of gospel presentation.  It also got him some visibility at GCC, which is something that I think will be good for him. He talked thru Acts 17 including: - the word evangelist is only used 3 times in the NT - the word 'witness' comes from the same word that we get the word 'martyr'.  Scary. I will probably update more when I find my notes.  In any case, thanks PA!  Funny because I just read this from McManus last night: "The New Testament word for ‘witness’ is the same as for ‘martyr.’  We have come to know martyrs as those who have died for the faith.  They didn’t survive, but they died facing the right direction.   The purpose of the church cannot be to survive or even to thrive but to serve.  And sometimes servants die in the serving."

       SPACE intro  I get people that ask me about SPACE all the time.  I talk about it so much, it's almost something I've memorized.  I guess that's a good thing, since I think I'm pretty passionate about it.  I just hope I don't talk too much when people ask me.  I hope they don't walk away saying, "Man, I wish he would just shut up about this SPACE stuff..." Anyway, the GCC YM website is launching on Monday.  Here is the quick write up I wrote about SPACE for it.  I like it, I think it sings.  ====  SPACE (Students Prepared to Act for Christ's Empire)  SPACE is the intersection of students, service and missions; the GCC Youth Ministry's component of strategic community service and worldwide missions.  SPACE exists to:  - Provide students and their leaders with opportunities for strategic community service. These opportunities are typically community service days during the school year and occur around 5 times during the school year.  We call them 'Launches'. Past Launches have included outreach to the homeless, a day  centered around the Pro-Life movement, and the school bus that loves to rakes leaves.    - Propel our students into worldwide missions with a strategic, progressive and prepared edge. SPACE partners with the GCC Missions Task Force in ensuring that our student missions trips are strategic with where the Body of Grace is going throughout the world. We seek experiences that will allow students to progress in their missions experience as they go from middle school thru high school. We prepare our students going out on summer missions  in the concepts of worldwide missions which includes teaching on  culture, team building and the unreached.

       Just like us?  My friend T and I had breakfast the other day.  He mentioned that he was at this conference for young adult minstries and met  urlLink Mark Batterson  from  urlLink NCC  in DC.  This is a church that I have followed on and off for a little while, since they are in DC and I love their whole approach.  I asked T what he was like and he said, "You know, hes in his mid 30s, has a few kids.  He's just like us." That's funny.  The idea that a pastor could be just like me, it's weird and different because of my experience as a young Christian.  But I think it's right.  And I'm glad my thinking is changing.

       McManus   urlLink     Our Youth Administrator and Catalyst (that is her real title, cool huh?) gave me this book.  I started to read it last night, and I really like it.  I'll post more notes about it later.  One of the cool things is that Erwin has quoted two people related to Perspectives.  I think it's cool because so much of the American church is missing our sense of mission.  And Perspectives puts it all into, er, perspective.  I'm sure I can write better than that.

       Spring Break Mini Launch followup  I realized that I never wrote about what we did or how it turned out. So I thought I would fill you happy readers about it. The idea was to have a mini launch since it was Spring Break for our students and since it was almost Easter weekend.  I wanted to do something and have it be somewhat targetted for the holiday weekend.  So the prayerwalking idea came to my head.  And I wanted to do it at the Mall.  We had done a small prayer thing with some of the SPACE crew there a few months ago, and they just ate it up.  The prayerwalking idea is different though, since no one is supposed to know that you are praying, but you are, just with a small group of people as you walk through a certain place.  You also have in mind certain specific things you are praying about, and are trying to let God speak to you for who and what to pray for.  I think it can seem a little mystical at first, but that's ok. So we had about 15 students show up and one of the leaders brought his young adult Bible study, which was cool too.   I introduced the whole night with talking about how Eldredge talks about that we need to believe that God still speaks to us, and then get into a position where we are listening.  And how our American modern church disbelieves that to a certain point.  And the story of one of our student's moms who had a dream about one of our college students who was on a missions trip - that he had something in his eye.  Turns out he had pink eye, while on his missions trip in Indonesia.  I had also printed a list of stores they could pray for, and an idea or snippet of how to pray.  And then they broke into small groups to go off and prayerwalk for about an hour or so. After it was done, we did a quick debrief near a hairdresser.  This lady that was getting her hair done was looking at us pretty strangely.  It was funny. Here is my list of stores and things to pray for:  (I for one, thought some of them were funny.) Starbucks - Friends building good relationships A&F - Kids to understand how God sees them Chick Fil A - Kids meals  Gymboree - Stay at home moms Fountains - Living water Disney - Impact society for Jesus Bookstores - People finding and reading books about Jesus BOSE - God to free people from materialism LL Bean - See God as the Creator Panera - People to see Jesus as the bread of life Hot Topic - Young people being protected Nordstrom - God sees you as glamorous Movie Theater - People moved by The Passion JCrew - God is cooler than your clothes Music stores - Power of music Build a Bear - Love of a creator Sports stores - Jesus competes for your heart Victoria secrets - True beauty Ice Cream- Strong families Bank - Money is not the end goal Merry Go Round - Christ to capture kids early Jewelry - Christ light of the world Maternity - Safe babies Shoe stores – people would walk with Jesus  And then some things we talked about for debrief: 1.	Was it weird? 2.	Did it make you think a little differently? 3.	Did you feel effective? 4.	Any interactions with people?  Strangers? 5.	Did God speak to you about anything or anyone?  The overall feedback was that they enjoyed it and thought it was a little uncanny and weird but fun.  They said we should definitely do it again.  Some people heard them praying and looked at them funny.  And one of the guys said he was so used to sharing and talking with people about spiritual things, he felt funny holding back and just praying. Fun stuff!

       DM   urlLink This  is an interesting article.  It's funny, I helped out with a trip to a DM conference back in the early 90s.  You can either like DM or not like him, but you have to admit, he's reaching loads and loads of kids.  What I liked about the conference was that he pretty much set you up as a youth ministry to take his content and go deeper with your kids.  What I didn't like is that our particular leader team didn't take advantage of it.  But that's the overall story a lot of times.  We take kids to these big events, but never go deeper.  Speakers give us almost everything we need to strike up conversations with them... We just don't take advantage of it.... I've only spoke at two retreats, but when I did, taking the example of some really good speakers, I had a list of questions that small group leaders could use to follow up right away.  I know when I was on a retreat that was set up like that, I had some phenomenal personal times with students.

       CT  Off to CT this weekend for Easter.  I know its tough for you guys and gals that 'work' these big holidays, in terms of full time ministry.  So my prayer is that in the midst of all the setup, practicing your talks, getting communion ready, sunrise services on the Beach, trying to keep kids awake or quiet, balancing your ministry and your family, helping your little children and your teens understand Easter, and all of that....  My prayer is that you yourself enjoy and embrace Easter and the truth that it represents.  Jesus is Alive!

        Walt Mueller nails it again. Check out his  urlLink post  here titled "Do we mind or nevermind?"    "This weekend as you remember, ponder, and celebrate the salvation secured for you on the cross, think about Kurt Cobain and those represented by his voice. I wonder if his cries went unheard for so long that he finally gave up and walked away from life while saying “nevermind.” God “minded” so much that He sent His Son into the world and to the cross. As His followers, we’re called to “mind” on His behalf. Will we “mind,” listen, and answer with the Good News?"

       Recent Searches  Some recent searches that have brought people to this page:  "missionaries unreligious tribal  THUMB" - yeah definitely.  THUMB - a very cool acronym for the unreached.  Tribal, Hindu, Unreligious, Muslim, Buddhist.  Nice. "youthworkers glorified baby sitters" - ouch.  I guess its the nature of the beast.  Some people will think of youthworkers as glorified baby sitters.  Sad but true. "muslim woman in image in sad presentation in nursing home" - weird.  hmm.  I hope this person found the image they were looking for.  Fun!  I'm a big fan of sitemeter.  If you are not using it for your blog to track where people come from, you should do it.  It's easy to set up and fun. Out of 3 searches, I think those sort of hit the mark on what I'm trying to do with this website.

       Walnut Hill CC  Found this  urlLink church  from a friend of D who has recently been going to a moms group there.  Looks like a pretty great church.  Check out their missions page  urlLink here .  I like the whole consortium idea - "loose confederation of churches whose goal is to send new missionaries from our churches overseas as quickly and expeditiously as possible." That's a great idea. Three churches that I know in this consortium: Black Rock - Kevin Butterfield - who was the youth pastor, is a high school friend of D.  The first time I met Kevin was at SEMP in 2000 when he did a concert of prayer.  I had only heard the name before, I had no idea who he really was. Trinity - D's family's home church.  And  urlLink Len Evans  who is a part of YPNation. Valley Community - I heard the missions pastor speak last Fall about short term trips at an ACMC conference.  He is money.

I think it's a great time to engage kids, especially with Good Friday and Easter at the end of their break.  So I'm thinking about something like  urlLink this   at the  urlLink Mall .  I'm thinking, just in general, of the movie theater where the Passion is playing, Hot Topic, and stuff like that... Hmm.  Anyone done something like this with students before?

       Scripture of Late  Scripture that I have been thinking about lately:   Matt 11  After Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee.  When John heard in prison what Christ was doing, he sent his disciples to ask him, "Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?"  Jesus replied, "Go back and report to John what you hear and see:  The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor. Blessed is the man who does not fall away on account of me." As John's disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: "What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed swayed by the wind? If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear fine clothes are in kings' palaces. Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. This is the one about whom it is written:    " 'I will send my messenger ahead of you,        who will prepare your way before you.'  I tell you the truth: Among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and forceful men lay hold of it. For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John. And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come. He who has ears, let him hear. "To what can I compare this generation? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling out to others:     " 'We played the flute for you,        and you did not dance;    we sang a dirge        and you did not mourn.' For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.' The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and "sinners." ' But wisdom is proved right by her actions."   Heb 3:15  As has just been said: "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion."   I Thes 1  Paul, Silas and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace and peace to you. We always thank God for all of you, mentioning you in our prayers. We continually remember before our God and Father your work produced by faith, your labor prompted by love, and your endurance inspired by hope in our Lord Jesus Christ. For we know, brothers loved by God, that he has chosen you, because our gospel came to you not simply with words, but also with power, with the Holy Spirit and with deep conviction. You know how we lived among you for your sake. You became imitators of us and of the Lord; in spite of severe suffering, you welcomed the message with the joy given by the Holy Spirit. And so you became a model to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia. The Lord's message rang out from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia--your faith in God has become known everywhere. Therefore we do not need to say anything about it, for they themselves report what kind of reception you gave us. They tell how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead--Jesus, who rescues us from the coming wrath.

       Waiting  A sermon from Pastor Mark, from Luke 8, titled "The Thing We Like the Least." Listen to the rm  urlLink here . A few of my notes to whet your appetite.  - Jairus turns around Jesus is nowhere to be found Jesus is talking to this woman And Jairus is left waiting Meanwhile, someone came out and said, Dead is your daughter v.49 too late - we missed our window of opportunity, now leave Jesus alone When they got there, the funeral had started - a full fledged funeral Jesus says stop wailing, she is asleep, they are convinced she is dead They laughed at Jesus, knowing that she was dead  - Delays and interruptions are part of God's plan from the woman's perspective - Jesus is 12 years late from Jairus' perspective - Jesus is 12 minutes late from Jesus perspective - he is not late at all The delays we see are part of the plan  - in our culture, who waits? we have a sophisticated ranking system for waiting people who have the most clout don't wait God's choicest people are asked to wait Because of how God transforms us when we wait Because of what God does around us when we wait

       Memorial Day 2004  "America has been known as a Christian nation due to the tremendous impact that the Christian faith has had on our society.  At the same time, the Christian faith has become delusional, over-identifying itself with society as a whole.  A Christian revolution must live in tension with human societies and cultures.  We want to see an authentic Christian expression in every culture on this planet – in fact we are called to make it so.  But there must never be a moment when we perceive Christianity as equal to the culture itself.  When we begin to see being a Christian and being American as indistinguishable, we lose the transforming essence of our faith.  The ultimate goal of American Christianity should not be to make us good citizens but to make us revolutionaries in the cause of Jesus Christ." - McManus

       04-05 SPACE Goals  Had a GCC YM staff meeting yesterday.  It was, like they always are, very fun.  Very energizing and motivating.  Nothing like a meeting in the corporate world... Anyway, one of the things we did was talk about 04-05 school year goals. Also a key piece to our goals was fitting them in to the overall Grace strategy, which is as: G - God's Word R - Relationships A - Authentic Worship C - Compassion E - Every Person Participating  Ok, now some of you might find it a little hokey that there is an acronym based on our church's name into specific goals.  But give us a little slack, huh?  And anyway, I think, when I try to be objective about it, that those elements make up a really good strategy...  More on goals later... I think some of the pondering about some stuff I learned at Origins and thinking about next year is starting to come together...

      A few years ago, in 1998 actually, somehow I heard this guy speak at a commencment address at Kenyon College.  I wasn't there, I don't even know where Kenyon is.  But I think I saw him give the speech on late night CSPAN or something (which I never watch.)  But... I think this is the BEST commencement speech I have ever read or heard. Graduation speeches have such power.  Like SM said last week in CpR, this time of the year is filled with hope and expectation.  New kids moving up to high school and middle school, kids graduating, college kids come home fresh from new experiences.  And graduations... they are times filled with emotion, idealism, freshness, liberation.  To be able to address youth during this time in their lives is always an honor and priviledge.  I only got to do it once, a few years ago, speaking at another church's graduation dinner for a youth program they had.  It was fun, because you are engaging so much promise and potential.  And you have to be brief, but commanding. Oops, as I was saying about this speech... In honor of the class of 04... I have pasted it here.  It used to be available on the Kenyon website...  But it's worth the full read.    Office of Public Affairs    Kenyon College Commencement Address  May 17, 1998  by Mark C. Rosenthal '73 President and Chief Operating Officer,  MTV Networks As I was preparing my remarks the other day, I suddenly realized that you didn't want to hear necessarily from me, that maybe what I should do is get up here and say, "Hey, you guys have worked hard for four years. Looks like you need a little fun. So . . . here are the Red Hot Chili Peppers!" Seriously, I really want to thank the Class of 1998 for inviting me to share this great occasion with you. I particularly want to thank you for not rescinding your invitation, even after I informed [President] Rob Oden that with two kids under four, I'm not hanging out a lot backstage with Marilyn Manson anymore. And since I am from the Class of 1973, I do feel compelled to promise you that my remarks won't be filled with what Cartman on "South Park" describes as "that tree-hugging hippie crap." Twenty-five years have passed since I sat where you're sitting now, but the memories of  my time at Kenyon are still fresh. Like you, I was fortunate to spend my college years in a place where ideas matter. Like me, you will forget most of what you have learned here. And you will forget it before you even turn thirty. You know, that's not as bad as it sounds. Because there is one thing you've learned here that you will never forget: how to think. How to use critical analysis to dissect and inspect what you read and what you see. How to seek out and discover on your own. How to be an individual instead of part of a herd. The most memorable part of my Kenyon experience was really learning how to learn and learning that from great friends and teachers like Tom Turgeon, Harlene Marley, and the late Jim Michael; from Gal Crump and Bill Klein, Phil Church and Perry Lentz; from Peter Rutkoff and Harry Clor. Now, smart people who know how to think on their own command a premium in any market. So for the sacrifices you've made to learn here, you will be repaid over and over again--though not necessarily in ways that you might expect now. Kenyon is an iconoclastic place, and its graduates have blazed some unique trails through life. My college friends here went on to do some very interesting things, and while they've been successful, I don't think money was ever a motivating factor in their decisions. One friend, Murray Horwitz '70, became a clown with Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus. That was an extremely formative experience, and it prepared him very well for a second career--in politics. Of course, from politics it was  basically a straight line right into show business. He went on to write the hit musical Ain't Misbehavin' about the great jazz musician Fats Waller. And he now runs cultural programming for National Public Radio. My Kenyon roommate, Greg Andorfer '73, majored in English and art history and went on to business school, but he ended up producing shows for public TV. He considered it a license to learn about absolutely anything that interested him. One of those things happened to be astrophysics. So he called up Carl Sagan one day to talk to him. And that's how the phenomenal series "Cosmos" came to be. After many years in television, Greg now runs the Maryland Science Center.  My own path out of Kenyon also was pretty circuitous. I attended graduate school in drama, then went on to run several professional theater companies. I'd always been interested in marriages of art and commerce. I eventually found an intriguing one in an emerging new industry called cable  television. Unfortunately, the first place where I worked, a small unit of CBS that focused only on arts programming, decided there wasn't enough commerce to justify their investment. They folded their cable operation--and my job with it. But I had seen enough of cable to believe in it. So I moved on to a place then called Warner AMEX Satellite Entertainment company, which turned out to be a precursor to the company I work for now, MTV Networks. MTV Networks started in 1981 with MTV, but today it's a lot more. Of course, it's still MTV, which is now in more than 300 million homes in the United States and around the world, including mainland China and, as of September, Russia. It's Nickelodeon, the most popular channel for kids, on broadcast or cable. It's also Nick at Nite, and a new channel called TV Land, which is kind of like Nick at Nite on steroids (if you don't get it, call your cable operator). It's also VH1, Comedy Central, and a brand-new channel called Noggin, the first educational channel for kids, in a partnership with Children's Television Workshop. The people who came to MTV back in 1981 were a diverse, rag-tag, motley crew. Some came from radio. Some came from magazines. Some came from totally alien fields entirely--the theater, packaged goods, retailing, advertising. None of them came from broadcast television, because traditional broadcasters would never hire them. But all of them came because they were challenged and intrigued by this new medium, recognizing that the most critical measure of success would be making a single brand stand out from what would soon be the rapidly proliferating competition of multiple viewing options. That's something broadcasters never had to think about. The mandate of the broadcast networks was (and still is) to reach as many people as possible, with a broad-based mix of sitcoms, dramas, news, and sports. But at MTV we sensed that in an exploding television landscape, where people's options would soon increase tenfold, a paradigm shift was about to take place. There needed to be a whole new notion of TV: not linear, not about story lines with a  beginning, middle, and end, not about plot and continuity, but about mood and emotion. Until cable came along in the early eighties, people only identified with individual programs, rather that with a network. They might rush home to watch "Happy Days" or "Charlie's Angels," but a network itself had no "identity." As such, in the history of American television, no one has ever uttered the following phrase: "I feel like going home and watching a little CBS tonight." In contrast, MTV was truly a "postmodern" network. It was never really about the shows. It was about one idea, twenty-four hours a day--a pop-cultural identity. But most of all, it was about the audience and about connecting with the audience in a unique and meaningful way. Today, people say, "I feel like watching MTV" and you know exactly what they mean. Today, the broadcast networks are struggling after ten successive years of losing both viewers and their share of audience to cable. The number of sure-fire broadcast hits--the "Seinfelds" and "ERs" of their world--are down to fewer than a handful. And, although it's our dirty little secret, for those who keep score, MTV Networks will probably be more profitable this year than ABC, CBS, and NBC--combined. To be honest with you, that's actually a mixed blessing. Because we now run the risk of becoming the establishment. MTV has only gotten where it has by never becoming too complacent--by constantly reinventing itself--by celebrating each success with a resounding  "OK--what's next"--and by never taking ourselves too seriously. So it is appropriate that, as someone who has been part of MTV Networks almost from the  beginning, I get to address you today. Because our whole company was created with your  generation in mind. Yours was truly the first generation to grow up with us right from  the start--moving from Nickelodeon as children to MTV and Comedy Central as young adults--and by the time you've settled down a little bit, I hope you'll be watching VH1.  But while you were growing up with us, we were growing up with you. Over the last  seventeen years, MTV has become one of the most recognizable, yet polarizing, brands of all time, credited with setting trends in music, fashion, and youth culture, while simultaneously being held responsible for the entire decline of civilization as we know it. When it began, MTV was the loud, strident voice of irreverence and rebellion, of kids vs. parents (as in "I want my MTV!"); that tone was evident in the music, the programming, and even in the way the channel promoted itself. But we've also laid down a lot of cultural landmarks for your generation, and we've sought to play a more socially productive role in your lives than anything television has ever attempted. In the past seventeen years, MTV introduced middle America to urban street music with "Yo! MTV Raps"; raised millions for famine relief with "Live Aid"; helped engage young people in the political process, culminating with the "Choose or Lose" campaign and the election of Bill Clinton; and in general tapped into the hearts and minds of a generation with news and specials that one could only see on MTV. We've always operated as outsiders, challenging the conventional wisdom. We didn't know that it couldn't be done, so we just did it. We've been presumptuous. We've been obnoxious. We've been downright rude. And we've made mistakes. Many of them. But we haven't been safe. We haven't been predictable. We haven't trudged along a well-worn path to successful mediocrity. And we've never been afraid to fail. Of course, MTV wasn't exactly the first to come along and challenge the established powers that be. That's a great American tradition. Harriet Tubman, Walt Whitman, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Ida Mae Tarbell, Woodie Guthrie, Paul Robeson, Jackson Pollack, Billie Holiday, Miles Davis, Jack Kerouac, Malcolm X, Cesar Chavez, Lenny Bruce, Muhammad Ali, Bob Dylan, Curt Flood, Curt Cobain--the list is long and varied. Rabble-rousing is an American birthright. Despite a penchant for middle-class, middle-of-the-road homogeneity, America usually comes around to admiring--and rewarding--those who burn their bridges to convention and safety--and light up  the sky in the process. Even in the fifties, when post-war prosperity first gave rise to a discussion of  "corporate America," and when the role model of choice was the company man--and they certainly did mean man--there was an explosion of creativity in American culture. There was be-bop in the air, beat poetry on the page, and abstract expressionism on canvas. Yet the counterculture of the fifties is nothing compared to what you and your generation have the potential to create in the next millennium. As you take leave of Kenyon today, the world is being remade at a dizzying pace.  In America, entrepreneurialism and creativity are ascendant from Silicon Valley to Times Square. Around the world, opportunity has never been more plentiful, freedom never more genuine, and diversity never more possible. With your Kenyon education you are especially well prepared to seize this day.  You are prepared, in effect, for nothing in particular but everything in general, for the rigors of a life dictated by no one but you. Before I'm accused of waxing too poetic, let me be blunt. None of you should try to come up with the next MTV. Don't make the short-sighted choice of riding the wave of a phenomenon that's already begun to crest or cloning an already successful formula. You shouldn't want to. You see, what I'm trying to tell you is this: We don't need more copies. We need more  originals. There are originals out there in every industry. Some are fledglings. Others are just beginning to gain some traction in their respective arenas. Still others have yet to be born--they are ideas waiting to be discovered by people of passion and commitment and intelligence. People who respond when the rest of the world is going left by going right. People whose dreams matter to them and, later on, come to matter to the rest of us. There are works of art, political programs, social causes, ideas, even entire industries that do not exist today. Yet before you reach your parents' age they will. And you will be the instigators behind them. You have to be. By default, there's no one else. You can create a "South Park." Or a Broadway musical like Rent. Or a Netscape. Or a Yahoo. Or an amazon.com. Or a Hard Candy.  Or something we can't even imagine because the seed of the idea resides only in your head. MTV was started by a group of people not much older than you are now. Microsoft was started by a very stubborn nineteen-year-old who was convinced that the business school wizards at IBM and the Ph.D.s at Xerox were all wrong--and he was right. These are perhaps extreme examples. Certainly Bill Gates is a very unusual case.  And the Microsoft narrative has now traveled full circle--all the way from anti-establishment to anti-trust. But regardless of the details, there is often virtue--and on rarer occasions, even gold--to be found in challenging established modes and means. To take--in effect--the path of most resistance. It's true in the arts. It's true in academia. It's true in teaching.  It's true in entertainment. It's true in law and medicine and other professions. It's true in business. It's true in public service. I know that many of you in this class are going to law school. When you begin to study  the great Supreme Court opinions that have given shape and texture and context to so  much of American life, keep in mind how many of them are not the opinions of the  majority but of the Court's dissenters. Of course, traveling against the traffic is inherently risky. It's much easier to go with the flow. What's more, your intelligence and education afford you a great many advantages when you remain--quite content, perhaps--in the mainstream. But please, please, please, don't get too comfortable yet. You can take risks when you are young that you will never, ever have the courage or capacity to embrace again. People of every age contributed to the civil-rights revolution in this country. But it was the young--people precisely your age--who drove that movement, who seized  history and turned it on its head by the power of their passion. It's our job at MTV to know a lot about you. We know, for instance, that you are an  extremely hard-working generation. We know that you are the most inclusive, least-bigoted, generation in the history of America. You are truly a chosen group, entering the world at a time of unprecedented opportunity. The economic constraints and cultural straitjackets--those that have undermined the promise of so many previous generations--are falling before you.  You have youth, and you have an environment conducive to change. All you need now is an idea to believe in, the courage to pursue it, and the desire to never let up. It's customary, I believe, for commencement speakers to encourage the assembled graduates in the name of their parents and families. "Make them proud of you," the person at the podium is supposed to say. "Make us all proud." With your permission, I'll pass. For starters, your families and loved ones are already visibly proud of you. They are absolutely smitten with you.  So the "make us proud" bit seems, quite honestly, a little redundant here today. You see, we're looking for something more out of you. A lot more. Because we know who  you are. And we know what you're capable of. We know what you can do if you put your minds and souls to the test, if you project your passion and your commitment and your integrity into a world that always seems to run a deficit on the good things. We know what you can do if you think outside the box, if you challenge the norm and break the rules. So not your families, nor I, nor Kenyon will be satisfied by feelings of pride. That's just not enough. Don't just make us proud. Delight us. Surprise us. Shock us. Challenge us. Invigorate us. Astonish us. As a matter of fact,  astonish the hell out of us. As Cartman would say--"That would be sweet."

       Only 3?  I just realized, I think, two days ago, that I'm actually going on 3 mission trips this summer.  Does that sound a little ridiculous to you too? 1 - with my daughter Katie - Mustard Seeds 2 - middle school weekend - CMTS 3 - SPACEcrew - NYC I guess it's not as crazy as it sounds.  Each one of them has some pretty specific goals in mind, are with things or localities that we have ties with before, in some roundabout way, and all of them are pieces that are designed to be part of a movement, not just a one time summer trip.  I'm excited about them all, but most nervous about #1, like a wrote in a previous post. "Something mystical happens when you get over your motion sickness and begin to move with God." - McManus Expecting that God will move in the circumstances where we feel least confident, I think #1 will be big.  Maybe I will end up barfing sometime during that week...

       The DeShazer story  What a story  urlLink here.   You have to read it to really get it. Some snippets: - one of the bombers during WWII, one of the bleakest missions - captive by the Japanese, 40 months of imprisonment and torture, 34 of those in solitary confinement - started to fall in love with Jesus in prison - got released, came home, got a degree in missions, got married - went back to Japan as a missionary - planted 23 churches, including three from their home, and one in Nagoya, the city that he had bombed What the heck...  Got the link from a new blog I've been reading,  urlLink Looking Closer , which is written by a film/music critic for Christianity Today.  Remember, relevance to the culture is .... ok you remember.

       Christian Teens and P2P  Ahoy!! Read it  urlLink here  (requires watching an add from Salon.com) This has to got to be my favorite quote from the article: "And can Satan really be involved in the sharing of an Amy Grant hit single?" Hilarious. It is a good article though.  Would be a great discussions starter. On a related note, I stopped downloading free music about around the Fall of 03.  Prior to  that, I hadn't bought a CD in probably 3 years.  It was bad. Now, I have a line item in our budget titled 'Culture' for music and movies.  Like Erwin says, "Relevance to the culture is not an option." Here is a list of the CDs I have bought since I stopped downloading illegally:  Norah Jones (the latest, I can't remember the title) Evanescence - Fallen Clint Black - Nothin' But the Taillights (yard sale) Bebo Norman - Myself When I Am Real Jeremy Camp - Stay Hillsongs - Hope Mosaic - Ancient God (from Origins, probably the best of the list)  I also did the iTunes thing for the month of April when they were doing those free downloads from Pepsi bottles.  It was good while it lasted, but you can't turn those into MP3s very easily.  So you have to use the iTunes player.  And you can't move them from media to media.  Long story.  If you want details, google it.

       Mustard Seed  Well Katie and I are signed up to go to this  urlLink Mustard Seed camp  with Teen Missions. Some of you might have heard about Teen Missions, they send thousands of teenagers all over the world every summer.  Theoretically, I've got some issues with the approach that they have for sending students on mission trips.  However, at least one person I've talked to had a phenomenal experience with Teen Missions.  During her Boot Camp, God grabbed her life for the first time ever.  And she has held on tight since then, and currently serves as one of our middle school leaders at GCC.  So although I might not agree with the mobilization process that Teen Missions uses, I certainly cannot, and will not, deny that they can, and are, drawing students closer to Jesus. Frankly, I'm a little worried about this Mustard Seed camp.  No electricity, no cell phones, no pagers, no literature other than the Bible, no shorts, etc.  It is a real boot camp.  I think I'm too soft for it.  Hopefully, Katie and I will both love it and all those other silly worries will just fade away.  I have always said it would be a great experience for my kids to experience another country or culture.  This is along the same lines.

It was awesome.  (of course, I don't mean it was awesome the way he eats...)   He later sent me an email with something to the effect that I inspire him... No, no, its quite the other way around...

       Weekend Update  The weekend was good.  And it's not over yet.  The rest is going to be good too.  I'm sitting here watching my kids in a kiddie pool.  A perfect Sunday afternoon.  Fri: leader celebration at Grace. PM talked about being a solider. "There is nothing stronger than the heart of a volunteer." Oh and Bridge the Gap Sunday - 1,000 families gave financially.  $1.2M.  Wow.  Sat: time with Granny and Grandpa Missions Prep #4 with Gadget. Human knots, ropes, etc. Very fun.  The LC missions team came along.  Very exciting, it is not a bunch of missions teams, it is a movement of the younger generation.  Sun: CpR this am. SM talked about the Ephesus church, the gateway to the East. If the Church could grow in Ephesus, it can grow anywhere. Opened SEMP for all of high school.  Got two interested parties right away.  Yes.

I joined conference call this morning and just went off.  Not good, this is not the way we attract people to who we say our God is...  Ok, I'm going to go back to the call and be a lot nicer.  Maybe I'll even try to be helpful.

       Urbanization  From  urlLink An Unstoppable Force , ideas about urbanization:  Like many cities, Los Angeles inhales the nations and has the potential of exhaling the gospel.  Ralph Winter has proposed that the last great frontier for the gospel is the cities.  It is impossible to talk about the future without mentioning the cities.  While human history began in a garden, it ends in the city.  This is a planet of great cities. The suburban church is in many ways the natural development of the county-seat church, maintaining it's focus on family, community, and rural values. It's ironic that the word pagan finds its roots in a word meaning 'country dweller.'  Where once the pagan lived in the country and the danger of the city was to be Christianized, now Christians tend to live away from the cities and view the urban dweller as the true pagan.   I started really talking about the whole urbanization thing with my students that went off to college last summer.  An original idea that I really liked (I don't have many original ideas that I like) was to write them a letter instead of get them a gift for their graduation parties.  So in the letter was a list of things they should do during college.  And for each one of them, I wrote that they should go on an inner city missions trip sometime during college, simply because of this idea of urbanization.  And the fact that, if you know about Howard County, Maryland, it's just about the epitmoe of suburbia.  If anything, these kids need to get out and experience life in the city for real.  They need to live it and not just see it on TV.  An experience like that would do so much for making them more full, more able to engage the world around us, more in touch with compassion, justice, mercy.

       7 world changes relevant for missions  The full article  urlLink here . 1.  24/x7 global communications 2.  Largest population migration in history.  More than 50% of the world now lives in urban areas. 3.  Global economy.   4.  The center of the Christian faith is shifting from the West to Latin America, Asia and Afria. 5.  There are now more than 3000 mission agencies and entities. 6.  Churches are reclaiming the front line of missions. 7.  The laity are being empowered and released.  A release of God's people unparalleled since Acts 8.  Wow, I totally see it.  All 7 make sense to me.  The coolest is #7.  I know I've said it lots before, but we have a younger generation that needs to be released into mission as a crucial and integral part of their existence.  They cannot exist without being called into an epic story.

       An email from Erwin  So I wrote an email to Erwin McManus thanking him for the Origins conference and all his team did to serve us with it.  I figured it was the least that I could do. Here is a snippet of what I got back, written by one of his personal assistants. "I just wanted to pass on Erwin's sincere thanks for your encouragement.  He has read every one of his emails and has been truly touched and energized by emails such as yours.   He thanks you for your words, and wishes you all the adventure that the Lord has in store." So wait a minute, he's been touched and energized by an email that I wrote...  Now that's pretty cool.  It's really the least that I could do.  And he wishes me the adventure...  Dude.

       TP scrapbook  Some of you that follow this blog have heard me talk about TP, a student that was in a high school guys small group that I led for 4 years.  You know he's had some rough times with addictions and such.  Anyway, he is graduating from high school this weekend and his mother is asking people to jot down thoughts, stories, verses, wisdom, etc. for a scrapbook for him. Here is my contribution:   My favorite memory of Tommy was the time him, Adam Holt and myself served as valet parking for a family friend's wedding party. Consistently, when there are boys and cars, there is adventure. This night was no different as we had the Price's 4x4. After some time parking cars and attending to guests, the reception started and we had little to do, except the truck, a huge plot of land and some snacks. So Tommy decided to give us a driving tour of the property. While driving around, it seemed like he decided to take a random turn off the road to go up a clearing to a light in the distance. And we got the Suburban stuck in the mud.  I think it was only slightly stuck at first.  Then Tommy put it in 4x4 and floored it.  By then, it was stuck good.  And the truck was covered in lots of mud.  We wouldn't have wanted it any other way.   There in the dark, in the mud, with a whole wedding reception going on up the hill, we sat and contemplated what to do. There was my SUV, Adam's Jeep, and the tractor in the garage.  And of  course, Adam and I wondered, "Where exactly is that light you were looking for, Tommy?" Eventually, we got my SUV and towed the Suburban out of the mud hole. After we got it back on the road, the hole was easily 12-13 inches deep. And really muddy. It's probably my favorite memory because, like most boys and men, we had an adventure.  But adventure isn't the only element in this story. This story, in many ways, symbolizes a lot about the grand story of life, and how God involves us in His epic story of reaching our  world for His praise. Like that night, it's easy for most of us to get stuck in the mud when you  are looking for a light in the distance.  Many times, God calls us to go through hard and sticky situations and circumstances, risking a lot of what we have and think in order to be misunderstood for His purposes and glory. It requires a great deal of trust to go off the beaten path when you believe the true light is calling to you.  And it really helps having a group of friends with you, who share in the adventure of seeking, the dare of not knowing, the risk of getting stuck somewhere with you. Tommy, my hope is that your life continues to embody adventure, risk and good friends willing to get muddy with you, all so God can be praised.  Always your dteam leader, -tony

       Missionaries for Dinner  We had  urlLink these  missionaries for dinner.  And  urlLink these .  Wow it was a great time of hearing how God is moving in the world.  And to hear their story and testimony of how they went into the field.  To hear how God places someone in a specific circumstance for a specific time, for specific people... that's so much fun to hear.  And to hear how God transforms a heart to care for a specific country and group of people that they have never been exposed to before.  That is a God thing. Like Erwin said, "...people who can speak to what they have heard in conversation with God." Very fun.

       Ministry vs. Me  During the big outside party this am, one of our mission leaders asked me if he could ask me a 'ministry related question.'  It got me thinking.  Our previous church experience, almost 9 years ago, included lots of activities ministry related, including youth leader, adult Sunday school and D teaching in the church's Christian school as a full time teacher.  So Sunday's were anything but a break for us.  She would have parents asking her questions about students while she was at church trying to, in very stereotypical terms, fellowship and worship.  We were able to easily comparmentalize ministry and life.  Some Sunday's we just skipped church because we didn't want to have to deal with all the ministry/work stuff while were trying to regroup spiritually at church.  Overall, I think that was really unhealthy.  Of course, it wasn't intentional on anyone's part.  And I know that when you go into vocational ministry, you definitely lose some obscurity. But it got me thinking, doesn't God's mission require us to be fully engaged?  Shouldn't a  Christ-follower be a wholly fully devoted person?  Spiritual life shouldn't be segmented between who we are on Sundays as a worshipper versus another night as youth leader or a day job as a teacher.  And I'm happy to say that I've never felt the same way at GCC.  Ministry, life, who I am has always been all together.  I'm a husband, a father, an engineer, a youth leader and it is all put together by God for a unique purpose.  And the overlap of all the elements makes every piece even better.  I am good engineer because I have a life outside of work, my family loves to be a part of the family ministering to students, etc... Just thinking off the top of my head. With regards to the conversation this morning, I told him, "Sure, definitely!"

       Bridge the Gap Sunday  Well today was the big one service on the land.... Wow.  It was pretty incredible, all those people.  And it poured rain like all last night, but this morning, it was an awesome morning.  Very cool.   PM spoke about the seed, and how there are people that came to Christ from someone else going before them, and how this property is a huge planting/seeding/reaping opportunity.  It was some good stuff.   On a side note, my youngest daughter got a little lost, and ended up down in front in his arms.  Funny. They also had the elder team and the pastoral team do some groundbreaking with some shovels.  That was cool.  And they let each family have a chance to do that, and everyone took home a cup of dirt from the land with some seeds in it, so we could watch both our church and the seeds grow at the same time.  Pretty neat. A few pictures are  urlLink here.

       Weekend Update  This weekend has been fun so far... Except I'm working right now... Last night was Carni Night... very fun.  SM did an awesome job as usual.  CP our youth admin/catalyst brought a visitor, I think she is hooked as a volunteer.  Funny like that.  Once people experience the ministry, they probably either are way too scared of it, or want totally in.  Had a very late meal with K. Hung out today with some good friends of ours that used to go to Grace.  Some very cool things happening with them in Montgomery County.  They are helping pull together married small groups in MD for McLean Bible, powerhouse of the Beltway. Went to a birtdhay party for a couple that are old friends of ours tonight.  They turn 40.  Yikes.  40 in age, definitely not in spirit.  It was great to hang out with them. Tomorrow is Bridging the Gap Sunday, where we have church on the new property.  It's going to be pretty neat, except, earlier tonight, it was pouring.  If there is bad weather, we do church like normal.  Which will be kind of a disappointment...  On the way home tonight, D and I stopped in the park and ride lot to pray for tomorrow and for the land and the building.  My prayer is that the building  brings us even closer as a church to God's mission in the world and that we don't worship the building.  We will see. K leaves for Kstan on Monday.  Him and two other guys from the 03 boys are going.  Very exciting.  These poor guys have just had a whirlwind - they've been home from college after finishing their freshmen year just less than a week and then off they go to Kstan.  Pretty crazy but what a great experience.  K's got this great attitude about not knowing at all what to expect.  I think that's what Erwin refers to as bringing more chaos into our environments...

       From Erwin - 3 marks of a disciple  1.  God taught - Jer 33 What God says is not hearsay for you. Give yourselves of helping everyone who knows Christ to hear his voice.  John 10 If God is silent to you Â– Christianity is irrelevant to you. Pour your life into the Scriptures Your Christianity should not be rumors about God.  2. Godd moved - Ex ?? You become holy in the sight of the world You love what is right and true Passions are transformed You do right because you long for God Who are you when you are totally alone, when no one is looking? When pagans come to Christ Â– they get as close as they can to life with Christ When Christians come to Christ Â– they see how close to the wrong edge they can get, they try to get away with things that are questionable.  3.  God inspired - Joel 2:28 God inspired Dreaming dreams beyond our wildest imagination Problems with hyperventilation when you talk about your life with God  Movement of dreamers and visionaries The contemporary church does not have the same idea because we have Â– managers, administrators, preachers, teachers Die to your own dreams Â– enliven others dreams Too many pastors are manipulating Dreams/visions are born in the lives of people in the church  Of course, I'm selling the session short here.  He told lots of stories about some pretty amazing circumstances, etc.  I think it was the best session.  It also ended with a video collage of some images from the people at Mosaic set to U2's "Beautiful Day".  And the very end was a commissioning ceremony for all the church planters that were at the conference.  They were prayed for and anointed with oil.  Very cool. Which incidentally, is a very interesting topic - church planting.  But alas, for another time...

       Fast Asleep  I rocked my 3 year old daughter, E, to sleep tonight.  Most of the time, she is still awake when I lay her in her bed.  But every once in a while, every so often, she will fall asleep while she is in my arms.  It's quite an experience.  To feel her breath on my neck, to feel the heat rising off of her scalp as she sweats when sleeping, to feel her heartbeat every so slightly on my chest, those are things that I can't even really explain.  My trying to describe them isn't even close. How long do we get with our children?  How long will life and the world and their will let us cradle them, hug them, kiss them, pray with them?  How much time do we have while they sit with us in our laps, listen to music, be quiet as the night comes. I'm sure it will not be long enough.  But if we are willing to take risks for God, if we are willing to be misunderstood for His sake, to go to the dangerous places, literally and figuratively, our children will go before us and advance the Kingdom in ways we could never imagine.  And when we see that, we will be glad that instead of keeping our kids in our laps and coddling them to sleep, we released them to be a part of God's glorious epic story to win the nations to Himself.

      Erwin on early adopter versus innovator -  Who was the first person to eat a sea cucumber?  Someone who would die if they didn't eat.  In the same way, Christ calls us to be innovators.   Are you willing to ask God, "What do You want me to do, that may cost my life, but I will point towards You with my last breath?"

       Erwin on living by faith  When people live by faith, they act like this:  - if we can do this without God, it doesn't count - We are supposed to hear the voice of God, instead we borrow each other sermons - People need leaders who can speak to what they have heard in conversation with God.  He told a story later about his son and him teaching him to: - listen to the voice - identify who the voice was - treat God speaking to you as a gift, nurture it, value it, obey it.  If you do these things, it will be come clearer and clearer. - if you don't obey it, God's voice will stop, and you will get to a point where you never remembered that God spoke to you, and your heart will become stone.  I've heard a lot more about this idea of late.  It's both scary and exhilarating to think that the Creator of the universe has an audible voice.... and uses it to speak to us, to guide and direct us, to engage us in His purpose for the world.

       Angels  This song from Hillsongs really affected me on the plane ride home for some strange reason.  Images of my children just kept popping into my head, and the screaming desire to have them be passionate about Jesus just weighed heavy on my heart.  I'm not usually such an emotional person, I have no idea why.  It was weird.  I had to play this song over and over, probably 10 times in a row.  Weird.  But therapeutic.  Angels Words and Music by Marty Sampson   The holiest place there could ever be All you can do is bow Before the one who made heaven and earth Before the Almighty God For him alone  Sing with the angels Sing with the angels Singing the name of the lord Singing the name of the lord  For every soul  He gave it all Given for all of mankind Eternal life is his alone Given to all who believe  In him alone  Jesus

       Faith Love Hope   From Origins:  v.2 faith hope love we don't believe these 3 can transform the church I Cor 13 Col 1 I Thes These 3 churches were models to their communities and to other churches.  How?  Was there a process/model?  If so, why didn't Paul write it down for us? We have bought into a method/process/strategy Like a CEO, seminaries are training the church CEO  Paul is trying to tell us that there is a primal instinct that erupts Faith hope love How did the church explode? Maybe faith, hope and love are undersold and underbought - live by faith - known by love - voice of hope (right from the Mosaic values)

       Safe Theology  McManus on a 'safe theology'   The truth of the matter is that the center of God’s will is not a safe place but the most dangerous place in the world.  God fears nothing and no one.  God moves with intentionality and power.  To live outside of God’s will puts us in danger, to live in his will makes us dangerous. How could we ever think the Christian faith would be safe when its central metaphor is an instrument of death?  How did we ever develop a safe theology from such a dangerous faith?

       Church shopping  McManus on church shopping...   "We're looking for a church that meets our needs."  The phenomenon of church shoppers has profoundly shaped the contemporary church.  The entire conversation is not about relevance but convenience.  The focus is not in serving the world; the church itself became the focal point.  This move has made the pastor the only minister, while making the members the only recipients of ministry.  What is lost in this process is an army of healers touching the planet. The cultural environment because comfortable and the gospel shifted from a church 'on mission' to a church that supported missions.

       Collect the barf bags  Well I leave for LA first thing tomorrow morning.  Here I am, the missions coordinator, and ironically enough, I get motion sick.    And I'm not a great traveller first thing in the morning.  Heck, I'm not a great anything first thing in the morning.  Anyway, to the Origins conference tomorrow.  It should be great once I get over the initial travelling issues... Pray for the fam if you think of it.  Everytime I travel for ministry, something very odd happens around the house.  One summer it was a tornado that flipped a glass patio table.  Anyway, the Enemy knows....

       I'm not stalking you but  So last night, I entered into the foray of conversing with students via their blogs.  Up until now, I've read a lot of their blogs, but never commented or such.  But I started last night.  I guess it will be ok.  I'm not sure why I was hesitant to do it, and am still a little... but just not sure why.  But I think with each comment I add, I will start it with "I'm not stalking you but..." haha that's funny, I like it.

       9th grade nonprogress  On the 9th grade trip front, there is no progress.  We worked pretty hard to put together a pretty good leader team.  A leader team I'm pretty proud of.  ML, who I have led trips with before, who really loves students.  MM, a college student who is seeking youth ministry as a profession, EG, another college kid who went with me to SEMP in 2000 when he was a wee lad.  Both MM and EG were in my 03 dteam.  And no response from these 9th graders, who I would have thought would have been all over this trip.  What's up with that?  I've had a head cold all weekend and this morning had intentions to go to the Warehouse and make another announcement about it.  But then I sat in big church and didn't feel like bothering.  D and I talked about it, and she was like, 'You better go do that.'   If we want kids to go on this, with the strategy that it sets them up to do even more strategic missions in the next years of their high school experience, if we believe that kids will grow immensely in their experience and knowledge of sharing their faith with their friends or anyone on the street, if we think that it's worth it for them to learn to share their faith in their own culture before in another culture.... We are totally going to have to  fight for these kids to come.  One easy thing the Devil wants is for us to sit back and say, "It's not worth it and I'm too lazy to do the work for it." I'm kind of surprised as I write this - in light of the past few months, I didn't see what needed to be done... Anyway, I made the announcement.  9th graders - start pounding down my door about this trip...  I know it will be worth it.

       Missions Prep #3 Update  We had our #3 prep mtg on Saturday night, easily the best one yet...  So much energy, kids in tune with seeking God and being used by Him this summer, very neat and encouraging to see.  We handed out the financials so people could see who and how much had been given to their support.  To me, that's when the trip becomes real.  When you have sent out your letters and money starts coming in.  No turning back, it's a reality. We then did the Myers Briggs test and talked about giftedness and unity from Romans 12.  Then looked at the  urlLink Hardy Personality  and then looked at Phil 2 and Christ's attitude towards others.  This was the first time I had ever used the Hardy Personality to prepare teams and I was astounded.  Wow, what a tool.  My team could have talked about those for probably another hour, easily.  And they were so excited at the level of depth we were getting to as a team.  Statements like, "This is so cool, I'm really getting to know you guys," were said over and over.  It was really neat.  I wish I had found that thing years ago.  I asked one of my NYC team members to adapt it and make it test with a scaling, like from 0-10, fill in where you are at from the basic idea of each question.  That would be even better.  It's two great great teams that have come together. Our intro idea was this - from CS Lewis:  For the Christian, there are strictly speaking, no chances.  A secret master of ceremonies has been at work.  Christ, who said to the disciples, ‘You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you,’ can truly say to every group of Christian friends, ‘You have not chosen one another, but I have chosen you for one another.’  The friendship is not a reward for our discrimination and good taste in finding one another out.  It is the instrument which God reveals to us to each the beauties of all the others.

      I didn't realize this, but GCC is turning 20 years old this year.  I just got a little flyer in the mail talking about it and thought it would be some good points to give people an idea about the size of GCC:  - 1350 households - 20% growth for six of the last eight years - 30+ full or part time staff - 500+ teenagers - 500 children cared for by 300 volunteers - 25 ministries to adults - 14+ ministries available to people outside of GCC - 8 missionaries directly from our body, 15+ overall - 2004 operating budget of about $2.1M Wow.  Very cool.  I dream that we continue to grow disciples and not programs.

      Another great study tonight, with our couples group. II Peter 2 4For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them to hell,[1] putting them into gloomy dungeons to be held for judgment;  5if he did not spare the ancient world when he brought the flood on its ungodly people, but protected Noah, a preacher of righteousness, and seven others;  6if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them to ashes, and made them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly;  7and if he rescued Lot, a righteous man, who was distressed by the filthy lives of lawless men  8(for that righteous man, living among them day after day, was tormented in his righteous soul by the lawless deeds he saw and heard)--  9if this is so, then the Lord knows how to rescue godly men from trials and to hold the unrighteous for the day of judgment, while continuing their punishment.  If God can rescue the righteous, out of a culture that is dark, if God has a distinct purpose in the people of light being in a specific place for a specific time for a specific reason, if God can hold the unrighteous... this really spoke to me about attitude, perspective, intentionality in all facets of where God has uniquely and divinely placed us.

       Background  Teen Missions International has been in the business of preparing and sending students on summer mission trips all over the world since 1970.  Based in Merritt Island Florida, students participate in a boot camp prior to leaving the country.  This summer TMI sent out 1307 students with 294 team leaders. In the summer of 2004, TMI started a 4-6 year old program focused on the basic message of salvation and hearing from missionaries from other countries.  Having always been intrigued about TMI and thinking it would be really fun for my 6 year old daughter, we signed up. Mustard Seed Boot Camp lasted 4 days and 3 nights and was co-located with other Boot Camps happening at the same time on Merritt Island.  With the addition of the 4-6 year old program, TMI now has something for kids from 4 years old to high school.  Mustard Seed is from 4-6 years old, with one or both parents attending.  Peanuts is from 7-9 and is a week long, with no parents.  PreTeen is from 10-13 and then the Teen program is above that from 14-21.   Leaders  There were four leaders for Mustard Seeds.  Kathy was the overall director and Mustard Seeds was her vision.  She also serves as the co-director of TMI overall.  She brought her sister Barbara in to do music.  Linda was a lady from the Finance department that was the leader of the 'Green' team.  Cindy was the leader of the 'Red' team and was on a furlough of sorts from two years in Zambia.  Her family (husband, two teenage sons and her) had spent two years doing AIDS Orphans Rescue in Zambia at the TMI base there.  They had come back to the States in April, met contacts to raise additional funds and were getting ready to lead a Zambia team through Boot Camp and taking them back to Zambia with them.  At the end of the summer, the students would come back home, leaving Cindy and her husband there.  (They are leaving their teenagers home this time) By far, having a leader who had done cross cultural missions was a major advantage.   Schedule/Program  The schedule looked something like this: 06.30 - wake up (yeah...) 07.00 - breakfast 08.00 - program time 09.00 - the Obstacle Course (they had a mini one for the little kids) 10.00 - snack/craft 11.00 - program time 12.00 - cleanup 12.30 - lunch 01.30 - quiet time - on a big mat in the center of our program area, with everyone 02.30 - program time 04.00 - swim time - definitely the best time of the day 05.00 - cleanup 06.00 - dinner 07.00 - evening rally 08.00 - lights out  Program time consisted of a variety of things including music, missionary speakers and crafts.  Music was done by one leader, most of the time teaching the kids new music from a CD and using hand motions.  They really loved it.  The music teacher also had an assortment of music instruments from different countries that she rotated among the kids.  They loved that too. TMI has a team called Missionaries to America, which is a group of young people that come to America for an extended period of time, do ministry here, go to Boot Camp and then return to their home countries.  Mustard Seeds either heard from an individual MTA or a group of them a few times a day.  Sometimes the MTAs would do a puppet show, music or a short talk. Most of the program time centered on the colors of the wordless book. The kids learned memory verses for each color and then went off and did crafts based on the color and verse.  Craft included a wooden cross with different things glued to it, putting together cloth swatches of the wordless book together (these were sent out with the high school teams when they went out) and other various crafts. The kids also decorated cookies that were used by Teen Missions for local ministry around the base, which included firehouses and nursing homes.   Participants  Two teams totaling about 25 Mustard Seeds and their parents. 11 families on our team from all over the country including Hawaii and California. On our team: 7 homeschoolers 7 had prior TMI experiences - 3 from siblings - 4 from parents that had been team members/leaders There were also two grandmothers that had come with their grandsons.  They had lots of spunk.   Guidelines  Like its called Boot Camp is pretty tough.  No shorts, no reading material other than the Bible, no electronic devices, no snacks, no electricity, no running water.  You get a food tray and a bowl and a canteen and cup when you get there.  At each meal, you walk up to the dining hall where they give you your food on your tray/bowl, you walk back to the area where you eat and when you are done, you go up to the washing area where you wash all that stuff.  Washing entails 4 big bins in a line, the first one to rinse off particles of food, the second one to scrub with soap, the third to rinse off soap and the fourth one to sanitize.  You are to eat all your food at every meal.  There are outhouses and there are toilets and showers both with no running water.  To go to the toilet, you pour a bucket of water down the bowl when you are finished.  Used toilet paper goes into another bucket to be thrown away later.  (I experienced similar bathroom conditions in the Dominican Republic in 1993).  You could bucket shower as well.  There was pool time every day as long as there were no thunderstorms.  There was a 'rally' every evening, which was a worship and teaching time. Older kids go through training during Boot Camp with both evangelistic skills such as sharing the Gospel, puppets, etc., as well as work project training such as bricklaying, pouring concrete, etc.   Does it Work?  I had the following questions going into the experience.  First, does TMI work in getting kids to be mobilized for mission?  Secondly, wouldnÂ?t we be growing kids better in having kids go through the experience with leaders that were connected to them via the local church and throughout the year?  TMI does not allow local youth ministry leaders to come with their students.  You can, of course, sign up to be a leader of a team.  But coming along with a local ministry is not within their context.  And finally, would you send your child back? Since our team had 7 people that had previous TMI experiences, I did an informal survey with them.  It was a good mix of people, from those that had been on teams in high school, those that had been on a team and came back as a leader, and those that had siblings go through TMI trips. For the first question, I think the answer is yes, overall.  I went in to the experience wondering how well Boot Camp prepared kids for mission. But I think the actual goal is to use Boot Camp for discipline.  Getting kids excited for worldwide missions is probably more a function of the actual mission experience, after they leave Boot Camp.  One of our parents who had led teams for 7 or 8 years talked about how a majority of her team members had gone on to be missionaries or in full time ministry.  I donÂ?t believe that full time ministry is better than secular work, in fact, I think the compartmentalization is dangerous for the Church.  However, I do believe that the observation shows a level of intentionality that is a healthy by product of people living a life on mission. I spent a few minutes chatting with Bob Bland, the director and founder.  I asked him to tell me the overall principle, after doing this for over 30 years.  He stated to start something and stick to it.  He also talked about I Cor 13 and the idea of putting away childish things when you become an adult.  His take was that we all can decide when its time to grow up, and some people simply refuse to.  Hopefully, Boot Camp is a time when people choose to grow.   For the second question, I got mixed responses.  The big variable here is the local church.  In some instances, parents had a great deal of mistrust towards their local church youth ministry.  In that case, the question is really invalid.  In other cases, parents could see the value in that kind of leadership.  One parent did mention that releasing your child happens before you know it. Thirdly, I would probably send my child back.  If I sent my 6 year old back, it would be in a few years, like 8 or 9 for Peanuts.  Also, I think 4 might be a little young for Mustard Seeds.  We had some 4 year olds that just couldnÂ?t deal.   If a high schooler asked me what I thought of them going to TMI, I would encourage it, with the caveat that the year after, they come back and be a part of what their local church is doing for missions.  I believe that we have to encourage kids to be in the context of what the local church is doing for missions whenever we can, because the local church is (or should be) the means by which the essential task gets done.

      Here is a short summary/prayer followup letter that I sent out. I am working on a more in depth follow up that I will post later this week... Thanks for praying...   Hi All,  Thanks so much for praying for Katie and I for the past few days while we were at Boot Camp with Teen Missions.  To give you a little background, Teen Missions has been in operation for about 30 years preparing and sending hundreds of high school students all over the world on missions trips every summer.  I've been intrigued about it for a little while and when they offered a 4-6 year old program for the first time this summer,we thought we would go to experience it first hand.  Boot Camp pretty much describes it - no running water, no electricty,hot Florida heat, sleeping in tents, and mosquitos all the time (160 bites between the two of us).  It was definitely a rough time for both of us, but we made it through.  In the meantime, Katie had fun hearing from missionaries from other countries, making lots of crafts about sharing the Gospel story, and doing typical camp stuff, like pool time, story time and evening 'rallys'.  It's a hard thing to put your child through some suffering deliberately.  Most of the time, Katie handled it well enough.  But there were certainly times when the bugs, the heat, the Boot Camp rules, and the lack of sleep got to her, as it did with most of the kids there.  Needless to say, those things got to me too.  My hope is that as we both process through this experience, it would make us more compassionate towards the world, less tied to our material possessions and more eager to share Christ with those that don't know Him.  Once again, thanks for thinking and praying for us.  We know that your prayers were vital to our experience there. Love, tony and katie

      Well in my spare time, I put together a quick talk about mission. It's sort of getting some thoughts together for a sendoff kind of thing for the summer trips, I don't know if I will get the opportunity to really use it or not. But I like doing this kind of thing. I love to speak to students when I can, when it's the right venue and all.  When someone asks you to speak, its a funny dynamic.  Suddenly, you have total freedom to say what you want, and someone wants you to be able to do that.  They've given you liberty to say what you want.  It's funny like that.   Anyway, here are my very rough notes.  ==== you are on mission every person  the Bible is a cohesive picture of people on mission the overall theme is consistent, people called into a bigger purpose than themselves  1 Gen 12 -  your blessings are unique God has designed you for a specific purpose  2 Acts 17 Paul was distressed by the idols in the city Do we get distressed like that? Do we greieve for our friends?  story - TP are we distressed by how our friends live?  3 Matt28 God calls you to make disciples to make people thirst for God teach them to walk with Him its about knowing God's book, and hearing His voice  SPACE has got some momentum I don't know if what we are doing is right or not If we will be succsssful or not But I believe this is accordign to the heart of God He wants us to care for the poor To engage our community To so love the people that live here, that we strive to make a difference  Darwin awards - rocket Do we generate skid marks? Are we moving with God with that much energy and momentum? Are you bored with your life?  Food fight - Glenn was on a specific purpose and mission Are we on mission like that?  ====  or something like that...

      Every few months, I drop in on the Missions Task Force at GCC.  Most of the time, it's to update them on what is happening on the student side of the Body.  It is usually a pretty fun time for me, as I get a few minutes to talk about SPACE and everyone there is really intersted.  It's cool. I went last night to give them an update, and thought, lucky blog reader, that you might like to see it too. So here it is. All in all, its kind of a God given dream and vision come true...  ===  GCC Youth Ministries SPACE summer missions  Trip Breakouts: Light Company – 6th – 8th graders: Service based weekend working at CMTS.

      Like all 6 year olds, K is getting big into music.  She wants her own CD walkman and the other day her grandparents took her shopping and they bought her a CD, her first CD that she has ever picked out... Scary.... It's scary because I think music has a profound influence on our culture.  And at the age of 6, I think we as parents have to be super careful. For Mustard Seeds, we are going to bring an MP3 player for the plane ride.  And I got a double headphone jack.  And, of course, I picked out our music.  It's going to be fun to be able to listen to the same music... Here are some of the tracks:  Ashton, Becker, Dente - Angels Ashton, Becker, Dente - Song of Reconciliation Ashton, Becker, Dente - No Other Chris Tomlin - Enough Chris Tomlin - Not to Us FFH - Fly Away Hillsongs - Angels Hillsongs - Glory Hillsongs Kids - Every Move I Make Mosaic - Closer Than Breathing Mosaic - If I Step Mosaic - No One Above You Mosaic - What You See Mosaic - Invisible Mosaic - I Live For You Mosaic - Nothing is Better Chris Tomlin / Crowder, David Band / Hall, Charlie Band - Famous One Crowder, David Band / Hall, Charlie Band / Tomlin, Chris Band - Prepare the Way Rebecca St James - Lamb of God Rebecca St James - Blessed Be Your Name Steven Curtis Chapman - Live Out Loud Steven Curtis Chapman - Jesus Is Life Steven Curtis Chapman - Magnificent Obsession Third Day - Come Together Bebo Norman / Caedmons Call / City On A Hill / Sing Alleluia - Holy Is Your Name Newsboys - Joy dc Talk - Between You and Me dc Talk - Colored People Keith Green - You are the One  PS - Funny thing, K is a huge Keith Green fan....

      Spent a little time poking around  urlLink Christian Associates  which is the mission agency the McNishes are going to Italy with.  They are seeking high impact leaders to plant high impact churches all throughout Europe.  Here is their definition of a high impact leader:     * pursue a vital relationship with God over their lifetimes     * maintain a learning posture in all areas of life     * seek a biblical perspective on life and leadership     * cultivate personal integrity and authenticity     * develop healthy relationships with family, co-workers, and the community     * pursue their life purpose and calling     * develop dynamic mentoring relationships     * discover and develop their own giftedness as well as giftedness in others How do you rate?  Is there a low impact leader, and what would that look like?

      finally...  rough thoughts after a few weeks of processing thoughts and ideas from  urlLink Origins ... and listening to some of McManus' messages...   Principle-Relevance to the culture is not optional *-Shengs will engage culture via active watching of movies *-we will have a line item in family budget for culture (movies, entertain, music, etc.) *-SPACEcrew meetings might evolve from just launch planning to including ideas and concepts about being active in mission (this is hard to articulate)  Principle-every NT church had heresy and immorality because they had prebelievers involved in community *-we will articulate that friends of students have an open invitation to every Launch   Principle-Mission is why the church exists *-how many students can we get involved in Launches and Mission trips? can we shoot for 50% within 3 years of starting SPACe?  Principle-Faith and safety are closer tied today than faith and risk. If you have faith, you will be successful -> false principle.  *-what things are we attempting that can only fail unless God accomplishes (God accomplishes relationships, tasks, thoughts - SPACE involves relationships of people, getting tasks done, acting upon thoughts) *-can we attempt things that can only fail unless God accomplishes them?  Principle-We need to live lives that are active in listening for God's voice and call. *-are we spending time in God's word and listening for His audible voice? Not only the leaders, but the people/students we lead. Does the worldview we teach to students include this aspect of spiritual growth?  I'm not sure I'm totally done with this, but I think its a good start...

      So at the K graduation, all the kids got their final books that they wrote.  Volunteers in their classes typed their stories up, typeset them and bound them just like real books.  It was cool.  On the backpage, it had an About the Authors page. One of the families we have gotten to know this year live in our neighborhood and work full time for the Church of God.  They had pastored two churches previously and are now area directors for the denomination.  They have two kids in Kindergarten, and one of them wrote, On his Authors page: - S wants to be a pastor when he grows up. - Jesus is the most important person in his family. Wow.  Those are quite the statements.

      I got together with one of my 03 dteam guys tonight, T.  I've written a bit about him before.  Tonight as I was driving out to meet him, I just prayed that God would use me, that God would give me the right words, that we would just have a real conversation about life, and stop just playing with nice conversation.  I think that part of my prayer was really answered.   We talked a lot about the existence of God, whether the Bible is true or not, how God can't or should be able to do something outside the realm of his nature.  Most of it made me a little frustrated.  But that's ok.  I appreciated the dialogue. What I don't appreciate, what I am incensed about, what keeps me up at night when I let it, is that his parents have gained the whole world, literally, and have lost their son's soul.

      K hung out with our fam last night for a few hours, telling loads and loads of stories about Kstan.  Definitely a great experience, propelling him even more into missions.  Very cool.   So many stories... He said the most interesting was probably hearing a believer in one of the villages give the Bridge illustration, but one that was slightly changed to be specific for Muslims.  Really brought out some intersting things for K to process regarding the Contextualization Scale... And, believe me, I've got lots of questions about it too.  But I think it's good for him to be thinking about that.  More about the C-scale  urlLink here.  K also mentioned: - the trip made him see that the world is pretty big.  the idea that Americans have this inherent right - to be happy, to be wealthy, to be comfortable - really annoys him. - what is the core of the Gospel in the New Testament?  because we (the Church) disagree about a lot of other stuff that doesn't really matter. It was great to hear all the stories and see all the pictures.  I didn't want him to be overwhelmed with our questions, but yet I wanted him to be able to share all that he wanted to.  Sometimes, people come home and they get frustrated because their friends and family here only want to listen for a short time, when they have absolutely tons to share. K gave me the questions that his team leader gave them for debriefing too.  I don't know if I've mentioned it here before, but debriefing is always key.  So I grab as much as I can from people who have debriefed or done debriefings, especially for cross cultural ministry.  I've got probably about 10-12 different documents with questions, studies on specific passages, activities, etc. K brought me back a miniature dutar, which looks like this -   He also brought me a set of muslim prayer beads.  33 beads, and when they pray through them 3 times, they have covered the 99 gods.  I asked him if it was safe to bring into my house and at one point, D put them on her Bible and said, "I probably shouldn't put them on my Bible..."

      As you might imagine, DC is abuzz with the preparations for the state funeral for President Reagan, the first in over 30 years.  There are tons of preparations going on around town between the arrival at Andrews Air Force Base, to the coffin at the Capitol for the public to walk by, to the ceremony at the National Cathedral.  The news is saying that this is akin to the 9/11 memorial service that was held at the Cathedral.  The anticipation even drifts out to the Beltway, where major delays are expected as the casket travels from arrival to the city. I grew up right outside of DC and have lived here my whole life.  One of the great things about DC is that there is so much to do and all the good stuff is free.  The Smithsonian, which all the museums are part of, is all free.  Yup, everything, including the National Zoo.  So living so close, we hardly ever take advantage of it. On the flip side, because DC is the capital, in our post 9/11 world, there is always an undercurrent of "what if?"  I remember a good friend telling me that there were snipers on the rooftops of the Senate and House buildings when he worked there during the first Gulf War.  Along the same lines, we always think twice before we go downtown these days, just for the safety aspect.  Is there a big event?  Lots of tourists going to be there?  If so, we usually pass.  DC is an awesome city, but if there is lots going on, it might be better to skip.  After all, that is the safe thing to do. On the flip side, like what they said at Origins, we will continue to live in an increasingly violent world.  No doubt about it, terror alerts are now a fact of life.  In the US, we should get used to it, like other parts of the world have been used to it.    Like what Alex McManus said, "We have grown to believe that God’s kingdom is not about life and death." (If you haven't noticed, I've been thinking about this 'safe' issue a bit lately.) Below is a very well done graphic about Reagan's funeral.  Linked from washingtonpost.com.  You might need to login (free registration).  UPDATED: took the graphic out and put a link in instead.  easier to read that way... graphic  urlLink here

      You ever have one of those Sundays where you feel so priviledged to be a part of something?  Where you have been given some insight, a special view into what God wants a family to look like?  Where a community laughs hysterically together at some ridiculous line and a few minutes later weeps together for something lost that will be found later?  Yesterday was it for me, in 3rd service at GCC. A recap here won't even come close to being fair, but I'll try anyway: - our middle school pastor coming in dressed as a knight with a youthworker behind him knocking coconuts together (just like in a Monty Python movie) - the overall child dedication service where:   * one of the parents was reciting a passage she had memorized but forgot the last half.. she gave the mike to her husband, who said, "She did really well in bed last night..."  of course, the whole room was laughing hysterically.  he came back and said, "hey people, this is church, get your minds out of the gutter.."      I looked at PM back in the sound booth, he was cracking UP * another dad choked back tears talking about his kids * another dad up front, with his mother and mother in law, dedicating his daughter, who was 6 months old.  his wife had passed away in april.  at the end of his time, he read a letter his wife had written their daughter.  not many dry eyes after that. * the reading that we do at Grace during child dedication services, about our commitment to these families as His Body. - hearing PM speak about Jesus and his interactions with kids - from Mat 18 It was one of those mornings in church where you feel so blessed to be among this group of people, to be so lucky to get a glimpse into how God is moving in people and families and friends, to feel so fortunate that God has given us a spirit of joy and laughter, among the sad and the hurting.  Like I said, it's a poor narrative about what really went on that morning but hopefully you get the idea. I left with the thought in my head, "Man, this is church."

      Had an opportunity to meet the McNishs tonight at GCC.  They are leaving for Florence, Italy next week and GCC is their sending church.  They were really excited to hear about what we are doing with students, they love youth...  For the past 2 years or so, they were in Charlotte, getting some training.  Awesome to connect, and best of all, they are British!  They will be speaking at 4th service next Sunday and I'm trying to line up some of the student summer teams to help dish out some ice cream.  It would be a great way to connect, have the students hear about Italy and have the McNishs catch a glimpse of SPACE.   urlLink Here  is more about them.

      wow I went to LC this morning to make an appearance to talk about the LC missions trip, just for a sec.  I couldn't believe my eyes.  It was Theme Park Sunday... and the 5th grade kids had shown up just to get a peek for their next year in middle school.  There were tons of kids there... all playing some kinds of games... and then there were these dressed up theme park creatures there... see picture... and then when the program began, there was  total chaos for a few minutes when one of the leaders welcomed the new 5th graders and threw candy at them.  Picture 300 middle schoolers diving off the bleachers to grab handfuls of candy.  I am too old. I think the Theme Park Sunday idea was a carry over of yesterday, when LC went to Six Flags and you couldn't go unless you brought a friend.  That's cool huh?

      Some of the faces from the 2004 SPACE missions... For those of you that have heard me go on and on about it, I hope this helps put some faces to the momentum. Pray for these kids and leaders if you remember.                                          PS - As you can probably tell, these are linked via tripod.com.  I started using it a while ago to host very lightweight images, you get 20M free.  But I've had a really bad time of it... Sometimes my images show up, sometimes not.  In other words, if you have another place where you can host images, use that.  Comment if you've got another good place thats free.  Although, I readily realize that it could be just me... html is my friend.

      Wow.  What an awesome time.  We had three people who had spent some time overseas come and talk... Kind of a round table. B - the Sudan D and M - Egypt and Israel The questions: 1.What was the best thing you did to relate to another culture well? 2.After being immersed in another culture, how should we behave differently as Americans? 3.What was the biggest cultural mistake you made?  How did it happen? 4.What did you love about the new culture that you were in? 5.How did elements of your walk with Christ become known in that other culture?  (ie.  It was not just an American thing.) Some great thoughts that they talked through, and I think the students got a lot to think about regarding culture.  I know they are going to deal with different cultures on these trips, thats the beauty of it... It went on for about 60 minutes, a little bit long for some of the kids.  There were middle schoolers there... (Maybe this middle school weekend I am leading is a mistake... I'm just kidding...) Also going to start to pray with the other team leaders periodically as we get closer to departure. Wow.  I can't believe the 5 meetings are over.  I'm going to miss it.

      Something like this:  * real live missionaries panel talking about culture * ice cream sundaes * team time revisiting the 8 great questions 1.What can I learn about myself? 2.What can I learn about God? 3.What can I learn about community and church? 4.What can I learn about culture and its impact on faith? 5.What can I learn about justice and poverty? 6.What can I learn about discipleship? 7.What can I learn about my lifestyle?  8.What can I learn about my vocation? (Taken from  urlLink  Short Term Missions Workbook )  Wow...  It's been a great set of meetings with these students.  Are we ready?  Are we setting them up to be successful for these trips?  Will they come back with a missional attitude and worldview?  Will they understand more of the world and God's passion for it with and thru them?   I think so... and somehow I think little of it has to do with these meetings...

      Over the past month or so, I've been focusing on meeting some key people just to hang out and talk about ministry.  To hear about them, and listen to them, their dreams and visions.  And of course, they want to hear about SPACE and my dreams and visions.  It's been a great interchange. Yesterday, I had lunch with our middle school pastor.  He is new, only having been here for a few months.  However, he was an intern here earlier and his wife grew up at GCC.  Very cool.  Great guy.  He LOVES middle schoolers.   We had some great conversation, including shooting around the following ideas:  God always seems to call people to bigger ministries.  Do you ever hear of someone answering a call to the 'little church'? Hearing/listening for God's voice and direction Can you impart a lifestyle of service to middle school kids or are they inherently only about being served?  Are we too intentional about making ministry to them all about them and for them?  Would love to hear what you readers think about any of those.

      I don't know how much time you spend in actual hanging out with your students, aside from Sunday church, maybe a weekly small group, or a formal youth min activity.  I find that I, unfortunately, hardly spend any time at all just being with them.  I would love to more, but with the rigors of a full time job, two young children at home, and all of that, I don't really get too much time.  It does happen every once in a while, but it has to be intentional and it has to be scheduled in advance.  It's kind of too bad it has to be so structured, I love to just drive and pop in for visits... But it's important to realize that I'm not just making plans for myself, I've got 3 other people in the house to consider.  Sometimes, I'll have kids drop by the house around the girlies bedtime, which is always fun for everyone.  It's a big treat for them when someone comes over and reads a story or prays with them before bed. In lieu of hang time, I find that IM can create a presence to connect with students.  We used to use AIM quite a bit at work, now we have a corporate messaging platform.  And since most of my job is leading, delegating, empowering my team, it's mostly done from a desk, either writing email, chatting over IM or talking on a conference call.  IM is just so practical.   So I find that around 2-2.30, the buddy list just lights up.  Of course, I don't have any milk and cookies when they get home from school, but I think some of the kids I have connected with know that I'm mostly around and can chat if they feel like it.  I also don't try to overburden kids, like talking to them every time they come on.  That would be a little weird.  But of course, I make an effort and I think they do too.  It's neat.  Someone asked me once if I thought it was just a medium for gossip.  I don't really think so, anymore than the phone is.  They also mentioned that a kid that just moved here didn't really connect because they kept chatting with their old friends from where they moved from.  I could see that.  In fact, I told my graduating kids that that when they get to college, they should not log on for the first 2 weeks.  The beginning of college should be about roaming from dorm to dorm, meeting people, not sitting at a computer. Also, I use a thing called GAIM, which lets you run msn, yahoo and aim from the same window manager.  It's very cool.  The other thing that I love about it is that it automatically logs every conversation.  Not because I am a weirdo.  But I think it's fun to go back and read those significant conversations sometimes. Anyway, I thought I would share some of the different things that I have chatted with kids about, things that I think are pretty significant:  missions (of course) the will of God dating careers, the future, etc. planning a surprise party starting with a new campus ministry or not working on a resume checking grammar on a paper dealing with addiction helping a friend with is suicidal good versus bad worship family issues   So all in all, I'm a big fam of IM.  Some of the students think that all I do is chat with people all day long.  In reality, I do a lot of chatting with people all day long.  It's just that most of it is work, some of it isn't.  After all, I AM an extrovert...

       New Template and Comments  Well that wasn't too hard.  I think I have all the pieces up and working like they used to, just with this new template.  I dig it.  Although, I'm not too happy about the way the Haloscan comments look on this page.  Should I switch to blogger built in commenting?  Anyone have a preference?  Or even care?  Ha.

       Unchurched  I don't think I get enough opportunity to sit down and talk with people that have no interest in 'religion' and talk about the deep issues of life.  Recently, we got invited to our neighbors house for a Bible study.  And we didn't even know they went to church.  Apparently, they just got involved in a church a few months ago and the church decided to do the 40 days of purpose.  So our neighbors, C and L, decided to host a Bible study on the Purpose Driven Life.  Yeah, you are right, that is kind of cool.  D has been going almost every week, I just already had too many commitments and such.  Anyway, this past weekend, we were both able to go, and it was really fun.  Not only fun, it was very intriguing and healthy to sit and mostly listen to what people outside the Church think about deep, significant issues of life.  It's also been great to get to know C and L a little better instead of just talking about lawn feed and stuff like that. Last week's study was on mission, ministry and service.  As we talked, I jotted down some snippets which I found interesting.  Interesting because I think they are symbolic of what people think about the church in general.  I hope you find them interesting too:  - 'the church is fashion show' - 'who are the unbelievers?'  (also - I think the group we were with doesn't quite understand the Gospel yet, they still believe God chooses people based upon how good they are.  Of course, I wanted to pipe up, but thought it was better to just listen.) - 'that doesn't sound very Christian.'   - 'we need some kind of religious education for our son.'  (really... very intruiging.) - 'how do I decide how to serve, I might not want to make a long term commitment, or something better might show up.'  Overall, I was trying to take the advice that sometimes, we as Christ followers just talk to much.  Do you sometimes feel, that when you only listen, you missed the boat?

       NYT articles about adolescents  Two very good articles I just read regarding adolescents. Both from NYT.  You might need to get free registration. Both links From  urlLink Thunderstruck   First: For some reason, I've been fascinated with Las Vegas for the past few years.  It's weird.  I think it all started when I decided to take my Dteam guys, right after graduation, to work with YWAM Las Vegas.  They have a thing called Lost World Cafe, where they minister to street people, down and out gamblers, etc.  I thought it would be really really cool.  In reality, guys that just graduated from high school were more interested in spending their summers saving money for college.  It's understandable, and an interesting issue to note when planning student missions.   urlLink Kids in Las Vegas   The second article:  talks about friends with benefits.  I had never understood this phrase, and even still don't.  But  urlLink this  article really opens the door on how easily our teenagers talk about sex these days.. and more....  Read it for yourself.

       short-term "mission trip" worry parents  Someone found this by googling: 'short-term "mission trip" worry parents' I thought that was pretty interesting. So I thought I would share a little bit about my perspective about parents worrying when their kids go on mission trips. There is certainly enough to be worried about, outside of sending your kid to a foreign country or to the inner city.  You can't be with your child at all times, knowing what they are doing, the people they are meeting, how their leaders are protecting and guiding them.  And in a post 9-11 world, the circumstances, especially overseas, can escalate within a moments notice.  One other thing about the post 9-11 world - it is a violent world, and we better get used to it.  We will no longer be able to travel the world as citizens of America and be so well greeted.  It's a tough edict of the new world, but one that we just will have to deal with.  And as one who believes we need to build Christ-followers that have a correct worldview, violence based on what you believe is a real part of the world outside of America.  We have no idea what persecution for our faith really is.  Jesus came to draw people to Himself, out of false idols and religions, and the violence that our world has come to is part of that equation.     So, yes, lots to worry about. On the other hand, I have met a handful of families that would, as one way to put it, love to sign one permission form for their childen's whole high school careers.  Worry is not part of their worldview.  Their child's safety certainly is important, but its not even close to dominating their decisions about their children.  It's quite intruiging, especially since I am certainly not on this side of the scale.  Why are they like that?  How can I be more so?  I think some of it comes to an issue of faith.  They probably have more faith than I have.  But I think it's more than just the idea that God will take care of their children.  Because, in the end, that's a pretty shallow theology.  I think, and I might be wrong, that it's more the idea that God has placed our family on mission and whatever comes will come.  It is a sense of an overriding direction and purpose, driving not only the kids, but the parents as well.  So the mission trip is, in a sense, the opportunity when the child is released into the world, from the family, to fulfill their passion and destiny.  One other component with these families, I think they have prepared their kids so well, worrying about their decision making, the activities they will be doing while unsupervised, the character that has been ingrained in these kids, their levels of responsibility, all of these seem to be a   nonissue too.  I think it becomes not so much as what could happen to my kid as what a great opportunity for growth and purpose and he/she is ready for it. It reminds me of this: "When we believe that God’s purpose, intention or promise is that we will be safe from harm, we are utterly disconnected from the movement and power of God." - McManus I hope this helps the person that googled that phrase.

      Well I'm officially on vacation.  We had the girlies spend the night at Grannys tonight (for the first time ever) and then we went out to dinner and to a movie.  Bourne.  Nice.  Except it kind of made me motion sick.  Tomorrow is our 10th year wedding anniversary.  We are old farts. NYC this sunday, family vacation the next week.  Not much updating until I get back.

      I got the rough schedule for NYC yesterday.  Up until then, I had not gotten anything in writing.  I was almost planning out our own trip... so to get that document was a big relief. Here are some of the ministry activities we are going to do: - Prayer walk & Hand out invitations & Fliers, & New Testaments in Brooklyn - Kids Program With Muslim Children - ESL  Class & Fellowship with West African Muslims in Brooklyn - Store to store & Coffee Shop Ministry with Arabs in Astoria, Queens - ESL  Class & Sports w/Afghan/Pakistani Muslims in Flushing, Queens Wow.  I can't quite believe it.... this is going to be some very very cool stuff. The kids are very very excited and one of their biggest hopes is that they will have meaningful conversations.  I'm interested in seeing God do something that is on the verge of miraculous.

      Wow... The final missions trip for me for the summer... NYC in 4 days - on Sunday.  Got the rough schedule today, looks really good.  Lots and lots of ministry opportunities, all with ethnic groups from the 10/40 window.  Very cool. Had a final team meeting tonight to go over the details. The very last thing this summer is a big missions party on 8/21. Whew.  I'm tired already... Lots of good opportunities this summer so far and I'm sure NYC will have plenty more.

      Wow, what a great trip.  Went really well.  Very fun.  Great group of kids and awesome group of leaders!!. We went to  urlLink CMTS  to help out with whatever they needed - detailing cars, mowing lawns, etc.  It was really fun, the kids worked hard, and they loved hearing from the director, Andy. Here are my notes from conversations with Andy, it was cool to bump up along someone who lives such a life of faith and sees God provide so readily. ===  the kids fell in love with him  crazy stories about God providing and walking in faith property obtained for $175K  downflow paint module - $50K new, got it for $400  God speaks audibly, the clearer the voice the harder the task  We circumvent God doing miracles We don't let God work that way in America  Story - Peru driving in mud road Nancy asks is something wrong with the car He gets out to look One wheel has totally fallen off It's 300 feet behind them Totally destroyed In the middle of nowhere, nobody is going to come around They pray A land rover shows up The guy asks if they need help You could take me up to the river, so I can go across on a ferry and get a repalacement wheel The guy takes him, waits for him, brings him back, helps him put the new wheel on his truck Then he hands him his business card, goes back the way he came from His name was "Angel Mendez" and he supposedly worked at a local bank. Andy never did check at the bank...  ===  Here is the followup thank you letter for the people that prayed for us.  ===  Dear friends,  Thank you so much for praying for the middle school missions trip. I believe we accomplished our primary goal - to blow away the image of a stereotypical missionary. We went to Christian Missions Technical Services in Bernville, PA to serve Andy and Nancy Merrick for a weekend.  The Merricks were missionary mechanics with Wycliffe Bible Translators and on the field, got a vision for bringing that kind of technical service back to the States to serve missionaries on the field.  They have been in operations now for 21 years and their primary tasks include servicing vehicles and machinery for missionaries both state side and overseas.  They also allow missionaries to use their property on furlough and travels, and obtain and send specialized equipment to the mission field. Our time there included cleaning and detailing some of their fleet of vehicles, basic lawn maintenance and odd jobs on their property.  We also spent time listening to some of Andy's amazing stories of how God speaks, how God provides and how God enables. Our students fell in love with the Merricks and they were captivated by how far reaching the CMTS impact is, and how they were able to be a part of that for a short weekend, accomplishing our original goal. So, thank you for faithfully praying for this trip.  Your partnership in the sending and enabling of these students was vital.

       urlLink Greenbelt   is a large Christian festival in the UK, probably something like Creation.... I was poking around on the website today, it looks like a great time. I was looking at the speakers and looking at their segments for youth.  Very intruging.   Read  urlLink this  guys background.  Wow. And read  urlLink this  about what they believe about youth.  Can you say resonate?

      I will be gone tomorrow until Sunday with my second missions trip of the summer.  Thats an intersting statement.  Does that mean that the rest of my summer is spent 'not on mission?'  It reminds me of what they said at Origins, that using the word 'missions' can compartmentalize the idea of every Christ follower being called to mission.  Anyway, that's where I will be. My goals: - band these kids together with this common experience - expand their perspective with what a missionary is - call them to a life of mission and impact  What I've got in mind besides the work projects: - blind volleyball - two adult leaders talking about service and unpacking it from inside/outside (holiness, obedience, service, engaging relationships) - swimming - mini golf - a fun, spy type, strategy game that I'm going to make up on the drive up.   Along these same lines, one of the students said to me that they didn't get surprised when I made up plans spur of the moment.  Haha I thought that was funny.  Cemetaries are the most organized place on the earth, because they are dead.  Haha.  Special thanks to  urlLink Leslie  who wrote the devotional guide.  Good stuff. (Also the first time that I have linked to a student blog.  Leslie you are now famous)  Also, this blog will probably hit the 1000 visitor sometime today or tomorrow.  That will be fun.  If you know its you, drop me an email and I'll send you a funny digital gift.  or something.

      In case you didn't know... Im an addict to  urlLink Patagonia  gear.  It started in college when I worked at a fairly large outdoor  urlLink shop .  Anyway, I just got the new catalog in the mail, when I saw  urlLink this ... I can imagine that is a pretty cool jacket, I have the Retro X jacket, which they don't make anymore, but is just like the new one except without a hood.  It's the black one every calls my yak fur.  It's so warm and its windproof too.  The first day I got it, I drove with the windows down in 20 degree weather. It's hard, if not impossibly materalistic, to rationalize $185 on a jacket.  I got my Retro X on sale.  A constant battle of mine is to stay focused on lifestyle choices that are consistent with what I believe about our mission here and how God wants us to steward our resources.

      Been thinking about this whole signs and wonders issue.... I got to thinking this weekend a bit about it in the context of work... Where we work with computer systems mostly, and how this whole signs and wonders issue would translate to technology.  Jesus healed people, raised people from the dead, and all kinds of stuff like that.  Could it be possible that there is also a realm between Heaven and Hell that exists in technology?  Can this idea of the excluded middle also deal not only with where the physical and spiritual meet, but also in the context of technology issues, ie. computer systems, high tech devices, stuff like that?  I think it can... I posted earlier this year about how everything I did at work was being sabotaged and how it was a spiritual attack.  We had computer programs that had been tested multiple times fail when it was their most important run, root causes that could never be determined, all to thwart the efforts of what I was doing both at work and outside of work.  If the realm of the physical, with flesh and blood, can be an intersection where the spiritual works, I think the same can be true of the domain of bits and bytes, disk drives, physical computer memory...  Yesterday, I must have prayed for our release 5 or 6 times throughout the day before it started...

      Worked a release last night - 10pm to 6am. It actually ran pretty smooth for the most part, it's nice to see things go well for a change. And I felt like I really had the time to make sure the prep was done the right way.  I slept until 1pm today, and have spent the rest of the day laying around the couch. Specifically, it has consisted of pieces of:  - Die Hard  - The Real World  - Bugjuice Marathon (I'm really digging this show for all the lessons on group dynamics, etc.)  - Lethal Weapon 3  - Overhaul  - I Love the 90s  - The CMT awards  - City Slickers  Wow, there is a lot of quality tv on Sundays.  (That would be a sarcastic opinion.)

      Afew quotes from "Waking the Dead" by Eldredge: - "Remember, when Jesus boiled his whole mission down to healing the brokenhearted and setting prisoners free from darkness, he was referring to all of us.&nbsp; Our modern, scientific, Enlightenment worldview has simply removed spiritual warfare as a practical category, and so it shouldn’t surprise us that we can’t see spiritual strongholds after we say they don’t really exist." - "Satan is called in Scripture the Father of Lies (John 8:44).&nbsp; His very first attack against the human race was to lie to Eve and Adam about God, and where life is to be found, and what the consequences of certain actions would and would not be.&nbsp; He is a master at this.&nbsp; He suggests to us – as he suggested to Adam and Eve- some sort of idea or inclination or impression, and what he is seeking is a sort of ‘agreement’ on our part.&nbsp; He’s hoping we will buy into whatever he is saying, offering, insinuating.&nbsp;" - "During an assault like this, you must remember:&nbsp; make no agreements.&nbsp; The Enemy will suggest all sorts of things.&nbsp; “God doesn’t care.&nbsp; You’re not worth fighting for.&nbsp; Your heart doesn’t matter.&nbsp; You can’t trust him.”&nbsp; He is trying to kill your heart, destroy the glory of your life.&nbsp; It will feel hard – really hard, almost impossible – but whatever you do, make no agreements.&nbsp; You have to start there." I have felt this all week for some reason.&nbsp; I'm not sure what it boils down to.&nbsp; It has come from all angles - my role as a father and husband, my abilities at my job, the things I am doing with students...&nbsp; I'm not sure why with regard to the timing. I don't even really know why I decided to look up my notes from Eldredge's book again... but I'm really glad I did. John 10:10 - life to the full - your are God's delight

      Ok, ignore my two previous posts. So for the past 6 months, I have been consumed by preparing mission teams.&nbsp; Well, that time has drawn to a close.&nbsp; Significant phases of mission trips are: - preparation - execution - debriefing and re-entry I'm thankful that the preparation time is over.&nbsp; Frankly, I was done talking about it all, having people visualize it, getting people excited.&nbsp; Last week was the final LC missions prep meeting.&nbsp; Of course, there were other issues related to that, which is a tangent.&nbsp;  So a week from yesterday, the LC trip for 3 days.&nbsp; Back for 5 days and then the NYC trip, and then back for 2 days, then to see the DC trip off and then on family vacation. I have to admit, I'm looking forward to the family vacation more than anything right now, but that's just because it's been a long, quiet week.&nbsp;  We are doing foundational stuff this year.&nbsp; The LC trip is totally going to change the perspective of these students, they will see missions in a whole new light.&nbsp; NYC will open eyes and ears.&nbsp; I want to see those students see the nations differently, and I want to see them hear tongues they have never heard before, and enjoy that sensation, to realize that God understands all these languages, and relishes lives that worship Him in these tongues. SEMP starts tomorrow without us.&nbsp; Drag.&nbsp; We missed a big foundational piece this summer.&nbsp; Rather unfortunate.&nbsp; I was contemplating taking a drive up there to say hello. &nbsp;

      Of course, there were a billion things that I could have spent my time  wisely on this week.  Not many of them made it to the list.   The fam has been gone all this week, and won't be back for another few  days.  Real meaning - the house is really boring.   So instead of doing great things, I did little meaningless things.  Real meaning - I spent more time at work.   I guess I could have done a bunch of stuff for the middle school  trip.  I'm starting to have some second thoughts about that, but  its too late now.  And I think I have an atmosphere I have to  cultivate from the very beginning about that... But thats kind of a  tangent.  Real meaning - I should have just stuck to leading  mission trips for high schoolers.   Here are some other things I did this week, to give you a sample of those meaningless things:   - painted most of the trim in the kitchen.  (just a few minutes ago) - worked from 11-1am last night, building a database of 4 tables to  load some data from a system that decided to go to production without  telling us of their need for this data to get loaded in our  system.  (see what I mean) - played pool on yahoo games with my friend M^3.  (actually that  wasn't meaningless, that was really fun.  And his initials are MM,  but I like calling him M^3.  i like calling him that in this blog  anyway.) - mowed and trimmed the lawn - sprayed weed killer on the lawn.  chickweed, its a tragic disease. - watched Spiderman 1 on DVD. - watched SWAT on DVD.  I liked it, it was filmed in LA. - went thru all my old mission trip files so that I could relive those glory days.  uh, right.   - i will probably go buy snacks for the middle school trip tomorrow.   - i will probably finishing doing some more painting tomorrow.   - i will probably work a 12 hour marathon release tomorrow night,  starting at 10pm.  isn't there something more to a career than  this?   - i will probably take a nap tomorrow.      Real meaning - I'm really ready for my wife and kids to come home.   Wow, this was seriously pointless.  I'm proud, I think its a whole new level.

Sometimes I wish it was easier to : - not give any money away so I could buy a sports car - be able to use all of my vacation time for a really long family vacation - buy really expensive and nice things and not feel a twinge of something in my soul - care about my career like other people - have normal hobbies like maybe golf or tennis (well maybe those aren't normal... or maybe they are) - care only about my children and not the rest of the younger generation - not think about how to provide experiences where my kids meet Jesus Am I that weird?

      I never really have gotten all of my thoughts together on the DR experience after taking  urlLink Perspectives ...so I thought I would do that here now. In 1994, I led a team of students on a 3 week long missions trip to the Dominican Republic.  I had one coleader and five high school students.  Our task was to work with kids in an orphanage in the mountain town of Jarabacoa in central DR.  While we were there, I got really sick (see previous post).  It was a great experience, it was my first time in the third world, yet, I think there were so many things that could have made it even better. - We were not immersed in the culture. We lived in the 'compound' of  urlLink ANIJA .  (From the website, the place has really changed in the last 11 years)  Instead of really living in the culture, we segregated ourselves by living with our own team, in isolation from people we were ministering to.   At the time, there was one other staff member who lived there too and she would go out to the nightclubs every night when we were there.  At a minimum, we should have gone with her.  A big regret. - Culture shock paralyzed our team.   I can remember our first two days there.  Being surprised at the idea of not being able to flush toilet paper, having the electricity shut down for about an hour every day at any time, having to be very careful about drinking the water (and I still got sick).  The culture shock got to us.  I specifically found myself incredibly tired and disengaged for at least the first two days.  It was not an ideal start.  From those two days, we created the precedent, for the next three weeks, that evenings were just spent lounging around our compound, instead of being in the town, trying to meet people, build some relationships, learn the culture. - We didn't focus on setting the national leadership up for anything.   Our team didn't have any kind of focus on sustaining ministry or leadership from the community that lived there.  Short sighted, yes.  But of course, that was in 1993, I was young, etc.  Still, having that kind of focus could have made a difference in how intentional we were on the trip. So... after 11 years of introspection... Still, it was a valuable trip in the experience, seeing how we are blessed to bless others, seeing what its like to live in another part of the world where no one has phones, toilets are different and they speak a different language.

      AAAhhhh....  I was digging through some old boxes looking for something from an old friend... and I found this....  It's a prescription from 1993 when I spent 3 weeks in the Dominican Republic... and got really sick.  I had classic 'infectious diarrhea'.  Yup, it was as bad as it sounds.

      It really was a huge privilege for me to be involved with both the middle and high school services yesterday, doing the sendoff for the mission teams.  HUGE.  I only really do announcements and various stuff like that during the services, so to be able to do a little speaking during the high school service was an awesome honor. For middle school, the sendoff was a little confused, but our middle school pastor just rolled with it, it was cool. For high school, it worked out just like I had in mind.  I got the idea from Origins, when we all prayed for the church planters that were there.  We had the students going kneel in front, their friends could come up behind them and lay hands on them, and adult leaders (Dteam, program, staff, etc) would pray for one person individually, out loud at the same time.  When everyone was done, Scott closed the whole sendoff in prayer, which was a really passionate prayer. It was important to me to communicate the idea of mission versus missions.  I wanted to make sure that everyone knew that it wasn't just about a group of kids going somewhere, rather it was about each person knowing that God wants them involved in the overall mission.  If mission trips and the idea of mission is an important value in our community, if we encourage and challenge students to step out a bit, to feel the pulse in their world by going into it intentionally for the Kingdom, we have to celebrate these opportunities, demonstrate that the Body is behind them, be excited with them as they go forth. As I wrote before, I was pretty nervous about the speaking part.  It didn't help that all these people showed up - my friend K was there, a few girls from the 03 class, and practically every person that Scott has on the teaching team.  Talk about an audience.

      This morning was great.  In LC, we did a little missions sendoff for the team.  And then in CpR, I did a 15 minute talk on mission, blessed to bless others and feeling a pulse for the world.  I was really nervous, but it was totally worth it. The coolest thing from the morning was hearing the worship set the band picked out when the talk was over.  The words of the music fit the message so well.  Nothing supernaturally crazy, but I know that the morning was divine. My notes from this morning - very scattered... ============  intro priviledge space - service and missions this am - missions send off a few minutes to share  missions vs. mission  we don't think enough about us having a mission in the world God has a heart for mission He deisres to be worshipped, with peoples whole lives  Every story, every circumstance, every principle in Scripture illustrates God's heart on a mission That mission is so that people everywhere will seek to worship Him reading the Bible from that point of view might be a lot different  story - glenn food fight he was a man on a mission in the same way, God has hearts of people in target He desires worship from everyone  I want us to think about God's mission this morning in two terms:  slide  Genesis 12 /slide  1 - Gen 12 You are blessed to be a blessing to others Period It's not about you Your family Your time in history Your place in this world Spiritual leaders, mentors, CpR specifically If nothing else, I know that your place in this church has enabled you to do much for you have been given much I want you to see that its not neccessarily about you  It's easy to disengage when we believe that its all about us  you don't have to go somewhere to do this taking the time to listen showing up early to help out with something going on here taking an interst with someone at school deciding you are going to do somehting radical for God's kingdom   2 - the world is waiting heart for the nations, for the world there is much more at stake than just us - 6.2B people in the world - estimated 25% are unreached - never could hear about jesus if they wanted to - 25M infected with AIDS in subsaharan Africa - 1 missionary among 1M muslims - Sudan - i could go on and on about the world's stories it's hard to be a global jesus follower you have to care about the world, both around you and at large  story - katie - boot camp im not into torture 160 bug bites to see your child suffer is a very very difficult thing best thing - Zambia - Cindy - 500 AIDS orphans in a 5 mile radius if giving her that experience gives her a heart for the world but i would do it if she can learn to see the world through Jesus eyes if she or you could get a sense of how God longs for disciples, how discples win the world, not converts, how we need to be concerned for the world, i would put you or her through it again its not easy, its hard work NYC - be forewarned i wouldn't mind making you suffer like that too  this idea of full engagement we are in a passionate movement, scraming down the road not worried about how we are going to stop fully engaged towards God's mission

      Lots of info this week about the AIDS crisis in Africa and potentially India.  The 15th International AIDS conference is coming up next week.  Here is a snippet I never heard of before, which I thought was quite interesting:  Brazil is considered the leading success story in the developing world's battle against HIV. Brazil offered comprehensive HIV prevention plans from the start of the epidemic and, ignoring the protests of patented AIDS drugmakers, began distributing copied versions to HIV-infected patients in 1996. In Brazil's own analysis, the payoff has been: 90,000 deaths averted; a sevenfold reduction in AIDS hospitalizations; and savings of $2.2 billion.  The whole article, which is about the potential of India to turn into an Africa, is  urlLink here .   UPDATED: A  urlLink link  about World Relief at the AIDS conference.

      From the Friday Fax, relevant to the whole Power Evangelism discussion:  India: amputation unnecessary, healed of cancer "Two of our full-time evangelists were looking for accommodation for the night," reports German missions agency "Stimme der Zigeuner" (Voice of the Gypsies). "When they eventually found a place to stay in Khamman, Andra Pradesh State, the house owner refused to let them in because they were Christians. The housewife bravely decided to let them in. The unfriendly owner, a rich landowner, suffered from diabetes, and had open wounds on his feet. His doctors had prescribed various medicines to prepare him for an amputation the following week. His wife asked her guests for prayer for herself and her husband; the evangelists told her that she too should pray to God. The healing was rapid; the surprised doctors cancelled the amputation, because the man was completely healthy. When his wife told of her husband's healing in the nearby store, the store owner, who suffered from cancer, also started praying to God. She was healed too. The thankful landowner donated land, on which a church building was opened in April 2004." Source: Stimme der Zigeuner

      Neat idea  urlLink here .  Hope for NY, the mercy arm of Redeemer Pres Church.  One of the fundamental issues in mission is the whole idea partnering with indigenous ministries already doing the right stuff in the right places.  Who do you choose, whats the critiera, etc.  Interesting to think about.

      Reading this Power Evangelism book has made me think a bit.  In a good way.  Mostly I'm just contemplating how come if it really is a valid deal, why I haven't really seen something like that before.  Is it because I've got a worldview that says those kinds of things don't happen?  Maybe I've got a closed mind?  Maybe I haven't really looked for it,  or had an open heart to God really speaking to me, in a tangible, audible way?  I don't exactly walk around with having this concept of 'Divine Appointments' in my head... In the summer of 2001 I took a team of high school guys to do some conversational evangelism on the boardwalk of Ocean City, MD.  We went for 3 days and the only task we were there for was to talk to people on the boardwalk about spirituality.  We had a rough survey put together, which I got from SEMP, and bascially asked people if they might be interested in answering some questions about religion and spirituality.  Most people were pretty receptive.  There is something about the boardwalk at the beach at night, a kind of charge in the air, all the more when you might be engaging people about eternal things.  For the whole time we were there, the guys were ok to go off on their own, as long as they were in either pairs or groups of three.  One evening, two of our guys started talking to an older gentleman, sitting on a bench.  He seemed pretty interested in what they were saying, until his wife came out of the store he was sitting in front of.  They could not have been opposite.  He was very engaging, talkative, open to hearing and listening.  She was aggresive, dogmatic, not wanting to listen, dialogue or even share her name.  She had a different spirit about her.  Eventually, she looked at one of my guys and asked, "Your birthday is in May isn't it?"  E and T booked it out of there as fast as they could.  They were, understandbly, spooked. I think about it now and wonder if that was a situation that was what Wimber would call a power encounter, meaning that there was 'a force that must be overcome for the Gospel to be believed.'  I kind of am thinking that there was, but we didn't know how to deal with it, so instead, did the natural and easiest thing, ie. leaving the situation.  As I ponder it now, its a kind of scary proposition - to take high school students and potentially expose them to something of that sort.  It is sooooo out of our American worldview.  Of course, the opposite extreme of having to deal with something almost out of a movie is that we have the potential to expose our students to having a transforming encounter with Jesus.  Yup, its worth it. If you are taking a group on summer missions this summer, think about this idea of a power encounter.  Would love to hear from people about it.

      My good friend MM lent me this book when we were in FL.    urlLink    Probably 18 months ago, I would have been a huge skeptic of most of what was in there.  But I don't really think I am anymore.  Call me crazy...  If you've read it, or heard of it, would love to hear your thoughts.   A few of my notes:   Any system or force that must be overcome for the gospel to be believed is cause for a power encounter.   ‘A power encounter is a visible practical demonstration that Jesus Christ is more powerful than the false gods or spirits worshipped or feared by a people group’ – C. Peter Wagner   By power evangelism I mean a presentation of the gospel that is rational but also transcends the rational.  The explanation of the gospel – the clear proclamation of the finished work of Christ on the cross – comes with a demonstration of God’s power through signs and wonders. The Bible does not teach that evangelism apart from signs and wonders somehow changes the gospel message.  The heart and soul of evangelism is the proclamation of the Gospel. Many of us are suspicious of a story in which supernatural knowledge of personal sin is used in evangelism.  This demonstrates how far Christianity in Western society has drifted from experiences that occurred in New Testament times.     I guess the gist for me is that I'm not longer suspicious when I hear a story like that.   And boy, this book is full of stories.  It's scary because when someone's worldview changes, look out.  It's like McManus says, "The Bible - it can really mess your stuff up."

      We had a great 4th.  Spent lots of time with family and watched the fireworks on the beach.  It was really cool. The girlies loved it, and it was Em's first fireworks.  I think she is hooked.

      Happy 4th weekend to you all.  I'm in CT at the Madres house for the weekend.  Probably not much posting.  Enjoy those fireworks and remember that Jesus worked for the ultimate independence from sin, so that we could live in full and liberating dependence upon Him.  It's a funny thing isn't it?

      Missiologists use the term 'indigenous' a lot.  Meaning that missions should not destroy the culture, but try to provide spiritual leadership, at some point, from within the culture.  I think the same thing applies to youth culture.  Most of you probably sense it quite often - students need to own the ministry.  You can (fill in the blank here - lead a talk, invite some kids, run a small group, etc.) and you will draw X number of kids.  Have a student help you or own it, and they will draw X*X number of kids.  Someone told me that the Univ of MD has the most Chinese foreign students in the US.  Their point was that if a person had a heart for Chinese, they should do ministry to the students at U of MD, for one student there could reach multitudes more Chinese than they ever could. It's one paradigm thats important with SPACE.  Here are two quick things I'm doing: - asked one Senior to write some devotionals for a middle school trip. - hoping a Junior will come on the middle school and do worship for me. I think both of these ideas have the indigenous concept as well as having older kids involved with the vision reach out with projects to the younger kids, forming more of that momentum.

         I read this book prob a year ago... skimming it again, in reference to career... Here are some notes that I found relevant to me...   Chapter 4 – Doctor or Lawyer    Understanding our parents  First – attempt to understand where our coming from in their perspective on our career choices. Among Asian parents, providing well and having one’s physical needs met in an ample and dignified way is of utmost importance. Second – we struggle to communicate well with our parents because they may not share some of the values that may be assumed by this current more Americanized generation. We often speak in different languages from what our parents speak. A friend of mine remembers telling her mother during college that she wanted to do something after college that ‘would help her get in touch with who she really was.’  Her mother, however, who had not been influenced by such a psychological oriented, individualistic culture, had no concept or value for self-expression or psychological self-understanding.  “I know who you are, you are my daughter.  Study hard and get a good job.” When a culture based on Confucian philosophy encounters a culture that has been deeply influenced by humanistic psychology, much confusion can result. Our parents love us very much, but their conceptions of what ultimately will make us happy differ from our own ideas. Third – it is wise to keep in mind that our parents may hope to see some of their aspirations and desires come true though the lives of their children.  In the Asian mentality this is not as evil and manipulative thing to do as it is in the mainstream American, individualistic society, where one’s personal choice is the most important thing.   God is our Guide  1.	you have to begin by telling God what you want.  He will work with this. 2.	Don’t just talk at him, listen. 3.	seek confirmation of your sense of God’s leading through godly people whom you trust.   Vocation and Work in God’s Kingdom  Vocation – calling Less to do with what we do from day to day to earn an living and more to do with our primary purpose for living – what God has created and called us to be.   Practical Suggestions  1.	Trust that God is the One who has the best plan for your life. 2.	Listen to your parents. Are you able to articulate what their true concerns for you are?  Can you talk to them about your future in the presence of a trusted friend and then hear your friend’s perspective about what they seem to be saying and where they are coming from? Practically this means asking your parents well thought out questions in an honoring way that they can respond to. 3.	Don’t use the Bible as a weapon. Waging theological battles, especially when the issues are primarily cultural, are not fruitful. 4.	Take advantage of advocates in talking with your parents. Are there older people in authority whom your parents respect and who could connect with them on your behalf? 5.	Show how you are being responsible in what you are considering. Usually its not that our parents simply hate the alternative job choices, its that they don’t understand them and don’t see how they are going to provide well for our futures.  What are your parents perspectives on the basics in terms of salary, benefits, retirement, and personal growth options?  You should know what they are, so that you can work with this information respectfully and thoughtfully. 6.	Consider a different timeline so that you and your family can be better prepared for the future you are stepping into. Can you take an intentional time of preparation for what may come next? 7.	let yourself dream and get in touch with your real desires and interests.

      A few weeks ago, Katie (my 6 year old) and I gave my parents a set of prayer cards for our trip to Teen Missions.  My mother responded and said, "I will pray for you guys."  Which is funny because my parents have never been religious.  They have supported me in my endeavors with youth work and stuff, for the most part.  Of course, they tell me all the time that I spend too much time doing stuff for the church.  They just aren't interested in spiritual things.  Or so I thought. While we were at Boot Camp, I know K thought about my parents a lot, and what they thought of Jesus.  It was on her mind at least two nights after the evening rallys. Yesterday I was having dinner with them, griping about my job, more than a bit.  My mother said, "I will pray for your job."  Which was a surprise.  Well, come to find out that she has visited this local Chinese church plant, right down the street, that meets in the upstairs of a pretty big local Baptist church.  They do the service all in Chinese and they have Chinese Bibles and all.  There were about 30 people that were there, she has only visited once. I know Katie is going to be incredibly excited to talk to Granny about church and Jesus.  They have already talked a little bit about it, since Katie told me that my parents are preferential to Buddah rather than Jesus.  In other words, she has dialogued with my parents about stuff that I never really had the courage to.  Moreso, my parents seemed to have been willing to talk to her about it, whereas with me, it was a subject they could just dismiss out of hand. That's some pretty wild stuff.  It's got me thinking a few things: - We write people off in their spiritual journeys so easily.  I would have never thought my mother would be at all interested in going to a church.   - That the younger generation does and will and will continue to make more of an impact than we ever will.  Youth has an energy, a drive, a power, that those of us in our 30s and older do not have.  Us older people still have some of that, but life experience has changed us a bit.  We now have a medium that is conducive to mentoring, guiding, etc. - God has granted us enormous power and impact when we minister as families.  I saw it with my Dteam, and continue to see it as we lead SPACE... students love little kids, they love to see families.  Our kids speak about what kind of Jesus followers we are. - Older people are still searching, even when we may not think so.  My good friend's mother make Jesus her Lord when she was 70.
