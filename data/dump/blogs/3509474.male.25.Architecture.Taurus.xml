      Tonight I am going to watch the second half of  urlLink Pride and Prejudice . It is based on the book by  urlLink Jane Austen , which I recently completed reading. I have been on this kick the last couple of years of trying to catch up on all of the classics I didn't read in  urlLink High School  (I get most of the books for very cheap at the  urlLink Public Library's   urlLink Book Sales , or at estate sales). Unlike  urlLink The Grapes of Wrath , seeing this movie after reading the book is far from a disappointment. The actors they chose are absolutely perfect, and the dialogue is word-for-word from the book. The only downfall is that altogether it is five hours long (much shorter than reading the book, however). By the way, it's a great story.

      Okay, I'm finally trying out this blog thing. I don't really have any particular intentions for this blog, except to ramble (and perhaps inform) about design, web design and the like. I looked around and saw some very impressive blogs all organized into categories and I was pretty intimidated...only to find out blogger.com seems to make all of that pretty easy. I'm glad I decided to just jump into it. I have a tendancy, when I'm learning something new, to try to take in every detail of something before I attempt it. The result is a sort of paralysis. So, since I don't know much about blogging yet, and it seems there is a decent amount to know, I'm just going to barf this out and clean it up later.

      If you haven't already, check out  urlLink Steve Jobs WWDC 2004 Keynote Webcast . In addition to a new  urlLink 30" Cinema Display , Jobs introduces the following new  urlLink Tiger  features:  A  urlLink Longhorn -like search mechanism called  urlLink Spotlight  A new video codec called  urlLink H.264  that can stream high-definition video at today's standard data rate  urlLink Core Image and Core Video  A visual AppleScripter called  urlLink Automator   urlLink Safari RSS  which provides great RSS support and a new "Private Browsing" feature that keeps everything you visit out of your cache...you know, so you can shop for bithday presents online and your family won't be able to see where you've been :) One thing I found interesting about the search mechanism was that they had programmed in things like "wallpaper" to help former Windows users find where to change their "desktop". It would be very useful if they could team up with Google and use  urlLink Latent Semantic Indexing  to find relevant, but not necessarily matching, content on your machine.

      Here is my one card for AIGA Nebraska's  urlLink Design The Hand You're Dealt . It's a somewhat De Stijl inspired five of clubs. It's a simple design derived from a varied scale, in which everything is in proportion to the length of each side divided by the aspect ratio. For example, the cards are 8" by 12", so the aspect ratio is 1:1.5, so the varied scale is 12", 8", 5.33", 3.55", etc.. Each side of all of the elements on this card are one of these lengths, and many of them are the same aspect ratio. There's still alot that's arbitrary about the design, I'm sure, but at least I can pretend there isn't.   P.S. I am obsessed with proportions, ever since reading  urlLink The Elements of Typographic Style.

      Ever been confronted, in Photoshop, with this (totally useless) crop tool icon?   Or been using a large paintbrush, and seen this equally useless icon:   Even though your preferences clearly designate the "brush size" cursor should be used?  In either case, press CAPS LOCK. You will get the latter icon, which is the only good way to crop, if cropping, and you will toggle back to the "brush size" icon if you are using the brush tool (and your brush size is big enough).  It was quite awhile before I discovered this, and I always thought I had a buggy copy of Photoshop in the "brush size" situation. It seems everyone else I've encountered has thought the same, so I hope this helps you.

      Most of the pictures you see on this site will have been taken with my  urlLink Minolta Dimage Xt  (its no longer available new on Amazon, but the  urlLink Minolta Dimage Xg  is, and I struggle to see any difference).   I did a great deal of research to find this camera, because I was sick of seeing photo-ops like I was able to capture in  urlLink CAUTION: Inverted Chairs  and not having a camera handy, or going to social gatherings where having a bulky camera was too inconvenient to hassle with. The camera is smaller than my wallet, lightweight, has a flash, zooms up to 3X and with a  urlLink 256 MB SecureDigital Card , I can take up to 12 minutes of video, with sound, at 320x240 (VHS quality), at 15 frames per second (not VHS quality).  I used this camera to film my  urlLink ski videos  (featuring the music of  urlLink Criteria ), which I edited with  urlLink iMovie , created the graphic animation with  urlLink Flash .  The camera is not free of problems, however. Its battery tends to die very rapidly in the cold of skiing conditions, I once had to send it back to the factory for repair (under warranty) because the sliding door that covers the lens wouldn't operate, and the optics, understandably given the camera's small size, are not stellar. I also had an issue on a ski trip during which every evening I would replay the day's movies on the hotel's television set. After all of that replaying, stopping, rewinding, and slow-mo-ing, some of the quicktime movies became irrevocably corrupted. I now try to avoid replaying my precious videos off of the camera.

      Last night, I saw  urlLink Super Size Me , a documentary in which the director eats nothing but McDonald's three times a day for thirty days. Seeing the movie didn't make me much more anti-McDonald's than I already am, but I have to say watching it was an unpleasant experience. The shaky camera work added to the nauseating effect of watching this guy wolf down big macs and fries. I soon found myself covering my eyes every time he took a bite. I don't think it's a bad thing when a movie makes you feel something other than good, though.

      Last night, I watched  urlLink Swimming Pool  ( urlLink Amazon ), a rather ambiguous movie a la  urlLink Mulholland Drive  ( urlLink Amazon ) or  urlLink 8 1/2  ( urlLink Amazon ). I enjoy such movies because they make wonderful vehicles for discussion. Of the many interesting  urlLink posts  on this movie, I think the interpretation that the Julia we see for most of the movie is  urlLink Sarah's creation  makes the most sense.

      I have added a background pattern and framed the content with my parody of the ever-popular drop shadow. I'm tempted to resist the aqua-esque design trend and stick with pixel-by-pixel designs. I feel that it gives a good understanding to how all of the pixels work together, and while exaggerated, expresses the limitations of this medium.  Whenever I do work, or see work, that acknowledges the limitations of the pixel through  urlLink exaggeration , it reminds me of the  urlLink de Stijl  movement, not only because the forms they derived from the principles of de Stijl are rectilinear, but because, in some cases, the form seems to derive from the limitations of the medium at hand. Granted,  urlLink Mondrian's paintings  are counter-expressive of the inherent qualities of paint in contrast to the work of  urlLink Van Gogh  or  urlLink Jackson Pollack , but seeing a piece such as  urlLink Theo van Doesburg 's logo for de Stijl   Makes me suspect that maybe having a typecase full of only fonts and rectangular rules may have had a strong influence on its final form.

      The  urlLink Firefox Keyboard Shortcuts Table  has (sort of) unlocked for me a way to browse almost entirely on my keyboard. I always loved how  urlLink Firefox  would highlight text links just by typing the first few letters of that link, and I always valued the ability to switch browser tabs on  urlLink Safari  using Cmd+Shift+arrow, but I could never get Firefox to switch tabs.  Funny though, that if you follow this table and press Ctrl+T in Firefox on a mac, it will NOT produce a new tab for you. This, I wouldn't even notice, because I normally just register "Ctrl" to mean "Cmd" on a Mac, since that's how it's keyboard shortcuts usually translate from a PC, so as I would expect, one must press Cmd+T to produce a new tab on a Mac, however, Cmd+Tab does not switch tabs as one who uses this logic would expect. In this case, when they say "Ctrl," they mean "Ctrl." Press Ctrl+Tab and Firefox will switch tabs.  What do I have against using a mouse? Mice are primitive ( urlLink mouse alternatives ), and I find them especially uncomfortable given that I use a computer most of the day. To do the things I can't accomplish on my keyboard, I rely on a  urlLink Wacom Tablet .

      Until this week,  urlLink rdgusa.com , which I am the webmaster of, had been getting alot of annoying  urlLink spambot  traffic from one spambot in particular (for background on our method of determining what a spambot is, read up on the  urlLink mod_rewrite  method). Finally I got fed up with this spambot visiting the site every day,  urlLink looked up the IP address  and contacted the tech contact, simply telling them I was getting spambot behavior from this particular IP address. Later that day, I got an e-mail from the "offending" customer, who was oblivious as to what was going on. Oddly, the "offending" customer was the Catholic Diocese of a capital city (RDG is a leader in  urlLink Catholic Church Architecture , so this was a potential client). I checked the log files, and noticed that the offending IP address had visited once, with human-like behavior, then a few days later started coming as a robot, accessing, but disobeying the  urlLink robots.txt  file at which point I started blocking it. I was fairly certain that this Catholic Diocese wasn't running a spambot, so I concluded that there must have been some sort of Trojan Horse that had taken over one of their computers, going through it's internet history and harvesting e-mail addresses from all of the sites in it. I informed the tech contact of this organization, and sure enough, he found a Trojan Horse on one of his user's computers. I was unaware that spammers used this method, and I thought the world should know about it.

       urlLink Nathan Sharfi  has pointed out that the CSS3 Specifications have a feature called  urlLink psuedo-elements  that will behave just like my proposed use. I suppose what Luke desires is to specify containment of  div s through the style sheet, but to still be able to assign content to the  div s through the markup. That would be handy indeed, and would enable true re-designs through stylesheet changes. I feel a bit foolish for not having been familiar with this feature of the CSS3 spec, but that is how you learn.

      After further consideration, I have noticed that there is a possible issue with "element nesting" as I have described it below. Luke Redpath proposes still including all of the DIV tags in your markup. In my proposed use, there is no indication in the markup of any "wrap1," "wrap2," elements. So it seems that in trying to take presentation out of the markup, perhaps I have inserted markup into the presentation, meaning that the presence of the "wrap1" etc. elements derive from them being indicated in the stylesheet. This is something I'm sure the W3C could figure out. It wouldn't work right out of the box as I've proposed it, but you get the idea.

      I just read an article with a pretty intriguing proposal in it. If I understand it correctly,  urlLink Luke Redpath  proposes that the next CSS specification include an ability to specify that an element contain other elements by default. This would be an ideal way to create visual effects that would otherwise require  urlLink extraneous DIV tags . For example, for the technique,  urlLink Onion Skinned Drop Shadows , the code would look something like this:  .wrap1, .wrap2, .wrap3 {   display:inline-table;   /* \*/display:block;/**/   } .wrap3 {   padding:0 4px 4px 0;   background:url(corner_tr.gif) right   top no-repeat;   } /* CSS rules from the future */ .wrap1 {    contain: .wrap2    float:left;   background:url(shadow.gif) right   bottom no-repeat;   } .wrap2 {    contain: .wrap3    background:url(corner_bl.gif) left   bottom no-repeat;   } img .shadow {    contain: .wrap1  } /* end CSS rules from the future */  Now, instead of your markup looking like this:  &lt;div class=&quot;wrap1&quot;&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;wrap2&quot;&gt;   &lt;div class=&quot;wrap3&quot;&gt;    &lt;img     src=&quot;object.gif&quot;     alt=&quot;The object casting a shadow&quot;    /&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  It would look like this:  &lt;img class=&quot;shadow&quot;   src=&quot;object.gif&quot;   alt=&quot;The object casting a shadow&quot; /&gt;  I think this would be a big step toward separating presentation from content.

      I've finally done it, and it didn't take as long as I had expected. I have created my own template for my blog. Here is a Safari screenshot:    Sure, most of the code is still from the Blogger.com template, but I will tweak it as I go along. I'm quite pleased just to have developed a template that isn't falling apart in the browsers I test it in. I hope to incorporate some visual effects into my template in the future.  As I said, making my own template was easier than I had thought. I just downloaded the source code from my blog, reworked the CSS in it to my liking, took out my styles to make an external stylesheet, and plugged in the tags that apparently tell the Blogger.com engine where to put the content. Then I copied and pasted my source code into my Blogger.com template. Here is a screenshot of some of my code nicely color-coded by GoLive 6:   It still needs alot of work, though.

      ...shouldn't be very tough. After sorting through some of the code in my template, and running a few simple tests, it looks like plugging my blog into a personal/portfolio page should be relatively easy. I aim to do a nice CSS-based layout, and use some PHP to plug in  urlLink includes  and maybe for some other features. Which leaves me with just three issues:   I've never done a completely CSS-based layout.  I've done very little PHP development.  My current  urlLink experimental  site won't accommodate this stuff very well.   So, this should be a fun challenge. Hopefully I can stay committed to accomplishing this. I have a strong desire to master CSS-based layout. From what I can tell so far, doing CSS layout is a  urlLink pain in the rear , but I really believe in the power of CSS.    urlLink Why?  So many of my designer friends ask. Here are a few reasons truly off the top of my head:  -maintain the structure of information HTML's various tags work wonderfully to categorize information or give it a hierarchy. CSS enables you to use these tags while still giving everything the look you desire.  -separate style from content Nothing new to you if you are familiar with CSS. With CSS the information that is in your source code will be just that: information. You won't have a bunch of meaningless table tags strewn about. This also results in a faster load time, because your formatting remains in your style sheet, which is then cached. The browser only needs to download the information.  -forwards compatibility Since the actual HTML markup is so clean, it breaks apart nicely on mobile devices and the like. Re-designs are easier with CSS, too. All you have to do is change out your style sheet, and your site is totally redesigned. Keeping clean markup makes it easier for archivists to save your content so it will outlive you.  -accessibility ...to both humans and machines. Keeping your text as text, and not hidden away in some Flash movie or image file makes your information scalable for sight-impaired users, and readable both by search engines and aural browsers.

      It is bold of me to say (bold because months could go by before I actually get around to it) that I am going to re-design this site. Right now, it is on the beautiful, CSS based, standards compliant, template designed by Douglas ( urlLink Stopdesign ) Bowman. It's a great template, but being a designer, and one that hopes to master  urlLink CSS layout , I shall have to create my own. The thing that worries me at this point, is that I am going to want to include information other than my blog on the site, such as a portfolio of my work, some experimental design, some articles, etc. I imagine that I can probably suck the xml feed into a site design, but at this point, I'm not sure how to do that. I have made some progress in CSS layout techniques, mostly with help from  urlLink A List Apart , and inspiration from the  urlLink CSS Zen Garden , but I'm not sure yet where to find help on this. I'll keep you posted on my progress.

      I just completed my latest fun side-project: a poster for  urlLink Antibalas Afrobeat Orchestra , and more importantly, for  urlLink One Percent Productions , who organize the absolute best rock shows in Omaha (the  urlLink music scene  is the best thing about living in Omaha). So here is the poster that will decorate the streets of Omaha (and Lincoln...this happens to be for a Lincoln show).     Yes, it is a little  urlLink Saul Bass  inspired. It started out as a visual interpretation of the music. I had some blobby forms to represent the sounds of the horns, some dots for percussion, and the still surviving vertical bands are what the organ sounds like. I felt it should look a little political too, a fact you can't ignore if you hear their  urlLink music .  A little disclaimer: the political nature of this band has nothing to do with me doing for a poster for them. The opinions they express are not necessarily mine.

      The other day I saw  urlLink Michael Moore's   urlLink Farenheit 911 . I was initially disturbed by the film, but, like in  urlLink Bowling for Columbine , it was obvious that Moore was using dramatic devices to try to persuade the viewer, and I knew that the information presented couldn't be as simple as he was making it out to be. I found myself wishing that someone would compile retorts to the movie's issues. Then I came across  urlLink Dave Kopel 's  urlLink Fifty-nine Deceits in Farenheit 911 . I haven't had a chance to read the whole thing, but at first blush it looks like a promising resource for hearing the other side of the story, or to just get an understanding of how Moore manages to persuade the poor people who use his movies as their sole information source.  There are very few things in this world that I know enough about to express a strong opinion on, and politics is far from being one of them. I will spare you from hearing another uninformed opinion on politics, but present this resource for you to form your own opinions.

      Have you noticed the Shrek Postmarks from our friends at USPS?     This makes me ill. One: pop culture is pervasive enough as it is (which is what makes it pop culture, I guess), and I would rather not have its agents shoved in my face everywhere I go. Two: its one more place you can't look without being marketed to. Shocked a Graphic Designer is so anti-marketing, or rather  this  type of marketing?  urlLink I'm not the only one .

      Maybe you've noticed that my posts have slowed down a little. It's not that I have a shortage of things to say in this blog: I have many many ideas in my head...all that require more time and energy than I have at the moment. Work has been pretty busy lately. What do I do at work? Well, my job description, like many employees at  urlLink RDG Planning & Design , is non-existent (I view that as a good thing). Over the course of my two years there, my duties have included:    Redesigning and maintaining the  urlLink website  Developing Flash-based interactive CDs for the various focus markets Guiding the firm through a rebranding, and putting together the many elements that weren't attended to by the Graphic Design firm that developed the new branding system Managing an image library with a wonderful in theory, not so wonderful in practice, piece of software called  urlLink Cumulus  by  urlLink Canto  Architectural graphics: coloring floor plans/site plans, touching up renderings, creating materials for 3D renderings IT for my computer, seeing as I am fortunate enough to have the only Mac in my office Training other people in the office on  urlLink Illustrator  and  urlLink Photoshop , and serving as a resource for the myriad graphics related questions that come from a technologically advanced Architecture firm such as ours Developing a color management workflow ( urlLink Monaco EZ Color  is a great product for this)...yes, I now understand what all those Photoshop Color Warnings are about Creating promotional boards for showcasing completed projects, creating concept boards for competition entries Putting together "promos" for responding to  RFP s Determining the optimum printers to have for in-house printing (the  urlLink DesignJet 5500  from HP is good for the big stuff and we have a great  urlLink Minolta  Laser Copier/Printer/Scanner but I don't remember the model...there are so many options), and keeping those printers running smoothly "Scan monkey" and "print monkey" duties ("David, can you scan this/print this?") Designing PowerPoint presentations Designing dedication plaques for buildings Designing brochures Creating exterior paint schemes for buildings Answering the occasional computer question Making sure various displays around the office support our brand So, as you may have noticed, I have been almost entirely overhead for much of my days there, and that has kept me busier than your average 9-to-5-er. So far, my record is 67 hours in one week (keep in mind that I still have the  urlLink book club , other  urlLink AIGA  stuff, and occasional  urlLink AIA  events, too). Well, these last couple of weeks, in addition to having these duties, I have been blessed with some clients.  urlLink RDG Graphic Design  is finally, as I originally intended, bringing in revenue, and as anyone would do, I will make sure that when those clients' projects are done, there will be no second thought as to whom they will come next time they have a project. Some of the projects I have in progress, or coming up, include a booklet, promotional CD, exterior building signage application, wayfinding, museum catalog and a newsletter redesign.  Fortunately, not ALL of the above duties are still duties of mine. Many people have learned enough Illustrator and Photoshop to do alot of the coloring of floor plans, sight plans, and renderings, we hired a great marketing/writing person to concentrate on promos and color management hasn't been an issue as of late. Some of the things will seemingly never get attended to, such as the image library (it's never done!).

      Since starting blogging, I have increasingly found myself referring people to my blog, rather than explaining things that already reside there. Though my blog isn't particularly personal, it reminds me of those rather impolite mass-emails you may get from a friend on occasion saying "This is what is going on in my life: yadda yadda." I say rather impolite because my natural reaction has always been "Who are you to think I care?" and "Am I not important enough for you to write an e-mail just for me?"  That's what's great about blogs:   You can tell a story, or get information out there and only have to tell it once Others who spend a lot of time around you don't to get sick of hearing it over and over Others are less inclined to wonder why you think they care, because they have sought the information Others can consult the information at their leisure You don't have to worry about omitting crucial information from one telling to another Anyway, now I sometimes find myself explaining something that happens to already be on my blog, then I get fed up, stop explaining, and simply say "just read my blog." How selfish of me to consider my time so precious that another moment of human interaction isn't worth explaining something an extra time.   Some people get offended if you don't read their blog. I had someone ask me, "Hey, David, how is the blog going?" I, of course, responded "Don't you read it? If you read it you wouldn't have to ask me that question."   I think some day in the future a man will come home from work and say to his wife "Hi, honey, how was your day?" and her response will be a hurt "Don't you read my blog!?" Or, he might even hear "Are you reading another woman's blog!?"

      I have for some time noticed it, but didn't know what to call it until today. Affluenza: the disease of epidemic proportions that causes Americans to sacrifice their health, communities, and families, all for the senseless pursuit of owning  stuff , or simply "wealth" to buy  stuff . Apparently, there's a  urlLink TV show  on it, a  urlLink book , and  urlLink seminars  to help combat it (the friend who introduced me to Affluenza noted that perhaps to buy the book was to demonstrate that you have Affluenza). I love this quote from the Amazon.com book review: "To live, we buy..all the while squelching our intrinsic curiosity, self-motivation, and creativity." Apparently this book won't teach you anything you don't already know, but it's exciting to witness our society finally waking up.  Do I have affluenza? I score 15 points on the  urlLink Affluenza Diagnosis Test , which puts me just below having mild Affluenza. Well, nobody is perfect, and it's not like all posessions are bad. Some of the things that may or may not make me guilty of Affluenza:  I have a TV...and cable, even though I only watch one or two channels, an average of 1 hour a week. My computer is  always  on. I'm using my Air Conditioner today (we have over 100 degree heat index today!) My car is a V6, and I drive to work about 4 miles every day at a speed of 30mph. My personal belief is that if you truly have an intrinsic passion for something, owning a few things that help you exercise that passion is okay. That's why I won't count my two guitars, my CD's, and my book collection. Perhaps I shouldn't count my computer being on all of the time, because it enables me to exercise my passion for design and for the internet (I believe there is virtue, if used for certain things, in the information classification and transfer that the internet makes possible). Also, working alot of hours has been cited as a symptom of Affluenza, but I do that because I like what I do (not that I  never  work a few more hours than I'd actually like to).  Of course, the "passion" argument sucks, because someone could say "I have a passion for driving an obnoxious tank that gets 6 miles a gallon half an hour to and from work down the main arterial road of my city," and that's not cool. I guess if you're concerned about it, ask me, and I will tell you whether you should make your purchase or not. I'll get this all sorted out some day into a solid argument, but until then, just be careful.  A truly fascinating art project related to this from right here in Nebraska:  urlLink Obsessive Consumption .  Sidethought: I wonder if our economy would just collapse if everyone were magically cured of Affluenza.

      There are very few resources on sustainable print design, but  urlLink Print Design and Environmental Responsibility  from the  urlLink AIGA Design Business and Ethics Series  is a good start.   After reading it, the outlook for sustainable print design in America looks pretty bleak – not that personal experience has indicated otherwise. I asked my printer the other day if he takes special measures towards minimizing his company's impact on the environment, and his response, with a confused look on his face, was "well, we recycle?" I'll have to get him a copy of this manual – maybe to be responsible, I'll just send him a PDF.  I'm also considering making the manual the subject of my  urlLink book club  one of these months. That, or/and  urlLink Cradle to Cradle .

      From  urlLink Form of the Book: Essays on the Morality of Good Design   Today, good taste is often erroneously rejected as old fashioned because the ordinary man, seeking approval of his so-called personality, prefers to follow the dictates of his own peculiar style rather than submit to any objective criterion of taste.  Here's another:  Since typography appertains to each and all, it leaves no room for revolutionary changes. We cannot alter the essential shape of a single letter without at the same time destroying the familiar printed face of our language, and thereby rendering it useless.  Reiterating the previous idea:  ...the typographer is chained more than any other artist by the unalterable word...   You can find these great thoughts, and more, in the essay  urlLink Clay in a Potter's Hand .
