      October 19  Now that i got a blog wut do i do?  First things first, i am not those kind of ppl who just sit and stare at the comp aaaaallllll daaaaaaay loooong.  The expression i used above is a hy-per-bo-le ( u know, watching anime 24/7).  I have a life u know.  I bicycle, read books, type stories and study (no i dont). hmmmm... Does anyone here actually watch anime here or am i a stick in the mud? Love Hina? Inu Yasha? Ranma? Prince of Tennis? Read or Die?  CardCaptor Sakura? Any of these sound familiar? well, i know u know Cardcaptors everyone does, but i am talking about the real thing.  CardCaptors SUCK! CardCaptor Sakura is a lot better cuz it hasnt been changed into a lame, sappy cartoon that everyone hates.  Ok that's it.  I'm done 4 the day. Peace out.  animedreamer

      Hey, I just wanted to say something i've always wanted to say:  Donate to animals!  They're as important as saving humans!  Cruelty to animals is invisible but that doesnt mean it doesnt exist....Some cruelty to animals isnt really done on purpose!  One poor dog died when his owner, left him locked in a car with closed windows on a baking hot day for THREE HOURS! The poor creature ended up dying from suffocation and was mostly baked alive in the car!  Some people shouldnt even have pets!  One extremely disturbing man took his dog on a leash and forced it to run beside his car as he was driving at 50 mph!!!  When he was finally caught, he didnt care about half-killing his dog, in fact, he LAUGHED!  Horrible people like this should NEVER and i mean NEVER be allowed to own a pet!!!  We've grown up with animals since the beginning of time!  They're like family and this is how we treat them? It's shameful!

      Bonjour!  I just thought that i post up 2 many pics and that i should really be typing more Useless fact: Humans eat at least 6 spiders in a lifetime (in their sleep *duh*) Is it quantum theory or relativity? I'm not very sure........i think i'm more on quantum theory's side..cuz i'm that kind of person who believes in that kind of stuff.....but then again i believe in lots of stuff like being able to write poetry and fantasy books about elves, bow and arrows, magic, god and goddesses.....  I think i'll write and Acrostic poem:  Dare to imagine Reality is unknown Each one in an Abstract way My world

      Snow of heavenly white descending softly from the skies!  Drifting lazily in the air....like pure white dust motes.  It is so pretty on the ground frosting the trees like icing.  To me, there is no more beautiful a season than Winter.  It is quite a shame that ppl ruin it and step all over it.  Snow is at its sparkling, utmost and untainted beauty when undisturbed.  Like little soft clouds on the grass. Not in clumsy packages we call " snowballs".  Each snowflake is different, like our world, everyone is separate,individual, unique.  I love snow.  I love its soft, gleaming shine.  And it cool and cold feeling.  It's so lovely, to touch snow.  Fortunately, I'm not like Jenny ( she eats the stuff! Poor little snowflakes!) =)

      Hey! Just in case u ppl havent seen, my cousin added in a comments section to my blog 4 me so u can comment on my...stuff....that i write......be sure to check back because i'll write down an answer too.  u can also read other ppl's comments.  In order to do these, look under the entry that u wish 2 comment and u should see something that says comments (0) the number in ( ) means the number of comments i got on that one ( Mr. Aimers is going to kill me 4 using these dull verbs) .  By the way, Fhrank you, Owlan! ( His real name's Alan but i've called him Owlan since my brother pronounces it that way...He's lucky that i didnt say Alanna cuz once when he was about my age, he made a spelling mistake on his name...yep...thatz rite he accidentally spelled his name like Alanna!)  By the way (again), he is now in university and he's not stupid anymore (hmm....) his blog is http://hisbloodbringshope.blogspot.com =)

      hahahahah! I just remembered Dana complaining about Roya!  Roya: " Am i uglyyy?" Dana: " Of course not ur beautiful as u r" Roya: "I'm uuuugllyyyyy!"  Why do we all have low-esteem? I have it too but i guess we should truly be proud of ourselves for who we are! If ur ugly as me then DON'T WORRY!  It doesnt matter!  Beauty inside is numero uno!  Keep ur soul and heart pure and, if you have a crooked nose or a potbelly or wutever, you will always look beautiful!  U realize, beauty isnt silky hair fair skin and light voice ( mine is squeaky like Alvin and the chipmunks).  Beauty is the kindness in your face and laughter.  Would you not say an ugly person like me who is mostly laughing with friends and enjoying the simple pleasures of life is a lot better than a beautiful yet cold person?

      Life is fueled by want for Love.  If I do not feed my want then soon I will lose my soul, my happiness and my will to live.  My eyes are so tired of crying and wish to close for all eternity.  Soon I shall become but a walking shell of Nicole who has eyes but cannot see, lips but cannot speak, ears but cannot hear and a heart but cannot love.  Is this to be life when one has lost love?  The sole purpose to live?  One day, when i have finally conquered Life and Love, I will look back and laugh.

      I think i'll write a poem:   Scour the ocean, land, sky and sea But never will you be able to find me, Look over grass and tree, Wherever you look, I will flee, Oh, how I am so glum, so glum If only I could spread the wings of Freedom! I travel on the lightest breeze, Though the sky, and through the trees, I could run forever and for eternity, I have never experienced jollity, Know you not who I am? I am the Wind...

      I was listening to a song today on my CD player.  I was wondering...Why are most songs about Love and Sadness? "Wo ai ni.....ching ni dai wo dow ni de sen pau..." (I love you please bring me to your side).  Are we obsessed with Love?  Have we all seen too many soaps? Three simple words that can melt anybody's heart:   Wo Ai Ni (Mandarin) Je te aime (French) ego tu amat (Latin) Ngo Ai Lai (Cantonese) I love you

My friends, beanie babies and candy with some candles for some.  Merry Xmas to all,  Crisp and fine flakes of snow  Hiding in the trees Restless children thinking for the Ideal present to Show their parents Trinkets and chocolate  Made so merrily  And most important don't forget Santa is coming to visit...

      Gah!  Science exams 2morrow.....i hate science..  lessee...  ions,cations, anions, atoms,  molecules et le tableau periodique.....  You know, science is bad but the school couldnt stand that so they had to make it FRENCH--> AND  Why do i need french science anyway?  i live in an English society!  I think TFS does not realize most of their students dont know the english names of the digestive system!  HELLOOOO!!!!!  most students are just learning french as a little extra!  we dont want to do divisions like ppl in France do!!  SHEESH!  Most students are also going to be going to ENGLISH university!!!  " Ms.  Leung what is the name of the tube that transports food into the stomach?"  "I dont know, sir.  I went to a French School but i do know that it is called  un Oesophage......"  "  I dont speak French, Ms. Leung!  And, it's called an ESOPHAGUS!  Idiot!  Kids learn that in Gr. 5!  Go sit in the corner!"  Nicole: * puts on yellow cone with the words " Dumbass" on it and sits in the corner*  * Class points and laughs*  Nicole: * Frowns and gets expelled*

      Getting to know someone is like peeling a clementine... Though the soft and ugly peel can be distasteful,  the inside can be incredibly sweet and delicious :P I kind of learned that the hard way.  Now, to resume eating my clementines,  I need my vitamines after all....!

      Maiden Dancing in the Forest all alone.  Fast, Fast, Faster twirls.  When will she stop?  Dusk comes, she wont stop.   Someone stop her.  Midnight now and she's still dancing.   The full moon's tears of light fall in spots at her feet through the singing leaves of the forest.  The moon is gone.   The forest is gone.  A ground covered in green leaves.  Darkness envelopes the land.  I can hear her crying still.

      Who is the bastard cloaked in an innocent disguise?  Who is the cunning of evil and hate?   My life is ruined, yes, ruined.  I am dead to my friends, the world and myself.  Dead, i say!   Why, why do you do this to me cruel world?  Have i done something wrong?   All month, NOT ONE GODDAMN GOOD THING has happened to me!   Why is it so, Fate?  Lies have always been the enemy.   Lies are always lurking under the skin of a liar.  Lies, lies.  They have nipped, pestered and attempted to ruin my life many times before.   But, why now?  Why?  They've torn apart my life, reputation and will to live!   What else do they want from me?  Is this truly a sign for me to kill myself?   Over and over again.  Thoughts of Death haunt me!  I want to die.   My reputation is spoiled my life, impure.  Death, death.  Blood, blood.   A splash of crimson paint on a wall and smoking gun in a dead hand.   Better yet, a hand hanging limply over a bed with blood trickling ever so slowly into pools on the floor.   Cuts and slashes on a mutated corpse bearing but a bloodied kitchen knife and a smile.

      I make no sense anymore.  whatever happened to the English writing loving Nikki in me?  gone, says I, gone.  You might not ever see her again.  She has realized that she is no longer a little girl who can cry to get her way but a young woman who has to try harder and get a more serious grip on reality.  I have become split in half.  One side just wants to be a little girl and stamp her feet while the other wants to become something better.  I argue with myself and hear voices in my head.  "Why is this reality?  Why? Why? This isnt what happens in fairy tales and books.  Nikki, stop talking to yourself like you're the main character of a tragedy/romance.  This is reality.  But, why?  I want to be someone but it seems so far away in the distance.  It's like trying to catch a glimpse of a setting sun with rooftops obscuring the view.  Who knows?  I want to kow who's being so cruel to me and i wonder, who is the one who is weaving my tale of life with a golden pen or silver tongue?"

      Once there was Earth and there was Sky.  They were lovers.  One day Sky left Earth to find a better home for them.  A cry pierced through the universe as he searched.  It was Earth.  Her voice was so full of agony and writhing in pain that Sky returned to her side immediately.  Tears were coursing down her cheeks and her words were laced with sadness and pain. “  It hurts,” She whispered while weeping, “ They’ve cut my proud trees, chopped down my fine green hair.  They’ve killed my children.  They’ve poured a vile liquid over my skin.  They’ve thrown their waste into my tears.  Why?  Why?  Stay away from me, beloved.  I am hideous.” Sky soothed her tears and promised to stay with her forever.  He embraced her and wrapped his arms around her body.  He would wait with her and share her pain until They left.  When She could choose, when Her children were reborn.  That was when they would cease to wait.  He cried with her at times.  His tears of pure love vanished into her flesh and helped her bear the pain.  The stars and drops of rain were his sparkling tears.  They would stay together until the end.  Their love was only pure.

I took the risk i meant to not take but it aches at my heart still.  I know this was a bad time.  I know that when i'm not with you my presence will fade from your mind.  Was it just a game or truth?  Will i fade from your eyes next year?  Questions pepper my mind anxiously.  I want to see you.  I want to talk to you but i doubt that you do as well.... Aren't you glad i'm gone?

      Week after week of swimming has finally piled up on my hair. It's stringy, dry and has no more shine (eeyurk!). In truth, it's disgusting to touch. I cringe to touch or brush it. Therefore, I have made the decision to finally get rid of this burden, my long hair. I've been thinking that i should cut it above my shoulder and donate the hair to...whatsitcalled? Some place where they use human hair to soak up the bad oil spills in the ocean. Yes, i like that. Saving the world while getting a haircut. So, hair above the shoulder. I'm still hesitating to cut my hair though. Will i look like an idiot with short hair? I was thinking about cutting it the same as Erene's.....

I do admit i dont want to grow up.  I just get the feeling i want to stay 12 forever.  I don't want to become a teenager...I just don't think i'm ready for that kind of responsibility.  I have lived for such a short time but i now have so many memories and some of the things i do seem so big for me.  When i'm older, i'll have more memories and bigger responsibilities.  I have had the chance to live to this point and see how the world works.  How fairy tales don't just come from daydreaming.  Each year brings a fruitful crop of memories.  Farewell, child.  Will my thoughts be different when i am older?  I dont know.  That's why i want to record them as soon as possible......      Happy Birthday   Happy Birthday to me..... Happy Birthday to me.....

At night i stare at my bedroom ceiling with thoughts peppering my mind.  I'm crying inside.  Why do we humans forget so easily?  Can we really lose feelings so quickly?  I want to forget.  I want to forget but the memory stays in my mind.    I think of it 24/7.  It makes me want to cry more.  What is this feeling?

You share company with Caesar, Homer, Virgil, Socrates, and Aristotle. There is no punishment here, and the atmosphere is peaceful, yet sad.

      There is nothing more pleasant than being in the presence of one person you really really like.  To one person, you may be the whole world to.  Just being, just existing, just standing next to them always is more than anyone could ever ask for.  Never speak carelessly to those who care about you.  What if you say something that truly offends them?  I myself know that i am so happy and fit to burst with joy when i am surrounded by my friends and loved ones, who, i know, love me very much as well...     You might think of yourself as nobody who cant do anything but you can.  You might be blind to your talent but others can see it so clearly because your talent is on you back.  You cant see it but others can.  Don't think of yourself as a nobody.  Everyone is a somebody to someone and perhaps the whole world to others.

      This is a little image taken from Sasuke's death scene.  It was one of my favorite scenes in the entire series so far.  Very well done and quite sad.  Sasuke is one of my favorite characters.  I just love how stubborn and silent he is.  It's also quite funny how he reacts to certain things.  Basically what happened was that while Naruto and his team had been assigned a mission meant for young children like weeding or catching pets, there was a mixup and they were assigned with a mission meant for professional ninjas.  Sasuke gets trapped in an ice prison and Naruto comes in to help.  Despite their efforts, they are easily defeated.  Naruto gets knocked out and Sasuke is the only one left standing (Sakura is not in the ice prison, she's protecting the child and his master's target).  Haku, the genius child controlling the ice prison, sends a shower of needles to Naruto, thinking that even if Sasuke seemed to hate Naruto, he would go protect him.  Sasuke positions himself in front of Naruto and the needles penetrate his body.  Naruto wakes up and sees Sasuke.  "You did it, Sasuke!" he says but freezes and his smile disappears once he sees the fatal wounds all over his friend.  "You're always such a burden" coughs Sasuke.  The needles are poking out from Sasuke's back and blood is dripping on the floor.  "Why?" he mutters, "You protected me...  "Who knows..." Sasuke mutters while coughing up blood and remembering the times he and Naruto spent together as rivals, "I...hated you " "Why did you protect me?" yells Naruto angrily while clenching his fist tightly, " I NEVER ASKED YOU TO!". "How am i supposed to know?" whispers Sasuke, " My body moved of its own accord, stupid..." His eyes close and his body slides down to the floor.  Naruto catches him and sees Sasuke's eyes that were wide with fear and sadness.  "I didn't want to die until i killed my brother." Sasuke whispered near tears and reaching out his hand to Naruto,"I wanted to accomplish my dreams.  You... don't die."  Naruto stares in disbelief as Sasuke's hand drops to the floor, motionless.  Sasuke's stubborn eyes and features relax.  His mouth opens slightly and his head falls back.  Naruto realizes that this is the way of the ninja and that he might soon lose more friends as he grows up.  He drops Sasuke's body on the floor and cries out, "Shut up, stupid.  I...hated you too.  You will pay.  You will pay for killing my friend."  Of course, i can't tell you what happens next.  Heheh, that would ruin the story.  Watch the anime yourself.        And this is Sakura crying over Sasuke's dead body.

      Hm...i really like that other skin but the font colour was just too plain.  Also, I would suggest that the maker of that skin have put the whole thing in dark blue with the words as white.  i would have loved it if that's wat it were like.  If you're wondering what skin it was, it was Wishful Wonders on blogskins.com.  if you have the time, plz tell the author how i feel because i'm too shy to do it.

      Anyhow...I reinstalled my camera on my new comp check it out...   most recent pic of me   believe it or not, it's me.  I decided to mess around with the effects to make it seem like a portrait.  A more or less failed but nice attempt if you ask me.  As you can see, I'm still in my uniform.  Yes, well that's because i'm too lazy to change. Now you know what a lazy slob i am as well as a slacker and diagnosed with a severe case of procrastination. Ps.  My bro's hiding behind my head.  youcan see his big head sticking out if you look carefully.

Yup.....Ego sum fatua (I am stupid)  Somehow i wonder why all the other Chinese girls are smart and why I'm the only exception.  I really don't like being stupid.  Maybe I'm not like all the other Chinese girls.  Nooooooo....i don't want to be an outsider.  I'm not intelligent enough!  I can't even speak my own language for crying out loud.  the only language i excel at is English

      Ok, i made up my mind.  i choose the anime layout i had before.  i hope the maker doesnt mind that i altered it to my taste a bit...i just want to get rid of that Wishful Wonders part because that's NOT my blog title.  The title is Riceball Girl.  Also i changed the bottom since it looked so plain.  And why isnt the clock that i put up on it not working?  Still, it's a pretty good job, considering that i taught myself how to manage HTML

        Innocent Love- You're living in a fairy tale world Cinderella. You're sweet and kind and often expect everything to be very perfect just as you try to be.  You can be a bit over whelming to those who aren't as much of day dreamers as you. It's all fine and good to be sweet but just remember... Reality is a hard smack in the face and it hurts a lot if you aren't expecting it.    urlLink   What Kind Of 'Love' Do You Have To Offer?

Do you have a home page? If so, please share its address. Yes, this site, the tfsers site and my fanart site (riceballgirl.bravehost.com)  Q4. How long have you known about "Tennis no Oujisama"? Oh, a long time.  Maybe two years  Q5. What was your impression when you read saw "Tennis no Oujisama" the first time? Haha...This is such a great anime.  I love it.  I must see more.  I love how Ryoma is so cocky and Sakuno is such a lovable character.  Fuji and Kikumaru are quite lovable too.  Q6. How did you come to be obsessed with "Tennis no Oujisama"? My cousin introduced it to me.  I liked tennis but i thought an anime about it would be boring.  It's just addictive because most of the moves that they do are practically impossible and that's why it's a great escape from reality.  Q7. Who is your favourite character? I love them all.  Ryoma, Sakuno, Kikumaru, Fuji...  Q8. If you went on a date with the character from Q7, where would you go? Dunno.  Er..let's see....shopping with Fuji, carnival with Kikumaru and i guess...playing tennis with Ryoma They're all too passionate about tennis to date  Q9.

Casual clothing instead of uniforms all the time.  Q12. Who would you like the character from Q7 to cosplay as? Kikumaru can be Zidane from FF9 (he'd need to mess with his hair a bit but..) Fuji could be Yuki from Card Captor Sakura Ryoma could be Squall from FF8 Sakuno could be Kaoru from RK or maybe Hinata (because they act the same)  except for the hair...  Q13. What do you think the character from Q7 will do (occupation) in the future? (Excluding being a tennis player!) Sakuno would be a librarian.  She'd probably do charity work too (because she's so kind) Ryoma could be (oh this is hard...) model (that was random) Fuji could be a talk show host Kikumaru would be a famous pop star  Q14. Share the favourite sayings of the character from Q7. (Give as many as you like!) Sakuno:  Anou... Ryoma: Mada Mada Dane Kikumaru:  Hoi hoi!  Nyaaaaaaa!  Q15.

What is your favourite couple? SakuRyo (obviously)  Q20. What do you think is the major coupling in the fandom? Yaio couplings.

They're both kinda young no?  I'd like to see Sakuno telling Ryoma how she feels and mustering enough courage to talk to him.  I'd like to see Ryoma's reaction and what he would do.  Q23. What sort of place would fit your favourite couple? Outside at a park or at an amusement park  Q22. What would you like to say to your favourite couple? (Give as many as you like!) "You're so kawaaaiiiiiii :3"  Q24. What is your favourite doubles combination? Kaidoh and Inui  Q25. Share your best three favourite scenes. The scene when Ryoma is a chibi and he gets beaten by Fuji and runs off with sniffling and saying, "Mada...Made mada Dane!".  Also the one where Ryoma puts his Seigaku jacket on for Sakuno and every scene that he provokes ppl with his cocky attitude  Q26. Share your best four favourite lines. "Mada mada Dane"- Ryoma "OH MY GOD!  OH MY GOD!  OH MY GOD" - Taka "Anou...arei....mou....anou...."- Sakuno's mumblings Shinji's mutterings too  Q27. Do you have a favourite phrase for something like "I'm going to defeat you!"? Nope.  Well maybe this "You're going to die"  Q28. What is your favourite phrase?

If i could name myself a japanese name, it'd probably Saki (or Sakuno but ppl would think i'm a freak.  wait...i am one.)  How long have you liked anime? Since the beginning of time.  I was born for anime.  What was the first anime you ever saw? I dont really remember.  The first few were Prince of Tennis, Love Hina and...Inu Yasha.  I guess Sailor Moon counts as well (though i hate it now)  What was the first song you every heard in Japanese? The Prince of Tennis intro (which is pretty good)  Can you speak some Japanese? i know some words and simple stuff  Can you read any Japanese? Nope.  I can't even read in Chinese very well (yet) ^.^;;;  Do you own anything anime? yes.  lots of stuff.  If you could see my room, every square inch of the wall is covered by anime posters and my desk is filled with anime drawings.  I own a lot of dvds and cds filled with anime too.  Do you have any imported anime items? yup  Do you own a video game system and RPGs like Final Fantasy? All of the Final Fantasy games and lots of other RPGs (Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross..etc)   Favorites   Anime series: Prince of Tennis, Naruto, Inu Yasha  Anime movie: Hmmm...it would be a Prince of Tennis movie if there was one but instead it would be the Inu Yasha movie with the wacky elf guy who controls ppl and makes Kagome grow long nails so that she can throw them at ppl (lol) ^.^  Manga: Prince of Tennis and Naruto  Manga artist: Hm...never thought about that one..  Japanese singer: Er...Utada Hikaru or Yuko Sasaki  Japanese song: Haruka Kanata and all the Prince of Tennis openings and endings ^.^ (I'm such a retard)  Anime opening song: please refer to question above  Anime closing song: Prince of Tennis endings (profound, huh?)  Voice actress: Minagawa Junko  Voice actor: Yamaguchi Kappei, Hoshi Souichirou, Seki Tomokazu~  Japanese snack food: Hm..i eat so many that i lost track.  Well, sushi is my favorite Japanese food and there was this Japanese milk tea drink that's my favorite in the world.  hmm...is Pocky Japanese?  I gotta check that up....  Flavor of Pocky: Milky Pocky *mmm....sweet and smooth*  Anime character (female): Sakuno from Prince of Tennis.  SA-KU-NO! Sakuno *sweatdropping*:  Anou...it doesnt seem like i'm very popular.  Everyone else wants Ryoma to have a yaio relationship with Momo-senpai...   Anime character (male): Ryoma.  Definitely Ryoma.  I love you Ryoma.  Anime couple: RyoSaku (so original..everyone else seems to want gay relationships within the Seigaku team.  I dont have anything against gay ppl but goddammit!  Ryoma is 12 years old ok?  You cant make a twelve year old have a relationship with a 13/14 year old!  He doesnt even know himself much yet!)  Final Fantasy (including Kingdom Hearts): Final Fantasy 7,9,and 10 and Kingdom Hearts  Non FF RPG: Chrono Cross  Final Fantasy female: Tifa, Garnet, Rhinoa, Rikku (I used to think her name was Rhino.  lol.  Does anyone else notice that these girls all look the same, except for Rikku. It seems that Squaresoft likes girls with dark hair and dark eyes)  Final Fantasy male: Cloud.....Cloud.....Cloud........Cloud....Cloud....did i mention Cloud?    Final Fantasy song or theme: The FF8 beginning song   Have you ever...  Been to a convention: I'd love to but i'm too young and my parents probably wouldnt let me  Cosplayed: I'd love to...if i could sew...  Eaten pocky: *Munching on 60 pocky stick at a time*  Been to an anime store and spent all your money: That would be heaven if i could find an anime store with the best Prince Of Tennis goods ever...  Gotten a plushie of one of your favorite characters: I'm going to get a little Chibi Ryoma keychain maybe.  I'd love one if i had a credit card...in order to order online...   Had an all-nighter watching anime: Yes and even when i'm sleeping my mind replays anime episodes in my head.  Sad, aint it?   Quoted an anime or Final Fantasy character to try and sound smart: Yes..Mada mada dane...  Played FFVII: Yes   Bought soundtracks to your favorite FF game or any FF game in general: Nyahahaha *quoting Naruto/Kikumaru* yes..*pats computer*  Drawn fanart: Yes.  Check out http://riceballgirl.bravehost.net (a little advertisement cant hurt right?)  Gotten a crush on a anime guy/girl: I love you Ryoma!  *squeezes picture of Ryoma*  lol, i'm just joking.  No.  Gotten a crush on an FF guy/girl: No.  Gotten your picture taken while in costume: yada *quoting Ryoma*  Gone to Japan: nope  Seen the entire Evangelion series: gag me  Made out with a picture of an anime/FF character: do ppl do that O.o?  *shudder*  Wished you were Japanese: I'm proud to be Chinese  Said 'tsukini kawate oshiokyo': no  Played any Final Fantasy: Hell yeah *quoting Sakura*  Spoken Japanese in public and have people stare at you: Are?  Ehh...wakaranai...  Seen a Studio Ghibli movie: yes   Misc  How many times a day do you think about anime or FF? I breathe it.  i live on it.  I'm told that i act like an anime character too.  i guess the anime thought infiltrate my brain and are trying to take over my body.  Do you watch old school anime? Old school anime?  like the classics like Fushigii Yuugi, Slayers, Gundam and whatsitsname.....   How many anime and FF CDs do you own? too many to say  Can you name all the anime and manga you've seen and read in under a minute? no, that's impossible.  Give me a year or two and i'll be able to piece it together.  Do you consider yourself an Otaku? Crazy anime fan?  yes.  I have no life whatsoever.  I have radioactive powers from sitting in front of the computer so long.  *fries brother with beams that shoot out of her eyes*

      I'm addicted to a new anime now.  ^.^ It's called X (or XTV...I'm not too sure).  It's about swords, fighting, fate and the end of the world.  I love it.  I love it as much as Prince of Tennis though the storyline is a bit hard to understand... Strangely, the main character in X resembles the main character in Prince of Tennis.  Hmm...    Kamui, protagonist in X    Ryoma, Prince of Tennis  See?  See?  There DO seem like each other.  *GASP*  Maybe they're cousins (or brothers...)!

      I'm not too obsessed with Prince of Tennis am I?  I know all the characters' birthdays.  Erm...Ryoma's will be on the 24th of December (Happy B-day, Ryoma-kun!  Ganbatte!)  and that Sakuno's will be coming soon in January...erm.. I'm kinda strange, no?  I'm one of the only ppl in the grade that watch anime.  Frankly....I'm the only girl that watches anime in the grade...Huh..... I think i'm also the only one to play rpg games like FF7 and all the Final Fantasy series as well as Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross.... Actually...Stacey used to play FF7 too.... I'm getting confused. I'm much more different than the other girls.  Instead of posters of male celebrities in my room, the majority are anime posters (2 Prince of Tennis posters, one Inu Yasha, Gundam Endless Waltz and Naruto...I used to have a Sailor Moon roll out poster but i gave that away...it was actaully quite pretty with all the flowing blue background and smooth yet blurry collections of dreamy colours....).  I dont wear skirts either.  Hmm.. I hate skirts and dresses.  They're not comfortable at all.  I also hate wearing makeup (i dont have anything with other ppl wearing it though.). Am i weird?  My mom says not to worry since I'm already very ladylike but in what ways?

      In response to the guy who put up a message asking for a website for Kikumaru Eiji pics (fufufufufufu....Kikumaruuuu...) there's a really good collection of them at ponta.org, possibly the best PoT fan site there is.  Hoihoi!    Eiji: Ochibi-nyah!  Hoihoi!   Waaaah!  Kawaii-nyah!

      Eeeexcellent...more Prince of Tennis episodes have been released.  Mmm...more Ryoma and Seigaku-ness.   lol.  Nikki:  Help me improve my tennis, Ryoma Ryoma: Yada (No way) Nikki: ... Ryoma: ... Nikki:  Teach me. Ryoma: Yada Nikki:  Yes. Ryoma: No Nikki: Yes Ryoma: No [After a few hours] Ryoma: >. Nikki:  Yeah!  Constant annoyingness emerges victorious once again Ryoma:  Stand over there across the court and I'll check your form [cool music starts playing] Ryoma: *serves* unh...! [Ball flies across in slow motion while Nikki runs slowly to the ball to hit it with her racket.] Nikki: *falls on the floor and misses* blast... Ryoma:  ... Nikki:  Let's just forget this and try again. Ryoma: *serves again* fine Nikki: *runs towards the ball, gets hit in the face with it, falls down* blast...again... Ryoma:  Mada Mada Dane (No, not yet...) Nikki: Triple blast...

      I started to watch Jungle Wa Itsumo Hale Nochi Guu (Phew!) My fav. character is probably the mysteriously hilarious Guu whose laughter is mechanic.  I absolutely love the way she is drawn and I die laughing whenever she does something weird.  The way she say "Itai (ow)" is also mechanic and without feeling, which makes it even more funny.  Yes, I love Guu even though she eats everything from swords to plates.

      Hurrah!  I have now fixed my blog and it actually displays properly now!  Double Hurrah!  Unfortunately, I had to delete the tagboard so perhaps you could all use the comments columns (an entry form for the comments list is available above each of my blog entries, just click the blue font that says Comments) to post up your messages until I get a new tag board.  I can't seem to remember the address for the other one i had.  O_o I'm sorry if I haven't been updating in a while.  Homework and studying are slowly taking me into their grip 24/7 now so forgive me if i dont post enough.  Ja!

      I finally got around to correcting the blog (for the FOURTH time since I started it).  Blogger templates suck butt but I guess I'll just have to live with it.  *sigh* Every template seems to mess up after a few months.  Bleeeh.  I redid the comments column once more and made the pic that acts as a header (It's plain but prettiful, see?).  Yosh!  Time to bring this blog back to life!  Ahaahhahaahhaha!  *standing on a rock with waves splashing around her* >:D

      Mm...listening to Has Anyone Seen My Underwear by the Youth Ahead.  It's a really funny song.  I'll post up the lyrics here  Woke up, flat faced on a kitchen floor  With an empty bottle of JD still clasped in my hand My headache was intense, there was a sudden chill in the air  But the biggest shock that was yet to come, I was missing my underwear   Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?  Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?  Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?   I looked up and down, and all around  People stopped to stare  I asked everyone about it, but no one seemed to care  It's just not fair, what a nightmare  Wish I had a spare, but I don't   Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?  Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?  Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?   What could've happened with it?  I hear them all there laughing  Hiding myself in the dark  I hope nobody saw the skidmark   Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?  Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?  Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?   I was about to give up  I was about to go home  When I saw my pair of BVDs laying there by the phone  I knew that they were mine I saw that they were fine, but I was still drunk and naked  Everybody laughed and everybody screamed---   Has anyone,has anyone seen my underwear?  Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?  Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?   Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?  Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?  Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?   Where did it go...?

      I'll try my hand at poetry...  Different  I'm not like the other girls With shining locks and golden curls I don't paint my nail a bright red I don't have pink frills on my bed  I can't wear a skirt nor dress My room is always, always a mess Not sexy, not pretty, not smart Not very sweet, more or less tart  Sure...  I may have tiny slanted eyes And dark messy and stringy hair The kind that dreams and sighs Don't have the ideal figure of a pear  But I'm proud of who I am And nothing can change that [Not even anime]

      I joined up with Olivia to make a new blog.  This time, it's with me playing as Sakura from Naruto and her playing as Yukino from Kare Kano.  Yeah, it's just for fun but stupid blogger has been messing up the layout and the order of the posts as well as NOT updating any of the posts properly.  It was only today that they updated my blog and put up a post i wrote a few WEEKS ago.  I'm at my wit's end here.  http://riceballtrio.blogspot.com

      Mary Sues should be illegal.  They're so damn annoying and stupid.  I especially hate fics centered on them...IN PRINCE OF TENNIS. omg, you won't believe how many MS are running amok in the PoT fandom.  I found a particularly HORRIBLE story on ff.net today.  *shudders* Left an extremely long ass review to make sure the writer NEVER does that again.  Oh, that is disgusting.  Sakura *snort* it's a rip off Sakuno.  Who's that person?  In her profile it said Tomo and Sakuno dont fit Ryoma and that her silly little Mary Sue named Sakura is better because she's better than Tezuka in tennis, best friends with Ryoma and is extremely pretty, is a prodigy.  HELLOOO!  That's so perfect that it makes me want to puke.

       First Love, True Love... Everyone has a first love, but, if you grew up and got separated.  Would you remember their face? The face that made your heart beat fast?  The name that made you soft as clay?  And, how about the voice that drived you crazy.  Would you remember?  And, if you happened to meet that person one day, probably 35 years from now, would you recognise them?  Love and life are both short.  Enjoy them while you can because once you've lost someone you love, they're lost forever.

       An empty room All dusty grey A music box tinkles in the corner The notes are faint  And the gears are old But still I strain to hear And, you know what? I recognise the music  It's the song of loneliness  It's the song of sadness 365 days of joy 365 of pain To breathe one breath after the next To live and to forget To forget that I live Once this work is done I dance to the music Like a droplet of water

       Love. Is it a curse or a blessing?  When you love someone it's a wonderful feeling like you're floating off on a cloud, but, no matter what you do your heart is always broken.  It is always hard to get over a heartbreak and it's annoying when people tell you that you're being stupidly sad for no reason, especially if they've never experienced rejection before.  Sometimes you just gotta put up with it but sometimes if people get to hurt, they completely stop loving.  It's like the porcupine dilemma.  Porcupines would like to become friends but the closer they get, the more they hurt each other.  So, if you love someone, don't become close friends.  You'll only end up hurting each other badly.  After all, one year you could be the best pair in the world and afterwards they become friends with someone elsee and all communication ends.  Wouldn't you say that the best way to not hurt people is to stay away from them?

       Emily Dickinson (1830–86).  Complete Poems.  1924.   Part Three: Love  II    YOU left me, sweet, two legacies,—   A legacy of love   A Heavenly Father would content,   Had He the offer of;       You left me boundaries of pain          Capacious as the sea,   Between eternity and time,   Your consciousness and me.

       Part One: Life  I    SUCCESS is counted sweetest   By those who ne’er succeed.   To comprehend a nectar   Requires sorest need.       Not one of all the purple host          Who took the flag to-day   Can tell the definition,   So clear, of victory,       As he, defeated, dying,   On whose forbidden ear          The distant strains of triumph   Break, agonized and clear.

       Emily Dickinson (1830–86).  Complete Poems.  1924.   Part Two: Nature  I    NATURE, the gentlest mother,   Impatient of no child,   The feeblest or the waywardest,—   Her admonition mild       In forest and the hill          By traveller is heard,   Restraining rampant squirrel   Or too impetuous bird.       How fair her conversation,   A summer afternoon,—          Her household, her assembly;   And when the sun goes down       Her voice among the aisles   Incites the timid prayer   Of the minutest cricket,          The most unworthy flower.       When all the children sleep   She turns as long away   As will suffice to light her lamps;   Then, bending from the sky,              With infinite affection   And infiniter care,   Her golden finger on her lip,   Wills silence everywhere.

Part Four: Time and Eternity  LXVII    IF I should die,   And you should live,   And time should gurgle on,   And morn should beam,   And noon should burn,          As it has usual done;   If birds should build as early,   And bees as bustling go,—   One might depart at option   From enterprise below!         ’T is sweet to know that stocks will stand   When we with daisies lie,   That commerce will continue,   And trades as briskly fly.   It makes the parting tranquil          And keeps the soul serene,   That gentlemen so sprightly   Conduct the pleasing scene

       Today I asked Chris for his honest opinion on Ashton Kutcher and he should rate Him (notice the capital on Him) from one to ten...he said 0...i could not believe it. I admit, all girls rate other girls but all guys rate other guys to but they jsut don't have the guts to admit it. Chris jsut doesnt understand how good looking Ashton Kuthcher is...*sigh*

       The Last Scene  I tossed and turned feverishly throughout the night.  I could not rest.  I sat up and stared at the plain ceiling.  Something elusive lurked at the back of my mind.  Finally, I lay down and fell into a deep slumber.  I dreamed… I was in a dark room.  It was so dark that I felt I had become darkness itself.  It was dark and I liked it.  Suddenly, a face appeared as if it had been pulled out of murky water.  Its eyes stared vacantly at me with sorrow.  Its lips moved slowly. “Choose,” it said,” choose…” If eyes truly were windows to the soul, I agreed that this creature was, indeed, soulless.  “Where am I?” I said. The specter did not answer.  I realized, to my horror, my lips were paralyzed.  I felt foolish for becoming trapped by my own dream. “Choose…” crooned the looming face. An extravagantly decorated head appeared from behind.  Its earrings were of small, delicate and milky pearls.  Its hair was of lustrous red brown colour.  Yet, its eyes stared vacantly like the first. “Fortune…” it whispered as another beautiful face appeared.   “Fame…” said the other. Many faces were appearing out of the dark.  Voices echoed against each other.  Some shrieked in agony as others whispered in a honey-coated tongue. “ Beauty, luck, talent, joy…” The clashing voices continued until each face had stated its purpose. “Choose!” they shouted together. My heart raced.  Here, I could have any wish I wanted! Here, I could do anything!  I began to choose which face I should take.  I was excited until greed slapped me like a glove. “Choose!” they said angrily. I burst into tears.  I could not believe how selfish I had been.  I struggled to resist the power that was sealing my voice. “No!” I shouted to the faces.  I was as shocked as they were.  I had spoke! “No!” I continued,” I do not need your power!  I can decide my own path.  I will achieve what I want myself not by someone else’s power!” I stopped.  I was panting, no, gasping for air.  Fear began to run into my bones like cold water. “No?” Repeated the faces, lividly. I curled into a ball.  I waited to feel the angry faces tearing into my exposed backside.  When I opened my eyes, I was sitting in an old wooden chair in front of a fire.  An old man nudged me lightly with his cane and offered me a cup of cocoa. “ Welcome to Simplicity,” he seemed to sing slowly,” I believe you came from the land of Greed.  Many people have joined Greed and become one with the faces.  You are one of the few who refused the faces.  You see, every now and then, people dream of us.  We teach them wisdom.  Now, dear child, you may ask me a question and I will answer it.” I gripped the empty cup of cocoa in my hands.  I licked my lips and answered, “  What is the meaning of Life?” “  Life?  Silly child! Not everything must have a reason!  In life, you love and are loved.  You either help the world or hinder it.” I sighed. “Well, if you must know, the purpose of life is-“ Ring!  I woke up and slammed my alarm clock.  It just had to ring when I was about to learn the meaning of Life.  Then, I smiled. It was better this way.  I could learn the meaning of life myself.  I could almost hear the old man chuckling in the back of my mind. I spent the rest of the day at school pondering about my strange vision. “ Settle down, class” said the teacher, “today we will debate on quotations.” Character is what you are in the dark                 Quoted from Dwight L. Moody Was neatly printed on the board.   My arm itched as I raised my hand eagerly. The teacher nodded towards me.  I rose and began to speak. “ Had I been the person I was, I would disagree with this quotation.  But, since I am now a more learned child, I agree because of a dream I had….” And, the old man smiled.  End

       I found a sonnet i wrote in gr 6  Fire  The beautiful red-hot flames are dancing Bright orange feathers are licking the log Delicate sparks in the air are prancing Out of the chimney goes black and grey smog A steady crackling that makes you sleepy An animal that is of hot, bright red An ancient tool once used in a tipi Laughing and crackling as soon as it’s fed There, I lie next to the fire that’s hot I stare and stare at the welcoming blaze Turning over to warm whatever’s not Slightly, I peer through the cloudiest haze I look at the fire of intense heat Mother comes and envelops it with peat.

       I went to chinese school today. Simply, magical.  The festive spirit of chinese new year wuz everywhere.  Bright red was splashed generously everywhere and proud banners with golden calligraphy were waving to the thrumming of the drum.  The music was great.  Drum beats.  A fast rythmic pattern.  Matching to the soul.  Intoxicatingly good.  Children happily accepting red pouches filled with chocolate to the brim.  Dancing Dragons.  The dragons.  Twitching energetically to the fast beat and blinking their eyes coyly.  Their bodies flowed like liquid in the air as the head, constantly twitching, flashed in a massed tangle of hair.  They each had a charming little beard and a thickly covered eyelashes that hid their dancing eyes frequently.  IT was a scene that was wonderful to the heart and food to the soul.  It is a picture i will remember forever.  The Dance of The Dragon...

       ....I'm so stupid.  I'm too soft.  I say sorry to everyone all the time but it has become a terrible habit now.  I've become more clay that human.  No free will, no opinion, no nothing.  Anybody could just mold me to do anything they want.  Why am i so soft?  Say something wrong and i start to weep.  why?  Once a tear leaks out, i cant stop the waterworks.   Quote Erene, " Your eyeballs are going to melt soon because you've cleaned them too much with salt water."  How can i become more tough?  i dont want to be a shell with a heart of stone but if anyone knows my weakness they could do anything.  i can never say no

       Why does our world require Perfection?  I mean.  Sure we like perfection but why is it the " ultimate dream" for humans?  Being perfect might be great but if you think about it, if you're perfect then you have no reason to live. Like, one of the reasons to live is to be the best you can right?  To better yourself every day and live life at its fullest.  But, if you're perfect, what fun is there to live for?  I find it best to always try and better ourselves rather than be perfect all the time.   In fact, if humans do achieve perfection, they'd want it to be even MORE perfect.  Do you guys agree?

       I think all of us here are from the year of Horse soo...I 'm gonna post up a horoscope for us all:   Monday is auspicious for a Horse to start something new, as long as you don't rush in too quickly. Tuesday you are in the middle of a situation where angels fear to tread, and should also watch your step. Pay close attention to details on Friday. Monday and Tuesday investments are long-term if you don't have time to wait for profit. Monday's new love union demands the attention and patience you have little of, through Friday.

Zum Sterben und zum meiner Rum'...( i cant remember all of it...)  Aeroplane song:  One of these nights about twelve o'clock, the old world's gonna reel and rock.  The sinner's gonna tremble and cry for pain and the Lord will come in his aeroplane.  O ye thirsty of ev'ry tribe!  Get your ticket for an aeroplane ride!  Jesus, our savior is a comin to reign and the Lord will come in his aeroplane!  I know you guys dont want to hear my dumb stories about my life but i have no other things to write.

       A poem written by me, Nikki Leung...Ahem hem hem:  Scour the ocean, land, sky and sea But never will you be able to find me, Look over grass and tree, Wherever you look, I will flee, Oh, how I am so glum, so glum If only I could spread the wings of Freedom! I travel on the lightest breeze, Though the sky, and through the trees, I could run forever and for eternity, I have never experienced jollity, Know you not who I am? I am the Wind...

         Silence    The silence fills the room.  Eyes fixating on eyes, fingers twitching and bodies swaying... The heaviness in the atmosphere seeps slowly into the people.  They fidget silently.  Are they mute?   There they stand with no reply.  Waiting.  Yet, what do they wait for.  They wait for something to happen.  Unspoken thoughts  drift in the air uneasily.

       Waaaaah!  I lent everybody at school some of my precious paper so they could write letters to each for the March Break.  Some people got up to 8 letters.  I got only 4....i'm not loved....:'(  i spent all my time writing letters for everyone else who asked me but what do i get?  I wrote letters to at least 7 people!  :'(  try to be nice to some people and they dont even thank you.  Not saying that i'm ungrateful.  I'm happy that some people wrote stuff to me but WHAT HAPPENED TO THE REST?!?!?  Never being nice again.  i'm joking, joking.  I'm happy because everyone else will be happy when they read the letters.  I'm happy coz i just gave everyone happiness. ^_^

       Say something beautiful David.  Take this for example.  Springtime.  The beautiful season of Life.  The pristine snow drips silently off the blooming branches of a tree.  A time to regrow and renew ourselves by sowing new seeds of Hope.  Animals come to life once more, yawning clumsily.  And, the sky, with its deep blue colour of beauty, its serene face and patience.  Guardian of her children, golden patience and love.

        Life Sucks   Like you, Dana, i will start my list of rants.  Be prepared for a long list for I am in a very rant-ish mood:  - I miss JB and Fruitcake a lot - I miss my friends a lot - I miss Jeffrey and Tiffany - I miss school - Now that there's no school, I have nothing to do - I am forced to go on a ski trip next week with no computers :( or video games :'( or proper living quarters >'( - Now ONE IS WRITING ON THIS (&T&(%#$% BLOG BUT ME!!!!!!! HOW THE &^&(%&$ DID I EXPECT PPL TO BE INTERESTED IN THIS?!?!? - I'm the only one who enjoys writing and philosophy and typing down my thoughts here - I think I'm the only one who has written quite a number of deep sort of texts [the rest of you havent shown your talents yet....COWARDS!] -I have no self- esteem/ confidence - I feel i am hated [nuff said] - I am hated [ NUFF SAID!] - I think/act in a different way than other people - I wish I wasn't so different, I want to "blend" - I hate myself/ my life/ my thoughts/ my uniqueness - I'm not aggressive enough - I now sound like a really whiny person

" Can you beat Kingdom Hearts for me?  If not, can you save your completed game file on mine so that i can just see the ending and skip all the rest of the game?"  Yes, my fearsome meddling cousins:  Kimpossible Kimberly and Gilbert, Lord of Hyperness....

            You are pink. You are in limbo. Not pure and manipulated like white, not impure and noble like red. You are unsure of your real identity, but whatever you chose it to be, you can be it. That is your power. You change everyone you touch, and everyone remembers you. In literature, pink represents the place between heaven and hell. You are the one we will never forget.   What inner color are you?

            You are blue. You are somewhat innocent, in the fact that your genius only extends to the physical world. You have a false sense of contentness. You are usually the quiet one, the genius. Everyone can count on you to help when they have problems, but you only fall short of being able to solve your own.    What inner color are you?

       Adam, dont be so depressed.  I know life is shit sometimes but if you die, shouldnt you think about Anad?  what would Anad do if u died?  hmm..?  HMM...?  whenever u feel like dying just think about how you would really hurt ppl that care about you.  If you die, my life would be happy.  Meaning that you should not die or your most hated thought will come true :D Killing yourself is the coward's way out of life.  In fact, life is a journey, a test.  How long can you survive?  How long can you go on like this?  How long can you take the pain of life until you want to just drop dead and get it over with?  Life has bad points and i know that.  But... All lives also have happy parts like your first kiss, first date, grads, 100% tests *sigh*, once in a lifetime experiences and just having fun.  The longer your life goes on, yes, the more sad things will happen yet there will always be more happier thoughts.  Just be patient.  All lives end the same way.  Death.  Just wait and your time will come but enjoy life and its gifts for now.  Remember, Life isnt the only part of the journey, but death as well.  Struggle, sweat, work.  Never give up.  Because, if you keep on trying something good will happen, if you give up, you have no chance, period.

       woh, I feel so different, Tylenol really helps you, I'm tired. I think I took ttoo many.5 In 2 hours is ok right? getting drowsy. I composed a short song a while ago when I was crazy like now ( ps the words in this song have nothing to do with you, It just happeneds that it relates to todays events by luck, i made it a year ago) :  I'm getting sick and tired of love By nature I'm quite shy Yet puppy love is something I see too much of - - 'cause My hound gets round more than I - - aaahhhhwwwoooooooo  Maybe my front teeth are too big Or my sports car is too small 'Cause they say that I'm too short, when I know I'm way too tall Maybe I need to be less of a shrew 'Cause my dog gets more dates then I do  Maybe I should eat what I feed my pet Who attracts everything but fleas I might as well live in Tibet Oh woe woe woe is me...  Either I've got too much B.O. Or too short a life time Or they just don't like the way that I always talk in rhyme Maybe I should not come unglued 'Cause my dog gets more dates than I do  My dog gets more dates My mutt has more mates My dog gets more dates than I doooooo!  Composed by Adam Davidge and Bobby Houston ( I know it sux but i'm very lunatic at this moment)

"  Remember that girl in Kindergarten?  Alexandra?" " Yes, but i cannot remember her last name.  I am not even sure what her name is.  I had a best friend and we used to play together.  She had flaming long hair.  Alexandra had brown and curly locks.  I cannot remember the name of the girl with orange hair.  It was a beautiful name, i believe it began with an S.  I believe her name was Suzanne." "  How could you?  You made a promise to never forget them when they left the school.  You promised.  You promised.  How could you be so reckless to forget them?"

       I always find it interesting how people refer to evil and good as colours.  Evil is referred to as black or any sombre, dark colour.  Yet good is mostly referred to as a pure white snow.  I have always believed that it is always hard to be evil.  Yet, i began to realize a few things.  Firstly, I would prefer the dark rather than light.  I'm more of a dark person.  Very reserved and not many people know me very well.  They only know my one "universal" quality, meekness.  My friends asked me why i would prefer the darkness.  I will now explain.  We live in a painful world.  No one knows the truth for certain.  It is hard to say but our world isn't very beautiful.  This probably explains why half of the Earth will always be darkness, from the beginning of time to the end of eternity.  In the light, you see all of the truth but that does not mean that it's pretty.  Most truths in this world are harsh and real.  They are solid blocks.  But, in the darkness, you don't have to see the pain.  You don't see everything.  You don't know everything.  Only a small parcel of knowledge.  To know everything, to be in the light, would be horror for me.  Knowing all truths and lies in this world would drive me insane.  Even outside, in the sunlight, my eyes always seem to not be able to accept what they see.  It always seems that whenever they are in the light, they are forever searching for shelter, in the darkness.

        Love   The days now begin slow I must, I need to know What is there out there for me? Am I to live my life happily? Without knowing, what is this zeal Could it possibly be real? Is it like the sky to the dove Could that be love? A rare and pretty scene What could it possibly mean? Is it like the river to a shore? Could that be amour? Meant to be together  wherever forever? devotion, emotion, enchantment, inclination? partiality, pash, passion, piety, infatuation? A heart for one to woo Love, where are you?

He shall, oh he shall, he shall take thine blood from thy vayne!  Aye, thy blood will be spilt on the thousand plains.  Watch ye back!  Beware!  Oh, one who carries the name of Neil!

       Life has no  shape or image,  and cannot be grasped directly  by the senses. Those who have  obtained life  can tell you their  feelings,but  cannot give it to  you; you can  empty your mind to hail its arrival, but you cannot  get it from  others......

       People always refer to things such as heaven or hell.  I find this interesting.  Why would they want to talk of such?  This world itself has experienced many tragedies and joys since the beginning of Time.  This world itself is heaven and hell.  I do not believe in Paradise or Hell.  Who knows, perhaps we are here right now.  There is nothing to look forward to.  The cycle of Life.  Your soul leaves your body when you die.  It enter your body when you are born.  Thus, I quote Margaret Craven from I Heard The Owl Call My Name:  " Past the village flowed the river, like time, like life itslef, waiting for the swimmer to come again on his way to the climax of his adventurous life, and to the end for which he has been made."

       stop saying those bad words....I know how you feel.  This world sucks.  I wonder sometimes why i was put here...  1) People are sooo selfish!!!!  I screamed and fell down the escalator in a mall once.  Who came to help?  no one!  I was bleeding!  I bet if i fell down and was choking because of an allergic reaction, no one would care.  They would just walk away.  That's why i think owning things that tell emergency number and etc. are USELESS!!!  2)  Hey, I agree that humans are the most stupid things to inhabit this world.  Sooo annoying!!!!!!!!!    " Why?  Why?  Why?" blablabla Do you ****ing need to know the reason for EVERYTHING?!   3) We're inconsiderate fools.  Ever seen those ads in the paper?  " Help the Children"  " Help the environment, be good"  blablabla     Oh, right.  People say we're "helping" the children.  But which children?  The ones that are ours at the present.  Oooh!  Suuure!  We give them education, food and shelter.  What about your children's children then?  How are they supposed to get clean air and clean society?  Phhht!!!  No one gives a damn about them!!!  Pollute now, who cares?  The world's gonna blow up in a few more billion years." Worry when the time comes" blablabla....  4)  We have gone against our nature.  Sure, you hear about people talking about God and how He created us.  But, has anyone given the thought that He did not create us like this?  Whooptidoo!  It's not like He popped in some computers and factories into our lives in order for us to completely ruin the box of treasures He made?  Has anyone given the thought that He might not want us to be this way?  I'm not talking against religion or anything but...if we respect God, we should respect the treasure He made for us, shouldn't we?  Why do we keep on polluting, polluting, polluting....?  The animals are important as well.  They came to this world before us, taught us many things.  In fact, you could say that they gave birth to us.  They own this world.  How do we thank them?  Kill them, slaughter them, breed them, enslave them, capture them, and burn down their homes.  All of this because of OUR inventions.  Damn poachers are so greedy that they wouldnt be able to see the truth if it was winking at them in the face!  You know what the biggest most important and most evil invention made by us?  Money.  That's what started anything, wouldn't you say?  Say ppl never invented it, we would be more generous, caring.  No bombs, no missiles.  No wars.  Ha.  Never say that something small is useless.  Look at what a small green paper did to our society.

But that wasn't even a hump, you could make up a word for it like the limbo, but really its just your sick imagination that thought it was something discusting. Really, How was it discusting?

       [mood| depressed  ]  Why'd you have to do that, Adam?  That was the most humiliating experience of my life.  You know that I got over that but still you shouldn't make fun of me because I was _ _ _ _ed....I'm going to go bawl my eyes out now until they melt from all that salt water.  Then I'll be blind and no longer see the pain in this world.  This mutated, ugly world.  What has become of it?  Death, death it lurks in every corner.  How can there be hope in this world?  How?  There is no hope at all and we humans make up lies to cover up our faults.  We create small and pointless items to divert our attention.  Why?  Why was I born in this time?  In this era? Then again, I am young.  I have lived a thousand lives but I am still young.  I have seen a hundred tragedies, heard a hundred songs, experienced a hundred joys but I am still young.  Perhaps I have seen the world and twice through these young and inexperienced eyes.  I am still young.  I am still learning and maturing every day.  I learn.  I learn what?  School work.  What is schoolwork?  Something to help numben the pain of the world when I am old.  This is the beginning.  Already, I have experienced so many sadnesses, pains and humiliations.  If this is the beginning, I don't want to see the end.  Because.  The end is what everyone is afraid of.

       This world is made of 2 classes of homo sapiensapiens, The Fuckers and The Bitches! He (the killer) is neither, he is the satan of the satan. How do we tell the difference between the fuckers, the bitches and the other catagory from hell? We can't, all I know is any of us may kill sum innocent little person when we grow up, it might happen because we r contacted by a demon. There is no excuse for his FUCKING SHIT HEAD ASSHOLE BITCH FROM HELL actions. He should be transported to Texas by the judge where they can wipe him clear of this world, AND then he can fuck all he wants. I mean, what a pussy!!!!! He kills a little defenseless girl who can't even possibly fight back!! AAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! I just feel like taking my fucking hand and sticking it right into his body and taking out his heart while it is still beating, and then show it to his face. How would any of u like to be taken away while walking home and then be killed limb by limb while being defenseless in a dark mysterious place. BEINg taken away from everybody u love... That is my message for the day... I love/hate this world at the same time!!! There are somethings that make you want to live and somethings that make you want to die. I LOVE THEEE BY THINE FINE SMELL OF LIFE BUT AT THINE SAME TIME I HATE THEE FOR THY CRUEL MIND. Longest message i've written!!! mood : excited

       But, if this blog was somewhere where you express your feelings, mood, etc.. feelings include ranting about life too. I mean, if you want us to use this blog to write about only certain things, please tell us. If you don't want us to rant about everything that we are going through ... well, please us know. And another thing.. who really cares about the people that read this blog? Isn't this blog for ourselves.. we aren't posting on this blog to please others.. are we? I'm getting a little confused here. Please someone, enlighten me. Nikki, I hope you don't take what i just said the wrong way.. I'm not trying to be mean or blame anything on you.. because it's no ones fault, or start and argument. I'm just kind of confused. I'm "expressing my opinion".

       Someone plz post their opinions?  waaaah....i'm not good at managing this blog...the only things ppl do on this blog is either complain or write about their lifestories.  I dont think ppl want to read our blog coz its boring and only about the lives of a handful of tfsers.  Blogs are made for expressing your thoughts and opinions in the world.  Or your philosophy of life.  Most people like to read blogs like that.  In fact, i was reading a blog and it says and i quote, " Have you guys ever read the other blogs here?  I have.  We sound more like geniuses compared to those people who only complain about their lives.  I dont think there is anyone intelligent enough out there to write a DECENT blog..." I dont think you guys would like to do philosophy but why not take this chance to get to know each other's thoughts and opinions better, hm?  Now why dont you look at my opinion and tell me if you agree or not.  Opinion   What do you guys think will and should be done with Holly Jones' murderer when he/she is caught?   I personally think that this ,guys, is sick. I believe that this monster deserves nothing other than an execution. Who could possibly kill a girl like that? WHAT A COWARD!!!!! I really really hope they get an execution because:   A) they killed a child who hasn't even lived her life yet  B) it's people like them that waste the oxygen in the air and are a waste of blood and flesh in this world  C) there is no excuse for this outrage!  D) All of the Above   Answer: D)   augh! This is so stupid, though! They're probably going to put that person in jail for a year or two and set them free again. YEAH RIGHT!! As if that's gonna teach them a lesson! Blood for blood, death for a death. I believe in that for case of murders and murders only! If you're gonna put them in jail like that, why dont you just give them a stupid lollipop, pat them on the head and tell them they did nothing wrong.

        Opinion   What do you guys think will and should be done with Holly Jones' murderer when he/she is caught?    I personally think that this ,guys, is sick.  I believe that this monster deserves nothing other than an execution.  Who could possibly kill a girl like that?  WHAT A  COWARD !!!!!  I really really hope they get an execution because:  A) they killed a child who hasn't even lived her life yet B) it's people like them that waste the oxygen in the air and are a waste of blood and flesh in this world C) there is no excuse for this outrage! D) All of the Above  Answer: D)  augh!  This is so stupid, though!  They're probably going to put that person in jail for a year or two and set them free again.  YEAH RIGHT!!  As if that's gonna teach them a lesson!  Blood for blood, death for a death.   I believe in that for case of murders and murders only!  If you're gonna put them in jail like that, why dont you just give them a stupid lollipop, pat them on the head and tell them they did nothing wrong.

        You cannot understand me, you'll never understand me   If you love me, hate me.  If you cure me, hurt me.  If you pity me, ignore me.  Every word is like a sugar-coated dagger.  Piercing my flesh until the red tears flow out.  Every smile is like a colourful arrow.  Slicing away until I surrender.  Feeling is unknown, the unknown is feeling.  My eyes, my eyes.  So full with sadness.  My eyes, my eyes.  Scratch them out!  How can I stand to see this pain?  This pain.  This pain.  I give up before I start.  Why did you do this to me?  I am terrified of rejection and afraid of love and hate.  If that he love me true, how will I be happy?  Always, forever.  Lost will it be.  To but shrink away into the shadows?  A mind so blank of no thought.  Result, result!  You have done this to me!  If you pity me, you are killing me!

       [mood| depressed  ]  I'm depressed because of yesterday.  I always seem to cry at bat/bar mitzvahs.  Marc-Adam's is the only one that i havent cried at.  I am extremely tired today and can barely see properly.  Everytime i blink, tears blur my vision.   The party starts, I dread.  The music begins, i am swallowed by sadness.  I look through the glass and see all those lights and bodies moving, i cry.  My eyes well up with tears faster than realization.  Fat drops of water roll down my cheeks as I bite my lip and hide.  Oh, it hurts.  Whenever the music plays, my heart throbs with pain.  Both yearning and dreading with a mingling scent of regret.

       My comp broke down and i'm using my cousin's...I'm really pissed off..I wrote a super long paragraph of what i wanted to say when stupid blogger deleted it.  I HATE BLOGGER!!! DIE DIE DIE!!!!!! Like i SHOULD HAVE SAID, i noticed you guys were saying how this blog is boring and empty.  THAT'S BECAUSE I'M NOT HERE!!! Okay, going to do this in point form of what i was going to say before BLOGGER THE IDIOTIC AND CRAPPY SERVICE WEBSITE delted what i was going to say:  -been watching lots of anime, working on my story and ogling at F4 -Miss the internet...i wanna go on the blog and see the new Naruto releases!!!:'( -I love prince of tennis!  LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT -Tzai Tzai's sooooo shuai!!!  *siiiigh* -i cant fit in all my stuff into one bag for EDPHY -why are u happy about someone stealing ur car?  I was robbed once when i was 5.  The bastard took my music box, ring and pearl earrigns my mom passed on to me ( you're lucky i shortened this,  Before i put a long and descriptively gorya nd violent scen of what i would do to this guy but i'll shorten it.  I'll snap all his bones, twist his limbs and dislocate them.  I will cut open his hands and legs and fill them with rubbing alcohol and salt.  i will stuff his mouth with spiders and make him starve by putting a tantalizing meal in front of him that just a LITTLE bit out of reach.  To finish, i will kick him in the ouch area until he keels over in pain, bleeds from his mouth and kisses the moon.) -My comp wont be fixed for quite a while. - My mom called our school stupid and idiotic for making us wear first dress to EDPHY,  I will not quote as i did before for it is too long.

       Adam, you got the song wrong and you mispelled everything...it's  On the first part of the journey I was looking at all the life There were plants and birds and rocks and things There was sand and hills and rings The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz And the sky with no clouds The heat was hot and the ground was dry But the air was full of sound  I've been through the desert on a horse with no name It felt good to be out of the rain In the desert you can remember your name 'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  After two days in the desert sun my skin began to turn red After three days in the desert fun I was looking at a river bed And the story it told of a river that flowed Made me sad to think it was dead  You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name It felt good to be out of the rain In the desert you can remember your name 'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  After nine days I let the horse run free 'cause the desert had turned to sea There were plants and birds and rocks and things There was sand and hills and rings The ocean is a desert with it's life underground And a perfect disguise above Under the cities lies a heart made of ground But the humans will give no love  You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name It felt good to be out of the rain In the desert you can remember your name 'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

        My rambling thoughts   hmm...maybe this world...is heaven and hell itself.  Living together but living separate lives.Or, maybe this is all a dream and Death is when one awakens.  So far, my life has been going wrong with barely any highlights.  Maybe it's to pay back for something i've done in my previous life.  I wonder who i was...a philosopher? No.  I might have been something totally different than what i am right now.    Time flies quickly when you're having fun?  Does that imply that life itself is a game?    What are accomplishments?  Is it the stuff that lasts for only a while such as publishing a book at the age of 9?  Or, is it the lesson learned through loving which continues on forever?  Is it really the point to know everything?  No human can learn everything..why?  Because we are mortal.. If i was immortal i would know a lot of things but not everything..  After all..what is knowledge?  Academic knowledge such as mathematics, languages, History and geography can be learned anytime.  But.  No one can ever LEARN common sense and logic.  Take some time to think about it.  Life is such a puzzling and complex maze.  It seems that we are the mice trying to find our way out, desperately rushing through though the key is to stop and try over and over again.  Life is a beautiful road.  Do not rush past for you might never see it again.  Stay to breathe in the air, taste the sun and smell the life.

       There are bugs all over my house!!!!!  Yaaaaaaaaaaaah!  I have a phobia of bugs!!!!  I'm so lame.  I'm perched on top of the table and screaming because of a centipede on the floor.  Or is it a millipede?  i dont mind flies, mosquitoes and spiders.  I freaked out about them too much at camp and got rid of my phobia there.  but i DETEST centipedes.  *shiver*  My friend's aunt has a p-pet hedgehog and it was my job to feed it LIVE millipedes and centipedes.  My friend held the hedgehog in a blanket to stop it from inserting spikes all over the place.  So i was standing with an open cup of wriggling bugs trying to escape over the top.  I was terrified.  The light bounced off their bodies as if they were covered in slime and the way they moved just made me shudder.  They were orange and red and furious.  They were attacking each other and trying to climb out of the cup.  I slammed the cup on the floor and backed away.  I looked at the hedgehog, my friend, the centipedes/millipedes, and the pincers in my hand.  I slowly picked up one of the wriggling bugs with the pincers.  It writhed violently and dropped to the ground.  I shut my eyes and could hear it scuttling across the floor.  I jabbed the pincers through its body and fed it to the hedgehog who snapped the bug's body in half.  I was disgusted.  Though the bug's entrails were sliding to the ground with a dull plop, the body kept on moving.  The hedgehog snorted as it swallowed a white tendril of intestine hanging out from the body.  I picked up the second victim/bug quickly.  I had to feed the hedgehog 5 centipedes.  The worst part was that the hedgehog was very selective about it's food.  As soon as i put the second bug in front of its nose, it let out a huge burp/sneeze/snort which blew the centipede across the room.  The bug fell splat into a small box which were the hedgehog's living quarters.  After hours of wrestling with the bug in the wood shavings, i fed it to the hedgehog who, again, snorted the bug away.  I was lucky that i had moved away right after i had dropped the bug onto the hedgehog's belly.  The bug fell on the floor where my leg had been a minute before.  I handed the pincers to my friend and ran into the washroom.  After a few minutes of retching, i decided that though hedgehogs were cute i would never feed one again for the rest of my life.  It was a terrifying but good experience and i know that i am not the kind of person who can touch bugs.  I was really stupid to think that i could feed the hedgehog.   Which ends my story about my fear of centipedes.  I hope never to have to see a writhing and half eaten body of a centipede anymore.  When i found that centipede in my bathtub, i drowned it quickly with burning water. until it fell down the drain.  I never want to see squashed centipede insides anymore.

Your passions are mainly music and anime and you've probably dyed your hair some odd color of the rainbrow. And if you haven't, you probably will. You often feel like you are misunderstood, but don't worry. Just think about thongs. Very funny.    urlLink   What Asian Girl Are You?     VISIT  urlLink HTTP://JEALOUSY.TK

       From sun to moon From birth to death A man's life soon awakens As another one's soon meets death But fret not for life is short yet sweet For death shall not come until your time is ready And when this happens happiness shall ensue When you encounter your loved ones who have died much like yourself I shall now stop talking But remember one thing Give peace to the resting death. THIS HAS BEEN QUOTED BY MATTHEW BOURKAS DURING THE TIME WHN HE WAS WASTED BECAUSE OF A SUGAR HIGH YAAY haaaaaapy  Lighten your fork with pork PIMPTOS the Pimp maker

       Aaaww...this is soooooo cute...   Love 4.0 from Heart Systems Software Company    Customer Service Rep: Hello, you have reached the Heart Systems Software Company help desk. How may I help you?  Customer: I just received your latest program, LOVE 4.0...you know...the freeware.  I don't understand it.  Can tell me how to install it?  CS Rep: Sure thing ma'am.  Do you have the installation disk and instructions with you?  Customer: Yes I do, but first can you tell me what the program does?  CS Rep: Sure thing ma'am.  LOVE is a unique program, there is no other like it in the world.  LOVE attaches to your operating system and runs silently in the background, you will never see LOVE on your monitor or your toolbar, but you will notice its affect on every application you may have. It makes the good programs run smoother and greatly restricts and/or deletes the bad ones.  Customer: Wow!  That sounds great.  How does LOVE make my machine run smoother?  CS Rep: Well, good sound files, like COMPLIMENT.WAV, ENCOURAGEMENT.WAV, and KINDWORD.WAV will play frequently.  Also, FORGIVENESS.EXE will be invoked every time there is an external violation, including the ever-popular syntax errors.  Also, all those aggravating errors that say "unable to connect" will be avoided. LOVE allows for a smooth connection with external devices, regardless of what country it is manufactured in, the brand name, or the age of the model.  Customer: That's exactly what I need, my machine has been isolated for too long. But what about the bad programs?  CS Rep: Good question.  LOVE searches your memory for programs like HATE.COM, BITTERNESS.EXE, SELFISH.COM, and SPITE.EXE. These programs can't be entirely deleted off your hard drive, but LOVE overpowers those programs.  LOVE stops their commands from being executed and runs its own instructions.  You will no longer hear INSULT.WAV and you wont be able to write with the fonts "BADWORDS12" or "HARSHNESS10."  Customer: That's a fantastic program you have.  Are the upgrades free too?  CS Rep: They sure are ma'am.  Customer: How do I get the upgrades?  CS Rep: That's easy.  Once you have LOVE installed and running, it automatically copies a module, or a piece of itself, to every external Hard drive Email And Remote Terminal (HEART) that it comes in contact with. In turn, those external devices run whatever version of LOVE they have and return a module to your HEART.  You will be upgraded with each and every module that you receive.  But you have to remember, to receive the upgrades you have to be running LOVE and you have to come into contact with other computers while it is running.  Customer: I can do that.  I'm not very technical, but I think I am ready to install now.  What do I do first?  CS Rep: The first step is to open your HEART.  Have you located your HEART  ma'am?  Customer: Yes I have, but there are several programs running right now. Is it okay to install while they are running?  CS Rep: What programs are running ma'am?  Customer: Let me see....I have PASTHURT.EXE, LOWESTEEM.EXE, GRUDGE.EXE, and RESENTMENT.COM running right now.  CS Rep: No problem.  LOVE will automatically erase PASTHURT.EXE from your current operating system.  It may remain in your permanent memory, but it will no longer disrupt other programs.  LOVE will eventually overwrite LOWESTEEM.EXE with a module of its own called HIGHESTEEM.EXE.  However, you have to completely turn off GRUDGE.EXE and RESENTMENT.COM.  Those programs prevent LOVE from being properly installed.  Can you turn those off ma'am?  Customer: I don't know how to turn them off.  Can you tell me how?  CS Rep: My pleasure.  Go to your Start menu and invoke FORGIVENESS.EXE. Do this as many times as necessary until GRUDGE.EXE and RESENTMENT.COM have been completely erased.  Customer: Okay, I'm done.  LOVE has started installing itself automatically. Is that normal?  CS Rep: Yes it is.  You should receive a message that says it will reinstall for the life of your HEART.  Do you see that message?  Customer: Yes I do.  Is it completely installed?  CS Rep: Yes, but remember that you have only the base program. You need to begin connecting to other HEART's in order to get the upgrades.  Customer:  Oops...I have an error message already.  What should I do?  CS Rep: What does the message say?  Customer: It says "ERROR 412 - PROGRAM NOT RUN ON INTERNAL COMPONENTS." What does that mean?  CS Rep: Don't worry ma'am, that's a common problem.  It means that the LOVE program is set up to run on external HEARTS but has not yet been run on your HEART.  It is one of those complicated programming things but In nontechnical terms it means you have to "LOVE" your own machine before it can "LOVE" others.  Customer: So what should I do?  CS Rep: Can you find the directory called "SELF-ACCEPTANCE"?  Customer: Yes, I have it.  CS Rep: Excellent, you are getting good at this.  Customer: Thank you.  Rep: You're welcome.  Click on the following files and then copy them to the "MYHEART" directory: FORGIVESELF.DOC, SELFESTEEM.TXT, REALIZEWORTH.TXT, and GOODNESS.DOC.  The system will overwrite any conflicting files and begin patching any faulty programming programming.  Also, you need to delete SELFCRITIC.EXE from all directories, and then empty your recycle bin afterwards to make sure it is completely gone and never comes back.  Customer: Got it.  Hey!  My HEART is filling up with really neat files.  SMILE.MPG is playing on my monitor right now and it shows that WARMTH.COM, PEACE.EXE, and CONTENTMENT.COM are copying themselves all over my HEART!  CS Rep: Then LOVE is installed and running.  You should be able to handle it from here One more thing before I go...  Customer: Yes?  CS Rep: LOVE is freeware.  Be sure to give it and its various modules to everybody you meet.  They will in turn share it with other people and they will return some really neat modules back to you.  Customer: I will.  Thank you for your help.

       I started playing FF9 again.  The Final Fantasy series are my favorite video games so far.  Harvest moon's not bad either.  I still haven' t tried the new Naruto game yet....it's not even out yet! oooh....I like Final Fantasy 7 and 9 the most.  I dont like 8 that much but the graphics are great.  Rhinoa is an interesting character too.  Squall is mute or something.  Squall scares me.  I wont be surprised if i dont scare anyone by talking about video games.  It seems like no one plays Final Fantasy at TFS.  What a shame.  I can't wait for 11 to come out.  I totally screwed up my new game in FF9.  I'm not that much of a perfectionist as the first time i played it.  The first time i played it i delivered every Mognet letter, Stallazzio and collected all the cards.  This time i botched the delivery.  I missed the first letter of Mognet, meaning that i can NEVER go to Mognet central and i forgot to pick up Stallazzios.  My game will be a failure.  I dont think Garnet's that pretty.  She looks ok.  Why do all the characters in the game make such a big deal about how she looks?  Are all characters shallow?  Maybe beauty is different for characters.  i think Vivi and the Mogs look so cute (especially Artemicion, the purple and vain Mognet mailmog.)None of the characters think they're cute.  I'll stop talking.  This is the last post 4 today.  Promise..

       :'(  I wasted my money buying books again.....Why cant i be like Shakespeare and scribble down a poem and sell it quickly?  waaaaaah!  Life's not faaaaiiir!  Back to scrubbing dishes for money again....I wish i had allowance but i have to do household chores for it.  Ugh.  Maybe i'll try to melt open my plastic piggy bank.  Oooh!  i just found two old piggy banks i used to use!  One is diguised as a stuffed animal and another i got from this scary kid from junior kindergarten who treatened to blow up my house ( Antoine...I'm not sure if Dana still remembers who he is.  I hope not.  She'd be laughing like crazy if she remembers...).  I wonder where Antoine lives now...  He always had this spitting problem i hated.  Whenever he talked, i would be sprayed by buckets of saliva.  Anyhow, now to pop them open......[suspense].......dadadadaaaaa.......damn...just a few pennies, nickles and dimes....and a two dollar bill....and......about 5 handful of bronze coins...with holes in them.....and they are from Hong Kong....How the heck did THEY get in there?  I never went to Hong Kong.  Maybe when i was a kid my dad gave them to me to make me feel like i had money.  Dang it.....

       uh oh.......I have tennis for three hours everday day, one hour of rest then swimming for one hour.  I think i'm going to faint from exhaustion in the pool.  I feel like some dumbass.   I mix up my front crawl and back crawl and i suck at swimming.  Somehow i ended up in a swimming school.  It's more like boot camp.  I imagine the instructors/sergeants barking orders from the side of the pool.  I started reading the coffin dance by Jeffrey Deaver again.  Excellent mystery i tell you.  The perp (perpetrator) has this strange habit.  He's schizophrenic and a hitman.  He imagines this general in his head telling him to immobilize his targets and so and so.  He also imagines worms crawling all over him.  Soldier, are you good to swim?  Sir, yes, sir!  What are your qualifications, soldier?  Sir, I eat healthy, take no drugs or smoking whatsoever, sir!  Then get in that pool, soldier, and swim like you never have before!  Sir, yes, sir!

       Why is everyone naivete?  i'm Hope.  Does this mean i'm some kind of freak?  I should've gotten Apathy or Loneliness.  Oh well, at least my person doesnt look childish.  She has purple hair which matches my other test results.  "  You tend to dye your hair in all colours of the rainbow".  But then again it might be her "natural" hair color. When you see a lot of animes, people have strange natural hair colours.  Purple for one ( Shampoo from Ranma).  White too for young people ( Kakashi from Naruto and a kid from Hunter X Hunter).  Some have green like that alien from Mars in Urusei Yatsura ( I never liked that series too much.  Ranma is soo much better)

       Just watched Phone Booth.  Although it was with my one and only Collin Farrell, it wasn't one of the best movies I have seen.  It was okay.  The whole movie was shot in a phone booth though and Collin was in the booth so, luckily for every girl that is obsessed with him (so unlike me), 98% of the movie showed Collin.

I still don't know who they are but i still enjoy that song.  Here are the lyrics:  .:ChErRy CrUsH:.  EVERY SECOND, EVERY HOUR, AND MINUTE OF THE DAY I GET THIS CRAZY HAZY FEELING, THAT I CAN'T EXPLAIN SOMETHIN' 'BOUT THE WAY YOU TALK, THE WAY YOU SMILE, THE WAY YOU MOVE DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I TRY, MY THOUGHTS KEEP COMING BACK TO YOU  YOUR LOVE IS TAKING OVER TAKING CONTROL OF ME  AND I DON'T WANNA LOSE THE FEELING YOUR CHERRY CRUSH, CRUSHIN' ALL OVER ME  KISSES RUSH, MY CHERRY CRUSH YOUR LOVE IS ALL I NEED NEVER GET ENOUGH, MY CHERRY CRUSH LIKE COMIN' ON TO ME INSTANT TOUCH, MY CHERRY CRUSH YOUR LOVE INSPIRES ME GIVE ME SUCH A RUSH, MY CHERRY CRUSH YOUR LOVE IS ALL I NEED  INTOXICATIN', MOTIVATIN', MAKE ME LOSE MY MIND NEVER BE A ONE TIME THING, 'CUZ BOY I WANT YOU ALL THE TIME THE WAY I FEEL WHEN I'M ALONE UP IN MY ROOM AT NIGHT I WISH I SLEPT OUT OF MY DREAMS AND YOU COULD HOLD ME TIGHT  YOUR LOVE IS TAKING OVER (IS TAKING OVER ME) TAKING CONTROL OF ME (TAKING CONTROL) AND I DON'T WANNA LOSE THE FEELING (DON'T LOSE THAT FEELING) YOUR CHERRY CRUSH, CRUSHIN' ALL OVER ME  KISSES RUSH, MY CHERRY CRUSH YOUR LOVE IS ALL I NEED NEVER GET ENOUGH, MY CHERRY CCRUSH LIKE COMIN' ON TO ME INSTANT TOUCH, MY CHERRY CRUSH YOUR LOVE INSPIRES ME GIVE ME SUCH A RUSH, MY CHERRY CRUSH YOUR LOVE IS ALL I NEED  KISSES RUSH, MY CHERRY CRUSH YOUR LOVE IS ALL I NEED NEVER GET ENOUGH, MY CHERRY CCRUSH LIKE COMIN' ON TO ME INSTANT TOUCH, MY CHERRY CRUSH YOUR LOVE INSPIRES ME GIVE ME SUCH A RUSH, MY CHERRY CRUSH YOUR LOVE IS ALL I NEED  SWEET, SWEET, SWEET - REPEAT 5X  FADE OUT

       This is a song that I have just come to love from a movie that is sort of like the beatles style, It is called "that thing you do":  You Doing that thing you do Bringing my heart into a million pieces Like you always do And you Don't need to be cruel Never even knew about the heartaches I've been going threw And I try and try to forget you girl But its just so hard to do Every time you do that thing you do  I Know all games you play And i'm gonna to find a way to let you know that You'll be mine some day Cause we Can be happy can't you see If you'd only let me be the one to hold you And keep you here with me And I try and try to forget you girl But its just so hard to do Every time you do that thing you do  I don't ask around girl No one thinks for sure But you know i haven't got girl And i just can't take it Anymore  Cause we Can be happy can't you see If you'd only let me be the one to hold you And keep you here with me Cause it hurts me so just to see you girl Around with someone knew And if i know you your doing that thing And Every day just doing that thing And i can't take you doing that thing you do

       Have you ever gone walkin' in the street In the cold, in the burning heat? Have you ever seen true and pure grief? Have you ever felt the joy of relief? I'm blind but i see faces, i see faces Of all colours, types and of all races  Whenever i take a walk in a mall or maybe a stroll down the street.  I see faces.  I am blind but i see faces.  and, though i am blind this i do know.  Each face has a story untold.  Each face, a legend to mold.  Everyone has secrets and everyone has lies.  I wish i could just see them as their true selves and ask:  " What is  your  story?"

       Well, all of you are freakin crazy, Nikki, if that "mystery girl" calls you again, hunt her down and kill her, smash her little head off, not only will that method let you sleep, it also releaves stress. If you don't have the nerves to do that, give me a call and i'll take care of her for you. I cant stop watching a film directed by tom hanks with him in the movie called,"That Thing you do". I thinks its amazing. It probably won't interest you very much but i luv it. " Table 19, your pizza's ready!" hahahahahaha! IM hyper. camp so close i can feel it. Good bye youngins! hahahahahaha

       I know this sounds crazy but i cant wait for school to start.  I cant wait to hit the books and turn over a new leaf.  This year i refuse to daydream in class and make stupid mistakes again.  I will concentrate to the very end.  I want to outdo myself completely and get even better marks.  I cant afford to make mistakes and play around too much.

       I know.  Some stupid girl keeps on calling my cell phone at ungodly hours such as 3 am of 5 am.  She thinks i'm her girl pal.  Something like my cell phone used to be her best pal's old phone.  She leaves me puzzled. This is an example of what she makes conversation with me:  Mystery Girl supposedly female age 14-17: Oh God, Tessa, why aren't you there?  I need you to call me *sniffle*.  Andy's been acting weird and...Oh god.....*blows nose*....I need you to call me....What if he dumps me, Tessa?  Do you think he thinks i'm.....ugly? *sniffle*  Oh Jeez...Everyone's saying i'm too clingy.  He probably think i'm too faaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!!!!!! *bursts out in tears* I think he's going to dump me, Tess.  He hasn't called me for 2 days.  Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!!!  I really need your comfort. *whimper*  Me: *groggily*  It's 4 am.  Why did you call me?  Mystery Girl: Is this Tessa?  Me:  No...  Mystery Girl: Put Tessa on.  Me: This is my cell phone.  I don't know Tessa. You must have the wrong number. I have a tip for you.  Don't be so clingy about this Andy guy whatever.  Also, don't call your friend at this time.  She might be sleeping unless she lives on the other side of the world and if so, you should call her home number.  Goodnight.  Next few nights she called me a few more times before she got the message.  Ugh.

       I'm tired.  I'm so tired i cant walk down the stairs properly.  I sway side to side like a drunkard while attempting to walk.  I'm so tired that i cant keep my eyes open because i have no strength to.  They are all slitty right now.   I'm so tired i floated lifelessly around the pool during my backstroke and i drank at least an eighth of the pool.  YAWN!  Gonna go take a nappy-nap.  Oh, wait.  I cant.  I ate dumplings meaning i cant sleep till i digest it fully otherwise i'll get fat.  *starts poking stomach* The reason why i'm saying weird things like nappy-nap and myummy and hungwy is because i dont want to be ordinary!  NEVER!  NEVER, SAYS I!  TAKE THAT ADAM!  MUAHAHAAAHHAHAHAHHAHAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

       Kate walked down the white street.  The soft white flakes of snow fell like angel dust from the sky.  Snow crystals fell on her face as she lifted it up to the heavens.  It had been one week since she lost her voice.  Tears stinged the back of her eyes as she recalled the times she had spent alone in a prairie near her home, singing her heart out and telling the world how she felt.  Music had been like oxygen to her.  She could never live without it.  When she sang, everything else was of no importance.  She let her heart choose notes and words as she wove a story with her tongue.  Her voice soared to the highest notes effortlessly.  She had been so happy.  That little prairie was her world.  She whimpered lightly as she pulled the coat tighter around her body.  Shivering, she wiped her eyes with the back of her hand.  She felt something wet.  Was it melted snow or tears?  She did not care.  She sat down on a bench.  Daemon would be here soon.  She could not afford to let him see her like this.  They had been best friends since grade one.  She smiled as she remembered how they had met.  She was ready.

Make sure you save the world and clean away all that oil, squalor and filth that are attempting to choke out the lives of our dear penguin, fish and fellow residents of our sweet mother Earth.  Do your job with pride.  I-  WHY AM I TALKING TO MY HAIR?!  HAVE I GROWN SO ATTACHED TO IT THAT...?  AUGH!!!!!!

       I really want shorter hair though.  It's troublesome having long hair.  I have to tie it up all the time, brush out the tangles every morning, take an hour to dry it after washing.....etc I think it would be better to have short hair.  All who agree say "Aye" (or I or eye)

       Week after week of swimming has finally piled up on my hair.  It's stringy, dry and has no more shine (eeyurk!).  In truth, it's disgusting to touch.  I cringe to touch or brush it.   Therefore,  I have made the decision to finally get rid of this burden, my long hair.  I've been thinking that i should cut it above my shoulder and donate the hair to...whatsitcalled?  Some place where they use human hair to soak up the bad oil spills in the ocean.  Yes, i like that.  Saving the world while getting a haircut.  So, hair above the shoulder.  I'm still hesitating to cut my hair though.  Will i look like an idiot with short hair?  I was thinking about cutting it the same as Erene's.....

       Nicole, you have to start telling your mom that you hate swimming anfd stick up for yourself.You can't always go along with what your mom says.  Maybe at first you shuldnt right away burst out at your mom an say you dont want to. Slowly and gradually tell her that you just dont like swimming.  Simple as that.

       Someone kill me.....i cant take all this stress anymore....i NEVER want to swim again.  Ugh.  The master instructor (ruler of smaller instructors who actually teach) is friends with my mom and i used to swim with him as a teacher.   He thought i was swimming pretty good today and handed my mother a sign up sheet for competitive swimming.  Never, Never, NEVER will i swim again.  I've had my fill of chlorine water going up my nose as i do front crawl (hate it , hate it, hate it!)......Now i have to do two hours of nonstop training every Friday for the year!  :'( Kill me......please.......

         My b-day is coming in 2 more days!  I'm going to be 13!  I wonder if anyone will remember...  My cousin's going to take me out on Sunday to see Finding Nemo as a present!  Yippee!  I do admit i dont want to grow up.  I just get the feeling i want to stay 12 forever.  I don't want to become a teenager...I just don't think i'm ready for that kind of responsibility.  I have lived for such a short time but i now have so many memories and some of the things i do seem so big for me.  When i'm older, i'll have more memories and bigger responsibilities.  I have had the chance to live to this point and see how the world works.  How fairy tales don't just come from daydreaming.  Each year brings a fruitful crop of memories.  Farewell, child.  Will my thoughts be different when i am older?  I dont know.  That's why i want to record them as soon as possible......      Happy Birthday   Happy Birthday to me..... Happy Birthday to me..... Happy Birthday to meeee..... Happy Birthday to me.....

Because that actually looks real.

       I believe mosquitoes shold die.  Also, i found out what that huge bite on my elbow was.  It was a spider bite.  I'm guessing there was a spider in the room and it crawled on my elbow while i was sleeping.  I must have moved in my sleep which explains why it bit me.  I could see white bite marks in the middle of the bump.  After it bit me, i'm guessing it had a tiny bit of harmless venom in it or it was really dirty, the area around the bite began to swell and redden.  That would explain the burning sensation of the bite spreading.  Damn that spider.  Spider bites really hurt!

       She's an artist of sorts,  With her brushes and paints. But she doesn't use canvas, It's opinion she taints.  Around certain "friends" She paints on a grin, So she can be popular, So she can fit in.  With other friends, She's loud and obscene. It's the aim of the game, To be rowdy and mean.  Close to her family, She's quiet and shy. They hardly take notice If she is nearby.  When she's with the guys, She's a tease and a flirt. She gives and she gives, Ignoring the hurt.  The people nearby her, They hope and they pray That they can be popular, Like her one day.  But when she's alone, She breaks down and cries. For there is no answer, When she asks, "Who am I?"                                                                                   Sara Guilliam

       I'd give the gift to the orphan child.  I'd never never never think of taking it.  If the child starts crying i'd take it but buy something for them later.  If possible, treat them to a decent lunch.

       giving to ppl is generous, but then, if you receive a gift from am orphan child for your generous donation, would you not accept the present because he needs it more and hurt his feelings or go and take it. Would you go for feelings or plain kmowledge, nicole, your insight?

       Life is like running barefoot in grass.  It's little things put together that make it feel so good.  Life is like opening a present.  It's the feeling of mystery that makes it so interesting.   Every single journey starts with a single step. Life has its ups and downs.  Your look on life depends on whether you remember happy memories or sad ones.

       I want to see Finding Nemo but my brother is running some sort of anti-Disney club with himself as president.  He has only one member, himself.  I hate when Disney changes fairy tales to suit children's wants (example:  Little Mermaid is supposed to die at the end of the story.   Witch does not die.  She does not marry the prince.  She does not wear seashells.  The witch does not try to marry the prince and steal the little mermaid's voice.  Also, Hades is not evil.  He is the God of Death but he is definitely not supposed to be evil.  He pitied Persephone's mother.  Also, he's  not blue with a firy head of hair.)  Quote Derek: "  The Disney-hating sister i knew is gone.  GONE, says I.  She's dead to me now!  Waaaaaah....!  How could you want to see finding Nemo?  Anything made by Disney sux!   I cant believe your friends watch Finding Nemo!!!  What kind of species ARE you?"

I have looked for the past month for the Shawshank Redemption.Its never there.  The people who worked there said it is due back on the 28th..I will watch that movie...Oh yes...I will *puts on evil grin* As Mr. Burns would say, "Excellent."

       White Oleander??? I went to see Pirates of the Caribbean.  It was really good.  It's the kind i can watch over and over again and never get bored with.  I also saw T3.  It was pretty good too except for the fact that some inconsiderate a**hole spilled coke all over my seat and drenched my new sneakers and pants.  I left with my dignity in shambles, a loser sign tattooed on my head and my last parcel of self respect splattered amongst pop.  I will never drink coke again.  Damn that stupid, clumsy, blithering, idiotic, inconsiderate, selfish, damned, klutzy, boggle-eyed, dung-eating, low, butterfingered, coke-drinking, shame-inducing KNAVE!!!!

Who made that one?" (or something like that). And then i was like, "umm.. i did." So then, no one ate my sushi. They were all too scared. lol.

I made sweet tofu stuffed with rice and dried tofu, "crab" wrapped with seaweed on top of wasabi spread rice balls, egg roll, cucumber roll, dried tofu and cucumber and dried fish and veggies and egg and some yellow vegetable i do not know rolls.  I put too much wasabi with the cucumber and one of the other rolls wouldnt stop unwrapping.  Well then...guess it's back to the Easy Bake oven for me...yes...cookies the size of loonies and cakes as flat as paper the size of a cd.....

       I was at my friend's watching Pasions...my favourite Soap Opera when suddenly..*poof* went the tv.  It was kinda funny actually...Cuz she bought a lazer and we amused ourselves by pointing it in her brother's eye..Good times, good times.  It wasnt that bad...I sat with my sister and mom eating ice-cream..Are freezer wasnt working but it was still cold for like 3 hours..And at this shopping thing near us it was by 1 ice-cream get 1 free (because of the power outage) Me and Ruth were also playing cards...It was real fun..I really fiind the best in everything..literally.....I suprise myself sometimes.

       FINALLY!  ELECTRICITY!  Oh, i've taken you for granted!  My house was like an oven and i had to eat hot dog buns all day since the fridge didnt work and we couldnt open the garage.  Oh, how pathetic we humans are without electricity!  We depend on everything we create and forget our own purpose.  We forget the language of the forest and tongue of true inhabitants of Earth.  We perfect Mother Nature as much as possible when we should stop and listen.  We should stand and embrace the imperfections that surround us.

I swear its true! I no lie. They have this great house...And they live on the water so they have a boat and a jetski..I never went on it though..I went on the boat once a long time ago..It was mucho fun.2nd of all...we went to Manhattan..OoOhh pretty lights..We went to Times Square..Planet Hollywood..I've always wanted to go there..Now I did....Its a great place...Although it was great fun..I still complain about my flight. Behold:  Our flight was delayed..It was supposed to be at 7:55p.m then it was moved to 8:45..So we boarded on the plane and literally 2 hours later...We took off..We had to take off that late just because of th stupid..Screw weather..

       "I'm back! back in the new york groove!" "I'm, TNT, i'm dynamite, TNT..." I am back, fellow friends. I am now obsessed with acdc songs because they played it all the time at camp. No, the blackout did not affect minden because of camp magic. I got my Bronze star in swimming and level 1 in widsurfing, level 4 in archery and more. I am now obsessed with making hemp bracelets. Camp is magical.The unecessary swearing, the throwing of knives... I came back yesterday. and i find out i have something to go to tonight and a wedding to go to tomorrow night. But hey, an extra week off of school. bye for now

I have...Mrs.Grimsley for English..That is also a good thing because my sister had her for English and she is supposed to be nice...Or at least just not mean.  M. Masson for H/G...He's supposed to be a French version as Mr. Aimers..Not as mean but doesnt giveout prizes..It's fair trade.  Hey..I just noticed..I have Mrs. Markle for Guidance.  Then I have some weirdo teachers that I never heard of.   O yeah..Ms. Stewart is supposed to be like the nicest art teacher ever..Total opposite of Mme Daniwe..M. Tacq is supposed to smell like B.O a lot.  Reminds me of the leprachaun like..M. Sohier.

       Hello, you've reached Arnold's pizza shop. I'm not here now. I'm out killing pepperoni. If you want to reach me, if you want a pizza, I don’t care cause I'm not here. Can’t you realize that you idiot? But if you need a pizza sometime during the next few days I can have it delivered to you or maybe I will staple it to you. I don’t care what you want on it. Everything comes with pepperoni and with 9mm bullets on it. If you don’t like it, I don’t care cause you will receive one anyhow. The only difference is maybe the 9mm bullet will be in a gun or maybe they will be on your pizza. If you don’t screw around I’ll give you good pizza, if you do screw around I’ll take a pepperoni and punch it through your head. So if you want mushroom, shut up. If you want broccoli, what the hell is broccoli anyways. Shut up with the broccoli. If you want something crazy like pineapple I’ll kill you. If you like pepperoni and bullets you've come to the right place. If not you're an idiot you deserve to die. So, leave your name, number, serial number, how tall you are, whether you are susceptible to any diseases, and if you are I’ll come over and either give you a pizza or maybe ill break off your arm.

       Hurrah!  Fruits Basket forever!     Yuki Souma-->  Everyone loves him at school because he's practically good at everything.  There's even a Yuki Prince fan club.  He turns into a mouse when hugged by girls.  He's the guy with silver hair.  He is extremely kind but seems to keep most of his feelings to himself.  When Tohru shows up, she manages to soften his heart with her kindness and he becomes less afraid of people.  Kyo--> The guy with orange hair.  He's bad tempered and absolutely hates Yuki (they're rivals).  Somehow, he always gets his butt kicked by Yuki.  He turns into a cat when hugged.  He gradually learns how to be more caring and how to interact with people.  Tohru Honda--> She's the girl in the middle.  She's really nice but kind of stupid and clueless.  She thinks everyone is a good person.  She usually runs into walls and falls down the stairs because she's absent- minded.  She really cares about Yuki and Kyo.  I really adore this anime.  It was really cute and had extremely interesting characters that intrigued me.  The story is about a girl named Tohru Honda who has recently lost her mother in a car accident and is living by herself in a tent.  She unknowingly set up her tent right in the middle of Souma property.  As soon as the Souma Family finds out, they invite her to live in their house with them.  Suddenly, Tohru discovers the Souma family's biggest secret.  When hugged by the opposite sex, they turn into chinese zodiac animals.  Tohru now lives with the family but if she ever tells the secret or someone else finds out, she might have her memory erased.

       Hi,ppl!  I'm not going to go on msn that often anymore because....I need to cut down and study for school!  See y'all!  BTW, I saw Spongebob Squarepants!  Squidward makes me laugh so hard when he laughs because his nose shrinks and deflates all the time (don't worry, Fruitcake, it's not you, it's a character from Spongebob Squarepants so stop telling everyone i have your picture in my folder.  lol.  I'm not obsessed!!!!) Did anyone know that Squidward has a brother/rival named Squilliam?  They look the same except Squilliam has a black, thick unibrow....

Kelso reminds me of Adam...Fez...Well...I dont really know who Fez reminds me of..Donna reminds me of...Jenny...Jackie reminds me of Melina or Leah though.

       Something really disgusted me yesterday while watching the news. Some teenager who was 16 was beat to death in a stranded lot off the highway in the U.S. He was beaten to death by for of his "friends". He had been loured there by his girlfriend saying they wer going to have sex. When she was half undressed, the other three guys pooped out and massacred him with shovels and bricks, after they wer done with him they had a group hug, ugh. I am not mentioning all the details, bye

       Wow,joeys barmitzvah was so.. elegant. He had it at such a nicce place. The Dj was bad so hardly anyone danced, but, because the place was so big, matthew, terry and i went elsewhere then the dancefloor. We sort of made friends with the bouncers. they were stalking us. wherever we went he was behind us.Then matthew and terry decided to double team me so i took those plastic coctail swords and defended myself. Several times i seeked refuge behind the bouncer.Finally, daniel came and helped matthew and terry, they cornered me, and i was dragged down some stairs, and then i was held down by matthew and daniel and poked so many times by terry with a plastic sword for revenge. There was a food fight at the beginning with jelly beans. David, neil, jamila and i wer all throwing them at fraser who was being showered on with jelly beans.There was one person who kept on shooting spitballs at neil and david, so when they finally cought him, well, u can imagine. Fraser stupidly threw a jelly bean at a bouncer who got mad at fraser. there was also an ice sculptuer, it was awesome.I got 8 airbrush tattoos on me, though there alrdy starting to wear off.

       Adam is a bum.  I WILL NOT DROWN!  I REFUSE!  I WILL NOT BE VANQUISHED!  And, just for that, i will make a long and boring speech from my preacher side.  Ahem... To excel in something takes much time to earn.  Hours and hours (japanese: manichi manichi) of practice and of toil.  What do i excel at?  I do not excel.  I try harder.  If i fail, i'll try again and again no matter what.  What i seem to have, is nothing compared to the total potency that a human being has.  Modest, say thou?  Modest?  Nay, i am but trying to say that everyone can do anything as long as they have enough concentraaaa........I HAVEE TO GO SWIMMING! NOOOOOOOO

       Everybody, hold ur horses, nobody's hittin nobody.Here are lessons to taunting nicole: First, find a place tall enough thats out of her reach (for green tea). Secondly, While she's bent over getting something from her knapsack that can reach it, silently grab the green tea while she's not looking. Thirdly, run off with it, and listen carefully for her moans and groans, yelling for you. BEWARE: While running away from her, watch out for her allies, who will pursue you(ie: Dana, Jenny,Olivia)  TIP: it annoys her when u trip her when shes unsuspecting

       *yawn* Let's review our whacking Adam lessons.  First, you must grip your honeyed green tea bottle as tightly as possible.   Make sure you use your body in the swing and bring back your arm after hitting.  Bring the bottle up high and bring it down quickly.  This tactic provides instant and efficient satifaction and reduces stress.  Make sure you hit Adam's back otherwise he might pass out if you hit him on the head and will not be able to feel the PAIN!  Also, for more satisfaction, i suggest you chant my motto as i pound people on the back:  NO NO NO NO!  BAD BAD BAD BAD!!!!!!!!

I've been told by my cousin that i'm weird (probably because i'm related to her).  She's says i'm too boyish.  Dana, would you say that i'm a fag hag?  It may seem like an insult to me but it's actually an insult to Neil, Adam and David [Fruitcake] or the Three Stooges that Rape Each Other Every Day.  Look it up, look it up if you dont know what a fag hag is!

       Exerpts from my favourite book and ultimately greatet book of chicklit history, behold:  On The Bright Side, I am now a girlfriend of a sex god.  "Staring out of my bedroom window at other people having a nice life.  Who would have thought things could be so unbelievably pooey? I'm fourteen and my life is over because of the selfishosity of --so called--grown-ups.  I said to Mum, "You re ruining my llife. Just because yours is practically over there is no reason to take it out on me." But as usual when I say something sensible and meaningful she just tutted and adjusted her bra like a Russian Roulettle player. (Or do I mean disco thrower? I don't know and, what's more, I dont care.) If I counted up the number of times I've been tutted at, I could open a tutting shop.  It's jut not fair...How can my parents take me away from my mates and make me go to New Zealand? Who goes to New Zealand? In the end, when I pointed out how utterly useless as mum she was, she lost  her rag and SHOUTED  at me. "Go to your room right now!" I said, "All right, I'll go to my ROOM!! I WILL go to my room!! And do you know what I'll be doing in my room? No you don't, so I'll tell you! I'll be just BEING in my room. That's all.  Because there is nothing else to do!!!!!!" The I just left her thre.  To think about what she has done. Unfortunately it means that I am in m bed and it is only six o'clock."   WASNT THAT THE GREATEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!! I think it's genius...Hm...What other part of the book should i write?    " The Sex God has landed at my door. I was wearing my Teletubby pajamas. He said, "Hi." I said, "Hhhnnnnnnggggghh."    That is all the funnyosity I have for today..Jenny, you still have to read the thirsd book, i'll bring it tomorrow.

       It is now time for another Chobits quote!  In that city, there was no one The lights in the windows were on but no one was walking on the streets I looked inside a window and there was a person But they were with "that" I looked inside another window, there was another person But, obviously, they were with "that" Because when you're with "that" you're happy That's why no one comes outside I want to find someone for me But if that person becomes attached to me and me only then.... It will time for the two of us to part But, still... I'd like to meet that person just for me... Thinking that, i headed on to another empty city...  --Chobits--

       On second thought, that doesnt really look like Zero...I believe he wields a saber....hm.....did he have a jet on his pack?  Yeah, maybe because he can zoom across the screen really fast in th game and slide quickly on the ground......still, the face doesnt look like Zero....Zero has a angry-ish face..oh wait, it's sort of angry but not really....Well, i'm sure the other one is Megaman for no other character wears the ridiculous blue suit and helmet [ >P blech!]  Actually, Zero would look like Protoman if you put sunglasses and a scarf on him.........hm....Megaman's Japanese name is Rockman....lots of weird names for the characters...most of them end with man...that's so sexist.......  Characters' names ending with man:  Megaman                                                                      Skullman Protoman [aka Blues in Japanese]                               Snakeman Gutsman                                                                        Stoneman Colorman                                                                      Thunderman Bomberman [coincidence?  i think NOT]                       Toadman Cutman                                                                         Woodman Elecman                                                                        Kingman Fireman Freezeman Heatman Knightman Leagueman Magicman Shadowman Sharkman [Whew, that's all i can find for now...]

       I'm still waiting for Chobits to download.  *sigh* I just discovered some parts are sort of gross/funny.  Some persocons are dressed really badly.  Some wear really short maid outfits.  eew.....Chii is the cutest of them all though.  She wears the most adorable clothing.  Remember this, Hideki If she starts to speak, No matter how cute she is No matter how good she is Don't fall in love with her, You'll just end up in tears.  --Chobits--  Dark Chii

       I am searching for the person who is right for me.  A person that will like me for who I am.  A person that will like me even if I can't make his (her) dreams come true.  -Chobits-  Omg, Chobits is the cutest anime in the world...I've only seen a few episodes but it's so adorable...*sniffle* I'm starting to get emotional now....*sniff*  Chobits is the romantic type of anime that's slow-paced and cute.  it mostly talks about romance, acceptance, love and relationships.  I really love it.  The story is about a guy named Motosuwa Hideki who is poor and wishes to earn a persocon (personal computer that looks like a human).  Obivously, he's too poor to buy one so one day while he's walking past a dumpster, he spots something that looks like a human.  He panics but finds out it's actually a persocon.  When he brings her back to his apartment, he pushes the on button and the persocon comes to life.  She keeps on saying the word Chii at first so it becomes her name.  Hideki tries to hook Chii up on his television so he can surf the internet but it says no data so he calls up his friends who try and fix Chii with their own persocons but all the other persocons crash after trying to fix her.  Then, his friend Minoru tells him about a legendary persocon that's called a Chobits and does not need an operator and has feelings.  he then shows Hideki a picture of a persocon excatly like Chii all covered in wires and enscribed in its leg is the word CHOBITS...dunh dunh dunh....  This is Chii.  Ain't she cute? She's my fav. character...

       hey nikki, i have an idea about what you could do about your missing folder. if you know what homework and sheets you have missing, try to get an extra copy (copies) from the teachers, and for those other sheets, also try to get an extra copy from the teachers, or you could photocopy them from people in your class (there is a photocopier in M. brugniau's office and they let you use it, or go to the one close to the science labs and get a teacher to do it for you). its pretty important to get all those sheets back though...  ps..you have no life with that comic strip but its still mega cool.

       Waaaaaah!  I want my folder back...My entire school year will be a flop/catastrophe/ death sentence if i do not find it soon!   I know i didnt leave it in my classes....My mom suspects that some desperate student took it to copy my answers, notes, homework or take away my papers.  I'll just go and die in a nearby pothole in the road if i don't get it back tomorrow.  *starts banging head on desk* Why me?  Why me?  Why me of all people?  What did i do to deserve this?  Die, Die, DIE!

       Topic: Should i tell on my friend saying from the bible: "Brothers, even though a man takes some false step before he is aware of it, you who have spiritual qualifications try to readjust such a man in the spirit of mildness" (Galatians 6:1)  Topic: How to deal with peer pressure Saying: "Dead flies are what cause the oil of the ointment maker to stink,to bubble forth. So a little foolishness does to one who is precious for wisdom and glory" (Ecclesiastes 10:1)  (the meaning of that last one is: in ancient times, a valuable ointment or perfume could be ruined by something as tiny as a dead fly. Similarly, ones hard-earned reputation could be ruined by just "a little foolishness"

       I'm sick today.  The room keeps on spinning and the ground moves underneath my feet.  I think i'm gonna hurl...blaaaaaaaaah!  I'm seeing weird things,  The lamps in my room are bobbing up and down and my stuffed animals are waving.  Two cans with tennis balls inside tipped over and went up again on top of my desk.  Also, my Garfield figure is doing a weird version of the Hustle with its legs...I fell asleep and dreamed i was at school being chased by a gebbeth( or something that came from  The wizard of Earthsea  that was a dark, black blob) in the shape of Adam which kept on screaming, " I'm going to kill you!  I'm going to kill you".  I woke up again and fell asleep only to dream of being pulled under the snow by a sharp red thing with teeth.  For some reason, i had been testing ot my new blue wings that had grown the last hour and had swooped down too low to the nameless fear that grabbed me.  Everyone else at school was standing at the ledge and they didnt notcie me struggling for help.  I tried to scream but my voice came out as a whisper.  I tried again, but to no avail.  I died.  The last word that went through my head were "Idiots...".  It's true though. A nameless fear is the worst kind of fear.  So, from now on, i shall call my nameless fears Pink Socks or Adam.  lol. Today, i fell up the stairs many times.  It's weird to fall up the stairs but it was fun. XD

       So... I'm sitting at home, typing a speech for Dana's bat mitzvah.  I feel stupid, typing an important part of my friend's life while dressed in a rudely made little Uchiha Sasuke costume.  Not exactly what i pictured it to be... I want to find the essence of this speech.  i want something that will move people and that will make them laugh.  I want something that will show all our silly jokes in the past.  I want everyone to laugh with us as we did laugh until we fell on the floor, clutching our sides with our bellies aching and cheeks hurting but as happy as a newborn foal.  A foal that is so exciting about life that withing a few hours, gets up and explores the world, new scents, feelings and wonders...

       I wonder where everyone on the blog went....hmm..... I'm getting obsessed with Naruto again.   I'm going to practice drawing Sasuke, Naruto and Sakura together. Hinata and Sasuke are my most fav. characters!  *nyaaaaaaaa...* ^.^ The characters are quite interesting and their background stories are mostly quite sad so please bear with me while i tell each of their tales one by one     Naruto is the main character of the show (duh).  He likes Sakura a lot but detest Sasuke because Sasuke is better than him.  Unfortunately, she hates him and is nearly in tears when she's put in his team.  He loves ramen noodles, is twelve and not the smartest chip off the block.  He's slow, he's stupid, he's hilarious.  He does the unexpected all the time.  Hmm...too many examples of his hilarious antics..i couldnt possibly tell all of them...watch the anime, it's really too funny.  Despite his comical and happy side, he has a sad story.  Many years ago, there was a demon fox that terrorized Leaf Village.  One of the Hokage ( strongest ninja in the village) came and sacrificed his life in order to seal the spirit of the fox inside a newborn baby.  Unfortunately, that baby was Naruto.  Naruto now lives without his parents in his own home.  Everyone hates him because they think that Naruto IS the demon fox but, in reality, Naruto is just the container.  All parents ignore him and set a bad influence on their children who in turn begin to hate Naruto for no reason.  Therefore, the Hokage made a law that no parent may talk about the demon fox and that no one must tell Naruto that the demon fox is sealed within him.  Naruto finds this out in the first episode and is shocked.  He gradually recovers and focuses on his dream, to one day become Hokage so that all villagers may acknowledge his existence and realize that he really isnt a bad person.     Sakura is a romantic and dreamy type of person.  She really likes Sasuke and dreams about kissing him and stuff like that (ahahah!  She gets so annoyed when Naruto kisses Sasuke on the lips accidentally and beats Naruto up for stealing her kiss).  She's not very good at fighting but excels in strategy and chakra ( a spiritual energy that circles around the body of a person that allows one to do amazing things like ninjutsus, self-replication and walking on ceilings) control.  She hates Naruto and wishes sometimes that he didnt exist.  She also detests Fuzzy Eyebrows (Rock Lee) but gradually builds more respect for Naruto and Rock after a while.  At one point, she takes her knife and cut off her hair because she's tired of being a useless person on the team and also to save the lives of Naruto and Sasuke.  She thinks that she spends too much time worrying about her looks when she should be practicing to fight so that she can actually save people's lives.  Supposedly, her forehead is way too big...i think it looks normal...hmm..... Her story isnt that sad.  Ino used to be her best friend but when Sakura fell in love with Sasuke, so did Ino and all the other girls.  Ino and Sakura got in a fight and have hated each other since.  I think they've been enemies for almost 10 years.     Ah, Sasuke.  The guy all the girls in the class like.  He's cool, reserved and silent.  He barely talks.  Every anime has got a guy like this.  Someone who's cool....too cool...and serious all the time.  Well, not all the time.  I especially love how they do Sasuke's chibi face.  Anyhow, he's rivals with quite a number of people...let's see...Gaara, Neji, Rock, Naruto and .....i think that's it....He really hates Naruto.  Well, almost everyone hates Naruto.  He has a sad past.  I'm not too sure but i think that...ah, yes....When Kakashi, his team trainer, asks what his goal is, he responds in a cold and sharp tone, "My goal is to kill someone that i've been after...before i die" This person is Sasuke's elder brother.  When Sasuke was a kid, he came back home and saw his mother and father corpses lying on the floor.  His brother, Itachi, was standing over their dead bodies.  Sasuke believed he was too scared and weak to protect his loved ones.  Since then, he began to think that no one could accomplish anything without being really really good at everything.  He is a genius actually.  Some say he was the genius of the Uchiha clan.  He has a special ability that is passed down his family, the Sharingan.  The Sharingan is when one's eyes turn red and you can "read" the future (actually, copy someone's moves and find out easily which one they'll use next and use it against them).  He is cursed with a seal that Orochimaru gave him recently that takes over his body when he uses chakra and turns him into a killing machine.  Orochimaru is hoping that sasuke will come to him, seeking more power.  He wants to use Sasuke as a tool to wreak havoc between all villages.  That's all i can think of now....     Hinata is the shy person in the class.  She likes Naruto and it's pretty obvious that she admires him but Naruto is too stupid/slow to realize this, he doesnt know that she likes him and often hurts her feelings without knowing.  For instance,  when Hinata finally managed to muster up the courage to tell Naruto something, she stutters and mumbles, then Naruto simply goes, "huh?" and walks away. Her white eyes are actually a more primitive and more powerful version of the Sharingan, passed down the Hyuuga clan.  It is called the Byakugan and it allows the user to see which parts of the body to hit while fighting.  The technique is the hit someone and force your chakra into their body, hitting the vital areas and kill them instantly.  It also allows one to see chakra holes, spots over the body that are the size of needle points, and hit them.  This technique allows one to either kill an opponent or control, increase, decrease and stop their chakra flow. Hinata was supposedly a runt of the family.  She was very weak and not aggressive enough.  Her own family rejected her.  Neji, a ninja the same age related to her but a part of the branch family of the Hyuuga instead of the head family like Hinata, is mean to her.  He discourages her and tells her that she can never change, that she'll always be a loser.  Naruto yells out to her and tells her to fight back.  Hinata does a good job in fighting Neji but her heart is hit by Neji's Byakugan.  She begins to spit up blood and is about to be carried away but she stand up again and keeps on trying to fight in order to prove herself worthy but is hit constantly.  I don't know what happens after but she falls on the floor and Neji wins the match.  She tries to get up but falls again.  She is then carried away by paramedics saying things like, " Hurry, she won't last for ten minutes if we don't get her treated." In the end, Hinata proved herself and tried to change herself.  She worked hard and trained.  There is a scene when she is practicing hitting a pole till it is nighttime and the pole is smudged with reddish blots of blood from her hands that are bruised and cut.  She is inspired but Naruto and how he works so hard to attain his goal.    Ahahahah...Rock Lee.  Most people just call him Lee.  His looks are funny and he is a very sappy person (*fiery eyes*  AAAALRIIIGHT!  LET'S RUN TOWARDS THE SUNSET TOGETHER!!!!!).  He really likes Sakura who is devastated by his looks (fuzzy eyebrows, bob cut hair, eyelashes and saucer eyes?  c'mon, that's almost every girl's nightmare!  Look at him for goodness sake!  Look at him!)  Despite his strange looks, I really admire his personality.  At the beginning, Lee had absolutely no talent and could only fight normally, with punches, kicks and devastating combos.  He worked hard every day and soon became a taijutsu (normal fighting) specialist.  His hands are wrapped in bandages because they are scarred and blackened from training so hard.  His legs wrapped in orange have weights underneath, but not just normal weights, they weigh a ton each!!! He's a speed devil and extremely fast.  He actually has a talent that is undiscovered until ep 50.  He is able to open gates (whatever that means).  His match with Gaara is really sad.  Lee trains really hard because he's mad that other people can be geniuses and achieve things easily without trying so this match means a lot to him since he needs to beat Gaara, a genius BTW, in order to fight people he really wanted to prove himself to...  He nearly defeats Gaara but uses a secret self-destructing combo too many times and rips his muscles.  Not only is that bad enough but Gaara attacks his left arm and leg with his sand.  Every bone in Lee's body is crushed and his arm and leg are ruined.  I was tears when I learned that Lee would never be able to fight again because of his body.  He had worked so hard to prove himself but his dream was shattered and he would never be able to complete it.  why is it that Lee lost to Gaara?  Gaara never even TRIED!  Lee worked so hard and actually deserved to win!  He would never be able to fight again.....*breaks out in hysteric sobs*

       This is my log on all my thoughts while we’re driving….  Bored, bored, bored.  Played a bit of game boy and Mad Libs.  Listened to 8 music cds so far…ate at Mickey D’s (hahha, Adam taught me that term! New Vocabulary!)  I’m going to get  Universal studios soon.  It will be too late to play there. Of course.  It will be around 3:00 pm when I get there.  Ho hum, I wonder if anyone else is going to Universal Studios.  Half of my brother’s class is going…*yawn* I ate 2 krispy kreme doughnuts (mmm…..) and tried some guacamole flavoured Doritos (blech, they’ve been coloured with spinach green powder followed by red and yellow dots.  They don’t even taste like guacamole!!! Ugh, I have a headache and don’t want to read my French book nor try to write properly in English.  I saw cotton and chicken farms all the way.  Usually, I enjoy long car rides but this rental car is all cramped.  The bags in front are blocking my leg room (aaah,! This is hell!  My poor legs…must stretch…legs….) and I’m pretty squeamish about public places that aren’t clean (honestly, I make a big deal about  cleanliness in public places.  If there’s any mould on the walls or a bit of food on the table, I don’t want to touch it.)  Well then,  I’ve spent a few minutes staring at Links, the cat, my new office assistant.  So cute…(meow)  Messed up cat I tried to make:  /\      /(=^.^=) | O O| O---- O   You know what’s the worst thing?  When you’re trapped in a car, carsick, and the smell of nasty burger and fries are in the air.  Also, when there’s a nastier fly stuck in the car as well.  Not a normal black fly, a gray one with green specks and who is terrorizing your poor brother.  You know what’s even worse?  When there’s nothing to do in the car  and you completely numben your brain’s instincts to kill yourself by writing a log of all the happenings.  Hmmm….I’ll read the billboards….”Crime and Punishment Museum.  Next turn”  oooh…sounds interesting…. “Hooters airlines”  Yurk…I don’t even want to think about it….that’s sick… Hooters is a restaurant that degrades feminine morality….You don’t even want to know what my dad said when he saw the sign.  Ugh, he has a strange sense of humour.   Oooooh….Archaelogists found some gold buried near a historic site that could possibly be worth millions…lessee…80 gold coins and crates found buried in the sand….wow…..What else?  Murderer on the loose.  Escaped while on parole.   Killed two female real estate agents.  Feh, coward.  Bullying women like that.  What a lowlife.  SAVE ME!! My dad is playing country music.  AUGH!  I hat e this kind of banjo country music.  AAAAAAAAAAH!!! *smashes window and escapes.  Runs on highway and gets run over by truck* Anyhow, my brother and I were faking exaggerated Canadian accents so that ppl would actually believe we were from Canada.  “We’re, like, frum Canada, eh? Like, thith plathe is purty cool,eh?  What are you talking aboot, eh? “ I read an interesting article on the plane about krispy kremes and why they’re so popular.  They are the most popular in Canada.  There’s a hilarious theory that suggests that the popularity of this pastry rests solely on the fact that it is related to another loved hobby in Canada.  It looks like a hockey puck.  KK doughnuts look like hockey pucks, Canadians love hockey.  Therefore, Canadians love KK doughnuts!   DYNAMIC DEDUCTION!  Now I know why Adam loves those pastries so much.  Mmmmm…..I feel like another doughnut….well, hockey puck or not, these doughnuts are the BEST!  The BEST you hear? I slept for a few hours and guess what?  i've got free internet cable access woohoo!  Life is good.  Life is gooooooooood..

       *yawn* got back from my aunt's workplace.  They organized a tour and everything.  Their company is sooo rich....they gave us prizes, free t-shirts, caps, candy, breakfast, lunch and a kit with a pen and tons of papers about how to go to an interview and type resume.  I helped stuff envelopes with cheques for my aunt.  The company doesnt seem very careful of where it puts its money.  There are 42 different departments.  Each meeting, the company gives out free food and stuff.  Wow...they also invite kids to their offices for Christmas and give out tons of gifts.  Last year, i got a portable radio/phone.

       *yawn*   I hate homework.  Homework is stupid.  Especially when you try writing about foods and fats when you have a stomach ache... eeew...peanut oil is high in fat....hmm....no worries about that...I think i'm going to lie on the floor and think of how sad my life is.  eat sleep study work laugh, eat sleep study work laugh, eat sleep study work laugh....... My life isnt exciting.  Sometimes i wish lived in Naruto's world where there is such thing as Chakra and Adventure.  These days, people are afraid of everything.  They afraid of animals, sickness, other people, unknown and themselves.  i like the unknown.  it has a mysterious yet exciting ring to it.  The unknown..... Adventure, mystery, excitement...the way of the ninja *sigh*

       This is a little image taken from Sasuke's death scene.  It was one of my favorite scenes in the entire series so far.  Very well done and quite sad.  Sasuke is one of my favorite characters.  I just love how stubborn and silent he is.  It's also quite funny how he reacts to certain things.  Basically what happened was that while Naruto and his team had been assigned a mission meant for young children like weeding or catching pets, there was a mixup and they were assigned with a mission meant for professional ninjas.  Sasuke gets trapped in an ice prison and Naruto comes in to help.  Despite their efforts, they are easily defeated.  Naruto gets knocked out and Sasuke is the only one left standing (Sakura is not in the ice prison, she's protecting the child and his master's target).  Haku, the genius child controlling the ice prison, sends a shower of needles to Naruto, thinking that even if Sasuke seemed to hate Naruto, he would go protect him.  Sasuke positions himself in front of Naruto and the needles penetrate his body.  Naruto wakes up and sees Sasuke.  "You did it, Sasuke!" he says but freezes and his smile disappears once he sees the fatal wounds all over his friend.  "You're always such a burden" coughs Sasuke.  The needles are poking out from Sasuke's back and blood is dripping on the floor.  "Why?" he mutters, "You protected me...  "Who knows..." Sasuke mutters while coughing up blood and remembering the times he and Naruto spent together as rivals, "I...hated you " "Why did you protect me?" yells Naruto angrily while clenching his fist tightly, " I NEVER ASKED YOU TO!". "How am i supposed to know?" whispers Sasuke, " My body moved of its own accord, stupid..." His eyes close and his body slides down to the floor.  Naruto catches him and sees Sasuke's eyes that were wide with fear and sadness.  "I didn't want to die until i killed my brother." Sasuke whispered near tears and reaching out his hand to Naruto,"I wanted to accomplish my dreams.  You... don't die."  Naruto stares in disbelief as Sasuke's hand drops to the floor, motionless.  Sasuke's stubborn eyes and features relax.  His mouth opens slightly and his head falls back.  Naruto realizes that this is the way of the ninja and that he might soon lose more friends as he grows up.  He drops Sasuke's body on the floor and cries out, "Shut up, stupid.  I...hated you too.  You will pay.  You will pay for killing my friend."  Of course, i can't tell you what happens next.  Heheh, that would ruin the story.  Watch the anime yourself.        And this is Sakura crying over Sasuke's dead body.

          Top left:  Naruto being attacked by a cat while trying to complete a ninja mission (recover someone's missing cat) It just shows how terrible a ninja he is  Top right: Naruto complaining about something, i don't really remember what.  i think he was sick with missions    and wanted to go out and fight people  Bottom Left: Naruto and his team going to get another mission from HQ  Bottom Right: Naruto getting pissed off because someone noted out loud that he was the shortest of the trio.       This chart shows how short he is.  heheheh, look at his annoyed face.

       I watched a movie yesterday called "When Harry met Sally". It was quite funny. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan were in it.  At one point in a restaurant Meg ryan fakes an orgasm to show to the guy that girls can fake them well. She was like screamin in the restaurant and everybody was staring at her. that was funny. I had a nap yesterday for 2 hours cause i was so tired. What am i goin to do today?

Oh, and speaking of piercings I'm putting a hoop in my cartiallage one this Sunday and then it'll be there Monday at school.  Don't you think piercings are just the best thing in the world??

What is it? Dory:  It's soooo pretty... Marlin: I'm feeling....happy.  Which is a big deal....for me.... Dory: I'm going to touch it *laughs* Marlin: Hey, come back here.  Come back here you.  *spots predator* Happy feeling's gone.  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!!!

       Iwa s reading the Disney movies thing you wrote..Nikki..you have a lot to learn..ya..the fairy tale movies i dont like..excpet for Aladdin..ya..Genie was cool...but not all of the Disney movies are the fairy tales..like the Pricess Diaries (that movie is annoying but it used to be good..until i turned 12) then Pirates of the Carribean which is like my favourite Disney movie..i think..Freaky Friday too..that was good. So ya..all i have to say is ................BURN.  But ya you still have a point about the fairy tale ones..so i think you win.

I annoy and confuse ppl.  Yes, i love my job.   13) Favorite color(s): dark red  14) Hometown: Toronto  17) have you ever been to Europe? Never been anywhere out of North America (I feel like i'm stuck in a well trying to see the whole sky...)  18) Have you ever toilet papered anything?:  I have been toilet papered by my cousin.  She thought it would be amusing to play with her dad's shaving cream so she sprayed an entire can on me and wrapped me in toilet paper.  *sigh* She trapped me in the washroom and locked the door so i couldnt escape...  19) Loved somebody so much it made you cry? i don't think so  20) Been in a car accident?: two times    21) On salad, do you want Croutons or bacon bits?: Croutons....how can ppl call it a salad if there's bacon in it?  That's like saying...saying ...(oh, crap.  Mind block!) 22) Sprite or 7UP?: Sprite.  7 up tastes like carrots >P  23) Favorite Movies: Anime movies!! 24) Favorite Holiday: Chinese New Year and Christmas! 25) Favorite day of the week: Friday  26) Favorite word or phrase: "Boys are smelly" and "Boys are stupid, let's throw rocks at them" lol...I've become obsessed with that since i saw it on a shirt  27) Favorite Toothpaste: I'm fine with it as long as there are no sparkles in it, colouring and it must taste like mint.

Cinderella didnt have pet rats either...Disney brainwashes children to make them think that Disney created fairy tales.  Some girl in my brother's grade (gr. 6) thinks that Disney invented Cinderella.  Hello?  Why is it that no one reads the actual fairy tales anymore?  Is it because they think that Disney tells the truth?  Pretty soon, they're going to try and change the fairy tales themselves so that kids who read them get happy sappy endings.    35) Favorite Fast Food Restaurant: ......  36) When was your last hospital stay?: When i was born.  37) What color is your bedroom carpet?: i have a wood floor in my bedroom   38) How many times did you fail your driver's test: never taken it  39) Have you ever been convicted of a crime?: no  40) Who sent this to you?: Jenny  41) Which stores would you choose to max out your credit card?:   Best Buy and Future Shop (all those anime dvds!!!)   42) What do you do most often when you are bored?: go on the computer  43) Which of your friends lives farthest away?: You see, i'm not very good with geography. I once thought the city of Kiev was in the middle of Italy.  44) Most annoying thing people ask me: What do you mean by that?  I hate that question!  Especially if it's repeated more than once in a conversation. 46) Who will respond the quickest?:  dunno  47) Who is the person you send this to that is least likely to respond?: I'm not sending the email.   48) Favorite all time TV shows:  Anime, Family Guy, Simpsons, South Park, Three's Company   49) Last person you went out to lunch with: my family  50) Last Movie you watched? Three's Company (actually it's a tv show put in a dvd.  I must say it's quite funny)

       -.-  I saw the snow.  I just came back this morning *yawn*.  I hate going on planes at 5:00 am... The air cannon i got is this handheld cannon with a trigger at the back.  I can pull back the trigger and release it to fire a harmless ball of air at ppl.  It's really quite funny, they look around confused after and are like, " What the heck just happened?" Of course, i'd use it more often but unfortunately my aim sucks since i'm too weak to pull the trigger fully. :(

       Hello, I;'m back in Atlanta (finally, internet connection).  I'm coming back to Toronto tomorrow!  Whoopee!  Universal Studios Islands of Adventure was quite fun.  The best rides were Ripsaw fall (i went on it 7 times), The Hulk (two times since Derek was too short to get in.  Well, at least we managed to sneak him past the attendants once) and Dueling Dragons (Go, Ice Dragon!  That one's better than Fire.  More loop the loops and upside down turns).  Later, I'm going to this awesome and legendary fondue restaurant with my dad.  It's rumoured to have a haunted women's restroom.  Ppl say that they can hear things from the door.  I can't wait to go in and check.  If i come back posessed by an angry bathroom spirit, i hope you guys know how to perform exorcism!!  I also went to the Coke bottling facility and tasted different typed of coke from around the world.  I then went to see the CNN HQ where they gave a tour.  My mom wants me to be a news anchor when i grow up so it was a good experience... See you all on Monday or....earlier...i dunno....Hasta luego (i practiced my Spanish in Florida a bit)

It was the WORST movie I've EVER seen (might have something to do with the fact that I never saw the first 2 and couldn't tell any of the characters apart)!!   Laura and I walked out and went to Indigo.  Apparently we missed the 'final battle'.  Too bad, so sad. And if we wanna see a movie lets go thrusday or friday or saturday just not between 5 and 7:30 on thursday or friday.

       Good evening.  I bought an air cannon today so i can fire balls of air at ppl.  It's great except for the fact that it looks like a piece of junk.  I went on the Spiderman Ride, Dr. Doom's fear fall (i was screaming.  so scary...), Dudley Do-right's Ripsaw Falls (Derek:  nikki, if you sit in the back, i sweeeear you won't get wet...(little liar)..), The flying unicorn (yuck), Poseidon's Fury (the fake greek artwork on the walls were actually impressive.  I loved the design of the building and the pictures on the walls.  it shows that they actually researched about the sea god.  The story was terrible though funny at some moments..). Tomorrow, I'm going to Universal Studios instead of exploring Islands of Adventure and City walk like today.  I'm going to get henna tattoos and have my hair braided and wrapped.  Joy... I saw some of my brother's friends at Islands of Adventure.  The place is so big that it's almost impossible to find ppl.

          This here is an obituary for Dana's eraser who was brutally ripped to pieces by a frustrated owner.  I never really knew Eraser very well but he seemed like a good, trustworthy and honest fellow.  I knew his cousin, who now resides in my blue pencil case.  Eraser was a dependent fellow.  You could always count on him to erase mistakes for you.  He always left a clean mark on the page, not streaks of black.  He always cleaned up his shavings by himself too.  He was a good man.  He washed every day and made friends with all his other buddies who shared a pencil case with him.  Sadly, he was ripped to pieces by Dana and his remains are now buried and kept in her compass bag.  Poor Eraser.  We shall remember him forever.  His purpose, his salute, his shavings...

       Why is everyone on the blog ignoring me?  I feel left out.  I feel much sad.  I decided to launch a line of "doll fashion wear" with bits of clothing and such that i find on the internet.  Wish me luck. Oh, i'm also working on a new book.  i feel that this one will win for sure.  I have decided to title it as "The Glass Rose". It will be a really sad book of philosophy and life.  I can see it already...

       The Sasuke x Sakura picture is now my wallpaper on my comp.  I put it up in tiles since i loved it so much.  it completely booted off my Chobits wallpaper with Chii in a little angel costume, pulling away some curtains.  It is also my background for my msn convos.  Very cute, it blends nicely with the conversation window.  No other picture has been more perfect.  No worries, i'm sure i'll find another image that shall pique my interest and boot off this Sasuke x Sakura picture. XD

       Hey look guys, i got my first comment from a stranger on my blo!  YAY!  And i got it for complaining about how much i hate homework!  DOUBLE YAY!  His name is Joey (Not Joey Brown from our school).  I checked out his blog and it's really quite amusing.  Ah, that truly made my day.  There's nothing better than someone you don't know that coincidentally stumbles on your page and acknowledges your work (oh, wait.  I hate work...well, blogging's the only kind of work i like).

       Yeah, well, Adam.  Why don't you try to make a comic.  it's not that easy to get a sprite sheet with an item that looks vaguely like osobucco.  No one out there makes osobucco sprite sheets unless they have absolutely no life.  i wish someone would take this comic making job from me but...*sigh*  it seems that i'm the only one who is able to use sprite sheets and upload images from my comp onto the computer.  i was the one who taught you all about HTML and URL!  I WAS THE ONE WHO TAUGHT MYSELF HOW TO USE A COMPUTER AND HOW TO POST PLAYERS AND PHOTOS!  my next goal is to learn how to put up video clips...

       Why does the blog not post my responses?  Yup, i get it now Dana but you would have laughed if i had told you a dream like that except that the other person was different.  anyhow...I reinstalled my camera on my new comp check it out...    believe it or not, it's me.  I decided to mess around with the effects to make it seem like a portrait.  A more or less failed but nice attempt if you ask me.  As you can see, I'm still in my uniform.  Yes, well that's because i'm too lazy to change. Now you know what a lazy slob i am as well as a slacker and diagnosed with a severe case of procrastination. Ps.  My bro's hiding behind my head.  youcan see his big head sticking out if you look carefully.

       I never said it was just white ppl, you're always changing my words to make it seem like i'm some bad person.  I wrote that while i was mad about someone who was White and who decided to post a really offending message about chinese ppl on a website for chinese.  I never said that.  Sure, some asians and other races can be racist too and i'd be pretty pissed off too if i saw some other racist ppl typing about other races.  This time however, it was a white person against chinese.  Obviously, it's not right to go to a Chinese website and post up a message saying how Chinese ppl are losers and that Whites are "Captain Cool".  Anyone who would even think about doing that to any race is just a plain asshole.  I'm sorry if that text offended anyone.  I wrote that while i was angry and was not careful about where i put my words.  I feel terrible now.  Just like that idiot who wrote stuff on that website.

       What the fuck is up ur ass nicole. Look around you. Its not just us "white ppl" who are racist bastards. Oh, its always the white ppl, sure, it might be, but just as many asian/africain ppl behave in the same way. So wake up and breathe the real fucking air. I'm sorry abt wat that fuck up said but its not always us "white's". Please use a more general term like "ppl" or "that white asshole". OK CAPICH. YOU OFFEND ME

       Indeed we are, fellow Hologram, indeed we are. Chant with us:  Who will lead us? Zarvox, our creator! Who will win world domination? Us, the Holograms!

       It was the time of time when Zarvox came down.  He came down and made us, the holograms forever to rule the earth without him and prepare for world domination in the year 250XC45.  With his almighty making powers he gave us the power of humans but made us stronger, better.  He masked the humans' senses so that we would not be detected so if a hologram made a hunting cry, they would not hear the hunting cry.  If a hologram was touched by humans, the humans would feel and see that they were not going through the hologram but were.  And, we are the holograms.  Forever to roam the earth till 250XC45, waiting for world domation.

The better pics are at the bottom...Don't forget to read the stories i wrote (i know you wont since they're all about anime *nyahahaha*)  BTW, i'm not that good yet but if you guys have any pictures you want to scan and colour, don't hesitate to ask me.

       General  Japanese nickname: Um, i'm not really japanese you see.  Er...it seems that my name in japanese would mean "Journal".   What a coincidence.  If i could name myself a japanese name, it'd probably Saki (Or Sakuno but then ppl would think i'm a freak.  Oh wait, i am)  How long have you liked anime? Since the beginning of time.  I was born for anime.  What was the first anime you ever saw? I dont really remember.  The first few were Prince of Tennis, Love Hina and...Inu Yasha.  I guess Sailor Moon counts as well (though i hate it now)  What was the first song you every heard in Japanese? The Prince of Tennis intro (which is pretty good)  Can you speak some Japanese? i know some words and simple stuff  Can you read any Japanese? Nope.  I can't even read in Chinese very well (yet) ^.^;;;  Do you own anything anime? yes.  lots of stuff.  If you could see my room, every square inch of the wall is covered by anime posters and my desk is filled with anime drawings.  I own a lot of dvds and cds filled with anime too.  Do you have any imported anime items? yup  Do you own a video game system and RPGs like Final Fantasy? All of the Final Fantasy games and lots of other RPGs (Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross..etc)   Favorites   Anime series: Prince of Tennis, Naruto, Inu Yasha  Anime movie: Hmmm...it would be a Prince of Tennis movie if there was one but instead it would be the Inu Yasha movie with the wacky elf guy who controls ppl and makes Kagome grow long nails so that she can throw them at ppl (lol) ^.^  Manga: Prince of Tennis and Naruto  Manga artist: Hm...never thought about that one..  Japanese singer: Er...Utada Hikaru or Yuko Sasaki  Japanese song: Haruka Kanata and all the Prince of Tennis openings and endings ^.^ (I'm such a retard)  Anime opening song: please refer to question above  Anime closing song: Prince of Tennis endings (profound, huh?)  Voice actress: Minagawa Junko  Voice actor: Yamaguchi Kappei, Hoshi Souichirou, Seki Tomokazu~  Japanese snack food: Hm..i eat so many that i lost track.  Well, sushi is my favorite Japanese food and there was this Japanese milk tea drink that's my favorite in the world.  hmm...is Pocky Japanese?  I gotta check that up....  Flavor of Pocky: Milky Pocky *mmm....sweet and smooth*  Anime character (female): Sakuno from Prince of Tennis.  SA-KU-NO! Sakuno *sweatdropping*:  Anou...it doesnt seem like i'm very popular.  Everyone else wants Ryoma to have a yaio relationship with Momo-senpai...   Anime character (male): Ryoma.  Definitely Ryoma.  I love you Ryoma.  Anime couple: RyoSaku (so original..everyone else seems to want gay relationships within the Seigaku team.  I dont have anything against gay ppl but goddammit!  Ryoma is 12 years old ok?  You cant make a twelve year old have a relationship with a 13/14 year old!  He doesnt even know himself much yet!)  Final Fantasy (including Kingdom Hearts): Final Fantasy 7,9,and 10 and Kingdom Hearts  Non FF RPG: Chrono Cross  Final Fantasy female: Tifa, Garnet, Rhinoa, Rikku (I used to think her name was Rhino.  lol.  Does anyone else notice that these girls all look the same, except for Rikku. It seems that Squaresoft likes girls with dark hair and dark eyes)  Final Fantasy male: Cloud.....Cloud.....Cloud........Cloud....Cloud....did i mention Cloud?    Final Fantasy song or theme: The FF8 beginning song   Have you ever...  Been to a convention: I'd love to but i'm too young and my parents probably wouldnt let me  Cosplayed: I'd love to...if i could sew...  Eaten pocky: *Munching on 60 pocky stick at a time*  Been to an anime store and spent all your money: That would be heaven if i could find an anime store with the best Prince Of Tennis goods ever...  Gotten a plushie of one of your favorite characters: I'm going to get a little Chibi Ryoma keychain maybe.  I'd love one if i had a credit card...in order to order online...   Had an all-nighter watching anime: Yes and even when i'm sleeping my mind replays anime episodes in my head.  Sad, aint it?   Quoted an anime or Final Fantasy character to try and sound smart: Yes..Mada mada dane...  Played FFVII: Yes   Bought soundtracks to your favorite FF game or any FF game in general: Nyahahaha *quoting Naruto/Kikumaru* yes..*pats computer*  Drawn fanart: Yes.  Check out http://riceballgirl.bravehost.net (a little advertisement cant hurt right?)  Gotten a crush on a anime guy/girl: I love you Ryoma!  *squeezes picture of Ryoma*  lol, i'm just joking.  No.  Gotten a crush on an FF guy/girl: No.  Gotten your picture taken while in costume: yada *quoting Ryoma*  Gone to Japan: nope  Seen the entire Evangelion series: gag me  Made out with a picture of an anime/FF character: do ppl do that O.o?  *shudder*  Wished you were Japanese: I'm proud to be Chinese  Said 'tsukini kawate oshiokyo': no  Played any Final Fantasy: Hell yeah *quoting Sakura*  Spoken Japanese in public and have people stare at you: Are?  Ehh...wakaranai...  Seen a Studio Ghibli movie: yes   Misc  How many times a day do you think about anime or FF? I breathe it.  i live on it.  I'm told that i act like an anime character too.  i guess the anime thought infiltrate my brain and are trying to take over my body.  Do you watch old school anime? Old school anime?  like the classics like Fushigii Yuugi, Slayers, Gundam and whatsitsname.....   How many anime and FF CDs do you own? too many to say  Can you name all the anime and manga you've seen and read in under a minute? no, that's impossible.  Give me a year or two and i'll be able to piece it together.  Do you consider yourself an Otaku? Crazy anime fan?  yes.  I have no life whatsoever.  I have radioactive powers from sitting in front of the computer so long.  *fries brother with beams that shoot out of her eyes*

       I'm addicted to a new anime now.  ^.^ It's called X (or XTV...I'm not too sure).  It's about swords, fighting, fate and the end of the world.  I love it.  I love it as much as Prince of Tennis though the storyline is a bit hard to understand... Strangely, the main character in X resembles the main character in Prince of Tennis.  Hmm...    Kamui, protagonist in X    Ryoma, Prince of Tennis  See?  See?  There DO seem like each other.  *GASP*  Maybe they're cousins (or brothers...)!

       I'm not too obsessed with Prince of Tennis am I?  I know all the characters' birthdays.  Erm...Ryoma's will be on the 24th of December (Happy B-day, Ryoma-kun!  Ganbatte!)  and that Sakuno's will be coming soon in January...erm.. I'm kinda strange, no?  I'm one of the only ppl in the grade that watch anime.  Frankly....I'm the only girl that watches anime in the grade...Huh..... I think i'm also the only one to play rpg games like FF7 and all the Final Fantasy series as well as Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross.... Actually...Stacey used to play FF7 too.... I'm getting confused. I'm much more different than the other girls.  Instead of posters of male celebrities in my room, the majority are anime posters (2 Prince of Tennis posters, one Inu Yasha, Gundam Endless Waltz and Naruto...I used to have a Sailor Moon roll out poster but i gave that away...it was actaully quite pretty with all the flowing blue background and smooth yet blurry collections of dreamy colours....).  I dont wear skirts either.  Hmm.. I hate skirts and dresses.  They're not comfortable at all.  I also hate wearing makeup (i dont have anything with other ppl wearing it though.). Am i weird?  My mom says not to worry since I'm already very ladylike but in what ways?

Just because it has the swirvy sign thingie doesnt mean it has to be 7 dollars.  And i really dont like those Louis Vuitton bags, they are for 400 dollars for a stupid LV.  I was watching the Simple Life with Paris Hilton and Nicole Ritchie and they had a Louis Vuitton suitcase! It was probably for 40,000 dollars or something..its insane. They dont even look nice...I realy dont like it.  I cant deny it but i hvae Triple 5 Soul..Its pretty, but some people have there whole closet full of that kind of junk.. And what does Juicy mean anyway.. I was loking in a store wiht my friend because we just wanted to see the prices and make fun of them and we saw a pair of pants and it said Juicy on the ass.  What is the point of that..Are they trying to ask us, "Is your ass Juicy?" Talk about boosting our self-esteem..

       I once tried to talk to Hilary Duff on msn.  My friend convinced me to try her email address.  Supposedly it was her.  I was doubting it.  You all know how much i suck at knowing celebrities' names and what they did so i mistook her for...Amanda Bynes (is that her name?).  I thought that hilary Duff had starred in All That.  Turns out, it was Amanda Bynes that starred instead.  "Hilary"  blocked me after that.  Her screen name was an endorsement!  I still doubt that that was her.  Until i found out her email on a website.  It was the exact email i used to talk to her.  Anyways,  her name was Juicy, referring to the line of clothing.  What's so great about Juicy anything?  Hell, people just produce plain shirt with the word JUICY slapped on the front in big silver lettering and sell it for 200 bucks apiece.   Nikki: Oh, I loved your show called All That Juicy:  I didn't star in All That

       Just a note for my fellow bloggerians (or bloggers...or wtv...)  Thought that you might enjoy this fanfic that i found on fanfiction.net It's actually hilarious.  It left this huge grin on my face after reading.  Don't worry if you dont know any of the characters from the anime (Prince Of Tennis)   Warning:  It's slightly yaio/shounen ai...I hope you know what that means...  http://www.fanfiction.net/read.php?storyid=1213562    Note:  Ryoma is a boy The guy mentioned at the beginning is  Momoshiro (Ryoma's senior schoolmate who has feelings for Ryoma.  He's a boy too...lol) Implied Tezuka (Tennis captain) and Fuji (Tennis Prodigy) love.  Also shounen ai (boy's love). And...if you end a person's name with sempai that means that they're your senior and that you respect them...

         ^.^  Eeek!  It's Kikumaru Eiji!  I really like this regular's personality because he's so loving and fun.  He's another one of characters i love.  He has a carefree attitude and is also quite childlike.  His hobby is brushing his teeth (He's obsessed with his toothpaste and goes ballistic if someone else uses it.).  He's known for his "acrobatic play" which consists of doing acrobatic feats while playing tennis (because he adores being the center of attention).  His best friend would probably be Oishi because they're known as the Golden Pair, Seigaku's best doubles team, who are ALWAYS in sync.  Allow me to explain by comparing them to the team's least cooperative double Ryoma and Momoshiro:  Oishi:  Can you pass me that thing, Eiji? Eiji:*while sipping a drink*  Here ya go *tosses towel*  Momoshiro:  Echizen, pass me that thing Ryoma:  What thing? Momoshiro:  That towel under your ass, dobe....  I especially thing Kikimaru looks sooooo cute as a chibi (as seen below)

         Ryoma, everyone's favorite snarky and arrogant little bastard.  He's the youngest on the team of Seigaku and has earned the nickname of Ochibi (our little boy).  Tezuka, the captain of the team, has high hopes for him.  It's kind of annoying how Ryoma is pretty much good at everything (bowling, billiards, tennis, ping pong, English and science).  He enjoys eating hamburgers with his pal, Momoshiro, at a fast food restaurant that looks only too much like McDonald's only the symbol is a yellow A after a hard day's work of practice(obviously he persuades his pal to pay for his food).  His favorite drink is probably a can of juice called Ponta (i wonder what it tastes like...).  Allthough Ryoma can be good at tennis and everything, he has one flaw.  He has problems interacting with ppl sometimes.  He can really be an idiot sometimes when talking.  He unknowingly says things that are mean or insulting without realizing it.  I think Ryoma's problem is that his entire life revolves around tennis.  Maybe he should learn about the other pleasures in life as well.  Oh yeah,  his hobbies are playing tennis, eating burgers and trying out new bath salts and stuff in his bathtub (which is coincidentally one of my hobbies too ^-^;;)

       Here is Nikki's review of her favorite anime of all time THE PRINCE OF TENNIS!!!!!!! The story takes place in Japan when a mysterious boy shows up from America.  Sakuno, a young girl invited to visit her grandmother at the tennis gardens, is riding on the subway when a loudmouthed braggart decides to show off his tennis moves in the car, nearly striking Sakuno's face with his racket.  A boy sitting across from her tells the guy to shut up and says that the man has his grips all wrong.  Afterwards, at the subway station, Sakuno is waiting for her grandmother to pick her up when the boy approaches her again.  He asks her for the directions to the tennis gardens that she is going to.  Unknowingly, she gives him the wrong directions.  Just as he walks past her, she notices that on his tennis racket bag, his name is printed clearly on it.  His name is Echizen Ryoma.  Later, at the tennis gardens, Sakuno realizes that she made a mistake in the directions she gave him, making Ryoma late and disqualified at the tournament he was going to.  She apologizes as soon as she sees him but they are interrupted when the same loudmouthed braggart from the subway (Sasabe) tries to hit Ryoma with his can of pop.  Annoyed at being lectured publicly in the subway, Sasabe decides to challenge Ryoma to a match, positive that he can beat the twelve-year old and embarrass him.  Ryoma beats Sasabe easily even though he was struck in the face with Sasabe's racket (which he threw out of rage when he was about to lose).  Sakuno's grandmother reveals that Ryoma is actually a tennis prodigy from America who has won five consecutive titles and won all the tournaments he's been in.  He is known as the Prince of Tennis.  Thus begins the adventures of Ryoma and the different matches he must face in order to be the best of the best.  He joins his school team, Seigaku, and meets new friends.  Faithfully, they stick side by side and fight to win a place in the All-Japan tournament.  This is by far my most favorite anime.  Don't think that it sucks just because it's all about a sport.  It's really good.  It has a comedic and serious side too.  I think this anime has the best music ever too.  The characters are all very interesting and very different, making you feel like you can bond with any one of them.  I suggest you watch this anime if you want a break from all those fantasy adventure and magic type of anime.  Stay tuned for Nikki's review of all the characters.

       Check out this review I got.  I'm a bit confused since my story is fanfiction and i dont own the characters...O.o;;  Maybe I should take up this man's offer.  I mean, it's always been my dream to become an author at the age of 13.  From: Jack Prowl()  Very delightful story you have going so far. I am the editor of a the "Start Off Authors" company, maybe you've heard of me? Anyway, I think you're story was very original and contained a lot of depth into what you write, congratulations on a nice begining to (if you are planning to go that far) an outstanding fiction. If you want your writing to maybe go somewhere, you can contact me at Start Off Authors Inc., Editorial section 895883, London Ontario, Canada

       Love starts with a smile, grows with a kiss,  and ends with a tear.    Don't cry over anyone who won't cry over you.    If love isn't a game, why are there so many players?    Good friends are hard to find, harder to leave,  and impossible to forget.    You can only go as far as you push.    Actions speak louder than words.    The hardest thing to do is watch the one you love,  love somebody else.    Don't let the past hold you back; you're missing the good stuff.    Life's short. If you don't look around  once in a while you might miss it.    A BEST FRIEND is like a four leaf clover,  HARD TO FIND and LUCKY TO HAVE.    Some people make the world SPECIAL just by being in it.    BEST FRIENDS are the siblings God forgot to give us.    When it hurts to look back,  and you're scared to look ahead,  you can look beside you and your  BEST FRIEND will be there.    TRUE FRIENDSHIP "NEVER" ENDS.  Friends are FOREVER.    Good friends are like stars.... You don't always see them,  but you know they are always there.    Don't frown. You never know who is falling in love with your smile.    What do you do when the only person who can  make you stop crying is the  person who made you cry?    Nobody is perfect until you fall in love with them.    Everything is okay in the end. If it's not okay, then it's not the end.    Most people walk in and out of you life,  only friends leave footprints in your heart.

       but the thing is, is that, the money sint for the school just fro its self..they already get enough from the parents...(p.s. im tlaking abou charging us fo drinks and glowsticks i agree wiht the uniform thingie that you were talking about nikki) and then there is that alumni thinge where you pay some amount of money and then they ,mention you and thta crappy magazine thing "Rendez-Vous" we have  that gets sent to us...but the money that we paay for grub days and the money they charge..that goes usually to fund raising..like war child and osaid. and the money we payed for the dance was going to the dj and the decoration and getting the glowsticks..but for the uniform thing, i totally agree..but you can get gray pants from somwehre and they let you where them..the administration never commented oin what i wore before so there are normal grey pants out there that arent for 80 bucks....its cheaper than that...

       You're right.  It was wrong but fun at the same time.  Except for the fact that TFS tried to suck more money out of us by charging for drinks and food *cough cough* and blocked off every single exit to a water fountain followed by the fact that most people didn't bring their money and had to resort to drinking tap water.  Stupid TFS, those greedy and avaricious monkeys only interested in monetary matters.  Damn them!  Daaaaaamn them!  I'm going to write an article to the school newspaper on how the school charges us all the time and how stupid it is (uniforms are really overpriced and if students buy a cheaper kind it's considered out of uniform,  charging outrageous prices for food, charging ppl so that they can use the photocopier, not being able to use your cell phone in the building which pretty much forces you to use their payphone and finding more sinister and evil ways to charge more money.)  I rest my case.

       Eeeexcellent...more Prince of Tennis episodes have been released.  Mmm...more Ryoma and Seigaku-ness.   lol.  Nikki:  Help me improve my tennis, Ryoma Ryoma: Yada (No way) Nikki: ... Ryoma: ... Nikki:  Teach me. Ryoma: Yada Nikki:  Yes. Ryoma: No Nikki: Yes Ryoma: No [After a few hours] Ryoma: >. Nikki:  Yeah!  Constant annoyingness emerges victorious once again Ryoma:  Stand over there across the court and I'll check your form [cool music starts playing] Ryoma: *serves* unh...! [Ball flies across in slow motion while Nikki runs slowly to the ball to hit it with her racket.] Nikki: *falls on the floor and misses* blast... Ryoma:  ... Nikki:  Let's just forget this and try again. Ryoma: *serves again* fine Nikki: *runs towards the ball, gets hit in the face with it, falls down* blast...again... Ryoma:  Mada Mada Dane (No, not yet...) Nikki: Triple blast...

       I saw Leah after the dance.  I tell you it was not a pretty sight.  She was lurching about and very tipsy.  Her face was red and her eyes were bloodshot.  Her face looked like a battlefield of acne.  Each zit, each pimple that was on her face was highlighted burning red.  I was standing next to Laura when Leah sort of sashayed her way over.  I could smell her stinking breath from where I was standing.  It was so terrifying.  I think that was the first time that I've ever seen someone drunk.  Her voice was all crackly and she was talking really loudly and declaring she was drunk in front of a ring of oblivious teachers.  I almost pissed my pants (well, dress.  lol, michelle).  Never, ever drink to excess.  It plays with your mind and leaves you with the title of the ass of the asses (I mean it in the donkey way).

       Wait, I just found out from nick, leah and Stacey were caught drinking Vodka at the Dance and were suspended. Leah couldn't keep her balance because she was drunk thats how they got caught. Stacey's boyfriend was not suspended, my mistake.

       I read an article in a book about theories on how people fall in love with each other ( Encyclopoedia of Aggravation).  There was one which was quite interesting.  Some people believe that we fall for people that have a special immune system that's different than ours.  Scientists believe that there is some sort of "radar" in us that allows humans to determine the best mate.  By choosing a mate with a good immune system, the children that are born become stronger.  The cycle repeats itself over and over again and humans gradually become stronger through breeding.  O.o;; This completely scarred me for a few days.  Does this mean that in order to be loved, one has to catch a lot of diseases and become immune to them.  Talk about being desperate.  And the thought of the fact that humans are breeding themselves is sort of disgusting...I guess this is what they call the cycle of life.  It's a harsh world out there.  Only the strong survive and the weak are left to die.

       Every episode of south park, kenny gets killed. HEre is one of my favourites of when he dies:  Cartman is at home in his bed because he is taking home-schooling. Kenny, Kyle and Tommy visit Cartman. Cartman has a real monkey that helps him spell that he bought in a package. The monkey plays the drums and is beside Cartmans bed:  Kyle: Hey Cartman, how's home-schooling doing?  Cartman: Its fucking great you guys (conversation is going on)  Meanwhile, the monkey savagely jumps at kenny and starts poundin on him and raming him into the wall, finally Kenny dies.  Kyle and Tommy: OMG, THE LEARNING MONKEY KILLED KENNY!  Cartman: Damn right.

       Dammit!  Gunbound's server is so freaking slow and crappy!  Argh!  At least it's free but they could at least try and do something with it.  I mean, most of the players I've talked to say that their comps are lagging a lot too.  PS I find it gross that someone would want Adam's body *shudder*

       I was playing Gunbound today when i met this kid that was 13 years old.  We talked while we blasted each other to smithereens and i soon found out what a pervert he was.  He asked if i had a bf and i told him to go away.  He then said that he already had a gf in real life but want a Gunbound gf too.  I told him to leave me alone.  Later, in a different game, he asked where i was from.  i answered Canada and he said the same.  He then said he was from toronto.  I said i was from Toronto as well.  He then asked which school i was from.  I responded tfs.  He then said, "No fucking shit!  I'm from tfs too!  I'm in gr 7!".  His girlfriend is apparently that ugly blonde girl with disgusting pink streaks that i hate.  He says his name is Gordon but i didnt give my own name.  If anyone knows this gr 7 creep, stay away from him.  He said that he;s planning on raping me.  O.o;;

       I've been thinking about learning how to make flash animation shows to do on the internet.  Like those cartoons.  Like Devil Doll, Killfrog, Awesome Hour (we are in fraaance) and more.  I still want to think of an idea before actually learning though...I was thinking something along the lines of TFS Survivor.  Each episode will feature a different teacher as an "obstacle".  Or maybe that's not a funny idea?  I'd like to do something really funny and random... Ooooh!  I know! Heheheh....

       This song always remind me of Daniel for some reason.  Maybe it's just Gerardo's accent.  I used to find this song extremely annoying but it grew on me.  Wouldn't it be hilarious if Spanish class had to present this as a song instead of Muralla?  he's a Spanglish rapper!  XD  Rico Suave Gerardo  Seguro que han oído que yo soy educado Soy un caballerito un chico bien portado Un joven responsible y siempre bien vestido Yo no se quien ha mentido  I don't drink or smoke ain't into dope Won't try no coke, ask me how I do it, I cope My only addiction has to do with the female species I eat 'em raw like sushi  No me gustan ternos, mi estilo es moderno Si me enterno, you me enfermo Mi apariencia es dura, vivo en la locura No me vengan con ternuras  So please don't judge a book by its cover There's more to being a latin lover You got to know how to deal with a woman That won't let go The price you pay for being a gigolo  There's not a woman that can handle A man like me That's why I juggle two or three I ain't one to commit, you can omit that bit You pop the question that's it Haber uno, dos, tres, cuatro mujeres Y la situaci?all?no muere No es un delito calmo mi apetito Con un llanto o un grito  So again don't let my lyrics mislead you I don't love you but I need you Would you rather have me lie Take a piece of your pie and say bye Or be honest and rub your thighs  Well, it's ten o'clock and I'm two hours late I never said I was a prompt date But you kept persisting that I meet your parents Huh, they're going to love my appearance  Ding dong el timbre suena Tu madre abre, que vieja mas buena Le digo ¡Hola! Pero no para bola Que se ha creido vieja chola  Go and serve the food mom Que tengo ambre If you don't hurry, me va a dar un calambre Y usted señor? Why's your chin on the floor? Sierra la boca por favor  What's this amor, these little huevos? Esto s?que yo no pruebo  I'm used to good ol' fashioned Homestyle Spanish cooking If i try that I'll be puking Well it's been a pleasure but we got to go Regresaremos temprano Cinco, seis, o siete de la mañana Su hija esta en buenas manos

       I totally agree.  It was a good movie..but still...its so friggen long!At least its the last one so next year it wont be nomminated for anything..then other movies will get a chance to win.  But the best part of the Oscars were Will Ferrel and Jack Black singing the "lyrics" to that song when they cut you off.    "Look at Catherine Zeta-Jones, she's snoring" haha

       How one-sided were the Oscars?  It was TERRIBLE!  Does LOTR really deserve ELEVEN awards.  I understand that it was excellently made but ELEVEN?!?!?!  If you add up all the awards that the LOTR series has received, you'd get about 21.  Come on, people.  Don't just stick on one movie because the first one was good.  Move on, times change.

       Wow, you won't believe what we're doing every single night to pass the time.  We rent hundreds of movies to watch.  So far I've seen Sweet November, The Hulk, Matchstick Men, Underworld, Mystery Men, Mona Lisa Smile, and Sylvia.  Sweet November and Mona Lisa Smile were excellent.  Those and Sylvia were my mother's choices.  My father chose Matchstick Men (I didn't like it.  I found the end sort of disturbing to my mind).  Underworld and Mystery Men were my choice.  Underworld is probably the best movie out of all of them.  It was sooooo good!!!  I watched it again and again.  Wonderful effects and acting!!  Mystery Men was very funny too.  I didn't really like The Hulk though (my brother's choice).  So far, we've bought two video games for GBA SP.  The Sims and Onimusha Tactics.  I've been having my eyes on a new Harvest Moon game I've been lusting for for a long time.  Hmm...wonder if I have saved up enough money to buy it as I haven't seen it in Canada yet.  It's very warm down here.  ^_^ I can finally wear my t-shirts.  Well, see you all!  Keep in touch!

       Greetings from Georgia  At last, internet access and a connection to sweet sweet home, Canada.  This is such bliss :3 Unfortunately I have to stay here until the end of the first week of March Break.  Can you believe that the ppl here have already had their Spring Break one week before us and it lasted for only one week?!  I really won't like that when if i ever go to Pace Academy.  You won't believe how much nicer it is than TFS.  Sure there are uniforms but they only wear those four times a year.  All the other days are casual.  Assemblies are held every morning at 8:00 ( I can't wake up then.  I'll be late every morning. *sigh*).  Their library is amazingly huge too.  I still think that if I ever went there I'd miss TFS a lot too.  Besides, everything there looks so...old.  The buildings in which all the important staff members are is called the "Castle".  Students who have been at Pace since childhood are "lifers".  The "Minstrels" and "Troubadors" are the choir.  It's sort of sad how they think that they're so Medieval Age-like.  However, I'd give anything to study drama or perform in that theater of theirs.  It's absolutely gorgeous ^_^.  Moving along, we ate at a nmber of interesting restaurants and went sight-seeing a bit.  I got to see the world's first KFC!  Yay!  How exciting!  Did you know that there was also a KFC hotel in the first place?  I now know the entire history of this popular fast-food place.  Muaha!  Colonel Sanders was actually quite the marketing genius.  I laughed so hard when I saw antique action figures of him on display. It seems that everywhere I look in Atlanta, Coca-Cola is there.  Perhaps because they are all so proud to be the birthplace of the miracle pop.  In fact, my interviewer for Pace says that her hudsband works for Coke and that she herself spoke fluent Chinese in order to go to China to promote the drink.  We also ate a a really awesome Asian restaurant (there seems to be a shortage of that in Atlanta).  It was in a boxcar.  Can you believe that?  The box car is still in it's station and ready to run but it's been shut off and turned into a restaurant.  The sushi there was wonderful (yay!  Pass the raw fish!  Sashimi!).  I ate lots of spiders and caterpillar rolls.  Mmm... heheh...Spiders are actually just the soft-shell crabs renamed that as a joke.  And the caterpillar rolls?  Just a line of sushi covered by avocado to make it look like a caterpillar.  I dont eat bugs dont worry.  It seems that my father knew all the people at the restaurant.  I blushed when some of the waiters said I was pretty in Chinese (they thought i didnt understand but i showed them!  MUAHAHAHA!).  I met my father's customer and had to act like the good little girl.  Unfortunately, I might need to do a little babysitting for him in order to win his favors for my father.  I found it insulting when he complemented me though.  Here's how the conversation went.  Customer:  You know who your daughter reminds me of, David? Pocahontas. Dad:*perplexed* Pokemon?! Me: *choke on soup* Customer:  No, Pocahontas.  It's a complement.  She's gorgeous.  Here, Carly (daughter).  Doesnt Nicole look like Pocahontas? Carly: *looks at me* No.. Customer: ... Me: *thinking* Isn't Pocahontas an Native American?  Are my eyes really as slitted as hers.  Sheesh.  That's not really a complement.  You could have said Mulan.  That would have been more subtle...  I miss you all so much!  How are all your breaks coming along?  I want every single detail!       No way do I look like her. NO WAY!    This could've worked... >.

Well, the problem is that I can't leave the comp because I'm listening to my favorite songs.  Muahahahah!  Bother, we're losing an hour this weekend.  Crud, that's one hour less of sleep.

       Now, they found the truth but what to do now?  I feel sick.  I feel like I've felt the smell of a rotten putrid corpse.  The corpse of an innocent.  The corpse of a child.  Is this the world that we live in?  Is this the hell that we call society?  What is so "civilized" about our world?  The Earth seems like a painting, something the artist wants you to see.  From far away, the Earth seems so pristine and clean.  Closer, you notice the kind people.  Closer than that, you see the dark pit in their hearts.  Who cries now for the lost girl?  Who cries?  I see people walking by, looking at their own shoes.  They're reading the newspaper with the picture of her pure face plastered on it.  What do they care?  It's not their problem.  What can they do?  Nothing.  It's all just some more juicy gossip that will last them for a week.  Ask them what they feel for the parents.  "Terrible," they respond monotously with their dry eyes.  "Too bad," they think.  "This happens everyday around the world, it's best not to dwell on it," someone once said to me.  Basically, the world has run out of hope and it's best not to think about the bad things that always happen.  Wonderful, our world that is.  Bad things happen all the time so everyone's heart is already as hard as diamonds.  So pretty to look at, so nice to have.  It's only for show.  Science is demanding for more progress!  Faster!  Faster!  What for?  What's the reason?  Have we not lost ourselves enough with our theories and inventions?  I want to scream.  Stop!  Make the world stop!  STOP!  Can you not at least pause to think about the young and innocent we've lost?  Can you not spare a minute to shed a tear or two or is it too much trouble?  Whoever's reading now, cry!  Cry for the girl who never got to know what it was like to become a woman.  Cry for the girl who never got to experience marriage or have her own children!  Cry now for the parents who have lost their one treasure!  And what for? Because of the many disgusting foul creatures that dare call themselves human, that dare call themselves living!  I beg you all now.  Please, tonight, spare at least ten minutes to think of this poor girl and her family.  Do not only think of this girl but think of all the others too like Holly Jones and many more.  Please, cry for them.  The next time you complain about life, think of them and try to enjoy both the sad and happy parts of life for their sake.  We are all fervently hoping for the safety of all the brilliant young girls out there to watch out for themselves.

       For all Zelda fans, this is a must-see spoof of the video game.  Long live chocolate!  LegendaryFrog did an excellent job.  There are two hidden scenes in the credits (sooo funny).  The chocolate hidden scene is funny too.  Even people who haven't seen Zelda would understand this, so have fun.  Doo doo doo doo doo doo DOO doo DOO doo doo doo!  http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view.php?id=105053     HERE ARE THE LOCATIONS FOR THE HIDDEN SCENES IF YOU CAN'T FIND THEM.  DO NOT LOOK FURTHER IF YOU WANT TO FIND THE SCENES YOURSELF.  DJ Luke rocks the house: click on the t-shirt of the man holding the flower Chocolate: Click the Ganon plushie a few times

       Yes, I know.  There are just some people that don't deserve the miracles of plastic surgery.  Some people are already pretty much good-looking and I don't see what the point is in "upgrading".  Imperfections are what makes the human beautiful.  The ability to accept imperfections is the best there is.  People who just want plastic surgery for no reason disgust me.  The only people that deserve plastic surgery are the ones that suffer from burns, have been in car crashes or have terrible scars from sickness.  Why is it that everyone wants to be like perfect celebrities?  Holy crap, Michael Jackson is like a plastic scarecrow with no brains for crying out loud.  Do they really want to be like him?  -_- For shame, people.  For shame.

       ...right... O_o I started to watch Jungle Wa Itsumo Hale Nochi Guu (Phew!) My fav. character is probably the mysteriously hilarious Guu whose laughter is mechanic.  I absolutely love the way she is drawn and I die laughing whenever she does something weird.  The way she say "Itai (ow)" is also mechanic and without feeling, which makes it even more funny.  Yes, I love Guu even though she eats everything from swords to plates.

       I can't believe I'm the only girl in TFS that plays Ragnarok Online and Gunbound.  I need someone to play with!  Waaaah!  I'm also one of the few(and proud)geeky anime fans at school(though Daniel would never call himself as geeky and obsessive as me in anime).  In short, ANYONE please play with me!  My account on Ragnarok Online is called Lady Capulet (The name of ultimate geekiness i know).  My account on Gunbound is called Erline.  Help!

This blog has a total of 11 members (including me in that count) and no one is posting?  We've pulled through grade 7 together on this blog.  Let's finish up grade 8 in a grand flourish to show our dedication to this blog.  I can't believe some people just joined and never posted up a single thing.  >:( I'm afraid I can't let anyone be able to be proud of being on this blog if they never post.  You can't just join for the sake of bragging that you're on this site.  You have to help somehow to help it grow and blossom.  >_ :D
