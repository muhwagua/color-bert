      Had a four-hour break from the office today. We had to get out because they were painting the 5th floor and all the fumes got in the vents. Like all other  Pinoys , we went to the mall. hahahahaha!  Thought about watching  Mano Po  and struggle with Kris Aquino's one facial expression. (No matter how much she screws up her face, there's just one expression there). But thought better of it and saw  Dekada '70 . That was screwy - I began to hate the Marcoses all over again.......  The image that keeps replaying itself over and over again in my head is Jhong Hilario's torture scene.....I want my mommy.....

      This is it.   Finally got myself some space in this cyber-reality. Got myself a virtual-diary. Oh come on, don't be so dismissive. This is what these things are. If I know,  kayo din naghahanap ng lakas ng loob para gumawa ng ganito. Tama na yang kaartehan nyo . If you, like, think that I'm  seeeew  pathetic that I, like, have to broadcast my emotions to the  madla , do me a favor. Go offline. Find a book and make yourself more literate. The earth will thank you, and who knows? You could pass yourself off as something more than a half-wit.       Where was I? Oh yes, my virtual diary. I spend more than 10 hours online and I figure that this is much safer way of venting. Better a program than my boss. Less chance of getting fired. I need the money. Those shoes don't geow on trees, you know. They don't come cheap. Note to self: remember to write down forays into shoe retail....      I promise to   TRY   to not be too melodramatic. The operative word is try. I will TRY.   urlLink )"  title="Comments by SquawkBox.tv"> javascript:SquawkBoxCount( )

      complete (col. 2:9,10)  (t. mccloud)  if i lay my voice down at Your feet  will you still hear my song echoing  that i might end this game of hide and seek because in You i am complete  oh in You i am complete  all the voices i hear in my sleep  all the sins of my past whispering  to stay off my knees and on my feet  oh but they, they can't compete  cause in You i am complete   I sent this song to Jonathan, believing that he'd realize how much I love him. He sent back something which basically said thet he didn't believe I felt that way. Ouch.   I don't much believe in happily-ever-after, especially for me. There is no such thing. And I never believed that there was one special person out there for me; neither did I put much trust in my relatives' belief that I would get marrried. Never. But with Jon, it was different. I would have walked the ends of the earth for this guy. I would have turned my back on everything that was home and gone with him. He only had to ask. That was the only thing he had to do. I would have sacrificed everything.  EVERYTHING   It's all over now. I haven't heard from him in weeks and now, my heart is broken. Where I never believed I was capable of suffering for someone else's happiness, now I do.   I loved fully, and honestly, and truthfully when I fell in love with Jonathan David Oldhouser. And he didn't love me back. Never again. I will never, never love again.  Shop's closed. Love don't live here anymore.

      Here we are again, fast approaching the most man-made of holidays (is it even that?!) - Valentine's. I remember being alone for most of the February 14s in my lifetime, but I cannot remember being this sad. I cannot think of how I'll be on that day....  I've been with Jonathan for almost 3 years and while we've gone through spells of not talking to one another, it has never lasted this long. And I've always had e-mail....Why do guys do this?   He has told me he loves me. And I do know him well enough to know that he means it. Then how come I practically have to beg for his attention? I'm standing on the verge of just ringing him up to hear his voice. Am I so insignificant to him that he thinks nothing of ignoring me?

      Just got hold of a book by Randolf S. David (Prof. Randy David, to us inhabitanats of the P.I.). I forgot what is was called, but it was a collection of the articles he had written for the  Philippine Daily Inquirer . Everything was good. They were all cleverly written and I felt as if the good professor were reading the entries to me as I read them. For one who is extremely passionate about what he teaches and his convictions for the motherland, Prof. David is a very soft-spoken man. Very malumanay.....  I, on the other hand, belong to the school of thought that believes that passion is best expressed with noise. Plus, my statements are often punctuated with gesticulations that, if done by someone lighter, would cause that individual to take flight. As Jessica Zafra said: If you can't dazzle them with artistry, drown them with noise.......  You should all get a copy of Professor David's book....It's available at the Sociology Department of the University of the Philippines. 250 Pesos, I think....

      I'm currently watching JOSH GROBAN (everytime I write his name, I do it in all-caps, I can't help it) on MYX. I'm all a-quiver. Andrea Corr just came on - I want to kill this woman. I take consolation in the fact that when a local DJ was asked if she was really as beautiful as she looks on print and TV, he said  "make up is a wonderful thing."  Tee-hee.  Because I am currently preoccupied, I'll write in you later.

      Conversation with one of the coolest people I know:     fairytales_320: hi, i have 10 min to talk, so this will be my "e-mailing pia" time :D thursdayschildtoo: i don't get it...but ok fairytales_320: i have an audition later on today that i need to get sleep for and i have my play later on today (not to mention that i need to type out 2 more other e-mails b4 i go to bed), so i can't stay up too late (it is 4:15am right now) thursdayschildtoo: ok....um e-mail or talk when you can - i'm always here anyway fairytales_320: silly girl, i am talking to u now...and chatting is better than an e-mail cuz it's interactive. how have u been? thursdayschildtoo: uh....crazy fairytales_320: really? how? thursdayschildtoo: deadlines; updating my blog fairytales_320: so is work kicking your ass? thursdayschildtoo: me....LOL!! like i'd let someone else kick me around fairytales_320: yea, your right...just wanted to hear how much butt "U" were kicking!!! fairytales_320: have been able to be social lately? thursdayschildtoo: no way! the last time i went out was a month ago thursdayschildtoo: this concert by stephen speaks fairytales_320: so, just work and straight home? thursdayschildtoo: basically....play with cats, feed cats, feed self, wash up, sleep fairytales_320: dream about erik ;P thursdayschildtoo: noooo....erik got a girlfriend :p fairytales_320: no! not since jan 26th fairytales_320: but erik is recovering and getting better thursdayschildtoo: before that i meant fairytales_320: so, have u been on any dates since ending your relationship? thursdayschildtoo: nope. not interested anymore thursdayschildtoo: are you recovering ok? fairytales_320: for the most part. i fall back into my lapses, but i am trying to keep myself occupied and get things going w/my life. still it is hard cuz i was in love w/her (my 1st), so i still replay everything in my head fairytales_320: u? thursdayschildtoo: that's how it is with first times thursdayschildtoo: i really don't think i'll ever recover fairytales_320: wow, even after talking w/me!?! ;) thursdayschildtoo: you know what i mean fairytales_320: even though it is set up for that ever important "1st time" i think that if you allow yourself to feel again and take that risk that it will happen. i know that the "1st time" moment has really been built up, so try to releaze that that is not the "end all, be all", but u r an intelligent and awesome person, so life will totally work out for u thursdayschildtoo: nope. it took me this long to finally fall in love. i hate that i was taken for granted when i put in every effort. thursdayschildtoo: the fall out is too horrible.  thursdayschildtoo: and that's easy for you to say erik - you've never been ugly fairytales_320: i can definitely feel u on that, but realize that there r 5 1/2 billion people out there and along the way u run into jerks and people that don't appreciate who u r and what u do. it's a learning process and u have to keep going and learn from everything. it's ok to take the time to learn about someone and keep the guard up for that, but don't let yourself be so hurt or get so jaded that u never let yourself take that chance again thursdayschildtoo: how do you know who is or isn't the jerk? fairytales_320: ok, i've definitely felt ugly for many moments in my life and i know what u look like, so don't even say that u r ugly. i think that the little things in life count and someone that is able to recognize and sincerely appreciate those things is someone that isn't a jerk. i think that in that instance it is clear to see if one is being fake about that  thursdayschildtoo: not really....sometimes the level of like/lust is too high to judge clearly fairytales_320: i see that point, but i think that through time and events that u go through, it becomes more apparent (even with those "goggles" on) and u see the true content of character and personality cuz evn the best of con artists can't maintain "fakeness: through-out the course of time thursdayschildtoo: i hope so...for your sake at least fairytales_320: yours too, u better not shut down that great heart of yours thursdayschildtoo: you deserve perfection fairytales_320: before i can be worthy of derserving anything, i need to be able to be satisfied with me and who i am thursdayschildtoo: good point thursdayschildtoo: although self worth is indirectly determined by other's perception of you fairytales_320: indirectly...but a significant other should be the compliment of an already complete person thursdayschildtoo: good point. although useless info to me fairytales_320: so, that fundamental sense of self worth should already be in place fairytales_320: give yourself more credit pia...u r a cute girl with great intelligence, personality and an awesome heart thursdayschildtoo: yup...that's me: the cute girl full of personality fairytales_320: don't give me that sarcastic shit!!! thursdayschildtoo: and don't yell at me! fairytales_320: do u know how much props u need ot give yourself for being able to communicate so clearly with me while living in a foreign country that speaks such a foreign language fairytales_320: i wasn't yelling..just emphasizing fairytales_320: that is a hard thing to do thursdayschildtoo: it comes from watching years of sesame street. fairytales_320: ha  :p fairytales_320: what r u thinking? thursdayschildtoo: reading my blog thursdayschildtoo: *sesame street should win a nobel prize for something fairytales_320: yea, i agree...what is a "blog"? thursdayschildtoo: online journal fairytales_320: am i in it?  :"> thursdayschildtoo: i'm probably gonna put this up there later thursdayschildtoo: i'm saving this conversation fairytales_320: ok, cool thursdayschildtoo: do you mind? fairytales_320: well, i have to unfortunately say that i must go, but please realize that u r a great human and i am very happy that i know u and look very forward to the day that i get to meet u in person and give u a great big hug... no, i don't mind thursdayschildtoo: thanks erik....i'll see you online soon thursdayschildtoo: thankyou fairytales_320: my address is .....erik collins (U WISH I'D POST THIS, DON'T YOU??) so mail me a letter and pix and i wil wirte u back, ok? thursdayschildtoo: Pia Garcia (DREAM ON) fairytales_320: good night (day :) ) thursdayschildtoo: you too, friend thursdayschildtoo: be safe..... thursdayschildtoo: break a leg     Thanks, Erik.

      Horoscopes are crap and this proves it. This was in the  urlLink Manila Standard  yesterday:    Libra:  You long to renew a relationship but view responsibilities with caution.  This state of affairs tends to sabotage your love life.  Give romance another chance. Aquarius plays a part.   Bullshit.  I'm at work, blogging when I should be working (again). I'm not really sure if I even qualify as someone who has a horoscope since I was born on the cusp. But I laways read mine because it never matches the crap that's going on in my life anyway, but that one yesterday just made me suck in my breath. I wonder if he even thinks of me because that's all I do at night - think of him. I've given up hoping.  Basta , all I know is that there is no space left for me in his life. And that is what will kill me....  Ended up texting all night with my BFF, Roxanne (WTF, I'm twenty-freakin'-five and I still use that acronym) because her mom is Satan's successor.  I hate her her mom . Roxy's freakin' amazing and she doesn't deserve that harpy. I hope Roxy gets to be dirty, rotten, filthy, stinkin' rich and her mom swallows her tongue.   I hate feeling envious by the way. I hate the feeling inspred by that most famous of all muses - the green-eyed monster.   I dreamt about Tricia's hunny. We were sitting next to each other and we were talking. I was speaking in  taglish , but I think he understood me. He showed me his wallet and I opened it and saw that it was full of photos of fans - in my dream I found it strange that it was full of photos of people from my high school. But when  woke up, all I remembered was that the wallet he handed me was pink. I woke up and the first thing I yelled was  "GET HIM OUT OF MY SUBCONSCIOUS!!!!" .   There are still more feelings, but it's still in one big knot....I'm unraveling myself later.     [ mood ] craving.

      Her name is  urlLink Saara , and this is her Blog.   From her  March 24  entry:  I keep dreaming of you and things are the way they are now: I'm engaged to someone else, you've been out of touch for so long. We see each other - I think I've flown all the way there to see you only I cannot remember getting on/off a plane but there we are, and I pretend that it's all good, that I still don't get that sharp pain sometimes when I think of us, and you're being good, not just good, great: charming, sweet - all the things I loved you for. And I ask you those questions I've been wanting to for, ooh, 3 years now and you tell me truthfully that you were scared. We laugh and are so easy together. Your hair is longer and darker, curly even, you let the streaks of blonde grow out. I run my fingers through it playfully and it feels just the way it used to, thick and silky. You take my hand in yours and see my ring and then it hits me: we can't just run away and pretend it was all a bad dream. I have someone else now, someone not afraid to love me and make sacrifices for me. I tell you how good he is to me and you smile sadly, you know you missed your chance. I tell you you could have called me, could have let me know you were still mine all this time, but you tell me I should have known .     It hurts less now to think of you, less than last year, or the one before . Less than that last night we spent together where I felt I was tearing in two. Where we sat in our apartment and smoked and watched the snow outside swirl around the streetlight. I wished time would stand still, swore I would not sleep, but in the end I was exhausted from crying all week, and there was to be no last-minute reprieve. You held it together so well - you'd only ever cried that once, three months earlier, when I was trying to decide whether to go home then or stay for New Year's, the millennium and I asked you what you wanted and you said me. We slept badly that last night, I kept waking up to see the time. Finally we awoke at 5 and you were doing a great job of keeping me preoccupied until you found the card I had made for you and you collapsed on our bed, sobbing, clutching my t-shirt. We drove to the airport in swirling snow and I hoped for a moment that my plane would be grounded, but then it was only prolonging the pain. You watched me smoke my last cigarette outside the airport and snowflakes landed on my lashes and froze with my tears. You said we'd be together again but somewhere deep down I knew it was over...

      I don't like it when people take manners for granted. I cannot stand it when people assume that we are so close that basic graces are overlooked. I would never do that. It makes me want to go  .  I want to go home because I'll be able to lay my head on my pillow. But I don't want to because my dad will be there.   My home was solace before he came. Everything there was comfort...now it's just purgatory.   See you tomorrow.

      What's happening today....  Checking out a singles site and I just saw the most incredible guy. He looked like he belonged on the cover of a romance novel....I sent in a response to his ad. No expectations of course. I'm through with being hopeful. No point in getting all worked up over something useless, right?  I just got out of a really harrowing relationship. And the word relationship in this case is very loosely - I treated it seriously and he didn't. I think the word "love" was even used a few times, but it was always initiated by yours truly. I should've taken the hint from there and just run in the opposite direction, but I didn't. See, when you're blinded by overwhelming infatuation you really can't think straight. You're so blinded about the prospect of  what could be  with the other person that you think the world is a shiny, happy place. Then of course some redneck had the audacity to declare war. sheesh.  I keep thinking,   at what point does the world recognize that only people who are beautiful have the right to fall in love and have their happily-ever-afters  ? I've been ensnared in this mortal coil for 25 years and have yet to find someone who will walk the ends of the earth for me. I would love to be part of that entire scene. Don't get me wrong, I still don't buy the  "you're other half is out there"  bullshit. Because think of it this way, what happens if you don't find each other? Regardless of your efforts to find him/her of course. Because let's face it, you have to work hard for something that's gonig to be worth keeping, right? If you don't find   The One  , what happens then? Do you live half a life? Do you love people by halves? And what about the empty half of you? Does it wither and die? Someone who's in the know, please explain it to me.  [ mood ] sleepy as hell [ mental turntable ]  Walkin' On Broken Glass  by Annie Lennox

      On this day:  *  War started - possibly even world war III.   We don't know really.  Too early to tell. *  My dad's birthday. I know I should be home...but I'm too freaking lazy.  I went through 3 different templates before settling on this.  It's nice.  Looks all summery.  I hate avocados, though. Can we put a cat up there?

      I exist in the crossroads of humanity.   I live at a time where I am untouched by war and yet I see it all around me. I am surrounded by depressing misery and yet I am able to laugh and go to sleep at night.   How am I so unaffected by all of this that I can feel empathy one minute and apathy the next? Shouldn't I be so mad that I'm out in the streets doing something instead of being in here and writing about this time in my life?   I hate this war. I hate that my family will suffer because of one man's inability to admit that he was fallibale - that he was human. Mortal. Just like me. And mortality includes times when you must suffer and be weak. I hate the fact that when this is over he will still be protected and his family will be safe while people who couldn't afford this war in the first place will be suffering. I hate that most of all. I hate him because he took the choice away from me.

       Tanong lang.  How long has  Dawson's Creek  been running? 5 years? Then why the HELL do Joey and Dawson keep running after each other at train stations and/or bridges and/or airports just to say "don't go"?  Nyeeeeeta naman o.   Even the local teen-dramas in the PI are better than that. At least here, someone gets plotted against by the other girl who has a crush on the boyfriend of the terminally nice heroine, who ends up being kidnapped and then rescued by the crush-boy only that the CB gets shot by the kidnapper who actually has a crush on the TNH but only kidnapped TNH because the OT brainwashed him.  Tapos  now, TNH and CB are supposed to get married but TNH is having second thoughts (after 5 seasons!!!!) because she was played false before.  YAN ang plot! YAN ang drama!  Suspension of disbelief  talaga!   Dawson's Creek  has nothing on the scriptwriting skills of the people behind  Tabing Ilog.    I don't watch TI. I only see it on the afternoons where I'm in the office and we're having  merienda  in the cafeteria. In between bites I ask Meryl,  "Sino si _____? Anong nangyari sa kanya? Bakit sha aalis? O. Sino naman yan? Asan na si _____?"  It's the same thing with those  telenovelas  everyone around me is so into. In college I remember being so hooked on  "La Usurpadora"  and  "Maria Isabel"  - not because they had original plots, but because those guys were cute.  Sabi nga ni  soulmate: God bless Mexico! Maybe the writers of DC should come over here and take workshops  para naman bago mag -end  yung baduy na  series  nila, tumabo naman ang ratings .  Susmaryosep talaga!   Ah. Theory to the DC thing.  Baka naman  it's the prequel to My Best Friend's Wedding.  Di ba  after the scene at the train station, everything went downhill?  Ganon din sa  DC. After Joey ran to Dawson the second time, I was tempted to sue. They should just change the theme of the entire thing and just name it   Pacey  . He has the most personality anyway. Dawson looks like Glenn Close.   I love tagalog. Nothing beats the language when it comes to insulting things.  Another thing, coming down from valium is not fun. I took some last night due to migraines and slept wonderfully. I woke up this morning and felt like I was underwater. I am so depressed it's not even funny. And it's not the depression that makes me do wonderful, creative things. I'm just sitting here like a rock. And it can't be cured by something from Sucre. esh.  I came across  urlLink Sarah's  April 28th entry and laughed myself hoarse. True.

      This was taken from an entitled "Runaway" written by Trina Dela Rama and was published in DLSU's literary portfolio, "Malate" several years back. I promised Agnes I'd post the entire thing, but it was too long.  Here are the parts which I relate to the most. Comments and violent reactions are most welcome.    ...marriage has never been one of my goals.  Sure, it could be nice to maybe get into that someday, but it's not like I'm going to kill myself if I don't get hitched...I really just can't imagine myself with anyone, much less visualize the kind of love that never runs out of things to say.  Try as I might, I cannot surmise how one can find a person that he or she would be able to live with from youth till old age , and be able to love intensely day in and day out, over and above blood relations...marriage to me, at the moment, is defintely something I don't need to be happy.  It's a nice dream, but like any pleasant dream, it requires too much thought, decision, complexity, and perfect characters than I can find or handle right now.    ...Behind the shadows, I find some unrealistic yet comforting solace in the supposed existence of one who will be able to read past the jargon, as others call my words, and know exactly what I am saying.  Idealistic fool that I am, I reserve the heart for the one who will sacrifice even a part of himself to find it.    ...It hurts to feel inadequate and unworthy of someone with all the right qualities, and I don't pretend not to cry at nights knowing that the permanence of loneliness in my life is a big possibility.  But the philosophy that has kept my sanity in check is that there is no point in being miserable about something that is not tangible in my life just yet...I see nothing much that can be done when you don't even see what you want.  If there's another thing I've learned, it's never to settle for anything less than what I need. The sad thing about life is that dreams are usually so cookie-cutter perfect, that people just settle for the closest things to them. They don't believe in the existence and sheer possibilities of their own desires.  Like me, they're probably afraid to...But what does prepare a person for love and desire, pain and loss? Each of un runs from even the things we want, primarily because we are afraid to claim them as ours, of consequently being incapable of keeping them, and of realizing that we are inadequate for their needs and wants.

      I was reading the  urlLink Manila Standard  yesterday evening and came across Karenina Yaptinchay's column, Singles. The first few paragraphs of  urlLink yesterday's column  hit like the proverbial ton of bricks between the eyes.    "The problem with trying to find happiness as a single person is that you would find yourself being pulled by two opposite forces.     One force makes you hope that one day, you would find the person you would love for the rest of your life. The other tells you to get real and live with the statistical fact that there is a possibility, the remoteness of which depends on circumstances surrounding you, of a whole life of singlehood.     Both forces are pulling so hard they can actually tear into a million pieces. They each represent distinct possibilities we all must learn to live with."   I came a cross a similar essay written by a student from DLSU for their annual literary portfolio ( "Runaway"  it was called) through my sister who gave me the book and told me, " Ate , read this. She could be you." I did, and I remember being so struck by it that after reading the essay I couldn't even react to what was written down. How can someone, in a few paragraphs, capture all the knotted feelings you've been harboring? It felt good to finally have someone feel the same way you do. My sister was right, she and I could have been the same person.   [ in my head ] he'd better like it! [ in my ears ]  Thank You  by Dido

      I was running across my list of linked blogs today and looking through their comments page and then I saw  urlLink Steve's  blog through  urlLink Sarah's  (are you following me?). Damn if this guy doesn't own the funniest and most interesting blog I've ever come across. Read his entry titled  "Ten Things I Hate About Julia Stiles"  and see if it doesn't make you laugh.  There was also this bit about him meeting up with an ex after three (?) years. I'm the last person in the world to be talking about love right about now, but it's heartening to see that guys feel the same about past relationships as girls do. Well, him at least. And another guy who will remain nameless for now. And to put that out into the world - it's like hanging up your soul on a clothesline and waiting for public ridicule to come along.   I wanted to comment but I chickened out.  OK, so I'm listening to  urlLink SS  for the bazillionth time. I can't help it. All the (admittedly, overplayed) songs still ellicit the same feelings. Ok, so I was part of the tropical cyclone that was here earlier this month and which followed them around, and I'm not ashamed of that. If I were a fan of someone who was talented but ill-mannered (read: Jewel), I'd be mortified, but they were nice guys.  I don't know why I'm even justifying this. I know of someone who could listen to  All I Have  all day long. Don't even get me started on Jennifer Lopez....  I spent last night crying while texting BFF and  urlLink Tricia . I could go on and on about what was sent through SMS, but as the fear of being overly lachrymose threatens again, I will just say that it was about broken promises. ** I can almost hear  I Can't Make You Love Me  being played in the background. **   Nina's video was just played on the channel. When I first heard this song, I thought the title was  "Palakang Baliw" . I went:  "What the hell?! That's a horrible title!"  Then I heard it again and went:  "Aaaah.  Para Kang Baliw ."  and believed that it was what it was called. Just a few days ago,  urlLink Heidi  told me that it was actually  "Second Floor" . What do I care?  I read my boss' blog today and saw that he still addresses me by my handle. Funny. It took several months before he actually knew my name.   ** As there are too many thoughts inside my head, I will stop now. See you all tomorrow.

      I got home before 9pm for the first time weeks last night wanting to watch "Josie and the Pussycats" on Star World . I got home and began reading the paper to kill time before the movie started, when the I saw the ad for my Joshie's televised concert performance. One sentence came to mind:   Oh, my God!    How could I have completely forgotten about it?  But I really wanted to watch Rachel Leigh Cook flaunt her cat ears so I watched the movie on Star World and switched the channel to 23 as soon as it ended (I'm still singing  when you're happy and you know it... in my head as I write this). Good thing too, because as soon as I did Ethel began the text barrage on my Joshie. It went this way:   Ethel:   Nakaktunaw talga boses nya  Pai.   Me: I know.  Hindi na sha mukhang kawawa dito.  He looks so sexy here.  E:  I agree.  ** Joshie sings (swoon). And after some time Joshie introduces the musicians... **   Me:  The bald guy is cute. (noticing that he changed into a black sweater vest with a white shirt underneath) eeep!  Mukha shang  waiter.  E:  True. I liked the black shirt better.  Me:  I liked the burgundy/wine colored one. And for the record, I would not trade in his curls for the most gorgeous bald guy in the world.  ** Joshie sings again (I begin crying just aboout now) **   Me:  OMG, Eth! Don't tell me he already sang  To Where You Are ?!  E:  Yep.  Nung umpisa.   Me:  OMG, even  Alejate?!?!?!   E:  Yep. You didn't see it?  Me:  Nooooo! I was watching Josie and the Pussycats. Now I'm really gonna have to buy the CD/VCD package...  E:  Dang! I wanted to watch that too!  Me:  Don't worry, they'll be showing it again tomorrow at 1:30pm (notices a violin playing lady gryrating on a platform behind my Joshie)  WHO IS THAT  MALANDING BABAE?!?!?    E:  Oooh, white shirt again....  Me:  Lili Haydn  pala ha!?  Another person to add to my "to kill" list...  E:  Pai,  nakakatakot ka!  In fairness, she plays the violin well...  Me:   Oweno ngayon?!  Can she play the sax?!  ** For the record I can't play the sax either, but it just felt like it would be a good comeback. **   Andrea Corr begins singing with my Joshie...   E:   O, kaya mo yan?  Andrea Corr...  Me:   Yan?! E hindi naman maganda yung babaeng yan e. Magaling lang yung  make-up artist  nya .  E:  You saw her  na?   Me:  No. But someone I know interviewed her and I asked if all of the girls in the band were as pretty in person and he said: "Make-up is a wonderful thing". Tee-hee.  Joshie sings The Prayer with Angie Stone. Ethel notices the intro Joshie gave.   E:  A big...............HEART. hehehehe.....  Me:   Lintek! Kung yan lang pala ang hanap ng lalakeng yan, andito naman ako a! Pero,  in fairness,  magaling  si Ms. Stone.  E:  You've heard her other songs?  Me:  Yep. I have a friend who's a big fan.  E:   Makapag download  nga.   Me:  You do know that this convo is going to end up on my blog, don't you? BOTH OF THEM....  E:  Then it's a good thing I edited when I did.  Me:  hehehe. I would have censored it.  Then the concert ends....   E:   Tapos na?  Now I'm really gonna have to buy this package...  Me:  Yep. The concert's finished.   After some more texting....   E:  Ok, good night now. I'll see you online tomorrow.  Me:  Sure thing. I'm gonna enjoy my Joshie now....  E:  Say goodnight for me. Kiss him goodnight for me. ;)  Me:  Over  na yung  kiss,  wag na yun....   And then I get a text from Roxanne:   BFF:  OMG! I completely forgot about Joshie's concert!!!  And then of course we started all over again....   [ in my head ]  ...when you're happy and you know it, clap your hands...

        "I'm So Glad I'm Not You"   is one bloggers' title for his/her weblog. I couldn't have said it better myself. I didn't get to take down the URL before I stupidly entered mine, so I'll just chalk it up to the universe telling me things. Someone check if the moon is still orbiting the earth because I'm actually listening to the cosmos today - more often than not, I ask for a second transmission.  I woke up today reminded by something  Samantha  (of S&TC - one of the voices in my head) said in season 3:  "It's time to start drinking heavily" . A-MEN. Alcohol begets denial, I always say. Not my favorite defense mechanism, but it'll do in a pinch. Although it's much more fun to see your friends get wasted. The drunker the friend, the looser the lips. Hand me the camera...  In the spirit of bacchanalian delights, let's run down the list of hedonistic pleasures I've participated in the past few years. Nicotine: 4 years, then I quit cold turkey - not even tempted now. Alcohol: still do sometimes. I just don't like that my mouth tastes like a sewer afterwards. Weed: a looooong time ago. Screwed with my braincells so that ended as quickly as it began. I like my triple-digit, IQ, thank you very much.  ** Lucky Manzano doing MYX. Someone tell this  child  that commentators on TV are supposed to say words, not eat them. Enroll him in the Tina Monzon-Palma School of Elocution, please. If he flunks, just make him sit on a chair and make him look pretty. I have no patience with people who mispronounce their words. And I refuse to call him Luis. The name is too dignified. Lucky suits him just fine. **  I was supposed to put down something that has caused much discussion between a couple of friends and I (well, 3 friends actually - Tricia, RapRap and Phoebe. But if 2 friends is a "couple", what are 3 friends? A triple? English and/or Linguistics majors, help, please), I even had reference material! Something written by someone from La Salle a few years ago....but as my organizational skills have been suspiciously on hiatus for the past couple of weeks, I will leave that for some other time and just vent. A cleen spleen's the only way to go. It is, after all  semana santa , and confession is good for your soul - if you believe you have no soul (ahem, Tricia), your complexion then.  ** Which is the best Pinoy Rock-Rap Act (whatever, I wasn't paying attention) promo on MYX (I'm in the office, which explains all the shameless plugging). Then the rundown on all the nominees. Who are these guys? Oh I get it. They belong to the  "If You Can't Dazzle Them With Artistry, Drown Them With Noise"  School of Music (another quote from my Godess, Jessica Zafra). Whatever. Give me  Parokya Ni Edgar  over these guys anyday. At least they're fun - and they make fun of themselves. Plus, Buhawi likes Paula Cole's  Me . **  There's nothing much to do in the Metro come Maundy Thursday is there? Well, if you're in the mood for burning dinosaur by-products, you can always go cruising along the flyovers on EDSA. Speaking of cruising, you want to know what one of my biggest ambitions in life is? A convertible (preferably red) at 110, the entire length of San Juanico bridge, and Pearl Jam's  Evenflow  at top volume. woo-hoo!! I've heard that submarines pass in the body of water that the San Juanico spans....I do hope that when I finally get around to doing this, they pick up on my music. Lord knows those sailors could do with more varied forms of entertainment. ** I wonder what the inside of a submarine smells like when they're all nervous? **  It just occured to me that Jessica Zafra's old page (www.twisted.com.ph) is no more. Even Flip doesn't have it's own page. Furthermore, my squawkbox and the bubble thing on my page aren't working. Could it be because blogskins.com is moving? hmmmm........

      1.  What if you fell in love with someone who insisted that the two of you live happily ever after... on a houseboat?  Are you kidding? Have you seen where they anchor houseboats?  A floating slum  was how Robert Fulghum described it and I agree (sorry, Mr. Fulghum). No houseboats. Love me, love the ground.  2.  What if you could brew a potion to make anyone you want fall in love with you, but you would know it is a magical love and not true love?  Not worth it. And the Craft warns that you can NEVER draw other people into your magick.  3.  What if you could create the perfect man/woman for you to love?  Isn't that a bit Pygmalian? You fashion someone into what you think you love -  e , how can you tell when you've never been in love before? And what if the total opposite of what you believe comes along and you fall in love with him/her? And wouldn't doing the Pygmalion thing be a form of ... masturbation?  4.  What if your lover wanted to spend their entire life in a single town and never see the rest of the world?  Then I'd have to make sure I get to see the world before I settle down, won't I?  5.  What if you could look into the future and see the man/woman with whom you would one day fall in love and marry -- would you leap at the chance, or leave it to be a surprise adventure?   I'm tired of waiting. Gimme the future.  Pero ....what if it's someone I presently despise???? eeeeewwwwww..........  I took the photos down because my sister threatened murder.

      Plans for the summer:  1. Tagaytay 2. Batangas 3. Puerto Azul 4. Pansol (Guess what I'm rooting for? )  Told the boss about this before and he agreed. I don't know how agreebale he'll be after the holy week. Speaking of the holy week, I'm off  Maundy Thursday and Good Friday (whee!), then back again on Black Saturday - told my da about it and he didn't blow his top! I'm still amazed. I have an extremely nervous father.  Was supposed to go to Divisoria tomorrow but, due to Heidi's personal crisis, it's shelved. Friends over shopping any day.  Buti na lang , I need to save anyway.

      Hello, how has the summer been mistreating you? It's been very attentive to me. All my exposed bits are toasted this wierd shade of almond-y brown and I have the sinking feeling that its going to be worse. I have a new respect for rotisserie chicken - I now know what is is to be roasted on an open fire.  Yes, it's summer in the PI. Welcome to hell's foyer.   They say it's mind over matter, right?

      I should start a head-count as to how many people I've converted to blogging  I'm contagious. Stephen Speaks, Nickel Creek (Raprap turned me on to them and I played it non-stop here, so now the channel has the video. Tee-hee!), now blogging.  There's a career in this. I could potentially rule the world!!! (thunder! lightning!)  I just came from this braincell-killing meeting on taxes. Yes, ladies and gentlemen - and every gender in between - I am officially an adult. I have to, am obliged, gotta-do-it-because-if-I-don't-they-will-haul-my-ass-off-to-jail pay taxes. And I can't hide because I have a little laminated card that proves, without a doubt, that I am in the government's mainframe. I hate it. It means that if I commit a crime, I will be prosecuted with extreme prejudice. Of course I live in the PI so I don't know how harsh that'll be. Ok, I just have to add:  if they catch me .  I'm team leader which means I have to explain what we have to do. I understood nothing, which indicates the BIR will be cheated out of revenues this year.  Pau's back from Boracay. I wonder how lobster-y she is. And I just have to say that after last night's convo with Thorpe, I am much, much more enlightened about her persona. I like this girl - she doesn't give BS which is amazingly rare in anyone. My boss thinks she's cool as well.  [ in my head ]   [ in my ears ]  Creep  by STP  PS.

           Things that happened last night:   Watched  Sleeping Beauty  on the Disney Channel last night. Malificent made me shudder. If I were to be any Disney villain/ess, I'd want to be Malificent.  Ended up texting with Tricia until waaaay late. My right thumb is now my most used body part. Found out a lot about her and she about me. I think I'd better begin bribing her because she may just turn on me. But then again, I know stuff about her so I think we're calling it even for now.  You want to know what's worse than a hot night? A hot night with nothing good on  cable. sheesh. If you want to lose interest in television  - get cable. Even Animal Planet couldn't keep me occupied. Usually, when I turn on that channel, I stand in front of my TV and stare at hours upon hours of crocodiles, penguins and snakes - but for some reason, Dr. Brady Barr, Jeff Corwin and Steve Irwin were blah.  Oh, and I put on my ballet slippers for the first time in 12 years last night. Tried to do an arabesque. Failed. Fell on my face. ouch.  Finally beginning to think that I've learned HTML. But that could just be me. I'm very good at deluding myself.   Pau's in Boracay. What is it with people scuttling off to the beach at the merest hint of warm weather? ick. Shouldn't we all want to go to somewhere cooler? Like Australia? Or Switzerland? I don't like the beach - which comes at my detrement becuse I live in an archipelago. I think it comes from the fact that I can't swim.  And another thing, can't they put up an age limit on wannabe boybands? I saw this horrible video of the Robertson Brothers on MYX this morning....it was creepy. They looked like they were 30 and still had the boyband thing going on. Now, I would be the LAST person to dash the dreams of others, but please....if you're in your 30s and want to be in the music industry, do me a favor. DON'T GET TOGETHER WITH YOUR FRIENDS WHO ARE THE SAME AGE AS YOU AND FORM A BOYBAND. It smacks of pedophelia. And speaking of grown men shimmying - what's with The Wiggles? The guy with the sideburns is scary.   Summer beater tip of the day:  Shower with moisturizing shower gel so you won't have to put on (ick) lotion. Then dredge yourself liberally with J&J Lavander and Chamomile baby powder. Then spray yourself with JBC regular. aaaaahhhhhh.....

      It just came to my attention that more people read this blog that I had initially thought. hmmm...Is that a good thing? Does it justify a print run? Morever, do I care?   I was thinking about something I told Tricia last week. I'm not really comfortable about putting the entire issue here because it involves a group of people that certain individuals in my circle feel strongly about. And as members of my circle read this blog, I'd rather not cause friction as of yet.  Dadating din tayo jan.  But really, in retrospect, what they did was unnerving. And although I think nothing of it and it seriously doesn't affect how I feel about what they put out, it places huge doubts as to how sincere they really are. Something's rotten in the state of Denmark.....  Seriously thinking of quitting this job. I love it and it gives me wonderful perks, but to paraphrase someone - self-fulfillment crap aside, I need to earn a living.  I need to put this down before I forget again:    The greatest challenge of friendship, to me at least, has always been faith. Not faith in your friends - in which case is always a given; you always hold your friends in esteem - but rather faith in yourself.  You consider yourself capable of moving mountains for people you call friends.  I don't know if I've moved or nudged any mountains (or molehills) for my friends, but they've always pushed the greatest geological protrusions out of the way for me. To these women and to one very special man - people whom I am proud to call friends - my gratitude. To Roxy who is my rock - BFF...anything and everything for you.

       The universe hates me      Look at them. Gorgeous, aren't they? (I sound like Yoda)  Meet Reichen and Chip.

They're married. To each other.   While I am single, available, willing, employed AND heterosexual, I can't even get a guy.  The universe is conspiring against me.  [ in my head ] wahwahwah....

      I love Roxy because:   * I was the first one she called after she found out she got that jaw-dropping NMAT score. * she calls Jork just to tell me he sounds like Chewbacca first thing in the morning. * she has never told me that my ideas were stupid and worthless, even when I know that they are. * she's always on my side. * she makes her brother play  You're Still You  on the piano and calls me up to make me listen to him play it, because she knows I love the song. * when she was studying for the NMAT, she didn't mind that I'd call her in the middle of the night to talk about nothing.  Everyone should have a best friend like her - one who won't mind that your stupid ideas are likely murderous, and who'll put down reviewers for biochemistry because you're on the phone and want to talk about nothing.  And I love my brother because he tried to fix the straps of my flipflops when they broke in the supermarket yesterday. And when they saw that they were beyond mending, he took off his sneakers for me to wear and went off IN HIS SOCKS to get me a new pair of flipflops so I wouldn't look funny.

      Excuse me. I need to get this out of my system.

Well me and B we hate supermodels, It's not that we know anyone personally,   It's just that I'm tired of being compared.    The boys they come here, With expectations for the summer, And I refuse to take any part of this barbaric ritual, 'cause God has given me a mind, That I will use from time to time, And I got more on my head, Than what's made by Paul Mitchell.  Was it worth the tears you cried... to fit the size?    Think it over once or twice, What lasts the longest in this life, Character, or rock hard thighs? And in the end do you believe, That beauty lies in what you see? 'cause if you do, then baby Youve been deceived.     Supermodels  Kendall Payne

      I finally bought something off an auction site. A couple of weeks ago, I had posted something about wanting a copy of  urlLink Revenge of the Baby Sat .  urlLink Cha  posted and suggested that I try  urlLink Avalon  to look for a marked down copy. I went and found that the book had already been bought, but saw that someone was selling a copy of a book I have had trouble finding forever: The God of Small Things by Arundhati Roy. I knew that a new copy is going for around P400, so finding a copy in "very good condition" for P150 was a deal.  Anyway, I got my book today and I am sooo happy. It's in excellent condition and Jasper (the guy who sold me the book) was an extremely nice guy.

      I've received e-mails from non-Pinoy folk who read my blog and ask who Jessica Zafra is. I told them that she's a Filipino writer. And they ask for where they can find her work. I tell them to go to  urlLink google  and ask, because google knows everything. They're  tamad , so for their benefit and for my sanity, may I redirect you to  urlLink here . It's not the official site, I think that was taken down already. But there are samples of her work there. I especially like  urlLink The Daze of Whine and Neuroses .  Oh and I came across  urlLink Jay's  blog quite by accident. His blog is called "kwentong tambay" and as soon as I can find my brain, I'm going to translate that into english. It's fun; he's a good writer and his entires make me want to write entries only in tagalog.  Pero nakakatakot ako magsulat sa tagalog e. Baka ikahiya pa ako ng tatay ko.  Jay's a Filipino living in Singapore and  can relate to most of what he says. Especially the stories about the train experices in the morning and the missing "R". Does this mean I want to go back and live in Singapore? Hell no.

      I had a three-hour lunch with tita Cecile and Monique yesterday at Cravings in Katipunan and felt very continental. I always thought that extremely long lunches were only for the French and Spanish - and then I had one yesterday and just felt glorious. The food was excellent (Cravings had a sun dried tomato-basil-onion-garlic-olive oil spread that was just heavenly), the company was perfect, the conversation was heavenly and the air-conditioning was bliss. I've heard people say that the ultimate perfect experience was a day of pampering at the spa, but I beg to differ. Spend a loooong lunch with 2 people who just float your boat and feel all the tension and worries melt away.   After that lunch, it was off to the mall because my tita had errands to run. I ended up at the "unmentionables" section of SM and picked out a load of new knickers. I told  urlLink Tricia  how many pairs I bought and she couldn't believe it. Neither can I actually, but ladies, agree with me when I say that part of the fun of being female is that our undergarments are much, MUCH more interesting than those of the male species.  The day was topped off perfectly by the moon last night. Did anyone notice it? The moon was unusually bright last night. Midnight looked like it was nearer to daybreak. I had an espcially good view, because at this time of the year, the moon drapes herself directly over my bedroom window. If I were still practicing, I would say that last night would have been the perfect night to cast a love spell.   Then today I saw photos of crush-boy on his website. I'm not telling who he is or what the url is. I'm keeping him secret for now. Tad say's he's funny. Yes he is. He's funny and smart and has beautiful hands. To paraphrase Bridget Jones,  "...He's perfect" . I am blissful, can you tell? Although Tad did mention that he wasn't gorgeous - actually, what Tad really said was,  "You're not into pretty-boys, are you?"  No I'm not, but crush-boy is more than just being pretty. He's absolutely IDEAL.  I am so, SO happy. Tonight I could crash and burn, but I don't care right now. I wish all of you have a day like this.

      Hooray for my  urlLink boss  because he posted this:   I hate that Dove commercial on TV. It's the one with the fat girl. I'm not exactly sure what she said exactly so please do correct me, but I think it's something like "ang taba-taba ko nga, ang pangit ko pa." What vales are they teaching our society - that fat women virtually have zero chances of landing on a guy if they're ugly, too? What a bunch of crap!   It's such a nice-guy thing to say.

      This  urlLink story  made my skin crawl when I first read it. Because it was caused by sheer  kayabangan  and another reason is because my sister could have easily been in that accident.  A few days (or maybe weeks) after the incident,  urlLink this  was posted on the  urlLink UP Diliman  website.  What appalls me is the las paragraph:   Richard Ong's parents want to correct the rumors that they are an affluent family; that they have relatives in the police or military and that they intend to send their son abroad to escape responsibility. Both parents work in middle management of two local banks. The BMW is registered in the name of Atty. Ma. Leichelle Bonifacio, a cousin of Richard Ong. According to the mother, at the time of the incident the brother of the registered owner, Dick Kenneth Soriano, only let Richard Ong at the wheel. None of their children has their own cars. The cars driven by the parents are registered in the name of the banks under a car plan scheme. The mother had to raise money from relatives and buy off her car from the bank in order to sell it a day before Gwen Puyat and Meryl Antonio were discharged from St. Luke's so she could pay the 50% cash required by the hospital. The hospital refused to give them a discount for the little less than P800,000.00-bill because of the rumor that "General ang ama ng nakabanga."   Am I supposed to be comforted by those facts? That they weren't given a discount? That they had to sell their cars? That Richard Ong's family wasn't wealthy and was only from a middle-class family?  Bullshit.  Your son is a murderer.  And what I find really disgusting is the fact that Mr. Ong's family will be able to bounce back from this, primarily because they have the means to. Resources will be available to them, and even if he serves the maximum jail time, he will be out in  just six years .  Precious' family will have to live not only without her presence, but also without the hope her UP education would have afforded for them.  Tell me,  dapat ba akong maawa?

      Excuse me, I don't feel very chipper today. I haven't felt chipper for a few days now. What I would really love to happen right now is to be given a one way ticket to Ireland so I can dangle my feet off the nearest foggy cliff. I'm not sure how safe that is, but I really don't care.

      And the moral of the story is: Leave home without them. And take your baby niece with you.  My grandmother and my favorite aunt are in town for a few weeks. They came regardless of SARS and scorching heat to see Dominique (the niece). I know I should be all out  "aaaaaawwwww"  on this because it should be endearing to see four generations of my family's women coming together, but, NO. I will not go awwwww. What I will say is:  "Shut up!!! Ang ingay nyo!!!!"  They are so loud you would think that they were fire engines responding to a third alarm. It doesn't help any that my niece stays awake forever as long as there are voices and/or sounds around her - I'm blaming her dad, because he spoke to her all the time while she was in the womb. The kid is getting eyebags and I am becoming very, VERY irritable. Exacerbated by the incredible heat that is summer 2003. I draw on my right to move to Antarctica and become an ice cube.  Emer and I have been in the office since 9am. The inhabitants of the ninth floor up until a few minutes ago were Emer, the lobby guard (dog) Shally, 3 custodians (that I know of), and myself.  Buti na lang hindi mashadong maginaw ngayon, kung hindi, frozen delight na naman ako.   Things to do next week: * go summer-bag shopping (BAG. Singular. Just one.

Chai * get another copy of the Godess'  Twisted 3  because Jhie lost my copy * extort money from my cousin because he owes me  I'm bored and resolved NOT to watch X2.

      There's a new  urlLink popularity contest  on the web. It tells you just how many people love your blog by linking you. I'm pretty OK...This blog is linked by 12 Inbound Blogs, 13 Inbound Links (dunno what that means). The clincher is that they're all people I know or by people whose blogs I read. How cool would it be if I were linked by some unknown individual just because?   Go check it out, you just may find the blog of that creepy guy (or girl, for the sake of being PC) who keeps on giving you the-not-good-kind of goosebumps whenever you see him in the hall. Posthaste!  Another discovery today: did you know that there's actually a website that honors Filipino bloggers? Check out the  urlLink website .

      While I usually go on and on about the fact that I now work evenings and how that screws up my body clock because I now keep time like a vampire, I love being in the office at night because of the following reasons:  * there are usually less than 10 people in an office that can hold 150 people easy. * you can play songs with the volume turned way up and no one will complain. * let's face it, the good shows are on in the evening.  and most of all, at 2 in the morning the chat lounge feels like a party.

      Further proof that the universe is conspiring against me.  I never dream about the people I'm crushing on.    Exhibit A  My dream about  urlLink PatSu's  Hunny went like this:   I entered a crowded room and the only chair was the one next to him. I sit next to him and we proceed with the usual banter. I talk to him in Taglish and he seems to understand me (all of this makes sense in my dream). We get so chummy that at one point I ask if I could look through his wallet. He says yes and proceed to take his billfold out.  I look inside and see that there are literally hundreds of photos given to him by fans. HUNDREDS. I recognize some of the people in the photos because they were my classmates in high school. But that wasn't the weird bit. Even in my dream I found it kind of freaky that his wallet was.... urlLink Little Twin Stars .  I woke up and shouted   GET HIM OUT OF MY SUBCONSCIOUS!!!!     Exhibit B  My dream about  urlLink Pauline's  Baby was really boggling:  I was finishing a paper/report but realized that my PC/printer was dead. I went to visit my friend in this really cool blue and silver and gray office and saw that he was there, too. When my friend and I were talking, he came up and said hello and asked what I was doing there. I said I needed to print my paper/report blahblahblah. He said he wished he could help but his PC/printer was being insane also, but said that he had one at his house and that we could go there and he'd finish my paper for me. I said yes (I think my friend kind of faded into the background, but I was confident that it was ok) and off we went to go to his place.  Along the way, I realized that I was pregnant (  !  ), and the shock of this makes me stop in my tracks in the middle of where we were supposed to wait for public transportation. He saves me from the traffic. Here's the creepy part. For some reason or another, in real-life, Pauline's baby rubs me the wrong way (get your mind out of the gutter!).

      Stupid thought that has been in my head since  urlLink the movie  came out.  Is Sebastian a crab or a lobster?  And why is he red?  Isn't red a bad color for crustaceans because that would mean he's cooked?  If he's cooked, it means he's dead, right?

          Duncan Sheik is coming over in a month. It going to be a good show, I think. This guy is pretty cool. I have yet to hear a bad song done by him. The fact that he's eye candy has nothing to do with that pronouncement, I swear.  I will resist going to this show with every fiber of my being, I swear to God  If my  urlLink boss  gets to read this....can I go to the presscon again?   * * * * * * * * *   My best friend, Roxy, and I share  urlLink a blog . You're welcome to read it if you want. I just won't be adding a permanent link to it here, because I'm not sure she wants me to do that. She's a better writer than I can ever hope to be. Plus she's brainy and funny and ecstatic over the fact that she gained weight which made her suddenly babe-like.  Anyway, we're both obsessed with  urlLink Survivor 3  - well, actually I'm drooling over  urlLink Ethan , and I suspect that she seriously wants to be friends with  urlLink Brandon  (The African Queen) - that we kind of keep up with what they've done afterwards. Ethan joined  urlLink Eco-Challenge Fiji  and Brandon dropped off the edge of the earth (or moved to Castro, whichever). She (Roxanna Banana) then pointed me towards Eco-Challenge because she knew I liked Ethan while she did the dance of joy over the fact that Hayden Chirstensen had a team that was competing as well.    (l-r) Hejsa Christensen, Hayden Christensen, Tove Christensen, Bill Trayling.  Roxy's right, Tove looks like Michael Vartan. The family's a big bunch of sports nuts, but get this - Hesja pulled them out for some reason. But hey, competing in Eco-challenge prepared him for this side of the world and we're convinces that nothing can faze them anymore. Watch out, PI, Roxy's plotting something big.

      I had posted someting written by Nels Schifano a couple of blogs back. Point your cursors  urlLink here  and read where it was taken from.    * * * *    Random college memory. When I was a junior in dear old  urlLink UP  working for my BA in  urlLink Behavioral Studies , I took a course in linguistics. I remember my professor stressing that we should never try to do the "M" sound while inhaling.  "That will kill you" , she said. We didn't believe her. I'm still going "mmmmmm" while exhaling. But it does get me to thinking, "What if I expire while doing this? Wonder what they're going to put in the obituary?  ....she passed away due to extreme curiosity. " Which would be better than death by stupidity, I guess.  Oh, and check out my friend Jhie's baby girl,  urlLink Jhielian Robyn .   Everyone around me is either getting pregnant and giving birth. My sister's friend is six years younger than I am and already she has a baby daughter. I don't know whether to express mild shock or to hurl myself off the nearest rooftop.

"This must be something of a surprise. If, that is, this letter gets to you. I remembered your address, of course, but then it suddenly struck me that maybe you had moved and I didn't know and anyway the post round here isn't exactly reliable. So perhaps I am only writing a letter to myself.     Really now that I've started I can't think what it was I wanted to say. I think it was just the act of writing that was important, just to feel as if I was still in contact with things, although I guess a blank piece of paper in an envelope would have seemed a little strange.     I've really no need to ask how things are with you. It all seems to have worked out pretty much as you planned. But still I hope you are both healthy and happy."

        Episodes of Pure Torture   pala ha! If you're a rabid SS fan, don't read  urlLink Mon Castro's review of the Duncan Sheik concert .  The godess once said that the beauty of democracy is that  "everyone is entitled to his own opinion. No matter how moronic."  True. And that the only way we would know if democracy actually works is if someone whose opinions are totally different from yours, is allowed to express them without fear of retribution. This is the PI, we have democracy coming out of our ears. We threw out 2 presidents we didn't like because of democracy. It really wouldn't be too much of a stretch to claim that we are the most democratic country in the cosmos.  I digress, back to my regularly scheduled spleen cleaning.  But see, to put down other people; to tell them that they are inferior because of how they  dress , or because they enjoy mainstream, bubblegum-my, mushy, and evidently, not-your-type music is just sad. Making it sound like it's wrong to flow with the middle while revelling (?) in your freakishness is not very democratic - it's bigotry. Starting something with a disclaimer ( "I'm not putting you down, ha? But...." ) does nothing for people's egos. It's fecking shallow. I reserve my choicest invectives for you...  I'm not criticizing you, ha? That's just my opinion.  Sarcasm is embedded in my DNA.  [ in my ears ] Stacy Orrico on MTV

      One of my favorite hobbies is watching old movies and checking out the bit players then seeing if some of them made something out of their careers. Last night's old movie was  To Wong Foo, Thanks For Everything, Julie Newmar . No matter how many times I watch it, I still get a kick out of seeing Blade (aka Wesley Snipes) in drag.   So anyway, in that movie I saw the  gwapo -licious Michael Vartan (staright-to-video Vartan, he calls himself - don't you just love a guy who has a sense of humor??), playing a redneck named Tommy. He was the one who was (wo)manhandled by Noxema Jackson (aka Jesse's daughter, aka Blade, aka Wesley Snipes). You should go see it. Watch out for him at the end during the Strawberry Social - he's wearing a red brocade jacket and his hair is all slicked back. I also saw Blythe Danner (Gwynnie's mommy). But does she count? Methinks not.  But the highlight of that movie is still Miss ChiChi Rodriguez (?), played wonderfully by John Leguizamo. Especially the part when one of the London twins (I can't tell them apart, can you?) begins courting. Hys-te-ri-cal, I tell you.   [ in my head ] i still have a job!!!!

      I tripped 8 times in the span of 60 minutes on my way to the office. At one of those times, I think I may have actually looked like I was trying out for the Icecapades. I did a sort of triple lutz, then an awkward arabesque and finished it off with a modified split. And I tripped over my own feet twice when I was already inside ELJ (the building where I work): once going inside the elevators, another while sliding my butt into my seat. That has got to be a record; I'm not usually so ungainly. I actually have perfect coordination and hardly ever bump into things that are clearly in my way. I wonder what is it with today that I'm so klutzy.  Lutz na may "K" = Klutz. Klutz = me.  Oh and may I add that a classy education does not produce an equivalently classy individual. Also, that being an  artist  (quote, unqoute)  does not give *you* the license to act like an asshole. *You* do that perfectly well on *your* own.

      A bit lethargic tonight. I think I used up all my party cells. How are you? How's your tuesday shaping up?  I got my first taste of how it is to upload the files to the website. Not that hard; easier than I expected. I took notes, but I don't know how useful they're going to be when  urlLink the ojt killer  is peeking over my shoulder wondering if I'm doing it right.  All I can say about that experience is:   Hallelujiah Blogger  ! Praise you!  You know that Europe vs. Asia pool tourney ( urlLink Soulmate ,  tornament ) being shown on television? I want passes to that. But the seats are limited (300 in total) and it's first come first serve. I asked an officemate if he would be so kind as to go to the 10th floor tomorrow and ask if there are still passes available. I'm not holding my breath, though. Besides, TV will provide better angles. I think this kind of coping mechanism is called  rationalization . Roxy? Tama ba?  Bought a new writing implement. It's pretty. Pink.

      Tip for everyone who hope to make it big in showbiz (or, as my sister says it:  shiyowbeeeez ) someday: never antagonize the people you go to school with. Especially if you go to a private, catholic girls' school. Because after you're in and they name you after a fruit, and your attitude changes to that of a spitting cobra with PMS, when you die people's reactions to your death will range from:  "She was not a nice person" , to:  "She was an evil bitch. She deserved to die."  And all your mother's public pronouncements that you were a sweet, gentle, affectionate person will have people wanting to tar and feather her.  This is Pia Garcia.

       Saddest Poem  by Pablo Neruda  I can write the saddest poem of all tonight.   Write, for instance: "The night is full of stars, and the stars, blue, shiver in the distance."   The night wind whirls in the sky and sings.   I can write the saddest poem of all tonight. I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.   On nights like this, I held her in my arms. I kissed her so many times under the infinite sky.   She loved me, sometimes I loved her. How could I not have loved her large, still eyes?   I can write the saddest poem of all tonight. To think I don't have her. To feel that I've lost her.   To hear the immense night, more immense without her. And the poem falls to the soul as dew to grass.   What does it matter that my love couldn't keep her. The night is full of stars and she is not with me.   That's all. Far away, someone sings. Far away. My soul is lost without her.   As if to bring her near, my eyes search for her. My heart searches for her and she is not with me.   The same night that whitens the same trees. We, we who were, we are the same no longer.   I no longer love her, true, but how much I loved her. My voice searched the wind to touch her ear.   Someone else's. She will be someone else's. As she once belonged to my kisses. Her voice, her light body. Her infinite eyes.   I no longer love her, true, but perhaps I love her. Love is so short and oblivion so long.   Because on nights like this I held her in my arms, my soul is lost without her.   Although this may be the last pain she causes me, and this may be the last poem I write for her.

      It's  urlLink a holiday  in fair  urlLink QC  today. Which means a holiday for the working folk - all but US that us. I don't mind, I need to get a head start on some things anyway. *shrugs*   urlLink Michael Buble  (accent on the "e", please) is coming town and the ticket prices made my jaw drop.  $95!!!!!  For that kind of money he'd better be singing to ME alone. Considering the fact that he isn't really that popular here, I shudder to think about how much tickets to my Josh Groban's concert will cost. Oh well, I'll be sure to go to the press conference anyway, so I guess I'll have him sign my CD there.  I am making a conscious effort to be a fan of someone. I want to be a big fan of someone so I won't be so dismissive of others. The last time was when I was 13 and the OoD was NKOTB - and we all know what happened to  them , don't we?

      When I was younger, the only thing I wanted more than food and air was (were?) books. I remember my mom once asked me what I wanted when I turned eighteen and I looked up at her and answered: "a library." She smiled at me and from that day on, I got 3 new books every week.  I also got a huge box of books from my grandfather right before he died. I didn't know much about my mom's dad, because he and my grandmother separated even before my mom met sperm donor. I don't recall ever really talking to him or receiving gifts or letters either, but I figured that he must be a good sort to send me books.  One of the books included in the package was a paperback called "Hey, Didi Darling", it was written by S.A. Kennedy and was published around 1984. I loved that book to death. Even after  The Uses of Enchantment ,  Color is the Suffering of Light  and  She's Come Undone , I go back to that book and realize that it still speaks to me as clearly now as it did all those years ago.

      It's been a pretty tense few days for me here at work. Nobody's breathing down my neck or anything like that, it's because I'm included in the team that produces a live cable talk show about the  urlLink UAAP . It's a group effort and the people I'm with are very capable and very knowledgable about how to put together these kinds of shows. But see, I know nothing about it. Nada. Nothing. Zero. Zilch. Wala. There was a meeting at the beginning of this week, and I basically sat there with big eyes and a slack jaw. I took notes, but at that time, nothing was sinking in. Everyone was calm, and confident. I needed to jumpstart my brain after a few minutes. Also, since  urlLink Jovan  is on leave (wish him well, guys. He deserves it), he also put me in charge of a few things which I never thought I would be doing. Again, nothing heavy, but enough to put an inexperienced doof like me through loops trying to get everything in order. He's been extremely supportive and kept telling me to "be calm. Don't be tense. Enjoy the entire experience." I don't know about you, but I get uneasy when someone tells me things like that.   But then, I got an IM from  urlLink Anna (",)  a few minutes ago and she asked how many hours I spend in the office. I told her that I worked around 10 hours a day, more or less. She said that it was a pretty fair time, but then told me that I should be careful as "work is addictive around these parts". I had to smile at the last bit, because I knew what she meant.  She also sent me an e-mail about trying to establish a healthy balance between work and your life:   ... encourage people to put some balance in their lives. For instance, here is a guideline I find helpful: 1) Wake up, eat a good breakfast, and go to work. 2) Work hard and smart for eight or nine hours. 3) Go home. 4) Read the books/comics, watch a funny movie, dig in the dirt, play with your kids, etc. 5) Eat well and sleep well.  ...Love your job, but don't fall in love with the company.   I feel much better now.  [ in my ears ]  Full of Grace  - Sarah McLachlan

      For  urlLink BatJay , May it bring back all those wonderful memories  Galileo's head was on the block,  the crime was looking up the truth. And as the bombshells of my daily fears explode I try to trace them to my youth.  And then you had to bring up reincarnation  over a couple of beers the other night. And now I'm serving time for mistakes made by another in a another lifetime.  How long till my soul gets it right? Can any human being ever reach that kind of light? I call on the resting soul of Galileo King of night vision, king of insight.  And then I think about my fear of motion, which I never could explain. Some other fool across the ocean years ago must have crashed his little airplane.  How long till my soul gets it right? Could any human being ever reach that kind of light? I call on the resting soul of Galileo King of night vision, king of insight.  I'm not making a joke, you know me; I take everything so seriously. If you wait till the time till all souls get it right then at least I know they'll be no nuclear annihilation in my life time.  Im still not right.  "I offer thanks to those before me," that's all Ive got to say. Cuz maybe you squandered big bucks in your lifetime Now I have to pay.  But then again it feels like some sort of inspiration To let the next life off the hook. But she'll say, "Look what I had to overcome from my last life, I think I'll write a book."  How long till my soul gets it right? Can any human being ever reach the highest light? Except for Galileo, God rest his soul King of night vision, king of insight.

Because my mom walked out of  Dekada '70 , saying that what was on the screen reflected the images she carries in her head about friends who were never seen again. Because my dad was rounded up one night and didn't go home for days because he missed curfew. Because my grandmother nearly lost both daughters in one night.  * urlLink BatJay , may kopya ka na ba ng  Bakit Baligtad Magbasa ang Pinoy?  Sabihin mo lang at padadalhan kita.

      This was in FLIP a few months ago.  And you wonder why she's my goddess.  >  Copy This  by Jessica Zafra    Does anyone else find it funny that people who make much more money than we do are appealing to us not to deprive them of their income? You have the nerve to charge me P450 for a CD that is being sold on the street for P60 and you expect my sympathy?   The campaign against pirated software, CD's, VCD's, audio and cassettes, would have us believe that piracy is our problem. Really? How is shelling out P100 for a disc that contains P50,000 worth of software a problem for me? It would seem that the pirates are doing me, and my shrinking wallet a big favor. Why should it bother me that a movie which has not yet opened in Metro Manila theatres is being peddled on VCD on Ayala Avenue for P90? I have no fights with the pirates. They are selling me information I might otherwise not have access to because of prohibitive costs. Yes they are thieves and thieves should be punished, but they are not stealing from me.  Oh sure, you can lecture me about in the long run I will pay for buying bootleg but by then I will have used the information for my benefit .  So let me make a correction. Piracy is the problem of the manufacturers, the software houses, record companies, and motion picture companies, whom I shall refer to from hereon as the corporations. By telling us not to buy pirated materials "for the good of everyone", corporations make it appear that corporate interests and the public interest are the same thing. This is unlaughably untrue. Corporations makes noise about working in the public interest but these noises are called public relations, PR. But their duty is to their owners. The anti-piracy ads, which appeals to my virtue, pass the responsibility of combating piracy to me. HELLO. They invoke the law and call on my conscience to protect their profit margin, but when I shell out P450 for a CD that turns out to be crap, I can't invoke the law, and corporations have no conscience. We may all be equal under the law, but they have the best lawyers. I guess their complaints are valid because they stand to lose more money, while I'm just a sucker who bought the promotional hype.   The anti-piracy campaign says that when we buy unauthorized copies a.k.a. bootleg we are stealing from the creators of the music, movies or computer programs. This would be the case if the proceeds of the sales went to artist themselves. We know that the artists get a small royalty; most of the money goes to the corporations. They profit from the work of the artists dry. Their excuses is for a small royalty, they can suck the artists dry. Their excuse is that they spent vast sums of money on the marketing of the artists' work.    In short, the season "originals" cost so much is because the huge marketing expenses are passed on to us.  Why should we finance the ridiculous costs of hype?  When you buy bootleg, you deny the artist a couple of bucks but you stick it to the corporation, which is so rich it won't even say ouch. I find it hard to summon up any sympathy for a multi-million dollar entity that does business in 100 countries. Awww, the poor corporations, their executives won't be buying personal Lear jets this quarter. Buying bootleg has a Robin Hood appeal; Rob the rich to give the poor, meaning you. It's the opposite of jueteng, in which robs the poor in order to give to the rich.   The corporations are laying a massive guilt trip on consumers when they should be working to make their products less easy to steal. With the technology we have, it is extremely to make high-quality copies of anything. In the past we worried that the bootleg goods could damage our electronic equipment; today's fake CD's are almost exactly like the originals. While the corporations are piracy-proofing their wares, maybe they should cut us a break and drop their prices. The pirates have shown that it is possible to make CD's cheaper. Take the hint, and spare us the sob stories about high marketing costs and your dwindling profits.   I don't buy pirated software not just because pirates don't usually do Mac programs but because I love my Mac. But I cannot tell PC users not to buy bootleg software when it costs one-fiftieth the price of the original. Caveat emptor, naturally, and the fake software may cause their PCs to crash but PCs do that anyway. Hey doesn't the idea of killing Bill Gates of .0000000000000000(add more zeroes)1 of his income appeal to you? Look at him, the guy's rolling in money, but he won't spend for a proper haircut. Besides, If you really want to quibble over it, didn't Bill Gates and Steve Jobs borrow information from the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center?  Cut the crap, and stop appealing in my good nature.  It is not my job to protect your interests.  The pirates are sleazy, but they have inadvertently raised the possibility of a future in which the artists reaches her audience directly, without a corporate middleman. Think of a future in which you profit from your ideas. Not bloody likely right but it's a good thought.  ---------------------  Tanginaaaaaaa.  May babaeng talipandas na nilalandi ang CB ko.

      It's a sad, tragic thing, denying your nature. *nods* It really is.  When I was doing my undergraduate thesis (The Matching Process in the Local Adoption Program of the Department of Social Welfare and Development -  gulat kayo ano? ), I realized that I wasn't a technical writer. A realization that never really bothered me before because I never thought I would need technical writing/editing skills; I wasn't sure that it was legal (read:ethical) to hire someone who was, so I made my best friend read through every revision my thesis mentor asked me to make (and there were a lot, but I got rid of that headache by changing mentors *hee*). Being undeniably fair, she made me read through hers too (Alternative Practices in Modern Medicine). Her first revision made the cut. I think my first revision made my initial mentor (Prof. Argonza), want to go to another continent far, far away from me.  I rambled again. Back to my (non-existent) technical writing skills.  I belong to the "From the Gut School of Writing." Put down what you feel; what you think NOW before it escapes you again thus preventing countless nights of you smacking yourself on the forehead while calling yourself stupid. And it seems that I am the only remaining old-timer on campus. Everyone is matriculating somewhere else. *sigh*  Do be patient with what you read here, ok? I am trying.

      I may be getting ahead of myself but...everyone who doesn't have SkyCable will be hitting themselves over the head this Thursday.  Look around. See anything different?  I wanted to change my template forever, and now I finally did.  I still need some help setting up my tag-board, so we'll have to use the shout-out thing at the bottom for the time being. It'll be up soon  :)  ------ From  urlLink Jonathan Canier's Zodiac Forecasts :  Patricia Garcia doesn't know the meaning of the word 'enough.' It's not that Patricia is greedy or that she lacks self-discipline - far from it. Patricia goes out of her way to share, care and be fair. That's why she never quite knows when to stop. To draw the line you have to be a little insensitive. How, precisely, should it be measured? With a magnifying glass? Or with a microscope? Patricia Garcia is extremely sensitive and keenly perceptive. She is a Libran, born under the sign of the scale. Patricia knows in her heart that no matter how meticulously you ever weigh anything in this world you can always reach a different conclusion if you apply a more refined set of measurements. Patricia knows that those refinements are infinite. Hours have minutes, minutes have seconds. Seconds have nanoseconds. No wonder Patricia Garcia is never sure what time it is!   Some people are prone to assume that Patricia has her head in the clouds. They think that she lives in a world of her own full of lofty ideas and complex theories. Other people have the temerity to watch Patricia at work in this way and to suppose that Patricia is indecisive! Where on earth do they get that idea from? Actually Patricia is one of the most decisive people on the face of the planet. she absolutely, definitely knows what she wants but she only knows it from one second to the next. To the untrained eye this appears to be an inconsistency. What they fail to see are the countless nanoseconds during which Patricia's sense of purpose is solid as a rock. Patricia, though, knows what people are thinking and so, to keep them on their toes she makes a point of declaring her intentions loudly and clearly. she makes quite sure that these brave statements never differ from day to day.

Speaking of passion:    urlLink Matthew  : Without you, I'm as lonely as an abandoned dog on the side of a highway. I have gift anxiety, even though I don't know when your birthday is. We can spend perfect days shopping and cleaning together. I swear, I'll never make wisecracks when you scrape your tires against the curb while parallel parking. If you consent to live with me, I'll clean the toilet every week. I'll do it with my tongue if you ask. I will strike the words "hooters" and "love rockets" from my vocabulary. I'll love you. Even if your name is Mimi and you want me to pronounce it "May May". I will only pass gas underneath the covers and under the direst of circumstances. Hell, I'll go on a low cholesterol diet. And I won't buy one of those red sports cars when I hit my mid-life crisis. Your parents can come visit us every week, even if your mom is a witch with a capital B. And your folks don't have to go to a retirement home because they can come live with us. I declare, I'll separate the whites from the colors and learn the mysteries of hot and cold water washes. I'll never huff and puff while waiting for you to put on my makeup. If you're a cat person, I'll never point out the fact that a dog can save your life from drowning, but a cat can't. I will happily go see chick flicks with you, like "Pride and Prejudice". I'll make a point to trying new food like okra gumbo. I won't curl my nose at vegetables whose awful taste is disguised by having cheese on it. I pledge to always say "yes" when you ask, "Is my hair looking okay tonight?" I'm gonna bring a whole new meaning to the word "cuddle". I'll be thoughtful enough to read your horoscope every day. I'm gonna save every birthday card you send me! And I'll actually write you real letters when we're apart. I'm never gonna expect you to know where I left my car keys, and I'll never leave my socks on the floor. With me, you'll find the cap is always on the toothpaste. I'll start wearing those bikini style underwear if you like. My belly button will always be lint free. I want to full-on kiss your clitoris. It will be the most passionate, intimate experience you've ever had. I declare now, I will give my life for you. And if you fail to come to me, I know some part of me will surely die.  Top that.   I dare you.  [ in my ears ]   'Til I Hear It From You  - Gin Blossoms

      ...It hurts to feel inadequate and unworthy of someone with all the right qualities, and I don't pretend not to cry at nights knowing that the permanence of loneliness in my life is a big possibility. But the philosophy that has kept my sanity in check is that there is no point in being miserable about something that is not tangible in my life just yet...I see nothing much that can be done when you don't even see what you want. If there's another thing I've learned, it's never to settle for anything less than what I need. The sad thing about life is that dreams are usually so cookie-cutter perfect, that people just settle for the closest things to them. They don't believe in the existence and sheer possibilities of their own desires. Like me, they're probably afraid to...But what does prepare a person for love and desire, pain and loss? Each of un runs from even the things we want, primarily because we are afraid to claim them as ours, of consequently being incapable of keeping them, and of realizing that we are inadequate for their needs and wants.

      Dear people I miss more than Strawberry shake,  I want to see you all next weekend. Saturday is a good thing, because I work on Sunday evening (I'll explain later) and because Lorrie has training on Sunday. Don't tell me you can't come because I know for a fact hell week is over (or nearly over).  Don't. Give. Me.  THAT . Look. PatSu.  Kim? Will you be there? Agnes? Beauty parlor visit before lamyerda? Yam? I'm going to be asking my boss about your request.  Love, Pia  P.S.  urlLink Elliot  just broke his femur. Go congratulate him.  [ in my ears ]  You Raise Me Up  - Josh Groban

      Text from Yam this morning.   Yam : ok, how do you really pronounce "reqiuem"?  Me : accdg to  urlLink dictionary.com , it's "re-ki-yem".   Yam : Thanks! :)  Me :you're welcome :) what do you need it for ba? g'morning yam!  Yam : MORNING! a friend and i saw a poster advertising it, and we began arguing about how it's pronounced.

See, Ateneo wins ONLY when they wear their white jerseys. When they wear the blue one, they lose. So.   Today is Game 2 and they're wearing the white jersey. So....this game is pretty much theirs.

Melanie:  "That's why I'm a success, it's because I do not MIDDLE in other people's lives." (may katwiran. hindi nga naman siya nanggigitna!)   Melanie:  "Do not judge my brother, he is not a book!"  (and he is. . . . . ??)   Melanie:  (in an angry and self-righteous tone) "i won't stoop down to my level!"  (dapat lang 'day! sa tangkad mong 'yan, bali ang likod mo!)   Melanie:  (as angry as hell) "hello? bulag ka ba? bingi ka ba? (points to ear) are you DEP????"  (Hindi ah. . . shinampoo ko lang 'yan. . . )   Melanie:  "yung std... baka sa maruming toilet lang nya nakuha yan."  (hmmm....may punto ..... kung autistic ka!!)  Melanie: (one of her best points yet) "eh ikaw ba naman durugin ang ari mo? pag di ba naman manutok ka ng baril?"  (this is a very popular observation of renowned psychologists. it's called the "mash the crotch, cock a gun" phenomenon)  naalala ko tuloy yung isa pa nyang comment noon ...   Melanie:  "i don't eat meat. i'm not a carnival."  (but you sure create one each time you open your mouth, honey!)   She could just be the saving grace of this entire comedy.

      The problem with getting depressed is that it's a downhill slide.  So, people knew that I was in a funk. That's downhill curve number one. I still haven't snapped out of it, and that's ok. Work provides excellent distraction, plus I'm in the middle of 2 projects that will keep me pretty busy. Deadlines are a bitch, but they're goals and hitting a goal makes me feel oh-so-very-grown-up - not to mention virtuous - so I like having them.  *Note to self: speak to "Bug" about project.*   But just because you have distractions to keep you busy, it doesn't follow that the world is distracted from hurling more crush-you-alive moments. My disasters come in multiples of three. And the funny thing is, I can't bring myself to talk about it because  everyone  (without exception) will be thinking:  "What? You're still mooning over ____?" . That's said with either a very condescending tone or a snicker.  The snickering I can take, because it is hilarious (most disasters are); it's the condescension that's insulting.  Parang , people believe that I can't feel anything independent of the intital curve ball.  *What's the english equivalent of "parang"? The closest I came was "it's like..."*   And I hope you guys appreciate that it took me an hour to put this all down because I was too afraid of rambling. I'm daunted by my own blog ... how very unlike me. And now that I read through it, I realize I didn't ramble at all, but the entire thing seems lacking. Oh well. So is my life.

      Today could just turn out to be the one day out of the rest of my mortal life where everything's peachy. Yep, you heard me right:  peachy .  Woke up with a song in my head. I was singing to it in my dream but the second I opened my eyes, it was gone. I didn't want to ask my sister about it again, lest the Great Phone Number Mystery repeats itself. The melody is still swimming around in my head, so now I feel like Ally McBeal: with a soundtrack all my own.  Speaking of my sister, her team lost in the AXN Challenge. Turns out she got heatstroke, fainted on her bike, fell, lost consciousness for a few seconds and woke up with her right side covered in bruises and scrapes. She's ok now, but my mother's nerves still aren't. My father is still in blissful ignorance about the entire thing - what he doesn't know will keep him happy.  I confirmed this morning that HunnyBunny will be nowhere near oxygen-sharing distance in the near future. You thought I'd be gutted didn't you? Nah-ah.

But you friended me and I thank you.  But here's a thought: why not take this opportunity to tell me a little something about yourself. Any old thing at all. Just so the next time I see your name I can say: "Ah, there's so and so...they're obsessed with so-and-so."  I'd love it if every single person who friended me would do this.

      I want to put my Christmas list up here, because I'm greedy and my list deserves maximum exposure. And also, part of the reason is that it's filler: I haven't been able to string together a coherent thought for the past couple of weeks  BECAUSE ALL THIS PLANNING IS MAKING MY HAIR FALL OUT .  But my list is too long and  urlLink Blogger  doesn't have the lj-cut command.  Speaking of  urlLink LiveJournal , here's my  urlLink user  icon:     Made by  urlLink gunkisfunk .

      Dear Cute guy in red hawaiian shirt,  I didn't get your name, but thank you for telling me that I had "lovely hair". I was coughing like an idiot and was probably as red as your shirt when I turned to face you, but you didn't flinch. May you make someone's day everyday.  Pia

      *Whatever I'm about to tell you isn't helped by the fact that Max Collins is singing on TV.*  So, yeah.  If you're male, I'm the last person you want to have a crush on you. Honestly. I get obsessive. I get posessive. And I don't really get over it, EVER.

      Question. Why won't Ben Affleck die? In the movies that he's been in, people drop like my Chemistry grades. All of them die, but HE survives. [My sentence construction skills leave much to be desired, I admit.]  Armageddon. Dogma. Pearl Harbor.  He's unkillable! Even after Gigli.  In other Ben Affleck related news, Gwyneth Paltrow is pregnant ( daw ).

      I got myself and  urlLink LJ  and finally got around to fiddling with it. It's still  what the hell is that?!?!?  color and layout-wise, but I'll get to fixing it eventually.  In the process of fiddling, I found the most hysterical rpg LJs ever. I pointed them out to Roxanna Banana and she said that they were "signs". She's nuttier than a fruitcake, my best friend. She's also leaving on the 12th, which means I'll be alone come Christmas. I have other friends, but Roxy's fun to be around during the Holidays. It's almost tradition that she calls me up to report that her dad blew another electrical fuse because of all the decorations he wants to put up. hee! But, sadly, none of that this year. If you live anywhere near LA, I   expect   you to welcome her at the airport bearing banners.   Speaking of flights, my  urlLink boss  and two other colleagues are leaving for Iloilo and Bacolod over the weekend. (Butterscotch bars!!!! Death by butterscotch bars -  saya !) That means I'll have to hold down the fort for the Telethon on Sunday. And I haven't been briefed yet. whee!  Oh, and I already have a New Year's resolution. I promise no to curse  as often . My mouth is a cesspool and I'm getting fecking tired of it.  See what I mean?

      Today is World Aids Day. And I'm wearing a red ribbon. Are you? And it's not because celebrities are doing it.  My mom (who is a social worker) has always encouraged us to support the fight against AIDS. It seemed pretty strange at first - we didn't know anyone who had the disease. She said that it didn't matter.   Most of the people who get AIDS are people my age. Most of the people infected are people who live in Asia.    Asian people my age. That hits too close to home.  AIDS awareness started out as my mom's cause. Now it's mine too. I don't apologize for sounding like a commercial.

      If you're ever in a funk again - you know, underappreciated, unloved - go  urlLink here  and validate your existence. External validation is a good thing, regardless of what anyone tells you.  According to  urlLink them ,  urlLink September  (my birthday month) is:   ADHD Month   - explains a lot.  Be Kind To Editors and Writers Month   - kitam?  Hug a Texas Chef Month  - Tyler Florence is from where?  International Gay Square Dancing Month Library Card Sign-up Month  - haha!! i have a reason to taunt people who don't own library cards!  National Humor in Business Month  - the business I'm involved with is humorous, alright.  National Rice Month  - reason why I can never do Atkins.  Pleasure Your Mate Month  - Orayt!!!!  Subliminal Marketing Month    September is a great month :)

       Minsan sa isang buwan ipinapanalangin ko na sana naging lalaki na lang ako. O kaya puno ng papaya, kasi joskoh. Masakit.  Punyemas na puson 'to.  ----------   Magsasara na ang  provincial chatrooms  ng    urlLink PinoyCentral  TV.  Haaaaay. Ang sakit aminin.  Yun ang dahilan ng meeting kahapon. Hindi inaasahan; ayaw naming mangyari, pero ano pa nga ba ang magagawa namin?  There was a small part of me that was glad that I and several others were staying, but I was unhappy for the most part.  Karamihan kasi ng mawawala e yung mga nakasama ko na dito ng matagal. May mga kaibigan na naman ako na hindi ko madalas makikita. Pero ganon e. Ipinagdarasal ko na lang na sila din ang magpuno sa mga posisyon na bukas dito sa opisina.    Sabi nga ng   urlLink boss  ko: Dream. Believe. Survive.

       ...If there's one thing I've learned, it's never to settle for anything less that what you need.    ...The sad thing about life is that dreams are usually so cookie-cutter perfect, that people just settle for the closest things to them. They don't believe in the sheer possibility of their dreams.

      We weren't the closest growing up, my cousin and I. We shared a crib, but that was because my mom and his mom suddenly decided that they needed each other through their pregnancies (my mom's first, my  tita's  third). Tess (mommy) and Cecilia (his mom) spent a lot of time in the same house after the births (mine in September, his in October) so we were alternatly dumped in each other's cribs. According to my Child Psych professor (Prof. Claravall, Yale must be  lurving  you), children have no memories before the age of three so I don't have any recollection of how we related to each other. Although the mommies would frequently retell stories of how I bullied him because I was the bigger baby (size-wise  then - he's about 6'2" now, I'm still a midget).  My sister and I are the only females born into our generation (first cousins-wise) but unlike her, I never hung our with my male cousins. I couldn't be as "rough" as them and I decided that having bruises and cuts didn't exactly endear me to my father's nerves. Pre-puberty and the teen years were painful as you can surmise.  OK, so we're still not close. I haven't spoken with him for over 2 years. I get news of how he is from his mom and from his brothers, but from him? pffft.  So why, then, should I be bothered about the news that he has an almost year-old-child? That I have 2 almost one-year-old nieces? I feel like this invalidates me further than I already am.  P.S. I'm also worried that this further reinstates everyone's supposition that we're turning out to become the "normal" ones; the "good" children. Because I'm not  entirely  sure that it's a good thing.

Sabi nung may sulat na kung sa beauty contest nga kailangan ng question and answer portion para manalo ang isang contestant, bakit sa presidential elections parang optional.  Tama nga naman. Kung sekretarya nga kailangan college graduate, bakit hindi requirement yun sa mga tatakbo?

      My migraines have been getting progressively worse for the last two years. And since there's no cure for it, I'm stuck with blinding, thought-process dulling, debilitating headaches indefinitely.  And what I've been told is that certain foods  might  contribute to their occurrence: cheese, nuts, MSG, peanuts. Guess what I'm having for lunch?  Pizza. And pasta. And I have wasabi peanuts here too.  A migraine beats boredom any day of the week.

      New addictions:  1.  urlLink American Idol   I saw the first episode (we get them later than you, my American friends) last night on  urlLink Star TV . Good thing it came after the Robbie Williams: Live in Knebworth special on Myx, because I would not have missed it for the world. I could not believe the guts (gall?) of some of the people auditioning. If THEY can SING, then I can sing. And most days I sound like a drowning cat.  I actually saw  urlLink World Idol  before I got to see American Idol (I was rooting for Kurt Nilsen and Will Young), and loved that. And I think it won't be long before the Philiipines makes Pinoy Idol (or something),  kasi Joshko, kelan ba tayo nagpatalo sa kantahan?  Actually, they should just bring the show here and my next door neighbor would blow the judges away. I swear to God.  2. Te Amo   Yeah yeah yeah. I'm cheesy. I admit it. But Iza Calzado is just lovely and PERNANDO is charming. Nevermind that all they seem to do is scream a lot.  And  urlLink CSI  is coming back next week! Wheeeee!  p.s. There's a Filipina in this years batch of American Idol contestants,  urlLink Camille Velasco . Another reason for us to get a franchise. Paging Mr. Lopez!!!!

      I got this from  urlLink Camden 's blog. And because I'm killing time before  urlLink Survivor  comes on.   PATRICIA   Feminine form of  Patricius  Irish, English, French, German; From the Roman name  Patricius , which meant "nobleman" in Latin. A 5th-century saint, the patron saint of Ireland, adopted this name (his birth name was Sucat). -  explains why I always believed I was Irish.    ANNE  French, English, German and Scandinavian form of Hannah; From the Hebrew name  Channah  which meant "favour" or "grace".   DE VERA  "Of Truth"   GARCIA  Spanish, patronymic derived from the personal name GARCIA 'spear, firm,' the Spanish form of Gerald 'spear, firm'; some authorities translate it as 'youth or prince.' Garcia was King of Navarre.   This makes me completely stalk-able now.  ---------------     YUP.

      Just so you guys know- we are equally at risk.  Important Warning for Men   Police are warning all men who frequent clubs, parties and local pubs to be alert and stay cautious when offered a drink from any woman.  A date rape drug on the market called "Beer" is used by many females to target unsuspecting men. The drug is generally found in liquid form and is now available almost anywhere. It comes in bottles, cans, from taps and in large "kegs."  Beer is used by female sexual predators at parties and bars to persuade their male victims to go home and have sex with them. Typically, a woman needs only to persuade a guy to consume a few units of Beer and then simply ask him home for no strings attached sex.  Men are rendered helpless against this approach. After several Beers, men will often succumb to desires to perform sexual acts on horrific looking women to whom they would never normally be attracted.  After drinking Beer men often awaken with only hazy memories of exactly what happened to them the night before, often with just a vague feeling that: "something bad" occurred.  At other times these unfortunate men are swindled out of their life's savings, in a familiar scam known as "a relationship."  It has been reported that in extreme cases, the female may even be Shrewd enough to entrap the unsuspecting male into a longer term form of servitude and punishment referred to as "marriage."  Apparently, men are much more susceptible to this scam after Beer is administered and sex is offered by the predatory females.  Please! Forward this warning to every male you know. If you fall victim to this insidious Beer and the predatory women administering it, there are male support groups with venues in every town where you can discuss the details of your shocking encounter in an open and frank manner with similarly affected, like-minded guys.  For the support group nearest you, just look up "Golf Courses" in the yellow pages.

The Idea and The Rules * 21 categories exist. * Choose a song for each one. * Each song must be by a different artist. * You may opt to alter the wording of one category. The new category must be somehow related to the old one. * For an added challenge, make the total playing time of your mix under 80 minutes. * This odd assortment of tunes will create a "Frankenstein mix." Choose a song...  1. from the last CD you purchased  -  Oceano , from Joshie's Closer  2. labeled blues or "the blues"    3. that gets you going in the morning  - Hot Fudge  4. that's romantic  -   5. that's one of the first you remember hearing 6. you discovered from a film 7. from your favorite band or artist 8. from a band or artist that you don't really like except for this song 9. that's a lullabye 10. that makes you laugh 11. that's a really good cover version 12. that reminds you of school days 13. from an artist that you are embarrassed to admit you like 14. that's FUNKY! 15. for those quiet rainy nights 16. that no matter when you hear it, it makes you feel good 17. with the word "Look" in the title 18. from a member of the Dead Rocker's Society 19. that is your favorite from Elvis 20. randomly, that you feel fits 21. by or about Johnny Cash/that gives you that old country feeling

      I just got this book,  urlLink Letters From A Nut , written by a man named Ted L. Nancy.  One of the letters in the book go:   Dear Nordstron Dept Stores,  I am a regular shopper at your Nordstrom store in Glendale. In the last few weeks I have noticed that a new mannequin you have out in the store looks just like my deceased neighbor...It looks like the neighbor I was friendly with.  ...Is it possible to buy this mannequin (after its use) so I may present it to my neighbor's family? They would think this would be a VERY sentimental gesture.  I think his co-workers would also like to have him remembered, so having him "there" would be good, therapeutic behavior  for all.  ...Thank you, Nordstrom, for being a store that cares about its customers. I am a long time shopper. I keep lots of things in your Nordstrom bags. Fishing gear, etc. I have a garage full of Nordstrom bags full of old shoes, wire hangers, etc. That's how I know i've been to your store so much. Let me know about the mannequin. This family is in some need of good loving.  This will help!  Sincerely, Ted L. Nancy   I want to meet this guy.

      Proven fact: a clean room will want to make you lie down and vegetate.  My room is so clean you can eat off the floor. I threw away tons of stuff, dusted, Pledge-d surfaces, waxed, emptied, purged, changed everything. It was 11pm when I ended, but it was worth it.  Now, because I think I have a slight case of OCD, I'm afraid to mess everything up so I overcompensate. I sleep in the spare room.

      Nicked off someone on my LJ list.   So, say you were meeting a new person--blind date, new friend, who knows. And you wanted them to have some idea of what kind of person you are, and who you are. But you can't actually tell them in so many words. Instead, you have to give them a box, with a dozen things in it for them to look at/read/listen to/taste/whatever. What would you put in the box? And a copy of your journal or a link to your LJ would be the same thing as just telling them directly, yourself, so that's not allowed.

      All the guys I've ever liked (AND never liked me in return - I have to put that disclaimer in there) have terrible, horrible, deplorable taste in women. I swear to God ( HAPPY EASTER!!! ).  The kind that makes you want to bathe in holy water.  Their relationships always start with the usual  "I love her so much / she's my best friend / she's my angel / I-want-you-I-need-you-oh-baby-oh-baby"  BS, but then a few months later. pfft. They break up. It's true. And then the girl ends up showing her true colors. I do my little happy dance because I'm vindicated, and then I want to hunt down the guy and walk up and down his street wearing a shirt with I TOLD YOU SO printed on it.  Aaaanyway.   My point is, if you've ever believed yourself to be one of the guys I'm mooning over and you've never paid ME any attention, leave your name and address in the comment thingy below so I can wear my special shirt when I come up and meet you.  Revenge is best served with a sense of humor.

      I was watching HBO this morning and  urlLink Blue Collar Comedy Tour: The Movie  was on. Hysterical. I nearly passed out laughing at these guys do their schtick. Granted a lot of the comedy was redneck humor, but it was still funny.  The first guy on (Ron White) said this about the Texas crimminal justice system:   In Texas we have the death penalty and we're not afraid to use it. You kill someone and we'll kill you right back...Texas is trying to pass a law that says when you are convicted of a heinous crime and there are more than three credible witnesses, you don't sit around and wait for fiteeen years - you get to go the front of the line...While other states are trying to abolish it, Texas wants to put up an express lane.   Go see it if you can.

      I'm taking it as signs to move far, FAR away from here:   1.  The network at Studio 10 hates me. Everytime I log in for YYS, everything stops; the minute the IT guys show their shadows, everything is peachy.   2.  The elevators insist on messing with my sanity.  Do I really need a three?

       urlLink  Stop looking to some dead man for a quick fix diet and just eat like a sensible human being.  If you're a fat bastard, fine. Be a fat bastard. If you're an anorexic jackass with a thyroid problem, fine. Be a twig.  Besides, I'm not going to buy into a fucking diet that says:  "You know what? You can eat three burgers and a pound of bacon but you can't have an apple. Because the apple has carbs."   Just be yourself. Eat that twinkie; enjoy that cake; buy that extra pound of gourmet cream cheese you've always wanted. And if people look at you funny because you're too fat or too skinny, tell them to fuck off and die.

      I wish it were Friday so I can go home to the apartment in densely packed Manila, curl up on the bed and bawl to my best friend because I feel stupid.  She would listen , then tell me to clean up and get ready so we can go watch  The Prince and Me   again.  Tapos , we'd be in the cinema making all those  kilig  sounds that women of non-existent love lives make when confronted with images of love so potent, that the players of the drama cannot keep their hands off each other.  Then it's back to the apartment, watching reruns of TV shows and trying to understand neurological pathways. At 2 am it's back down to the Mini Stop across the street so we can ogle the guys and their "girlfriends."  My life may be monotonous, but at least I find amunsement in it.

      Unang-una, hindi ako aangal kung walang dapat iangal. Pero napapadalas ata ang mga pangyayari na dapat kong ihiyaw. Tatablan din pala ako ng pagod at inis dito.   Gusto ko lang sana, e makita ko naman na nakasulat sa papel ang talagang dapat kong ginagawa. Hindi yung dahil nagawa ko noon, ako na panghabang-buhay ang sasalo. Magulo ata 'yon. Nakaklito.  At oo, naisip ko din na kaya sa akin bumabagsak ang lahat ng 'to e dahil tine- train   pa rin ako hanggang ngayon. Oo nga, nandon na nga ako - pero hindi ko ata nararamdaman yun. Parang dumadami lang ginagawa ko, wala naman akong mapapala.

      GRAVITY is the greatest unifying force in the world. Not the Olympics. Not music. Not collective bewilderment regarding the aberration that is Paris Hilton, but GRAVITY.  It especially binds those of us who work at a building whose elevators refuse to work on this specific Monday morning.  And mocks those of us who aren't triathletes AND work at the 9th floor.

       1.  While living in Manila (the city, not the metropolis) is fan-freaking-tabulous, it would be better if we had a view. From the seventh floor all I can see are the backs of buildings and helipads.   2.  Kim in howling denial of Prisseh's forthcoming wedding to Mommy is something all women can relate to. What was it you said Kim? Oh. I OBJECT!!   3.  One article down, one to go.    4.  To do or not to do, that is the dilemma.   5.  Before I expound on Jon, introduce yourselves first. My blog, my rules.

       HINDI KO RESPONSIBILIDAD ANG MAG-MAN NG CHATROOM.   Pagdating ng 7, maski kung ano pa ang ginagawa mo, IKAW ang dapat na nandito. Hindi ako. WALA akong pakialam kung ano pa yang sine-celebrate mo. Gawin mo trabaho mo. Walang pase-pasensha kasi hindi ko trabaho 'to.

       Feelin' blue, while I'm trying to forget the feeling that I miss you Feelin' green, when the jealousy swells and it won't go away in dreams Feelin' yellow, I'm confused inside A little hazy but mellow when I feel your eyes on me Feelin' fine! Sublime! When that smile of yours creeps into my mind  Nobody told me you'd feel so good Nobody said you'd be so beautiful Nobody warned me about your smile You're the light, you're the light When I close my eyes I'm colour blind  Feelin' red, when you spend all your time with your friends and not me instead Feelin' black, when I think about all the things that I feel I lack Feelin' jaded, when it's not gone right All the colours have faded, then I feel your eyes on me Feelin' fine! Sublime! When that smile of yours creeps into my mind  Blinded by the light you shine, the colours fade completely Blinded by you every time, I feel your smile defeat me I'm colour blind I just can't deny this feeling   Colourblind. Darius Danesh.  Pop Idol  kicks  American Idol  to the curb any day of the week. Anna will keeeeeeeeeeel me.
