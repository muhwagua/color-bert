      A little progress update.  The draft of the first chapter is done.  I am really excited and totally enjoying the experience.  It takes up so much of my time.  I hope I can carry it through to the end.    I started feeling for my characters, they shaped up in my mind and started breathing and actually acting up, helping me write.  I feel like Doctor Frankenstein, except my monsters are going to turn out great, I know it.  Well, It's late.  I spent all the day thinking and all the evening writing.  I'm tired...  I think I'll call it a night.  If I am able to sleep, that is.  I can't seem to be able to turn my mind off the story, it is playing in my mind all the time.

      Until today, I probably was one of the few people in the world that had not yet seen the Abu Ghraib abuse photos.  Well, now I have:  urlLink this article  shows a few of them.  Somehow I feel that these aren't the worst ones.    What an ugly thing the world is.  People  are  animals... worse than the animals.  Unlike them, we cause harm fully conscious of the effects.  I don't care what is the reason: religion, money, but we should really stop hurting each other.  I hate seeing how evil the human race gets sometimes.  I am ashamed to be one of them.  Hatred is destructive.  Violence only creates more violence.  May we all get wiser some day...

      Well, It's officially decided.  I'm going to do it.    Write the novel that is.  The plot is thought through, I think it's quite solid.  The lead and principal characters are laid out, well most of them, I'll leave the rest to the story to reveal.  Next comes the storyline, and the actual writing...    Why, would you ask, all this organization?  Well, I find that this particular "writer" ( moi ) is not the kind that can just sit down without any preparation, except maybe buying a few packs of blank paper, and birth a whole book.  I lose the thread after ten pages into the damned thing.  Every time, the idea's gone, like it never existed.  A short story, yes.  But never a long piece.    I really wonder how some writers do it.  Just imagine, armed only with a typewriter, you sit down and punch out a masterpiece in just two weeks time,  voilà ...  Man, I wish I was talented like that.  Anyway, the ship has sailed, and we can't turn back, Boss, oh no...

      I have a solid idea for a novel.  It's a good action piece, sci-fi.  The plot is very twisted, multilayered, with three very different protagonists, each with their own point of view.  I like the idea a lot.  But do I dare to take it on?  Do I dare to write it?  See, here's the problem.  If you ever read any of my posts you might have already guessed that English is not my first language.  It's not even the second.  It could be good enough for a casual conversation, maybe even tolerable for a blog, but I don't think it would pull a whole book, nope...    So there, I dream of being a writer, a novelist, but I lack the only tool I need to make this dream come true.  Man, I wish I had at least some extra moula for some kind of a "creative English writing" or any other type of "getting pretty darn good at English" course.  At least photography doesn't recognize any language barriers.  Good old Canon, my buddy, it doesn't care about my accent or my vocabulary.  Click...  Click...  Frame after frame it stamps the black and white of the world the way I see it, no translation required...

      She was running through the woods, the fresh night air feeling cool in her lungs with every inhale...  Her pace was steady, the jeans felt tight around her thighs, making it harder to run.  The bulk of the gun weighed down her jacket.  She was playing the conversation with Alan again and again in her head.  It didn't go as she planned at all.  She felt frustrated. She failed, and now it was the time for the backup plan.  Her legs were beginning to feel tired.  She saw lights far up ahead through the fog and picked up her pace.  The pathway must be leading out to the highway.  She was anxious to leave the place, it gave her the creeps...  A branch cracked on her side, breaking the silence.  Too late, she realized, as her eyes caught a sudden movement in the shadows of the trees.  Jumping up, she got a hold of a thick oak branch above her and swung her body backwards spinning through the air, landing hard on her feet just a few yards behind, barely avoiding the mass of a large wolf that had leapt out of the darkness.  Eyes wide with terror, she watched as the beast slowly turned around preparing for another attack.  Its eyes were glowing red, and she could see the whites of the bared teeth in the moonlight.  It was one of Alan's, the intelligence report flashed in her memory, must be the perimeter security.  "Don't be an idiot, Alan," she said, reaching into the pocket and feeling the reassuring cold metal in her hand.  "Call it off!"  The wolf sprang, aiming for her throat.  With a hard kick she rolled out of its way and fired.  The jolt of the feedback echoed with a wave of pain in her arm, throwing her backwards.  The wolf fell down, filling the air with a strong smell of burning plastic.  Thick smoke was coming out of the mesh of wires and circuitry exposed in the big hole in its side.  It wasn't moving.  "You bastard!" she jumped to the machine and kicked it.  "You fucking bastard!"  She threw the gun away and kicked, again, and again...  When her hysteria was finally gone, she realized that she was crying.  Wiping her face, she sat down on the ground, her knees shaking and her heart pounding, loud in her ears.  She covered her head with her hands and tried to get her thoughts straight.  It wasn't supposed to get this ugly.  She had brought the weapon along just in case, more as a safety measure, but now she felt glad she did.  What had just happened?  The wolf wouldn't attack her without an order, but why would Alan want her dead?  She slowly got up and looked around, picked up the gun from the ground.  The night was getting colder.  She shivered and started walking, heading towards the lights of the highway.  She had to warn the others...

      What are we? Animals with a bad case of schizophrenia we call intellect?  Or, perhaps, we're some kind of higher beings trapped in our earthly shells? I really wish I knew...  We live our lives, pretending that we're doing something so very important. Jobs, art, parties, fun... What for? Look at the big picture: you are born... you live... you die. Who said that things we do in the tiny flash of light in the dark we call "life" are actually worth anything?  Sure, you can start talking all the high-morale bull. I hope you really believe it, because if not... if not, well then you're just lying to yourself, and if there's something worse than being oblivious, it's not being honest to ourselves.  Some say that we live for our children. Our children... We give them life. Why? So they, in their turn, go on contemplating their own purpose? Is there such a thing -- purpose?  I hope there is... Because I am out looking for it.

      He was leaving. He knew they would hate him for it. He wasn't sure if they would ever forgive him, but he hoped they would try to understand some day.  He looked at his older son. The toddler was now sound asleep in his bed. He sat down feeling tired, empty. "You won't even remember me in a couple of years," he thought. He knew that and it hurt. He kept imagining them grown up. . . His life had spun around them for the last five years. He didn't know how it would be to live without them around. It scared him.  She was in the bedroom. She wasn't crying anymore. He knew that he shouldn't blame her. He wasn't blaming anyone.  "I'm leaving," he told her that evening, watching her face gradually change from surprise to panic. Saying it was easier than he thought it would be. He didn't love her anymore. He wasn't even sure he ever did. It felt like an eternity had passed since he had first met her.  "I'll get my things later." He felt calm inside. It felt like it was someone else -- not him -- speaking. She was asking for explanations. He didn't want to talk to her. There wasn't anything to explain. He was leaving. He couldn't stand the same life anymore. He needed a change. He needed to start over.  He shut the door. . .

       It's easy to decide "Hey, I should start a blog!" You read up on the technology, learn some tips and tricks. You love the idea and can't wait to try it out for yourself. The account is set up, you chose a basic template for THE BLOG THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE THE WORLD. Of course you'll have to design a super-sexy customized template after, when you find time for it. Now it's the time for your first post...  This is where you realize that you can't seem to find what to write about. You are sitting in front of the computer, staring at a blank rectangle on the screen. "Compose," it says. What is it you are going to compose that someone would be interested in checking out? Maybe, you should just type whatever comes to your mind and, even though you're your only audience, enjoy the moment of contributing something to the world? No, that would be mental masturbation now, wouldn't it? Then what is it I have to say? Hell, everybody has to have something good to say, otherwise why exist?!  Now the stakes have grown much higher than you thought. An innocent idea of setting up a blog, claiming a tiny piece of the cyberspace and sticking a little flag that says "A. Z." in the corner, is now swollen into an ever-terrifying question of the purpose of living itself. Feeling a  déjà vu , you just want to give up, forget the whole idea. You know that once it gets to this level, the pressure you put on yourself will ruin any kind of possible pleasure. The inevitable failure to reach the standards, which you are in the process of setting so high for yourself, will eventually crush you down into another month of depression. You curse yourself for making your life always so complicated.  After all, who's interested in what you come up with at all? Discouraged, you close the browser, curl up on the couch and get back to sleep...
